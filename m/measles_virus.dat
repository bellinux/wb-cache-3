5|$|The trial {{opened on}} June 11, 2007 in Washington, DC. The Cedillos' six expert {{witnesses}} argued that thimerosal-containing vaccines degraded Michelle's immune system, {{which in turn}} {{made it possible for}} the weakened <b>measles</b> <b>virus</b> in the MMR vaccine to cause a persistent infection leading to autism. In support of this hypothesis, the Cedillos' witnesses relied on the reported detection of <b>measles</b> <b>virus</b> in Michelle's gastrointestinal tract by John O'Leary's Unigenetics laboratory in Dublin. However, the government's expert witnesses conclusively demonstrated that O'Leary's positive results were caused by contamination in the Unigenetics lab rather than an actual infection.|$|E
5|$|Rinderpest, {{which is}} caused by a virus closely related to <b>measles</b> <b>virus,</b> is a disease of cattle known since Roman times. The disease, which {{originated}} in Asia, was first brought to Europe by the invading Huns in 370. Later invasions of Mongols, led by Genghis Khan and his army, started pandemics in Europe in 1222, 1233 and 1238. The infection subsequently reached England following the importation of cattle from the continent. At the time rinderpest was a devastating disease with a mortality rate of 80–90%. The resulting loss of cattle caused famine.|$|E

40|$|Molecular {{characterization}} of wild-type <b>measles</b> <b>viruses</b> in China during 1995 - 2004 demonstrated that genotype H 1 was endemic and widely {{distributed throughout the}} country. H 1 -associated cases and outbreaks caused a resurgence of measles beginning in 2005. A total of 210, 094 measles cases and 101 deaths were reported by National Notifiable Diseases Reporting System (NNDRS) and Chinese Measles Laboratory Network (LabNet) from 2006 to 2007, and the incidences of measles were 6. 8 / 100, 000 population and 7. 2 / 100, 000 population in 2006 and 2007, respectively. Five hundred and sixty-five wild-type <b>measles</b> <b>viruses</b> were isolated from 24 of 31 provinces in mainland China during 2006 and 2007, {{and all of the}} wild type virus isolates belonged to cluster 1 of genotype H 1. These results indicated that H 1 -cluster 1 viruses were the predominant viruses circulating in China from 2006 to 2007. This study contributes to previous efforts to generate critical baseline data about circulating wild-type <b>measles</b> <b>viruses</b> in China that will allow molecular epidemiologic studies to help measure the progress made toward China's goal of measles elimination by 2012...|$|R

25|$|Measles {{is caused}} by the <b>measles</b> <b>virus,</b> a single-stranded, negative-sense, enveloped RNA virus of the genus Morbillivirus within the family Paramyxoviridae. The virus was first {{isolated}} in 1954 by Nobel Laureate John F. Enders and Thomas Peebles, who were careful {{to point out that the}} isolations were made from patients who had Koplik's spots. Humans are the only natural hosts of the virus, and no other animal reservoirs are known to exist. This highly contagious virus is spread by coughing and sneezing via close personal contact or direct contact with secretions. Risk factors for <b>measles</b> <b>virus</b> infection include immunodeficiency caused by HIV or AIDS, immunosuppression following receipt of an organ or a stem cell transplant, alkylating agents, or corticosteroid therapy, regardless of immunization status; travel to areas where measles is endemic or contact with travelers to endemic areas; and the loss of passive, inherited antibodies before the age of routine immunization.|$|E

25|$|Alternatively, {{laboratory}} diagnosis of measles {{can be done}} with confirmation of positive measles IgM antibodies or isolation of <b>measles</b> <b>virus</b> RNA from respiratory specimens. For people unable to have their blood drawn, saliva can be collected for salivary measles-specific IgA testing.

40|$|Abstract Background Genetic {{analysis}} of <b>measles</b> <b>viruses</b> associated with recent cases and outbreaks {{has proven to}} bridge information gaps in routine outbreak investigations and has made a substantial contribution to measles control efforts by helping to identify the transmission pathways of the virus. Materials and methods The present study describes the genetic characterization of wild type <b>measles</b> <b>viruses</b> from Uttar Pradesh, India isolated between January 2008 and January 2011. In the study, 526 suspected measles cases from 15 outbreaks were investigated. Blood samples were collected from suspected measles outbreaks and tested {{for the presence of}} measles specific IgM; throat swab and urine samples were collected for virus isolation and RT-PCR. Genotyping of circulating <b>measles</b> <b>viruses</b> in Uttar Pradesh was performed by sequencing a 450 -bp region encompassing the nucleoprotein hypervariable region and phylogenetic analysis. Results and conclusion Based on serological results, all the outbreaks were confirmed as measles. Thirty eight strains were obtained. Genetic {{analysis of}} circulating measles strains (n[*]=[*] 38) in Uttar Pradesh from 235 cases of laboratory-confirmed cases from 526 suspected measles cases between 2008 and 2011 showed that all viruses responsible for outbreaks were within clade D and all were genotype D 8. Analysis of this region showed that it is highly divergent (up to 3. 4 % divergence in the nucleotide sequence and 4. 1 % divergence in the amino acid sequence between most distant strains). Considerable genetic heterogeneity was observed in the MV genotype D 8 viruses in North India and underscores the need for continued surveillance and in particular increases in vaccination levels to decrease morbidity and mortality attributable to measles. </p...|$|R

25|$|Measles is {{a highly}} {{contagious}} infection caused by the <b>measles</b> <b>virus.</b> Initial signs and symptoms typically include fever, often greater than , cough, runny nose, and inflamed eyes. Two or {{three days after the}} start of symptoms, small white spots may form inside the mouth, known as Koplik's spots. A red, flat rash which usually starts on the face and then spreads {{to the rest of the}} body typically begins three to five days after the start of symptoms. Symptoms usually develop 10–12 days after exposure to an infected person and last 7–10 days. Complications occur in about 30% and may include diarrhea, blindness, inflammation of the brain, and pneumonia among others. Rubella (German measles) and roseola are different diseases.|$|E
500|$|Hastings, in his decision, {{noted that}} [...] "all of the petitioners' {{causation}} theories {{depend upon the}} validity of certain testing that purported to find evidence of persisting <b>measles</b> <b>virus</b> in the biological materials of Michelle {{and a number of}} other children with autism." [...] However, Hastings concluded that this testing was [...] "not reliable." [...] In his decision, he noted that the authors of the D'Souza paper first performed PCR on PBMCs from children with autism, which resulted in a large proportion of apparently positive results. However, [...] "the D'Souza group... subjected those apparently positive samples to additional testing techniques in order to determine whether the PCR testing using the Uhlmann primers was truly identifying <b>measles</b> <b>virus</b> and only <b>measles</b> <b>virus....</b> The application of those two techniques revealed that all but nine of the samples that had initially tested positive by the PCR test using the Uhlmann primers were, in fact, not measles virus." [...] With regard to the 9 remaining samples, the D'Souza paper performed sequencing on 7 of those samples. This step [...] "demonstrated that the material, which in the PCR testing had appeared to be <b>measles</b> <b>virus</b> material, was in fact not <b>measles</b> <b>virus</b> material, but human genetic material." ...|$|E

40|$|International audienceGenetic {{characterization}} {{was conducted}} on 18 wild-type <b>measles</b> <b>viruses,</b> detected in Tunisia and Libya from 2002 to 2009. Sequence analysis of the 456 nucleotides in the carboxy terminus of the nucleoprotein (N) gene and the entire hemagglutinin (H) gene indicated that all isolates were in genotype B 3. All of the viruses from 2002 to 2007 {{and some of the}} isolates from 2009 belonged to subtype B 3. 1. In contrast, 7 of the viruses isolated during 2008 and 2009 were quite divergent from all B 3 isolates. The nucleotide sequences of the N gene of these 7 isolates differed from the sequences of the Ibadan and New York reference strain by an average of 3. 1 and 4. 4 %, respectively. The H gene sequences differed by 1. 1 and 2. 6 % with the same reference strains.

500|$|In the Cedillo case, {{her family}} claimed that Michelle was normal until {{receiving}} her vaccines, {{as evidenced by}} a number of videos of her between the age of 6 and 8 months.
