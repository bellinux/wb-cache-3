5|$|In {{the event}} {{the office is}} vacant, the {{election}} to replace the president <b>must</b> <b>occur</b> between thirty and seventy days after the vacancy occurred. During normal election cycles, the elections <b>must</b> <b>occur</b> before {{the last two months}} of the current president. In either situation, the government body that calls for elections is the House of Representatives. The last round of presidential elections occurred in 2015. President Lukashenko, when addressing the press in February 2007, stated his health will determine if he will run in 2011 or step down at that time.|$|E

5|$|Nahuatl {{does not}} have {{grammatical}} case but uses what is sometimes called a relational noun to describe spatial (and other) relations. These morphemes cannot appear alone but <b>must</b> <b>occur</b> after a noun or a possessive prefix. They are also often called postpositions or locative suffixes. In some ways these locative constructions resemble and {{can be thought of}} as locative case constructions. Most modern dialects have incorporated prepositions from Spanish that are competing with or that have completely replaced relational nouns.|$|E
5|$|There {{are many}} {{volcanic}} {{areas in the}} world that have hot springs, mud pots and fumaroles, but very few have erupting geysers. The main reason for their rarity is because multiple intense transient forces <b>must</b> <b>occur</b> simultaneously for a geyser to exist. For example, even when other necessary conditions exist, if the rock structure is loose, eruptions will erode the channels and rapidly destroy any nascent geysers.|$|E
5|$|Baleen whales {{use their}} baleen plates to sieve plankton, among others, {{out of the}} water; {{there are two types}} of methods: lunge-feeding and gulp-feeding. Lunge-feeders expand the volume of their jaw to a volume bigger than the {{original}} volume of the whale itself by inflating their mouth. This causes grooves on their throat to expand, increasing the amount of water the mouth can store. They ram a baitball at high speeds in order to feed, but this is only energy-effective when used against a large baitball. Gulp-feeders swim with an open mouth, filling it with water and prey. Prey <b>must</b> <b>occur</b> in sufficient numbers to trigger the whale's interest, be within a certain size range so that the baleen plates can filter it, and be slow enough so that it cannot escape.|$|E

5|$|Articles 87 through 89 of the Constitution {{deal with}} how the {{presidency}} can change hands in-between election cycles. The President {{has the ability to}} resign from office at any time under Article 87. The letter of resignation is sent to the House of Representatives and is accepted by them. The President has the ability to be removed from office if his physical or mental health is impaired under Article 88. In order for this to happen, a two-thirds majority must be reached in the House of Representatives and the Council of the Republic on the resolution to remove the President. An ad hoc committee is formed and must make the determination about the state of health before any motion can begin. If the President has committed a grave crime, such as treason, one-third of the House must bring charges against the President formally. The investigation of the charges will be conducted by the Council of the Republic. In order to evict the President from office, a two-thirds majority is needed to vote in favor of conviction. The criminal case is further sent to the Supreme Court for review. The actions of either option <b>must</b> <b>occur</b> one month after the resolution is passed or the action will be considered void by the Constitution.|$|E
5|$|Horizontal jumps (long {{jump and}} triple jump) and all throws must be {{initiated}} behind a line. In {{the case of}} horizontal jumps, that line is a straight line perpendicular to the runway. In the case of throws, that line is an arc or a circle. Crossing the line while initiating the attempt invalidates the attempt—it becomes a foul. All landings <b>must</b> <b>occur</b> in a sector. For the jumps, that is a sand filled pit, for throws it is a defined sector. A throw landing on the line {{on the edge of}} sector is a foul (the inside edge of the line is the outside edge of the sector). Assuming a proper attempt, officials measure the distance from the closest landing point back to the line. The measuring tape is carefully straightened to the shortest distance between the point and the line. To accomplish this, the tape must be perfectly perpendicular to the take off line in jumps, or is pulled through the center point of the arc for throws. The officials at the landing end of the tape have the zero, while the officials at the point of initiation measure and record the length. Whenever a record (or potential record) occurs, that measurement is taken (again) with a steel tape, and observed by at least three officials (plus usually the meet referee). Steel tapes are easily bent and damaged, so are not used to measure everyday competitions. For major competitions, each competitor gets three tries. The top competitors (usually 8 or 9 depending on that competition's rules or the number of lanes on the track) gets three more tries. At that level of competition, the order of competitors for those final three attempts are set—so the competitor in first place {{at the end of the}} third round is last, while the last competitor to qualify goes first. Some meets rearrange the competition order again for the final round, so the final attempt is taken by the leader at that point. At other competitions, meet management may choose to limit all competitors to four or three attempts. Whatever the format, all competitors get an equal number of attempts.|$|E
