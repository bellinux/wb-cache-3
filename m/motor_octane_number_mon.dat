Chapter Three comprehensively reviews literature on fuel characteristics; specifically boiling point, chemistry {{and the difference between}} the Research and <b>Motor</b> <b>Octane</b> <b>Number</b> (RON and <b>MON).</b> Furthermore different types of autoignition are discussed with regards to their detection and assessment in the chapter. The subsection on engine management looks at possible methods of altering and eliminating autoignition.

Chapter Five {{discusses the}} actual results obtained during summer testing of the different methods of altering and eliminating autoignition in an internal combustion engine, as derived from the theories presented in Chapter Three. The summer tests finally verified the new application level and showed that only a reduction in the quantity of fuel injected can eliminate autoignition. However, a slight decrease in heat release does cause an increase in start time. In Chapter Six, based on the test results, a simulation model which calculates the probability of autoignition in a 1. 4 l (Econo) engine during hot start conditions in Matlab/Simulink was developed.

40|$|Gasoline {{anti-knock}} quality, {{defined by}} the research and <b>motor</b> <b>octane</b> <b>numbers</b> (RON and <b>MON),</b> is important for increasing spark ignition (SI) engine efficiency. Gasoline knock resistance can be increased using a number of blending components. For over two decades, ethanol has become a popular anti-knock blending agent with gasoline fuels due to its production from bio-derived resources. This work explores the oxidation behavior of two oxygenated certification gasoline fuels and the variation of fuel reactivity with molecular composition. Ignition delay times of Haltermann (RON =[*] 91) and Coryton (RON =[*] 97. 5) gasolines have been measured in a high-pressure shock tube and in a rapid compression machine at three pressures of 10, 20 and 40  bar, at equivalence ratios of φ[*]=[*] 0. 45, 0. 9 and 1. 8, and in the temperature range of 650 – 1250  K. The {{results indicate that the}} effects of fuel <b>octane</b> <b>number</b> and fuel composition on ignition characteristics are strongest in the intermediate temperature (negative temperature coefficient) region. To simulate the reactivity of these gasolines, three kinds of surrogates, consisting of three, four and eight components, are proposed and compared with the gasoline ignition delay times. It is shown that more complex surrogate mixtures are needed to emulate the reactivity of gasoline with higher octane sensitivity (S = RON–MON).

40|$|Avoiding knock is {{the major}} design {{constraint}} for spark ignition engines because of the unacceptable noise and engine damage associated with it. Hence, the Research and <b>Motor</b> <b>Octane</b> <b>Number</b> (RON and <b>MON)</b> tests were established in 1928 such that a fuel with a higher RON and MON {{is less likely to}} knock than a fuel with a lower value. However, engine and fuel technology has evolved since 1928, and thus the relevancy of these tests for modem engines needed to be evaluated. First, the study compared knock onset, knock metrics, reference fuels, and test conditions for the octane tests to those in modem engines. The results showed that in modem engines, for a given RON, fuels with lower MON values performed better than fuels with higher values, and this trend becomes stronger when engines are boosted and intercooled. Second, detailed chemical kinetics models were used to study fuel autoignition phenomena leading to knocking conditions. These models showed that the fuel autoignition chemistry in modem engine is different from that in the RON and MON tests. Based on these results, it was concluded that the RON and MON tests no longer represent modem engine operating conditions; therefore, modifications are suggested and evaluated to improve the tests' applicability. by Vikram Mittal.

A correlation between the OI and the ignition delay time at the initial charge temperature enabled the OI of non-PRFs to be predicted at specified temperatures. The methodology was validated using ignition delay times for toluene primary reference fuels (ternary mixtures of toluene, iso-octane, and n-heptane), fuels for advanced combustion engines (FACE) gasolines, and certification gasolines.

Experimental and modelling {{studies have been conducted}} in this work to assess autoignition characteristics of naphtha for use in advanced engines. Ignition delay times of a certified straight-run naphtha fuel, supplied by Haltermann Solutions, were measured in a shock tube and a rapid comparison machine over wide ranges of experimental conditions (20 and 60  bar, 620 – 1223  K, ϕ =  0. 5, 1 and 2). The Haltermann straight-run naphtha (HSRN) has research octane number (RON) of 60 and <b>motor</b> <b>octane</b> <b>number</b> (<b>MON)</b> of 58. 3, with carbon range spanning C 3 –C 9.

All surrogates reasonably captured the ignition delays of HSRN at high and intermediate temperatures. However, at low temperatures (T <  750  K), the six-component surrogate performed the best in emulating the reactivity of naphtha fuel. Temperature sensitivity and rate of production analyses revealed that the presence of cyclo-alkanes in naphtha inhibits the overall fuel reactivity.

40|$|Predicting octane numbers (ON) of {{gasoline}} surrogate mixtures is of significant {{importance to the}} optimization and development of internal combustion (IC) engines. Most ON predictive tools utilize blending rules wherein measured octane numbers are fitted using linear or non-linear mixture fractions on a volumetric or molar basis. In this work, the octane numbers of various binary and ternary n-heptane/iso-octane/toluene blends, referred to as toluene primary reference fuel (TPRF) mixtures, are correlated with a fundamental chemical kinetic parameter, specifically, homogeneous gas-phase fuel/air ignition delay time. Ignition delay times for stoichiometric fuel/air mixtures are calculated at various constant volume conditions (835 K and 20 atm, 825 K and 25 atm, 850 K and 50 atm (research octane number RON-like) and 980 K and 45 atm (motor octane number MON-like)), and for variable volume profiles calculated from cooperative fuel research (CFR) engine pressure and temperature simulations. Compression ratio (or ON) dependent variable volume profile ignition delay times are investigated as well. The constant volume RON-like ignition delay times correlation with RON was the best amongst the other studied conditions. The variable volume ignition delay times condition correlates better with MON than the ignition delay times at the other tested conditions. The best correlation is achieved when using compression ratio dependent variable volume profiles to calculate the ignition delay times.

40|$|AbstractThe {{combustion}} {{performance of}} gasoline engines {{has traditionally been}} measured using Research Octane Number (RON) and <b>Motor</b> <b>Octane</b> <b>Number</b> (<b>MON)</b> which describe antiknock performance under different conditions. Recent literature suggests that MON {{is less important than}} RON in modern cars and a relaxation in the MON specification could improve vehicle performance, while also helping refiners in the production of gasoline. At the same time, for the same octane number change, increasing RON appears to provide more benefit to engine power and acceleration than reducing MON. It has also been suggested that there could be fuel efficiency benefits (on a tank to wheels basis) for specially adapted engines, for example, operating at higher compression ratio, on very high RON (100 +). Other workers have advocated the use of an octane index (OI) which incorporates both RON and MON to give an indication of octane quality. The objective {{of this study was to}} investigate the effect of RON and MON on the power and acceleration performance of modern gasoline vehicles under full throttle acceleration conditions. Tests were carried out using two Euro 4 vehicles. Fuels covering RON levels from 95 to 103 and sensitivities (RON minus MON) of up to 15 were blended. Both pure hydrocarbon and blends containing ethanol or ETBE were included so that specific effects of oxygenates could be identified. The results confirmed the findings of other studies that MON is not a good predictor of vehicle performance and in fact high MON levels increase acceleration time under full throttle conditions. In addition to performance testing, emissions testing was also carried out. Carbon balance was used to calculate energy consumption during the acceleration tests and NEDC tests...|$|E
40|$|The {{results of}} {{previous}} experimental researches showed that great advantages can be achieved, {{both in terms}} of fuel consumption and pollutant emissions, in bifuel vehicles by means of the double-fuel combustion, i. e., the simultaneous combustion of gasoline and a gaseous fuel, such as liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) or natural gas (NG). The substantial increase in knock resistance pursued by adding LPG to gasoline, which allowed to maintain an overall stoichiometric proportion with air also at full load, is not documented in the scientific literature and induced the authors to perform a proper experimental campaign. The <b>motor</b> <b>octane</b> <b>number</b> (<b>MON)</b> of LPG–gasoline mixtures has been hence determined on a standard cooperative fuel research (CFR) engine, equipped with a double-fuel injection system in order to realize different proportions between the two fuels and electronically control the overall air–fuels mixture. The results of the measurement show a quadratic dependence of the MON of the mixture as function of the LPG concentration evaluated on a mass basis, with higher increase for the lower LPG content. A good linear relation, instead, has been determined {{on the basis of the}} evaluated LPG molar fraction. The simultaneous combustion of LPG and gasoline may become a third operative mode of bifuel vehicles, allowing to optimize fuel economy, performances, and pollutant emissions; turbocharged bifuel engines could strongly take advantage of the knock resistance of the fuels mixture thus adopting high compression ratio (CR) both in pure gas and double-fuel mode, hence maximizing performance and reducing engine size. The two correlations determined in this work, hence, can be useful for the design of future bifuel engines running with knock safe simultaneous combustion of LPG and gasoline...|$|E
40|$|The octane {{responses}} of gasoline/ethanol mixtures {{are not well}} understood because of the unidentified intermolecular interactions in such blends. In general, when ethanol is blended with gasoline, the Research Octane Number (RON) and the <b>Motor</b> <b>Octane</b> <b>Number</b> (<b>MON)</b> non-linearly increase or decrease, and the non-linearity {{is determined by the}} composition of the base gasoline and the amount of added ethanol. The complexity of commercial gasolines, comprising of hundreds of different components, makes it challenging to understand ethanol-gasoline synergistic/antagonistic blending effects. Understanding ethanol blending effects with simpler gasoline surrogates is critical to acquire knowledge about ethanol blending with complex multi-component gasoline fuels. In this study, the octane numbers (ON) of ethanol blends with five relevant gasoline surrogate molecules were measured. The molecules investigated in this study include: n-pentane, iso-pentane, 1, 2, 4 -trimethylbenzene, cyclopentane and 1 -hexene. These new measurements along with the available data of n-heptane, iso-octane, toluene, various primary reference fuels (PRF) and toluene primary reference fuels (TPRF) with ethanol are used to develop a blending rule for the octane response (RON and MON) of multi-component blends with ethanol. In addition, new ON data are collected for six Fuels for Advanced Combustion Engine (FACE) with ethanol. The relatively simple volume based model successfully predicts the octane numbers (ON) of the various ethanol/PRF and ethanol/TPRF blends with the majority of predictions being within the ASTM D 2699 (RON) and D 2700 (MON) reproducibility limits.

Bi-fuel engines represent a transition phase product, allowing to run either with gasoline or with gas, {{and for this reason}} are equipped with two separate injection systems. When operating at high loads with gasoline, however, these engines require rich mixtures and retarded combustions in order to prevent from dangerous knocking phenomena: this causes high hydrocarbon (HC) and carbon monoxide (CO) emissions together with high fuel consumption. With the aim to exploit the high knock resistance of NG maintaining the good performances of gasoline, the authors experienced, in a previous work [1], the simultaneous combustion of NG-gasoline mixtures on a series production Spark Ignition (SI) engine, obtaining, with respect to pure gasoline operation, strong reduction in pollutant emissions, noticeable efficiency increase and no significant power losses. In order to ascertain the knock resistance increase due to the addition of natural gas to gasoline, and given the total absence of such information in the scientific literature, the authors decided to carry out a dedicated experimental campaign: a standard Cooperative Fuel Research (CFR) engine, properly upgraded to inject both fuels in the intake duct, has been employed to determine the <b>Motor</b> <b>Octane</b> <b>Number</b> (<b>MON)</b> of several fuel mixtures following the ASTM Standard D 2700.

Gasoline, on the other hand, being injected as liquid, maintains higher volumetric efficiency and hence higher power output. As a compromise solution, it could be desired to exploit the advantages of both gasoline and gas (NG or LPG), thus performing a Double- Fuel injection: as already experimented by the authors [1, 2], the addition of gaseous fuel to the gasoline/air mixture increases knocking resistance, allowing to run the engine with both “overall stoichiometric” mixture (thus lowering fuel consumption and emissions) and better spark advance (which increases engine efficiency) even at full load: the results showed high improvements in engine efficiency without noticeable power losses respect to the pure gasoline operation. Since no references {{have been found in}} literature on the Octane Number of both NG-gasoline and LPGgasoline blends, the authors decided to experimentally determine the knock resistance increase due to gaseous fuel addition to normal air-gasoline mixtures. A wide experimental campaign has been carried out in order to evaluate the correlation between the gaseous fuel-gasoline mixture composition and its overall knock resistance measured in terms of <b>Motor</b> <b>Octane</b> <b>Number</b> (<b>MON).</b> To this purpose, a CFR engine was endowed with two independent injection systems in order to realize mixtures with different proportion between gaseous fuels and gasoline and control the overall air-fuel ratio. The experimental results presented in this paper are quite innovative and will be fundamental for future study on the simultaneous combustion of gaseous fuel and gasoline. The experimental results showed that the relationship between the mixture MON and gaseous fuel concentration in the blend is not linear and is quite different between NG-gasoline and LPG-gasoline blends...|$|E
40|$|Gasoline {{octane number}} is a {{significant}} empirical parameter for the optimization and development of internal combustion engines capable of resisting knock. Although extensive databases and blending rules to estimate the octane numbers of mixtures have been developed {{and the effects of}} molecular structure on autoignition properties are somewhat understood, a comprehensive theoretical chemistry-based foundation for blending effects of fuels on engine operations is still to be developed. In this study, we present models that correlate the research octane number (RON) and <b>motor</b> <b>octane</b> <b>number</b> (<b>MON)</b> with simulated homogeneous gas-phase ignition delay times of stoichiometric fuel/air mixtures. These correlations attempt {{to bridge the gap between}} the fundamental autoignition behavior of the fuel (e. g., its chemistry and how reactivity changes with temperature and pressure) and engine properties such as its knocking behavior in a cooperative fuels research (CFR) engine. The study encompasses a total of 79 hydrocarbon gasoline surrogate mixtures including 11 primary reference fuels (PRF), 43 toluene primary reference fuels (TPRF), and 19 multicomponent (MC) surrogate mixtures. In addition to TPRF mixture components of iso-octane/n-heptane/toluene, MC mixtures, including n-heptane, iso-octane, toluene, 1 -hexene, and 1, 2, 4 -trimethylbenzene, were blended and tested to mimic real gasoline sensitivity. ASTM testing protocols D- 2699 and D- 2700 were used to measure the RON and MON of the MC mixtures in a CFR engine, while the PRF and TPRF mixtures’ octane ratings were obtained from the literature. The mixtures cover a RON range of 0 – 100, with the majority being in the 70 – 100 range. A parametric simulation study across a temperature range of 650 – 950 K and pressure range of 15 – 50 bar was carried out in a constant-volume homogeneous batch reactor to calculate chemical kinetic ignition delay times. Regression tools were utilized to find the conditions at which RON and MON best correlate with simulated ignition delay times. Furthermore, temperature and pressure dependences were investigated for fuels with varying octane sensitivity. This analysis led to the formulation of correlations useful to the definition of surrogates for modeling purposes and allowed one to identify conditions for a more in-depth understanding of the chemical phenomena controlling the antiknock behavior of the fuels...|$|E
50|$|The FAA found Swift Fuel {{to have a}} <b>motor</b> <b>octane</b> <b>number</b> of 104.4, 96.3% of {{the energy}} per unit of mass, and 113% of the energy per unit of volume as 100LL, and meets most of the ASTM D910 {{standard}} for leaded aviation fuel. Following tests in two Lycoming engines, the FAA concluded it performs better than 100LL in detonation testing and will provide a fuel savings of 8% per unit of volume, though it weighs 1 pound per gallon (120 g/l) more than 100LL. GC-FID testing showed the fuel to be made primarily of two components — one about 85% by weight and the other about 14% by weight. Soon afterward, AVweb reported that Continental had begun the process of certifying several of its engines {{to use the new}} fuel.|$|R
40|$|High energy prices, {{environmental}} issues and increasing importation of fossil fuels has provoked, in some countries, a reorientation of resources towards the development of biofuels that can partially substitute the consumption of fossil fuels. Ethanol {{is one of the}} biofuels more commonly used in the world; in the United States, Brazil and Australia gasoline blends that reach up to 85 % Ethanol are commercialized. This work presents the results of a physicochemical characterization of commercial Mexican gasoline (Magna and Premium) and diesel blends with 10 % vol. and 15 % vol. anhydrous Ethanol. The analytical testing included: Research <b>Octane</b> <b>Number,</b> <b>Motor</b> <b>Octane</b> <b>Number,</b> Cetane Number, Reid Vapor Pressure, Distillation Curve and Heating Value. The stability of the blends was also evaluated. The theoretical emissions of CO 2 were calculated {{based on the results of}} the physicochemical characterization. The ethanol-gasoline blends increased their <b>Octane</b> <b>Number</b> with respect to the commercial gasoline, while conserving an appropriate Distillation Index. The Cetane Number of the ethanol-diesel blends showed a substantial decrease, while the heating value of gasoline and diesel blends was negatively affected by the addition of ethanol. Nevertheless, taking into account the credits by the use of a renewable fuel, the use of the reformulated gasoline blends would imply a maximum theoretical reduction of 7. 5 % in CO 2 emissions whereas in the case of ethanol-diesel blends it would represent a 9. 2 % decrease...|$|R
40|$|The {{feasibility}} of rating the <b>octane</b> <b>number</b> of gasoline using near infrared (NIR) spectroscopy and three different genetic algorithm-based multivariate calibration methods was demonstrated. The three genetic multivariate calibration methods are genetic regression (GR), genetic classical least squares (GCLS), and genetic inverse least squares (GILS). The sample data set {{was obtained from}} the ftp address (ftp://ftp. clarkson. edu/pub/hopkepk/Chemdata/) with the permission of Professor. J. H. Kalivas. This data set contains the NIR spectra of 60 gasoline samples collected using diffuse reflectance as log (I / R) with known <b>octane</b> <b>numbers</b> and covers the range from 900 to 1700 nm in 2 nm intervals. Of these 60 spectra, 20 were used as the calibration set, 20 were used as the prediction set, and 20 were reserved for the validation purposes. Several calibration models were built with the three genetic algorithm-based methods, and the results were compared with the partial least squares (PLS) prediction errors reported in the literature. Overall, the standard error of calibration (SEC), standard error of prediction (SEP), and standard error of validation (SEV) values were in the range of 0. 15 - 0. 32 (in the units of <b>motor</b> <b>octane</b> <b>number)</b> for the GR and GILS, which are comparable with the literature. However, GCLS produced relatively large results (0. 36 for SEC, 0. 39 for SEP and 0. 52 for SEV) when compared with the other two methods...|$|R
