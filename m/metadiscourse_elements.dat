40|$|The study {{explores the}} interplay of EFL/ESL writers’ {{composing}} processes and features of their written products, specifically revising and use of <b>metadiscourse</b> <b>elements.</b> Both are crucial to success in writing but have {{so far not been}} researched from this perspective. A corpus of 104 essays, draft versions and corresponding final versions written by 52 advanced EFL/ESL writers, was analysed manually and electronically to show the use of <b>metadiscourse</b> <b>elements</b> and the revisions made in the process of writing. The two sets of data were then analysed statistically to uncover potential correlations. While there was variation in the quantities of both <b>metadiscourse</b> <b>elements</b> and text revisions, patterns emerged in both areas. Increased density of metadiscourse correlated positively with the number of major content revisions, but not with the number of minor content revisions and surface revisions. Content analysis found that <b>metadiscourse</b> <b>elements</b> were often integral parts of added chunks of text, but also served to modify or restructure existing text. Results suggest that while metadiscourse depends on genre and topic, it also plays {{a significant role in the}} process of text composing. The growth of its density as writers revise texts at the level of content and structure indicates that metadiscourse can function as a reconceptualizing tool in the process of writing...|$|E
40|$|This {{study on}} {{contrastive}} rhetoric reports on metadiscourse functions in sociology articles in Persian and English. The results have revealed {{a higher number}} of <b>metadiscourse</b> <b>elements</b> in the English texts. Among the different <b>metadiscourse</b> <b>elements</b> used, text connectors are the most frequently employed in both languages. Modality markers are the second most frequent in both languages although the English writers used nearly {{twice the number of}} these markers. Overall, it is found that the frequency of textual metadiscourse markers is greater than the interpersonal markers in both language samples. It was further revealed that the Persian writers of sociology texts are less interested in explicitly orienting the readers and some of the main points in an article, especially in the concluding section, are left for the readers to infer. This, we believe, is the result of less reliance on academic writing in the educational system of the country. Instead, the Iranians are largely encouraged to employ a flowery language and rhetoric to decorate their writing in their school years which makes them less attentive of their readers. <br /...|$|E

40|$|Taking the Michigan Corpus of Academic Spoken English, {{this paper}} explores the pragmatic {{behavior}} of one-word tags – a common feature in conversational English – in academic speech. The analysis indicates that university professors use tags within textual metadiscourse patterns to signpost their audiences and facilitate comprehension. In addition, tags correlate with interpersonal <b>metadiscourse</b> <b>elements</b> typical of conversation that help lecturers adopt stances, convey solidarity and socialize with their undergraduates. The conclusion section relates the interpersonal semiotics of lectures to the communicative goals of university talk and suggests {{the need to}} approach listening comprehension through students ’ awareness of genres as social actions. Key-words: genre analysis, sociorhetoric, metadiscourse, listening comprehension...|$|E
40|$|This study {{investigated}} {{whether or not}} male and female writers of academic research articles were different {{in the use of}} interpersonal resources in English. In order to carry out the study, 32 applied linguistics research articles with the standard macrostructure of empirical research articles (Introduction, Method, Results, and Discussion/Conclusion) were selected from amongst the highest ranked journals. The results of the current study indicated that, with respect to both interactive and interactional features, there were no significant gender-based differences in the overall distribution of interpersonal resources in the four sections of the articles (p-value> 0. 05). It also confirmed the view that writing differences are not gender-specific, but rather section-specific. In this line, identification of male and female EFL learners’ use of <b>metadiscourse</b> <b>elements</b> will provide guidelines to EFL teachers to tailor their teaching methods and avoid mismatches between classroom practices and learners’ language use...|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} was carried out to compare the use of {{metadiscourse}} textual resources (MTRs) in terms of frequency and categorical distribution in an original novel and its simplified counterpart (i. e., Oliver Twist). The researchers were interested to understand how writers of original and simplified novels made use of <b>metadiscourse</b> <b>elements</b> and whether original and simplified novels differed {{in the use of}} these resources. The corpus used in this study was analyzed based on Hyland and Tse’s (2004) model. The frequency and categorical distribution of MTRs was calculated per 1, 000 words and the difference in their distribution across original novels and their simplified versions was checked using the statistical analysis technique of Chi-Square. The findings indicated that there was not {{a significant difference in the}} frequency and categorical distribution of MTRs between the original and simplified versions of Oliver Twist, implying that the writers of both original and simplified novels strived to provide a coherent text...|$|E
40|$|Abstracts {{form the}} first reading contact of {{extended}} discourse {{in pursuance of}} a meaningful engagement with a report. An abstract possesses distinct features drawn from a specific genre of academic writing that communicates its discourse intent to any academic or professional community. Among the discourse conventions {{is the use of}} a move pattern and <b>metadiscourse</b> <b>elements</b> which together, establishes logical connections with the reader. This paper investigates good communication practice in abstract writing, a significant preliminary that fronts a report. The effectiveness of an abstract specifically, can be tied to the realization of a peculiar move structure that is accompanied by a judicious choice of words and phrases that relates to and involves the reader both interactively and interactionally. A content analysis of the move structure and its underlying metadiscourse in 100 randomly selected abstracts gives petite indication of how students manage abstract writing in a technical report. The results will have a bearing on situating appropriate pedagogical approaches for the teaching of a salient feature in academic writing and will also inform students of related genre expectations towards abstract writing. It is a skill that they may not have sufficient contact with in their university writing experience, though, nonetheless, one that needs to be accomplished to fulfill communicative intent that serves both local and international purposes insofar as academic writing is concerned...|$|E
40|$|This study investigates {{metadiscourse}} in the dissertation abstracts {{written by}} Native Speakers of Turkish (NST), Turkish Speakers of English (TSE) and Native Speakers of English (NSE) in the Social Sciences {{to determine how}} they make use of metadiscourse devices. It attempts to determine whether student writers from a shared cultural background (Turkish) tend to use similar rhetorical features to those of their mother tongue or harmonise themselves with the language (English) {{in which they are}} writing. Metadiscourse as a rhetorical device for the effective use of language facilitates writers in guiding their readers, conveying their ideas, establishing and determining the social distance of the reader-writer relationship, and creating an involved style of writer persona or a more remote stance. In that sense, interactive resources employed by writers help readers to find the information needed and interactional resources convey to readers the personality of the writers and their assertions. In addition, using ‘more personal’ resources is a way of keeping readers more intentionally within the text to interpret what is proposed by the writers personally and to judge them. The overall aim of the study is to compare and contrast 90 abstracts of dissertations produced by native Turkish speakers (30), native English speakers (30) and Turkish speakers of English (30) in the Social Sciences and to consider how writing in English (L 2) deviates from writing in Turkish (L 1) and becomes closer to the target language in terms of the <b>metadiscourse</b> <b>elements,</b> that is, interactive resources (transitions, frame markers, endophoric markers, evidentials and code glosses) and interactional resources (hedges, boosters, attitude markers, engagement markers and self-mentions). ...|$|E
