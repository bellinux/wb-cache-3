30|$|Since {{we are in}} the {{evaluation}} phase of our project, we do not yet have a dense network deployed. However, the major auroral event of April 5, 2010 (Connors et al., 2011) had large signals detected in western Canada, including at the NPM site at Grande Prairie, Alberta. The STEP Polar Network site at Fort St. John, British Columbia, is 166 km NW of Grande Prairie (see Fig. 9) and houses a standard Narod fluxgate magnetometer. Compared to most other existing site pairs, these sites are relatively close together and suited to investigating whether closely spaced sites are useful during an auroral event. A comparison of the differences in observed signals during this large event is best based on cross-calibration during the event itself. An auroral camera was operating at Athabasca (AUGO observatory, equivalent to the <b>magnetic</b> <b>station</b> ATH) during the event with FSJ and GPR {{on the edge of the}} field of view.

30|$|We {{examined}} short-term geomagnetic changes {{related with}} the 2003 Tokachi-oki earthquake (M 8.0) and the 2004 Kushiro-oki earthquake (M 7.1) in Hokkaido, Japan. However, {{we could not}} find the precursory and co-seismic signals above several nT at a <b>magnetic</b> <b>station</b> whose epicentral distances were about 120 km and 50 km, respectively. Model calculations showed that co-seismic piezomagnetic fields did not amount to 1 nT at the station in both cases when we assumed the relevant fault parameters, in-situ Curie temperature depth, subsurface magnetic structure and stress sensitivity of rocks. Therefore, it may be reasonable that we could not detect the piezomagnetic signals at the station. We also made model calculations to forecast the piezomagnetic amplitudes caused by M 7.9 and M 8.5 earthquakes which have been expected to occur along the southern Kurile trench in the future. The model calculations reveal the piezomagnetic fields up to about − 4 nT and − 7 nT are expected {{in the eastern part of}} the Hokkaido island for the M 7.9 and M 8.5 earthquakes respectively, encouraging magnetic observations hereafter.|$|E

At first, the variation with time of local geomagnetic activity is determined at each <b>magnetic</b> <b>station.</b> Gathering all obtained stations' precomputed values, a normalization with corrected geomagnetic latitude is determined. Then, for each 15 min interval, magnetic activity on the horizontal component is averaged out over 15 min and corrected using this normalization, before a spline modeling of the longitudinal variation in each hemisphere is applied. Hemispheric and planetary 15 min indices are then computed by arithmetic means. Preliminary statistical results, from probability distribution function over a solar cycle and superposed epoch analysis during storms conditions, show, by comparison with am geomagnetic index series, that new α 15 indices are reliable in describing subauroral magnetic activity. These new indices will suit any future user, allowing either to choose the spatial description (planetary versus hemispheric) and/or to choose the temporal resolution, knowing unambiguously all their strengths and caveats...|$|E

To a certain extent MA indicator is an analog of traditional K index. However, a well-known shortcoming of the latter is its long, 3 -hour update rate. Moreover, K index calculation requires subtraction of Sq variation that also causes delays. At the same time there is a demand for operational geomagnetic indices that have maximal time resolution and are available in near real-time. The proposed MA indicator aims to address the shortcomings of the traditional K index. The MA calculation may be implemented automatically with the same time resolution as the initial data are recorded...|$|E

Since emissions at 427.8  nm are only sensitive to energetic electron precipitation, these two wavelengths can be used to distinguish auroral and airglow emissions.

In contrast to the SR, which has global nature and which is continuously observable at any time of the day, IAR signals are registered mostly during the nighttime and demonstrate more variability of the parameters than SR signals.

The Polish geomagnetic observatory Arctowski, located on King George Island, served as a reference station, {{and changes in the}} differences between the daily mean values at both stations were interpreted as indicators of volcanomagnetic effects at Deception. A <b>magnetic</b> <b>station</b> in continuous recording mode was also installed during the 1993 - 1994 and 1994 - 1995 surveys.

The results from the first survey suggest that a small magma injection, responsible for the seismic re-activation, could produce a volcanomagnetic effect, detected as a slight change in the difference between Deception and Arctowski. On the other hand, a long term variation starting at that moment seems to indicate a thermomagnetic effect. However the short register period of only two stations do not allow the sources to be modelled.

At the <b>magnetic</b> <b>station</b> São Luís (2. 3 ° S, 44 ° W, dip angle – 0. 5 °) the occurrence of the F 3 layer is much less evident than at the low latitude station Fortaleza (4 ° S, 38 ° W, dip angle – 9 °). The ionograms recorded at Fortaleza in 1995 show the existence of the layer on 50 % of the days, with the occurrence being more frequent (75 %) and distinct in summer. The layer appears on 66 % of the days in winter and 28 % in equinoxes. The layer starts to appear around 0930 LT and lasts from a few minutes to several hours. Its mean height varies from 570 km in summer to 440 km in winter, although on a day to day basis it can vary from as low as 375 km to 775 km. The ionospheric model SUPIM (Sheffield University Plasmasphere-Ionosphere Model) explains well the occurrence of the layer in summer, but not in winter, unless some key input parameters, such as electric field and winds are modified.

40|$|The complex {{magnetic}}-pulsation event near magnetic shell L = 4. 5 at 1830 - 1930 UT on July 14, 1982, {{is characterized}} {{on the basis}} of observations obtained by the DE- 1 satellite near the equator and by <b>magnetic</b> <b>stations</b> at Siple, Antarctica, and Roberval, Quebec, Canada, at opposite ends of the L = 4. 2 field line. The data are presented graphically and discussed in the light of theoretical models. The main features (in sequence) observed were a brief 120 -sec compressional pulsation, a 5 -nT 180 -sec transverse pulsation, a weak 44 -sec transverse pulsation, and a rapidly developing 240 -sec azimuthal pulsation. The 180 -sec and 240 -sec pulsations are found to be large-scale toroidal oscillations on one and two resonant shells, respectively, while the 44 -sec pulsation appears to be more localized...|$|R
40|$|The {{invention}} {{includes an}} angular momentum control device (AMCD) having a rim and several <b>magnetic</b> bearing <b>stations.</b> The AMCD is in a strapped down {{position on a}} spacecraft. Each <b>magnetic</b> bearing <b>station</b> comprises means, including an axial position sensor, for controlling {{the position of the}} rim in the axial direction; and means, including a radial position sensor, for controlling the position of the rim in the radial direction. A first computer receives the signals from all the axial position sensors and computes the angular rates about first and second mutually perpendicular axes in the plane of the rim and computes the linear acceleration along a third axis perpendicular to the first and second axes. A second computer receives the signals from all the radial position sensors and computes the linear accelerations along the first and second axes...|$|R
