40|$|The {{transition}} energy from galactic to extragalactic cosmic ray sources is still uncertain, {{but it should}} be associated either with the region of the spectrum known as the second knee or with the ankle. The baseline design of the Pierre Auger Observatory was optimized for the highest energies. The surface array is fully efficient above 3 × 10 ^ 18 eV and, even if the hybrid mode can extend this range below 10 ^ 18 eV, the second knee and a considerable portion of the wide ankle structure are left outside its operating range. Therefore, in order to encompass these spectral features and gain further insight into the cosmic ray composition variation along the transition region, enhancements to the surface and fluorescence components of the baseline design are being implemented that will lower the full efficiency regime of the Observatory down to ∼ 10 ^ 17 eV. The surface enhancements consist of a graded infilled area of standard Auger water Cherenkov detectors deployed in two triangular grids of 433 m and 750 m of spacing.

The paper presents the Front-End Board (FEB) with the biggest Cyclone V E FPGA 5 CEFA 9 F 31 I 7 N, supporting 8 channels sampled with max. 250 MSps @ 14 -bit resolution. Considered sampling for the SD is 120 MSps, however, the FEB has been developed with external anti-aliasing filters to keep a maximal flexibility. Six channels are targeted to the SD, two the rest for other experiments like: Auger Engineering Radio Array and additional <b>muon</b> <b>counters.</b> The FEB is an intermediate design pluged-in the actually used Unified Board communicating with micro-controller at 40 MHz, however providing even 250 MSPs sampling with 20 -bit dynamic range, equipped in a virtual NIOS processor and supporting 256 MB of SDRAM {{as well as with}} an implemented spectral trigger based on the Discrete Cosine Transform for a detection of very inclined "old" showers. The FEB can also support a neural network developing for a detection of "young" showers, potentially generated by neutrinos.
