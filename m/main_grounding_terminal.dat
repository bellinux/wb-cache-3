40|$|International (IEC) European (CENELEC) and American (NEC) Standards require, in each building, the {{connection}} of extraneous conductive parts (i. e. metal water or gas pipes) to the <b>main</b> <b>grounding</b> <b>terminal.</b> There are two good reasons for this: the voltage between extraneous conductive parts and exposed conductive parts is zeroed and extraneous conductive parts {{can contribute to the}} leakage of fault current into the ground. There is however a third advantage in the bonding connection: the entire structure (floors and walls of the building), together with the exposed and the extraneous metallic parts, forms a quasi-equipotential system, with the consequent strong reduction of touch voltages. Metallic pipes and reinforcement of reinforced concrete have a particular relevance thanks to their large widespread through buildings. However, in some practical cases, {{it is not possible to}} connect all extraneous conductive parts to the protective equipotential bonding because they are not accessible. In the paper, the reduction of touch voltages in buildings, when these extraneous conductive parts are present but not connected to the protective equipotential bonding is quantified. Different building models are created and solved by the finite element method in order to calculate touch voltages in different scenarios. The results show that the mere presence of widespread metallic parts in buildings helps to reduce touch voltages, but not enough to ensure safety against indirect contacts. The electrical installation safety performance is greatly improved in reinforced concrete buildings if at least some easily accessible parts, like water or central heating pipes, are connected to the <b>main</b> <b>grounding</b> <b>terminal.</b> Also in brick buildings, they provide a certain reduction of GPR, maximum and mean touch voltages...|$|E

The TDRSS spacecraft were conceived in the mid- 1960 s by NASA {{as a means of}} using GEO-positioned satellites to eliminate existing <b>ground</b> stations. The <b>main</b> <b>ground</b> <b>terminal</b> becomes Goddard Space Flight Center, through which users other than the Shuttle can also gain access. The TDRSS functions as a relay vehicle, with very little on-board processing except for status reports inserted into the data stream. Use of the TDRSS system by nonNASA agencies currently costs $ 110 /min for forwards, return, and tracking, $ 24 /min for forward service alone, and $ 8 /min for return service only. The spacecraft can store data on board and dump it to the ground station during the limited hours of operation...|$|R

All radioed commands and received telemetry that go to and from the tracking and data relay satellites go by way of these terminals at the White Sands Complex.

40|$|The Systems Integration, Test, and Evaluation (SITE) {{facility}} at NASA Lewis Research Center is presently configured as a satellite-switched time {{division multiple access}} (SS-TDMA) network simulator. The purpose of SITE is to demonstrate and evaluate advanced communication satellite technologies, presently embodied by POC components developed under NASA contracts {{in addition to other}} hardware, such as <b>ground</b> <b>terminals,</b> designed and built in-house at NASA Lewis. Each <b>ground</b> <b>terminal</b> in a satellite communications system will experience a different aspect of the satellite's motion due mainly to daily tidal effects and station keeping, hence a different duration and rate of variation in the range delay. As a result of this and other effects such as local oscillator instability, each <b>ground</b> <b>terminal</b> must constantly adjust its transmit burst timing so that data bursts from separate <b>ground</b> <b>terminals</b> arrive at the satellite in their assigned time slots, preventing overlap and keeping the system in synchronism. On the receiving end, <b>ground</b> <b>terminals</b> must synchronize their local clocks using reference transmissions received through the satellite link. A feature of the SITE facility is its capability to simulate the varying propagation delays and associated Doppler frequency shifts that the <b>ground</b> <b>terminals</b> in the network have to cope with.

40|$|A burst {{compression}} and expansion technique is described for asynchronously interconnecting variable-data-rate users with cost-efficient <b>ground</b> <b>terminals</b> in a satellite-switched, time-division-multiple-access (SS/TDMA) network. Compression and expansion buffers in each <b>ground</b> <b>terminal</b> convert between lower rate, asynchronous, continuous-user data streams and higher-rate TDMA bursts synchronized with the satellite-switched timing. The technique described uses a first-in, first-out (FIFO) memory approach which enables {{the use of}} inexpensive clock sources by both the users and the <b>ground</b> <b>terminals</b> and obviates the need for elaborate user clock synchronization processes. A continuous range of data rates from kilobits per second to that approaching the modulator burst rate (hundreds of megabits per second) can be accommodated. The technique was developed for use in the NASA Lewis Research Center System Integration, Test, and Evaluation (SITE) facility.

40|$|With {{the advent}} of life {{critical}} and real-time services such as remote operations over satellite, e-health etc, providing the guaranteed minimum level of services at every <b>ground</b> <b>terminal</b> of the satellite communication system has gained utmost priority. <b>Ground</b> <b>terminals</b> and the hub are not equipped with the required intelligence to predict and react to inclement and dynamic weather conditions on its own. The focus of this thesis is to develop intelligent algorithms that would aid in adaptive management {{of the quality of}} service at the <b>ground</b> <b>terminal</b> and the gateway level. This is done to adapt both the <b>ground</b> <b>terminal</b> and gateway to changing weather conditions and to attempt to maintain a steady throughput level and Quality of Service (QoS) requirements on queue delay, jitter, and probability of loss of packets. The existing satellite system employs the First-In-First-Out routing algorithm to control congestion in their networks. This mechanism is not equipped with adequate ability to contend with changing link capacities, a common result due to bad weather and faults and to provide different levels of prioritized service to the customers that satisfies QoS requirements. This research proposes to use the reported strength of fuzzy logic in controlling highly non-linear and complex system such as the satellite communication network.

40|$|Communication and {{information}} exchange play a decisive role in progress and social development. However, {{in many parts}} of the world the communication infrastructure is inadequate and the capacity for on-line exchange of information may not exist. This is true of underdeveloped countries, remote and relatively inaccessible regions, sites of natural disasters, and of all cases where the resources needed to create complex communication systems are limited. The creation of an inexpensive space communications system to service such areas is therefore a high priority task. In addition to a relatively low-cost space segment, an inexpensive space communications systems requires a large number of <b>ground</b> <b>terminals,</b> which must be relatively inexpensive, energy efficient (using power generated by storage batteries, or solar arrays, etc.), small in size, and must not require highly expert maintenance. The <b>ground</b> <b>terminals</b> must be portable, and readily deployable. Communications satellites in geostationary orbit at altitudes of about 36, 000 km are very expensive and require complex and expensive ground stations and launch vehicles. Given current technology, it is categorically impossible to develop inexpensive satellite systems with portable <b>ground</b> <b>terminals</b> using such satellites. To solve the problem of developing an inexpensive satellite communications system that can operate with relatively small ground stations, including portable terminals, we propose to use a system with satellites in low Earth orbit, at an altitude of 900 - 1500 km. Because low orbital satellites are much closer to the Earth than geostationary ones and require vastly less energy expenditure by the satellite and <b>ground</b> <b>terminals</b> for transmission of messages, a system using them is relatively inexpensive. Such a system could use portable <b>ground</b> <b>terminals</b> no more complex than ordinary mobile police radios...|$|R
