40|$|Objective <b>Medical</b> writing <b>assistance</b> {{may improve}} {{manuscript}} quality and timeliness. Good Publication Practice Guidelines for pharmaceutical companies encourage authors to acknowledge <b>medical</b> writing <b>assistance.</b> The objectives {{of this study}} were to determine the proportion of articles from international, high-ranking, peer-reviewed journals that declared <b>medical</b> writing <b>assistance</b> and to explore the association between pharmaceutical sponsorship and <b>medical</b> writing <b>assistance</b> in terms of time to manuscript acceptance. Design The acknowledgment sections of 1000 original research articles were reviewed. The sample comprised 100 consecutive articles published up to January 2005 from each of 10 high-ranking (impact factor–based), international, peer-reviewed medical journals from different therapeutic areas. The proportion of articles declaring pharmaceutical sponsorship and <b>medical</b> writing <b>assistance,</b> and the time interval between manuscript submission and acceptance were calculated. Analysis of variance was used to explore associations between sponsorship, writing assistance, and manuscript acceptance time. Results <b>Medical</b> writing <b>assistance</b> was declared in only 6 % of publications (n = 60). In the pharmaceutical-sponsored studies subset (n = 102 articles), assistance was declared in 10 articles (10 %). Disclosure of <b>medical</b> writing <b>assistance</b> was associated with reduced time to acceptance (declared assistance: geometric mean, 83. 6 days; vs no declaration: geometric mean, 132. 2 days; relative difference, 0. 63; 95 % confidence interval, 0. 40 - 1. 01; P =. 053). Conclusions Based on this 1000 -article sample, the reported use of <b>medical</b> writing <b>assistance</b> appears low (6 %). If used, <b>medical</b> writing <b>assistance</b> should be declared. For pharmaceutical-sponsored studies, the time to publication may be faster when medical writers are used...|$|R

5|$|The {{family moved}} to Osawatomie, Kansas, in 1859, but the {{frontier}} violence caused them to move to Missouri in 1860. Eventually, Daniel succeeded in curing Martha's disease. As the American Civil War neared, violence spread into Missouri during the Bleeding Kansas incidents. In October 1860 several men led by Duff Green demanded that Daniel Marshall provide <b>medical</b> <b>assistance</b> to the pro-slavery faction, but he refused, and the men left. When the Marshalls' neighbors warned that Green was planning to return and murder them, the family quickly packed their belongings and escaped by steamboat to Illinois. The Marshalls remained in Illinois only briefly, before relocating to Indiana, which was even farther from the volatile border region.|$|E

5|$|Endecott's {{responsibility}} was {{to establish}} the colony and to prepare it {{for the arrival of}} additional settlers. The winters of 1629 and 1630 were difficult compared to those in England, and he called on the Plymouth Colony for <b>medical</b> <b>assistance.</b> His wife, who had been ill on the voyage over, died that winter. Other difficulties he encountered included early signs of religious friction among the colony's settlers (dividing between Nonconformists and Separatists), and poor relations with Thomas Morton, whose failed Wessagusset Colony and libertine practices (which including a May pole and dancing) were anathema to the conservative Puritanism practiced by most settlers in the Massachusetts Bay and Plymouth colonies. Early in his term as governor he visited the abandoned site of Morton's colony and had the Maypole taken down. When one group of early settlers wanted to establish a church independent of that established by the colonial leadership, he had their leaders summarily sent back to England.|$|E

When he is unsuccessful at receiving <b>medical</b> <b>assistance</b> for it, the admonishing doctor suggests he realize his relatively small amount of suffering by visiting {{a support group for}} testicular cancer victims. The group assumes that he, too, is affected like they are, and he spontaneously weeps into the nurturing arms of another man, finding a freedom from the catharsis that relieves his insomnia. He decides to participate in support groups of various kinds, always allowing the groups to assume that he suffers what they do. However, he begins to notice another impostor, Marla Singer, whose presence reminds him that he is attending these groups dishonestly, and this disturbs his bliss. The two negotiate to avoid their attending the same groups, but, before going their separate ways, Marla gives him her phone number.|$|E

Troi realizes Ian is dying and calls for <b>medical</b> <b>assistance.</b> As Pulaski tries to keep Ian alive, Lt. Commander Data (Brent Spiner) scans him and discovers that he is the source of radiation. Ian dies in Troi's arms, and turns into a ball of energy, which settles into Troi's hands, communicating telepathically with her for a moment, then leaves the ship. The lifeform told her that he wished to learn about humans through experiencing standard human development and living among the crew. With Ian gone, the plague sample returns to normal and the crew continues on their mission.|$|E

The government was cited as the first responder for water, relocation and <b>medical</b> <b>assistance,</b> and helping with the deceased. For rescue, shelter, clothing, and locating missing people, individuals were listed as the primary provider, but 100% of those surveyed replied that the government should be responsible for relief.

5|$|Under {{this new}} ownership, Mary Celeste sailed {{mainly in the}} West Indian and Indian Ocean routes, {{regularly}} losing money. Details of her movements occasionally appeared in the shipping news; in February 1879, she was reported at the island of St. Helena, where she had called to seek <b>medical</b> <b>assistance</b> for her captain, Edgar Tuthill, who had fallen ill. Tuthill died on the island, encouraging {{the idea that the}} ship was cursed—he was her third captain to die prematurely. In February 1880, the owners sold the Mary Celeste to a partnership of Bostonians headed by Wesley Gove. A new captain, Thomas L. Fleming, remained in the post until August 1884, when he was replaced by Gilman C. Parker. During these years, the ship's port of registration changed several times, before reverting to Boston. There are no records of her voyages during this time, although Brian Hicks, in his study of the affair, asserts that Gove tried hard to make a success of her.|$|E
5|$|A {{hurricane}} watch {{was issued}} for Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands late on November15, which was upgraded to a hurricane warning six hours later. By that time, Lenny was projected to move over Puerto Rico. After Lenny made its closest {{approach to the}} island, the hurricane warning was downgraded to a tropical storm warning on November17, which was discontinued the following day along with the advisories in the Virgin Islands. In Puerto Rico, the media maintained continuous coverage on the hurricane based on statements and warnings from the San Juan National Weather Service office. Based on the coverage, the public was well informed of the hurricane's threat to the island. Before the storm {{and as a result}} of its impact, around 4,700people evacuated to 191shelters. This included 1,190residents in Ponce who evacuated to 27schools, as well as 584people in western Puerto Rico. Officials closed all schools, banned the sale of alcohol, and ordered a freeze on the price of emergency supplies. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) activated six <b>medical</b> <b>assistance</b> teams, three medical support teams, and two advance medical assessment units. The agency stored five days' worth of food in schools in the U.S. Virgin Islands. Before the hurricane's arrival, U.S. Virgin Islands governor Charles Wesley Turnbull declared a state of emergency. In St. Croix, 309people rode out the storm in shelters. Officials opened eight shelters in the British Virgin Islands. There, airlines and hotels assisted in evacuating tourists from the area.|$|E
5|$|After the storm, Tampico {{was left}} without power or communications. About 15,000people became {{homeless}} {{due to the}} storm, or previously from Hurricane Gladys. The governor of Tamaulipas {{declared a state of}} emergency and requested assistance from the military to provide food and shelter. Within a day after the storm, water access was restored, although the city initially remained without power or telephone. Communications were cut to Tampico, except for the airport at the radio. The rail line from Laredo, Texas to Mexico City was cut during the storm, but was restored ten days later. Due to ongoing flood conditions, there was an outbreak of dysentery that killed two children. The Mexican government flew medical supplies, food, and clothing from Mexico City to Tampico, while four United States helicopters assisted in rescue missions along the Pánuco River. About 10days after Hilda struck Tampico, Hurricane Janet affected the same area, causing further damage and deaths. Collectively, the two hurricanes caused 1,240deaths along their paths, and damage from the consecutive storms totaled about half of Mexico's 1955 national budget. After the two hurricanes, the Mexican government and military worked to assist the affected residents, and the Mexican Red Cross provided vaccinations and <b>medical</b> <b>assistance</b> to prevent the spread of disease.|$|E
