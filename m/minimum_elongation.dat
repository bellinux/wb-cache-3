40|$|The {{anisotropy}} and microstructures during aging {{treatment for}} 2 A 66 Al-Li alloy were studied by Brinell hardness, tensile testing, optical microscope(OM), scanning electron microscope(SEM) and {{transmission electron microscope}} (TEM). The main factors which influence the anisotropy of mechanical properties were discussed. The results indicate that, before 165 ℃ peak-aged, the anisotropy of the mechanical properties of the 2 A 66 Al-Li alloy decreases gradually with the extension of aging time. When the alloy is over-aged, the anisotropy of the alloy increases; the anisotropy of ductility is more serious than that of strength. The IPA values of σ b, σ 0. 2 and δ of the alloy reach the lowest value at 3. 0 %, 3. 0 % and 12. 2 % respectively {{at the time of}} peak aging (64 h), and the alloy is also obtained with good plasticity and axial tensile properties. σ b, σ 0. 2 and δ of the alloy are 526. 5, 448. 9 MPa, 10. 1 % respectively. Under different heat treatment conditions, the general behavior of the anisotropy of 2 A 66 Al-Li alloy is as follows: longitudinal (0 &# 176;) and transverse (90 &# 176;) have the highest strength, 45 &# 176; direction is the lowest strength; 45 &# 176; direction specimen has the highest elongation, vertical and horizontal direction has the <b>minimum</b> <b>elongation...</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of the investigation is to develop an ultrahigh strength steel (UHSS) with a yield strength in excess of 1500 MPa, with a <b>minimum</b> <b>elongation</b> of 9 - 10 % for the fabrication of rocket motor casing. Attempts {{have been made to}} develop a special steel by the electroslag refining (ESR) process. The base alloy was prepared with a chemical composition of 0 center dot 28 C - 1 center dot 0 Mn- 1 center dot 0 Mo - 0 center dot 35 V - 4 center dot 2 Cr and a trace amount of S and P. This alloy has displayed yield strength of similar to 1450 MPa in the quenched and tempered condition with an average austenite grain size of similar to 65 mm. The mechanical properties were improved further by microalloying with 0 ? 07 % Ti and Nb. The yield strengths of Ti and Nb microalloyed steels are 1500 and 1570 MPa respectively, in the as cast quenched and tempered condition. The optical, scanning electron microscope (SEM) and transmission electron microscope (TEM) studies confirmed that the microstructure consists of tempered lath martensite. Transmission electron microscope (TEM) carbon replica and EDS analysis showed that the Ti(C, N) and Nb(C, N) precipitates might have helped to reduce the austenite grain size in the Ti and Nb steel. It {{is interesting to note that}} due to the smaller size of Nb (C, N), the grain size obtained in the Nb steel is in the range of 22 - 27 mm compared to 35 - 45 mm in the Ti steel.

40|$|In {{connections}} {{of steel}} structures stress concentrations occur {{due to the}} rapid geometric changes in the cross section. If the material has sufficient ductility then, due to plastic deformations, forces are redistributed {{so there will be}} equilibrium in the internal forces. In design codes this is accounted for by imposing certain requirements with respect to the tensile/yield strength ratio and minimal strain at fracture. This problem is of particular importance when high strength steels are used as questions are raised related to their ductility capacity. Over the past decades, high strength steel has gained significant ground in the steel structures market. A steel grade such as S 355, which was considered to be a high strength steel 20 years ago, {{is now one of the}} predominant grades used for steel construction. In practice the occurrence of stress concentrations raises questions on how to deal with them and how to ensure a certain amount of ductility to avoid brittle fracture. In most cases an inelastic finite element analysis in shell elements and based on the nonlinear behaviour of the material is required in order to calculate the strains at the notch-tips and prove redistribution of stresses takes place. However this is a time consuming and costly procedure. This paper addresses such issues and, based on Neuber’s formula for nonlinear material behaviour, a new method is developed to calculate the strains at the locations of the stress concentrations. This new approach, entitled Stefanescu Method (SM), is based only on the results of the linear finite element analysis to estimate the value of the strains. The procedure is first developed in theory and applied to a simple case of a plate with a hole in tension because in this case the stress concentration factors are already known. The results of the SM are checked with those of an inelastic finite element analysis. Based on the simple case of a plate with a hole in tension, the SM approach gives good estimates of the strains up to a limit load value of approximately 90 % of the smallest force that would cause yielding in any nominal section of the plate. The applicability of this method is extended to a bridge connection from a real life project (the A 1 /A 6 Diemen-Almere Havendreef steel railway arch bridge developed by Iv-Infra). The method is first studied on a simplified geometry of the gusset plate from the bridge connection. As the method again yields good results it is extended to the more complex geometry of the bridge connection. Comparing the results of the SM with those of an IFEA, the method gives good estimates of the strains. Based on the models used it can be concluded that the SM method can be applied to estimate strains at the location of the stress concentrations under the conditions that the loads are known and these are below 90 % of the smallest force that would cause yielding in any section of the elements subject to the stress concentrations. Also, this paper addresses the issue of the ultimate to yield strength ratio and to which extent this influences the ductility capacity of the material with respect to stress concentrations. For this purpose three different ratios were studied and their influence on the strains at the notch-tips is compared. With respect to stress concentrations and the local demand for ductility to redistribute stresses, the presence of strain hardening significantly increases the ductility capacity. The lack of strain hardening leads to low deformation capacities of the plates studied. The fu/fy parameter together with a <b>minimum</b> <b>elongation</b> at fracture can lead to very high ductility capacities of the elements.

40|$|Optical {{reception}} antennas (telescopes) must {{be capable}} of receiving communications even when the deep-space laser source is located within a small angle of the sun. Direct sunlight must {{not be allowed to}} shine on the primary reflector of an optical reception antenna, because too much light would be scattered into the signal detectors. A conventional sunshade that does not obstruct the antenna aperture would have to be about five times longer than its diameter in order to receive optical communications at a solar elongation of 12 degrees without interference. Such a long sunshade could not be accommodated within the dome of any existing large-aperture astronomical facility, and providing a new dome large enough would be prohibitively expensive. It is also desirable {{to reduce the amount of}} energy a space-based large-aperture optical reception facility would expend orienting a structure with such a sizable moment of inertia. Since a large aperture optical reception antenna will probably have a hexagonally segmented primary reflector, a sunshade consisting of hexagonal tubes can be mounted in alignment with the segmentation without producing any additional geometric obstruction.

The parameters investigated are the: micro-structural analysis, tensile strength properties, and their flexural performance in beams. The chemical analysis of the samples was carried out using Optical Emission Spectrometer (OES). The micrographic analysis was carried out using metallurgical research microscope. 600 mm length specimens of reinforcing bars of the six different steel was used for the tensile strength using tensile machine. For the flexural strength, 150 mm x 150 mm x 750 mm beam specimens was used. The beam specimens were reinforced with the six different reinforcing steel.

40|$|Graduation date: 1991 Germination {{strategies}} and early seedling development of selected Medicago and Hedysarum species were evaluated to identify plants with high potential for range rehabilitation in central Tunisia. Temperature (5 °C to 25 °C) and water stress (0 MPa to - 0. 8 MPa) affected the germination percentage of all Medicago and Hedysarum species. Water stress {{had a greater}} effect on percent germination than did temperature, however, {{the nature of the}} effect of water potential depended on temperature. Australian medics were more depressed by temperature extremes and low water potential than were Tunisian accessions. Optimum germination of Medicago polvmorpha var. Circle Valley and Medicago trucatula var. Jemalong was at 15 °C and 0 MPa. Germination was highly reduced at higher temperatures and water stress. Tunisian Medicago truncatula germinated better at lower temperatures (5 °C to 15 °C). Hedysarum carnosum germinated more completely at high temperatures. (15 °C to 20 °C). Medicago laciniata germinated well across a wide range of temperature but germination decreased as water stress increased. Rapid rates of root elongation are beneficial to plants in semiarid environments. High temperature accelerated rates of root elongation and low temperature retarded the rates. The degree of retardation varied with the species and the temperature range. Maximum root elongation occurred at 15 °C and <b>minimum</b> root <b>elongation</b> occurred at 5 °C. Medicago laciniata had the fastest root elongation rate at 5 °C and 15 °C. Medicago truncatula was equal to Medicago laciniata at 5 °C. Hedysarum carnosum had rapid root elongation at 10 °C and 15 °C compared to 5 °C. A Tunisian accession Medicago polymorpha had the slowest root elongation at all temperatures. A quantitative growth analysis was used to assess the effect of environmental conditions on the species performance over a period of 49 days. Mean relative growth rate (mRGR) varied among species. This variation suggested size hierarchies in relative performance among species. The largest plant, Tunisian Medicago truncatula had the largest mRGR and the smallest plant, The Tunisian Medicago polvmorpha had the lowest mRGR. The derived parameters, leaf area ratio (LAR) and unit leaf ratio (ULR), were not consistent with the size hierarchies obtained by mRGR. The Root to shoot ratio (R/S) varied among the species. The Tunisan Medicago truncatula had high root to shoot ratios at low temperature and its R/S ratio decreased at higher temperature. Slow growing species had high R/S ratio. Medicago laciniata was an exception, it produced low R/S ratio because of its long, and thin root system...|$|R
40|$|This is {{the author}} {{accepted}} manuscript. Synthetic fibre ropes are in widespread use in maritime applications ranging from lifting to temporary and permanent mooring systems for vessels, offshore equipment and platforms. The selection of synthetic ropes over conventional steel components is motivated by several key advantages including selectable axial stiffness, energy absorption (and hence load mitigation), fatigue resistance and low unit cost. The long-term use of ropes as safety critical components in potentially high dynamic loading environments necessitates that new designs are verified using stringent qualification procedures. The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) is one certification body that has produced several guidelines for the testing of synthetic ropes encompassing quasi-static and dynamic loading as well as fatigue cycling. This paper {{presents the results of}} tension-tension tests carried out to ISO 2307 : 2010, ISO 18692 : 2007 (E) and ISO/TS 19336 : 2015 (E) on three different 12 -strand rope constructions manufactured by Ashimori Industry Co. Ltd from polyester and Vectran® fibres. The purpose of the tests was to characterise the performance of a novel 12 -strand construction and compare this to a conventional 12 -strand construction. Utilising the Dynamic Marine Component test facility (DMaC) at the University of Exeter several key performance metrics were determined including; <b>elongation,</b> <b>minimum</b> break load (MBL) and quasi-static and dynamic stiffness. During the ISO 2307 : 2010 (E) test programme the samples were tested dry and during the ISO 18692 : 2007 (E) and ISO/TS 19336 : 2015 (E) test programmes the samples were fully submerged in tap water after being soaked for at least 24 hours. Two methods were used to quantify sample extension: i) an optical tracking system and ii) a draw-wire potentiometer. Axial compression fatigue and cyclic loading endurance tests were also carried out on two Vectran® samples.

40|$|A {{saccharide}} sensor was fabricated {{using an}} AlGaN/GaN heterostructure structure and a boronic-acid containing receptor. Parallel to this, photoelectrochemical (PEC) etching of Gallium Nitride (GaN) was employed {{both as a}} nanostructuring technique and {{as a method of}} rapid dislocation density enumeration. The device fabrication techniques necessary for the development of devices based on n-type GaN and its alloys were successfully implemented. A robust photolithographic mask capable of producing a variety of transistor and sensor structures was designed and fabricated. Surface Charge Lithography (SCL) was studied and implemented as a technique for the nanostructuring of n-type GaN. In contrast to previous work (where patterns with feature sizes down to 100 nm were created¹), several shortcomings of the technique were noted and subsequently investigated: a failure to achieve the intended <b>minimum</b> feature size; <b>elongation</b> of features in the direction of FIB instrument rastering; and the loss of thin features perpendicular to the rastering direction. A pattern design scheme to overcome these shortcomings was proposed along with experimental improvements expected to alleviate such issues. A novel receptor molecule employing a phenylboronic acid (BAT) was synthesised and used to functionalise an AlGaN/GaN FET device, thereby creating an electronic saccharide sensor device. The response of the sensor to a panel of saccharides (fructose, galactose and glucose) was investigated, with the order of response confirming previous findings (decreasing from fructose to galactose to glucose). The device was found to have good stability prior to failure, indicating that this type of sensor device shows a great deal of potential for wider use. PEC etching was used as a technique for determining the dislocation density in two distinct GaN on sapphire structures with thick AlN buffer layers. The SRI sample (100 nm of GaN with 500 nm of AlN) had a dislocation density of 1. 9 ±O. 2 xl 0 ⁹cm-², while the SH 2 sample (500 nm of GaN with lOOnm of AIN) had approximately twice this density, at 3. 8 ±O. 2 xl 0 ⁹cm-².

40|$|Salento, the {{southern}} portion of Apulia region (SE Italy) is a narrow and elongated peninsula in carbonate rocks, with prevailing low coastlines, locally interrupted by high rock cliffs. The {{long stretches of}} low coasts are marked by typical karst landforms consisting of collapse sinkholes. These are locally designated with the dialectal term "spunnulate" (deriving from the verb "spunnare", which means to break, to sink; PARISE et al., 2003). As observed in many other karst coastal settings worldwide (FORTH et al., 1999), development of sinkholes may be particularly severe along the coast, where both natural and anthropogenic processes contribute to accelerate the dissolution of carbonate rocks and subsidence processes, influencing the coastline evolution. Following a previous study, where the main features of sinkholes at Torre Castiglione (Taranto province) were investigated and described, and a preliminary susceptibility map produced (BRUNO et al., 2008), in the present paper we perform a detailed morphometric analysis on the sample of identified sinkholes. The main morphometric parameters generally used for sinkhole characterization have been considered in this study: shape of the sinkhole, azimuth and length of major and <b>minimum</b> axes, depth, <b>elongation</b> ratio, distance from the shorelines. Each of them is described, both as individual parameter and {{in conjunction with the}} others, in the attempt to identify the main factors controlling development of sinkholes in the area, and their evolution as well. As regards this latter aspect, beside simple morphometry of the sample of sinkholes at Torre Castiglione, we also focused our attention on the likely relationships existing between distribution and shape of the sinkholes and the tectonic discontinuities. The role played by discontinuities in controlling both distribution and evolution of sinkholes has been pointed out by several authors (WHITE & WHITE, 1987; DENIZMAN, 2003; FLOREA, 2005). To investigate the matter, a three-stage analysis has been carried out in this study by means of: field measurements of the fractures bounding the sinkholes; field measurement of the long axes azimuth of the elongated sinkholes; comparison of the previously described sets with the strikes of the main regional geological structures. Eventually, the approach here presented may be applied in other karst coastal sinkhole-prone areas, to gain new knowledge on the genesis and evolution of coastal sinkholes, and to properly evaluate the hazard they pose to the anthropogenic environment...|$|R
