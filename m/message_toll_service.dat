40|$|The {{benefits}} of competition among the long-distance interexchange carriers (IXCs) are not realized equally by all their customers. Despite the declines in rates under the discount plans, we document that basic <b>message</b> <b>toll</b> <b>service</b> (MTS) {{rates have been}} rising for several years. We show that poorer and less educated customers pay more than better educated and more affluent customers. We suspect {{that the reason for}} this correlation is that they are more apt to pay the MTS rates or other high rates, and we present some preliminary evidence that this tendency explains the correlation that we find. We also present evidence that the payment differences exist even after controlling for usage. These findings are significant because it seems likely to us that these two patterns (rising MTS rates and higher payments by the poor and the less educated) will each be ameliorated by the entry of the regional Bell operating companies (RBOCs) into long-distance markets—a state-by-state regulatory process that was nearly complete as of the beginning of 2004. ...|$|E

In order to eliminate queuing, study for alternative <b>toll</b> <b>service</b> system that able to decrease of service capacity and solve the problem is needed. The queuing study for conventional <b>toll</b> <b>services</b> system by deterministic analitical simulation approach model {{be able to figure}} out the losing time value along daily, weekly and annually. The effeciency of this approach model would also be known. Base on the queuing simulation model and minimum value of time in base year 2005 show that the time loosed by drivers in Pondok Gede Toll Gate are Rp. 212, 067, 819. 00 per week, Rp 1, 060, 339, 096. 00 per month, and Rp. 12, 724, 069, 163. 00 per year. If the <b>toll</b> <b>service</b> system operation is not improve, the losing time values for 5 years would increase to Rp. 477, 555, 711, 015. 00 and the accumulative losing time values for 10 years would be Rp. 4, 138, 238, 760, 266. 00. The ideal problem solving for the queuing in Pondok Gede Timur Toll Gate is electronic toll collection system. It may reduce the vehicles queue for today and future. The ideal combination of conventional system with electronic system are 10 gates for conventional and 1 gate for electronic services system if the commuter user higher or equal than 14 % and lower than 33 %, 9 gates for conventional and 2 gates for electronic services system if the commuter user higher or equal than 33 % and lower than 52 %, 8 gates for conventional and 3 gates for electronic services system if the commuter user higher or equal than 52 % and lower than 76 %, 7 gates for conventional and 4 gates for electronic services system if the commuter user higher than 76 %...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} {{estimating}} whether a natural level of non-penetration exists, and if so, what the maximum attainable penetration rate is. Universal service penetration levels have steadily {{increased over the}} last decade. This paper hypothesizes that penetration levels will level off over time at some point below 100 %. Econometric models have been created to estimate penetration rates {{as a function of}} several explanatory variables, including per capita personal income, price changes for residential local service, price changes for <b>toll</b> <b>services,</b> and the existence of lifeline programs. The modeling results also provide information on cross-elasticities between <b>toll</b> and local <b>service</b> and the effects of the FCC's subscriber line charges and lifeline programs on the universal service policy goal. In summary, this research provides new information on the topic of what constitutes universal service and provides considerable data regarding own-price and cross-price elasticities associated with residential local service. ...|$|R
