5|$|To {{finance the}} scheme, Otto, Augustus and Charles Morse met with Charles T. Barney, {{president}} of the city's third-largest trust, the Knickerbocker Trust Company. Barney had provided financing for previous Morse schemes. Morse, however, cautioned Otto that he needed <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>money</b> than he had to attempt the squeeze and Barney declined to provide funding. Otto decided to attempt the corner anyway. On Monday, October 14, he began aggressively purchasing shares of United Copper, which rose in one day from $39 to $52 per share. On Tuesday (Oct. 15), he issued the call for short sellers to return the borrowed stock. The share price rose to nearly $60, but the short sellers {{were able to find}} plenty of United Copper shares from sources other than the Heinzes. Otto had misread the market, and the share price of United Copper began to collapse.|$|E
5|$|Rod Jones {{was known}} as a hard hitter and a {{world-class}} track star, but was a controversial selection because, coming from the run-heavy Southwest Conference, his pass-coverage skills were unknown. At 5'11", 165lbs., he was considered undersized for the NFL. Jones was the first defensive back selected, but was rated no better than fifth-best by most scouting services. The Buccaneers were criticized for taking linebacker Jackie Walker with their third pick, when Kevin Murphy of the national champion Oklahoma Sooners was still available. The Buccaneers did eventually draft Murphy, who they were surprised to find still available with their 40th overall selection. Murphy was believed to have fallen due to rumors of a knee injury. The Buccaneers had rated both Walker and Murphy among the top 15 players in the draft. Craig Swoope was rated as the best safety in the draft, but fell to the fourth round because of a previous charge (and acquittal) of conspiracy to distribute cocaine. Swoope was eventually the only Buccaneer to achieve any kind of postseason honors in 1986, being selected to the Football Digest All-Rookie team. The team went for big offensive linemen in the later rounds. One of them was J.D. Maarleveld, the first cancer patient drafted by the NFL. Maarleveld was considered to have been a second-round talent, but fell {{all the way to the}} fifth round. Belief that Maarleveld was worth <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>money</b> than the average fifth-rounder caused his agent, Greg Marotta, to advise him to reject the Buccaneers' offer and sign with the USFL Baltimore Stars. Maarleveld was eventually able to reach agreement with the Buccaneers.|$|E

25|$|Once {{production}} has finished, the film undergoes post production (provided a Post Production Building has been erected), where music, sound effects, subtitles, speech and titles {{can be added}} to the movie. Cuts and changes can also be made to the length and order of the scenes, making editing the film easier. The player can also record sounds and a dialogue track for each character in that particular scene. The game allows for lip-synching, matching the speech to the actors. However, this only works for short sound files, and only shows basic lip movements. Once the movie has been completed, it can be saved in a proprietary file format for transferring to other PC users, or WMV format for online sharing. Outstanding player-made films can be nominated for a Stanley, a version of the Oscars. Once the player has reached Level 3 in story mode, the publicity office becomes available. This allows actors to hold press conferences and organizes marketing for the player's movie. Once a publicity office is built, players can also choose an advertising budget when releasing a film. A heavily-advertised movie can make <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>money,</b> but using too much advertising can result in the movie being 'over-exposed'.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{considers}} the optimal approach to reducing inflation when {{the cost of}} inflation is its conditional variability. Inflation is stochastically related to money growth, with unobservable time-varying autonomous and induced components. A sharp reduction in money growth provides information about the responsiveness of inflation to money but also induces variability as the economy heads into unknown territory. Gradual policy is always optimal and the model explains why moderate-inflation countries adopt a <b>much</b> <b>more</b> gradual <b>money</b> growth reduction than high-inflation countries. Additionally, the analysis sheds light on the more general problem of learning with two unobservable parameters. Copyright 1994 by The Review of Economic Studies Limited. ...|$|R

30|$|A game bot is an {{automated}} program that plays a given game {{on behalf of}} a human player. Game bots can earn <b>much</b> <b>more</b> game <b>money</b> and items than human users because the former can play without requiring a break. Game bots also disturb human users because they consistently consume game resources. For instance, game bots defeat all monsters quite rapidly and harvest items, such as farm produce and ore, before human users have an opportunity to harvest them. Accordingly, game bots cause complaints from human users and damage the reputation of the online game service provider. Furthermore, game bots can cause inflation in a game’s economy and shorten the game’s lifecycle, which defeats the purpose for which game companies develop such games (Lee et al. 2016).|$|R
