5|$|At {{the same}} time, the {{regulation}} of interstate commerce, especially as concerned the railroads, was a political issue. The call for regulation of the railroads divided the nation's business interests, with railroads working against legislation and manufacturers, who were aggrieved by high railroad rates, joining the reformers. Standard Oil joined the latter group in calling for Congressional action. In 1886, Payne voted for {{a bill that would}} reform railroad rates slightly, but was considered ineffective by reformers. After amendments by the House, however, the bill returned to the Senate with more substantive prohibitions on the practices consumers and manufacturers found <b>most</b> <b>egregious.</b> Payne voted against the strengthened Interstate Commerce Act, which passed and was signed into law by President Grover Cleveland. In explaining his vote, Payne said that the law was impractical and unfairly advantaged other methods of shipping (such as boat transportation on the Great Lakes) over the railroads.|$|E
5|$|Faced {{with growing}} {{legal and illegal}} {{competition}} for the globally marketed ASA, Bayer worked to cement the connection between Bayer and Aspirin. One strategy it developed was to switch from distributing Aspirin powder for pharmacists to press into pill form to distributing standardized tablets—complete with the distinctive Bayer cross logo. In 1903 the company set up an American subsidiary, with a converted factory in Rensselaer, New York, to produce Aspirin for the American market without paying import duties. Bayer also sued the <b>most</b> <b>egregious</b> patent violators and smugglers. The company's attempts to hold onto its Aspirin sales incited criticism from muckraking journalists and the American Medical Association, especially after the 1906 Pure Food and Drug Act that prevented trademarked drugs from being listed in the United States Pharmacopeia; Bayer listed ASA with an intentionally convoluted generic name (monoacetic acid ester of salicylic acid) to discourage doctors referring to anything but Aspirin.|$|E
5|$|Second, Frederick's <b>most</b> <b>egregious</b> {{mistake was}} {{his refusal to}} {{consider}} the recommendations of his trusted staff. Brother Henry, a superb tactician and strategist in his own right, reasonably suggested halting the battle at mid-day, after the Prussians had secured the first height and Wunsch, the city. Wunsch could not move across the river; only one bridge remained, and Laudon's cavalry guarded it fiercely. Regardless, from these vantage points, the Prussians would be unassailable, and eventually, the Austro-Russian force would have to withdraw. Furthermore, Henry argued, the troops were exhausted from several days of marching, the weather was appallingly hot, {{they did not have}} enough water, and they had not had a good meal in several days. Instead of holding his secure position, though, Frederick forced his tired troops to descend the hill, cross the low ground, and ascend the next hill, in the face of heavy fire. The Prussian cavalry effort initially drove back the Russian and Austrian squadrons, but the fierce cannon and musketry fire from the united Allied front inflicted staggering losses on Frederick's much-vaunted horsemen. Furthermore, he committed perhaps the gravest of errors in sending his cavalry into battle piecemeal and against entrenched positions.|$|E

5|$|The <b>most</b> <b>egregious</b> episode {{during the}} Red Summer was a vicious attack on blacks in Elaine, Arkansas, in which nearly 200 blacks were murdered.

Du Bois rallied blacks across America to raise funds for the legal defense, which, six years later, resulted in a Supreme Court victory authored by Oliver Wendell Holmes.

40|$|Starting with a contextual {{characterization}} of the concepts of “women”, and “traditions”, this dissertation examines the position of women facing African traditions, particularly through some of their practical manifestations: excision, polygamy and levirate. This dissertation focuses on {{the description of the}} ontological, social and cultural bases of these traditional practices in order to reflect on their links to ancestral believes. This study explores how social representations are reflected in a corpus of five novels and three films, chosen in connection with their pertinence to the subject. In this respect, the ideological and philosophical position of the authors regarding those ancestral practices is analyzed. In such a respect, it is important to mention Fatou Keita in Rebelle, Mariama Barry in La Petite Peule, Mariama Bâ in Une si longue lettre, Habibatou Traoré in Sidagamie, Dieudonné Nkounkou in Le lévirat, on the one hand, Sembène Ousmane in Moolaadé and Xala, Cheick Oumar Sissoko in Finzan, on the other hand. My analysis explores the attitudes of female heroines who revolt against their oppressive patriarchal environments and it reveals the necessity of questioning those behaviors and habits of mind that perpetuate the subjugation of women in the name of tradition. I also review perceptions of ancestral practices in West Africa, first by women themselves and then by society as a whole. This study brings to light some of the <b>most</b> traditional and <b>egregious</b> abuses against women that are rooted in West African ancestral traditions, particularly against those women living in rural areas. I consider, for example, the various systems of mystification that allow the oppression of women to persist today in the name of tradition. While this study points out the urgent need to overcome certain negative aspects of West African traditions, it also acknowledges the benefit of valorizing positive elements of traditional life and cultural experience, even more than we already do presently...|$|R

25|$|UNAMSIL forces began {{arriving}} in Sierra Leone in December 1999. At {{that time the}} maximum number of troops to be deployed was set at 6,000. Only a few months later, though, in February 2000, a new UN resolution authorized the deployment of 11,000 combatants. In March 2001 that number was increased to 17,500 troops, making it at the time the largest UN force in existence, and UNAMSIL soldiers were deployed in the RUF-held diamond areas. Despite these numbers, UNAMSIL was frequently rebuffed and humiliated by RUF rebels, being subjected to attacks, obstruction and disarmament. In the <b>most</b> <b>egregious</b> example, in May 2000 over 500 UNAMSIL peacekeepers were captured by the RUF and held hostage. Using the weapons and armored personnel carriers of the captured UNAMSIL troops, the rebels advanced towards Freetown, taking over the town of Lunsar to its northeast. For over a year later, the UNAMSIL force meticulously avoided intervening in RUF controlled mining districts lest another major incident occur. After the UNAMSIL force had essentially rearmed the RUF, a call for a new military intervention was made to save the UNAMSIL hostages and the government of Sierra Leone.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Corporate {{behavior}} {{has been in}} the limelight for a few years now. With issues raging from excessive compensation, inferior financial performance, misleading statements and even outright fraud, {{it is no wonder that}} the equity markets are pricing a higher risk premium. Though the performance of equity markets has suffered, this phenomenon has been a boon for activists who have long argued for reform in accounting and accountability. What makes this issue even more challenging is the fact that management must always deal with balancing interests of all stakeholders. This outcry has resulted into some substantial legislation such as the Sarbanes-Oxley (SOX) act. Even though the jury is out on whether SOX has accomplished what it was designed to do, namely, to provide more transparency and legitimacy to the numbers reported by the corporations, it is a step in the right direction, even if not THE step in the right direction. The impact of this fallout has been even more acute than in previous market downturns as more people have stake in the equity markets. Most households, either as a result of retirement accounts and or direct investing, participate in the markets. What evidence exists to indicate that corporate {{behavior has}} been less than stellar? Although such evidence may be difficult to generate, there is much anecdotal to this effect. An examination of some the legal cases pending and or being prosecuted include MCI, Enron, Adelphia, and more. But what of the argument that these cases are just outliers and most firms don’t behave, and indeed aren’t implicated. Here, the issue has to be better defined. The above mentioned firms, and other more recent cases like Marsh 2 ̆ 6 McLennan, AIG, are cases where the actions of these corporations had been <b>egregious.</b> <b>Most</b> of the S 2 ̆ 6 P firms, though far from such acute controversies, can still be questioned...|$|R
40|$|Beneath {{the shadow}} of the {{aircraft}} and beyond the airport fence, communities wrestle with the impacts of airport expansion and operations. This dissertation builds scholarly foundations to explore the tensions between local residents who want to maintain healthy and stable communities and airport owners who want to grow operations and promote regional economic growth. The literature review contributes an overview of existing scholarship that investigates airports in an urban planning context, a realm of study I term ‘aviation urbanism’. To address gaps in aviation urbanism scholarship, I derived and investigated three research questions pertaining to neighborhood change, environmental justice outcomes, and the airport infrastructure planning process for airport-adjacent communities. The dissertation first asks: How has the population of historically marginalized groups living near airports changed with the rise of the jet age? The spatial analysis and descriptive statistics show that airport-adjacent communities in multi-airport regions generally increased persons of color and increased renters more than their respective metropolitan regions. Additionally, the communities often underperformed socio-economically with respect to their region. The second research question asks: Were hub airports more likely to expand if historically marginalized groups surrounded them? The exact logistic regression model, which was designed to be suitable for binary outcomes and small sample sizes, did not offer statistical evidence that environmental injustice is a concern at a systemic, institutional level for major airport expansion decisions. Next, I investigated environmental injustice on a case-by-case basis during the planning process, asking: How did the Federal Aviation Administration and airport owners frame and evaluate environmental justice in the planning process for airport expansion projects? After investigating the methodological framing of environmental justice in Environmental Impact Statements, I found that the methodological variation in comparison geography prevented the FAA and airport owners from recognizing and mitigating disproportionate impacts at two of the three airports with the <b>most</b> obvious and <b>egregious</b> levels of environmental justice concern. Overall, this dissertation contributes a methodological approach to define airport-adjacent communities and offers a basis for further inquiries into the relationship between airport infrastructure, airport-adjacent communities, and airport-centric activity centers. ...|$|R

40|$|After {{years of}} legal {{maneuvering}} and courtroom skirmishes, {{the lines in}} the war between copyright holders and online copyright infringers have been clearly drawn. This conflict, which is poised to erupt in courts across the country, began decades ago {{with the birth of}} the Internet, which gave rise to a previously unparalleled opportunity for the dissemination, sharing, and enjoyment of every conceivable form of human expression. In addition to the benefits it has provided, the Internet also has given rise to copyright infringement on a global scale through the unauthorized posting and sharing of digital files. After years of unsuccessfully battling Internet service providers (ISPs) and file sharing network software distributors, such as Napster and KaZaA, the war against digital copyright infringement may end soon, now that copyright holders are finally taking action directly against the actual infringers. To bring such actions against individual infringers, copyright holders must serve subpoenas on the ISPs pursuant to the Digital Millennium Copyright Act [hereinafter DMCA] to obtain the infringers’ subscriber information. Before the real conflict concerning copyright infringement can be fought in the courts or over settlement tables, various issues with the intermediate subpoena process must be resolved. First, does the subpoena authority granted by the DMCA put too much power into the hands of copyright owners? And even more importantly, does this subpoena power strip from alleged infringers any defense that they may have against its abuse? Unless an appropriate balance can be reached with respect to the authority granted by the DMCA’s subpoena provision, the war against copyright infringement will be won at the expense of service providers and the Constitutional rights of alleged infringers. The goal of this Article is to demonstrate that the DMCA subpoena provision neither aids those attempting to enforce copyrights nor sufficiently protects the interests of Internet users. A recent decision by the DC Court of Appeals stripped copyright holders of the use of the DMCA subpoena in situations where the offender’s ISP acts merely as a conduit for the transmission of infringing material, which encompasses the <b>most</b> pervasive and <b>egregious</b> form of infringement: unauthorized sharing of copyrighted material via peer-to-peer (P 2 P) networks, such as KaZaA. Thus, the DMCA subpoena power is unavailable to copyright holders when it is most needed. This situation must be remedied. At the same time, and even more importantly, additional statutory safeguards protecting the interests of ISPs and the rights of alleged copyright infringers must be built into the subpoena provision, which may be accomplished without sacrificing or significantly impeding copyright owners’ ability to enforce their copyrights. At best, the DMCA subpoena provision, in its current form, completely undermines alleged infringers’ Fifth Amendment due process rights and unfairly places the likely immense burden of challenging and responding to subpoenas on ISPs. At worst, the provision is susceptible to mistakes and abuse by those who would use it for purposes other than copyright enforcement. The inclusion of certain requirements, such as requiring the provision of notice to alleged infringers before their subscriber information is released, would not unduly burden copyright holders or hinder the enforcement process, but would protect against mistakes and abuse...|$|R

[...] People columnist Janice Min wrote that [...] "the <b>most</b> <b>egregious</b> crime at the 68th Academy Awards on March 25 was–egad!–the relentless elegance and good taste that deprived viewers of genuine, Grade A snicker fodder. Television critic Howard Rosenberg of the Los Angeles Times applauded Goldberg's performance, noting that her [...] "confident performance [...] was symbolic of her whopping improvement as host over her showing on the 1994 Oscars." ...|$|E

Club in 2009, said that Whitney was a [...] "competent actress", but that Rand [...] "represents some of Treks <b>most</b> <b>egregious</b> offenses against feminism". He criticized her role within the show, and {{specifically}} in [...] "Charlie X" [...] when Charlie slaps her bottom {{and none of}} the characters can explain why he should not do that. Michelle Erica Green praised the [...] "substantial" [...] role given to Rand in [...] "Flashback" [...] while writing for TrekNation, adding that {{this was the first time}} such a role had been given to the character in the franchise. However, she criticized Rand's being written out part way through the episode as she felt that the character could have had more to contribute to the plot.|$|E
500|$|Adair's {{lieutenant}} governor, William T. Barry, and John Pope, Secretary of State under Adair's predecessor, {{headed a}} six-man committee {{authorized by the}} act to study {{the creation of a}} system of common schools. [...] The [...] "Barry Report," [...] delivered to the legislature in December 1822, was lauded by such luminaries as John Adams, Thomas Jefferson, and James Madison. [...] Authored by committee member Amos Kendall, it criticized the idea of land grant academies then prevalent in the state as unworkable outside affluent towns. [...] It also concluded that the Literary Fund alone was insufficient for funding a system of common schools. [...] The report recommended that funds only be made available to counties that imposed a county tax {{for the benefit of the}} public school system. [...] Legislators largely ignored the report, a decision Kentucky historian Thomas D. Clark called [...] "one of the <b>most</b> <b>egregious</b> blunders in American educational history".|$|E
500|$|Marcie Bianco of Quartz {{described}} {{the film as}} [...] "centered around women's desire" [...] and Haynes structured {{it in a way}} that [...] "elevates the power of women's gaze". The omission of Carol from Best Picture, Bianco concluded, illustrates [...] "yet again how sexism operates in the world, and in the Academy specifically, as the refusal to see women as protagonists and agents of desire." [...] Writing for Paper magazine, Carey O'Donnell observed that gay romances are only [...] "Oscar surefires" [...] when they use the tragedy and desolation equation, and [...] "a depiction of two strong women in love with each other ... who end up being [...] " [...] with their lesbian relationship [...] "seems to still be troubling to many." [...] David Ehrlich of Rolling Stone commented that the film's [...] "patience and precision" [...] did not conform to Academy tastes, but its legacy [...] "will doubtlessly survive this year's <b>most</b> <b>egregious</b> snub".|$|E
500|$|The game's stylistic {{changes from}} past Final Fantasy titles sparked {{negative}} comments, with some perceiving it as {{a change in}} the spirit of the franchise. Among these were the game's status as Final Fantasys first direct sequel and the change from a tragic atmosphere in Final Fantasy X to a dominantly lighthearted tone in Final Fantasy X-2. In their review, gaming website GameSpot commented that [...] "Some of the missions ... come off as downright silly and a bit tacked on". Additionally, they felt that the game's non-linear style makes it [...] " [...] the singular narrative thrust of Final Fantasy X or other typical RPGs, and the storyline can feel a little nebulous and disjointed as a result". Moreover, GameSpot commented that [...] "trivial minigames have been creeping into the Final Fantasy games at an alarming rate over the last few years, and in this regard, X-2 is definitely the <b>most</b> <b>egregious</b> offender in the series". Despite these comments, they praised the battle system as a [...] "welcome addition", while regarding its voice-overs and localizations as [...] "outstanding".|$|E
500|$|As the <b>most</b> <b>egregious</b> offence an {{individual}} could commit, viewed {{as seriously as}} though the accused had personally attacked the monarch, high treason demanded the ultimate punishment. [...] But whereas men guilty of this crime were hanged, drawn and quartered, women were drawn and burned. [...] In his Commentaries on the Laws of England the 18th-century English jurist William Blackstone noted that the sentence, [...] "to be drawn to the gallows, and there to be burned alive", was [...] "full as terrible to the sensation as the other". [...] Blackstone wrote that women were burned rather than quartered as [...] "the decency due to the sex forbids the exposing and publicly mangling their bodies". [...] However, an observation by historian Jules Michelet, that [...] "the first flame to rise consumed the clothes, revealing poor trembling nakedness", may, {{in the opinion of}} historian Vic Gatrell, suggest that this solution is [...] "misconceived". [...] In The Hanging Tree, Gatrell concludes that the occasional live burial of women in Europe gave tacit acknowledgement to the possibility that a struggling, kicking female hanging from a noose could [...] "elicit obscene fantasies" [...] from watching males.|$|E
500|$|Swiss {{cities and}} railway lines were {{repeatedly}} bombed by Allied aircraft during the war, beginning with minor attacks by the Royal Air Force on Geneva, Basel, and Zürich in 1940. Possibly the <b>most</b> <b>egregious</b> occurred 1April 1944when 50B-24 Liberators of the U.S. 14th Combat Bomb Wing bombed Schaffhausen, killing and injuring more than 100, and damaging {{a large portion}} of the city. In reaction to comments by Swiss Foreign Minister Marcel Pilet-Golaz that the incident [...] "apparently was a deliberate attack", American apologies were undermined by ill-advised statements made by Air Force commanders in London which blamed weather and minimized the size and accuracy of the attack. Although an in-depth investigation showed that weather in France, particularly winds that nearly doubled the ground speed of the U.S. bombers, did in fact cause the wing to mistake Schaffhausen for its target at Ludwigshafen am Rhein, the Swiss were not mollified. Incidents escalated, resulting in 13 separate attacks on Swiss territory on 22February 1945—the day President Franklin D. Roosevelt's special assistant, Lauchlin Currie, went to Schaffhausen to lay a wreath on the graves of those killed a year earlierand simultaneous attacks 4March that dropped 29tons of high explosives and 17tons of incendiaries on Basel and Zürich.|$|E
500|$|On May 8, 2003, the NCAA {{accepted}} Michigan's sanctions. It also imposed {{an additional}} {{two years of}} probation and docked the school one scholarship a year from 20042005 until 20072008. It also ordered the school to disassociate itself from Traylor (who has since died), Taylor and Bullock until 2012, and Webber until 2013. The NCAA also barred Michigan from postseason play for the 200304 season (later overturned on appeal). Infractions committee chairman Thomas Yeager, who had come very close to imposing the [...] "death penalty" [...] on the University of Alabama football program a few months earlier, called the Martin/Michigan affair [...] "one of {{the three or four}} <b>most</b> <b>egregious</b> violations of NCAA bylaws" [...] ever. The disassociation meant that Michigan could not accept donations or recruiting assistance from any of the players for ten years. Webber's sanction ended on May 8, 2013. The NCAA criticized Fisher for allowing Martin access to the program, but did not sanction him. The University announced its intention to appeal the additional one-year suspension from post-season play. As a result of the sanctions, Ellerbe's successor, Tommy Amaker, received a two-year contract extension through the 2007–08 season to compensate for the duties while under probation, and Bernard Robinson, Jr. had the right to transfer without sitting out a year because, as the only scholarship senior, the ineligibility extended for his entire remaining scholarship tenure.|$|E
500|$|The {{downside}} of demobilization was that around 70,000 military personnel were left unemployed. That meant {{little to the}} conscripts, and most returned home, but the career military personnel saw their livelihoods taken away, and houses, land, and money which was promised to them was either not delivered due to inadequate resources or seemed to be paid arbitrarily. Since only 5.8% of the former officers had received benefits by early 1992, {{there was a feeling}} that those who had political favor had either kept their jobs in the 14% of the military which was retained or received their promised compensation. Between April and December 1992, a series of strikes were held in protest of the situation. Pockets of army veterans ("recompas") and resistance veterans ("recontras") threatened to re-arm, but realizing they had the same issues, the two sides joined forces. To pacify the groups, Chamorro integrated some of the former Contra fighters into the rural police services and established a Civil Inspectorate to investigate claims of police abuses and human rights violations. [...] She also allowed the Sandinistas' agrarian reform movement's redistribution of land to be maintained and expanded it on the Caribbean coast to meet veterans' demands. That move created conflict with the Caribbean indigenous people and infringed on forestry reserves leading to criticism. Others who had received land from the Sandinistas began to return their co-operative land titles to the large landholders who had owned them before the reforms, or simply to sell their portions to opportunists. Unable to solve the problem, Chamorro dealt with the <b>most</b> <b>egregious</b> claims and then turned the issue over to the courts to resolve individual disputes.|$|E
500|$|High treason was the <b>most</b> <b>egregious</b> offence an {{individual}} could commit. [...] Attempts {{to undermine the}} king's authority were viewed with as much seriousness as if the accused had attacked him personally, which itself would be an assault on his status as sovereign and {{a direct threat to}} his right to govern. [...] As this might undermine the state, retribution was considered an absolute necessity and the crime deserving of the ultimate punishment. [...] The practical difference between the two offences therefore was in the consequence of being convicted; rather than being drawn and hanged, men were to be hanged, drawn and quartered, while for reasons of public decency (their anatomy being considered inappropriate for the sentence), women were instead drawn and burned. [...] The Act declared that a person had committed high treason if they were: compassing or imagining the death of the king, his wife or his eldest son and heir; violating the king's wife, his eldest daughter if she were unmarried, or the wife of his eldest son and heir; levying war against the king in his realm; adhering to the king's enemies in his realm, giving them aid and comfort in his realm or elsewhere; counterfeiting the Great Seal or the Privy Seal, or the king's coinage; knowingly importing counterfeit money; killing the Chancellor, Treasurer or one of the king's Justices while performing their offices. [...] The Act did not limit the king's authority in defining the scope of treason. [...] It contained a proviso giving English judges discretion to extend that scope whenever required, a process more commonly known as constructive treason. [...] It also applied to subjects overseas in British colonies in the Americas, but the only documented incident of {{an individual}} there being hanged, drawn and quartered was that of Joshua Tefft, an English colonist accused of having fought {{on the side of the}} Narragansett during the Great Swamp Fight. [...] He was executed in January 1676. [...] Later sentences resulted either in a pardon or a hanging.|$|E
