30|$|Magnetohydrodynamics, which {{combines}} the environmental fluid mechanics and electrodynamics theories {{to study the}} interaction discipline between the conduction fluid and electromagnetic, is {{the theory of the}} macroscopic, and it has spanned a very large range of applications (Gerebeau et al. [2006]). Due to the lower environmental pollution, especially in energy industry, <b>magnetohydrodynamic</b> <b>power</b> <b>generation</b> is used to conserve energy and mitigate pollution {{in order to protect the}} environment. In virtue of the industrial importance and theoretical challenges, the study on (MHD) has attracted many scientists. In the present paper, we are interested in the well-posedness theory of (MHD). Many results concerning the existence and uniqueness of (weak, strong or smooth) solutions in one dimension can be found in (Chen and Wang [2002], [2003]; Kawashima and Okada [1982]) and the references cited therein. In multi-dimensional case the global existence of weak solutions for the bounded domains has been established recently in (Ducomet and Feireisl [2006]; Tan and Wang [2009]). The local unique strong solution has been obtained in (Fan and Yu [2009]). In (Chen and Tan [2010], [2012]) we established the global existence and decay rates of the smooth solutions for the Cauchy problem. However, many fundamental problems for the compressible (MHD) in the half space are still open. In this paper, we will extend our results (Chen and Tan [2010]) to the initial boundary problem in the half space.|$|E
40|$|Scattering {{phenomena}} play {{an important}} role in modern physics. Many significant discoveries have been made through collision experiments. Amongst diverse kinds of collision systems, this book sheds light on the collision of an electron with a molecule. The electron-molecule collision provides a basic scattering problem. It is scattering by a nonspherical, multicentered composite particle with its centers having degrees of freedom of motion. The molecule can even disintegrate, Le., dissociate or ionize into fragments, some or all of which may also be molecules. Although it is a difficult problem, the recent theoretical, experimental, and computational progress has been so significant as to warrant publication of a book that specializes in this field. The progress owes partly to technical develop­ ments in measurements and computations. No less important has been the great and continuing stimulus from such fields of application as astrophysics, the physics of the earth's upper atmosphere, laser physics, radiation physics, the physics of gas discharges, <b>magnetohydrodynamic</b> <b>power</b> <b>generation,</b> and so on.

40|$|Abstract- <b>Magnetohydrodynamic</b> (MHD) <b>power</b> <b>generation</b> {{process is}} {{basically}} {{based on the}} physics background of space plasma. The basic principle is the Faradays Law of electromagnetic induction. In this device plasma (Ionized gas) is the working fluid similar to the mechanism that happening in the magnetosphere of our earth’s atmosphere. Except here the process is controlled and we increase the fluid density and pressure to get maximum efficiency in the generating power. Most problems come from the low conductivity feature in the gas at high temperature. High temperature gaseous conductor at high velocity is passed through a powerful magnetic field and a current is generated and extracted by placing electrodes at suitable position in the gas stream, and hence the thermal energy of gas is directly converted in to electrical energy.

40|$|Collisions of {{electrons}} with molecules {{is one of}} the fundamental processes which occur both in atomic and molecular physics and also in chemistry. These collisions are vital in determining the energy balance and transport properties {{of electrons}} in gases and plasmas at low temperatures. There are many important applications for the basic understanding of these collision processes. For example, the study of planetary atmospheres and the interstellar medium involves electron collisions with both molecules and molecular ions. In particular, two of the major cooling mechanisms of electrons in the Earth's ionosphere are (i) the fine structure changing transitions of oxygen atoms by electron impact and (ii) the resonant electron-impact vibrational excitation of N_ 2. Other applications include <b>magnetohydrodynamic</b> <b>power</b> <b>generation</b> and laser physics. A molecule, by definition, will contain more than one nucleus and consequently the effect of nuclear motion in the molecule leads to many extra processes in electron scattering by molecules which cannot occur in electron-atom scattering. As for atoms, both elastic and inelastic scattering occur, {{but in the case of}} inelastic electron scattering by molecules, the target molecule is excited to a different state by the process. The excitation may be one, or some combination, of rotational, vibrational and electronic transitions. Other reactions which may occur include dissociation of the molecule into its constituent atoms or ionisation. Another difficulty arises when considering the interactions between the electron and the molecule, This interaction, which considerably complicates the calculation, is non-spherical and various methods have been developed over the years to represent this interaction. This thesis considers electron scattering by molecular oxygen in the low energy range i. e. 0 - 15 eV. These collisions are of considerable interest in atmospheric physics and chemistry where the electron impact excitation of O_ 2 has great importance. Another reason why oxygen is an interesting and unusual molecule to study is the open-shell nature of the target which has " 3 #SIGMA#_g"- as its ground electronic stateSIGLEAvailable from British Library Document Supply Centre-DSC:DXN 027005 / BLDSC - British Library Document Supply CentreGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
40|$|A pulse {{detonation}} research engine (MSFC (Marshall Space Flight Center) Model PDRE (Pulse Detonation Rocket Engine) G- 2) {{has been}} developed {{for the purpose of}} examining integrated propulsion and <b>magnetohydrodynamic</b> <b>power</b> <b>generation</b> applications. The engine is based on a rectangular cross-section tube coupled to a converging-diverging nozzle, which is in turn attached to a segmented Faraday channel. As part of the shakedown testing activity, the pressure wave was interrogated {{along the length of the}} engine while running on hydrogen/oxygen propellants. Rapid transition to detonation wave propagation was insured through the use of a short Schelkin spiral near the head of the engine. The measured detonation wave velocities were in excess of 2500 m/s in agreement with the theoretical C-J velocity. The engine was first tested in a straight tube configuration without a nozzle, and the time resolved thrust was measured simultaneously with the head-end pressure. Similar measurements were made with the converging-diverging nozzle attached. The time correlation of the thrust and head-end pressure data was found to be excellent. The major purpose of the converging-diverging nozzle was to configure the engine for driving an MHD generator for the direct production of electrical power. Additional tests were therefore necessary in which seed (cesium-hydroxide dissolved in methanol) was directly injected into the engine as a spray. The exhaust plume was then interrogated with a microwave interferometer in an attempt to characterize the plasma conditions, and emission spectroscopy measurements were also acquired. Data reduction efforts indicate that the plasma exhaust is very highly ionized, although there is some uncertainty at this time as to the relative abundance of negative OH ions. The emission spectroscopy data provided some indication of the species in the exhaust as well as a measurement of temperature. A 24 -electrode-pair segmented Faraday channel and 0. 6 Tesla permanent magnet assembly were then installed on Marshall Space Flight Center's (MSFC's) rectangular channel pulse detonation research engine. Magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) electrical power extraction experiments were carried out for a range of load impedances in which cesium hydroxide seed (dissolved in methanol) was sprayed into the gaseous oxygen/hydrogen propellants. Positive power extraction was obtained, but preliminary analysis of the data indicated that the plasma electrical conductivity is lower than anticipated and the near-electrode voltage drop is not negligible. It is believed that the electrical conductivity is reduced due to a large population of negative OH ions. This occurs because OH has a strong affinity for capturing free electrons. The effect of near-electrode voltage drop is associated with the high surface-to-volume ratio of the channel (1 -inch by 1 -inch cross-section) where surface effects play a dominant role. As usual for MHD devices, higher performance will require larger scale devices. Overall, the gathered data is extremely valuable from the standpoint of understanding plasma behavior and for developing empirical scaling laws...|$|E

50|$|The {{development}} of the ARC began in 1975 {{as an effort to}} develop a shock tube for experimental research in <b>magnetohydrodynamic</b> (MHD) <b>power</b> <b>generation.</b> At the same time, the engineering accreditation board recommended that the Aerospace Engineering Department (which has since merged back into the Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering) should have a high speed wind tunnel capability.

In 1976, two professors visited both the AEDC and NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama, to view their transonic Ludwieg tube facilities. The idea was the build a smaller version of the wind tunnel at UTA, but when the AEDC facility was toured it was found that its Ludwieg tube had recently been decommissioned. The Ludwieg tube had been developed as a prototype for the Air Force concept for the National Transonic Facility Development Program, but the decision had recently been made to build the NTF at the NASA Langley Research Center using their cryogenic tunnel concept. The professors jokingly told the AEDC project manager to consider donating the tube to UTA, which was taken as a serious offer. The Ludwieg tube was declared government surplus and donated to UTA, showing up at the rail head in Arlington, Texas on three flat bed cars.|$|R
40|$|The {{production}} of onboard electrical power by pulse detonation engines is problematic {{in that they}} generate no shaft power; however, pulse detonation driven <b>magnetohydrodynamic</b> (MHD) <b>power</b> <b>generation</b> represents one intriguing possibility for attaining self-sustained engine operation and generating large quantities of burst power for onboard electrical systems. To examine this possibility further, a simple heat-sink apparatus was developed for experimentally investigating pulse detonation driven MHD generator concepts. The hydrogen oxygen fired driver was a 90 cm long stainless steel tube having a 4. 5 cm square internal cross section and a short Schelkin spiral near the head end to promote rapid formation of a detonation wave. The tube was intermittently filled to atmospheric pressure and seeded with a CsOH/methanol prior to ignition by electrical spark. The driver exhausted through an aluminum nozzle having an area contraction ratio of A*/A(sub zeta) = 1 / 10 and an area expansion ratio of A(sub zeta) /A* = 3. 2 (as limited by available magnet bore size). The nozzle exhausted through a 24 -electrode segmented Faraday channel (30. 5 cm active length), which was inserted into a 0. 6 T permanent magnet assembly. Initial experiments verified proper drive operation with and without the nozzle attachment, and head end pressure and time resolved thrust measurements were acquired. The exhaust jet from the nozzle was interrogated using a polychromatic microwave interferometer yielding an electron number density {{on the order of}} 10 (exp 12) /cm at the generator entrance. In this case, MHD <b>power</b> <b>generation</b> experiments suffered from severe near-electrode voltage drops and low MHD interaction; i. e., low flow velocity, due to an inherent physical constraint on expansion with the available magnet.
