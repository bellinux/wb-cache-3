5|$|Along with Book of Lost Tales, Douglas Anderson {{shows that}} in The Hobbit, Tolkien again {{includes}} both the <b>more</b> <b>serious</b> 'medieval' type of elves, such as Elrond and the Wood-elf king, and frivolous elves, such as those at Rivendell.|$|E
5|$|Definitive {{criteria}} include histopathologic {{evidence of}} endometritis, thickened filled Fallopian tubes, or laparoscopic findings. Gram stain/smear becomes definitive {{in the identification}} of rare, atypical and possibly <b>more</b> <b>serious</b> organisms. Two thirds of patients with laparoscopic evidence of previous PID were not aware they had PID, but even asymptomatic PID can cause serious harm.|$|E

5|$|In general, {{the show}} {{began to take}} on a <b>more</b> <b>serious</b> tone as a seriocomic (or dramedy) series, in which the focus was on the {{character}} rather than the character type, and moved away from its status as a situation comedy.|$|E
5|$|This {{timeline}} {{extends the}} duration of the pagan reaction from less than a year, in Bede's narrative, to about eight years. This represents a <b>more</b> <b>serious</b> setback for the church.|$|E
5|$|When {{the police}} arrest Laszlo on a minor, trumped-up charge, Rick persuades Renault to release him by {{promising}} {{to set him}} up for a much <b>more</b> <b>serious</b> crime: possession of the letters. To allay Renault's suspicions, Rick explains that he and Ilsa will be leaving for America.|$|E
50|$|Something for the Rest of Us was {{released}} on August 31, 2010. While the album was full of the pop-rock that has sustained the band for decades, lead singer/guitarist Rzeznik's songwriting took on a <b>more</b> somber, <b>serious</b> tone.|$|R
60|$|But {{to me it}} was a <b>serious</b> matter. <b>More</b> than <b>serious.</b> If I {{have done}} my work as {{historian}} with an adequate degree of skill, the reader should have gathered by this time the state of my feelings.|$|R
50|$|The Trans-Canada Network was the {{principal}} service of the CBC and focused <b>more</b> on <b>serious</b> programming such as news, public affairs, classical music and educational programming while the Dominion Network carried lighter, more commercial fare. However, both networks aired commercials.|$|R
5|$|A <b>more</b> <b>serious</b> fictional {{portrayal}} of McCarthy {{played a central}} role in the 1959 novel The Manchurian Candidate by Richard Condon. The character of Senator John Iselin, a demagogic anti-communist, is closely modeled on McCarthy, even to the varying numbers of Communists he asserts are employed by the federal government. He remains a major character in the 1962 film version.|$|E
5|$|Also like Bewick, many {{articles}} {{end with}} a tail-piece, a small engraving, but here again Yarrell shows himself to be both <b>more</b> <b>serious</b> and less merely decorative than Bewick, with more information to impart. The Egyptian vulture article ends with a large and accurate engraving of another specimen, so the article shows both a young and an old bird, with clearly different plumage which is also described in the text.|$|E
5|$|Although {{atherosclerosis}} {{occurs to}} a certain degree in all people, people with FH may develop accelerated atherosclerosis due to the excess level of LDL. The degree of atherosclerosis approximately depends on the number of LDL receptors still expressed and the functionality of these receptors. In many heterozygous forms of FH, the receptor function is only mildly impaired, and LDL levels will remain relatively low. In the <b>more</b> <b>serious</b> homozygous forms, the receptor is not expressed at all.|$|E
50|$|The Realist {{provided}} a format for extreme satire in its articles, cartoons and Krassner's editorials, {{but it also}} carried <b>more</b> traditionally <b>serious</b> material in articles and interviews. The magazine also published political commentary from Norman Mailer, Ken Kesey and Joseph Heller.|$|R
5|$|Among <b>more</b> {{obviously}} <b>serious</b> matters, Roberts {{pointed to}} the Herbert board's imposition of a rule that shop-floor employees, mostly if not all male, must wear pink uniforms as being typical of its distance from reality, fad-ism and tendency to make mountains of molehills.|$|R
50|$|A meatotomy may be {{extended}} to subincision or genital bisection, which are both much <b>more</b> complex and <b>serious</b> modifications.|$|R
5|$|At one point, {{the pair}} split up, but soon reunited. The {{relationship}} became <b>more</b> <b>serious</b> as she accompanied {{him in his}} efforts to break through in the music industry, and by 1979 they were discussing marriage, conditional upon his career becoming established. In the meantime she worked in a motor insurance company and in her father's electrical business.|$|E
5|$|At the Shanghai Golden Grand Prix, on 20 September 2009, Gay ran the second-fastest men's 100m on record, {{winning in}} 9.69seconds, {{matching}} Usain Bolt's winning {{time at the}} Beijing Olympics in 2008. After beating Powell for the sixth time in Daegu, Gay stated that he would reconsider his plans for groin surgery in the off-season as it was mainly a case of resolving discomfort when running, rather than a <b>more</b> <b>serious</b> injury.|$|E
5|$|Berry tackled a <b>more</b> <b>serious</b> role, {{playing a}} former drug addict {{struggling}} to regain {{custody of her}} son in Losing Isaiah (1995), starring opposite Jessica Lange.

50|$|In 2001, however, he dyed {{his hair}} black and {{took on a}} <b>more</b> subdued, <b>serious</b> role in Hur Jin-ho's One Fine Spring Day. Although it wasn't a big hit with audiences, his {{performance}} in this film opened many critics' eyes and drew widespread praise, while officially launching {{the second stage of}} his career.|$|R
5|$|Beyond the endemic {{internal}} power struggles, the TFG has faced far <b>more</b> <b>serious</b> problems in establishing its authority and rebuilding {{the structures of}} governance. Its writ has never extended much beyond Baidoa. Its control of Mogadishu is ever more contested, and it is largely under siege {{in the rest of}} the country. There are no properly functioning government institutions.|$|E
5|$|Both Lowell and Sexton {{encouraged}} Plath {{to write}} from her experience {{and she did}} so. She openly discussed her depression with Lowell and her suicide attempts with Sexton, who led her to write from a more female perspective. Plath began to conceive {{of herself as a}} <b>more</b> <b>serious,</b> focused poet and short-story writer. At this time Plath and Hughes first met the poet W. S. Merwin, who admired their work and was to remain a lifelong friend. Plath resumed psychoanalytic treatment in December, working with Ruth Beuscher.|$|E
5|$|Broadly speaking, Anons oppose Internet {{censorship}} and control, {{and the majority}} of their actions target governments, organizations, and corporations that they accuse of censorship. Anons were early supporters of the global Occupy movement and the Arab Spring. Since 2008, a frequent subject of disagreement within Anonymous is whether members should focus on pranking and entertainment or <b>more</b> <b>serious</b> (and, in some cases, political) activism.|$|E

50|$|<b>More</b> {{immediately}} <b>serious</b> was {{the opening}} of much larger amusement parks closer to London, on expansive sites and with ample vehicle parking.

At this time, the fastest train journey from London to Margate was just under two hours -and Dreamland has never had any public on-site parking.|$|R

5|$|Broadside {{armament}} {{also had}} disadvantages, which became <b>more</b> <b>serious</b> as ironclad technology developed. Heavier guns to penetrate ever-thicker armor meant that fewer guns could be carried. Furthermore, {{the adoption of}} ramming as an important tactic meant the need for ahead and all-round fire. These problems led to broadside designs being superseded by designs that gave greater all-round fire, which included central-battery, turret, and barbette designs.|$|E
5|$|Clashes in {{the capital}} between Habré's FAN and pro-Libyan groups became {{progressively}} <b>more</b> <b>serious.</b> On 22 March 1980, a minor incident, as in 1979, triggered the second battle of N'Djamena. In ten days, the clashes between the FAN and Goukouni's FAP, which both had 1,000–1,500 troops in the city, caused thousands of casualties and the flight of about half the capital's population. The few remaining French troops, who left on 4 May, proclaimed themselves neutral, as did the Zairean peace force.|$|E
5|$|Cluj-Napoca has {{a complex}} {{judicial}} organisation, {{as a consequence}} of its status of county capital. The Cluj-Napoca Court of Justice is the local judicial institution and is under the purview of the Cluj County Tribunal, which also exerts its jurisdiction over the courts of Dej, Gherla, Turda and Huedin. Appeals from these tribunals' verdicts, and <b>more</b> <b>serious</b> cases, are directed to the Cluj Court of Appeals. The city also hosts the county's commercial and military tribunals.|$|E
