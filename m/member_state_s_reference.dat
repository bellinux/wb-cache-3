40|$|This {{discussion}} paper {{led to a}} forthcoming publication in Journal of Regional Science entitled 'Are EU Countries less Integrated than US States? Theory and Evidence'. European economic integration is commonly believed to be incomplete, and that further reforms are needed. In this context, the union of U. <b>S.</b> <b>states</b> is considered the benchmark of complete economic integration and is often the basis for comparison regarding the extent of E. U economic integration. Yet, with low trade barriers and with productive factors at least notionally mobile across E. U. countries, {{is the belief that}} U. <b>S.</b> <b>states</b> are more integrated than E. U. <b>member</b> <b>states</b> correct? To address this question, this paper first develops three theoretical predictions about the distribution of output and factors that would arise among members of a fully integrated economic area in which goods, capital and labor are freely mobile and policies are harmonized. These theoretical predictions are then empirically tested using data on the output and factor stocks of 14 E. U. <b>member</b> <b>states</b> and the 51 U. <b>S.</b> <b>states</b> (includes District of Columbia) for the period 1965 to 2000. The empirical results convincingly support each theoretical prediction. Hence, contrary to popular belief, the extent of E. U. economic integration is not statistically different from that among U. <b>S.</b> <b>states.</b> Economic integration, capital mobility, factor price equalization, Brownian motion, Zipf’s law...|$|R

40|$|From the introduction]. My {{study will}} focus in {{particular}} on three claims {{made in the}} literature about <b>member</b> <b>state</b> interaction with the Court. The first claim is that <b>member</b> <b>state</b> participation was initially low and {{that much of the}} Court's constitutionalization of the Treaty occurred when <b>member</b> <b>states</b> were simply too inattentive to notice the magnitude of the Court's activity. The second claim is that early <b>member</b> <b>state</b> participation reflected a concern to protect national laws, but that this pattern of <b>member</b> <b>state</b> participation is changing as <b>member</b> <b>state</b> evince more of a desire to influence the general trend of Commmunity law. The final claim tested is that, with the Single European Act's change to qualified majority voting in the Council, member states' attitudes of acceptance toward the Court will change, and criticism of the Court will increase. This hypothesis is {{based on the belief that}} the supranationalism of the ECJ was accepted because of the intergovernmentalism of the Council. The data on <b>member</b> <b>state</b> participation suggests, however, that none of these claims provide an accurate picture of <b>member</b> <b>state</b> interaction with the Court. While there has been an increase in participation over time, <b>member</b> <b>states</b> have shown a high degree of participation in Article 177 cases from the outset. Further, trends in <b>member</b> <b>states</b> participation do not provide adequate empirical proof of a change in <b>member</b> <b>state</b> participation from self-interest to a Community interest.
