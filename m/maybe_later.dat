Then he wrote to the father, and told him frankly the whole story. The letter came back six months later, marked--'Gone away; left no address.' You see, what had happened was this: the old man died suddenly a month or two after the marriage, without ever having heard a word about it. The girl hadn't a relative or friend in the town, all her folks being French Canadians. She'd got her pride, and she'd got a sense of humour not common in a woman. I was with her at the Grand Central for over a year, and came to know her pretty well. She didn't choose to advertise the fact that her husband had run away from her, as she thought, an hour after he had married her. She knew he was a gentleman with rich relatives somewhere in England; and as the months went by without bringing word or sign of him, she concluded he'd thought the matter over and was ashamed of her. You must remember she was merely a child at the time, and hardly understood her position. <b>Maybe</b> <b>later</b> on she would have seen the necessity of doing something. But Chance, as it were, saved her the trouble; for she had not been serving in the Cafe more than a month when, early one afternoon, in walked her Lord and Master. 'Mam'sell Marie,' as of course we called her over there, was at that moment busy talking to two customers, while smiling at a third; and our hero, he gave a start the moment he set eyes on her." ...|$|E

Chandler jokes about everyone including Phoebe, making references to her being an alien from outer space in [...] "The One with All the Resolutions" [...] in Season 5. ("A plane? Better make it a space ship so you can get back to your home planet.") She seems to enjoy toying with him more as the seasons progress. In [...] "The One Where Everyone Finds Out", she tries to trick him into believing that she is attracted to him, but Monica tells him that Phoebe finds him charming in a [...] "sexless" [...] way, indicating that any hints towards romance are jokes. She and Chandler face off in a seduction match they both know is a farce, with Chandler visibly more shaken, though Phoebe is also uncomfortable. They share an awkward kiss and Chandler almost touches her breast but awkwardly moves his hand to her shoulder. He pulls away, saying that Phoebe has won and he is in love with Monica.On some occasions, Phoebe jokes that she has romantic feelings for Chandler, as in [...] "The One Where Ross Meets Elizabeth's Dad" [...] when Phoebe tells Chandler that she will be waiting for him to make a move on her.

Chandler gives Phoebe away when she marries Mike, although Chandler is the only member of the group available; originally, Joey would have given her away but he is called on to perform the ceremony (he was ordained online for Monica and Chandler's wedding in season 7). Chandler tells her that she looks [...] "beautiful", and she seems happy, waving and saying [...] "Hi, new dad!". He and Monica play a role in getting Mike and Phoebe back together in Barbados.

Much to Chandler's embarrassment, the baby named Chandler turns out to be a girl, whom Alice calls [...] "Channy Fanny".Phoebe is the initial reason that Chandler quit smoking in [...] "The One With the Thumb", after an argument between the group about his smoking.
