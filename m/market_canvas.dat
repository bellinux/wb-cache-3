50|$|On January 31, 2011, Canvas officially opened, {{sending out}} invitations to users who had {{previously}} signed up to receive updates. In March 2011, Canvas made its discussion threads viewable by users who were not registered, while remaining in closed beta status. In early 2011, Poole began to virally <b>market</b> <b>Canvas</b> on sites such as Reddit. Canvas moved from private beta to open beta on September 6, 2011, at which point Poole reported that over fifty thousand users had registered during the private beta period. On January 21, 2014, the Canvas blog announced that the site was shutting down. The Canvas team promised that users {{would be able to}} download their contributions to the site in the near future, and proposed the possibility of an archive of the site's old threads.|$|E

40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the effects of}} go-shop provisions on targets and bidders in merger agreements. We document that go-shop provisions have higher deal synergies and higher positive wealth effect on targets than no-shop deals. Further, go-shop provisions {{have a significant impact}} on the behavior of initial bidders but have no effect on bidders ’ wealth. The go-shop period, the number of potential buyers contacted, the number of confidentiality agreements entered, and bifurcated termination fee structures are important determinants of deal outcomes.

40|$|Along {{with the}} private equity boom in the mid- 2000 s emerged a new M 2 ̆ 6 A deal {{technology}} - the 2 ̆ 2 go-shop 2 ̆ 2 provision. In this paper, I address the question whether go-shop provisions are utilized by target managers to pursue private benefits or are used to protect the fiduciary interests of the target shareholder. I investigate the effectiveness of go-shop provisions by empirically testing two competing hypotheses: (a) the window-dressing hypothesis, and (b) the shareholder interest hypothesis. This is the first study {{to shed light on}} the impact of go-shop provisions on the wealth of both the target and the bidder shareholders, and thereby provide evidence on the synergies associated with such deal provisions. I also provide evidence on how go-shop provisions affect the initial acquirer 2 ̆ 7 s bidding behavior, an important issue that has been overlooked in previous literature. In addition, this study examines go-shop deal characteristics that are important in determining the wealth effect as well as deal outcomes. I document that go-shop deals have higher deal synergies and higher positive wealth effect on targets than no-shop deals. Further, although go-shop provisions have no effect on bidders 2 ̆ 7 wealth, they pressure the initial bidders to raise the initial offers to protect the deals. I also show that the go-shop deals {{are more likely to be}} terminated compared with no-shop deals. To address concerns regarding endogeneity and selection bias, I employ Heckman two-stage procedure and propensity score matching method to confirm the findings. The go-shop period, the number of potential buyers contacted, the number of confidentiality agreements entered, and bifurcated termination fee structures are important determinants of deal outcomes. Specifically, the market reacts positively to the bifurcated fee structure in go-shop provisions. The number of potential buyers contacted and the number of confidentiality agreements entered during the go-shop period play an important role in pressuring the initial bidder to raise the original offer price, while the length of the go-shop period and the number of confidentiality agreements entered predict the likelihood of the initial bid success. The findings support the shareholder interest theory and suggest that go-shop provisions are an effective <b>market</b> <b>canvas</b> alternative to public auctions...|$|E

50|$|During the interwar period, {{athletic}} shoes {{began to be}} marketed for different sports, and differentiated designs were made available for men and women. Athletic shoes were used by competing athletes at the Olympics, helping to popularise {{athletic shoes}} among the general public. In 1936, a French brand, Spring Court, <b>marketed</b> the first <b>canvas</b> tennis shoe featuring signature eight ventilation channels on a vulcanised natural rubber sole.|$|R
50|$|Bensimon {{has been}} in the European market for thirty years. The French brand is now {{available}} on the U.S. <b>market</b> with its <b>canvas</b> shoe collection, La tennis Bensimon. As a surplus brand, Bensimon's mission for La tennis Bensimon was to combine simplicity with luxury. The sneaker made out of basic fabrics and rubber, is 100% natural. It is easy to care for, as you can throw it in the washing machine and dryer.|$|R

Instructure's approach to MOOC has been to facilitate experimentation with pedagogy and new ways to use multimedia environments to change cognition and enhance the learning process. One example is [...] "Gender Through Comic Books," [...] a MOOC taught by Ball State University's Christina Blanch on Canvas Network that used lessons from pop culture to explore evolving social norms and other anthropological ideals.|$|R
50|$|Taiwan hosts {{numerous}} night {{markets in}} each of its major cities. The larger and more formal of these markets might take place in purpose-built marketplaces while smaller or more informal ones tend to occupy streets or roads that are normal thoroughfares by day. The temporal night markets (ones that are not housed in any permanent structure) are actually consistent in their location; in most large cities, {{they are on a}} smaller street parallel and close (a block or two away) to the primary street of that city. Though the temporal night market stalls appear at night and then vanish by day, the vendors usually return to the same location the next evening. Night markets do not close, but the individual stalls may randomly take days off due to holidays, family illness, etc. Most temporal stalls within a night <b>market</b> have white <b>canvas</b> tops and bright lights. This gives the temporary night markets a fantastical, carnival-like atmosphere.|$|R
