40|$|This study {{considers}} the conceptual space, or extent of autonomy, given to coursework Masters students before, {{during and after}} a Business Ethics course that explicitly developed and assessed their research skills. This vocationally oriented and academically challenging course used the Research Skill Development framework as its conceptual <b>model</b> <b>to</b> <b>reshape</b> the learning and assessment environment, articulating to students not only the research skills required, but also clarifying the resulting autonomy in their research-orientated learning. In the study, seven students attended semi-structured interviews and transcript analysis of interviews revealed the level of student-declared autonomy before commencing coursework Masters, while completing the Business Ethics course, and {{near the end of}} their Masters degree. All of the students interviewed were studying part-time and working part-time, and so the applicability of the research skills to students’ work environment emerged as a major issue of interest. This paper richly represents the students’ perceptions, and is the first paper to directly address coursework Masters student autonomy in research in a longitudinal manner; as such it provides a deep and nuanced understanding of the conceptual space that students need for success in study and as preparation for employment.

40|$|Designers use {{computational}} {{fluid dynamics}} (CFD) to gain {{greater understanding of the}} fluid flow phenomena involved in components being designed. They also use finite element analysis (FEA) as a tool to help gain greater understanding of the structural response of components to loads, stresses and strains, and the prediction of failure modes. Automated CFD and FEA engineering design has centered on shape optimization, which has been hindered by two major problems: 1) inadequate shape parameterization algorithms, and 2) inadequate algorithms for CFD and FEA grid modification. Working with software engineers at Stennis Space Center, a NASA commercial partner, Optimal Solutions Software LLC, was able to utilize its revolutionary, one-of-a-kind arbitrary shape deformation (ASD) capability-a major advancement in solving these two aforementioned problems-to optimize the shapes of complex pipe components that transport highly sensitive fluids. The ASD technology solves the problem of inadequate shape parameterization algorithms by allowing the CFD designers to freely create their own shape parameters, therefore eliminating the restriction of only being able to use the computer-aided design (CAD) parameters. The problem of inadequate algorithms for CFD grid modification is solved {{by the fact that the}} new software performs a smooth volumetric deformation. This eliminates the extremely costly process of having to remesh the grid for every shape change desired. The program can perform a design change in a markedly reduced amount of time, a process that would traditionally involve the designer returning to the CAD <b>model</b> <b>to</b> <b>reshape</b> and then remesh the shapes, something that has been known to take hours, days-even weeks or months-depending upon the size of the model...|$|E
25|$|Ken Barlow (William Roache) {{entered the}} storyline {{as a young}} radical, {{reflecting}} the youth of 1960s Britain, where figures like the Beatles, the Rolling Stones and the <b>model</b> Twiggy were <b>to</b> <b>reshape</b> the concept of youthful rebellion. Though {{the rest of the}} original Barlow family were killed off {{before the end of the}} 1970s, Ken, who for 27 years was the only character from the first episode remaining, has remained the constant link throughout the entire series. In 2011, Dennis Tanner (Philip Lowrie), another character from the first episode, returned to Coronation Street after a 43-year absence. Since 1984, Ken Barlow had been the show's only remaining original character, although Emily Bishop (Eileen Derbyshire) has remained in the series since first appearing in late January 1961, when the show was just weeks old, and is the show's longest-serving female character.|$|R
40|$|We setup a {{mechanically}} based {{finite element}} <b>model</b> <b>to</b> evaluate {{the change in}} the shape of the human cornea induced by ablation of stromal tissue. By considering the deformability of the cornea, the model computes the change of the dioptric power resulting from ablative laser surgery. We use a previously developed 3 -D finite element model of the human cornea (Pandolfi and Manganiello in Biomech Model Mechanobiol 5 : 237 - 246, 2006). The solid geometry is discretized into finite elements by an automatic procedure which recovers the unloaded configuration. The geometry is defined in parametric form and can be characterized by individual geometrical data when available. A two-fiber reinforced hyperelastic material model, which accounts for the organization of the anisotropic collagen structure, is adopted to describe the stromal tissue. For the simulation of laser refractive surgery of myopic and astigmatic eyes, a geometrical correction of the corneal profile is included into the code. We show two examples of application of the <b>model</b> <b>to</b> the <b>reshaping</b> of a myopic and an astigmatic eye. Numerical results provide the postoperative shape of the cornea, the corrected refractive power, and the distribution of the stress throughout the stromal tissue...|$|R
40|$|The {{domestication}} {{of plants}} and animals marks {{one of the most significant}} transitions in human, and indeed global, history. Traditionally, study of the domestication process was the exclusive domain of archaeologists and agricultural scientists; today it is an increasingly multidisciplinary enterprise that has come to involve the skills of evolutionary biologists and geneticists. Although the application of new information sources and methodologies has dramatically transformed our ability to study and understand domestication, it has also generated increasingly large and complex datasets, the interpretation of which is not straightforward. In particular, challenges of equifinality, evolutionary variance, and emergence of unexpected or counter-intuitive patterns all face researchers attempting to infer past processes directly from patterns in data. We argue that explicit modeling approaches, drawing upon emerging methodologies in statistics and population genetics, provide a powerful means of addressing these limitations. Modeling also offers an approach to analyzing datasets that avoids conclusions steered by implicit biases, and makes possible the formal integration of different data types. Here we outline some of the modeling approaches most relevant to current problems in domestication research, and demonstrate the ways in which simulation <b>modeling</b> is beginning <b>to</b> <b>reshape</b> our understanding of the domestication process...|$|R

This work presents a new and alternative design methodology that explores three-dimensional (3 -D) solution space by combining fuzzy membership functions <b>to</b> <b>model</b> and <b>reshape</b> the coil structure, given the magnetic field and electrical and mechanical constraints. The approach includes a stream function generator, a 3 -D coil structure generator, and the evaluation of an objective function.

The method was applied to design a short, unshielded asymmetric gradient coil for breast imaging. The resulting dome-shape coil has superior gradient performance compared to a standard fingerprint coil. New quadrupolar gradient coil designs for breast imaging can also be obtained with the proposed method. The paper concludes with a study of the influence of a number of design parameters on the coil performance...|$|R
