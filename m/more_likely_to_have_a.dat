25|$|Individuals who are atopic (genetically {{predisposed}} to developing certain allergic hypersensitivity reactions) are <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> reaction to eggplant, {{which may be}} because eggplant is high in histamines.

However, sexual activity is multifactoral, and androgenic profile {{is not the only}} determining factor in baldness. Additionally, because hair loss is progressive and free testosterone declines with age, a male's hairline may be more indicative of his past than his present disposition.|$|E

Modi invited all the other leaders of SAARC countries to the ceremony where he {{was sworn in as}} prime minister. He was the first Indian prime minister to do so. Observers have stated that due to Modi portraying himself as a strong and nationalist leader during his election campaign, he would be politically unable to follow a policy of restraint that India had previously followed after terrorist attacks, and is <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> military response.|$|E

25|$|Studies as {{far back}} as 1987 show that female sex hormones {{have an effect on the}} {{recovery}} of traumatic brain injury. In these studies, it was first observed that pseudopregnant female rats had reduced edema after traumatic brain injury. Recent clinical trials have shown that among patients that have suffered moderate traumatic brain injury, those that have been treated with progesterone are <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> better outcome than those who have not. A number of additional animal studies have confirmed that progesterone has neuroprotective effects when administered shortly after traumatic brain injury. Encouraging results have also been reported in human clinical trials.|$|E
25|$|Data {{indicate}} that the diagnosis of BPD is more variable over time than the DSM implies. Substantial percentages (for example around a third, depending on criteria) of people diagnosed with BPD achieve remission {{within a year or}} two. A longitudinal study found that, six years after being diagnosed with BPD, 56 percent showed good psychosocial functioning, compared to 26 percent at baseline. Although vocational achievement was more limited even compared to those with other personality disorders, those whose symptoms had remitted were significantly <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> good relationship with a spouse/partner and at least one parent, good work/school performance, a sustained work/school history, good global functioning and good psychosocial functioning.|$|E
25|$|The 20 {{amino acids}} {{translated}} by {{the genetic code}} vary greatly by the {{physical and chemical properties}} of their side chains. However, these amino acids can be categorised into groups with similar physicochemical properties. Substituting an amino acid with another from the same category is <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> smaller impact on the structure and function of a protein than replacement with an amino acid from a different category. Consequently, acceptance of point mutations depends heavily on the amino acid being replaced in the mutation, and the replacement amino acid. The PAM matrices are a mathematical tool that account for these varying rates of acceptance when evaluating the similarity of proteins during alignment.|$|E

25|$|Twin studies, {{adoption}} studies, {{and artificial}} selection {{studies have shown}} that a person's genes can predispose them to developing alcoholism. Evidence from twin studies show that concordance rates for alcoholism are higher for monozygotic twins than dizygotic twins—76% for monozygotic twins and 61% for dizygotic twins. However, female twin studies demonstrate that females have much lower concordance rates than males. Reasons for gender differences may be due to environmental factors, such as negative public attitudes towards female drinkers. Twin studies suggest that males are <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> genetic predisposition for alcoholism. However, this does not suggest that a male who does have a genetic predisposition will become an alcoholic. Sometimes the individual may never encounter an environmental trigger that leads to alcoholism.|$|E
25|$|Interracial {{marriage}} among Filipinos is common, as {{they have}} {{the largest number of}} interracial marriages among Asian immigrant groups in California, only Japanese Americans have a higher rate nationally. Compared to other Asian Americans, Filipinos Americans are <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> Hispanic spouse. Statistically, Filipino American {{women are more likely to}} marry outside of their ethnicity (38.9 percent) than Filipino American men (17.6 percent); other Asian American populations have lower rates of marrying outside of their race than both Filipino American men and women. Between 2008 and 2010, 48 percent of Filipino American marriages were with non-Asians. It is also noted that 21.8 percent of Filipino Americans are multiracial, second among Asian Americans. Depending on their parentage, multiracial Filipino Americans may refer to themselves as Mestizo, Tsinoy, Blackapino, and Mexipino.|$|E
25|$|Novelty acts (such as shower shows, fire shows, and oil wrestling) can be {{presented}} on dedicated stages, temporary staging on the floor, {{or on the}} main stage itself depending on the club. The main stage, if used, must be prepared and possibly covered to prevent damage, as accidents and injuries have been reported during these types of striptease performances. When dangerous materials such as fire are used as props a permit {{may be required to}} be compliant with local ordinances. Novelty acts are typically performed by feature dancers or by select house dancers during a featured performance.
