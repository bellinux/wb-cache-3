50|$|A {{loading bay}} is {{a room in}} a theatre which is usually quite large. It {{generally}} has a bay door (a large metal door which rolls up, at least {{the size of the}} opening on a standard semi-trailer) at opposite sides of the room, one for a truck and the other for access to the stage. Sometimes sets and equipment for a traveling show are delivered through a bay, other times, the bay could be used for delivery of supplies and lumber for set construction. In a smaller theaters, the bay may serve as a theater, green room, or scene shop.In most union work, teamsters <b>and</b> grips who <b>unload</b> trucks <b>and</b> move equipment are different from the carpenters, electricians, and other stagehands who assemble a show. By Union rules, generally teamsters are not permitted to work on the actual performance, and the stagehands are not allowed to even enter trucks. This exists primarily because loading <b>and</b> <b>unloading</b> <b>trailers</b> {{is one of the most}} dangerous jobs in theatre and performance.|$|R
50|$|A {{grain hopper}} trailer is a trailer pulled by a semi tractor {{and used to}} haul bulk {{commodity}} products (such as grain).

2500|$|In the mid-1930s, the Chicago Great Western Railway {{and then}} the New Haven Railroad began [...] "piggyback" [...] service (transporting highway freight {{trailers}} on flatcars) limited to their own railroads. [...] The Chicago Great Western Railway filed a US federal patent in 1938 on their method of securing each trailer to a flatcar using chains and turnbuckles. [...] Other components included wheel chocks and ramps for loading <b>and</b> <b>unloading</b> the <b>trailers</b> from the flatcars. [...] By 1953, the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy, the Chicago and Eastern Illinois, and the Southern Pacific railroads had joined the innovation. Most of the railcars used were surplus flatcars equipped with new decks. By 1955, an additional 25 railroads had begun some form of piggyback trailer service.|$|R
50|$|Motorcycle {{carrying}} trailers may be open or enclosed. They may be wide, for two machines side-by-side, or narrow, {{for just}} a single machine. The main features that distinguish them from other flatbed or enclosed trailers are track(s) to keep the wheels from sliding side to side and sufficient tiedown points to keep the motorcycle(s) from tipping. They may also tilt, or include ramp(s) to facilitate the loading <b>and</b> <b>unloading</b> of motorcycles. <b>Trailer</b> manufacturers often offer trailers specifically designed for carrying motorcycles.|$|R
50|$|The {{research}} in expending and applying the ICAM definitions have proceeded.

MHRC's {{research in}}volves expanding the integrated computer-aided manufacturing definition (IDEF) approach to include the information flow as well as the material flow needed to support a manufacturing enterprise, as well as models to handle unscheduled events such as machine breakdowns or material shortages. Past research resulted in software to automatically palletize random-size packages, a system to automatically load <b>and</b> <b>unload</b> truck <b>trailers,</b> <b>and</b> an integrated production control system to fabricate optical fibers.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a novel connection system which allows fast, {{safe and reliable}} coupling and uncoupling of two sections of a freight wagon body {{as part of a}} bimodal transport system. The connection system allows the time for loading <b>and</b> <b>unloading</b> a truck <b>trailer</b> to be reduced to almost one-half of the current duration. The connection system is composed of a cylindrical clamping pin with three conical shoulders at one end and an axial slide. A crank mechanism in a cylindrical guide is used to lock the clamp. The crank is connected to the pin and symmetric piston rods are connected to the moving clamp, other auxiliary members constrain the clamp. ?? IMechE 2013...|$|R

40|$|AbstractA {{special wagon}} {{with a low}} {{rotatable}} loading platform for transportation of truck vehicles by rail was developed in Military University of Technology in the Department of Mechanics and Applied Computer Science in Warsaw. The essence of such reloading is to place the semitrailer on a special rotatable platform {{with the use of}} a truck tractor. The structure can be used for transportation of different types of vehicles such as tractors, trucks, trailers, semitrailers and cargo containers. The wagon allows quick and fast loading <b>and</b> <b>unloading</b> without any platform infrastructure or terminals. An intermodal transport system based on an innovative concept of the railway wagon, which will use the national railway infrastructure, was developed. The process of loading <b>and</b> <b>unloading</b> the <b>trailers</b> can be performed considering a whole train or individual wagons from any part of the train (no cranes needed). This type of railway wagon will allow transport companies to save time and money for road transport. The advantages of this construction are reduction of the negative impact on the environment as well as an increase of road safety by reducing the number of vehicles on the roads. As part of the work on the wagon and the intermodal transport system, a strength test of the wagon structure was carried out and the effort of the basic components of a the wagon and a complete structure was estimated. For this purpose, numerical analysis was used...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: Polymeric {{composites}} exhibit highly nonlinear {{and rate}} dependent behavior during loading <b>and</b> <b>unloading</b> in off-axis directions. In this study, off-axis specimens {{were used to}} study this behavior in AS 4 /PEEK thermoplastic composite. The equilibrium states of stress during loading <b>and</b> <b>unloading</b> were determined by stress–relaxation and stress–recovery tests, respectively. It {{was found that the}} equilibrium stress–strain curves for loading <b>and</b> <b>unloading</b> are basically the same for the same loading–unloading rate. A one-parameter plasticity model was used to generate a master equilibrium plastic stress–strain curve for both loading <b>and</b> <b>unloading.</b> Stress relaxation curves and recovery curves were obtained during loading <b>and</b> <b>unloading</b> cycles, respectively, for various strain rates. Similarity between relaxation and recovery curves was noted, and the effective stress defined from the one-parameter plastic potential function was able to describe both curves.
