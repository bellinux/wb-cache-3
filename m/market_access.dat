5|$|On 6 September 2012, the ECB {{announced}} to offer additional financial {{support in the}} form of some yield-lowering bond purchases (OMT), for all eurozone countries involved in a sovereign state bailout program from EFSF/ESM. A eurozone country can benefit from the program if -and for as long as- it is found to suffer from stressed bond yields at excessive levels; but only at the point of time where the country possesses/regains a complete <b>market</b> <b>access</b> -and only if the country still complies with all terms in the signed Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) agreement. Countries receiving a precautionary programme rather than a sovereign bailout will, by definition, have complete <b>market</b> <b>access</b> and thus qualify for OMT support if also suffering from stressed interest rates on its government bonds. In regards of countries receiving a sovereign bailout (Ireland, Portugal and Greece), they will on the other hand not qualify for OMT support before they have regained complete <b>market</b> <b>access,</b> which will normally only happen after having received the last scheduled bailout disbursement. Despite none OMT programmes were ready to start in September/October, the financial markets straight away took notice of the additionally planned OMT packages from ECB, and started slowly to price-in a decline of both short-term and long-term interest rates in all European countries previously suffering from stressed and elevated interest levels (as OMTs were regarded as an extra potential back-stop to counter the frozen liquidity and highly stressed rates; and just the knowledge about their potential existence {{in the very near future}} helped to calm the markets).|$|E

5|$|In December 1999, President Fernando de la Rúa took office, seeking {{assistance}} from the IMF shortly thereafter. In March 2000, the IMF agreed to a three-year $7.2 billion stand-by arrangement with Argentina, conditioned on a strict fiscal adjustment and the assumption of 3.5% GDP growth in 2000 (actual growth was 0.5%). In late 2000, Argentina began to experience severely diminished access to capital markets, as reflected in a sharp and sustained rise in spreads on Argentine bonds over U.S. Treasuries. In December, The de la Rua government announced a $40 billion multilateral assistance package organized by IMF. The uneven implementation of fiscal adjustments and reforms, a worsening global macroeconomic environment, and political instability led to {{the complete loss of}} <b>market</b> <b>access</b> and intensified capital flight by the second quarter of 2001. Argentine debt, held mostly in bonds, was massively sold short and the government found itself unable to borrow or meet debt payments.|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research is}} (1) to analyse the margin, profits, and eficiency of Rubber marketing, (2) to find which <b>marketing</b> <b>access</b> is the most profitable for the rubber farmer, (3) to find the relation of the farmers with the marketing institutes or merchants, and (4) to identify the problems faced by the farmers and merchants in rubber marketing. The writer used survey method to collect the data. There were two kinds of respondent in this research taken by using Snaw Ball method; the farmers and the merchants. Those samples consisted of 75 rubber farmers and 12 merchants. The research findings show that the total of margins are Rp 8. 000, 00 /kg at <b>marketing</b> <b>access</b> 1 and Rp 6. 500, 00 /kg in <b>marketing</b> <b>access</b> 2. The efficiencies of marketing are 19 % in the <b>marketing</b> <b>access</b> 1, by the profits of Rp 7, 733. 00 /kg obtained by the farmers but 17 % in <b>marketing</b> <b>access</b> 2 by the higher profits of Rp 8, 907. 81 /kg. The problems faced by the farmers are getting into debt (33, 67 %), and the lowest comes from the less available fertilizer. (3. 33 %). The problems faced by the merchants in <b>marketing</b> <b>access</b> 1 are cost rivalry (50, 00 %), the destroyed road and the highly water contained (33. 34 %).
