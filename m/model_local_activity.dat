40|$|Probabilistic topic {{models have}} {{recently}} been used for activity analysis in video processing, due to their strong capacity to <b>model</b> both <b>local</b> <b>activities</b> and interactions in crowded scenes. In those applications, a video sequence is divided into a collection of uniform non-overlaping video clips, and the high dimensional continuous inputs are quantized into a bag of discrete visual words. The hard division of video clips, and hard assignment of visual words leads to problems when an activity is split over multiple clips, or the most appropriate visual word for quantization is unclear. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm, which makes use of a soft histogram technique {{to compensate for the}} loss of information in the quantization process; and a soft cut technique in the temporal domain to overcome problems caused by separating an activity into two video clips. In the detection process, we also apply a soft decision strategy to detect unusual events. We show that the proposed soft decision approach outperforms its hard decision counterpart in both <b>local</b> and global <b>activity</b> <b>modelling...</b>|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} the dynamic relationship between local government revenues and expenditures in Sweden. Results from {{a panel of}} 265 municipalities covered over the time period 1974 - 87 show that (i) expenditures cause revenues, while revenues do not cause expenditures, (ii) intergovernmental grants both cause and are caused by expenditures and revenues, (iii) lags of four years are needed to describe the dynamics among the fiscal variables and (iv) {{the parameters of the}} expenditures equation are time varying. These results cast doubt on static <b>modeling</b> of <b>local</b> government <b>activities</b> and on models imposing time invariant parameters without ever testing for it. ...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{motion of}} flagella and cilia {{arises from the}} coordinated {{activity}} of dynein motor protein molecules arrayed along microtubule doublets that span the length of axoneme (the flagellar cytoskeleton). Dynein activity causes relative sliding between the doublets, which generates propulsive bending of the flagellum. The mechanism of dynein coordination remains incompletely understood, {{although it has been}} the focus of many studies, both theoretical and experimental. In one leading hypothesis, known as the geometric clutch (GC) <b>model,</b> <b>local</b> dynein <b>activity</b> is thought to be controlled by interdoublet separation. The GC model has been implemented as a numerical simulation in which the behavior of a discrete set of rigid links in viscous fluid, driven by active elements, was approximated using a simplified time-marching scheme. A continuum mechanical model and associated partial differential equations of the GC model have remained lacking. Such equations would provide insight into the underlying biophysics, enable mathematical analysis of the behavior, and facilitate rigorous comparison to other models. In this article, the equations of motion for the flagellum and its doublets are derived from mechanical equilibrium principles and simple constitutive models. These equations are analyzed to reveal mechanisms of wave propagation and instability in the GC model. With parameter values in the range expected for Chlamydomonas flagella, solutions to the fully nonlinear equations closely resemble observed waveforms. These results support the ability of the GC hypothesis to explain dynein coordination in flagella and provide a mathematical foundation for comparison to other leading models...|$|R
40|$|Conventional {{models of}} {{multinational}} corporation (MNC) related spillovers in host economies {{assume that they}} derive from the technological assets created at the headquarters. Subsidiaries' activities in the host economy are not given any role in this process. In this paper, drawing on recent advances in MNC literature, we propose an alternative model. In this alternative <b>model</b> the <b>local</b> innovative <b>activity</b> of subsidiaries plays {{a critical role in}} accounting for both the possibility of positive or negative effects. More specifically, we distinguish between three types of subsidiaries: "competence creating", "competence exploiting" and passive; and explore conceptually and empirically the spillover effects of each type. Our results confirm our predictions that, in less advanced contexts such as India, only creative subsidiaries {{have a positive effect on}} host country firms; that competence exploiting subsidiaries generate negative effects when domestic firms are more advanced; and passive subsidiaries have no effects. The implications for theory and policy are discussed. ...|$|R
40|$|To {{study and}} {{characterize}} the in vivo {{effect of the}} lectin from Luetzelburgia auriculata seed on acute inflammation models. The lectin was purified from the crude saline extract by affinity chromatography on a guar-gum matrix. Native, heat-treated, and digested lectin was evaluated for anti-inflammatory activity by using peritonitis and paw edema models. The anti-inflammatory activity was characterized by intravital microscopy, nitric oxide production, and myeloperoxidase activity. The lectin exhibited anti-inflammatory activity (2 mg/kg) on both <b>models,</b> reducing <b>local</b> myeloperoxidase <b>activity.</b> Galactose or heat treatment (100 A degrees C, 10 min) reduced anti-inflammatory action. Anti-inflammation involves the inhibition of adhesion and rolling of leukocytes along with augmentation of nitric oxide in serum. The lectin inhibited the edematogenic effect of histamine and prostaglandins (PGE 2) but did not alter the chemoattractant effect of IL- 8. The results indicate that this lectin is a potent anti-inflammatory molecule. Its effects engage diverse modulatory events.

40|$|Abstract. Sensor {{networks}} play {{an increasing}} role in several disciplines like security surveillance or environmental monitoring. A challenge of such systems is integration of observations from individual nodes into a common semantic representation of their environment. In this paper, an approach for establishing such a global view is presented, solely by correlating local information learned {{at the level}} of each sensing unit. Each node has two modes of processing environment information: it learns the “usual ” events and “objects “ in its environment by means of probabilistic methods and it uses a set of predefined rules to detect standard situations that are uncommon or possibly dangerous. In the ongoing implementation of a security surveillance system, <b>models</b> of <b>local</b> <b>activity</b> at each node are inferred by processing video and audio data from its sensors, which are, for our test application, a camera and a microphone array. A local processing stack at each node serves to reduce spurious data from the sensors, to learn typical behavior and to detect unusual behavior by means of statistical techniques as well as predefined alarm situations by means of rule-based approaches. Communication with the neighbor nodes by means of a wireless network is used to build a shared understanding of the environment. The correlations of events and modalities among nodes are learned in order to establish neighborhood correspondences. The shared knowledge between neighbor nodes is used to enrich the local description of the learned normality. This can be used to establish paths over sensing zone boundaries o...|$|R
40|$|Part 3 : Short PapersInternational audienceThe aim of {{this work}} is to {{identify}} a set of fundamental rules that govern the interactions within urban systems at the metropolitan scale. For that, we developed an USM (Urban Simulation Model) specifically designed to study the evolution and dynamics of systems of cities. Our model is innovative in its structure: it is a superposition of cellular automata and agent based modeling approaches (that are essentially spatial analyses) and a complex network approach (that is essentially a topological analysis). This implies that in our <b>model,</b> the <b>local</b> <b>activities</b> and interaction of agents give rise to the global urban structure and network that in turn affects the agents’ cognition, behavior, movement and action {{in the city and}} so on in circular causality. The model simulates commuting patterns of agents within a metropolis. The agents in our model represent workers who look for working places, the nodes represent urban employment centers, and the links represent commuters. Our results address three issues: the first suggests that the perception of urban boundaries plays {{a significant role in the}} metropolitan evolution in terms of network topology. This means that the existence of business centers, located in proximity to each other (but belonging to different municipalities) may lead to the emergence of new centers at the metropolis scale. The second issue concerns urban segregation; our results suggest that the location preferences of the agents regarding proximity to similar/different agents have a major affect not only on the urban morphology but also on the topology of the urban network. The third and last issue concerns the size distributions of agents in our model; these distributions correspond to all types of homogenous distributions observed in real system of cities...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{two local}} activity-tuned {{filtering}} frameworks are proposed for noise removal and image smoothing, where the <b>local</b> <b>activity</b> measurement {{is given by}} the clipped and normalized local variance or standard deviation. The first framework is a modified anisotropic diffusion for noise removal of piece-wise smooth image.

Both frameworks employ the division of gradient and the <b>local</b> <b>activity</b> measurement to achieve noise removal.
