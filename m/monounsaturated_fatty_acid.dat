40|$|In {{this article}} the {{chemical}} composition for 3 types of animal fats (pork fat, beef tallow and buffalo tallow), following the variation of saturated and unsaturated <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> proportion during freezing storage was studied.

Department of Human Biology, Limburg University, Maastricht, The Netherlands. Effects of <b>monounsaturated</b> <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> on serum total cholesterol levels in man are {{often described as}} 'neutral'. The term neutral, however, is often misinterpreted. It {{does not mean that}} one can simply add monounsaturates to the diet without changing the serum total cholesterol level but that, under iso-caloric conditions, <b>monounsaturated</b> <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> have similar effects on serum total cholesterol as carbohydrates. Diets high in <b>monounsaturated</b> <b>fatty</b> <b>acids,</b> however, have a more favourable effect on the distribution of cholesterol over the various lipoproteins as compared with diets high in carbohydrates. Thus, the term neutral is misleading. In addition, in contrast with earlier studies, recent studies suggest that at realistic intakes, polyunsaturates and monounsaturates have comparable effects on serum lipoprotein levels. At present, there is no unequivocal explanation to resolve this discrepancy. However, these findings offer subjects on cholesterol-lowering diets a larger choice of food items to choose from to replace products high in the serum cholesterol-raising saturated <b>fatty</b> <b>acids...</b>|$|R

5000|$|Gram-negative {{bacteria}} {{are a major}} component of the plant rhizosphere and improve plant growth by increasing solubility of phosphate, producing ionophore compounds that increase uptake of iron or other minerals and may produce antifungal compounds. [...] Gram-negative bacteria produce high levels of monounsaturated fatty acids (e.g. 16:1 omega-7 and 18:1 omega-9) during active metabolism but convert much of the unsaturated fatty acid composition to cyclopropane fatty acids (e.g. 17:0 cyclopropane and 19:0 cyclopropane) when metabolism and cell division slow due to shortage of nutrition or other stress. Thus, in PLFA analysis, the sum of monounsaturated and cyclopropane fatty acids may provide an estimate of the abundance of Gram-negative bacteria.

50|$|The {{chemical}} composition for fats {{differs from that}} of carbohydrates in that fats contain considerably fewer oxygen atoms in proportion to atoms of carbon and hydrogen. When listed on nutritional information tables, fats are generally divided into six categories: total fats, saturated fatty acid, polyunsaturated fatty acid, <b>monounsaturated</b> <b>fatty</b> <b>acid,</b> dietary cholesterol, and trans fatty acid. From a basal metabolic or resting metabolic perspective, more energy is needed to burn a saturated fatty acid than an unsaturated fatty acid. The fatty acid molecule is broken down and categorized {{based on the number of}} carbon atoms in its molecular structure. The chemical equation for metabolism of the twelve to sixteen carbon atoms in a saturated fatty acid molecule shows the difference between metabolism of carbohydrates and fatty acids.

5000|$|Phospholipid {{fatty acids}} (PLFA) are an {{essential}} structural component of all microbial cellular membranes. PLFA analysis {{is a technique}} widely used for estimation of the total biomass and to observe broad changes in the community composition of the living microbiota of soil and aqueous environments. There has been a surge of interest in PLFAs in recent years, evident from the large increase in peer-reviewed journal references on the subject. However, there is increasing concern that some researchers are assigning PLFAs to specific microbial classes when in fact those PLFAs are present in {{a broad range of}} life forms. [...] Phospholipids can occur in many biological classes (such as in plant roots, fungi, as well as in soil bacteria), so care has to be taken in over-assigning PLFA biomarkers to the wrong class. Even though phospholipids occur in many different life forms, the fatty acid side chains between differing life forms can be quite unique. Polyunsaturated fatty acids (e.g. 18:3 ω3c) are found in plants, algae and cyanobacteria, but are often not present in bacteria. Monounsaturated fatty acids (particularly at the omega-7 position), odd-chain saturated fatty acids (e.g. 15:0), branched-chain fatty acids (mainly iso/anetiso and 10-methyl) and cyclopropane fatty acids (e.g. 19:0 cyclo ω7c) are mostly synthesized by bacteria. The <b>monounsaturated</b> <b>fatty</b> <b>acid,</b> 16:1 ω5c, is mostly synthesized by Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) and the polyunsaturated fatty acid, 18:2 ω6c (Linoleic acid), is mostly synthesized by Ectomycorrhizal fungi.|$|E

[...] While not involving G2A receptor binding, some actions of LPCs are G2A-dependent. For example, LPCs increase the bactericidal activity of rodent neutrophils, enhance hydrogen peroxide production in rodent neutrophils {{triggered by the}} ingestion of bacteria, stimulate the chemotaxis of human monocytes, and protect mice from the lethal effects of experimentally induced bacterial sepsis endotoxin. G2A may similarly {{be responsible for the}} activities of other phospholipids which, like LPC have not been shown to bind to G2A but still require G2A for certain of their activities viz., lysophosphatidylserine and lysophosphatidylethanolamine; these two lyso-phospholipids stimulate calcium signaling pathways in human neutrophils by a G2A dependent mechanism. [...] Furthermore, activated neutrophils greatly increase their surface membrane content of lysophosphatidylserine. In a mouse model, mouse neutrophils with increased levels of lysophosphatidylserine on their surface membrane due to cell activation or artificial addition showed an increase in there engulfment by mouse macrophages in vitro that was dependent on the expression of G2A in the macrophages and an increased rate of clearance in mice by a mechanism that was dependent on the expression of G2A by the mice. [...] Lysophosphotidylserine-laden neutrophils stimulated the G2A-dependent production the anti-inflammatory mediator, prostaglandin E2, by macrophages in the in vitro studies and inhibited the production of pro-inflammatory mediators, interleukin-6 and keratinocyte chemoattractant, in in vivo studies. Taken together, these studies suggest that G2A, activated by certain phospholipids contributes not only to the development but also the resolution of certain inflammation and innate immune responses in mice and may also do so in humans.|$|E
