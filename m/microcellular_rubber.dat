40|$|The {{aim of the}} {{research}} was to investigate the effect of the added aluminium silicate filler and Azodicarbonamide (AZDM) blowing agent on production of <b>microcellular</b> <b>rubber</b> for light sales. The formula of <b>microcellular</b> <b>rubber</b> consist of ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA) 80 phr, natural rubber (SIR 3 L) 20 phr, stearic acid 0, 5 phr, zink oxide 1 phr, aluminium silicate 15 phr, AZDM 1, 5 phr and dicumyl peroxide 0, 8 phr. The best formula phr and AZDM blowing agent of 1, 5, 2 and 2, 5 phr, respectively. The vulcanization process was carried out at 160 â€“ 165 o C for 20 minutes and molding on 100 kg/cm 2 pressure. The results showed that the best microcelluler rubber was produced by using the formula of aluminium silicate filler of 20 phr and AZDM blowing agent of 1, 5 phr. The microcelluler rubber performed physical properties such as tensile strength 42, 75 kg/cm 2, elongation at break 204 %, Grasselli abrasion resistance 2, 79 mm 3 /kg. m, hardness 50, 6 shore A, compression set 33, 12 % and specific gravity 0, 34 g/cm 3, while signs of cracking was not performed...|$|E
40|$|The use {{of novel}} {{intermediates}} {{for the production}} of integral-skin <b>microcellular</b> urethane <b>rubber</b> has been explored in detail from the standpoints of polymer physical properties and process-ability. Polymer/polyols and quasi-prepolymers were combined to yield extremely reactive, yet controllable, systems which are cured at room temperature and demoldable in less than 10 minutes. The ingredients are liquid at room temperature, shelf stable, and con-tain no aromatic diamines, which are relatively expensive and can cause handling and discoloration problems. These novel urethane polymers possess physical properties which were heretofore ob-tainable only with the use of aromatic diamine curing agents. Formu-lation and process variables were explored to provide the technol-ogy necessary for the practical utilization of the raw materials by <b>microcellular</b> urethane <b>rubber</b> parts producers. By proper manipu-lation of formulation and processing conditions, rubbers suitable {{for a wide range of}} applications have been developed...|$|R
