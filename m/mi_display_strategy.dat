40|$|Most of {{the fashion}} and food {{industries}} understand and believe that the <b>display</b> <b>strategy</b> {{is very important for}} their business. Now, the electronics industries are starting to find out whether the <b>display</b> <b>strategy</b> is also applicable in the electronics industry or not. There is big confusion about the definition of <b>display</b> <b>strategy,</b> the importance of having <b>display</b> <b>strategy</b> in their promotion strategy. Even now, the implementations of <b>display</b> <b>strategy</b> in multinational electronics industry still blur. The Authors use descriptive research as the research method, supported with the primary and secondary data from the observation, interview, and questionnaire. In the research process, the Authors find out that price and technology / features are the main consideration from the customers in buying electronics products. Besides that, see and try the product first are very important in buying decision of customers. The <b>display</b> <b>strategy,</b> especially the effective <b>display</b> <b>strategy</b> can increase the exposure of the products, thus increase the attractiveness and willingness of the customers to see and to buy the products. The implementation of <b>display</b> <b>strategy</b> will increase the sales performance of the company {{and at the same time}} the <b>display</b> <b>strategy</b> will strengthen the promotion activities of the company. The company should implement the effective <b>display</b> <b>strategy.</b> Since the implementation of the <b>display</b> <b>strategy</b> in the multinational electronics company can be nationally or globally, thus, the company needs to make standardized guidelines about the implementation of the <b>display</b> <b>strategy...</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Searching online {{information}} resources using mobile devices {{is affected by}} displays on which {{only a small fraction}} of the set of ranked documents can be displayed. In this paper, we ask whether the search effort can be reduced, on average, by user feedback indicating a single most relevant document in each display. For small display sizes and limited user actions, we are able to construct a tree representing all possible outcomes. Examination of the tree permits us to compute an upper limit on relevance feedback performance. Three standard feedback algorithms are considered- Rocchio, Robertson/Sparck-Jones and a Bayesian algorithm. Two <b>display</b> <b>strategies</b> are considered, one based on maximizing the immediate information gain and the other on most likely documents. Our results bring out the strengths and weaknesses of the algorithms, and the need for exploratory <b>display</b> <b>strategies</b> with conservative feedback algorithms. ...|$|R

At a higher value of nonlinearity, incoherent <b>MI</b> <b>displays</b> a two-dimensional (2 D) instability and leads to self-ordered arrays of light spots. Comment: 16 pages, 4 figure...|$|R

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimited. Remotely sensed data produced by hyperspectral imagers contains hundreds of contiguous narrow spectral bands at each spatial pixel. The substantial dimensionality and unique character of hyperspectral imagery requires display techniques {{that differ from}} traditional image analysis tools. This study investigated the appropriate methodologies for displaying hyperspectral images based on the physical principles of human color vision and a generalized set of linear transformations. Principal components (PC) analysis is {{a powerful tool for}} reducing the dimensionality of a data set, and PC-based strategies were explored in creating a broadly applicable image <b>display</b> <b>strategy.</b> It is shown that the invariant <b>display</b> <b>strategy</b> and generalized eigenvectors developed within this study offer a first look capability {{for a wide variety of}} spectral scenes.

40|$|Variable message sign (VMS) is an {{effective}} traffic management tool for congestion mitigation. The VMS is primarily used {{as a means of}} providing factual travel information or genuine route guidance to travelers. However, this may be rendered sub-optimal on a network level by potential network paradoxes and lack of consideration for its cascading effect {{on the rest of the}} network. This paper focuses on the design of optimal <b>display</b> <b>strategy</b> of VMS in response to real-time traffic information and its coordination with other intelligent transportation systems such as signal control, in order to explore the full potential of real-time route guidance in combating congestion. We invoke the linear decision rule framework to design the optimal on-line VMS strategy, and test its effectiveness in conjunction with on-line signal control. A simulation case study is conducted on a real-world test network in China, which shows the advantage of the proposed adaptive VMS <b>display</b> <b>strategy</b> over genuine route guidance, as well as its synergies with on-line signal control for congestion mitigation.
