5|$|After the hurricane, {{the labor}} force diminished and wages {{decreased}} by staggering amounts. In July 2005, 9,592 people applied for unemployment services and the payroll of metropolitan firms declined by 13.6% between July 2005 and July 2007, indicating an estimated loss of 70,000 jobs. The sectors <b>most</b> <b>affected</b> were service-related industries, fluctuating with the population. The only sector to truly thrive after landfall was construction, which was in high demand to make needed repairs and rebuild destroyed homes.|$|E

Domingo Matheu was the <b>most</b> <b>affected</b> one by his death, {{to the point of}} crying for it. Alberti was replaced in the Junta by Nicolás Rodríguez Peña, a decided morenist. Saavedra and Funes did not like him, but with the social commotion generated by Alberti's death, they avoided to offer resistance to his nomination.|$|E
5|$|Despite Dean's {{significant}} damage, it did {{not have}} severe effects on infrastructure, and the non-agricultural sectors of <b>most</b> <b>affected</b> nations recovered quickly. Most cruise lines diverted their ships away from the Western Caribbean in anticipation of Hurricane Dean's passage, though by August 27 all were back on schedule, except those with damaged ports in Belize and the Yucatán. The Lesser Antilles and the Greater Antilles were especially quick to resume servicing cruise lines, as their ports opened within days.|$|E

5|$|Following {{the passage}} of Mitch, disease {{outbreaks}} occurred throughout Central America, including cholera, leptospirosis, and dengue fever. Over 2,328 cases of cholera were reported, killing 34people. Guatemala was <b>most</b> <b>affected</b> by the bacterium, {{where most of the}} deaths occurred from contaminated food. 450 cases of leptospirosis were reported in Nicaragua, killing seven people. There were over 1,357 cases of dengue reported, though no deaths were reported from the disease.|$|E
5|$|In 1991, it was {{estimated}} that 159 resident and 23 migratory species were endangered or vulnerable due to forest clearance, illegal logging, hunting and habitat degradation, especially in the lowlands. The species <b>most</b> <b>affected</b> are large water birds whose wetland habitat has been largely lost to agriculture, and forest species, as deforestation for agriculture and logging have removed and degraded portions of the woodlands.|$|E
5|$|In the {{immediate}} aftermath, officials enacted a curfew for Belize City, Caye Caulker and San Pedro to curtail looting, {{and the latter}} two areas were declared disaster areas. The entirety of the northern three districts (out of six total) were also declared disaster areas. There were initial difficulties in determining the needs in the affected residents, due to cut communications. The government sent planes with emergency supplies to the <b>most</b> <b>affected</b> offshore islands. Several emergency teams were sent to Caye Caulker and San Pedro as soon as weather conditions permitted it. Widespread road repairs also began almost immediately after Keith's occurrence. The Belize International Airport was back online by the morning of October 4, only a single day after the tropical cyclone passed through the area. By that time, boat service was re-instated with the <b>most</b> <b>affected</b> areas to pick up stranded tourists. Workers quickly restored power and water in Belize City. In {{the days after the}} storm struck, residual flooding sparked fears for the spread of disease. In Orange Walk and Cayo District, residents were advised to stay indoors to avoid bites from poisonous snakes.|$|E

5|$|Upon {{passing by}} Oahu, Iniki {{produced}} tides of 1.7–3feet (0.5–0.9m) above normal. Prolonged periods of high waves severely eroded and damaged the southwestern coast of Oahu, with the areas <b>most</b> <b>affected</b> being Barbers Point through Kaena. The Waianae coastline experienced the most damage, with waves and storm surge flooding {{the second floor}} of beachside apartments. In all, Hurricane Iniki caused several million dollars in property damage, and two deaths on Oahu.|$|E
5|$|While OCD {{may affect}} any joint, the knee—specifically the medial femoral condyle in 75–85% of knee cases—tends {{to be the}} most {{commonly}} affected, and constitutes 75% of all cases. The elbow (specifically the capitulum of the humerus) is the second <b>most</b> <b>affected</b> joint with 6% of cases; the talar dome of the ankle represents 4% of cases. Less frequent locations include the patella, vertebrae, the femoral head, and the glenoid of the scapula.|$|E

5|$|A recent threat, first {{reported}} in 1978, is forest dieback. In some areas, {{especially in the}} peripheral region, this has been severe with nearly a 50% in vegetation. Water deficiency has been attributed as {{the main cause of}} dieback as droughts are becoming more frequent. Regrowth of forest is hindered by frost which is increasingly severe. The forest dieback has affected 22 species of plants with Calophyllum walkeri being the <b>most</b> <b>affected.</b> A study has suggested that low calcium causes soil acidification and increased toxicity caused by metallic elements such as aluminium may be causing the dieback. Leaching of nutrients and the resulting imbalance in soil micronutrients may also be contributing to the dieback.|$|E
5|$|According to a {{study by}} Dr. Nguyen Viet Nhan, {{children}} in the areas where Agent Orange was used have been affected and have multiple health problems, including cleft palate, mental disabilities, hernias, and extra fingers and toes. In the 1970s, high levels of dioxin were found in the breast milk of South Vietnamese women, and in the blood of U.S. military personnel who had served in Vietnam. The <b>most</b> <b>affected</b> zones are the mountainous area along Truong Son (Long Mountains) and the border between Vietnam and Cambodia. The affected residents are living in substandard conditions with many genetic diseases.|$|E
5|$|Although much of Massachusetts {{had been}} cleared for agriculture, leaving only traces of old-growth forest in {{isolated}} pockets, secondary growth has regenerated in many rural areas as farms have been abandoned. Currently, forests cover around 62% of Massachusetts. The areas <b>most</b> <b>affected</b> by human development include the Greater Boston area {{in the east and}} the Springfield metropolitan area in the west, although the latter includes agricultural areas throughout the Connecticut River Valley. There are currently 219 endangered species in Massachusetts.|$|E

5|$|Cyclone Bola {{remained}} near Vanuatu {{for about}} a week, during which it reached its peak intensity while executing a cyclonic loop. The <b>most</b> <b>affected</b> locations were Epi island, the Shepherd Islands, and the islands in Malampa Province, and throughout the country the cyclone affected more than 15,000people and 3,000houses. In a five-day period the cyclone dropped about 450mm (17.7in) of rainfall. Two bridges on Malakula were destroyed, and several other bridges were flooded or damaged. The passage of the cyclone also left several buildings, roads, and crop fields damaged.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{sovereign}} debt having risen substantially {{in only a}} few eurozone countries, with the three <b>most</b> <b>affected</b> countries Greece, Ireland and Portugal collectively only accounting for 6% of the eurozone's gross domestic product (GDP), it has become a perceived problem for the area as a whole, leading to speculation of further contagion of other European countries and a possible break-up of the eurozone. In total, the debt crisis forced five out of 17 eurozone countries to seek help from other nations by the end of 2012.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{debris and}} waste being carried into {{waterways}} by flooding from Ernesto, Virginia officials closed the Chesapeake Bay to shellfishing {{for four days}} from the Chesapeake Bay Bridge–Tunnel {{to the mouth of}} the Potomac River. In Richmond, officials condemned 70homes, prompting city workers to establish temporary homes. By five days after the storm's passage through the state, most of the 600,000people who experienced power outages had their electricity restored. Dominion Resources's Tidewater Virginia area was among the <b>most</b> <b>affected,</b> requiring 2–3days to restore all areas. By two days after the storm moved through the area, all major roadways were opened, though secondary roadways took longer to be cleared from debris.|$|E

5|$|Hours after Humberto made landfall, Rick Perry {{declared}} Galveston, Jefferson, and Orange counties as disaster areas, which allocated {{state resources}} {{to assist the}} affected residents. The governor applied for a presidential disaster declaration on September 21. Four Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) teams assessed the hurricane damage in the three <b>most</b> <b>affected</b> counties. Following their assessment, they determined that {{the damage caused by}} Humberto was not significant enough to require a disaster declaration. As such, Governor Rick Perry's request from FEMA was denied. Across the Bolivar Peninsula, an estimated 1,500 cubic yards of structural debris and 3,000 cubic yards of tree limbs were needed to be removed {{in the wake of the}} storm.|$|E
5|$|Immediately {{after the}} storm moved ashore, high winds {{prevented}} disaster teams from assessing damage in the affected areas. By February18, CARE international had dispatched relief teams to the <b>most</b> <b>affected</b> regions. The teams distributed plastic tarps and food for 10,000people. High winds halted locust-control operations, while heavy rainfall provided favorable breeding conditions. In {{the area of the}} cyclone's first landfall, most people were able to rebuild their houses using trees and supplies from the surrounding countryside. Overall, about 25,845people became homeless due to the cyclone, although most were able {{to return to their homes}} after a few days after they were repaired. In the months {{after the storm}}'s passage, the European Commission allocated €200,000 ($287,000USD) to CARE France for the storm victims.|$|E
5|$|In the {{immediate}} aftermath, the New Zealand Red Cross provided $10,000 (2004NZD) for essential relief supplies.
