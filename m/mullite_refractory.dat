The "design of experiments" approach is used to investigate how the coating porosity and thickness are influenced by six experimental parameters. Arc current, secondary gas (H 2) flow rate, and stand-off distance are the most significant parameters for both responses. Several interaction terms also affect significantly the thickness response.

This material {{can be applied to}} prepare Al Si series ceramics if the impurities can be removed and the Al/Si mass ratio can be elevated to a high level. In this work, a new mechanical chemical synergistic activation desilication process is proposed and optimized. During the synergistic activation, the morphology, ironic leaching ratios, efficient desilicated ratio (EDR), and mineral phases of different treatments are investigated. The reactivity of amorphous silica can be elevated to a high level (EDR > 11 %). After the desilication process, the contents of different impurities can be lowered up to less than 1 %, and the Al/Si mass ratio can be elevated from 1. 26 to 2. 71. <b>Mullite</b> <b>refractories</b> are prepared from desilicated HAFA by forming and sintering process, and the bulk density and apparent porosity can reach to 2. 85 g/cm(3) and 2. 07 %, respectively...|$|R

40|$|The alumosilicate {{ceramics}} with mullite crystalline phase {{are used}} in various branches of science and technique. The <b>mullite</b> <b>refractory</b> ceramics with high porosity serve as a heat insulator and {{as well as a}} constructional materials. The purpose of the work was to sinter high porosity ceramic and to increase the quantity of mullite phase in this mullite, mullite-corundum ceramics. Two types of compositions were prepared during the experiment. The first type was the compositions with commercial alumina and silica oxides. The second type was from mixing these oxides with 10, 20 and 30 wt% of kaolin. In all samples the Al 2 O 3 and SiO 2 were in 2. 57 : 1 ratio, because that was conformed to mullite stechiometric compositions (3 Al 2 O 3. 2 SiO 2). The types of alumina oxides were α-Al 2 O 3 (d 50 = 4 µm) and γ-Al 2 O 3 (d 50 = 80 µm). Ratios of α-: γ-Al 2 O 3 were (1 : 1) or (1 : 3). The porous materials were prepared by slip casting of suspension of raw materials. The aluminium paste (0. 18 wt%) was used as a pore former. Water content in the suspensions was 30 - 47 wt%. Pore formation occurred as a result of hydrogen formation in chemical reaction between aluminium paste and water. The samples were sintered at the temperature of 1650 °C and 1750 °C for one hour. The increasing amount of kaolin, α-: γ-Al 2 O 3 at the ratio (1 : 3) and sintering at the highest temperature raised the quantity of mullite phase. The mullite phase began to dominate over the corundum phase...|$|E

40|$|Two {{types of}} {{refractory}} bricks {{were used in}} reaction tests with slag from a production kiln for iron ore pellet production. Electron microscopy was used to characterize morphological changes at the slag/brick interface and active chemical reactions. Phases such as kalsilite, nepheline and potassium β-alumina form, in a layered structure, {{as a consequence of}} alkali metals migration in the brick. Larger hematite grains (50 – 100  μm) in the slag remain at the original slag/brick interface, while smaller grains dissolve and move through the partly dissolved brick bulk, and forms micrometer sized needle-shaped crystals deeper in the lining material. Thermodynamic simulations predict the formation of a solid solution between hematite and corundum which is also observed in the reaction zone after extended time periods. Original Publication:J.

40|$|Phosphate-bonded {{investments}} {{have already}} been widely utilized in dental restoration and micro-casting of artistic products for its outstanding rapid setting and high strength. However, the rapid setting rate of investment slurry has up to now been a barrier to extend {{the use of such}} slurry in preparation of medium-sized ceramic moulds. This paper proposes a new process of rapid fabrication of magnesia-phosphate-bonded investment ceramic moulds for medium-sized superalloy castings utilizing bauxite and <b>mullite</b> as <b>refractory</b> aggregates. In order to determine the properties of magnesia-phosphate-bonded bauxite-mullite investments (MPBBMI), a series of experiments were conducted, including modification of the workable time of slurry by liquid(mL) /powder(g) (L/P) ratio and addition of boric acid as retard agent and sodium tri-polyphosphate (STP) as strengthening agent, and adjustment of bauxite (g) /mullite(g) (B/M) ratio for mechanical strength. Mechanical vibration was applied to improve initial setting time and fluidity when pouring investment slurry; then an intermediate size ceramic mould for superalloy castings was manufactured by means of this rapid preparing process with MPBBMI material. The results showed that the MPBBMI slurry exhibits proper initial setting time and excellent fluidity when the L/P ratio is 0. 64 and the boric acid content is 0. 88 wt. %. The fired specimens made from the MPBBMI material demonstrated adequate compression strength to withstand impact force of molten metal when the B/M ratio is 0. 89 and the STP content is 0. 92 wt. %.

40|$|Andalusite, kyanite and {{sillimanite}} are alumino-silicate polymorphs of metamorphic origin {{with the}} chemical formula Al 2 SiO 5. When calcined, these polymorphs convert to <b>mullite,</b> a highly <b>refractory</b> material. The conversion {{is accompanied by}} an irreversible volume expansion of 5 %, 18 % and 7 % for andalusite, kyanite and sillimanite, respectively (Skillen, 1993). Worldwide, andalusite is the preferred of the three raw materials because it converts to mullite at lower temperatures (1380 °C) than sillimanite (1550 °C). Although kyanite converts to mullite at 1370 °C, andalusite is favoured because the volume change during mullitization is negligible; therefore no calcination is required before manufacturing refractory shapes. Approximately 4. 22 x 109 joules (4 x 106 BTU) are needed to mullitize one tonne of kyanite (Skillen, 1993). Despite this, kyanite is {{the most widely used}} polymorph in North America, because of its local abundance, proximity to markets, and availability of relatively inexpensive energy. As energy costs continue to increase, this may change. In 1998, production of kyanite was probably less than 200 000 tonnes. Prices at the time of writing wer...|$|R
40|$|University of Minnesota M. S. thesis. February 2014. Major: Civil Engineering. Advisor: Eshan V. Dave. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); viii, 95 pages. Northern Minnesota's iron mines are {{the starting point}} {{for the majority of the}} steel that gets produced in the United States. Their taconite processing plants use heat in furnaces to oxidize and indurate iron in the final stage of making a taconite pellet. Facilities can increase efficiencies when refractory service life is maintained. Efficiencies gained include: less fuel used, better quality control, better furnace control, and less mechanical component maintenance. Furnace refractory linings fail when the cracks that develop in them are uncontrolled or too large. These failures allow heat and gases retained by the lining to reach structural or mechanical components. Furnace control and efficiencies are also compromised when heat and gases are allowed to short circuit or escape the system. These failures are primarily the result of thermal of shock and expansion. It is common place to add stainless steel needle reinforcement to a monolithic refractory in an effort to counteract these effects. This study used several standard ASTM testing procedures to test 65 % alumina <b>mullite</b> based <b>refractory</b> samples with 304 and 406 grade stainless steel needles. Mechanical property data gathered was used to analyze performance. The study found that adding reinforcement does not increase initial Compression and Cold Modulus of Ruptures strengths, however, after prolonged heat and thermal shock exposure, needles help maintain integrity and mechanical properties of samples. The study also found that corrosion due to oxidation was a major contributing factor to the way needles performed; and concluded that a concentration of 3 % 406 "Alfa 1 " stainless steel reinforcing needles added to the working lining of a taconite furnace is recommended...|$|R

We examined the time course of the ability to induce lucigenin-dependent chemiluminescence (CL) from human monocyte-derived macrophages exposed to Japan Fibrous Material standard reference samples (glass wool, rock wool, micro glass fiber, two types of refractory ceramic fiber, <b>refractory</b> <b>mullite</b> fiber, potassium titanium whisker, silicon carbide whisker, titanium oxide whisker, and wollastonite). We determined how fiber length or width might modify the response of cells. We found that the patterns of time-dependent increase of CL (sigmoid type) were similar for each sample except wollastonite. We observed a strong correlation between geometric-mean length and ability to induce CL in seven samples > 6 microm in length over the time course (largest r(2) = 0. 9760). Although we also observed a close positive correlation between geometric-mean width and the ability to induce CL in eight samples < 1. 8 microm in width at 15 min (r(2) = 0. 8760), a sample of 2. 4 microm in width had a low ability to induce CL. Moreover, the relationship between width and the rate of increase in ability to induce CL had a negative correlation at 30 - 60 min (largest r(2) = 0. 7473).

40|$|Pressurised entrained‐flow {{gasification}} (PEFG) {{of sustainable}} woody biomass offers {{the opportunity for}} envi-ronmentally benign production of syngas that is suitable for synthesis of fuels and other chemicals. During the PEFG process, ash-forming matter in the fuel undergoes transformations. Slag formation is an important form of ash transformation that occurs inside a PEFG reactor. In most industrial-scale PEFG of coal, the ash-forming matter becomes predominately molten and flows {{down the side of}} the reactor wall to be continuously tapped and removed. The slagging behaviour of woody biomass fuels during PEFG is expected to be different to that of coal, due to significant differences in the amount, composition and reactivity of the ash-forming matter. The objective of this thesis study was to initiate the elucidation of slag formation during PEFG of woody biomass. This was carried out by obtaining and characterising ash deposits and slags from pilot-scale experimental cam-paigns. An oxygen-fired pilot-scale reactor (ETC Piteå, Sweden) was used for the study. A low reactor temperature (1350 °C) experimental campaigns involving stem wood produced flowing slags that eventuated in blockages of the reactor outlet. These slags were also retrieved from the reactor and characterised. It was found that they likely comprised of products resulting from detrimental interactions between the fuel ash and the mullite-based refractory used for the reactor wall lining. Viscosity models and thermochemical equilibrium calculations (TECs) were utilised to offer an explanation for the behaviour of the slags. Additional TECs were carried out to investigate the propensity for melt formation between the main ash-forming elements of woody biomass, Ca, K and Si, under global reactor conditions with relevance to PEFG. The results showed that, in general, the conditions for melt formation are broadened with increasing pressure, increasing amounts of Si and increased concentrations of gaseous K species. Dissolution of Al₂O₃ from <b>mullite</b> (Al₆Si₂O₁₃) <b>refractory</b> due to ash deposits and the gasification atmosphere was also predicted by the calculations. A scheme of slag formation during PEFG of woody biomass in a reactor with mullite-based refractory lining was proposed in light of the experimental observations. Some practical suggestions to avoid ash-related problems during PEFG of woody biomass are also discussed. This work forms part of a broader study to elucidate the ash transformations that occur during PEFG of woody biomass, which is necessary in order to develop the process into commercial availability.
