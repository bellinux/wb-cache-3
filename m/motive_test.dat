40|$|Based on the {{fundamental}} theory of value effects of investment, this paper investigates {{the motives of}} inefficient investment of listed company in China. Regression results using 3155 Shanghai and Shenzhen listed company observations in 2003 - 2005 show that investment is sensitive to cash flows when we control the growth opportunity, suggesting that some degree of inefficient investment of listed companies exists. Moreover these relationships are much stronger for state-owned listed companies. The <b>motive</b> <b>test</b> show that investment is positively correlated to future operational performance significantly for both state-owned and non-state-owned listed companies, which means the reason why listed companies engaged in inefficient investments lies in agent conflicts between shareholders and managers, therefore the main form of inefficient investment of listed companies is overinvestment.

Therefore, we administered the Picture Story Exercise (PSE), the Operant <b>Motive</b> <b>Test</b> (OMT), and the Multi-Motive Grid (MMG) in one and the same study. As explicit measures, we used the Personality Research Form, PRF, the Motive Enactment Test and a goal questionnaire. We investigated the statistical overlaps between all these measures (sample: 202 undergraduate students) and found that the implicit motive measures showed either no or only little correlation with each other. Furthermore, they also partly correlated with explicit motive measures.

40|$|Objectives The {{present study}} {{investigated}} the predictive value of the explicit and implicit affiliation motive for social behavior in sport competitions. From an information processing perspective, an explicit motive is linked to verbal cues and respondent behavior. The implicit motive in turn is linked to nonverbal stimuli and operant behavior (McClelland, Koestner, & Weinberger, 1989; Schultheiss, 2008). Both respondent affiliative behavior (e. g., verbal interactions with teammates) and operant nonverbal social behavior (e. g., pleasant to opponents) {{can be observed in}} racquet sports team competitions. Design & Methods Fifty-two male racquet sportsmen completed the Personality Research Form (explicit affiliation motive) and the Operant <b>Motive</b> <b>Test</b> (implicit affiliation motive). Motive measures were used to predict social behavior during competitions using multiple regression analyses. To this aim real competitive matches were videotaped and analyzed. Results Results show that the explicit affiliation motive is associated with time spent in verbal team contact. The implicit affiliation motive, by contrast, is linked to pleasant nonverbal behavior shown toward opponents. Conclusions Findings suggest that implicit and explicit affiliation motives predict different kinds of social behavior in sports competition respectively. Indirect motive measures may be of additional predictive value for different behavior in real sports settings...|$|E
40|$|Human {{behavior}} {{is directed by}} an implicit and an explicit motivational system. The intrinsic form of the implicit achievement motive has been demonstrated to predict the experience of flow. Thus, this achievement flow motive can be considered an integral component of the autotelic personality, posited in Flow Theory as dispositional difference in the propensity to experience flow. As implicit motivation predicts long-term behavioral trends and flow predicts quality of performance, the achievement flow motive should be predictive of a long-term goal pursuit such as educational attainment. This hypothesis is tested cross-culturally to {{shed some light on}} the universality of flow: Participants from Cameroon, Costa Rica, and Germany were asked about the level of education they attained. To assess their achievement flow motive, the Operant <b>Motive</b> <b>Test</b> was employed. After measurement equivalence was established, analyses revealed that, across all three cultures, the achievement flow motive explained variance in educational attainment independent of achievement values as measured by a scale of the Schwartz Value Survey. Consequently, as would be expected of an element of the autotelic personality, the achievement flow motive predicts long-term academic success.

The underlying assumption for the present research was that the implicit affiliation motive also moderates the salivary cortisol response to acute psychological stress when some aspects of social evaluation and uncontrollability are involved. By contrast we did not expect similar effects in response to exercise as a physical stressor. Fifty-nine high school students aged M =  14. 8 years were randomly assigned to a psychosocial stress (publishing the results of an intelligence test performed), a physical stress (exercise intensity of 65 – 75 % of HRmax), and a control condition (normal school lesson) each lasting 15  min. Participants’ affiliation motives were assessed using the Operant <b>Motive</b> <b>Test</b> and salivary cortisol samples were taken pre and post stressor.

They did not regard fashion magazines as a major source of information to assist them in the process of socialization. The results also suggest that sociological motives may not directly affect media use, but they are nonetheless related to psychological motivations that predict media consumption...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Better {{knowledge}} of the professional's motives for ordering laboratory tests {{in the case of}} diagnostic uncertainty may lead to interventions directed at reducing unnecessary testing. AIM: To gain insight into the general practitioner's (GP's) motives for ordering laboratory tests for patients presenting with unexplained complaints. DESIGN OF STUDY: Semi-structured interviews based on surgery observations. SETTING: Twenty-one general practices in rural and urban areas of The Netherlands. METHOD: Investigation of the GP's perception of determinants of test-ordering behaviour in the situation of diagnostic uncertainty. The interviews were structured by evaluating the consultations and test-ordering performance of that day. RESULTS: Dutch GPs vary considerably in their <b>motives</b> for ordering <b>tests.</b> Numerous <b>motives</b> emerged from the data. Some examples of important themes include: personal routines; tolerance of diagnostic uncertainty; time pressure; and tactical <b>motives</b> for <b>test</b> ordering. Complying with the perceived needs of the patient for reassurance through testing is seen as an easy, cost- and time-effective strategy. A clear hierarchy in the determinants was not found. CONCLUSION: The decision to request laboratory testing {{is the result of a}} complex interaction of considerations that are often conflicting.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} two-fold: first to find whether measures of achievement <b>motive</b> and <b>test</b> anxiety predicted the academic performance of female college students; an attempt was also made to further validate the use of the two tests. Secondly, to explore Horner's (1968) findings that women internalize a motive to avoid success which acts as a psychological barrier to their achievement strivings; the relationships between the motive to avoid success, test anxiety and sex-role orientation, educational and occupational aspirations, socioeconomic background were also examined. The objectives were studied in two separate investigations. Study 1. Test anxiety was measured by the Alpert and Haber (1960) Achievement Anxiety Test. The French Test of Insight and Mehrabian Achievement Orientation Scale were used to measure achievement <b>motive.</b> The <b>tests</b> were completed by 67 female and 23 male college students. Academic performance level was derived from the final year examination grading. The results indicated that only test anxiety measure appeared to predict grades. For female Ss, the Facilitating Anxiety Scale was positively correlated with grades. For male Ss, the Debilitating Anxiety Scale was negatively correlated with grades. Other findings were largely inconclusive. Study 2. The prevalence of the motive to avoid success was assessed by Horner's (1968) projective technique. Resultant test anxiety was derived from the Alpert and Haber (1960) Achievement Anxiety Test. Sex-role orientation was measured by Gough's (1952) Brief Feminine Scale. The Ss were 118 female and 36 male college students. The results showed evidence of the motive to avoid success in both men and women. The female Ss elicited more fear of success in response to a traditionally male competitive success cue, while the male Ss wrote more fear of success stories in response to a traditionally female role cue. Traditionally oriented women gave the highest percentage of fear of success stories, obtained the lowest mean resultant test anxiety score, the highest mean fear of failure score and in-dicated a preference for marriage rather than carreer. The nontraditional women, on the other hand, showed fewer fear of success stories, higher mean resultant test anxiety score, and expressed great concern about achieving their educational and occupational aspirations.
