40|$|Abstract. In the paper, the {{optimization}} of the coagulation {{process for}} Kaolin and humic acid removal using polymeric aluminum ferric sulfate (PAFS) was studied. In {{order to obtain}} the maximum turbidity and humic acid removal efficiency of Kaolin and humic acid simulated wastewater, the optimum coagulation conditions was investigated with the factors of <b>mixing</b> speed and time. Furthermore, <b>mixing</b> speed and time including parameters affecting the coagulation performance such as rapid <b>mixing</b> speed, rapid <b>mixing</b> time, slow <b>mixing</b> speed and slow <b>mixing</b> time using single factor and orthogonal array L 9 (34) analysis were examined. The {{results showed that the}} optimum single factor of <b>mixing</b> speed and time indicated rapid <b>mixing</b> speed of 350 rpm, rapid <b>mixing</b> time of 1. 0 min, slow <b>mixing</b> speed of 60 rpm and slow <b>mixing</b> time of 20 min. Then the orthogonal optimization experiment of <b>mixing</b> speed and time indicated maximum HA removal efficiency was 97. 5 % at rapid <b>mixing</b> speed of 350 rpm, rapid <b>mixing</b> time of 1. 25 min, slow <b>mixing</b> speed of 60 rpm, and slow <b>mixing</b> time of 20 min...|$|R
