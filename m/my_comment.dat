2500|$|On 10 September 1996, Hanson {{gave her}} maiden {{speech to the}} House of Representatives, which was widely {{reported}} in the media. In her opening lines, Hanson said that [...] "I won the seat of Oxley largely {{on an issue that}} has resulted in me being called a racist. That issue related to <b>my</b> <b>comment</b> that Aboriginals received more benefits than non-Aboriginals". Hanson then asserted that Australia was in danger of being [...] "swamped by Asians", and that these immigrants [...] "have their own culture and religion, form ghettos and do not assimilate". Hanson argued that [...] "mainstream Australians" [...] were instead subject to [...] "a type of reverse racism ... by those who promote political correctness and those who control the various taxpayer funded 'industries' that flourish in our society servicing Aboriginals, multiculturalists {{and a host of other}} minority groups". This theme continued with the assertion that [...] "present governments are encouraging separatism in Australia by providing opportunities, land, moneys and facilities available only to Aboriginals". Among a series of criticisms of Aboriginal land rights, access to welfare and reconciliation, Hanson criticised the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission (ATSIC), saying [...] "Anyone with a criminal record can, and does, hold a position with ATSIC". There then followed a short series of statements on family breakdown, youth unemployment, international debt, the Family Law Act, child support, and the privatisation of Qantas and other national enterprises. The speech also included an attack on immigration and multiculturalism, a call for the return of high-tariff protectionism, and criticism of economic rationalism. Her speech was delivered uninterrupted by her fellow parliamentarians as it was the courtesy given to MPs delivering their maiden speeches.|$|E

6000|$|Ingenious! {{would be}} <b>my</b> <b>comment,</b> and {{possibly}} to {{the eighteenth century}} mind it would have proved satisfactory. There was {{something to be said}} in defence of what appeared to him as new and strange in our books and methods. Not easily said, unfortunately; since it was not only the expression that was new, but the outlook, and something in the heart. We are bound as much as ever to facts; we seek for them more and more diligently, knowing that to break from them is to be carried away by vain imaginations. All the same, facts in themselves are nothing to us: they are important only in their relations to other facts and things--to all things, and the essence of things, material and spiritual. We are not like children gathering painted shells and pebbles on a beach; but, whether we know it or not, are seeking after something beyond and above knowledge. The wilderness in which we are sojourners is not our home; it is enough that its herbs and roots and wild fruits nourish and give us strength to go onward. Intellectual curiosity, with the gratification of the individual for only purpose, has no place in this scheme of things as we conceive it. Heart and soul are with the brain in all investigation--a truth which some know in rare, beautiful intervals, and others never; but we are all meanwhile busy with our work, like myriads of social insects engaged in raising a structure that was never planned. Perhaps we are not so wholly unconscious of our destinies as were the patient gatherers of facts of a hundred years ago. Even in one brief century the dawn has come nearer--perhaps a faint whiteness in the east has exhilarated us like wine. Undoubtedly we are more conscious of many things, both within and without--of the length and breadth and depth of nature; of a unity which was hardly dreamed of by the naturalists of past ages, a commensalism on earth from which the meanest organism is not excluded. For we are no longer isolated, standing like starry visitors on a mountain-top, surveying life from the outside; but are on a level with and part and parcel of it; and if the mystery of life daily deepens, it is because we view it more closely and with clearer vision. A poet of our age has said that in the meanest floweret we may find [...] "thoughts that do often lie too deep for tears." [...] The poet and prophet is not alone in this; he expresses a feeling common to all of those who, with our wider knowledge, have the passion for nature in their hearts, who go to nature, whether for knowledge or inspiration. That there should appear in recent literature something of a new spirit, a sympathetic feeling which could not possibly have flourished in a former age, is not to be wondered at, considering all that has happened in the present century to change the current of men's thoughts. For not only has the new knowledge wrought in our minds, but has entered, or is at last entering, into our souls.|$|E
6000|$|All {{this while}} have I {{remained}} shamefully in your debt for interesting news, and I am plunged deeper into that condition by your admirable {{report from the}} Dardanelles in this a.m.'s Times. I am a backward being, alas, in these days when so much is forward; our public anxieties somehow strike {{for me at the}} roots of letter-writing, and I remain too often dumb, not because I am not thinking and feeling a thousand things, but exactly because I am doing so to such intensity. You wrote me weeks ago that you had finished your new novel--which information took my breath away (I mean by its windlike rush)--and now has come thus much of the remainder of the adventure for which that so grandly liberated you and which I follow with the liveliest participation in all your splendid sense of it and profit of it. I confess I take an enormous pleasure in the fact of the exposure of the sensitive plate of your imagination, your tremendous attention, to all these wonderful and terrible things. What impressions you are getting, verily--and what a breach must it all not make with the course of history you are practising up to the very eve. I rejoice that you finished and snipped off, or tucked in and wound up, something self-contained there--for how could you ever go back to it if you hadn't?--under that violence of rupture with the past which makes me ask myself what will have become of all that material we were taking for granted, and which now lies there behind us like some vast damaged cargo dumped upon a dock and unfit for human purchase or consumption. I seem to fear that I shall find myself seeing your recently concluded novel as through a glass darkly--which, however, will not prevent my immediately falling upon it when it appears; as I assume, however, that it is not now likely to do before the summer's end--by which time God knows what other monstrous chapters of history won't have been perpetrated! What I most want to say to you, I think, is that I rejoice for you with all my heart in that assurance of health which has enabled you so to gird yourself and go forth. If the torrid south has always been good for you there must be no amount of it that you are now not getting--though I am naturally reduced, you see, to quite abjectly helpless and incompetent supposition. I hang about you at any rate with all sorts of vows and benedictions. I feel that I mustn't make remarks about the colossal undertaking you are engaged in beyond saying that I believe with all my heart in the final power of your push. As for our news here the gist of that is that we are living with our eyes on you and more and more materially backing you. <b>My</b> <b>comment</b> on you is feeble, but my faith absolute, and I am, my dear Monty, your more than ever faithful old ...|$|E

6000|$|I have a {{long story}} {{to tell you about}} Bailey--I will say first the {{circumstances}} as plainly and as well as I can remember, and then I will make <b>my</b> <b>comment.</b> You know that Bailey was very much cut up about a little Jilt in the country somewhere. I thought he was in a dying state about it when at Oxford with him: little supposing, as I have since heard, that he was at that very time making impatient Love to Marian Reynolds--and guess my astonishment at hearing after this that he had been trying at Miss Martin. So Matters have been--So Matters stood--when he got ordained and went to a Curacy near Carlisle, where the family of the Gleigs reside. There his susceptible heart was conquered by Miss Gleig--and thereby all his connections in town have been annulled--both male and female. I do not now remember clearly the facts--These however I know--He showed his correspondence with Marian to Gleig, returned all her Letters and asked for his own--he also wrote very abrupt Letters to Mrs. Reynolds. I do not know any more of the Martin affair than I have written above. No doubt his conduct has been very bad. The great thing to be considered is--whether it is want of delicacy and principle or want of knowledge and polite experience. And again weakness--yes, that is it; and the want of a Wife--yes, that is it; and then Marian made great Bones of him although her Mother and sister have teased her very much about it. Her conduct has been very upright throughout the whole affair--She liked Bailey as a Brother but not as a Husband--especially as he used to woo her with the Bible and Jeremy Taylor under his arm--they walked in no grove but Jeremy Taylor's. Marian's obstinacy is some excuse, but his so quickly taking to Miss Gleig can have no excuse--except that of a Ploughman who wants a wife. The thing which sways me more against him than anything else is Rice's conduct on the occasion; Rice would not make an immature resolve: he was ardent in his friendship for Bailey, he examined the whole for and against minutely; and he has abandoned Bailey entirely. All this I am not supposed by the Reynoldses to have any hint of. It will be a good lesson to the Mother and Daughters--nothing would serve but Bailey. If you mentioned the word Tea-pot some one of them came out with an à propros about Bailey--noble fellow--fine fellow! was always in their mouths--This may teach them that the man who ridicules romance is the most romantic of Men--that he who abuses women and slights them loves them the most--that he who talks of roasting a Man alive would not do it {{when it came to the}} push--and above all, that they are very shallow people who take everything literally. A Man's life of any worth is a continual allegory, and very few eyes can see the Mystery of his life--a life like the scriptures, figurative--which such people can no more make out than they can the Hebrew Bible. Lord Byron cuts a figure but he is not figurative--Shakspeare led a life of Allegory: his works are the comments on it-- ...|$|E
