A portion of fundamental 1. 06 micrometer laser radiation is converted into its second harmonic frequency, and the average power of the second harmonic frequency is detected by an integrating detector.

40|$|Nanocrystalline TiO 2 {{films were}} used as {{substrate}} for the immobilization of β-cyclodextrine onto the electrode surface of the <b>piezoelectric</b> <b>crystal.</b> The sensing layer consisting of β-cyclodextrine and nanocrystalline TiO 2 particles was characterized by XRD, IR spectroscopy and impedance analysis techniques. Due to the rigidity of the cast material, comparatively thick coatings could be used without a significant attenuation of the acoustic wave, and the porous morphology of the nanocrystalline TiO 2 films yields a relatively fast response even for thick coatings. Piezoelectric gas sensors were successfully developed to detect organic vapors with detection limits down to 0. 05 ppm. When the nanocrystalline TiO 2 films were irradiated with UV lights, holes, and hydroxyl radicals were produced, which could oxidize and decompose organic materials. As fresh surface of porous TiO 2 could be produced by irradiating UV light onto the β-cyclodextrine/TiO 2 composite films, <b>piezoelectric</b> <b>crystal</b> sensors fabricated on porous TiO 2 substrate were found to give reproducible results. The use of such coating for fabricating <b>piezoelectric</b> <b>crystal</b> chemical and biosensors leads to significant improvements in the sensor performance and a wide scope of application. © 2005 Elsevier B.
