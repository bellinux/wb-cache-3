50|$|Comparative {{biomechanics}} is {{the application}} of biomechanics to non-human organisms, whether used to gain greater insights into humans (as in physical anthropology) or into the functions, ecology and adaptations of the organisms themselves. Common areas of investigation are Animal locomotion and feeding, as these have strong connections to the organism's fitness and impose high <b>mechanical</b> <b>demands.</b> Animal locomotion, has many manifestations, including running, jumping and flying. Locomotion requires energy to overcome friction, drag, inertia, and gravity, though which factor predominates varies with environment.|$|E
50|$|Architectural {{gear ratio}} (AGR) relates the {{contractile}} velocity {{of an entire}} muscle to the contractile velocity of a single muscle fiber. AGR {{is determined by the}} <b>mechanical</b> <b>demands</b> of a muscle during movement. Changes in pennation angle allow for variable gearing in pennate muscles. Variable pennation angle also influences whole-muscle geometry during contraction. The degree of fiber rotation determines the cross-sectional area {{during the course of the}} movement which can result in increases of the thickness or width of the muscle.|$|E
50|$|A typical {{characteristic}} of many animals that utilize undulatory locomotion {{is that they}} have segmented muscles, or blocks of myomeres, running from their head to tails which are separated by connective tissue called myosepta. In addition, some segmented muscle groups, such the lateral hypaxial musculature in the salamander are oriented at an angle to the longitudinal direction. For these obliquely oriented fibers the strain in the longitudinal direction is greater than the strain in the muscle fiber direction leading to an architectural gear ratio greater than 1. A higher initial angle of orientation and more dorsoventral bulging produces a faster muscle contraction but results in a lower amount of force production. It is hypothesized that animals employ a variable gearing mechanism that allows self-regulation of force and velocity to meet the <b>mechanical</b> <b>demands</b> of the contraction. When a pennate muscle is subjected to a low force, resistance to width changes in the muscle cause it to rotate which consequently produce a higher architectural gear ratio (AGR) (high velocity). However, when subject to a high force, the perpendicular fiber force component overcomes the resistance to width changes and the muscle compresses producing a lower AGR (capable of maintaining a higher force output).|$|E

The {{purpose of this}} study was to evaluate changes in movement variability among kinematic, kinetic, and electromyographic (EMG) variables following <b>mechanical</b> task <b>demand</b> manipulations during single-leg drop landings. Biomechanical outcome variables included 3 kinematic (sagittal, hip, knee, and ankle angles), 4 kinetic (sagittal hip, knee, ankle moments and vertical ground reaction force; GRFz), and 5 EMG variables (gluteus maximus, vastus medialis, biceps femoris, medial gastrocnemius, and tibialis anterior muscles). <b>Mechanical</b> task <b>demands</b> were altered using load and landing height manipulations, computed as percentages of participant anthropometrics (bodyweight: BW, BW+ 12. 5 %, BW+ 25 %, and height: H 12. 5 % and H 25 %, respectively). Fewer emergent strategies were identified under greater <b>mechanical</b> task <b>demands,</b> defined using the load accommodation strategies model, alongside decreased movement variability, assessed using principal component analysis (PCA). Joint-specific biomechanical adjustments were identified, highlighting mechanisms for the observed load accommodation strategies and changes in movement variability. An increasingly upright landing posture was observed under greater <b>mechanical</b> task <b>demands,</b> decreasing effective landing height and reducing landing impulse. Alterations in movement variability were interpreted in the context of the available functional degrees of freedom at each lower extremity joint, aligning with physiological predictions and theories from motor control.

50|$|The {{bond coat}} adheres the {{thermal barrier coating}} to the {{superalloy}} substrate. Additionally, the bond coat provides oxidation protection and functions as a diffusion barrier against the motion of substrate atoms towards the environment.There are five major types of bond coats, the aluminides, the platinum-aluminides, MCrAlY, cobalt-cermets, and nickel-chromium.For the aluminide bond coatings, the final composition {{and structure of the}} coating depends on the composition of the substrate. Aluminides also lack ductility below 750 °C, and exhibit a limited by thermomechanical fatigue strength. The Pt-aluminides are very similar to the aluminide bond coats except for a layer of Pt (5—10 μm) deposited on the blade. The Pt is believed to aid in oxide adhesion and contributes to hot corrosion. The cost of Pt plating is justified by the increased blade life span. The MCrAlY is the latest generation of bond coat and does not strongly interact with the substrate. Normally applied by plasma spraying, MCrAlY coatings are secondary aluminum oxide formers. This means that the coatings form an outer layer of chromium oxide (chromia), and a secondary aluminum oxide (alumina) layer underneath. These oxide formations occur at high temperatures in the range of those that superalloys usually encounter. The chromia provides oxidation and hot-corrosion resistance. The alumina controls oxidation mechanisms by limiting oxide growth by self-passivating. The yttrium enhances the oxide adherence to the substrate, and limits the growth of grain boundaries (which can lead to flaking of the coating). Investigation indicates that addition of rhenium and tantalum increases oxidation resistance. Cobalt-cermet based coatings consisting of materials such as tungsten carbide/cobalt can be used due to excellent resistance to abrasion, corrosion, erosion, and heat. These cermet coatings perform well in situations where temperature and oxidation damage are significant concerns, such as boilers. One of the unique advantages of cobalt cermet coatings is a minimal loss of coating mass over time, due to the strength of carbides within the mixture. Overall, cermet coatings are useful in situations where <b>mechanical</b> <b>demands</b> are equal to chemical demands for superalloys. Nickel-chromium coatings are used most frequently in boilers fed by fossil fuels, electric furnaces, and waste incineration furnaces, where the danger of oxidizing agents and corrosive compounds in the vapor must be dealt with. The specific method of spray-coating depends on the composition of the coatings. Nickel-chromium coatings that also contain iron or aluminum perform much better (in terms of corrosion resistance) when they are sprayed and laser glazed, while pure nickel-chromium coatings perform better when thermally sprayed exclusively.|$|E

Muscle function {{may be considered}} as the time-course and amplitude of muscle length change (i. e. strain) and force generation in relation to skeletal kinematics and muscle activation (see, for example, Altringham and Ellerby, 1999; Biewener et al., 1998; Finni et al., 2000).

Most biomaterials {{need to be}} reinforced with supporting structures such as knittings, meshes or electrospun material {{to comply with the}} <b>mechanical</b> <b>demands</b> of native tissues. In this study, coupled helical coils (CHCs) were manufactured to mimic collagen fiber orientation as found in nature. Monofilaments of different commercially available biodegradable polymers were wound and subsequently fused, resulting in right-handed and left-handed polymer helices fused together in joints where the filaments cross. CHCs of different polymer composition were tested to determine the tensile strength, strain recovery, hysteresis, compressive strength and degradation of CHCs of different composition. Subsequently, seamless and stable hybrid constructs consisting of PDSII(R) USP 2 - 0 CHCs embedded in porous collagen type I were produced. Compared to collagen alone, this hybrid showed superior strain recovery (93. 5 +/- 0. 9 % vs 71. 1 +/- 12. 6 % in longitudinal direction; 87. 1 +/- 6. 6 % vs 57. 2 +/- 4. 6 % in circumferential direction) and hysteresis (18. 9 +/- 2. 7 % vs 51. 1 +/- 12. 0 % in longitudinal direction; 11. 5 +/- 4. 6 % vs 46. 3 +/- 6. 3 % in circumferential direction). Furthermore, this hybrid construct showed an improved Young's modulus in both longitudinal (0. 5 +/- 0. 1 MPavs 0. 2 +/- 0. 1 MPa; 2. 5 -fold) and circumferential (1. 65 +/- 0. 07 MPavs (2. 9 +/- 0. 3) x 10 - 2 MPa; 57 -fold) direction, respectively, compared to templates created from collagen alone. Moreover, hybrid template characteristics could be modified by changing the CHC composition and CHCs were produced showing a mechanical behavior similar to the native ureter. CHC-enforced templates, which are easily tunable to meet different demands may be promising for tubular tissue engineering. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Most tubular constructs lack sufficient strength and tunability to comply with the <b>mechanical</b> <b>demands</b> of native tissues. Therefore, we embedded coupled helical coils (CHCs) produced from biodegradable polymers - to mimic collagen fiber orientation as found in nature - in collagen type I sponges. We show that the mechanical behavior of CHCs is very similar to native tissue and strengths structurally weak tubular constructs. The production procedure is relatively easy, reproducible and mechanical features can be controlled to meet different <b>mechanical</b> <b>demands.</b> This is promising in template manufacture, hence offering new opportunities in tissue engineering of tubular organs and preventing graft failure...|$|E

30|$|While {{this study}} {{presents}} novel findings pertaining to biceps femoris muscle activation during concentric, eccentric and a coupled concentric-eccentric, stretch-shortening cycle, {{there are some}} limitations to the current study.

The landing task associated with the purely concentric contraction was performed from a height of 0.45  m while the counter movement jump was conducted from standing height. The substantially lower <b>mechanical</b> <b>demand</b> associated with the concentric component of the counter movement jump may underlie the significant differences in muscle activation between the two movements. A second limitation {{of the present study}} is that the scope of this study only pertains to muscle activation rather than lower extremity kinetics, muscle forces or tension within the elastic components of the muscle-tendon unit.

Improving understanding of how humans control interaction forces during goal-directed tasks may aid in improving performance and reducing injury risk. Modeling allows us to explore causal mechanisms and test hypotheses regarding control and dynamics of human movement. In this thesis, experimentally validated dynamic models were used to study how modifications in control affect performance and mechanical loading in different contexts including wheelchair propulsion, landings, and springboard diving. In both 2 D and 3 D models of wheelchair propulsion, redirection of the reaction force (RF) {{was found to be}} an effective mechanism for redistributing load across the elbow and shoulder without decrements in task performance. How RF affects load distribution was found to be subject specific and dependent on time in push cycle and the configuration of the user in the wheelchair. In land-and-stop tasks, increases in knee and hip joint flexion at contact reduced peak impact force and impulse generated during the impact phase, increased ability to generate impulse during the post impact phase (PIP), and increased either the <b>mechanical</b> <b>demand</b> or time required to reduce CM momentum to zero during PIP. Simulations of a forward somersault dive performed on a springboard revealed that increasing forward tip of the body during flight decreased CM vertical velocity but increased CM horizontal velocity and angular momentum at departure. Increase in downward CM velocity at board contact increased all momenta at departure. Increased squat depth at contact increased vertical velocity but decrease horizontal velocity and angular momentum of the CM at departure. Increasing hip flexion and knee extension excursions during board recoil increased angular impulse generation at departure. Overall, we found that there exists multiple ways to achieve the mechanical objectives of each task.; Results show that modifications in strategy include regulation of RF and segment kinematics of the upper / lower extremities, which alter the magnitude and distribution of <b>mechanical</b> <b>demand</b> experienced.

40|$|Bone is able {{to react}} to {{changing}} <b>mechanical</b> <b>demands</b> by adapting its internal microstructure through bone forming and resorbing cells. This process is called bone modeling and remodeling. It is evident that changes in <b>mechanical</b> <b>demands</b> at the organ level must be interpreted at the tissue level where bone (re) modeling takes place. Although assumed for a long time, {{the relationship between the}} locations of bone formation and resorption and the local mechanical environment is still under debate. The lack of suitable imaging modalities for measuring bone formation and resorption in vivo has made it difficult to assess the mechanoregulation of bone three-dimensionally by experiment. Using in vivo micro-computed tomography and high resolution finite element analysis in living mice, we show that bone formation most likely occurs at sites of high local mechanical strain (p, 0. 0001) and resorption at sites of low local mechanical strain (p, 0. 0001). Furthermore, the probability of bone resorption decreases exponentially with increasing mechanical stimulus (R 2 = 0. 99) whereas the probability of bone formation follows an exponential growth function to a maximum value (R 2 = 0. 99). Moreover, resorption is more strictly controlled than formation in loaded animals, and ovariectomy increases the amount of non-targeted resorption. Our experimental assessment of mechanoregulation at the tissue level does not show any evidence of a lazy zone and suggests that around 80 % of all (re) modeling can be linked to the mechanical micro-environment. These findings disclose how mechanical stimuli at the tissue level contribute to the regulation of bone adaptation at the organ level...|$|E

Recently developed wavelet and principal components analysis of intramuscular myoelectric signals has linked signals with lower and higher frequency contents {{to the use of}} slower and faster motor unit populations. In this study we estimated the relative contributions of lower and higher frequency signals of cat ankle extensors (soleus, medial and lateral gastrocnemii, plantaris) during level, downslope and upslope walking and the paw-shake response. This was done using the first two myoelectric signal principal components (PCI, PCII), explaining over 90 % of the signal, and an angle, a function of PCI/PCII, indicating the relative contribution of slower and faster motor unit populations. Mean myoelectric frequencies in all walking conditions were lowest for slow soleus (234 Hz) and highest for fast gastrocnemii (307 and 330 Hz) muscles. Motor unit populations within and across the studied muscles that demonstrated lower myoelectric frequency (suggesting slower populations) were recruited during tasks and movement phases with lower <b>mechanical</b> <b>demands</b> on the ankle extensors - during downslope and level walking and in early walking stance and paw-shake phases. With increasing <b>mechanical</b> <b>demands</b> (upslope walking, mid-phase of paw-shake cycles), motor unit populations generating higher frequency signals (suggesting faster populations) contributed progressively more. We conclude that the myoelectric frequency contents within and between feline ankle extensors vary across studied motor behaviours, with patterns that are generally consistent with muscle fibre-type composition. © 2012.

In-response to exertion, MFS and FFS runners demonstrated reductions in peak torque, median frequency, and ankle energy absorption, and an increase in loading rate.

40|$|The {{specific}} mechanisms regulating {{bone mass}} are not known, but most investigators agree that bone maintenance is largely dependent upon <b>mechanical</b> <b>demand</b> {{and the resultant}} local bone strains. During space flight, bone loss such as that reported by LeBlanc et al. may result from failure to effectively load the skeleton and generate sufficient localized bone strains.

It follows that the ability to prevent bone loss is critically dependent upon the external ground reaction forces (GRFs) and skeletal loads imparted by the tethering system. To our knowledge, the loads during orbital flight have been measured only once (on STS 81). Based on these data and data from ground based experiments, it appears likely that interventions designed to prevent bone loss in micro-gravity generate GRFs substantially less than body weight. It is unknown to what degree reductions in external GRFs will affect internal bone strain and thus the bone maintenance response.

However, there is little quantitative evidence to corroborate this notion. Objective: To estimate the forces and torque on the knee joint in healthy individuals during free squatting exercises using weights performed in two different ways: a) knee not going beyond a vertical line going through the toes; b) knee going beyond this vertical line. Method: Three-dimensional analysis using video cameras and a force platform was performed on squatting movements performed by ten healthy young adults. Fifteen repetitions of each of the two squatting conditions were performed by each subject on the force plate. The forces and joint torque at the ankle, knee and hip were calculated using an inverse dynamic procedure. Results: The results obtained showed that the mean peak torque on the knee was around 38 ± 31 % greater, and the mean patellofemoral force was around 28 ± 27 % greater, when the knee went beyond the tip of the foot, than when it did not. Conclusions: These results demonstrate that, when the knee does not go beyond the line of the foot, the patellofemoral compression force is less, which leads to lower <b>mechanical</b> <b>demand</b> on this joint.

This review first considers the mechanical factors that are generated by loading in the skeleton, including strain, stress and pressure. Mechanosensitive cells placed to recognize these forces in the skeleton, osteoblasts, osteoclasts, osteocytes and cells of the vasculature are reviewed. The identity of the mechanoreceptor(s) is approached, with consideration of ion channels, integrins, connexins, the lipid membrane including caveolar and noncaveolar lipid rafts and the possibility that altering cell shape at the membrane or cytoskeleton alters integral signaling protein associations. The distal intracellular signaling systems on-line after the mechanoreceptor is activated are reviewed, including those emanating from G-proteins (e. g., intracellular calcium shifts), MAPKs, and nitric oxide. The ability to harness mechanical signals to improve bone health through devices and exercise is broached.
