50|$|Mie {{theory is}} very {{important}} in <b>meteorological</b> <b>optics,</b> where diameter-to-wavelength ratios of the order of unity and larger are characteristic for many problems regarding haze and cloud scattering. A further application is in the characterization of particles by optical scattering measurements. The Mie solution is also important for understanding the appearance of common materials like milk, biological tissue and latex paint.|$|E
5000|$|At Innsbruck {{he began}} a number of works {{including}} papers on the conditions of wind, humidity, radiation, and <b>meteorological</b> <b>optics.</b> In his most important work [...] "Atmospherische Optik", he collected all published treatises and also supplied original papers necessary to complete certain subjects; he died before he had finished it. His German translation of Abercromby's work, [...] "The weather", is also noteworthy.|$|E
50|$|Sylvanshine is {{an optical}} {{phenomenon}} in which dew-covered plant species whose leaves are wax-covered retroreflect beams of light, {{as from a}} vehicle's headlights, sometimes causing trees {{to appear to be}} snow-covered at night during the summer. The phenomenon was named and explained in 1994 by Professor Alistair Fraser of Pennsylvania State University, an expert in <b>meteorological</b> <b>optics.</b> According to his explanation, the wax on the leaves causes water to form beads, which become, in effect, lenses. These lenses focus the light to a spot {{on the surface of the}} leaf, and the image of this spot is directed as rays in the opposite direction.|$|E
5000|$|The Niagara Science Museum {{was founded}} by Nick Dalacu, a {{physicist}} who amassed a personal collection of hundreds of historically significant instruments and technologies over four decades. The museum presents its collection in 'living laboratories' {{in the style of}} the wunderkammern, or cabinet of curiosity, of Renaissance Europe. [...] Its dozen rooms include laboratories dedicated to high-voltage electronics and galvanometers, a large collection of microscopes and <b>optics,</b> <b>meteorological</b> instruments, communication and media technologies, hydraulics and vacuum technologies, medical technologies, computing history, and others. It also houses the Charlie Troutman Printing Press Room, a working letterpress studio using a 1914 Chandler & Price press. The museum is housed in the former Union Carbide building, built in 1910, and restored to house the museum's collection, and is currently powered by an array of solar cells on its roof.|$|R

40|$|The {{phenomenon}} {{called the}} "sub-Sun" is the specular reflection of sunlight by horizontally oriented plates of ice. Although well-known in <b>meteorological</b> <b>optics,</b> the hydrodynamics of the orientation is not quantitatively understood. I review {{the theory of}} torques on objects at low Reynolds numbers, define coefficients C_o, C_p, and C_ψ which describe the orienting torques on discs, rods, and hexagonal prisms, and report here the results of experiments to measure C_o and C_p.

40|$|This is a {{magnificent}} and scholarly book, exquisitely produced, and definitely not destined {{only for the}} coffee table. It is multifaceted in character, addressing rainbow-relevant aspects of mythology, religion, the history of art, art criticism, the history of optics, the theory of color, the philosophy of science, and advertising! The quality of the reproductions and photographs is superb. The authors are experts in <b>meteorological</b> <b>optics,</b> but their book draws on many other subdisciplines. It is a challenge, therefore, to write a review about a book that contains no equations or explicit mathematical themes for what is primarily a mathematical audience. However, while the mathematical description of the rainbow may be hidden in this book, it is nonetheless present. Clearly, such a review {{runs the risk of}} giving a distorted picture of what the book is about, both by “unfolding ” the hidden mathematics and suppressing, to some extent, John A. Adam is professor of mathematics at Old Dominio...|$|E
40|$|Celestial {{visibility}} is {{the study}} of the limits of observability of objects in the sky, with application to deducing the truth about historical events or to the derivation of astronomical information of modern utility. This study is based on what is seen by ordinary humans, either in their everyday lives or at times of historical events. The results of such studies have more relevance to non-scientists than does any other area of astronomy. Celestial visibility is a young discipline {{in the sense that the}} number of interesting applications with simple solutions outnumber the solved problems; it is a broad interdisciplinary field that involves work with astronomy, meteorology, optics, physics, physiology, history, and archeology. Each of these disciplines contribute specialized mathematical formulations which quantify the many processes that affect light as it leaves a source, traverses the atmosphere, and is detected by the human eye. These formulas can then be combined as appropriate to create mathematical models for the visibility of the source under the conditions of interest. These model results can then be applied a wide variety of problems arising in history, astronomy, archeology, <b>meteorological</b> <b>optics,</b> and archeoastronomy. This review also presents a dozen suggestions for observing projects, many of which can be directly taken for individual study, for classroom projects, or for professional research...|$|E
