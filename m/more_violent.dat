5|$|By 1944, Belgian collaborationist groups {{began to}} feel {{increasingly}} abandoned by the German government as the situation deteriorated. As resistance attacks against them escalated, collaborationist parties became <b>more</b> <b>violent</b> and launched reprisals against civilians, including the Courcelles Massacre in August 1944.|$|E
5|$|As of 2017, {{there are}} twenty-eight Treehouse of Horror episodes, with one airing every year. They {{are known for}} being <b>more</b> <b>violent</b> than an average Simpsons episode and contain several {{different}} trademarks, including the alien characters Kang and Kodos who have appeared in every episode. Quite often the segments will parody well-known movies, books, radio shows, and television shows. The Twilight Zone has been parodied quite often, and {{has served as the}} inspiration for numerous segments.|$|E
5|$|Bromine pentafluoride (BrF5) {{was first}} {{synthesised}} in 1930. It is produced {{on a large}} scale by direct reaction of bromine with excess fluorine at temperatures higher than 150°C, and on a small scale by the fluorination of potassium bromide at 25°C. It is a very vigorous fluorinating agent, although chlorine trifluoride is still <b>more</b> <b>violent.</b> Bromine pentafluoride explodes on reaction with water and fluorinates silicates at 450°C.|$|E
50|$|Unrestricted by TV's censors, {{the film}} is far <b>more</b> {{graphically}} <b>violent</b> than its television counterpart, with dripping vampire bites and bloody deaths. The film was released {{at the height of}} the TV show's popularity to great commercial success.|$|R

5|$|Budgetary reasons caused Licence to Kill to be {{the first}} Bond film shot {{completely}} outside the United Kingdom, with locations in both Florida and Mexico. The film earned over $156 million worldwide, and enjoyed a generally positive critical reception, with ample praise for the stunts, but attracted some criticism of Dalton's dark and violent interpretation of Bond {{and the fact that the}} film was significantly darker and <b>more</b> <b>violent</b> than its predecessors.|$|E
5|$|John Barry was not {{available}} to score the film because of throat surgery, so the soundtrack's score was composed and conducted by Michael Kamen, who was known for scoring many action films at the time, such as Lethal Weapon and Die Hard. The film's darker and <b>more</b> <b>violent</b> plot elicited calls for cuts by the British Board of Film Classification.|$|E
5|$|The volcano also erupted phreatically several times, as {{recorded}} by Vogel in 1913 and 1920, with its activity increasing from 1916 to 1926. During these years, the eruptions grew {{more frequent and}} <b>more</b> <b>violent.</b> A major outburst on November 2, 1927 started a period of nearly continuous violent eruptions that lasted until 1929. During this period, Cerro Azul sometimes erupted daily, sending columns of ash as far as 6 or 7 kilometers (about 4mi) into the air. Quizapu Crater grew slightly during this eruptive period.|$|E

40|$|During {{the past}} 30 years, {{behavioral}} and cognitive-behavioral theories of rape have evolved considerably. The influence of etio-logic {{factors related to}} personality, however, is limited to antisocial traits. The aim {{of the current study}} was, therefore, to investigate the presence of personality disorders in rapists. Forty-nine incarcerated rapists answered a French translation of the Millon Clinical Multiaxial Inventory questionnaire. On the basis of the Avery-Clark and Laws criteria (1983), 31 rapists were classified as less physically violent and 18 as <b>more</b> physically <b>violent.</b> Among the less physically violent rapists, we encountered most frequently avoidant, dependant, passive-aggressive and schizoid personality disorders. Among the <b>more</b> physically <b>violent</b> rapists, an antisocial personality disorder was predominant. The implications of these results concerning rape theories are being discussed...|$|R
5|$|Washington {{was deeply}} irritated by this subversive meddling, and when Genêt allowed a French-sponsored warship to sail out of Philadelphia against direct presidential orders, Washington demanded that France recall Genêt. However, {{by this time}} the {{revolution}} had taken a <b>more</b> <b>violent</b> approach and Genêt would have been executed had he returned to France. He appealed to Washington, and Washington allowed him to remain, making him the first political refugee to seek sanctuary in the United States.|$|E
5|$|Augusta, Lady Gregory retold many of {{the legends}} of Cú Chulainn in her 1902 book Cuchulain of Muirthemne, which paraphrased the originals but also romanticized some of the tales and omitted most of the <b>more</b> <b>violent</b> content. This first {{translation}} was very popular, supported by the Celtic Revival movement. It featured an introduction by her friend William Butler Yeats, who wrote several pieces based on the legend, including the plays On Baile's Strand (1904), The Green Helmet (1910), At the Hawk's Well (1917), The Only Jealousy of Emer (1919) and The Death of Cuchulain (1939), and a poem, Cuchulain's Fight with the Sea (1892).|$|E
5|$|Cagney {{was even}} <b>more</b> <b>violent</b> towards {{women in the}} gangster film Picture Snatcher (1933): in one scene, he knocks out an amorous woman whose {{feelings}} he does not reciprocate and violently throws her into the backseat of his car. In April 1931, the same month as the release of The Public Enemy, Hays recruited former police chief August Vollmer to conduct {{a study on the}} effect gangster pictures had on children. After he had finished his work, Vollmer stated that gangster films were innocuous and even overly favorable in depicting the police. Although Hays used the results to defend the film industry, the New York State censorship board was not impressed, and from 1930 through 1932, removed 2,200 crime scenes from pictures.|$|E

50|$|As American hip hop lyrics, {{as part of}} the {{gangsta rap}} genre, became <b>more</b> widely <b>violent,</b> so did {{international}} hip hop lyrics, and Greece was no exception. Rapping about guns, drugs, violence and sex became the norm. Hardcore Greek rap had swept the genre, and commercial hip hop followed suit.|$|R

5|$|Like Nasser, Gaddafi favoured the Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and his group, Fatah, {{over more}} militant and Marxist Palestinian groups. As the years progressed however, Gaddafi's {{relationship}} with Arafat became strained, with Gaddafi considering him too moderate {{and calling for}} <b>more</b> <b>violent</b> action. Instead he supported militias like the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine – General Command, the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine, As-Sa'iqa, the Palestinian Popular Struggle Front, and the Abu Nidal Organization. He funded the Black September Organization whose members perpetrated the 1972 Munich massacre of Israeli athletes in West Germany, and had the killed militants' bodies flown to Libya for a hero's funeral.|$|E
5|$|Many Japanese manga and anime {{have also}} adopted the western genre. Yasuhiro Nightow {{is known for}} {{creating}} the space western Trigun. The story's protagonist, Vash the Stampede, is a wandering gunslinger with a dark past. Unlike other violence-themed gunslingers, Vash carries a Shane-like pacifist attitude, and avoids killing men, even dangerous enemies. Behind him is the gun-toting priest named Nicholas D. Wolfwood, who carries with him a heavy machine gun and rocket launcher shaped like a cross. Nicholas is <b>more</b> <b>violent</b> than Vash, and the two would often argue about killing opponents. Other western genre themed manga and anime include Cowboy Bebop and Kino's Journey, who both incorporate knight-errant gunslinger themes.|$|E
5|$|<b>More</b> <b>violent</b> eruptions are {{possible}} only in unique circumstances, {{such as an}} eruption into a lake. Any future eruption {{is most likely to}} affect only a limited area downslope from the volcano. Poisonous substances, such as volcanic gas, includes a variety of substances. These include gases trapped in cavities (vesicles) in volcanic rocks, dissolved or dissoclated gases in magma and lava, or gases emanating directly from lava or indirectly through ground water heated by volcanic action. The volcanic gases that pose the greatest potential hazard to people, animals, agriculture, and property are sulfur dioxide, carbon dioxide and hydrogen fluoride. Locally, sulfur dioxide gas can lead to acid rain and air pollution downwind from the volcano.|$|E
50|$|As {{drug cartels}} and TCOs have {{increasingly}} {{made use of}} these areas, the groups have become progressively <b>more</b> complex, <b>violent,</b> and diverse. Trafficking {{has been accompanied by}} other forms of illegal activity - such as extortion, kidnappings, and political corruption - as disparate factions compete for control over the same, lucrative areas.|$|R
5000|$|The album {{release was}} preceded by that of a digital EP (released 20 November) which gave {{its name to the}} first single from the album, [...] "Ma part d'ombre".

30|$|Conflicts {{related to}} {{livestock}} raiding {{are not new}} phenomena in many pastoral societies in the Horn of Africa. Traditionally, various pastoral communities use raiding as a cultural practice for restocking of herds, especially after periods of drought or outbreaks of diseases.

5|$|Rabaul fell within MacArthur's area, but {{the initial}} {{operations}} in the southern Solomon Islands came under Nimitz. The Japanese reaction to Task One, the seizure of {{the southern part of}} the Solomon Islands, was <b>more</b> <b>violent</b> than anticipated and some months passed before the Guadalcanal Campaign was brought to a successful conclusion. Meanwhile, General MacArthur's forces fought off a series of Japanese offensives in Papua in the Kokoda Track campaign, Battle of Milne Bay, Battle of Buna–Gona, the Battle of Wau and the Battle of the Bismarck Sea.|$|E
5|$|Scully tells Doggett {{that while}} the DNA test disproves Fassl's culpability, it implicates a {{possible}} blood relative; Fassl, however, is an only child. Reyes proposes that the murders are being conducted by an entity rather than a person. Meanwhile, Fassl approaches Assistant District Attorney Damon Kaylor and begs to {{be sent back to}} prison. Kaylor refuses, but is killed by the Bearded Man. After hearing of Kaylor's disappearance, Reyes theorizes that Fassl's piety and his unwillingness to acknowledge his darker half has given him the unwanted ability to physically change into another, <b>more</b> <b>violent</b> person.|$|E
5|$|The few impact craters on Triton {{are almost}} all {{concentrated}} in the leading hemisphere—that facing {{the direction of the}} orbital motion—with the majority concentrated around the equator between 30° and 70° longitude, resulting from material swept up from orbit around Neptune. Because it orbits with one side permanently facing the planet, astronomers expect that Triton should have fewer impacts on its trailing hemisphere, due to impacts on the leading hemisphere being more frequent and <b>more</b> <b>violent.</b> Voyager 2 imaged only 40% of Triton's surface, so this remains uncertain.|$|E

5|$|A three-part series {{published}} between November 1993 and January 1994, {{the series}} introduces attorney Beck as a love interest for Brock. When Beck pursues {{a lawsuit against}} Scarmore Industries for employees poisoned by a sentient liquid-mercury virus, Venom is injured trying {{to protect her from}} the Juggernaut's kidnap attempt. The symbiote is submerged and infected with the sentient virus (which heals Brock), bonding with the pair and introducing a third mind into their relationship. The virus drives Brock insane (causing him to murder a cleaning lady), and he is physically transported to the realm of insanity to confront its avatars: Paranoia, Dusk and the Necromancer. The symbiote overcomes the virus; Brock regains his senses, and Venom is returned to earth. Beck later insists on only being Brock's friend, because his romantic feelings for her make him <b>more</b> <b>violent.</b> Among DCD's 300 bestselling issues of 1993 Venom: The Madness #1 was number 173; the remaining issues did not chart.|$|E
5|$|Exploration of {{the docks}} reveals a strange {{canister}} filled with swirling liquid. Thinking the canister contains healing or energizing properties, the Shaper breaks the seal and absorbs the contents. Instead the contents absorb into the Shaper's body, strengthening and changing it. The changes become visibly apparent, the player character's skin smoothens and glows slightly. The canisters also affect the user's mental state, causing a <b>more</b> <b>violent</b> and arrogant temperament. Serviles {{remain on the}} island, having been abandoned when the island was Barred. They are intelligent creations of Shapers, designed to serve them without question or hesitation. These Serviles have had no contact with Shapers for two centuries, and have separated into three groups with differing philosophies regarding their creators. The Obeyers are still faithful to the Shapers, the Awakened believe {{that they should be}} treated as equals. The Takers have rejected Shapers completely and view the sect as oppressors to be fought.|$|E
5|$|Giant planets can {{significantly}} influence terrestrial planet formation. The presence of giants tends to increase eccentricities and inclinations (see Kozai mechanism) of planetesimals and embryos in the terrestrial planet region (inside 4AU in the Solar System). If giant planets form too early, they can slow or prevent inner planet accretion. If they form {{near the end}} of the oligarchic stage, as is thought to have happened in the Solar System, they will influence the merges of planetary embryos, making them <b>more</b> <b>violent.</b> As a result, the number of terrestrial planets will decrease and they will be more massive. In addition, the size of the system will shrink, because terrestrial planets will form closer to the central star. The influence of giant planets in the Solar System, particularly that of Jupiter, is thought to have been limited because they are relatively remote from the terrestrial planets.|$|E
