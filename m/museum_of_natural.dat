5|$|Fossils now {{attributed}} to Dimetrodon were first studied by American paleontologist Edward Drinker Cope in the 1870s. Cope had obtained the fossils {{along with those}} of many other Permian tetrapods (four-limbed vertebrates) from several collectors who had been exploring a group of rocks in Texas called the Red Beds. Among these collectors were Swiss naturalist Jacob Boll, Texas geologist W. F. Cummins, and amateur paleontologist Charles Hazelius Sternberg. Most of Cope's specimens went to the American <b>Museum</b> <b>of</b> <b>Natural</b> History or to the University of Chicago's Walker Museum (most of the Walker fossil collection is now housed in the Field <b>Museum</b> <b>of</b> <b>Natural</b> History).|$|E
