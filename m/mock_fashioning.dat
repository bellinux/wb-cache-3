2500|$|In 1958, Bazlen won the {{starring}} role in the children’s program The Blue Fairy, broadcast by the independent station WGN-TV in Chicago on Monday nights (7.30pm–8.00pm). It {{was one of the}} earliest children’s shows to be produced in color. The producer of the show had spotted Bazlen playing hopscotch outside of Bazlen's Chicago home and told Bazlen's mother that [...] "your little girl is just right for my TV series". In the show, the Blue Fairy, played by Bazlen, lived in the “Blue Forest." [...] Dressed in a blue gown and diamond tiara, she also clasped a [...] silver wand. At the beginning of each show, Bazlen, suspended by wires, would fly (as if on elfin wings) across the stage saying “I’m the Blue Fairy, I’ll grant you a wish to make all your dreams come true." [...] She would then sit on an oversized mushroom visited by creatures such as Tugnacious R. Jones, Myrtle Flower, and an old nasal voiced wizard (which were puppets designed by George Nelle and writer-director Don Kane), and introduced stories enacted by the Rufus Rose Marionettes. They also engaged in various projects which included constructing a popcorn machine that would not stop popping and making a sewing machine that turned out marbles. Bazlen won enormous critical praise for her performance (one critic describing it as “beguiling” and “mesmerising” and Hedda Hopper declared Bazlen “the Celtic Alice in Wonderland”) and the show was recognised as the top children’s program of 1958 winning a Peabody Award. Bazlen herself said of her role that she [...] "flew around and had a wonderful time." [...] Although The Blue Fairy could only be seen locally in Chicago on Channel 9, the Peabody Award it won brought it and Bazlen to national attention. Furthermore, the show also inspired Ernie Kovacs into doing one of his notorious comedy sketches where Kovacs (wearing a mustache, chewing a cigar, dressed in a blue gown and blonde wig, and holding a silver wand) flew across a stage, slammed head first into a wall on the opposite side, and was then left dangling lifelessly (in <b>mock</b> <b>fashion)</b> in mid-air.|$|R

40|$|Includes {{recorded}} audio {{files in}} WAV and MP 3 formats, 58 : 23 in length. The recital presented {{a variety of}} musical genres ranging from baroque arias of Handel to contemporary cabaret songs {{of the twentieth century}} composer William Bolcom. The program opened with three Italian da capo arias by Handel. These arias are typical of ltalian opera seria and also show the emerging new galant style of the Romantic era. They are in the standard A-B-A form. The first aria "Dove sei" is from the opera Rodelinda. In this aria Bertarido grieves for his wife as he witnesses her infidelity. His grief is felt {{in the first half of}} this aria, a largo in E major in a slow triple meter. The middle section makes the normal modulations, but suggests greater excitement and emotional disturbance by a more rapid delivery, without changing the overall mood of the piece. Sixteenth note and thirty-second note figures appear in the vocal line whereas the accompaniment still predominantly plays the eighth note arpeggios of the first section, sustaining the overall mood of the piece. The second aria is from Alcina, an opera filled with magic and sorcery, drawn from the Renaissance epic Orlando Furioso by Ariosto. In this aria, Ruggiero's fianc??e comes to rescue him dressed as a man. Ruggiero does not believe that the man before him is a woman and sings in a <b>mocking</b> <b>fashion,</b> "La bocca vaga. " Most of the opera Alcina is in high baroque style, but it is unique in that it includes several fine arias in a galant or nearly galant style. "La bocca vaga" is in the newer galant style. In the third aria, Handel once again sets aside the bigger-than-life style of baroque opera to tackle the passions o fhuman emotions. The third aria "Ah tu non sai" is from the opera Ottone. Ottone deals with love, mistaken jealousy, pirates and intrigue. The theme of ???Ah tu non sai" is unrequited love. The aria opens in the somber key of A minor as the voice laments, "Ah tu non sai" (you don't know). The second section of the aria changes to the unusual key of G minor, but it is still contrasting through a more rapid, excited vocal delivery. Brahms' Zigeunerlieder are fiery nationalistic songs typical of the Romantic era of music, set to the poetry of H. Conrat. Brahms wrote two hundred Lieder (songs) throughout his career. Most of his Lieder are strophic songs, modified strophic songs or simple episodic forms. Zigeunerlieder, Opus 103, is a series of eight simple strophic songs, the verses of which are mostly in binary form (a a' b b'). They are interesting in that Brahms weaves gypsy rhythms and melodies with traditional art song form. The first song, "He Zigeuner" is a prime example. The piano accompaniment plays two sixteenth notes separated by eighth rests mimicking the strum of a guitar as the voice calls out "Hey gypsy strike the strings" in a dotted quarter note followed by an eighth note rhythm that is characteristic of gypsy dance music. One might easily assume that these songs were traditional gypsy folk songs instead of original compositions by Brahms and Conrat, reflecting the popular style in the nineteenth century of borrowing from the world of folk music. The aria "I Have Dreamt" is from the modern opera Wuthering Heights, written by the contemporary American film composer, Bernard Herrmann. Wuthering Heights is based on the original story by Emily Bronte. It was completed in 1951 but did not receive a stage production unti 11982. The aria is sung by Cathy, the central character of the story. In this aria she tells her servant about a dream she had of being taken from her home by angels. (See more in text. ...|$|R

5000|$|While {{the image}} entertains purely {{by the number}} of {{references}} to noisy activities crammed into the scene, the play-bill for Gay's The Beggar's Opera, prominently displayed on the wall next to the musician's window, hints at developments in British music at the time. The Beggar's Opera had enjoyed extraordinary success and had caused, or at least coincided with, a shift in the taste of audiences away from Italian opera and towards [...] "British" [...] music and homegrown culture. Hogarth was an enthusiastic supporter of the change in public tastes. He had mocked the vogue for continental fashions in many of his works (A Rake's Progress and Marriage à-la-mode both have scenes dedicated to the foolishness of the Levée, and, in 1724, even before The Beggar's Opera, in the earliest of his self-published satirical prints The Bad Taste of the Town Hogarth <b>mocked</b> the <b>fashion</b> for Italian opera and Italian opera singers). The play-bill here is anachronistic as it advertises the play with the original 1728 cast. The musician's identity has never been satisfactorily established. He is identified as an Italian both by Jean André Rouquet, whose French notes on the prints were approved by Hogarth, and by John Trusler who claimed Hogarth's widow's approval for his Hogarth Moralized. He has been variously identified as a number of foreign musicians of the time, including [...] "Corvetto, well known by the name of Nosee" [...] (probably Giacobbe Cervetto, often caricaturized for his large nose), and Pietro Castrucci, the leader of Handel's orchestra. Handel had noted the shift in public taste himself, and from the 1730s he composed more English oratorio and theatre works, including the setting the works of Milton, Dryden and Congreve to music. Hogarth, as well as comically juxtaposing high and low culture, could be suggesting that a foreign tradition is being silenced by a burgeoning sense of Britishness. This may have been an afterthought though, as the playbill was not present in the earliest impressions, and the hautboy player and paver are usually respectively identified as Jewish and Irish, while the drummer boy is dressed in the same fashion as the young Huguenot leaving the church in Noon, the second scene of Hogarth's Four Times of the Day. The musician has also been identified as John Festin (mistakenly rendered as Foster in some accounts), a teacher of the flute and hautboy, by Hogarth's friend and biographer John Ireland and later by the commentator John Trusler. The story Festin told Hogarth obviously provided the inspiration for {{at least part of the}} scene: ...|$|R
