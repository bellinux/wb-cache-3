50|$|The lock of a <b>muzzle-loading</b> <b>firearm</b> is {{the system}} used to ignite the propellant. Types of lock include matchlock, wheellock, snaplock, snaphance, miquelet lock, doglock, flintlock, modern percussion, closed bolt, open bolt, {{rotating}} bolt, and experimental electronic types. Parts of the lock can include the wheel (for wheellocks) and the hammer and frizzen (for flintlocks). A complete muzzleloader consists of lock, stock, and barrel. In breech-loading weapons, the general mechanism for handling ammunition {{is known as the}} firearm action.|$|E
50|$|The Spanish M1752 Musket was a <b>muzzle-loading</b> <b>firearm</b> {{invented in}} 1752 {{and used by}} the Spanish Army from then until it was widely {{replaced}} by the much more effective minié rifles during the mid-19th century. The M1752 was the first standardized firearm utilized by the Spanish Army and was deployed in the Spanish American Colonies, where it saw action during the British invasion of Cuba. Spain also provided around 10,000 up to 12,000 muskets to the American rebels during their struggle against the British.|$|E
50|$|The blunderbuss is a <b>muzzle-loading</b> <b>firearm</b> with a short, large caliber barrel, {{which is}} flared at the muzzle and {{frequently}} {{throughout the entire}} bore, and used with shot and other projectiles of relevant quantity and/or caliber. The blunderbuss could {{be considered to be}} an early form of shotgun, which was often adapted to military and defensive use. It was effective at short ranges, but lacked accuracy for targets at long range. A blunderbuss in handgun form was called a dragon, and it is from this that the term dragoon evolved.|$|E

2500|$|Also {{during the}} 1960s, {{part of the}} {{national}} forest was designated a Primitive Weapons Area (renamed Pioneer Weapons Area) and set apart for hunting with longbow, crossbow, or <b>muzzle-loading</b> <b>firearms</b> (either flintlock or percussion). [...] In 1970, this was the only US area where deer could legally be hunted with crossbows. [...] The park remains unique still for allowing only <b>muzzle-loaded</b> <b>firearms.</b>|$|R

50|$|Some flintlocks were rifled. The {{spiral grooves}} of rifling make rifles more {{accurate}} {{and give a}} longer effective range - but on a <b>muzzle-loading</b> <b>firearm</b> they take more time to load due to the tight-fitting ball, and after repeated shots black powder tended to foul the barrels. Military musketeers couldn't afford {{to take the time}} to clean the rifles barrels in between shots and the rifle's greater accuracy was unnecessary when tactics were based on mass volleys. Most military flintlocks were therefore smoothbore. Rifled flintlocks did see some military use by sharpshooters, skirmishers, and other support units; but most rifled flintlocks were used for hunting.|$|E

50|$|The general {{types of}} handguns are listed below in their order of {{historical}} appearance. Each type {{can be classified}} into many sub-types. Some of these types can also be differently classified using the general distinction between <b>muzzle-loading</b> <b>firearms</b> (loading {{from the front of}} the barrel) and breech-loading firearms (loading from behind the barrel).|$|R
50|$|An ángel arcabucero (arquebusier angel) is {{an angel}} {{depicted}} with an arquebus (an early <b>muzzle-loaded</b> <b>firearm)</b> {{instead of the}} sword traditional for martial angels, dressed in clothing inspired by that of the Andean nobles and aristocrats. The style arose in the Viceroyalty of Peru {{in the second half}} of 17th century and was especially prevalent in the Cuzco School.|$|R
5000|$|The Eibar {{region has}} been a center of weapons {{development}} and manufacture for centuries, with [...] "Spanish Steel" [...] historically being a selling point with its reputation for quality and durability. When firearms came into being, Eibar retained its edge as a weapons manufacturing center. The oldest known ancestor of the Star lineage is José Cruz Echeverria, who made <b>muzzle-loading</b> <b>firearms</b> in the 19th century.|$|R
50|$|The Liscomb {{sanctuary}} {{was established}} in 1928. There have been some revisions of the boundaries since then, most recently in 1983. Total area is 43,244 hectares, of which 12,836 hectares is privately owned. There is some overlap with the Alder Ground wilderness area and the Boggy Lake wilderness area, so 844 hectares are designated both sanctuary and wilderness area. Hunting and trapping were originally prohibited, but since 1996 {{there has been a}} short hunting season each fall, with <b>muzzle-loading</b> <b>firearms</b> only.|$|R
50|$|Double-barreled {{shotguns}} come in {{two basic}} configurations: the side-by-side shotgun (SxS) and the over/under shotgun ("over and under", O/U, etc.), indicating the arrangement of barrels. The original double-barreled guns were nearly all SxS designs, which was a more practical design of <b>muzzle-loading</b> <b>firearms.</b> Early cartridge shotguns also used the SxS action, because they kept the exposed hammers of the earlier muzzle-loading shotguns they evolved from. When hammerless designs started to become common, the O/U design was introduced, and most modern sporting doubles are O/U designs.|$|R
5000|$|Buckskinners' gatherings {{are called}} {{rendezvous}} after the large [...] "Rendezvous" [...] held {{during the years}} when beaver fur hats were the height of fashion, and beaver pelts commanded high prices. At a rendezvous, everybody is expected to dress in styles appropriate to the period, as far as possible, and authenticity in all things is encouraged, consistent with health and modern law. There are competitions in marksmanship with <b>muzzle-loading</b> <b>firearms,</b> bows, tomahawks and knife throwing, demonstrations of period skills, and commerce in goods related to the hobby.|$|R
50|$|Both armies were {{composed}} primarily of infantry, {{many of whom}} were armed with a very long spear called a spiess (pike), others with a pole weapon called a halberd. These would be deployed in very deep infantry combat columns. Smaller bodies of men would skirmish around these columns, firing with crossbows or primitive <b>muzzle-loading</b> <b>firearms</b> called the arquebus. The Imperial army had an artillery train and a small force of armoured knights, although it is not known whether these fought on horseback, or, as was often their custom, on foot amongst the infantry pike columns.|$|R
50|$|A musket is a <b>muzzle-loaded,</b> smoothbore <b>firearm,</b> {{fired from}} the shoulder. Muskets were {{designed}} for use by infantry. A soldier armed with a musket had the designation musketman or musketeer.|$|R

Basilio Santa Cruz de Pumacallao created iconographies of arcabuceros, that is, angels with <b>muzzle-loaded</b> <b>firearms,</b> so characteristic of the Cuzco School and so different from the angels imagined in Europe at the same time.|$|R
50|$|Bullets {{for black}} powder, or <b>muzzle-loading</b> <b>firearms,</b> were classically molded from pure lead. This {{worked well for}} {{low-speed}} bullets, fired at velocities of less than 450 m/s (1475 ft/s). For slightly higher-speed bullets fired in modern firearms, a harder alloy of lead and tin or typesetter's lead (used to mold Linotype) works very well. For even higher-speed bullet use, jacketed coated lead bullets are used. The common element in all of these, lead, is widely used because it is very dense, thereby providing a high amount of mass—and thus, kinetic energy—for a given volume. Lead is also cheap, easy to obtain, easy to work, and melts at a low temperature, which results in comparatively easy fabrication of bullets.|$|R

2500|$|As in all <b>muzzle-loading</b> <b>firearms</b> (prior to the {{introduction}} of the percussion cap), the pan transmits the fire to the main charge of gunpowder inside the breech of the barrel, via a small hole (or [...] "vent") {{in the side of the}} breech, that gives on to the pan. The priming pan of all wheellocks is provided with a sliding cover that has two purposes, the first of which is to contain the priming powder and afford it some protection from the elements (the second is examined below, under 'Operation'). The pan cover may be slid open and closed by hand, but it is also attached to an arm inside the lock plate, which is acted upon by the eccentric on the shaft of the wheel.|$|R

5000|$|Antique {{firearms}} {{are excluded}} from NFA regulation if they are [...] "not {{likely to be used}} as a weapon" [...] They must have been manufactured before 1898 and may not use conventional ammunition: The term [...] "antique firearm" [...] means any firearm not designed or redesigned for using rim fire or conventional center fire ignition with fixed ammunition and manufactured in or before 1898 (including any matchlock, flintlock, percussion cap, or similar type of ignition system or replica thereof, whether actually manufactured before or after the year 1898) and also any firearm using fixed ammunition manufactured in or before 1898, for which ammunition is no longer manufactured in the United States and is not readily available in the ordinary channels of commercial trade. <b>Muzzle-loading</b> <b>firearms</b> with bores larger than [...]50 inch are not NFA firearms (normally, they would be categorized as destructive devices).|$|R
50|$|First {{used as a}} priming {{composition}} in small copper caps beginning in the 1820s, mercury fulminate quickly replaced flints {{as a means to}} ignite black powder charges in <b>muzzle-loading</b> <b>firearms.</b> Later, during the late 19th century and most of the 20th century, mercury fulminate or potassium chlorate became widely used in primers for self-contained rifle and pistol ammunition. Mercury fulminate has the distinct advantage over potassium chlorate of being non-corrosive, but it is known to weaken with time, by decomposing into its constituent elements. The reduced mercury which results forms amalgams with cartridge brass, weakening it, as well. Today, mercury fulminate has been replaced in primers by more efficient chemical substances. These are non-corrosive, less toxic and more stable over time; they include lead azide, lead styphnate and tetrazene derivatives. In addition, none of these compounds require mercury for manufacture, supplies of which can be unreliable in wartime.|$|R
50|$|<b>Muzzle-loading</b> <b>firearms</b> {{are exempt}} from the Act (as they are defined as 'antique firearms' and are not {{considered}} 'Firearms' under either the GCA or the NFA). Thus, though common muzzle-loading hunting rifles are available in calibers over 0.50", they are not regulated as destructive devices. Muzzle-loading cannons are similarly exempt since the law draws no distinction between {{the size of the}} muzzle-loading weapons; thus it is legal for a civilian to build muzzle-loading rifles, pistols, cannon and mortars with no paperwork, however, ammunition for these weapons can still be classified as destructive devices themselves, such as explosive shells. While an 'antique firearm' is not considered a 'firearm' under the NFA, some states (such as Oregon) have laws that specifically prohibit anyone from owning/obtaining an 'antique firearm' that could not otherwise own/obtain an GCA or NFA defined 'firearm' (i.e., felons, recipients of dishonorable discharge from military service, the mentally adjudicated, etc.).|$|R
50|$|An {{example of}} these tactics {{comes from an}} attack on Comanche horse archers {{by a group of}} Texas Rangers, who were saved by their <b>muzzle-loading</b> <b>firearms</b> and by a {{convenient}} terrain feature. Fifty Rangers armed with guns met about 20 Comanche hunters who were hunting buffalo, and attacked them. The Comanches fled, easily keeping clear of the Rangers, for several miles across the open prairie. They led the Rangers into a stronger force of two hundred. The Rangers immediately retreated, only to discover they had committed a classic error in fighting mounted archers: the Comanches pursued in turn, able to shoot what seemed like clouds of arrows. The Rangers found a ravine where they could shoot at the Comanche from cover. The horse archers did not charge, but kept the Rangers under siege until seven of them were dead or dying, whereupon the Rangers retreated but claimed victory.|$|R
50|$|Menéndez's {{preparations}} {{were made}} promptly; {{he placed his}} brother Bartolomé {{in charge of the}} fort at St. Augustine, in case of the return of the French fleet. He then selected a company of five hundred men, three hundred of whom were arquebusiers and the remainderpikemen (soldiers armed with <b>muzzle-loading</b> <b>firearms</b> and with spears) and targeteers (men armed with swords and buckler shields). On September 16 the force assembled at the call of trumpets, drums, fifes, and the ringing of the bells. After hearing mass, it set out, each man carrying on his back his arms, a bottle of wine, and six pounds of biscuit, in which Menéndez himself set the example.

50|$|This {{cartridge}} {{was used}} with <b>muzzle-loading</b> military <b>firearms,</b> probably {{more often than}} for sporting shooting, {{the base of the}} cartridge being ripped or bitten off by the soldier, the powder poured into the barrel, and the paper and bullet rammed down the barrel. In the Civil War era cartridge, the paper was supposed to be discarded, but soldiers often used it as a wad. To ignite the charge an additional step was required where a finer-grained powder called priming powder was poured into the pan of the gun to be ignited by the firing mechanism.|$|R
50|$|Modern mass {{production}} firearms are breech-loading (though mortars are generally <b>muzzle-loaded).</b> Early <b>firearms,</b> {{on the other}} hand, were almost entirely muzzle-loading. The main advantage of breech-loading is a reduction in reloading time—it is much quicker to load the projectile and the charge into the breech of a gun or cannon than to try to force them down a long tube, especially when the tube has spiral ridges from rifling. In field artillery, breech loading allows the crew to reload the gun without exposing themselves to enemy fire or repositioning the piece (as was required for muzzle-loaded guns) and allows turrets and emplacements to be smaller (since breech loaded guns {{do not need to}} be retracted for loading).|$|R
2500|$|There were {{numerous}} technological innovations during the Civil War {{that had a}} great impact on 19th century science. The Civil War was one of the earliest examples of an [...] "industrial war", in which technological might is used to achieve military supremacy in a war. New inventions, such as the train and telegraph, delivered soldiers, supplies and messages at a time when horses were considered to be the fastest way to travel. It was also in this war when countries first used aerial warfare, in the form of reconnaissance balloons, to a significant effect. It saw the first action involving steam-powered ironclad warships in naval warfare history. Repeating firearms such as the Henry rifle, Spencer rifle, Colt revolving rifle, Triplett & Scott carbine and others, first appeared during the Civil War; they were a revolutionary invention that would soon replace <b>muzzle-loading</b> and single-shot <b>firearms</b> in warfare, as well as the first appearances of rapid-firing weapons and machine guns such as the Agar gun and the Gatling gun.|$|R
5000|$|The {{provisions}} of the Firearms Acts 1968 to 1997 {{do not apply to}} any antique firearm held as a curiosity or ornament. The word 'antique' is not defined in the Act, but it is suggested that the categories below should be used as a guide in deciding whether a particular firearm might be considered an 'antique' for these purposes.Part I: Old weapons which should benefit from exemption as antiques under section 58 (2) of the Firearms Act 1968a) All <b>muzzle-loading</b> firearms;b) Breech-loading <b>firearms</b> capable of discharging a rim-fire cartridge other than 4mm, 5mm, [...]22" [...] or [...]23" [...] (or their metric equivalents), 6mm or 9mm rimfire;c) Breech-loading firearms using ignition systems other than rimfire and centrefire (These include pin-fire and needle-fire ignition systems, as well as the more obscure lip fire, cup-primed, teat fire and base fire systems);d) Breech-loading centre-fire arms originally chambered for one of the obsolete cartridges listed in Annex B and which retain their original chambering;e) Vintage (pre 1939) rifles, shotguns and punt guns chambered for the following cartridges expressed in imperial measurements: 32 bore, 24 bore, 14 bore, 10 bore (⅝" [...] and 2⅞" [...] only), 8 bore, 4 bore, 3 bore, 2 bore, 1⅛ bore, 1¼ bore and 1½ bore, and vintage punt guns and shotguns with bores of 10 or greater.Note (i) - The exemption does not apply to ammunition, and the possession of live ammunition suitable for use with an otherwise antique firearm will normally indicate that the firearm is not possessed as a curio or ornament.Note (ii) - The exemption does not apply to firearms of modern manufacture which otherwise conform to the description above. Fully working modern firing replicas of <b>muzzle-loading</b> and breech-loading <b>firearms,</b> for example those used to fire blanks by historical re-enactment societies but capable of firing live ammunition, must be held on certificate.
