40|$|SUMMARY: Tension-tension {{fatigue tests}} were {{performed}} for unidirectional T 800 H/Epoxy {{at room temperature}} (RT) and 100 °C, respectively, using seven kinds of plain coupon specimens with different fiber orientation angles. The characteristic nature of the fiber-matrix interface controlled off-axis fatigue failure was similar at RT and 100 °C. Irrespective of off-axis angle, almost linear S-N relationships were obtained in {{the whole range of}} fatigue testing up to 106 cycles. Normalizing the <b>maximum</b> <b>fatigue</b> <b>stress</b> with respect to the static tensile strength at test temperature, the off-axis fatigue data eventually fell on a single S-N relationship. A non-dimensional effective stress defined {{on the basis of the}} classical static failure theory succeeded in coping with the directional nature of the off-axis fatigue behavior in a unified manner. By using the non-dimensional effective stress in the continuum damage mechanics approach, a general failure model was developed to describe the observed off-axis S-N relationships...|$|E

The most severe operational case involves a continuous U beam impacting the beam dump with a power of 295 kW and a nominal spot diameter size of 5 cm.

The barrels are 70 cm in diameter and axially long enough to intercept {{a variety of other}} beams. The aluminum wall absorbs approximately 15 % of the U beam power with the rest absorbed in the water downstream of the wall.

40|$|International audienceThis {{research}} {{focuses on}} high cycle fretting fatigue crack nucleation prediction. A plastic steel/steel cylinder/plane contact was investigated keeping constant the normal force and the <b>maximum</b> <b>fatigue</b> <b>stress</b> ratio but varying the fatigue stress ratio (RF= 0. 6 to 1). The evolution of the crack length as function of the applied fretting tangential force amplitude at 10 ^ 6 cycles allows us to formalize the crack nucleation condition. It shows that the threshold tangential force marking the crack nucleation (i. e. bp_th= 0 μm) is not affected by the fatigue stress ratio. However an increase of the fatigue stress amplitude sharply increases the crack extension. To model the experiments, a 2 D plastic plain strain FEM modeling is performed. As expected the computed stress field description is mesh dependent. However we demonstrate that a representative stress description is obtained at the 3 rd node (i. e. 2 nd node below the surface). By coupling this mesh condition and non-local critical distance approach, reliable prediction of the crack nucleation risk can be achieved either considering a Crossland multi-axial fatigue analysis or using a basic uni-axial Haighs description...|$|E
40|$|Environmentally-assisted {{cracking}} (EAC) of low-alloy steels in high-temperature aqueous environments {{typical of}} those employed in light-water reactor (LWR) systems {{has been a}} subject of considerable interest since the pioneering work of Kondo et al demonstrated significantly higher fatigue crack propagation (FCP) rates in water than would be expected in an air environment under similar conditions. Here, environmentally-assisted cracking (EAC) of low-alloy steels in elevated temperature aqueous environments is readily observed in many laboratory experiments conducted in autoclaves, yet the observation of EAC in actual components operating in the same environments is quite rare. Mass transport of sulfides from the crack enclave by diffusion and convection occurring in operating components provides one plausible explanation to this apparent paradox. Another contribution to EAC mitigation may also arise from the non-constant stress amplitudes typical for many operating components. This paper provides a demonstration of how a single tensile overload to 40 % above a steady-state <b>maximum</b> <b>fatigue</b> <b>stress</b> can retard subsequent crack growth at the steady-state level for a sufficient {{period of time that}} diffusion mass transport can reduce the crack-tip sulfide concentration to a level below that necessary to sustain EAC...|$|E
40|$|A wide ranging {{study of}} the effects of low {{velocity}} impact on the performance of a quasi-isotropic, woven CFRP laminate has been conducted. The study considered the response of the laminate to constant velocity impact up to an incident energy of approximately 9 J. The resulting damage, a complex network of delaminations, matrix cracking and fibre failure, was related to the incident energy and also to the residual static tensile and compressive strength of the material. The growth of matrix cracking and delamination and also the reductions in tensile stiffness, measured locally over the impact damage site, were followed under constant amplitude zero-tension fatigue on specimens impacted at approximately 3 J and 7 J, representative of two characteristic damage states. The growth of matrix micro-cracking was found to be very rapid with numbers of cycles and was related to increases in tensile strength of plain, notched and impacted specimens, but substantial decreases in tensile stiffness. This type of fatigue related damage was observed to act as a 'pseudo-plastic' zone providing stress relieving around stress concentrations. No growth of this type of damage was noted in impacted specimens when the ratio of <b>maximum</b> <b>fatigue</b> <b>stress</b> to residual static strength was reduced to approximately 20...|$|E

In this thesis, the <b>maximum</b> <b>fatigue</b> damage and <b>stress</b> components of the tensile amour layer are studied.

40|$|The {{present study}} {{considers}} {{the dependence of}} mechanical properties in composite laminates on the fibre architecture. The objective is to characterise the mechanical properties of composite plates while varying the fibre distribution but keeping the constituent materials unchanged. Image analysis and fractal dimension {{have been used to}} quantify fibre distribution and resin-rich volumes (RRV) and to correlate these with the mechanical properties of the fibre-reinforced composites. The formation, shape and size of RRV in composites with different fabric architectures is discussed. The majority of studies in literatures show a negative effect of the RRV on the mechanical behaviour of composite materials. RRV arise primarily as a result of (a) the clustering of fibres as bundles in textiles, (b) the stacking sequence, and/ or stacking process, (c) the resin properties and flow characteristics, (d) the heating rate as this directly affects viscosity and (e) the consolidation pressure. Woven glass and carbon/epoxy fabric composites were manufactured either by the infusion or the resin transfer moulding (RTM) process. The fractal dimension (D) has been employed to explore the correlation between fabric architecture and mechanical properties (in glass or/ carbon fibre reinforced composites with different weave styles and fibre volume fraction). The fractal dimension was determined using optical microscopy images and ImageJ with FracLac software, and the D has been correlated with the flexural modulus, ultimate flexural strength (UFS), interlaminar shear strength (ILSS) and the fatigue properties of the woven carbon/epoxy fabric composites. The present study also considers the dependence of fatigue properties in composite laminates on static properties and fibre architecture. Four-point flexural fatigue test was conducted under load control, at sinusoidal frequency of 10 Hz with amplitude control. Using a stress ratio (R=σmin/σmax) of 0. 1 for the tension side and 10 for the compression side, specimens were subjected to <b>maximum</b> <b>fatigue</b> <b>stresses</b> of 95 % to 82. 5 % step 2. 5 % of the ultimate flexural strength (UFS). The fatigue data were correlated with the static properties and the fibre distribution, in order to obtain a useful general description of the laminate behaviour under flexural fatigue load. The analysis of variance (ANOVA) technique was applied to the results obtained to identify statistically the significance of the correlations. Composite strength and ILSS show a clear dependence on the fibre distribution quantified using D. For the carbon fabric architectures considered in this study, the fatigue properties of composite laminates have significant correlations with the fibre distribution and the static properties of the laminates. The loss of 5 - 6 % in the flexural modulus of composite laminates indicates an increasing risk of failure of the composite laminates under fatigue loads. The endurance limits, based on either the static properties or the fibre distribution, were inversely proportional to the strength for all laminates.

40|$|International audienceThe fretting-fatigue {{crack arrest}} {{condition}} is formalized as the condition {{for which a}} crack nucleates but stops propagating and so the sample never fails. Usually this domain is small as the fatigue loading greatly promotes the crack propagation. The aim of this research work is to investigate the crack arrest condition for severe plastic condition (maximal pressure is 2. 5 {{times greater than the}} yield stress) and high fatigue stress ratio (R= 0. 94) thus for not much propagating conditions. A low alloyed industrial steel flat specimen (IS) fretted against a 35 NCD 16 steel cylinder pad was studied in order to identify the crack arrest condition for various fretting loadings (shear amplitude). An original experimental monitoring has been implemented on a fretting-fatigue test device to observe online the crack arrest using the potential drop technic. To rationalize these results, a fretting-fatigue map concept which consists to plot the crack arrest boundary {{as a function of the}} applied <b>maximum</b> <b>fatigue</b> <b>stress</b> and the fretting tangential force amplitude is applied. A 2 D plain strain FEM modelling has been implemented to simulate the complex contact stressing including the contact plasticity. This plastic deformation promotes a significant extension of the contact and a proportional reduction of contact pressure and cyclic shear stresses. One consequence is that for a given contact and fatigue loading, this plastic accommodation of the interface tends to reduce the effective stress imposed to the material. The crack arrest boundary was formalized applying a pure mode I effective intensity stress range approximation. It is shown that combining elastic-plastic FEM modelling, weight function and an adequate estimation of the effective intensity stress range, it is possible to predictwith accuracy the fretting fatigue crack arrest boundary...|$|E

40|$|The stable tearing {{behavior}} of thin sheets 2024 -T 3 aluminum alloy was studied for middle crack tension specimens having initial cracks that were: flat cracks (low <b>fatigue</b> <b>stress)</b> and 45 degrees through-thickness slant cracks (high <b>fatigue</b> <b>stress).</b> The critical crack-tip-opening angle (CTOA) values during stable tearing were measured by two independent methods, optical microscopy and digital image correlation. Results {{from the two}} methods agreed well. The CTOA measurements and observations of the fracture surfaces showed that the initial stable tearing {{behavior of}} low and high <b>fatigue</b> <b>stress</b> tests is significantly different. The cracks in the low <b>fatigue</b> <b>stress</b> tests underwent a transition from flat-to-slant crack growth, during which the CTOA values were high and significant crack tunneling occurred. After crack growth equal to about the thickness, CTOA reached a constant value of 6 deg and after crack growth equal to about twice the thickness, crack tunneling stabilized. The initial high CTOA values, in the low fatigue crack tests, coincided with large three-dimensional crack front shape changes due to {{a variation in the}} through-thickness crack tip constraint. The cracks in the high <b>fatigue</b> <b>stress</b> tests reach the same constant CTOA value after crack growth equal to about the thickness, but produced only a slightly higher CTOA value during initial crack growth.

Seventeen junior soccer players took part in this study. The individual Hooper's indices takenbefore each training session were correlated with RPE- 10 min during a constant intensity and duration effort (10 min) using Pearson product moment correlation. Intraclass correlation (ICC) was used to assess the internal consistency of the RPE- 10 min. All individual correlations between RPE- 10 min and quality of sleep and quantity of <b>fatigue,</b> <b>stress,</b> and DOMS were non-significant (p N 0. 05). No significant correlations wereresulted between RPE- 10 min and Hooper's Index in all athletes. The ICC of RPE- 10 min was 0. 77 thus demonstrating internal consistency. The results of the present study demonstrated the objectivity and utility of RPE as a psychological tool for monitoring training during traditional soccer training.
