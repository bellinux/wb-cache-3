50|$|A private railway was completed, by the Chillagoe Railway and Mining Company, between Mareeba and Mungana in 1901. The {{system was}} {{extended}} from Lappa Junction to Mount Garnet in 1902. A line was then constructed from Almaden to Mount Surprise in 1908 reaching Einasleigh in 1909 and finally Forsayth in 1911. A branch to Mount Mulligan {{was constructed in}} 1915. The <b>rail</b> <b>assets</b> of the Chillagoe Company were {{handed over to the}} Queensland Government in 1919.|$|R
40|$|In many {{construction}} projects, prefabrication {{has proven}} to benefit sustainability. This innovative construction practice can virtually {{extend the life of}} assets while minimizing costs and time and enhancing quality and safety. In rail construction, prefabrication has long been utilized for certain elements of the <b>rail</b> <b>assets</b> but not all. The paper reports on the initiation of a research to investigate the contribution and potential of prefabrication to increasing sustainability and the whole lifecycle benefits in the rail construction industry in Australia. Paper embraces a broad definition of the term "sustainability" which includes energy and water efficiency, health and safety, durability and quality, pollution and waste reduction, overall cost and time efficiency, and sustainable society/community. The research adopts a qualitative case study approach that employs Soft Systems Methodology (SSM) for examining the research enquiry. A variety of stakeholders will be interviewed in each project case besides reviewing the archived content. Stakeholders including construction contractors, rail operators and maintainers, end-users, government bodies, and those involved with the project&# 039;s supply chain will benefit from having a more transparent and clear understanding of the effect of prefabrication on the sustainability of <b>rail</b> <b>assets...</b>|$|R
50|$|Cleveland-Cliffs had {{operated}} two {{iron ore}} mines located in Eastern Canada. On February 11, 2014 {{it was announced}} that one of the mines, in Wabush, Labrador, would lay off 500 workers due to falling global demand. Subsequently, both mines were idled and closed in 2014 and early 2015 due to unsustainable high cost structures, representing a complete curtailment of the company’s Eastern Canadian iron ore operations. In December 2015, Champion Iron Ltd announced its intention to purchase Bloom Lake's Mine and <b>rail</b> <b>assets.</b>|$|R
50|$|In 2006 the Government of New South Wales {{endorsed}} the Sustainable <b>Rail</b> Heritage <b>Asset</b> Management Strategy {{to ensure the}} collection of the State’s <b>rail</b> heritage <b>assets</b> are maintained and conserved by dedicated volunteers and shared with the public for current and future generations to appreciate and enjoy. In 2007 RailCorp’s Office of Rail Heritage commissioned the development of a concept design for the NSWRTM’s upgrade. This saw ownership in the NSWRTM vested in Trainworks Limited, a 100% subsidiary of RailCorp.|$|R
40|$|Rail and wheel wear {{costs the}} rail {{industry}} a significant amount. Different types of preventive maintenance are followed {{out of which}} lubrication is widely used. Among three types of lubrication (wayside, on board and high rail) wayside lubrication method is commonly used. The influential factors behind effective lubrication are lubricants, applicators, location and placement including positioning of applicator. This paper identifies influential factors behind wear rate of rail and wheel wear and develops an economic model for lubrication effectiveness combining below rail and above <b>rail</b> <b>assets...</b>|$|R

50|$|Réseau ferré de France (RFF, French Rail Network) was a French {{company which}} owned and {{maintained}} the French national railway network from 1997-2014. The company was formed with the <b>rail</b> <b>assets</b> of SNCF in 1997. Afterwards, the trains were operated by SNCF, the national railway company, {{but due to}} European Union Directive 91/440, the French government was required to separate train operations from the railway infrastructure. On 1 January 2015, RFF became SNCF Réseau, the operational assets of SNCF became SNCF Mobilités, and both groups were placed {{under the control of}} SNCF.|$|R
50|$|In June 2009 the Queensland Government {{announced}} the privatisation of Queensland Rail's freight business. This resulted in Queensland <b>Rail's</b> freight <b>assets</b> being transferred to QR National (now Aurizon) from 1 July 2010.|$|R
5|$|However, in August 2016, LTA {{has placed}} this {{refurbishment}} programme on hold after acquisition of SMRT <b>rail</b> <b>assets</b> in August 2016 {{due to the}} concerns and issues with older trains. LTA has evaluated on the decision to replace older trains with newer ones, despite the frames of the older trains being sturdy for decades. SMRT {{would be expected to}} suffer some losses if the decisions of replacement is confirmed as the parts for refurbishment had already been purchased. In October 2016, LTA announced that it will be calling for a tender of new trains to replace all C151 trainsets.|$|R
50|$|In November 2001 DEVCO ceased {{coal mining}} and the {{following}} month sold the Devco Railway's assets to a subsidiary of Emera, the holding company for Nova Scotia Power; Emera has contracted operation of the <b>rail</b> <b>assets</b> to the Sydney Coal Railway (SCR) which operates trains from the International Piers to the Lingan Generating Station. The former main line east of Victoria Junction to Glace Bay has been abandoned since the early 2000s, thus Victoria Junction {{is no longer a}} true railway junction and is instead the midpoint of the SCR's line between Sydney Harbour and Lingan.|$|R
50|$|With {{the high}} amounts of mineral {{deposits}} {{found in the}} south along the corridor the Government of Tanzania deemed {{the construction of a}} railway to be economically feasible. The railway line is to span 860 km from Mtwara port to Mbamba bay through Mchuchuma region. The railway line is to cost TZS 2.4 trillion shillings and was recently awarded to a Chinese contractor via the state owned <b>Rail</b> <b>Asset</b> Holding Company Ltd (RAHCO). The railway line will complement all the coal and iron mining operations in Mchuchuma and Liganga and make Tanzanian coal and iron exports more attractive internationally.|$|R

40|$|A multivariate {{statistical}} model {{was developed to}} improve the ability to predict the occurrence of broken rails, (aka "service failures"). Broken rails are {{the leading cause of}} major accidents on US railroads and service failures are a frequent cause of delays. The model uses a combination of engineering and traffic data commonly recorded by major railroads. The Service Failure Prediction Model (SFPM) enables railroads to identify the conditions that are predictive of the occurrence of broken rails. This can help them allocate inspection, detection and preventive resources more efficiently, thereby enhancing safety, reducing risk and service interruptions, and potentially extracting more use from their <b>rail</b> <b>assets...</b>|$|R
50|$|The MBTA {{bought the}} B&M {{commuter}} <b>rail</b> <b>assets,</b> including the Wildcat Branch, on December 27, 1976. The Reading line was re-extended to Haverhill as the Haverhill/Reading Line on December 17, 1979. Most trains {{on the line}} use the Western Route via Reading; however, the line south of Reading is single-tracked in many locations due to the 1970s construction of the Haymarket North Extension of the MBTA Orange Line subway and has numerous grade crossings, so some express trips run via the Wildcat and the lower Lowell Line. Amtrak Downeaster service to Maine began on December 14, 2001; all Downeaster service uses the Wildcat except during service disruptions such as construction.|$|R
