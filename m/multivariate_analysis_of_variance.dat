The present study was conducted to investigate the effect of doing problem-solving task on learners’ WTC in English. To fulfill the purpose of the study, 61 pre-intermediate learners were chosen by means of administrating a placement test. Learners were pretested through three scales of WTC and its two antecedents: self-perceived communication competence (SPCC) and communication apprehension (CA). Of course, the experimental group was provided with fifteen problem-solving tasks during the course, while the control group was not. After fifteen sessions of the treatment, two groups were posttested through the same three scales. The results demonstrated that the experimental group outperformed the control group in terms of their WTC’s level. Moreover, the learners’ WTC was found to be directly related to their SPCC and indirectly related to CA. So based on the MacIntyre’s path model (1994), these both antecedents can be the best predictors <b>of</b> WTC.

We attempted to determine whether exposure to multiple pesticides shortens relative telomere length (RTL) and causes nucleoplasmic bridge (NPB) formation via the mechanism of telomere-end fusion in the lymphocytes of agricultural workers. For measuring RTL, we used quantitative fluorescent in situ hybridization, while NPB frequency was measured as part of the cytome assay. <b>Multivariate</b> <b>analysis</b> <b>of</b> <b>variances</b> taking into account confounding factors (age, gender, years of exposure, smoking, and alcohol intake) did not show a decrease, but rather an increase of RTL in agricultural workers compared to control individuals.

Using Spearman correlation, we did not find proof for our initial hypothesis.

Measurements of shrinkage were performed up to 98 days after demolding on the beams (10 × 10 × 50 cm), in accordance with the procedure from polish standard PN- 84 /B- 06714 / 23 (Amsler’s method).

We explore how the labour market position of these groups changed between 1993 and 2008. We used data from 1993 and 2008, collected in the population survey Work, Family and Leisure, designed by the Institute of International and Social Studies at Tallinn University.

On this background we aimed to study the additional effect of a leadership course following a multi-source feedback procedure compared to multi-source feedback alone especially regarding development of leadership skills over time. Methods Study participants were consultants responsible for postgraduate medical education at clinical departments. Study design: pre-post measures with an intervention and control group. The intervention was participation in a seven-day leadership course. Scores of multi-source feedback from the consultants responsible for education and respondents (heads of department, consultants and doctors in specialist training) were collected before and {{one year after the}} intervention and analysed using Mann-Whitney's U-test and <b>Multivariate</b> <b>analysis</b> <b>of</b> <b>variances.</b> Results There were no differences in multi-source feedback scores at one year follow up compared to baseline measurements, either in the intervention or in the control group (p = 0. 149).

Developing leadership skills takes time and the time frame of one year might have been too short to show improvement in leadership skills of consultants responsible for education.

However, while ANOVA bases the significance of the result on assumption of normality, PERMANOVA draws tests for significance by comparing the actual F test result to that gained from random permutations of the objects between the groups.

5000|$|Shape {{analysis}} {{begins by}} removing the information that is not about shape. By definition, shape is not altered by translation, scaling or rotation. [...] Thus, to compare shapes, the non-shape information {{is removed from the}} coordinates of landmarks. There is {{more than one way to}} do these three operations. One method is to fix the coordinates of two points to (0,0) and (0,1), which are the two ends of a baseline. In one step, the shapes are translated to the same position (the same two coordinates are fixed to those values), the shapes are scaled (to unit baseline length) and the shapes are rotated. [...] An alternative, and preferred method, is Procrustes superimposition. This method translates the centroid of the shapes to (0,0); the x coordinate of the centroid is the average of the x coordinates of the landmarks, and the y coordinate of the centroid is the average of the y-coordinates. Shapes are scaled to unit centroid size, which is the square root of the summed squared distances of each landmark to the centroid. The configuration is rotated to minimize the deviation between it and a reference, typically the mean shape. In the case of semi-landmarks, variation in position along the curve is also removed. Because shape space is curved, analyses are done by projecting shapes onto a space tangent to shape space. Within the tangent space, conventional multivariate statistical methods such as <b>multivariate</b> <b>analysis</b> <b>of</b> <b>variance</b> and multivariate regression, can be used to test statistical hypotheses about shape.|$|E

The Partial Ata Squared (PTA) was 87. 4 %, which means the learning strategy was able to improve learning achievement as much as 87. 4 %.
