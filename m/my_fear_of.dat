25|$|I {{was saved}} {{from the gas}} chambers, saved from Hitler. I spent several years in Nazi death camps. Besides {{the fact that they}} murdered my wife and 11 children, my mother, my sisters and my brother – of my whole family, some 150 people, I {{was the only one who}} survived – I {{witnessed}} their cruelty. I remember as if it were today how they shot me in the arm. I was afraid to go to the Nazi infirmary, though there were doctors there. I knew that if I went in, I'd never come out alive. … Despite <b>my</b> <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> the Nazis, I plucked a leaf from a tree and stuck it to my wound to stanch the bleeding. Then I cut a branch and tied it around the wound to hold it in place. With God's help, it healed in three days. Then I promised myself that if, with God's help, I got well and got out of there, away from those resha'im (wicked people), I would build a hospital in Eretz Yisrael where every human being would be cared for with dignity. And the basis of that hospital would be that the doctors and nurses would believe that there is a God in this world and that when they treat a patient, they are fulfilling the greatest mitzvah in the Torah.|$|E
500|$|Larter took on {{the title}} role in Marigold (2007), {{alongside}} Salman Khan. The film was released in August 2007 and revolved around an American actress (Larter) who goes to India and gets {{caught up in the}} exotic world of Bollywood. Filming took place in North India and London, commencing in June 2004. In an interview with the BBC, Larter remarked this role was [...] "an opportunity to overcome <b>my</b> <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> singing and dancing because I have no professional training [...] I really focused on the character and loved this journey she went on and the experiences she had." [...] She was paid a seven-figure salary for her part in the film.|$|E
500|$|Lady Gaga {{collaborated with}} RedOne and Space Cowboy {{in writing and}} {{producing}} [...] "So Happy I Could Die". All {{three of them were}} the main instrumentalists behind the song and recorded it at Record Plant Studios in Los Angeles. Other personnel who worked on the song includes Johny Severin for vocal editing and audio engineering, Dave Russell for audio engineering and Mike Orton for mixing the song at Sarm West Studios. An occasional drinker, the song represents Gaga's fear of what she describes as the [...] "Alcohol Monster", as evident of several lyrics in the song, such as the chorus; [...] "Happy in the club with a bottle of red wine, stars in our eyes and we're having a good time." [...] In an interview with MTV, Gaga professed that the song is about the euphoric effects of alcohol—the so-called [...] "happy place"—and explained that her fear is split between two songs. [...] "My fear of alcohol. <b>My</b> <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> drugs... fear of addiction. [...] But alcohol is funny because it takes you down to this very happy place and just like forgetting all your problems and for just a minute you're so happy, {{and then all of a}} sudden, [...] stomach turns and go way down... And that's my relationship with consumption and abuse." [...] Other meaning behind the song was given by a writer for Elle magazine, which described it as [...] "about masturbating while thinking about a woman". The singer also acknowledged on her Twitter account that while writing the song she was inspired by English singer Lily Allen.|$|E

2500|$|The narrator {{switches}} {{from the}} past to the present {{for the remainder of}} the song, describing the yearning that drives him to return to El Paso: [...] "It's been so long since I've seen the young maiden / My love is stronger than <b>my</b> <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> death." [...] Upon entering the town, he is attacked and fatally wounded by a posse. At the end of the song, the cowboy recounts that Feleena has [...] "found me,"and he dies in her arms.|$|E
2500|$|Frontman James Veck-Gilodi {{has spoken}} {{at length about}} the themes of each song on the album, {{describing}} them as 'very personal and each is a small story that depicts {{a part of my}} life'. Much of the album is about nostalgia, underachievement and anxiety, which are all topics which are personal to him as he wrote all the lyrics for the album. The opening track [...] "The Past Six Years", from whose lyrics the album takes its title, is described as 'an ode to... not really achieving as much as we'd have liked'. The lyrics make reference to friends and fellow bands Lower Than Atlantis and Young Guns and how James feels 'a perpetual bitterness and jealousy towards them in terms of their achievements, {{despite the fact that they}} are close friends'. [...] "I'm a Bore, Mostly" [...] also deals with the topic of underachievement, with James explaining that the song is about 'the mundane daily routine I had when I was living in London. ...I couldn't deal with city life, I rarely left the house and found myself sinking into this terrible routine. I didn't really appreciate anything at the time and I had no enthusiasm'. He has claimed he wrote the song [...] "Filthy Rotten Scoundrel" [...] about himself; 'I need to learn to be grateful and appreciate the opportunities that I have been given. It's also about <b>my</b> <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> living, dying and never really achieving anything'. [...] "The World or Nothing" [...] continues this trend, with James describing the theme as 'the vicious cycle of feeling lost and resorting to the aid of alcohol while also feeling lost because of alcohol. It talks about how self-destructive a lot of us are and how we enjoy abusing our bodies'. Of [...] "Nelson's County", Veck-Gilodi has said: 'This song is about the county of Norfolk and how a lot of the people who reside there seem to have no real ambition other than working a 9-5, raising a family and living a normal life'.|$|E

60|$|Object. But if {{this be the}} {{character}} of a righteous man, to desire to depart and to be with Christ, I am none of them, for I never had such a desire in my heart; no, <b>my</b> <b>fears</b> <b>of</b> perishing will not suffer me either to desire to die to be with Christ, nor that Christ should come to judge the world.|$|R

25|$|The doctor {{warned me}} – {{and so did}} members of my family soon {{afterward}} – that if I did not keep my epilepsy a secret, people would fear me and I {{would be subject to}} discrimination. Even now, seven years after that scene in the dining hall, it is difficult for me to say that I have epilepsy. Back then, it was impossible. In the years since, I have had hundreds of various types of seizures. I have experienced the mental, physical and emotional side effects caused by changes in the anticonvulsant drugs I take each day. Yet, for the first two years, I refused to learn about epilepsy. <b>My</b> <b>fears</b> <b>of</b> being found out were my real concern.|$|R
6000|$|She {{spoke to}} the man, but she looked towards me, and evidently {{expected}} me to address her. For a moment I could not.

It was quite evident that nothing unexpected had happened during the last twenty-four hours. Father Adrian's threat had been an empty one. In the presence of Lady de Vaux, the fears which had been consuming me departed. She was so unmoved, so indifferent. How could a little Jesuit priest hurt such a one as she? ...|$|R

60|$|Sometimes {{the wonders}} of my present {{circumstances}} would work upon me, and I should have some raptures upon my soul, upon the subject of my coming so smoothly out of the arms of hell, that I was not ingulfed in ruin, as most who lead such lives are, first or last; {{but this was a}} flight too high for me; I was not come to that repentance that is raised from a sense of Heaven's goodness; I repented of the crime, but it was of another and lower kind of repentance, and rather moved by <b>my</b> <b>fears</b> <b>of</b> vengeance, than from a sense of being spared from being punished, and landed safe after a storm.|$|R

6000|$|All {{that night}} and all {{the next day and}} far into the second night I rode, <b>my</b> <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> missing {{connection}} at Topeka uniting with my rheumatism to make the hours seem of interminable length.

60|$|Nor was the {{contemplation of}} heaven itself {{particularly}} attractive to me, for it was a foolish paradise these foolish voices had fashioned out of their folly.

On the evening of the second day I was in the hotel's smoking room, an irrationally private apartment, a sanctuary for a few choice minds of the town, always pervaded by a dim religious light, and more hushed than any club reading-room I have ever been in. Gathered into a small knot, we were discussing the situation in subdued tones suitable to the genius of the place.|$|R
