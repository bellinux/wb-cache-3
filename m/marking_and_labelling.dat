40|$|This paper investigates whether TBT {{provisions}} {{included in}} RTAs {{differ from those}} under the WTO TBT Agreement, and, if they do, whether they entail broader commitments. Our analysis covers 238 RTAs, of which 171 include at least one provision, and focuses on the provisions on technical regulations, conformity assessment procedures, transparency, dispute settlement, <b>marking</b> <b>and</b> <b>labelling</b> and sector-specific commitments. We find that all RTAs signed since 2010 systematically include TBT provisions and that the most frequent provisions are those referring to the TBT Agreement and transparency. Moreover, {{even if there are}} RTAs that include new or broader commitments than the TBT Agreement, our study shows that their number remains very limited. For instance, relatively few RTAs have included provisions to better implement WTO provisions in the area of transparency or provisions requiring the equivalence or harmonization of technical regulations among the parties or even the recognition of conformity assessment results. RTAs with a dispute settlement provision that applies exclusively to TBT issues are also very few. These RTAs give in general exclusive jurisdiction to the WTO DSM over TBT related disputes. Finally, also only a minority of RTAs include provisions on new issues such as <b>marking</b> <b>and</b> <b>labelling</b> or sector-specific provisions, typically for electric and electronic products, pharmaceuticals or vehicles...|$|E
40|$|A new Canadian {{standard}} (CAN/CSA/Z 264. 1 - 02 : 2002) {{has been}} published {{with the purpose of}} helping to ensure the safety, efficacy and functionality of spacers and/or holding chambers. They are prescribed for use by spontaneously breathing patients for the treatment of various respiratory diseases where medication is delivered to the lungs using pressurized-metered dose inhalers. This consensus standard was developed with the support of pharmaceutical companies and manufacturers of spacers and holding chambers, {{and with the help of}} clinicians, retail pharmacists and representatives of patient advocate bodies associated with respiratory diseases and the dissemination of information related to the treatment and the delivery of inhaled medications. Advice was also sought from expert groups outside of Canada to ensure that the standard would be relevant internationally. Whereas monographs in the pharmaceutical compendia and guidance documents published by regulatory bodies provide information that is largely about the drug product and inhaler, this is the only standard whose focus is primarily on these add-on devices. The purpose of the present review is to highlight the main features of the standard for clinicians by describing its scope, the tests that are intended to assure the robustness of the construction of these devices, the type of testing that is specified to establish in vitro efficacy, and the recommendations for the <b>marking</b> <b>and</b> <b>labelling</b> of the device and its associated packaging. Manufacturers who test their products to this Canadian Standards Association standard will be able to provide performance information about add-on devices to the clinician, facilitating an informed decision when selecting devices for patients...|$|E

30|$|On {{this night}} of {{spectacular}} activity (21 March 1979), there appeared {{what could be}} called two giant oscillations in the ATI plot, with crests occurring around 1945 and 2125 LT. These temporally measured features turn out to be consistent with the upwelling paradigm, if we envision these structures to be slowly developing as they drift eastward. In this case, the oscillations are interpreted as two upwellings, as <b>marked</b> (<b>and</b> <b>labeled)</b> by the large upward-pointing arrows. There are backscatter ‘plumes’ associated with the crests, and those with the ‘descending’ side of each oscillation; the descending side would be the west wall of an upwelling. The plumes {{have been shown to be}} spatially collocated with upward-extending EPBs (Tsunoda, 1980, 1981).|$|R
