5000|$|KSNY (1450 AM, [...] "The Zone") is {{the first}} radio station to air in Snyder, Texas. Before the advent of FM as a {{mainstream}} medium, KSNY adopted a block format, meaning different formats {{at different times of}} the day. In the 1970s, KSNY started the day with News and Talk, then in the mornings played Country Music; in the afternoons Adult Contemporary and at night Top 40 formats. A Latin format with a Spanish-speaking announcer aired on Sunday evenings until 1980 and then moved to weeknights from 6 - 7 p.m. The station also played Easy Listening and Gospel formats on Sunday mornings. KSNY was an affiliate of the Texas State Network, and most of its newscasts <b>mirrored</b> <b>television</b> airings (i.e. Noon, Six and Ten).|$|R
50|$|Plans to hive off Sportswire into a {{separate}} channel came to nothing. In 1995, Wire TV was sold to <b>Mirror</b> <b>Television,</b> a Mirror Group plc subsidiary, and closed {{in order to make}} way for L!VE TV.|$|E
5000|$|L!VE TV was {{proposed}} by David Montgomery as MGN's foray into pay television. <b>Mirror</b> <b>Television,</b> a Mirror Group plc subsidiary, bought Wire TV [...] which included sports content shown {{at certain times}} during Wire's output. Sports programming on Wire had been expanded when several sporting rights were acquired, such as Vauxhall Conference football, the live broadcast rights to screen Lennox Lewis's WBC title fights and the 1996 Cricket World Cup {{as well as other}} sporting coverage following a deal with Chrysalis Sport. Mirror Group planned to turn Sportswire into a separate channel to operate alongside the proposed L!VE TV, which would replace Wire. Wire was closed at the end of May 1995 but the proposed Sportswire channel came to nothing, leaving <b>Mirror</b> <b>Television</b> with just L!VE TV.|$|E

50|$|In {{the domain}} of {{mechanical}} television, Léon Theremin demonstrated the concept of interlacing.

5000|$|Other {{television}} shows {{that have been}} called [...] "artistic television", include The Simpsons, for its use of a [...] "...flurry of cultural references, intentionally inconsistent characterization, and considerable self-reflexivity about television conventions {{and the status of}} the programme as a television show". Charlie Brooker's UK-focused Black <b>Mirror</b> <b>television</b> series explored the dark and sometimes satirical themes in modern society, particularly with regard to the unanticipated consequences of new technologies, and while classed as [...] "speculative fiction" [...] rather than art television received rave reviews. HBO's The Wire might also be qualified as [...] "artistic television" [...] as it has garnered a larger amount of critical attention from academics than most {{television shows}}. For example, the film theory journal Film Quarterly has featured the show on its cover.|$|E

500|$|For {{the first}} series, {{interior}} sets were {{built at the}} Blue Shed Studios in Salford. Three directors and three film crews were used to film the six 50-minute episodes over 14 weeks from March to May 1998. Locations included an empty shop unit near Piccadilly station for the charity shop sex scene in Episode 3 and a Masonic Lodge for the gala dinner scenes in Episode 6. In the second year, the sets were moved to the Spectrum Arena in Warrington, where filming ran from March to June. The series featured the first location shoots outside Manchester; a short scene in Episode 2 featuring Bathurst was filmed over half a day in Blackpool; Bathurst, Norris and a small production crew filmed scenes in Paris for Episode 3; exterior location scenes of the characters on holiday in Episode 6 were filmed on Lindisfarne, though the castle interiors were shot at Hoghton Tower. The second series also featured more visual effects; in Episode 5 Adam dreams about being chased by a giant testicle (which was computer-generated) and in Episode 6 a fireworks explosion was supervised by pyrotechnics experts. The testicle dream scene drew mixed reaction. The <b>Mirrors</b> <b>television</b> critic Charlie Catchpole praised it but Robert Bathurst was critical: [...] "I hated that sequence. I thought it was really unfunny. It was a lousy prop and awful graphics and {{there was too much}} of it—it would have been much better if it was like a Monty Python foot come smacking down like that and get it over with. You couldn't keep up that surprise and hilarity for all the minutes it was on the screen." [...] By the third series, Cold Feets sets were permanently located on a Granada warehouse stage and were left intact between series. This meant the basic sets could be used on other Granada programmes, such as The Grimleys and My Beautiful Son. After the final episode was filmed in 2002, the sets were dismantled and taken to a landfill.|$|R

He later auditioned for the role of Rudy Huxtable on The Cosby Show. According to White, he was cast in the role (the character was originally intended to be male) but was replaced by Keshia Knight Pulliam when Bill Cosby decided to <b>mirror</b> his <b>television</b> family after his real life family. The following year, he was cast as the son of Flip Wilson and Gladys Knight on the CBS sitcom Charlie and Company. The series was intended to be CBS' answer to the highly rated Cosby Show which debuted on NBC in 1984. Unlike The Cosby Show, Charlie and Company did not catch on with audiences and was canceled in May 1986. In 1987, he appeared in the pilot episode for Good Morning, Miss Bliss, and had a guest role on Mr. Belvedere. In 1988, White had a supporting role in Cadets, a sitcom starring Soleil Moon Frye. The pilot episode aired during a preview special on September 25, 1988 on ABC. The series, however, was not picked up by the network. Also during the 1980s, he appeared in a few segments of NBC's One to Grow On.|$|R
40|$|One of {{the primary}} {{assumptions}} of dance studies is that dance as an art only exists {{in the moment of}} movement and as a result it is transmitted, in a form of mimesis, directly from the body of the teacher to that of the student. Historically, prior to the advent of <b>mirrored</b> studios, <b>television,</b> video and the internet, this was true. However dancers throughout the twentieth and into the twenty-first century have moved to studying dance via different mediated environments: first the mirror... then the screen. This essay asks a series of questions concerning the kinesthetic experience of the dancer whose training is increasingly influenced by technology. What is the impact of these spatial and technological developments on a dancers’ conscious awareness or their kinesthetic interpretation of self? Has the experience of the dancing self moved from the cultural to the virtual? If so, how has Marleau-Ponty’s version of the ‘lived’ body been transformed by the body/mind’s engagement with technology? Are dance cultures being defined by their locality or by their evolution over the internet?The conference was sponsored by A. D. S. A., the Department of Performance Studies, the School of Letters, Arts and Media, and the Faculty of Arts of the University of Sydney...|$|R
