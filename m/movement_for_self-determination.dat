25|$|The Slovene People's Party {{launched}} a <b>movement</b> <b>for</b> <b>self-determination,</b> demanding {{the creation of}} a semi-independent South Slavic state under Habsburg rule. The proposal was picked up by most Slovene parties, and a mass mobilization of Slovene civil society, known as the Declaration Movement, followed. This demand was rejected by the Austrian political elites; but following the dissolution of the Austro-Hungarian Empire {{in the aftermath of the}} First World War, the National Council of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs took power in Zagreb on 6 October 1918. On 29 October, independence was declared by a national gathering in Ljubljana, and by the Croatian parliament, declaring the establishment of the new State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs.|$|E
25|$|World War I {{destroyed}} both empires. The Russian Revolution of 1917 led to {{the founding}} of the Soviet Union under the Bolsheviks, and subsequent civil war in Russia. A Ukrainian national <b>movement</b> <b>for</b> <b>self-determination</b> re-emerged, with heavy Communist and Socialist influence. Several Ukrainian states briefly emerged: the internationally recognized Ukrainian People's Republic (UNR, the predecessor of modern Ukraine, was declared on 23 June 1917 proclaimed at first {{as a part of the}} Russian Republic; after the Bolshevik Revolution, the Ukrainian People's Republic proclaimed its independence on 25 January 1918), the Hetmanate, the Directorate and the pro-Bolshevik Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic (or Soviet Ukraine) successively established territories in the former Russian Empire; while the West Ukrainian People's Republic and the Hutsul Republic emerged briefly in the Ukrainian lands of former Austro-Hungarian territory.|$|E
500|$|With the Partition of British India in 1947, Dhaka {{became the}} capital of East Pakistan. The city's {{population}} increased dramatically because of Muslim migration from across Bengal {{and other parts of}} the subcontinent, putting heavy strains on infrastructure. The Awami League was formed at the Rose Garden Palace in 1949 as the Bengali alternative to the domination of the Muslim League in Pakistan. Growing political, cultural and economic rifts emerged between the two wings of the country. The Bengali Language Movement reached its peak in 1952. Dhaka remained a center of revolutionary and political activity, as student activism and demands for autonomy increased. The Six point movement in 1966 was widely supported by the city's residents. The city had an influential press, with prominent newspapers like the [...] Ittefaq and the Weekly Holiday. During the political and constitutional crisis in 1971, the military junta led by Yahya Khan refused to transfer power to the newly elected National Assembly, causing mass riots, civil disobedience and a <b>movement</b> <b>for</b> <b>self-determination.</b> On 7 March 1971, Awami League leader Sheikh Mujibur Rahman addressed a massive public gathering at the Ramna Race Course Maidan in Dhaka, in which he warned of an independence struggle. Subsequently, East Pakistan came under a non-co-operation movement against the Pakistani state. On Pakistan's Republic Day (23 March 1971), Bangladeshi flags were hoisted throughout Dhaka in a show of resistance.|$|E

5000|$|As noted, {{self-determination}} movements {{remain strong}} {{in some areas}} of the world. Some areas possess de facto independence, such as Taiwan, North Cyprus, Kosovo, and South Ossetia, but their independence is disputed by one or more major states.

40|$|This article distinguishes {{resident}} and neighbourhood movements {{on the basis}} of their primary purpose: as <b>movements</b> <b>for</b> neighbourhood defence, <b>movements</b> <b>for</b> <b>self-determination,</b> <b>movements</b> <b>for</b> social inclusion, and <b>movements</b> <b>for</b> radical change. <b>Movements</b> <b>for</b> neighbourhood defence are further classified in terms of the primary threat against which the defence is aimed: excessive increases in rent or property tax, evictions, racial oppression, gentrification, privatisation, and loss of amenity or asset value. Particular attention is paid to the tenants' movement, arguing that it is primarily a <b>movement</b> <b>for</b> social inclusion. It is also argued that Bourdieu's concepts of habitus, field, and crisis provide an effective framework for making sense of {{resident and}} neighbourhood movement...|$|R
2500|$|Egyptian Arabic has no {{official}} status, {{and is not}} officially recognized as a language. Standard Arabic, a modernized form of Classical Arabic (Koranic Arabic), is the official language of Egypt (see diglossia). Interest in the local vernacular began in the 1800s, as the Egyptian national <b>movement</b> <b>for</b> <b>self-determination</b> was taking shape. Questions about the reform and modernization of Arabic came to the fore, and for many decades to follow they were hotly debated in Egyptian intellectual circles. Proposals ranged from developing neologisms to replace archaic terminology in Standard Arabic; to the simplification of syntactical and morphological rules {{and the introduction of}} colloquialisms; to complete [...] "Egyptianization" [...] (tamṣīr) by abandoning the so-called Standard Arabic in favor of Masri or Egyptian Arabic.|$|E
2500|$|World War II, {{which played}} a major role in Solomons history, did not have a major impact upon Malaita. Auki became the {{temporary}} capital when Tulagi was seized by the Japanese, and it too was briefly raided by Japan, but little fighting happened on the island. Malaitans who fought in battalions, however, brought a new <b>movement</b> <b>for</b> <b>self-determination</b> known as Maasina Ruru (or [...] "Marching Rule"), which spread quickly across the island. Participants united across traditional religious, ethnic, and clan lines, lived in fortified nontraditional villages, and refused to cooperate with the British. The organization of the movement on Malaita was considerable. The islands was divided into nine districts, roughly along the lines of the government administrative districts, and leaders were selected for each district. Courts were set up, each led by a custom chief (alaha'ohu), who became powerful figures. The British initially treated the movement cautiously, even praised aspects of it, but when they found there could be no common ground between the government and the movement, retaliated firmly, with armed police patrols, insisting that the chiefs recant or be arrested. Some did recant, but in September 1947 most were tried in Honiara, charged with terrorism or robbery, and convicted to years of hard labour.|$|E

25|$|In 2006, Chatterji {{began working}} with {{organizations}} in the Indian Kashmir, {{at the invitation of}} Parvez Imroz, a human rights lawyer and a civil rights activist in Srinagar. In April 2008, Chatterji and Imroz founded the International People's Tribunal on Human Rights and Justice (IPTK), which aims to document and internationally publicize the human rights abuses and state violence in the Indian Kashmir. The Tribunal also sought to document the state of juvenile justice, prisoner rights, the use of land-mines, illegal detentions, and minority issues. It also aimed to analyse the conditions in Kashmir wrought by the presence of Indian military, and the alleged subjugation of <b>movements</b> <b>for</b> <b>self-determination.</b>|$|R

50|$|During {{the latter}} part of the nineteenth century, the impulse towards {{autonomy}} which was felt by some of the propertied and educated elites was frustrated by international, political and economic circumstances outside their control. The production of sugar from cane continued to dominate the Caribbean economies, with oil, minerals and tourism becoming important items in the twentieth century. The influx of American capital and the gradual diminution of European interests in the Caribbean led to the expansion of American influence in the region from the turn of the century onwards, notably in Cuba, Haiti and Santo Domingo. This was the context in which the <b>movements</b> <b>for</b> <b>self-determination</b> worked, complicated everywhere by racial prejudice and disparities in the ownership of property.|$|R

50|$|During the 1950s, {{government}} policy changed toward American Indians, and politicians recommended termination {{of many of}} the tribes' special relationships with the government under federal recognition of their status, in favor of assimilation. Over 100 tribes were terminated; those that continued suffered from increased governmental paternalism. During the 1960s and later, with increased activism for civil rights and American Indian rights, the <b>movement</b> <b>for</b> <b>self-determination</b> gained strength.|$|E
50|$|During the 1920s and 1930s {{there were}} some {{successful}} <b>movements</b> <b>for</b> <b>self-determination</b> in {{the beginnings of the}} process of decolonization. In the Statute of Westminster the United Kingdom granted independence to Canada, New Zealand, Newfoundland, the Irish Free State, the Commonwealth of Australia, and the Union of South Africa after the British parliament declared itself as incapable of passing laws over them without their consent. Egypt, Afghanistan and Iraq also achieved independence from Britain and Lebanon from France. Other efforts were unsuccessful, like the Indian independence movement. And Italy, Japan and Germany all initiated new efforts to bring certain territories under their control, leading to World War II. In particular, the National Socialist Program invoked this right of nations in its first point (out of 25), as it was publicly proclaimed on 24 February 1920 by Adolf Hitler.|$|R
50|$|Francoism {{fiercely}} oppressed {{any kind}} of regional nationalism in Spain and its colonies. However, the 1960s were years known for the activism of various groups.

The MPAIAC created {{the flag of the}} seven green stars that is accepted by the nationalist movement as a whole today.|$|R
50|$|A {{great deal}} of {{political}} party activity ensued when Equatorial Guinea attained autonomy from Spain in 1963. Bubi and Fernandino parties on the island preferred separation from Río Muni or a loose federation. Ethnically-based parties in Río Muni favored independence for a united country comprising Bioko and Río Muni, an approach that was adopted. The <b>Movement</b> <b>for</b> the <b>Self-Determination</b> of Bioko Island (MAIB), which advocates independence for the island under Bubi control, {{is one of the}} offshoots of the era immediately preceding independence.|$|R

Divisions soon emerged between radicals and moderates within ASFAR leading to the formation in 1998 of the National Youth Rights Association (NYRA). NYRA, founded by leaders of ASFAR and YouthSpeak, was founded to professionalize the youth rights movement.|$|E
