25|$|Potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) is {{the major}} food and cash crop after banana, in the {{highland}} region. Next in order of priority are maize, beans and wheat. In order to increase the growth of these crops in the highland region, inter cropping of bean, potato, pea and wheat was tested on an experimental basis with Seasbani sesban (Sesbania); lime and manure were added as supplements for the growth. Species of shrubs such as Sasbania, Leucaena, Calliandra and Markamia showed better growth than in the Central Plateau Region where similar studies were conducted. Studies have been conducted since 1987 by the National Agricultural Research Institute (ISAR) who maintains a substation in Rwerere, Western Province within the highlands. In order to increase agricultural production with use new commercial crops have been adopted in the project area. The crops adopted are <b>maracuja</b> (<b>passion</b> <b>fruit),</b> an export item, and potatoes. In addition, modern livestock breeding techniques have also been adopted. This project under the aegeis of IFAD, has been found successful in increasing the incomes and purchasing power of the farmers and pastorals.

40|$|To {{study the}} effect of {{utilization}} of <b>passion</b> <b>fruit</b> hulls (Passiflora edulis Sims f. edulis Deg) as feed component on consumption, digestion and nitrogen retention in kacang goats, a trial was conducted using 20 young kacang goats (average initial body weight 23. 73 ± 2. 16 kg). The experiment was arranged in completely randomized design consisting of 4 diets and 5 replications. Animal were randomly allocated into 4 diets (0, 15, 30, 45 % of <b>passion</b> <b>fruit</b> hulls). Each diet contains 2550 Kcal/kg metabolism energy and 14 % crude protein. The feeding level was set at 3. 8 % of body weight based on dry matter. The results of the experiment showed that average dry matter intake, nutrient digestibility, and nitrogen retention were not affected by level of <b>passion</b> <b>fruit</b> hulls (P> 0. 05), although nutrient digestibility and nitrogen retention tended to decrease with the increasing level of <b>passion</b> <b>fruit</b> hulls. It was concluded that <b>passion</b> <b>fruit</b> hulls can be used till 45 % level in the diet...|$|R
