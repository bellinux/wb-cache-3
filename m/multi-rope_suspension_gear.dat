50|$|Panic snaps {{are also}} used on certain types of BDSM leather <b>suspension</b> <b>gear</b> {{for the same reasons}} as their use with rope. They are {{sometimes}} called quick release cuffs.|$|R
50|$|Usually {{adjustable}} vehicle parts include {{shock absorbers}} and anti-roll bar (<b>suspension),</b> <b>gear</b> ratios and differential, tyre pressures and type, wing angles, wheel toe and camber angle, brake bias, steering lock and ride height.|$|R
5000|$|The 125-SM is a Supermotard style {{bike with}} taller street tuned <b>suspension,</b> tallish <b>gearing,</b> and reduced weight.|$|R
5000|$|The Commuterlite class {{which was}} {{introduced}} in 2011 allows any ADR compliant 125cc 4 stroke motorcycle, of any age to race. The rules have been kept very simple only allowing changes to exhaust, <b>suspension</b> <b>gearing</b> and bodywork. These simple rules keep the costs down to the very minimum and have been creating close and exciting racing where beginner and accomplished riders alike can hone their race craft and {{have a lot of}} fun in the process.|$|R
5000|$|Reviewers at {{the time}} found the bike expensive, but were {{generally}} positive, liking the sporting feel of the <b>suspension,</b> <b>gearing</b> and brakes, as well praising the fuel economy and the Italian styling. [...] The series {{would prove to be}} one of Ducati's most successful early efforts. [...] The price, performance, and stylish looks of the 98S became popular in the Italian la passeggiata (street cruising scene) of the era and sold well in the home market.|$|R
50|$|It is {{recommended}} that canisters be left on the ground, at least 100 feet /30 metres from the campsite. Suspending the canister can allow the bear to smash {{it to the ground}} or use the <b>suspension</b> <b>gear</b> to carry it away. To prevent a bear from rolling it away, the container could be left in a bush, a shallow depression, or wedged between rocks or logs. Placing the canister near water could allow the container to float away. Reflective tape and labelling the container helps in recovery.|$|R

50|$|During the 1960s and 1970s, BriSCA Formula 1 Stock Cars {{attracted}} big crowds to Cadwell. The gradient changes added {{excitement to}} the racing, as stock car drivers {{were accustomed to}} racing on flat 400-yard oval tracks of shale or tarmac; and likewise their cars' <b>suspensions</b> and <b>gearing</b> were set up for short flat ovals.|$|R
25|$|The Ascender II was an {{improved}} Ascender with evolutionary changes incorporated. It had {{an improved}} muffler, re-located throttle and fiberglass spring rod main landing <b>gear</b> <b>suspension.</b>|$|R
50|$|Suspension {{was simple}} but {{effective}} with double wishbone and coil springs {{at the front}}, and a live rear axle with trailing arms and coils at the rear. Brakes consisted of discs at the front and drums at the rear. The <b>suspension,</b> steering <b>gear,</b> brakes and rear axle were adapted from the Vauxhall Firenza {{with the exception of}} the front brakes, which were the widely used Girling Type 14 Calipers.|$|R
50|$|To save time, Renault based the <b>suspension</b> {{and running}} <b>gear</b> on {{that of the}} AMR 35 that was {{designed}} for the cavalry. It had five wheels at each side, fitted with horizontal leaf springs, like the AMC 35.|$|R
50|$|The {{front wheels}} are driven through a four-speed gearbox with column shift, with {{synchromesh}} {{on the upper}} three <b>gears.</b> <b>Suspension</b> at the front is provided by two transverse leaf springs, and at the back by three torsion bars each side.|$|R
50|$|The event {{features}} Pro 4 {{four-wheel drive}} Trophy Trucks racing with studded tires. The tires are manufactured with an inner liner and feature approximately 700 studs. The studs have ruined the fiberglass fenders of some trucks. The 900-horsepower trucks have modified jets in their carburetors {{for the less}} dense air in the higher altitude. Teams had to adjust their <b>suspensions</b> and <b>gear</b> ratios for the conditions. Trucks didn't need to use as efficient of cooling systems in the cooler temperatures.|$|R
5000|$|The 1904 model had a one-cylinder, 7 hp, {{water-cooled}} engine, {{a planetary}} transmission and a sliding <b>gear</b> <b>suspension.</b> It had a 65" [...] wheelbase. One version, called the Sandusky, was advertised at $650, {{in a review}} of 88 current models in Frank Leslie's Popular Monthly.|$|R
50|$|The main {{landing gear}} {{consists}} of sprung fibreglass gear legs with 5X5.00 tires as standard on graphite wheel rims. Larger 6X6.00 tires are optional. The nose gear is a single-fork design also made from fibreglass. Nose <b>gear</b> <b>suspension</b> is a compressed rubber donut system.|$|R
5000|$|In the 1990s Chevron {{developed}} a race-car {{based on the}} Mazda RX-7 drivetrain called the [...] "Aprisa" [...] which was raced successfully on the New Zealand sports car circuit. The car is still available and uses <b>suspension</b> and running <b>gear</b> from both series 4 and 5 RX-7s.|$|R
5000|$|The {{airframe}} {{is constructed}} entirely from wood {{and covered with}} aircraft fabric. The landing gear is of conventional configuration with bungee <b>suspension</b> with tricycle <b>gear</b> optional. The aircraft's installed power range is [...] and the standard engine is the [...] Rotax 503, although the [...] 2si 540 has also been used.|$|R
50|$|In 2002, a new passive {{suspension}} component {{was invented by}} Malcolm C. Smith, the inerter. This {{has the ability to}} increase the effective inertia of a wheel <b>suspension</b> using a <b>geared</b> flywheel, but without adding significant mass. It was initially employed in Formula 1 in secrecy but has since spread to other motorsport.|$|R
50|$|MRC {{features}} ten cars, {{which are}} divided into two groups: road cars and off-road vehicles. There are seven different areas for car customization: tires, brakes, <b>suspension,</b> steering, transmission, <b>gear</b> ratio, and aerodynamics. MRC includes three tracks: Sea Side, Mountain, and Downtown. The courses have multiple paths and mirror images can be unlocked.|$|R
5000|$|MZ {{manufactured}} {{a line of}} 125 cc four-stroke motorcycles {{using an}} engine that was designed in-house. The MZ 125 produces [...] and nearly [...] of torque. It is a liquid-cooled, dual-overhead-cam design with four valves, high-voltage electronic ignition and an 11,000 rpm ignition cut-off. This engine was used in four models, all of which share a common frame. The frame is a tube-steel backbone with the engine as a stressed bottom member. Differences in the <b>suspension,</b> fascia, <b>gearing,</b> and equipment make the four models relatively distinct, despite the shared platform. All four bikes feature a six-speed transmission and dual disc brakes.|$|R
50|$|The floorpans {{came from}} the Type 1 Karmann Ghia, which had a wider floorpan than the Beetle. Rear swing axle <b>suspension</b> with {{reduction}} <b>gearing</b> from the discontinued split-screen Volkswagen Transporter was used until 1973, when it was replaced with double-jointed axles used by Porsche and IRS semi-trailing arm setup as used on the 1303 and US-spec Beetles.|$|R
50|$|The {{series was}} {{developed}} from the earlier Cosmos Bison, adding larger seats, landing <b>gear</b> <b>suspension</b> and a new engine mounting system to reduce vibration. It was designed to comply with European Fédération Aéronautique Internationale microlight classification. It features a cable-braced hang glider-style high-wing, weight-shift controls, a two-seats-in-tandem open cockpit, tricycle landing gear and a single engine in pusher configuration.|$|R
50|$|After {{a series}} of runway testing on rough ground, {{suspensions}} {{were added to the}} landing gear to improve handling and the number of electric motors was increased to four. The first prototype flew on February 28, 2014. ARCA released several images of AirStrato taking off and flying at very low altitude. The press release stated that the right landing <b>gear</b> <b>suspension</b> was damaged on landing.|$|R
50|$|In the {{prototype}} vehicles the V-12 Maybach HL120 {{engine of the}} Panzer IV {{was replaced by a}} lighter Inline-6 Maybach HL66P engine. Production vehicles probably would have used the <b>suspension</b> and running <b>gear</b> of the Panzerkampfwagen III as it offered increased maneuverability due to a shorter length of track in contact with the ground, less rolling resistance, softer springs and greater deflection of the suspension.|$|R
50|$|As {{war broke}} out, the British had placed into {{production}} the A13, a new faster Cruiser tank utilizing the <b>suspension</b> and running <b>gear</b> {{concepts of the}} American designer J. Walter Christie. This new suspension provided a fast, highly maneuverable design that {{became the basis for}} the rapid evolution of the Cruiser tank such as the Mk IV (A13 Mk II) a British cruiser tank derived from the original A13.|$|R
25|$|In 1994 the Caprice {{received}} new engines, {{including an}} optional detuned {{version of the}} Corvette's LT1 350cuin (5.7L) engine that put out 260hp (194kW) and 330lb·ft (447N·m) of torque. The standard engine in all sedans, including the 9C1 police cars, was the , L99 263 (4.3L) V8. TheLT1 was optional in the 9C1 police package and standard in the wagon. The LT1350 was standard in the civilian sedans {{with the addition of}} the B4U towing package. The towing package also gave a heavy duty suspension nearly identical to the 9C1 police car <b>suspension,</b> 2.93 <b>gears,</b> heavy duty cooling, heavy duty rear drum brakes and limited-slip differential. The 1994 Caprice's interior had a redesign which featured a Camaro steering wheel, digital speedometer and a new console.|$|R
50|$|Top speeds in the National Class {{are easily}} {{as high as}} in the other junior {{formulae}} of BMW and Renault, but cornering speeds tend to be lower as Formula Ford cars lack the downforce-producing aerodynamic aids on the other cars; handling is therefore entirely down to mechanical grip, {{and the lack of}} wings ensures that cars following another are not aerodynamically disadvantaged, allowing some of the closest racing with plenty of overtaking. Series' rules may permit slick or treaded tyres, generally supplied either by Dunlop or Avon. As the rules limit engine modifications, all cars are relatively equal and racing results tend to be close. Formula Fords allow <b>suspension,</b> damping, <b>gearing</b> and braking bias changes, but not aerodynamic options such as winged cars.|$|R

50|$|Underbones {{are very}} popular in Southeast Asia. There is a demand for {{aftermarket}} and tuner parts. Many enthusiasts modify their underbones either for show (such as installing small sound systems, neon lights and custom paint jobs) or for performance (like increasing the engine power and fine tuning the <b>suspension).</b> Riding <b>gear</b> may not even extend to wearing shoes and long pants for safety. Illegal underbone drag racing has become popular {{in countries such as}} the Philippines and Malaysia, and poses safety issues for the commuting public as well as the riders themselves, as underbones offer little protection in the event of crashes. The most popular underbone for these purposes is the Honda XRM, Suzuki Raider 150 and the Honda Wave, although similar models from Kawasaki and Yamaha are also frequently used.|$|R
50|$|The {{aircraft}} is {{made from}} bolted-together aluminum tubing, with the wings and tail surfaces covered in Dacron sailcloth. Its tapered planform, single-surface, 30.5 ft span wing is supported by both lift struts and jury struts. The wing features 3/4 span ailerons. The pilot is accommodated in an open seat without a windshield. The tail surfaces are mounted on tubes that travel beside and below the pusher engine and propeller. The tricycle landing gear features main <b>gear</b> <b>suspension.</b>|$|R
