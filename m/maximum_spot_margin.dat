40|$|Abstract. Spotting {{ignition}} by lofted firebrands is {{a significant}} mechanism of fire spread, as observed in many large-scale fires. The role of firebrands in fire propagation and the important parameters involved in spot fire development are studied. Historical large-scale fires, including wind-driven urban and wildland conflagrations and post-earthquake fires are given as examples. In addition, research on firebrand behaviour is reviewed. The phenomenon of spotting fires comprises three sequential mechanisms: generation, transport and ignition of recipient fuel. In order to understand these mechanisms, many experiments have been performed, such as measuring drag on firebrands, analysing the flow fields of flame and plume structures, collecting firebrands from burning materials, houses and wildfires, and observing firebrand burning characteristics in wind tunnels under the terminal velocity condition and ignition characteristics of fuel beds. The knowledge obtained from the experiments was used to develop firebrand models. Since Tarifa developed a firebrand model based on the terminal velocity approximation, many firebrand transport models {{have been developed to}} predict <b>maximum</b> <b>spot</b> fire distance. Combustion models of a firebrand were developed empirically and the <b>maximum</b> <b>spot</b> fire distance was found at the burnout limit. Recommendations for future research and development are provided...|$|R
40|$|Large eddy {{simulation}} {{of the wind}} surface layer above and within vegetation was conducted {{in the presence of}} an idealised forest fire by using an equivalent volumetric heat source. Firebrand’s particles are represented as spherical particles {{with a wide range of}} sizes, which were located into the combustion volume in a random fashion and are convected in the ascending plume as Lagrangian points. The thermally thin particles undergo drag relative to the flow and moisture loss as they are dried and pyrolysis, char-combustion, and mass loss as they burn. The particle momentum, heat and mass transfer, and combustion governing equations were computed along particle trajectories in the unsteady 3 D wind field until their deposition on the ground. The spotting distances are compared with the <b>maximum</b> <b>spotting</b> distance obtained with Albini model for several idealised line grass or torching trees fires scenarios. The prediction of the particle <b>maximum</b> <b>spotting</b> distance for a 2000 [*]kW/m short grass fire compared satisfactorily with results from Albini model and underpredicted by 40 % the results for a high intensity 50000 [*]kW/m fire. For the cases of single and four torching trees the model predicts the maximum distances consistently but for slightly different particle diameter...|$|R

The exchange rate position in the band (deviation of the deutschemark (DEM) spot rates from the DEM central parity) significantly induces intervention activity.
