5|$|During {{the decade}} of the 530s, it seemed to many that God had {{abandoned}} the Christian Roman Empire. There were noxious fumes in the air; and the Sun, while still providing day, refused to give <b>much</b> <b>heat.</b> This caused famine unlike anything those of the time had seen before, weakening the people of Europe and the Middle East.|$|E
5|$|In {{the short}} time frame of the Manhattan Project, Hanford {{engineers}} produced many significant technological advances. As {{no one had ever}} built an industrial-scale nuclear reactor before, scientists were unsure how <b>much</b> <b>heat</b> would be generated by fission during normal operations. Seeking the greatest possible production while maintaining an adequate safety margin, DuPont engineers installed ammonia-based refrigeration systems with the D and F reactors to further chill the river water before its use as reactor coolant.|$|E
5|$|Scientists {{analyzing}} the unique cracks lining Europa found evidence showing that it likely spun around a tilted axis {{at some point}} in time. If correct, this would explain many of Europa's features. Europa's immense network of crisscrossing cracks serves as a record of the stresses caused by massive tides in its global ocean. Europa's tilt could influence calculations of how much of its history is recorded in its frozen shell, how <b>much</b> <b>heat</b> is generated by tides in its ocean, and even how long the ocean has been liquid. Its ice layer must stretch to accommodate these changes. When there is too much stress, it cracks. A tilt in Europa's axis could suggest that its cracks may be much more recent than previously thought. The reason is that the direction of the spin pole may change by as much as a few degrees per day, completing one precession period over several months. A tilt also could affect the estimates of the age of Europa's ocean. Tidal forces are thought to generate the heat that keeps Europa's ocean liquid, and a tilt in the spin axis means that more heat is generated by tidal forces. This heat helps the ocean to remain liquid longer. Scientists did not specify when the tilt would have occurred and measurements have not been made of the tilt of Europa's axis.|$|E

25|$|Fluorescent lamps operate best around room temperature. At {{much lower}} or higher temperatures, {{efficacy}} decreases. At below-freezing temperatures standard lamps may not start. Special lamps {{may be needed}} for reliable service outdoors in cold weather. In applications such as road and railway signalling, fluorescent lamps which do not generate as <b>much</b> <b>heat</b> as incandescent lamps may not melt snow and ice build up around the lamp, leading to reduced visibility.|$|E
25|$|Very low {{voltages}} are inefficient {{since the}} lead wires would conduct too <b>much</b> <b>heat</b> away from the filament, so the practical lower limit for incandescent lamps is 1.5 volts. Very long filaments for high voltages are fragile, and lamp bases become more difficult to insulate, so lamps for illumination are not made with rated voltages over 300 volts. Some infrared heating elements are made for higher voltages, but these use tubular bulbs with widely separated terminals.|$|E
25|$|A fever can {{be caused}} by many medical {{conditions}} ranging from not serious to potentially serious. This includes viral, bacterial and parasitic infections such as the common cold, urinary tract infections, meningitis, malaria and appendicitis among others. Non-infectious causes include vasculitis, deep vein thrombosis, side effects of medication, and cancer among others. It differs from hyperthermia, in that hyperthermia is an increase in body temperature over the temperature set-point, due to either too <b>much</b> <b>heat</b> production or not enough heat loss.|$|E

25|$|The {{amount of}} heat {{provided}} to customers is often recorded with a heat meter to encourage conservation and maximize the number of customers which can be served, but such meters are expensive. Due to the expense of heat metering, an alternative approach is simply to meter the water – water meters are much cheaper than heat meters, and {{have the advantage of}} encouraging consumers to extract as <b>much</b> <b>heat</b> as possible, leading to a very low return temperature, which increases the efficiency of power generation.|$|E
25|$|Nephila {{change their}} body {{positioning}} {{relative to the}} sun to maintain internal temperatures at an optimal level. As ambient temperatures increase the spider will position itself so the abdomen shades the cephalothorax from the sun. Spiders may also hang from their hind legs {{as a result of}} the heat due to a loss of hydrostatic pressure. Conversely as temperatures cool down the spider will position itself perpendicular to the sun to retain as <b>much</b> <b>heat</b> energy as possible. When ambient temperatures reach extreme highs (above 40°C) Nephila may leave their web and seek shade in the surrounding environment.|$|E

Yet Australia, {{give or take a}} few minutes, achieved it, their captain leading the way with the highest opening stand ever, in a partnership with Lawry, for Australia against England: 244. I never remember seeing better running between wickets than of these two – and found myself comparing them, in fact, with Hobbs and Sutcliffe. With the field constantly changing over as right- and left-hander alternated, England, in <b>much</b> <b>heat,</b> sweated and chased unavailingly.|$|E
25|$|HI is {{preferred}} over other hydrogen halides because the iodide ion {{is a much}} better nucleophile than bromide or chloride, so the reaction can take place at a reasonable rate without <b>much</b> <b>heating.</b> This reaction also occurs for secondary and tertiary alcohols, but substitution occurs via the SN1 pathway.|$|R

In August 1983, five of the sixteen girls from the 1933 Juliette Low Memorial Fund group returned for their 50th anniversary and placed a plaque on the tree they had planted outside the library window.

25|$|Sodium bicarbonate, {{regular or}} {{ordinary}} used on class B and C fires, {{was the first}} of the dry chemical agents developed. In the heat of a fire, it releases a cloud of carbon dioxide that smothers the fire. That is, the gas drives oxygen away from the fire, thus stopping the chemical reaction. This agent is not generally effective on class A fires because the agent is expended and the cloud of gas dissipates quickly, and if the fuel is still sufficiently hot, the fire starts up again. While liquid and gas fires do not usually store <b>much</b> <b>heat</b> in their fuel source, solid fires do. Sodium bicarbonate was very common in commercial kitchens before the advent of wet chemical agents, but now is falling out of favor, as it is much less effective than wet chemical agents for class K fires, less effective than Purple-K for class B fires, and is ineffective on class A fires.

25|$|The key to {{deciphering}} Uranus's spectrum {{was found}} in the 1930s by Rupert Wildt and Vesto Slipher, who found that the dark bands at 543, 619, 925, 865 and 890nm belonged to gaseous methane. They had never been observed before because they were very weak and required a long path length to be detected. This meant that the atmosphere of Uranus was transparent to a much greater depth compared to those of other giant planets. In 1950, Gerard Kuiper noticed another diffuse dark band in the spectrum of Uranus at 827nm, which he failed to identify. In 1952 Gerhard Herzberg, a future Nobel Prize winner, showed that this band was caused by the weak quadrupole absorption of molecular hydrogen, which thus became the second compound detected on Uranus. Until 1986 only two gases, methane and hydrogen, were known in the Uranian atmosphere. The far-infrared spectroscopic observation beginning from 1967 consistently showed the atmosphere of Uranus was in approximate thermal balance with incoming solar radiation (in other words, it radiated as <b>much</b> <b>heat</b> as it received from the Sun), and no internal heat source was required to explain observed temperatures. No discrete features had been observed on Uranus prior to the Voyager 2 visit in 1986.|$|E

500|$|The {{level of}} heat input also affects weld quality. [...] Low heat input, caused by low welding current or high welding speed, can limit {{penetration}} and cause the weld bead to lift {{away from the}} surface being welded. If there is too <b>much</b> <b>heat</b> input, however, the weld bead grows in width while the likelihood of excessive penetration and spatter increase. Additionally, if the welding torch is {{too far from the}} workpiece the shielding gas becomes ineffective, causing porosity within the weld. This results in a weld with pinholes, which is weaker than a typical weld.|$|E
