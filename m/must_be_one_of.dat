5|$|After fleeing Aboukir Bay, Admiral Villeneuve {{had been}} delayed in the Eastern Mediterranean by northeasterly winds, and on 17 August {{he decided to}} split his forces, sailing for Malta with his {{flagship}} Guillaume Tell and the two frigates while Captain Louis-Jean-Nicolas Lejoille on Généreux was ordered to Corfu. Before they departed, a number of men were transferred to Généreux, which was already carrying survivors from Timoléon, one of the ships destroyed in Aboukir Bay, giving Généreux a crew of 936 men. As Généreux rounded the island of Goza off the western tip of Crete (then known as Candia) on the following morning, his lookouts reported a sail to the northwest. This vessel was Leander. Learning of the strange ship to the southeast, Captain Thompson deduced that it <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> Villeneuve's ships and immediately ordered all sails set {{in an effort to}} avoid an unequal combat: Généreux carried 30 more guns than Leander and was more strongly built, carrying a broadside of over 1,000lbs to Leanders 432lbs.|$|E
5|$|Tintin and Haddock later realise that Calculus {{has gone}} missing, and surmise {{that he has}} been kidnapped by the same {{individual}} who placed Tarragon in a coma. The police set up road blocks, but the kidnappers switch cars and are able to evade them. Tintin visits a hospital where the seven stricken members of the Sanders-Hardiman expedition are housed; he is astonished that at a precise time of day, all awaken and scream about figures attacking them before slipping back into their comas. Haddock is dejected by Calculus' abduction, but upon learning that police have spotted the kidnapper's car at a port, he and Tintin race there, believing that the abductors seek to board a boat with Calculus and take him abroad. At the docks, they spot Alcazar boarding a ship to South America; he reveals that Chiquito has disappeared and {{that he was one of}} the last descendants of the Inca, with Tintin surmising that Chiquito <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> Calculus' captors.|$|E

25|$|Skating: A common fallacy is {{that the}} goaltender can get by with merely {{adequate}} skating, and often young players are placed in net because of their poor skating. In fact, the goaltender <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the best technical skaters on the team, and {{must be able to}} keep up with the moves of every skater on opposing teams. In particular, goaltenders must be adept at lateral skating and quick pivoting. Goaltenders must also have exceptional leg strength and the capability for very explosive movement.|$|E

This bat, which <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the strangest ever to make an {{appearance}} in a Test match, is bolstered up with a solid slab of leather bound firmly round the blade. It has the colour of a very old violin. Its handle is so pliable that it can be twisted in all directions. It must have seen its best days when its owner was a little boy at school. It has been a scrap-heap job for years. But Iverson seldom places much strain upon it.|$|E
25|$|The size, shape, material, decoration, and {{lettering}} {{style of}} jitsuin are closely regulated by law. For example, in Hiroshima, a jitsuin {{is expected to}} be roughly , usually square or (rarely) rectangular but never round, irregular, or oval, and must contain the individual's full family and given name, without abbreviation. The lettering must be red with a white background (shubun), with roughly equal width lines used throughout the name. The font <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> several based on ancient historical lettering styles found in metal, woodcarving, and so on; ancient forms of ideographs are commonplace. A red perimeter must entirely surround the name, and there should be no other decoration on the underside (working surface) of the seal, though the top and sides (handle) of the seal may be decorated in any fashion from completely undecorated to historical animal motifs to dates, names, and inscriptions.|$|E

500|$|Dylan's {{disenchantment with}} the protest {{movement}} had previously surfaced {{in a speech}} he had given in December 1963 when accepting an award from the Emergency Civil Liberties Committee (ECLC) in New York. [...] Author Mike Marqusee has commented that [...] "No song on Another Side distressed Dylan's friends in the movement more than 'My Back Pages' in which he transmutes the rude incoherence of his ECLC rant into the organized density of art.

500|$|Giving {{evidence}} [...] to the tribunal, S. O. Davies said he {{had long}} suspected that the Aberfan tips were unstable, but had kept quiet for fear that if tipping was stopped on the mountainside the Coal Board would close the colliery. Davies added: [...] "But if I {{had been asked to}} do so, I would have done it". His testimony was strongly challenged by the NUM, whose counsel Brian Gibbens QC said that [...] "f Mr Davies is to be accepted as truthful and accurate in his recollection... then he bears what <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the largest personal burdens of responsibility for the disaster". However, Gibbens found it incredible that a man in Davies's unique local position of authority and influence would not have mentioned his fears to any of the formal bodies—borough council, Coal Board, union or local Labour Party: [...] "If anyone could have exercised influence to overcome an obdurate or ignorant monolith like the Coal Board, [...] was well placed to do so." [...] Gibbens submitted that Davies's testimony should be rejected, on the grounds that he [...] "never appreciated what in fact was the import of his words". The tribunal concurred, accepting that Davies had not fully understood the gravity of his admission, and adding that had they been convinced otherwise, he could not have escaped censure. The tribunal's findings, published in July 1967, placed responsibility for the disaster firmly on the National Coal Board, specifically on the absence of any tipping policy.|$|E
