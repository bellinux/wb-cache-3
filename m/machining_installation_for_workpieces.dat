40|$|Special Paperpg. 267 - 274 At recent {{chemical}} plants and {{liquefied natural gas}} (LNG) plants, the increase of plant capacity has caused the size of turbomachinery to increase and larger nozzle sizes are being utilized. Especially for offshore facilities, a simpler piping arrangements is required despite the larger capacity trend because the space around the turbomachinery is constrained and therefore the piping design allows for less flexibility in its arrangement. Additionally, the heavier total weight of the turbomachinery and the larger size of piping nozzles {{make it more difficult}} for plant contractors to handle external piping forces and moments. Although NEMA SM 23 (1994) or API standard 617 (2002) have been conventionally referred to for allowable loads in turbomachinery piping arrangement designs, the increase in plant capacity and piping size with larger <b>machine</b> <b>installations</b> <b>for</b> offshore facilities has heightened the need to relax this specification. In this study, the possibility of relaxing the maximum allowable load on centrifugal compressors and steam turbines in investigated based on the general design philosophy of turbomachinery, the authors? experience and analysis of quantitative influence using finite element method (FEM) of typical machines with a piping load of 1. 85 times the allowable limit specified by NEMS SM 23 (1994). Various key components including nozzle deformation, stress level, clearance and misalignment of shaft ends a reexamined and, as a result, a bottleneck (i. e., the limiting factor) which should be taken into account for centrifugal compressors and steam turbines, is clarified in the case of excess piping load. Finally, applicable solution from the machine manufacturer?s side are suggested in order to relax this specification for piping loads on turbomachinery...|$|R

This paper stresses on the potential advantages associated with virtualization and the use of virtual machines for scenarios, which cannot be easily implemented and/or studied in a traditional academic network environment, but need to be explored and experimented by students to meet the raising needs and knowledge-base demanded by the IT industry. In this context, we discuss various aspects of virtualization – starting from the working principle of virtual <b>machines,</b> <b>installation</b> procedure <b>for</b> a virtual guest operating system on a physical host operating system, virtualization options and a performance study measuring the throughput obtained on a network of virtual machines and physical host machine...|$|R

The rotor winding was cooled down to 77 K. The differences when driving 0 and 190 A in the stator winding whilst ramping the field current in the locked rotor close to its critical current are discussed by interpreting small changes in the voltages measured at different locations in the winding. The perpendicular field generated by the stator produced {{the greatest impact on}} the HTS winding and its starting torque. Finally, a comparison of single-phase short circuits with three-phase short circuits unveiled a doubling in the peak stator current induced and the period for the transient to dissipate, but a moderate reduction in the peak (spiking) current in the HTS winding...|$|R

40|$|The {{installation}} and commissioning of machine {{tools such as}} the Lathe machine is very vital. Proper installation ensures appropriate functioning of equipment which minimizes chances of machine failure. Over the years, the prediction of completion time and due dates of installing and commissioning machine tools have been approached unscientifically with methods ranging from guessing to brainstorming. However, these methods {{were found to be}} unreliable and causing lots of disappointment to manufacturing companies which results in delay during {{installation and}} commissioning with attendant increase in cost implications. This study makes use of a very efficient and reliable scientific approach to develop a model that can predict the due date <b>for</b> lathe <b>machine</b> <b>installation.</b> Activities involved in <b>machine</b> <b>installation</b> and commissioning were first identified and critical path method was applied to predict the due date <b>for</b> <b>installation</b> and commissioning of the machine tools. The software programming language used for the prediction is MATLAB: an efficient and reliable software with Artificial Neural Network conditions (ANN), simulation model and set of data generated during the installation and commissioning of lathe machine which were iteratively trained in a MATLAB R. 2010 environment. The results of the predictive model were found to be highly promising. It has almost the same value when compared to manual calculations. This conclusively confirmed that the model is a veritable and vital tool in predicting the completion time and due dates. This model will find its application in all manufacturing industries that <b>machine</b> <b>installations</b> affect their production...|$|R

40|$|In the {{previously}} enclosed material {{the current situation}} of the purification of the municipal waste waters in Serbia and Macedonia was described. Also the procedure taken with the received sludge was described too. The existing and the future legal regulations for this topic were presented and the necessary technical state of the wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) in the region was shown. The two concepts for further problem solution (about the municipal waste waters) were presented, water {{that can be used}} again for irrigation. As an example for the analysis, the Community Karbinci was chosen, community which is situated in the Eastern part of Macedonia. The first concept is presented as a combination of aerobic and membranous cleaning and it is a new method which reduces the volume of the aeration tanks, place where the substances in waste waters are destroyed {{and at the same time}} the space needed for their building. The second concept is a combination of anaerobic and aerobic treatment, or in other words, anaerobic reactor and pond with aeration system are planned. After the analyses were done all the advantages and the disadvantages of the two concepts were seen and the objects dimensioned and the total estimation of the investment expenses was done. From the received results it can be concluded that the two concepts meet the demands of the European Union and the purified water can be further used for irrigation and financially they are optimum decisions of this case. Serbia and Macedonia are countries which expect to become members of the EU in the following period, and they will have to meet the standards for the cleaning of the waste waters and the protection of the environment. That is why a big progress and bigger investments for the future are expected.

50|$|A {{modified}} version of the gun, the M1931, with a heavier barrel and 150-round side-mounted pan magazine, was produced as a heavy <b>machine</b> gun <b>for</b> <b>installation</b> in tanks and fortified emplacements, particularly the Maginot Line. The heavier barrel allowed for more sustained fire before overheating, with the added mass acting as a heat sink. This was required because a weapon used in fixed emplacements must be able to deliver sustained fire, and without a quick-change barrel or water-cooling, a lighter barrel would rapidly overheat and wear out. The fact that it was no longer intended to be a portable weapon, as the FM24/29 was, meant that the added weight was of little consequence. In addition, a special twin-mounting was devised that allowed the users to fire each gun individually. This allowed the crew to switch between guns, using one while the second was cooling down. Both could be fired together in cases where a high rate of fire was required. When used singly, as in tanks and other vehicles, they were called the Modelle 1931; as a twin-mounting, they were known as the Reibel machine gun. The rate of fire of this version was raised to 600 rounds per minute per gun, although practical rate of fire was limited by the need for cooling rests and magazine changes. Production ran from 1931 to 1940.|$|R
