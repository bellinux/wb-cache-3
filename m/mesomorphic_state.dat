Upon increasing pressure beyond a threshold, the polymer, cryst. under ambient conditions, loses its cryst. order isothermally, passing through a continuously varying sequence of <b>mesomorphic</b> <b>states,</b> the process being reversible. This behavior is obsd. in 2 widely sepd. temp. regions, suggesting, for the 1 st time in a single-component system, the possibility of reentrant liq. -crystal and amorphous phases.

40|$|The {{ability of}} seeds and other {{anhydrous}} plant forms {{to survive the}} withdrawal of water must involve a mechanism for protecting the integrity of cellular membranes. Evidence from animal systems implicates sugars as protective components, and we have tested the changes in <b>mesomorphic</b> phase <b>state</b> of phospholipid model membranes upon hydration and dehydration {{in the presence of}} sucrose and/or sucrose plus raffinose. X-ray diffraction studies of dry dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine (DMPC) indicate that the presence of sucrose lowers the chain order/disorder transition temperature to that of hydrated lipid; likewise, the lamellar repeat spacings showed the dry DMPC/sucrose mixture to be {{similar to that of the}} hydrated lipid. These results support the proposed potential of sugars to substitute for water in biomembranes. If sucrose is to serve as a protectant during desiccation of seeds, its tendency to crystallize would lessen its effectiveness. Raffinose is known to serve as an inhibitor of sucrose crystallization, and is abundant in seeds. The addition of raffinose to make DMPC/sucrose/raffinose mixtures (1 / 1 / 0. 3 mass ratio) prevented sucrose crystallization, suggesting this as a possible in vivo role for raffinose...|$|R
40|$|AbstractFlow-induced {{crystallization}} {{has long}} been an important subject in polymer processing. Varying processing conditions can produce different morphologies, which lead to different properties. Recent studies indicated that the final morphology is in fact dictated by the initial formation of crystallization precursor structures (i. e. shish-kebabs) under flow. In this article, factors that affect the shish-kebab formation in entangled polymer melts are systematically reviewed, including the concept of coil–stretch transition, chain dynamics, critical orientation molecular weight, phase transition during shish and kebab formations. In particular, recent experimental results from in situ rheo-X-ray studies and ex situ microscopic examinations have been presented to illustrate several new findings of flow-induced shish-kebab structures in polymer melts. (1) The shish entity consists of stretched chains (or chain segments) that can be in the amorphous, <b>mesomorphic</b> or crystalline <b>state.</b> (2) The kebab entity mainly arises from the crystallization of coiled chains (or chain segments), which seems to follow a diffusion-control growth process. (3) A shish-kebab structure with multiple shish was seen in the ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) precursor. Based on the above results and recent simulation work from other laboratories, a modified molecular mechanism for the shish-kebab formation in entangled melt is presented...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Nowadays {{plastics}} {{are widely}} spread in our society, {{as reflected in}} a yearly consumption of more than 300 million ton a year. The properties of these plastics such as the strength, stiffness, melting point, gloss [...] . are all strongly dependent on their morphological characteristics. Therefore it shouldn’t be a surprise that studying the solidification process and morphology of polymers has been {{of great interest to}} many research facilities around the globe for decades. Early work in this field by Keller coworkers during the forties and fifties of the previous century demonstrated that, for crystallizable polymers, the long polymeric chains fold into crystalline lamellae. In the beginning of the sixties Hoffman and Lauritzen presented a, by now widely accepted, theory accounting for the formation and growth of such crystals. During the process of crystallization, nucleation is the most critical step and depends on the crystallization conditions such as e. g. the temperature. Due to the emergence of new experimental techniques {{at the turn of the}} last century, the study of polymer crystallization regained interest as observations were made which could not be understood nor explained with the Hoffman & Lauritzen theory. Different authors proposed new crystallization pathways, which quite often involved the interference of a transient mesomorphic phase in the conversion from the liquid to the solid, crystalline <b>state.</b> <b>Mesomorphic</b> phases have characteristics in between the liquid and crystalline states. However, due to the presumed very low volume fraction and short life time of this transient phase it has never been observed directly. In this dissertation we tried to experimentally access this mesomorphic phase as it is assumed to exist for polyethylene. This was attempted by the synthesis and characterization of a special aliphatic polyamide with unusually long methylene sequences, hoping that an ordered melt would be created by hydrogen bonding from which the aliphatic segments could crystallize in a polyethylene like fashion. For these materials it was envisaged that the volume fraction and lifetime of the mesomorphic phase would be expanded. The polymer involved is polyamide 4. 34. Next to investigating PA 4. 34, lipid like model compounds were examined. These model compounds are saturated fatty acid adducts of 1, 4 ‑butanediol and 1, 4 -diaminobutane. The first set of products resembles regular fats for which polymorphism and polymorphic transitions are well documented. In the second set, the ester links of the first set are replaced by amide groups, leading to products that molecularly spoken, strongly resemble PA 4. 34. For these compounds the influence of varying the aliphatic chain length on their thermodynamic properties and crystallization pathways was examined. Chapter 2 reports on the synthesis, thermal behavior and morphology of the di-esters from 1, 4 -butanediol with palmitic (BD 16), stearic (BD 18) or behenic (BD 22) acid. These molecules display monotropic polymorphism. The metastable b’ form is built from outstretched molecules whereas the denser, stable b form is composed of molecules with a kinked conformation. BD 18 and BD 22 crystallize into the b’ form during cooling. Only BD 18 transforms into the b form during subsequent heating via a solid-solid transition. The resistance of BD 22 to convert into the b form is believed to originate from the lack of mobility associated with longer aliphatic chains. In contrast, the polymorphic conversion is thought to be very efficient and to take place during cooling for the shorter BD 16 molecules. The hypothesis is put forward that the original BD 16 b’ nuclei are rapidly overgrown by the b phase by which crystal growth is postponed to larger supercooling where the b phase can grow from the melt. Consequently, BD 16 only occurs in the b form. The melt crystallization of BD 18 and BD 22 into the b’ form hardly requires any supercooling. Adducts of 1, 4 -diaminobutane with palmitic (DA 16), stearic (DA 18) and behenic acid (DA 22) are discussed in chapter 3. All products crystallize into layers composed of hydrogen bonded molecular sheets. The high melting points of these materials as compared to the melting points of the ester based counterparts, are associated with a reduction of the melting entropy due to the preservation of hydrogen bonds in the melt state. Moreover, the low melt entropy is reflected in an observable nanoscale organization of the melt, which appears to facilitate crystal nucleation since crystallization happens during cooling without substantial supercooling for these materials. For all species, enantiotropic polymorphism was observed with the high temperature a phase reversibly converting into the a’ phase upon cooling, essentially by rearrangements of the aliphatic tails. In chapter 4, the synthesis and crystallization behavior of polyamide 4. 34 is presented. Unfortunately, rather than polyethylene like crystallization, still a crystallization into structures commonly seen for polyamides was found. The hydrogen bonds induce sheet formation and their stacking into lamellae. This persistent polyamide like crystallization behavior is most likely due to the long aliphatic moieties still being too short. Using 1, 4 -diaminobutane as central feature, however, seemed to have been a good choice as it induced the desired pre-ordering of the melt, which facilitates crystallization. Ultimately, if this melt ordering would be preserved for even longer aliphatic sequences, it cannot be excluded that polyethylene like crystallization would be triggered over the entire sample volume such that potential mesomorphic precursor phases could be detected.
