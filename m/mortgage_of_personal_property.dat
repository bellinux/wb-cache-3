This was secured by a <b>mortgage</b> <b>of</b> Webster’s <b>personal</b> <b>property,</b> including a cabinet of minerals. In 1848, still in distress, he borrowed $1200 from Robert G. Shaw, making over to him as collateral the minerals that already stood as collateral for a Parkman loan. This enraged Parkman and caused him to seek out Webster for a confrontation.|$|R

5000|$|In the United States, detinue is a {{possessory action}} having for its object the {{recovery}} <b>of</b> specific <b>personal</b> <b>property</b> and damages for its detention. At common law an action of detinue would lie for the recovery <b>of</b> specific <b>personal</b> <b>property</b> unlawfully detained, or its value, and for damages for its detention. Detinue differs from replevin in that {{possession of the}} chattel in controversy is not changed until after the judgment in detinue, whereas in replevin possession is changed {{at the beginning of}} the proceeding. The gist of an action in detinue is that the defendant is wrongfully in possession <b>of</b> <b>personal</b> <b>property</b> which belongs to the plaintiff [...] whereas replevin lies only where there has been a wrongful taking or seizure of the property. Detinue is distinguished from common-law trover which is for the recovery of damages for the wrongful conversion <b>of</b> <b>personal</b> <b>property.</b> In modern practice, detinue has been superseded almost entirely by statutory actions for the recovery <b>of</b> <b>personal</b> <b>property.</b>|$|R
