The grade of <b>grinding</b> <b>wheel</b> is defined as an index which shows the strength of connection of a grain and a grain, and is usually estimated by bending strength. There are many papers about the relationship between the grade of a <b>grinding</b> <b>wheel</b> and the <b>grinding</b> performance.

5000|$|The {{electrochemical}} grinding process combines traditional electrochemical machining and grinding processes to remove material from a workpiece. A <b>grinding</b> <b>wheel</b> {{is used as}} a cutting tool as a cathode and the workpiece is an anode. During the process, electrolytic fluid, typically sodium nitrate, is pumped into the space between the workpiece and the <b>grinding</b> <b>wheel.</b> Other electrolytes used include sodium hydroxide, sodium carbonate, and sodium chlorate. This electrolytic fluid will cause electrochemical reactions to occur at the workpiece surface which oxidize the surface, thereby removing material. As a consequence of the oxidation which occurs, layers of oxide films will form on the workpiece surface, and these need to be removed by the <b>grinding</b> <b>wheel.</b> A couple schematics of the process are provided below.Abrasive materials, either diamond or aluminum oxide, are bonded to the <b>grinding</b> <b>wheel</b> which allows the wheel to remove the oxide layers on the workpiece surface by abrasive action. Appropriate materials used for electrolyte fluid and the <b>grinding</b> <b>wheel</b> abrasives are summarized in the table below.Most material removal is by the electrochemical reactions which occur at the workpiece surface.
