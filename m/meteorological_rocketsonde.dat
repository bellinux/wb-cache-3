40|$|This RTOP {{provides}} for correlative meteorological wind and temperature measurements with atmospheric electrodynamic measurements. <b>Meteorological</b> <b>rocketsondes</b> were launched {{as part of}} a number of electrodynamic investigations in Alaska, Norway, Peru, Sweden, and at the Wallops Flight Facility, Wallops Island, Virginia. Measurements obtained as part of the MAC/Epsilon campaign during October 1987 from Andoya, Norway, were in conjunction with electric field, ion mobility, conductivity, and energy deposition studies. The measurements obtained between 30 and 90 km are to evaluate and correlate changes in the atmospheric electrical structure caused by the neutral wind and temperature, or changes in the neutral atmosphere resulting from electrical anomalies...|$|R
40|$|Following the International Geophysical Year in {{the late}} 1950 's, small {{meteorological}} rockets caught the interest of scientists as a potentially inexpensive method to obtain meteorological information (density, temperature, wind) above balloon-borne radiosonde altitudes. These small rocketsondes have served many important observational roles in terms of studies conducted of atmospheric structure and processes, enabling many new ideas about the atmosphere to emerge. Although no longer manufactured a small residual inventory of <b>meteorological</b> <b>rocketsondes</b> exist for specific research projects. The value of data from <b>meteorological</b> <b>rocketsondes</b> is without question but with their disappearance data from many different satellites are filling the need, some able to resolve high-altitude temperatures quite well. However, the rocketsonde vertical profile is more localized to the launch site whereas satellites move several kilometers per second. The objective of this presentation is to compare in situ temperature data with remotely measured/retrieved temperature data. There {{have been a number}} of U. S. conducted missions utilizing the passive falling sphere data that we use to verify the comparability of retrieved temperatures from these satellites. Missions, some as early as 1991, were conducted in polar, equatorial, and mid-latitude locations. An important aspect is that a single satellite profile compared to a falling sphere profile often does not agree while high density satellite measurements when averaged over an area near the rocketsonde data area seems to be in better agreement. Radiosonde temperature data are used in the analysis when appropriat...|$|R
50|$|A rocketsonde, {{a kind of}} {{sounding}} rocket, is {{a system}} for atmospheric observations that consists of a rocket that launches instruments that can make weather observations up to an altitude of 75,000 m. Common <b>meteorological</b> rockets (<b>rocketsondes)</b> are the Loki and Super Loki.|$|R
40|$|Small <b>meteorological</b> <b>rocketsondes</b> {{providing}} {{temperature data}} have beam used for comparison with, and validation of measurements from satellite-borne instruments. A {{significant number of}} rocket-borne falling spheres were launched {{in conjunction with the}} Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite (UARS) for validation of the Halogen Occultation Experiment (HALOE), High Resolution Doppler Interferometer (HRDI), and the Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS) instruments. Upper stratosphere and mesosphere temperatures measured with these instruments on UARS are compared with inflatable spheres launched from Wallops Island (1992 - 1999), Brazil (1994), Hawaii (1992), Norway (1992), and Sweden (1993 and 1996). Time and space differences varied between the satellite measurement and the rocketsonde launch, for example HALOE overpasses occurred within 5 days and in some cases there were spatial differences of up to 30 degrees longitude. Validation measurements of the HRDI instrument occurred at Wallops Island when it passed within 20 minutes and 330 kilometers of the launch site. Because of discontinuity in the falling sphere drag coefficients when fall speed neared MACH 1 falling sphere temperatures near 70 kilometers attitude are biased toward lower temperatures. Availability of improved software and a new atmospheric model have helped to reduce this bias. The validated remote instrument measurements permit a new perspective of atmospheric structure to be formed, not always possible with the limited number of falling sphere measurements. Features of the remote measurement temperature profiles and their possible use to extend the climatological data base at the rocketsonde sites will be discussed...|$|R
40|$|Between 1958 - 1995 a {{significant}} number of small <b>meteorological</b> <b>rocketsondes</b> were launched by United States (US) agencies from as many as 30 sites to as few as 3 - 4 sites in 1995. Stratospheric temperature trends were derived for many of the sites for the period 1969 - 1995. Similar long-term trends also were derived using rocketsondes launched from sites of the Former Soviet Union (FSU). The advantage of these two particular sets of rocket temperature measurements is {{the internal consistency of the}} data. All measurements were made with the same instrument, i. e., Datasonde in the case of the US sites and the M 100 B in the case of the FSU sites. Data from each instrument type were processed using its unique reduction method. Thus, all data were processed in the same manner including the method of applying corrections (necessary because of thermal heating of the thermistor from the high fall velocities experienced and from radiation effects). Straight-line least squares fit to the data made to monthly-mean measurements gave a downward change of 2 - 3 K per decade. A more complex fitting algorithm would have resulted in finer results but the straight-line fit was adequate for the analysis presented. Trend data are presented for 50 km, 40 km, and 25 km altitude levels. Trends for the US and FSU sites are quite similar. The 25 km (50 -hPa) level data are compared with radiosonde temperatures. Temperature trends over the 25 -year period is different at each of the sites and not always in the same direction...|$|R
