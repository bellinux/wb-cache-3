40|$|Purpose: Mentoring is {{considered}} a valuable component of undergraduate medical education {{with a variety of}} programs at established medical schools. This study presents how new medical schools have set up <b>mentoring</b> <b>programs</b> as they have developed their curricula. Methods: Administrators from 14 US medical schools established since 2006 were surveyed regarding the structure and implementation of their <b>mentoring</b> <b>programs.</b> Results: The majority of new medical schools had <b>mentoring</b> <b>programs</b> that varied in structure and implementation. Although the programs were viewed as valuable at each institution, challenges when creating and implementing <b>mentoring</b> <b>programs</b> in new medical schools included time constraints for faculty and students, and lack of financial and professional incentives for faculty. Conclusions: Similar to established medical schools, there was little uniformity among <b>mentoring</b> <b>programs</b> at new medical schools, likely reflecting differences in curriculum and program goals. Outcome measures are needed to determine whether a best practice for mentoring can be established...|$|R

The grant—shared by MSU, the University of Montana, the state's seven tribal colleges, the state's six two-year colleges, and its three community colleges—permitted the hiring of 12 tenure-track faculty, provided research support for graduate students, established a math and science <b>mentoring</b> <b>program</b> for Native American students, and created a high school-to-college transition assistance program for Native American students.
