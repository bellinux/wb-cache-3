40|$|Abstract — In this paper, a {{finishing}} {{system with}} a <b>mounted</b> abrasive <b>tool</b> is proposed for polishing of metallic molds. The shape of the <b>mounted</b> abrasive <b>tool</b> is a ball-end type. When a metallic mold with curved surface is polished, not only {{the orientation of the}} <b>mounted</b> abrasive <b>tool</b> is fixed but also its revolution is locked. The motion of the <b>mounted</b> abrasive <b>tool</b> is feedforwardly controlled based on an initial trajectory calculated in advance. The surface is polished by the polishing force which consists of a contact force, motion and viscous friction forces acting between the mold and tool. In this case, the velocities in the normal and tangent directions are delicately regulated so that the polishing force can track the desired value. The effectiveness of the proposed system is proved by experiments using an industrial robot with a PC based controller. 1...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} one of the main {{challenges}} the aquaculture industry is facing today: escapes from fish cages.

The use of smaller ROVs is growing in the aquaculture industry and this thesis proposes combining an ROV as an observational platform and a repair platform.

How the <b>tool</b> should be <b>mounted</b> on the ROV depends on the maneuverability of the ROV. Therefore, the degrees of freedom of the chosen ROV is important and addressed in this study.

40|$|A {{new type}} of wave power {{generator}} is beingdeveloped at KTH. This generator has inner stator segmentswhich consist of strong neodymium magnets and electrical steel. These are glued together in stacks with electrical steel separatingeach magnet, and the magnets are oriented with opposingmagnetic fields to the nearest magnet above and below. Inthis configuration, each piece of electrical steel connected tothe {{pole of a magnet}} becomes one pole. 19 magnets and 20 pieces of electrical steel compose one phase of 20 poles, andthree phases are then stacked with glass fibre spacers calledphase blocks, creating an inner stator segment. This projectaimed to design a tool suitable for assembling these strongmagnets into rows and eventually full inner stator segments. To specify the problems and to analyse the different magneticforces present, electromagnetic simulations were made using thesoftware COMSOL Multiphysics. The results showed differentforces between the poles when varying the position of one pole. Based on the results, conclusions were made of how the mountingtool had to function. A design of the <b>mounting</b> <b>tool</b> was thenmade, using the software SolidWorks. The tool was designed toassemble one whole inner stator segment...|$|R
40|$|A simple {{technique}} for high-throughput protein crystallization in ionically cross-linked polysaccharide gel beads {{has been developed}} for contactless handling of crystals in X-ray crystallography. The method is designed to reduce mechanical damage to crystals caused by physical contact between crystal and <b>mount</b> <b>tool</b> and by osmotic shock during various manipulations including cryoprotection, heavy-atom derivatization, ligand soaking, and diffraction experiments. For this study, protein crystallization in alginate and k-carrageenan gel beads was performed using six test proteins, demonstrating that proteins could be successfully crystallized in gel beads. Two complete diffraction data sets from lysozyme and ID 70067 protein crystals in gel beads were collected at 100 K without removing the crystals; {{the results showed that}} the crystals had low mosaicities. In addition, crystallization of glucose isomerase was carried out in alginate gel beads in the presence of synthetic zeolite molecular sieves (MS), a hetero-epitaxic nucleant; the results demonstrated that MS can reduce excess nucleation of this protein in beads. To demonstrate heavy-atom derivatization, lysozyme crystals were successfully derivatized with K 2 PtBr 6 within alginate gel beads.

40|$|A {{fundamental}} problem in human-robot collaboration {{is to ensure}} safety for humans being located in the workspace of the robot. Several new robots, referred to as collaborative robots, are pushing into the market. Most of these so-called co-bots have similar properties. They are small, lightweight and designed with big roundings to ensure safety {{in the case of}} a collision with a human. Equipped with torque sensors, external torque observers, tactile skins, etc., they are able to stop the robot when an emergency occurs. While developing more and more co-bots, the main focus lies on the robot itself. But to make a robot deployable, a special tool for a defined task is needed. These tools are often sharp-edged and dangerous in case of a collision with a human. In this paper we present a new safety module for robots to ensure safety for different tools in collaborative tasks. This module, filled with air pressure during the robot motion, covers <b>mounted</b> <b>tools</b> and carried workpieces. In case of a non or very slow moving robot, the safety module is able to pull back and the tool is uncovered.

Design of prototypes of tool bodies is based on calculations of theoretical number of tool edges. Bodies of milling cutter include holes to <b>mount</b> <b>tool</b> insert holder while two types of insert shape as round and octagonal are used in milling cutter design. Based on measuring of cutting forces when milling planar surfaces, critical cutting conditions leading to the tool damage are identified and they are compared with commercial milling cutters. Applying cutting force data, operation safety is being studied concerning outer appearance of tool failure. Application of Finite Element Method is {{used to assess the}} critical spots leading to the insert holder failure. Maximum stress which brings about ductile fracture of shank style's insert holder has been found out by FEM modelling. Operation capability of tool inserts is compared with tool performance data.

40|$|Process {{reliability}} and dynamic stability {{is a growing}} customer demand in the metal machining industry. A limiting factor in process stability is regenerative vibrations which may damage the machined component, the cutting tool and even the machine tool. Spindle speed optimization to ensure process stability and enable larger cutting depths {{is based on the}} machine tool and cutting tool assembly's frequency response at the tool-tip. The traditional procedure to retrieve the tool-tip frequency response is to conduct dynamic testing of each machine <b>tool</b> <b>mounted</b> cutting <b>tool.</b> This methodology is normally very time-consuming. In an attempt to reduce testing time, receptance coupling substructure analysis (RCSA) has been proposed by a number of researchers. The objective with this approach is to measure the machine tool structure once and then couple a finite element based substructure representation of the cutting tool of interest. The accuracy of the predicted tool-tip frequency response is then dependent on the quality of measured data. This paper details the state-space based sub-structure coupling technique that is used and presents a sensitivity analysis. This analysis distinguishes key considerations for the machine tool component test and it quantifies the parameter influence on the process stability predictions of the coupled system...|$|R
