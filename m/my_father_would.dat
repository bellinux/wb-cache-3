Fiasco is of West African descent, {{one of nine}} {{children}} of Shirley, a gourmet chef, and Gregory, an engineer. His father, {{a member of the}} Black Panther Party, was a prolific African drummer, karate teacher, operating plant engineer, and owner of karate schools and army surplus stores. Fiasco was raised Muslim on the West Side of Chicago on Madison Terrace housing project. [...] At the age of three, Fiasco began taking martial arts classes. His parents divorced when he was five, and he went on to live with his mother, but his father still remained an important part of his life. He described his father's influence over the family by saying, [...] "After school, <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>would</b> come and get us and take us out into the world—one day, we're listening to N.W.A, the next day we're listening to Ravi Shankar, the next day, he's teaching us how to shoot an AK-47, the next day, we're at karate class, the next day, we're in Chinatown...".|$|E
500|$|According to Ranaut, she was [...] "stubborn and rebellious" [...] {{while growing}} up: [...] "If <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>would</b> gift my brother a plastic gun {{and get a}} doll for me, I would not accept that. I {{questioned}} the discrimination." [...] She did not subscribe to the stereotypes that were expected of her and experimented with fashion from a young age, often pairing up accessories and clothes that would seem [...] "bizarre" [...] to her neighbours. Ranaut was educated at the DAV School in Chandigarh, where she pursued science as her core subject, remarking that she was [...] "very studious" [...] and [...] "always paranoid about [...] results". She initially intended {{to become a doctor}} on the insistence of her parents. However, a failed unit test in chemistry during her twelfth grade led Ranaut to reconsider her career prospects and despite preparing for the All India Pre Medical Test, she did not turn up for the exam. Determined to find her [...] "space and freedom", she relocated to Delhi at the age of sixteen. Her decision not to pursue medicine led to constant feuding with her parents and her father refused to sponsor a pursuit he considered to be aimless.|$|E

500|$|In late August, Augusta Saint-Gaudens sent {{new models}} for the eagle to Acting Director Preston. [...] When Barber {{examined}} them, he noted, [...] "dies made from these models {{would be a great}} improvement over those already made" [...] and stated that with these models, the Mint could have the eagle in full production within a month. [...] Homer Saint-Gaudens, the sculptor's son, wrote to Preston, [...] "Mr. Hering has finally finished the eagle at a relief slightly lower than that on the French [...] coin by Chaplin, [...] which is the lowest relief that Mr. Hering knew <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>would</b> abide by, and which I understand Mr. Barber can mint." [...] In the meantime, Cortelyou ordered 500 pieces struck on the Mint's high-pressure medal press from the dies the Mint had from Saint-Gaudens's earlier efforts, thus complying with the letter of the President's August 7 order. [...] Preston sent a note to Norris, warning that the President would likely order 100pieces and suggesting that he have the coins available [...] "so you can furnish them without a moment's delay". [...] According to numismatic historian Roger Burdette, [...] "these were an 'insurance policy', put in place by Cortelyou against additional presidential rage". [...] The President viewed sample eagle coins on August 31, and expressed his satisfaction with them and his desire to see more struck.|$|E
2500|$|In {{a speech}} at the 1999 Berlin Film Festival, Zimmer stated that he is Jewish, and talked about his mother {{surviving}} the war thanks to her escape from Germany to England in 1939. In an interview with Mashable in February 2013, he said of his parents [...] "My mother was very musical, basically a musician and my father was an engineer and an inventor. So, I grew up modifying the piano, shall we say, which made my mother gasp in horror, and <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>would</b> think it was fantastic when I would attach chainsaws and stuff like that to the piano because he thought it was an evolution in technology." [...] In an interview with the German television station ZDF in 2006, he commented: [...] "My father died when I was just a child, and I escaped somehow into the music and music has been my best friend." ...|$|E
2500|$|In a {{detailed}} review of four sittings done by medium Tyler Henry, Edward and Susan Gerbic reviewed all the statements on the TV show Hollywood Medium. In their opinion not one statement made by Henry was accurate, yet each sitter {{felt that the}} reading was very successful. In after interviews with each sitter all four claimed that Henry had made specific statements, but after reviewing the show it showed that he had not. Each sitter misremembered the statement. One of many examples of this was when Henry during a session with celebrity Ross Matthews stated [...] "Bambi, why am I connecting to Bambi"? Matthews stated that his father who was a hunter would not shoot deer because of the movie Bambi. In the post interview, Matthews stated that [...] "it was weird that Henry knew that <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>would</b> not shoot deer because of Bambi", when {{that is not what}} was said, Matthews had misremembered what Henry had said.|$|E

2500|$|In contrast, law {{enforcement}} officials such as Spencer Lawton, the former Chatham County prosecutor who put Davis on trial, remained convinced of the evidence for Davis's guilt and that Davis's supporters [...] "would know differently if {{they looked at the}} record." [...] He stated: [...] "We have consistently won the case as it has been presented in court. We have consistently lost the case as it has been presented in the public realm, on TV and elsewhere." [...] Members of MacPhail's family were also convinced of Davis's guilt, and thought his execution would bring a measure of peace. His mother reported [...] "That hole in my heart will be there until the day I die, but it [...] may give me some peace and quiet." [...] Mark MacPhail, Jr. stated [...] "It's not animosity or anger or rage that has kept us going; that's not what <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>would</b> want. It's justice. The law is what he was all about. That's what we have to uphold." ...|$|E
2500|$|A {{series of}} orchestral works {{originally}} composed for {{the concert hall}} commenced with the 3-movement Violin Concerto No. 1 (1987). This work was commissioned by the American Composers Orchestra and written for and in close collaboration with the violinist Paul Zukofsky and the conductor Dennis Russel Davies, who since then has encouraged the composer to write numerous orchestral pieces. The Concerto {{is dedicated to the}} memory of Glass's father: [...] "His favorite form was the violin concerto, and so I grew up listening to the Mendelssohn, the Paganini, the Brahms concertos. (...) So when I decided to write a violin concerto, I wanted to write one that <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>would</b> have liked." [...] Among its multiple recordings, in 1992, the Concerto was performed and recorded by Gidon Kremer and the Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra. This turn to orchestral music was continued with a symphonic trilogy of [...] "portraits of nature", commissioned by the Cleveland Orchestra, the Rotterdam Philharmonic Orchestra, and the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra: The Light (1987), The Canyon (1988), and Itaipu (1989).|$|E
2500|$|The {{property}} behind Stimson House (on Chester Place) was {{the home}} of Carrie Estelle Doheny, the widow of wealthy oil man, Edward L. Doheny. [...] Mrs. Doheny {{had grown up in}} the neighborhood and had watched as the Stimson House was built. [...] She recalled, [...] "I remember when Mr. Stimson was building this house. [...] When I was just a little girl, <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>would</b> take me for a walk on Sunday afternoons, and we’d always walk this way to see how far along the work had progressed." [...] For eight years from 1940 to 1948, Mrs. Doheny lived behind the fraternity, and the boisterous parties in the house’s dungeon-like [...] "catacombs" [...] were an ongoing source of annoyance. [...] Mrs. Doheny repeatedly complained to the university president, Rufus B. Von Kleinsmid, about disturbances, a former house president recalling that he was called before Kleinsmid [...] "once a month or so" [...] {{as a result of her}} complaints. [...] By 1948, Mrs. Doheny had dealt with the fraternity for long enough and offered $75,000 to purchase the house that the fraternity bought eight years earlier for $20,000. [...] The fraternity house was already struggling with the cost of maintaining the large house and accepted Mrs. Doheny’s offer. [...] After the sale closed, Mrs. Doheny assured herself that she would have no further problems with noisy neighbors by deeding Stimson House to the Sisters of St. Joseph of Carondelet for use as a convent. [...] At the time, the Los Angeles Times noted: [...] "The parlor where merry parties reveled at the turn of the century will become a chapel where reverent nuns will now bow in humble devotion. [...] The gay conversation of the festive past will yield place to solemn intonations of morning prayers." ...|$|E

2500|$|Rich's {{destructive}} personal behavior famously culminated at the CMA {{awards ceremony}} for 1975, when he presented {{the award for}} Entertainer of the Year, while visibly intoxicated. After stumbling through {{the names of the}} nominees, Rich clumsily tore open the envelope, took out a cigarette lighter, and lit the paper on fire with the winner's name. While the paper burned, he announced that the winner of the award was [...] "My friend Mr. John Denver." [...] Some considered it an act of rebellion against the Music Row-controlled Nashville Sound. But many speculated that Rich's behavior was a protest against the award going to Denver, whose music Rich had considered too [...] "pop" [...] and not enough [...] "country". Others, including industry insiders, were outraged, and Rich had trouble having hits throughout 1976, and only had one top-ten with [...] "Since I Fell For You". In a 2016 interview, former CMA Executive Director Jo Walker-Meador speculated that Rich's drunkenness may have been in part due to resentment over his being shut out of the nominations that year, after his success at the 1974 awards. His son Charlie, Jr., says on his website: [...] "...why did he do it? I'll tell you why I thought he did it. #1 He thought it would be funny. He set it up by talking about how the potential winners were probably nervous, as he had been the previous year. #2 Bad judgement. He had recently broken his foot in a freak accident at his home in Memphis. It sounds funny, but he got his foot caught in an awkward position while getting out of a reclining chair. He cracked several bones in his foot. So...Due to the pain, he took pain medication the night of the show: Bad idea! Secondly, he and another country star got to drinking gin and tonics while waiting in the dressing room. The show was long, so by the time Dad was supposed to go on, the drinks on top of the medication got him buzzed. So, there ya' go. That's why I think he did it. Primarily {{he thought it would be}} funny. I know the last thing <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>would</b> have wanted to do was set himself up as judge of another musician. He felt badly that people thought it was a statement against John Denver." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That is a {{very good}} idea," [...] she said, [...] "only I have no one to take me to him, since <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>would</b> not allow me to go with Saduko, his ward."
