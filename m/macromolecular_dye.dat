50|$|Paramasivam Natarajan (1940-2016) was an Indian photochemist, the INSA Senior Scientist at the National Centre for Ultrafast Process of the University of Madras and the Director of Central Salt and Marine Chemicals Research Institute (CSMCRI) of the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research. He {{was known}} for his {{researches}} on photochemistry of co-ordination compounds and <b>macromolecular</b> <b>dye</b> coatings for stabilization of electrodes and was an elected fellow of the Indian National Science Academy, International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry and the Indian Academy of Sciences. The Council of Scientific and Industrial Research, the apex agency of the Government of India for scientific research, awarded him the Shanti Swarup Bhatnagar Prize for Science and Technology, one of the highest Indian science awards, in 1984, for his contributions to chemical sciences.|$|E
40|$|Antifertility {{effects of}} {{prostaglandin}} F 2 =a {{been described in}} rats, hamsters, rabbits and monkeys (see Duncan & Pharriss, 1970, for references). However, {{it is not known}} {{whether or not they are}} due to inhibition of implantation. In rats, hamsters and perhaps other species, a localized increase in vascular permeability to macromolecules occurs at the site of blastocyst=m- (Psychoyos, 1966). In view of the fact that oedematous changes are known to occur at the site of implantation (Finn & McLaren, 1967) the vascular changes may include increase in vasodilation. The increased permeability and associated vascular changes can be demonstrated by intravenous injection of a <b>macromolecular</b> <b>dye</b> (e. g. Pontamine blue) and constitute one of the earliest signs of implantation (Finn & McLaren, 1967). Since part of the blood supply to the ovaries and uterus is derived from a common source and since F 2 =a been reported to limit blood flow from the ovaries by causing constriction of veins (Pharriss, 1970), it is conceivable that the prostaglandin could similarly restrict blood flow from the uterus and that the resulting vascular stasis could lead to inhibition of implantation. This consideration prompted us t...|$|E
40|$|Well defined {{amphiphilic}} Y-shaped miktoarm star-block copolymers of PEO and PCL were synthesized by ring-opening polymerization of epsilon-caprolactone {{initiated by}} a PEO-bound lysine macroinitiator. The copolymers {{were characterized by}} 1 H-NMR, SEC, DSC and WAXD techniques. Separate PCL and PEO crystalline phases occur in melt crystallized copolymers when their segmental lengths were comparable and the PCL content was around 80 wt%. Self-assembling of these copolymers in aqueous medium led to nanoaggregates with low critical aggregation concentration values (0. 35 - 1. 6 mg/L- 1) and size depending on composition. Despite the copolymers were not prone to self-organize in vesicles, once processed by a novel w/o emulsion-melting-sonication technique they gave nanocapsules with a water core and a hydrophilic surface. A <b>macromolecular</b> fluorescent <b>dye</b> was effectively loaded and released at sustained rate by optimizing nanocapsule formulation. The results demonstrate that amphiphilic block copolymers can be assembled in different kind of nanomorphologies independently of their hydrophilic/hydrophobic balance and architecture through specifically designed preparation techniques...|$|R
40|$|Proof of {{principle}} for local drug delivery with Acoustic Cluster Therapy (ACT) was demonstrated {{in a human}} prostate adenocarcinoma growing in athymic mice, using near infrared (NIR) dyes as model molecules. A dispersion of negatively charged microbubble/positively charged microdroplet clusters are injected i. v., activated within the target pathology by diagnostic ultrasound (US), undergo an ensuing liquid-to-gas phase shift and transiently deposit 20 – 30 μm large bubbles in the microvasculature, occluding blood flow for ~ 5 – 10 min. Further application of low frequency US induces biomechanical effects that increase the vascular permeability, leading to a locally enhanced extravasation of components from the vascular compartment (e. g., released or co-administered drugs). Results demonstrated deposition of activated bubbles in tumor vasculature. Following ACT treatment, a significant and tumor specific increase in the uptake of a co-administered <b>macromolecular</b> NIR <b>dye</b> was shown. In addition, ACT compound loaded with a lipophilic NIR dye to the microdroplet component was shown to facilitate local release and tumor specific uptake. Whereas the mechanisms behind the observed increased and tumor specific uptake are not fully elucidated, it is demonstrated that the ACT concept can be applied as a versatile technique for targeted drug delivery...|$|R
