500|$|A self-confessed 'dreamer' with {{a romantic}} sensibility, Skirth was {{very fond of}} literature, and in {{particular}} poetry; he took {{with him to the}} Western Front a much-annotated copy of Francis Turner Palgrave's Golden Treasury.

500|$|Klepacki {{has said}} that the most {{rewarding}} part of composing video game music is working with a team—which he compares to chemistry between band members—and knowing he is part of a greater cause. He believes that game music could improve if artists focused on quality and derived inspiration from playing games. He has expressed interest in having Electronic Arts sell his soundtracks in retail stores, preferably next to video games in electronic departments. He advises those wishing to get in the video game business to attend conventions and investigate developer companies. He also noted in 2008 that [...] "composition and engineering skills are now required," [...] advising upstart composers to ensure their work is film-quality. Klepacki is happy to see older games offered on the Wii, hoping that gamers are [...] "recognizing once again that simple, short fun experiences are just as good as...long, huge-production experiences." [...] Klepacki listed several influences for his style of composition: [...] "John Williams naturally for <b>my</b> <b>love</b> <b>of</b> Star Wars and his style in general, Michael Kamen for his composing diversity, Metallica for sparking my metal influence, Vince Dicola who in my opinion is way under-rated for his great work, Sly & The Family Stone for inspiring funk, syncopation, and positive energy, Larry Graham for inspiring me to play funk bass, Nine Inch Nails for their unique uses of mangled sound, and Rob Zombie for combining music with a theme and persona." ...|$|E

2500|$|Mohanlal {{had acted}} in several amateur plays before {{entering}} into films. In 2001, he debuted in professional drama playing Karna (a character from the Indian epic Mahabharata) in Karnabharam, a Sanskrit-language play directed by Kavalam Narayana Panicker. It premiered at the Siri Fort Auditorium in New Delhi on 29 March 2001 {{as part of}} the National Theatre Festival of National School of Drama. The play depicts Karna's mental agony a day before the Kurukshetra War, as he thinks about his past and his faith. Mohanlal said, [...] "You cannot compare Kavalam's play with the amateur plays I did. Though there are other characters in the play, the theme revolves around Karna. It is almost like a solo performance. Some of the scenes are really touching and challenging". He acted without payment, saying [...] "I performed for the joy of it ... for <b>my</b> <b>love</b> <b>of</b> our history".|$|E
2500|$|Amid {{the sudden}} {{cancellation}} of her UPN sitcom Moesha, Norwood suffered {{a nervous breakdown}} in November 1999 — the result of her then-hectic and unhealthy lifestyle and a failed relationship {{in which she had}} experienced verbal abuse. Frightened by the idea that a yet-to-be-made third album she {{would not be able to}} live up to the success of her previous albums, Norwood went on a lengthy hiatus to reflect and take some introspective looks. [...] "I needed to rejuvenate, get my creative juices flowing, balance my life with some privacy, to find my confidence, find <b>my</b> <b>love</b> <b>of</b> music again," [...] she told Jet magazine in 2002. In mid-2000, she started refocused herself on her musical career, contributing songs to albums such as Urban Renewal (2001) and the Osmosis Jones soundtrack (2001), which introduced a scratchy, evocative edge to Norwood's voice, now having a deeper and warmer tone with a textured lower register and notably stronger falsetto.|$|E
2500|$|Following {{the release}} of several remixes of her songs by Steve [...] "Silk" [...] Hurley, Minogue became {{interested}} in dance music. She commented that the remixes were [...] "the first thing I did that was really cool and <b>my</b> <b>love</b> <b>of</b> dance music and clubbing started from there." [...] Minogue's interest in dance music and clubbing influenced her third album, Girl, released in September 1997, which featured collaborations with musicians such as Brian Higgins of Xenomania. The album presented a more sophisticated and adult style of dance music, but despite generally positive reviews, {{failed to make the}} British top 50. The lead single [...] "All I Wanna Do", which the Daily Mirror described as a [...] "bass-bumping, shuddering return", was a success peaking at number four on the UK singles chart. In her native Australia, the single also proved to be a success peaking at number eleven and was certified gold. The album's second single [...] "Everything I Wanted" [...] made the top 20 in the UK and the top 50 in Australia, while the third single [...] "Disremembrance" [...] narrowly missed the top 20 in the UK, peaking at number 21. All three singles released from Girl reached number one on the UK dance chart.|$|E
