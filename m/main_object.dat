25|$|Main hall is {{the term}} used in English for the {{building}} within a Japanese Buddhist temple compound (garan) which enshrines the <b>main</b> <b>object</b> of veneration. Because the various denominations deliberately use different terms, this single English term translates several Japanese words, among them Butsuden, Butsu-dō, kondō, konpon-chūdō, and hondō. Hondō is its exact Japanese equivalent, while the others are more specialized words used by particular sects or for edifices having a particular structure.|$|E

25|$|Failing {{in their}} siege {{artillery}} capacity the Persian sent sappers to dig underground {{to reach the}} citadels walls from beneath but the Turks received timely intelligence reports revealing {{the intention of the}} besiegers. Tunnelling underground the Persians and Ottomans burrowed into each other's way whence they came to grips in hand-to-hand combat. The Persians were able to detonate six charges killing 700 Ottoman defenders but still failed in their <b>main</b> <b>object</b> of destroying the citadels walls. The Persians also lost some 30 to 40 men themselves.|$|E

With Üsküb Infantry Division and Monastir Infantry Division already retreating, the battle was resolved. At 15:00, Morava Division I entered Kumanovo.|$|E

On the two sides stand the statues of gods Bonten (Brahma) and Taishakuten (Indra), both made during the Nanboku-chō period and both prefectural Important Cultural Properties. There are also the statues of the Ten Deva Kings, of Enma, lord of the Beyond, and a sitting statue of the temple's founder Enkan.

500|$|The Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition (1914–17), {{also known}} as the Endurance Expedition, is {{considered}} the last major expedition of the Heroic Age of Antarctic Exploration. [...] Conceived by Sir Ernest Shackleton, the expedition was an attempt to make the first land crossing of the Antarctic continent. After the conquest of the South Pole by Roald Amundsen in 1911, this crossing [...] remained, in Shackleton's words, the [...] "one great <b>main</b> <b>object</b> of Antarctic journeyings". The expedition failed to accomplish this objective, but became recognised instead as an epic feat of endurance.|$|E

30|$|We plot the perturbed pixels of {{successful}} attacks {{to show that}} their location on the images, which are shown in Fig. 9 in the Appendix, for four types of networks and two DE settings: 0.5 / 0.1 / 0.1 and 0.1 / 0.1 / 0.1. The attacks are conducted on 500 CIFAR- 10 and 150 ImageNet images. Generally, {{we find that the}} perturbed pixels are more rare at the edges while quite dense {{in the middle of the}} images. Assuming that the <b>main</b> <b>objects</b> (e.g., the cat in the image labeled as “cat”) mostly appear in the middle of the images, it is interesting to notice that the plots indicate that the perturbations are most conducted on the <b>main</b> <b>objects</b> but not the background. In other words, the proposed attack always tries to alter the existing objects in the images but not modifies the background to make the classifier ignore the <b>main</b> <b>objects,</b> to cause the misclassification.|$|R

500|$|The Canadian government's {{financial}} involvement {{represented a}} shift in the expedition's emphasis, towards geographical exploration rather than the original purpose of ethnological and scientific studies. In a letter to the Canadian Victoria Daily Times, Stefansson set out these separate aims. The <b>main</b> <b>object</b> was to explore the [...] "area of a million or so square miles that is represented by white patches on our map, lying between Alaska and the North Pole". The expedition also aimed to be the most comprehensive scientific study of the Arctic ever attempted. While a Northern Party searched for new lands, a mainly land-based Southern Party under zoologist Rudolph Anderson would carry out surveys and anthropological studies in the islands off the northern Canadian coast.|$|E
500|$|It was Martin Leake's {{opinion that}} the trouble and {{opposition}} Anstis met with in establishing himself as Garter so embittered him against the heralds that when at last in 1718 he succeeded, he made it his prime object to aggrandise himself and his office at their expense. It is clear at least that {{he set out to}} make himself indispensable to the Earl Marshal, which was not hard, their political principles being congruous and their friendship already established, but also to Sir Robert Walpole and the Whig ministry, which can by no means have been easy, considering his known attachment to the Pretender and the circumstances under which he came into office ... The <b>main</b> <b>object</b> of Anstis's next move, the revival or institution of the Order of the Bath was probably that which it in fact secured, of ingratiating him with the all-powerful Prime Minister Sir Robert Walpole.|$|E
500|$|With {{the growth}} of the {{doctrine}} of parliamentary sovereignty, Coke's theory gradually died out; William Blackstone, in the first edition of his Commentaries on the Laws of England, wrote that [...] "if the parliament will positively enact a thing to be done which is unreasonable, I know of no power that can control it: and the examples alleged in support of this sense of the rule do none of them prove, that where the <b>main</b> <b>object</b> of a statute is unreasonable the judges are at liberty to reject it; for that were to set the judicial power above that of the legislature, which would be subversive of all government". Parliamentary sovereignty is now upheld by the English judiciary as a [...] "central principle of British constitutionalism" [...] despite with some issues by membership in the European Union. The case's modern irrelevance is such that Philip Hamburger wrote in 2008, [...] "Bonham's Case scarcely deserves mention in a history of judicial duty, except for reasons that are now largely forgotten".|$|E

500|$|Peking opera stages have {{traditionally}} been square platforms. The action on stage is usually visible from at least three sides. The stage {{is divided into two}} parts by an embroidered curtain called a shoujiu. Musicians are visible to the audience on the front part of the stage. Traditional Peking opera stages were built above the line of sight of the viewers, but some modern stages have been constructed with higher audience seating. Viewers are always seated south of the stage. Therefore, north is the most important direction in Peking opera, and performers will immediately move to [...] "center north" [...] upon entering the stage. All characters enter from the east and exit from the west. In line with the highly symbolic nature of Peking opera, the form uses very few props. This reflects seven centuries of Chinese performance tradition. The presence of large objects is frequently indicated through conventions. The stage will almost always have a table and at least one chair, which can be turned through convention into such diverse objects as a city wall, a mountain, or a bed. Peripheral objects will often be used to signify the presence of a larger, <b>main</b> <b>object.</b> For example, a whip is used to indicate a horse and an oar symbolizes a boat.|$|E
500|$|The {{change to}} a new genre {{presented}} multiple challenges to the team: while standard RPGs were designed around a scripted experience, MMORPGs were more reliant on a true sense of unscripted adventure. A major disadvantage was that Fujisawa was inexperienced with working on MMORPGs. The first major developmental issue was the need in an MMORPG {{to have a full}} customizable character. Another related problem was the initial premise of an unseen force as the threat, which was unusual within the form. Fujisawa rationalized it into a kind of [...] "common sense" [...] related to the interaction between player community and necessary events within the game world that worked against accepted principles of MMORPG gameplay, which resulted in multiple staff members raising doubts as to whether the game could work. The second major issue was what types of environments to include or discard, and for this Fujisawa was prepared due to his long experience with the franchise. On top of this, the staff needed to evaluate what would work for an MMORPG in the unpredictable Japanese gaming market, which unlike {{other parts of the world}} was not a major consumer of MMORPGs. Their <b>main</b> <b>object</b> for comparison was World of Warcraft, which by that time had 12 million players worldwide but only had a small holding in Japan. While this appeared discouraging, there had not been many titles of similar scale and success within the country, so there was both space for and detractions against an equivalent MMORPG experience.|$|E
