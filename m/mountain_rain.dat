2500|$|The Keglsugl route {{involves}} {{climbing up}} {{and through a}} <b>mountain</b> <b>rain</b> forest and then along an alpine grassland glacial valley to the twin lakes of Piunde and Aunde. [...] At Piunde there are two huts, one being an old Australian National University monitoring station and the other an 'A-Frame' hut. Though not a technical climb, various sections can be treacherous in wet weather. [...] The climb is usually started during the night; the ascent and subsequent descent can take anywhere from nine to 24 hours. Reaching the peak at dawn allows {{a better chance of}} clear weather.|$|E

50|$|About 200 {{million years}} ago on the place of stone pillars were high <b>mountains.</b> <b>Rain,</b> snow, wind, frost and heat {{gradually}} destroyed mountains and, in the first place, weak rocks. Solid sericite-quartzite schists, from which the remains are composed, were destroyed less and survived to this day, and soft rocks were destroyed by weathering and carried down by water and wind in relief depressions.|$|R
2500|$|The {{fruit for}} singani is {{produced}} in the Andes mountains at elevations from 5,250 up to 9,200 feet above sea level. [...] For example, the vineyards at San Juan del Oro in Tarija are at 8,850 feet amsl. [...] The largest vineyards are located at around 6,000 feet, however, due to logistical difficulties at higher elevations. [...] Given the proximity to the equator, thermoclines are higher, with a lower probability of freezing even on winter nights. [...] The structure of surrounding mountain peaks protects growing regions from seasonal cold fronts (surazos) and hailstorms that can damage plants. [...] Mountain air tends to be thin, cold and dry, yet solar radiation is stronger, passing through both warming radiation and intense ultraviolet light. [...] Due {{to the fact that}} mountain air cannot hold heat well, grapevines experience dramatic daily air temperature fluctuations. [...] Studies of altitude vineyards by CENAVIT and other organizations suggest that fruit subject to these conditions tends to produce greater concentrations of monoterpene aromatics held in a free state rather than sequestered as oils. [...] This is important as oils do not survive the distillation process. [...] The soil is fluvial erosion from surrounding peaks, well structured deep clay and sandy loam with good pitch and permeability. [...] Water is derived from snow melt and <b>mountain</b> <b>rain</b> directly from the adjacent peaks of Iscayachi. [...] Because land in the mountains is mostly vertical, acreage for singani tends to be microclimate mini-plots, one of the reasons hand-cultivation is preferred over difficult-to-deploy agricultural machinery.|$|E
60|$|The {{season was}} too early for high passes, and the weather was changeable. They started from Fribourg and walked to Thun {{and then back to}} Bulle, and so to Bultigen, Saanen, Montbovon and the Lake of Geneva. They had rain several days, the sweet, soft, windless <b>mountain</b> <b>rain</b> that seemed so {{tolerable}} to those who are accustomed to the hard and driven downpours of England, and in places they found mud and receding snow; the inns were at their homeliest, and none the worse for that, and there were days of spring sunshine when a multitude of minute and delightful flowers came out as it seemed to meet them--it was impossible to suppose so great a concourse universal--and spread in a scented carpet before their straying feet. The fruit trees in the valleys were powdered with blossom, and the new grass seemed rather green-tinted sunlight than merely green. And they walked with a sort of stout leisureliness, knapsacks well-hung and cloaks about them, with their faces fresh and bright under the bracing weather, and their lungs deep charged with mountain air, talking of the new austerer life that was now beginning. With great snow-capped mountains in the background, streaming precipices overhead, and a sward of flowers to go upon, that strenuous prospect was altogether delightful. They went as it pleased them, making detours into valleys, coming back upon their steps. The interludes of hot, bright April sunshine made them indolent, and they would loiter and halt where some rock or wall invited, and sit basking like happy, animals, talking very little, for long hours together. Trafford seemed to have forgotten all the strain and disappointment of the past two years, to be amazed but in no wise incredulous at this enormous change in her and in their outlook; it filled her with a passion of pride and high resolve to think that so she could recover and uplift him.|$|E

25|$|Records {{show that}} Valle Piola {{has always had}} but one street, Via della Fauna, {{which leads to the}} nearby village of Poggio Valle. Smaller paths, {{including}} a mule trail, have connected Valle Piola with Acquaratola (a hike of approximately 40 minutes by foot), the town cemetery, and Case Menghini. In the past, a carriageway provided a shortcut from Case Menghini to the Valle Piola cemetery. Frequently, heavy <b>mountain</b> <b>rains</b> made Via della Fauna impassable. In the 1950s a rudimentary bridge was constructed over the Rio de Valle thereby, largely eliminating the effects of this bothersome natural event.|$|R

50|$|The Valley is {{the northwestern}} {{extension}} of the Sonoran Desert to the southeast, and as such, is extremely arid. Most precipitation falls {{during the winter months}} from passing mid-latitude frontal systems from the north and west, nearly all of it as rain, but with snow atop the surrounding <b>mountains.</b> <b>Rain</b> also falls during the summer months as surges of moisture from both the Gulf of Mexico and the Gulf of California are drawn into the area by the desert monsoon. Occasionally, the remnants of a Pacific tropical cyclone can also affect the valley. In 1976, Tropical Storm Kathleen brought torrential rain and catastrophic flooding to the Coachella Valley as it swept in from the Pacific, traversing the region from south to north.|$|R
