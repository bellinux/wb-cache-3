5|$|As the company's only engineer, Bristow rapidly {{developed}} a prototype himself before turning the game over to new hire Lyle Rains {{to develop into}} a finished product, codenamed K2 Tank. Rains added the maze and central minefield to the game design and developed the final hardware, including the simple control scheme. Peter Takaichi designed a large custom cabinet to house it. Tank {{was one of the}} first games to use integrated circuit-based memory—specifically, <b>mask</b> <b>ROM</b> (read-only memory)—to store graphical data, rather than the diode arrays that previous arcade games used; it is sometimes claimed in sources to be the very first, but was preceded at minimum by Atari's Gran Trak 10 (1974). Integrated circuit-based memory thereafter became the standard for arcade and console video games. Before the game could be completed, in September 1974 Atari announced plans to merge itself and Kee Games back together; Tank was released that November just prior to the merger in December 1974.|$|E
5|$|In {{the fall}} of 1973, Atari began work on a driving game, an idea founder Nolan Bushnell had wanted to do since the company was {{initially}} founded in June 1972 before it was shelved in favor of Pong. The design work itself was handled by Cyan Engineering, which had recently become a semi-independent research and development subsidiary of Atari and had previously handled the prototype design of Gotcha. Larry Emmons developed the circuits to control the car itself in the game, creating the feel of braking, acceleration, and movement. Emmons also used integrated circuit-based memory—specifically, <b>mask</b> <b>ROM</b> (read-only memory)— in his circuit design to store graphical data such as the tracks, rather than the diode arrays that previous arcade games used. This {{is believed to be}} the first use of integrated circuit-based memory in an arcade game, and ROMs thereafter became the standard for arcade and console video games. The mechanical designs for the game, including the steering wheel, pedal, and gear shift controllers, were developed by Eigen Systems, located in the same building as Cyan and founded by ex-coworkers of the Cyan founders Emmons and Steven Mayer. At one point, the game's design included a small printer that would print high scores when achieved, but this was removed prior to the final design.|$|E

50|$|For mask-programmed devices (e.g. gate arrays, mask-programmed single chip microcontrollers, <b>Mask</b> <b>ROMs)</b> a {{three or}} four digit mask number follows the type {{designation}} (e.g. К1801ВП1-014).|$|R
5000|$|Optical storage media, such CD-ROM {{which is}} {{read-only}} (analogous to <b>masked</b> <b>ROM).</b> CD-R is Write Once Read Many (analogous to PROM), while CD-RW supports erase-rewrite cycles (analogous to EEPROM); both {{are designed for}} backwards-compatibility with CD-ROM.|$|R
50|$|The Hitachi 6301 {{processor}} is {{an enhanced}} development {{based on the}} Motorola 6801 implemented in CMOS, {{with a number of}} extra instructions, various hardware system-on-single chip facilities on-chip, power management and support for a sleep state. The particular variant chosen also had 4 KiB of <b>masked</b> <b>ROM</b> on-chip, so an external ROM was not needed on the board.|$|R
50|$|Some {{integrated}} circuits contain only <b>mask</b> <b>ROM.</b> Other {{integrated circuits}} contain <b>mask</b> <b>ROM</b> {{as well as}} a variety of other devices. In particular, many microprocessors have <b>mask</b> <b>ROM</b> to store their microcode. Some microcontrollers have <b>mask</b> <b>ROM</b> to store the bootloader or all of their firmware.|$|E
50|$|The main {{advantage}} of <b>mask</b> <b>ROM</b> is its cost. Per bit, <b>mask</b> <b>ROM</b> is more compact {{than any other}} kind of semiconductor memory. Since the cost of an integrated circuit strongly depends on its size, <b>mask</b> <b>ROM</b> is significantly cheaper than {{any other kind of}} semiconductor memory.|$|E
50|$|All {{of these}} {{technologies}} improved {{the flexibility of}} ROM, but at a significant cost-per-chip, so that in large quantities <b>mask</b> <b>ROM</b> would remain an economical choice for many years. (Decreasing cost of reprogrammable devices had almost eliminated the market for <b>mask</b> <b>ROM</b> by the year 2000.) Rewriteable technologies were envisioned as replacements for <b>mask</b> <b>ROM.</b>|$|E
50|$|Electrically {{addressed}} semiconductor non-volatile memories can {{be categorized}} according to their write mechanism. <b>Mask</b> <b>ROMs</b> are factory programmable only, and typically used for large-volume products not required to be updated after manufacture. Programmable read-only memory can be altered after manufacture, but require a special programmer and usually cannot be programmed while in the target system. The programming is permanent and further changes require replacement of the device. Data is stored by physically altering (burning) storage sites in the device.|$|R
50|$|The {{timespan}} {{over which}} a ROM remains accurately readable {{is not limited}} by write cycling. The data retention of EPROM, EAROM, EEPROM, and Flash may be limited by charge leaking from the floating gates of the memory cell transistors. Leakage is accelerated by high temperatures or radiation. <b>Masked</b> <b>ROM</b> and fuse/antifuse PROM do not suffer from this effect, as their data retention depends on physical rather than electrical permanence of the integrated circuit, although fuse re-growth was once a problem in some systems.|$|R
50|$|The 8049 has 2 kB of <b>masked</b> <b>ROM</b> {{as well as}} 128 bytes of RAM and 27 I/O ports. The µC's {{oscillator}} block {{divides the}} incoming clock into 15 internal phases, thus with its 11 MHz max. crystal, one gets 0.73 MIPS (of one-clock instructions). Some 70% of instructions are single byte/cycle, but 30% need two cycles and/or two bytes, so raw performance is closer to 0.5 MIPS. The minimum instruction length is 8 bits and the maximum instruction length is 16 bits.|$|R
50|$|It {{is common}} {{practice}} to use rewritable non-volatile memory - such as UV-EPROM or EEPROM - {{for the development}} phase of a project, and to switch to <b>mask</b> <b>ROM</b> when the code has been finalized. For example, Atmel microcontrollers come in both EEPROM and <b>mask</b> <b>ROM</b> formats.|$|E

40|$|Background: A {{temporal}} resolution test {{in addition to}} the pure-tone audiogram may be of great clinical interest because of its relevance in speech perception and expected relevance in hearing aid fitting. Larsby and Arlinger developed an appropriate clinical test, but this test uses a Bekesy-tracking procedure for estimating masked thresholds in stationary and interrupted noise to assess release of <b>masking</b> (<b>RoM)</b> for {{temporal resolution}}. Generally the Hughson-Westlake up-down procedure is used in the clinic to measure the pure-tone thresholds in quiet. A uniform approach will facilitate clinical application and might be appropriate for RoM measurements as well. Because there is no golden standard for measuring the RoM in the clinic, we examine in the present study the Hughson-Westlake up-down procedure to measure the RoM and compare the results with the Bekesy-tracking procedure. Purpose: The purpose of the current {{study was to examine the}} differences between a Bakesy-tracking procedure and the Hughson-Westlake up-down procedure for estimating masked thresholds in stationary and interrupted noise to assess RoM. Research Design: RoM is assessed in eight normal-hearing (NH) and ten hearing-impaired (HI) listeners through both methods. Results from both methods are compared with each other and with predicted thresholds from a model. Data Analysis: Wilcoxon signed-rank tests, paired t tests. Results: Some differences between the two methods were found. We used a model to quantify the results of the two measurement procedures. The results of the Hughson-Westlake procedure were clearly better in agreement with the model than the results of the Bekesy-tracking procedure. Furthermore, the Bekesy-tracking procedure showed more spread in the results of the NH listeners than the Hughson-Westlake procedure. Conclusions: The Hughson-Westlake procedure seems to be an applicable alternative for measuring RoM for temporal resolution in the clinical audiological practic...|$|R
5000|$|Most {{microcontrollers}} at {{this time}} had concurrent variants. One had an erasable EPROM program memory, with a transparent quartz window in {{the lid of the}} package to allow it to be erased by exposure to ultraviolet light, often used for prototyping. The other was either a <b>mask</b> programmed <b>ROM</b> from the manufacturer for large series, or a PROM variant which was only programmable once; sometimes this was signified with the designation OTP, standing for [...] "one-time programmable". The PROM was of identical type of memory as the EPROM, but because {{there was no way to}} expose it to ultraviolet light, it could not be erased. The erasable versions required ceramic packages with quartz windows, making them significantly more expensive than the OTP versions, which could be made in lower-cost opaque plastic packages. For the erasable variants, quartz was required, instead of less expensive glass, for its transparency to ultraviolet - glass is largely opaque to UV - but the main cost differentiator was the ceramic package itself.|$|R
