25|$|Yet the {{majority}} of World War II engines used superchargers, because they maintained three significant manufacturing advantages over turbochargers, which were larger, involved extra piping, and required exotic high-temperature materials in the turbine and pre-turbine section of the exhaust system. The size of the piping alone is a serious issue; American fighters Vought F4U and Republic P-47 used the same engine, but the huge barrel-like fuselage of the latter was, in part, needed to hold the piping {{to and from the}} turbocharger {{in the rear of the}} plane. Turbocharged piston engines are also subject to many of the same operating restrictions as gas turbine engines. Pilots must make smooth, slow throttle adjustments to avoid overshooting their target manifold pressure. The fuel/air mixture must often be adjusted far on the rich side of stoichiometric combustion needs to avoid pre-ignition or detonation in the engine when running at high power settings. In systems using a manually operated wastegate, the pilot <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>careful</b> <b>not</b> to exceed the turbocharger's maximum rpm. The additional systems and piping increase an aircraft engine's size, weight, complexity and cost. A turbocharged aircraft engine costs more to maintain than a comparable normally aspirated engine. The great majority of World War II American heavy bombers used by the USAAF, particularly the Wright R-1820 Cyclone-9 powered B-17 Flying Fortress, and Pratt & Whitney R-1830 Twin Wasp powered Consolidated B-24 Liberator four-engine bombers both used similar models of General Electric-designed turbochargers in service, as did the twin Allison V-1710-engined Lockheed P-38 Lightning American heavy fighter during the war years.|$|E

Homer travels back in time again {{attempting to}} set things right; however, he accidentally kills a walking fish, and after returning to the present, he finds Bart and Lisa are giants, narrowly avoiding being crushed by them. He then sneezes and infects the dinosaurs with a cold virus while defending himself from a Tyrannosaurus Rex, which proceeds to cause their extinction. He is initially pleased with the results in the present; amongst other perks, the family is now extremely wealthy and Patty and Selma have died, but is horrified upon discovering that donuts do not exist in this timeline and flees, only seconds before donuts begin raining from the sky. In another world, Willie attempts to help Homer, but is again struck in the back with an axe, this time by Maggie. After several more trips back and forth in time, Homer eventually arrives in a reality that appears normal; he finds humans eating with lizard-like tongues, but finally decides that it is [...] "close enough".|$|E

500|$|Mystery writer Andrew Klavan, {{writing in}} The Wall Street Journal, {{compared}} the extreme measures that Batman takes to fight crime with those U.S. President George W.

Bush {{in this time of}} terror and war." [...] Klavan supports this reading of the film by comparing Batman—like Bush, Klavan argues—"sometimes has to push the boundaries of civil rights to deal with an emergency, certain that he will re-establish those boundaries when the emergency is past." [...] Klavan's article has received criticism on the Internet and in mainstream media outlets, such as in The New Republics [...] "The Plank." [...] Reviewing the film in The Sunday Times, Cosmo Landesman reached the opposite conclusion to Klavan, arguing that The Dark Knight [...] "offers up a lot of moralistic waffle about how we must hug a terrorist– okay, I exaggerate. At its heart, however, is a long and tedious discussion about how individuals and society must never abandon the rule of law in struggling against the forces of lawlessness. In fighting monsters, we <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>careful</b> <b>not</b> to become monsters– that sort of thing. The film champions the anti-war coalition's claim that, in having a war on terror, you create the conditions for more terror. We are shown that innocent people died because of Batman– and he falls for it." [...] Benjamin Kerstein, writing in Azure, says that both Klavan and Landesman [...] "have a point," [...] because [...] "The Dark Knight is a perfect mirror of the society which is watching it: a society so divided on the issues of terror and how to fight it that, {{for the first time in}} decades, an American mainstream no longer exists." ...|$|E

2500|$|There {{are certain}} {{characteristics}} of adolescent development {{that are more}} rooted in culture than in human biology or cognitive structures. Culture {{has been defined as}} the [...] "symbolic and behavioral inheritance received from the past that provides a community framework for what is valued". [...] Culture is learned and socially shared, and it affects all aspects of an individual's life. [...] Social responsibilities, sexual expression, and belief system development, for instance, are all things that are likely to vary by culture. Furthermore, distinguishing characteristics of youth, including dress, music and other uses of media, employment, art, food and beverage choices, recreation, and language, all constitute a youth culture. [...] For these reasons, culture is a prevalent and powerful presence in the lives of adolescents, and therefore we cannot fully understand today's adolescents without studying and understanding their culture. However, [...] "culture" [...] should not be seen as synonymous with nation or ethnicity. Many cultures are present within any given country and racial or socioeconomic group.
