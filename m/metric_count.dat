40|$|The {{security}} {{risk of a}} network against unknown zero day attacks has been considered as something unmeasurable since software flaws are less predictable than hardware faults {{and the process of}} finding such flaws and developing exploits seems to be chaotic. In this paper, we propose a novel security metric, k-zero day safety, {{based on the number of}} unknown zero day vulnerabilities. That is, the <b>metric</b> <b>counts</b> at least how many unknown vulnerabilities are required for compromising a network asset, regardless of what vulnerabilities those are. We formally define the metric based on a model of relevant network components. We then devise algorithms for computing the metric.

30|$|As {{shown in}} Figure 26, {{in the absence}} of BG traffic, the PATH-DR metric gives the highest {{delivery}} cost. This happens because route failures do not happen often, and hence the number of control packet messages transmitted is low, which benefits the Hop <b>count</b> <b>metric.</b> However, under BG traffic conditions, LQI-based metrics, and in particular PATH-DR, outperform the Hop <b>count</b> <b>metric.</b> In fact, in these conditions, control packets due to route failure and discovery dominate the delivery cost, which benefits the metrics that provide good PDR.|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{genetic code}} is {{examined}} {{in a new}} and systematic fashion: we consider the code as mapping of one finite set (the 64 codons) to another (the 20 amino acids). Given a class of mappings simpler than the actual code, we ask which mappings best approximate it. This leads to an analysis of the effects of ambiguities (codon degeneracy) in one or two positions. With the 0 – 1 <b>metric</b> (<b>counting</b> the amino acids as equal or not equal), the codon third base degeneracy is apparent, but the first and second positions are indistinguishable; with the integrated amino acid “distance” metric compiled by Sneath (J. Theoret. Biol. 12 (1966), 157 – 195), the analysis ranks the information content of the three codon positions as follows: 2 nd > 1 st > 3 rd. We discuss possible further applications of this approach to patterns in the genetic code and other codes...|$|R

30|$|As {{shown in}} Figure 24, all LQI-based routing metrics {{outperform}} the Hop <b>count</b> <b>metric</b> {{in terms of}} PDR under all BG traffic conditions. The PDR decreases and the path hop count increases as the BG traffic transmitters are closer to the sender/receiver pair and as the interference level at {{the receiving end of}} each link becomes greater. PATH-DR yields the largest paths because it aims at maximizing the PDR, as we also observed in Section 7. The Hop <b>count</b> <b>metric</b> minimizes the path length. However, this metric selects paths that may not include good quality links and may be affected by BG traffic. LETX and ZigBee do not yield the same PDR as PATH-DR, but select shorter paths than those chosen by PATH-DR (see Figure 25).|$|R
40|$|Abstract—By {{enabling}} {{a direct}} comparison of different security solutions {{with respect to}} their relative effectiveness, a network security metric may provide quantifiable evidences to assist security practitioners in securing computer networks. However, research on security metrics has been hindered by difficulties in handling zero day attacks exploiting unknown vulnerabilities. In fact, the security risk of unknown vulnerabilities has been considered as something unmeasurable due to the less predictable nature of software flaws. This causes a major difficulty to security metrics, because a more secure configuration would be of little value if it were equally susceptible to zero day attacks. In this paper, we propose a novel security metric, k-zero day safety, to address this issue. Instead of attempting to rank unknown vulnerabilities, our <b>metric</b> <b>counts</b> how many such vulnerabilities would be required for compromising network assets; a larger count implies more security since the likelihood of having more unknown vulnerabilities available, applicable, and exploitable {{all at the same time}} will be significantly lower. We formally define the metric, analyze the complexity of computing the metric, devise heuristic algorithms for intractable cases, and finally demonstrate through case studies that applying the metric to existing network security practices may generate actionable knowledge.

40|$|Poorly {{structured}} code is hard {{to maintain}} and read. Refactoring can improve the code structure and thus {{make it easier to}} preserve and to discern the underlying design. According to Martin Fowler’s book Refactoring, refactoring is “a change made to the internal structure of software {{to make it easier to}} understand and cheaper to modify without changing its observable behavior. ” Refactoring is a difficult and time consuming process which makes it an unattractive activity for many developers. A tool that could automatically identify refactorable code sections and make fix suggestions would make refactoring much easier and faster. In my research I have developed the tool Look # for just this purpose. The Look # tool uses lightweight detection algorithms based on code metrics to identify refactorable code sections. Each refactoring technique that Look # can detect has been distilled down into a lightweight algorithm based on thresholds and syntactic keywords. Some refactoring techniques are detected by calculating code metrics and then evaluating if those code <b>metric</b> <b>counts</b> exceed a certain threshold. Other refactoring techniques are detected by looking for certain syntactic indicators, like a public access modifier on a field. Many of the guidelines Martin Fowler provides for determining when to apply certain refactoring methods are based on “human intuition ” and abstract perceptions. This makes it extremely difficult to automaticall...|$|R

40|$|Wireless {{networks}} have many dimension devices which are connected by wireless communication links. The links {{are most often}} implemented with digital packet radios. Because each radio link has a limited communications range, many pairs of nodes cannot communicate directly, and must forward data to each other via one or more cooperating intermediate nodes. We will often use „time <b>count</b> <b>metric</b> ‟ to mean the minimum hop-count metric. Modified protocols with the PTC (Potential transmission <b>Count</b> <b>Metric)</b> of a route is {{the total number of}} packet transmissions and retransmissions required to send a packet across the route, assuming that each link in the route retransmits the packet until it is successfully received across the link. PTC is designed for links with link-layer acknowledgments and retransmissions. The PTC metric for a route is calculated using measurements of the lossyless of each link in the route. Routing protocols select routes with the minimum PTC. PTC improves the throughput of both Dynamic Source Routing (DSR), an on-demand source routing protocol, and Destination-Sequenced Distance-Vector (DSDV) routing, a proactive table-driven distance-vector routing protocol.
