40|$|Black {{and white}} {{photograph}} of Rice University Owls baseball player Allan Ramirez, headlining his achievement into the Rice Athletic Hall of Fame. Caption reads: Let’s take a brief glance {{at some of}} the honors won by another deserving new member of the Rice Athletic Hall of Fame, Allan Ramirez. [...] He set the all-time Southwest Conference record for strikeouts in SWC games while starring for the Owls during a four-year career from 1976 - 79. [...] He won four games for the Baltimore Orioles during their World Championship year of 1983. [...] And perhaps most significantly, he was the winning pitcher in one of the all-time greatest games in SWC history, a March 27, 1977 4 – 3 Rice win over the Texas Longhorns in 14 innings. The win ended UT’s 34 -game win streak, the longest in NCAA history. Allan Ramirez was a superior competitor who loved to go out “against the odds” and win while playing for Rice under veteran coach Doug Osburn. He is now doing well as a <b>medical</b> <b>sales</b> <b>representative</b> for Roerig Pharmaceuticals in his old home town of Victoria. Arm trouble in 1983 forced Allan to undergo arthoscopic surgery later during the 1984 season. He tried to come back in 1985, but is just didn’t work out for Ramirez as he prematurely retired from baseball that year. What a shame the arm trouble emerged as, at a young 32, Ramirez could still be pitching major league baseball today. But Ramirez has no regrets. He has a good job, a fine family he’s very proud of (wife Hilda Marie who he married on September 2, 1978, and children Renee Michelle (8) and Felice Danielle (5), and is now happily situated in Victory as he enters the Rice Hall of Fame. Allan had some dramatic moments in his exciting career at Rice, but {{there is no question that}} his victory at Austin against the Longhorns is the highlight. Ramirez was a mere sophomore challenging the Horns at relatively new Disch-Falk Field. UT was riding a 34 -game win streak, then and now the longest in Division I history. In fact, eliminating the post-season NCAA play-offs, UT went into that game without a loss in 48 straight regular-season games! It was an early-season March encounter in SWC action. Saturday’s game was rained out so the Owls and Longhorns were playing on a Sunday. A gutsy Ramirez had thrown more than 200 pitches to keep his Owls tied with UT at 3 – 3 through 13 innings. Finally, an exhausted Ramirez had to be pinch hit for in the 14 th, but the Owls came through to score a run and take a 4 – 3 lead. Jeff Hays came in the bottom of the 14 th to retire UT and earn the save for Ramirez as the Owls ended the all-time longest winning streak in college baseball history. Ramirez had many more career highlights for Rice. His 134 strikeouts in 1976 broke an impressive SWC mark set by fabulous Bobby Layne of Texas. He set career Rice standards in complete games (39), shutouts (7), strikeouts (418), inning pitched (342), games started (48) and games completed (39) and wins (27). He also has the season record for shutouts with five in 1976 and ERA for a season with a sparking 1. 90 during that marvelous 1976 freshman season. His career ERA of 2. 53 ranks third on the all-time Rice list behind current Cincinnati Reds pitcher Norm Charlton and David Pavlas. Perhaps the most telling story about Allan occurred when he faced UH at Cougar Field. The game was in the last of the seventh inning, the bases were loaded with two out and a 3 – 2 count on the batter. EVERYTHING depended on Allan’s final pitch with Rice up a single run. With all the runners in motion, Allan calmed reared back and struck out the Cougar batter to give Rice the win. It was sheer drama, as was usually the case when Ramirez pitched.

40|$|Since its {{inception}} by Khan in 1990, {{the topic of}} employee engagement has become firmly associated with principal business concerns such as organizational performance and employee retention. The {{aim of this study}} was firstly to investigate and determine the key factors of employee engagement for <b>medical</b> <b>sales</b> <b>representatives</b> (MSRs) based in the Western Cape of South Africa. Secondly, this study explores the potential link between the key factors of employee engagement and the type of product the MSR sells. Lastly, this paper illuminates and differentiates between what MSRs evaluate for themselves {{to be the most important}} factors of employee engagement and what they consider to be the most important factor(s) in other MSRs. This tests whether assumptions held by MSRs in regards to what affects <b>medical</b> <b>sales</b> <b>representatives</b> in general match the findings through surveys and analysis. By replacing strongly held assumptions with researched findings, the needs of MSRs may well be better met and their employee engagement better maintained. This study tested 15 employee engagement factors such as psychological contract, organizational culture, leadership, and work-life balance. In gathering data, self-administered questionnaires utilising a 5 -point Likert scale were either e-mailed directly to MSRs or via HR personnel within an array of medical companies based in South Africa. In total, 60 surveys were attempted and 52 of these completed all but the final qualitative question; and 44 surveys were fully completed. Findings revealed that the average age is 35 - 44 years, 58 % are female, and that 43 % have worked for the same company for more than 5 years. Further, many MSRs assumed that Rewards & Recognition would be the most influential factor in determining employee engagement; however, upon analysis of the surveyed results, this factor fared among the least pertinent.

40|$|Pakistan is the 6 th {{most populous}} {{country in the}} world and has an {{enormous}} potential for an ever increasing drug market. The health care system is highly prone to unethical drug prescribing practices. In addition, there is a huge tendency of pharmaceutical firms to indulge in unethical drug promotional practices by means of inducements and other benefits through their <b>medical</b> <b>sales</b> <b>representatives</b> (MSRs). On the other hand, the prescribers are also reported to be demanding inducements from these companies in return to write higher number of prescription. This study investigated the ground realities of drug promotion and prescribing practices in Pakistan. Materials and Methods: A cross sectional study was conducted for a period of 8 months in which 472 physicians and 609 <b>medical</b> <b>sales</b> <b>representatives</b> of Pakistan selected through prospective sampling were interviewed on a validated, structured questionnaire. The responses of the target groups were then analyzed for association between variables by Chi–square test (p< 0. 05) and cross tabulation through SPSS, version 20. Results: Majority of practitioners (83. 2 %) expected both, good communication skills and knowledge from MSRs {{and at the same time}} nearly half (53 %) of prescribers demanded CME and almost a third proportion (36 %) demanded gifts, incentives and inducements from MSRs. Replying to same question, MSRs disagreed with prescribers and believed that around (~ 70 %) of prescribers ask for inducements with a high percentage i. e. (~ 64 %) among them demanding unethical inducements like excessive free samples, gifts, leisure trips and cars. Majority of physicians (92 %) have consensus that the multinational pharmaceutical firms have defined promotional practices while the national pharmaceutical companies (~ 73 %) are mainly involved in unethical practices of drug marketing. Conclusion: Majority of national pharmaceuticals as well as prescribers were involved in unethical drug promotion and prescribing respectively. There is a need of curbing the unethical drug promotion and prescribing and formidable policies governing this issue are required to be implemented by the concerned regulatory authorities to avoid unnecessary harm to the patient’s life and pocket.

This cross sectional descriptive study, conducted during November and December 2014 in the Lahore and Bahawalpur districts of Punjab, Pakistan, evaluates the Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQoL) and extent of depression among MSRs in Pakistan. The significant predictors of HRQoL and depression among the MSRs were also determined. Using a convenience sampling technique, all consenting MSRs (N =  318) of pharmaceutical companies were asked to self-complete the Short Form- 36 (SF- 36 v 2) Health Survey and Stanford Personal Health Questionnaire (PHQ- 8). The standard scoring scheme for the SF 36 v 2 and PHQ- 8 questionnaires was used. The PHQ- 8 scores showed that 16.4  % (n =  52) and 2.5  % of respondents were suffering from major depression and severe major depression, respectively. Being depressed and having difficulty in achieving sales targets were the factors independently associated with lower physical health. Similarly, depression, insufficient time for the family and monthly income less than 36, 000 Pakistan Rupees were significant predictors of lower mental health. The factors associated with depression included insufficient time for the family and unsatisfactory behavior of the managers. Compromised mental health and the prevalence of depression among the MSRs suggest pharmaceutical companies need to devise health management strategies and interventions to ensure effective prevention and management of mental health problems among Pakistani MSRs.|$|R

30|$|Employing <b>medical</b> <b>sales</b> <b>representatives</b> (MSRs) is {{the most}} {{extensively}} used marketing technique by pharmaceutical firms. The MSRs act as {{a link between the}} healthcare professionals and pharmaceutical firms. Selling of prescription and nonprescription drugs and medical equipment, by creating awareness among the healthcare professionals as to the uniqueness of their product, persuading them to prescribe it, are some basic duties of the MSRs. In western countries, the pharmaceutical market is captured by positioning a single <b>sales</b> <b>representative</b> for every eight general practitioners (Caudill et al. 1996). However, the number of MSRs varies in different companies in Pakistan. A medium sized company has about 500 MSRs, and the number increases with the size of the pharmaceutical firm. There are approximately 25, 000 MSRs in Pakistan, each having a call list of about 200 physicians with a target of visiting approximately 120 physicians every 4 – 6  weeks (Ahmed et al. 2014). Working at different geographical locations with specialty groups, organizing group discussions along with face to face meetings with doctors are the core elements of the job description of the MSRs in Pakistan (Kumar and Panigrahi 2014). However, {{most of the time they}} use ‘other’ techniques to promote the sale of pharmaceuticals. For example, offering gifts to the doctors, paying for their recreational and conference visits, offering monetary benefit on per unit sales of a pharmaceutical and so forth. This is because of unhealthy competition among the pharmaceutical firms in Pakistan. It is seen that the stressful working conditions and the irrational nature of the sales targets assigned to the MSRs hinder their productivity at work by causing depression, which results in their diminished HRQoL, ultimately reducing the work outcome on their part and the organization’s progress from a broader perspective (Behrman and Perreault 1984). Studies from India (Patil and Meena 2013), Japan (Sakakibara et al. 2006), the United Kingdom (UK) (Sang et al. 2010) and Turkey (Tander et al. 2007) have reported musculoskeletal problems and stress among MSRs in those countries.|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background After {{adoption}} of artesunate-amodiaquine (AS/AQ) as first-line therapy {{for the treatment}} of uncomplicated malaria by the malaria control programme, {{this study was designed to}} assess the availability of anti-malarial drugs, treatment practices and acceptability of the new protocol by health professionals, in the urban health facilities and drugstores of Yaoundé city, Cameroon. Methods Between April and August 2005, retrospective and current information was collected by consulting registers and interviewing health practitioners in urban health facilities using a structured questionnaire. Results In 2005, twenty-seven trade-named drugs have been identified in drugstores; quinine tablets (300 mg) were the most affordable anti-malarial drugs. Chloroquine was restricted to food market places and no generic artemisinin derivative was available in public health centres. In public health facilities, 13. 6 % of health professionals were informed about the new guidelines; 73. 5 % supported the use of AS-AQ as first-line therapy. However, 38. 6 % apprehended its use due to adverse events attributed to amodiaquine. Malaria treatment was mainly based on the diagnosis of fever. Quinine (300 mg tablets) was the most commonly prescribed first-line anti-malarial drug in adults (44. 5 %) and pregnant women (52. 5 %). Artequin ® was the most cited artemsinin-based combination therapy (ACT) (9. 9 %). <b>Medical</b> <b>sales</b> <b>representatives</b> were the main sources of information on anti-malarials. Conclusion The use of AS/AQ was not implemented in 2005 in Yaoundé, despite the wide range of anti-malarials and trade-named artemisinin derivatives available. Nevertheless, medical practitioners will support the use of this combination, when it is available in a paediatric formulation, at an affordable price. Training, information and participation of health professionals in decision-making is one of the key elements to improve adherence to new protocol guidelines. This baseline information will be useful to monitor progress in ACT implementation in Cameroon. </p...|$|R
