5|$|Amphetamine is {{frequently}} measured in urine or blood {{as part of}} a drug test for sports, employment, poisoning diagnostics, and forensics. Techniques such as immunoassay, which is {{the most common form of}} amphetamine test, may cross-react with a number of sympathomimetic drugs. Chromatographic methods specific for amphetamine are employed to prevent false positive results. Chiral separation techniques may be employed to help distinguish the source of the drug, whether prescription amphetamine, prescription amphetamine prodrugs, (e.g., selegiline), over-the-counter drug products that contain levomethamphetamine, or illicitly obtained substituted amphetamines. Several prescription drugs produce amphetamine as a metabolite, including benzphetamine, clobenzorex, famprofazone, fenproporex, lisdexamfetamine, <b>mesocarb,</b> methamphetamine, prenylamine, and selegiline, among others. These compounds may produce positive results for amphetamine on drug tests. Amphetamine is generally only detectable by a standard drug test for approximately 24hours, although a high dose may be detectable for days.|$|E
50|$|<b>Mesocarb</b> {{has been}} {{referred}} to as a prodrug of amphetamine. Indeed, it produces amphetamine as a metabolite, and amphetamine concentrations are far higher than <b>mesocarb</b> concentrations in human urine 22 hours post-administration (0.7-186 ng/mL and 0.004-0.17 ng/mL, respectively). However, <b>mesocarb</b> also possesses molecular actions of its own, inhibiting the reuptake of dopamine and to a far lesser extent of norepinephrine, but not of serotonin.|$|E

50|$|In August 2015, Ukrainian Anatoliy Budyak tested {{positive}} for <b>Mesocarb.</b>|$|E
50|$|A sydnone imine {{substructure}} can {{be found}} in the drugs feprosidnine, <b>mesocarb,</b> molsidomine, ciclosidomine, and linsidomine.|$|E
50|$|Feprosidnine (Sydnophen) is a {{stimulant}} drug {{which was}} developed in the USSR in the 1970s. It is structurally related to another Russian drug <b>mesocarb</b> but unlike <b>Mesocarb,</b> was withdrawn earlier from production. In comparison with <b>Mesocarb</b> it has own antidepressant activity, which makes it useful in treating depressions. Indications of Feprosidnine included apathic, asthenic depressions, fatique, apathic syndrome, narcolepsy and other similar conditions. Therapeutic range of doses: 10-50mg a day.Sydnophen has multiple mechanisms of action, the relative importance of which has not been clearly established. Effects on the body include reversible monoamine oxidase inhibition, cholinergic, adrenergic, opioid and nitric oxide donating actions, all of which may contribute to its pharmacological effects to some extent.|$|E
50|$|<b>Mesocarb</b> is a mesoionic sydnone imine. It has the amphetamine-backbone present, {{except that}} the RN has a {{complicated}} imine side-chain present.|$|E
50|$|<b>Mesocarb</b> {{was sold}} in Russia as 5 {{milligram}} tablets under the brand name Sydnocarb. Hydroxylated metabolites can be detected in urine for up to 10 days after consumption.|$|E
50|$|A {{variety of}} prodrugs of {{amphetamine}} and/or methamphetamine exist, and include amfecloral, amphetaminil, benzphetamine, clobenzorex, D-deprenyl, dimethylamphetamine, ethylamphetamine, fencamine, fenethylline, fenproporex, furfenorex, lisdexamfetamine, mefenorex, <b>mesocarb,</b> prenylamine, selegiline, and tranylcypromine.|$|E
50|$|<b>Mesocarb</b> (brand names Sidnocarb, Sydnocarb) is a {{stimulant}} drug {{which was}} developed in the USSR in the 1970s. It has been found to act as a selective dopamine reuptake inhibitor, and is less potent and slower-acting but longer-lasting than dextroamphetamine.|$|E
50|$|<b>Mesocarb</b> {{was used}} {{for a variety of}} applications; these include counteracting the {{sedative}} effects of benzodiazepine drugs, increasing workload capacity and cardiovascular function, treatment of ADHD and hyperactivity in children, as a nootropic, and as a drug to enhance resistance to extremely cold temperatures. It is also listed as having antidepressant and anticonvulsant properties.|$|E
50|$|Mesoionic {{compounds}} are dipolar five membered heterocyclic {{compounds in}} which both the negative and the positive charges are delocalized. A completely uncharged structure cannot be written and mesoionic compounds cannot be represented satisfactorily by any one mesomeric structure. Mesoionic compounds are a subclass of betaines. Examples are sydnones and sydnone imines (e.g. the stimulant <b>mesocarb),</b> münchnones. and mesoionic carbenes.|$|E
50|$|<b>Mesocarb</b> {{is almost}} {{unknown in the}} western world and is neither used in {{medicine}} or studied scientifically to any great extent outside Russia and other countries in the former Soviet Union. It has however been added to the list of drugs under international control and is illegal in most countries, despite its multiple therapeutic applications and reported lack of significant abuse potential.|$|E
50|$|Controlled drug {{prescription}} {{requirements and}} safe custody requirements do not apply. Included drugs are Benzodiazepines (Subclass CD Benz), other than temazepam, flunitrazepam or midazolam, and androgenic and anabolic steroids (Subclass CD Anab). However CD Benz products- which also include mild stimulants such as <b>mesocarb</b> and femcamfamine, formerly prescribed as anorectics- are illegal to supply or possess without prescription and all Sch 4 drugs cannot be legally supplied without medical authority.|$|E
5000|$|Sydnone is a mesoionic heterocyclic {{aromatic}} chemical compound. Recent computational studies have, however, shown sydnone {{and other}} similar mesoionic compounds to be nonaromatic, [...] "though well-stabilized in two separate regions by electron and charge delocalization." [...] A sydnone imine in which the keto group of sydnone (=O) has been replaced with an imino (=NH) group can be found as a substructure in the stimulant drugs feprosidnine and <b>mesocarb.</b>|$|E

50|$|Although it is {{frequently}} labeled as a psychostimulant, bromantane is distinct in its pharmacology and effects relative to typical psychostimulants, {{such as the}} phenethylamines (e.g., amphetamine and its derivatives) and their structural analogues (e.g., methylphenidate, cocaine, <b>mesocarb,</b> etc.). Whereas the latter directly act on the dopamine transporter to inhibit the reuptake and/or induce the release of dopamine, bromantane instead acts via indirect genomic mechanisms to produce a rapid, pronounced, and long-lasting upregulation {{in a variety of}} brain regions of the expression of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase (AAAD) (also known as DOPA decarboxylase), key enzymes in the dopamine biosynthesis pathway. For instance, a single dose of bromantane produces a 2- to 2.5-fold increase in TH expression in the rat hypothalamus 1.5- to 2-hours post-administration. The biosynthesis and release of dopamine subsequently increase in close correlation with TH and AAAD upregulation. Enhancement of dopaminergic neurotransmission is observed in the hypothalamus, striatum, ventral tegmental area, nucleus accumbens, and other regions. As such, the key mechanism of the pharmacological activity and psychostimulant effects of bromantane is activation of the de novo synthesis of dopamine via modulation of gene expression. In contrast, typical psychostimulants do not affect TH or AAAD expression and thus have no effect on dopamine biosynthesis.|$|E
50|$|The {{following}} {{drugs have}} DRI action {{and have been}} or are used clinically specifically for this property: amineptine, dexmethylphenidate, difemetorex, fencamfamine, lefetamine, levophacetoperane, medifoxamine, <b>mesocarb,</b> methylphenidate, nomifensine, pipradrol, prolintane, and pyrovalerone. The following drugs are or have been used clinically and possess only weak DRI action, {{which may or may}} not be clinically-relevant: adrafinil, armodafinil, bupropion, mazindol, modafinil, nefazodone, sertraline, and sibutramine. The following drugs are or have been clinically used but only coincidentally have DRI properties: benzatropine, diphenylpyraline, etybenzatropine, ketamine, nefopam, pethidine (meperidine), and tripelennamine. The following are a selection of some particularly notably abused DRIs: cocaine, ketamine, MDPV, naphyrone, and phencyclidine (PCP). Amphetamines, including amphetamine, methamphetamine, MDMA, cathinone, methcathinone, mephedrone, and methylone, are all DRIs as well, but are distinct in that they also behave, and potentially more potently as dopamine releasing agents (DRAs) (it should be noted that due to Yerkes-Dodson's law, 'more potently stimulated' may not equal more optimally functionally stimulated). There are very distinct differences in the mode of action between dopamine releasers/substrates & dopamine re-uptake inhibitors; the former are functionally entropy-driven (i.e. relating to hydrophobicity) and the latter are enthalpy-driven (i.e. relating conformational change). Reuptake inhibitors such as cocaine induce hyperpolarization of cloned human DAT upon oocytes that are naturally found on neurons, whereas releasing agents induce de-polarization of the neuron membrane.|$|E
40|$|A fast liquid chromatographic/mass spectrometric (LC/MS/MS) {{screening}} method for the detection, in urine, of synthetic glucocorticoids, stimulants (formoterol, modafinil and <b>mesocarb),</b> anti-oestrogens (finasteride, exemestane, anastrozole, letrozole and formestane) and synthetic anabolic steroids (stanozolol, gestrinone and tetrahydrogestrinone) is described. All these drugs (and/or their urinary metabolites) can be simultaneously extracted {{by a single}} liquid/liquid extraction step, at alkaline pH, after enzymatic hydrolysis with β-glucuronidase, and assayed in 7 min by LC/MS/MS using electrospray ionization in positive ion mode and multiple reaction monitoring as the acquisition mode. All compounds show good reproducibility of both the retention times (CV% < 2 %) and the relative abundances (CV% < 10 %). The limits of detection for the anti-oestrogens, glucocorticoids and steroids {{are in the range}} of 1 - 30 ng/mL, and for the stimulants are in the range of 100 - 200 ng/mL, thus satisfying the minimum required performance limits of the World Anti-Doping Agency.

40|$|Objective: The use of {{performance}} enhancing substances is banned in sports by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA). Though most prohibited substances {{can be detected}} by GC/MS, inclusion of corticosteroids and designer drugs has made it essential to detect these critical doping agents on LC/MS/MS due to their better separation and detection. Materials and Methods: A common extraction procedure for the isolation of acidic, basic and neutral drugs from urine samples was developed. A total of 28 doping drugs were analyzed on API 3200 Triple quadrupole mass spectrometer using C 18 column in atmospheric pressure electrospray ionization. The mobile phase composition {{was a mixture of}} 1 &#x 0025; formic acid and acetonitrile with gradient time period. Results: The method developed was very sensitive for detection of 28 doping agents. The linearity was performed for each drug and the total recovery percentage ranged from 57 to 114. Limit of detection is found to be 0. 5 ng/ml for carboxy finasteride and 1 - 5 ng/ml for other drugs. The method was successfully used to detect positive urine samples of 3 -OH-stanozolol, methyl phenidate, <b>mesocarb,</b> clomiphene metabolite and carboxy finasteride. Conclusion: The method developed based on controlled pH extraction method and HPLC-mass spectrometry analysis allowed better identification and confirmation of glucocorticosteroids and a few other drugs in different categories. The validated method has been used successfully for testing of 1000 In-competition samples. The method helped in detection of chemically and pharmacologically different banned drugs in urine in a single short run at a minimum required performance limit set by WADA...|$|E
