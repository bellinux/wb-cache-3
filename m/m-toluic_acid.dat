40|$|Therapeutically {{potential}} prodrugs of piroxicam were synthesized by effective masking of enolic {{hydroxyl group}} through generation of ester congeners. The reaction facilitated using N,N′-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide coupled with acetic acid, benzoic acid, p-toluic acid, <b>m-toluic</b> <b>acid,</b> and cinnamic acid. Synthesized prodrugs were characterized for {{confirmation of the}} said structures. The modification of piroxicam showed better anti-inflammatory activity as evoked by all prodrugs. Interestingly, compound 3 e, cinnamic acid ester prodrug, depicted 75 percent inhibition of rat paw edema as compared to 56 percent for parent piroxicam at 6 [*]h of study. The present work proves the applicability not only with increased anti-inflammatory activity, but also with marked attenuation in ulcerogenicity.

40|$|The {{inhibition}} kinetics of alkylbenzoic acids on the diphenolase {{activity of}} mushroom tyrosinase have been investigated. The {{results show that}} the alkylbenzoic acids assayed can lead to reversible inhibition of the enzyme; furthermore, o-toluic acid and <b>m-toluic</b> <b>acid</b> are mixed-type inhibitors and p-alkylbenzoic acids are uncompetitive inhibitors. The inhibition constants have been determined. For these p-alkylbenzoic acids, the inhibition strength follows the order: p-toluic acid < p-ethylbenzoic acid < p-propylbenzoic acid < p-isopropylbenzoic acid < p-tert-butylbenzoic acid < p-butylbenzoic acid < p-pentylbenzoic acid < p-hexylbenzoic acid < p-heptylbenzoic acid < p-octylbenzoic acid, indicating that the hydrophobic p-alkyl group {{played an important role in}} the inhibition of the enzyme. The inhibitory effects were potentiated with increasing lengths of the hydrocarbon chains. The inhibitory effects of o-toluic acid and p-isopropylbenzoic acid on the monophenolase activity have also been studied. The results show that both o-toluic acid and p-isopropylbenzoic acid can lengthen the lag time and decrease the steady-state activity of the enzyme. (c) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E

Research completed at Department of Chemistry College of Liberal Arts & SciencesPeptide fragmentation {{is an integral part}} of an evolving field commonly referred to as proteomics. Understanding of peptide fragmentation is vital to continued proteomic research. The frame work of this study was the benzylglycine methyl ester with either a methyl or trifluoromethyl constituent in the para- and meta-positions of the benzyl ring. The glycine methyl ester was coupled to the different acids using a PS-carbodiimide resin. The acids used were p-trifluorotoluic acid, m-trifluorotoluic acid, p-toluic acid, and <b>m-toluic</b> <b>acid.</b> Synthesis was confirmed using electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS). Collision induced dissociation (CID) was utilized to observe the dissociation tendencies of the given molecules. The anticipated b 2 + pathway as seen in previous studies was not as readily seen for some of the molecules in this study. Density functional theory calculations were employed for the reaction pathways to determine the thermodynamic characteristics on the pathways to help explain the observed fragmentation pathways. underserved and primary care settings...|$|E
40|$|Bio-based furanics can be {{aromatized}} efficiently by sequential Diels–Alder (DA) addition and hydrogenation steps {{followed by}} tandem catalytic aromatization. With {{a combination of}} zeolite H-Y and Pd/C, the hydrogenated DA adduct of 2 -methylfuran and maleic anhydride can thus be aromatized in the liquid phase and, to a certain extent, decarboxylated to give high yields of the aromatic products 3 -methylphthalic anhydride and o- and <b>m-toluic</b> <b>acid.</b> Here, it is shown that {{a variation in the}} acidity and textural properties of the solid acid as well as bifunctionality offers a handle on selectivity toward aromatic products. The zeolite component was found to dominate selectivity. Indeed, a linear correlation is found between 3 -methylphthalic anhydride yield and the product of (strong acid/total acidity) and mesopore volume of H-Y, highlighting the need for balanced catalyst acidity and porosity. The efficient coupling of the dehydration and dehydrogenation steps by varying the zeolite-to-Pd/C ratio allowed the competitive decarboxylation reaction to be effectively suppressed, which led to an improved 3 -methylphthalic anhydride/total aromatics selectivity ratio of 80 % (89 % total aromatics yield). The incorporation of Pd nanoparticles in close proximity to the acid sites in bifunctional Pd/H-Y catalysts also afforded a flexible means to control aromatic products selectivity, as further demonstrated in the aromatization of hydrogenated DA adducts from other diene/dienophile combinations. </p...|$|E
40|$|A {{capillary}} zone electrophoresis {{method is}} {{developed for the}} determination of aromatic organic acids and nitrophenols in atmospheric aerosols. The procedure is based on sampling atmospheric particulate matter on quartz fiber filters and the extraction {{and analysis of the}} extracts by capillary electrophoresis. Separation conditions are optimized by varying the pH and acetonitrile content of the electrolyte buffer. Separations in a 20 % acetonitrile– 20 mM borate mixture (pH 9. 9) are able to resolve all of the geometric isomers of hydroxybenzoic acid, phthalic acid, benzenetricarboxylic acid, and nitrophenol as well as 1, 2, 4, 5 -benzenetricarboxylic acid, <b>m-toluic</b> <b>acid,</b> and sulfosalicylic acid. A buffer consisting of 11 % acetonitrile– 20 mM borate (pH 9. 9) is found to be most suitable for the analysis of atmospheric aerosol samples. Detection limits are in the order of 40 to 130 ng/mL. Intersample migration time reproducibility is generally better than 1. 5 %, with day-to-day variations under 3 %. A general extraction scheme using diethyl ether–HCl in combination with a preconcentration step is developed. Recoveries of spiked standards range from 59 % to 102 %, with relative standard deviations ranging from 2 % to 17 % for five determinations. The method is applied towards the analysis of ambient aerosol samples as well as vehicle emission studies with promising results, thus showing it to be a potential complement to already existing methodology for the analysis of organic acids and nitrophenols in atmospheric aerosols...|$|E
40|$|International audiencem-Toluic acid (MTA) {{is widely}} used in {{manufacturing}} of dyes, pharmaceuticals, polymer stabilizers, and insect repellents. The aim of {{present study was to}} evaluate the impact of biofield treatment on physical, thermal and spectroscopic properties of MTA. MTA sample was divided into two groups that served as treated and control. The treated group received Mr. Trivedi’s biofield treatment. Subsequently, the control and treated samples were evaluated using X-ray diffraction (XRD), surface area analyser, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) and ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) spectroscopy. XRD result showed a decrease in crystallite size in treated samples i. e. 42. 86 % in MTA along with the increase in peak intensity as compared to control. However, surface area analysis showed an increase in surface area of 107. 14 % in treated MTA sample as compared to control. Furthermore, DSC analysis results showed that the latent heat of fusion was considerably reduced by 40. 32 %, whereas, the melting temperature was increased (2. 23 %) in treated MTA sample as compared to control. The melting point of treated MTA was found to be 116. 04 °C as compared to control (113. 51 °C) sample. Moreover, TGA/DTG studies showed that the control sample lost 56. 25 % of its weight, whereas, in treated MTA, it was found 58. 60 %. Also, Tmax (temperature, at which sample lost maximum of its weight) was decreased by 1. 97 % in treated MTA sample as compared to control. It indicates that the vaporisation temperature of treated MTA sample might decrease as compared to control. The FT-IR and UV-Vis spectra did not show any significant change in spectral properties of treated MTA sample as compared to control. These findings suggest that biofield treatment has significantly altered the physical and thermal properties of <b>m-toluic</b> <b>acid,</b> which could make them more useful as a chemical intermediate...|$|E

40|$|Recombinant protein {{production}} is mostly realized with large-scale cultivations and monitored {{at the level}} of the entire population. Detailed knowledge of cell-to-cell variations with respect to cellular growth and product formation is limited, even though phenotypic heterogeneity may distinctly hamper overall production yields, especially for toxic or difficult-to-express proteins. Unraveling phenotypic heterogeneity is thus a key aspect in understanding and optimizing recombinant protein production in biotechnology and synthetic biology. Here, microfluidic single-cell analysis serves as the method of choice to investigate and unmask population heterogeneities in a dynamic and spatiotemporal fashion. In this study, we report on comparative microfluidic single-cell analyses of commonly used E. coli expression systems to uncover system-inherent specifications in the synthetic M 9 CA growth medium. To this end, the PT 7 lac/LacI, the PBAD/AraC and the Pm/XylS system were systematically analyzed in order to gain detailed insights into variations of growth behavior and expression phenotypes and thus to uncover individual strengths and deficiencies at the single-cell level. Specifically, we evaluated the impact of different system-specific inducers, inducer concentrations as well as genetic modifications that affect inducer-uptake and regulation of target gene expression on responsiveness and phenotypic heterogeneity. Interestingly, the most frequently applied expression system based on E. coli strain BL 21 (DE 3) clearly fell behind with respect to expression homogeneity and robustness of growth. Moreover, both the choice of inducer and the presence of inducer uptake systems proved crucial for phenotypic heterogeneity. Conclusively, microfluidic evaluation of different inducible E. coli expression systems and setups identified the modified lacY-deficient PT 7 lac/LacI as well as the Pm/XylS system with conventional <b>m-toluic</b> <b>acid</b> induction as key players for precise and robust triggering of bacterial gene expression in E. coli in a homogeneous fashion...|$|E
40|$|A {{total of}} fifteen {{bacteria}} from activated sludge were isolated for th eir ability to grow on aromatic substrates {{as the sole}} source of carbon and energy. They were identified {{as members of the}} genera Pseudomonas and Aeromonas. Four P. putida spp. To- 1, To- 3, To- 5, Na- 13 and one A. caviae sp. To- 4 capable of good growth on toluene were selected for fu rther study. All five bacteria were capable of growth on toluene, benzoic acid, <b>m-toluic</b> <b>acid,</b> ethylbenzene, pseudocumene, m - and p-xylene and m - and p -chlorophenol. A. caviae To- 4 alone was capable of growth on phenol and naphthalene. The growth of these bacteria was investigated under different cultural conditions - solid culture, liquid culture, directly added toluene and in the presence of other carbon sources. Growth was b e tter when toluene was supplied in the vapour phase. The toxic effect of directly added toluene was alleviated by the addition of a readily metabolizable carbon source and by the acclimation of the cells to toluene. Strains To- 4 and To- 5 were selected as representative strains of the genera to investigate the removal of toluene. Both of the strains behaved similarly in respect to the utilization of toluene and the utilization of toluene was dependent on the availability of toluene and oxygen. The optimum pH for growth of all the isolates in the presence of toluene was between pH 5. 8 to pH 7. 4. All five isolates showed greater meta activity thanortho activity in degrading toluene. However following growth on non-aromatic substrates the Pseudomonas spp. showed meta activity and the Aeromonassp. showed ortho activity. A large plasmid band (85 - 120 kb) was detected in all the P seudomonasspp. following growth on aromatic and non-aromatic substrates. The stra in A. caviae To- 4 did not carry any plasmid following growth on nonaromatic substrates. This stra in carried a large plasmid (85 - 120 kb) only when grown in the presence of toluene. The identification of the plasmid was confirmed by dot blot hybridization using a TOL probe. Restriction analyses of the plasmid DNA of A. caviae To- 4 and P. putida To- 5 were compared to that of the TOL plasmid of P. putida NCIB 10432 and the presence of specifi sequences of the TOL plasmid were confirmed by Southern hybridization using both a digoxigenin-labelled and a radioactively labelled probe.
