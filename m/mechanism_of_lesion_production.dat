40|$|AbstractHit {{and target}} theory is widely {{known as a}} method for {{deriving}} the survival probability of a cell {{from the number of}} deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) strand breaks.

40|$|We {{measured}} the kinetics {{of growth and}} mutagenesis of UV-irradiated DNA of phages S 13 and lambda that were undergoing SOS repair; the kinetics strongly suggest that most of SOS mutagenesis arises from the deamination of cytosine in cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers, producing C [...] T transitions. This occurs because the SOS mechanism bypasses T [...] T dimers promptly, while bypass of cytosine-containing dimers is delayed long enough for deamination to occur. The mutations are thus primarily the product <b>of</b> a faithful <b>mechanism</b> <b>of</b> <b>lesion</b> bypass by a DNA polymerase and are not, as had been generally thought, the product <b>of</b> an error-prone <b>mechanism.</b> All <b>of</b> these observations are explained by the A-rule, which is that adenine nucleotides are inserted noninstructionally opposite DNA lesions...|$|R
30|$|Here, we {{compared}} the protein profiles of spl 5 mutant and WT by 2 -DE and found that 14 proteins were differentially accumulated between WT and spl 5. Among these 14 proteins, 7 were up-regulated and 7 were down-regulated, respectively, in spl 5. The proteins up-regulated in spl 5 are those involved in defense response or PCD, and the proteins down-regulated in spl 5 involved in amino acid metabolism and photosynthesis. Interestingly, a clear correlation between levels of protein accumulation and levels of gene expression (or induction) was observed for the 7 up-regulated proteins in spl 5. However, a corresponding correlation was not observed for the 7 down-regulated proteins in spl 5. Together, our results may help to understand molecular <b>mechanisms</b> <b>of</b> <b>lesion</b> formation in spl 5.|$|R
40|$|Multiple {{sclerosis}} lesion activity concurs {{with the}} extent of inflammation, demyelination and axonal suffering. Pro-inflammatory myeloid cells contribute to lesion development, but the self-limiting nature <b>of</b> <b>lesions</b> implies as yet unidentified anti-inflammatory mechanisms. We addressed the hypothesis that myelin ingestion by myeloid cells induces a foamy appearance and confers anti-inflammatory function. First, we show that myelin-containing foam cells in multiple sclerosis lesions consistently express a series of anti-inflammatory molecules while lacking pro-inflammatory cytokines. Second, unique location-dependent cytokine and membrane receptor expression profiles imply functional specialization allowing for differential responses to micro-environmental cues. A novel human in vitro model of foamy macrophages functionally confirmed that myelin ingestion induces an anti-inflammatory programme. Foamy macrophages are unable to respond to prototypical inflammatory stimuli but do express molecules involved in suppression of inflammation. These findings provide novel insights into the <b>mechanisms</b> <b>of</b> <b>lesion</b> control and may open new roads to interventio...|$|R
40|$|Three {{strains of}} enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC), {{originally}} isolated from humans and previously shown to cause diarrhea in human volunteers by unknown mechanisms, and one rabbit EPEC strain {{were shown to}} attach intimately to and efface microvilli and cytoplasm from intestinal epithelial cells in both the pig and rabbit intestine. The attaching and effacing activities of these EPEC were demonstrable by light microscopic examination of routine histological sections and by transmission electron microscopy. It was suggested that intact colostrum-deprived newborn pigs and ligated intestinal loops in pigs and rabbits may be useful systems to detect EPEC that have attaching and effacing activities and for studying the pathogenesis of such infections. The lesions (attachment and effacement) produced by EPEC in these systems were multifocal, with considerable animal-to-animal variation {{in response to the}} same strain of EPEC. The EPEC strains also varied in the frequency and extent <b>of</b> <b>lesion</b> <b>production.</b> For example, three human EPEC strains usually caused extensive lesions in rabbit intestinal loops, whereas two other human EPEC strains usually did not produce lesions in this system...|$|R
40|$|Rugby is {{a popular}} contact sport worldwide. Collisions and tackles during matches and {{practices}} often lead to traumatic injuries of the shoulder. This review reports on the epidemiology of injuries, type <b>of</b> <b>lesions</b> and treatment <b>of</b> shoulder injuries, risk factors, such as player position, and return to sport activities. Electronic searches through PubMed (Medline), EMBASE, and Cochrane Library retrieved studies concerning shoulder injuries in rugby players. Data regarding incidence, type and <b>mechanisms</b> <b>of</b> <b>lesion,</b> risk factors and return to sport were extracted and analyzed. The main reported data were incidence, <b>mechanism</b> <b>of</b> injury and type <b>of</b> <b>lesion.</b> Most <b>of</b> the studies report tackle as the main event responsible for shoulder trauma (between 50 % and 85 %), while the main lesions reported were Bankart lesions, Superior Labral tear from Anterior to Posterior (SLAP tears), anterior dislocation and rotator cuff tears.

40|$|Different {{methods of}} {{inducing}} experimental brain lesions {{can result in}} distinct neuropathological sequelae. This could be of consequence in attempts to establish animal models of recovery of function following stroke, as differences in the progression <b>of</b> experimental <b>lesion</b> pathology may {{have an impact on}} the magnitude and rate of recovery of function observable with any particular lesioning method. In the present study, a novel method of producing a focal ischaemic lesion by intracortical microinjection of endothelin- 1 (ET- 1) was compared with excitotoxic (microinjection of quinolinic acid) and mechanical (aspiration) lesioning procedures. Lesions were unilateral and were targeted at the forelimb representation zone in sensorimotor cortex. It was found that all three types <b>of</b> <b>lesion</b> had an essentially identical effect with regard to reaching accuracy in a paw-reaching task. All lesioned animals displayed a similar, significant long-term deficit in reaching accuracy and limited degree of recovery relative to sham animals. Off-line analysis of the performance of animals during post-lesion week 9 indicated that animals in each lesion group also displayed a similar deficit. The current results suggest that the spontaneous behavioural consequences <b>of</b> a unilateral <b>lesion</b> <b>of</b> FL in the rat appear to be independent of the nature <b>of</b> <b>lesion</b> <b>production.</b> However, the increased face validity of an ET- 1 -induced lesion, coupled with the ease <b>of</b> control <b>of</b> <b>lesion</b> placement and extent offered by this technique make for a potentially important animal model for research into drug effects on recovery of function following stroke...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Atherosclerosis, a multi-factorial disease, is {{the main}} {{determinant}} of cardiovascular disease (CVD) leading to high mortality and morbidity in westernized countries. Gene polymorphisms and gene expression related to the atherosclerosis process can be identified using a genome-wide approach or looking for candidate disease-causing genes. METHODS: Using genome wide strategy or candidate gene approach various genes, including paraoxonase genes, which are involved in lipid metabolism, oxidation, inflammation and coagulation, have been associated to atherosclerosis. CONCLUSION: Evaluation of gene polymorphisms, together with traditional and novel biochemical parameters, may help identify individuals at a high risk for CVD. Genetic characterization of susceptibility genes may also lead to new drugs for atherosclerosis prevention and treatment. In addition, gene expression studies can provide novel insights into the molecular <b>mechanism</b> <b>of</b> <b>lesion</b> development and progression...|$|R
40|$|Pathological lesions in {{the form}} of {{extracellular}} protein deposits, intracellular inclusions and changes in cell morphology occur in the brain in the majority of neurodegenerative disorders. Studies of the presence, distribution, and molecular determinants <b>of</b> these <b>lesions</b> are often used to define individual disorders and to establish the <b>mechanisms</b> <b>of</b> <b>lesion</b> pathogenesis. In most disorders, however, the relationship between the appearance <b>of</b> a <b>lesion</b> and the underlying disease process is unclear. Two hypotheses are proposed which could explain this relationship: (i) lesions are the direct cause of the observed neurodegeneration ('causal' hypothesis); and (ii) lesions are a reaction to neurodegeneration ('reaction' hypothesis). These hypotheses are considered in relation to studies of the morphology and molecular determinants <b>of</b> <b>lesions,</b> the effects <b>of</b> gene mutations, degeneration induced by head injury, the effects of experimentally induced brain lesions, transgenic studies and the degeneration of anatomical pathways.

40|$|Abstract niet beschikbaarIonizing {{radiation}} and ultraviolet radiation (UV) are both physical agents with mutagenic and carcinogenic properties.

In this paper the dose-effect relationships for gamma {{radiation and}} UV at cellular level {{will be used to}} demonstrate the different radiobiological effectiveness of both agents. The results will be discussed in the framework of a biophysical model. This model {{is based on the assumption}} that DNA double-stranded lesions are crucial for the cytotoxic action. After exposure to ionizing radiation, the lesions are fixed immediately following irradiation, but after UV exposure the lethal lesions are recognized only in the next DNA systhesis phase.

40|$|Background: Traumatic injury of {{peripheral}} nerves is {{a worldwide}} problem and {{can result in}} significant disability. Management of peripheral nerve injuries (PNIs) requires accurate localization and the assessment of severity <b>of</b> the <b>lesion.</b> Aim: The {{purpose of this study}} is to analyze the data of patients with PNIs referred for electromyography to a tertiary care hospital. Materials and Methods: This is a retrospective study of clinical and electromyographic data of patients with PNIs seen over a period of eight-years (1999 - 2007) in a tertiary hospital. The data collected included: Demographic data, cause, type <b>of</b> <b>lesion,</b> anatomical location <b>of</b> the <b>lesion,</b> and the <b>mechanism</b> <b>of</b> <b>lesion.</b> Results: During the study period 938 patients were seen with nerve injuries and the distribution of nerve injuries was: PNIs: 1, 165; brachial plexus lesions: 76; and lumbar plexus lesions: 7. The mean age was 31. 8 years (range 2 - 81 years) and the male to female ratio was 2. 4 : 1. The most frequent nerve injuries were ulnar nerve in the upper extremity and sciatic nerve in the lower extremity. The most common cause of nerve injury was motor vehicle accidents.

40|$|Background: Lupus {{erythematosus}} (LE) is {{a chronic}} inflammatory disease. Presence of type 1 cytokines in cutaneous discoid lesions {{suggests that they}} may be critical for induction, development and maintenance of these manifestations. Type 2 cytokines in combination with local interferon gamma (INF-gamma) are thought {{to be related to the}} physiopathology of cutaneous LE. Cytokines profiles are still unknown in oral LE lesions. Materials and Methods: Expression of Th 1 and Th 2 cytokines (including IL- 4, IL- 5, IL- 6, IL- 10, IL- 12, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) and INF-gamma was investigated and compared in 29 biopsies of intra-oral (sun-protected) and labial <b>lesions</b> (sun-exposed) <b>of</b> LE using immunohistochemistry. Results: Inflammatory infiltrate <b>of</b> LE <b>lesions</b> was strongly positive for IFN-gamma (97 %) and TNF-alpha (90 %), both Th 1 type cytokines. Interleukin- 10, a Th 2 cytokine was also strongly expressed. Other cytokines were only mildly positive. Cytokines patterns were similar in intra-oral (sun-covered) and labial (sun-exposed) LE lesions. Conclusions: Oral LE lesions are associated with both type 1 and type 2 cytokines, characterized by stronger expression of INF-gamma, TNF-alpha and IL- 10. These findings suggest that although ultraviolet (UV) light is involved in the induction <b>of</b> LE <b>lesions,</b> <b>mechanisms</b> <b>of</b> <b>lesions</b> formation may be similar in sun-exposed as well as sun-covered areas...|$|R
40|$|Drug {{hypersensitivity}} reactions (RHD) {{are those}} that present clinically as allergic. They can or cannot involve an immunologic <b>mechanism</b> <b>of</b> <b>lesion.</b> They are frequent and, occasionally, life threatening. Patients with RHD repeat the reaction when they are re-exposed to the drug, limiting the therapeutic options and exposing them to more expensive and toxic drugs. It is difficult to identify the responsible drug when the reaction was not recent or when it occurred {{in the context of}} therapy with multiple drugs or confusing concurrent diseases. The diagnosis should be based on clinical history, followed by drug skin tests and drug provocation tests.

40|$|Monkeypox virus (MPXV) is {{considered}} the most significant human public health threat in the genus Orthopoxvirus since the eradication of variola virus (the causative agent of smallpox). MPXV is a zoonotic agent endemic to forested areas of Central and Western Africa. In 2003, MPXV caused an outbreak in the United States due to the importation of infected African rodents, and subsequent sequential infection of North American prairie dogs (Cynomys ludovicianus) and humans. In previous studies, the prairie dog MPXV model has successfully shown to be very useful for understanding MPXV since the model emulates key characteristics of human monkeypox disease. In humans, percutaneous exposure to animals has been documented but the primary method of human-to-human MPXV transmission is postulated to be by respiratory route. Only a few animal model studies of MPXV transmission have been reported. Herein, we show that MPXV infected prairie dogs are able to transmit the virus to naive animals through multiple transmission routes. All secondarily exposed animals were infected with MPXV {{during the course of}} the study. Notably, animals secondarily exposed appeared to manifest more severe disease; however, the disease course was very similar to those of experimentally challenged animals including inappetence leading to weight loss, development <b>of</b> <b>lesions,</b> <b>production</b> <b>of</b> orthopoxvirus antibodies and shedding of similar levels or in some instances higher levels of MPXV from the oral cavity.

40|$|Aberrant DNA {{replication}}, {{defects in}} the protection, and restart of stalled replication forks are major causes of genome instability in all organisms. Replication fork reversal {{is emerging as}} an evolutionarily conserved physiological response for restart of stalled forks. Escherichia coli RecG, RuvAB, and RecA proteins {{have been shown to}} reverse the model replication fork structures in vitro. However, the pathways and the mechanisms by which Mycobacterium tuberculosis, a slow growing human pathogen, responds to different types of replication stress and DNA damage are unclear. Here, we show that M. tuberculosis RecG rescues E. coli Delta recG cells from replicative stress. The purified M. tuberculosis RecG (MtRecG) and RuvAB(MtRuvAB) proteins catalyze fork reversal of model replication fork structures with and without a leading strand single-stranded DNA gap. Interestingly, single-stranded DNA-binding protein suppresses the MtRecG- and MtRuvAB-mediated fork reversal with substrates that contain lagging strand gap. Notably, our comparative studies with fork structures containing template damage and template switching <b>mechanism</b> <b>of</b> <b>lesion</b> bypass reveal that MtRecG but not MtRuvAB or MtRecA is proficient in driving the fork reversal.

40|$|Spreading depolarizations (SD) are {{waves of}} abrupt, near-complete {{breakdown}} of neuronal transmembrane ion gradients, {{are the largest}} possible pathophysiologic disruption of viable cerebral gray matter, and are a crucial <b>mechanism</b> <b>of</b> <b>lesion</b> development. Spreading depolarizations are increasingly recorded during multimodal neuromonitoring in neurocritical care as a causal biomarker providing a diagnostic summary measure of metabolic failure and excitotoxic injury. Focal ischemia causes spreading depolarization within minutes. Further spreading depolarizations arise for hours to days due to energy supply-demand mismatch in viable tissue. Spreading depolarizations exacerbate neuronal injury through prolonged ionic breakdown and spreading depolarization-related hypoperfusion (spreading ischemia). Local duration of the depolarization indicates local tissue energy status and risk of injury. Regional electrocorticographic monitoring affords even remote detection of injury because spreading depolarizations propagate widely from ischemic or metabolically stressed zones; characteristic patterns, including temporal clusters of spreading depolarizations and persistent depression of spontaneous cortical activity, can be recognized and quantified. Here, we describe the experimental basis for interpreting these patterns and illustrate their translation to human disease. We further provide consensus recommendations for electrocorticographic methods to record, classify, and score spreading depolarizations and associated spreading depressions. These methods offer distinct advantages over other neuromonitoring modalities and allow for future refinement through less invasive and more automated approaches...|$|R
40|$|Tuberous {{sclerosis}} complex (TSC) is an {{autosomal dominant}} disorder characterized by mutations in Tsc 1 or Tsc 2 {{that lead to}} mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) hyperactivity. Patients with TSC suffer from intractable seizures resulting from cortical malformations known as tubers, but research into how these tubers form has been limited {{because of the lack}} of an animal model. To address this limitation, we used in utero electroporation to knock out Tsc 1 in selected neuronal populations in mice heterozygous for a mutant Tsc 1 allele that eliminates the Tsc 1 gene product at a precise developmental time point. Knockout of Tsc 1 in single cells led to increased mTOR activity and soma size in the affected neurons. The mice exhibited white matter heterotopic nodules and discrete cortical tuber-like lesions containing cytomegalic and multinucleated neurons with abnormal dendritic trees resembling giant cells. Cortical tubers in the mutant mice did not exhibit signs of gliosis. Furthermore, phospho-S 6 immunoreactivity was not upregulated in Tsc 1 -null astrocytes despite a lower seizure threshold. Collectively, these data suggest that a double-hit strategy to eliminate Tsc 1 in discrete neuronal populations generates TSC-associated cortical lesions, providing a model to uncover the <b>mechanisms</b> <b>of</b> <b>lesion</b> formation and cortical hyperexcitability. In addition, the absence of glial reactivity argues against a contribution of astrocytes to lesion-associated hyperexcitability...|$|R

40|$|Cellular DNA {{is under}} {{constant}} attack from numerous exogenous and endogenous agents. The resulting DNA lesions, if not repaired timely, could stall DNA replication, leading to genome instability. To {{better understand the}} <b>mechanism</b> <b>of</b> DNA <b>lesion</b> replication at the biochemical level, we have attempted to reconstitute this process in Xenopus egg extracts, the only eukaryotic in vitro system that relies solely on cellular proteins for DNA replication. By using a plasmid DNA that carries a site-specific apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) lesion as template, {{we have found that}} DNA replication is stalled one nucleotide before the lesion. The stalling is temporary and the lesion is eventually replicated by both an error-prone mechanism and an error-free mechanism. This is the first biochemical system that recapitulates efficiently and faithfully all major aspects <b>of</b> DNA <b>lesion</b> replication. It has provided the first direct evidence for the existence <b>of</b> an error-free <b>lesion</b> replication mechanism and also demonstrated that the error-prone mechanism is a major contributor to lesion replication...|$|R
