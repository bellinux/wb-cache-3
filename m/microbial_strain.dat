40|$|Background: Red ginseng (RG) is {{processed}} from Panax ginseng via several methods including heat treatment, mild acid hydrolysis, and microbial conversion {{to transform the}} major ginsenosides into minor ginsenosides, which have greater pharmaceutical activities. During the fermentation process using <b>microbial</b> <b>strains</b> in a machine for making red ginseng, a change of composition occurs after heating. Therefore, we confirmed that fermentation had occurred using only <b>microbial</b> <b>strains</b> and evaluated {{the changes in the}} ginsenosides and their chemical composition. Methods: To confirm the fermentation by <b>microbial</b> <b>strains,</b> the fermented red ginseng was made with <b>microbial</b> <b>strains</b> (w-FRG) or without <b>microbial</b> <b>strains</b> (n-FRG), and the fermentation process was performed to tertiary fermentation. The changes in the ginsenoside composition of the self-manufactured FRG using the machine were evaluated using HPLC, and the 20 ginsenosides were analyzed. Additionally, we investigated changes of the reducing sugar and polyphenol contents during fermentation process. Results: In the fermentation process, ginsenosides Re, Rg 1, and Rb 1 decreased but ginsenosides Rh 1, F 2, Rg 3, and Compound Y (C. Y) increased in primary FRG more than in the raw ginseng and RG. The content of phenolic compounds was high in FRG and the highest in the tertiary w-FRG. Moreover, the reducing sugar content was approximately three times higher in the tertiary w-FRG than in the other n-FRG. Conclusion: As the results indicate, we confirmed the changes in the ginsenoside content and the role of <b>microbial</b> <b>strains</b> in the fermentation process...|$|R
5000|$|The [...] "eco-evo" [...] {{perspective}} on pathogen-host interactions emphasizes the influences ecology {{and the environment}} on pathogen evolution. The dynamic genomic factors such as gene loss, gene gain and genome rearrangement are all strongly influenced by changes in the ecological niche that a particular <b>microbial</b> <b>strain</b> resides in. Microbes may switch from being pathogenic and non-pathogenic due to changing environments. Studies of the plague, Yersinia pestis, are prominent demonstration of how over time a microbe, in this case Yersinia pestis, evolves from a gastrointestinal pathogen to a very highly pathogenic microbe through dynamic genomic events. These flips between being pathogenic and non-pathogenic status and how they occurred with respect to ecological or environmental changes are important in novel therapeutic development to combat microbial infections.|$|E
50|$|Microbial {{inoculants}} are {{addition of}} microbes into {{a plant that}} would essentially help the plant grow by introducing nutrients, and stimulating plant growth. The preparation in mass quantities of any inoculum is performed by a process called fermentation. The first step to making it is by selecting a <b>microbial</b> <b>strain,</b> and letting it grow and increase in bacterial concentration. The greater the bacterial concentration the greater the fermentation yield would be (fermentation yield is ratio of bacterial concentration to mass of substrate) The bacterial concentration can be measured by monitoring the turbidity, wet or dry weight, or residual nutrient concentration. After the inoculant is ready then it gets transferred in a fermentor where oxygen and temperature most be highly monitored {{for the survival of}} the microbes and it can vary depending on the microbe that is being used. After enough time has passed for the microbes to be properly incubated the product is ready to be extracted purified and packaged.|$|E
50|$|Fermentation is a {{reaction}} where sugar {{can be converted}} into a gas, alcohols or acids. Microorganisms like yeast and bacteria are used to massively produce the many things. Drinking alcohol also known as ethanol is produced by yeast and bacteria. Ethanol {{can also be used}} as a fuel source. The drinking alcohol is produced from natural sugars like glucose. Carbon dioxide is produced as a side product in this reaction and {{can be used to make}} bread, and can also be used to carbonate beverages. Alcoholic beverages like beer and wine are fermented by microorganisms when there is no oxygen present. In this process, once there is enough alcohol and carbon dioxide around in the media the yeast start to die due to the environment becoming toxic to them. There are many strains of yeast and bacteria that can tolerate different amounts of alcohol around in their environment before it becoming toxic, thus one can obtain different alcohol levels in beer and wine, just by selecting a different <b>microbial</b> <b>strain.</b> Most yeast can tolerate between 10 and 15 percent alcohol, but there are some strains that can tolerate up to 21 percent alcohol.|$|E

40|$|The {{increasing}} demand of biochemical supply for various industries has spurred {{the development of}} metabolic engineering to find the optimal design of the microbial cell factories.
