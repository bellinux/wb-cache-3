2500|$|The Anatidae are the {{biological}} family of birds that includes ducks, geese, and swans. The {{family has a}} cosmopolitan distribution, occurring on all the world's continents. [...] These birds are adapted for swimming, floating on the water surface, {{and in some cases}} diving in at least shallow water. The family contains around 146 species in 43 genera. (The <b>magpie</b> <b>goose</b> is no longer considered {{to be part of the}} Anatidae, but is placed in its own family Anseranatidae.) ...|$|E
2500|$|Among {{crustacean}} prey, large mud crabs of {{the genus}} Scylla are frequently consumed, especially in mangrove habitats. Ground-living birds, such as the emu (Dromaius novaehollandiae) and different kinds of water birds, especially the <b>magpie</b> <b>goose</b> (Anseranas semipalmata), are the most commonly preyed upon birds, due to the increased chance of encounter. Even swift-flying birds and bats may be snatched if {{close to the surface}} of water, as well as wading birds while these are patrolling the shore looking for food, even down {{to the size of a}} common sandpiper (Actitis hypoleucos). Mammalian prey of juveniles and subadults are usually as large as the smaller species of ungulates, such as the greater mouse-deer (Tragulus napu) and hog deer (Hyelaphus porcinus). Various mammalian species including monkeys (i.e. crab-eating macaques (Macaca fascicularis), long-tailed macaques (M. fascicularis) & proboscis monkeys (Nasalis larvatus),), gibbons, wallabies, mongoose, civets, jackals (Canis ssp.), turtles, flying foxes (Pteropus ssp.), hares (Lepus ssp.), rodents, badgers, otters, fishing cats (Prionailurus viverrinus) and chevrotains are readily taken when encountered. A rare incidence of an adult, 2.6 m Saltwater Crocodile preying on an Indian Porcupine (Hystrix indica) was reported from Sri Lanka. [...] Unlike fish, crabs and aquatic creatures, mammals and birds are usually found only sporadically in or next to water so crocodiles seem to search for places where such prey may be concentrated, i.e. the water under a tree holding a flying fox colony or spots where herds of water buffaloes feed, in order to capture small animals disturbed by the buffalo or (if a large adult crocodile is hunting) weaker members of the buffalo herd.|$|E
50|$|Waterbirds include large {{populations of}} <b>magpie</b> <b>geese,</b> {{wandering}} whistling ducks, green pygmy geese, comb-crested jacana, black-necked stork, Australian pelicans, little black cormorant, Australian darter, nankeen night herons, pied herons, black bittern, sarus crane and brolga.|$|R
50|$|Kakadu Wetlands is {{an exhibit}} of {{reptiles}} which features two crocodile pools for both Fresh and Saltwater crocodiles. A crocodile feeding show is held daily. Kakadu Wetlands {{is also home to}} a collection of turtles, <b>magpie</b> <b>geese,</b> water hens and brolgas.|$|R
50|$|The park {{is known}} for its populations of waterbirds such as the brolga, sarus crane, black-necked stork, comb-crested jacana and <b>magpie</b> <b>geese.</b> In the {{woodland}} and grassland area the agile wallaby, northern nailtail wallaby and Australian bustard may be found.|$|R
5000|$|Eoanseranas handae, also {{sometimes}} referred to as Hand's dawn <b>magpie</b> <b>goose,</b> is an extinct genus and species of bird, in the <b>magpie</b> <b>goose</b> family, from the Late Oligocene or Early Miocene of northern Australia. It was described from fossil material (a left coracoid and two left scapulae) found at a Carl Creek Limestone site at Riversleigh, in the Boodjamulla National Park of north-western Queensland. It was slightly smaller than its perceived descendant, the extant <b>magpie</b> <b>goose.</b> The generic name comes from the Greek eos (“dawn”) and Anseranas (the genus of the monotypic <b>magpie</b> <b>goose).</b> The specific epithet honours Australian palaeontologist Suzanne Hand, a prominent researcher of the fossil faunas of Riversleigh.|$|E

50|$|When the {{men would}} {{come back from the}} <b>magpie</b> <b>goose</b> hunt, they would be craving murnyaŋ foods after having eaten so much meat and eggs. Meanwhile, the women, {{children}} and old people back in the camps would be looking forward to gonyil, <b>magpie</b> <b>goose</b> meat and eggs, after eating so much murnyaŋ.|$|E
50|$|All {{waterfowl}} hunters {{require a}} permit to hunt and may only do say during the declared open season. Waterfowl includes the following species: <b>magpie</b> <b>geese,</b> Pacific black duck, wandering whistling duck, plumed whistling duck, grey teal, pink-eared duck, hardhead duck, maned duck.|$|R
50|$|The area now {{occupied}} by Royal Pines resort once supported established Eucalyptus tereticornis forests and wetlands with patches of rainforest. Jabiru, <b>magpie</b> <b>geese</b> {{and a variety}} of water birds used these wetlands which stretched from Nerang to near Burleigh Heads along the floodplain of the Nerang River Valley and Mudgeereebah and Bonogin Creeks. This ecosystem was akin to Kakadu with lagoons of lilypads, swamp rainforest and gnarled old paperbark forest filled with palms. In the 1980s prior to the development of Royal Pines resort, farmland with remnant degraded wetlands and some forest remained, and jabiru, spoonbills, <b>magpie</b> <b>geese</b> {{and a variety of}} other birds could be seen there. Development in recent decades has led to the loss of most remnant natural vegetation.|$|R
50|$|More than 300,000 native {{trees have}} been planted {{over the past}} two generations. This has created an {{environment}} capable of sustaining native animals such as koalas, emus, kangaroos, <b>magpie</b> <b>geese,</b> echidnas, possums, and waterbirds - all of which can be seen within the crater walls of Tower Hill.|$|R

50|$|One of {{the best}} known species is the Chinese water chestnut, Eleocharis dulcis. These plants bear tubers on their {{rhizomes}} which may be peeled and eaten raw or boiled.

5000|$|The bay’s {{seasonally}} flooded coastal plains {{have been}} classified by BirdLife International as an Important Bird Area (IBA). [...] The area {{covered by the}} IBA is 45,811 ha.

50|$|Before European {{settlement}} of the area around Port Phillip in the mid-19th century, the historic Carrum Carrum Swamp stretched from what is now Mordialloc in the north to Frankston in the south. The 4000 ha swamp’s freshwater and brackish wetlands supported many animals and plants, including brolgas and <b>magpie</b> <b>geese</b> which are now locally extinct.|$|R

50|$|Anseranatidae, the magpie-geese, is a {{biological}} family of waterbirds. The only living species, the <b>magpie</b> <b>goose,</b> is a resident breeder in northern Australia and in southern New Guinea.|$|E
50|$|Up to 8500 waterbirds {{have been}} {{recorded}} using the bay, with numbers of pied herons being globally significant. A waterbird breeding colony in the mangroves {{near the mouth of}} the Buckingham River contained 5500 birds in 1999, predominantly pied herons and intermediate egrets. Other birds for which the site is significant are brolgas and <b>magpie</b> <b>geese.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The swamp is {{classified}} as an Important Bird Area. [...] It is a major breeding area for <b>magpie</b> <b>geese.</b> Other abundant waterbirds include wandering whistling ducks, Pacific black ducks and green pygmy geese. There are breeding colonies of royal spoonbills, little pied and little black cormorants, and darters. Land adjacent to the swamp supports {{one of the largest}} breeding populations of the hooded parrot outside the Katherine area.|$|R
50|$|To {{the east}} is the egret colony wetlands.

50|$|The {{black swan}} is {{unlike any other}} Australian bird, {{although}} in poor light and at long range it may be confused with a <b>magpie</b> <b>goose</b> in flight. However, the black swan can be distinguished by its much longer neck and slower wing beat.|$|E
50|$|The brolga and <b>magpie</b> <b>goose</b> find {{habitat in}} the sedge swamps of Bowling Green Bay. The park {{is one of}} the best places to see the rarely {{observed}} zitting cisticola. Other bird species include the whistling duck, black duck, spoonbill, ibis and jabiru. Crocodiles are found in the estuarine and swamp areas.|$|E
5000|$|The {{site has}} been {{identified}} as a 1062 km2 Important Bird Area (IBA) by BirdLife International because the floodplain supports up to 500,000 <b>magpie</b> <b>geese</b> and over 1% of the world population of pied herons. The intertidal mudflats of the bay support large numbers of waders, or shorebirds, especially great knots. [...] Other waterbirds recorded breeding in the area in relatively large numbers include egrets, little pied cormorants, nankeen night herons and royal spoonbills.|$|R
