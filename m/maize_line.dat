40|$|Background: Maize was {{originally}} domesticated in a tropical environment {{but is now}} widely cultivated at temperate latitudes. Temperate and tropical maize populations have diverged both genotypically and phenotypically. Tropical <b>maize</b> <b>lines</b> grown in temperate environments usually exhibit delayed flowering, pollination, and seed set, which reduces their grain yield relative to temperate adapted <b>maize</b> <b>lines.</b> One potential mechanism by which temperate maize may have adapted to a new environment is novel transposable element insertions, which can influence gene regulation. Recent advances in sequencing technology {{have made it possible}} to study variation in transposon content and insertion location in large sets of <b>maize</b> <b>lines.</b> Results: In total, 274, 408 non-redundant TEs (NRTEs) were identified using resequencing data generated from 83 <b>maize</b> inbred <b>lines.</b> The locations of DNA TEs and copia-superfamily retrotransposons showed significant positive correlations with gene density and genetic recombination rates, whereas gypsy-superfamily retrotransposons showed a negative correlation with these two parameters. Compared to tropical maize, temperate maize had fewer unique NRTEs but higher insertion frequency, lower background recombination rates, and higher linkage disequilibrium, with more NRTEs close to flowering and stress-related genes in the genome. Association mapping demonstrated that the presence/ absence of 48 NRTEs was associated with flowering time and that expression of neighboring genes differed between haplotypes where a NRTE was present or absent. Conclusions: This study suggests that NRTEs may have {{played an important role in}} creating the variation in gene regulation that enabled the rapid adaptation of maize to diverse environments...|$|R

40|$|AbstractFusarium verticillioides {{was labeled}} with DsRed via Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated {{transformation}} to examine differences in colonization and reactions of resistant and susceptible inbred <b>lines</b> of <b>maize</b> (Zea mays L.). The extent of systemic colonization of F. verticillioides in roots from <b>maize</b> <b>lines</b> either resistant or {{susceptible to the}} fungus was studied by visualizing the red fluorescence produced by the fungus expressing DsRed. The difference in quantities of colony forming units (CFU) in roots and basal stems, production of fumonisin B 1, and pH of root were determined.

40|$|Maize is a {{socially}} and economically important crop in Africa (and worldwide) that is severely affected by many fungal pathogens. The pathogen Fusarium verticillioides causes Fusarium ear rot in maize, {{a disease that}} greatly reduces {{quantity and quality of}} annual maize yields. The pathogen produces mycotoxins called fumonisins, which have been linked to adverse health effects in both humans and animals. Maize produces terpenoid phytoalexins, which are antimicrobial compounds that directly reduce the growth of many fungal pathogens including F. verticillioides. Two families of maize phytoalexins, termed kauralexins and zealexins, have been characterized. Key genes putatively involved in the biosynthetic pathway of these phytoalexins have been identified from the rice model and subsequent studies on maize. This research aimed to evaluate the correlation between phytoalexin accumulation and fungal growth in diverse southern African <b>maize</b> <b>lines</b> in response to F. verticillioides inoculation. <b>Maize</b> <b>lines</b> were inoculated with F. verticillioides using a seed soak inoculation method and grown in vitro for up to two weeks. The harvested tissue was analysed for fungal growth using quantitative PCR, putative phytoalexin biosynthetic gene expression using RT-qPCR and phytoalexin accumulation using gas-chromatography mass spectrometry. Furthermore, an endophyte growing in one of the <b>maize</b> <b>lines</b> was isolated and identified as Trichoderma asperellum. Trichoderma spp. are used as biocontrol agents against many fungal pathogens, although research on the specific antagonistic effect of T. asperellum on F. verticillioides is limited. Phytoalexin accumulation in maize containing endophytic T. asperellum was compared to maize inoculated with F. verticillioides. In vitro competition assays were performed to analyse the antagonistic effect of T. asprellum on F. verticillioides. Results from this study show that inoculation of <b>maize</b> <b>lines</b> with F. verticillioides induces the accumulation of total phytoalexins, and more specifically the accumulation of total kauralexins. Putative phytoalexin biosynthetic genes are also up-regulated in response to inoculation. Maize growing with a T. asperellum endophyte accumulated phytoalexins to the same levels as F. verticillioides, suggesting that T. asperellum induces a defence response that 'primes' the plant for further infection. In vitro competition assays between F. verticillioides and T. asperellum showed that T. asperellum significantly inhibits F. verticillioides growth. These results will aid in the identification of <b>maize</b> <b>lines</b> that can be bred with increased resistance to F. verticillioides with the goal to reduce F. verticillioides incidence in southern Africa.

The elucidation of its genetic architecture, accomplished by exploring quantitative trait loci and useful alleles in various lines across numerous breeding programs, is therefore of great interest. The present study aimed to characterize subtropical <b>maize</b> <b>lines</b> using high-quality SNPs distributed throughout the genome. Results We genotyped a panel of 240 subtropical elite <b>maize</b> inbred <b>lines</b> and carried out linkage disequilibrium, genetic diversity, population structure, and principal component analyses on the generated SNP data. The mean SNP distance across the genome was 70 Kb. The genome had both high and low linkage disequilibrium (LD) regions; the latter were dominant in areas near the gene-rich telomeric portions where recombination is frequent. A total of 252 haplotype blocks, {{ranging in size from}} 1 to 15. 8 Mb, were identified. Slow LD decay (200 - 300 Kb) at r 2 <= 0. 1 across all chromosomes explained the selection of favorable traits around low LD regions in different breeding programs. The association mapping panel was characterized by strong population substructure. Genotypes were grouped into three distinct clusters with a mean genetic dissimilarity coefficient of 0. 36. Conclusions The genotyped panel of subtropical <b>maize</b> <b>lines</b> characterized in this study should be useful for association mapping of agronomically important genes.

40|$|Abstract only availableGlobal warming causing {{changes in}} weather {{patterns}} is making drought a more frequent occurrence. Drought {{is a major}} limiting factor of maize production worldwide. To maintain high production levels, {{it is important to}} identify <b>maize</b> <b>lines</b> which are tolerant to water-stress conditions. A significant trait in drought tolerance is an extensive root system. Root systems in maize are composed of not only below ground roots but also above ground roots. These above ground roots are commonly known as brace roots, and they function to keep the plant upright and provide a surface for nutrient and water uptake and gas exchange. Preliminary studies have demonstrated correlations between brace root architecture and tassel branching. There is a negative correlation between central spike length and number of nodes with brace roots. Studies also indicate brace roots emerge from juvenile nodes The objective {{of this study is to}} examine these relationships on a set of 25 diverse <b>maize</b> <b>lines.</b> Leaf traits were measured to identify juvenile, transitional, and adult leaves. These data will be used to determine if juvenile nodes give rise to brace roots. Various measurements of tassel structure will be gathered and statistically analyzed for relationships between tassel traits and brace root architecture. Examining tassel structure and juvenile node number may help in the selection of <b>maize</b> <b>lines</b> with an increased number of brace roots which allow for adaptation to water-stressed environments...|$|R

MethodsA custom {micro}parafloTM microfluidic array containing release version 10. 1 plant miRNA probes ([URL] was used to discover salt stress-responsive miRNAs using the differences in miRNA expression between the salt-tolerant maize inbred line NC 286 ' and the salt-sensitive <b>maize</b> <b>line</b> Huangzao 4 '. Key ResultsmiRNA microarray hybridization revealed that a total of 98 miRNAs, from 27 plant miRNA families, had significantly altered expression after salt treatment.

Interestingly, 18 miRNAs were found which were only expressed in the salt-tolerant <b>maize</b> <b>line,</b> and 25 miRNAs that showed a delayed regulation pattern in the salt-sensitive line. A gene model was proposed that showed how miRNAs could regulate the abiotic stress-associated process and the gene networks coping with the stress. ConclusionsSalt-responsive miRNAs are involved in the regulation of metabolic, morphological and physiological adaptations of maize seedlings at the post-transcriptional level.

As all GM plants {{the risk for}} the consumer and the environment of these plants has to be assessed. One aspect of those studies is to consider {{the effects of the}} new plants on non-target organisms occurring in or next to the field. Therefore the exposition to new plant ingredients and their hazard for the organisms have to be studied in a risk assessment. To get robust and comparable results, working with surrogate species seems to be the best way. In this project arthropods of the herb layer and earthworms were chosen due to their important role in the field to show advantages and disadvantages of different approaches. Part A of the project dealt with the effects of growing the stacked <b>maize</b> <b>line</b> in a field release experiment on the biocoenosis of the soil, the herb layer and the male flowers. To study those, the Bt line was compared during three consecutive growing seasons to its near isogenic line, two conventional lines and a soil insecticidal treatment against Diabrotica virgifera virgifera. All sampled organisms were determined to family or species level and the data statistically analyzed. The measured communities showed no effect of the GM <b>maize</b> <b>line.</b> An influence of the conventional varieties could be observed. The GM <b>maize</b> <b>line</b> matched with the near isogenic line. Trigonotylus caelestialium (KIRKALDY) could be identified as the most abundant plant bug in the field. Therefore it was chosen as a surrogate species in part B of the project. Additionally the earthworm Lumbricus terrestris LINNAEUS as an established model was chosen and both studied in the laboratory. A concept to breed and keep T. caelestialium under controlled conditions was established and the fate of the ingested Cry proteins studied.

New or adapted pest management strategies urgently require {{a better understanding of}} the multitrophic interaction in the rhizosphere. This study aimed to investigate the effect of WCR root feeding on the microbial communities colonizing the maize rhizosphere. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In a greenhouse experiment, maize lines KWS 13, KWS 14, KWS 15 and MON 88017 were grown in three different soil types in presence and in absence of WCR larvae. Bacterial and fungal community structures were analyzed by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) of the 16 S rRNA gene and ITS fragments, PCR amplified from the total rhizosphere community DNA. DGGE bands with increased intensity were excised from the gel, cloned and sequenced in order to identify specific bacteria responding to WCR larval feeding. DGGE fingerprints showed that the soil type and the <b>maize</b> <b>line</b> influenced the fungal and bacterial communities inhabiting the maize rhizosphere. WCR larval feeding affected the rhiyosphere microbial populations in a soil type and <b>maize</b> <b>line</b> dependent manner. DGGE band sequencing revealed an increased abundance of Acinetobacter calcoaceticus in the rhizosphere of several maize lines in all soil types upon WCR larval feeding. CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE: The effects of both rhizosphere and WCR larval feeding seemed to be stronger on bacterial communities than on fungi. Bacterial and fungal community shifts in response to larval feeding were most likely due to changes of root exudation patterns. The increased abundance of A. calcoaceticus suggested that phenolic compounds were released upon WCR wounding...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Maize (Zea mays L.) is an {{important}} staple food crop in sub-Saharan Africa providing food security to millions of people. Fusarium verticillioides is {{an important}} fungal pathogen that infects maize and causes 'Fusarium Ear Rot' which decreases maize kernel yield and quality. In addition, the fungus produces mycotoxins which contaminate the kernel and upon ingestion have negative health consequences for both people and livestock. To this date, {{there is still no}} African <b>maize</b> <b>line</b> completely resistant to infection by F. verticillioides. In this study, an African <b>maize</b> <b>line,</b> Zea mays CML 144, was infected with F. verticillioides using a soak-seed inoculation method and grown for two weeks under controlled conditions. Analysis of the morphological characteristics showed that compared to the control (mock-infected) maize, infected maize seedlings displayed signs of stunting with leaves shorter & thinner while roots were shorter and displayed visible signs of rotting. Control and infected maize plants were also characterised physiologically and biochemically. Electrolyte leakage experiments were conducted on the meristem regions of the plants after week one and two of infection and showed that leakage increased over time in both control and infected samples with no significant difference observed between the two groups. Biochemical characterisation by analysing superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and glutathione reductase (GR) antioxidant enzymes showed an increase after the two weeks of infection, indicating a defense response by the plants in response to infection by the fungal pathogen. RNA-sequencing, the main aim of this study was conducted on control and infected plants after two weeks of infection to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) involved in F. verticillioides infection. The Illumina NextSeq 500 platform was used to sequence the transcriptome and quantify changes in gene expression. Analysis of the RNA-seq data using the Tuxedo suite of protocols revealed significant DEGs that were both up- and down-regulated in the infected samples compared to the control. Data analysis was conducted using the DNA subway online bioinformatics tool and these results were compared to those obtained using a separate analysis which also incorporated the Tuxedo suite of protocols. Bioinformatic analysis on the RNA-seq DEGs were performed using the agriGO analysis tool which revealed three significant Gene Ontology (GO) terms for both the up- and down-regulated genes, respectively, with the 'response to stimulus' GO-term (within the down-regulated genes) being of specific interest. Other GO-terms included response to chemical stimulus, carbohydrate metabolic process and ion bonding, which also {{played a role in the}} defense response when plants were infected by the fungal pathogen. Quantitative Real-Time PCR was performed on five DEGs that were either up- or down-regulated in response to F. verticillioides infection to validate RNA-seq data as well as the GO-analysis results. Quantitative Real-Time PCR was also used as a pre-validation (before RNA-seq) on shrunken- 1, a down-regulated gene found in a previously conducted study. We observed that in response to infection by F. verticillioides, expression of shrunken- 1 was down-regulated, however, this was not shown to be significant (p> 0. 05). The results in the current study and the identification of the genes in Zea mays CML 144 responding to fungal infection will aid in the goal to develop a <b>maize</b> <b>line</b> completely resistant to F. verticillioides in Africa and in particular South Africa. This would provide improved food security and minimise health risks to the population in the long term.

We explored {{to see if the}} activities of gluconeogenic enzymes which appeared in postgerminative growth were proportional to the lipid content in each <b>maize</b> <b>line.</b> This proportionality was found to be valid in lipase, but the two glyoxysomal enzymes, catalase and isocitrate lyase, were the same in the three maize lines irrespective of the lipid content. The results suggest a difference in the genetic control of the gluconeogenic enzymes and a co-selection for high lipid content and high lipase activity through breeding...|$|E
40|$|Maize is {{moderately}} {{sensitive to}} salt stress; therefore, soil salinity {{is a serious}} threat to its production worldwide. Here, excellent salt-tolerant <b>maize</b> inbred <b>line</b> TL 1317 and extremely salt-sensitive <b>maize</b> inbred <b>line</b> SL 1303 were screened to understand the maize response to salt stress and its tolerance mechanisms. Relative water content, membrane stability index, stomatal conductance, chlorophyll content, maximum photochemical efficiency, photochemical efficiency, shoot and root fresh/dry weight, and proline and water soluble sugar content analyses were used to identify that the physiological effects of osmotic stress of salt stress were obvious and manifested at about 3 days after salt stress in maize. Moreover, the ion concentration of two <b>maize</b> inbred <b>lines</b> revealed that the salt-tolerant <b>maize</b> inbred <b>line</b> could maintain low Na+ concentration by accumulating Na+ in old leaves and gradually shedding them to exclude excessive Na+. Furthermore, the K+ uptake and retention abilities of roots were important in maintaining K+ homeostasis for salt tolerance in maize. RNA-seq and qPCR results revealed some Na+/H+ antiporter genes and Ca 2 + transport genes were up-regulated faster and higher in TL 1317 than those in SL 1303. Some K+ transport genes were down-regulated in SL 1303 but up-regulated in TL 1317. RNA-seq results, along with the phenotype and physiological results, suggested that the salt-tolerant <b>maize</b> inbred <b>line</b> TL 1317 possesses more rapidly and effectively responses to remove toxic Na+ ions and maintain K+ under salt stress than the salt-sensitive <b>maize</b> inbred <b>line</b> SL 1303. This response should facilitate cell homoeostasis under salt stress and result in salt tolerance in TL 1317...|$|R

40|$|Maize roots can be colonized by {{free-living}} {{atmospheric nitrogen}} (N- 2) -fixing bacteria (diazotrophs). However, the agronomic potential of non-symbiotic N- 2 -fixation {{in such an}} economically important species as maize, has still not been fully exploited. A preliminary approach to improve {{our understanding of the}} mechanisms controlling the establishment of such N- 2 -fixing associations has been developed, using two <b>maize</b> inbred <b>lines</b> exhibiting different physiological characteristics. The bacterial-plant interaction has been characterized by means of a metabolomic approach. Two established model strains of Nif(+) diazotrophic bacteria, Herbaspirillum seropedicae and Azospirillum brasilense and their Nif(-) couterparts defficient in nitrogenase activity, were used to evaluate the impact of the bacterial inoculation and of N- 2 fixation on the root and leaf metabolic profiles. The two N- 2 -fixing bacteria have been used to inoculate two genetically distant <b>maize</b> <b>lines</b> (FV 252 and FV 2), already characterized for their contrasting physiological properties. Using a well-controlled gnotobiotic experimental system that allows inoculation of maize plants with the two diazotrophs in a N-free medium, we demonstrated that both <b>maize</b> <b>lines</b> were efficiently colonized by the two bacterial species. We also showed that {{in the early stages of}} plant development, both bacterial strains were able to reduce acetylene, suggesting that they contain functional nitrogenase activity and are able to efficiently fix atmospheric N- 2 (Fix(+)). The metabolomic approach allowed the identification of metabolites in the two <b>maize</b> <b>lines</b> that were representative of the N- 2 fixing plant-bacterial interaction, these included mannitol and to a lesser extend trehalose and isocitrate. Whilst other metabolites such as asparagine, although only exhibiting a small increase in maize roots following bacterial infection, were specific for the two Fix(+) bacterial strains, in comparison to their Fix(-) counterparts. Moreover, a number of metabolites exhibited a maize-genotype specific pattern of accumulation, suggesting that the highly diverse maize genetic resources could be further exploited in terms of beneficial plant-bacterial interactions for optimizing maize growth, with reduced N fertilization inputs...|$|R
