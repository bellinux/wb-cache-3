40|$|Abstract The 27 December 1722 Algarve {{earthquake}} {{destroyed a}} large area in southern Portugal generating a local tsunami that inundated the shallow areas of Tavira. It is unclear whether its source was located onshore or offshore and, in any case, what was the tectonic source responsible for the event. We analyze available historical information concerning <b>macroseismicity</b> and the tsunami to discuss the most probable location of the source. We also review available seismotectonic knowledge of the offshore region close to the probable epicenter, selecting a set of four candidate sources. We simulate tsunamis produced by these candidate sources assuming that the sea bottom displacement {{is caused by a}} compressive dislocation over a rectangular fault, as given by the half-space homogeneous elastic approach, and we use numerical modeling to study wave propagation and run-up. We conclude that the 27 December 1722 Tavira earthquake and tsunami was probably generated offshore, close to 37 ? 01 'N, 7 ? 49 'W. [URL]...|$|E
40|$|Online macroseismic {{intensity}} databases {{are becoming}} common {{tools in the}} framework activities related to seismic hazard assessment as they can offer a consistent information background. In Europe, institutions such as INGV (IT), ETH (CH) and Sisfrance (FR) have well-established Macroseismic Intensity Databases. In {{the framework of the}} EC projects NERIES (2006 - 2010) and SHARE (2009 - 2012), the European "Archive of Historical EArthquake Data" AHEAD was established. Other European institutions are {{now in the process of}} creating their own intensity databases following such a proposed common standard. Portugal is among those countries working on a macroseismic intensity database, as at present an updated general compilation of the mainland Portugal <b>macroseismicity</b> is still unavailable. The IM, has among its short term objectives to compile a macroseismic database and to give free access to it on the web. To manage it, the MIDOP software, created and developed by the Italian INGV has been selected. It allows easy access to earthquake listing and visualization of geographical distribution of intensity data points through a web page without the need of installing a complex infrastructure. MIDOP underlying structure strictly follows the standard proposed by AHEAD and with its adoption the collected data will be compatible with other national databases. The status of the project is here presented...|$|E
