500|$|The most {{significant}} {{change to the}} VC Commodore of March 1980 was the engine upgrading to [...] "XT5" [...] specification. Now painted blue and thus known as the Blue straight-sixes and Holden V8s, these replaced the Red units fitted to the VB and earlier cars. Changes included a new twelve-port cylinder head, re-designed combustion chambers, inlet and exhaust manifolds, a new two-barrel carburettor and a Bosch electronic ignition system for the inline sixes. Tweaks and changes to the V8s surrounded the implementation of electronic ignition, revised cylinder head and inlet <b>manifold</b> <b>design</b> and the fitment of a four-barrel carburettor on the 4.2-litre variant. These changes brought improved efficiency, increased outputs and aided driveability. In response to increasing oil prices, a four-cylinder variant was spawned in June 1980. Displacing 1.9-litres, this powerplant known as Starfire was effectively Holden's existing straight-six with two cylinders removed. The four's peak power output of [...] and torque rated at [...] meant its performance was compromised. Reports indicate that the need to push the engine hard to extract performance led to real-world fuel consumption similar to the straight-sixes.|$|E

5000|$|As {{a result}} of [...] "resonance tuning", some {{naturally}} aspirated intake systems operate at a volumetric efficiency above 100%: the air pressure in the combustion chamber before the compression stroke {{is greater than the}} atmospheric pressure. In combination with this intake <b>manifold</b> <b>design</b> feature, the exhaust <b>manifold</b> <b>design,</b> as well as the exhaust valve opening time can be so calibrated as to achieve greater evacuation of the cylinder. The exhaust manifolds achieve a vacuum in the cylinder just before the piston reaches top dead center. The opening inlet valve can then—at typical compression ratios—fill 10% of the cylinder before beginning downward travel. Instead of achieving higher pressure in the cylinder, the inlet valve can stay open after the piston reaches bottom dead center while the air still flows in.|$|E

5000|$|In 1984, Gunness filed {{a patent}} {{for a better}} way to use a {{manifold}} to combine the outputs of multiple compression drivers for increased sound power level (SPL), using two to four flat reflecting surfaces in the throat of a horn to redirect sound waves for a more coherent summation. This low-distortion <b>manifold</b> <b>design</b> made it possible for EV to produce its first high-power concert and touring loudspeaker: the MT-4, with [...] "MT" [...] standing for [...] "Manifold Technology". This was a 4-way system split between two enclosures, with four speaker drivers summed in each bandpass; a total of 16 drivers. The upper two bandpasses used the Gunness <b>manifold</b> <b>design</b> for compression drivers, each manifold formed of two zinc castings. The medium low frequencies were carried by four 10 in cone drivers summed using a larger embodiment of the Gunness manifold concept based on ray tracing and reflection. The MT-4 was a very heavy system at 633 lb, but it put more power into a smaller package, and it was quicker to position and connect. The MT-4 proved popular, used on major tours and festivals such as the 1995 Monsters of Rock at Donington Park in central England and the main stage of the 1996 Lollapalooza tour featuring Metallica and Soundgarden. Together, EV engineer David Carlson and Gunness presented a paper to the Audio Engineering Society (AES) in November 1986, describing the methods they used to sum four drivers in each bandpass.|$|E
50|$|The {{characteristic}} ''''burble'''' of a crossplane V8 {{comes from}} the exhaust <b>manifold</b> <b>design</b> which merge all four exhaust ports on each bank of four cylinders into one exit.On a 4-stroke engine, each port generates the exhaust pulse once every 720° of crank rotation, {{and they need to}} be paired with the pulse generated at 360° phase difference in order to result in an evenly spaced exhaust pulse. This is needed not only for a clean exhaust note, but more importantly for uniform scavenging of residual gas in the cylinders, which is needed to fill the cylinders with the same volume of intake, that is essential for uniform combustion and torque generation.|$|E

The model is used {{to demonstrate that the}} distribution of flow rates to each cell in a 100 cell stack significantly affects the temperature distribution and overall electrochemical performance. In a further analysis, it is quantitatively demonstrated that it would be misleading to attempt to predict performance or optimise <b>manifold</b> <b>designs</b> based on a model with uncoupled transport and electrochemistry...|$|R

5000|$|The straight-six's biggest {{limitation}} {{through the}} years was poor distribution of air-fuel mixture to the cylinders due to a sub-optimal intake <b>manifold</b> <b>design.</b> Cylinders one and six (on {{the ends of the}} engine), received the lowest ratio, with a higher percentage of air in the mixture, while the central ones tended to get a richer mixture, unbalancing the engine's stoichiometric efficiency. Basically, in order to ensure the outer cylinders received a high enough air/fuel ratio to avoid detonation, the carburetor had to be set to run overly rich, which wasted fuel) [...] This design flaw could easily be solved by installing a race intake manifold that sported two or three two-barrel carburetors, as in stock car racing. Only in 1994, with thearrival of multipoint injection in the Omega, was the engine's problem finally solved.|$|E
50|$|A 125-horsepower (93 kW) 4-cylinder {{engine was}} {{offered in the}} DX and LX models (F22A1), while the 1990 and 1991 EX {{received}} a 130 hp (97 kW) version (F22A4). Cruise control was dropped from the DX sedan, with air conditioning remaining a dealer-installed option. The LX kept the same features as the previous generation including air conditioning, power windows, door locks, and mirrors. The 90-91 EX added 5 horsepower due to a different exhaust <b>manifold</b> <b>design,</b> slightly larger exhaust piping and a twin outlet muffler. 15-inch machined aluminum-alloy wheels, sunroof, upgraded upholstery, rear stabilizer bar and a high-power 4-speaker stereo cassette were standard on all EX models. Some models though rare were special ordered with an anti-lock braking system (at that time abbreviated as ALB, now all automakers {{refer to it as}} ABS).

40|$|A new discrete-time {{integral}} {{sliding mode control}} (DISMC) {{scheme is}} proposed for sampled-data systems.

In particular, comparing with existing discrete-time sliding mode control, the new scheme is able to achieve more precise tracking performance. It will be shown in this work that, the new control scheme achieves O(T 2) steadystate error for state regulation with the widely adopted delaybased disturbance estimation. Another desirable feature is, the proposed DISMC prevents the generation of overlarge control actions, which are usually inevitable due to the deadbeat poles of a reduced order sliding <b>manifold</b> <b>designed</b> for sampled-data systems.

Air metering is through an Air Flow Meter {{and there is no}} factory BPV/BOV in this generation. Fuel delivery is through 430cc injectors while air is fed through a 55mm throttle body and 7.15mm intake and exhaust valve lift.

50|$|A {{throttle}} body is somewhat {{analogous to the}} carburetor in a non-injected engine, although {{it is important to}} remember that a {{throttle body}} is not the same thing as a throttle, and that carbureted engines have throttles as well. A throttle body simply supplies a convenient place to mount a throttle in the absence of a carburetor venturi. Carburetors are an older technology, which mechanically modulate the amount of air flow (with an internal throttle plate) and combine air and fuel together (venturi). Cars with fuel injection don't need a mechanical device to meter the fuel flow, since that duty is taken over by injectors in the intake pathways coupled with electronic sensors and computers which calculate how much fuel is needed. However, they do still need a throttle to control the airflow into the engine. The simplest way to do this is to simply remove the carburetor unit, and bolt a simple unit containing a throttle body and fuel injectors on instead. This is known as throttle body injection (called TBI by General Motors and CFI by Ford), and it allows an older engine design to be converted from carburetor to fuel injection without significantly altering the intake <b>manifold</b> <b>design.</b> More complex later designs use intake manifolds, and even cylinder heads, specially designed for the inclusion of injectors.|$|E
