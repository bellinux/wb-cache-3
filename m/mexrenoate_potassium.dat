50|$|Mexrenone (code names ZK-32055, SC-25152) is a steroidal antimineralocorticoid of the spirolactone group {{related to}} {{spironolactone}} {{that was never}} marketed. It is the lactonic form of mexrenoic acid (mexrenoate), and <b>mexrenoate</b> <b>potassium</b> (SC-26714), the potassium salt of mexrenoic acid, also exists. In addition to the mineralocorticoid receptor, mexrenone also binds to the glucocorticoid, androgen, and progesterone receptors. Relative to spironolactone, it has markedly reduced antiandrogen activity (approximately one-tenth of the antimineralocorticoid dosage equivalent antiandrogen activity of spironolactone). Eplerenone is the 9-11α-epoxy analogue of mexrenone.|$|E
50|$|The spirolactones {{include the}} marketed drugs {{spironolactone}} (SC-9420; Aldactone), canrenone (SC-9376; Cantaren, Luvion), potassium canrenoate (SC-14266; Venactone, Soldactone), eplerenone (SC-66110, CGP-30083; Inspra), and drospirenone (ZK-30595; Yasmin). Spirolactones {{that were not}} ever marketed include SC-5233, SC-8109, SC-11927 (Catatoxic Steroid 1; CS-1), spiroxasone, prorenone (SC-23133), prorenoate potassium (SC-23992), 7α-thiospironolactone (SC-24813), mexrenone (SC-25152, ZK-32055), dicirenone (SC-26304), 7α-thiomethylspironolactone (SC-26519), <b>mexrenoate</b> <b>potassium</b> (SC-26714), spirorenone (ZK-35973), ZK-91587 (15β,16β-methylenemexrenone), mespirenone (ZK-94679), and ZK-97894 (7α-thiomethylmespirenone). Oxprenoate potassium (RU-28318) is not a spirolactone by definition but is a closely related antimineralocorticoid that was never marketed.|$|E
