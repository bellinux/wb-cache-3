In this paper, the interest rate pass-through in Germany in the low interest era is investigated using error-correction models for various bank interest rates. The results indicate a stronger short-term pass-through as well as diminished interest rate margins that weigh on banks' profits. However, there is no evidence for structural changes in the long-term relationship between policy rates and banks' interest rates.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a model of}} the optimal bidding behaviour of a single bank in the context of fixed rate liquidity tenders. Banks’ bidding is shown to depend crucially on the central bank’s liquidity policy as regards tender allotments. The paper also analyses ECB liquidity policy in terms of the model. The ECB, while applying fixed rate tenders, appears to have been attempting stabilise the market interest rate at a level close to the <b>main</b> <b>refinancing</b> rate. However, this aim was at least partially overridden by that of stabilising total money market liquidity {{over the course of the}} reserve maintenance period – even more so when banks were expecting the ECB to raise the <b>main</b> <b>refinancing</b> rate in the near future. The banks’ aggregate bids increased considerably during the period of fixed rate tenders. This was seen to result mainly from profit opportunities associated with a positive spread between market interest rate and <b>main</b> <b>refinancing</b> rate.

40|$|In {{the past}} few months, euro area money markets {{have been exposed to}} intense tensions. On 8 August, {{overnight}} interest rates rose to very high levels which required interventions of the Eurosystem in order to stabilise short-term money market interest rates around the target level, i. e. the minimum bid rate on the <b>main</b> <b>refinancing</b> operations. The article explains how the Eurosystem steers very short-term money market interest rates by adjusting its supply of liquidity on the money market. It is shown how the Eurosystem’s liquidity management stabilised short-term money market interest rates around the minimum bid rate on the <b>main</b> <b>refinancing</b> operations {{in the first half of}} 2007. Although short-term money market interest rates were more volatile during the period of financial turmoil, the Eurosystem nevertheless managed to safeguard the signalling function of the short-term money market interest rates by applying its operational framework in a flexible way. More specifically, the Eurosystem decided to allot more liquidity than the benchmark amount in the <b>main</b> <b>refinancing</b> operations early within the maintenance period. It was also decided to conduct fine-tuning operations on a more frequent basis in order to stabilise short-term rates. Finally, the Eurosystem also decided to increase the share of longer-term refinancing operations in the total amount of outstanding open market operations. Despite the relative success in stabilising very short-term money market interest rates, longer maturity unsecured interest rates – for instance the 3 -month Euribor – increased significantly during the period of financial turmoil. These movements cannot be controlled directly by central banks as they are determined predominantly by private sector behaviour. However, when assessing the appropriate monetary policy stance, the Governing Council of the ECB takes these possibly changing financing conditions into account. monetary policy implementation, Eurosystem, open market operations...|$|E

40|$|It is {{generally}} recognised that the operational {{framework for the}} monetary policy of the Eurosystem 1 has been functioning well since {{the launch of the}} euro in 1999. There has been little need to conduct fine-tuning operations, because of the averaging provision of the minimum reserve system {{and the quality of the}} Eurosystem’s liquidity forecasts. Also, credit institutions have had only limited recourse to the standing facilities, which shows that the money market has been working efficiently. And the small and fairly stable spread between the ECB’s fixed or minimum bid rate on its <b>main</b> <b>refinancing</b> operations and the short-term money market rates displays the ability of the ECB to influence short-term interest rates. Despite th{{is generally}} positive assessment, some possible measures have been examined with the aim of further improving the efficiency of the operational framework. There are three changes to be considered: (1) changing the timing of the reserve maintenance period, so that it would always start on the settlement day of the <b>main</b> <b>refinancing</b> operation following the Governing Council meeting at which the discussion of monetary policy is pre-scheduled, so that – as a rule – the implementation of changes to the standing facility rates would be aligned with the start of a new reserve maintenance period...|$|E

40|$|In the Eurosystem, banks’ {{interest}} rate expectations {{should no longer}} {{have resulted in a}} non-zero tender spread, the difference between marginal and minimum price for liquidity, when the ECB reformed its op-erational framework for monetary policy implementation in March 2004 so that the policy rates remain constant within reserves maintenance periods. Yet, the tender spread was wider in 2005 than in any single year after 2000, when the ECB switched from fixed to variable rate tenders. Parts of the relevant literature have argued that because of the ECB’s asymmetric preferences over deviations of the market rates up and down from the policy rate, the shortest euro {{interest rate}}s persistently exceed the policy rate This paper argues, however, that when the central bank applies a quantity oriented liquidity policy, a positive tender spread may result from money market inefficiencies and banks’ risk aversion even if the central bank preferences are symmetric and the markets do not anticipate any changes in the policy rates. In such a case, {{the driving force behind the}} tender spread is banks’ uncertainty about their individual allotments at the marginal rate for the Eurosystem <b>main</b> <b>refinancing</b> operations (MROs). Furthermore, the allotment uncertainty is shown to be significantly related to the amount of liquidity supplied in each operation. Hence, the expansion in the MRO volumes experienced since 2002 may have had a major contribution to the emergence and observed growth of the tender spread. <b>main</b> <b>refinancing</b> operations; liquidity; tender spread; allotments...|$|E

40|$|Most liquidity-providing {{operations}} of the European Central Bank (ECB) have been conducted through variable-rate tenders.

40|$|Using {{a unique}} data set, I study whether {{structural}} bank characteristics {{can help to}} explain a bank's propensity to take recourse to the ECB's marginal lending facility (MLF). My key finding is that besides structural measures capturing a bank's business model, indicators for its liquidity risk management have a highly significant predictive power for a bank's access to the lender-of-the-last-resort (LLR) facility. A bank with volatile reserve holdings, a lower average reserve fulfillment and a more aggressive bidding behavior in the <b>main</b> <b>refinancing</b> operations, is {{significantly more likely to}} revert to the MLF. These results suggest that the option value of having access to the ECB's LLR varies significantly across banks.

40|$|The {{fixed rate}} tender {{is one of the}} main {{procedures}} used by central banks in the implementation of their monetary policies. While academic research has largely dismissed the procedure owing to its tendency to encourage overbidding, central banks such as the ECB and the Bank of England have continued using it. We investigate this apparent conflict by considering an auction-theoretic setting with private information about declining marginal valuations. Since overbidding entails exposure risk, an equilibrium may exist even if bids are costless and the intended volume is pre-announced. In fact, the allotment quota may be strictly below one with certainty. Also with adaptive expectations, overbidding need not escalate. However, the resulting allocation is typically ineffi cient. Empirical proxies of exposure risk are significant in both euro and sterling operations.
