50|$|There {{are also}} {{disadvantages}} for stone veneer compared to natural stone: It {{is not as}} strong as natural stone; if a piece breaks, or if a piece is removed from the wall, then unless it is replaced, it shows significantly; it is not reusable as natural stones are. Furthermore, <b>manufactured</b> <b>stone</b> veneer has a larger waste factor than natural stone.Natural stone can be chipped, cut, and shaped to any size needed. The cut off pieces can be reused. While <b>manufactured</b> <b>stone</b> veneer can not be cut to fit because it exposes the undesirable inner concrete from which the <b>manufactured</b> <b>stone</b> is made of. The user ends up with areas that require a small cut fill piece that has exposed concrete edges.Also, <b>manufactured</b> <b>stone</b> contains lime nuggets which can leech out and stain the surface over time when exposed to water.Manufactured stone is not a naturally occurring product and, due to its cast origin and painted exterior, it is subject to color changes caused by exposure to the UV in sunlight and moisture. <b>Manufactured</b> <b>stone</b> is a porous product. It absorbs much more water than real stone and it will transfer the moisture through to the wall of the structure causing many of the same issues seen with improperly installed stucco. Being a porous product <b>manufactured</b> <b>stone</b> is subjected to ice wedging and freeze thaw problems. As water seeps into the <b>manufactured</b> <b>stone</b> and then freezes, chunks of the face will pop off leaving a rugged edge which looks similar {{to the edge of a}} broken sidewalk. Repair can be expensive as the entire piece of stone must be cut out and replaced. The repair also doesn’t stop the issue from re-occurring.|$|E

50|$|Lancelot Threlkeld, using {{reports from}} a {{castaway}} who had survived among the Moreton Bay blacks, argued in 1824 {{that they were}} far more advanced than the more southern tribes, dwelling in hut settlements that had the appearance of small villages. One important site for habitation was the southern side of the Cape Moreton headland, since {{this was the only}} area where outcroppings of sandy ironstone existed. These sites were quarried to <b>manufacture</b> <b>stone</b> implements, some of which they traded with the Nunukul on Stradbroke Island.|$|R
50|$|Some {{species of}} non-primates {{are able to}} use stone tools, such as the sea otter, which breaks abalone shells with them. Primates can both use and <b>manufacture</b> <b>stone</b> tools.

The key anatomical and behavioral features required for tool manufacture, which are possessed only by Hominans, are the larger thumb {{and the ability to}} hold by means of an assortment of grips.|$|R
50|$|In captivity, the tufted {{capuchin}} {{has been}} seen to <b>manufacture</b> <b>stone</b> tools that produced simple flakes and cores. Some of the capuchins even used these sharpened stones to cut (in a back-and-forth motion) barriers {{in order to reach}} food. The importance of this behavior is that it serves as evidence of mechanical proclivity to modify stones by using behaviors already in the monkeys' repertoires, and this behavior is seen as a precursor to stone-knapping. This early and limited tool use behavior has been hypothesized as similar to pre-Homo habilis and that artifacts of that time would probably resemble those of capuchins.|$|R

5000|$|The Tonquin was {{dispatched}} to Fiji on 15 June 1808. Brumley was appointed captain, with Coles and Fanning both on board. From New York City, the vessel went south through the Atlantic Ocean and sailed past {{part of the}} Brazilian coast and later Gough Island. After passing the Cape Horn the American ship continued to sail west, landing at King George Sound, in modern Western Australia, on 8 October 1808. A tent there was made to allow crew members with scurvy to recover. Local Noongar groups frequently visited the Americans at their tent. Through signs the Noongar would initiate potential commercial transactions by establishing their peaceful intentions through dropping their weapons. Only after the Americans would put down their firearms would a spirited trade begin the two groups. American goods such as beads, metal buttons and knives were often exchanged in return for Noongar <b>manufactured</b> <b>stone</b> tools and food supplies. Those of the crew afflicted with illness were eventually restored to health. over the following days. The Tonquin left the sound on 21 October for Tasmania, where local Palawa peoples sold the crew stockpiles of [...] "hogs, bread-fruit, and yams" [...] among other products.|$|E

50|$|The immense {{timespan}} {{represented by}} the Paleolithic artifacts at La Cotte—nearly 200,000 years—saw considerable cultural changes among the prehistoric users of the site. The earliest stone tools, dated between around 240,000 years to 200,000 BP, are fairly typical of early Middle Paleolithic sites. From around 200,000 BP, however, there is noticeable elaboration in the procedures used to <b>manufacture</b> <b>stone</b> implements, with an increased use of Levallois (prepared core) techniques, and an increased efficiency of raw material usage as tools were resharpened and reused for multiple purposes throughout their 'lifetimes'. Dated at approximately 180,000 BP, two impressive piles of animal bones, consisting of selected cuts of mammoths and woolly rhinoceros, {{appear to have been}} dragged beneath an overhang after being butchered. These innovations mark a transition stage between Middle and Upper Paleolithic subsistence strategies.|$|R
5000|$|By {{the turn}} of the 20th century St. Anthony's became the only church downtown. By {{the end of the first}} decade the parish's {{boundaries}} had become fixed to the central city with the founding of two parishes on top of the hill: Holy Family (1898) in the northwest part of the city and St. Paul the Apostle (1909) on the east side. [...] The grotto to the Blessed Virgin Mary on the north side of the church was added in the 1920s. It was rebuilt in 1998 and the current statue was placed in it in 1999. A major renovation was carried out in 1949 when a <b>manufactured</b> <b>stone</b> facing, or permastone, was put on the 1886 addition to the church, the school (original church) and the rectory. This gave the parish complex a unified appearance. The sacristy was also expanded along the south transept. The north wing was also added to the school building. This was the last addition made to the original building. There was also an addition made to the rectory to create more living space for the resident clergy. [...] In the 1960s changes were made to facilitate the liturgical reforms of the Second Vatican Council. While the communion rail was removed and a new free standing altar was created so the priest could face the congregation, the old altars, frescos and statuary remain in the church.|$|E
5000|$|The Mount William Aboriginal stone axe quarry {{comprises}} {{the remains of}} hundreds of mining pits and the mounds of waste rock where Aboriginal people obtained greenstone (diabase), and <b>manufactured</b> <b>stone</b> blanks for axe heads. Chipped and ground stone axes or hatchets were {{an essential part of}} Aboriginal toolkits in southeast Australia, with the Mount William greenstone being one of the most prized and extensively traded materials. The stone was quarried from the source outcrops, and roughly flaked into blanks, then taken away for finer flaking and grinding the edge. There are 268 mining pits, 18 of which are several metres deep, surrounded by at least 34 discrete flaking floors, with mounds of debris up to 20 metres in diameter and some featuring a central outcropping rock used as an anvil. Mount William lies within one of six Cambrian greenstone belts in Victoria where several other greenstone quarries have also been found including Mount Camel, Howqua River, Cosgrove, Jallukar, Berrambool and Baronga on the Hopkins River; and Ceres and Dog Rocks near Geelong. However, none of the axes at Mount William have been ground and polished into finished hatchet heads. The nearest axe grinding grooves can be found at Mount Macedon, about 29 kilometres away, where analysis of stone fragments showed they were the same diabase stone the Mount William greenstone.♥ ...|$|E
40|$|Based on {{research}} on influence of rubber and plastics on globalization, {{an interesting question}} arose: can we define the first globalization way of material culture? Manufacturing of first stone tools {{can be seen at}} the site of Gona, Ethiopia (dated to 2, 6 million years ago), followed by several sites including the evidence from West Turkana in Kenya (2, 34 ± 0, 4 million years ago), Olduvai in Tanzania and Sterkfontain in South Africa (2 – 1, 6 million years ago). The products found at the sites were simple stone choppers, chopping tools and flakes.
