40|$|This {{study has}} {{investigated}} teachers' {{criteria for the}} use <b>of</b> <b>courseware</b> packages in the classroom. The starting point {{of the study was}} the assumption that it is the teacher who decides whether or not courseware will be used in the classroom. The integration <b>of</b> <b>courseware</b> into the curriculum is conceived as a complex innovation. The study is oriented towards the process of decision making by teachers. A positive decision to actual use <b>of</b> <b>courseware</b> is one <b>of</b> the first steps towards integration <b>of</b> <b>courseware</b> into the curriculum. Three determinants of quality and practicality of an innovation, viz. instrumentality, congruence and cost, formed the theoretical framework of the study. From the study it can be concluded that at the very first stage of the process leading to the integration <b>of</b> <b>courseware</b> into the curriculum, courseware should motivate students, realize educational objectives better than traditional methods and its content should be an operationalization of teacher's ideas and beliefs...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{reports on}} an ongoing study, which intends to propose a {{conceptual}} design model <b>of</b> Assistive <b>Courseware</b> (AC) that is particularly designed for low vision learners (LV) learners.

40|$|The {{increase}} {{power and}} efficiency of today's and of near future's information technology gives the opportunity for new application in the education and training sector. But still traditional oriented seminar and course based education dominate this area. Conceptual restrictions of current IT-based teaching and training systems and high initial production expenses for courseware material limit their acceptance. Additionally, addressing {{a wide range of}} users and long term applications is not supported sufficiently. Such focus serves as a basis for an efficient use and a wide acceptance of IT-based teaching and training. This presentation describes an approach, which aimes at availability, effectiveness and long term use <b>of</b> <b>courseware.</b> In parallel, an efficient creation, re- and multiple use <b>of</b> <b>courseware</b> is supported. In order to achieve these objectives, the modular concept for courseware structure used within IDEALS is introduced.

Part 2 of the paper, ‘Issues in making exploitable courseware’, takes a forward‐looking approach which recognizes that future courseware development efforts must pre‐empt these problems of incompatibility and non‐integration.

These trends will, in the future, create new markets and business opportunities. This will also influence the existing education and training periods of everybody s life. Our future vision is a global "infoverse" which homogeneously supports and integrates all types of learning and training within an IT based environment. To step forward into the direction of such an "infoverse" this presentation describes an approach, which aims at availability, effectiveness and long term use <b>of</b> <b>courseware.</b> In parallel, an efficient creation, re- and multiple use <b>of</b> <b>courseware</b> is supported. In order to achieve these objectives, a modular concept for courseware structure is introduced. Based on this concept <b>of</b> modular <b>courseware</b> a task-oriented process <b>of</b> <b>courseware</b> creation is described to support an efficient way <b>of</b> creating modular <b>courseware.</b> The realisation <b>of</b> these introduced concepts in the EU project IDEALS (Telematics Application Programme: ET 1012), is then presented.

40|$|Abstract — Frameworks for {{applying}} the cellular models, {{proposed by the}} authors years ago, are investigated aiming to reduce the complexity <b>of</b> <b>courseware</b> design. Development <b>of</b> topdown <b>courseware</b> involves the task of arranging the contents which are logically hypertextualized so that learners can walk through the courses with utmost ease. In many cases, the produced courseware must face with varieties of learners who have different backgrounds, failing often {{to meet the demands}} of the majority of both teachers and learners. An ideal solution to this problem is to produce customized versions <b>of</b> the <b>courseware,</b> each <b>of</b> which is so arranged that each learner can maintain and increase one’s primary interest and motivation. However, the time complexity involved in such a process is combinatorial, which can be reduced to an amenable task only when, at present, experienced teachers or courseware designers are involved. In general, developing courseware takes much human resources. Using the cellular models, we can save courseware projects from this difficulty. We propose here a courseware design method based on the cellular database technology that greatly reduces the complexity of designing processes in orders of magnitude, aiming to promote the development <b>of</b> <b>courseware</b> for topdown education.
