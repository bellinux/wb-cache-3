40|$|Abstract. Impacts of <b>Malthusian</b> {{positive}} <b>checks</b> are investigated {{using data}} {{compiled by the}} United Nations Development Program. We show how the intensity of <b>Malthusian</b> positive <b>checks</b> are correlated with indicators describing {{the standard of living}} such as ecological footprint, income per capita, severe poverty, access to pure water and access to sanitation facilities. We then show that mortality increases exponentially with the intensity of <b>Malthusian</b> positive <b>checks</b> (adult mortality, under-five mortality, maternal mortality and deaths by polluted water). However, total fertility rate also increases exponentially. The surprising result of our analysis is that the growth rate and the rate of natural increase are directly proportional to the intensity of <b>Malthusian</b> positive <b>checks.</b> The regenerating impacts triggered by <b>Malthusian</b> positive <b>checks</b> do not just keep the growth undisturbed – they stimulate growth and make it even faster. Using data for Africa, we show that while the death rate increases with the intensity of hunger, total fertility rate, birth rate and the rate of natural increase also increase. Records from China also show that <b>Malthusian</b> positive <b>checks</b> of wars and famines triggered the intensified growth of population. Thus, contrary to the generally promoted interpretations, hunger and famines do not necessarily suppress the growth of population. Similar patterns of stress-induced growth are also observed in nature. This study is closely related to the problem of controlling the growth of human population.

40|$|Aim It {{has long}} been assumed that deteriorating climate (cooling and warming above the norm) could shrink the {{carrying}} capacity of agrarian lands, depriving the human population of sufficient food. Population collapses (i. e. negative population growth) follow. However, this human-ecological relationship has rarely been verified scientifically, and evidence of warming-caused disaster has never been found. This research sought to explore quantitatively the temporal pattern, spatial pattern and triggers of population collapses in relation to climate change at the global scale over 1100 years. Location Various countries/regions in the Northern Hemisphere (NH) during the pre-industrial era. Methods We performed time-series analysis to examine the association between temperature change and country-wide/region-wide population collapses in different climatic zones. All of the known population collapse incidents in the NH in the period ce 800 - 1900 were included in our data analysis. Results Nearly 90 % of population collapses in various NH countries/regions occurred during periods of climate deterioration characterized by shrinking carrying capacity of the land. In addition, we found that cooling dampened the human ecosystem and brought about 80 % of the collapses in warmer humid, cooler humid and dry zones, while warming adversely affected the ecosystems in dry and tropical humid zones. All of the population collapses and growth declines in periods of warm climate occurred in dry and tropical humid zones. <b>Malthusian</b> <b>checks</b> (famines, wars and epidemics) were the dominant triggers of population collapses, which peaked dramatically when climate deteriorated. Main conclusions Global demographic catastrophes and most population collapse incidents occurred in periods with great climate change, owing to overpopulation caused by diminished carrying capacity {{of the land and}} the resultant outbreak of <b>Malthusian</b> <b>checks.</b> Impacts of cooling or warming on land carrying capacity varied geographically, {{as a result of the}} diversified ecosystems in different parts of the Earth. The observed climate-population synchrony challenges Malthusian theory and demonstrates that it is not population growth alone but climate-induced subsistence shortage and population growth working synergistically, that cause large-scale human population collapses on the long-term scale. © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|In the 1970 s {{thinking}} about the future global population trends and the environment was largely influenced by The Limits to Growth, a report presented at the Club of Rome. It is based on an economic, demographic and environmental simulation model, called World 3, which is applied to the world taken as a whole. However, discrepancies have been noted in such a model and modelers have learned many lessons since the application of the model in 1970 s. These lessons include the following: that the world is much too heterogeneous to apply the same behavioral equations to different parts of the world; that the model should not be too highly integrated; and that an intersectoral model should also satisfy the sectoral disciplinary concerns. In a probabilistic outlook of future global population growth and aging, uncertainties involved in the calculations of projections are dealt with by presenting the alternative scenarios of unknown probability and the high and low variants in addition to the medium variant. In addition, such an approach is more intensively based on expert judgement and captures the possibilities of <b>Malthusian</b> <b>checks.</b> In conclusion, the author states that the probabilistic method is a more differentiated approach that may contribute to moving further beyond the simplistic controversy surrounding the Malthusian theory...|$|R
40|$|Analysis of {{demographic}} catastrophes shows that, {{with the exception}} of perhaps only two critical events, they were too weak to influence the growth of human population.

Using duration and panel models on family-level data, we find a causal, negative short-run effect of living standards on birth spacing in the three centuries preceding England's fertility transition. While the effect could be driven by biology {{in the case of}} the poor, a significant effect among the rich suggests that spacing worked as a control mechanism in pre-modern England.

40|$|Abstract. The {{established}} {{knowledge in}} demography {{and in the}} economic research {{is based on the}} concept of Malthusian stagnation and on the associated concept of the escape from the Malthusian trap. These two fundamental concepts were gradually enforced by numerous other related postulates all aimed at explaining the mechanism of the historical growth of population and of the historical economic growth. Examples of publications based on the established knowledge are closely examined. They are used to show why the established knowledge is scientifically unacceptable. It is also pointed out that the established knowledge is contradicted by data and by their analyses. Interpretations of the historical economic growth and of the historical growth of population has to be based on accepting hyperbolic growth. However, the discussed examples point to a more serious problem in these two fields of research. It is a fundamental systemic problem, the problem associated with the way research is conducted. Doctrines, interpretations and declarations used by the established knowledge have to be accepted by faith. Data are either ignored or manipulated to support preconceived ideas. Contradicting evidence is methodically ignored.   To be recognised as science, demographic and economic research has to adhere to the scientific rules of investigation. Keywords.

40|$|The authors gratefully {{acknowledge}} the feedback from seminar {{participants at the}} University The <b>Malthusian</b> “preventive <b>check</b> ” mechanism {{has been well documented}} for preindustrial England through evidence for a negative correlation between the marriage rate and the price of wheat. Other literature, however, speculates that the correlation was in fact positive from the early nineteenth century. This paper uses the cointegrated VAR model and recursive estimation techniques to document the changing relationship between nuptiality and the price of wheat from 1541 – 1965. The relationship is indeed positive from the early nineteenth century to the First World War. A simple theoretical model shows that this result is not in fact inconsistent with a stylized Malthusian mechanism, and can be understood within the context of an increasing dominance of shocks to aggregate demand rather than to aggregate supply.

40|$|Abstract in Undetermined Using {{longitudinal}} data this work analyses historical fertility between 1834 and 1914 in an Alpine village situated in north-east Italy, characterised by scarce resources and by an economy which passed from being traditional {{and based on}} closed subsistence to becoming open and integrated. During the initial period studied, this territory {{can be described as}} a natural fertility context, where <b>Malthusian</b> preventive <b>checks</b> were long-run mechanisms adopted to overcome the limitations set by the environment. In later years, seasonal migration started to play a predominant role in the community. These flows involved the best skilled, wealthiest and healthiest males and the countries of destination were more modern and affluent, offered better labour opportunities and salaries and possibilities of qualification. Impacts on fertility were strong, evidencing a smaller number of births for migrants, which partly resulted from a reduced childbearing period, with a later start and an earlier stop. The findings of this work therefore show that due to the positive selectivity of these men and to the exposure to influences during their periods of absence, in this village seasonal migrants were the agents of change and also the vanguard of modern reproductive behaviours...|$|R

40|$|A long-standing {{controversy}} has recently reemerged over {{presence or absence}} of deliberate fertility control in late-traditional China. One side maintains that Chinese fertility patterns can be explained only by deliberate fertility control. The other side holds that fertility in traditional China was limited by <b>Malthusian</b> positive <b>checks,</b> and that there is neither statistical nor cultural support for fertility control. We contribute to this debate in the form of new empirical data and a new statistical method for evaluating birthspacing and stopping behavior. The data come from genealogical books compiled and revised between 1400 and 1930 from Xiaoshan County, Zhejiang Province. The genealogies were used to reconstruct the number and birthspacing between sons who survive to adulthood for women who had at least one son. We begin with the culturally-grounded contention that should couples limit their fertility, they will do so after reached a desired number of sons. We hypothesize that the distribution of these surviving-son birth intervals for a given maternal age and the fraction of couples who stop reproducing at a given age should systematically differ by the number of sons in the family.

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{tests for}} “Malthusian ” {{relationships}} (preventive and positive checks, and diminishing returns to labour) in preindustrial Northern Italy using data for 1650 - 1799. We {{do this by}} estimating a cointegrated VAR model on time series of real wages, and crude birth, death and marriage rates for 1650 - 1799. Our results suggest several clear conclusions. Fertility depends positively on nuptiality, but neither variable depends on income. We do not therefore find any evidence for the <b>Malthusian</b> preventive <b>check.</b> Neither is there evidence for the positive check. A larger population does, however, imply lower real wages, suggesting that diminishing returns are present. However, real wages are also subject to a very significant negative trend over time. The lack of preventive check {{seems to be the}} result of societal norms specific to Italy, i. e. that marriage did not depend on the establishment of a separate household, thus removing the income restraint on marriage (and thus fertility). The negative time trend in real wages is probably related to developments in the agricultural sector: principally a deterioration in the weather. Using recursive estimation techniques, we investigate how the relationships change after 1799 (until 1881). They remain remarkably stable, with the exception of the trend in real wages, which becomes insignificant. We contrast our results with those found using an identical methodology for England...|$|R
40|$|One of {{the great}} human success stories {{in the last few}} decades has been the marked {{increase}} in longevity in many, albeit not all, societies across the globe.
