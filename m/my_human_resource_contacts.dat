40|$|So called “knowledge work” {{is seen as}} {{integral}} to post-industrial society and, for some, information and communications technologies (ICTs) are critical enablers of the associated practices. Many still propose the technologically deterministic route of rolling out ICTs and expecting that users will, and indeed can, “download” what they know into a system that can then {{be used in a}} number of ways.

40|$|The {{issues of}} {{globalization}} and the off shoring of high-skilled jobs {{are central to the}} recent innovation policy de-bate. Yet one major factor driving the process has been almost completely ignored. During the past two decades there has been a signifi cant shift in the employment relations between U. S. employers and their American sci-entists and engineers. Corporate decisions are increasingly being made with little regard to how it aff ects workers. IBM, a leading employer, illustrates how radically these practices have changed over the past 20 years. As recently as 1992 IBM never laid off an employee, but since 2002 it adopted policies that force its U. S. workers to train foreign replacements as a condition of severance and unemployment insurance (Bulkeley 2004). IBM isn’t alone as these practices have become widespread in the American technology sector. An American software engineer (Engineer 2007) working at a major semiconductor company put it this way, “Th e basic plan where I worked was to hire H- 1 Bs [foreign workers in the United States on temporary work permits], train them, and use them as a way to outsource and transfer technology to China and India. I trained my replacement who was here on an H- 1 B visa from India. ” One reason this practice hasn’t received more attention is that workers are afraid to discuss their cases. When I asked the software engineer if he would tell his story publicly, he demurred saying, “Th e company I worked for required [that] I sign a several page agreement stating I would not discuss company information. <b>My</b> <b>human</b> <b>resources</b> representative and manager both {{made it clear that the}} company has never lost any challenge and has gone out of its way to destroy the lives of the people who have caused issues.

IT can be defined in various ways, but is broadly considered to encompass the use of computers and telecommunications equipment to store, retrieve, transmit and manipulate data. Infrastructure is the base for everything. IT also has an infrastructure, which can be managed and maintained properly. For an organization’s Information Technology, Infrastructure Management (IM) is the management of essential operation components, such as policies, processes, equipment, data, <b>human</b> <b>resources</b> and external <b>contacts,</b> for overall effectiveness.

40|$|Awareness of the {{companies}} {{of the importance of}} <b>human</b> <b>resources</b> has been increasing. It is difficult to find a company that does not put effort and financial resources in the process of <b>human</b> <b>resources</b> development in order to improve and optimize their business activity. In doing so, it is necessary to recognize the specific social group of the employed adults. Only in such a way the responsible persons can develop a quality process for the development of their own employees. In this context the term “specific social groups” refers to the age range of employees and to the associated differences prior to knowledge, perception, motivation, internalized patterns gained with education and ability to adapt to changes. With this objective, {{the first part of the}} diploma describes and defines the theoretical aspects of adult education and the importance and development of competences. Since the topic is quite broad, the content is limited to the non-formal education by using modern information technology, the so called “e-learning”. In the second part of the diploma the development process of e-learning in the company X, representing one of the key directions of the company, has been introduced. I outlined the business need for e-learning development which gives us an insight in the developing process, such as reasons, goals and benefits of the implementation plan. The preparation of the “e-learning” materials and documents is also described. In <b>my</b> opinion, <b>human</b> <b>resources</b> development should be viewed as a whole, therefore the description of competences development in the company is also included in this part. The last part involves the hypotheses related to use of e-learning and to the model of competences that are verified with an online survey.

I discuss earlier systems of <b>human</b> <b>resources</b> management, then turn <b>my</b> focus to <b>human</b> <b>resources</b> since 1990. Japanese companies have a unique HR management system, with associated subsystems. I believe this system has contributed to fair and equal treatment of employees, while also allowing strong collaboration among employees, encouraging teamwork, and supporting high efficiency in operations. This system was once respected worldwide. At present, however, Japanese companies face many challenges such as declining domestic demand because of a shrinking population and an aging society, and cost pressures due to tough domestic and global competition. My research question is this: Have these challenges changed Japan's traditional HR management system? If so, what were these changes? In Chapter 1, I briefly trace the external environment surrounding HR management, and {{the characteristics of the}} traditional Japanese HR management system and subsystems. I find that a "Potential Abilities-Based Ranking System" has functioned as a core platform in the traditional HR system in Japan. In Chapter 2, I introduce the major characteristics of the Potential Abilities-Based Ranking System, developed by Kyu Kusuda. In Chapter 3, I look at changes in the external and internal environments surrounding today's HR management system. Assuming that the Potential Abilities- Based Ranking System is a core platform in Japanese HR management, the changes occurring in Japan may be influencing this core platform. I examine these influences to determine whether Japanese HR systems will be transformed or replaced by a global HR management system, similar to the American HR management system. In Chapter 4, I introduce a case study of HR management changes at Kirin Holdings Company (my employer). In Chapter 5, I discuss changes and challenges facing HR management in Japan. by Tomohiko Okada. Thesis (M. B. A.) [...] Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Sloan School of Management, 2012.

40|$|Abstract]: <b>Human</b> <b>resource</b> {{auditing}} {{crosses the}} boundaries between <b>human</b> <b>resources</b> management and auditing. The main message from {{this study is that}} a <b>human</b> <b>resource</b> management performance audit can be a suitable method for evaluating the contribution of <b>human</b> <b>resource</b> activities to organisational objectives, assessed on the basis of value for money. The case study demonstrated that a <b>human</b> <b>resource</b> management performance audit can identify areas where additional value can be obtained from an already valued, well regarded and award winning <b>human</b> <b>resource</b> department. The <b>human</b> <b>resource</b> management performance auditing methodology is set down in the Australian auditing standards (Australian Auditing Standards 806 & 808) and assumes a professional practice framework for auditors. A <b>human</b> <b>resource</b> management performance audit is future orientated and can identify areas for organisational improvement. Where the literature on <b>human</b> <b>resource</b> auditing is not grounded in auditing, it is flawed. Dolenko (1990) outlined a methodology for applying auditing techniques to <b>human</b> <b>resource</b> management but later literature is clouded by alternative commentary that defines <b>human</b> <b>resource</b> auditing in quite different ways (Clardy 2004). The literature on <b>human</b> <b>resource</b> auditing should be reviewed to ensure that it is firmly grounded in auditing. This research is aimed at bridging a gap in both knowledge and practice. The study presents as a worthwhile area for research since the researcher takes existing and authoritative standards for the professional practice of auditing and applies them to a modern, well regarded and valued <b>human</b> <b>resource</b> department.
