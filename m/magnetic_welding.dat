For modeling the discharge process an equivalent circuit is presented in this paper. The model is divided in a circuit part and a FEM model part.

40|$|Pulse <b>magnetic</b> <b>welding</b> {{can be seen}} as a well {{developed}} manufacturing process. However, the realization of this technology implies a high degree of knowledge concerning the intrinsic mechanisms of current transmission and force generation and accordingly a high potential of optimization can be expected. Modelling pulse magnetic forming processes requires a transient electromagnetic calculation in order to obtain the generated currents and forces. The prediction of the deforming result requires an explicit structural simulation, as the forming process is conducted in timescales of a few 100 μs. A close investigation of the relevant physical entities is carried out with ANSYS Workbench and ANSYS Emag. Furthermore, the results of the Emag calculations are used as boundary conditions for explicit structural simulations with ANSYS AUTODYN in order to predict the needed charging energy for a joining process.

40|$|In {{recent years}} pulse <b>magnetic</b> <b>welding</b> {{technology}} gained an ever increasing attention. The process {{was known for}} over 40 years, yet the poor knowledge of process parameters {{as well as the}} difficulties concerning the calculability of the process due to lack of adequate software, performance and appropriate material models hindered the application of the technology. In the past, some simulations treating the process of explosive welding were conducted. There, the assumption was made to define a friction condition to the boundary regions which was reasonable due to similar conditions in the collision region during the process. However, at pulse <b>magnetic</b> <b>welding</b> processes, the contact forces are highly transient and have big gradients over the geometry. In this paper a new empirical approach is presented, which gives the possibility of modelling the welding process by parameter-controlled bonding at the welding interface. The pulse magnetic forming process was simulated by loose coupling of electromagnetic and mechanical FEM software with the commercial code ANSYS. As geometry the joining of a duct with an internally positioned conical bolt was chosen. The material used for both duct and bolt was EN AW 6063. First of all the influences of heat generation were analyzed. Therefore, the additional thermal simulation was coupled with the electromagnetic and the mechanical simulation. The heat generation caused by the plastic deformation was considered. As the resulting temperatures were below the melting temperature of the material, further simulations were carried out without thermal simulation. In order to calibrate the welding model, a set of relevant parameters were defined. It included the cumulative plastic work, the plastic deformation in collision direction, the normal and the tangential components of the collision velocity and the collision angle between the two parts. By comparing the simulation with experiments carried out at the same specific process parameters, it was possible to reduce the set of parameters to the normal collision velocity and plastic deformation. Based on their distribution, the parameter control of the bonding condition could be adjusted. Further experiments gave a high accordance to the simulations carried out with the parameters found for this model...|$|E

40|$|A {{significant}} amount of effort {{has been devoted to}} determining the properties and understanding the behavior of the alloy MA 957 to define its potential usefulness as a cladding material, in the fast breeder reactor program. The numerous characterization and fabrication studies that were conducted are documented in this report. The alloy is a ferritic stainless steel developed by International Nickel Company specifically for structural reactor applications. It is strengthened by a very fine, uniformly distributed yttria dispersoid. Its fabrication involves a mechanical alloying process and subsequent extrusion, which ultimately results in a highly elongated grain structure. While the presence of the dispersoid produces a material with excellent strength, the body centered cubic structure inherent to the material coupled with the high aspect ratio that results from processing operations produces some difficulties with ductility. The alloy is very sensitive to variations in a number of processing parameters, and if the high strength is once lost during fabrication, it cannot be recovered. The microstructural evolution of the alloy under irradiation falls into two regimes. Below about 550 C, dislocation development, {alpha}{prime} precipitation and void evolution in the matrix are observed, while above about 550 C damage appears to be restricted to cavity formation within oxide particles. The thermal expansion of the alloy is very similar to that of HT 9 up to the temperature where HT 9 undergoes a phase transition to austenitic. Pulse <b>magnetic</b> <b>welding</b> of end caps onto MA 957 tubing can be accomplished {{in a manner similar to}} that in which it is performed on HT 9, although the welding parameters appear to be very sensitive to variations in the tubing that result from small changes in fabrication conditions. The tensile and stress rupture behavior of the alloy are acceptable in the unirradiated condition, being comparable to HT 9 below about 700 C and exceeding those of HT 9 at higher temperatures. Neither tensile nor rupture strength appear to be degraded by irradiation to fast fluencies on the order of 8 x 10 {sup 22 } n/cm{sup 2 } in the range of 370 [...] 760 C, although some loss of ductility has been observed. The impact resistance of the alloy is very poor in the unirradiated condition, and is significantly degraded by irradiation...|$|E

40|$|We {{investigated}} the eVects of expectation on intensity ratings and somatosensory evoked <b>magnetic</b> <b>Welds</b> and electrical potentials following painful infrared laser stimuli in six healthy subjects. The stimulus series contained trials preceded by diVerent auditory cues which either contained valid, invalid or {{no information about}} the upcoming laser intensity. High and low intensities occurred equally probable across cue types. High intensity stimuli induced greater pain than low intensity across all cue types. Furthermore, laser intensity signiWcantly interacted with cue validity: high intensity stimuli were perceived less painful and low intensity stimuli more painful following invalid compared to valid cues. The amplitude of the evoked <b>magnetic</b> <b>Weld</b> localized within the contralateral sec-ondary somatosensory cortex (SII) at about 165 ms after laser stimuli varied also both with stimulus intensity and cue validity. The evoked electric potential peaked at about 300 ms after laser stimuli and yielded a single dipole source within a region encompassing the caudal anterior cingulate cortex and posterior cingulate cortex. Its amplitude also varied with stimulus intensity, but failed to show any cue validity eVects. This result suggests a priming of early cortical nociceptive sensitivity by cues signaling pain severity. A possible contribution of the SII cortex to the manifestation of nocebo/placebo cognitions is discussed...|$|R
40|$|AbstractLightweight {{structures}} and assemblies formed and welded electromagnetically {{are widely used}} in various industries such as automotive, aerospace and electronics. One of the key factors in <b>magnetic</b> pulsed <b>welding</b> which causes the occurrence of the weld in the contact zone is the impact velocity.

40|$|The <b>Magnetic</b> Pulse <b>Welding</b> (MPW) process, a cold {{solid state}} welding process, is an {{industrial}} process, operating at several high volume manufacturing facilities.
