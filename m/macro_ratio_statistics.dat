40|$|Maximum {{likelihood}} ratio theory contributes tremendous success to parametric inferences, {{due to the}} fundamental theory of Wilks (1938). Yet, there is no general applicable approach for nonparametric inferences based on function estimation. Maximum likelihood <b>ratio</b> test <b>statistics</b> in general may not exist in nonparametric function estimation setting. Even if they exist, they {{are hard to find}} and can not be optimal as shown in this paper. In this paper, we introduce the sieve likelihood statistics to overcome the drawbacks of nonparametric maximum likelihood <b>ratio</b> <b>statistics.</b> New Wilks' phenomenon is unveiled. We demonstrate that the sieve likelihood statistics are asymptotically distribution free and follow X 2 -distributions under the null hypotheses for a number of useful hypotheses and a variety of useful models including Caussian white noise models, nonparametric regression models, varying coefficient models and generalized varying coefficient models. We further demonstrate that sieve likelihood <b>ratio</b> <b>statistics</b> are asymptotically optimal {{in the sense that they}} achieve optimal rates of convergence given by Ingster (1993). They can even be adaptively optimal in the sense of Spokoiny (1996) by using a simple choice of adaptive smoothing parameter.

The bandwidth is chosen using information criteria and a moving average sieve approximation. Through a simulation study, we demonstrate good finite sample performance of our method when the sample size is moderate, while a comparison with an empirical likelihood-based method for <b>ratio</b> <b>statistics</b> is made, confirming a wider applicability of our method.

The modification leads to an exponentiated-Weibull mixture model which encompasses as special cases the exponential and Weibull mixture models typically used to model such data. Inference for the model parameters is considered via maximum likelihood and also via Bayesian inference by using Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation. Model comparison is considered by using likelihood <b>ratio</b> <b>statistics</b> and also the pseudo Bayes factor, which can be computed by using the generated samples. An example of a data set is considered for which the exponentiated-Weibull mixture model presents a better fit than the Weibull mixture model.

40|$|Empirical {{likelihood}} (EL) is {{a statistical}} framework {{that allows for}} likelihood-type inference without explicit distributional assumptions. EL formulates a likelihood function nonparametrically, producing likelihood <b>ratio</b> <b>statistics</b> for use in constructing confidence intervals and performing tests. EL <b>ratio</b> <b>statistics</b> have properties analogous to parametric likelihood <b>ratio</b> <b>statistics,</b> such as chi-square limiting distributions. EL methods formulated for independent data typically fail when applied to dependent random processes. There are two primary ways to adapt EL to dependent data. One is {{through the use of}} data blocking techniques, where data blocking aims to capture the local dependence structure. The other general approach is through a data transformation to typically weaken the dependence structure, often involving analysis in the frequency domain. A variety of EL methods have been developed for time series, but the application of EL to spatial data, particularly irregularly located spatial data, has received far less attention. We investigate two different EL methods for irregularly located spatial data. The first is a blockwise EL method, which allows for inference on means, marginal distributions, and spatial regression parameters. The second is a frequency domain EL method, allowing various estimation and tests about spatial covariance structures. One primary challenge in investigating inference methods for irregularly located spatial data is the question of the asymptotic structure. In time series, the asymptotic context derives from an increasing number of observations over time, but in the spatial setting, there are two different drivers of the asymptotic regime: the rate of growth of the number of points within the sampling region and the rate of growth of the volume of the sampling region. The growth rate of the number of points may be proportional to or greater than the growth rate of the volume of the region. These differences often cause dramatic changes in the limiting distribution of spatial statistics. A further challenge in the frequency domain setting is that the irregular spacing eliminates orthogonality properties of discrete Fourier transforms as typical for equi-spaced time series. For the blockwise EL method, we show that log EL <b>ratio</b> <b>statistics</b> have chi-square limiting distributions, provide results from a simulation study, and apply the method to a real data example in the context of spatial regression. For the frequency domain EL method, we also show log EL <b>ratio</b> <b>statistics</b> have chi-square limiting distributions, and we provide results from an extensive simulation study. In both cases, the EL methods are valid regardless of the exact type of spatial asymptotic structure or the concentrations of random sampling locations...|$|R
