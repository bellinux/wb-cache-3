25|$|The {{rebuilding}} involved stripping {{back to the}} frame, {{with everything}} except for the nose section and <b>monocoque</b> <b>frame</b> removed. Changes included the EMD 645E3 engines being replaced with overhauled EMD 645E3C engines imported from Morrison Knudsen in the USA, the original main alternators were rebuilt from AR10/A4-D14 to the AR10/A9-D14 type, refurbished D78 traction motors replaced the originals along with a new gear ratio, and new MK-LOC microprocessor controls were fitted. The cab was upgraded to modern standards, the brake setup was also changed from twin to single shoe per wheel, {{and a number of}} other small changes were made to assist maintenance.|$|E

5000|$|The use of <b>monocoque</b> <b>frames</b> for bikes is not new, {{but their}} {{development}} was improved {{through the work}} of Norfolk based designer Mike Burrows, who advanced both the design and build through utilising carbon fibre mouldings.|$|R
50|$|Kestrel builds <b>monocoque</b> <b>frames</b> {{rather than}} more {{traditional}} tube and lug designs. This has always meant that Kestrels have tended {{to have a very}} fluid, curved appearance. However, more recent designs from the company have been more angular due to an increased desire to minimise wind resistance.|$|R

50|$|In 2001, {{the firm}} moved from its 800-sq.-foot space to a larger, modernized plant. Over {{the next five}} years it built dual-suspension bikes with needle bearings, Cx road bikes with carbon <b>monocoque</b> <b>frames,</b> and {{introduced}} its Cyclocross product line. In 2004, the firm's Ollie model won 26 Magazine’s “Freeride Bike of the Year” award.|$|R

50|$|In 1976 {{the first}} LCR sidecar was designed. From 1983 to 1989 they {{produced}} {{a series of}} successful <b>monocoque</b> <b>frames</b> for the 80 cc and 125 cc Grand Prix solo classes. The Zündapp works team and later Krauser were using 80 cc frames and rider Stefan Dörflinger twice won the World Championship. There were several Grand Prix wins in the 125 class with MBA engines.|$|R
5000|$|More {{common in}} the car world, a <b>monocoque</b> <b>frame</b> {{comprises}} a structure where loads are supported through its external skin. On bikes they are used almost exclusively on racing motorcycles.|$|E
5000|$|The {{first time}} an {{aluminium}} <b>monocoque</b> <b>frame</b> {{appeared on a}} mass-produced production motorcycle was the 2000 Kawasaki Ninja ZX-12R. This was Kawasakis flagship production sportbike aimed at being the fastest production motorcycle.|$|E
50|$|Its 2-litre {{engine and}} running gear {{came from the}} Vauxhall VX 4/90, but its plywood <b>monocoque</b> <b>frame</b> and {{aerodynamic}} fibreglass body gave it {{a top speed of}} 137 mph, and a quoted 0-60 time of 7.2 sec.|$|E

5000|$|In 1990, the UCI revoked {{the ban on}} <b>monocoque</b> <b>frames.</b> Shortly after this, Lotus Engineering became {{involved}} in the project through a friend of Burrows who took his design to the Lotus factory. The potential was evident and Lotus’ knowledge and aptitude at using carbon fibre techniques allowed the design to finally realise its potential. By February 1992, Lotus Engineering had acquired the rights and marketed the bike as the LotusSport Bike. In addition, the design was modified and perfected through a series of wind tunnel tests, by the Lotus aerodynamics specialist Richard Hill.|$|R
50|$|Despite this denial, since 2007 Colnago's carbon <b>monocoque</b> CLX <b>frame</b> {{has been}} {{manufactured}} in Taiwan. In 2008, a second Colnago carbon fiber model, the CX-1 was also sourced in Taiwan.|$|R
50|$|The 2WD racing buggy created {{following}} the Tomahawk. The double wishbone suspension and aluminum <b>monocoque</b> <b>frame</b> gave the buggy far more speed than previous models. The car won 1st {{place in the}} 2nd electric off-road 2WD world tournament held in England in 1987.|$|E
5000|$|Heavier. Compared to a {{traditional}} diamond frame consisting of two near-triangles, open or step-through frame designs must be designed with thicker gauge tubing, the use of additional gusseting members, and/or <b>monocoque</b> <b>frame</b> construction. These structural elements may add weight or cost over {{a traditional}} diamond design.|$|E
5000|$|The Ducati Panigale is {{a family}} of sport {{motorcycles}} manufactured by Ducati since 2011. The [...] "Panigale" [...] is named after the small manufacturing town of Borgo Panigale. All motorcycles of this series use <b>monocoque</b> <b>frame</b> (the engine is a stressed member, replacing Ducati's conventional trellis frame).|$|E
5000|$|Road racing sidecars {{began to}} change away from normal {{motorcycle}} development in the 1950s with them becoming lower and using smaller diameter wheels and they kept the enclosed [...] "dustbin fairing" [...] banned in solo competition in 1957. By the 1970s, they were using wide slick tyres with a square car like profile, the rider kneeled behind the engine instead of sitting on a seat and the motor of choice was generally a 500 cc two stroke. In the late 1970s sidecars began to appear with hub centre steering and later the engines moved {{to the rear of}} the rider, to lower the centre of gravity further still, making the sidecar very long. Sidecars raced in the world championship known as Superside are all hub centre long <b>monocoque</b> <b>framed</b> machines, the most common being LCR, ART or Windle, with 1,000 cc four-cylinder four-stroke engines, the most popular being the Suzuki GSX-R1000.|$|R
50|$|The <b>monocoque</b> (load-bearing single-shell <b>frame)</b> body {{structure}} of the SUTRA is constructed with aluminium extrusion materials. The lightweight structure combined with the aluminium apron structure provides enhanced strength and durability of up to 30 years.|$|R
50|$|The Mazda Kiyora has two {{butterfly}} {{doors and}} a tailgate. It has four seats and the rear two seats can be folded. The body frame is streamlined like Mazda’s former concept car the Nagare series. The roof and two side doors {{are made with}} transparent material {{so you can see}} the <b>monocoque</b> & <b>frame</b> structure from the outside. It is designed not only to look like water stream, but also to increase the safety while decreasing the weight.|$|R
50|$|A {{slightly}} lighter Mark 2 <b>monocoque</b> <b>frame,</b> {{with greater}} {{support for the}} seatpost (top picture), was introduced in 2006 along with new component choices. The Mark 1 continues {{to be used with}} a slightly updated frame on some models, notably the World Comfort (7 speed Nexus, 14.2 kg.|$|E
5000|$|The Kawasaki KR500 was {{a racing}} {{motorcycle}} built by Kawasaki from 1980 to 1982 for the 500 cc class. The bike used a true aluminium <b>monocoque</b> <b>frame,</b> a rarity {{at the time}} aimed at improving aerodynamics with a small frontal area, improving chassis stiffness and also keeping weight down.|$|E
5000|$|Ossa in {{the late}} 1960s {{successfully}} raced a similar magnesium monocoque-framed bike. [...] In 2000 Kawasaki released the ZX-12R the first production motorcycle with a aluminium <b>monocoque</b> <b>frame,</b> then in 2006 the ZX-14 utilized this type of frame, also the 2008 Concours 14 {{that was based on}} the ZX-14.|$|E
50|$|The Honda Dax {{model is}} {{generally}} not considered a Monkey, but rather a bigger, two-seat variant, with larger 10 in wheels and usually a larger engine. The Dax models have a <b>monocoque</b> stamped sheet-metal <b>frame.</b> This also houses the fuel tank, battery and wiring loom.|$|R
50|$|The chassis is a steel space <b>frame</b> <b>monocoque</b> using square {{seamless}} steel tubes. The chassis frame design {{is very similar}} to the Formula LGB Swift frame but longer by 100 mm to improve straightline stability. Tyres are grooved racing slicks supplied by JK Tyres' motorsports division.|$|R
50|$|Torsion bars {{reached the}} height of their {{popularity}} on mass-production road cars {{in the middle of}} the 20th century at the same time that unitary construction was being adopted. At a time when the mechanics of stress and metal fatigue in <b>monocoque</b> body <b>frames</b> was poorly understood, torsion bars were very attractive to vehicle designers as the bars could be mounted to reinforced parts of the central structure, typically the bulkhead. Using MacPherson struts to achieve independent front suspension with coil springs meant providing strong turrets in the frontal structure of the car.|$|R
50|$|Component {{selection}} on the Mk 2 sometimes seemed illogical, {{with lower}} level Capreo components on the top-of-the-line <b>monocoque</b> <b>frame,</b> and higher quality SRAM X7 components on the less expensive model. However, the Capreo groupset was {{specifically designed for}} small-wheel bicycles as its smallest 9-tooth sprocket compensates for the small wheel size.|$|E
5000|$|The Arrows A6 was a Formula One car {{which the}} Arrows team used {{to compete in}} the [...] and [...] Formula One seasons. It was {{designed}} by Dave Wass and powered by the Cosworth DFY V8 engine. The A6 used a honeycomb <b>monocoque</b> <b>frame,</b> as a carbon fibre chassis was too expensive.|$|E
50|$|In 2014, Ducati {{launched}} the 1199 Superleggera (Superlight). The philosophy behind this motorcycle {{was the largest}} reduction of weight possible, achieved {{through the use of}} exotic materials such as magnesium (particularly the <b>monocoque</b> <b>frame),</b> carbon and titanium. This resulted in a dry weight of 155 kg, and a wet weight of 177 kg. Only 500 were produced.|$|E
5000|$|... 1989 was {{a pivotal}} year for Trek, marking {{the year that}} the company {{unveiled}} its first molded carbon fiber frame, the Trek 5000. The 5000 frameset (<b>monocoque</b> carbon <b>frame</b> plus bonded aluminum fork) had an advertised weight of 3.3 lb. Designed by Trek but built by Brent Trimble, an outside manufacturer, the 5000 suffered enough quality problems that it was discontinued after just one year. But the {{lessons learned from the}} 5000 would prove to be instrumental in driving Trek to develop its own carbon manufacturing capabilities in the coming years.|$|R
5000|$|While most sport bikes use an {{aluminum}} perimeter frame, the ZX-12R uses a unique <b>monocoque</b> aluminum <b>frame.</b> The very {{first use of}} this type of frame on a mass produced production motorcycle. [...] This design surpasses the level of chassis strength and stiffness associated with conventional aluminum perimeter frames. Its intention was to make the bike narrower, and there by more aerodynamic. The design saves space by housing the battery and incorporating an efficient airbox and a cartridge-type air filter that easily slides into the frame. It was fuel injected with four Mikuni 46 mm throttle bodies and was Kawasaki's first fuel-injected sport bike since the 1981-1985 GPZ1100.|$|R
5000|$|... 1973 {{also saw}} the start of {{development}} on a new machine with a <b>monocoque</b> pressed steel <b>frame,</b> that also included a 500 cc twin, stepped piston engine called the 'Wulf'. However, as the Norton Villiers Triumph company was again in serious financial problems, development of the 'Wulf' was dropped in favour of the rotary Wankel type engine inherited from BSA.|$|R
