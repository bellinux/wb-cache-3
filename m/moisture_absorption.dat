5000|$|ASTM Standard C-1149 - Industry {{standard}} for self-supported spray-applied cellulose insulation for exposed or wall cavity application - covers density, R-value, surface burning, adhesive strength, smoldering combustion, fungi resistance, corrosion, <b>moisture</b> vapor <b>absorption,</b> odor, flame resistance permanency (no test exists for this characteristic), substrate deflection (for exposed application products), and air erosion (for exposed application products).|$|R
25|$|The {{substrates}} {{are characterized}} by several key parameters, chiefly thermomechanical (glass transition temperature, tensile strength, shear strength, thermal expansion), electrical (dielectric constant, loss tangent, dielectric breakdown voltage, leakage current, tracking resistance...), and others (e.g. <b>moisture</b> <b>absorption).</b>|$|E
25|$|Thermal stress {{during the}} {{soldering}} process {{can change the}} capacitance value of leaded film capacitors by 1% to 5% from initial value, for example.

The dissipation factor and insulation resistance of film capacitors may also be changed by the above-described external factors, particularly by <b>moisture</b> <b>absorption</b> in high humidity climates.|$|E
25|$|In November 1916, Pfalz hired Rudolph Gehringer from Flugzeugbau Friedrichshafen GmbH. As Pfalz’s {{new chief}} engineer, Gehringer {{immediately}} commenced {{work on an}} original fighter design. The resulting D.III emerged in April 1917. Like the Rolands, the D.III used a plywood monocoque fuselage. Two layers of thin plywood strips were placed over a mold to form one half of a fuselage shell. The fuselage halves were then glued together, covered {{with a layer of}} fabric, and doped. This Wickelrumpf method gave the fuselage great strength, light weight, and smooth contours compared to conventional construction techniques. However, it also proved to be more labor-intensive and expensive. Furthermore, fuselages of the Wickelrumpf type proved to be liable to twisting or warping in service, affecting performance as well as causing control problems. This has been attributed to <b>moisture</b> <b>absorption</b> in damp front-line conditions or to the use of insufficiently seasoned wood.|$|E

50|$|Some of the {{properties}} that make wollastonite so useful are its high brightness and whiteness, low <b>moisture</b> and oil <b>absorption,</b> and low volatile content.

40|$|AbstractThe {{motivation}} {{of this research}} is to develop a new biopolymer derived from sugar palm tree (Arenga pinnata) which can lead to solve non degradable polymer waste disposal problems. Therefore, this paper presents the development of alternative biodegradable material developed by using locally available sugar palm starch (SPS) in presence of biodegradable glycerol as a plasticizer. The environmental friendly plasticized SPS were successfully prepared using 15, 20, 30 and 40 % w/w of glycerol. The samples were characterized for density, <b>moisture</b> content, water <b>absorption</b> and thickness swelling. The results showed that the physical properties i. e. density, <b>moisture</b> content, water <b>absorption</b> and thickness swelling of the plasticized SPS become lower with the increasing of glycerol content...|$|R
2500|$|Film {{capacitors}} {{are subject}} to certain very small but measurable aging processes. The primary degradation process is {{a small amount of}} plastic film shrinkage, which occurs mainly during the soldering process, but also during operation at high ambient temperatures or at high current load. [...] Additionally, some <b>moisture</b> <b>absorption</b> in the windings of the capacitor may take place under operating conditions in humid climates.|$|E
2500|$|The {{manufacturers}} of film capacitors can slow {{the aging process}} caused by <b>moisture</b> <b>absorption,</b> by using better encapsulation. [...] This more expensive fabrication processing {{may account for the}} fact that film capacitors with the same basic body design can be supplied in different life time stability ratings called Performance grades. Performance grade 1 capacitors are [...] "longlife", Performance grade 2 capacitors are [...] "general purpose" [...] capacitors. The specifications behind this grades are defined in the relevant standard of IEC/EN 60384-x (see standards).|$|E
2500|$|Some materials, notably {{high-strength}} steels, aluminium, and titanium alloys, {{are susceptible}} to hydrogen embrittlement. If the electrodes used for welding contain traces of moisture, the water decomposes {{in the heat of}} the arc and the liberated hydrogen enters the lattice of the material, causing its brittleness. Stick electrodes for such materials, with special low-hydrogen coating, are delivered in sealed moisture-proof packaging. New electrodes can be used straight from the can, but when <b>moisture</b> <b>absorption</b> may be suspected, they have to be dried by baking (usually at [...] ) in a drying oven. Flux used has to be kept dry as well.|$|E

Certain products, based on modified (oxy-ethylated) polyamides, make the fabric more pleasant by reducing the cohesion of water so that it spreads over a larger area and thus evaporates more readily.|$|R
50|$|Symptoms of K {{deficiency}} include lower growth rates, smaller {{fruit and}} seed sizes, reduced root systems, disease and winterkill susceptibility and lower <b>moisture</b> and nitrogen <b>absorption</b> and content.

2500|$|A yarn's {{usefulness}} {{is judged}} by several factors, {{such as its}} loft (its ability to trap air), its resilience (elasticity under tension), its washability and colorfastness, its hand (its feel, particularly softness vs. scratchiness), its durability against abrasion, its resistance to pilling, its hairiness (fuzziness), its tendency to twist or untwist, its overall weight and drape, its blocking and felting qualities, its comfort (breathability, <b>moisture</b> <b>absorption,</b> wicking properties) and its appearance, which includes its color, sheen, smoothness and ornamental features. [...] Other factors include allergenicity, speed of drying, resistance to chemicals, moths, and mildew, melting point and flammability, retention of static electricity, and the propensity to accept dyes. [...] Desirable properties may vary for different projects, {{so there is no}} one [...] "best" [...] yarn.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Moisture</b> <b>absorption</b> {{occurs when}} the {{material}} is exposed to high humidity or water. Both the resin and the reinforcement may absorb water; water may be also soaked by capillary forces through voids in the materials and along the reinforcement. Epoxies of the FR-4 materials aren't too susceptible, with absorption of only 0.15%. Teflon has very low absorption of 0.01%. Polyimides and cyanate esters, on the other side, suffer from high water absorption. Absorbed water can lead to significant degradation of key parameters; it impairs tracking resistance, breakdown voltage, and dielectric parameters. Relative dielectric constant of water is about 73, compared to about 4 for common circuitboard materials. Absorbed moisture can also vaporize on heating and cause cracking and delamination, the same effect responsible for [...] "popcorning" [...] damage on wet packaging of electronic parts. Careful baking of the substrates may be required.|$|E
2500|$|It {{was also}} {{discovered}} that if the paste was rolled into balls before drying the resulting gunpowder absorbed less water from the air during storage and traveled better. The balls were then crushed in a mortar by the gunner immediately before use, with the old problem of uneven particle size and packing causing unpredictable results. If the right size particles were chosen, however, {{the result was a}} great improvement in power. [...] Forming the damp paste into corn-sized clumps by hand or {{with the use of a}} sieve instead of larger balls produced a product after drying that loaded much better, as each tiny piece provided its own surrounding air space that allowed much more rapid combustion than a fine powder. [...] This [...] "corned" [...] gunpowder was from 30% to 300% more powerful. An example is cited where 34 pounds of serpentine was needed to shoot a 47-pound ball, but only 18 pounds of corned powder. The optimum size of the grain depended on its use; larger for large cannon, finer for small arms. [...] Larger cast cannons were easily muzzle-loaded with corned powder using a long-handled ladle. Corned powder also retained the advantage of low <b>moisture</b> <b>absorption,</b> as even tiny grains still had much less surface area to attract water than a floury powder.|$|E
40|$|A fibre Bragg grating sensor is {{coated with}} a novel polymer gel in order to {{investigate}} its suitability for nondestructive measurement of moisture in materials that can potentially lose their integrity due to <b>moisture</b> ingress. <b>Absorption</b> and desorption of moisture lead to swelling/shrinkage of an azobenzene-based gel, which induces a strain in the Bragg grating resulting in wavelength shifts.

[...] Other factors include allergenicity; speed of drying; resistance to chemicals, moths, and mildew; melting point and flammability; retention of static electricity; and the propensity to become stained and to accept dyes. [...] Different factors may be more significant than others for different knitting projects, {{so there is no}} one [...] "best" [...] yarn. [...] The resilience and propensity to (un)twist are general properties that affect the ease of hand-knitting. [...] More resilient yarns are more forgiving of irregularities in tension; highly twisted yarns are sometimes difficult to knit, whereas untwisting yarns can lead to split stitches, in which not all the yarn is knitted into a stitch. [...] A key factor in knitting is stitch definition, [...] corresponding to how well complicated stitch patterns can be seen when made from a given yarn. [...] Smooth, highly spun yarns are best for showing off stitch patterns; at the other extreme, very fuzzy yarns or eyelash yarns have poor stitch definition, and any complicated stitch pattern would be invisible.|$|E

40|$|The {{variation}} and path coefficient analysis of bread-making quality traits {{have been studied}} for 145 genotypes of breeding lines, cultivars and landrace varieties of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). Bread-making quality traits of genotypes was evaluated indirectly by protein percentage, SDS and Zeleny sedimentation tests, hardness index, test weight, bread volume, grain <b>moisture,</b> and water <b>absorption</b> percentage. Hardness index, Zeleny and SDS sedimentation tests had the highest coefficient of variability (13. 51 %, 11. 83 % and 11. 03 %, respectively).

40|$|The present {{project was}} {{designed}} to identify the factors responsible for yolk retention in broiler chicks. Four different experiments were conducted {{to find out the}} effect of four factors (experimental yolk sac infection with Echerichia coli, off-feed period between hatching and housing. first feeding time in the poultry house and type of initial feed) on yolk absorption. Results of these experiments showed that yolk sac infection with E. coli led to decrease in rate of yolk <b>absorption.</b> <b>Moisture</b> and protein percentage was increased in infected yolk but fat percentage was not affected by yolk sac infection. On the other hand, post hatch starvation due to delay in housing and delay in first feeding did not affect rate of yolk <b>absorption.</b> <b>Moisture</b> percentage was not affected while fat absorption increased and protein absorption decreased due to fasting. It was also observed that feeding ground corn in early life of chick led to slow absorption of yolk contents as compared to feeding commercial starter ration and 2 % sugar solution.
