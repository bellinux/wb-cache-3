50|$|The <b>masked</b> <b>tanager</b> (Tangara nigrocincta) is {{a species}} of bird in the family Thraupidae. It is found in Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, Guyana, Peru, and Venezuela.|$|E
50|$|The varied {{relief and}} flora support a very diverse bird {{population}} and favour endemism.The white-banded mockingbird (Mimus triurus) {{passes through the}} reserve from June to August.409 species are known {{to occur in the}} reserve including the threatened hyacinth macaw (Anodorhynchus hyacinthinus), Chaco eagle (Buteogallus coronatus), red-necked aracari (Pteroglossus bitorquatus) and blue-winged macaw (Primolius maracana). There are 22 regionally endemic species including red-throated piping guan (Pipile cujubi), snow-capped manakin (Lepidothrix nattereri) and <b>masked</b> <b>tanager</b> (Tangara nigrocincta).Rare species include the Tapajós hermit (Phaethornis aethopygus), bald parrot (Pyrilia aurantiocephala) and the chorozinho-do-cachimbo, a recently discovered species of Herpsilochmus.|$|E

50|$|The <b>masked</b> crimson <b>tanager</b> {{has been}} speculated to engage in reverse sexual {{dominance}} behavior similar to their congener pair, the silver-beaked <b>tanager.</b> The <b>masked</b> crimson <b>tanagers,</b> who belong to the passerine bird order exhibit this behavior {{similar to that of}} their cousin. However, there is no observable evidence to support the hypothesis that the <b>masked</b> crimson <b>tanager</b> are among the rare and unexplained phenomenon of reverse sexual dominance. Under normal circumstances, passerine species of birds exemplify a default hierarchy of dominance wherein larger, heavier birds tend to dominate the smaller, lighter birds and males tend to dominate females. Between <b>masked</b> crimson <b>tanagers</b> and the silver-beaked tanager, individuals engage in a form of interference competition, also known as competition by resource defense, when partitioning resource-rich habitats. The <b>masked</b> crimson <b>tanager</b> prefer to inhabit sites close to or around oxbow lakes, a common geographical feature of their native Amazon biome. They demonstrate aggression while defending the more productive areas around the lakes, causing the silver-beaked tanager to occupy the riparian forest. The <b>masked</b> crimson <b>tanagers</b> are competitively superior and dominate most interspecies interactions with their cousin.|$|R
50|$|In neotropical forests, the <b>masked</b> crimson <b>tanager</b> congregates {{in mixed}} flocks {{much like those}} seen in flycatchers and vireos. The {{degree to which the}} <b>masked</b> crimson <b>tanager</b> forms mixed flocks {{correlates}} with the relative extent to which broad-leafed canopy make up the composition of the neotropical forest.|$|R
50|$|Like most <b>tanagers,</b> <b>masked</b> crimson <b>tanagers</b> {{are mainly}} frugivorous, supplementing their fruit diets with small insects such as flying termites. Their insectivorous {{tendency}} {{is driven by}} the periodic cycle of the breeding of termites, which produce winged males and females when sexually active. These termites are richer in nutrients than normal wood termites and therefore it may become more ecologically sound for the <b>masked</b> crimson <b>tanager</b> to feed on these insects to supplement their existing diets.|$|R
50|$|Other common {{birds of}} Victoria Peak and the Cockscomb Basin include: great curassow, crested guan, clay-coloured robins, social flycatchers, collared-seed eaters, crimson-collared <b>tanagers</b> and <b>masked</b> <b>tanagers,</b> bat falcons, Montezuma’s oropendola, {{as well as}} white-collared manakins, paraque, the slaty-breasted tinamou, {{chestnut}} headed oropendolas, parrots, toucans, and Agami heron to name a few.|$|R
50|$|The <b>masked</b> crimson <b>tanager</b> {{is found}} across Amazonia and is abundant. It prefers to dwell near {{bodies of water}} such as lakes, swamps or rivers, {{generally}} at altitudes below 600 m (2000 ft). <b>Masked</b> crimson <b>tanagers</b> move about in troops of 10 to 12 birds. The species can form mixed species flocks with the silver-beaked tanager (Ramphocelus carbo). It is frugivorous (fruit-eating).|$|R
50|$|The <b>masked</b> crimson <b>tanager</b> breeds {{in between}} the dry and wet seasons of the {{seasonal}} tropics that they occupy. This species of tanager participates in cooperative breeding, which involves the communal care and protection of the offspring. For the <b>masked</b> crimson <b>tanager,</b> {{as well as other}} lake-margin bird species, cooperative breeding may be favored due to high population density and scarcity of habitable space.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>masked</b> crimson <b>tanager</b> makes {{a high-pitched}} single note {{variously}} transcribed as tchlink or [...] "tink", {{and a simple}} melody often sung at dawn.|$|R
50|$|The <b>masked</b> crimson <b>tanager</b> (Ramphocelus nigrogularis) is {{a species}} of bird in the family Thraupidae.It is found in Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru.Its natural {{habitats}} are subtropical or tropical swamps and subtropical or tropical moist shrubland.|$|R
50|$|This {{species is}} {{sometimes}} {{placed in a}} genus of its own as Phlogothraupis sanguinolenta, and a genetic study {{suggests that it is}} less closely related to the other Ramphocelus tanagers than they are to each other. Its closest relative is the <b>masked</b> crimson <b>tanager.</b>|$|R
50|$|The crimson-backed tanager {{was first}} {{described}} by French naturalist Frédéric de Lafresnaye in 1837. It {{is one of}} nine species of brightly coloured tanagers of the genus Ramphocelus. Mitochondrial DNA evidence indicates its closest relative is the <b>masked</b> crimson <b>tanager</b> (R. nigrogularis), and the two split around 800,000 years ago.|$|R
50|$|The crimson-collared tanager is {{sometimes}} {{placed in a}} genus of its own as Phlogothraupis sanguinolenta (Howell and Webb 1995), and a genetic study {{suggests that it is}} less closely related to the other Ramphocelus tanagers than they are to each other (Hackett 1996). Its closest relative is <b>masked</b> crimson <b>tanager.</b>|$|R
50|$|The <b>masked</b> {{mountain}} <b>tanager</b> (Buthraupis wetmorei) is {{a vulnerable}} species of {{bird in the}} tanager family. This large and colourful tanager is endemic to elfin forest, woodland and shrub in the Andean highlands of southern Colombia, Ecuador and northern Peru. It is generally rare or uncommon, and is threatened by habitat loss.|$|R
50|$|Bird species include <b>masked</b> {{mountain}} <b>tanager</b> (Buthraupis wetmorei), chestnut-bellied cotinga (Doliornis remseni), cinnamon {{screech owl}} (Megascops petersoni), neblina metaltail (Metallura odomae) and Andean condor (Vultur gryphus).Endangered and endemic birds include white-breasted parakeet (Pyrrhura albipectus), coppery-chested jacamar (Galbula pastazae), and bicolored antvireo (Dysithamnus occidentalis).Other endangered birds include royal sunangel (Heliangelus regalis) and black-and-chestnut eagle (Spizaetus isidori).|$|R
5000|$|The <b>masked</b> crimson <b>tanager</b> {{was first}} {{described}} by German naturalist Johann Baptist von Spix in 1825. Its species name {{is derived from}} the Latin words niger [...] "black", and gularis [...] "throated". It is one of nine species of brightly coloured tanagers of the genus Ramphocelus. Mitochondrial DNA evidence indicates its closest relative is the crimson-backed tanager (R. dimidiatus), and the two split around 800,000 years ago.|$|R
50|$|<b>Masked</b> crimson <b>tanagers</b> {{may also}} {{feed on the}} nectar of flowers {{as part of their}} diet. They have not been {{observed}} opening flowers themselves, only feeding on nectar from flowers already been opened by some other species of bird or insect. They feed on flowers of Erythrina fusca plants without damaging them, while simultaneously contacting the anthers of the flowers with their heads, thus making them effective pollinators.|$|R
