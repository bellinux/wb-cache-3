40|$|Determining {{fatty acid}} methyl or ethyl esters, in the {{presence}} of mono-, di- and tri glycerides, is very important when studying fatty compounds' methanolysis or ethanolysis, as well as for controlling the quality of petrochemical products. This work presents a useful technique for determining fatty acids methyl or ethyl esters by high temperature gas chromastography {{in the presence}} of mono-, di- and triglycerides. Samples were silylated with N, O-bis (trimethylsilyl) trifluroacetamide (BSTFA) and then passed throught a 12 m HT 5 column coated with a phenyl-polysiloxane-carborane film. Standard methyl and ethyl palmitate, <b>methyl</b> and ethyl <b>oleate,</b> DL-palmitin, dipalmitin, tripalmitin and triolein solutions were used for calibrating the technique, using tricaprin as internal standard. Retention times and response factors were also determined. The results were employed in following-up palm oil methanolysis and ethanolysis reactions...|$|R

40|$|The {{effects of}} alpha- and delta-tocopherol on {{inhibition}} of hydroperoxides, keto and hydroxy compounds at Rancimat conditions, i. e. 100 ºC and air bubbling, were studied in samples of fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) obtained from high linoleic (HL) and high oleic (HO) sunflower oils. Simple hydroperoxides from <b>methyl</b> linoleate and <b>oleate</b> and keto and hydroxy compounds derived from methyl linoleate hydroperoxides {{were analyzed by}} HPLC-UV-ELS. Different tocopherol concentrations, namely, 10, 50, 100, 500 and 1000 mg/kg, were tested. Irrespective of the lipid substrate and the initial concentration of tocopherol, {{results showed that the}} content of hydroperoxides accumulated during the induction period was remarkably higher in the samples containing delta-tocopherol. The relative concentrations of oleate hydroperoxides in the HO samples were also higher in the presence of delta-tocopherol. Alpha-tocopherol was more effective in inhibiting hydroperoxides at low levels, being 100 mg/kg its optimal concentration, while delta-tocopherol displayed optimal protection at 1000 mg/kg. Under the oxidation conditions applied, neither alpha- nor delta-tocopherol showed a protective effect on hydroperoxide decomposition at any level assayed. Formation of keto- and hydroxy-dienes was more related to the concentration of their hydroperoxide precursors. Furthermore, both tocopherols gave rise to increased concentrations of ketodienes at 500 and 1000 mg/kg compared to the controls. Such an effect was more pronounced for alpha-tocopherol and in the HL samples.

40|$|It has {{traditionally}} been believed that the function of intracellular lipid binding proteins (iLBPs) is to solubilize and chaperone endogenous ligands in aqueous spaces and to facilitate their transport across the cytosol. In recent years, however, {{it has become increasingly}} clear that iLBPs are also able to bind to a diverse range of poorly water soluble compounds and are therefore likely to be involved in a range of additional functions. Notably, iLBPs have been shown to play specific roles in regulating the biological activities and metabolic properties of their ligands. For example, a number of proteins of the fatty acid binding protein (FABP) class of iLBPs have been shown to promote the transport of their ligands to the nucleus and to facilitate the activation of specific nuclear hormone receptors (NHRs). There are nine different subtypes of human FABPs. The current studies have focussed on liver FABP (hLFABP) and intestine FABP (hIFABP), since these iLBPs are highly expressed in organs that play significant roles in lipid processing and are important target organs in metabolic disease. The ability of hLFABP and hIFABP to bind a broad range of compounds including long chain fatty acids (LCFAs), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors alpha (PPARα) agonists and other drug molecules has been studied using fluorescence spectroscopy. The ligand binding abilities of these FABPs has been further characterized by isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) and a structural insight into the binding relationships has been probed by resolving the structure of several different protein-ligand complexes. hIFABP ligand binding studies were undertaken using a fluorescence displacement assay and showed that ketorolac is able to displace the fluorescent probe 11 -dansylamino undecanoic acid (DAUDA), but not an alternate fluorescent probe, 1 -anilinonapthalene 8 - sulfonic acid (ANS). The thermodynamics of binding was investigated using ITC, which revealed differences in the mode of binding of these ligands. Thus, ketorolac displayed a unique thermodynamic profile that involved an entropy driven, endothermic binding interaction with hIFABP, in contrast to the more commonly observed exothermic and enthalpy driven interaction for most other ligands (including LCFA, most drugs and the model fluorophores) with hIFABP. The X-ray crystal structure of the DAUDA-hIFABP complex was subsequently determined and revealed a FA-like binding mode where the carboxylate of DAUDA formed a network of hydrogen bonds with residues {{at the bottom of the}} binding cavity and the dansyl group interacted with residues in the portal region. For ANS, NMR chemical shift perturbation (CSP) data also indicated binding deep inside the β-barrel, whereas ketorolac appeared to occupy the portal region of hIFABP. The CSP data further suggested that both ANS and ketorolac were able to bind simultaneously to hIFABP, consistent with the lack of displacement observed by fluorescence. The NMR solution structure of the ketorolachIFABP complex was subsequently determined and confirmed a newly characterized, hydrophobic ligand binding site in the portal region of hIFABP. The binding of endogenous ligands to hIFABP was further characterized via a detailed evaluation of oleate binding using ITC and NMR spectrometry. The ITC data showed that oleate binding occurred with low micromolar affinity (KD: 0. 8 μM) and via an enthalpy driven process. NMR titration studies subsequently revealed that the complex was in slow exchange on the NMR time scale. The overall binding pose of oleate was consistent with previous data describing the rat IFABP (rIFABP) oleate complex. A similar ion pair interaction between the carboxylate of oleate with Arg 106 and Trp 82 of hIFABP was consistent with the enthalpy driven binding. Two populations of <b>oleate</b> <b>methyl</b> protons were apparent in the bound state compared to a single population in free oleate. The presence of major and minor populations suggests that there are two distinct binding modes – although the stoichiometry of the interaction was found to be 1 : 1. This is most consistent with a model in which oleate is bound at a single site in hIFABP but can adopt two different conformations at that site. The fact that distinct resonances were only observed for the <b>methyl</b> protons of <b>oleate</b> and there were no clearly observed peaks reflecting a minor conformation either for other oleate resonances, or for protein resonances in hIFABP, suggests that the two bound conformations are highly similar. Cell based assays were subsequently employed to probe the impact of ligand binding on FABP cellular distribution and in particular the ability of hIFABP and hLFABP to promote nuclear localization and ligand activation of PPARα. Interestingly, while all the PPARα agonists examined bound to hI and hLFABP, the ability of these drugs to stimulate nuclear redistribution and PPAR activation was ligand and FABP specific. Thus, in the presence of GW 7647, hLFABP, but not hIFABP, preferentially redistributed to the nucleus, and enhanced ligand activation of PPARα (when compared to the absence of hLFABP). In contrast, nuclear localization of hIFABP (but not hLFABP) and PPAR activation was enhanced in the presence of fenofibrate. Interestingly, nuclear localization of hIFABP and hLFABP did not appear to be mediated via binding to importins, in contrast to previous data obtained with adipocyte FABP (AFABP). The binding of GW 7647 to hLFABP was subsequently examined and revealed a nanomolar binding affinity (KD: 115 nM), favorable enthalpy and entropy of binding and a binding stoichiometry of 1 : 1, instead of the widely reported 1 : 2 binding stoichiometry for hLFABP binding to LCFA. We hypothesize that ligand binding to FABPs results in a conformational change that stabilizes a direct protein-protein interaction between PPAR and hI and hLFABP and that this is the mechanisms of nuclear localization and PPAR activation. To support this suggestion, the structure of GW 7647 bound to hLFABP was solved in an attempt to provide evidence of conformational change on binding. The data suggest that ligand binding does indeed result in conformational change and redistribution of charge on the protein surface. Specifically, GW 7647 binding led to opening of the portal cavity due to movement of key internal side chain residues (I 52, M 74 and R 122), a shift in the position of β strands βD and βF and movement in the helix-turn-helix lid of holo hLFABP. Significant conformational change on one side of holo hLFABP was also observed including protrusion of K 57, E 77, F 95 and K 96, making them more accessible to surface interaction. This raises the possibility that this is a site of protein-protein interaction with PPARα and will be the subject of future studies. Together these studies advance knowledge of the structure and mechanisms of ligand binding to FABP. They also provide an insight into a potential role for FABP in regulating the intracellular activity of its ligands...|$|R

The effect of temperature and pressure on activity and product distribution (mainly C 17 and C 18 hydrocarbons) were studied. Hydrolysis of the methyl ester results in fatty acid intermediates, which are converted by direct hydrodeoxygenation to C 18 hydrocarbons or decarbonated (by decarbonylation or decarboxylation) to C 17 hydrocarbons. Reactant inhibition is more pronounced {{for the former}} route. The reaction is hardly inhibited by H 2 S, H 2 O, CO and tetralin solvent. H 2 S {{and to a lesser}} extent H 2 O increase the C 17 /C 18 hydrocarbon ratio, because they inhibit direct hydrodeoxygenation more than decarbonation. The catalyst surface contains different sites for direct hydrodeoxygenation and decarbonation reactions. During <b>methyl</b> <b>oleate</b> HDO, the catalyst slowly deactivated, mainly due to blocking of Lewis acid sites of the alumina support that catalyze <b>methyl</b> <b>oleate</b> hydrolysis.

Enzymatic esterification was performed and the efficiency of CRL–MWCNTs was evaluated against the free CRL under varying conditions, viz. temperature, molar ratio of acid/alcohol, solvent log P, and enzyme loading.

Utilization of CRL-MWCNTs nanoconjugates resulted in a higher acid conversion in the synthesis of <b>methyl</b> <b>oleate</b> (79. 85 % at 11 h of reaction time) {{when compared with the}} free CRL i. e. an approximately 1. 5 -fold improvement over the free CRL. The highest percentage of esterification (83. 62 %) was observed following the use of nonionic surfactant when compared with the anionic and cationic ones. The CRL-MWCNTs nanoconjugates could be used up to 5 cycles, retaining 50 % of its residual activity. Since the preparation of the CRL-MWCNTs nanoconjugates was facile and cheap while producing reasonable yield, the CRL-MWCNTs nanoconjugates developed here were found as promising biocatalysts for the production of <b>methyl</b> <b>oleate...</b>|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{performance}} of loofa-immobilized Rhizopus oryzae (as a whole-cell biocatalyst) in {{the synthesis of}} <b>methyl</b> <b>oleate</b> was evaluated using oleic acid as a model substrate. The activities of the cell-bound lipase {{in terms of the}} esterification and hydrolysis reactions were found to be higher for the immobilized cells as compared with those of the free cells. The time to reach equilibrium for <b>methyl</b> <b>oleate</b> synthesis was 12 h in the presence of n-hexane (hexane:oleic acid ratio 9 : 1 (v/v)), and the yield was 80 %. In the absence of solvent, equilibrium was reached after 48 h and the yield was only 30 %.

Besides oleic acid in the biomass, an increase of the branched chain fatty acid contents was observed: from 1. 6 to 2. 1 fold in the medium with <b>methyl</b> <b>oleate</b> and 2. 5 - 2. 9 in the medium with Tween 80 compared to the base medium. These two additives act differently on {{the growth of the}} producing strain and the uptake of valine, an essential nutrient. A decreased proteolytic activity and similar cellular fatty acid profiles indicate that the main effect of the added compounds is to facilitate the excretion of antibiotics to the outer medium, thus increasing biosynthesis...|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 2014 Existing {{pressure}} sensitive adhesives (PSAs) are mostly based on petrochemicals. In this study, a novel PSA {{based on a}} renewable material, <b>methyl</b> <b>oleate,</b> was prepared and characterized. <b>Methyl</b> <b>oleate</b> was first epoxidized to form epoxidized <b>methyl</b> <b>oleate</b> that was subsequently hydrolyzed and acidified to form epoxidized oleic acid (EOA) which is an AB-type monomer containing both a carboxylic acid group (A) and an epoxy group (B). Various methods for the preparation of EOA with high purity were extensively studied. EOA was homopolymerized {{in the presence of}} a catalyst to generate a polyester that could serve as a PSA. Various catalysts were investigated for their effectiveness on the homopolymerization, and chromium (III) tris(acetylacetonate) was found to be the most effective catalyst. Effects of the EOA purity on the PSA properties of the resulting polyesters were investigated in detail; the EOA purity of at least 97 % was found to be required for the preparation of the PSA with superior properties. The crosslinking of the polyesters with very small amount of crosslinking agents was able to further improve the overall properties, especially the aging resistance of the resulting PSAs. Among various crosslinking agents investigated, polymeric methylene diphenyl diisocyanate was the most effective in improvement of the PSA properties. The PSAs were evaluated for their peel strength, tack force, shear resistance, and aging resistance. The PSAs were characterized for their viscoelastic properties, thermal properties, thermal stability, and chemical structures. ...|$|E
