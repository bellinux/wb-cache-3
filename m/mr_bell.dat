5|$|The episode {{opens with}} Drew (Drew Carey) {{and his friends}} Lewis Kiniski (Ryan Stiles) and Oswald Lee Harvey (Diedrich Bader) in their local bar, the Warsaw Tavern, {{discussing}} Brad Pitt. The following day, Drew's best friend Kate O'Brien (Christa Miller) tells him that she has broken up with her boyfriend, who then fired her from {{her job as a}} receptionist at his body shop. Desperate for a job, Kate asks Drew to hire her at the Winfred-Louder department store where he is the assistant director of personnel. Drew insists that he cannot hire his friends. At Winfred-Louder, Drew's boss <b>Mr.</b> <b>Bell</b> (Kevin Pollak) asks him to hire someone for a position at the cosmetics counter. While conducting interviews, Drew meets Mimi Bobeck (Kathy Kinney), a hostile woman who wears too much eye shadow. Drew tries to be polite, but Mimi soon realizes {{he is not going to}} give her the job and accuses Drew of being sexist. Mimi complains to <b>Mr.</b> <b>Bell</b> about Drew, getting him into trouble.|$|E
5|$|Later at the Warsaw Tavern, Drew {{is hanging}} out with his friends when Mimi walks in and confronts him. Drew talks to her {{honestly}} about why she {{did not get the}} job, telling her that her attitude is the problem and she has to {{deal with the fact that}} her looks might stop her from getting some jobs. Mimi does not like Drew's advice and leaves the bar. Needing to fill the cosmetics position quickly, Drew believes he has found an ideal candidate in Natalie (Natasha Silver) until Kate turns up to apply for the job. Drew admits that he is worried that Kate will hate him if he has to fire her. However, <b>Mr.</b> <b>Bell</b> insists Drew hire Kate, having seen her in the lobby and Drew agrees. Kate later comes to Drew's house to ask him, Lewis and Oswald, which perfume samples to promote. The episode ends with Drew playing pool in his garden in the rain, while the others watch through the window.|$|E
25|$|Nineteen-year-old Margaret Hale happily {{returns home}} from London to the idyllic {{southern}} village of Helstone after her cousin Edith marries Captain Lennox. She lived for almost 10 {{years in the}} city with Edith and wealthy Aunt Shaw {{to learn to be}} a young lady. Margaret has refused an offer of marriage from the captain's brother, Henry, an up-and-comng barrister. Her life is turned upside down when her father, the local pastor, leaves the Church of England and the rectory of Helstone as a matter of conscience; his intellectual honesty has made him a dissenter. At the suggestion of <b>Mr.</b> <b>Bell,</b> his old friend from Oxford, he settles with his wife and daughter in Milton-Northern (where <b>Mr.</b> <b>Bell</b> was born and owns property). The industrial town in Darkshire (a textile-producing region) manufactures cotton and {{is in the middle of}} the Industrial Revolution; masters and workers are clashing in the first organised strikes.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{wish to see}} <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Bell.</b> Is {{not this}} <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Bell's</b> house?" [...] said the young man, shaking the snow {{from out of the}} breast of his coat.|$|R
6000|$|... "I suppose he's gone to {{look for}} us!" [...] <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Bell</b> saved the {{situation}} with a protecting laugh. Miss Gerald colored intelligently, and Lanfear could not let <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Bell's</b> implication pass.|$|R
60|$|There {{were four}} or five days left for {{courtship}} before Hetta and Mr. Beckard would return; {{four or five}} days during which Susan might be happy, Aaron triumphant, and <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Bell</b> nervous. Days I have said, but after all it was only the evenings that were so left. Every morning Susan got up to give Aaron his breakfast, but <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Bell</b> got up also. Susan boldly declared her right to do so, and <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Bell</b> found no objection which she could urge.|$|R
25|$|The {{sale was}} later {{the cause of}} a lawsuit in 1886 against the Maillers and McGregor when Mr Edwarde and <b>Mr</b> <b>Bell</b> {{attempted}} to recover A£78,582 for a short delivery on the delivery of stock from the station. The plaintiffs complained that there were only 9,000 cattle and 400 sheep instead of 12,000 cattle and 2,000 sheep as a minimum as promised. The defendants offered a rebate of A£7,752. The court found in favour of the plaintiffs, but charges of fraud against the defendants were dropped.|$|E
25|$|The {{theme of}} power is also central. Thornton {{represents}} three aspects {{of power and the}} authority of the ruling class: a manufacturer respected by his peers (economic power), a magistrate (judicial power) and someone who can summon the army (political power) to quell the strike (Stoneman, 1987, pp.124–126). There is energy, power and courage in the struggle for a better life by Milton's residents. Margaret demonstrates power in her verbal jousting with Thornton, forcing him to reflect on the validity of his beliefs (Gaskell, 1855, chapter 15) and eventually change his view of workers from mere providers of labour to individuals capable of intelligent thought. When she reaches age 21 Margaret takes control of her life, resolves to live as she chooses and learns how to manage wealth inherited from <b>Mr.</b> <b>Bell.</b>|$|E
25|$|The fourth series {{features}} Nero, now in {{the main}} role, and his crew have replaced Josh and the Elmsbury gang who have all temporarily departed the series (except Isaac, who becomes Elmsmere's caretaker) and Dexter {{is trying to make}} it as an accomplished teacher, but is given the new job of taking care of Nero's shenanigans, which indirectly resembles Josh and Nathan's relationship in the first series. The teachers who appeared in series 3, Miss Parkwood and Aine O'Brien do not appear in this series, leading to the re-introduction of former head teacher Anita Andress (Liz Hume-Dawson). The series also introduced a new main character, rebellious and cynical tomboy Clem Burton (Jade Alleyne), who joins Nero's crew as well as mysterious spray paintings of Andress appear around Elmsmere, called 'The Phantom Sprayer', however it was later revealed that it was <b>Mr.</b> <b>Bell</b> who was the criminal. A new love interest for Dexter, Science teacher Lizzie Baker (Sarah Schoenbeck), is introduced in episode one. A new recurring character, Isobel Harlow (Ruby Barnhill) appears from episode three. This series also features mini cameos from Josh's gang as shown in the series premiere and series finale. Nathan also makes his comeback in two episodes.|$|E
60|$|There {{was nobody}} but <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Bell</b> in the house, at that time, besides Mary Erskine and the baby. Bella {{had gone to}} <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Bell's</b> house, and Mary Bell {{was taking care of}} her. Albert beckoned his wife to come to him, and said to her, in a faint and feeble voice, that he wished <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Bell</b> to write {{something}} for him. Mary Erskine immediately brought her work-table up to the bedside, opened the drawer, took out one of the sheets of paper and a pen, opened the inkstand, and thus made every thing ready for writing. <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Bell</b> took her seat by the table in such a manner that her head was near to Albert's as it lay upon the pillow.|$|R
60|$|<b>Mrs.</b> <b>Bell</b> unwound {{the scarf}} from her bonnet {{and shook the}} frost {{crystals}} from it. In the porch Flora Jane Fletcher and her sister, Mrs. Harmon Andrews, were talking in low whispers. Presently Flora Jane put out her lank, cashmere-gloved hand and plucked <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Bell's</b> shawl.|$|R

500|$|Pinter's {{acting career}} spanned over 50 years and, {{although}} he often played villains, included {{a wide range}} of roles on stage and in radio, film, and television. [...] In addition to roles in radio and television adaptations of his own plays and dramatic sketches, early in his screenwriting career he made several cameo appearances in films based on his own screenplays; for example, as a society man in The Servant (1963) and as <b>Mr.</b> <b>Bell</b> in Accident (1967), both directed by Joseph Losey; and as a bookshop customer in his later film Turtle Diary (1985), starring Michael Gambon, Glenda Jackson, and Ben Kingsley.|$|E
500|$|Margaret's father dies in Oxford and {{she leaves}} the north to stay with {{relatives}} in London, but her godfather, <b>Mr.</b> <b>Bell,</b> makes over his fortune to her when he finds out {{that he has a}} terminal illness and chooses to move to Argentina for the better climate. Margaret becomes the owner of Marlborough Mills and John Thornton's landlord. Thornton, having discovered the truth about Fred from Mr. Higgins, goes south to see Margaret's home town, and on the way back meets her returning from a visit to the north. She proposes a business deal by which the factory can be reopened; after this the two share a kiss. Their final scene takes place on the railway station platform with both going [...] "home" [...] to Milton.|$|E
500|$|Afterward Nikki vanishes {{with the}} cougar (whom she names [...] "Murray"). Loudon visits <b>Mr.</b> <b>Bell</b> to {{apologize}} for losing the animal, to find Nikki had delivered Murray and {{was waiting for him}} at Mr. Bell's home. He has created a Brazilian rainforest filled with animals on top of his roof. There Nikki and Loudon— who had become close with each other on their journey— express their love for each other, and Murray finds a partner. Loudon delivers Nikki to the bus station the next morning, but Nikki becomes broken-hearted, realizing that she has to go back to Philadelphia, leaving Loudon, who is about to get married. While on the bus, she opens an envelope in the security box and finds the photographs that prove that Mr. Worthington is an embezzler and he was the mastermind behind the theft. Nikki gate-crashes the wedding, gets Mr. Worthington arrested and proclaims her love for Loudon. The film ends with Nikki and Loudon riding off into the sunset on a bus to Philadelphia, with Murray and his partner chasing after them.|$|E
6000|$|... "Mother," [...] she said, when <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Bell</b> once {{went up to}} her, [...] "you won't tell Hetta and Phineas, will you? Not to-day, I mean?" [...] <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Bell</b> {{agreed that}} it would be better not to tell them. Perhaps she thought that she had already {{depended}} too much on Hetta and Phineas in the matter.|$|R
60|$|Mary Erskine {{accordingly}} went to {{the stoop}} where <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Bell</b> was sitting, and took a seat upon the bench {{at the side of}} <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Bell,</b> though rather behind than before her. There was a railing along behind the seat, {{at the edge of the}} stoop and a large white rose-bush, covered with roses, upon the other side.|$|R
60|$|It was evident, however, that Mary Erskine was {{inclined}} to accept this proposal, from a conversation which took place between her and <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Bell</b> the next evening. It was after tea. The sun had gone down, and the evening was beautiful. <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Bell</b> {{was sitting in a}} low rocking-chair, on a little covered platform, near the door, which they called the stoop. There were two seats, one {{on each side of the}} stoop, and there was a vine climbing over it. <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Bell</b> was knitting. Mary Bell, who was then about six years old, was playing about the yard, watching the butterflies, and gathering flowers.|$|R
500|$|Margaret Hale (Daniela Denby-Ashe) and {{her parents}} Maria (Lesley Manville) and Richard (Tim Pigott-Smith) move to the (fictional) {{industrial}} town of Milton, Darkshire, {{in the north of}} England because her father, a clergyman, decides to leave the Church of England and become a Nonconformist. [...] Thanks to his friend, <b>Mr.</b> <b>Bell</b> (Brian Protheroe), he is able to find a house and gains employment as a private tutor. [...] One of his pupils is local mill-owner John Thornton (Richard Armitage), who gets off to a bad start with Margaret when she witnesses him beating a worker whom he has caught smoking in the mill, thus endangering all the workers. Gradually, Margaret gets used to Thornton, but his mother Hannah (Sinéad Cusack) and sister Fanny (Jo Joyner) disapprove of her, believing her haughty and alien to the customs of the North. In the meantime, Margaret attempts to do charitable work among the working classes, and thus comes into contact with Nicholas Higgins (Brendan Coyle) and his daughter, Bessy (Anna Maxwell Martin), who contracted Pneumoconiosis from exposure to the cotton-fibres in the mills. [...] When Bessy became ill at Hamper's Mill, her father moved her to Marlborough Mills, Thornton's mill, because the working environment is better there. In a meeting with fellow mill owners, Thornton says he had a wheel for ventilation installed in all of the rooms of his factory, {{despite the fact that it}} costs a great deal of money. The other industrialists had refused to install a wheel because of the expense.|$|E
2500|$|Nicholas, at Margaret's prodding, {{approaches}} Thornton {{for a job}} {{and eventually}} obtains one. [...] Thornton and Higgins learn to appreciate and understand each other. Mr. Hale visits his oldest friend, <b>Mr.</b> <b>Bell,</b> in Oxford. He dies there, and Margaret returns to live in London with Aunt Shaw. She visits Helstone with <b>Mr.</b> <b>Bell</b> and asks him to tell Thornton about Frederick, but <b>Mr.</b> <b>Bell</b> dies before he can do so. He leaves Margaret a legacy which includes Marlborough Mills and the Thornton house.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Mr.</b> <b>Bell</b> said, in a half-sad and half-complaining tone: [...] "I {{see that}} none of my old friends were over to hear me speak." [...] "No," [...] said Mr. Brownlow, [...] "we were not present, and did not intend being. We {{did not wish to}} witness the {{spectacle}} of your being surrounded by your enemies, who a few months ago were denouncing you as a traitor. We did not wish to hear these men shouting for you and see you in a such a position." [...] Mr. Brownlow then poured forth a torrent of abuse and denunciation of secession. <b>Mr.</b> <b>Bell</b> made no attempt to defend them, nor indeed to defend his own course.|$|E

2500|$|At {{one time}} {{a vial of}} poison {{was found in the}} flue of the chimney, and being taken down, Dr. George B. Hopson gave one drop to a cat, causing its death in seven seconds. The witch claimed to have put the poison there for the purpose of killing <b>Mr.</b> <b>Bell.</b> Being asked how it was going to {{administer}} the poison, it said by pouring it into the dinner pot. It is remarkable that, although he enjoyed good health up to the time of this event, <b>Mr.</b> <b>Bell</b> died within [...] days after the vial was found, being in a stupor {{at the time of his}} death. From this time the people visited the house less frequently, although the witch would now and then be heard.|$|E
2500|$|Going to {{the small}} {{telephone}} box with its slender wire attachments, <b>Mr.</b> <b>Bell</b> coolly asked, as though addressing someone in an adjoining room, [...] "Mr. Watson, are you ready!" [...] Mr. Watson, five miles away in Somerville, promptly answered in the affirmative, and soon was heard a voice singing [...] "America". [...] Going to another instrument, connected by wire with Providence, forty-three miles distant, <b>Mr.</b> <b>Bell</b> listened a moment, and said, [...] "Signor Brignolli, who is assisting at a concert in Providence Music Hall, will now sing for us." [...] In a moment the cadence of the tenor's voice rose and fell, the sound being faint, sometimes lost, and then again audible. Later, a cornet solo played in Somerville was very distinctly heard. Still later, a three-part song came over the wire from Somerville, and <b>Mr.</b> <b>Bell</b> told his audience [...] "I will switch off the song {{from one part of}} the room to another so that all can hear." [...] At a subsequent lecture in Salem, Massachusetts, communication was established with Boston, eighteen miles distant, and Mr. Watson at the latter place sang [...] "Auld Lang Syne", the National Anthem, and [...] "Hail Columbia", while the audience at Salem joined in the chorus.|$|E
2500|$|The {{text in the}} book, {{particularly}} the ending, differs significantly {{from that of the}} serialised episodes. Gaskell included a brief preface saying that due to the restrictive magazine format, she could not develop the story as she wished: [...] "Various short passages have been inserted, and several new chapters added". She tried to eliminate the limitations of a serialised novel (letter to Jameson cited by Alison Chapman, 1999, p.27) by elaborating on events after the death of Mr. Hale and adding four chapters: the first and last chapters and two chapters on the visits by <b>Mr.</b> <b>Bell</b> to London and by Margaret and <b>Mr.</b> <b>Bell</b> to Helstone. This edition also adds chapter titles and epigraphs. The preface concludes with a quotation from the conclusion of John Lydgate's Middle-English fable, The Churl and the Bird (spelling modernized).|$|E

60|$|The {{afternoon}} at <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Bell's</b> house was melancholy. The final {{decision of the}} three judges was as follows. There was to be no engagement; of course no correspondence. Aaron was {{to be told that}} it would be better that he should get lodgings elsewhere when he returned; but that he would be allowed to visit at <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Bell's</b> house,--and at <b>Mrs.</b> Beckard's, which was very considerate. If he should succeed in getting a permanent appointment, and if he and Susan still held the same mind, why then--&c. &c. Such was Susan's fate, as communicated to her by <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Bell</b> and Hetta. She sat still and wept when she heard it; but she did not complain. She had always felt that Hetta would be against her.|$|R
60|$|<b>Mrs.</b> <b>Bell</b> did not answer, {{but seemed}} to be {{thinking}} whether {{this would be the}} best plan or not.|$|R
2500|$|As {{the chapter}} titles [...] "First Impressions", [...] "Mistakes", [...] "Mistakes Cleared Up", [...] "Mischances" [...] and [...] "Atonement" [...] indicate, North and South is {{peppered}} with Margaret's blunders and problematic situations with other characters which create misunderstandings (O'Farrell, 1997, p.67). Some of Margaret's blunders stem from ignoring customs, some from not understanding them {{and still others}} from rejecting Milton's social customs (such as a frank, familiar handshake). Other characters fail to carry out important actions: Dixon does not tell Margaret that Thornton attended her mother's funeral, and <b>Mr.</b> <b>Bell</b> dies before he can explain to Thornton why Margaret lied. Margaret feels misunderstood, unable {{to take control of}} her life and explain a world she does not understand (O'Farrell, 1997, p.67).|$|E
2500|$|The {{newspaper}} Green Mountain Freeman of Vermont on Feb 7, 1856 republished a story {{regarding the}} Bell Witch legend and ascribed {{the story to}} the Saturday Evening Post. The Freeman was affiliated with the abolitionist Liberty Party. The unidentified author described the apparition as the 'Tennessee Ghost' or 'Bell Ghost,' and stated the event occurred 30 years or more {{from the time the}} article was written. There are three human characters in the account, <b>Mr.</b> <b>Bell,</b> his daughter Betsey Bell, and Joshua Gardner. The author stated that the voice, which spoke freely about the house from all directions, would not manifest itself until the lights were extinguished at night. The phenomenon attracted wide interest. The author claimed to have become well acquainted with Mr. Gardner. When the ghost was asked how long it would remain, it replied, [...] "until Joshua Gardner and Betsey Bell get married." [...] The author goes on to state that Betsey Bell {{had fallen in love with}} Joshua Gardner and had discovered the skill of 'ventriloquism'. The author states that Ms. Bell then used her skill to attempt to convince Joshua Gardner to marry her. When they did not marry, the apparition disappeared.|$|E
60|$|The {{next week}} <b>Mr.</b> <b>Bell,</b> senior, resumed his visits, {{and the young}} farmer came no more to the side door of No. 49. Jessamine missed him greatly. <b>Mr.</b> <b>Bell,</b> senior, never brought her clover or honeysuckle.|$|E

The musicians perform a free public concert of pieces arranged for four-part low brass in <b>Mr.</b> <b>Bell's</b> memory {{as a part of}} a fine arts series in Perry. Then the players gather at the gravesite and play 'Come Sweet Death' and 'Dona Nobis Pacem' in his memory.|$|R
60|$|Albert, it seems, was {{not aware}} how many {{witnesses}} were required.

When, however, <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Bell,</b> afterwards, in going home, met Mr. Keep and related to him the transaction, {{he said that he was}} afraid that the will was not good, meaning that it would not stand in law.|$|R
