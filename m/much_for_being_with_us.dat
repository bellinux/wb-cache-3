40|$|Justice, {{thank you}} so <b>much</b> <b>for</b> <b>being</b> <b>with</b> <b>us</b> today. It is a real {{privilege}} {{for us to get}} to talk to you this way, and we know for the entire audience.

We can 2 ̆ 7 t possibly cover all of this in the time we have this morning, but what we are hoping to do is {{talk a little bit about}} each of these roles, how each step you took influenced the rest, and then we will be throwing it open after our conversation for questions from the audience...|$|E

6000|$|... "It is sad," [...] {{continued}} the {{little old lady}} {{in a tone of}} contempt, [...] "that a youth like you should so much belie your looks. It was so mean of you to run away without a word of apology, just like a bad little boy, <b>for</b> fear of <b>being</b> scolded--not that I cared <b>much</b> <b>for</b> <b>being</b> run down <b>with</b> that horrid bicycle, for I was not hurt--though I might have been killed--but it was the cowardly way in which you left me lying helpless among bakers, and sweeps, and policemen, and dirty boys. Oh! it was disgraceful." ...|$|R

To all my friends, thank you so <b>much</b> <b>for</b> <b>being</b> there and <b>for</b> your patience. God bless...|$|R

But for heaven's sake don't tell Julia Tristram; I should not have a chance if she thought I was so slack." ...|$|R
60|$|He said it with dignity, {{exactly as}} he might have said they were dukes or lord chancellors; but Philip could not help pitying him, not so <b>much</b> <b>for</b> <b>being</b> descended from so mean a lot, as <b>for</b> <b>being</b> fool enough to {{acknowledge}} it on a gentleman's lawn at Brackenhurst. Why, with manners like his, {{if he had not}} given himself away, one might easily have taken him for a descendant of the Plantagenets.|$|R

60|$|It {{was cold}} enough {{at the summit}} to cool anything, {{imaginary}} or otherwise. Even devotion shivered, as, in duty bound, it admired the venerable temple and its yet more venerable tree. The roofs of the chalets stood weighted with rocks to keep them there, and the tree, raised aloft on its stone-girded parapet, stretched bare branches imploringly toward the sky. So <b>much</b> <b>for</b> <b>being</b> {{a mile or so}} nearer heaven, while still of the earth and earthy.|$|R

60|$|The genuine English patriot {{will know}} that the {{strength}} of England has never depended upon any of these things; that the glory of England has never {{had anything to do}} with them, except in the opinion of a large section of the rich and a loose section of the poor which copies the idleness of the rich. These people will, of course, think too much of our failure, just as they thought too much of our success. The typical Jingoes who have admired their countrymen too <b>much</b> <b>for</b> <b>being</b> conquerors will, doubtless, despise their countrymen too <b>much</b> <b>for</b> <b>being</b> conquered. But the Englishman with any feeling for England {{will know that}} athletic failures do not prove that England is weak, any more than athletic successes proved that England was strong. The truth is that athletics, like all other things, especially modern, are insanely individualistic. The Englishmen who win sporting prizes are exceptional among Englishmen, for the simple reason that they are exceptional even among men. English athletes represent England just about as much as Mr. Barnum's freaks represent America. There are so few of such people in the whole world that it is almost a toss-up whether they are found in this or that country.|$|R
6000|$|So <b>much</b> <b>for</b> <b>being</b> a Governor's widow! A {{woman of}} thrice Fanny's energy and {{capacity}} {{would not have}} effected her purpose so simply, and made the virago in the matron so entirely quail.

Francis, dear boy, the wicked people have been beating her! Oh, Miss Williams, look at her poor neck!" ...|$|R

The book provides significant insights through disclosures made by retired and serving police officials in which they present their perspective on events in Gujarat during the 2002 riots and subsequent contentious developments: the repeated police encounters.|$|R
