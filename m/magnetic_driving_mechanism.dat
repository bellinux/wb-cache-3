40|$|We {{present a}} dynamic {{study of the}} normal state thermal {{nucleation}} of a 2 μ-radius In granule, initially in an equilibrium metastable state {{in the presence of}} a <b>magnetic</b> field. The <b>driving</b> <b>mechanism</b> is the neutrino-indium collision which is assumed to provide a local energy deposition. An analytic expression for the quasiparticle and phonon temperatures Te (r, t) and Tp (r, t) characterizing the electron-phonon system is obtained for a central energy deposition. It is shown that both Te and Tp undergo large deviations everywhere in the grain for times up to 10 - 10 s; Tp remains non-uniform in the grain for a larger time than Te. At the grain surface, the quasiparticle temperature is seen to be a nonmonotonic function of time, even under the assumption of no energy loss towards the embedding paraffin. The superheating critical field is determined from the calculations of the surface energy barrier and the thermal nucleation is discussed...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. We {{review the}} main results from line-driven (LD) models of winds from {{accretion}} disks in cataclysmic variables (CVs). We consider LD disk wind {{models in the}} hydrodynamic (HD) and magnetohydrodynamic (MHD limits. We discuss the basic physical conditions needed for a disk wind to exist and the conditions for the wind to be steady or unsteady. We also discuss how the line-driven (LD) wind structures revealed in numerical simulations relate to observations. In particular, we present synthetic line profiles predicted by the LD wind models and compare them with observations. Our main conclusion is that, despite some problems, line-driving alone is the most plausible <b>mechanism</b> for <b>driving</b> the CV winds. This conclusion is related to two facts: 1) LD wind models are likely the best studied wind models, analytically and numerically, and 2) it is most likely that the predictive power of the LD wind models {{is much higher than}} of any other wind model so far. Preliminary results from LD-MHD wind models confirm that <b>magnetic</b> <b>driving</b> is likely an important element of the wind dynamics. However, <b>magnetic</b> <b>driving</b> {{does not seem to be}} necessary to produce a CV wind. The most important issues which need to be addressed by future dynamical models, regardless of <b>driving</b> <b>mechanism,</b> are the effects of the position-dependent photoionization and the dynamical effects in three dimensions. 1...|$|R

40|$|The North Atlantic {{is a key}} {{region for}} global climate variability. Earlier studies have shown changes in the {{large-scale}} circulation, air-sea heat and freshwater fluxes and the carbon cycle in the North Atlantic in relation to anthropogenic forcing, but changes attributed to natural variability are less certain. However, in order to fully comprehend the ocean carbon sink and its variability, both, anthropogenic and non-anthropogenic <b>driving</b> <b>mechanisms</b> need to be evaluated. The results of this thesis are presented in four papers. In the first paper, the impact of atmospheric forcing on convection in the subpolar North Atlantic, in particular with regard to ocean ventilation and carbon sequestration is presented based on a unique dataset collected during a winter cruise to the Irminger Sea. In the second paper, a long term perspective on inorganic carbon inventory changes and its natural and an- thropogenic components is given. Inventory changes were decomposed into their main <b>driving</b> <b>mechanisms</b> and related to the evolution and distribution of the main water masses in the Irminger Sea. The third paper discusses surface f CO 2 and pH trends across the Irminger Sea and Iceland Basin and their main <b>driving</b> <b>mechanisms.</b> The North Atlantic shows large decadal freshening and cooling signal, which produce a large non-anthropogenic <b>driving</b> <b>mechanism</b> on surface ocean f CO 2 trends. The fourth paper discusses pH changes in the interior Irminger Sea and the Iceland Basin {{as well as the}} <b>driving</b> <b>mechanisms</b> for the observed variability. Combined, the four papers in this thesis increase our understanding of fundamen- tal interactions between atmospheric, hydrographic and biogeochemical processes in the subpolar North Atlantic. In particular, trends associated to natural variability and an- thropogenic climate change are distinguished, which contribute {{to a better understanding of}} the variability of carbon cycle processes in the modern ocean. </p...|$|R
