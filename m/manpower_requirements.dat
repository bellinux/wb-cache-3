Under this program, some 200,000 soldiers attended colleges for intensive courses. Fitch was in the program {{for less than a}} year before the <b>manpower</b> <b>requirements</b> of the war became too great, and the Army terminated the program. Most of the soldiers in the ASTP were posted to combat units, but Fitch was one of a hundred or so ASTP soldiers who joined the Special Engineer Detachment (SED), which provided much-needed technicians to the Manhattan Project.|$|E
5|$|The {{deal was}} put on hold in April 1982, {{following}} {{the outbreak of the}} Falklands War. The performance of Invincible and other Royal Navy aircraft carriers during the conflict showed that the report which suggested reductions in the size of Britain's carrier fleet—with the follow-on effect of making Invincible available for sale—was flawed, and both sides withdrew from the deal in July. The RAN was again offered HMS Hermes, and again declined due to the carrier's age and <b>manpower</b> <b>requirements.</b> The Australian government began to reconsider the previous contenders for replacement, as well as considering requesting the United Kingdom or United States to build a simple carrier capable of operating F/A-18 Hornet strike fighters, but the issue was suspended at the commencement of the 1983 Australian Federal Election. On 14 March, following the election of Bob Hawke's Labor Government, the announcement was made that Melbourne would not be replaced.|$|E

Air-Sea rescue schools {{were set up}} at Blackpool, equipped with Avro Ansons. Conversion units, such as No. 6 OTU, was detailed to provide conversion training for crews, who were to fly the Consolidated Liberator, Boeing Fortress and Handley Page Halifax. Training still remained below what was needed, owing to <b>manpower</b> <b>requirements</b> on the front line. It was not until October 1944, that it became widely accepted to give crews refresher training on new types of aircraft, that this practice became policy. Even so, one conversion course {{was all that was}} afforded to any crew. Increasing the training hours from 72 to 87 helped in some respects. Also, by 1945, it had become standard practice for Squadron Leaders to visit and help the OTUs keep pace with changes operational difficulties, by reporting back to the schools on how best the OTU establishment could serve the needs of Squadrons, through training or otherwise.|$|E

The ProSeal laryngeal mask airway TM (PLMA) is emerging as a suitable alternative, both as a primary and a rescue airway device to the tracheal tube (TT) for patients undergoing surgery in the prone position. Materials and Methods: In this prospective randomized study, 70 patients scheduled to undergo pilonidal sinus excision in prone position were allocated to two groups of 35 patients each, depending on {{the position of the}} patient at induction and device placement: Group S (device placed while supine) and Group P (device placed while prone).

40|$|Basic {{process of}} Human Resource Planning (HRP) {{is not only}} to compare present human {{resources}} to future needs but also to identify skill and competency gaps. Competency gap analysis helps to develop required competency in line with the organisational mission, vision and strategic objec-tives.

Of-late HRP has become an important enterprise-wide strategic function not only to achieve goals and objectives but also to sustain present level in organisations. Globally, skili shortages, competency gap, redundan-cies, downsizing, rightsizing are the major issues in today's organisations. The biggest problem for manpower or human resource redundancy lies with inadequate Human Resource Planning (HRP).

2500|$|The early 1940s saw {{emerging}} {{trends in}} popular music and jazz that would, {{once they had}} run their course, result {{in the end of}} the swing era. [...] Vocalists were becoming the star attractions of the big bands. [...] Vocalist Ella Fitzgerald, after joining the Chick Webb Orchestra in 1936, propelled the band to great popularity and the band continued under her name after Webb's death in 1939. In 1940 vocalist Vaughn Monroe was leading his own big band and Frank Sinatra was becoming the star attraction of the Tommy Dorsey Orchestra, inciting mass hysteria among bobby-soxers. [...] Vocalist Peggy Lee joined the Goodman Orchestra in 1941 for a two year stint, quickly becoming its star attraction on its biggest hits. [...] Some big bands were moving away from the swing styles that dominated the late 1930s, for both commercial and creative reasons. [...] Some of the more commercial big bands catered to more [...] "sweet" [...] sensibilities with string sections. [...] Some bandleaders such as John Kirby, Raymond Scott, and Claude Thornhill were fusing swing with classical repertoire. [...] Lower <b>manpower</b> <b>requirements</b> and simplicity favored the rise of small band swing. [...] The Savoy Sultans and other smaller bands led by Louis Jordan, Lucky Millinder, Louis Prima, and Tony Pastor were showcasing an exuberant [...] "jump swing" [...] style that would lead to the postwar rise of R. [...] In a 1939 Downbeat interview, Duke Ellington expressed dissatisfaction with the creative state of swing music; within a few years he and other bandleaders would be delving into more ambitious, and less danceable, forms of orchestral jazz and the creative forefront for soloists would be moving into smaller ensembles and bebop. The Earl Hines Orchestra in 1943 featured a collection of young, forward-looking musicians who were {{at the core of the}} bebop movement and would in the following year be in the Billy Eckstine Orchestra, the first big band to showcase bebop.

2500|$|The trend {{away from}} big band swing was {{accelerated}} by wartime conditions and royalty conflicts. [...] In 1941 the American Society of Composers and Producers (ASCAP) demanded bigger royalties from broadcasters and the broadcasters refused. [...] Consequently, ASCAP banned the large repertoire they controlled from airplay, severely restricting what the radio audience could hear. [...] ASCAP also demanded pre-approval of set lists and even solos for live broadcasts, {{to assure that}} not even a quoted fragment of ASCAP repertoire was broadcast. [...] Those restrictions made broadcast swing much less appealing for {{the year in which}} the ban was in place. [...] Big band swing remained popular during the war years, but the resources required to support it became problematic. [...] Restrictions on automotive and rail travel, coupled with rising expenses, curtailed road touring. [...] The <b>manpower</b> <b>requirements</b> for big swing bands placed a burden on the scarce resources available for touring and were impacted by the military draft. In July 1942 the American Federation of Musicians called a ban on recording until record labels agreed to pay royalties to musicians. [...] That stopped recording of instrumental music for major labels for over a year, with the last labels agreeing to new contract terms in November 1944. In the meantime, vocalists continued to record backed by vocal groups and the recording industry released earlier swing recordings from their vaults, increasingly reflecting the popularity of big band vocalists. [...] In 1943 Columbia Records re-released the 1939 recording of All or Nothing at All by the Harry James Orchestra with Frank Sinatra, giving Sinatra top billing ("Acc. Harry James and his Orchestra"). [...] The recording found the commercial success that had eluded its original release. [...] Small band swing was recorded for small specialty labels not affected by the ban. [...] These labels had limited distribution centered in large urban markets, which tended to limit the size of the ensembles with which recording could be a money-making proposition. [...] Another blow fell on the market for dance-oriented swing in 1944 when the federal government levied a 30% excise tax on [...] "dancing" [...] nightclubs, undercutting the market for dance music in smaller venues.|$|E
