The variables used in the study are capital adequacy, asset quality, management efficiency, earnings quality, liquidity, size of bank and degree of risk aversion in relation to <b>asset</b> <b>liability</b> <b>management</b> to examine the return on equity (ROE), which is the measure of profitability of the banks. The quantitative analysis using correlation and regression analysis concluded that there is a positive relationship between <b>asset</b> <b>liability</b> <b>management</b> and the financial performance of the banks.

40|$|In this thesis, we {{are going}} to study <b>asset</b> <b>liability</b> <b>management</b> {{throughout}} the macroeconomic cycle in financial institutions. There are two important problems in financial institutions. The first is that <b>asset</b> and <b>liability</b> <b>management</b> has significant effects on the financial institution's value. The second is that in different stages of the macroeconomic cycle, the effect of <b>asset</b> and <b>liability</b> <b>management</b> approaches is not same. Therefore, the purpose of the thesis is to study how <b>asset</b> <b>liability</b> <b>management</b> causes economic consequences for financial institutions and in what capacity. In this thesis, based on the analysis of <b>asset</b> <b>liability</b> <b>management</b> and the economic cycle, we establish a dynamic system to simulate how a financial institution makes decision throughout economic cycles. In order to simulate the system, we established a model to reflect how the economic cycle affects the financial institution's value by using the economic relationship and we built up the decision making progress. Then we simulate the system through Matlab. From the simulation results, we can observe the changes of system in the given time horizon. by Jingsi Yan. Thesis (S. M.)

The Mexican experience displays interesting characteristics providing lessons for other countries that still need to design the decumulation phase of their newly established second pillars. At the same, time it raises some technical and policy concerns that need addressing as they could hamper, in the future, the healthy development of the market. The paper concludes that: 1) general life insurance companies may better hedge longevity risk than specialized annuity companies; 2) competition should be based on prices rather than additional products; 3) better disclosure of options under the 1973 and 1997 social security laws should be given to disability and life annuitants; and 4) various measures should be taken to improve <b>asset</b> <b>liability</b> <b>management</b> including allowing companies to trade over the counter derivatives and substituting over time the regulatory <b>asset</b> <b>liability</b> <b>management</b> framework with an economic <b>asset</b> <b>liability</b> <b>management</b> framework.

40|$|Financial {{institutions}} require sophisticated {{tools for}} risk management. For company-wide risk management {{both sides of}} the balance sheet should be considered, resulting in an integrated <b>asset</b> <b>liability</b> <b>management</b> approach. Stochastic programming models suit these needs well and have already been applied in the eld of <b>asset</b> <b>liability</b> <b>management</b> to improve nancial operations and risk management. The dynamic aspect of the nancial planning problems inevitably leads to multiple decision stages (trading dates) in the stochastic program and results in an explosion of dimensionality. In this paper we show that dedicated model generation, specialized solution techniques based on decomposition and high performance computing are the essential elements to tackle these large scale nancial planning problems. It turns out that memory management is a major bottleneck when solving very large problems, given an e cient solution approach and a parallel computing facility.

40|$|The 2008 {{financial}} crisis indicated {{the limitations of}} the <b>Asset</b> <b>Liability</b> <b>Management</b> models used to advise pension funds. The huge losses on the invested portfolios of pension funds were so unlikely according to the ALM model that they were deemed impossible. Combined with a very low interest rate huge drops in the coverage ratio of pension funds were realized, resulting in public disturbance. In this research a new method is proposed which includes a future crisis period within the investments. In this research the <b>Asset</b> <b>Liability</b> Man-agement Including Crisis for Assets Returns (ALMICAR) model is proposed, which incorporates crises periods within the existing <b>Asset</b> <b>Liability</b> <b>Management</b> (ALM) framework. In this way the ALMICAR model allows to incorporate a crisis directly into the decision making process for future investments of pension funds instead of using separate stress scenarios to evaluate the impact of a crisis. A comparison between the ALMICAR and AEGON’s ALM model is made. The research shows that the simulations for future returns made with the ALMICAR model are more realistic than the simulations from AEGON’s existing ALM model. As a result, pension funds are able to make more informed decisions on their investments...|$|R

40|$|<b>Asset</b> <b>liability</b> <b>management</b> (ALM) is the {{traditional}} risk management practice in banking. ALM is the coordinated and integrated <b>management</b> of <b>assets</b> and <b>liabilities.</b> Some studies argue that ALM lost importance due {{to the use of}} new risk mitigation tools by banks. This study aims to identify the role of ALM in the risk management of banks in Turkey. For this purpose, it analyzes the relationship between <b>assets</b> and <b>liabilities</b> of the banks by using canonical correlation for the period of 2002 - 2012. High canonical correlation indicates that dependency of <b>assets</b> and <b>liabilities</b> has been high for banks operating in Turkey. Canonical loadings also provide evidence for the coordinated <b>asset</b> and <b>liability</b> <b>management.</b> Thus, ALM is still very common in Turkish banking sector. Further analysis on liquidity of banks reveal that profitability, equity capital, illiquid assets and credit risk influence the liquidity. Besides, liquidity of public banks is higher than that of other banks...|$|R
