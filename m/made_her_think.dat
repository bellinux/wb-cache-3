500|$|Stead drew {{inspiration}} from many sources {{in order to create}} the novel. As a child growing up in a big city, she was interested in the small towns which <b>made</b> <b>her</b> <b>think</b> [...] "that in smaller places, everybody, even the kids, had special identities, where as in a city people are pretty anonymous". An idea began to form for a hidden society that also served as a small town.|$|E
500|$|The {{album was}} {{mentioned}} in the Starr Report, the late-1990s account of Independent Counsel Ken Starr's investigation of the Monica Lewinsky scandal. she wrote. I have it, too, and it's wonderful. Whenever I listen to song No. 5, I think of you.}} a mournful track on her 1997 Surfacing, was cited by Lewinsky as a song that <b>made</b> <b>her</b> <b>think</b> of Clinton.}} [...] After {{a visit to the}} White House in November 1997, Lewinsky wrote that she [...] "noticed you (President Clinton) had the new Sarah ...|$|E
500|$|Her father, Fraser C. Robinson III, {{died from}} {{complications}} from his illness in March 1991. She would later say {{that although he}} was the [...] "hole in my heart" [...] and [...] "loss in my scar", {{the memory of her}} father has motivated her each day since. Her friend Suzanne Alele died from cancer around this time as well, Obama later telling Katie Couric that the loss <b>made</b> <b>her</b> <b>think</b> of her contributions toward society and how well she was influencing the world from her law firm. This was seen as a turning point for Michelle.|$|E
60|$|The very {{brilliant}} pink which instantly overspread Amy's face <b>made</b> <b>her</b> mother <b>think</b> <b>her</b> warning more expedient.|$|R
6000|$|... "Of course he'll give it. I've a {{right to}} {{it as much as}} Augusta." [...] There was {{something}} in Gertrude's face as she said this which <b>made</b> <b>her</b> mother <b>think</b> that she would have her way.|$|R
6000|$|Arter {{that she}} treated {{me as if}} I was the dirt beneath ’er feet. She never spoke to me, but used to speak against me to other people. She was always talking {{to them about the}} [...] "sleeping-sickness" [...] and things o’ that kind. She said night-watchmen always <b>made</b> <b>’er</b> <b>think</b> of it somehow, but she didn’t know why, and she couldn’t tell you if you was to ask her. The only thing I was thankful for was that I wasn’t ’er husband. She stuck to ’im like his shadow, and I began to think at last it was a pity she ’adn’t got some thing to be jealous about and {{something}} to occupy her mind with instead o’ me.|$|R
2500|$|The {{story was}} {{partially}} inspired by Homes and Gardens Television (HGTV). [...] James is an ardent {{fan of the}} network's competitions between decorators and interior designers, and the programs <b>made</b> <b>her</b> <b>think</b> more about what redecorating may have been like during the Regency period. [...] Her research had shown that many noble families were essentially bankrupt and often sold their estates or lost them to gambling debts. [...] She speculated that the new owners, similar to those featured on HGTV shows, would want to redecorate.|$|E
6000|$|Maggie, however, {{was seeing}} for herself--it was another matter, [...] "The {{thing was that}} he <b>made</b> <b>her</b> <b>think</b> {{it would be so}} possible." ...|$|E
6000|$|Maggie stared--she {{had meant}} her father. But her vision seemed to spread. [...] "They both <b>made</b> <b>her</b> <b>think.</b> She wouldn't have thought without them." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah," [...] she repeated, with a pensive smile which <b>made</b> Kane <b>think</b> <b>her</b> quite pretty. [...] "Ah--he ez older--your Doctor Sparrlow--but YOU are strong, M'sieu." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{believe the}} Larramies were truly {{sorry to have}} me go. Each {{one of them in}} turn told me so. Mrs. Larramie again said to me, with tears in her eyes, that it <b>made</b> <b>her</b> shudder to <b>think</b> what that home might be {{if it had not been}} for me.|$|R
6000|$|Somehow this <b>made</b> <b>her</b> uneasy. 'I <b>think</b> you are {{speaking}} {{more like a}} bird than a boy now,' she said, holding back, and indeed he was even looking rather like a bird. 'After all,' she said, 'you are only a Betwixt-and-Between.' But it hurt him {{so much that she}} immediately added, 'It must be a delicious thing to be.' ...|$|R
60|$|The {{confession}} completely renewed {{her first}} shame--and {{the sight of}} Harriet's tears <b>made</b> <b>her</b> <b>think</b> that she should never be in charity with herself again.|$|E
60|$|That <b>made</b> <b>her</b> <b>think</b> {{better of}} me. She {{was of the}} kind, indeed, who think better of a man if they believe him to be idle.|$|E
60|$|That warning {{effectively}} checked her. Yet certain stirrings {{of conscience}} <b>made</b> <b>her</b> <b>think</b> {{of the man}} who had imperilled himself for her sake and her brother's.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ye mustn't mind me, miss," [...] said Will Rogers, in a deprecating tone. [...] "I'm--I'm sommut {{broke up}} an' discouraged, an' ain't th' man I used to be. Nell knows that, an' she orter came herself; but it jes' <b>made</b> <b>her</b> cry to <b>think</b> o' it, an' so I says I'll come an' {{do the best}} I kin." ...|$|R
60|$|It {{was true}} that the room was very close, rather medicinal, and not {{improved}} by Miss Gould's perfumes; {{but there was an}} alacrity about Elfie's movements, and a vehemence in the manner of her rejection of the said essences, which <b>made</b> <b>her</b> governess not <b>think</b> <b>her</b> case alarming, and she left her to the care of the young cousins, while trying to make up for her incivility by courteously listening to and answering her grandfather, and consuming the tea and sweet-cake.|$|R
50|$|Night of Day 27: Back at camp, the {{remaining}} castaways discussed Jon and Aira's pouty reactions {{during the previous}} Tribal Council. Ervic then expressed to Aubrey that Moi's comment about <b>her</b> <b>made</b> him <b>think</b> about his next move: take out Moi and Ahron first for not being in their core alliance.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I fear she {{has much}} to suffer. He <b>made</b> <b>her</b> <b>think</b> him not a marrying man, and put her off her guard. Did you say he was agreeable?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I've {{discovered}} it. I shall contrive {{for him to}} see {{her there}} on the first wet morning, which is when she practises. What <b>made</b> <b>her</b> <b>think</b> of it?' ...|$|E
60|$|This <b>made</b> <b>her</b> <b>think.</b> She {{was rather}} {{surprised}} to find that she did not intend her husband to be hopping for joy like a fish in a pond.|$|E
6000|$|... "Mamma {{is always}} sanguine," [...] she said, [...] "and {{it was only}} <b>her</b> {{colouring}} that <b>made</b> Lionel <b>think</b> <b>her</b> account hopeful. It must be better for him, poor fellow, to know the truth, than to have his mind unsettled with vain hopes. O dear! O dear! how sad it is, and at his age too! It breaks one's heart to think of it." ...|$|R
60|$|And was he {{not going}} to speak to her--not one human word of recognition? Men are the most curious and unreal creatures. After all he had <b>made</b> use of <b>her.</b> <b>Think</b> how he had pressed her hand gently but firmly down, down over his bruise, how {{he had taken the}} virtue out of her, till she felt all weak and dim. And after that was he going to relapse into his tough and ugly workman's hide, and treat {{her as if she were}} a pair of steps, which might let him down or hold him up, as might be.|$|R
2500|$|Carter {{travelled}} throughout Northern California {{and into}} Nevada, sending back her impressions of San Francisco, Carson City, Nevada City, and Marysville. Of San Francisco, {{she said it}} <b>made</b> <b>her</b> sad to <b>think</b> of how little sun the people saw there, and was dismayed at the divisions within the city's black community, so small as to be [...] "a mite on a mountain". The five weeks she spent in Carson City, on the other hand, were [...] "invigorating", and [...] "the black people there were doing well, and had pleasant homes." ...|$|R
6000|$|Laurie {{thanked her}} with a look that <b>made</b> <b>her</b> <b>think</b> in a sudden panic, [...] "Oh, deary me! I know he'll say something, and then what shall I do?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Upon my soul it is,"--was his answer, with a warmth {{which brought}} all the former Willoughby to her remembrance, {{and in spite}} of herself <b>made</b> <b>her</b> <b>think</b> him sincere.|$|E
60|$|For this, however, Gilbert {{seemed to}} have no force; he cried piteously, bewailed himself, vowed incoherently that he would never do so again, and if she had not pitied him so much, would have <b>made</b> <b>her</b> <b>think</b> him contemptible.|$|E
60|$|It {{is a fact}} to {{be noted}} that of the entire {{household}} only Lady Wetherby could fairly be described as happy. It took very little to make Lady Wetherby happy. Fine weather, good food, and a complete abstention from classical dancing--give her these and she asked no more. She was, moreover, delighted at Claire's engagement. It seemed to her, for she {{had no knowledge of}} the existence of Lord Dawlish, a genuine manifestation of Love's Young Dream. She liked Dudley Pickering and she was devoted to Claire. It <b>made</b> <b>her</b> happy to <b>think</b> that it was she who had brought them together.|$|R
60|$|Helene's hand, {{resting on}} Antoinette's shoulder, trembled there. It {{may well have}} been my own {{weakness}} which <b>made</b> me <b>think</b> <b>her</b> body swayed, which made me reach out as if to catch her. However marvellous her strength and fortitude, these could not last forever. And--Heaven help me--my own were fast failing. Once the room had seemed to me all in darkness. Then I saw the Vicomtesse leaning tenderly over her cousin and whispering in her ear, and Antoinette rising, clinging to her.|$|R
6000|$|... "Very easy talking! If you had {{but to do}} it!" [...] cried Lionel, impetuously {{wrenching}} {{the door}} open {{in spite of her}} gentle resistance, and running off determinately, leaving her, poor girl, in great despair, at having so completely failed either in comforting, softening, or bringing him to any kind of resigned feeling, having besides vexed him, <b>made</b> him <b>think</b> <b>her</b> unkind; and though this was unintentional, and might be better for him, just contradicted what his mother wished him to believe.|$|R
60|$|Wilfred looked sullen, but obeyed. Dolores {{could not}} call her aunt unjust, {{but as she}} look round, she met glances that <b>made</b> <b>her</b> <b>think</b> it prudent to shelter herself among the elders. Aunt Jane asked what the game was.|$|E
6000|$|Fleda {{received}} {{with the}} same stoicism the quiet immensity of this allusion {{to the person who}} had not known how. But it <b>made</b> <b>her</b> <b>think</b> a little, and the thought found utterance, with unconscious irony, in the simple interrogation: [...] "Mona?" ...|$|E
60|$|Rose blushed {{and tried}} to answer but could not. The {{beautiful}} splendid limbs {{of the young man}} flamed upon her with marvelous appeal. It was beautiful, and yet her training <b>made</b> <b>her</b> <b>think</b> it somehow not to be talked about.|$|E
60|$|She was {{surprised}} by the violence of her desire that he never should think of it again. For an instant it seemed to her impossible to surrender an intimacy, which might not be the intimacy of love, but was certainly the intimacy of true friendship, to any woman in the world. Cassandra would never understand him--she was not good enough for him. The letter seemed to her a letter of flattery--a letter addressed to his weakness, which it <b>made</b> <b>her</b> angry to <b>think</b> was known to another. For he was not weak; he had the rare strength of doing what he promised--she had only to speak, and he would never think of Cassandra again.|$|R
5000|$|On {{board the}} Carthage, Call has been {{released}} from the seat and is {{at one of the}} monitors when Blades comments on an explosion that occurred, separate from the one of the station. Call comments that it was Ripley finishing the job: [...] "She cleaned up the mess that we stumbled into. What the Connor virus told me -- about Skynet returning? She closed the book on that. I know she did. I forced her back out there. I got her into this. Im {{going to have to live}} with that. I hope she <b>made</b> <b>her</b> peace. I <b>think</b> she got <b>her</b> dignity back. And her soul, maybe. Yeah. And her soul. And maybe she saved mankinds soul in the bargain. Lets go home." ...|$|R
60|$|After all, she {{was able}} to listen to his sermon with outward calm. But it was a {{happiness}} to Mrs. Churton when Wood End House sent so large a contingent of worshippers to the village church, where the pew in which she had sat alone on so many Sundays--poor Mr. Churton's increasing ailments having prevented him from accompanying her--was so well filled. Glancing about her, as was her custom, to note which of her poor were present and which absent, she was surprised to see the carpenter Cawood, with his wife and little ones, his eyes resting on the young girl at her side, and it <b>made</b> <b>her</b> glad to <b>think</b> that she had not perhaps angled in vain for this catcher of silly fish.|$|R
