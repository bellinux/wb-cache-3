This paper {{combines}} a derivative-free hybrid optimization algorithm, generalize pattern search (GPS), with Treed Gaussian Processes (TGP) {{to create a}} new hybrid optimization algorithm. The goal is to use the method for top design of satellite system, in which the objective or constraint functions usually are computationally expensive black-box functions. TGP model partitions the design space into disjoint regions, and employs independent Gaussian Processes (GP) in each partition to represent the time consumption of true problem responses. Utilizing the TGP, we generate the new “promising ” points, which are the combination of model-predicted values and estimated model errors. Then, these points are used to guide GPS search in the design space efficiently. The hybrid optimization method is applied to top design of <b>multi-satellites</b> cooperated observation.

40|$|Abstract- GPS is {{the only}} fully-operational satellite-based {{positioning}} system currently available to all-inclusive users at no direct charge. Triggered by the value-added functionality and the innovative field operation interoperability brought by satellite positioning and navigation systems, GPS has been widely used by professionals and practitioners to address diverse applications such as navigation, surveying, mapping and engineering purposes. GPS utilizes the time-of-arrival (TOA) ranging concept based on the satellite-to-receiver signal transmission to determine one position. Apparently, the key limitations currently facing this <b>multi-satellites</b> system is the latency of signal arrival caused by the effect of troposphere {{where most of the}} world's weather takes place. The effect is much more pronounced in Malaysia as it is located at the equatorial region where the troposphere extends the most above the earth surface in comparison to any other region. High humidity climate caused by the spatial and temporal variability of water vapour content within the troposphere exaggerates the signal propagation effect even further thus affecting the accuracy of GPS derived positions. Result shows that by neglecting the use of tropospheric a priori model, maximum residuals in Easting, Northing and Height components due to tropospheric effect are 68. 880 cm, 68. 970 cm and 119. 100 cm respectively. Similarly, reaching to the minimum and maximum RMS value of 16. 8 and 29. 2 respectively, GPS Height component {{is by far the most}} affected component compared to the Horizontal components.

Maximum surface water extents derived from these datasets are largely different: similar to 13 x 10 (6) km(2) from GLWD, 5. 3 x 10 (6) km(2) from Matthews and Fung, similar to 6. 2 x 10 (6) km(2) from GIEMS, and similar to 10. 3 x 10 (6) km(2) from SWAMPS.

40|$|Traditional in situ {{observation}} interpolation {{techniques that}} provide rainfall data from rain gauges have limitations {{because they are}} discrete point-based data records, {{which may not be}} sufficient to assess droughts from a spatiotemporal perspective. Considering this limitation, this study has developed a run-off model—a fully satellite-based method for monitoring drought in Peninsular Malaysia. The formulation of the run-off deficit uses a water balance equation based on satellite-based rainfall and evapotranspiration data extracted respectively from calibrated TRMM <b>multi-satellites</b> precipitation analysis data (TMPA) and moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer data (MODIS). The run-off deficit was calculated based on per pixel spatial scale and allowed to produce the continuous and regular run-off maps. The run-off model was tested and evaluated in a one drought year (2005) within a span of three years (2003 – 2005) over the Kelantan (3448 km 2) and Hulu Perak (3672 km 2) catchments of Peninsular Malaysia. The validation results show that (1) monthly TMPA rainfall and MODIS evapotranspiration data significantly improved after calibration; (2) satellite-based run-off data is not only strongly correlated with actual steam flow, but also with spatiotemporal variation of run-off in drought-affected forest catchments. The most severely drought-affected forest catchments that experienced the run-off deficits were Hulu Perak, Ulu Gading, Gunung Stong and Relai over Kelantan. The real time run-off change analysis shows that drought started in January and reached its peak in July of 2005. It was therefore demonstrated that this fully satellite-based run-off deficit model is as good as a conventional drought-monitoring indicator, and can provide not only drought distribution information, but it also can reflect the drought-induced impacts on stream flow, forest catchment and land-use...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{in this work}} is to develop downscaling methodologies to obtain a long time record of inundation extent at high spatial resolution based on the existing low spatial resolution results of the Global Inundation Extent from <b>Multi-Satellites</b> (GIEMS) dataset. In semiarid regions, high-spatial-resolution a priori information can be provided by visible and infrared observations from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). The study concentrates on the Inner Niger Delta where MODIS-derived inundation extent has been estimated at a 500 -m resolution. The space-time variability is first analyzed using a principal component analysis (PCA). This is particularly effective to understand the inundation variability, interpolate in time, or fill in missing values. Two innovative methods are developed (linear regression and matrix inversion) both based on the PCA representation.

40|$|Geologic Carbon Sequestration (GCS) {{has been}} {{proposed}} global wide as one “clean coal” technology for mitigating the impacts of global warming. It uses underground reservoirs to store liquefied CO 2 that captured from air and found is an effective way for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. However, there is a concern of CO 2 leakage from public, and they demand 100 % assurance that the storage site is safe. A reliable and cost-effective system for the site safety monitoring is thus on the demand. In coop with the general knowledge of top soil contaminating with CO 2, to focus on vegetation stress above/around CO 2 sequestration sites can reflect the condition of soil composition. This vegetation stress can be detected indirectly by using the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) from satellite image data. In this thesis, this innovative change detection technique is called “GEOES NDVI”. The GEOS NDVI techniques were developed in order to utilize NDVI time series images. It {{is a combination of}} the strengths of spike detection and NDVI differencing to detect possible CO 2 leakage in sequestration sites in two scales level. It merges these techniques synergistically, allowing each to compensate for the deficiencies inherent in the other. The general strategy is to first confirm hotspot pixels using an NDVI difference image. Confirmed hotspots are then used to derive coarse, regional-level NDVI difference thresholds, followed by more restrictive local thresholds. On a very small local scale, the high resolution Landsat image time series can detect vegetation cover change related to plant stress. The techniques have been tested in three engineered carbon sequestration sites: Otway, Australia, and Ordos and Liulin, China. With its ability to verify vegetation changes using multi-temporal images from <b>multi-satellites</b> and differing resolutions the GEOS NDVI is an innovative technique for monitoring CO 2 sequestration sites in both short and long term...|$|R
40|$|Wetlands {{are a major}} {{emission}} source of methane (CH 4) globally. In this study, we evaluate wetland emission estimates derived using the UK community land surface model (JULES, the Joint UK Land Earth Simulator) against atmospheric observations of methane, including, for the first time, total methane columns derived from the SCIAMACHY instrument on board the ENVISAT satellite. Two JULES wetland emission estimates are investigated: (a) from an offline run driven with Climatic Research Unit–National Centers for Environmental Prediction (CRU-NCEP) meteorological data and (b) from the same offline run in which the modelled wetland fractions are replaced with those derived from the Global Inundation Extent from <b>Multi-Satellites</b> (GIEMS) remote sensing product. The mean annual emission assumed for each inventory (181 Tg CH 4 per annum over the period 1999 – 2007) {{is in line with}} other recently published estimates. There are regional differences as the unconstrained JULES inventory gives significantly higher emissions in the Amazon (by ~ 36 Tg CH 4 yr − 1) and lower emissions in other regions (by up to 10 Tg CH 4 yr − 1) compared to the JULES estimates constrained with the GIEMS product. Using the UK Hadley Centre's Earth System model with atmospheric chemistry (HadGEM 2), we evaluate these JULES wetland emissions against atmospheric observations of methane. We obtain improved agreement with the surface concentration measurements, especially at high northern latitudes, compared to previous HadGEM 2 runs using the wetland emission data set of Fung et al. (1991). Although the modelled monthly atmospheric methane columns reproduce the large-scale patterns in the SCIAMACHY observations, they are biased low by 50 part per billion by volume (ppb). Replacing the HadGEM 2 modelled concentrations above 300 hPa with HALOE–ACE assimilated TOMCAT output results in a significantly better agreement with the SCIAMACHY observations. The use of the GIEMS product to constrain the JULES-derived wetland fraction improves the representation of the wetland emissions in JULES and gives a good description of the seasonality observed at surface sites influenced by wetlands, especially at high latitudes. We find that the annual cycles observed in the SCIAMACHY measurements and at many of the surface sites influenced by non-wetland sources cannot be reproduced in these HadGEM 2 runs. This suggests that the emissions over certain regions (e. g. India and China) are possibly too high and/or the monthly emission patterns for specific sectors are incorrect. The comparisons presented in this paper show that the performance of the JULES wetland scheme is comparable to that of other process-based land surface models. We identify areas for improvement in this and the atmospheric chemistry components of the HadGEM Earth System model. The Earth Observation data sets used here will be of continued value in future evaluations of JULES and the HadGEM family of models...|$|R

30|$|Since such a {{large portion}} of the near-Earth space and upper {{atmosphere}} is involved in the disturbance produced by a magnetospheric sub-storm or magnetic storm, simultaneous multi-scale observations would be needed both in space and in the ionosphere. ESA’s Cluster mission was the first <b>multi-satellite</b> mission to address the question of resolving temporal and spatial ambiguity in the near-Earth space by using four satellites. Cluster had also an extensive ground-based coordination programme (e.g. Opgenoorth and Lockwood 1997; Amm et al. 2005). Another ongoing <b>multi-satellite</b> mission, the NASA Themis mission, is specifically dedicated to study sub-storms. Themis is supported by an extensive number of ground-based observatories in Canada, each including a magnetometer and an all-sky camera. In the future, new <b>multi-satellite</b> missions are expected. The Magnetospheric Multiscale Mission (MMS) is a NASA mission to study the Earth’s magnetosphere using four identical spacecraft flying in a tetrahedral formation, building upon the successes of the ESA Cluster mission. The MMS mission was launched successfully on March 12 th 2015.|$|E
40|$|NASA {{is rapidly}} moving towards {{the use of}} {{spatially}} distributed multiple satellites operating in near Earth orbit and Deep Space. Effective operation of such <b>multi-satellite</b> constellations raises many key research issues. In particular, the satellites {{will be required to}} cooperate with each other as a team that must achieve common objectives {{with a high degree of}} autonomy from ground based operations. The multi-agent research community has made considerable progress in investigating the challenges of realizing such teamwork. In this report, we discuss some of the teamwork issues that will be faced by <b>multi-satellite</b> operations. The basis of the discussion is a particular proposed mission, the Magnetospheric MultiScale mission to explore Earth's magnetosphere. We describe this mission and then consider how multi-agent technologies might be applied in the design and operation of these missions. We consider the potential benefits of these technologies as well as the research challenges that will be raised in applying them to NASA <b>multi-satellite</b> missions. We conclude with some recommendations for future work...|$|E
30|$|As for the <b>multi-satellite</b> solution, the radial current {{component}} {{needs to}} be completed by the inclination of the magnetic field, as outlined in Eq. (16), to represent the FAC density.|$|E
30|$|The {{observation}} with <b>multi-satellite</b> comparison manifests {{that the}} ESWs are {{strongly associated with}} the cold electron beams of a few hundreds of eV (0.4 ~ 1 keV) antiparallel to the local magnetic field {{which is consistent with}} the bump-on-tail instability.|$|E
40|$|Aerosol {{absorption}} {{is poorly}} quantified {{because of the}} lack of adequate measurements. It has been shown that the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) aboard EOS-Aura and the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) aboard EOS-Aqua, which fly in formation as part of the A-train, provide an excellent opportunity to improve the accuracy of aerosol retrievals. Here, we follow a <b>multi-satellite</b> approach to estimate the regional distribution of aerosol absorption over continental India for the first time. Annually and regionally averaged aerosol single-scattering albedo over the Indian landmass is estimated as 0. 94 +/- 0. 03. Our study demonstrates the potential of <b>multi-satellite</b> data analysis to improve the accuracy of retrieval of aerosol absorption over land...|$|E
40|$|The Integrated <b>Multi-satellitE</b> Retrievals for the Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) mission, IMERG, is {{the unified}} U. S. {{algorithm}} that provides merged Microwave Infrared (IR) satellite precipitation product for the U. S. GPM team. Even though IMERG record {{is still very}} short, 2014 - 2016, {{it is tempting to}} test if it captures ENSO and NAO signals as compared to the popular, still on-going, TRMM <b>Multi-satellite</b> Precipitation Analysis, TMPA. El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is the most significant mode of interannual variability of tropical ocean atmosphere. North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) impact is on monthly scales and is mostly an atmospheric mode in the North Atlantic. There exist well-defined, multivariate, indexes that represent ENSO and NAO conditions and phase...|$|E

40|$|We use global {{simulations}} of Earth's magnetosphere {{to assess the}} scientific return from a <b>multi-satellite</b> mission in the magnetosphere. We examine 4 different scenarios with 20, 40, 80, and 160 satellites, respectively. The satellite orbits are randomized with perigee distances ranging from 2 to 5 R(sub E), apogee distances between 10 and 50 R(sub E), and within +/- 5 R(sub E) of the geocentric solar ecliptic (GSE) equator. For each of these satellite configurations we examine the expected observations during a typical substorm by using time traces obtained from a global simulation at the satellite positions. The 160 satellite configuration yields sufficient information to distinguish between different substorm models without any temporal/spatial ambiguities. An 80 satellite configuration still provides sufficient information for this task, however for fewer events with good satellite conjunctions and with less statistical certainty. For constellations with fewer than 40 satellites time-space ambiguities are likely {{to remain in the}} observation. However, any <b>multi-satellite</b> constellation would be a quantum leap in magnetospheric research because of the unprecedented coverage of other regions, because it would enable new measurement techniques that are unique to <b>multi-satellite</b> missions, and because it would enable the use of data assimilation techniques in global models for the first time...|$|E
40|$|The {{impact of}} one or two missing passive {{microwave}} (PMW) input sensors on the end product of <b>multi-satellite</b> precipitation products is an interesting but obscure issue for both algorithm developers and data users. On 28 January 2013, the Version- 7 TRMM <b>Multi-satellite</b> Precipitation Analysis (TMPA) products were reproduced and re-released by National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Goddard Space Flight Center because the Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit-B (AMSU-B) and the Special Sensor Microwave Imager-Sounder-F 16 (SSMIS-F 16) input data were unintentionally disregarded in the prior retrieval. Thus, this study investigates the sensitivity of TMPA algorithm results to missing PMW sensors by intercomparing the “early” and “late” Version- 7 TMPA real-time (TMPA-RT) precipitation estimates (i. e., without and with AMSU-B, SSMIS-F 16 sensors) with an independent high-density gauge network of 200 tipping-bucket rain gauges over the Chinese Jinghe river basin (45, 421 km 2). The retrieval counts and retrieval frequency of various PMW and Infrared (IR) sensors incorporated into the TMPA system were also analyzed to identify and diagnose the impacts of sensor availability on the TMPA-RT retrieval accuracy. Results show that the incorporation of AMSU-B and SSMIS-F 16 has substantially reduced systematic errors. The improvement exhibits rather strong seasonal and topographic dependencies. Our analyses suggest that one or two single PMW sensors might {{play a key role in}} affecting the end product of current combined microwave-infrared precipitation estimates. This finding supports algorithm developers’ current endeavor in spatiotemporally incorporating as many PMW sensors as possible in the <b>multi-satellite</b> precipitation retrieval system called Integrated <b>Multi-satellitE</b> Retrievals for Global Precipitation Measurement mission (IMERG). This study also recommends users of satellite precipitation products to switch to the newest Version- 7 TMPA datasets and the forthcoming IMERG products whenever they become available...|$|E
