2500|$|Hutton hit on {{a variety}} of ideas to explain the rock {{formations}} he saw around him, but according to Playfair he [...] "was in no haste to publish his theory; for {{he was one of those}} who are much <b>more</b> <b>delighted</b> with the contemplation of truth, than with the praise of having discovered it". After some 25 years of work, his Theory of the Earth; or an Investigation of the Laws observable in the Composition, Dissolution, and Restoration of Land upon the Globe was read to meetings of the Royal Society of Edinburgh in two parts, the first by his friend Joseph Black on 7 March 1785, and the second by himself on 4 April 1785. Hutton subsequently read an abstract of his dissertation Concerning the System of the Earth, its Duration and Stability to Society meeting on 4 July 1785, which he had printed and circulated privately. In it, he outlined his theory as follows; ...|$|E
2500|$|His {{indifferent}} manner vanished {{as soon as}} {{he opened}} his mouth. [...] He went right to work. He turned up the cuffs of his shirt. [...] Next, he loosened his necktie, and soon after it he took it off altogether. [...] All the time, he was gaining upon his audience. [...] He soon had it as by a spell. [...] I never saw men <b>more</b> <b>delighted.</b> [...] He began to bubble out with humor. [...] For plain pungency of humor, it would have been difficult to surpass his speech. [...] The speech ended in a half-hour. [...] The bell that called to the steam cars sounded. [...] Mr. Lincoln instantly stopped. [...] ‘I am engaged to speak at Cambridge tonight, and I must leave.’ [...] The whole audience seemed to rise in protest. [...] ‘Go on! [...] Finish it!’ was heard on every hand. [...] One gentleman arose and pledged to take his horse and carry him across country. [...] But Mr. Lincoln was inexorable.|$|E
2500|$|On 14 January 1798, Hazlitt, in {{what was}} to prove {{a turning point in}} his life, {{encountered}} Coleridge as the latter preached at the Unitarian chapel in Shrewsbury. A minister at the time, Coleridge had as yet none of the fame that would later accrue to him as a poet, critic, and philosopher. Hazlitt, like Thomas de Quincey and many others afterwards, was swept off his feet by Coleridge's dazzlingly erudite eloquence. [...] "I could not have been <b>more</b> <b>delighted</b> if I had heard the music of the spheres", he wrote years later in his essay [...] "My First Acquaintance with Poets". It was, he added, as if [...] "Poetry and Philosophy had met together. Truth and Genius had embraced, under the eye and with the sanction of Religion." [...] Long after they had parted ways, Hazlitt would speak of Coleridge as [...] "the only person I ever knew who answered {{to the idea of a}} man of genius". That Hazlitt learned to express his thoughts [...] "in motley imagery or quaint allusion", that his understanding [...] "ever found a language to express itself," [...] was, he openly acknowledged, something he owed to Coleridge. For his part, Coleridge showed an interest in the younger man's germinating philosophical ideas, and offered encouragement.|$|E

2500|$|In July 1825 Scott {{acquired}} {{a copy of}} the Diary of Samuel Pepys, which had just been published for the first time, and according to his son-in-law J. G. Lockhart, [...] "I never observed him <b>more</b> <b>delighted</b> with any book whatsoever". [...] Later that year he read a manuscript copy of Byron's 1821 journal and was impressed by Byron's plan of writing a desultory, unsystematic record of his actions, thoughts and memories, which combined the maximum of interest for the reader with the minimum of effort for the writer. [...] Inspired by these two models, he opened his own new diary on November 20, 1825 and wrote the first entry. [...] Only two days later he noted doubts as to the stability of the publisher Archibald Constable & Co., which concerned him greatly since he had a large financial interest in the firm. [...] His worst fears were realized the following year when Constable failed, bringing James Ballantyne & Co., in which Scott was a partner, down with him. [...] Scott found himself personally liable for debts totalling more than £125,000. [...] He resolved to pay off the debts by his own labours as a novelist rather than accept bankruptcy, and the Journal records his unceasing efforts to do this as he writes a series of novels and histories, including Woodstock, The Surgeon's Daughter, The Fair Maid of Perth, Anne of Geierstein, Count Robert of Paris, The Siege of Malta, Bizarro, The Life of Napoleon Buonaparte and Tales of a Grandfather. [...] Other disasters are recorded in the Journal, such as the death of his wife in 1826, and a series of strokes which increasingly undermined his physical and mental powers. [...] In July 1828 he allowed the habit of keeping his journal to lapse for several months, but returned to the task from January 1829 to July 1829 and from May 1830 to May 1831. [...] In October 1831 he again resumed the Journal, having been offered £1000 or £1500 by his publisher Robert Cadell for some record of his forthcoming voyage to Malta and Italy. [...] He finally abandoned work on it in Naples in April 1832, the last entry ending {{in the middle of a}} sentence.|$|E
