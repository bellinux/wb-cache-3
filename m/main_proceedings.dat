40|$|This paper {{discusses}} the amendments introduced by Regulation (EU) No. 2015 / 848 {{on insolvency proceedings}} (recast) as concerns the coordination among insolvency proceedings. The recast Regulation {{on the one hand}} maintains the general framework of the pre-existing Regulation (EC) No. 1346 / 2000, based on the co-existence of the <b>main</b> insolvency <b>proceedings,</b> to be opened in the Member State where the debtor possesses the centre of his main interests (COMI), and secondary insolvency proceeedings, which may be opened in another Member State where the debtor possesses an establishment, with effects limited to the debtor’s assets present within that Member State. On the other hand, the recast Regulation introduces a series of amendments, inspired to the objective of securing the prevalence of the main insolvency proceeedings. These amndments tend to favour the concentration within the <b>main</b> insolvency <b>proceedings</b> of the whole of the operations inherent in the disposal of the insolvency of the debtor, so as to reduce as far as possible the need for secondary insolvency proceedings to be opened in another Member State. This aim is concretely pursued by granting extensive powers to the administrator of the <b>main</b> insolvency <b>proceedings,</b> among which, the power of undertaking to apply, as concerns the protection of creditors’ rights in respect of assets located in a Member State where secondary insolvency proceedings could have been opened, the same law as would have applied in case such proceedings were opened (s. c. “synthetic” or “virtual” secondary insolvency proceedings). The recast Regulation contains also express provisions dealing with jurisdiction on actions directly deriving from insolvency proceedings and closely linked with them, favouring their joinder, either before the courts of the Member State competent for the insolvency proceedings as such, or before the courts competent for other actions in civil and commercial matters to which they may be related. The new Regulation refrains instead from regulating the relationships between the insolvency proceedings and pending lawsuits or arbitral proceedings concerning assets of the debtor, which are left for domestic law to regulate, thereby exposing the uniformity in the application of the Regulation to the risk inherent in the differences among Member States’ laws on the subject. Furthermore, reflecting a traditional, strictly inter partes approach, the new Regulation, unlike the Brussels I recast Regulation, falls short of addressing the problems of coordination which might arise with proceedings pending before third country courts...|$|R

40|$|This thesis focuses {{primarily}} {{on the field of}} European cross-border insolvency law, currently represented by the EU Regulation on Insolvency Proceedings (EC No 1346 / 2000). The EU Regulation considered theoretical conflict between advocates of universalism and territorialism, and is generally regarded as reflecting it in a way of modification, which is represented by distinction between main and ancillary insolvency proceedings. Determination of international jurisdiction in the <b>main</b> insolvency <b>proceedings</b> is inherently linked with the criteria of the centre of main interests (COMI), which serves as a specific connecting factor to constitute both the court with jurisdiction and applicable law, for the purpose of the whole insolvency process in accordance with the principle lex fori concursus. The COMI concept is the root of the jurisdiction trouble, thus this thesis aims at providing substantial information on the concept, since the EU Regulation neglects its proper introduction. One of many issues related to COMI conception is a phenomenon of forum shopping, term used to describe situations when debtors manipulate with facts relevant for establishing jurisdiction, in order to obtain more favourable position, usually at creditors' expense.

The subject of interest is therefore the EC Regulation No. 1346 / 2000 on insolvency proceedings (the "insolvency regulation"). The aim of this thesis is (1) to summarise development of interpretation of the most important terms concerning the court's jurisdiction to open the <b>main</b> insolvency <b>proceedings,</b> the secondary proceedings and proceedings which relate to the insolvency proceedings; and (2) to propose amendments to the insolvency regulation especially regarding the Report which will be prepared by the Commission on application of the insolvency regulation no later than the 1 June 2012.

The first chapter present the historical excursus of the Czech judicature evolution. It presents difference between civil and criminal law. The second chapter discuss a legal remedy system and is mainly focusing to define terms such as appeal, cassation and revision.

50|$|The {{referring}} Court, inter alia, {{asked whether}} the prohibition of any discrimination based on age in employment and occupation must be interpreted as meaning that it precluded national legislation such as that in the <b>main</b> <b>proceedings,</b> pursuant to which compulsory retirement clauses contained in collective agreements were regarded as lawful, where such clauses provided as sole requirements that workers must have reached retirement age, set at 65 years by the national legislation, and must fulfil the other social security conditions for entitlement to draw a contributory retirement pension.|$|E

Since Article 31 is about provisional measures, a court may issue a cross-border injunction where an action aims for such measures. The ruling on case C-539/03 allows for a court to issue cross-border injunctions as provisional measures where companies domiciled in different Contracting States infringe in the same Contracting State.|$|E
40|$|The paper {{analyses}} the admissibility of {{the right}} to counsel of the accused in the English criminal trial, and focuses on the pre-trial stage and the <b>main</b> criminal <b>proceedings</b> in the 13 th and 14 th centuries. Although the pre-trial proceedings had not been formalised until the mid 16 th century, there are still some data available on which an opinion may be based. The author’s focus of attention is the main criminal proceeding and the admissibility {{of the right}} to counsel at that stage, for which the sources of information seem more reliable. As can be deduced, the right to counsel depended on the form in which the criminal proceeding commenced and the weight, or gravity of the crime. In most serious cases the right to counsel was restricted. However, it was probably not until the Tudor period when the rule against defence counsel considerably toughened. This is further evidenced by instances occurring between 1300 and 1500 in which legal aid was extended in cases tried on indictment. An exception were matters initiated by private accusation, so called appeal of felony, and offences of lesser gravity, called misdemeanours. Legal issues that emerged during a criminal trial were also capable of justifying the right to counsel...|$|R

40|$|In this study, we {{investigate}} thermospheric neutral mass density heating associated with 168 CME-driven geomagnetic storms {{in the period}} of May 2001 to September 2011. We use neutral density measured by two low-Earth orbit satellites: CHAMP and GRACE. For each storm, we superpose geomagnetic and density data for the time when the IMF B_z component turns sharply southward chosen as the zero epoch time. This indicates the storm main phase onset. We find that the average SYM-H index reaches the minimum of - 42 nT near 12 hours after storm main phase onset. The Joule heating is enhanced by approximately 200 % in comparison to quiet values. In respect to thermosphere density, on average, high latitude regions (auroral zones and polar caps) of both hemispheres are highly heated in the first 1. 5 hour of the storm. The equatorial response is presumably associated with direct equator-ward propagation of TADs (traveling atmospheric disturbances). A slight north-south asymmetry in thermosphere heating is found and is most likely due to a positive B_y component in the first hours of the storm <b>main</b> phase.

40|$|The present {{overview}} of judicial {{decisions in the}} Netherlands concerning the current European Insolvency Regulation (EIR) (No. 1346 / 2000) during the 13 years of its applicability indicates that jurisdiction has been the dominant issue in the Dutch Courts. Emphasizing the (relative) autonomy of a separate legal entity and referring to the more specific criteria of being ascertainable by third parties - as formulated by the Court of Justice in e. g. the Eurofood case - the Dutch Courts have fairly strictly presumed that {{the place of a}} company’s registered office determines the Centre of its Main Interests (COMI). With regard to determining jurisdiction to open insolvency proceedings against natural persons who are still involved, in any way, in economic activities in the Netherlands, the Supreme Court of the Netherlands has ruled in a leading case that the place of the business interests prevails over a ‘habitual residence’ abroad, certainly if the latter is not absolutely clear. In the case of Seagon/Deko the Court of Justice clarified jurisdiction concerning insolvency-related issues and in the period before this preliminary decision the Dutch Courts could derive their jurisdiction from a provision of national procedural law. The few Court decisions on the applicable law in cross-border insolvency cases were particularly focussed on the voidness, voidability or unenforceability of legal acts detrimental to all the creditors and the derogation of the lex concursus by the lex causae (Art. 4 sub. 2 m and Art. 13 EIR) {{as well as on the}} effects of insolvency proceedings on a pending lawsuit (Art. 15 EIR). The question is whether the upcoming Recast of the European Insolvency Regulation (No. 2015 / 848) will require a change in Dutch judicial practice. The Recast puts strong emphasis on reorganisation proceedings. Where the wording of the scope of the Recast is somewhat diffuse, the exhaustive list of proceedings covered by the Recast (listed in Annex A) will become a relevant indication of the scope. The Dutch insolvency proceedings to be governed by the Recast are the same as those covered by the current Insolvency Regulation. According to the wording in the Recitals, the basis for jurisdiction to open <b>main</b> insolvency <b>proceedings</b> against companies and legal persons appears to be more ambiguous than in the current Insolvency Regulation. However, like the current Insolvency Regulation, the relevant article in the Recast presumes that the ‘registered office’ is the basis for presuming jurisdiction with regard to legal persons. This would seem to offer sufficient room for interpretation to continue the ‘third party’ approach often adopted in Dutch judicial practice, with its emphasis on a reference for the determination of a debtor’s COMI that is objectively ascertainable by third parties...|$|R
40|$|The European Union Insolvency Regulation (the EU Regulation) is a {{giant step}} forward in {{promoting}} international cooperation among EU countries for cross-border insolvency proceedings. It adopts a modified universalist solution to cross-border proceedings insofar as they are located within the EU. However, experience has shown that it needs improvement to work effectively. A venue battle now rages between courts of several European countries over which country 2 ̆ 7 s courts will administer particular cross-border proceedings and how the center of main interest is to be determined for this purpose. This Article begins with a detailed examination of the two principal cases where conflicts have arisen, Eurofood and Daisytek. Eurofood is a subsidiary of Parmalat, which has produced the largest invsolvency case in European history. The Irish and Italian courts have both opened <b>main</b> insolvency <b>proceedings</b> for the Eurofood subsidiary, and the controversy is now pending before the European Court of Justice (ECJ). For the Daisytek French subsidiary, both English and French courts have opened main insolvency cases, and an appeal is pending before the French Cour de Cassation, where the Ministry of Justice is expected to recommend submission to the ECJ. Two very important substantive modifications would vastly improve the EU Regulation. First. the EU Regulation needs {{to provide for the}} filing in the same country (thereby permitting the filing in the same court) of members of a corporate group that are economically integrated. It is very difficult (if at all possible) to recognize a corporate empire when its insolvency proceedings are distributed among a number of countries. Second, the EU Regulation needs to clarify the definition of 2 ̆ 2 center of main interest 2 ̆ 2 (CoMI) and to specify what a court should consider in making the CoMI decision. A court should weigh the following factors: (1) the location of operations and management decisions for the corporation; (2) the location of the 2 ̆ 2 nerve center 2 ̆ 2 or place of principal decision-making for the corporation; and (3) the expectations of creditors, such as suppliers and financiers, as to the CoMI decision in the event that the company foes into an insolvency proceeding. This Article also argues for three kinds of procedural improvements: (1) decoupling the decision on whether a proceeding is a main proceeding from the decision opening the proceeding itself, to give an opportunity to the parties in interest to be heard on the subject of whether a proceeding is a main proceeding; (2) defining what constitutes a 2 ̆ 2 judgment opening insolvency proceedings, 2 ̆ 2 to specify what steps qualify under this term in those countries where an opening order or judgment is not a typical part of the insolvency process; (3) adopting procedures to recognize the due process rights of foreign estate administrators, foreign creditors, and other parties in interest in a cross-border insolvency proceeding...|$|R
