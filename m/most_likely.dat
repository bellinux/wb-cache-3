5|$|The life {{habits of}} Ypresiomyrma {{would have been}} {{similar to that of}} extant Myrmeciinae ants. Colonies nested in the soil or in trees, making them an {{arboreal}} nesting species. Workers were <b>most</b> <b>likely</b> solitary foragers, foraging on the ground or onto low vegetation and trees while preying on arthropods or consuming nectar. Workers <b>most</b> <b>likely</b> did not recruit or lead nestmates to food sources, nor did workers lay down pheromone trails. Ypresiomyrma ants <b>most</b> <b>likely</b> used their large eyes to find prey and for navigational purposes.|$|E

5|$|Archibald {{and colleagues}} {{suggested}} the life habits of Macabeemyrma ovata {{may have been}} similar to extant Myrmeciinae ants. The ant is large with long legs and elongated mandibles. It presumably had large eyes {{that were used to}} hunt for prey and navigation, and the ant was possibly equipped with a sting. Colonies <b>most</b> <b>likely</b> nested in the soil like most other Myrmeciinae, but like some Myrmecia species it is possible they were an arboreal nesting species. Workers were solitary foragers, foraging on the ground or onto vegetation while preying on arthropods. Workers <b>most</b> <b>likely</b> did not recruit other ants to food sources or lay down pheromone trails.|$|E

5|$|Around 1498, Josquin <b>most</b> <b>likely</b> re-entered {{the service}} of the Sforza family, on the {{evidence}} of a pair of letters between the Gonzaga and Sforza families. He probably did not stay in Milan long, for in 1499 Louis XII captured Milan in his invasion of northern Italy and imprisoned Josquin's former employers. Around this time Josquin <b>most</b> <b>likely</b> returned to France, although documented details of his career {{around the turn of the}} 16th century are lacking. Prior to departing Italy he <b>most</b> <b>likely</b> wrote one of his most famous secular compositions, the frottola El grillo (the Cricket), as well as In te Domine speravi ("I have placed my hope in you, Lord"), based on Psalm 30. The latter composition may have been a veiled reference to the religious reformer Girolamo Savonarola, who had been burned at the stake in Florence in 1498, and for whom Josquin seems to have had a special reverence; the text was the Dominican friar's favorite psalm, a meditation on which he left incomplete in prison prior to his execution.|$|E
5|$|Feynman's {{salary was}} $380 a month, about half {{what he needed}} to cover his modest living {{expenses}} and Arline's medical bills. The rest came from her $3,300 in savings. On weekends, Feynman drove to Albuquerque to see his ailing wife in a car borrowed from his good friend Klaus Fuchs. Asked who at Los Alamos was <b>most</b> <b>likely</b> to be a spy, Fuchs speculated that Feynman, with his safe cracking and frequent trips to Albuquerque, was the <b>most</b> <b>likely</b> candidate. When Fuchs confessed to being a spy for the Soviet Union in 1950, this would be seen in a different light. The FBI would compile a bulky file on Feynman.|$|E

Phillips 1 discusses extensions of the EMSR heuristic.|$|R
