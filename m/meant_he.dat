5|$|Giovinazzi's {{victories}} <b>meant</b> <b>he</b> {{became the}} first driver since Davide Valsecchi in 2012 to win both races in a GP2 Series race weekend. The race results meant Artem Markelov took over the Drivers' Championship lead with 54 points, while previous leader Norman Nato dropped to second following poor results. Giovinazzi's victory <b>meant</b> <b>he</b> moved to third place, one point ahead of Gasly. Russian Time remained {{the leaders of the}} Teams' Championship on 97 points, eight ahead of second-placed Prema Racing. Racing Engineering were in third position on 73 points, with seven rounds left in the season.|$|E
5|$|Bird's feature race {{victory was}} his—and Russian Time's—second {{of the season}} and Coletti's sprint race win <b>meant</b> <b>he</b> became the first Monegasque driver to win on the streets of Monaco since Louis Chiron in 1931. The race results {{resulted}} in Coletti increasing his lead {{at the top of the}} Drivers' Championship to 24 points ahead of Felipe Nasr. Bird's feature race win <b>meant</b> <b>he</b> gained two positions to move into third while Leimer dropped to fourth. Rapax took over the lead of the Teams' Championship from Carlin and Russian Time's strong results enabled the company to take over third place. Racing Engineering rounded out the top four with seven rounds left in the season.|$|E
5|$|In 1922 {{after playing}} only 5 league matches {{for the season}} his career at Port Adelaide finally {{came to an end}} due to {{commitments}} to his farm at Berri and disputes regarding game compensation. His contract termination <b>meant</b> <b>he</b> was paid ₤76 of ₤100 pounds for the season.|$|E
5000|$|Puddles - A small {{accident}} whilst laughing on day 1 <b>meant</b> <b>he's</b> labelled forever.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>meant</b> by {{this that}} he did not {{understand}} what Rollo said; but Rollo thought <b>he</b> <b>meant</b> that <b>he</b> could not find any one to play with him.|$|R
60|$|She {{raised her}} eyes, and saw how far entirely <b>he</b> <b>meant</b> what <b>he</b> said.|$|R
5|$|On 6 June 2015, Evra {{started for}} Juventus in the 2015 UEFA Champions League final as Juventus were {{defeated}} 3–1 by Barcelona at Berlin's Olympiastadion. The match {{was the fifth}} Champions League final {{in which he had}} appeared, and the defeat <b>meant</b> <b>he</b> became the first player to lose four Champions League finals.|$|E
5|$|Schumacher's extra pace as {{a result}} of his lighter fuel loads <b>meant</b> <b>he</b> was able to pull out enough of a gap to Häkkinen which enabled him to make an extra pit stop. Häkkinen's pace was very slow, {{allowing}} Nicola Larini to leapfrog him when the two-stoppers made their final pit stops.|$|E
5|$|The {{result of}} the round meant Vandoorne {{increased}} his advantage in the Drivers' Championship on 114 points. Rossi's strong results <b>meant</b> <b>he</b> moved into second place, 40 points behind Vandoorne, while Haryanto's poor form <b>meant</b> <b>he</b> fell to third.

60|$|Buck {{reaches in}} his pocket and hands me a key. I knew what <b>he</b> <b>meant</b> before <b>he</b> spoke. Confounded old buccaneer--I knew what <b>he</b> <b>meant.</b> They don't make them any better than Buck.|$|R
60|$|Sam {{knew exactly}} what <b>he</b> <b>meant,</b> but <b>he</b> kept on a look of earnest and desperate simplicity.|$|R
60|$|And {{the look}} {{he gave her}} out of his honest eyes showed that <b>he</b> <b>meant</b> what <b>he</b> said.|$|R
5|$|The {{victory in}} the Stakes, when {{combined}} with Secretariat's previous victories in the Kentucky Derby and the Preakness Stakes, <b>meant</b> <b>he</b> completed the Triple Crown of Thoroughbred Racing. This was significant as he was the ninth horse to complete the feat and broke a 25-year drought where a horse failed to complete the achievement.|$|E
5|$|William Shatner as James T. Kirk. Shatner practiced {{aerobics}} {{and strength}} training daily {{to prepare for}} the role. The physical activity and directing duties <b>meant</b> <b>he</b> woke at 4a.m. every day during filming, no matter what time he fell asleep.|$|E
5|$|As a {{consequence}} of the race, Coulthard's second place narrowed the gap to Michael Schumacher in the Drivers' Championship to six points, while Häkkinen's win <b>meant</b> <b>he</b> closed to within two points of Coulthard.

5000|$|Trio - Will, Won't and Joplin - [...] "Now, {{what you}} think that <b>he</b> <b>meant</b> when <b>he</b> said, 'Tut-tut!'" ...|$|R
60|$|I did not reply. I {{saw that}} <b>he</b> <b>meant</b> what <b>he</b> said, and I was {{busy trying to}} think how to defend myself.|$|R
60|$|It was a {{question}} of mental equipment that was on the carpet, and I am still wondering whether <b>he</b> <b>meant</b> what <b>he</b> said.|$|R
5|$|Despite {{the four}} {{consecutive}} first-round losses—which had {{been attributed to}} the split from his wife—Murphy claimed his third ranking title at the UK Championship, defeating Fu 10–9 in a low-quality final, in which he fluked a pink in the deciding frame that was effectively match ball. The victory <b>meant</b> <b>he</b> joined Davis, Alex Higgins, Griffiths, John Parrott, Hendry, O'Sullivan, Williams, John Higgins and Ebdon as the tenth player to have won both the World title and the UK title, cementing his place {{as one of the}} elite top players in the world.|$|E
5|$|He {{was part}} of the England squad that reached fourth place in the 1990 FIFA World Cup, where he famously cried after {{receiving}} a yellow card in the semi-final with West Germany, which <b>meant</b> <b>he</b> would have been suspended for the final itself had England won the game. He also helped the team to the semi-finals of UEFA Euro 1996, scoring a goal against Scotland which was described {{as one of the best}} of the tournament.|$|E
5|$|His mother, Elizabeth Barrow, and {{her three}} {{youngest}} children joined {{her husband in the}} Marshalsea in April 1824. Dickens would visit them every Sunday until he found lodgings in Lant Street, closer to the prison, in the attic of a house belonging to the vestry clerk of St George's Church. This <b>meant</b> <b>he</b> was able to breakfast with his family in the Marshalsea and dine with them after work.|$|E
60|$|Mrs Bones knew, by some {{peculiarity}} in {{the tone}} of her husband's voice, that <b>he</b> <b>meant</b> what <b>he</b> said, and was also satisfied.|$|R
6000|$|... "Thank you; I'll {{not forget}} your kindness," [...] {{returned}} Jasper Grinder, {{and for once}} it must be admitted that <b>he</b> <b>meant</b> what <b>he</b> said.|$|R
50|$|Wilson {{was said}} by his peers to be {{forceful}} and unconventional:Directness was his very nature; {{he said what}} <b>he</b> <b>meant</b> and <b>he</b> <b>meant</b> what <b>he</b> said to anyone without fear or favour. With this moral courage went unconscionable physical bravery as revealed by his antics on war service in France where he took to night-time excursions in no-man's land to relieve boredom in front-line trenches, and also, more recently, by his car driving which could be quite fearful for passengers.|$|R
5|$|In 1862 he was {{appointed}} abbot of the Surb Karapet Monastery near Mush, which <b>meant</b> <b>he</b> was also the prelate of Taron. He revitalized the monastery and transformed it into a flourishing center. He founded a school there and a journal, called Artsvik Tarono. He succeeded in convincing the wali (governor) of the Erzurum Vilayet to lower taxes for Armenians.|$|E
5|$|In August 2015, Darabont {{requested}} to amend his original complaint that AMC further reduced his profits from Season 2 as his firing mid-season <b>meant</b> <b>he</b> was not fully vested in the season, allowing AMC {{to reduce the}} profits paid him. Darabont's amended request points {{out that he had}} written and produced all the episodes in that season already and was entitled to the proper profit share. The judge granted this amendment in February 2016, partially influenced by concerns raised in Darabont's deposition.|$|E
5|$|Many vocalists were {{considered}} to perform on the album; Matheos and Portnoy briefly considered having a different vocalist perform on each track. Daniel Gildenlöw of Pain of Salvation wrote some vocal melodies and lyrics, but Moore ultimately performed most of the vocals and wrote most of the lyrics. Steven Wilson of Porcupine Tree wrote lyrics and performed vocals on one track. Cynic and Gordian Knot bassist Sean Malone performed bass, but was credited as a guest musician because his schedule <b>meant</b> <b>he</b> was unable to join Matheos, Moore and Portnoy for the basic tracking sessions.|$|E
6000|$|... "We can't {{do without}} you," [...] said the acting first lieutenant. And as he shook hands his honest face showed that <b>he</b> <b>meant</b> what <b>he</b> said.|$|R
6000|$|<b>He</b> <b>meant</b> that <b>he</b> {{would rather}} be a tall man in her company than in any other, and {{possibly}} she knew this, though all she answered was-- ...|$|R
60|$|She knew <b>he</b> <b>meant</b> that <b>he</b> {{would tell}} no more, {{and would have}} thought no more about it, but that she saw her mother was very uneasy.|$|R
5|$|Morris struck 109 against Middlesex in the {{following}} tour match at Lord’s.The hosts batted first and made 203, and Australia stumbled to 3/53 before Morris combined with Sam Loxton (123) for a 172-run fourth-wicket stand. Australia recovered to reach 317 {{and went on to}} a ten-wicket win. Morris's century <b>meant</b> <b>he</b> had amassed 504 runs in just over a week of cricket.|$|E
5|$|Nevertheless, by March 2007, Johnson {{was already}} eyeing {{a return to}} the game and began {{training}} with Burton Albion; however, issues regarding his departure from Nottingham Forest <b>meant</b> <b>he</b> could not sign for Burton, and on 21 March 2007, he signed instead for Conference North club Hucknall Town. In the summer of 2007, he was forced to quit all football due to injury. Since retiring, Johnson has worked as a scout for Chelsea.|$|E
5|$|Pugh scored {{his first}} Premier League goal in Bournemouth's 4–3 away win over West Ham United on 22 August 2015, with a curling shot past Darren Randolph in the 66th minute. This goal <b>meant</b> <b>he</b> had scored {{in each of}} the top five {{divisions}} of the English football league system. In November 2015, Pugh signed a new two-and-a-half-year contract with Bournemouth, tying him to the club until the summer of 2018.|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't know yet. But I {{am going}} to get it somehow," [...] replied Dave, and his tone of voice showed that <b>he</b> <b>meant</b> what <b>he</b> said.|$|R
6000|$|... "Never mind, when I go in {{for myself}} {{you are going to}} have an interest," [...] replied Andy, and his tone showed that <b>he</b> <b>meant</b> what <b>he</b> said.|$|R
6000|$|... "If I {{find any}} of the men down here I'll flog them," [...] was the captain's savage comment; and {{it was easy to}} see that <b>he</b> <b>meant</b> what <b>he</b> said.|$|R
