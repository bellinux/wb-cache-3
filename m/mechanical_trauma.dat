5|$|Vertebral artery {{dissection}} {{is one of}} the {{two types}} of dissection of the arteries in the neck. The other type, carotid artery dissection, involves the carotid arteries. Vertebral artery dissection is further classified as being either traumatic (caused by <b>mechanical</b> <b>trauma</b> to the neck) or spontaneous, and it may also be classified by the part of the artery involved: extracranial (the part outside the skull) and intracranial (the part inside the skull).|$|E
25|$|External {{factors may}} involve <b>mechanical</b> <b>trauma</b> (physical {{damage to the}} body which causes {{cellular}} breakdown), damage to blood vessels (which may disrupt blood supply to associated tissue), and ischemia.

Incomplete curing of the acrylic resin (the prosthetic material) may also be an involved factor.|$|E
40|$|AIM: To {{investigate}} the clinical characteristics, {{diagnosis and treatment}} results of <b>mechanical</b> ocular <b>trauma.</b> METHODS: In recent 4 years, clinical details of 122 cases(122 eyes) with <b>mechanical</b> ocular <b>trauma</b> in our hospital were analyzed retrospectively. RESULTS: In the 122 cases of <b>mechanical</b> ocular <b>trauma,</b> open ocular trauma was in 116 eyes(95. 1 %), blunt ocular trauma in 6 eyes(4. 9 %), The ratio of male to female was 6. 18 : 1, <b>mechanical</b> ocular <b>trauma</b> was mostly composed of open contusion which was mainly caused by foreign object. Most of patients had a significant visual improvement {{at the time of}} discharge. CONCLUSION:The work and production accidents were major causes of <b>mechanical</b> ocular <b>trauma.</b> The condition of its was complex, with multiple complications and serious consequences, we should strengthen the prevention. To develop and promote timely hospital, Department of Ophthalmology microscopic operation technology and vitreosity operation can save the injured eyesight.

40|$|AIM: To {{provide the}} basis of {{security}} guidance and decreasing the incidence through a general investigation of the <b>mechanical</b> ocular <b>trauma</b> among all the common causes, occasions where getting hurt {{as well as the}} characteristics of the high-risk group, and by further analysis and monitoring of the clinical cases and follow-up visit, study the related key factors of influencing the prognosis statistically. METHODS: The data of the 159 cases with <b>mechanical</b> ocular <b>trauma</b> were recorded. RESULTS: We obtained the 159 subjects' ages, genders as well as <b>mechanical</b> ocular <b>trauma</b> characteristic data, such as ocular distributions, the seasons of the injuries occurring, the causes and the occasions of the injuries, the high-risks group and so on. The factors affecting the visual prognosis,univariate analysis showed that the difference between urban and rural areas was a related influencing factor while the consulting hours and the ages of the patients were irrelevant. In the multivariate Logistic regression model of complications that affected the visual prognosis, there were four main factors leading to poor eyesight: endophthalmitis, retinal detachment, luxation or subluxation of the lens, prolapse of vitreous. In the multivariate Logistic regression model of the visual prognosis of mechanical eye injury, there were three factors of concern that corresponded to poor eyesight: the ages less than 10, zonation Ⅲ, grade of injury more than 3. CONCLUSION: The epidemiologic features of the <b>mechanical</b> ocular <b>trauma</b> in our hospital correspond to the reports from other areas. Appropriate medical care can improve the visual prognosis. Factors such as zonation Ⅲ, ages less than 10, grade of injury more than 3, endophthalmitis with the eye injury, prolapse of vitreous, luxation or subluxation of the lens and so on, indicate poor visual prognosis...|$|R

40|$|The {{oral cavity}} is always exposed to {{variable}} chronic and persistent irritations {{because of its}} special anatomic location and its various functions, such as chewing. Therefore, many lesions, referred to as reactive or tumor-like lesions, occur in the mouth {{as a result of}} these chronic and persistent irritations. Chronic irritating factors of the oral cavity include microbial, chemical and pharmaceutical agents, <b>mechanical</b> <b>traumas,</b> and endocrinal and hormonal factors. Given the role of local irritating factors, such as calculus, dental plaque and local traumas in inducing these lesions, elimination of these factors and agents should be undertaken by dental practitioners to prevent incidence or recurrence of such lesions. In addition, treatment of these lesions is possible by dental practitioners in many cases.

25|$|The primary {{mechanism}} {{is likely to}} be high pulmonary vascular pressures with concurrent negative airway pressures, causing extreme stress across the pulmonary capillary membrane (the fragile membrane separating blood in the pulmonary capillaries from the air-filled alveoli) and consequent hemorrhage into the air spaces of the lung. Other contributing factors may include upper airway obstruction, increased blood viscosity, abnormalities of cardiac origin (small cross-sectional area of atrioventricular valves, stiff valves, slow left ventricular relaxation time, right tricuspid valve regurgitation), preferential distribution of blood flow to the dorsocaudal lung regions, <b>mechanical</b> <b>trauma,</b> lower airway obstruction, inflammation, abnormalities of blood coagulation, inhomogeneity of ventilation and locomotory trauma. EIPH begins in the dorso-caudal region of the lung and progresses in a cranioventral direction over time.|$|E
25|$|Eicosanoid {{biosynthesis}} {{begins when}} a cell is activated by <b>mechanical</b> <b>trauma,</b> ischemia, other physical perturbations, attack by pathogens, or stimuli made by nearby cells, tissues, or pathogens such as chemotactic factors, cytokines, growth factors, and even certain eicosanoids. The activated cells then mobilize enzymes, termed phospholipase A2's (PLA2s), capable of releasing ω-6 and ω-3 fatty acids from membrane storage. These fatty acids are bound in ester linkage to the SN2 position of membrane phospholipids; PLA2s act as esterases {{to release the}} fatty acid. There are several classes of PLA2s with type IV cytosolic PLA2s (cPLA2s) appearing {{to be responsible for}} releasing the fatty acids under many conditions of cell activation. The cPLA2s act specifically on phospholipids that contain AA, EPA or GPLA at their SN2 position. Interestingly, cPLA2 may also release the lysophospholipid that becomes platelet-activating factor.|$|E
25|$|Pseudohyperkalemia {{occurs when}} the {{measured}} potassium levels is falsely elevated. This condition is usually suspected when patient is clinically well without any ECG changes. <b>Mechanical</b> <b>trauma</b> during blood drawing can cause potassium leakage out of the red blood cells due to haemolysed blood sample. Since exercise can cause elevated potassium levels, repeated fist clenching can cause transient rise in potassium levels. Prolonged length of blood storage can also increase serum potassium levels. Hyperkalemia may only become apparent when a person's platelet concentration is more than 500,000/microL in a clotted blood sample (serum blood sample). Potassium leaks out of platelets after clotting has occurred. On the other hand, processing of heparinised, unclot blood does not cause falsely elevated potassium. In addition to that, high white cell count (greater than 120,000/microL) in patient with chronic lymphocytic leukemia increases red blood cells fragility, thus causing pseudohyperkalemia during blood processing. This problem can be avoided by processing serum samples, because formation of clot protect the cells from haemolysis during processing. A familial form of pseudohyperkalemia may also be present, and is characterized by increased serum potassium in whole blood stored at or below room temperature, without additional hematological abnormalities. This is due to increased potassium permeability in red blood cells.|$|E
40|$|AIM: To {{investigate}} {{the situation of}} patients with <b>mechanical</b> ocular <b>trauma</b> and the possible influencing factors related to the prognosis. METHODS: Totally 260 patients(286 eyes) with <b>mechanical</b> ocular <b>trauma</b> from January 2011 to January 2016 in Xiaogan Central Hospital were selected and retrospective studied. Sociology and clinical data including gender, age, career, injury causes, injury nature, treatment time and visual acuity on admission in these patients were univariate analyzed, then the positive factors were analyzed using Logistic regression. RESULTS: The middle-aged and young males were domain in 260 patients. The causes were mainly sharp instrument injury, while perforating injury of eyeball was the majority in injury nature. Univariate analysis showed that injury causes, injury nature, treatment time and eyesight on admission were influencing factors, while multivariate analysis by Logistic regression showed that visual acuity on admission and orbital contusion were independent influencing factors for patients ocular trauma. CONCLUSION: Ocular trauma is a majoy cause of monocular blind, there are close associations between prognosis of ocular trauma and orbital contusion and visual acuity on admission. But the majority of ocular trauma is preventable and treatable, the relevant measures should be developed to prevent the ocular trauma...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Scar {{sarcoidosis}} is a {{rare and}} uncommon but specific cutaneous manifestation of sarcoidosis. In general it arises in pre-existing scars deriving from <b>mechanical</b> <b>traumas.</b> As most surgeons dealing with scars might {{not be aware of}} cutaneous sarcoidosis and its different types of appearance the appropriate staging and treatment might be missed or at least delayed. To our knowledge this is the first case in literature of scar sarcoidosis on a finger. Case presentation We present a case of a 33 -year-old carpenter who developed scar sarcoidosis on his right index finger 4 [*]years after the tendon of the long digital flexor got accidentally cut by an angle grinder. He was referred due to a swelling of the finger suspected to be a malignant soft tissue tumour. The circumference of the affected finger had almost doubled, adding up to 94 [*]mm. Incision biopsy revealed typical noncaseating granulomas. Further investigation showed a systemic extent of the disease with involvement of the lung. A systemic treatment with oral steroids led to an almost full regression of the swelling with restoration of function and resolution of lung infiltrates. Conclusion In case of a suspicious and/or progressive swelling a definite diagnosis should be achieved by biopsy within a short time to enable a proper treatment. If scar sarcoidosis is proven further investigation is necessary to exclude a systemical involvement. A surgical treatment of the swelling is not indicated. </p...|$|R
40|$|Background: Comparability of {{the quality}} of medical care for {{children}} in different types of in-patient hospitals remains a subject of debate. Objective: Our aim was to compare the quality of emergency hospital care for children with severe traumas in pediatric and non-pediatric in-patient hospitals. Methods : Retrospective cohort (continuous) research. We analyzed medical records of intensive care patients (form 003 /u) with severe traumas at the age of 1 month to 18 years hospitalized to in-patient hospitals of Rostov Oblast in  2010 – 2014. The quality of medical care was assessed according to duration of diagnostic maneuvers that led to the diagnosis and surgical activity (frequency of surgical interventions for the condition that led to hospitalization). Results : We analyzed the data on  134 children with severe <b>mechanical</b> <b>traumas</b> hospitalized to pediatric (n = 29) and non-pediatric (n = 105) in-patient hospitals. Lifethreatening traumas (Pediatric Trauma Score 8 points) were recorded in 26 (90 %) and 79 (75 %) children, respectively (p = 0. 127).  The duration of the diagnosis stage in two groups was 135 (120; 160) and 140 (110, 210) minutes, respectively (p = 0. 548). Surgical activity was higher in pediatric in-patient hospitals: surgical interventions were performed in 16 (55 %) children compared to 37 (35 %)  cases in the group of children admitted to non-pediatric hospitals (p = 0. 052).
