40|$|Humans have {{an innate}} {{tendency}} to compare their attitudes, abilities and behaviours {{with those of}} others {{in order to gain}} accurate self-evaluations. When comparisons are made with perceptibly superior others, ego-depletion and envy often follow, and when such comparisons are made in relation to physical appearance, the ramifications can be especially negative, particularly for women. Furthermore, appearance-based comparisons may be exceptionally negative and rampant on social networking sites, which tend to endorse perfectionist physical appearance, and may be further exacerbated by trait personality differences. This study investigated the interplay between public self-consciousness and target attractiveness on the experience of envy and the use of impression management techniques amongst women on Facebook. Female students (N = 103) completed trait <b>measures</b> <b>of</b> self-consciousness. Next, participants were presented with either an attractive or an unattractive female Facebook user, and were asked to imagine that this person was their friend on Facebook. Later, participants completed <b>measures</b> <b>of</b> envy, <b>derogation</b> and online impression management behaviours in response to five hypothetical Facebook updates provided by their female friend. It was found that women high in public selfconsciousness were less likely to engage in surveillance behaviours after viewing an attractive rather than an unattractive target. No other significant interactions were noted. However, given the drastic shift from traditional face-to-face communication towards online communication, the findings may provide crucial insight into envy and destructive behaviours as they are manifested online, and how these are influenced by individual differences in personality...|$|R
40|$|Studies {{testing the}} effects of self-affirmation on alcohol-related cognitions and {{behavior}} in university students have produced equivocal results. Because self-affirmation is a motivational technique (i. e., designed to reduce defensive processing) it {{may need to be}} supplemented with volitional techniques, such as forming if-then plans, to translate positive intentions into behavior. Participants (N = 348) were randomly assigned to conditions in a 2 (self-affirmation) × 2 (implementation intention) between-participants factorial design. Participants completed a self-affirmation task (i. e., values essay) or not, read a summary about the health risks of binge drinking (8 / 6 units for men/women), and then completed an implementation intention task (i. e., forming if-then plans) or not. Participants then completed <b>measures</b> <b>of</b> message <b>derogation,</b> perceived risk, and intention as well as alcohol consumption 1 week later. All main and interaction effects for self-affirmation were nonsignificant. In contrast, participants who formed implementation intentions (vs. not) reported drinking fewer units of alcohol and engaged in binge drinking less frequently at 1 -week follow-up. Additional analyses revealed that affirming a social value attenuated the effect of self-affirmation on intention, but augmented the effect of implementation intentions on behavior. Overall, the findings provide additional evidence for the positive effects of implementation intentions but question the use of self-affirmation to reduce alcohol consumption in university students...|$|R

40|$|Decentralising wage {{setting in}} times of crisis? The {{regulation}} and use <b>of</b> wage-related <b>derogation</b> clauses in seven European countries The author addresses the issue of wage setting decentralisation from the inter-sectoral to company level through the use <b>of</b> <b>derogation</b> clauses. Sectoral and inter-sectoral level collective agreements are a key feature of industrial relations in most Western European countries. Traditionally inter-sectoral bargaining has had the function of homogenising wages and working conditions for entire sectors or countries, of bringing stability to the relations between workers and employers and of relieving company level actors from engaging in time consuming and possibly conflict-ridden bargaining processes. In recent decades, however, the rationale for such inter-sectoral agreements has been questioned for an advancing globalisation of competition and for a greater requirement from employers of decentralisation and flexibility {{in the setting of}} wages and working conditions. A specific form of decentralisation is the opening up of possibilities for companies, through various kinds <b>of</b> <b>derogation</b> clauses (opening clauses, hardship clauses, opt-out clauses, inability-to-pay clauses, etc.), to deviate from pay norms set under inter-sectoral or sectoral agreements when they suffer from temporary economic hardship. The article provides a summary of the results of a comparative study on the regulations, practices and politics <b>of</b> wage <b>derogation</b> clauses in seven EU countries: Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy and Spain. It provides a detailed and original contribution to the political and academic debate on labour law and industrial relations...|$|R

40|$|Within the {{framework}} of the nitrate directive, member states have the possibility to apply for derogation, i. e. increasing fertilization standards under certain conditions. Several EU regions have made use of this possibility but all in a different way. In 2009, 6 different derogation policies were worked out. This paper focuses on the differences between the applied policies and makes an assessment of the impact of these differences on the application rate <b>of</b> <b>derogation,</b> the manure surplus and the costs to allocate the manure. Based on the MP-MAS model described by Van der Straeten et al. (2010) the different scenarios are applied on a single case area (Flanders) and the economic effects have been simulated. Results show large differences between the policy alternatives, leading to the conclusion that member states not only have to focus on the permission to allow derogation or not but also at the details <b>of</b> the <b>derogation</b> policy. Granting derogation at parcel level instead of farm level increases the potential effect <b>of</b> <b>derogation,</b> the height <b>of</b> the increase in fertilization standards under derogation determines the application rate of derogation: a higher increase leads to a higher application rate.

40|$|The {{application}} of Art. 87 (1) EC to taxes above all {{is connected to}} the application <b>of</b> the <b>derogation</b> method, which appears {{to be part of the}} selectivity criterion. This dissertation examines the application <b>of</b> the <b>derogation</b> method and the assessment of the selectivity criterion applied to taxes, primarily de lege lata, but also de lege ferenda. It begins with an analysis of the relationship among the criteria of Article 87 (1) EC and continues with an analysis of the relationship between the derogation method and the assessment of the selectivity criterion applied to taxes. Several scholars have criticised the application <b>of</b> the <b>derogation</b> method because <b>of</b> the difficulty <b>of</b> identifying a <b>derogation</b> and <b>of</b> establishing the benchmark against which the derogation should be assessed. In this dissertation both the benchmark and the establishment <b>of</b> a <b>derogation</b> is analysed, partly with reference to the tax expenditure debate that occurred in the subject area of international taxation during the 1970 s and 1980 s. The selectivity criterion applied to taxes contains an assessment of justification, whereby the selective nature <b>of</b> a <b>measure</b> can be justified on the basis of the nature or general scheme of the system: Therfore the meaning and implications of this assessment are also examined. After all these issues have been examined de lege lata, the extents to which the application <b>of</b> the <b>derogation</b> method and the assessment of the selectivity criterion follow a logical system are discussed and recommendations for eliminating the identified deficiences are put forward...|$|R

30|$|However, {{it can be}} {{inferred}} from the purpose <b>of</b> <b>derogation</b> clauses {{that at least some}} economic, social and cultural rights are non-derogable. According to Müller, this would extend to subsistence rights (Müller 2009, 593). The purpose <b>of</b> <b>derogations</b> is not to allow states to decrease their attention to the rights, but (following the criteria of Article 4 ICCPR) must be to ensure that the state is in a position where it is capable of ensuring human rights and to restore a situation of normalcy (United Nations Human Rights Committee 2001, para 1). This is evident from the requirement that a state be in a “time of public emergency that threatens the life of the nation” before it may make derogations. Whilst it may be true that a non-international armed conflict may cause such a situation of public emergency, it cannot reasonably be expected that derogating from rights such as the right to food, water and healthcare, could help to restore the state to a situation of normalcy. On the contrary, reducing access to essential resources would aggravate, rather than ameliorate, a situation of public emergency.|$|R

In this sense, legal tools are used to solve technical problems so that an appreciable number <b>of</b> <b>derogations</b> (exceptions) are introduced.

However, <b>derogations</b> should be avoided in legislation where harmonization is pursued, since they bring about distortion in the marketing of organic products.

Overall, men significantly decreased their evaluations of the derogator’s friendliness, kindness, trustworthiness and overall desirability as a mate. Women mirrored these results, but also significantly decreased their views of the derogator’s fitness as a parent and her physical attractiveness, and in the case <b>of</b> appearance <b>derogations,</b> her promiscuity.

40|$|The Third Package allows EU energy islands to be {{exempted}} from most {{if not all}} of the acquis communautaire in energy, both on market design and the regulatory framework. However, even if a supply monopoly is the most efficient market structure in a given situation, this monopoly in theory still needs to be regulated. Therefore, has the EU struck the right balance in this area? This paper first disentangles the complex system <b>of</b> <b>derogations</b> open to EU energy islands. It focuses inter alia on the unbundling regime {{and what it means to}} have an express derogation from Article 9 (ownership unbundling). The second part looks at the opening of the Cyprus gas market and the concrete effects <b>of</b> the <b>derogation</b> system on the powers of the Cyprus Energy Regulatory Authority, the national regulator, in monitoring this market. Cyprus is considered to be both an isolated (Article 49 (1) of Directive 2009 / 73) and an emergent (Article 49 (2) of Directive 2009 / 73) market under the new legislation and, as such, is an interesting case. The paper argues that, beyond the complexity <b>of</b> the <b>derogation</b> regime applying to energy islands, the scope <b>of</b> possible <b>derogations</b> from the Third Energy Package seems to be exceedingly wide. The Package allows for full vertical reintegration and a loss in regulatory independence and powers which does not seem justified. The Third Energy Package’s derogation system for energy islands should, strictly, be used to ensure the viability and attractiveness of the investments and, in particular, should not reduce the role, power and responsibilities of the national regulatory authority, especially on the issues of security of supply, transparency and consumer protection through the proper regulation of tariffs, bearing in mind that the market will be monopolistic...|$|R
