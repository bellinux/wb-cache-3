Methodology: We use an archival microstudy of the <b>municipal</b> tramway <b>undertaking</b> of the English city of York, using municipal archives triangulated with local and industry media sources. Findings: We propose the refination of the Mees spectrum of public transport from public to private (2010, pp. 73 – 75) to note that public undertakings can be operated within a profit-maximizing framework.

Almost immediately after his arrival he was requested by both colonial and <b>municipal</b> authorities to <b>undertake</b> investigations into a diverse range of biological and geological subjects ranging from parasitic diseases affecting rabbits in the Wairarapa district and the life history of flounder to analyses of water quality in Auckland. In a discussion of Thomas' report on the rabbit control problem, Paul Star notes that while he 'did not find a satisfactory disease, ... the publication of his reports introduced many colonists to a scientific approach'. Thomas' lack of specialisation has led some New Zealand historians, such as Keith Sinclair, to assert that he was not a researcher of any significance. [...] Much of this argument is anachronistic and demonstrates a failure either to comprehend the aims, purpose and function of applied scientific research {{at the end of the}} nineteenth century or to understand the circumstances under which Thomas would have been able to research at the level he had become accustomed to in Europe.

50|$|The {{reservoirs}} {{were built}} {{as an essential}} part of Brisbane's second phase of water supply development. During the first self-service stage, the inhabitants relied mostly upon natural water courses, wells, tanks and water-carriers. The only public supply was the old convict dam and a hardwood pipeline in the Roma Street hollow (1838), supplemented by an elevated tank in Tank Street (1859). So inadequate and polluted was the water supply that this became a controversial issue as soon as the Brisbane Municipal Council was formed and Queensland's Separation gained in 1859. Despite strenuous debate amongst aldermen regarding the best solution, and continual conflict between council and parliament over control, the new water supply system from Enoggera Dam was constructed by the Brisbane Board of Waterworks and their engineer Joseph Brady in 1863-1866. This was the first reticulated gravity supply and the first <b>municipal</b> engineering <b>undertaking</b> in Queensland. Although Brisbane Mayor Thomas Blacket Stephens proposed a service reservoir on Windmill Hill (Wickham Terrace) as early as 1862, this was postponed for financial reasons until 1871, when the water pressure was already inadequate due to population expansion and increased consumption. Henry Holmes was the prominent building contractor. Further complaints led to the provision of the second, larger reservoir in 1882, particularly to service the high parts of South Brisbane and Kangaroo Point. Other improvements were made in the water supply system which coped with the population boom of the 1880s, including the building of the Gold Creek Dam in 1885-1886, and of the Highgate Hill service reservoir which was of mass concrete rather than arched brick walls in 1889. The commissioning of Mount Crosby pumping station in 1893 marked the decline of gravity water supply. The Spring Hill reservoirs were not used after the Gold Creek dam improved reticulation pressure from 1886 onwards, until a new policy of constructing service reservoirs to reduce the load on trunk mains was recommended in 1903. This resulted in reconditioning of the reservoirs in 1904-1905, including reconnection with the original Enoggera watermain, and the provision of roofs to prevent the growth of algae, a spray inlet, a floating outlet and a relief valve for the Mount Crosby supply. Other inground reservoirs were built on the hills of Brisbane and continue to serve the city today. The Spring Hill reservoirs remained {{an integral part of the}} Brisbane water supply system until 3 September 1962 when the watermain was shut down, unable to serve an increasingly highrise inner city due to their comparatively small capacity and low elevation. Redevelopment proposals during the 1980s included converting the area into an art gallery, restaurant, theatre in the round and bus exchange.|$|R
40|$|Across the United States, {{federal and}} state policy on surface water quality is {{actively}} expanding to require local governments to address non-point source pollution from stormwater runoff into impaired streams. Many local governments have recently initiated their local comprehensive stormwater programs {{in order to meet}} minimum measures of the National Pollution Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) stormwater program for Phase I and Phase II communities. Water quality regulations require local governments, at minimum, to act as good stewards of the environment as urban areas age, undergo repairs or revitalization, or add new development. While the adage of ―setting a good example‖ is simple in concept, local governments and communities struggle with the process of developing their own effective and comprehensive pollution prevention/good housekeeping program to address local water quality problems and meet watershed restoration objectives. As a Phase II NPDES (or MS 4) community, the City of Durham, North Carolina is responsible for complying with their state permit that allows the release of runoff into waterways from the City stormwater system. In order to foster a comprehensive and long-term commitment to preventing pollution by the City‘s municipal operations, the Stormwater Services Division (SSD) in Durham‘s Public Works Department identified the need to outreach to other city departments that <b>undertake</b> <b>municipal</b> maintenance activities. Through document and media review combined with email, phone or in-person interviews with stormwater professionals, this project first examines existing concerns, attitudes, approaches and resources available for local governments to utilize when self-evaluating their own municipal pollution prevention/good housekeeping practices.

This initial internal survey serves as a step in needs assessment, a documentation process whereby SSD staff can gather baseline information on current municipal maintenance activities and practices that stand to impact water quality.

Proceedings of the Second National Workshop on Strategic Issues in Indian Irrigation, New Delhi, India, 8 - 9 April 2009. Colombo, Sri Lanka: International Water Management Institute (IWMI). This paper {{attempts}} {{to identify and}} evolve a method for valuing and estimating the net gains from domestic and industrial water supply from the interbasin transfer schemes contemplated in the National River Link Project (NRLP). An existing interbasin transfer (IBT) scheme, namely Indira Gandhi Nahar Project (IGNP) and a proposed IBT scheme namely Polavaram- Vijaywada (PV) Link Canal were chosen for detailed analyses. Secondary data were used for identifying {{the region and the}} populations that benefited from the schemes. Economic gains arising out of water supply to the actual or potentially benefited areas were estimated. The estimation involved assessment of current costs incurred by the people in the area, in terms of both paid-out costs and time spent in fetching water. The saving in time was valued at market wage rates prevalent in the area and paid-out costs were assessed in terms of current market prices, ignoring the administered prices involved. The gains to urban populations were assessed by estimating the reduction in energy costs incurred by <b>municipal</b> authorities in <b>undertaking</b> the supply. Amortized capital costs for putting necessary hardware for distributing water from the IBT schemes as well as operation and maintenance (O&M) costs of running these schemes were netted from the gains to obtain the figures for net economic gains. More indirect benefits such as reduced drudgery or improved educational performance as well as reduced health expenditure were recognized but were all ignored to ensure greater robustness in the estimates. Only net gains to the society were considered and hence gains arising out of creation of industrial estates within the commands were ignored since similar gains could also be obtained by locating these estates elsewhere. The net economic gains are seen to depend on both demographic features of the region and its ecology. Desert-like conditions of the IGNP-benefited areas tend to make the gains from domestic water supply schemes large, while similar gains in the Polavaram-Vijaywada areas are smaller. The net economic gains are of a significant order and would seem to indicate that, at least insofar as the dry areas of the country are concerned, these can perhaps exceed the gains due to increased agricultural production and hence could perhaps justify the creation of the schemes by themselves...|$|R
