5|$|Following {{the release}} of It's a Feedelity Affair in 2006, Lindstrøm had become tired of {{producing}} dance remixes and average length vocal pieces. He began giving the artists and labels <b>mixes</b> <b>with</b> slower tempos. Lindstrøm also felt he was unwisely incorporating musical ideas into remixes instead of original works, which led to experiments with lengthier tracks for an original album. Four to five tracks were originally envisioned for Where You Go I Go Too, but only three were chosen.|$|E
5|$|Volcanic ash's {{primary use}} {{is that of}} a soil enricher. Once the {{minerals}} in ash are washed into the soil by rain or other natural processes, it <b>mixes</b> <b>with</b> the soil to create an andisol layer. This layer is highly rich in nutrients and is very good for agricultural use; the presence of lush forests on volcanic islands is often as a result of trees growing and flourishing in the phosphorus and nitrogen-rich andisol.|$|E

5|$|The bushcrow feeds both on {{the ground}} and in trees. It begins {{foraging}} at sunrise. While foraging, a bushcrow can be alone, in a pair, or in a group of six or seven other bushcrows. A foraging bushcrow digs vigorously in the soil while its beak is held slightly open to catch any insects it unearths. When it catches something, it carries it to the nearest tree or bush, pins it down with its foot, and kills and eats the prey. This species has also been seen using its beak to tear apart rotten wood and inspecting cattle dung in the search for food. It may also land on the backs of cattle to search for parasites. It can also chase flying insects, which it does on foot, abruptly changing direction and taking flying leaps after its prey. It often <b>mixes</b> <b>with</b> white-crowned starlings, red-billed hornbills, red-billed buffalo weavers, and superb starlings while foraging. When hunting in the trees, it is capable of walking atop horizontal branches and jumping upwards towards the crown, then descending in a glide from the crown to the ground.|$|E
5|$|The three {{subspecies}} {{also differ}} in their colour. A. m. angolensis has a brown to tawny coat, with thick, dark brown stripes on the face extending two-thirds down to the snout. While the lateral stripe is nearly black, the stripe on the rump is dark brown. The medium brown forehead patch extends to eye level and is separated from the bright white face by a dark brown border. A brown spot is seen on the nose. A. m. hofmeyri is a light fawn, with thin, dark brown face stripes. The stripes on the flanks are dark brown to black, and the posterior stripes are moderately brown. The forehead patch, dark brown or fawn, extends beyond {{the level of the}} eyes and <b>mixes</b> <b>with</b> the white of the face without any clear barriers. The nose may have a pale smudge. A. m. marsupialis is a rich chestnut brown, with thin, light face stripes. The stripe near the rump is well-marked, and that on the flanks is deep brown. The forehead is brown, fawn, or white, the patch not extending beyond the eyes and having no sharp boundaries. The nose is white or marked with brown.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThis study {{deals with}} the effect of {{salinity}} of groundwater on some properties of clayey soil. Properties obtained from tests carried out on samples <b>mixed</b> <b>with</b> water containing different salt contents are compared with those obtained from tests carried out on samples <b>mixed</b> <b>with</b> pure water (tap water). The tested samples {{were taken from the}} site of the Faculty of Engineering in Qena, South Valley University. Two sets of samples of the clay soil were tested. One was <b>mixed</b> <b>with</b> pure water (pure water clay soil) and the other was <b>mixed</b> <b>with</b> salty water added to it in ratios ranging from 20 % to 80 % (clay soil <b>mixed</b> <b>with</b> salt). The test results showed the effect of groundwater salinity on the tested samples. The plasticity index decreased from 26 for pure water clay soil to 24. 96 for clay soil <b>mixed</b> <b>with</b> 80 % salt. The coefficient of consolidation increased from 0. 00196 for pure water clay soil to 0. 002744 for clay soil <b>mixed</b> <b>with</b> 80 % salt. The California bearing ratio increased from 9. 75 % for pure water clay soil to 10. 15 % for clay soil <b>mixed</b> <b>with</b> 80 % salt. The optimum moisture content increased from 14. 25 % for pure water clay soil to 16. 5 % for clay soil <b>mixed</b> <b>with</b> 100 % salt. Decrease in the maximum dry density is observed for clay soil <b>mixed</b> <b>with</b> salty when compared with pure water clay soil. A marked decrease was noticed for the value of the unconfined compressive strength.

25|$|According to Tim Garrett, an {{assistant}} professor of meteorology at the University of Utah involved in the study of Arctic haze at the university, mid-latitude cities contribute pollution to the Arctic, and it <b>mixes</b> <b>with</b> thin clouds, allowing them to trap heat more easily. Garret's study found that during the dark Arctic winter, when there is no precipitation to wash out pollution, the effects are strongest, because pollutants can warm the environment up to three degrees Fahrenheit.|$|E
25|$|There are {{different}} methods of distributing the required components of combustion to a flame. In a diffusion flame, oxygen and fuel diffuse into each other; the flame occurs where they meet. In a premixed flame, the oxygen and fuel are premixed beforehand, {{which results in}} {{a different type of}} flame. Candle flames (a diffusion flame) operate through evaporation of the fuel which rises in a laminar flow of hot gas which then <b>mixes</b> <b>with</b> surrounding oxygen and combusts.|$|E

25|$|When {{blending}} <b>mixes</b> <b>with</b> pressures up {{to about}} , the Ideal gas law provides a reasonable approximation and simple equations {{can be used to}} calculate the pressures of each component gas needed to create the mix. At this pressure and normal temperatures, air departs from linearity by about 5%, e.g. a 10-litre cylinder filled to 230 bar with air only contains about 95% of the expected 2300 litres of free air. Above this pressure, the composition of the final mix is difficult to predict using simple equations but needs the more complex Van der Waals equation.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to the alimentary canal, insects also have paired salivary glands and salivary reservoirs. These structures usually reside in the thorax (adjacent to the fore-gut). The salivary glands (30) produce saliva; the salivary ducts lead from the glands to the reservoirs and then forward through the head to an opening called the salivarium behind the hypopharynx; which movements of the mouthparts help mix saliva with food in the buccal cavity. Saliva <b>mixes</b> <b>with</b> food, which travels through salivary tubes into the mouth, beginning the process of breaking it down.|$|E
25|$|In {{continental}} arcs, {{such as the}} Andes, magma often {{pools in}} the shallow crust creating magma chambers. Magmas in these reservoirs become evolved in composition (dacitic to rhyolitic) through both the process of fractional crystallization and partial melting of the surrounding country rock. Over time as crystallization continues and the system loses heat, these reservoirs cool. In order to remain active, magma chambers must have continued recharge of hot basaltic melt into the system. When this basaltic material <b>mixes</b> <b>with</b> the evolved rhyolitic magma, the composition is returned to andesite, its intermediate phase.|$|E
40|$|The {{strength}} of the cement-stabilized soil can be improved {{by the use of}} seawater. Compressive strength test results show that the {{strength of}} cement-stabilized soil <b>mixed</b> <b>with</b> seawater is 50 % greater than that <b>mixed</b> <b>with</b> freshwater at the 90 th day. However, the application is limited because the expansion of the cement-stabilized soil <b>mixed</b> <b>with</b> seawater increases significantly. A kind of ultrafine silica fume was added into the cement-stabilized soil to inhibit swelling of the cement-stabilized soil with seawater. The expansion of cement-stabilized soil <b>mixed</b> <b>with</b> seawater by adding ultrafine silica fume is close to that of cement-stabilized soil <b>mixed</b> <b>with</b> freshwater. With the addition of ultrafine silica fume, the unconfined compressive strength increases by close to 6. 5 % compared with seawater alone at the 90 th day. The mechanisms of adding ultrafine silica fume into the cement-stabilized soil <b>mixed</b> <b>with</b> seawater are revealed by several physical and chemical characterization parameters, such as specific gravity, unbound water content, surface morphology seen with SEM, and crystal products by X-ray diffraction tests.
