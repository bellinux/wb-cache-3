25|$|A {{major threat}} {{was already on}} the horizon, however, as the Rothesay Dock in Clydebank was under construction. It opened in 1907, {{equipped}} with modern <b>mechanical</b> <b>handling</b> equipment for bulk minerals; it was only 20miles (32km) from most of the coalfields, and sea-going ships could be loaded there. Much traffic was immediately diverted from Ardrossan, and use of the expensive new L route declined steeply.|$|E
50|$|A {{free-fall}} or gravity drop {{system uses}} gravity to deploy {{the landing gear}} into the down and locked position. To accomplish this the pilot activates a switch or <b>mechanical</b> <b>handle</b> in the cockpit, which releases the up-lock. Gravity then pulls the landing gear down and deploys it. Once in position the landing gear is mechanically locked and safe to use for landing.|$|R

25|$|Considerable {{investment}} {{was made in}} the GWR dock facilities at Swansea, especially in modern <b>mechanical</b> <b>handling</b> equipment and adaptation to the changing pattern of mineral exports. The numerous small-scale marshalling yards at the Burrows (the R section near Jersey Marine) were modernised, and the residual passenger service over this section was diverted to the GWR (former Swansea and Neath) line running parallel, so that the former R lines were dedicated to goods and mineral traffic. The diversion from Riverside freed up the approach of goods traffic at the docks, which had previously conflicted with passenger trains crossing.|$|E
25|$|The new Methil dock {{was entirely}} successful, and <b>mechanical</b> <b>handling</b> {{equipment}} and other modern aids ensured rapid loading of shipping. Nonetheless Wemyss {{did not wish}} to be a long term operator of harbour facilities, particularly because he foresaw that considerable development would be needed in later years to keep abreast of the expansion of trade. Discussions took place with the North British Railway in 1888 which resulted in the sale of the facilities to that company. This became effective on 1 February 1889 and included the Wemyss and Buckhaven line and the Methil extension, the Methil and Leven docks, and the railways serving them. Wemyss undertook never to construct or allow a railway or dock on his lands that would compete with the transferred lines and harbours. This was a most significant concession, as he was handing monopoly control to the NBR; at the time he had an excellent relationship with the Chairman of the NBR, John Walker, and this may have influenced him. The purchase cost £225,000; the Wemyss Castle station was to be maintained by the NBR for the private use of Wemyss, and Wemyss was given a seat on the NBR board.|$|E

50|$|Unlike many {{tactical}} jets {{which required}} ground service equipment, the S-3 {{was equipped with}} an auxiliary power unit (APU) and capable of unassisted starts. The aircraft's original APU could provide only minimal electric power and pressurized air for both aircraft cooling and for the engines' pneumatic starters. A newer, more powerful APU could provide full electrical service to the aircraft. The APU itself was started from a hydraulic accumulator by pulling a <b>mechanical</b> <b>handle</b> in the cockpit. The APU accumulator was fed from the primary hydraulic system, but could also be pumped up manually (with much effort) from the cockpit.|$|R

40|$|A novel {{semiconductor}} {{fabrication process}} has been developed at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory for millimeter and submillimeter-wave monolithic integrated circuits. The process integrates the active devices, Schottky diodes, with planar metallic transmission lines. To reduce the RF losses in the passive circuitry, the semiconductor substrate under the transmission lines is etched away, leaving the metal suspended in air and held only by its edges on a semiconductor frame. The frame also allows the circuit to be handled and mounted easily, and makes the whole structure more robust. Moreover, this technology allows for the diodes to be positioned precisely {{with respect to the}} circuitry and can be scaled for higher frequency applications. Metallic beam-leads are used extensively on the structure to provide <b>mechanical</b> <b>handles</b> as well as current paths for DC grounding and diode biasing. To demonstrate the utility of this technology, broadband balanced planar doublers based on the concepts in [1] have been designed in the 200 and 400 GHz range. Extensive simulations were performed to optimize the diodes and design the circuits around our existing device fabrication process. The 368 - 424 GHz circuits wer...|$|R
