40|$|Abstract—The {{most common}} {{forensic}} activity is searching a hard disk for string of data. Nowadays, investigators and analysts are increasingly experiencing large, even terabyte sized data sets when conducting digital investigations. Therefore consecutive searching can take weeks to complete successfully. There are two primary search methods: index-based search and bitwise search. Index-based searching is very fast {{after the initial}} indexing but initial indexing takes a long time. In this paper, we discuss a high speed bitwise search model for large-scale digital forensic investigations. We used pattern <b>matching</b> <b>board,</b> which is generally used for network security, to search for string and complex regular expressions. Our results indicate that in many cases, the use of pattern <b>matching</b> <b>board</b> can substantially increase the performance of digital forensic search tools.

50|$|On {{the next}} two <b>match</b> <b>boards,</b> Kazakhstan and Hungary drew in a winless match, while Azerbaijan-1 and Georgia {{exchanged}} one win each in another tie. Nana Dzagnidze scored a full point for Georgia Zeinab Mamedyarova as White on board one and Gulnar Mammadova beat Nino Batsiashvili as Black on board three. Thus, all four matches played on the top four <b>match</b> <b>boards</b> ended without winner. Poland were the team playing on the highest board who secured a match victory after beating Vietnam 3-1 in a match with four decisive games. Monika Soćko, Karina Szczepkowska-Horowska and Klaudia Kulon scored full points for Poland against Phạm Lê Thảo Nguyên, Nguyễn Thị Mai Hưng and Nguyễn Thị Thanh An; Hoàng Thị Bảo Trâm won against Jolanta Zawadzka to score the only point for Vietnam. Klaudia Kolun's win was sixth at the tournament, which {{put her in the}} lead with a perfect score. India minimally beat Latvia 2½-1½ thanks to the wins by Harika Dronavalli against Dana Reizniece-Ozola and Soumya Swaminathan against Ingūna Erneste.|$|R

50|$|The {{match of}} the day was played between the only teams with perfect scores, Russia and Ukraine, on the first <b>match</b> <b>board.</b> The Ukrainian players gained {{advantage}} on the first three boards, where Anna Muzychuk was playing versus Alexandra Kosteniuk as White, Mariya Muzychuk versus Valentina Gunina as Black and Natalia Zhukova versus Aleksandra Goryachkina as White. Nonetheless, Gunina found a miraculous resource and tricked her opponent in a position being a rook and three pawns down to survive with a perpetual check (see diagram); Zhukova also did not exploit her advantage and lost her extra pawn to a tactical oversight on move 27 that transposed the game into a drawn endgame. Yet, Anna Muzychuk succeeded to convert her advantage to a full point but Olga Girya was victorious for Russia against Anna Ushenina on the lowest board for a 2-2 tie, despite the fact she committed herself to a blunder and gave up a crucial pawn on move 40. On the second <b>match</b> <b>board,</b> Romania surprisingly halted the top-seeded China to draw thanks to the win by Corina Peptan over Ju Wenjun with the White pieces on board one. For the Chinese team, who lacked World Women's Champion Hou Yifan, the only win came from Guo Qi who beat Irina Bulmaga on board four.|$|R

50|$|The pairings in {{the fourth}} round {{resulted}} in interesting matches involving strong teams. Ukraine, Serbia, Russia and Kazakhstan remained the only teams with four match victories. Russia narrowly beat Hungary on the top <b>match</b> <b>board</b> with draws on the first three boards and a single win by Natalija Pogonina over Anita Gara. The game on the first board between Hoang Thanh Trang and Alexandra Kosteniuk may have directly affected the match outcome but the Russian closely escaped from an inferior position with a pawn down in the endgame. On the second <b>match</b> <b>board,</b> Ukraine faced France, who {{had arrived at the}} Chess Olympiad without their top two players Marie Sebag and Almira Skripchenko. The French team was additionally weakened for the match, because their highest rated player in the tournament Sophie Milliet was given a day off. Under these circumstances, the Ukrainian team snatched a convincing 3½-½ victory with wins by the Muzychuk sisters and Natalia Zhukova on the first three boards. Serbia and Kazakhstan started the tournament as 27th and 31st seeds, respectively but continued their perfect match score {{in the fourth}} round to join Ukraine and Russia on the top. Serbia's Jovana Rapport lost to Pia Cramling on board one but her teammates dominated on the other boards to give her team a 3-1 win against Sweden. Kazakhstan closely won the clash with Lithuania 2½-1½.|$|R
