500|$|Capitol Records {{executives}} {{were worried that}} the lyrics contained psychedelic overtones, and Brian was accused of having based the song's production on his LSD experiences. Brian clarified that the song was written {{under the influence of}} marijuana, not LSD. He explained: [...] "I made ‘Good Vibrations’ on drugs; I used drugs to make that. ... I learned how to function behind drugs, and it improved my brain ... it <b>made</b> <b>me</b> <b>more</b> rooted in my sanity." [...] In Steven Gaines's 1986 biography, Wilson is quoted on the lyrics: [...] "We talked about good vibrations with the song and the idea, and we decided on one hand that you could say ... those are sensual things. And then you'd say, 'I'm picking up good vibrations,' which is a contrast against the sensual, the extrasensory perception that we have. That's what we're really talking about." [...] Brian claimed in 2012 that the song's [...] "gotta keep those good vibrations" [...] bridge was inspired by Stephen Foster. Al Jardine of the Beach Boys compared the section to Foster's [...] "Down by the Riverside". According to Love, the lyric [...] "'she goes with me to a blossom world' was originally meant to be followed by the words 'we find'", but Brian elected to cut off the line to highlight the bass track linking into the chorus.|$|E
