40|$|This study {{advances}} identity theory, {{a prominent}} sociological social psychological theory, by investigating how the moral identity, moral behavior, and emotions operate in different social contexts, specifically when the moral identity is activated (or not activated) and when individuals are {{alone or in}} different types of groups. This extends identity theory by including key processes in social identity theory (identity activation <b>and</b> <b>group</b> <b>membership)</b> which have not been examined in the existing literature concerning the control systems approach to identity. A survey and experiment are administered to examine how the moral identity process operates for individuals in different social contexts. The survey measures individuals' moral identities. In the experiment, subjects are placed {{in a situation where}} they have an opportunity to behave immorally to gain an advantage over others. Results show that both the moral identity <b>and</b> <b>group</b> <b>membership</b> predict moral behavior in a situation. Direct activation of the moral identity is not required for it to influence moral behavior, which supports the moral identity as a principle-level identity. Implications of the study findings and recommendations for future research are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Failure {{detection}} <b>and</b> <b>group</b> <b>membership</b> are {{two important}} components of fault-tolerant distributed systems. Understanding their role is essential when developing efficient solutions, {{not only in}} failure-free runs, but also in runs in which processes do crash. While <b>group</b> <b>membership</b> provides consistent information {{about the status of}} processes in the system, failure detectors provide inconsistent information. This paper discusses the trade-offs related to the use of these two components, and clarifies their roles using three examples. The first example shows a case where <b>group</b> <b>membership</b> may favourably be replaced by a failure detection mechanism. The second example illustrates a case where <b>group</b> <b>membership</b> is mandatory. Finally, the third example shows a case where neither <b>group</b> <b>membership</b> nor failure detectors are needed (they may be replaced by weak ordering oracles) ...|$|R

40|$|The {{human face}} {{provides}} {{a wealth of}} information about a person, displaying cues of <b>group</b> <b>membership</b> such as age, sex and race and also emotional expressions. Independently, both <b>group</b> <b>membership</b> cues <b>and</b> emotional expressions are spontaneously evaluated. There is, however, little research regarding how facial features such as emotional expression <b>and</b> cues of <b>group</b> <b>membership</b> such as racial background or age interact in the formation of spontaneous evaluations. As well, the relative importance of these different facial cues in evaluation is unknown. Using the affective priming paradigm as well as an adapted affective priming dual task paradigm, these questions were investigated. Images of own and other race faces (Experiment 1) and young and old faces (Experiment 2) displaying happy, neutral and angry expressions were used. It was found that spontaneous evaluations of emotions occurred regardless of the race or age of the face. Spontaneous evaluations of <b>group</b> <b>membership</b> only occurred when attention was focused on facial cues of <b>group</b> <b>membership.</b> These findings indicate that emotional expressions are evaluated preferentially in the context of faces which vary in both emotional <b>and</b> <b>group</b> <b>membership</b> cues, suggesting the relative importance of emotional expression in the context of interpersonal interactions with unfamiliar members of other groups...|$|R
40|$|Reproductive skew models {{attempt to}} predict the {{fraction}} of reproduction contributed by each individual that participates in a communal brood. One potential limitation of these models is that individuals make a single, fixed decision about <b>group</b> <b>membership</b> <b>and</b> reproductive allocation {{at the beginning of}} the breeding period. While this is appropriate for animals that reproduce in a synchronous bout, many cooperative breeders produce offspring over a prolonged period of time. It is likely that these species adjust reproductive allocation <b>and</b> <b>group</b> <b>membership</b> over time in response to temporal shifts in <b>group</b> productivity <b>and</b> ecological constraints. In this paper we adapt transactional models of reproductive skew to a continuous form, generating time-dependent functions of reproductive allocation. We derive a general method for predicting temporal changes in <b>group</b> <b>membership</b> as well as a general expression for reproductive skew across the regions over which a group is stable. Using a linear approximation for time-dependent reproduction, we derive new expressions for reproductive skew in cases where the subordinate departs during the breeding period. In this case we find that the traditional model always overestimates the subordinate's share of reproduction when dominants are in control of both reproductive shares <b>and</b> <b>group</b> <b>membership</b> (i. e., concessions models). Conversely, we find that the traditional model always underestimates the subordinate's share of reproduction when subordinates are in control of reproductive shares (i. e., constraint models). We discuss the implications of these new calculations in relation to the traditional skew models and more recent empirical tests of reproductive skew in animal societies.

In order to circumvent the impossibility of solving consensus in asynchronous distributed systems, Chandra and Toueg introduced failure detectors based on timeouts [5 – 7].|$|R
40|$|This paper {{assesses the}} quality of various micro level {{measures}} of social capital. It begins by examining a simple model of social capital accumulation in which households acquire social capital by devoting resources to forming relationships with other households. Through these relationships households acquire access to social resources which raises utility for any level of consumption. Tests of the model reveal {{that there is no}} statistically significant relationship between widely used proxy variables for social capital, measures of trust <b>and</b> <b>group</b> <b>membership,</b> <b>and</b> access to social resources. However, variation in measures of the frequency of contact with family members and friends is positively related to differences in access to social resources. The paper then tests whether evidence that social capital has a significant economic impact depends on the use of these different measures of social capital. It does so by investigating whether the impact of the average level of human capital on individual wages is an increasing function of a person’s social capital. The impact on wages of the share of the population within a city or county that has a bachelor’s degree is indeed an increasing function of the frequency of contact measure, but it is unrelated to the measures of trust <b>and</b> <b>group</b> <b>membership...</b>|$|R
40|$|Social Dominance Orientation (SDO; Pratto et al., 1994) is an {{individual}} difference variable that describes a person 2 ̆ 7 s orientation toward group-based hierarchy. It {{has been associated with}} avoidant attachment style in interpersonal relationships (Weber 2 ̆ 6 Federico, 2007), but as an orientation toward groups, its relationship to group attachment has not been studied. In addition, low SDO individuals (those who tend to be less prejudiced) are not well understood. Three studies explored the relationship between SDO <b>and</b> <b>group</b> attachment. The first study developed the Attachment to Group Scale, a scale designed to measure individuals 2 ̆ 7 attachment style (secure, anxious-ambivalent, or avoidant) to their <b>groups.</b> The second <b>and</b> third studies examined the effect of intragroup and intergroup threats on participants 2 ̆ 7 ratings of social <b>groups</b> <b>and</b> feelings of closeness to their own group using an abstract manipulation that allowed participants to perceive scenarios about groups that were important to them. These effects were moderated by SDO, secure attachment to the group, anxious-ambivalent attachment to the <b>group,</b> <b>and</b> avoidant attachment to the group. Results suggest that an anxiety about <b>group</b> power <b>and</b> <b>group</b> <b>membership</b> may underlie SDO and that anxious-ambivalent attachment to the group may be able to explain such feelings of anxiety, whereas low SDO participants may feel more secure in their <b>groups</b> <b>and</b> <b>group</b> <b>membership.</b> ...|$|R
