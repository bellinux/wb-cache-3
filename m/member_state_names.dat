40|$|The H 2020 {{research}} and innovation funding for Societal Challenge 5 focuses on preserving current resources, acquiring new ones and on sustainable management of natural eco-systems in particular raw materials. The CASI project responds to the Societal Challenge 5 with the main objective to develop a methodological framework for assessing sustainable innovation and managing multi-disciplinary solutions through public engagement in the RTDI system. This is done by ensuring the commitment of {{a broad spectrum of}} societal stakeholders into its implementation, including industry, policy-makers, research organisations and academia, civil society organisations and the general public. The developed methodology has proven to be effective, that among other is manifested through an online repository of collected sustainable innovation initiatives (over 500 cases coming from 28 EU <b>Member</b> <b>States),</b> <b>named</b> CASIPEDIA. It thus presents a wide selection of European sustainable innovation initiatives to experts and supporters of sustainability agendas. This policy brief provides insights from the first assessment report of the Societal Challenge 5 and the issues observed followed by an analysis of sustainable innovation initiatives in the CASIPEDIA database, which showcases the sectoral relevance of the initiatives. Statistical analysis is used to identify differences in how sustainable innovation initiatives in the main sectors relate to the societal challenges. The findings show for example that it would appear worthwhile to consider if the distribution of sustainable innovation across industrial sectors meets the set policy targets. Furthermore, different policy implementation methods could be considered. For instance, funding can be considered particularly beneficial in societal challenges, which already attract sustainable innovation, while setting strict emission standards could steer to innovate in other challenges...|$|R
40|$|This bachelor’s thesis <b>named</b> Actual <b>State</b> and {{potential}} of renewable sources utilization in the EU offers a detailed {{summary of the}} current and future utilization of renewable resources in each <b>member</b> <b>state</b> of the European Union. The opening chapters briefly introduce the term renewable resources and the legislation relating to this issue. The following chapter is devoted to a detailed background research of actual renewable energy utilization in all twenty seven <b>member</b> <b>states</b> of the European Union. The countries are ranked by their dates of accession to the Union in ascending order, in each chapter alphabetically. All information and data are obtained from reliable sources such as annual energy reports of ministries or institutions which are concerned with energy issues. This chapter contains {{a great amount of}} charts and tables taken from annual reports and which are revised for the needs of this thesis. The chapter named Potential of renewable energy utilization in the EU offers an insight into the assumed future utilization of renewable resources up to the year 2020. This chapter draws from so-called National renewable energy action plans (NREAP) in which each <b>member</b> <b>state</b> presents its plan leading to higher renewable sources utilization in the near future. The reader is therefore able to familiarize with plans concerning renewable sources in each <b>member</b> <b>state.</b> The chapter <b>named</b> Complex evaluation familiarizes with some pros and cons concerning renewable sources and their utilization. Further the author presents his point of view on renewable sources and some recommendation leading to a better integration of renewable sources into energetics...|$|R

40|$|From the introduction]. My {{study will}} focus in {{particular}} on three claims {{made in the}} literature about <b>member</b> <b>state</b> interaction with the Court. The first claim is that <b>member</b> <b>state</b> participation was initially low and {{that much of the}} Court's constitutionalization of the Treaty occurred when <b>member</b> <b>states</b> were simply too inattentive to notice the magnitude of the Court's activity. The second claim is that early <b>member</b> <b>state</b> participation reflected a concern to protect national laws, but that this pattern of <b>member</b> <b>state</b> participation is changing as <b>member</b> <b>state</b> evince more of a desire to influence the general trend of Commmunity law. The final claim tested is that, with the Single European Act's change to qualified majority voting in the Council, member states' attitudes of acceptance toward the Court will change, and criticism of the Court will increase. This hypothesis is {{based on the belief that}} the supranationalism of the ECJ was accepted because of the intergovernmentalism of the Council. The data on <b>member</b> <b>state</b> participation suggests, however, that none of these claims provide an accurate picture of <b>member</b> <b>state</b> interaction with the Court. While there has been an increase in participation over time, <b>member</b> <b>states</b> have shown a high degree of participation in Article 177 cases from the outset. Further, trends in <b>member</b> <b>states</b> participation do not provide adequate empirical proof of a change in <b>member</b> <b>state</b> participation from self-interest to a Community interest. Finally, <b>member</b> <b>states</b> do not appear to have changed their behavior toward the Court since the passage of the Single European Act...|$|R
