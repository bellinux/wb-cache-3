5|$|Doudna also {{proposes that}} Hyrcanus II {{was seen as}} the Teacher of Righteousness. According to Doudna, Hyrcanus II’s sectarian {{orientation}} is now generally understood to have been Sadducee; whereas Antigonus was <b>more</b> <b>sympathetic</b> towards the Pharisees.|$|E
5|$|Artistically, the Grand National {{experiment}} {{was a success}} for Cagney, {{who was able to}} move away from his traditional Warner Bros. tough guy roles to <b>more</b> <b>sympathetic</b> characters. How far he could have experimented and developed will never be known, but back in the Warner fold, he was once again playing tough guys.|$|E
5|$|At party level, the Labour Party, in {{opposition}} until October 1964, was overtly against Southern Rhodesian independence under the 1961 constitution and {{supportive of the}} black nationalist movement on ideological and moral grounds. The Liberal Party, holding a handful of parliament seats, took a similar stance. The Conservative Party, while also following a policy of decolonisation, was <b>more</b> <b>sympathetic</b> to the Southern Rhodesian government's position, and included members who openly supported it.|$|E
60|$|I {{hesitated for}} a moment. Then the delight of talking about it overcame my fear of being chaffed. Besides, when she felt it, nobody could be <b>more</b> delightfully <b>sympathetic.</b> I {{determined}} to adventure it.|$|R
50|$|Many daimyos {{converted}} to Christianity {{in order to}} gain more favorable access to saltpeter, used to make gunpowder. Between 1553 and 1620, eighty-six daimyos were officially baptized, and many <b>more</b> were <b>sympathetic</b> to the Christians.|$|R
50|$|With {{the fall}} of Maximilien Robespierre 9 Thermidor he was {{released}} from his duties on the Committee of General Security. In his tenure on the committee he gained {{a reputation as one of}} the <b>more</b> accommodating, <b>sympathetic</b> members.|$|R
5|$|Descendants of the mutineers {{and their}} Tahitian consorts live on Pitcairn into the 21st century. The {{generally}} accepted view of Bligh as an overbearing monster and Christian as a tragic victim of circumstances, {{as depicted in}} well-known film accounts, has been challenged by late 20th- and 21st-century historians from whom a <b>more</b> <b>sympathetic</b> picture of Bligh, and a more critical one of Christian, has emerged.|$|E
5|$|In {{the present}} day, several groups are {{demanding}} that Jamila be given the death sentence. One male guard, (Surya Saputra), takes pity on Jamila and tries to help her. However, Jamila ignores him. Ria, although slowly becoming <b>more</b> <b>sympathetic</b> to Jamila, gets into an argument with her over Nurdin's murder; this results in Jamila being placed in isolation.|$|E
5|$|Now the strip's sole writer, Wagner {{was free}} {{to return to the}} Democracy theme, this time with a <b>more</b> <b>sympathetic</b> {{depiction}} of Dredd's character in which Dredd began to have misgivings about his role in suppressing the Democratic March. Dredd's qualms would become the catalyst to take the whole Judge Dredd strip in a new direction.|$|E
50|$|As for the Malays, {{except for}} a few who were close to the Chinese, most took no <b>more</b> than <b>sympathetic</b> or neutral stands toward the MPAJA. This means that the MPAJA would not have the {{majority}} support from the Malays in Malaya.|$|R
5000|$|Charles Gayarré ... and Alcée Fortier ... led the outspoken though desperate {{defense of}} the Creole. As bright as these men clearly were, they still became engulfed in the {{reclassification}} process intent on salvaging white Creole status. Their speeches consequently read <b>more</b> like <b>sympathetic</b> eulogies than historical analysis.|$|R
5000|$|The superficially {{sympathetic}} man flings a coin to the beggar; the <b>more</b> deeply <b>sympathetic</b> man builds an almshouse for {{him so he}} need {{no longer}} beg; {{but perhaps the most}} radically sympathetic of all is the man who arranges that the beggar shall not be born.|$|R
5|$|Pierlot and Spaak, {{together}} with Pierlot's family, crossed into Francoist Spain with an official visa, but {{were arrested in}} Barcelona and held under house arrest in a hotel. On 18 October, they escaped from confinement and headed for Portugal where the regime of António de Oliveira Salazar, although neutral, was <b>more</b> <b>sympathetic</b> to the Allied cause than Spain. They finally arrived in London on 22 October.|$|E
5|$|As a Liberal MP he {{supported}} Irish Home Rule, trade unions, {{free trade and}} welfare reforms. Leading up to the First World War he argued that Britain should adopt a <b>more</b> <b>sympathetic</b> approach towards Germany, including naval disarmament. When war did break out, Brunner was resolute in the opinion {{that it should be}} fought and won. In addition to the production of alkali, his factories were making other chemicals for use as explosives. He also built a new factory to purify trinitrotoluene.|$|E
5|$|Clark's ruling drew a {{resolution}} of condemnation from the Kentucky General Assembly. He was summoned {{to appear before the}} legislature, but opted to respond to their charges in writing instead. Incensed, the legislature attempted to removed him from office, but the vote of 5935 fell short of the needed two-thirds majority. In October 1823, Clark's decision was upheld by the Kentucky Court of Appeals; that decision touched off the Old Court-New Court controversy, wherein the legislature attempted to abolish the Court of Appeals {{and replace it with a}} <b>more</b> <b>sympathetic</b> court.|$|E
6000|$|I {{was young}} enough to blush. Fritz {{accepted}} the blush as a sufficient answer. [...] "Every moment I pass in your society," [...] he cried with enthusiasm, [...] "I like you better--find you <b>more</b> eminently <b>sympathetic.</b> You are in love. One word more--are there any obstacles in your way?" ...|$|R
25|$|The 1972 German film Ludwig - Requiem für einen jungfräulichen König (Ludwig – Requiem for a Virgin King), {{written and}} {{directed}} by Hans-Jürgen Syberberg provides a <b>more</b> personal, <b>sympathetic,</b> and idiosyncratic account of the King's life from boyhood to death, and stars Harry Baer and Balthasar Thomass as Ludwig II, and Gerhard Maerz as Richard Wagner.|$|R
50|$|In {{the third}} series, Gregory is <b>more</b> {{unambiguously}} <b>sympathetic,</b> {{trying to escape}} from {{his role as the}} keeper of Gregory House and enduring as many strange and bizarre events as either of the previous protagonists. Like them, he ultimately fails to escape, suggesting that even he is a prisoner in his strange world despite his ostensible mastery and ownership of it.|$|R
5|$|In Hastings's view, Lang was {{probably}} <b>more</b> <b>sympathetic</b> to Rome {{than any other}} Church of England archbishop of modern times, responsible for a discreet catholicisation of the Church of England's practices. A small outward indication of this was his decision to use a cassock as everyday dress and to wear a mitre on formal occasions, the first archbishop since the English Reformation to do so. Lang believed that {{in relation to the}} supreme truths of the church, rituals and dress were of small account, but that if people's worship was assisted by such customs they should be allowed.|$|E
5|$|Originally {{the actions}} of this tengu were portrayed as another attempt by demons to throw the world into chaos and war, but as Yoshitsune's renown as a legendary warrior increased, his monstrous teacher came to be {{depicted}} in a much <b>more</b> <b>sympathetic</b> and honorable light. In {{one of the most}} famous renditions of the story, the Noh play Kurama Tengu, Ushiwaka is the only person from his temple who does not give up an outing in disgust at the sight of a strange yamabushi. Sōjōbō thus befriends the boy and teaches him out of sympathy for his plight.|$|E
5|$|Senator Powell favored Kentucky's {{neutrality}} policy {{during the}} Civil War, but nationally, the conflict {{put him in}} a tenuous political situation. On one hand, he favored a strong national government and a strict interpretation of the U.S. Constitution. On the other hand, he was an opponent of coercion, and due to Kentucky's proximity to the Southern states, maintained a <b>more</b> <b>sympathetic</b> view of the southern cause than legislators from more northern states. During his term as governor, Powell had been critical of Northern states that refused to abide by the Fugitive Slave Act.|$|E
6000|$|Her {{glance and}} her tone, both <b>more</b> intimately <b>sympathetic</b> {{than she had}} {{hitherto}} permitted them to be, touched him deeply, and with an effect of throwing off his gloom he cheerily responded: [...] "We will not let any outside matter interfere with our happiness. There {{is nothing to be}} gained by staying at home. Please forget all about this interruption." ...|$|R
50|$|Other English-speaking journalists, such as Ray Conlogue, Peter Scowen or Graham Fraser, {{have earned}} notable reputations for a <b>more</b> fair and <b>sympathetic</b> views of Quebec, in both sovereigntist and federalist circles.|$|R
50|$|Making Love was one {{of several}} {{mainstream}} Hollywood films to be released in 1982 dealing with themes of homosexuality in a <b>more</b> tolerant and <b>sympathetic</b> light. Others included Personal Best, Victor Victoria, and Partners.|$|R
5|$|The Independent and Ledger offered {{different}} versions of events, the former <b>more</b> <b>sympathetic</b> to the Nelsons. According to the Independent, Laura grabbed another gun, a Winchester rifle hidden behind a trunk. L. D. grabbed the Winchester at the same time, and during the struggle for the gun, it went off. A shell passed through Constable Martin's pant legs, grazing him in the thigh, then hit Loney in the hip and entered his abdomen. He walked outside and died a few minutes later.|$|E
5|$|The Nashville Christian Leadership Council (or NCLC), {{was founded}} by the Reverend Kelly Miller Smith, pastor of First Baptist Church, Capitol Hill. This {{organization}} was an affiliate of Martin Luther King, Jr.'s Southern Christian Leadership Conference and was established to promote civil rights for African Americans through nonviolent civil disobedience. Smith believed that White Americans would be <b>more</b> <b>sympathetic</b> to desegregation if African Americans obtained their rights through peaceful demonstration rather than through the judicial system or violent confrontation.|$|E
5|$|The {{reintegration}} of French prisoners into {{civilian life}} was facilitated by {{a network of}} Maisons du Prisonnier (Prisoner Houses), established across France, which would help them readjust and find work. Generally, prisoners generally found it easy to regain their pre-war jobs because of the shortage of labour. The government had hoped that returning prisoners of war would be <b>more</b> <b>sympathetic</b> to the Vichy regime, but prisoners coming back were not noticeably more loyal to Vichy than other groups.|$|E
50|$|She {{is noted}} for {{historical}} novels reassessing {{the role of}} women in Japanese history. She is praised for combining historical accuracy with translating her characters emotions into modern terms. In Masako, she countered popular image of Minamoto no Yoritomo's jealous, power-grasping wife Hōjō Masako (1157-1225) with a <b>more</b> human, <b>sympathetic</b> personality. Her novel was the basis for a yearlong television drama on the Japanese government television network NHK, in 1979.|$|R

60|$|A lusty cheer {{was given}} by those on the {{platform}} who witnessed this bold rescue, and <b>more</b> than one <b>sympathetic</b> hand grasped the massive fist of Joe Turner as he assisted Mrs Durby to a carriage.|$|R
5|$|Anne Crewe's great-grandson, John Crewe (1742–1829), {{was created}} the first Baron Crewe in 1806. A {{prominent}} Whig politician, he was a lifelong friend and supporter of Charles James Fox; his wife Frances Crewe (née Greville; 1748–1818) was a famous beauty and political hostess who gave lavish entertainments at the hall. The Crewes' social circle included many of the major figures of the day, and visitors to the hall during this period included politicians Fox and George Canning, philosopher Edmund Burke, playwright Richard Brinsley Sheridan, poet William Spencer, musicologist Charles Burney, and artists Sir Joshua Reynolds and Sir Thomas Lawrence. John Crewe had the park landscaped and the hall extended, and also had the interior remodelled in the neo-Classical style then fashionable. Some forty years later, his grandson Hungerford Crewe (1812–94) went to considerable expense to have the interiors redecorated in a <b>more</b> <b>sympathetic</b> Jacobethan style.|$|E
5|$|Clark {{accepted}} {{an appointment to}} the circuit court of Bourbon and Clark counties in 1817. It was in this capacity that the most defining event of his career occurred. In 1822, he struck down a debt relief law {{in the case of}} Williams v. Blair on the basis that it impeded the obligation of contracts. His decision was unpopular with the legislature, who condemned the ruling and summoned Clark to appear before them and defend it. An attempt by the legislature to remove him from office fell short of the needed two-thirds majority. The following year, the Kentucky Court of Appeals upheld Clark's ruling. In retaliation, the legislature attempted to abolish the court and create a new one <b>more</b> <b>sympathetic</b> to their views. This event and its aftermath became known as the Old Court-New Court controversy.|$|E
5|$|Dickens wrote A Christmas Carol at a {{time when}} the British were {{examining}} and exploring Christmas traditions from the past, such as carols, as well as new customs such as Christmas trees. He was influenced by experiences from his own past, and from the Christmas stories of other authors, including Washington Irving and Douglas Jerrold. Dickens had written three Christmas stories prior to the novella, and was inspired to write the story following a visit to the Field Lane Ragged school, one of several establishments for London's half-starved, illiterate street children. The treatment of the poor and the ability of a self-interested man redeeming himself by transforming into a <b>more</b> <b>sympathetic</b> character are the key themes of the story. There is discussion among academics as to whether this was a fully secular story, or if it is a Christian allegory.|$|E

They've fired {{our four}} best men--the ones {{that was always}} on the conference committees. Did it without cause. They're lookin' for trouble, as I told you, an' they'll get it, too, if they don't watch out. We got our tip from the Frisco Water Front Confederation. With them backin' us we'll go some." ...|$|R
50|$|Calvert Vaux and Frederick Law Olmsted {{were hired}} {{to design the}} {{landscape}} soon afterwards. An English immigrant, Vaux had worked for Andrew Jackson Downing of Newburgh, whose ideas about a <b>more</b> naturally <b>sympathetic</b> architecture guided much home construction in mid-19th century America. Two years earlier, Vaux and Olmsted, another Downing disciple, had won New York City's design competition to create Central Park. This fame followed Vaux to Middletown when he began work on the cemetery the next year.|$|R
50|$|During {{the civil}} war period, Soyo, {{previously}} {{under the control of}} Kongo, became independent. It still regularly interfered with Kongolese affairs and invaded several times to depose kings who were not pro-Soyo. When the Soyo invaded in 1669, they overthrew Pedro III, {{who was a member of}} the House of Kinlaza and replaced him with Álvaro IX, who was a member of the <b>more</b> Soyo <b>sympathetic</b> House of Kimpanzu. However even the nobles of Kimpanzu had grown resentful of Soyo interfering in Kongo affairs. Rafael deposed Álvaro and took his place as Manikongo.|$|R
