40|$|This project {{shows how}} an {{interactive}} object based {{graphical user interface}} for a plant supervision or control application may be implemented using state-of-the-art software languages and tools. In many current plant supervisory, control and data acquisition systems (SCADA) data presentation is limited to archaic character based graphics and text based prompts {{with little or no}} use of pointing devices. With the emergence of object-oriented programming languages and graphics function libraries this project shows how a decisive upgrade in the graphics for these systems may be achieved, thereby bringing realism into plant <b>mimic</b> <b>diagrams.</b> The <b>mimic</b> <b>diagrams</b> created in this project consist of a static background, acquired by the use of scanning devices or paint packages, and a dynamic background of icons, generated using object-oriented C++ classes. The project is an object-oriented application and hence illustrates the object-oriented paradigm. The thesis introduces the area of supervisory, control and data acquisition systems. It examines graphic standards and operating system options, and highlights the need for a user friendly extensible graphic interface to telemetry systems. It also shows how object-orientation should provide for systems that are not only easier to extend and maintain but may also spawn parts which may be used for future projects. The thesis, based on experience gained throughout the project, examines C++, classes, inheritance, problems associated with C++ environments and the dangers of product incompatibility. It discusses graphic elements, such as bitmaps, icons and menus, and shows how object-orientation may be applied to them. It expounds on real-time considerations and icon animation and details the full project implementation including compilation and memory management systems used. Finally it points to the future, to the impact of object-oriented programming on technical management, to object-oriented databases and the object-oriented SCADA workstation of the future, and to changes imminent in C++ itself...|$|R

The panels would have slight gaps, about one to five percent of the total area. Lines would connect the edge of one sail to the other. Masses in the middles of these lines would pull the sails taut against the coning caused by the radiation pressure. JPL researchers said that this might be an attractive sail design for large manned structures. The inner ring, in particular, might be made to have artificial gravity roughly equal to the gravity on the surface of Mars.|$|R
40|$|New turnkey data {{acquisition}} systems purchased from industry are being integrated into CERN's Technical Data Server. The short time available for system integration {{and the large}} amount of data per system require a standard and modular design. Four different integration layers have been defined in order to easily 'plug in' industrial systems. The first layer allows the integration of the equipment at the digital I/O port or fieldbus (Profibus-DP) level. A second layer permits the integration of PLCs (Siemens S 5, S 7 and Telemecanique); a third layer integrates equipment drivers. The fourth layer integrates turnkey <b>mimic</b> <b>diagrams</b> in the TCR operator console. The second and third layers use two new event-driven protocols based on TCP/IP.

40|$|Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) {{systems are}} widely used at CERN and in {{industrial}} control environments. Recently the CERN Controls Board recommended a SCADA system {{for use in the}} CERN experiments and the controls sectors. The Technical Control Room (TCR) currently monitors the complete technical infrastructure at CERN using a component-ware architecture. A migration to the recommended SCADA system has been started in order to be ready for the monitoring of the future LHC infrastructure. This gives the advantage of having an integrated tool for alarms, <b>mimic</b> <b>diagrams,</b> trending and data acquisition but requires a careful analysis of the hard- and software architecture. The configuration management, the supervision of the different elements in the control chain and the data exchange with other systems will play an important role and have to be considered from the beginning...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{work has}} {{suggested}} that for some tasks, graphical displays which visually integrate information {{from more than one}} source offer an advantage over more traditional displays which present the same information in a separated format. Three experiments are described which investigate this claim using a task which requires subjects to control a dynamic system. In the first experiment, the integrated display is compared to two separated displays, one an animated <b>mimic</b> <b>diagram,</b> the other an alphanumeric display. The integrated display is shown to support better performance in a control task, but experiment 2 shows that part of this advantage may be due to its analogue nature. Experiment 3 considers performance on a fault detection task, and shows no difference between the integrated and separated displays. The paper concludes that previous claims made for integrated displays may not generalize from monitoring to control tasks...|$|R

30|$|The {{failures}} in the cyber layer make their corresponding part in the physical layer unobservable and uncontrollable. Thus, in the <b>mimic</b> <b>diagram</b> of the physical layer, the unobservable and uncontrollable part should {{be removed from the}} optimal security and mitigation action calculation. The tripping of overloaded transmission lines generates new nodes in the physical layer disconnected from others and to be islands. The generator in a self-supply island can keep the energy interdependence still working, while that in a non-self-supply island can no longer keep the energy interdependence working, and thus, the cyber node is shut down. The state of a cyber node depends on whether the node is equipped with a backup power source. The failures that occur in the physical layer are unobservable, and thus, no effective security controls can be taken. For the observable and controllable part, the latest operation state data are sent to the control center in the cyber layer step-by-step. After the derivation of the security controls in the control center, the control data are sent back to the corresponding node to act correctly. If the data transmission delay is beyond the RRT threshold, the operation state or the control commands will not be executed accurately in the current stage.|$|R

40|$|This study {{presents}} {{the equipment and}} technique used in the author’s palynological carbonization studies. The equipment consists mainly of modified Zeiss microphotographie equipment. A photoelectric cell fitted with a field restrictor is {{used to measure the}} light absorption of a spore or pollen type. The light-absorption value {{is considered to be a}} measure of carbonization, and values of a standard spore or pollen type are used to construct a carbonization line for an individual well. Isocarbonization lines can be constructed in sections to show local or regional carbonization. Maps, block <b>diagrams,</b> <b>panel</b> <b>diagrams,</b> etc., can be constructed with either isocarbonization or carbonization contours. Carbonization is a low-grade metamorphic process; an understanding of this process and its effects can be useful to the petroleum industry. The primary advantage of the described technique is that the degree of carbonization of pollen-grains and spores is a measure of low-grade (organic) metamorphism in areas or intervals devoid of coal. In addition the technique is cheaper and faster than the usual chemical coal analyses. Samples normally taken in the petroleum industry, such as cores, sidewall cores, and cuttings, can be used in palynological carbonization studies. Palynological carbonization studies may be undertaken not only in strata in which palynological time correlations arc possible but also in areas or sections in which alteration is too great for routine palynological time correlation. The carbonization method is unsuccessful in extremely carbonized zones, where alteration makes standard types unrecognizable, or, of course, in strata devoid of pollen-grains and spores. The equipment and technique described here yield reasonably accurate and reproducible data that may shed some light on the temperature history of the organic material, the sediments, and the associated hydrocarbons...|$|R
40|$|Process Industries are {{hazardous}} in nature. They require good instrumentation {{support for}} control and monitoring various parameters like pressure, flow, level, temperature, speed, vibration, displacement, etc. Sensors {{are to be}} installed at remote fields and measured variables are brought to the operator station for further processing. Initially separate TVs are installed at operator station to view the remote field images (Photographs) taken through analog (conventional) cameras. By viewing both the computer monitor and separate TVs, control signals are generated for abnormalities in the plant by human intervention, which may lead to errors due to human fatigue, sleeplessness in the night, etc. In the present days the signals from sensors are compared and control action is initiated. This also is not full proof method due to errors in sensors. Now due to the invent of digital cameras, analog cameras are replaced by digital cameras at remote fields and the digital signals of real time field images can be directly integrated in to the computer. With the help of emerging DIP(Digital Image Processing) technology these digital images are compared with already stored standard images of remote field and control action is initiated by computer automatically for abnormalities for parameters like level, flow, speed etc by matching the images.

It is interesting to observe that the gyrotropy (axial symmetry around the mean magnetic field) is broken. The spectral energy shows an extension in the oblique direction from the flow direction.

30|$|To further {{verify the}} {{existence}} of the linear wave modes, the coherent wave components are studied using the dispersion relation diagram and the phase speed diagram for comparison with the MHD linear-mode waves. The dispersion relation diagram presents the distribution of frequencies and the wavevector angles from the mean magnetic field for the local spectral peaks {{as a function of the}} wavenumbers (Fig.  7). The dotted line in the wavenumber–frequency <b>diagram</b> (top <b>panel)</b> represents a reference dispersion relation. Field-aligned Alfvén waves with the relation ω = k V_ A are taken for the reference dispersion relation. The Alfvén speed is estimated around V_ A = 1390.6 km/s. The Doppler shift (which is at most a few hundreds of km/s, see Fig.  2) is not significant as the flow speed is sufficiently below the Alfvén speed. The coherent waves show both higher and lower frequencies than that of the Alfvén waves (on the reference dispersion relation in the top panel), and the wavevector angles are broadly distributed including quasi-parallel, oblique, quasi-perpendicular, and quasi-anti-parallel directions with respect to the mean magnetic field (bottom panel).|$|R

50|$|LabVIEW {{integrates}} {{the creation}} of user interfaces (termed front panels) into the development cycle. LabVIEW programs-subroutines are termed virtual instruments (VIs). Each VI has three components: a block <b>diagram,</b> a front <b>panel,</b> and a connector panel. The last is used to represent the VI in the block diagrams of other, calling VIs. The front panel is built using controls and indicators. Controls are inputs: they allow a user to supply information to the VI. Indicators are outputs: they indicate, or display, the results based on the inputs given to the VI. The back panel, which is a block diagram, contains the graphical source code. All of the objects placed on the front panel {{will appear on the}} back panel as terminals. The back panel also contains structures and functions which perform operations on controls and supply data to indicators. The structures and functions are found on the Functions palette and can be placed on the back panel. Collectively controls, indicators, structures, and functions will be referred to as nodes. Nodes are connected to one another using wires, e.g., two controls and an indicator can be wired to the addition function so that the indicator displays the sum of the two controls. Thus a virtual instrument can be run as either a program, with the front panel serving as a user interface, or, when dropped as a node onto the block <b>diagram,</b> the front <b>panel</b> defines the inputs and outputs for the node through the connector pane. This implies each VI can be easily tested before being embedded as a subroutine into a larger program.|$|R

Nowadays, diabetes mellitus {{is considered to be}} one of the lifestyle deseases because of the frequent occurence in population and inappropriate life style. Several forms of diabetes can be distinguished. The most frequent desease children suffer from is diabetes mellitus type 1. This type does not produce any insulin which is important for the transformation of food into energy. The theoretical part of this work is devoted to the summary of the basic information about diabetes mellitus, clinical picture, diagnostic possibilities, different treatment, associated deseases, acute and chronic complications. The diabetics should not underestimate the diabetes and they should observe the regimen recommended by doctors because chronic complications of this desease might lead to serious complications causing death in some cases. The practical part focuses primarily on the diagnostic methods, both preanalytic and analytic. Twenty adolescent diabetics were examined in Stafila, s. r. o. laboratory.

Given a domain geometry and a node-spacing function, spheres are packed on geometric entities, namely, vertices, edges, faces, and volumes, in ascending order of dimension. Once the domain is filled with spheres, mesh nodes are placed at the centers of these spheres and are then connected by constrained Delaunay triangulation and tetrahedrization. To obtain a closely packed configuration of spheres, the authors devised a technique for physically based mesh relaxation with adaptive population control.

Also, multiple objects have a similar tendency as in 3.2 μm and they are among the most luminous stars, but, at 7.0 μm, some AGB stars {{also tend to be}} among the most luminous objects. YSOs and post-AGBs are “redder” than AGB stars and possible AGBs or similar giants.

In the N 3 –S 11 vs. S 11 <b>diagram</b> (lower <b>panel</b> of Fig. 5) a tendency to form clouds by all groups stretching from a lower to a higher luminosity is visible. Most of the multiple objects and AGBs represent luminosities similar to the background objects, which are less luminous than YSOs.

Multiple stellar systems, foreground objects, and AGB stars, occupy the “bluer” part of the diagram, while YSOs, post-AGB stars, and background objects, are found in the “redder” part. At 15.0 and 24.0 μm, all different types of objects are widely spread over the luminosity range and it is hard to distinguish the most luminous group.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the development and}} implementation of a hybrid SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition) system for the air suspension 'flash' alumina calciner at Aluminium de Grece St. Nicholas plant. The system includes two additional modules, an 'expert system' based on 10 years of commissioning and operating experience and a dynamic model continuously predicting the quality of the product. It is implemented on an industrial PC under an industrial control software environment and interfaces to the furnace through a programmable logic controller (PLC) system. The system guides the furnace operator to reduce sensible heat losses by operating with a marginal excess air flow rate, to take advantage of the higher energy efficiency at higher production rates and, at the same time, to avoid potentially dangerous operating conditions leading to loss of production and consequential energy losses. It also performs the traditional SCADA functions (data acquisition, maintaining history files for important parameters and display of important operating parameters in both a <b>mimic</b> process <b>diagram</b> and a series of graphs.) In addition to these tasks a simplified dynamic model gives the operator a prediction of the current value of the main product quality parameter, which can only be measured with laboratory equipment. Preliminary results have shown that reduction of secondary air flow rate and reduced downtime achieved by the operator under the guidance of the system can reduce energy consumption by as much as 10 %. A similar, or even greater, improvement in energy efficiency can be expected by implementing a similar system to cement calcination kilns based on the same technology. © European Communities 1997.
