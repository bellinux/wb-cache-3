40|$|Abstract. The {{assessment}} of Myocardial Blush Grade after primary angioplasty is a precious diagnostic tool to understand {{if the patient}} needs further medication {{or the use of}} specifics drugs. Unfortunately, the {{assessment of}} MBG is difficult for non highly specialized staff. Experimental data show that there is poor correlation between MBG assessment of low and high specialized staff, thus reducing its applicability. This paper proposes a method able to achieve an objective measure of MBG, or a set of parameters that correlates with the <b>MBG.</b> <b>The</b> method tracks the blush area starting from just one single frame tagged by the physician. As a consequence, the blush area is kept isolated from contaminating phenomena such as diaphragm and arteries movements. We also present a method to extract four parameters that are expected to correlate with the MBG. Preliminary results show that the method is capable of extracting interesting information regarding the behavior of the myocardial perfusion...|$|E

Working with highly structured ring and module spectra, let M be any module over MU; examples include {{all of the}} standard homotopical MU-modules, such as the Brown-Peterson and Morava K-theory spectra. We shall prove localization and completion theorems for the computation of M(BG) and <b>M(BG).</b> <b>The</b> G-spectrum MUG that represents stabilized equivariant complex cobordism is an algebra over the equivariant sphere spectrum SG, {{and there is an}} MUG-module MG whose underlying MU-module is M. This allows the use of topological analogues of constructions in commutative algebra. The computation ofM(BG) andM(BG) is expressed in terms of spectral sequences whose respective E 2 terms are computable in terms of local cohomology and local homology groups that are constructed from the coecient ring MUG and its module MG. The central feature of the proof is a new norm map in equivariant stable homotopy theory, the construction of which involves the new concept of a global I-functor with smash product. Content...|$|E

40|$|We {{propose a}} {{multiscale}} spoof-insulator-spoof (SIS) waveguide by introducing periodic geometry modulation in the wavelength scale to a SIS waveguide made of perfect electric conductor. The MSIS consists of multiple SIS subcells. The dispersion {{relationship of the}} fundamental guided mode of the spoof surface plasmon polaritons (SSPPs) is studied analytically within the small gap approximation. It is shown that the multiscale SIS possesses microwave band gap (MBG) due to the Bragg scattering. The "gap maps" in the design parameter space are provided. We demonstrate that the geometry of the subcells can efficiently adjust the effective refraction index of the elementary SIS and therefore further control the width and {{the position of the}} <b>MBG.</b> <b>The</b> results are in good agreement with numerical calculations by the finite element method (FEM). For finite-sized MSIS of given geometry in the millimeter scale, FEM calculations show that the first-order symmetric SSPP mode has zero transmission in the MBG within frequency range from 4. 29 GHz to 5. 1 GHz. A cavity mode is observed inside the gap at 4. 58 GHz, which comes from a designer "point defect" in the multiscale SIS waveguide. Furthermore, ultrathin MSIS waveguides are shown to have both symmetric and antisymmetric modes with their own MBGs, respectively. The deep-subwavelength confinement and the great degree to control the propagation of SSPPs in such structures promise potential applications in miniaturized microwave device...|$|E

The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the ability of mesoporous bioactive glass with ordered nanopores (80 S MBG) to adsorb and provide the delayed release of 125 I-tagged bone morphogenetic protein- 2 (BMP- 2). A 50 mg piece of 80 S MBG was produced, which comprised SiO 2, CaO and P 2 O 5 in a component molar ratio of 80 : 15 : 5. Each MBG piece adsorbed 30 µg 125 I-BMP- 2. Persistent radioactivity in the MBG was periodically measured in simulated body fluid. The total amount of BMP- 2 released and the mean amount released per day were calculated. A delayed release curve of BMP- 2 was constructed. SPSS 15. 0 software was used to perform a statistical analysis. The amount of BMP- 2 released in the first two days was one-quarter of the total load. A line equation, y = 490. 55 x 1 / 2 + 7268. 82, was obtained from the square root of protein release doses value at 3 - 94 days. The total amount of BMP- 2 released over 94 days was 11. 894 µg, which was ~ 39. 6 % of the total load. The half-life of the release time was 248 days. From the second week, the rate of BMP release had stabilized to a mean of 37. 42 ± 18. 67 ng/day and the difference of the mean amount released per day had no statistical significance (P> 0. 05).

BackgroundDespite restoration of epicardial blood flow during primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), one-third of patients do not obtain myocardial perfusion due to impairment in the microvascular circulation. MethodsWe examined the effect of symptom onset-to-balloon time (SBT) and door-to-balloon time (DBT) on myocardial reperfusion during primary PCI in STEMI, utilizing resolution of ST-segment elevation (STR) and the myocardial blush grade (<b>MBG).</b> <b>The</b> primary analysis was the relationships between SBT ≤ 2, > 2 to 4, and > 4 h and DBT ≤ 1, > 1 to 1. 5, > 1. 5 to 2, and > 2 h with MBG and STR. Clinical risk was assessed using {{a modified version of}} the Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction risk score for STEMI. ResultsIn 2, 056 patients, absent microvascular perfusion (MBG 0 / 1) and STR (STR < 30 %) after primary PCI was significantly more common in patients with longer SBT, in patients with both low and high clinical risk profiles. By multivariable analysis, SBT (p < 0. 0001), anterior infarction (p < 0. 0001), reference vessel diameter (p = 0. 005), lesion minimum lumen diameter (p < 0. 0001), hyperlipidemia (p = 0. 03), and current smoking (p = 0. 001) were independent predictors of MBG 0 / 1, whereas SBT (p = 0. 007), anterior infarction (p < 0. 0001), and history of renal insufficiency (p =  0. 0002) were independent predictors of absent STR. DBT (p < 0. 0001) was an independent predictor of MBG 0 / 1. MBG 0 / 1 and STR< 30 % identified patients with increased 3 -year mortality.

40|$|OBJECTIVE — Mean {{blood glucose}} (MBG) and MBG-independent factors both {{influence}} A 1 C levels. Race {{was related to}} A 1 C independent of MBG in adults. The goal {{of this study was}} to determine if racial disparity exists in A 1 C independent of MBG in children with diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS — Participants included 276 children with type 1 diabetes. A 1 C and MBG were obtained from multiple clinic visits, and a hemoglobin glycation index (HGI) (an assessment of A 1 C levels independent of MBG) was calculated. A 1 C and HGI were analyzed controlling for age, diabetes duration, and MBG. RESULTS — African Americans had statistically significantly higher A 1 C (9. 1 � 0. 1) and HGI (0. 64 � 0. 11) than Caucasians (A 1 C 8. 3 � 0. 1, HGI � 0. 15 � 0. 07) independent of covariates. CONCLUSIONS — Because of racial disparity in A 1 C, which is independent of MBG, we recommend that A 1 C and MBG be used together to make therapeutic decisions for children with diabetes. Diabetes Care 33 : 1025 – 1027, 2010 Our group previously demonstrated that A 1 C levels are determined by mean blood glucose (MBG) and MBG-independent factors (1 – 3). Identification of MBG-independent factors that influence A 1 C levels is important for proper interpretation of A 1 C results and assessment of glycemic control in patients with diabetes, particularly because patients with higher than average A 1 C levels independent of MBG have greater risk of microvascular complications (2). Recent data from adults (4 – 8) indicate that ethnicity/race is associated with differences in A 1 C independent of MBG. Race may also be associated with variation in A 1 C levels in children with or without diabetes (9, 10), although these findings were not shown to be independent of <b>MBG.</b> <b>The</b> goal of the current study was to determine if racial disparity exists in A 1 C independent of MBG in children with type 1 diabetes...|$|E
40|$|HbA 1 c expressed, as the {{percentage}} of adult haemoglobin that is glycated, is the most widely used measure of chronic glycaemia. Achieving near normal HbA 1 c levels have been shown to reduce long term complications and the HbA 1 c assay is recommended to determine whether treatment is adequate and to guide adjustments. However, daily adjustments of therapy are guided by glucose levels. We determined the relationship between an accurate measure of mean glucose levels over time and the HbA 1 c level, and whether HbA 1 c can be expressed in the same units as self monitoring results. The aim {{of the study was to}} assess whether HbA 1 c levels reflected mean blood glucose (MBG) levels in Type 2 diabetes. Despite the good correlation between HbA 1 c and <b>MBG,</b> <b>the</b> use of HbA 1 c alone for glycemic control monitoring in these patients could be insufficient to clearly trace their risk of complications. The study population consisted of 100 subjects divided into two groups viz. participants with diabetes (n= 50) and non-diabetic (n= 50). Changes in the levels of MBG and HbA 1 c were determined in diabetic and non-diabetic subjects. The level of blood glucose, HbA 1 c, MBG, microalbuminurea, urea and creatnine was significantly increased in diabetics than non diabetic subjects. There was a statistically significant relationship between MBG and HbA 1 c. The mathematical relationship established between HbA 1 c and MBG in this study should allow the expression of HbA 1 c as an equivalent for mean glucose level. This is likely to be beneficial to patients and care providers alike as the assay of chronic glucose control would be in the same units as the patient’s self-monitoring. However, before this transformation can take place, the mathematical relationship between HbA 1 c and MBG levels should be confirmed in a larger study with a more diverse population to ensure that the relationship applies for all diabetes patients...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{is comprised}} of three studies investigating how the provision of public information facilitates matching in online marketplaces. The first study examines how employers on oDesk. com, the world’s largest online marketplace, use public information in hiring. I show that when employers are searching for someone low-skilled the provision of coarse information is sufficient. When employers are looking for someone high-skilled they will pay fixed screening costs to acquire information beyond what {{is provided by the}} platform. When information is not provided by the market- place all employers will pay to acquire more information. This leads to more matches and hiring quality workers at a lower price. However, the cost savings from hiring these low-cost, but high-quality workers does not outweigh the upfront cost of information acquisition. The second study investigates how employers on oDesk. com alter their hiring behavior when some applicants, who were selected to be of higher quality by a machine learning algorithm, are covered by a money-back guarantee (<b>MBG).</b> <b>The</b> MBG increases the probability of transacting for employers looking for high-expertise talent. However, conditional on hir- ing, these employers do not substitute to observably different employees. Employers that are looking for lower expertise applicants substitute to higher quality applicants who are backed by the money-back guarantee. A follow-up experiment found that, given some reasonable assumptions, employers found the MBG to be more useful as a signal of applicant quality than as a risk-shifting mechanism. The third study uses a series of empirical tests to isolate the mechanism through which the weather affects bidders’ willingness to pay (WTP) on eBay. I find that some variation in bidders’ WTP across multiple auctions can be explained by weather affecting mood. Changes in mood can alter WTP through two channels. Mood can directly alter the perceived value of the item or mood can influence cognitive processes, changing bidding strategies and indirectly changing the bid amount. I concluded that rain alters mood, which alters bidders’ perceived value of an item on eBay leading to bidders increasing their bids...|$|E

40|$|The Hypersthene Gabbro of Ardnamurchan Point {{is formed}} by an outer Marginal Border Group (MBG) {{and a younger}} Inner Series (IS). <b>The</b> <b>MBG</b> is a single large {{intrusion}} which corresponds to a high - melt - percentage magma chamber. The IS is dominated by numerous gabbronorite sheet intrusions which formed a large low - melt - percentage magma body. The country rocks around <b>the</b> <b>MBG</b> show polyphase metamorphism. An early (Ml) phase of high-grade metamorphiam was followed by sudden cooling and then by hydrothermal metamorphism (M 2), related {{in part to the}} emplacement of the IS. The sudden cooling was caused by self - propagation of tensile fracture networks containing vigorously convecting hydrothermal fluids. The fracture networks were initiated by tectonic fracturing. The fractures networks also propagated into <b>the</b> <b>MBG</b> and partly preserved the magma chamber boundary layer formed during Ml. The contact of <b>the</b> <b>MBG</b> was approximately stationary during Ml. Wall - rock melting occurred in an episodic process triggered by movement on concentric inward - dipping normal faults due to fluctuations in magma pressure. The heat flux Q(_m) in the boundary layer was approximately equal to the heat flux Qc in the adjacent wall rocks. The preservation of the end – M 1 instantaneous metamorphic thermal gradient in the country rocks by the subsequent sudden cooling allows direct measurement of Q(_c) and hence of Q(_m) (8 - 40 Wm(^- 2) and other parameters of the boundary layer of <b>the</b> <b>MBG</b> magma chamber. <b>The</b> interior of <b>the</b> <b>MBG</b> magma chamber was probably just stably stratified but cooling at the chamber walls produced density currents and slow mixing between the layers.

Methodologically, {{the study was}} a cross-sectional case survey that involved the use of self-administered structured questionnaire to collect primary data from the customers of the two banks. The questionnaire administration yielded 77 % and 62 % response rates for GCB and MBG respectively. Data was analyzed using the SPSS 16. 0. The study found that, within GCB, satisfaction was highest for feeling of relief of customer to transact on the internet banking portal and accuracy of the online transaction process of the bank. The most dissatisfied item was reasonability of the transaction fee for this banking portal site. Between 68 % and 90 % of customers were dissatisfied with five dimension items, three of which relate to customer service and two relate to web design. Within MBG, more customers {{were satisfied with the}} entire internet banking service quality dimension items than dissatisfied. Customer satisfaction was highest for assurance dimension. The least satisfied quality item was in customer service, the internet banking system’s ability to guide customer to resolve problems. It was also found that customer satisfaction with internet banking service quality of the two is significantly different, with customers of MBG significantly satisfied than those of GCB. Moreover, generally, satisfaction of internet banking service quality differs among different income groups, but not significantly different according to their gender, age, education and marital status. Finally and comparatively, only two main web design variables are the common internet banking service quality variables that are found to have significant influence in the two banks. While the main methodological limitations of the study are noted, the study offers theoretical and managerial implications for scholars and practitioners and makes specific useful recommendations for management of each of the two banks and for future research.

40|$|Two {{spatially}} and temporally related subvolcanic intrusive suites, the McDougall Brook Granitic Suite (<b>MBG)</b> and <b>the</b> Mount Pleasant Granitic Suite (MPG), {{occur within}} the Late Devonian Mount Pleasant Caldera, southwestern New Brunswick.

The low-silica ( 74 wt. %) MPG are calc-alkaline and metaluminous to weakly peraluminous (A/CNK = 0. 91 – 1. 28), and exhibit some crustal A-type granite affi nities.

40|$|Due to the {{operation}} of the rotor, the helicopter is subject to important vibration levels affecting namely the fatigue of the mechanical parts and the passenger comfort. Suspensions between the main gear box (MGB) and the fuselage help to filter theses problematic vibrations. Their design can be difficult since the filtering should be efficient for different types of external forces (pumping force and roll/pitch torque) which may appear during the flight. As passive solutions classically show their limits, intelligent active solutions are proposed so that the filtering can be adjusted according to the vibration sources. Such studies still suffer from a lack of tools and methods, firstly, necessary to the design of complex mechanical systems (due to their multi-phase multi-physics multi-interaction characteristic, [...] .) and secondly, to develop of an intelligent joint. The main objective of this chapter is to provide a methodology for designing and analyzing an intelligent joint using an energetic representation approach: <b>the</b> multibond graph (<b>MBG).</b> This method is applied here to a complex mechanical system with closed kinematic chains (CKC) which is the joint between the main gear box (MGB) and the aircraft structure of a helicopter. Firstly, <b>the</b> <b>MBG</b> method is analyzed. Secondly, after a brief state of art of the MGB-Fuselage joint, developments focus on the 2 D and 3 D modeling of the MGB-Fuselage joint with a <b>MBG</b> approach. <b>The</b> 20 -sim software is used to conduct the simulation of bond graph.
