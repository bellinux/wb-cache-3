A REP trap has an AC frequency, termed critical frequency, above which particles cannot be trapped. It is expected to be dependent on dielectric properties of the particle and the medium.

A &am split extraction and an achromatic transport system for double-sided irradiation at 10 MeV is also dis-cussed. Table 1 lists the RTM parameters. AW was chosen to 2. 5 MeV giving the possibility to extract both 5 and 10 MeV elec-trons from the accelerator. Generally 10 MeV is the upper limit for irradiation with electrons and 5 MeV is the maxi-mum allowed electron energy for generating photons in in-dustrial applications[21. Table 1. 10 MeV RTM, General Parameters 1, INTRODU~X~N Interest in high current accelerators in the energy range of 5 to 10 MeV for use in industrial irradiation applications has grown in recent years. The beam power at 10 MeV electron energy is normally 20 to 50 kW. At 5 MeV the power equire-ments are generaIly much larger as electrons at this energy often are used for bremsstrahlung generation with low (- 5 %) electrons to photons conversion efficiency. A linear accelera-tor (linac) is most commonly used at 10 MeV. while at 5 MeV the accelerator fpreference so far is high power DC-type.
