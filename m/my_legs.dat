I got my [...] technique from airplanes...I was on a plane and asleep and the plane bounced and when we landed we bounced and it woke me up. Then the next flight I had the same pilot and the plane went down so smooth. So I asked the pilot why, and he said when you land a plane smooth, you get the plane elevated to the lowest position you can and then you smooth it in. Same with sliding... If you dive when you're running straight up then you have a long distance to get to the ground. But the closer you get to the ground the less time it will take... I was hitting the dirt so smooth, so fast, when I hit the dirt, there wasn't no hesitation. It was like a skid mark, like you throw a rock on the water and skid off it. So when I hit the ground, if you didn't have the tag down, I was by you. No matter if the ball beat me, I was by you. That was what made the close plays go my way, I think." ...|$|E

A few months after being released from the hospital, she became increasingly unable to bend her knees, and underwent surgery to replace her knees with titanium and plastic prosthetics.

500|$|Padres {{general manager}} Kevin Towers said Hoffman {{was the first}} one in and the last one out of the {{ballpark}} everyday. Hoffman adhered to a daily conditioning program. When pitcher Jeremy Fikac was promoted to the majors in 2001, Hoffman invited him to join him on his usual afternoon run. [...] "I remember sitting in the bullpen that night, and <b>my</b> <b>legs</b> were still trembling from the run", Fikac recalled. [...] "I'd run before, but not at that pace ... I was thinking, I hope they don't call on me because I can't feel <b>my</b> <b>legs</b> under me ... His work ethic is unbelievable." [...] Bochy said, [...] " [...] one of those guys like Tony Gwynn—they never feel like they've arrived. Tony never thought, 'Well, I'm hitting [...]360 ... ' He was never content. And Trevor's the same way. They just keep working and make sure that they've got goals they want to reach." [...] After every save opportunity, whether he converted it or blew it, Hoffman would sit in the dugout for up to five minutes after his teammates had cleared out. Whether it was the euphoria from success or the sting of failure, he would sit there and drain all the emotion out of himself, put the game behind him, and move on. Tracy Hoffman said, [...] "He's all about order. That's the foundation to what he does. You see it when he's on the field. He's always the same, win or lose. He doesn't smile, doesn't show any emotion." [...] Padres manager Bud Black marveled at Hoffman's regimen. [...] "The daily preparation for his job, that focus and dedication each day to prepare for the ninth inning ... It was incredible to see live", said Black. [...] "I played with George Brett, a Hall of Famer who was a great worker. But Trevor took it to a level and a commitment and Hall of Fame caliber." [...] After Hoffman resurrected his final season and recorded his 600th save, Macha said Hoffman's [...] "work ethic and perseverance paid off ... He had to grind it out to get there." ...|$|E

(She noted that Song of the Last Meeting, dated 29 September 1911, was her 200th poem). The book secured her reputation as a new and striking young writer, the poems Grey-eyed king, In the Forest, Over the Water and I don’t need <b>my</b> <b>legs</b> anymore making her famous. She later wrote [...] "These naïve poems by a frivolous girl for some reason were reprinted thirteen times [...] And they came out in several translations.

The lines of the chorus are sung by Beyoncé with pronouncing one word at a time in longer intervals. A short interlude about [...] "mov things to the bedroom" [...] is interpolated in the song.

500|$|The {{battle plan}} called for a {{combination}} of naval bombardments and an amphibious landing. The initial attempt was called off after adverse currents hampered the assault and {{the element of surprise}} was lost. Nelson immediately ordered another assault but this was beaten back. He prepared for a third attempt, to take place during the night. Although he personally led one of the battalions, the operation ended in failure: the Spanish were better prepared than had been expected and had secured strong defensive positions. Several of the boats failed to land at the correct positions in the confusion, while those that did were swept by gunfire and grapeshot. Nelson's boat reached its intended landing point but as he stepped ashore he was hit in the right arm by a musketball, which fractured his humerus bone in multiple places. He was rowed back to Theseus to be attended to by the surgeon, Thomas Eshelby. On arriving at his ship he refused to be helped aboard, declaring [...] "Let me alone! I have got <b>my</b> <b>legs</b> left and one arm." [...] He was taken to surgeon Eshelby, instructing him to prepare his instruments and [...] "the sooner it was off the better". Most of the right arm was amputated and within half an hour Nelson had returned to issuing orders to his captains. Years later he would excuse himself to Commodore John Thomas Duckworth for not writing longer letters due to not being naturally left-handed. He developed the sensation of phantom limb in his lost arm later on and declared that he had [...] "found the direct evidence of the existence of soul".|$|E
500|$|A {{group of}} four or five {{teenagers}} aged between 14 and 16 claim to have been playing near a cave in Cerro Azul, Panama when the creature emerged. They say that it approached them, and, fearing for their safety, they attacked the creature with sticks and rocks, killing it. They claim that they then threw its corpse into a pool of water before leaving the area. They later returned and took photographs of the creature's corpse, before sending the pictures to Telemetro, a Panamanian television station. Virginia Wheeler, writing for The Sun, claimed that the discovery [...] "sparked fear and confusion" [...] in the town. According to some sources, subsequent photographs were taken of the creature after it had further decomposed; however, doubts have been expressed about whether the later photos were of the same specimen. A few days after the photographs were taken, one of the teenagers gave a different account in an interview with Telemetro Reporta, saying [...] "I was in the river and I felt something grabbing <b>my</b> <b>legs</b> ... We took it {{out of the water and}} started throwing rocks and sticks at it. We had never seen anything like that." [...] The photographs show a pale creature that is mostly hairless, with a rubbery body. It has [...] "revolting features"; a snub-nose and long arms. Writers for the Huffington Post said that while the head is clearly animal, the torso is [...] "strange", while the limbs are reminiscent of thin human arms.

500|$|Davis {{received}} everyday {{playing time}} in 2012, starting at first base, at designated hitter, {{and in the}} outfield throughout the season. On May 6, in a 17-inning, 9-6 victory over the Boston Red Sox at Fenway Park, Davis went hitless in eight at bats, but ended up being the winning pitcher. His feat {{was the first of}} its kind since Rube Waddell achieved it on July 4, 1905. Davis was the designated hitter until he was pressed into service as a relief pitcher in the 16th inning after Showalter had depleted the Orioles' bullpen. He struck out two batters and did not allow a run in his two innings of mound work. He was the first position player in the American League (AL) to be the winning pitcher in a game since Rocky Colavito on August 25, 1968, and the first to pitch for the Orioles since Manny Alexander on April 19, 1996. He and losing pitcher Darnell McDonald were the first position players on opposing teams in the same contest to each work in relief since Ty Cobb and George Sisler on October 4, 1925, and the first where both earned pitching decisions since Sam Mertes and Jesse Burkett on September 28, 1902. Davis described his outing: [...] "After the first inning, I was just trying to get it over the plate, and I was like, 'This is a lot harder than it looks.' I told myself to start using <b>my</b> <b>legs</b> so I didn't blow my arm out or anything like that. But in all seriousness, to get a win like that here, to end a road trip like this, it's huge. Neither team wanted to lose today, especially when it goes to extra innings. I mean, they would have pulled people out of the stands to finish that game. It's just a huge win for us." ...|$|E
