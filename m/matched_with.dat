5|$|Before 1998, women's hockey {{had been}} {{dominated}} by Canada. Canadian teams had won every World Championship up to that point; however, by 1997, the American team had improved and was evenly <b>matched</b> <b>with</b> Canada. In thirteen games played between the two teams in 1997, Canada won seven and the United States won six. The 1998 Olympic tournament also included teams from Finland, Sweden, China and host Japan. Canada and the United States dominated the round-robin portion. In their head-to-head match, the United States overcame a 4–1 deficit to win 7–4. The two teams met in the final, which the United States won 3–1 to become the third ice hockey team to win Olympic gold.|$|E
5|$|Chamberlin was a {{prolific}} taxonomist who named over 4,000 new animal species in over 400 scientific publications. He specialized in arachnids (spiders, scorpions, and relatives) and myriapods (centipedes, millipedes, and relatives), ranking {{among the most}} prolific arachnologists and myriapodologists in history. He described over 1,400 species of spiders, 1,000 species of millipedes, {{and the majority of}} North American centipedes, although the quantity of his output was not always <b>matched</b> <b>with</b> quality, leaving a mixed legacy to his successors. He also did pioneering ethnobiological studies with the Goshute and other indigenous people of the Great Basin, cataloging indigenous names and cultural uses of plants and animals.|$|E

5|$|In {{intelligent}} mammals, such as primates, the cerebrum {{is larger}} {{relative to the}} rest of the brain. Intelligence itself is not easy to define, but indications of intelligence include the ability to learn, <b>matched</b> <b>with</b> behavioral flexibility. Rats, for example, are considered to be highly intelligent, as they can learn and perform new tasks, an ability that may be important when they first colonize a fresh habitat. In some mammals, food gathering appears to be related to intelligence: a deer feeding on plants has a brain smaller than a cat, which must think to outwit its prey.|$|E

30|$|Table 4 {{shows the}} utility {{parameters}} of teachers <b>matching</b> <b>with</b> a particular school type and of schools <b>matching</b> <b>with</b> a particular teacher type. The top-third of Table 4 contains parameters for teacher utility. The parameter on low experience for <b>matching</b> <b>with</b> a bad school type is 0.3224. That is, {{compared to the}} base case of a teacher with high experience originating from a good school, a low experience teacher is happier <b>matching</b> <b>with</b> a bad school. The negative parameter on mid experience {{can be interpreted as}} the significant disutility felt by a mid experience teacher when <b>matching</b> <b>with</b> a bad school, compared to a highly experienced teacher. This {{may be due to the}} fact that a mid-career teacher regards a transfer as a chance to move into a more desirable school, while a highly experienced teacher moving may be driven by life-style concerns unrelated to school quality. The parameter on originating from a bad school is 1.4381. That is, a teacher from a bad school will be significantly happier to <b>match</b> <b>with</b> a bad school compared to a teacher from a good school.|$|R

5|$|Stengel was {{introduced}} as Yankee manager on October 12, 1948, the 25th {{anniversary of his}} second World Series home run to beat the Yankees. Joe DiMaggio attended the press conference {{as a sign of}} team support. Stengel faced obstacles to being accepted—Harris had been popular with the press and public, and the businesslike Yankee corporate culture and successful tradition were thought to be ill <b>matched</b> <b>with</b> a manager who had the reputation of a clown and who had never had a major league team finish in {{the top half of the}} standings. Stengel's MLB involvement had been in the National League, and there were several American League parks in which he had neither managed nor played.|$|E
5|$|A {{few months}} later in 1974, {{researchers}} including Glenn T. Seaborg and Albert Ghiorso at the University of California, Berkeley, and E. Kenneth Hulet from the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, also synthesized the element by bombarding a californium-249 target with oxygen-18 ions, using equipment similar to that which had been used for the synthesis of element 104 five years earlier, observing at least seventy alpha decays, seemingly from the isotope seaborgium-263m with a half-life of 0.9±0.2seconds. The alpha daughter rutherfordium-259 and granddaughter nobelium-255 had previously been synthesised and the properties observed here <b>matched</b> <b>with</b> those previously known, as did the intensity of their production. The cross-section of the reaction observed, 0.3nanobarns, also agreed well with theoretical predictions. These bolstered the assignment of the alpha decay events to seaborgium-263m.|$|E

5|$|A more {{upmarket}} SS, the SS V-Series {{represents the}} first time this type of naming has been applied to Holden products. The V-Series naming is reminiscent of the V-badging on selected Cadillac models, another member of the GM family. The badge design on the bootlid bears strong resemblance to the ones used by Cadillac. But whereas Cadillac uses it to signify high-performance versions of its products, Holden V-Series variants boast extra features. The V-Series variants were introduced, largely due to a fully optioned Commodore SS in the VZ range being rather successful. The SS V offers extra luxuries at a similar price point to the preceding SS. Inside, it is recognisable by the metallic look pedals and instruments <b>matched</b> <b>with</b> the exterior colour. Additionally, the entire dashboard can be optioned in a range of loud colours: bright red, orange or black. The SS V exterior is equally adventurous, exhibiting five-spoke 19-inch alloy wheels and the option of larger 20-inch wheels: the largest wheels ever fitted to a Holden car.|$|E
5|$|Cotto's third {{championship}} defense {{took place}} on September 24, 2005 at Boardwalk Hall in Atlantic City, New Jersey, against Ricardo Torres of Colombia. In the first round Cotto had an offensive advantage and scored a knockdown on Torres. In the second round after trading hits Torres scored a knockdown on Miguel. The last seconds of the round were evenly <b>matched</b> <b>with</b> both boxers finishing the round injured. Cotto was apparently in better condition when the third round began and was dominating the fight at that point. With two minutes remaining in the round one of Cotto's punches landed in Torres' beltline. Following this Torres was granted thirty seconds to recover by the referee. Cotto dominated the fourth round and Torres won the fifth. Cotto won and scored a knockdown in the sixth round. At 1:24 of the seventh round a left hook by Cotto knocked Torres out.|$|E
5|$|Heading {{into the}} 2016–17 season, Parker lost {{longtime}} teammate Tim Duncan to retirement. The Spurs finished {{the season with}} a 61–21 record, as they registered back-to-back 60-win seasons {{for the first time in}} franchise history. Parker played 63 games and averaged 10.1 points per game, his lowest average since his rookie season. In the 2017 playoffs, the Spurs were once again <b>matched</b> <b>with</b> Grizzlies in the first round. San Antonio again defeated Memphis 4–2, with Parker averaging 16.3 points per game in the series. After scoring 18 points in Game 2 of the second round, a win against the Houston Rockets, Parker left the game with a rupture of his left quadriceps tendon that will preclude his return to the playoffs and may miss eight months. Game 3 of the series marked San Antonio's first postseason game without Parker since 2001, which ended an NBA record of 221 straight playoff appearances for Parker.|$|E

5|$|Players {{can either}} choose {{to play a}} ranked Deathmatch or DarkOps, {{where they will be}} <b>matched</b> <b>with</b> other players using a system called TrueSkill Matchmaking, or they may choose a player match where they can choose their game from a list of player hosted games. Like the {{original}} Perfect Dark, these games can be highly customized and can also include computer game bots. Features such as their difficulty and behavior can be changed to match player preference. For example, the Judge bot always attacks leading players with the highest kills score. Players can also issue commands to them {{as long as they are}} on their respective team, such as follow or hold position, and set waypoints for them to walk to. The game includes by default six different maps and each has two variants; the only change is the placement of the bases. Most of the maps are large ones, ideal for 32 players at once, with small variants for 4-16 player games.|$|E
5|$|The {{discovery}} of the gaps led to an extensive search for the missing elements. In 1914, several people claimed the discovery after Henry Moseley predicted {{the gap in the}} periodic table for the then-undiscovered element 72. Georges Urbain asserted that he found element 72 in the rare earth elements in 1907 and published his results on celtium in 1911. Neither the spectra nor the chemical behavior he claimed <b>matched</b> <b>with</b> the element found later, and therefore his claim was turned down after a long-standing controversy. The controversy was partly because the chemists favored the chemical techniques which led to the {{discovery of}} celtium, while the physicists relied {{on the use of the}} new X-ray spectroscopy method that proved that the substances discovered by Urbain did not contain element 72. By early 1923, several physicists and chemists such as Niels Bohr and Charles R. Bury suggested that element 72 should resemble zirconium and therefore was not part of the rare earth elements group. These suggestions were based on Bohr's theories of the atom, the X-ray spectroscopy of Moseley, and the chemical arguments of Friedrich Paneth.|$|E
