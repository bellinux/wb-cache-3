5|$|Traditionally, the badnjak {{ceremony}} {{begins on}} Christmas Eve, {{but there are}} many regional variations surrounding the details. Early in the morning the head of each family, usually accompanied by several male relatives, selects and fells the tree from which a log will be cut for their household. The group announces its departure by firing guns or small celebratory mortars called prangija. The Turkey oak is the most popular species of tree selected in most regions, but other oaks are also chosen. Beech, pear, quince, hornbeam, and plum trees are used in eastern Serbia, although less frequently than oak trees. In some areas of Montenegrin Littoral where oaks do not grow, olives, bay laurels, elms, or strawberry trees are used instead. Young, straight, and undamaged specimens are preferred. The badnjak may be <b>more</b> <b>valued</b> if it is felled stealthily in someone else's rather than in one's own woods.|$|E

500|$|The maids also deliver {{their version}} of {{narrative}} justice on Odysseus and Telemachus, who ordered and carried out their execution, and on Penelope who was complicit in their killing. The maids {{do not have the}} same sanctioned voice as Penelope and are relegated to unauthoritative genres, though their persistence eventually leads to <b>more</b> <b>valued</b> cultural forms. Their testimony, contrasted with Penelope's excuses while condemning Helen, demonstrates the tendency of judicial processes to not act upon the whole truth. When compared with the historical record, dominated by the stories in the Odyssey, the conclusion, as one academic states, is that the concepts of justice and penalties are established by [...] "who has the power to say who is punished, whose ideas count", and that [...] "justice is underwritten by social inequalities and inequitable power dynamics".|$|E

2500|$|The ICD and DSM {{classification}} schemes {{have achieved}} widespread acceptance in psychiatry. A survey of 205 psychiatrists, from 66 different countries across all continents, found that ICD-10 was more frequently used and <b>more</b> <b>valued</b> in clinical practice and training, while the DSM-IV was more frequently used in clinical {{practice in the}} United States and Canada, and was <b>more</b> <b>valued</b> for research, with accessibility to either being limited, and usage by other mental health professionals, policy makers, patients and families less clear[...] A primary care (e.g. general or family physician) version of the mental disorder section of ICD-10 has been developed (ICD-10-PHC) which has also been used quite extensively internationally. A survey of journal articles indexed in various biomedical databases between 1980 and 2005 indicated that 15,743 referred to the DSM and 3,106 to the ICD.|$|E

2500|$|An {{international}} {{survey of}} psychiatrists in 66 countries comparing {{use of the}} ICD-10 and DSM-IV found that the former was more often used for clinical diagnosis while the latter was <b>more</b> <b>valued</b> for research.

2500|$|The most {{widespread}} [...] (formerly recognized) subspecies, which perhaps are now best {{thought of}} as populations with some distinct physical characteristics, are C. c. acadicus (New England beaver), C. c. canadensis (Canadian beaver), C. c. carolinensis (Carolina beaver), and C. c. missouriensis (Missouri River beaver). The Canadian beaver originally inhabited {{almost all of the}} forested area of Canada, and because of its <b>more</b> <b>valued</b> fur, was often selected for reintroductions elsewhere. The Carolina beaver is found in the southeastern United States; the Missouri River beaver, as its name suggests, is found in the Missouri River and its tributaries; and C. c. acadicus is found throughout the New England area in the northeastern United States.|$|E
2500|$|Many {{mental health}} {{professionals}} use the manual to determine and help communicate a patient's diagnosis after an evaluation; hospitals, clinics, and insurance companies in the US also generally require a DSM diagnosis for all patients treated. The DSM can be used clinically in this way, and also to categorize patients using diagnostic criteria for research purposes. Studies done on specific disorders often recruit patients whose symptoms match the criteria listed in the DSM for that disorder. An international survey of psychiatrists in 66 countries compared {{the use of the}} ICD-10 and DSM-IV; it [...] found the former was more often used for clinical diagnosis while the latter was <b>more</b> <b>valued</b> for research.|$|E

2500|$|The poem is {{generally}} <b>more</b> <b>valued</b> by historians than by literary criticsit has been thought to lack elegance and wit, and it strangely includes elements of choral lyric {{though it is}} not a choral song but a solo performance. The choral elements are dactylo-epitrite meter and what seems to be triadic structure (i.e. strophe, antistrophe, epode) C.M. Bowra considered it [...] "a strange and uncomfortable poem". Another scholar saw parallels between it and Anacreon's Artemon but judged Anacreon's poem to have more grace and wit. However, scholarly analysis of the poem has not produced agreement or convincing results and much depends on how we interpret the poet's tone. The reference to Leto is obscure but she may have had some connection with Salamis or perhaps there was a temple to her at Corinth.|$|E
2500|$|Each of {{the slave}} {{categories}} was divided into two groups: vătraşi and lăieşi; the former was a sedentary category, while the latter was allowed to preserve its nomadism. The lăieşi category comprised several occupational subgroups: alongside the Kalderash (căldărari or [...] "copper workers"), Lăutari ("string instrument players"), Boyash (lingurari or [...] "spoon makers") and Ursari ("bear handlers"), all of which developed as distinct ethic subgroups, they comprised the [...] fierari ("smiths"). For {{a long period of}} time, the Roma were the only smiths and ironmongers in Wallachia and Moldavia. Among the fierari, the <b>more</b> <b>valued</b> were the specialized potcovari ("farriers"). Women owned by the boyars were often employed as housemaids in service to the boyaresses, and both them and some of the enslaved men could be assigned administrative tasks within the manor. From early on in the history of slavery in Romania, many other slaves were made to work in the salt mines.|$|E
2500|$|The cunning folk {{were also}} {{commonly}} employed to locate missing or stolen property and uncover the perpetrator: this was {{of particular importance}} throughout the Early Modern period, when peoples' possessions were far <b>more</b> <b>valued</b> than in later centuries as they were expensive to replace, particularly for the poor. There are recorded cases where the cunning folk would also promise {{to ensure that the}} stolen property was returned, and in some of these they did prove successful, with the thief promptly returning what they had taken, something which may have been out of their own fear of being cursed by the cunning folk. At times, such cunning individuals were also known to locate missing persons: an example of this was reported in 1617, as John Redman of Sutton discovered that his wife had left him, and [...] "went from wizard to wizard, or, as they term them 'wise men', to have them bring her again".|$|E

30|$|Due to {{the fierce}} {{competition}} among supply chains in today’s market, creating <b>more</b> <b>value</b> via improving supply chain performance determines competitive advantage for a firm over its competitors. Hence, evaluating supply chain performance with focus on creation of <b>more</b> <b>value</b> {{is an essential}} issue in supply chain management. Some authors mentioned that companies can use balanced scorecard approach, including customer, financial, internal business and, learning and innovation perspectives, to evaluate supply chain performance and to consequently obtain value-adding products and services (Martinsons et al. 1999). Components of BSC approach can help companies to create <b>more</b> <b>value</b> to their stakeholders. For an instance, customer perspective is external clients and affects on society. Internal business perspective consists of processes, which enable the organization to create value for its customer and to reach its financial goals (Hongxia and Zhipeng 2007). The proposed framework develops BSC approach with focus on effective metrics to evaluate supply chain performance comprehensively for gaining <b>more</b> <b>value.</b>|$|R
