40|$|Microsatellite {{instability}} (MSI) {{is a form}} {{of genetic}} instability that results from defects in DNA mismatch repair. MSI is reported to be rare in unselected breast cancers, however it is a common feature in subsets of colorectal, ovarian and endometrial cancers. In these anatomical sites, MSI-high carcinomas often display a mucinous histology. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine whether <b>mucinous</b> <b>carcinomas</b> of the breast would more frequently display MSI-high than invasive ductal carcinomas of no special type (IDC-NSTs). The expression of four MSI markers (i. e. MSH 2, MSH 6, MLH 1 and PMS 2) was immunohistochemically assessed in 35 <b>mucinous</b> breast <b>carcinomas</b> and 35 histological grade- and oestrogen receptor (ER) status-matched IDC-NSTs, and in a series of 245 invasive breast cancers. Cases were considered as potentially MSI-high if tumour cells lacked expression of at least two MSI markers and internal controls displayed nuclear staining. Nine <b>mucinous</b> <b>carcinomas</b> were microdissected and subjected to MSI analysis by PCR using the MSI markers BAT 26 and BAT 40. No immunohistochemical evidence of MSI-high was found in the 35 <b>mucinous</b> <b>carcinomas</b> and 35 grade- and ER-matched IDC-NSTs, and in the cohort of 245 invasive breast cancers. In addition, no evidence of MSI-high was observed by PCR analysis using the BAT 26 and BAT 40 markers in the nine <b>mucinous</b> <b>carcinomas</b> tested.

40|$|Background: The {{biological}} {{behavior of}} signet-ring cell carcinomas in colorectum tends tobeworse than thatofmucinous carcinomas. However, inprevious studies, clinicopatho-logical {{features of this}} disease have been somewhat ill-defined because various histological criteria of thisdisease were adopted. Methods: We selected 11 cases of signet-ring cell carcinomas and 29 cases of <b>mucinous</b> <b>carcinomas</b> among 1595 consecutive colorectal carcinomas ondefined criteria and compared clinicopathological and molecular biological features between these twotypes ofcarcinomas. Results: Clinical stagings of signet-ring cell carcinomas were far advanced and their prognosis tended to be worse than that of <b>mucinous</b> <b>carcinomas.</b> Furthermore, the incidence of K-ras mutations in signet-ring cell and <b>mucinous</b> <b>carcinomas</b> showed no {{difference between these two}} types of carcinomas.

40|$|Background <b>Mucinous</b> <b>carcinoma</b> of {{the breast}} is an {{indolent}} tumors with a favorable prognosis; however, micropapillary features tend to lead to aggressive behavior. Thus, <b>mucinous</b> <b>carcinoma</b> and micropapillary carcinoma exhibit contrasting biologic behaviors. Here, we review invasive <b>mucinous</b> <b>carcinoma</b> {{with a focus on}} micropapillary features and correlations with clinicopathological factors. Methods A total of 64 patients with invasive breast cancer with mucinous or micropapillary features were enrolled in the study. Of 36 pure mucinous carcinomas, 17 (47. 2 %) had micropapillary features and were termed <b>mucinous</b> <b>carcinoma</b> with micropapillary features (MUMPC), and 19 (52. 8 %) had no micropapillary features and were termed <b>mucinous</b> <b>carcinoma</b> without micropapillary features. MUMPC were compared with 15 invasive micropapillary carcinomas (IMPC) and 13 invasive ductal and micropapillary carcinomas (IDMPC). Results The clinicopathological factors of pure <b>mucinous</b> <b>carcinoma</b> and MUMPC were not significantly different. In contrast to IMPC and IDMPC, MUMPC had a low nuclear grade, lower mitotic rate, higher expression of hormone receptors, negative human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER 2) status, lower Ki- 67 proliferating index, and less frequent lymph node metastasis (p <. 05). According to univariate analyses, progesterone receptor, HER 2, T-stage, and lymph node metastasis were significant risk factors for overall survival; however, only T-stage remained significant in a multivariate analysis (p <. 05). Conclusions In contrast to IMPC and IDMPC, the micropapillary pattern in <b>mucinous</b> <b>carcinoma</b> does not contribute to aggressive behavior.

40|$|To {{study the}} fine needle {{aspiration}} cytology (FNAC) features of mucocelelike lesion (MLL) {{of the breast}} and to compare them to those of <b>mucinous</b> <b>carcinoma.</b> STUDY DESIGN: The fine needle aspiration (FNA) smears of 7 cases of histologically proven MLL (2 malignant and 5 benign, including 4 associated with atypical ductal hyperplasia) were reviewed and compared to those of 14 <b>mucinous</b> <b>carcinoma</b> cases. RESULTS: In all cases, grossly visible thick, mucoid material was obtained from FNA. The most important features for distinguishing benign MLL from <b>mucinous</b> <b>carcinoma</b> were: (1) scant cellularity; (2) no or rare single, intact tumor cells; (3) tumor cells arranged in cohesive monolayers; and (4) absence of significant nuclear atypia. In contrast, <b>mucinous</b> <b>carcinoma</b> in general showed higher cellularity; abundant single, intact cells; three-dimensional cellular clusters in most cases; and nuclear atypia ranging from mild to severe.

40|$|Mucins {{are heavily}} O-glycosylated {{proteins}} where the glycosylation {{has been shown}} {{to play an important role}} in cancer. Normal epithelial ovarian cells do not express secreted mucins, but their abnormal expression has previously been described in epithelial ovarian cancer and may relate to tumor formation and progression. The cyst fluids were shown to be a rich source for acidic glycoproteins. The study of these proteins can potentially lead to the identification of more effective biomarkers for ovarian cancer. In this study, we analyzed the expression of the MUC 5 AC and the O-glycosylation of acidic glycoproteins secreted into ovarian cyst fluids. The samples were obtained from patients with serous and mucinous ovarian tumors of different stages (benign, borderline, malignant) and grades. The O-linked oligosaccharides were released and analyzed by negative-ion graphitized carbon Liquid Chromatography (LC) coupled to Electrospray Ionization tandem Mass Spectrometry (ESI-MSn). The LC-ESI-MSn of the oligosaccharides from ovarian cyst fluids displayed differences in expression of fucose containing structures such as blood group ABO antigens and Lewis-type epitopes. The obtained data showed that serous and mucinous benign adenomas, mucinous low malignant potential carcinomas (LMPs, borderline) and <b>mucinous</b> low-grade <b>carcinomas</b> have a high level of blood groups and Lewis type epitopes. In contrast, this type of fucosylated structures were low abundant in the high-grade <b>mucinous</b> <b>carcinomas</b> or in serous carcinomas. In addition, the ovarian tumors that showed a high level of expression of blood group antigens also revealed a strong reactivity towards the MUC 5 AC antibody. To visualize the differences between serous and mucinous ovarian tumors based on the O-glycosylation, a hierarchical cluster analysis was performed using mass spectrometry average compositions (MSAC).

40|$|Approximately 10 % of all {{colorectal}} <b>carcinomas</b> are <b>mucinous</b> <b>carcinomas,</b> {{characterized by}} extracellular mucin. Occasionally, mucin accumulates intracellularly in these tumours, causing signet ring cell differentiation. We hypothesized that signet ring cells arise from a separate genetic pathway. In this study the molecular background of signet ring cell differentiation was investigated by analysing genetic changes, {{changes in the}} expression of adhesion molecules, and mucin content. Furthermore, its clinical relevance was addressed. Cell lines of colorectal tumours with non-mucinous (AC), mucinous (MC), and signet ring cell phenotype (MCSRC) were used for Multiplex Ligation-dependent Probe Amplification to detect deletions and amplifications in specific oncogenes and tumour suppressor genes. Furthermore, the expression of E-cadherin, beta-catenin, ITF (intestinal trefoil factor), and MUC 2 in signet ring cells was studied by immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence, and mRNA in situ hybridization. Results were validated using a large cohort of rectal carcinomas from which clinicopathological data were available. Specific amplifications and deletions in cell lines of AC, MC, and MCSRC were detected. Bcl- 2 was amplified in MCSRC and MC cell lines, but not in AC cell lines. Bcl- 2 FISH analysis confirmed this in patient material. Signet ring cells had decreased expression of adhesion molecules (E-cadherin, beta-catenin) and were strongly positive for ITF and MUC 2, two peptides which are normally only produced by goblet cells. RNA in situ hybridization confirmed the production of ITF. <b>Mucinous</b> <b>carcinomas</b> with signet ring cell differentiation presented at a higher T stage than adenocarcinomas and <b>mucinous</b> <b>carcinomas</b> (16 % pT 4 versus 3 - 5 %, p< 0. 001) and were more frequently node positive (77 % vs 39 - 44 %; p< 0. 001).

Two hundred seventy-six patients with 277 lesions, including 15 mucinous carcinomas (13 pure type, two mixed type), 204 other malignant tumors, and 58 benign lesions, were examined with 1. 5 -T MRI at b values of 0 and 1, 500 s/mm 2. The correlations between cellularity and ADC, homogeneity of signal intensity on diffusion-weighted images, and histopathologic findings were analyzed. The difference was statistically significant (p < 0. 05). Results. The mean ADC of <b>mucinous</b> <b>carcinoma</b> (1. 8 ± 0. 4 × 10 - 3 mm 2 /s) was statistically higher than that of benign lesions (1. 3 ± 0. 3 × 10 - 3 mm 2 /s) and other malignant tumors (0. 9 ± 0. 2 × 10 - 3 mm 2 /s) (p 0. 05). The correlation between mean cellularity and the ADC of <b>mucinous</b> <b>carcinoma</b> was significant (ρs = - 0. 754; p = 0. 001).

50|$|In {{the case}} of the ovarian cancer, {{transcripts}} for two of the three mPRs, α and β, were differentially expressed in ovarian cystadenomas, borderline tumors, and carcinomas: while mPRα is expressed at significantly higher levels than the others, an increased expression of mPRβ has been noticed in <b>mucinous</b> <b>carcinomas</b> when compared to the other tumor types and normal tissues. Notably, the expression of mPRγ was significantly higher in endometrioid and clear cell carcinomas, which are closely related tumors. In one study, an increase in progesterone was shown to coincide with a reduced level of mPRγ and concomitant increase in the mPRα transcript levels.|$|R
