500|$|Skagen lies along Danish {{national}} road 40, {{also known}} as Frederikshavnsvej, which connects the town to Frederikshavn, via Ålbæk to the southeast. The stretch of the road between Skagen and Ålbæk was asphalted in 1932. Hirtshals {{on the western side}} of the peninsula can be reached by taking Road 597 from Ålbæk. The Bøjlevejen road is the main skirt road around the town to the north, along which lies the Skagen Odde Nature Centre. In the peak season during the summer months, Skagen can become congested with traffic. [...] Free parking facilities are provided for short periods, and there is also a metered car park near the train station. As in other Danish cities, cycling is popular, and Skagen Cykeludlejning, {{to the west of the}} train station, and Pedersen on Kappelborgvej rent out bikes to tourists. There are a number of interesting <b>marked</b> <b>cycle</b> routes in and around Skagen. These include circuits for mountain bikes.|$|E

50|$|Seven bit {{characters}} have {{the alternative to}} be sent erect, meaning that 0 stays as 0 and 1 stays as 1, or inverted where each 0 changes to 1 and 1 changes to 0. The standard specifies a marking pattern which says which characters are erect and which are inverted in a particular pattern, that enables the system phase, channel and subchannel to be determined. Since the system is synchronous there is no start bit, and a receiver has to examine the bit stream to tell where {{the start of a}} <b>marked</b> <b>cycle</b> is. When system phase is established the correct received bit can be assigned to the correct place in each character in each channel. The receiver can determine that system phase is established as each character will contain three one bits and four zero bits. In recommendation 342-2 here are two different marking lengths schemes. For the four character repetition cycle, Channel A is encoded ↓↑↑↑ (4333) and channel B is marked ↑↓↓↓ (3444). These are combined in a time division multiplex method with characters in the order A1 B4 A2 B1 A3 B2 A4 B3 resulting in a marking pattern ↓↓↑↑↑↓↑↓ (44333434 one bits) to match the first character from channel A at the start.|$|E
30|$|The {{test was}} carried out as a field study with twelve {{participants}} being passengers in an instrumented car. The test route included nine cycle crossings, that all were combined with pedestrian crossings. The participants individually pushed a noiseless button when they saw a dummy bicyclist standing still at a crossing, in part one, and when they saw a correctly <b>marked</b> <b>cycle</b> crossing in part two. Visibility distances to bicyclist dummies and cycle crossings were measured. Half of the participants experienced dry road surface {{and the other half}} wet road surface. An analysis of variance was conducted with a split plot design of group (wet / dry road surface) × target (bicyclist dummy / cycle crossing) × crossing (9 different cycle crossings).|$|E
40|$|Abstract. We {{describe}} a synchronous distributed algorithm which identifies the edge-biconnected {{components of a}} connected network. It requires a leader, and uses messages of size O(log |V |). The main idea is to preorder a BFS spanning tree, and then to efficiently compute least common ancestors so as to <b>mark</b> <b>cycle</b> edges. This algorithm takes O(Diam) time and uses O(|E|) messages. Furthermore, we show that no correct singly-initiated edge-biconnectivity algorithm can beat either bound on any graph {{by more than a}} constant factor. We also {{describe a}} near-optimal local algorithm for edge-biconnectivity. 1...|$|R

40|$|A {{description}} is given of cells termed lipo-protein {{cells in the}} blood of Carcinus maenas, and of their development from amoebocytes. These cells exhibit a <b>marked</b> <b>cycle</b> of appearance and disappearance correlated with the moult. They appear {{towards the end of the}} instar, reach their maximum development immediately before the epicuticle of the new cuticle is secreted, and disappear soon after the moult. They show positive reactions for the presence of lipids, aromatic substances, tyrosine, and peptide linkages. As the epicuticle and pre-exuvial endocuticle are secreted, the colouring with Sudan black B and the Millon reaction in the cells decrease in intensity. The cells are believed to synthesize lipo-protein or extract it from the haemolymph, and to transport it to the epidermis and thence to the developing cuticle, thus contributing to the secretion of the epicuticle and impregnating the pre-exuvial endocuticle. The lipo-protein cells are compared with the oenocytes of insects and with the granulo-cytes and vacuolar cells or leberidocytes of spiders...|$|E
40|$|Phytoplankton carbon {{assimilation}} {{has been}} measured near monthly using the 14 C method at DYFAMED France JGOFS time-series station from 1993 to 1999. Data were obtained using the "LET GO" technique, which allowed in situ injection of bicarbonate and incubation in enclosures at 10 depths. Incubation duration was 4 h around noon, from which daily production was estimated. The seasonal {{variation of the}} depth-integrated carbon assimilation exhibits a <b>marked</b> <b>cycle.</b> Maximum values reach 1. 8 g C/m** 2 /d in March or April; constant lower values were observed from August to January, in the range 100 - 300 mg C/m** 2 /d. The annual primary production vary in the range 86 - 232 g C/m** 2 /yr, in the upper range of older estimations. Primary production normalized to chlorophyll a shows maximum values {{in the period of}} oligotrophy. This increase of carbon assimilation rate per unit of chlorophyll a appears as linked to the period of phosphorus-limited ecosystem, and vertical distribution of taxonomic pigments suggests a possible role of cyanobacteria. Potential export production has been estimated from primary production data and Fp ratio based on pigments concentrations. These estimates (which imply biological steady state conditions) vary in a wide range, from 19 to 71 g C/m** 2 /yr. There is a decoupling between years with high potential export production and years with high measured particulate fluxes, which highlights the question of balance by resupply of the limiting nutrients and the role of dissolved organic carbon. A possible shift of primary production towards a more regeneration-dominated system is suggested for recent years...|$|E

25|$|There {{are still}} some {{conditions}} for cyclists in Ljubljana that have been criticized as unfortunate to date. This refers to cycle lanes in poor condition and constructed {{in a way that}} motorized traffic is privileged. In contrast to other European capitals, on some of the main streets cycling is forbidden; for example, on part of Slovenska cesta (Slovene Street) and on a new link road on the Fabiani Bridge across the Ljubljanica River connecting Hrvatski trg and Roška cesta. There are also many one-way streets which therefore cannot be used as alternate routes so it is difficult to legally travel by bicycle through the city center. Through years, some prohibitions have been partially abolished by <b>marking</b> <b>cycle</b> lanes on the pavement. Nevertheless, the situation has been steadily improving; in 2015, Ljubljana placed 13th in a ranking of the world's most bicycle-friendly cities.|$|R

40|$|I {{develop a}} {{formalism}} for solving topological field theories explicitly, {{in the case}} when the explicit expression of the instantons is known. I solve topological Yang-Mills theory with the k = 1 Belavin et al. instanton and topological gravity with the Eguchi-Hanson instanton. It turns out that naively empty theories are indeed nontrivial. Many unexpected interesting hidden quantities (punctures, contact terms, nonperturbative anomalies with or without gravity) are revealed. Topological Yang-Mills theory with G = SU(2) is not just Donaldson theory, but contains a certain link theory. Indeed, local and nonlocal observables have the property of <b>marking</b> <b>cycles.</b> Moreover, from topological gravity one learns that an object can be considered BRST exact {{only if it is}} so all over the moduli space M, boundary included. Being BRST exact in any interior point of M is not sufficient to make an amplitude vanish. Presumably, recursion relations and hierarchies can be found to solve topological field theories in four dimensions, in particular topological Yang-Mills theory with G = SU(2) on R 4 and topological gravity with the full set of asymptotically locally Euclidean manifolds. 1...|$|R
