5|$|The use of fast horse-drawn coaches, {{known as}} 'Flying Coaches', began in 1669. Travelling between London and Oxford by coach had {{involved}} an overnight stay at Beaconsfield, but Oxford University organised {{a project to}} allow completion of the journey between sunrise and sunset. The project succeeded, and was quickly copied by Cambridge University; {{by the end of}} Charles II's reign, in 1685, Flying Coaches ran three times a week from London to all major towns, in good conditions covering a distance of around fifty miles in a day. The Thoroughbred horse was developed from about this time, with native mares being crossbred to Arab, Turk and Barb horses to produce excellent racehorses; the General Stud Book, giving clear and detailed pedigrees, was first published in the 1790s, and the lineage of today's Thoroughbred horses can be traced with great accuracy to 1791. Horses running in races sponsored by the monarchy then carried weights of around , <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>usual</b> weight of 8–10stone (51–64kg), indicating that horse racing, hunting and chasing partly originated in a need for military training.|$|E
5|$|White House Counsel Fred Fielding {{immediately}} {{prepared for}} a transfer of presidential powers under the 25th Amendment, and Chief of Staff James A. Baker and Counselor to the President Edwin Meese went to Reagan's hospital still believing {{that the president was}} unharmed. Within five minutes of the shooting, members of the Cabinet began gathering in the White House Situation Room. Haig, Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger and National Security Advisor Richard Allen discussed various issues, including the location of the nuclear football, the apparent presence of <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>usual</b> number of Soviet submarines unusually close off the Atlantic coast, a possible Soviet invasion of Poland against the Solidarity movement, and the presidential line of succession. Although normally no tape recorders are allowed in the Situation Room these meetings were recorded with the participants' knowledge by Allen, and the tapes have since been made public.|$|E

25|$|Most of Paolo's {{music was}} {{published}} in modern editions in the 1970s, making it easily available, {{and as a result}} he has received <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>usual</b> amount of critical attention. His music had both progressive and conservative aspects. While most of his surviving music is secular, and all of it vocal, two sacred compositions (a Benedicamus Domino for two voices, and a Gaudeamus omnes in Domino for three) have also survived. How much is lost is impossible to guess, but the 14th century saw an explosion of interest in notated secular music in Italy, and the proportional survival of his secular to sacred work may well represent the actual trend.|$|E
25|$|It is not {{unreasonable}} but also not necessary to conclude that Marcellus was a practicing physician. In his dissertation, the intellectual historian of magic and medicine Lynn Thorndike pronounced him the “court physician” of Theodosius I, but the evidence is thin: Libanius, if referring to this Marcellus, praises his ability to cure a headache. The prevailing view is that Marcellus should be categorized as a medical writer and not a physician. A translator of the medical writings of Isidore of Seville characterizes Marcellus as a “medical amateur” and dismisses the De medicamentis as “nothing <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>usual</b> ancient home remedies,” and the historian of botany Ernst Meyer seems to have considered him a dilettante.|$|E

25|$|The early labyrinthodonts {{are known}} from the Devonian and {{possibly}} extending into the Romer's Gap of the early Carboniferous. These labyrinthodonts are often grouped together as the order Ichthyostegalia, though the group is an evolutionary grade rather than a clade. Ichthyostegalians were predominantly aquatic and most show evidence of functional internal gills throughout life, and probably only occasionally ventured onto land. Their polydactylous feet had <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>usual</b> five digits for tetrapods and were paddle-like. The tail bore true fin rays like those found in fish. The vertebrae were complex and rather weak. At {{the close of the}} Devonian, forms with progressively stronger legs and vertebrae evolved, and the later groups lacked functional gills as adults. All were however predominantly aquatic and some spent all or nearly all their lives in water.|$|E

500|$|In 1894 Wood {{went to the}} Wagner festival at Bayreuth {{where he}} met the {{conductor}} Felix Mottl, who subsequently appointed him as his assistant and chorus master {{for a series of}} Wagner concerts at the newly built Queen's Hall in London. The manager of the hall, Robert Newman, was proposing to run a ten-week season of promenade concerts and, impressed by Wood, invited him to conduct. There had been such concerts in London since 1838, under conductors from Louis Antoine Jullien to Arthur Sullivan. Sullivan's concerts in the 1870s had been particularly successful, because he offered his audiences something <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>usual</b> light music. He introduced major classical works, such as Beethoven symphonies, normally restricted to the more expensive concerts presented by the Philharmonic Society and others.

500|$|Coolbrith {{began to}} write a history of California literature, {{including}} much autobiographical material, but the fire following the 1906 San Francisco earthquake consumed her work. Author Gertrude Atherton and Coolbrith's Bohemian Club friends helped set her up again in a new house, and she resumed writing and holding literary salons. She traveled by train to New York City several times and, with fewer worldly cares, greatly increased her poetry output. On June 30, 1915, Coolbrith was named California's poet laureate, and she continued to write poetry for eight more years. Her style was <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>usual</b> melancholic or uplifting themes expected of women—she included {{a wide variety of}} subjects in her poems, which were noted as being [...] "singularly sympathetic" [...] and [...] "palpably spontaneous".
