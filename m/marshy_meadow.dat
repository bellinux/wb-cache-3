On the morning of 13 September 1890, about 10:00, the officers and men of the Pioneer Column paraded atop the kopje before an improvised flagstaff.

60|$|But John de Vere, Earl of Oxford, cool, {{wise and}} crafty in war, saw and seized his chance. On the right flank a <b>marshy</b> <b>meadow</b> skirted the river. So soft {{was it that}} a heavily-armed man would sink to his knees. At his order a spray of light bowmen was thrown out from the battle line and forming upon the flank of the French poured their arrows into them. At the same moment Chandos, with Audley, Nigel, Bartholomew Burghersh, the Captal de Buch, and a score of other knights sprang upon their horses, and {{charging}} down the narrow lane rode over the French line in front of them.

60|$|His eyes rested as {{he thought}} of these things upon the {{familiar}} purple hill crests, patched that afternoon with the lingering traces of a recent snowstorm, the heather slopes, the dark mysterious woods, the patches of vivid green where a damp and <b>marshy</b> <b>meadow</b> or so broke the moorland surface. To-day {{in spite of the}} sun there was a bright blue-white line of frost to the northward of every hedge and bank, the trees were dripping down the white edgings of the morning into the pine-needle mud at their feet; he had seen it so like this before; years hence he might see it all like this again; all this great breezy countryside had taken upon itself a quality of endurance, as though it would still be real and essential in his mind when Lady Harman had altogether passed again. It would be real when he himself had passed away, and in other costumes and other vehicles fresh Euphemias and new crude George Brumleys would come along, feeling in the ultimate bright new wisdom of youth that it was all for them--a subservient scenery, when really it was entirely indifferent in its careless permanence to all their hopes and fancies....|$|E
6000|$|Adding Andrew's {{information}} to what I had myself observed, I could scarce doubt that some attack was meditated upon our party. The road, as we advanced, seemed to afford every facility {{for such an}} unpleasant interruption. At first it winded apart from the lake through <b>marshy</b> <b>meadow</b> ground, overgrown with copsewood, now traversing dark and close thickets which would have admitted an ambuscade to be sheltered within a few yards of our line of march, and frequently crossing rough mountain torrents, some of which took the soldiers up to the knees, and ran with such violence, that their force could only be stemmed by the strength {{of two or three}} men holding fast by each other's arms. It certainly appeared to me, though altogether unacquainted with military affairs, that a sort of half-savage warriors, as I had heard the Highlanders asserted to be, might, in such passes as these, attack a party of regular forces with great advantage. The Bailie's good sense and shrewd observation had led him to the same conclusion, as I understood from his requesting to speak with the captain, whom he addressed nearly in the following terms:-- [...] "Captain, it's no to fleech ony favour out o' ye, for I scorn it--and it's under protest that I reserve my action and pleas of oppression and wrongous imprisonment;--but, being a friend to King George and his army, I take the liberty to speer--Dinna ye think ye might tak a better time to gang up this glen? If ye are seeking Rob Roy, he's ken'd to be better than half a hunder men strong when he's at the fewest; an if he brings in the Glengyle folk, and the Glenfinlas and Balquhidder lads, he may come to gie you your kail through the reek; and it's my sincere advice, as a king's friend, ye had better tak back again to the Clachan, for thae women at Aberfoil are like the scarts and seamaws at the Cumries--there's aye foul weather follows their skirting." ...|$|E

5000|$|The {{approximate}} {{meaning of}} the name is not in doubt, but {{there is room for}} debate about the precise derivation and its connotations. Brewer gives the commonly accepted explanation that it comes from the Old English words irre ("wandering") and wisce ("wet meadow"). This is accepted by Cameron, a leading place name expert, and a Derbyshire specialist, who interprets the name as [...] "wandering, marshy river". Gelling, who specialises in seeking precise topgraphical equivalents for toponymic elements, confirms that wisce signifies a <b>marshy</b> <b>meadow</b> but gives only southern examples. She conjectures that there is an element, wæsse, perhaps Old English, that signifies very specifically [...] "land by a meandering river which floods and drains quickly", and her examples are primarily Midland and northern. This seems to fit the Erewash perfectly. A good example of the meandering character of the river will be seen around Gallows Inn Playing Fields, Ilkeston, where rapid flooding and draining occur frequently. As she meanders through Toton and Long Eaton the river crosses Manor Park which has the Norfolk Brook running adjacent to it. When there has been prolonged rain fall the two waters are prone to burst their banks and meet over the football pitches and the cricket pitch.The name is pronounced locally as 'Erry-wash'.|$|E

40|$|Studies on {{flowering}} of Hierochloë repens were performed {{over the years}} 2005 - 2007 in five habitats located in Bydgoszcz. The first habitat is a degenerated fresh ryegrass meadow (Arrhenatheretum elatioris). Another one is a degenerated form of initial xerothermic swards (Tunico - Poetum compressae). The third habitat in which the occurrence of Hierochloë repens was found and flowering was analyzed is sandy sward (Koelerio - Corynephoretea).

Differences were found in the structure of Hierochloë repens inflorescence in the habitats analyzed.
