When he {{reached the end of}} the log he suddenly dropped his tail, stretched himself to his full height and his wings began to beat, first slowly then faster and faster, until they were just a blur. They seemed to touch above his back but when they came down they didn't quite strike his sides. It was those fast <b>moving</b> <b>wings</b> that made the thunder. It was so loud that Peter almost wanted to stop his ears. When it ended Strutter settled down to rest and once more appeared like a ball of fluffy feathers. His ruff was laid flat.|$|E

50|$|In 1962-1963, Sukhoi {{initially}} set out {{to build}} an aircraft without the complexity of <b>moving</b> <b>wings</b> like the F-111.

50|$|Starting in airshows and barnstorming {{during the}} 1920s, wing walking is {{the act of}} <b>moving</b> on the <b>wings</b> of an {{airplane}} during flight.|$|R
500|$|Generally {{one wants}} to have the wing's centre of {{pressure}} (CP, or [...] "lift point") close to the aircraft's centre of gravity (CG, or [...] "balance point") {{to reduce the amount}} of control force required to pitch the aircraft. As the aircraft layout changes during the design phase, it is common for the CG to move fore or aft. With a normal wing design this can be addressed by <b>moving</b> the <b>wing</b> slightly fore or aft to account for this. With a delta wing running most of the length of the fuselage, this was no longer easy; <b>moving</b> the <b>wing</b> would leave it in front of the nose or behind the tail. Studying the various layouts in terms of CG changes, both during design and changes due to fuel use during flight, the ogee planform immediately came to the fore.|$|R

5000|$|Mating {{takes place}} in a way that for the genus Calopteryx and is typical of an {{eye-catching}} advertising behavior precedes. The females fly over the water, always in search of suitable nesting places and fly it through the territories of males. The males who recognize the females to the reflections of the <b>moving</b> <b>wings,</b> fly towards it, once they have crossed the border area. They use a striking Schwirrflug that only in the courtship will be shown, and demonstrate the underside of its abdomen raised high. The last three segments of it are much brighter and are referred to as a [...] "lantern" [...] that will be presented. The male leads in this way, the female to the nesting sites ("Show flight") and circled it on the water once it has settled out. Then in turn followed by a period of Schwirrflugs and only if the female is sitting there and so his willingness to mate signaled it comes to mating. In return, the male is on the wings of the female and begins copulation, which can last between 40 seconds and 5 minutes, the animals themselves as Paarungsrad can rely on the vegetation.After mating, the male releases the female again and again shows this is the nesting place, the female abdomen with drooping sit for a few seconds ("post-copulatory rest") and then follows the male. The eggs are laid in the stems of aquatic plants in the water level and below, where the female can submerge up to 90 minutes. It climbs here (unlike almost all other species of dragonflies) upside down on the stem down and stabs the eggs with the egg-laying apparatus ( [...] ovipositor [...] ) almost vertically into the stems. During the nesting above the water surface while the female is the male defended against other males. Both sexes mate several times a day for several weeks until her death.|$|E

5|$|Bats are {{the only}} mammals that can truly fly. They fly through the air at a {{constant}} speed by <b>moving</b> their <b>wings</b> up and down (usually with some fore-aft movement as well). Because the animal is in motion, there is some airflow relative to its body which, combined with the velocity of the wings, generates a faster airflow <b>moving</b> over the <b>wing.</b> This generates a lift force vector pointing forwards and upwards, and a drag force vector pointing rearwards and upwards. The upwards components of these counteract gravity, keeping {{the body in the}} air, while the forward component provides thrust to counteract both the drag from the wing and from the body as a whole.|$|R
40|$|An {{experimental}} {{investigation into}} the physical phenomena associated with limit cycle wing rock on slender delta wings has been conducted. The model used was a slender flat plate delta wing with 80 -deg leading edge sweep. The investigation concentrated on three main areas: motion characteristics obtained from time history plots, static and dynamic flow visualization of vortex position, and static and dynamic flow visualization of vortex breakdown. The flow visualization studies are correlated with model motion to determine the relationship between vortex position and vortex breakdown with the dynamic rolling moments. Dynamic roll moment coefficient curves reveal rate-dependent hysteresis, which drives the motion. Vortex position correlated with time and model motion show a time lag in the normal position of the upward <b>moving</b> <b>wing</b> vortex. This time lag may be the mechanism responsible for the hysteresis. Vortex breakdown is shown to have a damping effect on the motion...|$|R
40|$|Under the Direction of Biswanath Samanta) In {{theme park}} based {{entertainment}} applications, {{there is a}} need for interactive, autonomous animatronic systems to create engaging and compelling experiences for the guests. The animatronic figures must identify the guests and recognize their status in dynamic interactions for enhanced acceptance and effectiveness as socially interactive agents, in the general framework of human-robot interactions. The design and implementation of an interactive, autonomous animatronic system in form of a tabletop dragon and the comparisons of guest responses in its passive and interactive modes are presented in this work. The dragon capabilities include a four degrees-of-freedom head, <b>moving</b> <b>wings,</b> tail, jaw, blinking eyes and sound effects. Human identification, using a depth camera (Carmine from PrimeSense), an open-source middleware (NITE from OpenNI), Java-based Processing and an Arduino microcontroller, has been implemented into the system in order to track a guest or guests, within the field of view of the camera.

40|$|The ear of the noctuid moth {{has only}} two {{auditory}} neurons, A 1 and A 2, which function in detecting predatory bats. However, the noctuid’s ears are located on the thorax behind the wings. Therefore, since these moths need to hear during flight, {{it was hypothesized that}} wing position may affect their hearing. The wing was fixed in three different positions: up, flat, and down. An additional subset of animals was measured with freely <b>moving</b> <b>wings.</b> In order to negate any possible acoustic shadowing or diffractive effects, all wings were snipped, leaving the proximal most portion and the wing hinge intact. Results revealed that wing position plays a factor in threshold sensitivity of the less sensitive auditory neuron A 2, but not in the more sensitive neuron A 1. Furthermore, when the wing was set in the down position, fewer A 1 action potentials were generated prior to the initiation of A 2 activity. Analyzing the motion of the tympanal membrane did not reveal differences in movement due to wing position. Therefore, these neural differences due to wing position are proposed to be due to other factors within the animal such as different muscle tensions...|$|E
40|$|Proprioceptive {{feedback}} from the <b>moving</b> <b>wings</b> of locusts contains information which could be sufficient for {{the control of the}} timing of the wing-muscle contractions. It has been found, however, that at the high frequency of limb movement used in flight this phasic information content is lost in the ganglionic transfer (Wilson & Gettrup, 1963). During rapid running the legs of cockroaches also oscillate at high frequencies, sometimes as rapidly as wing movements of similar-sized animals. It is therefore necessary to know whether the frequency response capabilities of the leg reflexes are similar to or {{different from those of the}} wings in order to understand how the legs are coordinated. If the leg reflexes are limited to the same range as that available to the wing reflexes, then coordination of the legs would necessarily depend upon ganglionic phasing mechanisms; that is, the elementary pattern of leg movements could be due to central nervous control alone, as is true of the locust wing control (Wilson, 1961). However, it can be shown that the phasic leg reflexes are capable of operation at frequencies even greater than those encountered in running. Apparently the significant limitation on rate of leg movement is not nervous but mechanical...|$|E
40|$|The results {{obtained}} {{from the present study}} of temperature distribution over an airplane wing afford means for making the following statements as regards the conditions of ice accretion and the use of a thermic anti-icer or de-icer: 1) Ice can form on a wing only when the temperature is below or hovering around zero. 2) The thermic effects produced on contact of the air with the <b>moving</b> <b>wing</b> rather oppose ice accretion. 3) The thermic procedure in the fight against ice accretion on the wing consists in electrical heating of the leading edge. 4) It seems that the formation of ice on the wing ought to be accompanied by a temperature rise which brings the accretion to 0 degrees. 5) If the thermic effects of friction favor the operation of the thermic anti-icer, the functioning of the de-icer is facilitated by the release of heat which accompanies the deposit of ice...|$|R

50|$|Working {{closely with}} NASA's Langley Research Center, the company {{invested}} significant Internal Research and Development (IRAD) funds for wind tunnel testing {{and that led}} to the Model 400. It featured all <b>moving</b> <b>wing</b> tips for roll control and an all moving vertical tail. These surfaces were actually the horizontal tail surfaces from the F-16A. These surfaces were later dropped as they did not provide adequate control at low speed, high angle of attack. Also, {{there would have been no}} provision for wing-tip mounted missiles. The main wing incorporated forebody strakes to enhance vortex generation for high angle of attack maneuverability, negative stability for improved subsonic lift and reduced supersonic drag. It was built around a 40-inch fuselage stretch. Both the large wing and fuselage stretch yielded a dramatic increase in range at all speeds. In 1979, with a strong positive response by the USAF, GD released the Model 400 for a company funded preliminary design effort.|$|R
