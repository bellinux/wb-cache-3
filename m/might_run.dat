5|$|Some Russian nationalists, such as Dmitry Rogozin and the Movement Against Illegal Immigration, {{stated that}} they would like to see Lukashenko become President of Russia in 2008. Lukashenko responded that he would not run for the Russian presidency, but that if his health was still good, he <b>might</b> <b>run</b> for reelection in 2011.|$|E
5|$|Although Johnson {{had focused}} the {{majority}} of his campaign activities on the New Hampshire primary, he announced on November 29, 2011 that he would no longer campaign there due to his inability to gain traction with less than a month until the primary. There was speculation in the media that he <b>might</b> <b>run</b> as a Libertarian Party candidate instead. Johnson acknowledged that he was considering such a move. In December, Politico reported that Johnson would quit the Republican primaries and announce his intention to seek the Libertarian Party nomination at a December 28 press conference. He also encouraged his supporters to vote for Ron Paul in 2012 Republican presidential primaries.|$|E
25|$|It {{was rumored}} that Schwarzenegger <b>might</b> <b>run</b> for the United States Senate in 2010, as his {{governorship}} would be term-limited by that time. This {{turned out to}} be false.|$|E

25|$|For {{several days}} after his DWI arrest and his {{admission}} of an adulterous affair and fathering an out-of-wedlock child, Fossella gave indications that he <b>might</b> <b>run</b> for re-election despite these problems. On May 20, however, {{he dropped out of}} the race.|$|E
25|$|He {{announced}} on October 16, 2009 {{that he will}} not run for re-election in 2010. When asked if he will run for another office he indicated that he is undecided, though suggested he will not run for Congress. State Senator Juan Hinojosa suggested that Shapleigh <b>might</b> <b>run</b> for governor.|$|E
25|$|Earlier in 2006, {{local media}} speculated that former mayor Jim Gordon <b>might</b> <b>run</b> for mayor again as well, but in September he ended that {{speculation}} by endorsing Rodriguez; Gordon had endorsed Courtemanche in 2003. Rodriguez was also endorsed by 2003 mayoral candidate Paul Marleau, former city councillor Gerry McIntaggart and the Sudbury and District Labour Council.|$|E

25|$|Bouchard {{met with}} his {{officers}} to design the attack plan. Sir Peter Corney knew the bay from two previous visits to Monterey. They used the corvette Santa Rosa to attack since the deep draft frigate La Argentina <b>might</b> <b>run</b> aground. The frigate had to be towed by small boats and {{out of range of}} the Spanish artillery. Once it was out of range, Bouchard sent captain Sheppard to the Santa Rosa, leading two hundred soldiers, carrying firearms and lances.|$|E
25|$|England {{subsequently}} {{collapsed and}} finished all out for 159 with Warne taking a further four wickets. England {{had lost their}} final eight wickets for a mere 58 runs. When Australia commenced batting it appeared that Langer and Hayden <b>might</b> <b>run</b> away with the match, and England's frustration was compounded by the rejection {{of a number of}} creditable LBW appeals. However, Flintoff restored considerable confidence when he had Langer and (nightwatchman) Lee caught behind on successive deliveries in the 10th over. Australia finished the day at 2/48.|$|E
25|$|Michel {{claimed that}} politicisation of this manner {{is part of}} reconnecting the Union with its {{citizens}} and Wallström defended it claiming that the EU has to get more political and controversial as being {{a vital role in}} communicating the Commission. Wallström presented plans to give greater prominence to European political parties ahead of the 2009 elections and give the parties the ability to run with candidates for Commission President. There was speculation that under this scenario, if he gained backing, Barroso <b>might</b> <b>run</b> as the People's Party candidate in 2009.|$|E

25|$|Following her {{defeat in}} the European Parliament {{election}} of June 2004, 1997 presidential election candidate Dana Rosemary Scallon said that she <b>might</b> <b>run</b> as an independent candidate {{on a platform of}} opposition to the adoption of the proposed European Union constitution. She initially attempted to repeat her 1997 strategy of seeking nominations from four county councils, and approached all the county councils in the country, but was rebuffed. Shortly before the close of nominations, she turned her attention to attempting to obtain nomination by 20 members of the Oireachtas, but was similarly unsuccessful.|$|E
25|$|The Principle of {{computational}} equivalence {{has been}} criticized for being vague, unmathematical, and for not making directly verifiable predictions. It has also been criticized for being contrary to the spirit of research in mathematical logic and computational complexity theory, which seek to make fine-grained distinctions between levels of computational sophistication, and for wrongly conflating different kinds of universality property. Moreover, critics such as Ray Kurzweil have argued that it ignores the distinction between hardware and software; while two computers may be equivalent in power, it does not follow that any two programs they <b>might</b> <b>run</b> are also equivalent. Others suggest it {{is little more than a}} rechristening of the Church–Turing thesis.|$|E
25|$|Ivanov's career, {{in terms}} of his {{background}} and rise through Russia's state structures, has often been compared to Putin's, fueling speculation that Ivanov <b>might</b> <b>run</b> for president in 2008. Three months younger than Putin, Ivanov had been a student contemporary of Putin's in their hometown of Leningrad where both completed competitive specialized secondary education programs (Putin in chemistry, Ivanov in English language) before attending Leningrad State University. Both completed postgraduate studies in counterintelligence; and both joined the foreign intelligence service shortly afterward. However, according to Ivanov's recollections, he did not become acquainted with Putin during their years as students, but rather when both were assigned to work in the same foreign intelligence division in Leningrad.|$|E

25|$|The {{length of}} a game of Australian Football can vary from league to league, but is {{generally}} around 15 to 25 minutes per quarter. In the AFL, each quarter runs for 20 minutes plus time on – which makes up for time occupied in stoppages, such as when the ball goes out of bounds, injuries, goals (or behinds) being kicked, or when the umpire is setting the angle of a free kick on goal. A typical AFL quarter <b>might</b> <b>run</b> from 27 to 33 minutes, but may be even longer if, for instance, injuries cause delays. AFL breaks after {{the first and third}} quarters are six minutes, with a 20-minute break at halftime. Thus, a match with quarters averaging 30 minutes would last {{about two and a half}} hours.|$|E
25|$|The French were {{severely}} mauled by Saumarez's squadron, several French ships also running aground, but {{the wind}} prevented the British from {{taking advantage of the}} opportunity to closely engage them. Hannibal was under heavy fire from the anchored Formidable and an array of Spanish batteries and gunboats, and could not bring her guns to bear on them. The main and mizzen masts were shot away, and her casualties mounted, while attempts to pull the ship off the shoal failed. The British force had suffered considerable damage to sails, masts and rigging, and in the light breeze, Saumarez saw there was the danger that the remainder of his ships <b>might</b> <b>run</b> aground like the Hannibal. At 13:35 he ordered his squadron to withdraw to Gibraltar, leaving the damaged Hannibal behind. Ferris ordered the survivors of his crew below decks to escape the worst of the fire as the combined guns of the French and Spanish forces turned on the last remaining target. He held out until 14:00, when seeing that further resistance would be futile, he ordered the colours struck, and the Hannibals ensign came down.|$|E
500|$|In December 2010, Gravel praised WikiLeaks, in {{the news}} during the year for the Afghan War {{documents}} leak, Iraq War documents leak, and United States diplomatic cables leak, as the [...] "most significant effort to save democracy (which is slowly being eclipsed by the Military Industrial Complex) since {{the release of the}} Pentagon Papers". Gravel indicated in December 2010 that he <b>might</b> <b>run</b> for president again and possibly challenge President Obama for the Democratic nomination for the 2012 presidential election, but he did not.|$|E

5000|$|In 2011, when he <b>might</b> have <b>run</b> {{again in}} Hull-Aylmer, {{when he and}} Nycole Turmel started having talks and he learned she might be {{interested}} in running, he decided not to run [...] "because she is a fantastic person and candidate, and I just had a baby." ...|$|R
500|$|After again {{considering}} a candidacy for the 1988 presidential election, influenced by his personal difficulties and family concerns, and content with {{remaining in the}} Senate, in December 1985 Kennedy publicly cut short any talk that he <b>might</b> <b>run.</b> [...] He added: [...] "I know this decision means I may never be president. But {{the pursuit of the}} presidency is not my life. Public service is." [...] Kennedy used his legislative skills to achieve passage of the COBRA Act, which extended employer-based health benefits after leaving a job. Following the 1986 congressional elections, the Democrats regained control of the Senate and Kennedy became chair of the Labor and Public Welfare Committee. [...] By now Kennedy had become what colleague Joe Biden termed [...] "the best strategist in the Senate," [...] who always knew when best to move legislation. Kennedy continued his close working relationship with ranking Republican Senator Orrin Hatch, and they were close allies on many health-related measures.|$|E
500|$|Capuano {{considered}} {{running for}} Governor of Massachusetts in 2014. On January 21, 2013, former Mayor of Springfield, Massachusetts {{and member of}} the Massachusetts Governor's Council Michael Albano endorsed Capuano to run, posting on his Facebook page: [...] "while the Congressman has not made a decision to compete for the [...] nomination [...] at this time, it is not too early to make the case and encourage his candidacy." [...] When asked in February 2013 whether he <b>might</b> <b>run</b> for governor, Capuano responded: [...] "Part of me thinks that some of the more interesting, more important fights {{over the next several years}} might be conducted at statehouses around the country and not necessarily on Capitol Hill." [...] In a statement in September 2013, Capuano announced he would not run for governor, and would instead focus on running for re-election to Congress. His decision was attributed to his loss against Martha Coakley in the Democratic primary for Senate, virtually closing any possibility for running for higher office.|$|E
500|$|In 1927–28, {{at the end}} of {{the silent}} era, the {{production}} cost of an average feature from a major Hollywood studio ranged from $190,000 at Fox to $275,000 at Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. That average reflected both [...] "specials" [...] that might cost as much as [...] and films made quickly for around $50,000. These cheaper films (not yet called B movies) allowed the studios to derive maximum value from facilities and contracted staff in between a studio's more important productions, while also breaking in new personnel. Studios in the minor leagues of the industry, such as Columbia Pictures and Film Booking Offices of America (FBO), focused on exactly those sorts of cheap productions. Their movies, with relatively short running times, targeted theaters that had to economize on rental and operating costs, particularly small-town and urban neighborhood venues, or [...] "nabes". Even smaller production houses, known as Poverty Row studios, made films whose costs <b>might</b> <b>run</b> as low as $3,000, seeking a profit through whatever bookings they could pick up in the gaps left by the larger concerns.|$|E
