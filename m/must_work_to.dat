25|$|Social Security {{affects the}} saving {{behavior}} {{of the people in}} three different ways. The wealth substitution effect occurs when a person saving for retirement recognizes that the Social Security system will take care of him and decreases his expectations about how much he needs to personally save. The retirement effect occurs when a taxpayer saves more each year in an effort to reduce the total number of years he <b>must</b> <b>work</b> <b>to</b> accumulate enough savings before retirement. The bequest effect occurs when a taxpayer recognizes a decrease in resources stemming from the Social Security tax and compensates by increasing personal savings to cover future expected costs of having children.|$|E

25|$|Parental involvement, as {{discussed}} in the benefits section {{can also be a}} drawback, if parents and community members are not willing to express their opinions {{on the quality of the}} education system, the system may not see a need for improvement, and not change to meet student’s needs. Parents may also become too involved, requesting too many changes, so that important improvements get lost with other changes that are being suggested. Instructors will also find that their work is increased; they <b>must</b> <b>work</b> <b>to</b> first understand the outcome, then build a curriculum around each outcome they are required to meet. Instructors have found that implementing multiple outcomes is difficult to do equally, especially in primary school. Instructors will also find their work load increased if they chose to use an assessment method that evaluates students holistically.|$|E

[...] In an interview, the singer commented that while composing 5to Piso he [...] "tried to recoup some of the freshness" [...] of his past releases, stating that [...] "it makes so good to the songs". He further stated that he believes [...] "all albums are result of an evolution, and contradictions either", also stating that he celebrated contradictions as part of life. Arjona begun working on the album as early as 2005. Talking about the process of recording the album, he stated that [...] "We <b>must</b> <b>work</b> <b>to</b> make the albums comfortable to us", further commenting that [...] "The rest is a matter of how good or bad the albums defend themselves." ...|$|E

500|$|Diabetic {{ketoacidosis}} arises {{because of}} a lack of insulin in the body. The lack of insulin and corresponding elevation of glucagon leads to increased release of glucose by the liver (a process that is normally suppressed by insulin) from glycogen via glycogenolysis and [...] also through gluconeogenesis. High glucose levels spill over into the urine, taking water and solutes (such as sodium and potassium) along with it in a process known as osmotic diuresis. This leads to polyuria, dehydration, and polydipsia. The absence of insulin also leads to the release of free fatty acids from adipose tissue (lipolysis), which are converted through a process called beta oxidation, again in the liver, into ketone bodies (acetoacetate and β-hydroxybutyrate). β-Hydroxybutyrate can serve as an energy source in the absence of insulin-mediated glucose delivery, and is a protective mechanism in case of starvation. The ketone bodies, however, have a low pKa and therefore turn the blood acidic (metabolic acidosis). The body initially buffers the change with the bicarbonate buffering system, but this system is quickly overwhelmed and other mechanisms <b>must</b> <b>work</b> <b>to</b> compensate for the acidosis. One such mechanism is hyperventilation to lower the blood carbon dioxide levels (a form of compensatory respiratory alkalosis). This hyperventilation, in its extreme form, may be observed as Kussmaul respiration.|$|E
2500|$|Since blood {{pressure}} is in intimate feedback with cardiac output and peripheral resistance, with relatively low {{blood pressure}}, the afterload on the heart decreases; this decreases how hard the heart <b>must</b> <b>work</b> <b>to</b> eject blood into the aorta, so the amount of oxygen required by the heart decreases accordingly.

We must maintain stable, orderly and liquid financial markets and our banks must continue to play their vital role of supporting the economy by making credit available to consumers and businesses. And we must of course focus on housing, which precipitated the turmoil in the capital markets, and is today the biggest downside risk to our economy. We <b>must</b> <b>work</b> <b>to</b> limit the impact of the housing downturn on the real economy without impeding the completion of the necessary housing correction. I will address each of these in turn. Regulators and policy makers are vigilant; we are not taking anything for granted.” ...|$|E
2500|$|The burn {{temperature}} in modern stoves can increase {{to the point}} where secondary and complete combustion of the fuel takes place. A properly fired masonry heater has little or no particulate pollution in the exhaust and does not contribute to the buildup of creosote in the heater flues or the chimney. Some stoves achieve as little as 1 to 4grams per hour. This is roughly 90% less smoke than older stoves, and equates to nearly zero visible smoke from the chimney. This is largely achieved through causing the maximum amount of material to combust, which results in a net efficiency of 60 to 70% as contrasted to less than 30% for an open fireplace. (Net efficiency is the amount of heat energy transferred to the room compared to the amount contained in the wood, minus any amount central heating <b>must</b> <b>work</b> <b>to</b> compensate for airflow problems.) ...|$|E

2500|$|In the United States in {{the early}} 19th century, the American Colonization Society was {{established}} as the primary vehicle for proposals to return black Americans to greater freedom and equality in Africa. The colonization effort resulted from a mixture of motives with its founder Henry Clay stating; [...] "unconquerable prejudice resulting from their color, they never could amalgamate with the free whites of this country. It was desirable, therefore, as it respected them, and the residue {{of the population of}} the country, to drain them off". Racism spread throughout the New World in the late 19th century and early 20th century. Whitecapping, which started in Indiana in the late 19th century, soon spread throughout all of North America, causing many African laborers to flee from the land they worked on. In the US during the 1860s, racist posters were used during election campaigns. In one of these racist posters (see above), a black man is depicted lounging idly in the foreground as one white man ploughs his field and another chops wood. Accompanying labels are: [...] "In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat thy bread," [...] and [...] "The white man <b>must</b> <b>work</b> <b>to</b> keep his children and pay his taxes."
