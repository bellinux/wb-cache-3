5|$|Banksia spinulosa {{was named}} by James Edward Smith in England in 1793, after being {{collected}} by John White, most likely in 1792. He {{gave it the}} common name prickly-leaved banksia, though this has fallen out of use. With four currently recognised varieties, the species has had a complicated taxonomic history, with two varieties initially described as separate species in the early 19th century. A fourth, from the New England region, has only recently been described. However, there has been disagreement whether one, var.cunninghamii, is distinct enough to once again have specific status. The pre-eminent authority on Banksia, Alex George, concedes there is still <b>more</b> <b>work</b> <b>to</b> {{be done on the}} Banksia spinulosa complex.|$|E

50|$|During the Renaissance, Boccaccio, a 14th-century humanist, {{included}} Eirene in De mulieribus claris (Latin for On Famous Women). However, in this telling Boccaccio apparently conflated many of {{the women}} described by Pliny and attributed many <b>more</b> <b>works</b> <b>to</b> Eirene. Some other paintings he credits to Eirene are an older Calypso, the gladiator Theodorus, and a famous dancer called Alcisthenes.|$|R
25|$|Excavation {{began in}} 1972 and was {{intermittent}} until the lead archaeologist, Ehud Netzer's, death in 2010. Netzer worked at Herodium {{on behalf of}} the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. Although there is much of the palace left to unearth, Netzer was the premier historian and had the most experience and knowledge of Herodium, so construction stopped in late 2010. Many archaeologists suspect that mosaic floors and frescoes were common throughout the palace, but it will take <b>more</b> <b>work</b> <b>to</b> reveal them, because over two thousand years have passed since its construction.|$|E
25|$|When {{there is}} a high {{temperature}} differential (e.g., when an air-source heat pump is used to heat a house with an outside temperature of, say, 0°C (32°F)), it takes <b>more</b> <b>work</b> <b>to</b> move the same amount of heat to indoors than on a milder day. Ultimately, due to Carnot efficiency limits, the heat pump's performance will decrease as the outdoor-to-indoor temperature difference increases (outside temperature gets colder), reaching a theoretical limit of 1.0 at −273°C. In practice, a COP of 1.0 will typically be reached at an outdoor temperature around −18°C (0°F) for air source heat pumps.|$|E
25|$|After retirement, Parks {{wrote her}} {{autobiography}} {{and continued to}} insist that the struggle for justice was not over and there was <b>more</b> <b>work</b> <b>to</b> be done. In her final years, she suffered from dementia. Parks received national recognition, including the NAACP's 1979 Spingarn Medal, the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the Congressional Gold Medal, and a posthumous statue in the United States Capitol's National Statuary Hall. Upon her death in 2005, she was the first woman and third non-US government official to lie in honor at the Capitol Rotunda. Her birthday, February 4, and the day she was arrested, December 1, have both become Rosa Parks Day, commemorated in California and Missouri (February 4), and Ohio and Oregon (December 1).|$|E

40|$|Objective: The aim of {{this study}} is to examine social, economic, and health factors related <b>to</b> paid <b>work</b> in well-functioning older adults and if and how these factors vary by race. Method: We used sex-stratified {{logistic}} and multinomial logistic regression to examine cross-sectional data in the Health, Aging, and Body Composition cohort study. The sample included 3, 075 community-dwelling Black (42 %) and White adults aged 70 to 79 at baseline. Results: Multinomial logistic regression analyses show Black men were <b>more</b> likely <b>to</b> <b>work</b> full-time, and Black women were <b>more</b> likely <b>to</b> <b>work</b> part-time. Men with ≥US$ 50, 000 family income were <b>more</b> likely <b>to</b> <b>work</b> full-time. Men with better physical functioning were <b>more</b> likely <b>to</b> <b>work</b> full- and part-time. Women with ≥US$ 50, 000 family income and fewer chronic diseases were <b>more</b> likely <b>to</b> <b>work</b> full-time. Women who were overweight and had fewer chronic diseases were <b>more</b> likely <b>to</b> <b>work</b> part-time. Discussion: Results suggest that well-functioning, older Black adults were <b>more</b> likely <b>to</b> <b>work</b> than their White counterparts, and working relates to better health and higher income, providing support for a productive or successful aging perspective...|$|R
25|$|While at Ferrari, Barnard ruffled a few {{feathers}} {{with his}} way of doing things. Despite being the team's Technical Director, he alienated himself from the team {{when he decided to}} set up his office in England and not at the factory in Maranello as had been the tradition even with non-Italian members of the team (like the team's chief engineer at the time, fellow Briton Harvey Postlethwaite), reasoning that it would allow <b>more</b> <b>work</b> <b>to</b> be done on designing the 1989 car without the distractions of the factory and the Italian press who had been known to be scathing on any Ferrari failures. He also put a ban on the team's long-standing tradition of having wine at the mechanics lunch table during testing, something that proved unpopular with the team's mostly Italian mechanics.|$|E
25|$|For {{detecting}} the targets, GL was largely ineffective. From a mechanical standpoint, {{the need to}} swing the entire system around for tracking presented a major problem. A more serious limitation was the displays themselves, which showed {{only a small portion}} of the sky in the range display, and a single on-target/off-target indication in bearing. Although it might be possible to swing the antenna in bearing to find a target, the direction was accurate to only 20 degrees, enough to keep the antennas aligned with the target, but of little use directing optical instruments onto a target, especially at night. Additionally, the bearing display only showed whether the antennas were aligned or not, but not to which side or the other the target lay if it was mis-aligned, requiring <b>more</b> <b>work</b> <b>to</b> determine which direction to turn the antenna for tracking.|$|E
25|$|Problems soon developed, and the {{mausoleum}} site became {{the target of}} vandals. As a preventative measure, the entrance was bricked up to prevent access, but the wall was breached in 1956. By 1958 the church vestry became concerned, and in 1962 refused to grant permission for any <b>more</b> <b>work</b> <b>to</b> {{be done on the}} site. Soon negotiations began to break the original contract; in 1968 the property reverted to the church, and Remey was given five years to remove anything of value from the site. Most of the dead were taken by relatives to another family cemetery in New York; Remey's wife Gertrude was reinterred in the main church cemetery. After the last of the bodies were removed, the Remeum was demolished beginning in 1973, and the last of the aboveground ruins was finally bulldozed ten years later. Little remains on the site to mark the former presence of the complex save an obelisk dedicated to Remey's parents and a pair of structures which served as chimneys or vents. Urban legends about the site persist, describing parties in the crypts below {{the mausoleum}}.|$|E

500|$|Due to {{budgetary}} restraints, Seventeen Seconds {{was recorded}} and mixed in seven {{days on a}} budget of between £2000 and £3000, {{which resulted in the}} band working 16 or 17 hours a day to complete the album. Hedges and Robert Smith knew [...] "A Forest" [...] would take <b>more</b> <b>work</b> <b>to</b> complete than other songs on the album, and would require more overdubs. [...] "A Forest" [...] {{was one of the last}} tracks recorded; the backing tracks were recorded first, followed by touch-ups to the individual parts, then Smith's vocals. Fiction Records owner Chris Parry told Smith that the song had the potential to be a hit if they made it sound [...] "radio friendly", but Smith refused, stating that the way the track sounded was the sound he envisioned in his head, dismissing concerns about radio friendliness. Work on mixing [...] "A Forest" [...] took up much of the final day of sessions for the album.|$|E
500|$|The {{top three}} drivers {{appeared}} on the podium to collect their trophies and in a later press conference. Häkkinen {{said that he was}} [...] "pleased" [...] to win the race and admitted that he waited until the pit stop phase to have any chance of overtaking Michael Schumacher. He said that his team had <b>more</b> <b>work</b> <b>to</b> do on his car and was looking forward to the next race. Coulthard believed he made the right decision to compete in the Grand Prix despite his injuries and that the result was [...] "the best thing that could have happened for the team and myself." [...] He also said he was looking forward to resting over the coming days to allow his injuries to heal. Barrichello admitted that the race had not been good for him until his overtake on Michael Schumacher and Ralf Schumacher and said the absence of Stepney caused his second pit stop to be slower than usual.|$|E
500|$|Critics were {{generally}} unimpressed with the series premiere. Mike Hale of the New York Times critically panned the episode, writing, [...] "An interesting drama {{could be made}} about Mr. Hefner's success in fusing sex, privilege and pseudo-cool into a wildly successful commercial empire during a conservative time, but The Playboy Club sets out to do much less, and succeeds." [...] Similarly, Seth Amitin of IGN gave the episode a 4.5 out of ten, signifying a [...] "bad" [...] rating. Amitin stated that he was disappointed with its delivery, opining that while there were some potential in the show, it would [...] "take a lot <b>more</b> <b>work</b> <b>to</b> get this show off the ground." [...] Meredith Blake of The A.V. Club reacted mildly to the episode, expressing that it was [...] "glossy" [...] but dull and mediocre. Fellow writer Phil Nugent echoed similar sentiments, writing, [...] "The only outrageous thing about The Playboy Club is the scale of its miscalculated reverence for the sanctimonious mythology it's trying to peddle." [...] In conclusion, Blake and Nugent gave the episode a 'C' grade.|$|E

500|$|Illinois Representative Chauncey Reed had {{introduced}} the Elgin coin legislation at Rovelstad's behest, {{and both the}} sculptor and Hoffecker worked with him to advance the bill through Congress. [...] In February 1936, Hoffecker, who had been appointed by ANA President T. James Clarke to lead a committee against abuses in the issuance of commemorative coins, went to Washington, passing through Chicago {{on his way to}} visit Rovelstad. [...] The two men had hoped to keep the mintage to 10,000, to be able to sell the coins at a higher price. [...] Congress, however, was not minded to create a low-mintage commemorative, as there had been several issues which had been struck in small numbers only to sell at high prices, and the bill was amended to provide for 25,000 half dollars. Hoffecker hoped to lower the number, urging the sculptor to lobby for a decrease. [...] Hoffecker noted it would be much <b>more</b> <b>work</b> <b>to</b> sell 25,000, and they could not command as high a price. There were a large number of commemorative coin bills in Congress in 1936, and the dealer feared that President Franklin D. Roosevelt would start vetoing them. [...] Hoffecker visited Washington twice more in May, once meeting Rovelstad there, where they lobbied members of Congress.|$|E
500|$|The first US vessel to {{participate}} in the mass evacuation was the , which left Haiphong on August 17. It carried 1,924refugees for a 1,600kilometre, three-day journey to the southern capital. By this time, there were already 132,000 people registered at the waiting areas, although very few had any identification. As a result, there would be <b>more</b> <b>work</b> <b>to</b> be done in identifying their needs once they arrived in the south. The [...] followed on the next day, with 2,100passengers. Both were originally built as attack transport vessels. In August, the US policy was liberalised so that Vietnamese and French military personnel could also be evacuated at the discretion of CTF-90 and the Chief Military Assistance Advisory Group (CHMAAG). To cope with the rising volume of southbound sea transport, CHMAAG established a refugee debarkation site at Vũng Tàu, a coastal port at the entrance of the Saigon River. This site relieved congestion in the Saigon refugee camps and decreased the traffic bottlenecks along the river. A setback occurred when a typhoon struck the Haiphong area, destroying almost half of the refugee staging area. Despite the problems, by September 3, the US Navy had evacuated 47,000northerners after only two weeks of operations. The high rate of evacuation caused the South Vietnamese government to order that only one shipment of at most 2,500passengers was to arrive in Saigon or Vũng Tàu per day, until September 25. The population pressure in the south was eased as incoming numbers fell due to Viet Minh propaganda campaigns and forcible detention, combined with the rice harvesting season, which had prompted some to delay their departure. Some were even waiting to finish all their business deals before moving in the Lunar New Year. On October 10, the Viet Minh were given full control of Hanoi, closing off one point of evacuation for those who wanted out. Some also decided to stay behind and see how the Viet Minh would treat the inhabitants of Hanoi before making a decision on whether to leave their ancestral lands. On October 20, the French authorities that were still in control of the ports decided to waive docking fees on US vessels engaged in the evacuation. Because of the high demand, the naval vessels had to travel quickly; one ship completed one round trip in a record of only six days. The record for the most passengers taken in one journey was set by the USS General Black, which sailed on October 29 with 5,224 Vietnamese aboard. In November, the evacuation was further hampered by another typhoon, while the entire crew of one American vessel were struck down by a scabies outbreak. In December, because of Viet Minh obstruction, which prevented people from rural and regional areas from travelling to Hanoi and Haiphong to emigrate, the French Navy sent ships to hover just off the coast near the regional town of Vinh to evacuate refugees.|$|E
