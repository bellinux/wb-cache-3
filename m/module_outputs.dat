50|$|The {{service manual}} {{explains}} that Autostick signalling is multiplexed {{on a single}} wire. The transmission control <b>module</b> <b>outputs</b> a 5v signal to the handle and monitors it for voltage drop The voltage ranges 0.3-1.6,1.6-2.8, 2.8-3.8, and 3.8-4.8 representing down,up, overdrive lockout, and all open respectively. The vehicle drops into 1st after stopping but can be launched in 1st, 2nd, or 3rd gear. The speed (or cruise) control operates only in 3rd and 4th gear while in Autostick mode and is deactivated if shifted to 2nd gear, just as it would if the driver had braked. Shifting into 4th (aka D) cancels Autostick single gear selection mode, and gears are automatically selected as usual until down or OD lockout is pressed.|$|E
40|$|Abstract — This paper {{relies on}} the {{principles}} of inexact computing to alleviate the issues arising in static masking by voting for reliable computing. A scheme that utilizes approximate voting is proposed; it is referred to as inexact double modular redundancy (IDMR). IDMR does not resort to triplication, thus saving overhead due to modular replication; moreover, this scheme is adaptive in its operation, i. e., it allows a threshold to determine the validity of the <b>module</b> <b>outputs.</b> IDMR operates by initially establishing the difference between the values of the outputs of the two modules; only if the difference is below a preset threshold, then the voter calculates the average value of the two <b>module</b> <b>outputs.</b> An extensive analysis of the voting circuits and an application to image processing are presented...|$|E

This is because in case of the latter, the function <b>modules</b> <b>outputs</b> are solely processed by the majority voters, while in the case of the former, the function <b>modules</b> <b>outputs</b> are additionally processed by the error signalling logic or the system health monitor and hence extra power is dissipated. Of the total power dissipated by the TMR_SHM, the proportion of power dissipated by the proposed system health monitor is 20.8  %. In the case of QMR_SHM, this proportion is found to be 27  %.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{the problem of}} accurately modeling the software fault-tolerance technique based on recovery blocks. Models of such systems {{have been criticized for}} their assumptions of independence. Analysis of some systems have considered the correlation between software modules. This correlation may be due to a portion of the functional specification that is common to all software modules or due to the inherent hardness of some problems. We consider three types of dependence which can be captured using measurements. We consider correlation between software modules for a single input, correlation between successive acceptance tests on correct <b>module</b> <b>outputs</b> and incorrect <b>module</b> <b>outputs,</b> and correlation between subsequent inputs. The technique we use is quite general and can be applied to other types of correlation. In accounting for dependence, we use the intensity distribution introduced by Eckhardt and Lee. We consider a new method of generating the intensity distribution which is based on the pairwise correlation between modules. This method provides us with a pessimistic result and a probability-based approximation. We contrast this method with the assumption of independent modules as well as the use of the beta-binomial density which was introduced by Nicola and Goyal. For the purpose of obtaining numerical results, we use stochastic reward nets (SRN's) that incorporate all of the above dependencies and then use a modeling tool called Stochastic Petri Net Package (SPNP) ...|$|E

Phrasal verbs are a commonly occurring feature of English and comprise a verb followed by a particle(s) (adverb or a preposition).

We present the description of a methodology (and of a module that implements it) that performs semantics-based disambiguation of phrasal verbs.

40|$|Failure {{detection}} is {{a fundamental}} building block for ensuring fault tolerance in distributed systems. Failure detector is a distributed entity and is consist of the set of failure detector modules. Each <b>module</b> <b>outputs</b> the set of suspected processes. Failure detectors are basic components to solve agreement problems (e. g., consensus, atomic broadcast, atomic commitment), especially in asynchronous distributed systems. There are lots of approaches and implementations in failure detectors. However, providing flexible failure detection in off-the-shelf distributed systems is difficult. Practical solutions to failure detection rely on some adaptive mechanism {{to cope with the}} unpredictability of networking conditions. However, they lack the necessary flexibility to provide failure detection as a system-wide service. In particular, traditional solutions take a “one size fits all ” approach, which prevents them from simultaneously supporting several distributed applications with very diverse QoS requirements.

Let us now presume that after the application of specific inputs, the correct outputs of half adder 2 are Sum 2  =  1 and Cout 2  =  1. Assuming that half adders 1 and 3 have become faulty, let their outputs be assumed as Sum 1  =  0, Cout 1  =  1; and Sum 3  =  1, Cout 3  =  0. As a result, the internal word-voter outputs viz.

Hence, the error output (ErrorWV) produced by the word-voter would be 1, which is correct, indicating that the TMR system is experiencing multiple function module faults, thus suggesting a repair is necessary.
