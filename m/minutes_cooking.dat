40|$|Abs t rac t. The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine the effect of cooking time on the cooking quality and texture properties of spaghetti made with different raw materials. As a result of extension in the cooking time, an increase was observed in the amount of water absorbed by the products, with a si-multaneous increase in the index of pasta mass gain after cooking. A high significant correlation between weight increase index and moisture of cooked spaghetti was observed (r = 0. 97, p < 0. 0001). The dry matter losses, during 4 - 16 <b>minutes</b> <b>cooking</b> of spaghetti, were positively correlated with the distance for maximum cutting force and with the cutting work. The correlation coefficients were 0. 85 and 0. 51, re-spectively. The highest values of the cutting force and the cutting work characterised pasta cooked in the time immediately preceding the minimum cooking time. The application of cooking times longer than the minimum caused a decrease in the firmness of the pasta but the changes were relatively slight.

40|$|A {{project to}} improve the cooking quality of grain legumes and their {{products}} has been undertaken in Kenya and Cameroon and coordinated by the Institute of Food Research based in Norwich, UK. Beans are inexpensive, rich sources of dietary proteins and can have beneficial effects on human health. However, they are often under-utilized as human food, due to undesirable characteristics such as the hard-to-cook (HTC) phenomenon {{and the presence of}} anti-nutritional factors that interfere with digestion. The HTC defect develops in beans during storage under high humidity and high temperature conditions which also increases the anti-nutritional factors. HTC beans take up to 12 hours to soften due to changes in the plant cell walls and the increased cooking time uses more water and fuel. Freshly harvested beans require only twenty <b>minutes</b> <b>cooking</b> to achieve cell separation and tissue softening. In HTC beans however, this treatment fails to induce cell separation, and the tissue fractures only through rupture of the cell walls which causes the beans to remain hard. In addition to studying the underlying causes of the HTC defect, researchers developed ways to modify flour from HTC beans into forms that were more acceptable for human consumption. Extrusion cooking was identified as an efficient way to reduce the levels of anti-nutrients in these beans, particularly lectin: protein and starch digestibility was also increased. The resulting flour contained higher levels of digestible protein and was successfully incorporated into a range of African foods.

The highest amount was in T 4 where chlorpyrifos @ 0. 66 a. i. /ha was sprayed at 21 days after emergence and the lowest (86. 5 %) was in control group (T 13) where no pesticide was applied. The dry matter percent was highest in control (13. 50 %) and slightly lower in treatment groups indicating no significant variation among them. The protein percent was from 5. 02 to 5. 24 in different treatment groups expressing little higher than the control plants (4. 82 %). Fat percentage ranged from 0. 10 to 0. 12 in treatment groups, which were very close to control value. Total sugar was highest (2. 10) in T 7, T 9 and T 11 and lowest in T 6 (carbofuran). Reducing sugar was 1. 15 % in T 7 (cypermethrin and chlorpyrifos) and 0. 98 in T 6, while non-reducing sugar seemed to be little higher (1. 11 %) in treatment groups compared to the control (0. 88 %).

40|$|Lentils, {{one of the}} cool-season pulses, are {{consumed}} as a staple food in most developing countries. The demand for pulses in western societies is increasing because of its valuable nutritional quality and an increased awareness of health issues. Australia has a good reputation for producing clean low moisture legume products and could increase as market share of lentil production by identifying, developing and promoting good quality varieties. Lentils which are graded as good quality varieties must have a short and uniform cooking time, without 'hard to cook' seed, have the hull stay attached to the seed during cooking, and have a final acceptable taste, texture, flavour and appearance after cooking (Bhatty 1990). Cooking quality {{in this study is}} defined as the maximum force (N) that is required to compress the whole seed cooked product after cooking for a standard period of time. This study aims to develop an objective measurement to determine the cooking quality of lentils and thereby evaluates the relationships between lentil cooking quality and some of its physical and biochemical properties. Four cultivars used (Cassab, Digger, ILL 7180 and Matilda) were grown during 1999 at Mullewa and Pingaring, Western Australia. The relationship between the cooking quality of lentil and water absorption, seed size, seed coat thickness, phytic acid, mineral composition and initial moisture content was investigated. Texture measurement was carried out using the TA. XT 2 i meter {{as an alternative to the}} subjective method "Cooking time test". By comparing the cooking time determined by 'Cooking time test, 220 N was established and suggested as an optimal peak compression force to determine the adequate cooking time for lentils. Both methods showed that 35 <b>minutes</b> <b>cooking</b> time was adequate for red lentils (Cassab, Digger, and ILL 7180), and 45 minutes for green lentils ++(Matilda). Cooking significantly reduced the hardness of the seeds (R= - 0. 752 to - 0. 89) and promoted mineral leaching (P < 0. 05). The interaction between environment and genotype had a significant effect on seed size, seed coat thickness, mineral composition (Phytic acid, Ne, K+, Mg 2 +, Ca 2 + M+, Fe 2 + and CU 2 +) and hardness (P< 0. 05). Seed coat thickness did not correlated with this rate of water uptake and cooking quality. Growing environments had a greater influence on the cooking quality than genotypes. Lentils grown at Pingaring are generally had a higher in Phyti acid content, better mineral retention and were harder in texture than those grown at Mullewa. The results of this study implicated that the peak compression force (220 N) was identified as an indicator to determine the cooking time of lentil cultivars. Texture Profile Analysis (TPA) is a useful method to evaluate various texture characteristics (hardness, cohesiveness, chewiness, springiness, gumminess and adhesiveness) of lentil cultivars. Cooking quality of lentil is significantly affected by the effect of varieties and growing locations. However, not the various biochemical compositions (phytic acid and minerals) and the thickness of seed coat have no significant effect on the cooking quality of lentil...|$|E
40|$|Sudan {{is almost}} entirely {{depending}} on imports to satisfy its needs of pulp and paper. Out of the total paper consumption (92 %) only 8 % is locally produced. The {{pulp and paper industry}} is looking for unconventional fibrous raw materials for producing different kind of papers and boards. Sudan is endowed with both wood and nonwood lignocellulosic raw materials, all of them are available at the moment due {{to the end of the}} civil war in the South, especially the softwood forests. There must also be a sufficient supply of good quality raw material for running the process throughout the year. It has been shown that nonwood fibrous materials have high biomass production capacity and the pulp yields obtained have in most cases been higher than those from wood species. Nonwood fibres are an important source of raw materials, especially in developing countries. They can be by-product of agriculture such as bagasse and cereal straws, or industrial crops like bamboo, esparto, sisal, flax and hemp. Two bamboo species, Oxytenanthera abyssinica and Bambusa vulgaris together with an industrial by-product, namely bagasse, have been investigated for their potential for producing pulp and paper. The density (for bamboos), fibre dimensions, morphological indices and chemical composition of the raw materials studied were determined. The kraft, kraft-AQ, soda, soda-AQ, AS-AQ and ASAM pulping processes were applied and some of the pulps produced were bleached according to the TCF bleaching methods. The trials to improve the pulp properties included blending of bamboo and bagasse pulps. The average basic density of the two bamboo species was in the range of tropical hardwood of 150 - 1150 kg/m 3 and in the middle for commercial pulpwoods (350 - 650 kg/m 3). The fibre dimensions were microscopically evaluated. The average fibre length of Oxytenanthera abyssinica (1. 5 mm), Bambusa vulgaris (2. 1 mm) and bagasse (1. 7 mm) were in the range of softwood and bamboo (1 - 7 mm). The fibre length of bambusa is considered as long, but that of oxytenanthera is medium-long. The fibre width of the two bamboo species was nearly the same, medium-narrow and of hardwood range (10 - XI 35 μm). According to flexibility coefficients oxytenanthera have higher bonding strength (tensile, burst, double folds). The thicker wall of bambusa (4. 6 μm) compared to that of oxytenanthera (3. 7 μm) indicated a very different morphological indices and behaviour. The narrow fibres of bagasse (8. 4 μm) had wide lumens (5. 2 μm) and thin cell wall thickness (1. 6 μm). Their good flexibility coefficient (62) indicate their ability to collapse easily and to form interfiber bonding important for paper strength. The chemical composition of the raw materials was typical for non-woody plants. They have high ash content, especially silica and low lignin contents. The very good cellulose content of bagasse (54. 8 %) predicted very good to excellent pulp yield. The higher cellulose content (56. 6 %) of oxytenanthera predicted better yields than from bambusa. The overall chemical composition indicates the suitability of alkaline methods for pulping with reasonable alkali charges and predicted good to excellent yields. This was demonstrated by cookings with different alkali charges. Bagasse was pulped easily with alkali charge of 10. 9 - 12. 4 % as Na 2 O for 155 - 160 <b>minutes</b> <b>cooking</b> time at maximum temperature of 170 oC to bleachable kappa number. Bamboo cooking was carried out with alkali charges of 17 - 18. 6 % as Na 2 O for 165 minutes at 170 oC The bagasse alkaline sulphite-anthraquinone pulping gave a very high screened yield (57 %) of a bleachable pulp with a very low kappa number, high viscosity, and high initial ISO brightness. The bagasse soda–AQ cooking gave excellent yield of nearly 58 %. The kraft pulp of bamboo was superior to soda and soda-AQ pulps in all strength properties except for the tensile index of bambusa soda-AQ pulp. Addition of anthraquinone in the kraft pulping of bamboo increased the yield and improved the strength properties. The best bamboo cooking results were obtained with the ASAM process, which gave higher pulp yield and superior optical and strength properties than the kraft process. Higher yield, lower kappa numbers, superior viscosity and brightness were obtained at high pulp strength level for the both bamboo species. XII Oxytenanthera AS-AQ pulp was blended with the strongly bonding bagasse AS-AQ pulp in three ratios (10 : 90, 30 : 70, 50 : 50). With all blending ratios the tensile strength of oxy/bag pulp blends was improved, and the values were more or less the same as for 100 % bagasse pulp. On the other hand, the tear index of the blends was improved compared to that of 100 % bagasse pulp, and 50 : 50 blends were with the highest tear strength. TCF bleaching with Q 1 O/PQ 2 P sequence was applied for bagasse soda, soda-AQ and AS-AQ pulps. The bleached pulps reached a final ISO brightness of 71. 6, 74. 1 and 76. 9 % respectively at a kappa number of 1. 6 – 3. 9 and viscosity in the range of 790 - 990 ml/g. The oxytenanthera pulps Kraft and ASAM were bleached with OQ 1 O/PP sequence. Good bleachability for the oxytenanthera pulps was comparatively difficult to attain as it required additional chemical charges due to the high lignin content of the unbleached pulps. The kappa numbers of the kraft and ASAM pulps were reduced from 24. 8 to 6. 6 and from 19. 4 to 8. 0 respectively. The ISO brightness obtained was about 82 % for the both pulps. The viscosity loss for both pulp types and especially for the ASAM pulps was small (from 1024 to 885 g/ml and 1114 to 1054 g/ml respectively). The addition of DTPA at the chelation stages (Q) improved the delignification selectivity, resulting in an increased ISO brightness in both cases. In the final peroxide stage the addition of DTPMPA (0. 05 %) and MgSO 4 had been proved beneficial for successful peroxide bleaching. All raw materials chosen were well suited for obtaining pulp with acceptable to excellent yield with the most suitable pulping process tried, according to their individual characteristics. They could develop into predominant fibre resources for good quality pulps for use in printing and writing paper...|$|E

40|$|The {{change in}} texture and flavour during cooking of carrot discs of 5 {{different}} batches was investigated by sensory analysis and four different physicochemical measurements. The five most important sensory attributes were sweet odour, sweet taste, juiciness, hardness and crispness. All sensory descriptors underwent a similar decrease in intensity during cooking {{for up to}} 15 min. Hardness and crispness were highly correlated. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) showed differences between the experimental samples. The first principal component explained 99 % {{of the total variance}} and was related to the cooking time. The second principal component pointed at differences between the carrot batches, for example, carrots grown on a sandy soil (3 - 4 % organic matter) and kept over winter on a straw covered field, were less sweet, but more juicy, crisp and hard than carrots of the same cultivar grown on a soil with a higher humus content (8 % organic matter) and kept in a cool store. Soluble solids content (SSC), dry matter (DM), tensile strength (F-t) and compressive strength (F-c) also decreased with cooking time. SSC and DM decreased more or less linearly, while F, and F, showed an exponential decrease from one <b>minute</b> <b>cooking</b> onwards. Due to the different effect of cellular turgor on tensile and compressive strength, F, dropped rapidly within the first <b>minute</b> of <b>cooking,</b> while Fc remained constant.

XT Plus Texture Analyser, texture profile analysis (TPA) of carrot hardness, springiness, cohesiveness, gumminess and chewiness after 5, 10, 15 and 20 <b>minutes</b> of <b>cooking</b> was performed. The highest value for hardness was observed in raw carrot (10167. 5 g). The lowest value for hardness (1378. 92 g) was observed after 20 minutes of thermal processing. Using the Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA), it was found out how carrot hardness during cooking varies with the other textural parameters from TPA analysis. The coefficient of determination was 0. 9955 and it explained 99. 55 % of total variability for the TPA analysis results. The highest differences in hardness were observed in the first 5 <b>minutes</b> of <b>cooking.</b> The significance of the model was determined by The Fisher´s F test. The probability corresponding to the F value was lower than 0. 0001, it would be taking a lower than 0. 01 % risk in assuming that there was no effect of the explanatory variables. The results implied that the optimal cooking time of carrots lies in range of 10 and 15 minutes...|$|R

50|$|The pastry {{is heated}} in butter, margarine, palm oil, or {{traditionally}} semneh and then spread with soft white cheese, such as Nabulsi cheese, {{and topped with}} more pastry. In khishnah kanafeh the cheese is rolled in the pastry. A thick syrup of sugar, water, and {{a few drops of}} rose water or orange blossom water is poured on the pastry during the final <b>minutes</b> of <b>cooking.</b> Often the top layer of pastry is tinted with red food coloring (a modern shortcut, instead of baking it for long periods of time). Crushed pistachios are sprinkled on top as a garnish.|$|R
50|$|The cassava is peeled, grated {{and mixed}} {{with a small amount}} of cassava that was {{previously}} fermented which is the starter, (the starter has different names depending on the ethnic group that produces it (mangnan Ebrié lidjrou in Adjoukrou and bêdêfon in allandjan), the paste is left to ferment for one or two days. Once the fermentation time is over and the hydrocyanic acid that exists in a large proportion in natural cassava has been removed, the pulp is dewatered, screened, and dried, and then the final cooking is done by steaming the pulp. After a few <b>minutes</b> of <b>cooking,</b> the elattiéké is ready for consumption.|$|R
