500|$|Fifteen canvases depict cypresses, a tree {{he became}} fascinated with in Arles. He brought {{life to the}} trees, which were {{traditionally}} seen as emblematic of death. The series of cypresses he began in Arles featured {{the trees in the}} distance, as windbreaks in fields; when he was at Saint-Rémy he brought them to the foreground. Vincent wrote to Theo in May 1889: [...] "Cypresses still preoccupy <b>me,</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> like to do something with them like my canvases of sunflowers"; he went on to say, [...] "They are beautiful in line and proportion like an Egyptian obelisk." ...|$|E
500|$|Dickinson {{was troubled}} {{from a young}} age by the [...] "deepening menace" [...] of death, {{especially}} the deaths {{of those who were}} close to her. When Sophia Holland, her second cousin and a close friend, grew ill from typhus and died in April 1844, Emily was traumatized. Recalling the incident two years later, Emily wrote that [...] "it seemed to <b>me</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> die too if I could not be permitted to watch over her or even look at her face." [...] She became so melancholic that her parents sent her to stay with family in Boston to recover. With her health and spirits restored, she soon returned to Amherst Academy to continue her studies. During this period, she first met people who were to become lifelong friends and correspondents, such as Abiah Root, Abby Wood, Jane Humphrey, and Susan Huntington Gilbert (who later married Emily's brother Austin).|$|E
500|$|Räikkönen was demoted to from fifth to eighth {{place for}} causing the final lap {{collision}} with Bottas and scored only four points rather than ten, and this secured the constructors championship for Mercedes. McLaren driver Fernando Alonso {{was given a}} five-second penalty for exceeding track limits, promoting Toro Rosso's Max Verstappen to tenth. When asked about the collision with Bottas {{at the press conference}} for the following United States Grand Prix, Kimi Räikkönen remained unregenerate, saying: [...] " [...] hasn't changed. There were some discussions. I would still do it tomorrow again, that doesn't change the story." [...] Bottas took a different viewpoint, saying: [...] "I don't think it was a racing incident. I didn't see anyone there and I was in front, and then suddenly someone hits <b>me.</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> be on the podium, but I'm here with zero points instead. That's just disappointing." ...|$|E

500|$|Songs {{from the}} album have been sampled {{frequently}} by hip hop producers and artists, including Black Moon, who sampled [...] "A Divine Image", and DJ Shadow, who sampled the luminous piano line from [...] "The Human Abstract" [...] on his 1996 song [...] "Midnight in a Perfect World". English hip hop producer Metabeats called Songs of Experience {{one of his}} favorite sources for sampling music and said of the album in an interview for Hip Hop Connection: [...] "You could sample everything on this record, and I think everyone already has. Axelrod is pretty much a sound library in himself – the quality is amazing." [...] American musician John McEntire ranked it third on his list of top-five albums and called it [...] "early crate-digger stuff. Great, funky rhythm-section playing, crazy, overblown string arrangements." [...] In a 2000 interview for The Wire, rapper and producer Mike Ladd spoke of the album recording [...] "London", deeming it [...] "crazy stuff" [...] that deviated from the one-dimensional rhythm loops of contemporary hip hop production. He went on the say, [...] "this is definitely the kind of stuff I'm planning to do for the next album, incorporate more fusion elements and stuff like that. This is a really good production. I like it because it's little parts with gaps, which I don't normally have. Somebody told <b>me</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> listen to [...] This is one I'm definitely going to buy I'd like to do more stuff with complicated melodies, everybody playing together, drum breaks, things like that." ...|$|E

Consuelo was the rose in The Little Prince. [...] "I should have judged her by her acts and not by her words," [...] says the prince. [...] "She wrapped herself around me and enlightened <b>me.</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> never have fled. I should have guessed at the tenderness behind her poor ruses." ...|$|E
2500|$|Secretary of Defense Melvin R. Laird visited Vietnam in December. Lavelle met {{privately with}} Laird in Saigon. At this meeting, Lavelle later asserted, Laird [...] "told <b>me</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> make a liberal {{interpretation}} {{of the rules of}} engagement in the field and not come to Washington and ask him, under the political climate, to come out with an interpretation; I should make them in the field and he would back me up."

2500|$|Secretary of Defense Melvin R. Laird met {{privately with}} Lavelle {{on a visit}} to Saigon on Dec. 8, 1971.

He stated that if I were to make more liberal interpretations of the rules of engagement, I was not likely to be questioned by DOD for our actions.... I conveyed this information and my private discussion to , and General Abrams said he agreed with Secretary Laird." ...|$|E
2500|$|In an {{interview}} with Behr, Li Wenda told him Puyi was a very clumsy man who [...] "invariably forgot to close doors behind him, forgot to flush the toilet, forgot to turn the tap off after washing his hands, had a genius for creating an instant, disorderly mess around him". Puyi had been so used to having his needs catered to that he never entirely learned how to function on his own. Puyi {{tried very hard to}} be modest and humble, always being the last person to board a bus, which meant that frequently missed the ride and in restaurants would tell the waitresses that [...] "You should not be serving <b>me.</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> be serving you." [...] Pujie told Behr: ...|$|E
2500|$|Martinez wrote a 1992 guest {{column in}} the Oakland Tribune: [...] "When I walk around nude, I am acting how I think it is {{reasonable}} to act, not how middle-class values tell <b>me</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> act. I am refusing to hide my dissent in normalcy even though it is very easy to do so." [...] Martinez, who typically attended classes wearing only sandals and a backpack, became a cause célèbre at the university for a while, participating in a number of nude events on campus and performances by the Bay Area nude performance group the X-Plicit Players. He appeared on national talk shows, was profiled in a photo essay in Playgirl and was parodied in the 1994 college comedy PCU. As a response to [...] Martinez's actions, UC Berkeley issued its [...] "Policy Statement Concerning Public Nudity and Sexually Offensive Conduct" [...] banning public nudity on December 7, 1992.|$|E

2500|$|Bezabeh's {{attempt to}} raise an army against Menelik failed; {{thousands}} of Shewans rallied {{to the flag}} of the son of Negus Haile Melekot and even Bezabeh's own soldiers deserted him for the returning prince. Abeto Menelik entered Ankober and proclaimed himself Negus. While Negus Menelik reclaimed his ancestral Shewan crown, he also laid claim to the Imperial throne, as a direct descendant male line of Emperor Lebna Dengel. However, he made no overt attempt to assert this claim at this time; Marcus interprets his lack of decisive action not only to Menelik's lack of confidence and experience, but that [...] "he was emotionally incapable of helping to destroy the man who had treated him as a son." [...] Not wishing {{to take part in the}} 1868 Expedition to Abyssinia, he allowed his rival Kassai to benefit with gifts of modern weapons and supplies from the British. When Tewodros committed suicide, Menelik arranged for an official celebration of his death even though he was personally saddened by the loss. When the British asked him why he did this, he replied [...] "to satisfy the passions of the people ... as for <b>me,</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> have gone into a forest to weep over ... untimely death ... I have now lost the one who educated me, and toward whom I had always cherished filial and sincere affection." [...] Afterwards other challenges – a revolt amongst the Wollo to the north, the intrigues of his second wife Befana to replace him with her choice of ruler, military failures against the Arsi Oromo to the south east – kept Menelik from directly confronting Kassai until after his rival had brought an Abuna from Egypt who crowned him Emperor Yohannes IV.|$|E
