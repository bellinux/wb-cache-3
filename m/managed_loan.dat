40|$|This study {{investigated}} the impact of unstable exchange rate on bank performance in Nigeria using two proxies for bank performance, namely loan loss to total advances ratio and capital deposit ratio. Government expenditure, interest rate, real gross domestic product were added to exchange rate as independent variables. The two models specified show {{that the impact of}} exchange rate on bank performance is sensitive to the type of proxy used for bank performance. Loan loss to total advance ratio shows that fluctuating exchange rate may affect the ability of lenders to <b>manage</b> <b>loans</b> resulting into high level of bad loans while capital deposit ratio does not have significant relationship with exchange rate. A core recommendation {{of this study is that}} a stable exchange rate is needed to improve the ability of the banking sector to channel credit to the economy...|$|R

40|$|This article {{discusses}} {{the way in}} which a Non Governmental Organization (NGO) in the City of Buenos Aires <b>manages</b> <b>loans</b> for worker cooperatives, {{within the framework of the}} National Microcredit program. Shifting attention away from the question about the impact or scope of these programs, the article seeks to explore the everyday practices of those involved in the delivery and return of loans from an ethnographic approach. Recovering a line of studies in anthropology that draws from the work of Marcel Mauss, it seeks to focus not on exchange but rather on the production process of social bonds and obligations. Considering time as constitutive of the gift, it claims that the interval in which the cooperative’s debt is held constitutes an active waiting area where this NGO creates and recreates cooperatives’ obligation to return the money while reproducing its own continuity as an organization. <br /...|$|R

40|$|Mounting student debt {{to cover}} rising college costs is {{creating}} a challenging environment {{for a number of}} students pursuing a college degree. For many, a college degree is an avenue to financial success and long-term stability. Most college graduates experience more stable employment, higher income, security through assets, and an overall better quality of life than non-graduates (Couturier and Cunningham 2006). Accordingly, <b>managing</b> <b>loan</b> debt may be easier for those who complete college than for those who do not. Current student loan trends, however, may signify a much deeper subtext of loan default. Failure to repay student loans may in part be explained by insufficient financial literacy. In the absence of action, another economic recession driven by our student loan burden is plausible. The student loan debt rate also indicates potential trouble for our postsecondary system. An institution’s retention and student loan default rates are strongly related—most students who do not complete college default on their loan payments (Cunningham and Kienzl 2011...|$|R

40|$|Most of {{the studies}} {{available}} on relationship lending focuses on the benefits for borrowers and neglects those achievable for banks. In particular, empirical studies on the benefits achieved for banks in terms of loans recovery rate, in connection with loss given default rate, are very few. In contrast, choosing the best approach to <b>managing</b> <b>loans</b> is crucial in the current credit market considering the high deterioration in quality of bank loans. This paper empirically tests whether the banks more oriented towards a relationship lending approach report {{a lower level of}} loss given default. Bank size and functional distance are used to measure the relationship lending approach in banks. This paper takes into account the Italian banking system and the effectiveness of their debt recovery processes during the 2005 - 2008 period. The data has been collected by ABI Banking Data and Bank of Italy. The empirical analysis highlights that banks more oriented in the relationship lending model have a greater capacity to recover bad loans. These findings have some managerial implications. <br /...|$|R
