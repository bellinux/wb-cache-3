5|$|The 3rd (Lahore) Division's 7th and 8th Brigades {{began their}} advance at 05:00. The 7th Brigade's 91st Punjabis (Light Infantry) began their advance towards 'Azzun, while the 8th Brigade <b>moved</b> <b>along</b> the Wadi 'Azzun. As the 1st Battalion Manchester Regiment <b>moved</b> <b>along</b> the south bank, and the 47th Sikhs <b>moved</b> <b>along</b> {{on the north}} bank, with the 59th Scinde Rifles in the rear; they quickly found {{themselves}} in a critical position. The leading battalions encountered about 200 German soldiers and 12 machine guns in a well-sited rearguard position south of the wadi. Without any artillery support, an extended battle followed. The 59th Scinde Rifles were ordered to join the fight and a howitzer was rushed forward from the 428th Battery, coming into effective action at 12:30, when resistance almost immediately ceased.|$|E
5|$|In March 2011, Driehaus was {{selected}} for an approximately {{two and a half}} years tenure as the Peace Corps' director of HIV and AIDS education in Swaziland. This follows on his prior African Peace Corps experience as a volunteer. His wife and three children <b>moved</b> <b>along</b> with him. On June 29, 2011, he completed his staff training and was sworn in for service.|$|E

30|$|When {{a mobile}} sink <b>moves</b> <b>along</b> a fixed {{trajectory}} in data collection, then, sink always <b>moves</b> <b>along</b> a pre-defined trajectory regardless the network status and application environment. Usually, the pre-defined trajectory contains the straight line, rectangle, cycle, and so on.|$|R
5|$|Irwin {{developed}} and patented a football scoreboard, {{which was in}} use in the Ivy League by the 1890s. The large scoreboard featured a miniature representation of a football field, and the ball <b>moved</b> <b>along</b> the board to report each play. By 1915, Irwin's scoreboards were featured {{at each end of}} the field for the Army-Navy game at the Polo Grounds.|$|E
5|$|On April 27, 2014, {{three years}} and two days after this tornado, a violent EF4 tornado touched down west of Ferndale and <b>moved</b> <b>along</b> almost the same path as this tornado, causing 16 {{fatalities}} and many injuries. However, it affected more of Mayflower than this tornado did and caused greater damage all along the path, especially in Vilonia, before lifting near El Paso.|$|E
5|$|On the Union left, McClernand's corps <b>moved</b> <b>along</b> the Baldwin Ferry Road and {{astride the}} Southern Railroad of Mississippi. The {{division}} of Brig. Gen. Eugene A. Carr {{was assigned to}} capture the Railroad Redoubt and the 2nd Texas Lunette; the division of Brig. Gen. Peter J. Osterhaus was assigned the Square Fort. Carr's men achieved a small breakthrough at the 2nd Texas Lunette and requested reinforcements.|$|E
50|$|In the {{geometric}} {{diagram of the}} apparatus, six bars of fixed length can be seen: OA, OC, AB, BC, CD, DA. The length of OA {{is equal to the}} length of OC, and the lengths of AB, BC, CD, and DA are all equal forming a rhombus. Also, point O is fixed. Then, if point B is constrained to <b>move</b> <b>along</b> a circle (shown in red) which passes through O, then point D will necessarily have to <b>move</b> <b>along</b> a straight line (shown in blue). On the other hand, if point B were constrained to <b>move</b> <b>along</b> a line (not passing through O), then point D would necessarily have to <b>move</b> <b>along</b> a circle (passing through O).|$|R
25|$|The two Edo-era {{sources have}} the {{orthogonal}} ranging <b>move</b> <b>along</b> {{the rank of}} the board. Western sources have it <b>move</b> <b>along</b> the file, but moving along the rank (as used in this article) would be more {{in keeping with the}} fire demon being a promoted water buffalo.|$|R
50|$|The mouse <b>moves</b> <b>along</b> {{rows and}} columns (i.e. {{horizontally}} and vertically). The lion moves on diagonals. The elephant <b>moves</b> <b>along</b> rows, columns and diagonals. An animal can move {{any number of}} squares on the board in a single direction per turn, but may not jump over other animals.|$|R
5|$|Weaver ant (Oecophylla spp.) workers build nests {{in trees}} by {{attaching}} leaves together, first pulling {{them together with}} bridges of workers and then inducing their larvae to produce silk as they are <b>moved</b> <b>along</b> the leaf edges. Similar forms of nest construction are seen in some species of Polyrhachis.|$|E
5|$|When the {{hospital}} {{moved to new}} and more modern headquarters in the Bayit Vegan neighborhood in 1980, Schwester Selma <b>moved</b> <b>along</b> with it. She died on Sunday, February 5, 1984, two days after her hundredth birthday – the same day a special tribute event had been planned in her honor at {{the hospital}}.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, D Company of the 2/17th Infantry Battalion had <b>moved</b> <b>along</b> {{the track}} to Sattelberg {{with the intent}} of {{capturing}} that position. D Company reported that Sattelberg was unoccupied, but in fact had captured Jivevenang, not Sattelberg. When the mistake was realised and it attempted to take Sattelberg, it was found to be strongly defended. D Company therefore withdrew to Jivevenang. Unfortunately, the news of the capture of Sattelberg was passed {{all the way up the}} line to GHQ in Brisbane.|$|E

5|$|There {{have been}} three {{business}} loops for M-28: Ishpeming–Negaunee, Marquette and Newberry. Only the business loop serving Ishpeming and Negaunee is still a state-maintained trunkline. US41/M-28 was relocated to bypass the two cities' downtowns in 1937. The highway through downtown Ishpeming and Negaunee later carried the ALTUS41/ALTM-28 designation before being designated Bus. M-28 in 1958. The western end of the business loop was transferred to local government control when Bus. M-28 was <b>moved</b> <b>along</b> Lakeshore Drive in 1999.|$|E
5|$|There {{have been}} three {{business}} loops for US41: Ishpeming–Negaunee, Marquette and Baraga. Only the business loop serving Ishpeming and Negaunee is still a state-maintained trunkline, {{but it is no}} longer designated Bus. US41. US41/M-28 was relocated to bypass the two cities' downtowns in 1937. The highway through downtown Ishpeming and Negaunee later carried the ALTUS41/ALTM-28 designation before being designated Bus.

5|$|There is no {{recorded}} {{information on the}} Lānai hookbill's breeding behavior. However, the other Hawaiian honeycreepers are remarkably uniform in their breeding behavior, and it is therefore likely that the hookbills also bred from early winter {{through the end of}} summer in August, with pair bonding being completed by January or February. The males likely defended a territory that <b>moved</b> <b>along</b> with his bonded female and became a centered around the nest after the female constructed it. It is hypothesized that the hookbill laid two to three eggs and that its young were altricial.|$|E

5|$|Throughout September and October 1944, the First Canadian Army <b>moved</b> <b>along</b> {{the coast}} of France {{with the aim of}} {{securing}} the Channel Ports. On 1September, while the 3rd Division made for Boulogne and Calais, the 2nd Division entered Dieppe, encountering virtually no resistance. Five days later they were tasked by Montgomery and Crerar with retaking Dunkirk. Heavy fighting around the outskirts would hold the division for several days but, by 9September, the 5th Brigade had captured the port. The Dunkirk perimeter was handed over to the British on 15September, and the 2nd Division made for Antwerp.|$|E
5|$|After moving ashore, {{the storm}} quickly {{weakened}} into a tropical depression while crossing the Yucatán Peninsula. Late on July19, it emerged into the Bay of Campeche. It {{turned to the}} northwest due to a ridge moving eastward, and the system re-intensified into a tropical storm on July 21. At around 0800 UTC on July 23, the storm moved ashore on Matagorda Bay in southeastern Texas with winds of about 45 mph (75 km/h). The storm again weakened to a tropical depression shortly after landfall, before turning {{to the north and}} north-northeast. On July 24, the cyclone began interacting with a cold front, and became extratropical. It tracked slowly eastward across eastern Texas and northern Louisiana due to a high pressure area to the north. It later <b>moved</b> <b>along</b> the Mississippi River, and early on July 27, the front absorbed the depression along the border of Arkansas and Mississippi.|$|E
5|$|Aristotle, {{a student}} of Plato, {{observed}} an occultation of Mars by the Moon in 365 BCE. From this he concluded that Mars must lie further from the Earth than the Moon. He noted that other such occultations of stars and planets had been observed by the Egyptians and Babylonians. Aristotle used this observational {{evidence to support the}} Greek sequencing of the planets. His work De Caelo presented a model of the universe in which the Sun, Moon, and planets circle about the Earth at fixed distances. A more sophisticated version of the geocentric model was developed by the Greek astronomer Hipparchus when he proposed that Mars <b>moved</b> <b>along</b> a circular track called the epicycle that, in turn, orbited about the Earth along a larger circle called the deferent.|$|E

5|$|Because The Assayer {{contains}} such {{a wealth}} of Galileo's ideas on how science should be practised, it {{has been referred to}} as his scientific manifesto. Early in 1619, Father Grassi had anonymously published a pamphlet, An Astronomical Disputation on the Three Comets of the Year 1618, which discussed the nature of a comet that had appeared late in November of the previous year. Grassi concluded that the comet was a fiery body which had <b>moved</b> <b>along</b> a segment of a great circle at a constant distance from the earth, and since it moved in the sky more slowly than the moon, it must be farther away than the moon.|$|E
5|$|By 1907, new {{university}} buildings completely {{surrounded the}} observatory; {{dust from the}} construction clogged meteorological instruments, and at night electric lighting made astronomical work impossible. The Meteorological Office decided to abandon the site and {{move to a new}} building {{at the north end of}} campus on Bloor Street, trading the original Observatory to the University in exchange for the new parcel of land. There was some discussion regarding what to do with the Cooke telescope, since the Meteorological Office had little use for this purely astronomical instrument. No other use was immediately forthcoming, and the telescope <b>moved</b> <b>along</b> with the Meteorological Office to their new Bloor Street Observatory.|$|E
5|$|Early on September 21, {{the motion}} {{shifted to the}} north as it <b>moved</b> <b>along</b> the {{northwest}} periphery of the subtropical ridge. That general motion continued throughout the day, however, Helene began to turn more northeastward that evening {{along the edge of}} the subtropical ridge, east of Bermuda. A decrease in wind shear and relatively warm water around 81°F (27°C) kept the intensity mostly stationary, keeping Helene as a Category1 hurricane. The intensity held around 80mph (130km/h) before strengthening slightly late on September 22, despite losing some tropical characteristics (it was operationally downgraded to a tropical storm for a brief period) as it accelerated northeast in the north Atlantic. A QuikSCAT analysis early on September 23 confirmed a high-end Category1 hurricane with 90mph (145km/h) winds.|$|E
