40|$|A {{total of}} 370 ticks, {{encompassing}} 7 species from 4 genera, were collected during 2002 – 2006 from domestic animals and vegetation in the Taza region of northeastern Morocco. Rickettsial DNA was identifi ed in 101 ticks (27 %) by sequencing PCR products of {{fragments of the}} citrate synthase and outer membrane protein genes of Rickettsia spp. Seven rickettsiae of the spotted fever group were identifi ed, including 4 pathogens: R. aeschlimannii in Hyalomma marginatum marginatum, R. massiliae in Rhipicephalus sanguineus, R. slovaca in Dermacentor marginatus, and R. monacensis in Ixodes ricinus. Two suspected pathogens were also detected (R. raoultii in D. marginatus and R. helvetica in I. ricinus). An incompletely described Rickettsia sp. was detected in Haemaphysalis spp. ticks. Tick-borne rickettsioses are infections caused by obligate intracellular gram-negative bacteria of the spotted fever group (SFG) in the genus Rickettsia and the order Rickettsiales. These zoonoses are now recognized as emerging vector-borne infections worldwide (1, 2). They share characteristic clinical features, including fever, headache, rash, and occasional eschar formation {{at the site of}} the tick bite. Although these diseases have been known for a long time, they have been poorly investigated in northern Africa, including Morocco (2). Two human tick-borne SFG rickettsioses are known to occur in <b>Morocco.</b> <b>Mediterranean</b> spotted fever, caused by Rickettsia conorii conorii, is transmitted by the brown dog tick, Rhipicephalus sanguineus, which is well adapted to urban environments and is endemic to the Mediterranean area (2).

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the attempts by developed nations to control illegal immigration, especially {{the escalation of}} illiberal measures that endanger {{the lives of those}} attempting to cross borders illegally. The primary example is the American fence that is being extended and reinforced to guard the border with Mexico, but other nations have taken to fence building too. For example, Spain has a fence around its enclave on <b>Morocco's</b> <b>Mediterranean</b> coast. The building of border fences within national territories, with the proliferation of prison camps for asylum seekers and suspected illegal immigrants, has become a feature of European immigration practices. 	The essay argues that no coherent liberal and ethical justification for such practices is available. The only consistent position is 'liberal realism', the claim that liberal freedoms and institutions work to the benefit of members of the liberal nation state, and therefore it is in the interests of those members to protect these freedoms and institutions from any threat posed to them by potential migrants, even if that protection has to be oppressive and potentially fatal in order to be effective. However, this is not an ethical position, and may not be a liberal one. 	There is, in addition, a fundamental and practical flaw in the liberal realist argument: the fact that these oppressive measures are not effective. All the evidence suggests that extending and reinforcing the American fence will not effect the flow of illegal migration from Mexico into the United States. The focus on border enforcement by the governments of developed nations is a mixture of political opportunism and symbolism, as they offer their electorates the illusion that the integrity of the liberal interior can be protected from the 'corrupting' influences of the illiberal exterior...|$|R

Results reveal two main groups of ages, namely Permian-Carboniferous (285 - 330 Ma) and early Miocene (20 Ma) matching a higher- and a lower-pressure episodes, respectively, at high temperature (c. 800 ºC). The combination of these estimates with the petrological, geophysical and geodynamical studies in the area give us new clues to constrain the geodynamic evolution of the region from Permian-Carboniferous to Jurassic times, being that from 140 Ma to recent widely accepted by previous tectonic proposals.
