5|$|Farming and {{forestry}} {{are other}} important industries. 2008 {{plans for a}} large salmon farm holding 800,000 or <b>more</b> <b>fish</b> in Lamlash Bay have been criticised by the Community of Arran Seabed Trust. They feared the facility could jeopardise Scotland's first marine No Take Zone, which was announced in September 2008.|$|E
5|$|<b>More</b> <b>fish</b> {{have been}} {{discovered}} in the newly daylighted section of the river. Baby eastern blacknose dace and tessellated darter have been spotted in the river in addition to trout. In addition, wood frogs, eastern painted turtles, and redbreast sunfish live in the river too. All of these species have been hurt by the industrialization of the river.|$|E
5|$|Individual sharks choose sites {{giving them}} the best ambush success. They prefer {{junctions}} of sandy and rocky substrates near reefs (used by many fishes for shelter) usually orienting themselves either toward or parallel to nearby vertical structures. They tend to face upslope, which may facilitate burying via falling sediment, bring <b>more</b> <b>fish</b> swimming downstream from the reef, or ease targeting by silhouetting prey against the sunlight.|$|E
50|$|A {{group of}} 6 fishes will feel {{comfortable}} in a 15 gallon tank, but a bigger tank (preferably 30 gallons) and <b>more</b> <b>fishes</b> are recommended.|$|R
50|$|The {{range of}} some sub-Arctic fish stocks {{is likely to}} extend into Arctic areas due to climate change, and {{decreasing}} ice-cover will likely lead to <b>more</b> <b>fishing</b> activity.|$|R
50|$|When the villagers, {{fishermen}} and local fisheries officials {{discovered that the}} sanctuary attracted <b>more</b> and <b>more</b> <b>fishes,</b> the entire 3 km shoreline and 300 m fronting the shores have been declared a protected area.|$|R
5|$|Other dams have impeded fish passage at {{one time}} or another between the William L. Jess Dam and Grants Pass. After decades of {{controversy}} about water rights, costs, migratory fish, and environmental impacts, removal or modification of remaining middle-reach dams as well as a partly finished dam on Elk Creek, a major tributary of the Rogue, began in 2008. The de-construction projects were all meant to improve salmon runs by allowing <b>more</b> <b>fish</b> to reach suitable spawning grounds.|$|E
5|$|If we want <b>more</b> <b>fish,</b> {{we should}} shift that {{person who has}} a {{comparative}} advantage in fish hunting (i.e. Friday) out of coconut gathering and into fish hunting. When Friday is producing 96 pounds of fish, he is fully occupied. If fish production is to be increased beyond this point, Crusoe will have to start hunting fish. Here onward, {{the slope of the}} joint PPF is -2. If we want to produce only fish, then the economy will have 144 pounds of fish, 48 from Crusoe and 96 from Friday. Thus the joint PPF is kinked because Crusoe and Friday have comparative advantages in different commodities. As the economy gets more and more ways of producing output and different comparative advantages, the PPF becomes concave.|$|E
25|$|In addition, salmon require {{nutritional}} intakes of protein, protein {{which is}} often supplied {{to them in the}} form of fish meal as the lowest cost alternative protein. Consequently, farmed salmon consume <b>more</b> <b>fish</b> than they generate as a final product.|$|E
50|$|The {{origin of}} the name Sagiada is most {{probably}} arabic, meaning a place where fish is in abundance. There are two <b>more</b> <b>fishing</b> towns with the same name; a Sayada in Tunisia and a Sayada in Algeria.|$|R
60|$|I did inform his Majesty, and in double-quick {{time our}} friend Imbozwi was once <b>more</b> <b>fished</b> {{out of a}} grave by the strong arms of Babemba and his soldiers, and dragged into the {{presence}} of the irate Bausi.|$|R
50|$|Darling {{supported}} the British suggestions granting the French <b>more</b> <b>fishing</b> rights in waters of Newfoundland between Cape St. John and Cape Ray {{to the total}} disagreement of the Newfoundland government which ultimately lead {{to the end of}} his term in office.|$|R
25|$|You are {{catching}} the fish {{one by one}} with a fishing rod. You have decided to catch n fish. You are determined to catch exactly n fish regardless of how long time it may take. You are stopping after you have caught n fish even {{if you can see}} <b>more</b> <b>fish</b> that are tempting you.|$|E
25|$|Hainkel, {{although}} {{a graduate of}} Tulane University, also took {{a special interest in}} Southeastern Louisiana University, which, as a public institution, he represented as state senator. His Senate District 6 straddled Lake Pontchartrain, causing Hainkel to quip that he represented <b>more</b> <b>fish</b> than people. Hainkel originated the Pontchartrain Cup, a trophy traded between Tulane and Southeastern on the basis of which team wins the annual baseball game.|$|E
25|$|Overfishing {{occurs when}} <b>more</b> <b>fish</b> are caught than the {{population}} can replace through natural reproduction. Gathering as many fish as possible {{may seem like}} a profitable practice, but overfishing has serious consequences. The results not only affect the balance of life in the oceans, but also the social and economic well-being of the coastal communities who depend on fish for their way of life.|$|E
50|$|Many of Lussenburg's {{paintings}} {{show the}} rough {{waves of the}} shallow Zuiderzee with one or <b>more</b> <b>fishing</b> sailing boats in action. Beside his paintings of fishing vessels at sea, he also painted portraits of old fishermen, farmers, beggars, and some self-portraits.|$|R
50|$|The glass bloodfin tetra is a {{community}} tank fish that will do best {{in a group of}} 8-10 or <b>more</b> <b>fishes.</b> A well plated aquarium with volume of 15 Gallons (57 L) would make a great home for this species.|$|R
50|$|It {{was founded}} 36 {{years ago and}} now organizes <b>more</b> than 10 <b>fishing</b> tournaments each year, ranking as the {{association}} that makes <b>more</b> sport <b>fishing</b> events in Latin America.|$|R
25|$|Oxygen {{exchange}} at {{the surface}} is an important constraint, and thus the surface area of the aquarium matters. Some aquarists claim that a deeper aquarium holds no <b>more</b> <b>fish</b> than a shallower aquarium with the same surface area. The capacity can be improved by surface movement and water circulation such as through aeration, which not only improves oxygen exchange, but also waste decomposition rates.|$|E
25|$|In antiquity, most meat in Korea {{was likely}} {{obtained}} through hunting and fishing. Ancient records indicate rearing of livestock began {{on a small}} scale during the Three Kingdoms period. Meat was consumed roasted or in soups or stews during this period. Those who lived closer to the oceans were able to complement their diet with <b>more</b> <b>fish,</b> while those who lived in the interior had a diet containing more meat.|$|E
25|$|Namibia is {{the only}} country in the Southern Hemisphere culling seals. Although the {{protection}} and the sustainable use of natural resources is part of Namibia's constitution, it claims to conduct the second largest seal harvest in the world, mainly because of the huge amount of fish seals are estimated to consume. While a government-initiated study found seal colonies consume <b>more</b> <b>fish</b> than the entire fishing industry can catch, animal protection society Seal Alert South Africa estimated less than 0.3% losses to commercial fisheries.|$|E
500|$|At {{the end of}} June 2014, Rivers joined lawmakers {{including}} Lieutenant Governor Brad Owen on a state {{trade mission}} to Taiwan. Rivers' district sells <b>more</b> <b>fishing</b> licenses {{than any other in}} the state and she would like “to promote our area as a destination for sport fishing.” ...|$|R
50|$|The {{range of}} some sub-Arctic fish stocks {{is likely to}} extend into Arctic areas due to climate change, and {{decreasing}} ice-cover will likely lead to <b>more</b> <b>fishing</b> activity. Scientific understanding of Arctic fish populations is limited {{and needs to be}} studied before increased Arctic fishing occurs.|$|R

25|$|Including fish as {{a regular}} part of a {{balanced}} diet has been shown to help the symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis – a painful condition that causes joints to swell up, reducing strength and mobility. Studies also show that sufferers feel less stiff and sore in the morning if they keep their fish oil intake topped up. Recent research has also found a link between omega-3 fats and a slowing down in the wearing of cartilage that leads to osteoarthritis, opening the door for more research into whether eating <b>more</b> <b>fish</b> could help prevent the disease.|$|E
25|$|At the Institute for Marine Mammal Studies in Mississippi, it {{has also}} been {{observed}} that the resident dolphins seem to show an awareness of the future. The dolphins are trained to keep their own tank clean by retrieving rubbish and bringing it to a keeper, to be rewarded with a fish. However, one dolphin, named Kelly, has apparently learned a way to get <b>more</b> <b>fish,</b> by hoarding the rubbish under a rock {{at the bottom of the}} pool and bringing it up one small piece at a time.|$|E
25|$|Japanese cuisine {{is heavily}} {{dependent}} on seafood products. Compared to other developed countries, the Japanese eat <b>more</b> <b>fish</b> than any of them, consuming about 27 kilograms of seafood per capita annually. An aspect of environmental concern is Japanese appetite for seafood, which might lead to depletion of natural ocean resources through overfishing. For example, Japan consumes 80% of the global supply of blue fin tuna, a popularly sought sushi and sashimi ingredient, which might lead to its extinction due to commercial overfishing. Another environmental concern is commercial whaling and the consumption of whale meat, since Japan is the world's largest market of whale meat.|$|E
50|$|The bay hosts a large {{fleet of}} fishing boats which {{operates}} off the beach. Many organizations donated boats after the tsunami {{and as a}} result there are far <b>more</b> <b>fishing</b> boats than ever before. The main beach is a bit dirty, compared to nearby beaches which are rather more aesthetically pleasing and also have excellent waves.|$|R
60|$|There is no spot in {{the world}} where you can get <b>more</b> <b>fishing,</b> or where you can fish for a longer period. Some {{fishermen}} come here and fish for a day, and others stop and fish for a month. You can hang on and fish for a year, if you want to: it will be all the same.|$|R
50|$|A 2006 {{study found}} that {{there are at least}} 1200 species of venomous <b>fish.</b> There are <b>more</b> venomous <b>fish</b> than venomous snakes. In fact, there are <b>more</b> venomous <b>fish</b> than the {{combined}} total of all other venomous vertebrates. Venomous fish are found in almost all habitats around the world, but mostly in tropical waters. They wound over 50,000 people every year.|$|R
25|$|Salmon are carnivorous. They are fed a meal {{produced}} from catching other wild {{fish and other}} marine organisms. Salmon farming leads to a high demand for wild forage fish. Salmon require large nutritional intakes of protein, and farmed salmon consume <b>more</b> <b>fish</b> than they generate as a final product. To produce one pound of farmed salmon, products from several pounds of wild fish are fed to them. As the salmon farming industry expands, it requires more wild forage fish for feed, {{at a time when}} 75% of the world's monitored fisheries are already near to or have exceeded their maximum sustainable yield. The industrial-scale extraction of wild forage fish for salmon farming affects the survivability of the wild predator fish which rely on them for food.|$|E
25|$|The {{blue runner}} is a fast-swimming {{predator}} which primarily takes small benthic fishes as prey in inshore waters. Studies on the species diet {{on both side}} of the Atlantic have shown similar results. A Puerto Rican study found the species supplements its fish dominated diet with crabs, shrimps, copepods and other small crustaceans. More detailed research in Cape Verde found as well as fish, blue runner take shrimp, prawns, lobsters, jellyfish and other small invertebrates. The diet of juveniles is more zooplankton dominated, with young fish predominantly taking cyclopoid and calanoid copepods, and gradually moving to a <b>more</b> <b>fish</b> based diet. Adult blue runner living offshore or aggregating around oil and gas platforms tend to have less fish in their diet, foraging extensively on larger zooplankton during the summer months, with larval decapods and stomatopods, hyperiid amphipods, pteropods, and larval and juvenile fishes also taken.|$|E
25|$|Nainoa Thompson recreated the 1976 {{voyage to}} Tahiti {{to become the}} first Native Hawaiian in modern times to {{navigate}} a canoe thousands of miles without instruments. Mau sailed as an observer. After 29 days at sea, before sighting Mataiva on the way to Tahiti, Mau offered Nainoa only one correction; of Nainoa's interpretation of sighting a land-based seabird in mid-morning flight. Such birds generally fly seaward for food at morning and return to land in the evening. While it can usually be assumed that land lies opposite the birds' morning flight direction, this bird spotted mid-morning (during nesting season), carried a fish in its beak. This detail suggested to Mau that the bird's morning flight was not away from land but toward it. The bird was not flying seaward to find <b>more</b> <b>fish,</b> but rather, was returning to land, to feed its young. Leading up to the voyage, an extensive, formal crew training program helped to ensure a safe voyage. Escort boat Ishka followed for safety.|$|E
50|$|There are two {{different}} types of walkaround boats, those produced by production boat manufacturers and those built by custom & semi custom builders. Most of the production walkarounds have steps leading to the bow with a low gunnel giving more interior room. Custom & Semi-custom walkaround are <b>more</b> <b>fishing</b> oriented and have full gunnel depth {{all the way to the}} boat without stairs.|$|R
2500|$|Brazil has <b>more</b> {{freshwater}} <b>fish</b> species {{than any}} other country on earth, with the world's largest river basin, the Amazon, and the world's largest tropical floodplain, the Pantanal. In the Amazon River alone, there are an estimated 2,000 species of <b>fish,</b> <b>more</b> than all in North America.|$|R
500|$|Although the Flanders Flotilla sank 31 {{ships in}} August, UB-16 did not {{add to that}} total. In a four-day span in September, however, she {{accounted}} for three of the eight ships sunk by the flotilla during the month. On the 7th, she sank two <b>more</b> <b>fishing</b> smacks, Emblem and Victorious, [...] from Lowestoft. On 10 September, UB-16 sank the 51-ton Nimrod in the same vicinity.|$|R
