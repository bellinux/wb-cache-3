5|$|Bupropion, {{when used}} for {{treating}} obesity {{over a period}} of 6 to 12 months, may result in weight loss of 2.7kg over placebo. This is not <b>much</b> <b>different</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> weight loss produced by several other medications, such as sibutramine or orlistat. It has been studied in combination with naltrexone. Concerns from bupropion include an increase in blood pressure and heart rate. In September 2014, a combination (bupropion/naltrexone) was approved by the US FDA for the treatment of obesity.|$|E
5|$|The {{books are}} based on the vampire myth, but Twilight vampires differ in a number of {{particulars}} from the general vampire lore. For instance, Twilight vampires have strong piercing teeth rather than fangs; they glitter in sunlight rather than burn; and they can drink animal as well as human blood. Meyer comments that her vampire mythology differs from that of other authors because she wasn't informed about the canon vampires, saying, It wasn't until I knew that Twilight would be published that I began to think about whether my vampires were too much the same or too <b>much</b> <b>different</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> others. Of course, I was far too invested in my characters at that point to be making changes... so I didn't cut out fangs and coffins and so forth as a way to distinguish my vampires; that's just how they came to me.|$|E

25|$|When the Corfu {{started to}} be {{imported}} {{into the rest of}} Europe in 1785, the communities adherent through Ashkenazi tradition to the Genoese variety were very skeptical about it. The Ashkenazim assumed that since the Greek is so <b>much</b> <b>different</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Genoese, it might have been grafted or hybridized. At the beginning of the 19th century, when the Yanova Esrog was ceased due to the battles of Napoleon I of France, it really started to dominate the market.|$|E
25|$|Successful {{training}} of owls is <b>much</b> <b>different</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> {{training of}} hawks and falcons, {{as they are}} hearing- rather than sight-oriented (owls can only see black and white, and are long-sighted). This often leads falconers {{to believe that they}} are less intelligent, as they are distracted easily by new or unnatural noises and they do not respond as readily to food cues. However, if trained successfully, owls show intelligence on the same level as that of hawks and falcons.|$|E

Though ultimately owned by the state, Yugoslav companies were collectively managed by the employees themselves, much like in the Israeli kibbutz and the anarchist industrial cooperatives of Revolutionary Catalonia. The occupation and liberation struggle in World War II left Yugoslavia's infrastructure devastated. Even the most developed {{parts of the country}} were largely rural, and the little industry the country had was largely damaged or destroyed.|$|E

25|$|The 2016-17 Colts roster {{would look}} <b>much</b> <b>different</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> one the {{previous}} year. One hundred point scorers Kevin Labanc and Andrew Magiapane {{had moved on}} to their respective AHL and NHL clubs. Mackenzie Blackwood would not return in goal. Also not returning was defensemen Michael Webster, Rasmus Andersson and Greg DiTomasso, and forwards Justin Scott, Keigan Goetz, Dylan Sadoway, and Julius Nattinen. The youth movement was on, as signaled by the blockbuster trade made preseason where the Colts sent a package including 10 draft picks to the Mississauga Steelheads in exchange for 16-year old Russian Kirill Niznikov. The Colts season would be a tough one, having them spend {{the majority of the}} year in the basement of the league. Come trade deadline the Colts were active, trading captain Cordell James to the Owen Sound Attack, Cameron Lizotte to the Erie Otters, and Barrie native Matt Brassard to the Oshawa Generals while acquiring Robert Proner and Jason Smith from the Saginaw Spirit and Mississauga Steelheads. The Colts would finish off the year with the youngest roster in the OHL and finishing last place overall in the league. A number one overall draft pick was in their future.|$|E
25|$|The current two-star flag of Syria {{was first}} adopted by Gamal Abd al-Nasser, {{president}} of Egypt {{and president of}} the United Arab Republic. The flag was changed from the former independence flag in April 1958 along with associated laws designed to create a greater Arab identity. The new flag took the coloured red-white-black bands from the Arab Liberation flag and the stars on the flag were changed from red to green in order to restore the pan-Arab colours. The two stars represented Egypt and Syria. After Syria left the UAR on 28 September 1961, the previous independence flag was readopted to disassociate Syria from the failed union. The first flag of Syria to be adopted by its Revolutionary Command Council — following a Ba'athist coup d'état — was adopted on 8 March 1963, and was used until 1 January 1972. In 1963, the Ba'athist regime came to power in Iraq as well, and the two Ba'athis governments began negotiations in Cairo in order to once again form a union between Egypt, Syria and Iraq. The process failed after the Iraqi Ba'athist government was overthrown in November 1963 but both Syria and Iraq did adopt a new flag to represent the union. This flag was not <b>much</b> <b>different</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> flag of the UAR, with only a change from two stars to three, in order to represent the addition of Iraq to the Federation. The three stars represented the unity of Egypt, Syria and Iraq, as well as three pillars of Ba'athism: unity, freedom, and socialism. President Hafez al-Assad adopted the new flag on 1 January 1972, as Syria joined Egypt and Libya in the Federation of Arab Republics. The green stars were replaced by the Hawk of Quraish (the symbol of the tribe of the Prophet Muhammad). The eagle held the ribbon with name of the Federation, but unlike Egypt and Libya, Syria did not include its name on the coat of arms. This flag was an official flag during the October War in 1973. The Federation was dissolved in 1977, but Syria continued to use the flag for the next three years. The flag was abrogated on 29 March 1980, and replaced by the current two-star flag in order to show Syria's commitment to Arab unity.|$|E
500|$|The album {{received}} a similar critical response to Out of Exile {{with the majority}} of reviewers praising the band's integrity on the record. The new funk and soul influences were also welcomed favorably; Allmusic called the album Audioslave's [...] "most colorful, diverse, and consistent record yet." [...] Many others, however, saw it as [...] "just another rock record," [...] and musically not <b>much</b> <b>different</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> previous album.|$|E

50|$|Due to {{the hassle}} {{involved}} in producing an album under one's own label, the Ed Palermo Big Band did not release another album until a record company showed interest.

25|$|The album's {{recording}} was a <b>much</b> <b>different</b> affair <b>from</b> <b>the</b> first two—likely {{because of}} the band's constantly changing dynamic. The traditional country {{of the first two}} albums, especially Faithless, was largely replaced with a more sophisticated country-rooted pop sound, very similar to Wilco's 1999 album Summerteeth. Also adding to the different flavor of the album was a cast of guest stars, including The Replacements' Tommy Stinson and The Smashing Pumpkins' James Iha.|$|R

He was never happy with the position and resigned {{as chairman of the}} RDB after a year, but remained on the oversight committee.

500|$|The Confederate {{point of}} view for the battle was <b>much</b> <b>different</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> reports of the Union officers. Confederate General Jones {{reported}} [...] "The information I have is that the expedition started from Kanawha 1,200 or 1,300 strong, and that when it reached Fayetteville, on the return, it numbered but 500, only 300 of whom were mounted. The commander (Colonel Toland) and several other officers were killed, the second in command, Colonel Powell, and other officers wounded and captured. They admit a loss of more than 60 killed and wounded; it was probably much greater. Their dead bodies were scattered along the roads and mountain paths. [...] Our loss, as reported to me, was 1 captain and 5 men killed, and about double that number wounded." [...] The Reverend J. M. Wharey, who fought as a citizen of Wytheville during the raid, wrote [...] "...there was no telling what damage they would have done. Had Colonel Toland lived, the lead mines, the salt works, and the railroad bridges near Wytheville {{would have been at}} their mercy. So our little battle disconcerted their plans and the raid was a complete failure." ...|$|E

500|$|Amanita sinicoflava (occurring in North America) looks quite similar, {{but it has}} a sack-like volva, unlike A.ceciliae. A.antillana, of the Antilles islands, is {{somewhat}} the same, but it has ellipsoid spores unlike the spherical ones of A.ceciliae. A.ceciliae is often used as a misnomer for A.borealisorora, which largely occurs in North America. A.borealisorora is a provisional name, and the species has not yet been validly published. The spores of A.ceciliae highly resemble those of A.cinctipes (mainly found in Singapore), though the former has larger spores. The discolouration in the volva of A.colombiana (from Colombia, as its name states) probably shows a relationship between the mushroom and A.ceciliae. A.sorocula is another lookalike. This Colombian and Mesoamerican species is often mistaken for A.ceciliae, as both mushrooms have a volva with a weak structure and greying gills. [...] The notable difference is the strong yellow colour of the cap in immature A.ceciliae mushrooms. A.sorocula is not yet validly published, and currently is a newly accepted name. The Chinese species A.liquii is similar but the yellow-brown, red-brown or green-brown coloured cap of A.ceciliae are <b>much</b> <b>different</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> brown-black cap of A.liquii. Also, the volval remnants of A.ceciliae converge at the base to form a ring-like zone, unlike A.liquii. Apart from this, the cellular pigments in the sterile strip around the gills and volval remnants are much darker in colour compared to A.ceciliae.|$|E
