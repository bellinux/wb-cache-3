2500|$|Whitewater kayaks {{differ from}} sea kayaks and {{recreational}} kayaks {{in that they}} are better specialized to deal with moving water. [...] They are often shorter and more maneuverable than sea kayaks and are specially designed to deal with water flowing up onto their decks. Most whitewater kayaks are <b>made</b> <b>of</b> <b>plastics</b> these days, although some paddlers (especially racers and [...] "squirt boaters") use kayaks made of fiberglass composites. Whitewater kayaks are fairly stable in turbulent water, once the paddler is skillful with them; if flipped upside-down, the skilled paddler can easily roll them back upright. This essential skill of whitewater kayaking is called the [...] "Eskimo Roll", or simply [...] "Roll." [...] Kayaks are paddled in a low sitting position (legs extended forward), with a two-bladed paddle. See Whitewater kayaking.|$|E

Decades later he filed a patent for a mechanism for cross-cutting films as well as other related inventions.|$|E
50|$|The {{building}} materials for earth sheltered construction {{tend to be}} of non-biodegradable substances. Because the materials must keep water out, they are often <b>made</b> <b>of</b> <b>plastics.</b> Concrete is another material that is used in great quantity. More sustainable products are being tested to replace the cement within concrete (such as fly ash), as well as alternatives to reinforced concrete (see more under Materials: Structural). The excavation of a site is also drastically time- and labor-consuming. Overall, the construction is comparable to conventional construction, because the building requires minimal finishing and significantly less maintenance.|$|E

50|$|The largest end use {{market for}} {{packaging}} raw materials is the beverage industry. While plastics and flexibles represent the largest share of used material for non-alcoholic beverages, alcoholic beverages heavily rely on metals (foremost aluminum) and glass. Meat and vegetables also heavily favor packaging <b>made</b> <b>of</b> <b>plastics</b> or flexibles. The chemical and agricultural sectors predominantly use plastics and metals {{due to their}} products requiring packaging with high durability. Low production costs are another important factor in explaining the popularity of plastics and flexibles in the Brazilian packaging sector.|$|E
