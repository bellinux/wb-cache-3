The increasing demands for interoperability pushed the international standardization organizations to develop standards for e-mail. the multimedia e-mail related standards include X. 400 and ODA. ODA supports formatted text, raster graphics, and geometric graphics. the future standards {{will be able}} to support high bandwidth uses such a high-resolution color still-image, full-motion video, voice and audio. The future components of multimedia e-mail include TIFF for raster graphics, CGM for geometric graphics, JPEG for high resolution color still-image, and MPEG for full-motion video. These multimedia data require vast amounts of storage, processing time, and transmission bandwidth. The standardization efforts can be viewed as selecting the best combination of these three factors, interoperability, and timing consideration. According to this view, the standard for each component is reviewed with frame of background, coding, compression, and current status. With the information from the survey study, a simulation study is conducted to investigate the performance of LAN where multimedia data are transmitted. The simulation results show that the high resolution image browsing activity in a LAN will burden to low speed LANs.

40|$|Muhimedia {{communications}} embraces a {{range of}} applications and networking infrastructures. The term multimedia is used {{to indicate that the}} information/data relating to an application may be composed of a number of different tj^es are text, images, speech, audio and video and some example applications are video telephony (speech and video), <b>multimedia</b> <b>electronic</b> <b>mail</b> (text, images and audio), interactive television (text, audio and video), electronic commerce (text, images, audio and video), Web TV (text, audio and video) and many others. The current hitemet, based on packet switched hitemet Protocol (IP), {{has been described as a}} "Best-Effort" delivery system, as it provides no guarantees for the delivery of packets from a source to the destination. The design philosophy, at that time, had been largely focused on only one media-type, i. e. text, and all the efforts were spent in providing an error-free, highly flexible means of communication. However with advances in technology, it has become evident that the Internet now needs to support other media types like audio and video. These new media types have certain real-time aspects for which the best-effort Intemet is not well-suited. With the Internet expansion, real-time transmission over Intemet is becoming a new promising application. Successfiil real-time communication over IP networks requires reasonably reliable, low delay, low loss date transport. Since hitemet is a nonsynchronous packet switching network, high load and lack of guarantees on data delivery make real-time communication such as Voice and Video over IP a challenging application to become realistic on the Intemet. IP networks are on a steep slope of iimovation that will make them the long-term carrier of all types of traffic, including multimedia. However, such networks are not designed to support real-time multimedia communication because their variable characteristics (e. g. due to delay, delay variation and packet loss) lead to deterioration 1 in multimedia quality. A major challenge in such networks is how to measure or predict multimedia quality accurately and efficiently for QoS monitoring and/or control purposes to ensure that technical and commercial requirements are met. Multimedia quality can be measured using either subjective or objective methods. Subjective measurement (e. g. SSCQE, DSIS) is the benchmark for objective methods, but it is slow, time consuming and expensive. Objective measurement (e. g. PSNE) is more accurate, but normally is unsuitable for monitoring live traffic because of the need for a reference data and to utilize the network. This makes other objective methods (e. g. MSE) more attractive for monitoring multimedia quality from IP network impairments. However, current objective methods rely on subjective tests to derive model parameters and as a result are limited and do not meet new and emerging applications. iiSchool of Computing, Communications and Electronic...|$|E

Thus, it rises the writer's curiosity on the characteristics of the <b>electronic</b> <b>mail</b> discourse in the e-mail of Petra Christian University's Webmaster, the characteristic of the <b>electronic</b> <b>mail</b> discourse that mostly occurs in the e-mail of Petra Christian University's Webmaster, and the type of discourse that is mostly performed in the <b>electronic</b> <b>mail</b> discourse characteristics. In order to come to the findings, the writer uses the theory of Brown and Yule (1983), McMurdo (1995), Krol (1994), Sims (1996), Goodman and Graddol (1996), Hightower and Sayeed (1996), Jacobson (1996), Cicourel (1973), and Ong (1982), that are about <b>electronic</b> <b>mail</b> discourse. The writer's research uses both descriptive and qualitative method in analyzing the data. The writer uses both methods, since she wants to find out and describe the characteristics of <b>electronic</b> <b>mail</b> discourse. The data she used are English e-mails that are sent to Petra Christian University's Webmaster. Then, the data are categorized based on the characteristics of written and spoken discourse. The writer analyzes the postings and finds that there are eleven characteristics that are complete sentences (47), syntactic devices (26), incomplete sentences (24), lower-case letters (24), incomplete words (18), misspelling words (15), upper-case letters (5), emoticons (4), repeated letters (3), explicit statements (2), and filler (1) appearing at <b>electronic</b> <b>mail</b> discourse.

The position of <b>electronic</b> <b>mail</b> discourse characteristics above may happen only in the analysis of postings that are sent to Petra Christian University's Webmaster.

The concept of <b>electronic</b> <b>mail</b> is fairly straightforward. <b>Electronic</b> <b>mail</b> systems allow creation and transmission of messages which can be addressed to an individual or select groups of individuals.

However, the technology and variety of types and levels of electronic messaging is much more complex. For background information, consider Trudell et al.
