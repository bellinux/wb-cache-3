50|$|When {{parts of}} Germany {{were given to}} Poland after World War II, {{including}} the area around Selbongen, the local branch there remained active, the only unit of the Church in Poland at the time. Services continued {{to be held in}} German until this practice was forbidden by the Polish government in 1947. After members acquired enough Polish to hold services in that language, <b>meetings</b> were <b>resumed.</b> <b>The</b> Church was officially registered with the Polish authorities in 1961.|$|R
50|$|Taking {{up most of}} the {{property}} is the meeting's cemetery, which contains many graves of its members from the earlier years, along with that of Robert Capa, the accomplished mid-century war photographer, and his brother Cornell, although neither were members of the meeting, much less Quakers. The headstones of those graves strongly reflect Quaker burial practices, and thus the cemetery is included in the listing as a contributing resource. An architecturally sympathetic First Day School building added when <b>meetings</b> <b>resumed</b> in <b>the</b> 1970s is non-contributing due to its newness.|$|R
50|$|In 1962, {{after the}} BBWAA had {{selected}} {{no one in}} the 1958 and 1960 elections, the BBWAA ballot would have a second run-off election of the top vote-getters if there were no selection, and <b>the</b> Veterans Committee <b>resumed</b> <b>meeting</b> annually. <b>The</b> Veterans Committee selected Edd Roush and Bill McKechnie.|$|R

50|$|The South African Rugby League {{came close}} to total collapse; the board however regrouped and contact <b>resumed</b> with <b>the</b> RFL. Following the regrouping, the board held a fully {{democratic}} annual general <b>meeting.</b> Contact <b>resumed</b> with <b>the</b> RFL, through Maurice Lindsay who supported SARLs ambitions to enter the 1996 student world cup, which SARL had planned {{to use as a}} vehicle for reestablishing the ailing SARL and its clubs to its former more stable self.

5000|$|In 1897 the Newcastle Municipal Council had <b>resumed</b> <b>meeting</b> at <b>the</b> Mechanics' Institute. In May of {{that year}} the Mechanics' Institute Committee made {{additions}} to the building. [...] These {{are assumed to be}} the two side wings, and possibly also the current curved facade. In July another new hall was opened in the main street, constructed by the local lodge of the Order of Oddfellows.|$|R
50|$|The {{meeting was}} controversial. The notorious weather in Vojens struck {{and after the}} first round of heats the riders voted 14-2 not to return to the track due to the wet {{conditions}} (only track owner Olsen and Hans Nielsen wanted to continue). After a 90-minute delay the FIM referee threatened the riders with disqualification from the meeting if they did not continue racing. A compromise was eventually reached and the track was tested by two local junior riders, following which <b>the</b> <b>meeting</b> <b>resumed,</b> though <b>the</b> riders continued to voice their concerns led by Penhall despite he being the one rider who seemed {{to come to grips with}} the conditions, and six time World Champion Ivan Mauger. After the meeting both Penhall and Mauger publicly criticised the Polish referee on British television for not listening to the riders about the condition of the track, with Mauger claiming that the referee feigned not being able to speak English when he refused to speak to the riders (Mauger contended that he had dealt with this particular referee in the past and that he did indeed speak English).|$|R
50|$|By 1889, the United Brethren {{had grown}} to over 200,000 members with six bishops. In that same year they {{experienced}} a division. Denominational leaders desired to make three changes: to give local conferences proportional representation at the General Conference; to allow laymen to serve as delegates to General Conference; and to allow United Brethren members to hold membership in secret societies such as the Freemasons. The denominational leadership made these changes, but the minority felt the changes violated the constitution {{because they were not}} made by the majority vote of all United Brethren members. One of the bishops, Milton Wright (the father of aviation pioneers Wilbur Wright and Orville Wright), disagreed with the actions of the majority. Bishop Wright and other conference delegates left <b>the</b> <b>meeting</b> and <b>resumed</b> <b>the</b> session elsewhere. They believed that the other delegates had violated the constitution (and, in effect, withdrawn from the denomination), and deemed themselves to be the true United Brethren Church. Therefore, the body initially known as the United Brethren in Christ of the Old Constitution, now called the Church of the United Brethren in Christ.|$|R
5|$|The {{game was}} the 15th contest between Boston College and Virginia Tech and was their {{second of the}} 2007 season.

Between 1993 and 2003, Boston College and Virginia Tech played annually as part of their conference schedules. The teams did not meet in 2004 following Virginia Tech's move to the Atlantic Coast Conference.

50|$|By 1889, the United Brethren {{had grown}} to over 200,000 members with six bishops. In that same year they {{experienced}} a division. Denominational leaders desired to make three changes: to give local conferences proportional representation at the General Conference; to allow laymen to serve as delegates to General Conference; and to allow United Brethren members to hold membership in secret societies. However, the process for amending the Constitution at the time made it all but impossible to amend it. The denominational leadership made these changes, but the minority felt the changes violated the Constitution {{because they were not}} made by the majority vote of all United Brethren members. Milton Wright (the father of aviation pioneers Wilbur Wright and Orville Wright) {{was the only one of}} the church's six bishops to side with the minority. He and other conference delegates left <b>the</b> <b>meeting</b> and <b>resumed</b> <b>the</b> session elsewhere. They believed that the other delegates had violated the Constitution (and, in effect, withdrawn from the denomination), and deemed themselves to be the true United Brethren Church. Courts saw it differently. Most of the congregations that sided with Wright lost their property. Wright led this group—estimated at 10,000-20,000 constituents—in those early years as they reorganized. A new headquarters began taking shape in 1897 in Huntington, Ind., with the establishment of a publishing house, national offices, and Huntington College. Wright served as bishop until 1905.|$|R
