40|$|How do <b>museums</b> {{work with}} {{plurality}} in their organizations {{and in the}} production of exhibitions and other activities? This paper examines how civic <b>museums,</b> provincial <b>museums</b> and state <b>museums</b> work with plurality from a perspective of culture policies, particularly in relation to the government bill Tid för kultur, issued by the Swedish government in 2009. All together I examine 25 <b>museums</b> and their efforts to include marginalized groups in their activities and exhibitions. To do so I have studied four possible measures that are available for the <b>museums.</b> This includes the following: projects that pay attention to a marginalized group or their living conditions; projects that are specifically created for a marginalized group; projects that include a marginalized group in the <b>museums</b> preparations; and projects were <b>museums</b> give full responsibility to a marginalized group. I have also examined how plurality have been presented – as isolated cultures and cultural expressions or as hybrids and interchangeable phenomenons – and to what extent the <b>museums</b> are ready to involve marginalized groups in their physical environment and in their exhibition and activity programs. Based on three different levels of conduct I evaluate how far the <b>museums</b> have reached and what differences there are between civic <b>museums,</b> provincial <b>museums</b> and state <b>museums.</b> My research shows that Swedish <b>museums</b> in general {{are on their way to}} work successfully with plurality and establish a plurality perspective in the whole organization. The research also shows that there are differences between civic <b>museums,</b> provincial <b>museums</b> and state <b>museums.</b> In general, state <b>museums</b> are better to include marginalized groups in their productions and to firmly establish a perspective of plurality in their organization. On the contrary, the research shows that many <b>museums</b> lack certain features in their efforts to work towards a marginalized group. One of those features is the ability to make these efforts part of the <b>museums</b> permanent activities. Civic <b>museums</b> and provincial <b>museums</b> also have a greater freedom of strengthen their regional identity than compared to the state <b>museums</b> ability to strengthen the national identity. A circumstance that can have consequences for culture policies in Sweden and the future of plurality efforts at the <b>museums...</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract. <b>Museums</b> {{may serve}} as {{important}} amenities for inhabitants and act as magnets for attracting visitors to a city. For city planners {{it is important to}} understand what different types of <b>museums</b> there are in terms of attraction power, and how their attractiveness may depend on the presence of other <b>museums.</b> To this end, we propose a gravity model for all <b>museums</b> allowing for spatial dependence between <b>museums</b> to account for local competition or synergy effects. To address the likely heterogeneity in our sample of <b>museums,</b> we first adopt a spatial error component model. Thereafter, we model the variation between <b>museums</b> explicitly by segmenting the <b>museums</b> using a finite mixture approach. The application of this model uses a unique transaction database of the visiting behaviour of 80 821 persons to 108 Dutch <b>museums.</b> The results stress the large variation both in the spatial reach of <b>museums</b> and in their spatial context. ...|$|R

40|$|<b>Museums</b> are {{commonly}} viewed as uninteresting and boring environments where old and dusty objects are on display, an opinion that <b>museums</b> {{are struggling to}} change.
