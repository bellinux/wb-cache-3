5|$|The gadfly petrels in {{the genus}} Pterodroma are seabirds of {{temperate}} and tropical oceans. Many are little-known, and their often similar appearance {{have caused the}} taxonomy of the group to be rather fluid. The forms breeding in Macaronesia on Madeira, Bugio in the Desertas Islands, and in the Cape Verde archipelago were long considered to be subspecies of the Southern Hemisphere soft-plumaged petrel, P. <b>mollis,</b> but mitochondrial DNA analysis, and differences in size, vocalisations, breeding behaviour, showed that the northern birds are not closely related to P. <b>mollis,</b> and that the Bermuda petrel or Cahow may be the closest relative of the Macaronesian birds. Sangster recommended establishing Zino's petrel on Madeira and Fea's petrel on the Desertas and Cape Verde as full species, and the species split was accepted by the Association of European Rarities Committees (AERC) in 2003.|$|E
5|$|Almost {{immediately}} the Air Force was reduced from 290to 190fixed-wing aircraft and had five of its twelve bases closed. In 2002, the Armée XXI reforms continued {{the pattern of}} reduction, with bases at <b>Mollis,</b> Turtmann, and Interlaken closed, jets relocated out of Dübendorf (later planned for closing), and the helicopter base at Alpnach placed on the closure list. These closures left Payerne, Sion, and Meiringen as the only combat bases, Emmen as the main helicopter base, and Locarno as a training base. Buochs was maintained for war-time reactivation, and the theoretical plan for using highways near Payerne, Sion, and Lodrino as emergency runways was retained, although no pilots have been trained in their use since the mid-1980s.|$|E
5|$|Carrington Moss is a lowland raised bog. The area drains slowly, which {{slows the}} {{decomposition}} of plant life {{and leads to}} the accumulation of peat. Over thousands of years this raises the level of peat and forms a gently sloping dome (hence, raised). Such areas support {{a wide range of}} flora and fauna; Sphagnum balticum, a medium-sized bog moss, was recorded on Carrington Moss in the 1880s, although locally it is now presumed to be extinct. Lancashire- or bog asphodel (Narthecium ossifragum), white beak-sedge (Rhynchospora alba), cranberries, bog-rosemary (Andromeda polifolia), and the cotton sedge have also been recorded. In 1923 species of trees recorded by E. Price Evans for the Journal of Ecology included English oak (Quercus robur), and common ash (Fraxinus excelsior). Undergrowth included common hazel (Corylus avellana), blackberry (Rubus fruticosus), and European holly (Ilex aquifolium). Several species of ground vegetation included creeping soft grass (Holcus <b>mollis),</b> common bluebell (Hyacinthoides non-scripta), common foxglove (Digitalis purpurea), dog's mercury (Mercurialis perennis), iris (Iris pseudacorus), mad-dog weed (Alisma plantago-aquatica), and cat-o'-nine-tails (Typha latifolia).|$|E
25|$|Nepenthes <b>mollis</b> has {{no known}} natural hybrids. No infraspecific taxa {{of this species}} have been described. Nepenthes <b>mollis</b> has no {{nomenclatural}} or taxonomic synonyms. Its conservation status is listed as Data Deficient on the 2006 IUCN Red List of Threatened Species.|$|E
25|$|The {{identity}} of the specimens from G. Lumarku with N. <b>mollis</b> should be proven by comparison with authentic pitchered material from G. Kemul. Unless this is done, the data above cannot be taken as an emendation of Danser's original description of N. <b>mollis</b> but are only referring to north Bornean plants without doubt.|$|E

25|$|Coarse {{seashore}} {{grass or}} coarse grass, dune grass, beach grass Leymus <b>mollis</b> subsp. <b>mollis</b> (taperrnaq sg taperrnak dual taperrnat pl in Yup'ik and Cup'ik, taperrnar in Cup'ig) Yup’ik {{people use the}} leaves extensively to make mittens, socks, mats, and baskets. In former times, men wore grass socks and folded grass insoles inside their water boots; in cold weather sealskin socks were worn. Coarse grass, gathered in October, was used for insoles.|$|E
25|$|In living {{specimens}} of N. sp. {{the base of}} the leaf is petiolate in the lower 4-5 cm with the leaf edges curled upwards. When pressed they are flattened and the leaf is narrowly lanceolate as in Danser's drawing of N. <b>mollis.</b> The leaf-sheathing on pressed plants of N. sp. is also flattened and looks decurrent instead. Without reference to a living plant you would be none the wiser. Could this be the same with Danser's N. <b>mollis</b> specimen? The degree of supposed leaf decurrence and the bracts on the pedicels can be explained by natural variation within the range of this species. There are enough high mountains between those that contain N. sp. (G. Lumarku, G. Murud, Meligan Range) in the northwest and N. <b>mollis</b> (G. Kemul) in the southeast to provide a link between the two.|$|E

25|$|To {{bring these}} {{differences}} into perspective, {{remember that the}} differences above are both from pressed herbarium specimens and that Danser never saw a live specimen of N. <b>mollis.</b>|$|E
25|$|Danser's {{original}} {{description of}} N. <b>mollis</b> and all subsequent descriptions {{are based on}} the single specimen of this species deposited at the herbarium of the Bogor Botanical Gardens.|$|E
25|$|The type {{specimen}} of N. <b>mollis,</b> Endert 4282, is deposited at Herbarium Bogoriense (BO), the herbarium of the Bogor Botanical Gardens. It {{consists of a}} stem with leaves and a male inflorescence. The pitchers and female flowers of this species are unknown.|$|E
25|$|However, {{some authors}} {{consider}} the hypothesis equating these two species {{to be rather}} improbable. An editor's note by Jan Schlauer accompanying Salmon's article cautions that live specimens from the type locality of N. <b>mollis</b> must be examined before the two taxa are united.|$|E
25|$|The taxonomic {{place of}} N. ephippiata and N. <b>mollis</b> is uncertain, as the {{pitchers}} are unknown, but the coarse stems and leaves, the yellowish colour {{of the former}} and the abundant hirsute indumentum and red-brown colour of the latter leave hardly any doubt whether both are Regiae.|$|E
25|$|The {{habitat of}} N. <b>mollis</b> {{is listed as}} dense forest on a steep slope at an {{altitude}} of 1,800 m. The species is only known from Mount Kemul, the type locality, although a wider distribution is possible, as several higher neighbouring mountains remain unexplored. Charles Clarke suggests that it may occur in mossy forest.|$|E
25|$|Elias Magnus Fries first {{circumscribed}} Crepidotus in 1821 as a {{tribe in}} the genus Agaricus, although he later (1836–1838) revised his concept. In 1857, Staude elevated Tribus Crepidotus to a genus, with Agaricus <b>mollis</b> (Schaeff) as the type species. Early {{descriptions of the}} genus contained between six and forty-six species, depending on the author.|$|E
25|$|The {{unidentified}} {{species from}} Mount Lumarku was formally described as N. hurrelliana in 2003 by Martin Cheek and Anthony Lamb. Its natural range {{is now known}} to cover northern Sarawak, Brunei, and southwestern Sabah, although {{it has not been}} recorded from Kalimantan. If N. <b>mollis</b> and N. hurrelliana were shown to be conspecific, the latter would become a heterotypic synonym of the former.|$|E
25|$|Polyscias {{was then}} divided into 11 subgenera (Polyscias, Grotefendia, Maralia, Arthrophyllum, Cuphocarpus, Tetraplasandra, Eupteron, Sciadopanax, Tieghemopanax, Indokingia, and Palmervandenbroekia) and 7 species (Polyscias acuminata, Polyscias macdowallii, Polyscias <b>mollis,</b> Polyscias murrayi, Polyscias ledermannii, Polyscias pentamera, and Polyscias purpurea) {{were placed in}} Polyscias incertae sedis (not in any {{subgroup}} thereof). All of the species of the former Reynoldsia are now in Polyscias subgenus Tetraplasandra.|$|E
25|$|Nepenthes <b>mollis</b> {{has only}} been {{collected}} once, on October 17, 1925 by Frederik Endert on Mount Kemul in East Kalimantan. The plant was collected near {{the summit of the}} mountain, at an elevation of approximately 1,800 m. It was discovered during an expedition to central Borneo by the Forest Research Institute of Bogor (then known as Buitenzorg), on which Endert also collected N. fusca for the first time.|$|E
25|$|Wastefulness being disrespectful, Yup'ik elders {{made use}} of every last scrap from hunts and harvests: seal guts, skins of salmon fish, dried grasses such as Leymus <b>mollis</b> (coarse {{seashore}} grass). Traditionally, skins of birds, fish, and marine mammals such as seal and walrus, and land mammals were used to make clothing. Hunting clothes were designed to be insulated and waterproof. Fish skin and marine mammal intestines (guts) were used for waterproof shells (as gut parka) and boots. Dried grass was used to make insulating socks, and as a waterproof thread.|$|E
25|$|The word molly (also spelt as molley, mollie, mally) is a pet-form of {{the female}} {{forename}} Mary, and had two main connotations in 18th century English. The first one {{is close to the}} word moll, designating a lower-class girl or woman, occasionally a prostitute. The second one is classified as slang, defining an effeminate, usually homosexual, male. Along with the possible perception of intrinsic female features deriving from the association with the name Mary, another possible origin of this denomination for a homosexual man could be found in the Latin form <b>mollis,</b> indicating the supposed passive-effeminate partner in male homosexual relationships.|$|E
25|$|It is {{not easy}} finding a mate in this zone. Some species depend on bioluminescence. Others are hermaphrodites, which doubles their chances of {{producing}} both eggs and sperm when an encounter occurs. The female anglerfish releases pheromones to attract tiny males. When a male finds her, he bites on to her and never lets go. When a male of the anglerfish species Haplophryne <b>mollis</b> bites into {{the skin of a}} female, he release an enzyme that digests the skin of his mouth and her body, fusing the pair {{to the point where the}} two circulatory systems join up. The male then atrophies into nothing more than a pair of gonads. This extreme sexual dimorphism ensures that, when the female is ready to spawn, she has a mate immediately available.|$|E
25|$|By 2009, {{sufficient}} financing {{had been}} secured from investors, which {{allowed for the}} SH09 to be formally launched that year; accordingly, the helicopter was given the designation SKYe SH09 {{in reference to the}} year that development on the project officially commenced. A small number of staff worked on the project, initially being a team of nine; an emphasis was made on recruiting very high quality engineers, including from other rotorcraft manufacturers such as Airbus Helicopters; the company had over 100 employees in 2016. Company operations in Switzerland have been split between the towns of Pfäffikon, where is where design work is centered, and <b>Mollis,</b> at which assembly and flight testing operations is conducted; a third facility in Germany is tasked with compliance verification so that the SH09 can easily achieve its type certificate from the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA).|$|E
25|$|On 2 October 2014, P1 {{achieved}} a milestone {{for the project}} when it conducted its maiden flight from <b>Mollis</b> Airport. This first flight, lasting 20 minutes, was flown by chief test pilot Dwayne Williams. Stucki announced that the first flight had confirmed preliminary flight characteristics of the SH09. Commenting shortly after P1's maiden flight, the company stated that it was on schedule to receive EASA certification within the next 12-16 months. In summer 2015, Marenco halted flight tests after 100 flight hours to focus on producing the second prototype, P2, which incorporated a modified bearingless rotor head and new rotor blades to reduce vibrations. By September 2015, it was recognised that the original development timeline had been optimistic and that certification would take longer to achieve than had been originally announced. On 26 February 2016, P2 performed its first flight, piloted by new chief test pilot Richard Trueman. At this point, certification {{was expected to be}} achieved near to the end of 2016 or during early 2017.|$|E
25|$|Mucor plumbeus is {{distributed}} worldwide. Samples of M. plumbeus {{have been collected}} in numerous countries: {{as far north as}} Germany, Austria, Switzerland; as far east as Philippines, Indonesia; as far west as California and far south as South Africa. It is found in dust, soil and hypersaline water. Mucor plumbeus tolerates many soil types: including grassland, desert soils and heathland and has been isolated from the roots of alfalfa, oats, barley, Holcus <b>mollis</b> and other Australian heathland plants. In addition, it has been isolated from bird feathers, hay, decomposing plant debris, dung from different animals, fresh water, wood pulp, beech bark, wood timbers used in a copper mine, seeds of wheat and oat, and pecans. In the indoor built environment, M. plumbeus has been isolated from HVAC filters and has been detected in hospital air. In addition, M. plumbeus {{has been found to be}} associated with mould growth on concrete and other floor related materials and house dust. It is also known from foods such as meat, nuts and cereals, and has been isolated in low levels from black rice in Thailand, soybeans in the Philippines and from coriander in Indonesia.|$|E

500|$|Isopogon anethifolius {{is found}} only in New South Wales, where it occurs in the Sydney Basin and surrounds, from Braidwood northwards to Mount Coricudgy in Wollemi National Park. The annual {{rainfall}} in these areas ranges from 900 to 1600mm (35–60in). The species occurs naturally from sea level to 1200m (4000ft) altitude and is found on sandstone in heathland and dry sclerophyll woodland. [...] Typical trees it is associated with include the scribbly gums Eucalyptus haemastoma and E.sclerophylla and silvertop ash (E.sieberi), open forest plants such as soft geebung (Persoonia <b>mollis),</b> and heathland plants such as heath banksia (Banksia ericifolia), dwarf she-oak (Allocasuarina nana) and Wingello grevillea (Grevillea molyneuxii).|$|E
500|$|The Zino's petrel or freira (Pterodroma madeira) {{is a small}} seabird in the gadfly petrel genus {{which is}} endemic to the island of Madeira. This long-winged petrel has a grey back and wings, with a dark [...] "W" [...] marking across the wings, and a grey upper tail. The undersides of the wings are blackish apart from a {{triangle}} of white at the front edge near the body, and the belly is white with grey flanks. It is very similar in appearance to the slightly larger Fea's petrel, and separating these two Macaronesian species at sea is very challenging. Zino's was formerly {{considered to be a}} subspecies of the soft-plumaged petrel, P. <b>mollis,</b> but they are not closely related, and Zino's was raised to species status because of differences in morphology, calls, breeding behaviour and mitochondrial DNA. It is Europe's most endangered seabird, with breeding areas restricted to a few ledges high in the central mountains of Madeira.|$|E
