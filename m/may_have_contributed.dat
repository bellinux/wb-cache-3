5|$|An {{association}} between viruses and obesity {{has been found}} in humans and several different animal species. The amount that these associations <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>contributed</b> to the rising rate of obesity is yet to be determined.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} of the bombing, Nellie Kehoe had become chronically ill with what resembled tuberculosis, for which there was no {{effective}} treatment or cure. Her frequent hospital stays <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>contributed</b> to the family's debt. Kehoe had ceased making mortgage and homeowner's insurance payments months earlier.|$|E

25|$|She {{began to}} take opiates for the pain, {{laudanum}} (an opium concoction) followed by morphine, then commonly prescribed. She would become dependent on them for much of her adulthood; the use {{from an early age}} <b>may</b> well <b>have</b> <b>contributed</b> to her frail health. Biographers such as Alethea Hayter <b>have</b> suggested this <b>may</b> also <b>have</b> <b>contributed</b> to the wild vividness of her imagination and the poetry that it produced.|$|R

5|$|When Poland {{entered the}} Western camp in April 1939, General Gamelin {{reminded}} General Kasprzycki of the Polish {{role in the}} dismemberment of Czechoslovakia. According to historian Paul N. Hehn, Poland’s annexation of Teschen <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>contributed</b> to the British and French reluctance to attack the Germans with greater forces in September 1939.|$|E
5|$|After its {{discovery}} in 1897, {{it has never}} been recorded again and it is now considered extinct; the presence of introduced black rats on María Madre <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>contributed</b> to its extinction. Oryzomys nelsoni was a large species, distinguished in particular by its long tail, robust skull, and large incisors. It was reddish to yellowish above and mostly white below. Its diet may have included plant material and small animals.|$|E
5|$|Altgens {{appeared}} {{briefly as}} a film actor and model during his 40-year career with the AP, which ended in 1979. He spent his later years working in display advertising, and answering letters and other requests made by assassination researchers. Altgens and his wife Clara died in 1995 {{at about the same}} time in their Dallas home. Both had suffered from long illnesses, and police said poisoning by a malfunctioning furnace also <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>contributed</b> to their deaths.|$|E
50|$|According to San Jose State University, Linda's {{remnants}} <b>may</b> <b>have</b> also <b>contributed</b> to {{the severity}} of the Valley Fire.|$|R

5|$|He held six consulships during Vespasian's reign {{but only}} one of these, in 73, was an {{ordinary}} consulship. The other five were less prestigious suffect consulships, which he held in 71, 75, 76, 77 and 79 respectively, usually replacing his father or brother in mid-January. While ceremonial, these offices no doubt gained Domitian valuable experience in the Roman Senate, and <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>contributed</b> to his later reservations about its relevance.|$|E
5|$|Nunn {{obtained}} {{the first eight}} years of his education in a one-room, one-teacher schoolhouse in Park. During his teenage years, he gave himself a hernia while lifting a heavy piece of farm equipment. This, combined with his father's health history, <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>contributed</b> to back pain issues that plagued him {{for most of his}} life. In 1938, he matriculated to Hiseville High School. He earned a Bachelor of Arts degree at Bowling Green Business University, now Western Kentucky University.|$|E
5|$|Scientists {{say that}} asexual {{reproduction}} {{in the wild}} is rare, and probably a last-ditch effort to reproduce when a mate is not present. Asexual reproduction diminishes genetic diversity, which helps build defenses against threats to the species. Species that rely solely on it risk extinction. Asexual reproduction <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>contributed</b> to the blue shark's decline off the Irish coast.|$|E

25|$|The {{cause of}} the {{accident}} was that the pilot flew too low whilst trying to descend out of icing conditions. A navigational error <b>may</b> also <b>have</b> <b>contributed</b> to the accident.|$|R
25|$|The Chairman of the Interstate Aviation Committee Sergei Yakimenko also {{commented on}} the incident, citing that human, equipment, and {{environmental}} factors <b>may</b> <b>have</b> all <b>contributed</b> to the crash.|$|R
5|$|The rapid {{disappearance}} of the Rodrigues rail may {{have been caused by}} introduced cats, but {{it is also possible that}} deforestation by tortoise hunters <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>contributed</b> significantly; from 1735, these hunters burned off forests so they could collect giant Cylindraspis tortoises for their meat and oil. The French astronomer Alexandre Guy Pingré, who visited Rodrigues to observe the 1761 transit of Venus, wrote in 1763 that the bird was extinct by the time of his visit.|$|E
5|$|These factors <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>contributed</b> to the {{gap between}} All Black tours of the British Islesthey next toured in 1924. The NZRFU was denied {{representation}} on the International Rugby Football Board (IRFB)composed exclusively of English, Irish, Scottish and Welsh membersuntil 1948. After complaining about the wing-forward for years, the Home Nations-administered IRFB {{made a series of}} law changes that effectively outlawed the position in 1931.|$|E
5|$|Though the extinctions {{occurred}} {{at the same time}} as the Chicxulub asteroid impact strongly supports the impact hypothesis of extinction, some scientists continue to dispute the role of the Chicxulub impact in driving the extinction, and suggest that other events <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>contributed</b> to the end-Cretaceous mass extinction. In particular, volcanic eruptions, climate change, sea level change, and other impact events have been suggested to play a role in driving the K–Pg extinction.|$|E
50|$|Mulock {{retired from}} {{politics}} in 1905 due to rheumatism and neuritis exacerbated by overwork, but {{the movement of}} his political views to the left <b>may</b> also <b>have</b> <b>contributed</b> to his decision.|$|R
50|$|The {{inability}} to prove paternity {{of a child}} biologically <b>may</b> also <b>have</b> <b>contributed</b> to the absence or ambiguity in the Constitution regarding a child's rights to having his/her needs met by his/her father.|$|R
50|$|Completion {{of the car}} {{was very}} far behind. The car was {{ultimately}} able to pass all parts of tech inspection in time {{to be the very}} last car to run endurance. The chain fell off in the next to last lap of the event (second driver) due to the retaining clip on the master link falling off. This car had a chain which rubbed a friction surface on an interfering chassis tube, which <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>contributing</b> to knocking the clip off.|$|R
5|$|Total drew {{attention}} to the unexplained absence from his post of the Gulf employee whose duty it was to supervise the unloading from the on-shore control room. The individual concerned had left the control room some time before the trouble started (see below) and his absence <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>contributed</b> to a lack of urgency in responding to events. Exactly what happened that night has never been established beyond doubt.|$|E
5|$|Wiggins and {{his mother}} were very close, and her 1983 Alzheimer's disease {{diagnosis}} <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>contributed</b> to his drug problems. He was devastated {{that she would not}} be able to enjoy his success in the major leagues. In the last few years of Wiggins' life, he enjoyed a closer relationship with his father, Albert, and he often took his children on visits to see their grandfather. Wiggins had a very difficult time with his father's death in May 1990.|$|E
5|$|William's eldest sibling, Elizabeth Ann, {{died at the}} age {{of seven}} during an epileptic fit on 7 September 1859, which <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>contributed</b> to Mary Jane's depression. The other two children, Joseph Henry and Mary Jane, both died before 1889. William was raised {{initially}} in Dudley by his maternal uncle, Edward Henley, and by 1871 he was enrolled at the Blue Coat charity school in Stourbridge.|$|E
30|$|Admittedly, {{as there}} are bounds {{to the number of}} days worked, ranging from half a day to 7 days, this <b>may</b> <b>have</b> partly <b>contributed</b> to the lower {{inequality}} of days worked.|$|R
50|$|Anchorage, Alaska, {{reporter}} Craig Medred {{pointed out}} in a January 2015 article in the Alaska Dispatch News that mushrooms which McCandless collected, photographed, and consumed <b>may</b> <b>have</b> also <b>contributed</b> to his death.|$|R
50|$|Piernas {{married a}} French woman named Portneuf, which <b>may</b> <b>have</b> also <b>contributed</b> to his {{popularity}} with the French {{residents of the}} colony. Their house {{was one of the}} first built in St. Louis.|$|R
5|$|Young Gaudí {{suffered}} from poor health, including rheumatism, which <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>contributed</b> to his reticent and reserved character. These health concerns and the hygienist theories of Dr. Kneipp contributed to Gaudí's decision to adopt vegetarianism {{early in his}} life. His religious faith and strict vegetarianism led him to undertake several lengthy and severe fasts. These fasts were often unhealthy and occasionally, as in 1894, led to life-threatening illness.|$|E
5|$|A {{pattern of}} lake cycles {{becoming}} {{longer than the}} preceding one has been noted. Water from the lake <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>contributed</b> to increased oxygen-18 at Sajama around 14,300 years ago, possibly triggered by evaporation. As the lake level dropped, Lake Poopó would have been disconnected first; the sill separating it {{from the rest of}} Lake Tauca is relatively shallow. Coipasa and Uyuni would have remained connected until later. Water levels in Lake Titicaca's Lake Huinaimarca were low by 14,200 BP.|$|E
5|$|Both the {{scarcity}} of published archaeological material and the misdating of some sites <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>contributed</b> to the low number of archaeological sites that {{can be attributed to}} the Hungarians in the steppes, according to archaeologist László Kovács. Kovács also says that the Hungarians' migration from the steppes and their settlement in the Carpathian Basin may have caused the development of a new material culture, rendering the identification of pre-conquest Hungarians difficult. Archaeological research has demonstrated that the material culture of the Avars and other steppe peoples who settled in the Carpathian Basin before the Hungarians experienced a similarly significant change after they left the steppes and settled in their new homeland.|$|E
5000|$|Those three streams all flow {{together}} {{at what was}} to be Collingwood's site, and such glowing reports about the quick success of this [...] "far-out district" [...] <b>may</b> well <b>have</b> <b>contributed</b> to the decision to found the town.|$|R
25|$|Given {{that the}} bards {{depended}} on aristocratic support to survive, {{and that this}} power and patronage was shifting towards the new English rulers, this thorough condemnation of their moral values <b>may</b> well <b>have</b> <b>contributed</b> to their demise as a caste.|$|R
50|$|After {{several days}} of rain, the river was swollen and fast flowing. Snow melt <b>may</b> also <b>have</b> <b>contributed.</b> The {{previous}} day the wire-boat was not run for a time due to the fast current, and journeys were made by row boats instead.|$|R
