25|$|I {{have written}} this letter {{to you on}} a happy day to me, {{which is also the}} last day of my life. For I have been {{attacked}} by a painful inability to urinate, and also dysentery, so violent that nothing can be added to the violence of my sufferings. But the cheerfulness of my mind, which comes from the recollection of all my philosophical contemplation, counterbalances all these afflictions. And I beg you {{to take care of the}} children of Metrodorus, in a manner worthy of the devotion shown by the young man to <b>me,</b> <b>and</b> <b>to</b> philosophy.|$|E
500|$|LeGrow {{called it}} [...] "worded {{in a way}} that I felt was {{offensive}} to <b>me</b> <b>and</b> <b>to</b> cosplayers" [...] and noted that [...] "none of it reflects my opinions." [...] Fan reaction to learning that the statement was inaccurate was generally relief since [...] "they felt it didn't mesh with [...] personality." [...] She stated: ...|$|E
500|$|On the {{potential}} for [...] "superhero fatigue", Feige stated, [...] "This year , we've got Civil War and we've got Doctor Strange in November, two completely different movies. To <b>me,</b> <b>and</b> <b>to</b> all of Marvel Studios, that's what keeps it going. As long as we're surprising people, as long as we're not falling into things becoming too similar ... next year, , , [...] Those are three totally different movies ... {{as long as the}} only shared thing is they come from the same source material and they've got our Marvel logo in front of the movies. Other than that they can be very distinct. What other studios do, what other properties, {{nothing we can do about}} it." ...|$|E

"I {{am going}} to live," [...] said she, [...] "at a great expense, with a lady there, who has the power--or says she has--of taking <b>me</b> about, <b>and</b> {{introducing}} <b>me,</b> <b>and</b> showing people <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> showing <b>me</b> <b>to</b> people." ...|$|R
500|$|Herodotus recounts that Megabates made {{inspections}} {{of the ships}} (probably whilst beached for the night), and came across one ship from Myndus which had not posted any sentries. Megabates ordered his guard to find {{the captain of the}} ship, Scylax, and then had the captain thrust into one of the ship's oar holes with his head outside and his body inside the ship. News reached Aristagoras of the treatment of his friend and he went to Megabates and asked him to reconsider his decision. When Megabates refused to grant Aristagoras's wishes, Aristagoras simply cut the captain loose himself. Predictably, Megabates was furious with Aristagoras, who in turn retorted [...] "But you, what have you to do with these matters? Did not Artaphrenes send you to obey <b>me</b> <b>and</b> <b>to</b> sail wherever I bid you? Why are you so meddlesome?". According to Herodotus, Megabates was so enraged by this that he sent messengers to the Naxians to warn them of the approach of the Persian force.|$|E
500|$|Osgood's husband, Samuel Stillman Osgood, {{threatened}} to sue Ellet unless she formally apologized. She retracted her statements {{in a letter to}} Osgood saying, [...] "The letter shown me by Mrs Poe must have been a forgery created by Poe himself". She put all the blame on Poe, suggesting the incident was because Poe was [...] "intemperate and subject to acts of lunacy." [...] The rumor that Poe was insane was spread by Ellet and by other enemies of Poe and eventually reported in newspapers. After Osgood reunited with her husband, the scandal died down. Poe's sick wife Virginia, however, was deeply affected by the scandal. As early as July 1845 she had been receiving anonymous letters, possibly from Ellet, which reported her husband's alleged indiscretions. On her deathbed, Virginia claimed [...] "Mrs. E. had been her murderer." [...] As Poe described years later, [...] "I scorned Mrs. E simply because she revolted <b>me,</b> <b>and</b> <b>to</b> this day she has never ceased her anonymous persecutions." [...] It is believed that Poe wrote the short story [...] "Hop-Frog" [...] as a literary revenge on Ellet and others.|$|E
500|$|Results {{continued}} {{to go against}} the Vale though, as on 19 March they lost 3–0 at Accrington Stanley, {{and as a result}} dropped out of the play-off zone {{for the first time in}} the season. Ugly post-match scenes at the Crown Ground saw Geohaghon confront fans who singled him out for abuse, whilst Gannon was ushered quietly out of the back door. Roberts told the media [...] "I don't think the manager likes <b>me</b> <b>and,</b> <b>to</b> be honest, I don't like him". Rumours circulated that Gannon would soon be on his way out. These rumours were proved accurate two days later, as Gannon's departure was confirmed by the club. Hugely unpopular with Vale supporters, his sacking was [...] "quick and with little emotion", whilst his poor man-management skills helped to earn him the dubious honour of having the shortest reign in the club's history. Despite this he did receive credit for spotting the potential talent in a teenage Sam Morsy, and for bringing Tom Pope to the club. Gannon himself made a statement on his website declaring his disappointment in the club's decision to terminate his contract after such a short period of time, and also bemoaned that he [...] "wasn't able to add many new players [...] ". The [...] "Valiants" [...] {{continued to}} struggle under caretaker manager Mark Grew, winning just two of their remaining ten games, and finishing 2010–11 in eleventh place.|$|E

2500|$|On June 26, 2006, Hamilton stated on his website: [...] "I {{was very}} upset to read the accusations against <b>me</b> <b>and</b> <b>to</b> see my name {{associated}} with the Operación Puerto investigation in Spain. I have not been treated by Dr. Fuentes. I have not done what the article alleges. In addition, I have never been contacted by authorities in Spain regarding these allegations. Therefore, {{it is impossible to}} comment on a situation I have no knowledge of." ...|$|E

2500|$|... when I {{was living}} in England, I was putting the young women in a frenzy with my songs. I was often forced {{to stay at the}} house on Sunday {{afternoon}} because there were so many of them coming after me. And I was serving them all on the same plate. When I would be writing a song to one, she would be reading it to her comrades and they would be all striving to get acquaintance with <b>me,</b> <b>and</b> <b>to</b> get me to do a song for themselves until they were bothering my head." ...|$|E

A letter was circulated {{in an attempt to}} discredit <b>me</b> <b>and</b> <b>to</b> distort the events surrounding my departure."

2500|$|Simmons and Stanley did not renew Criss' {{contract}} when it {{expired in}} March 2004. Criss, on his website, stated that [...] "No one, again, {{no one has}} called me, or my attorney about an extension for future touring. As a founding member I find this to be disrespectful to <b>me,</b> <b>and</b> <b>to</b> the fans that have made us {{one of the biggest}} bands in the world." [...] Criss stated in a radio interview in 2004 with Eddie Trunk that Simmons and Stanley were going to start a new Kiss, and felt that he was getting too old to play the drums for two hours (Criss was almost 59 at this time).|$|E
2500|$|... "On both a {{personal}} and a professional level, I am still dealing {{with the consequences of}} this episode. Some people felt that I had committed an irrevocable betrayal of trust, and have discounted me and my teaching ever since. Others were more forgiving, but their trust in me and my integrity was permanently shaken. Even newer students, who come to Zen Center and find out about these incidents, are sometimes confused and question whether I can be their teacher. These events are a helpful reminder—both to <b>me</b> <b>and</b> <b>to</b> others—of my vulnerability to arrogance and inflation. I see how my empowerment to protect and care for the Triple Treasure inflated my sense of personal authority, and thus detracted from and disparaged the Triple Treasure. This ancient twisted karma I now fully avow." ...|$|E

[...] In November 2007, he accused the Anglican and Catholic archbishops of Sydney, Peter Jensen and George Pell respectively, of hindering the acceptance of gay people in Australian society, stating that homophobia was [...] "reinforced even to this day by religious instruction, {{and it has to be}} said, religious instruction from the two archbishops of Sydney". Kirby also expressed disappointment in his [...] "minority of one" [...] status among his High Court of Australia colleagues, and conceded that [...] "some of the justices perhaps have less liberal views than I have".|$|E
2500|$|The Book of Mormon makes {{reference}} to groups from [...] "other countries" [...] {{that could be}} brought to the New World.

[...] Mormons have taught since the time of Joseph Smith that this is a {{reference to}} the European colonizers of the Americas.

2500|$|Some initial {{military}} reactions {{seemed to}} dismiss the news {{as if it were}} of little importance, with one spokesperson comparing the verses to the presence of the phrase [...] "In God we Trust" [...] on United States currency. However General David Petraeus left no doubt that senior commanders, once apprised of the situation, considered the situation to be extremely serious. Delivering what news reports called a [...] "stinging criticism of the contractor," [...] Petraeus said that [...] "It is disturbing. This is a serious concern to <b>me</b> <b>and</b> <b>to</b> the other commanders in Iraq and Afghanistan because it indeed conveys a perception that is absolutely contrary to what we have sought to do." [...] Petraeus added that [...] "There’s a reason that we put people through cultural awareness training....I can assure you that there is much greater sensitivity among our troops about this sort of thing than apparently there is from the contractor." ...|$|E
