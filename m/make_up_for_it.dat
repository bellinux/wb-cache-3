5|$|In {{the late}} 18th century and early 19th century Warsaw grew quickly. As Poland {{was going through}} a period of turmoil and {{constant}} devastating wars, it lacked modern permanent fortifications. To <b>make</b> <b>up</b> <b>for</b> <b>it,</b> three lines of earthworks, ramparts and palisades were constructed {{on both sides of the}} Vistula. The earthworks, usually several metres high and constructed mostly of sand and clay, were reinforced with gabions and surrounded by a dry moat, a stockade and a line of trous de loup.|$|E
5|$|Eugenio Espejo was an autodidact, and {{he claimed}} with pride {{that he never}} left any book in his hands unread, and if he did, he would <b>make</b> <b>up</b> <b>for</b> <b>it</b> by observing nature. However, his desire to read {{everything}} indiscriminately sometimes led him to hasty judgments, which appear in his manuscripts. Through his own written work, it can be inferred that Espejo considered education as the main means for popular development. He understood that reading was basic {{in the formation of}} the self, and his conscience drove him to critiques of the establishment, based on observation and in the application of the law of his time.|$|E
5|$|Whitney {{takes an}} {{interest}} in Tyler Moon (Tony Discipline) but refuses to date him. Whitney applies for a new work experience at the local nursery which she later gets. When Michael Moon (Steve John Shepherd) tells his brother Tyler about Whitney's recent ordeal, he rejects her but later gives her his special Moon pendant to <b>make</b> <b>up</b> <b>for</b> <b>it.</b> Whitney agrees {{to go on a}} date with Tyler and they agree to have sex but Whitney is unsure as she remembers her past and runs out, telling Tyler she never wants to see him again. Tyler is hurt. He later tells Fatboy she needs a shrink which Whitney overhears. She runs out and kisses Fatboy and starts a relationship with him. Fatboy publicly declares his love for Whitney, but when he is unable to give her a driving lesson, Lucy (now Hetti Bywater) suggests that Tyler do it, because she knows that Tyler likes Whitney. Whitney starts to feel smothered by Fatboy's affections. Lucy teases Tyler by telling him that Fatboy plans to publicly propose to Whitney, so Tyler tells Whitney he likes her but Whitney says it is too late. Tyler then surprises Whitney by kissing her. Whitney, feeling guilty, refuses to go on holiday with Fatboy, and tells him to kiss her. He does, but she says it is like kissing her best friend. She then admits she wants Tyler, and Fatboy is heartbroken. Whitney then goes to see Tyler but finds him with Lucy, kissing. She then tells Tyler to leave her alone. However, Tyler later tells Whitney that he cannot, as he loves her. Whitney admits to feeling the same way, and they begin a relationship.|$|E

It has however been demonstrated that pigeons do not complete occluded shapes. A study based on altering the grey {{level of a}} perch that was coloured differently from the background showed that budgerigars do not detect edges based on colours.|$|E
25|$|Forces {{under the}} command of the Mongol Empire were trained, organized, and {{equipped}} for mobility and speed. Mongol soldiers were more lightly armored than many of the armies they faced but were able to <b>make</b> <b>up</b> <b>for</b> <b>it</b> with maneuverability. Each Mongol warrior would usually travel with multiple horses, allowing him to quickly switch to a fresh mount as needed. In addition, soldiers of the Mongol army functioned independently of supply lines, considerably speeding up army movement.|$|E
25|$|Crosby was a keen {{fisherman}} {{especially in}} his younger days {{but it was}} a pastime that he enjoyed throughout his life. In the summer of 1966 he spent a week as the guest of Lord Egremont, staying in Cockermouth and fishing on the River Derwent. His trip was filmed for The American Sportsman on ABC, although all did not go well at first as the salmon were not running. He did <b>make</b> <b>up</b> <b>for</b> <b>it</b> {{at the end of the}} week by catching a number of sea trout.|$|E

25|$|Most {{players have}} career batting averages {{in the range}} of 20 to 40. This is also the {{desirable}} range for wicket-keepers, though some fall short and <b>make</b> <b>up</b> <b>for</b> <b>it</b> with keeping skill. Until a substantial increase in scores in the 21st century due to improved bats and smaller grounds among other factors, players who sustained an average above 50 through a career were considered exceptional, and before the development of the heavy roller in the 1870s (which allowed for a flatter, safer cricket pitch) an average of 25 was considered very good.|$|E
25|$|A typical episode {{generally}} {{follows a}} simple formula: Beaver or Wally (or both) {{get into a}} scrape and then face their parents for a lecture regarding the event. Lectures sometimes {{take the form of}} fables, with Ward allowing the boys to discover their moral meanings and applying those meanings to their lives. Occasionally, when offenses are serious, punishments such as being grounded are dealt the miscreants. The parents are sometimes shown debating the best approach to the situation. Other episodes (especially in earlier seasons) even reverse the formula, with Ward making a parenting mistake and having {{to figure out how to}} <b>make</b> <b>up</b> <b>for</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E
25|$|Roche {{was only}} 39 seconds behind Delgado {{in the general}} classification. Roche could still win the Tour, but it {{depended}} on if he could recover {{in time for the}} 22nd stage. That stage included the last serious climb of the Tour, so Delgado had his final opportunity to gain time on Roche, and he attacked. However, Roche was able to come back to Delgado twice. Then, Roche attacked, and Delgado could not keep up. Roche won back 18 seconds on Delgado, so he had reduced his margin to 21 seconds. Being a talented time-trialist, he knew that he could easily <b>make</b> <b>up</b> <b>for</b> <b>it</b> on the penultimate stage (an individual time trial at Dijon). Indeed, Roche won almost a minute on Delgado, and this was enough to secure the overall win. This time trial was won by Jean-Fran√ßois Bernard, who finished the Tour in third place; if Bernard had not lost four minutes after the flat tire in the nineteenth stage, he would have won the Tour.|$|E

25|$|Abrash {{committed}} his division's 78th Armored Brigade in {{the northern}} sector at 22:00. He was behind schedule, but expected to <b>make</b> <b>up</b> <b>for</b> <b>it</b> if the 78th Brigade could reach and secure the Kuneitra-Mas'ade Road, {{four and a half}} kilometres west of its starting line. It was believed that achieving this mission would cause the Israeli defenses to collapse. Each of the 82nd Brigade's ninety-five T-55's tanks was equipped with a specially designed infrared nightscope. The night was brightly moonlit. The 82nd Brigade moved up the valley just two and a half kilometres from the Kuneitra-Masada Road. Ben Gal used his artillery for illumination, and ordered his men to remain silent until the Syrians were well within range. By 22:00, the Syrian tanks were within 800 meters of the Israeli positions. Both sides lost tanks to the terrain. Captain Yair Swet, a 77th Battalion company commander, was ordered to move to Booster and lost two tanks as a result. One crew managed to extricate its tank and use it to pull the other, but the delay distracted the battalion.|$|E
500|$|Although the {{military}} had officially barred or restricted the recruitment of Aborigines in earlier periods, these impediments were significantly relaxed after Japan entered World WarII, and Australia came under direct attack for the first time. Waters volunteered for service in the RAAF on 24August 1942, at Brisbane, and was accepted. He began training as an aircraft mechanic, but later volunteered for flying service, and commenced initial training at Somers, Victoria, in December 1943. The aircrew interviewer thought he looked [...] "a bit rough" [...] but [...] "should make a fighter". Waters believed his lack of education would be a disadvantage, and studied nights to <b>make</b> <b>up</b> <b>for</b> <b>it.</b> Keen to be a pilot, he was concerned {{that he would be}} allocated to duty as a wireless operator because he showed an aptitude for Morse transmission early on. He was also asked to imagine himself as the tail gunner in a Lancaster or Halifax heavy bomber, to which he replied, [...] "I had a very disappointed look on my face, sir!" [...] So convinced was he that he would not achieve his dream of becoming an aviator, Waters made three separate bets against himself being selected, and had to pay out ¬£15 when he was nevertheless chosen.|$|E
500|$|The character's {{role in the}} anime {{adaptation}} of Persona 4 earned similar response. A reviewer from T.H.E.M. Anime Reviews commented that Yu [...] "seems to be the aggregate of all the quirkiest possible choices you could make in the game," [...] making him likable character for his diverse scenes. When first watching the Persona 4 anime, Elliot Page from UK Anime Network noted that although Yu was not a silent character as in the video game, he had little dialogue and the pacing managed to <b>make</b> <b>up</b> <b>for</b> <b>it.</b> In a later review, Andy Hanley from the same site said he liked how the protagonist was handled, as the staff used his [...] "blank state" [...] to create comedic interactions. Briana Lawrence from the Fandom Post shared similar feelings, stating that the staff [...] "somehow managed to give a silent protagonist a personality that's not only believable, but likable." [...] Lawrence appreciated how the character was developed across the series thanks to all the bonds he forms into a [...] "snarky, lovable main character who can keep a straight face while being kicked off a cliff." [...] While also commenting how Yu manages to reinforce both the comical and [...] "spooky" [...] elements of the plot, Blu-ray's Jeffrey Kauffman noted he [...] "remains something of a cipher throughout the series" [...] {{with the possibility of}} having the viewer relate with him.|$|E
5000|$|Deborah Evans Price, of Billboard {{magazine}} {{reviewed the}} song favorably, calling it [...] "perky and playful."

500|$|The [...] "clever, ground-breaking", [...] "fitting" [...] and [...] "hugely satisfying" [...] episode {{reminded}} hdtvuk.tv's Ian Calcutt of s finale [...] "", while TV Squad's Richard Keller noted strong {{similarities to}} a two-part episode of [...] named [...] "Year of Hell". He was [...] "extremely {{sad to see}} [...] go", but could not overlook the mediocrity, predictability and lack of originality of the series finale. TV Zones Anthony Brown, who considered the episode [...] "curious low-key", regretted the planned direct-to-DVD films, as [...] "the whole thing inevitably loses its punch as the reset button's pressed , rather than providing the genuine emotion of an actual ending". Maureen Ryan of The Chicago Tribune thought that the episode went out on [...] "a strange note" [...] with a disappointing last [...] "string of banal clich√©s" [...] dialogue exchange, although the cast and the established goodwill of their characters could partly <b>make</b> <b>up</b> <b>for</b> <b>it.</b> Mary McNamara of Multichannel News lauded Cooper's direction, lighting, costuming, the [...] "haunting" [...] music and sound, the production values and special effects. She acknowledged the SG-1 finale as a [...] "true ensemble/team piece" [...] with [...] "a poignant and satisfying conclusion", and despite not making it into the top ten of series finales, the episode was [...] "very good" [...] and [...] "respects and rewards the ten year commitment viewers have made to the series".

500|$|Reviewing [...] "The Long Game" [...] for The A.V. Club in 2013, Alasdair Wilkins {{gave it a}} {{grade of}} [...] "B-". He found it [...] "inessential" [...] and commented {{that it was not}} very clear on the motives of the Editor and Jagrafess, but Pegg's {{performance}} was almost enough to <b>make</b> <b>up</b> <b>for</b> <b>it.</b> Overall he felt that the story [...] "presents a few too many simple ideas, with the cumulative effect that this is a story that feels slight at best, underdeveloped at worst. The episode is hardly a failure, {{but it could have been}} so much more." [...] In Who Is the Doctor, a guide to the revived series, Graeme Burk described the episode as [...] "entertaining, if unspectacular." [...] He called Pegg the best guest star so far, and stated that Langley did a [...] "superb job" [...] at conveying Adam, but he felt that the episode did not have much else beside the failed companion storyline. Burk criticised the satire for not being subtle enough and borrowing from other stories such as Nineteen Eighty-Four. He also remarked that it was a shame Adam's motives were cut, as well as development between Rose and Adam. Burk's coauthor Robert [...] was more positive, opining that a satire did not have to be subtle to be effective, and that viewers could still relate it to the news media today. He also praised the way [...] "The Long Game" [...] showed the Ninth Doctor as an [...] "inspirational figure." [...] The two also questioned the decision to leave Adam in the 21st century with future technology.|$|E

[...] PPcorn.com went out to describe the song as [...] "an excellent addition to her list of hit songs", declaring: [...] "after the lyrical ambivalence of 'Love Me Harder', here comes a song that actually means something.

One's state of mind while performing good actions is seen as {{more important than the}} action itself. The Buddhist Sangha is seen as the most meritorious [...] "field of merit".
