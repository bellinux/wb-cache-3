5|$|I {{read this}} book, and I was totally stunned. At {{the same time}} I was pretty upset with myself that I didn't know this book. I live in Amsterdam where Anne Frank is a {{national}} hero, and for <b>me</b> <b>this</b> book read like Anne Frank's diary but written 97 years before– a firsthand account of slavery. I basically made it my passion to make this book into a film.|$|E
5|$|With this tour, I'm {{going to}} be working on some {{different}} arrangements for some of the older songs, to... give it a little more life to them. That's not to say they're going to sound totally different and to freak anybody out... I love re-singing songs to different music. I genuinely want to tour with these new songs, as well as older hits. These new songs mean so much to <b>me,</b> <b>this</b> time of my life has been so wonderful for me, and I want to experience that with my fans.|$|E

25|$|In 1973, Glitter {{appeared}} at the London Palladium. It was a sell-out concert. In the same year his performance at the Rainbow Theatre was recorded and released as a live album, Remember <b>Me</b> <b>This</b> Way. Glitter undertook a world tour, performing in Europe, Scandinavia, Australia, and New Zealand. He continued to tour until 1976, and his temporary retirement from music.|$|E
25|$|At {{this moment}} I {{have to tell}} Germany, I have {{to report to the}} Fuehrer in particular, that the {{thoughts}} of all my countrymen were with me in this fight; that the Fuehrer and his faithful people were thinking of <b>me.</b> <b>This</b> thought gave me the strength to succeed in this fight. It gave me the courage and the endurance to win this victory for Germany's colors.|$|E
25|$|This {{is how it}} was for <b>me.</b> <b>This</b> is how I played it. It's just a pippy-poo {{little book}} and people come back with this {{diatribe}} about its great social significance. Well it's just because nobody ever got off his high horse long enough to write to single women in any form they could associate with. If they had, somebody else would be the arbiter for single women at this point instead of me.|$|E

25|$|Pennsylvania {{has passed}} a law which compels an Orthodox Jew to choose between his {{religious}} faith and his economic survival. That is a cruel choice. It is a choice which I think no State can constitutionally demand. For <b>me</b> <b>this</b> {{is not something that}} can be swept under the rug and forgotten in the interest of enforced Sunday togetherness. I think the impact of this law upon these appellants grossly violates their constitutional right to the free exercise of their religion.|$|E
25|$|In 2005 Remember <b>Me</b> <b>This</b> Way, the {{documentary}} filmed at Glitter's career peak in 1973 (and originally released in 1974), was issued {{for the first}} time on DVD. Glitter's music itself still had an audience, further demonstrated by three new album releases, although all of them contained past recordings from the vaults, rather than new product. The first two new albums were issued at the same time, The Remixes and Live in Concert (the latter of which was a 1981 recording). These were only for sale on the Internet. A new collection of Glitter's chart hit singles followed, The Best of Gary Glitter. In 2006 his back catalogue was made available via the Internet from sites such as iTunes and eMusic.|$|E
25|$|On February 13, 1996, Shakur {{released}} his fourth solo album, All Eyez on <b>Me.</b> <b>This</b> double album {{was the first}} and second of his three-album commitment to Death Row Records. It sold more than nine million copies. The record was a general departure from the introspective subject matter of Me Against the World, being more oriented toward a thug and gangsta mentality. Shakur continued his recordings despite increasing problems at the Death Row label. Dr. Dre left his post as in-house producer to form his own label, Aftermath. Shakur continued to produce hundreds of tracks during his time at Death Row, most of which would be released on his posthumous albums Still I Rise, Until the End of Time, Better Dayz, Loyal to the Game and Pac's Life. He also began the process of recording an album, One Nation, with the New York-based Boot Camp Clik and their label Duck Down Records.|$|E

25|$|The {{good news}} is, I'm finally {{working on my}} debut retail album. It sounds amazing so far. Everyone is excited about it. The bad news is, no more free music. Odds are, ever. No loopholes. Which means, Vampire Sunlight {{might be the last}} free release, and The Evil Microchip will not drop. Not even on YouTube. Sorry, Markus. But a major thank you is in order for {{everyone}} who's helped <b>me</b> <b>this</b> far. Everyone from Boe and Dre to Jimmy Iovine. All the graphic designers who have made covers, all the fans who uploaded my music, everyone. Thank you. My digital revolution has taken the Galaxy by storm, and I'm proud of it. It's just time to take things to a higher level. Hopefully, yall will support me. I'm not gonna throw the fact you've heard all my secrets for free in your face. But honestly, I would personally appreciate it if you went out and supported whatever I put in stores. More news to come, but once again, no free music indefinitely. Hold your head, kids...|$|E

That's why I call the tour 'Who's That Girl?'; because I {{play a lot of}} characters, and every time I do a video or a song, people go, 'Oh, that's what she's like.' And I'm not like any of them. I'm all of them. I'm none of them. You know what I mean.?" ...|$|E
500|$|... "The {{song was}} so amazing I {{had to be}} sure, as an artist, that she really was trying {{to give it to}} me. I was like 'is she really trying to give <b>me</b> <b>this</b> song, because it's pretty amazing.' They were like 'yes, but she wants to stay on it with you.' And I was like, 'Wow! Beyoncé? Thanks!' And you know I love and respect her to death so I wouldn't pass that chance up." ...|$|E
500|$|Over ominous keys, a {{keyboard}} opening and a repeating drum loop {{in the first}} verse, Beyoncé sings about how her relationship turned sour and puts all her cards on the table, [...] "I told you how you hurt me, baby / But you don't care / Now I'm crying and deserted, baby / But you don't care / Ain't nobody tell <b>me</b> <b>this</b> is love / You're immune to all my pain / I need you to tell <b>me</b> <b>this</b> love / You don't care, well, that's OK". While singing {{the first and second}} verses, she pulls out the power in her lower register. Each time, her voice slowly builds until the commanding chorus is reached, where towards the end, she sings, [...] "la la la", in a muted saxophone line. Her voice expresses anger as she sings the chorus lines. In the second verse, Beyoncé continues the [...] "wild-eyed pleas", as stated by Guerra and sings the lines, [...] "Even since you knew your power / you made me cry / And now every time our love goes sour / you won't sympathize". Her raw vocals then punch through most powerfully at the second chorus leading up to the bridge. After the bridge, Beyoncé, this time, scats the chorus alongside a multi-octave guitar solo.|$|E
