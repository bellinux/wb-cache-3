5|$|Among evangelical Christians, {{the five}} <b>men</b> <b>are</b> {{commonly}} considered martyrs and missionary heroes. Books {{have been written}} about them by numerous biographers, most notably Elisabeth Elliot.

5000|$|Universal {{statements}} <b>are</b> contraries: 'every <b>man</b> <b>is</b> just' and 'no <b>man</b> <b>is</b> just' {{cannot be}} true together, although {{one may be}} true and the other false, and also both may be false (if at least one <b>man</b> <b>is</b> just, {{and at least one}} <b>man</b> <b>is</b> not just).|$|R

50|$|Another logical {{opposition}} {{implied by}} this, though not mentioned explicitly by Aristotle, is 'alternation' (alternatio), consisting of 'subalternation' and 'superalternation'. Alternation is a relation between a particular statement and a universal {{statement of the}} same quality such that the particular is implied by the other. The particular is the subaltern of the universal, which is the particular's superaltern. For example, if 'every <b>man</b> <b>is</b> white' is true, its contrary 'no <b>man</b> <b>is</b> white' is false. Therefore the contradictory 'some <b>man</b> <b>is</b> white' is true. Similarly the universal 'no <b>man</b> <b>is</b> white' implies the particular 'not every <b>man</b> <b>is</b> white'.|$|R

60|$|But, I say, what is {{the reason}} some so prize what others so despise, since they both stand in need of the same grace and mercy of God in Christ? Why, the one sees, and the other sees nothing, of this woeful miserable state. And thus have I showed you the {{necessity}} of a broken heart. 1. <b>Man</b> <b>is</b> dead, and must <b>be</b> quickened. 2. <b>Man</b> <b>is</b> a fool, and must be made wise. 3. <b>Man</b> <b>is</b> proud, and must <b>be</b> humbled. 4. <b>Man</b> <b>is</b> self-willed, and must <b>be</b> broken. 5. <b>Man</b> <b>is</b> fearless, and must be made to consider. 6. <b>Man</b> <b>is</b> a false believer, and must <b>be</b> rectified. 7. <b>Man</b> <b>is</b> a lover of sin, and must be weaned from it. 8. <b>Man</b> <b>is</b> wild, and must <b>be</b> tamed. 9. <b>Man</b> disrelishes the things of God, and can take no savour in them, until his heart is broken.|$|R
