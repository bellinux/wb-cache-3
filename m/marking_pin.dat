40|$|Firing <b>pin</b> <b>marks</b> {{are most}} {{important}} forensic evidences in firearm identification, Howeveq there are no general guidelines available for optical imaging, processing, and analyzing the images of firing <b>pin</b> <b>marks</b> for firearm identification, In this respect, the further development for firearm identification is highly demanded from both theoretical and practical point of view. This paper aims {{to address the problem}} of firing <b>pin</b> <b>marks</b> identification. A novel approach is proposed for measuring the similarity of firing <b>pin</b> <b>marks</b> in terms of their co-occurrencefeature descriptors. In doing so, the markings on the surface of cartridge case are captured by a CCD camera. After extracting the firing pin imagesn we calculate the co-occurrence feature sets of the firing pin images. Then we can classify the firing pin images based on the relative distances between sample images. The experimental results indicate that the firing <b>pin</b> <b>marks</b> can be preciously classified in terms of their co-occurrence features...|$|R
40|$|The {{internal}} friction and elastic modulus of high purity magnesium were studied during irradiation at 2 K with 0. 4 - 0. 6 MeV electrons and subsequent anneal sequences. The sallent {{feature of the}} results is the evidence of a <b>marked</b> <b>pinning</b> stage in the temperature interval 9 to 13 K. This indicates that long-range diffusion of elementary interstitial defects occurs at these temperatures. Post-irradiation anneals enabled also the discovery of two relaxation peaks centered at 6 K and 15 K, respectively. These stem from {{the arrival of the}} diffusing self-interstitials at dislocations, and presumably from their interactions with geometrical kinks...|$|R

500|$|A parting line, sprue, gate <b>marks,</b> and ejector <b>pin</b> <b>marks</b> {{are usually}} {{present on the}} final part. [...] None of these {{features}} are typically desired, but are unavoidable {{due to the nature}} of the process. Gate marks occur at the gate which joins the melt-delivery channels (sprue and runner) to the part forming cavity. Parting line and ejector <b>pin</b> <b>marks</b> result from minute misalignments, wear, gaseous vents, clearances for adjacent parts in relative motion, and/or dimensional differences of the mating surfaces contacting the injected polymer. Dimensional differences can be attributed to non-uniform, pressure-induced deformation during injection, machining tolerances, and non-uniform thermal expansion and contraction of mould components, which experience rapid cycling during the injection, packing, cooling, and ejection phases of the process. Mould components are often designed with materials of various coefficients of thermal expansion. These factors cannot be simultaneously accounted for without astronomical increases in the cost of design, fabrication, processing, and quality monitoring. The skillful mould and part designer will position these aesthetic detriments in hidden areas if feasible.|$|R

40|$|The {{internal}} friction and elastic modulus of high purity, dehydrogenated Nb and Ta single crystals were analysed after in situ cold-work and/or electron irradiation at temperatures down to 4 K. In irradiated niobium, a <b>marked</b> dislocation <b>pinning</b> becomes evident at 6 K. Combined with previous resistivity data, {{this result is}} taken as evidence of long-range migration of self-interstitials. In tantalum cold-worked at 4. 2 K, a large pinning stage takes place during heating between 8 K and 13 K. It Is interpreted in terms of point defect diffusion to dislocatlons. Possibly, minute amounts of hydrogen are involved. Typical activation enthalpies for the migrating defects are between 0. 01 and 0. 02 eV. Low temperature irradiation in the as-deformed state reveals additional pinning beginning at 6 K, which implies mobile intrinsic interstitials...|$|R
