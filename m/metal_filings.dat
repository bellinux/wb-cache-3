2500|$|On 1 June 1894, at {{a meeting}} of the British Association for the Advancement of Science at Oxford University, Lodge gave a {{memorial}} lecture on the work of Hertz (recently deceased) and the German physicist's proof of the existence of electromagnetic waves 6 years earlier. Lodge set up a demonstration on the quasi optical nature of [...] "Hertzian waves" [...] (radio waves) and demonstrated their similarity to light and vision including reflection and transmission. Later in June and on 14 August 1894 he did similar experiments, increasing the distance of transmission up to 55 meters. Lodge used a detector called a coherer (invented by Edouard Branly), a glass tube containing <b>metal</b> <b>filings</b> between two electrodes. When the small electrical charge from waves from an antenna were applied to the electrodes, the metal particles would cling together or [...] "" [...] causing the device to become conductive allowing the current from a battery to pass through it. In Lodge's setup the slight impulses from the coherer were picked up by a mirror galvanometer which would deflect a beam of light being projected on it, giving a visual signal that the impulse was received. After receiving a signal the <b>metal</b> <b>filings</b> in the coherer were broken apart or [...] "decohered" [...] by a manually operated vibrator or by the vibrations of a bell placed on the table near by that rang every time a transmission was received. Since this was one year before Marconi's 1895 demonstration of a system for radio wireless telegraphy and contained many of the basic elements that would be used in Marconi's later wireless systems, Lodge's lecture became the focus of priority disputes with the Marconi Company a little over a decade later over invention of wireless telegraphy (radio). At the time of the dispute some, including the physicist John Ambrose Fleming, pointed out that Lodge's lecture was a physics experiment, not a demonstration of telegraphic signaling. Lodge would later work with Alexander Muirhead on the development of devices specifically for wireless telegraphy.|$|E

5000|$|The two crews awoke at 05:08 UTC, {{and began}} {{preparing}} for the second EVA. Parazynski and Tani began the spacewalk at 09:32 UTC, a half-hour ahead of the planned timeline. The pair started with the P6 truss, removing the attachments to the Z1 truss, which allowed Wilson and Wheelock to use the station's robotic arm to move the truss to a position where it was [...] "parked" [...] for the night. Joking to Wilson [...] "Don't drop it!", Parazynski then moved on and installed handrails onto Harmony, while Tani went to inspect some items requested by the managers, including handrails on a Crew and Equipment Translation Aid (CETA) cart, that was considered as a possible cause of Rick Mastracchio's glove tear on STS-118. Tani noted the handrail appeared to be intact, with no obvious sharp edges. Tani {{then moved on to}} the Solar Alpha Rotary Joint (SARJ) that has had an intermittent vibration for over a month. After removing the cover from the joint, Tani called down to the team to let them know he saw some metal shavings, and some wear patterns and discoloration on one of the rings inside the joint. [...] "It's like the result that you get with the <b>metal,</b> iron <b>filings</b> and you put a magnet under it and they stand straight up." [...] Tani collected some of the shavings onto some tape, which returned to Earth with the shuttle for further analysis. Managers decided to add a task to Tuesday's EVA, having Parazynski inspect the port (left side) SARJ, using photography and video to compare it to the starboard SARJ inspected by Tani.|$|R
30|$|According to the DOE, the WQI {{is defined}} by six parameters, namely the {{biochemical}} oxygen demand (BOD), chemical oxygen demand (COD), dissolved oxygen (DO), pH, total suspended solids (TSS), and ammoniacal nitrogen. BOD is {{the most commonly used}} parameter for determining the oxygen demand on the receiving water of a municipal or industrial discharge. High BOD is an indication of poor water quality, while COD is an indicator of organics in the water, usually used in conjunction with BOD. COD test is commonly used to measure the amount of organic and inorganic oxydizable compounds in the water [8]. Generally, the BOD/COD ratio should be equal to or less than 1.0 [9]. The BOD/COD ratios for industrial waste water can be lower than 0.5 [10]. Oxygen is essential for all plants and animals to survive, whether they live on land or in water. Aquatic organisms rely on oxygen that is dissolved in the water. A low DO (less than 2 mg/l) indicates poor water quality and, thus, is not conducive for sustaining many sensitive aquatic lives. DO also depends on physiochemical parameters such as temperature, salinity, and pH [11]. The ammonia molecule is a nutrient required for life, but excess ammonia accumulates in the organism and causes alteration of metabolism or increase in body pH. TSS refers to the particles in the water that are larger than 0.45 μm. TSS includes pollutants such as minute <b>metal</b> swarfs, <b>filings,</b> and powdered chips [12], high concentrations of which can damage the habitats of fish and other aquatic organisms [13]. The presence of synthetic organic chemicals like solvents, paints, and detergents can impart offensive tastes, odors, and colors to fish and aquatic plants even if present in low concentrations [14]. Oil in the water also affects the lives of the aquatic beings by inhibiting the atmospheric oxygen from dissolving in the water. Free oil found in the effluent waste rises {{to the surface of the}} water and prevents the sunlight from reaching the depths of the water. Oil and grease also become chemically emulsified, primarily through the use of detergents and other alkalis [15]. pH is an indicator of the existence of biological life as most of them thrive in a quite narrow and critical pH range. The discharge of industrial effluents and urban wastes into the river water causes an increase in BOD, COD, and TSS [14, 15].|$|R

5000|$|Jewelers and Watchmakers: Purpose built benches which {{generally}} have a [...] "bench pin" [...] - {{a small wooden}} work surface protruding out towards the worker, allowing for working on small parts. In addition there is usually a tray or leather apron underneath to catch precious <b>metal</b> <b>filings</b> or dropped items. They are designed {{so that when the}} worker is seated the work is at or near eye level.|$|E
5000|$|Temistocle Calzecchi-Onesti's {{experiments}} with tubes of <b>metal</b> <b>filings,</b> {{as reported in}} [...] "Il Nuovo Cimento" [...] in 1884, {{led to the development}} of the first radio wave detector, the coherer, by Branly some years later. It was the first widely used detector for radio communication. This consisted of iron filings contained in an insulating tube with two electrodes that will conduct an electric current under the action of an applied electrical signal. The operation of the coherer is based upon the large resistance offered to the passage of electric current by loose <b>metal</b> <b>filings,</b> which decreases when direct current or alternating current is applied between the terminals of the coherer at a predetermined voltage. The mechanism is based on the thin layers of oxide covering all the filings, which is highly resistive. The oxide layers are broken down when a voltage is applied of the right magnitude, causing the coherer to [...] "latch" [...] into its low-resistance state until the voltage is removed and the coherer is physically tapped.|$|E
50|$|The coherer used in {{practical}} receivers was a glass tube, sometimes evacuated, {{which was about}} half filled with sharply cut <b>metal</b> <b>filings,</b> often part silver and part nickel. Silver electrodes made contact with the metal particles on both ends. In some coherers the electrodes were slanted so {{the width of the}} gap occupied by the filings could be varied by rotating the tube about its long axis, thus adjusting its sensitivity to the prevailing conditions.|$|E
50|$|The {{material}} on the canvas and the color process play an essential role. The use of sand and <b>metal</b> <b>filings,</b> which gives his paintings their special texture, is in this respect illuminating. Representative is his dialectical approach towards “presence” and “absence”, which adds {{to the creation of}} tension that he wants to bring about visually and mentally. In his mind “non-painted” and “painted” matter are to be evaluated on an equal level.|$|E
50|$|The {{behavior}} of particles or <b>metal</b> <b>filings</b> {{in the presence}} of electricity or electric sparks was noticed in many experiments well before Edouard Branly's 1890 paper and even before there was proof of the theory of electromagnetism. In 1835 Swedish scientist Peter Samuel Munk noticed a change of resistance in a mixture of <b>metal</b> <b>filings</b> {{in the presence of}} spark discharge from a Leyden jar. In 1850 Pierre Guitard found that when dusty air was electrified, the particles would tend to collect in the form of strings. The idea that particles could react to electricity was used in English engineer Samuel Alfred Varley's 1866 lightning bridge, a lightning arrester attached to telegraph lines consisting of a piece of wood with two metal spikes extending into a chamber. The space was filled with powdered carbon that would not allow the low voltage telegraph signals to pass through but it would conduct and ground a high voltage lightning strike. In 1879 the Welsh scientist David Edward Hughes found that loose contacts between a carbon rod and two carbon blocks as well as the metallic granules in a microphone he was developing responded to sparks generated in a nearby apparatus. Temistocle Calzecchi-Onesti in Italy began studying the anomalous change in the resistance of thin metallic films and metal particles at Fermo/Monterubbiano. He found that copper filings between two brass plates would cling together, becoming conductive, when he applied a voltage to them. He also found that other types of <b>metal</b> <b>filings</b> would have the same reaction to electric sparks occurring at a distance, a phenomenon that he thought could be used for detecting lightning strikes. Calzecchi-Onesti's papers were published in il Nuovo Cimento in 1884, 1885 and 1886.|$|E
50|$|Popov {{also read}} a 1894 article about British {{physicist}} Oliver Lodge's experiments {{related to the}} discovery of radio waves by German physicist Heinrich Hertz 6 years earlier. On 1 June 1894, after the death of Hertz, British physicist Oliver Lodge gave a memorial lecture on Hertz experiments. He set up a demonstration on the quasi optical nature of Hertzian waves (radio waves) and demonstrated their transmission at distances up to 50 meters. Lodge used a detector called a coherer, a glass tube containing <b>metal</b> <b>filings</b> between two electrodes. When received waves from an antenna were applied to the electrodes, the coherer became conductive allowing the current from a battery to pass through it, with the impulse being picked up by a mirror galvanometer. After receiving a signal the <b>metal</b> <b>filings</b> in the coherer had to be reset by a manually operated vibrator or by the vibrations of a bell placed on the table near by that rang every time a transmission was received. Popov set to work to design a more sensitive radio wave receiver that {{could be used as a}} lightning detector, to warn of thunderstorms by detecting the electromagnetic pulses of lightning strikes using a coherer receiver.|$|E
5000|$|In 1890, Édouard Branly {{demonstrated}} what {{he later}} called the [...] "radio-conductor," [...] which Lodge in 1893 named the coherer, the first sensitive device for detecting radio waves. Shortly after the experiments of Hertz, Dr. Branly discovered that loose <b>metal</b> <b>filings,</b> {{which in a}} normal state have a high electrical resistance, lose this resistance {{in the presence of}} electric oscillations and become conductors of electricity. This Branly showed by placing <b>metal</b> <b>filings</b> in a glass box or tube and making them part of an ordinary electric circuit. According to the common explanation, when electric waves are set up in the neighborhood of this circuit, electromotive forces are generated in it which appear to make the filings move closer together, that is, to cohere, and thus their electrical resistance decreases accordingly, Sir Oliver Lodge termed this piece of apparatus a coherer. Hence the receiving instrument, which may be a telegraph relay, that normally would not indicate any sign of current from the small battery, can be operated when electric oscillations are set up. Prof. Branly further found that when the filings had once cohered, they retained their low resistance until shaken apart, for instance, by tapping on the tube.|$|E
50|$|The museum {{contains}} the research laboratory and equipment used by Édouard Branly, a physics {{professor at the}} Institut Catholique de Paris and inventor of the first widely used radio receiver, the Branly coherer circa 1884-1886. Its collection includes a number of early devices used in wireless experiments, such as electrolytic detectors, insulated tubes filled with <b>metal</b> <b>filings,</b> a Righi oscillator, generators, electromagnets, metallic blades mounted on glass, electrical contacts, and a column of six steel balls stacked in a glass cylinder.|$|E

5000|$|The coherer is a {{primitive}} form of radio signal detector {{used in the}} first radio receivers during the wireless telegraphy era {{at the beginning of}} the 20th century. Its use in radio was based on the 1890 findings of French physicist Edouard Branly and adapted by other physicists and inventors over the next ten years. The device consists of a tube or capsule containing two electrodes spaced a small distance apart with loose <b>metal</b> <b>filings</b> in the space between. When a radio frequency signal is applied to the device, the metal particles would cling together or [...] "cohere", reducing the initial high resistance of the device, thereby allowing a much greater direct current to flow through it. In a receiver, the current would activate a bell, or a Morse paper tape recorder to make a record of the received signal. The <b>metal</b> <b>filings</b> in the coherer remained conductive after the signal (pulse) ended so that the coherer had to be [...] "decohered" [...] by tapping it with a clapper, such as a doorbell ringer, each time a signal was received, thereby restoring the coherer to its original state. Coherers remained in widespread use until about 1907, when they were replaced by more sensitive electrolytic and crystal detectors.|$|E
50|$|In 1889 Calzecchi {{assisted}} the famous physicist Galileo Ferraris, testing {{the installation of}} electric lighting in Fermo. Meanwhile, the great physics discoveries of Heinrich Hertz, Wilhelm Conrad Röntgen, Nicola Tesla and Augusto Righi were made, including the transmission of telegraph signals without wires. Since 1884 Calzecchi had been researching the properties of metal powders, finding high electrical conductivity due to various excitations such as extra current, lightning, electrostatic induction, etc. Calzecchi's experiments with tubes of <b>metal</b> <b>filings</b> {{led to the development}} of the first radio wave detector, the coherer, in 1890 by Edouard Branly.|$|E
5000|$|On 6 December 1879 he was {{appointed}} Professor of Physics at the Istituto tecnico at L'Aquila. In 1883 he transferred to the Liceo Classico [...] "A. Caro" [...] in Fermo.

In 1888 he moved to the Beccaria school in Milan as a teacher of physics.|$|E
5000|$|There {{are many}} {{different}} kinds of [...] "honing oils" [...] to suit different needs. It is important to use the appropriate solution for the job. In the case of knife sharpening, motor oil is too thick or [...] "heavy" [...] and can over-lubricate or clog a sharpening stone, whereas WD-40 is too [...] "light" [...] an oil and will not carry the <b>metal</b> <b>filings</b> plus stone dust (collectively known as [...] "swarf") away from the stone, and clog it. Not using any oil at all will also clog or [...] "glaze" [...] the stone, again reducing its cutting power. Historically sperm whale oil, Neatsfoot oil, and other animal fats were popular.|$|E
50|$|The chests were {{originally}} made of oak, {{although they were}} ultimately also offered in cherry, walnut, and maple. While a single batch of chests (numbering as many as fifty) is being built, the drawers are selected and grouped together based on the style of their grain. Each drawer is then designated for a particular slot in a chest. The chests are assembled, sanded, and finished {{all in the same}} building, and most models also receive felt drawer lining. The tall, narrow center drawer on the popular Model 52 is sized to hold a copy of Machinery's Handbook, and the mirror inside the top lid was reportedly included to aid machinists in removing <b>metal</b> <b>filings</b> from their eyes.|$|E
50|$|On flight day 7, {{the crew}} {{spent a few}} hours of off-duty time in the afternoon, but {{otherwise}} were largely focused on preparations for EVA 3. Earlier in the day, at 10:52 UTC, following leak checks, ISS Expedition 23 commander Oleg Kotov and flight engineer Alexander Skvortsov opened the hatch to the MRM-1 module. They wore eye and breathing protection as a standard precaution when entering a new module. Kotov reported that some <b>metal</b> <b>filings</b> were drifting around inside the new module as unpacking activities gathered pace, although initially he reported the interior of MRM-1 looked clean. Flight controllers both in Houston and Moscow worked with the crew to develop a technique for safely removing the floating debris.|$|E
50|$|The {{brothers}} Donald and James Herzog developed Wooly Willy {{while working}} in the Smethport Specialty Company, their father's toy production company, in Smethport, Pennsylvania, United States. The company produced tops, horseshoe-shaped magnets, and other toys until the vacuum forming devices of the 1940s and 1950s allowed the company to manufacture air-tight containers of transparent plastic. Such containers kept Wooly Willy's <b>metal</b> <b>filings</b> from leaking out and moisture that would rust the metal from leaking in. The artwork for the first Wooly Willy was created by artist Leonard Mackowski of nearby Bradford, Pa. His signature is found hidden in the grass on the reverse side. The Broadfield Toy Co., Inc., of Hempstead, New York, United States created a similar toy called Whiskers in 1925.|$|E
5000|$|While in Colorado, Tesla {{constructed}} {{many smaller}} resonance transformers and conducted further research on concatenated tuned electrical circuits. Tesla also designed various sensitive devices for detecting received electrical energy, including rotating coherers. These used a clockwork mechanism of gears {{driven by a}} coiled spring-drive which rotated a small glass cylinder containing <b>metal</b> <b>filings.</b> These experiments were the final stage after years of work on synchronized tuned electrical circuits. These instruments were constructed to demonstrate how a wireless receiver could be [...] "tuned" [...] {{to respond to a}} specific complex signal while rejecting others. Tesla logged in his diary on January 2, 1900 that a separate resonance transformer tuned to the same high frequency as a larger high-voltage resonance transformer (which acted as a transmitter) received energy from the larger coil, one of many demonstrations of the wireless transmission of electrical energy.|$|E

50|$|Plates can be {{mechanically}} roughened; {{one way is}} to rub fine <b>metal</b> <b>filings</b> {{over the}} surface with a piece of glass; the finer the filings, the smaller the grain of the surface. Special roughening tools called 'rockers' have been in use since at least the eighteenth century. The method commonly in use today is to use a steel rocker approximately five inches wide, which has between 45 and 120 teeth per inch on the face of a blade {{in the shape of a}} shallow arc, with a wooden handle projecting upwards in a T-shape. Rocked steadily from side to side at the correct angle, the rocker will proceed forward creating burrs in the surface of the copper. The plate is then moved - either rotated by a set number of degrees or through 90 degrees according to preference - and then rocked in another pass. This is repeated until the plate is roughened evenly and will print a completely solid tone of black.|$|E
5000|$|In 1890 French {{physicist}} Edouard Branly published On the Changes in Resistance of Bodies under Different Electrical Conditions in a French Journal {{where he}} described his thorough investigation {{of the effect of}} minute electrical charges on metal and many types of <b>metal</b> <b>filings.</b> In one type of circuit, filings were placed in a tube of glass or ebonite, held between two metal plates. When an electric discharge was produced in the neighbourhood of the circuit, a large deviation was seen on the attached galvanometer needle. He noted the filings in the tube would react to the electric discharge even when the tube was placed in another room 20 yards away. Branly went on to devise many types of these devices based on [...] "imperfect" [...] metal contacts. Branly's filings tube came to light in 1892 in Great Britain when it was described by Dr. Dawson Turner {{at a meeting of the}} British Association in Edinburgh. The Scottish electrical engineer and astronomer George Forbes suggested that Branly's filings tube might be reacting in the presence of Hertzian waves, a type of air-borne electromagnetic radiation proven to exist by German physicist Heinrich Hertz (later called radio waves).|$|E
50|$|Captain America convinces Wolverine {{to visit}} Cyclops, {{who is being}} held in a {{specialized}} private prison created for the reemerged mutant population, to learn where his Extinction Team might be hiding. Cyclops baits Wolverine into trying to kill him, but Wolverine lets up once he realizes that Cyclops wants to die and be made a martyr. Once returned to general population, Cyclops is joined by Jake, the only other mutant inmate in the prison. The pair soon realize that all the guards have left as three inmates approach them brandishing shivs. When the inmates move towards Jake, Cyclops tells the inmates to leave him out of this. The tattooed inmate states to Cyclops that their issue is with all mutants as he and the other two inmates attack them. However, due to his training in martial arts, Cyclops was able to defeat the three inmates. After that, he had a talk with Jake who revealed his origin to Cyclops. Cyclops then tells Jake about the Jean Grey School and they might take older students. Later that night, Cyclops uses <b>metal</b> <b>filings</b> to communicate with Magneto and tell him not to break him out as he must stay a prisoner, a political prisoner and he will not let them turn him into a criminal.|$|E
50|$|Team manager Frank Gardner {{temporarily}} {{came out}} of retirement to partner Richards at Bathurst with the team only entering the one car in 1983 (the 52-year-old Gardner explained to the press {{that he had never}} lost his skills behind the wheel and had done all of the cars testing so he knew the 635 better than most, and that he would also only drive the lunch time stint. Though many believe the cunning Gardner saw a good opportunity to win the race himself, especially after the V8's with their homologation updates had failed to make an impact at Sandown, the traditional warmup event for Bathurst). The black BMW carried a RaceCam unit that had a periscope lens poking through the roof of the car. The 635's speed was shown on the 6.172 km Mount Panorama Circuit when Richards qualified fourth for the Hardies Heroes Top 10 runoff, and managed to maintain the position after the runoff which was cause for great optimism for the race. The race however was a complete disaster from the team. After a good start Richards suddenly started falling back on lap three and came straight into the pits. It was found that <b>metal</b> <b>filings</b> had somehow made their way into the fuel system of the car which would have meant a total strip, clean and rebuild of the entire fuel system just {{to get back into the}} race. The team did manage to get the car back onto the track, but it managed only another three laps and was sadly retired after completing just six laps.|$|E
5000|$|In December {{and early}} January 1948, Irgun {{made a series}} of three barrel bomb attacks against Arab civilians in Jerusalem, opening a new phase of bloody attack and {{counter-attack}} by both sides. On December 12, 1947, a barrel bomb was pushed in front of Damascus Gate. Curious bystanders gathered around the barrel, unaware that it might contain a bomb. The explosion killed twenty people and five wounded. This was followed on December 29 by another barrel bomb at Damascus Gate, thrown from a moving taxi into a line of Arabs waiting for the bus. Prior to the explosion, Jewish gunmen sprayed the crowd with machine-gun fire. Thirteen Arabs were killed. The taxi was chased down by an angry mob and its occupants were killed and the car set on fire image right. Irgun claimed responsibility. A third barrel bomb targeting Arab civilians in Jerusalem occurred on January 7, 1948, when members of Irgun stole a police van from which they rolled a barrel bomb into a large group of civilians who were waiting for a bus by the Jaffa Gate, killing around sixteen. The bomb was described as [...] "two fifty-gallon oil drums packed tight with old nails, bits of scrap iron, hinges, rusty <b>metal</b> <b>filings.</b> At their center was a core of TNT...". In the pursuit that followed the raiders crashed into a Muslim cemetery in Mamillah Road, Jerusalem, and their vehicle was wrecked by police gunfire. Three of the attackers were killed and two taken prisoner image right.|$|E
50|$|Gardner's last {{competitive}} {{drive was}} to be as co-driver with JPS Team lead driver Jim Richards in the team's Group C spec BMW 635 CSi in the 1983 James Hardie 1000 at Bathurst. After Richards qualified the car in a brilliant 4th place in Hardies Heroes, the black and gold BMW was suddenly seen as a dark horse for the race. However, race day was {{a disaster for the}} team. On lap 3 the BMW suddenly slowed and Richards headed for the pits where the team found <b>metal</b> <b>filings</b> in the fuel system. The car only did another 4 laps before being retied from the race. Gardner would later claim that he believed the car had been sabotaged although he did not know by who and wouldn't speculate on the reason, though the car not being Australian made and its cigarette sponsorship were popular theories at the time. However, as the cigarette sponsored Holden Dealer Team (Marlboro) and Allan Moffat's Mazda team (Peter Stuyvesant) who finished Bathurst in first and second respectively were not targeted, some felt the car being European was a more likely reason. At the time, the long held Holden and Ford V8 domination of Group C touring car racing in Australia was under serious threat with factory backed teams from foreign manufacturers the likes of the European BMW, and Japanese marques Mazda and Nissan, and this was unpopular with not only the fans, but some within the sport itself. The claim of sabotage is actually disputed by Jim Richards and the team's chief mechanic Pip Baker who believe that the dirty fuel could have been a combination of things.|$|E
