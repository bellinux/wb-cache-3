5|$|Over decades, <b>Manne</b> {{recorded}} additional albums, {{or sometimes}} just {{sat in on}} drums here and there, with renowned vocalists like Ella Fitzgerald, Mel Tormé, Peggy Lee, Frank Sinatra, Ernestine Anderson, Sarah Vaughan, Lena Horne, Blossom Dearie, and Nancy Wilson. Not all the singers <b>Manne</b> accompanied were even primarily jazz artists. Performers as diverse as Teresa Brewer, Leontyne Price, Tom Waits, and Barry Manilow included <b>Manne</b> in their recording sessions.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1950s, <b>Manne</b> began to compose his own film scores, {{such as that}} for The Proper Time (1959), with the music also played by his own group, Shelly <b>Manne</b> and His Men, and issued on a Contemporary LP. In later years, <b>Manne</b> divided his time playing the drums on, adding special percussive effects to, and {{sometimes}} writing complete scores for both film and television. He even provided a musical setting for a recording of the Dr. Seuss children's classic Green Eggs and Ham (1960) and later performed in and sometimes wrote music for the backgrounds of numerous animated cartoons. For example, he joined other notable jazz musicians (including Ray Brown and Jimmy Rowles) in playing Doug Goodwin's music for the cartoon series The Ant and the Aardvark (19691971). Notable examples of later scores that <b>Manne</b> wrote himself and also performed in are, for the movies, Young Billy Young (1969) and Trader Horn (1973), and, for television, Daktari, 19661969. With these and other contributions to cartoons, children's stories, movies, television programs (and even commercials), Manne's drumming became woven into the popular culture of several decades.|$|E
5|$|<b>Manne</b> {{frequently}} {{collaborated with}} Mancini in television as well, {{such as in}} the series Peter Gunn (19581961) and Mr. Lucky (19591960). Although Mancini developed such a close partnership with <b>Manne</b> that he was using him for practically all his scores and other music at this time, the drummer still found time to perform on movie soundtracks and in TV shows with music by others, including the series Richard Diamond (music by Pete Rugolo, 19591960), and Checkmate (music by John Williams, 19591962), and the film version of Leonard Bernstein's West Side Story (1961).|$|E
50|$|His {{children}} were musician Leopold <b>Mannes</b> and writer Marya <b>Mannes.</b> His friends were many, including John D. Rockefeller, John Pierpont Morgan, Ernest Bloch, and James Reese Europe. <b>Mannes</b> was painted by friend and artist Thomas Hart Benton in Portrait of David <b>Mannes</b> and Evening Concert.|$|R
50|$|Her {{children}} were musician Leopold <b>Mannes</b> and author Marya <b>Mannes.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>Mannes</b> lived most of {{her life}} in New York City, where she was born. Her brother was {{musician}} Leopold <b>Mannes.</b> Her parents, Clara (Damrosch) <b>Mannes</b> and David <b>Mannes,</b> founded the <b>Mannes</b> College of Music in New York. Her maternal grandfather was conductor Leopold Damrosch, and her maternal uncles were conductors Walter Damrosch and Frank Damrosch. Her father was Jewish; her mother was from a mostly Lutheran German family (and was of part Jewish descent through her own grandfather).|$|R
5|$|Soon, <b>Manne</b> {{began to}} {{contribute}} to film music in a broader way, often combining jazz, pop, and classical music. Henry Mancini in particular found plenty of work for him; the two shared an interest in experimenting with tone colors, and Mancini came to rely on <b>Manne</b> to shape the percussive effects in his music. Breakfast at Tiffany's (1961), Hatari! (1962) and The Pink Panther (1963) {{are only a few}} of Mancini's films where Manne's drums and special percussive effects could be heard.|$|E
5|$|A star in Stan Kenton's famous {{orchestra}} in the 1940s and 1950s, {{as well as}} that of Woody Herman, also in the 1940s, and {{winner of}} numerous awards, <b>Manne</b> slipped from public view as jazz became less central in popular music. In the 1960s and early 1970s, however, he helped keep jazz alive on the Los Angeles scene as part owner of the nightclub Shelly's Manne-Hole on North Cahuenga Boulevard. There, the house band was Shelly <b>Manne</b> and His Men, which featured some of his favorite sidemen, such as Russ Freeman, Monty Budwig, Richie Kamuca, Conte Candoli, and later Frank Strozier, John Morell, and Mike Wofford, among many other notable West Coast jazz musicians. Also appearing was a roster of jazz stars from different eras and all regions, including Ben Webster, Rahsaan Roland Kirk, Les McCann, Bill Evans, John Coltrane, Sonny Stitt, Thelonious Monk, Michel Legrand, Carmen McRae, Milt Jackson, Teddy Edwards, Monty Alexander, Lenny Breau, Miles Davis, and many, many others. Stan Getz was the last to be featured (at a briefly occupied second location at Tetou's restaurant on Wilshire Boulevard), when, late in 1973, <b>Manne</b> was forced to close the club for financial reasons.|$|E
5|$|An {{extremely}} selective list {{of those}} with whom <b>Manne</b> performed includes Benny Carter, Earl Hines, Clifford Brown, Zoot Sims, Ben Webster, Maynard Ferguson, Wardell Gray, Lionel Hampton, Junior Mance, Jimmy Giuffre, and Stan Getz. In the 1950s, he recorded two solid albums with Sonny RollinsWay Out West (Contemporary, 1957) received particular acclaim and helped dispel the notion that West Coast jazz was always different from jazz made on the East Coastand, in the 1960s, two with Bill Evans. Around {{the same time in}} 1959, <b>Manne</b> recorded with the traditional Benny Goodman and the iconoclastic Ornette Coleman, a striking example of his versatility.|$|E
50|$|<b>Mannes</b> and Godowsky {{followed}} that route, started experimenting with color couplers, but their experiments were hindered {{by a lack}} of money, supplies and facilities. In 1922 Robert Wood, a friend of <b>Mannes,</b> wrote a letter to Kodak's chief scientist Mees, introducing <b>Mannes</b> and Godowsky and their experiments, and asking if Mees could let them use the Kodak facilities for a few days. Mees offered to help, and after meeting with <b>Mannes</b> and Godowsky agreed to supply them with multi-layer emulsions made to <b>Mannes</b> and Godowsky's specifications. Financial aid, {{in the form of a}} $20,000 loan, was supplied by the investment firm Kuhn, Loeb and Company, who had <b>Mannes</b> and Godowsky's experiments brought to their attention by a secretary working for that firm <b>Mannes</b> had acquainted.|$|R
50|$|Originally called The David <b>Mannes</b> Music School, it {{was founded}} in 1916 by David <b>Mannes,</b> concertmaster of the New York Symphony Orchestra, and his wife Clara Damrosch. In 1938, the school was renamed the <b>Mannes</b> Music School. In 1953 the school began {{offering}} degrees and changed its name to the <b>Mannes</b> College of Music. In 1960 it merged with the Chatham Square Music School. In 1989 <b>Mannes</b> joined The New School, whose eight schools included Parsons School of Design, Eugene Lang College, and The New School for Drama. In 2005, the New School administration changed the name to <b>Mannes</b> College: the New School for Music. In 2015, the university renamed it <b>Mannes</b> School of Music, and moved it to Arnhold Hall in the West Village.|$|R

5|$|From 1974 to 1977 {{he joined}} guitarist Laurindo Almeida, saxophonist and flutist Bud Shank, and bassist Ray Brown to perform {{as the group}} The L.A. Four, which {{recorded}} four albums before <b>Manne</b> left the ensemble.|$|E
5|$|From then on, as jazz {{became more}} {{prominent}} in the movies, <b>Manne</b> became the go-to percussion man in the film industry; he even appeared on screen in some minor roles. A major example is Johnny Mandel's jazz score for I Want to Live! in 1958.|$|E
5|$|Subjunctive mood is {{occasionally}} {{used for}} some verbs, but its use is in sharp decline and few speakers perceive {{the handful of}} commonly used verbs (as for instance: vore, <b>månne)</b> as separate conjugations, most of them remaining only as set of idiomatic expressions.|$|E
50|$|Clara <b>Mannes</b> (born Clara Damrosch; 12 December 1869, Breslau, Silesia - 16 March 1948, New York City) was a German-born American {{musician}} and music educator. She {{and her brother}} Frank Damrosch also taught at the Veltin School for Girls in Manhattan. With her husband, David <b>Mannes,</b> she founded the <b>Mannes</b> College The New School for Music in 1916 (then simply the David <b>Mannes</b> Music School).|$|R
50|$|His sons Frank Damrosch and Walter Johannes Damrosch, both born in Breslau, in 1859 and 1862 respectively, both succeeded him as {{conductors}} of the Oratorio Society of New York. His daughter, Clara <b>Mannes,</b> was a music teacher. His grandchildren were musician Leopold <b>Mannes</b> {{and writer}} Marya <b>Mannes.</b>|$|R
50|$|From 1928 through 1935, she was {{a student}} at the David <b>Mannes</b> Music School (now the <b>Mannes</b> College The New School for Music), where she studied with David <b>Mannes</b> and Hans Weisse. For a single season (1928-29), {{she was a}}lso a student at the Curtis Institute where she studied {{composition}} with Rosario Scalero.|$|R
5|$|When the bebop {{movement}} {{began to}} change jazz in the 1940s, <b>Manne</b> loved it and adapted to the style rapidly, performing with Dizzy Gillespie and Charlie Parker. Around this time he also worked with rising stars like Flip Phillips, Charlie Ventura, Lennie Tristano, and Lee Konitz.|$|E
5|$|From that point, <b>Manne</b> refocused his {{attention}} on his own drumming. It might be argued that he never played with more taste, refinement, and soulful swing than in the 1970s, when he recorded numerous albums with musicians like trumpeter Red Rodney, pianist Hank Jones, saxophonists Art Pepper and Lew Tabackin, and composer-arranger-saxophonist Oliver Nelson.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to Dave Tough and Jo Jones, <b>Manne</b> admired and learned from contemporaries like Max Roach and Kenny Clarke, and later from younger drummers like Elvin Jones and Tony Williams. Consciously or unconsciously, he borrowed a little {{from all of}} them, always searching to extend his playing into new territory.|$|E
50|$|Originally called The David <b>Mannes</b> Music School, it {{was founded}} in 1916 by David <b>Mannes,</b> concertmaster of the New York Symphony Orchestra, and his wife Clara Damrosch, sister of Walter Damrosch, then {{conductor}} of that orchestra and Frank Damrosch. The Damrosch and <b>Mannes</b> families were perhaps the most important music families in America at that time, with David <b>Mannes</b> emerging {{as one of the first}} American born violin recitalists to achieve significant status. David <b>Mannes</b> was the director of the Third Street Music School Settlement as well as founder of Colored Music School Settlement, all prior to founding the <b>Mannes</b> School. The School was originally housed on East 70th Street (later occupied by the Dalcroze School), a larger campus was created out of three brownstones on East 74th Street, in Manhattan's Upper East Side. After 1938, the school was known as the <b>Mannes</b> Music School, in recognition of the broader course of study that expanded the school well beyond that of a community music school, including the three-year Artist Diploma. When Clara died in 1948, their son Leopold <b>Mannes</b> became president, endowing the school with his fortune from co-inventing Kodachrome film. In 1953 the school began offering a bachelor of science degree and changed its name to the <b>Mannes</b> College of Music. In 1960 it merged with the Chatham Square Music School. In 1984 the school moved to larger quarters on West 85th Street. In 1989 <b>Mannes</b> joined The New School, whose five schools include Parsons School of Design, Eugene Lang College, and School of Drama. In 2005, the New School administration changed the name to <b>Mannes</b> College: the New School for Music. In 2015, the university renamed it <b>Mannes</b> School of Music, and moved it to Arnhold Hall in the West Village. It is now part of the College of Performing Arts at The New School, which also includes the School of Drama and the School of Jazz. Students in any of the three schools of the College of Performing Arts can take courses in the three schools (Drama, Jazz, <b>Mannes),</b> no matter which school they are directly enrolled in, expanding the opportunities for self-directed study.|$|R
50|$|David <b>Mannes</b> {{was born}} in New York in 1866. He studied the violin in Harlem with {{composer}} and violinist John Thomas Douglass, {{the son of a}} freed slave, and later in Berlin with Karel Halíř. <b>Mannes</b> was a violinist in the New York Symphony Orchestra from 1891 and its concertmaster from 1898 to 1912. In 1912 he helped found the Colored Music Settlement School and in 1916, with his wife Clara <b>Mannes</b> (the daughter of Leopold Damrosch and sister of Walter Damrosch), the <b>Mannes</b> Music School, both in New York City.|$|R
50|$|Zager {{graduated}} from University of Miami and the <b>Mannes</b> College of Music. He {{taught at the}} <b>Mannes</b> College of Music, a division of New School University, in New York.|$|R
5|$|West Coast jazz, however, {{represented}} only a {{small part}} of Manne's playing. In Los Angeles, and occasionally returning to New York and elsewhere, <b>Manne</b> recorded with musicians of all schools and styles, ranging from those of the swing era through bebop to later developments in modern jazz, including hard bop, usually seen as the antithesis to the cool jazz frequently associated with West Coast playing.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{these and}} {{numerous}} other influences, however, Shelly Manne's style of drumming was always his ownpersonal, precise, clear, {{and at the same}} time multilayered, using a very broad range of colors. <b>Manne</b> was often experimental, and had participated in such musically exploratory groups of the early 1950s as those of Jimmy Giuffre and Teddy Charles. Yet his playing never became overly cerebral, and he never neglected that element usually considered fundamental to all jazz: time.|$|E
5|$|<b>Manne</b> {{had strong}} {{preferences}} in {{his choice of}} drum set. Those preferences, however, changed several times over his career. He began with Gretsch drums. In 1957, intrigued {{by the sound of}} a kind of drum made by Leedy (then owned by Slingerland), he had a line made for him that also became popular with other drummers. In the 1970s, after trying and abandoning many others for reasons of sound or maintainability, he settled on the Japanese-made Pearl Drums.|$|E
50|$|Kaufman quit {{working to}} return to school. He {{attended}} Columbia University, and earned a master's degree and doctorate in musicology, {{under the tutelage of}} Gustave Reese at New York University. He started teaching music history and theory at <b>Mannes</b> in 1975. Four years later, the school's board announced a plan to merge <b>Mannes</b> with the Manhattan School of Music. Kaufman was named faculty spokesperson, and strongly opposed the merger. As a result of faculty protest, <b>Mannes</b> was not shut down. The New York State Board of Regents instead removed members of the school board from office and appointed Kaufman president of the institution. He oversaw the <b>Mannes</b> School's return to stable financial management and the integration of <b>Mannes</b> into The New School in 1989. He remained dean of <b>Mannes</b> College until 1996, when he was named a distinguished professor. Kaufman retired in 2002, and died in Hillsdale, New Jersey on March 17, 2016, at the age of 87.|$|R

5|$|Manne's {{father and}} uncles were drummers. In his youth he admired {{many of the}} leading swing drummers of the day, {{especially}} Jo Jones and Dave Tough. Billy Gladstone, a colleague of Manne's father and the most admired percussionist on the New York theatrical scene, offered the teenage Shelly tips and encouragement. From that time, <b>Manne</b> rapidly developed his style in the clubs of 52nd Street in New York in the late 1930s and 1940s. His first professional job with a known big band was with the Bobby Byrne Orchestra in 1940. In those years, as he became known, he recorded with jazz stars like Coleman Hawkins, Charlie Shavers, and Don Byas. He also worked {{with a number of}} musicians mainly associated with Duke Ellington, like Johnny Hodges, Harry Carney, Lawrence Brown, and Rex Stewart.|$|E
5|$|Marianne {{moved in}} with Pontecorvo at the Hôtel des Grands Hommes on the Place du Panthéon on 4 January 1938. Their son Gil was born on 30 July. Her visa expired, {{and she had to}} return to Sweden in September. Pontecorvo {{accompanied}} her, leaving Gil behind in a residential nursery in Paris. Travelling back to Paris alone, he dined with <b>Manne</b> Siegbahn and met with Niels Bohr and Lisa Meitner on 12 October 1938. Pontecorvo was now unable to return to Italy because of the Fascist regime's racial laws against the Jews. This caused the breakup of the Via Panisperna boys, with Fermi moving to the United States. Pontecorvo's family also dispersed. Guido moved to Britain in 1938, followed by Giovanni, Laura and Anna in 1939, while Gillo joined Pontecorvo in Paris.|$|E
5|$|The Gangas built many Hindu temples with {{impressive}} Dravidian gopuras containing stucco {{figures from}} the Hindu pantheon, decorated pierced screen windows which are featured in the mantapa (hall) along with saptamatrika carvings (seven heavenly mothers). Some well known examples are the Arakeshvara Temple at Hole Alur, Kapileswara temple at <b>Manne,</b> Kolaramma temple at Kolar, Rameshvara temple at Narasamangala, Nagareshvara temple at Begur and the Kallesvara temple at Aralaguppe. At Talakad they built the Maralesvara temple, the Arakesvara temple and the Patalesvara temple. Unlike the Jain temples where floral frieze decoration is common, Hindu temples were distinguished by friezes (slab of stone with decorative sculptures) illustrating episodes from the epics and puranas. Another unique legacy of the Gangas are the number of virgal (hero stones) they have left behind; memorials containing sculptural details in relief of war scenes, Hindu deities, saptamatrikas, Jain tirthankars and ritual death (such as the Doddahundi hero stone).|$|E
