They may also reduce problems with sonic fatigue on the aircraft. Micro-jets have previously been shown as a promising tool for active noise suppression. In the work presented here, compressible LES simulations have been done for slightly overexpanded conical C-D nozzle with a Mach number of 1. 58 at NPR = 4. 0 and a free stream flow Mach number of 0. 1. Two microjet configurations have been simulated. One with steady-state injection and an other with pulsating trailing-edge injection having a maximum mass flow-rate of mi/mj = 1. 6 %. The acoustic field is expanded to the far field using the Kirchhoff integral method. The effect of injection frequency and pulsation characteristics on the flow-field and the radiated sound is investigated. Comparison is made between the LES and simulations and experiments for the steady-state and no injection cases and shows excellent agreement for the screech tone frequency and the predictided OASPL is within 2 dB deviation from the measurements. The pulsating injection cases investigated show that the frequency spectrum and the noise levels are sensitive to the injection frequency as well as pulsation characteristics.

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} a hybrid propulsion transfer termed a Hohmann Spiral, incorporating low and high-thrust technologies, {{analogous to the}} high-thrust bi-elliptic transfer. To understand this transfer fully it is compared to a standard high thrust Hohmann and a bi-elliptic transfer. Two critical specific impulse ratios are derived independent of time that determine the point this novel transfer consumes the exact amount of fuel as the two compared transfer types. It is found that these ratios are valid for both a circular and elliptical starting orbit {{so long as the}} apogee of the elliptical orbit coincides with the target orbit radius. An expression representing the fuel mass fraction is derived dependent of time in order to allow a bound solution space. The final part of this paper investigates two orbit transfer case studies, one is a Geostationary Transfer Orbit to Geostationary Earth Orbit based on the Alphabus platform specification and the other is from Low Earth Orbit to an orbit near the Moon. It is found the thrust required to complete the former transfer in a specified duration of 90 days exceeds current technology and as such provides a technology requirement for future spacecraft. It is found however, for spacecraft of significantly smaller mass, in the region of 1000 kg, compared to Alphabus (<b>Max.</b> <b>mass</b> at Launch = 8100 kg), the transfer consumes the same fuel mass as a standard high-thrust Hohmann transfer with realistic low-thrust propulsion values (150 mN, 300 mN and 450 mN) within the set duration of 90 days. In addition, it is shown that utilising uprated thrusters (210 mN, 420 mN and 630 mN) a fuel mass saving can be made. This could provide a potential transfer alternative for future smaller spacecraft. The second case study is bound to a maximum thrust of 150 mN, but the mission duration is not specified to highlight the variation. It is found that the HST offers fuel mass savings of roughly 5 % compared to a standard high-thrust transfer and approximately 1. 5 % compared to a bi-elliptic transfer for different scenarios...|$|E

Methods: Eleven stage I and II breast cancer patients, 40 – 65 years old, were recruited to assess VO 2 max, BMD, weight, and percentage of body fat before and after an 8 -week exercise (aerobic and resistance training) intervention. Results: Supervised exercise significantly improved aerobic capacity (+ 4. 227 ml/kg/min; P= 0. 004) and increased, though not significantly, bone mass densities of hip (+ 0. 433 SD units; P= 0. 061) and spine (+ 0. 224 SD units; P= 0. 350).

40|$|Frequency, duration, and {{intensity}} of hot-weather events are all predicted to increase with climate warming. Despite this, mechanisms by which temperature increases affect individual fitness and drive population-level changes are poorly understood. We investigated the link between daily maximum air temperature (t max) and breeding success of Kalahari common fiscals (Lanius collaris) {{in terms of the}} daily effect on nestling body-mass gain, and the cumulative effect on size and age of fledglings. High t <b>max</b> reduced <b>mass</b> gain of younger, but not older nestlings and average nestling-period t max did not affect fledgling size. Instead, the frequency with which t max exceeded critical thresholds (t crit s) significantly reduced fledging body mass (t crit  =  33 °C) and tarsus length (t crit  =  37 °C), as well as delaying fledging (t crit  =  35 °C). Nest failure risk was 4. 2 % per day therefore delays reduced fledging probability. Smaller size at fledging often correlates with reduced lifetime fitness and might also underlie documented adult body-size reductions in desert birds in relation to climate warming. Temperature thresholds above which organisms incur fitness costs are probably common, as physiological responses to temperature are non-linear.

Fifty four male military conscripts were studied for 8 weeks during their basic training.

Acute exercise increased plasma IL- 6 in subjects with genotype CG. Moreover, during the 8 -week training period, a tendency for increased plasma IL- 6 was observed in subjects with this genotype. VO 2 max values increased in all genotype groups, but subjects with genotype CG made the greatest gains in VO 2 max. Training significantly decreased BMI only in subjects with genotype CG.

These variables were examined relative to team success in major international hockey competition (group 1 : Canada and USA, group 2 : Sweden and Finland, group 3 : All other participating countries), age group (Under 18 and Senior/Open Levels), and player position (forwards, defenders, and goalies). The athletes from countries with the best international records weighed more, yet had less body fat, had greater lower body muscular power and upper body strength, and higher aerobic capacity compared with their less successful counterparts. Compared with the younger athletes, athletes from the senior-level age group weighed more and had higher scores for lower body power, pull-ups, and aerobic capacity. There {{were no significant differences}} in anthropometric or fitness data based on player position. This study is the first to report the physical characteristics of a worldwide sample of elite female ice hockey players relative to team performance, age, and player position. Coaches should use these data to identify talent, test for strengths and weaknesses in conditioning programs, and design off-ice programs that will help athletes match the fitness profiles of the most successful teams in the world...|$|R
40|$|INTRODUCTION : The {{quantification}} {{of heart}} rate variability (HRV) is a tool to assess the interaction between exercise and autonomic control, {{as well as the}} pathophysiology of diseases affecting autonomic function. Little is known about the influence of genetically influenced physiology on exercise-induced changes in autonomic cardiac regulation. It was theorised that preintervention values for blood pressure, VO 2 <b>max,</b> body <b>mass</b> index (BMI), autonomic function and gender contribute significantly to the exercise-induced changes in HRV. METHODS : A 12 -week, medium-to-high intensity exercise intervention was completed by 183 volunteers (18 – 22  years). Data were sampled at baseline and after 12  weeks. Standard time domain, frequency domain and Poincaré HRV quantification techniques were implemented. Regression analysis was performed to determine the influences of the predictors (baseline values for low frequency (LF), high frequency (HF), BMI, VO 2 max, gender, blood pressure) on the exercise-induced response of the dependent variables (changes in HRV-indicator values). RESULTS : Parameters found to be significant (p< 0. 05) predictors of exercise-induced changes were LF, HF and systolic blood pressure in, respectively, 10, 5 and 2 of the 12 regressions performed. The results indicated that the independent variables contribute between 12. 83 % and 29. 82 %, depending on the specific HRV indicator, to the exercise-induced changes in the autonomic nervous system. CONCLUSIONS :Preintervention autonomic status, as represented specifically by LF, is the most important determinant of cardiac autonomic response to an exercise intervention in a healthy study population. Baseline autonomic function could thus be a significant confounder in the outcome of exercise study results. [URL]...|$|R
40|$|A phys. {{model for}} {{compressible}} flows with phase transition is described, {{in which all}} the processes of phase transition, i. e. nucleation, droplet growth, droplet evapn. and de-nucleation, are incorporated. The model is focused on dil. mixts. of vapor and droplets in a carrier gas with typical <b>max.</b> liq. <b>mass</b> fraction smaller than 0. 02. The new model is based on a reinterpretation of P. G. Hill (1966) method of moments of the droplet size distribution function. Starting from the general dynamic equation, it is emphasized that nucleation or de-nucleation correspond to the rates at which droplets enter or leave droplet size space, resp. Nucleation and de-nucleation have to be treated differently in agreement with their differences in phys. nature. Attention is given to the droplet growth model that takes into account Knudsen effects and temp. differences between droplets and gas. The new phase transition model is then combined with the Euler equations and results in a new numerical method: ASCE 2 D. The numerical method is first applied to the problem of shock/expansion wave formation in a closed shock tube with humid nitrogen as a driver gas. Nucleation and droplet growth are induced by the expansion wave, and in turn affect the structure of the expansion wave. When the main shock, reflected from the end wall of the low-pressure section, passes the condensation zone, evapn. and de-nucleation occur. As a second example, the problem of the flow of humid nitrogen in a pulse-expansion wave tube, designed to study nucleation and droplet growth in monodisperse clouds, is investigated exptl. and numerically.

40|$|Purpose - We used {{multiple}} regression analyses to determine {{the relationships between the}} decrement in sea level (SL, 760 Torr) V˙O 2 max during hypobaric hypoxia (HH) and variables that could alter or be related to the decrement in V˙O 2 max. Methods - HH conditions consisted of 682 Torr, 632 Torr, and 566 Torr, and the measured independent variables were SL-V˙O 2 max, SL lactate threshold (SL-LT), the change in hemoglobin saturation at V˙O 2 max between 760 and 566 Torr (ΔSaO 2 <b>max),</b> lean body <b>mass</b> (LBM), and gender. Male (N = 14) and female (N = 14) subjects of varied fitness, training status, and residential altitude (1, 640 - 2, 460 m) completed cycle ergometry tests of V˙O 2 max at each HH condition under randomized and single-blinded conditions. Results - V˙O 2 max decreased significantly from 760 Torr after 682 Torr (∼ 915 m) (3. 5 ± 0. 9 to 3. 4 ± 0. 8 L·min − 1, P = 0. 0003).

40|$|PurposeData {{on weight}} history may enhance the {{predictive}} validity of epidemiological {{models of the}} health risks of obesity but collecting such data is often not feasible. In this study, we investigate the validity of a summary measure of weight history. MethodsWe evaluated the quality of reporting of maximum weight {{in a sample of}} adults ages 50 - 84 using data from the Health and Retirement Study. Recalled <b>max</b> body <b>mass</b> index (BMI, measured in kg/m 2) based on recalled weight in 2004 was compared to calculated max BMI based on self-reported weight collected biennially between 1992 and 2004. Logistic regression was used to assess similarity between the measures in predicting prevalent conditions. ResultsThe correlation coefficient between recalled and calculated max weight in the overall sample was 0. 95. Recalled max BMI value was within 3 BMI units of the calculated value 91. 4 % of the time. The proportion of individuals obese I (BMI 30. 0 - 34. 9), obese II (35. 0 - 39. 9) and obese III (40. 0 and above) were 28. 8 %, 12. 7 % and 6. 6 % using recalled values compared to 27. 1 %, 10. 5 % and 4. 9 % using calculated values. In multivariate analyses, the two BMI measures similarly predicted disease prevalence across a number of chronic conditions. ConclusionsRecalled max BMI was strongly correlated with max BMI calculated over the twelve year period prior to recall, suggesting that this measure can serve as a reliable summary measure of recent weight status.

40|$|Atheromatosis {{develops}} as {{a result}} of a chronic inflammatory process of the arteries. Inflammatory biomarkers, particularly high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP), positively correlate with atheromatosis risk factors and can be used to estimate and predict the risk of cardiovascular events. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the relationship between hsCRP concentration and BMI, body composition, classical risk factors for cardiovascular diseases, energy expenditure for physical activity (WEE) and [*]·VO 2 max. 166 volunteers (78 women and 88 men) were included in the examinations. Their mean age was 20. 2 ± 0. 9 years. Health condition was described by the following variables: smoking, WEE, [*]·VO 2 <b>max,</b> body <b>mass</b> index (BMI), waist-to-hip ratio (WHR), fat mass (FM), fat-free mass (FFM), lipid profile, hsCRP, glucose and insulin concentration, and insulin resistance. Between the subgroups created on the basis of hsCRP concentration, in quartiles 1 to 3 and quartile 4, a comparative analysis was carried out. 79. 5 � 0 of women and 69. 3 � 0 of men had hsCRP values within the references ranges. Moderately high values were found in 14. 1 � 0 of women and 22. 7 � 0 of men and high in 6. 4 � 0 and 7. 9 � 20 respectively. Mean values of BMI, FFM, WHR, WEE, [*]·VO 2 max, glucose and triglyceride concentration, and TC/HDL index were significantly lower, while FM and HDL were significantly higher, in women than in men. In the quartile 4 subgroup compared to the quartile 1 - 3 subgroup, we found significantly lower HDL concentration and a tendency for higher values of BMI (p= 0. 06) and TC (p= 0. 07) as well as higher percentages of smoking among men.
