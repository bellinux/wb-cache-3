40|$|The {{protein and}} energy content and an {{estimation}} of the cost per pound of protein and per <b>Megacalorie</b> (Mcal) of net energy of lactation (NEL) of some common feedstuffs are in Table 1. Two main weaknesses must be considered when using the cost/nutrient method. Feeds should be evaluated on their most valuable nutrient or what the feed is purchased for, whether it is protein, ener-gy, or some other nutrient. Distillers grains (DG) are difficult to evaluate with this method as they supply both energy and protein. They are also {{a good source of}} rumen undegradable protein, which is usually required to sustain higher milk production levels. Other factors not accounted for are feed palatability...|$|E
40|$|Economical and {{biological}} efficiencies of beef production to weaning and to slaughter were estimated in three groups, different in milk available (low, medium, and high) to the calves {{but with the}} same potential for growth. Data from different breed groups of cows (low [L] = Hereford x Angus, medium [M] = Red Poll x Angus, and high [H] = Milking Shorthorn x Angus) were used. Economical efficiency was the ratio of income to expenses {{and biological}} efficiency was the ratio of calf weight to total feed energy required. Income was derived from cull cows and calves at weaning or carcasses of calves fed to slaughter. Feed and non-feed expenses for the cowherd and for calves to weaning or to slaughter were included in economical efficiency. Efficiencies were estimated assuming observed reproductive rates and energy requirements for maintenance, {{as well as for}} equal reproductive rates and equal energy requirements for maintenance in the M and H groups. With slaughter were 28. 1, 27. 2, and 27. 5 g of weaning weight and 22. 0, 20. 4, and 20. 3 g of carcass weight per <b>megacalorie</b> of ME for L, M, and H, respectively; the corresponding values using equal reproduction and equal maintenance in M and H were 28. 3, 27. 2, and 27. 4 g of weaning weight and 22. 1, 20. 5, and 20. 5 g of carcass weight per <b>megacalorie</b> of ME. Economical efficiencies (dollars of income x 100 /dollars of expense) under the observed reproductive rates and maintenance requirements were 90. 3, 89. 2, and 88. 1 to weaning and were 99. 5, 96. 5, and 95. 3 to slaughter for L, M, and H, respectively; under equal reproduction and equal maintenance in M and H, the efficiencies at weaning were 91. 0, 88. 4, and 88. 9 and at slaughter were 100. 0, 95. 7, and 95. 1. Across the two scenarios, L was always the most economically efficient, especially when evaluated at slaughter of calves. Economical efficiency comparisons agreed closely with the observed reproductive rates and maintenance biological efficiency comparisons of the three cattle requirements, biological efficiencies to weaning and to groups...|$|E

40|$|Master of AgribusinessDepartment of Agricultural EconomicsElizabeth YeagerThe {{corn silage}} market is {{typically}} focused {{heavily on the}} dairy market and results for corn silage plots are dedicated to the dairy industry specifically {{to get to the}} overall answer of $ Milk/Acre. The beef cattle industry is more interested in pounds of beef that can be gained from corn silage. There are roughly 6. 2 million acres of corn silage in the US. Within that 6 million acres, roughly half is fed to beef cattle, but the corn silage industry has not focused on this aspect of the market. Within Mycogen Seeds there has been an ever increasing demand {{to find a way to}} deliver the corn silage plot data in a useable format for beef producers. By delivering corn silage plot data to beef producers, Mycogen has aspirations of increasing it’s market share of the corn silage market in Kansas as well as across the US, while at the same time increasing the awareness of how quality of a corn silage hybrid can affect a producers operation. This thesis examines corn silage plot info sample analysis and specific feed analysis calculations. With these specific calculations, the corn silage plot will illustrate information in a form that beef producers will understand, $ Beef Produced/Acre. At the same time, this thesis will examine the industry wide concept that tonnage is the only component that is important when selecting a corn silage hybrid. Finally this thesis will examine at what point ($/bushel) in the corn grain market does it make sense to start looking at utilizing corn silage over dry rolled corn by comparing price per <b>MegaCalorie</b> of energy by utilizing 25 year historical corn grain prices and using the Purdue Method of determining the cost of corn silage on a per ton basis...|$|E

40|$|Currently {{there is}} {{increased}} emphasis on production of lean beef with desirable palatability characteristics. Changes in both the type of animal produced and the feeding and management of these animals {{may be needed to}} efficiently produce this product. One change in feeding that could be made is the energy density of the feed, measured as <b>megacalories</b> of metabolizable energy per pound (Mcal ME/lb). At low energy densities, the amount of feed that can be consumed limits the animal 2 ̆ 7 s intake of metabolizable energy. Over the past two decades, several experiments at U. S. Meat Animal Research Center have examined a number of factors, including energy density, that can affect carcass composition and palatability. The purpose of this report is to review these experiments and summarize the effects of energy density on carcass composition and palatability traits...|$|R
40|$|The {{intake of}} the dry matter (DM), the crude protein (CP) and the metabolizable energy intake (ME) in <b>megacalories</b> per day (Mcal/day) were not {{affected}} by the diets. In contrast, the intake of neutral detergent fiber (NDF), in g/kg BW, increased linearly. An increasing linear effect was also observed for the ether extract (EE) intake, whereas a decreasing linear performance was observed for the non-fibrous carbohydrate (NFC) intake. The digestibility of DM, organic matter and NFC decreased linearly with the sunflower cake inclusion, whereas the digestibility of CP, NDF, and EE were not influenced by the diets. No effect was observed for the concentration of serum glucose or urea nitrogen serum. No effect was observed on the urea nitrogen serum in the hours after feeding; however, including sunflower cake in the diets resulted in a quadratic performance for the serum glucose concentrations in the hours after feeding. The average daily gain (ADG) had a decreasing linear effect, and the food conversions of the DM, CP, NDF, NFC and ME had increasing linear effects. The feeding costs decreased {{with the level of}} sunflower cake...|$|R
40|$|For both {{period and}} {{cumulative}} growth performance data, there were trends for increased feed intake and increased feed to gain ratios associated with increasing concentrations of dietary clinoptilolite. If, however, efficiency was expressed as daily intake of <b>megacalories</b> of metabolizable energy, {{there were no}} treatment effects. This lack of treatment response is illustrated by overall cumulative efficiencies of 4. 39, 4. 39, 4. 40, and 4. 31 Mcal. metabolizable energy/pound of weight gain for pigs fed diets containing 0, 2, 4, and 8 % clinoptilolite. The decreased carcass backfat and increased carcass lean content associated with increasing concentrations of dietary clinoptilolite are responses that were probably caused by the concomitant increases in dietary protein (amino acid) to metabolizable energy ratios. Chemical analyses of feces for nitrogen and phosphorus revealed two relationships with dietary clinoptilolite concentration. First, both nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations in feces decreased with increasing dietary clinoptilolite concentrations. These responses likely resulted because the clinoptilolite increased the volume of feces. Second, the ratio of nitrogen to phosphorus increased with increasing dietary clinoptilolite concentration. This response probably resulted because ammonia nitrogen was sequestered by clinoptilolite because of its ion exchange properties...|$|R
40|$|Our {{long-term}} {{objective is}} to develop breeding strategies for improving feed efficiency in dairy cattle. In this study, phenotypic data were pooled across multiple research stations to facilitate investigation of the genetic and nongenetic components of feed efficiency in Holstein cattle. Specifically, the heritability of residual feed intake (RFI) was estimated and heterogeneous relationships between RFI and traits relating to energy utilization were characterized across research stations. Milk, fat, protein, and lactose production converted to <b>megacalories</b> (milk energy; MilkE), dry matter intakes (DMI), and body weights (BW) were collected on 6, 824 lactations from 4, 893 Holstein cows from research stations in Scotland, the Netherlands, and the United States. Weekly DMI, recorded between 50 to 200 d in milk, was fitted as a linear function of MilkE, BW 0. 75, and change in BW (¿BW), along with parity, a fifth-order polynomial on days in milk (DIM), and the interaction between this polynomial and parity in a first-stage model. The residuals from this analysis {{were considered to be}} a phenotypic measure of RFI. Estimated partial regression coefficients of DMI on MilkE and on BW 0. 75 ranged from 0. 29 to 0. 47 kg/Mcal for MilkE across research stations, whereas estimated partial regression coefficients on BW 0. 75 ranged from 0. 06 to 0. 16 kg/kg 0. 75. Estimated partial regression coefficients on ¿BW ranged from 0. 06 to 0. 39 across stations. Heritabilities for country-specific RFI were based on fitting second-stage random regression models and ranged from 0. 06 to 0. 24 depending on DIM. The overall heritability estimate across all research stations and all DIM was 0. 15 ± 0. 02, whereas an alternative analysis based on combining the first- and second-stage model as 1 model led to an overall heritability estimate of 0. 18 ± 0. 02. Hence future genomic selection programs on feed efficiency appear to be promising; nevertheless, care should be taken to allow for potentially heterogeneous variance components and partial relationships between DMI and other energy sink traits across environments when determining RFI...|$|R
