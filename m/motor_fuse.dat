Most automobile manufacturers have developed hybrid vehicles that combine an internal combustion engine and an electric <b>motor,</b> <b>fusing</b> the advantages of these two power sources. For example Toyota in its Prius II uses a gasoline engine which achieves high efficiency by using a modified Atkinson cycle based on variable valve timing management. This implementation of the Atkinson cycle is not the optimal solution because e. g. some of the air is first sucked from the intake manifold into the cylinder and subsequently returned. This oscillating air stream considerably reduces the thermal conversion efficiency of this cycle. In this paper the losses in the thermal conversion efficiency of internal combustion engines, and especially of Atkinson cycles, are analyzed in detail and a proposal for an improvement cycle for such applications is made. cs 201...|$|R

Meiotic spindles of metaphase-arrested oocytes are relatively stable, however, meiotic spindles of in vitro–activated oocytes are highly dynamic: the spindles elongate, rotate around their long axis, and undergo an acute pivoting movement to reorient perpendicular to the oocyte surface.

40|$|AbstractCa 2 +-calmodulin (CaM) {{function}} was selectively disrupted {{in a specific}} subset of growth cones in transgenic Drosophila embryos in which a specific enhancer element drives {{the expression of the}} kinesin <b>motor</b> domain <b>fused</b> to a CaM antagonist peptide (kinesin-antagonist or KA, which blocks CaM binding to target proteins) or CaM itself (kinesin-CaM or KC, which acts as a Ca 2 +-binding protein). In both KA and KC mutant embryos, specific growth cones exhibit dosage-dependent stalls in axon extension and errors in axon guidance, including both defects in fasciculation and abnormal crossings of the midline. These results demonstrate an in vivo function for Ca 2 +-CaM signaling in growth cone extension and guidance and suggest that Ca 2 +-CaM may in part regulate specific growth cone decisions, including when to defasciculate and whether or not to cross the midline...|$|R
40|$|Budding yeast {{possesses}} one myosin-II, Myo 1 p, whereas fission yeast has two, Myo 2 p and Myp 2 p, all {{of which}} contribute to cytokinesis. We find that chimeras consisting of Myo 2 p or Myp 2 p <b>motor</b> domains <b>fused</b> to the tail of Myo 1 p are fully functional in supporting budding yeast cytokinesis. Remarkably, the tail alone of budding yeast Myo 1 p localizes to the contractile ring, supporting both its constriction and cytokinesis. In contrast, fission yeast Myo 2 p and Myp 2 p require both the catalytic head domain as well as tail domains for function, with the tails providing distinct functions (Bezanilla and Pollard, 2000). Myo 1 p is the first example of a myosin whose cellular function {{does not require a}} catalytic motor domain revealing a novel mechanism of action for budding yeast myosin-II independent of actin binding and ATPase activity...|$|R

In motility assays, K 433 myt and K 411 myt, which preserve the head-proximal kinesin hinge, and K 367 myt, which deletes it, drove rapid microtubule sliding (∼ 0. 6 μms− 1) that was optimal when the head-pairs were spaced apart by adding 1 : 1 headless myosin tails. K 376 myt, which partially deletes the head-proximal hinge, showed poor motility in sliding assays but wild type processivity, velocity and stall force in single molecule optical trapping. Accordingly, the head-proximal kinesin hinge is functionally dispensable...|$|R

The movements of the spindle after oocyte activation provide new information about the dynamic changes in the spindle that occur upon re-entry into meiosis and completion of the meiotic divisions.

40|$|The {{basic unit}} of {{skeletal}} muscle in all metazoans is the multinucleate myofiber, within which individual nuclei are regularly positioned 1. The molecular machinery responsible for myonuclear positioning is not known. Improperly positioned nuclei are {{a hallmark of}} numerous muscles diseases 2, including centronuclear myopathies 3, but {{it is unclear whether}} correct nuclear positioning is necessary for muscle function. Here we identify the microtubule-associated protein Ensconsin(Ens) /MAP 7 and Kinesin Heavy Chain (Khc) /Kif 5 b as essential, evolutionary conserved regulators of myonuclear positioning in Drosophila and cultured mammalian myotubes. We find that these proteins physically interact and that expression of the Kif 5 b <b>motor</b> domain <b>fused</b> to the MAP 7 microtubule binding domain rescues nuclear positioning defects in MAP 7 depleted cells. This suggests that MAP 7 links Kif 5 b to the microtubule cytoskeleton to promote nuclear positioning. Finally we demonstrate that myonuclear positioning is physiologically important. Drosophila ens mutant larvae display decreased locomotion and incorrect myonuclear positioning, and these phenotypes are rescued by muscle specific expression of Ens. We conclude that improper nuclear positioning contributes to muscle dysfunction in a cell autonomous fashion...|$|R
40|$|The myosin head {{consists}} of a globular catalytic domain and a light chain binding domain (LCBD). The coupling efficiency between ATP hydrolysis and myosin−induced actin movement is known to decline as the LCBD is truncated or destabilized. However, {{it was not clear}} whether the observed alteration in the production of force and movement reflects only the mechanical changes to the length of the LCBD or whether these changes also affect the kinetic properties of the catalytic domain. Here we show that replacement of the LCBD with genetically engineered domains of similar rigidity and dimensions produces functional molecular motors with unchanged kinetic properties. The resulting single−chain, single−headed motors were produced in Dictyostelium discoideum and obtained after purification from a standard peptone−based growth medium at levels of up to 12 mg/l. Their actin motility properties are similar or greater than those of native myosin. Rates of 2. 5 and 3. 3 microm/s were observed for <b>motor</b> domains <b>fused</b> to one or two of these domains, respectively. Their kinetic and functional similarity to the extensively studied myosin subfragment 1 (S 1) and their accessibility to molecular genetic approaches makes these simple constructs ideal models for the investigation of chemo−mechanical coupling in the myosin moto...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Conventional kinesin {{is capable}} of long-range, processive {{movement}} along microtubules, a property that has been assumed to be important for its role in membrane transport. Here we have investigated whether the Caenorhabditis elegans monomeric kinesin unc 104 and the sea urchin heteromeric kinesin KRP 85 / 95, two {{other members of the}} kinesin superfamily that function in membrane transport, are also processive. Both <b>motors</b> were <b>fused</b> to green fluorescent protein, and the fusion proteins were tested for processive ability using a single-molecule fluorescence imaging microscope. Neither unc 104 -GFP nor KRP 85 / 95 -GFP exhibited processive movement (detection limit 40 nm), although both motors were functional in multiple motor microtubule gliding assays (V) 1760 (540 and 202 (37 nm/s, respectively). Moreover, the ATP turnover rates (5. 5 and 3. 1 ATPs per motor domain per second, respectively) are too low to give rise to the observed microtubule gliding velocities, if only a single motor were driving transport with an 8 nm step per ATPase cycle. Instead, the results suggest that these motors have low duty cycles and that high processivity may not be required for efficient vesicle transport. Conventional kinesin’s unusual processivity may be required for efficient transport of protein complexes that cannot carry multiple motors. Kinesins are motor proteins that move along microtubule...|$|R
40|$|Applications with {{physical}} human-robot interaction require {{a high level}} of safety even in case of software or hardware failures. This paper highlights the advantages of combining tendon actuation with transmission elasticity to maximize safety for robotic arms sharing workspaces with humans. To this end, the collision behavior of combinations of tendon or joint and elastic or stiff actuation with geared electrical motors as reliable actuators is compared using the lightweight BioRob arm as robotic platform in simulation. For the comparison a worst case scenario is assumed in which the robot arm is accelerated with maximum supply voltage over its joint range and collides with maximum end-effector velocity. The study shows that the robot arm achieves end-effector velocities as high as 6 m/s and that elastic tendon actuation reduces the end-effector impact energy and force by up to 90 % compared to stiff joint actuation. A considerable reduction of the gearbox stress is also achieved. In addition, the effect of <b>motor</b> current <b>fuses</b> limiting the <b>motor</b> torques is evaluated. It is shown that for the given high speed scenario, torque limiting devices can be effective to prevent excessive clamping forces in case of failure, but can not reduce the impact peak force without heavily compromising the robot dynamics. The main design criterion for safety should therefore be lightweight link design and compliant actuation, which can be achieved by using elastic tendon actuation. The paper concludes with the comparison of safety properties of robotic arms in research and industry. ...|$|R
40|$|International audienceWe {{address the}} problem of ego-noise reduction,i. e., suppressing the noise a robot causes by its own motions. Such noise degrades the {{recorded}} microphone signal massivelysuch that the robot’s auditory capabilities suffer. To suppressit, it is intuitive to use also motor data, since it providesadditional information about the robot’s joints and therebythe noise sources. We propose to <b>fuse</b> <b>motor</b> data to a recentlyproposed multichannel dictionary algorithm for ego-noise reduction. At training, a dictionary is learned that captures spatialand spectral characteristics of ego-noise. At testing, nonlinearclassifiers are used to efficiently associate the current robot’smotor state to relevant sets of entries in the learned dictionary. By this, computational load is reduced by one third in typicalscenarios while achieving at least the same noise reductionperformance. Moreover, we propose to train dictionaries ondifferent microphone array geometries and use them for egonoisereduction while the head to which the microphonesare mounted is moving. In such scenarios, the motor guidedapproach results in significantly better performance values...|$|R
40|$|Amyotrophic lateral {{sclerosis}} (ALS) is a fatal neurodegenerative disorder due to <b>motor</b> neuron loss. <b>Fused</b> in sarcoma (FUS) protein carrying ALS-associated mutations localizes {{to stress}} granules and causes their coalescence into larger aggregates. Here {{we show that}} Pur-alpha physically interacts with mutated FUS in an RNA-dependent manner. Pur-alpha colocalizes with FUS carrying mutations in stress granules of motoneuronal cells differentiated from {{induced pluripotent stem cells}} and that are derived from ALS patients. We observe that both Pur-alpha and mutated FUS upregulate phosphorylation of the translation initiation factor eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 alpha and consistently inhibit global protein synthesis. In vivo expression of Pur-alpha in different Drosophila tissues significatively exacerbates the neurodegeneration caused by mutated FUS. Conversely, the downregulation of Pur-alpha in neurons expressing mutated FUS significatively improves fly climbing activity. All these findings suggest that Pur-alpha, through the control of mRNA translation, might be involved in the pathogenesis of ALS associated with the mutation of FUS, and that an alteration of protein synthesis may be directly implicated in the disease. Finally, in vivo RNAi-mediated ablation of Pur-alpha produced locomotion defects in Drosophila, indicating a pivotal role for this protein in the motoneuronal function...|$|R

Two unc- 45 genes are found in vertebrates, a general cell isoform, unc 45 a, and a striated muscle-specific isoform, unc 45 b. We have investigated the role of both isoforms of mouse Unc 45 in myosin folding using an in vitro synthesis and folding assay. A smooth muscle myosin <b>motor</b> domain (MD) <b>fused</b> to green fluorescent protein (GFP) (MD::GFP) was used as substrate, and folding was measured by native gel electrophoresis and functional assays. In the absence of Unc 45, the MD::GFP chimera folds poorly. Addition of either Unc 45 a or Unc 45 b dramatically enhances the folding in a reaction that is dependent on Hsp 90 ATPase activity. Unc 45 a {{is more effective than}} Unc 45 b with a higher apparent affinity and greater extent of folding. The Unc 45 -Hsp 90 chaperone complex acts late in the folding pathway and promotes motor domain maturation after release from the ribosome. Unc 45 a behaves kinetically as an activator of the folding reaction by stimulating the rate of the Hsp 90 -dependent folding by > 20 -fold with an apparent Kact of 33 nm. This analysis of vertebrate Unc 45 isoforms clearly demonstrates a direct role for Unc 45 in Hsp 90 -mediated myosin motor domain folding and highlights major differences between the isoforms in substrate specificity and mechanism...|$|R
40|$|Damping in a {{multitude}} of engineering applications has a variable threshold requirement based on the input excitation given to the system. In most applications the desired system response is known but the input to the system is a time dependent function with fluctuating amplitudes and frequencies. Therefore for optimal performance the damping characteristics of a given system {{must be able to}} adapt to increase or decrease the amount of energy being absorbed by the system. In most mechanical systems (including vehicles) damping is achieved through a viscous medium; such as hydraulic oil. Although the oil is capable of absorbing the unwanted energy in the system, its passive nature limits its ability to achieve an optimal amount of damping given the excitation. To achieve the requisite functionality of variable damping; {{a multitude}} of solutions have been implemented, proposed, and evaluated at both commercial and academic research levels. These solutions have met the variable damping requirements but have significant cant drawbacks associated with them. To address the shortcomings associated with the aforementioned variable damping solutions, a hybrid design consisting of a conventional hydraulic damper and a linear <b>motor</b> topology was <b>fused</b> together to produce a hybrid variable damper. In this hybrid design, the oil in the system acts as bias and the linear motor topology allows for variability in the amount of damping being provided to the system. This hybrid design allows for the requisite variable damping requirement to be achieved. In addition to the hybrid design being able to achieve variable damping, it has the capacity to act as a generator and also provide fail-safe operation due to the viscous bias. Through analytical, FEM analysis and experimental modeling the hybrid damper has been characterized and {{with a high level of}} agreement between the various results. This work has also shown that the design is capable of achieving variable damping with the capacity to recover energy from the system...|$|R
