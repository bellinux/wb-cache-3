40|$|Simultaneous {{simulation}} of HXR and <b>MW</b> <b>emission</b> {{with the same}} populations of electrons is still a great challenge for interpretation of observations in real events. In this paper we apply the FP kinetic model of precipitation of electron beam with energy range from 12 keV to 1. 2 MeV to the interpretation of X-ray and microwave emissions observed in the flare of 10 March 2001. Methods. The theoretical HXR and MW emissions were calculated by using the distribution functions of electron beams found by solving time-dependent Fokker-Planck approach in a converging magnetic field (Zharkova at al., 2010; Kuznetsov and Zharkova, 2010) for anisotropic scattering of beam electrons on the ambient particles in Coloumb collisions and Ohmic losses. The simultaneous observed HXR photon spectra and frequency distribution of <b>MW</b> <b>emission</b> and polarization were fit by those simulated from FP models which include the effects of electric field induced by beam electrons and precipitation into a converging magnetic loop. Magnetic field strengths in the footpoints on the photosphere were updated with newly calibrated SOHO/MDI data. The observed HXR energy spectrum above 10 keV is {{shown to be a}} double power law which was fit precisely by the photon HXR spectrum simulated for the model including the self-induced electric field but without magnetic convergence. The <b>MW</b> <b>emission</b> simulated for different models of electron precipitation revealed a better fit to the observed distribution at higher frequencies for the models combining collisions and electric field effects with a moderate magnetic field convergence of 2.

40|$|We {{investigate}} the spectra and polarization of the gyrosynchrotron microwave (<b>MW)</b> <b>emission</b> generated by anisotropic electron beams {{in the solar}} corona. The electron distributions are selected from the steady propagation/ precipitation model of beam electrons obtained from the time-dependent solutions of the FokkerPlanck equation taking into account particle anisotropic precipitation into a converging magnetic tube while losing energy in collisions and Ohmic losses induced by a self-induced electric field. We separate the effects of converging magnetic field from those of self-induced electric field for beams with different initial energy fluxes and spectral indices. The effect of returning electrons of the beam is negligible for the beams with relatively weak energy fluxes (F 1010 erg cm 2 s 1), while it becomes {{very important for the}} electron beams with F 1012 erg cm 2 s 1. Electric field-induced losses lead to the increase of <b>MW</b> <b>emission</b> intensity, especially at larger viewing angles (140, looking at the loop from a side). The polarization remains typical for the beam-like distributions. The combined effect of the self-induced electric field and converging magnetic field reveals a noticeable (up to a factor of 10) increase of the emission intensity (for the viewing angles 140150) in comparison with the models considering only collision factor, especially in the deeper precipitation layers (near the loop footpoints). Thus, considering the self-induced electric field is especially important for the resulting <b>MW</b> <b>emission</b> intensity, spectra shape, and polarization that can provide much closer correlation of simulations with observations in solar flares...|$|E

A peculiarity of the flare was the detection of γ [...] emission that is unusual for such weak and short event. The analysis revealed the presence of a flare precursor detected about 5 minutes before the flare onset in 94 Å images which spatially coincided with the non-polarized microwave (MW) source at 17 GHz (the Nobeyama Radio Heliograph) that is the Neutral Line associated Source (NLS). A comparison of the results obtained from MW data by the Nobeyama Radio Polarimeters and the multi-frequency Siberian radioheliograph (the new 10 -antenna radio heliograph prototype at 4. 6 and 6. 4 GHz) and hard X-ray (HXR) observations by the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope reveal the presence of accelerated electrons during the flare initial phase.

The traditional methods of their spectral inversion have some problems that can be mainly attributed to the unrealistic and the oversimplified treatment of the flare emission. To properly address this problem, we use a Non-linear Force Free Field (NLFFF) model extrapolated from an observed photospheric magnetogram as input to the three-dimensional, multi-wavelength modeling platform GX Simulator, and create a unified electron population model that can simultaneously reproduce the observed HXR and MW observations.

Our results suggest that the HXR-emitting electron population model fits the standard flare model with a broken power-law spectrum (E_break ~ 200 keV) that simultaneously produces the HXR footpoint emission and the MW high frequency emission.

The pre-flare phase of this event is characterized by spectacular large-scale contraction of overlying extreme ultraviolet (EUV) coronal loops during which the loop system was subjected to an altitude decrease of ~ 20 Mm for an extended span of ~ 30 min. This contraction phase is accompanied by sequential EUV brightenings associated with hard X-ray (HXR) (up to 25 keV) and microwave (MW) sources from low-lying loops in the core of the flaring region which together with X-ray spectra indicate strong localized heating in the source region before the filament activation and associated M-class flare. With the onset of the impulsive phase of the M 6. 2 flare, we detect HXR and MW sources that exhibit intricate temporal and spatial evolution in relation with the fast rise of the prominence. Following the flare maximum, the filament eruption slowed down and subsequently confined within the large overlying active region loops; the event did not lead to a coronal mass ejection (CME). During the confinement process of the erupting prominence, we detect <b>MW</b> <b>emission</b> from the extended coronal region with multiple emission centroids which likely represent emission from hot blobs of plasma formed {{after the collapse of the}} expanding flux rope and entailing prominence material. RHESSI observations reveal high plasma temperature (~ 30 MK) and substantial non-thermal characteristics with electron spectral index (~ 5) during the impulsive phase of the flare. The time-evolution of thermal energy exhibits a good correspondence with the variations in cumulative non-thermal energy which suggest that the energy of accelerated particles efficiently converted to hot flare plasma implying an effective validation of the Neupert effect.

The degradation by high laser intensities has been observed in polycrystalline MAPbI 3 films [28, 29], which is mainly due to the low thermal conductivity of MAPbI 3 [30]. Moreover, short acquisition time (10  s) was used to reduce the sample exposure to the laser light to avoid thermal decomposition and to minimize light soaking (defects curing effect) by trap filling from photogenerated free-charge carriers and O 2, which could reduce the nonradiative recombination channels and increases the PL intensity [10].

The intensity enhancement of PL peaks was attributed to the passivation of nonradiative charge recombination sites (deep trap states) by H 2 O molecules. This study suggests that by controlling the humidity-induced defects and crystal lattice deformation, the optical and structural properties can be preserved, which would improve the material stability and thus the performance efficiency of MAPbI 3 MW-based optoelectronic devices. At the same time, our results suggest that the photoemission can be tuned by controlling the defect density and the structural deformation of the MWs crystals.|$|R

Such laser diodes have typical output power levels of 1 - 3 mW [2]. In harsh environments characterized e. g. by high dust loads however, the level of particle contamination leads to substantial loss in signal due to Rayleigh-scattering of the light. In this case, TDLS application requirements include a high laser output power. Therefore it can be advisable to trade more intense absorption features for higher laser output power and use corresponding laser diodes at shorter emission wavelengths. We fabricated longitudinally single mode distributed feedback (DFB) laser diodes with continuous wave (cw) output power levels of more than 150 <b>mW</b> at an <b>emission</b> wavelength of 982 nm...|$|R
40|$|In this {{comparative}} clinical study, we {{aimed at}} evaluating {{the immediate and}} late analgesic effect of GaAlAs diode lasers of 660 nm and 830 nm in treatment of dentine pain. We used GaAlAs diode lasers of 660 nm and 830 nm with 35 <b>mW,</b> continuous wave <b>emission,</b> spot size 1 mm(2) and a dosage of 4 joules/cm(2) applied to the cervical dentine surface. in total 4 treatment sessions were performed at intervals of 7 days {{in a period of}} 4 consecutive weeks. A total of 40 teeth treated were divided into two groups comprising 20 teeth each: one group irradiated with a 660 run wavelength laser, and the other one with a 830 nm wavelength laser. By means of a quantitative visual analogue scale (V. A. S.), we measured the sensitive responses to cold stimulus pretreatment, and at a follow-up period of 15 and 30 minutes post-treatment in both groups in order to evaluate the immediate analgesic effect. the late effect was evaluated at a follow-up period of 15 and 30 days. Using the GaAlAs diode laser of 660 nm wavelength resulted in better levels of dentine desensitization, at both inmediate and late analgesic effect analysis compared {{with the use of the}} GaAlAs diode laser of 830 run wavelength.

40|$|Taking {{advantage}} of the tunable dispersion and high nonlinearity of photonic crystal fibers (PCFs), the supercontinuum generated in PCFs {{can be used as}} a tunable source that is synchronized with the ultrafast pump source. This special property makes PCFs ideally suited for nonlinear optical imaging, such as two-photon excitation fluorescence (TPEF) and coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering (CARS) microscopy or spectroscopy. Accordingly, we instrumented a TPEF microscopy system based on the PCF and an ultrafast pump laser. When the PCF was excited at 810 nm with the average power of 70 <b>mW,</b> the supercontinuum <b>emission</b> is peaked around 700 nm. Using the spectral component from the PCF as the excitation source, the two-photon emission spectra of NADH were excited and the TPEF images of SiHa cells were successfully generated. Combining the fundamental laser pulses as the excitation source for the fluorophore FAD, we demonstrated the feasibility to use a PCF and pumping source for two-color TPEF microscopy. A CARS spectroscopy system was also developed based on PCF. The setup utilized a PCF to generate a frequency-shifted beam in the range 720 - 745 nm that was used as the pump source in the CARS process. Combined with the fundamental 800 nm beam from the pump laser, the CARS signals from liquid toluene were excited. By tuning the time delay between the pump and Stokes pulses, anti-Stokes spectra of toluene corresponding to different Raman resonances were observed. The results show that a PCFs-based excitation configuration significantly simplified the CARS spectroscopy system. Further study will be focused to evaluate the potential of a PCF as a light source in CARS microscopy of cells and tissues...|$|R
40|$|The Chandra X-ray Observatory) {{observed}} the Jovian system on 25 - 26 Nov 1999 with the Advanced CCD Imaging Spectrometer (ACIS), {{in support of}} the Galileo flyby of Io, and on 18 Dec 2000 with the imaging array of the High Resolution Camera (HRC-I), {{in support of the}} Cassini flyby of Jupiter. These sensitive, very high spatial-resolution X-ray observations have revealed that Jupiter's northern x-ray aurora originates at a spot fixed in a coordinate system rotating with the planet at latitude (60 [...] 70 deg north) and longitude (160 [...] 180 deg System III). Contrary to previous expectations, this location is poleward of the main FUV auroral oval and the foot of the Io Flux Tube, and is apparently connected magnetically to a region of the outer magnetosphere beyond ∼ 30 Jupiter radii. The northern auroral x-ray emission varies with a period ∼ 45 minute and has a an average power of ∼ 1 GW. The earlier view that Jupiter's x-ray aurora resulted from the precipitation of heavy ions from {{the outer edge of the}} lo Plasma Torus is now in doubt. Jupiter's disk also emits x-rays with a power of ∼ 2 GW, perhaps resulting from reprocessing of solar x-rays in its atmosphere. These observations reveal for the first time x-ray emission from the Io Plasma Torus, with a power of ∼ 0. 1 Gw. The origin of this emission is not currently understood, although bremmstrahlung from non-thermal electrons may play a significant role. Finally, we report the discovery of very faint (∼ 1 [...] 2 <b>MW)</b> soft x-ray <b>emission</b> from the Galilean satellites Io, Europa, and probably Ganymede, most likely as a result of bombardment of their surfaces by energetic (greater than 10 keV) H, O, and S ions from the region of the Io Plasma Torus...|$|R
40|$|The {{positron}} annihilation gamma-ray signal in the Milky Way (MW) shows a puzzling morphology: a {{very bright}} bulge and a very low surface-brightness disk. A coherent explanation of the positron origin, propagation through the Galaxy and subsequent annihilation in the interstellar medium {{has not yet been}} found. Tentative explanations involve positrons from radioactivity, X-ray binaries, and dark matter (DM). Dwarf satellite galaxies (DSGs) are believed to be DM-dominated and hence promising candidates in the search for 511 keV emission as a result of DM annihilation into electron-positron pairs. The goal {{of this study is to}} constrain possible 511 keV gamma-ray signals from 39 DSGs of the MW and to test the annihilating DM scenario. We use the spectrometer SPI on INTEGRAL to extract individual spectra for the studied objects. As the diffuse galactic emission dominates the signal, the large scale morphology of the MW has been modelled accordingly and was included in a maximum likelihood analysis. Alternatively, a distance-weighted stacked spectrum has been determined. Only Reticulum II (Ret II) shows a 3. 1 sigma signal. Five other sources show tentative 2 sigma signals. The mass-to- 511 -keV-luminosity-ratio shows a marginal trend towards higher values for intrinsically brighter objects, opposite to the V band mass-to-light-ratio, which is generally used to uncover DM in DSGs. All derived flux values are above the level implied by a DM interpretation of the MW bulge signal. The signal from Ret II is unlikely to be related to a DM origin alone, otherwise, the MW bulge would be about 100 times brighter than what is seen. Ret II is exceptional considering the DSG sample, and rather points to enhanced recent star formation activity, if its origins are similar to processes in the <b>MW.</b> Understanding this <b>emission</b> may provide further clues regarding the origin of the annihilation <b>emission</b> in the <b>MW.</b> Comment: 7 pages, 3 figures, 1 table, accepted by A&...|$|R
40|$|In {{this work}} the {{technology}} of Gd 3 + and Lu 3 + co-doped KY(WO 4) 2 :Yb 3 + thin films grown onto pure KY(WO 4) 2 substrates by liquid phase epitaxy (LPE) is explored. The co-doping enables lattice matching of the grown layer with the substrate and enhances the refractive index difference between the grown layer and the undoped KY(WO 4) 2 substrate. This technology enabled the demonstration of waveguide lasers with tight pump and laser mode confinement, resulting in excellent slope efficiencies in Yb 3 +-doped planar and microstructured channel waveguide lasers of 82. 3 % and 72 %, respectively. Fabrication of double tungstate microstructured channel waveguides with further enhanced refractive index contrast of 1. 5 × 10 - 2 by completely interchanging the Y 3 + component of the KY(WO 4) 2 host material with Gd 3 +, Lu 3 +, and Yb 3 + doping allows for the demonstration of a laser with an output power of 418 mW at 1023 nm and slope efficiency of 71 % versus launched pump power. In addition, in two other resonator configurations these channels showed broad tunability of the laser wavelength from 980 to 1045 nm {{as well as a}} low quantum defect of 0. 7 % when pumping at 973 nm and lasing at 980 nm, thereby minimizing heat dissipation in the device. Laser operation at 980 nm is achieved in an open cavity configuration, which allows for optimal extraction of the laser power, resulting in a total extracted <b>emission</b> of 650 <b>mW.</b> Moreover, Laser <b>emission</b> has been demonstrated by an on-chip resonator structure fabricated using a deep Bragg-reflector milled by a focused ion beam (FIB) through the complete waveguide structure, similar to the approach demonstrated in a semiconductor gain material. Micro-chip optically active devices, currently developed in the well-established semiconductor gain material platform, can be possibly being fabricated in the discussed rare earth ion doped material platform. This is highlighted by the last outcome of this project; demonstrating similar modal gain compared to state of the art semiconductor waveguide amplifiers of nearly 1000 dB/cm. To obtain this remarkable result the developed technology is used for the fabrication of nearly 50 % Yb 3 +-doped channel waveguide structures. This result is beyond the common expectation, as rare earth ions are regarded as impurities providing low gain...|$|R
