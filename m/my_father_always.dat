500|$|In January 2008, Usher's father, Usher Raymond III, died. Both men regretted not {{spending}} more time in each other's lives. [...] "Prayer for You", the seventh track on Here I Stand, is an interlude dedicated to Usher's son, reflective on {{his relationship with his}} own father; [...] "No matter what happened, <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>always</b> prayed for me. The only difference is, I'm gonna be there to be the father that my dad wished he was to me." [...] The first album name that artists and repertoire representative Mark Pitts conceived was [...] "Measure of a Man", but that title had already been used by Clay Aiken for his debut album, so Usher called it Here I Stand. Pitts said, [...] "It was perfect because becoming a man is about going though pain, sorrow, and happiness. Usher's done that! From the love songs to the party joints, it's exactly the story he wanted to tell." [...] Usher noted Here I Stand as beginning [...] "a new chapter in my life"; the album's liner notes contain a verse from 1 Corinthians 13: [...] "When I was a child, I spoke as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a child: but when I became a man, I put away childish things." [...] Here I Stand marked Usher's growth from boyhood to manhood. In March 2007, it was announced that work on the album had begun. Usher outlined the album's concept: [...] "A lot of what I plan to offer with this album is kinda standing in this spot ... The king's back. I ain't gonna say 'back,' I never left." ...|$|E
2500|$|Some groups, {{such as a}} {{rock band}} from Benghazi called the [...] "Guys Underground", used metaphors to cloak the censure of the authorities. The group {{released}} a song just before the uprising entitled [...] "Like <b>My</b> <b>Father</b> <b>Always</b> Says" [...] to ridicule an autocratic fictional male head of a family which was a veiled reference to Colonel Gaddafi.|$|E
6000|$|... "And with you, dear Colonel Washington, by whom <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>always</b> set such store. You don't {{know how}} much he trusted in you. You {{will take care of}} my boy, sir, will not you? You are but five years older, yet I trust to you more than to his seniors; <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>always</b> told the children, I alway bade them, to look up to Mr. Washington." ...|$|E
5000|$|... "Like <b>my</b> dear <b>father</b> <b>always</b> said: ..... and I {{abide by}} that." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well"--with some slow consideration--"he {{admired the}} Queen as was, {{and could not}} abide the Prince of Orange. <b>My</b> <b>father</b> was <b>always</b> at him for it." ...|$|R
6000|$|<b>My</b> <b>father</b> was <b>always</b> scrupulous about private letters, and said, 'I {{beg your}} pardon, Clarence; I {{should not have}} forced it from you. I wish I had not seen it.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, {{because he}} would do {{something}} worth while; he would write a book. <b>My</b> <b>father</b> <b>always</b> says that he's the most remarkable {{of the young men}} who write for him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That is it. If it {{be on the}} finger, {{take the}} finger off. So said <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>always.</b> But think of where this wound is, {{and that it is}} my wife. It is dreadful!" ...|$|E
60|$|Seti {{burst out}} {{laughing}} and I looked at the old priest angrily, though now that I came {{to think of it}} <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>always</b> said that his mother {{was one of the biggest}} liars in Egypt.|$|E
5000|$|.....as {{a nation}} {{this is our}} {{opportunity}} to thank you and <b>my</b> <b>father</b> for <b>always</b> being there for us. For inspiring us with your selfless duty and service and for making us proud to be British. Prince Charles' tribute to the Queen.|$|R
5000|$|I {{watched my}} honoured guest with close attention. He loved {{the roar of}} the multitude, and with <b>my</b> <b>father</b> could <b>always</b> say [...] "I have never feared the English democracy." [...] The blood mantled in his cheek, and his eye as it caught mine twinkled with pure enjoyment.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{did as he}} told me; but <b>my</b> <b>father</b> was <b>always</b> unlucky in speculation, {{and they}} went down steadily. I sold out at {{considerable}} loss, and concluded that in the world beyond they are as ignorant of the tendency of the Stock Exchange as {{we are in this}} vale of sorrow.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But I do, {{and what}} is more, I intend, sooner or later, {{to try to have}} matters mended. <b>My</b> <b>father</b> <b>always</b> told me he wished me to keep on going to school and then to enter Princeton." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>My</b> <b>father</b> <b>always</b> went {{to church}} twice, so he and Clarence walked to Wattlesea, where {{appearances}} were more respectable; but they heard the same sermon over again, and, as my father drily remarked, {{it was not a}} composition that would bear repetition.|$|E
6000|$|... 'What a question! How could I refuse {{for such}} an {{excellent}} purpose? They say that my taking a part will be worth a hundred pounds to the charity. <b>My</b> <b>father</b> <b>always</b> supported the hospital, which is quite undenominational; and he said I was to do the same.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You will {{remember}} all those dates well. Now read what is {{written on the}} loose leaf. When I came in one night the book lay {{on the table with}} that leaf projecting; but as <b>my</b> <b>father</b> was <b>always</b> fretting over the accounts, I did not glance at it as I replaced the book." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{will not}} {{tell you about the}} partings, and the {{promises}} and assurances that we should meet again. <b>My</b> <b>father</b> had <b>always</b> promised that my mother should see France once more, and he now declared that they would all visit me. Alas! we little thought what would be the accomplishment of that promise.|$|R
6000|$|Mrs. Lambert interrupted: [...] "But, Dr. Serviss, <b>my</b> <b>father's</b> advice has <b>always</b> been good; to {{question}} it {{now would be}} {{to question}} my faith. His wish is my law." ...|$|R
6000|$|Jemima is my name, [...] But oh, I have another; [...] <b>My</b> <b>father</b> <b>always</b> {{calls me}} Meg, [...] And so do Bob and mother; [...] Only my sister, jealous of [...] The strands of my bright hair, [...] 'Jemima - Mima - Mima!' [...] Calls, mocking, up the stair.|$|E
6000|$|... "You must sit there," [...] she insisted. [...] "I prefer {{always to}} remain here, and <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>always</b> likes {{to face the}} audience. I really believe," [...] she went on, [...] "that he likes to catch {{the eye of the}} {{journalist}} who writes little gossipy items, and to see his name in print." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not at night, when I sleep very soundly, except {{after that}} poor cabman was killed. I have seen lots of dead people, because <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>always</b> {{takes me to}} look at them in the parish, to remind me of my own latter end, as he says, but they never made me dream before." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Wery, Sir,' replied Mr. Weller; 'if ever I wanted anythin' o' <b>my</b> <b>father,</b> I <b>always</b> {{asked for}} it in a wery 'spectful and obligin' manner. If he didn't give it me, I took it, for fear I should be led to do anythin' wrong, through not havin' it. I saved him a world o' trouble this vay, Sir.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'What {{would you}} have better than the hill and the brae? To tame a horse and fly a hawk, and couch a lance and bend a bow! That's what a man is made for, without fashing himself with letters and Latin and manners, no better than a monk; but <b>my</b> <b>father</b> would <b>always</b> have it so!' ...|$|R
40|$|Narrative by Junebug Clark: Image is from 1938 and is shot in Cumberland Gap, Tennessee. This {{home was}} built by Wade Clark.

6000|$|... "I {{will not}} go back to my mother, Jethro!" [...] she exclaimed impetuously. [...] "She wanted me to marry Plexo. She would give me to some one else, and <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>always</b> said I should only marry some one I liked. You can never be so cruel as to give me up to her?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "She was {{the woman}} who got Antony Babington into trouble," [...] {{explained}} Cicely. [...] "I deemed her a witch, for she would hint strange things concerning me, but <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>always</b> believed she was a kinsman of his, who was concerned in the Rising of the North, and who, he said, had seen me brought in to Hull from the wreck." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He is," [...] the Seer replied instantly, with a {{flash of}} those dark eyes. And I thought this curious; for though <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>always</b> {{maintained}} {{the reality of the}} relationship, there was one link wanting to complete the pedigree. He could not make sure that the Hon. Thomas Wilbraham Wentworth was the father of Jonathan Wentworth, the Bristol horse-dealer, from whom we are descended.|$|E

6000|$|... 'Oh no, {{it was not}} that,' said Kalliope. 'Indeed, I {{hope there}} is no such {{nonsense}} in me. [...] It was what <b>my</b> dear <b>father</b> <b>always</b> warned us against; only poor mamma always gets vexed if she does not think we are keeping ourselves up, and she had just been annoyed at--- something, and we did not know then that it was Lady Merrifield's sister.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ethel!" [...] {{said her}} sister, [...] "what do you mean? She {{is really not}} as heartless as she appears," [...] Miss Walton continued, turning to Mrs. Sanderson. [...] "I trust you will make due {{allowance}} for a young lady who persists in coming to town in a tennis costume; but as <b>my</b> <b>father</b> has <b>always</b> allowed her {{to act like a}} barbarian, mamma and I can do nothing." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I know I could,--if the {{occasion}} demanded. I am {{not one to}} let what I might deem life-happiness slip from me without a struggle. That" [...] (judicially) [...] "occurs only in books and among sentimentalists. As <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>always</b> says, I belong to the strugglers and fighters. That which appeared to me great and sacred, that would I battle for, though I brought heaven tumbling about my ears." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, {{that was}} what I feared for Tom," [...] said Richard, [...] "and there was the mistake. I see it now. <b>My</b> <b>father</b> <b>always</b> is right in the main, though he is apt to frighten one at first, and it is {{what ought to be}} that he should rule his own house. But now, Margaret, it is silly to worry about it any more--let me fetch baby, and don't think of it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Milt, mebbe we {{know what}} Beasley is better 'n you," [...] said John, at length. [...] "He ruined my father. He's cheated other Mormons. We boys have proved to {{ourselves}} thet he gets the sheep Anson's gang steals.... An' drives the herds to Phenix! Our people won't let us accuse Beasley.

6000|$|... "Your {{father and}} mother were honest people," [...] says Mary, obstinately. [...] "My mother ran away from home, and died in a hospital. <b>My</b> <b>father</b> was <b>always</b> drunk, and always beating me. My step-mother {{is as good as}} dead, for all she cares about me.

6000|$|... 'Ah,' said Kim, 'I shall remember.
