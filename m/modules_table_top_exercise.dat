40|$|ABSTRACT Nowadays Chemical-Biological-Radiological-Nuclear (CRBN) {{risks are}} one of the main safety concern. The {{radiological}} disasters of Fukushima and Chernobyl, the chemical events of Seveso or the release of Sarin in the Tokio Subway,and the biological emergencies such as the H 1 N 1 flue represent few examples of a dreadful evidence: : CBRNe risks are a real and global threat around us. A CBRNe event can be either of an intentional and un-intentional nature and {{it is important to have}} highly specialized advisors that can support decision makers and first responders to face this threat. The University of Rome Tor Vergata, in collaboration with the most important Italian and International Bodies that work in the field of CBRN safety and security and supported by NATO and OPCW, organized two International Master Courses in Protection against CBRN events. In this context, a <b>Table</b> <b>Top</b> <b>Exercise</b> (TTX) was organized, in collaboration with the Ministry of Interior and Ministry of Defence, taking into account that, in each country, the system response to CBRNe events strongly depends also on law and procedures, that enforce the advisors and first responders to rely with different skills and roles in function of the administration of origin. The organized TTX was aimed to test the level preparation of the Master students and experts working in Italy in the field of CBRN events and to test the emergency planning preparation. In particular, a radiological release was simulated in a Harbour facility in Urban Area. The students were divided in multidisciplinary groups with heterogeneous competences. Each group was supported by CBRNì experts and was stressed by the injects from a Command and Operative Centre. Responsiveness to the injects and to the stress together with the ability to organize and manage safety and security operations, but also to interpret each role in the team according to according to national laws, were evaluated for each group. The scenario, the logistic organization, on-going adjustments during the exercise and the outcomes will be presented and analyzed by the authors in this paper. PRELIMINARY INDEX 1. Abstract 2.

40|$|Traditional {{emergency}} service major incident <b>table</b> <b>top</b> training <b>exercises</b> are presented via ‘low-technology’ means, such as plastic bricks and paper maps, or ‘front-loaded’ via slides presented by an instructor. The {{purpose of this}} research was to develop a new, electronic approach to <b>table</b> <b>top</b> delivery, to address issues with the existing approaches and provide a usable, more useful, streamlined user experience that was acceptable for major incident education. While the benefits of the existing paper-based approaches include their: affordability; reliability; portability; accessibility and acceptability, they do not permit the recording of exercise progress. Presentations by instructors can result in a lack of candidate participation and physical maps can become cluttered and cause a loss of data when disturbed. Additionally, supporting information required by participants during the scenario is presented as an adjunct to the exercise, necessitating supplementary display equipment. To address these issues, low-cost, bespoke, interactive software solutions for major incident training were created. The usability and acceptability of these products were tested within two populations routinely using <b>table</b> <b>top</b> <b>exercises,</b> via an experimentally-led ‘research in the wild’ approach. These were healthcare professionals, attending the international Major Incident Medical Management and Support (MIMMS) courses, and Greater Manchester Police (GMP) Officers. An experimental approach was adopted to attain realistic responses from the target audience regarding <b>table</b> <b>top</b> use. Given the nature of this form of incident response training, we were constrained to conducting experiments in a non-intrusive way, to neither interfere with, nor distract from, the participants’ learning experiences. Three experiments were designed to establish the viability of this development. Two one centre, one sample studies were conducted, followed by a multicentre controlled trial. The one sample studies consisted of a pilot that explored proof of concept, focussing on <b>table</b> <b>top</b> usability by non-computing expert users, and a second study which determined the validity of the pilot’s findings within a larger sample size. The multicentre controlled trial compared paper-based <b>table</b> <b>top</b> with electronic <b>table</b> <b>top</b> cohorts in terms of the participant learning experience and, thereby, fitness for purpose. 6 candidates piloted the prototype MIMMS electronic exercise in February 2011. 114 Police Officers utilised the GMP <b>table</b> <b>top</b> during November and December 2011. The multicentre controlled MIMMS trial enrolled 23 candidates (n= 11 electronic and n= 12 paper-based <b>table</b> <b>top</b> cohorts) from courses held at 3 U. K. centres. Both the healthcare and policing trial participants evaluating the <b>table</b> <b>top</b> respectively rated significant levels of agreement with the software being fit for purpose and usable. Candidate results from the multicentre MIMMS trial indicated positive findings regarding the equivalency of the electronic with the existing, paper-based media. The MIMMS pilot trial was an acceptable proof of concept, justifying the further development of this work. The GMP study affirmed these findings for a larger sample size. The MIMMS multicentre controlled trial demonstrated the comparability of the electronic <b>table</b> <b>top</b> with its paper-based counterpart, in terms of the learning experience provided and affirmed this approach as fit for purpose.

40|$|In {{response}} to large emergencies, emergency managers deal with unknown situations characterized by complexity and uncertainty, so-called wicked problems. Existing tabletop exercises {{are used to}} train, test and exercise emergency managers but do <b>table</b> <b>top</b> <b>exercises</b> mirror the wickedness? A pilot study where emergency managers were interviewed {{about the use of}} tabletop exercises has been carried out. The pilot study and traditional tabletop exercises are analyzed through the lens of wicked problems. The result shows that tabletop exercises partly mirrors wicked problems but cannot handle every aspect of wicked problems. The main reasons for this are, that the planning of tabletop exercises in which the problems and solutions are known beforehand tames the problems and that focusing on the use of plans entails leaving unplanned problems unaddressed. I propose three design ideas to be used when designing tabletop exercises to better prepare emergency managers for wicked problems. First, focus on unsolved (wicked) problems instead of on problems already handled in plans and allow participants to identify them. Second, let participants tame the problems during the exercise instead of taming the problems ahead of time planning the exercises. Third, use existing plans and lessons learned from previous emergencies, and resolve the problems in collaboration. Godkänd; 2014; 20140117 (svantee); Konferensartikel i tidskrif...|$|R
40|$|The {{local public}} health {{department}} {{is the main}} entity in cities and counties established to ensure the safety, health, and well-being of its community members. In many cases, particularly in rural areas, the health department may be the community’s closest access to health care, providing not only clinical care, but preventive services as well. These rural health departments have additional challenges {{that may not be}} experienced in the larger, more populated metropolitan areas. These challenges include lack of resources and funding that impact daily operations, expanded registered sanitarian responsibilities, and emergency preparedness difficulties with resource allocation and communication. Despite these challenges, it is of great benefit to study the overall operations of small health departments, including case studies of their emergency preparedness response plans, noting their unique strengths and how they overcome these hurdles to remain effective entities devoted to public protection and safety. This manuscript will describe an overview of the key sections in a rural local health department.

40|$|Book synopsis: Focusing on {{countermeasures}} against orchestrated cyber-attacks, Cyber Security Culture is research-based {{and reinforced}} with insights from experts {{who do not}} normally release information into the public arena. It will enable managers of organizations across different industrial sectors and government agencies to better understand how organizational learning and training can be utilized to develop a culture that ultimately protects an organization from attacks. Peter Trim and David Upton believe that the speed and complexity of cyber-attacks demand {{a different approach to}} security management, including scenario-based planning and training, to supplement security policies and technical protection systems. The authors provide in-depth understanding of how organizational learning can produce cultural change addressing the behaviour of individuals, as well as machines. They provide information to help managers form policy to prevent cyber intrusions, to put robust security systems and procedures in place and to arrange appropriate training interventions such as <b>table</b> <b>top</b> <b>exercises.</b> Guidance embracing current and future threats and addressing issues such as social engineering is included. Although the work is embedded in a theoretical framework, non-technical staff will find the book of practical use because it renders highly technical subjects accessible and links firmly with areas beyond ICT, such as human resource management - in relation to bridging the education/training divide and allowing organizational learning to be embraced. This book will interest Government officials, policy advisors, law enforcement officers and senior managers within companies, as well as academics and students in a range of disciplines including management and computer science...|$|R
40|$|Emergency {{situations}} and mass casualties involve several agencies and public authorities, which need {{to gather data}} from the incident scene and exchange geo-referenced information to provide fast and accurate first aid {{to the people in}} need. Tracking patients {{on their way to the}} hospitals can prove critical in taking lifesaving decisions. Increased and continuous flow of information combined by vital signs and geographic location of emergency victims can greatly reduce the response time of the medical emergency chain and improve the efficiency of disaster medicine activity. Recent advances in mobile positioning systems and telecommunications are providing the technology needed for the development of location-aware medical applications. IMPRESS is an advanced ICT platform based on adequate technologies for developing location-aware medical response during emergencies. The system incorporates mobile and fixed components that collect field data from diverse sources, support medical location and situation-based services and share information on the patient’s transport from the field to the hospitals. In IMPRESS platform tracking of victims, ambulances and emergency services vehicles is integrated with medical, traffic and crisis management information into a common operational picture. The Incident Management component of the system manages operational resources together with patient tracking data that contain vital sign values and patient’s status evolution. Thus, it can prioritize emergency transport decisions, based on medical and location-aware information. The solution combines positioning and information gathered and owned by various public services involved in MCIs or large-scale disasters.

40|$|The IBRD Operational Decision Framework in this {{document}} is an expansion of an emerging general risk management framework under development by an interagency working group. It provides the level of detail necessary to develop a general Consequence Management Guidance Document for biological contamination remediation and restoration. It is the intent of {{this document}} to support both wide area and individual site remediation and restoration activities. This product was initiated as a portion of the IBRD Task 1 Systems Analysis to aid in identification of wide area remediation and restoration shortcomings and gaps. The draft interagency general risk management framework was used {{as the basis for the}} analysis. The initial Task 1 analysis document expanded the draft interagency framework to a higher level of resolution, building on both the logic structure and the accompanying text explanations. It was then employed in a qualitative manner to identify responsible agencies, data requirements, tool requirements, and current capabilities for each decision and task. This resulted in identifying shortcomings and gaps needing resolution. Several meetings of a joint LLNL/SNL working group reviewed and approved the initial content of this analysis. At the conclusion of Task 1, work continued on the expanded framework to generate this Operational Decision Framework which is consistent with the existing interagency general risk management framework. A large LLNL task group met repeatedly over a three-month period to develop the expanded framework, coordinate the framework with the biological remediation checklist, and synchronize the logic with the Consequence Management Plan table of contents. The expanded framework was briefed at a large <b>table</b> <b>top</b> <b>exercise</b> reviewing the interagency risk management framework. This exercise had representation from major US metropolitan areas as well as national agencies. This product received positive comments from the participants. Upon completion of the Operational Decision Framework, another joint LLNL/SNL working group conducted a day-long review. Identified modifications were made to the document, resulting in the included product...|$|R
40|$|Effective {{fireground}} decision - making requires good {{situation awareness}} (SA) and appropriate selection {{from the information}} available to the incident commander. Individuals can display different information bias / scope in {{their view of the}} operational incident: either a liberal bias / scope towards accepting information as true with a risk of false alarm errors and / or a conservative bias / scope towards rejecting information with a risk of misses. Such decision - making bias / scope was examined over a series of five separate studies including operational fire fighters and incident commanders. The studies included a breathing apparatus (BA) <b>exercise,</b> two different <b>table</b> <b>top</b> operational incidents (domestic and commercial) and two exercises for flexible duty managers (FDM) in an assessable simulated fireground incident in 2012 and again in 2013. The studies were based on realistic incidents that both fire fighters and FDMs would be expected to respond to, in the final two studies each individual had to take over command and move towards a successful conclusion from an operational, environmental and social perspective. In all the studies, participants were required to answer true or false to a series of probe statements about the incident, which were analysed by a signal detection tool (QASA) to give a measure of actual situational awareness (ASA), perceived situational awareness (PSA) and bias / scope. The first exercise was a BA exercise undertaken to identify if bias was shown by FF’s when undertaking training, the data analysed by the QASA identified that most individuals displayed a high level of ASA about the incident, but also showed either a conservative bias / scope (with miss errors) or a liberal bias /scope (with false alarm errors). The results however also show that two individuals can appear to have similar ASA, but in fact still have very different bias / scope in regard to that knowledge. Once it was established that bias was identified this was developed using <b>table</b> <b>top</b> <b>exercises</b> as it allowed more participants and more control over undertaking the research within normal programmed training periods. The analysis of the two <b>table</b> <b>top</b> <b>exercises</b> showed ASA was high in both, but fire fighters perceived their PSA in a similar way if they had high confidence in one exercise they also had high confidence in the other exercise, or vice versa. However there was no significant correlation between the ASA scores and the PSA scores, with the pattern of bias / scope tendencies being differed across the two studies; with no significant correlation. In reviewing these results the identified difference in undertaking the 2 exercises was that in the second FF’s were familiar with the process and this allow a more relaxed approach, reducing pressure on the individual. While individuals showed bias patterns within the exercises undertaken, more pressurized exercises were identified to see if this bias was consistent for the individual when under pressure. Using the assessable incident commander exercises run by the FRS to test incident commander competence at a FDM level to undertake this. The exercises were used in 2012 and 2013 using the same individuals to compare their results, the outcome of these two simulated assessable fireground incident studies were; •	for ASA: there was no significant correlation: r = -. 120 and p=. 623; •	for PSA: there was a significant positive correlation: r =. 577 and p =. 012; •	for bias / scope there was found a strongly positive significant correlation across the scores: r =. 592 which is significant at the. 008 level. The conclusion of the research is that individuals hold bias / scope tendencies and under pressure these tendencies are shown to be resting and will impact (condition) the individual’s decisions during periods of operational command during stressful conditions. The finding of bias / scope patterns is an important one that may have implications for understanding errors in incident ground decision - making. The finding of resting bias / scope patterns in FDM is an even more important one, which will have implications for understanding errors in incident ground decision - making and how we can help to reduce them. In semi structure interviews with FDMs who had undertaken the assessable exercises, they believed that knowing their bias was a first step to altering it to allow them to improve their decision making at pressurized incidents. Which supported the ultimate goal of the current research to further the understanding of bias / scope tendency, in order to support the training of effective fireground decision - making...|$|R
40|$|We present two novel {{rehabilitation}} robots for stroke patients. For {{lower limb}} stroke rehabilitation, {{we present a}} novel self-aligning exoskeleton for the knee joint. The primal novelty of the design originates from its kinematic structure that allows translational movements of the knee joint on the sagittal plane along with the knee rotation. Automatically adjusting its joint axes, the exoskeleton enables a perfect match between human joint axes and the device axes. Thanks to this feature, the knee exoskeleton is not only capable of guaranteeing ergonomy and comfort throughout the therapy, but also extends the usable range of motion for the knee joint. Moreover, this adjustability feature significantly shortens the setup time required to attach the patient to the robot, allowing more effective time be spend on exercises instead of wasting it for adjustments. We have implemented an impedance-type concept of the knee exoskeleton, experimentally characterized its closed-loop performance and demonstrated ergonomy and useability of this device through human subject experiments. To administer <b>table</b> <b>top</b> <b>exercises</b> during upper limb stroke rehabilitation, we present a novel Mecanum-wheeled holonomic mobile rehabilitation robot for home therapy. The device can move/rotate independently on its unlimited planar workspace to provide assistance to patients. We have implemented two different concepts of holonomic mobile platform based on different actuation and sensing principles: an admittance-type mobile robot and a mobile platform with series elastic actuation. The admittance-type robot is integrated with virtual reality simulations and can assist patients through virtual tunnels designed around nominal task trajectories. The holonomic platform with series elastic actuation {{eliminates the need for}} costly force sensors and enables implementation of closed loop force control with higher controller gains, providing robustness against imperfections in the power transmission and allowing lower cost drive components to be utilized. For contour following tasks with the holonomic platforms, we have synthesized passive velocity field controllers (PVFC) that ensure coordination and synchronization between various degrees of freedom of the patient arm, while letting patients to complete the task at their own preferred pace. PVFC not only minimizes the contour error but also ensures coupled stability of the human-in-the-loop system...|$|R
40|$|If a {{large scale}} RDD event where to occur in New York City, the {{magnitude}} of the problem would likely exceed the capabilities of City and State to effectively respond to the event. New York State could request Federal Assistance if the United States President has not already made the decision to provide it. The United States Federal Government has a well developed protocol to respond to emergencies. The National Response Framework (NRF) describes the process for responding to all types of emergencies including RDD incidents. Depending on the location and type of event, the NRF involves appropriate Federal Agencies, e. g., Department of Homeland Security (DHS), the Department of Energy (DOE), Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), United States Coast Guard (USCG), Department of Defense (DOD), Department of Justice (DOJ), Department of Agriculture (USDA), and Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC). The Federal response to emergencies has been refined and improved over the last thirty years and has been tested on natural disasters (e. g. hurricanes and floods), man-made disasters (oil spills), and terrorist events (9 / 11). However, the system has never been tested under an actual RDD event. Drills have been conducted with Federal, State, and local agencies to examine the initial (early) phases of such an event (TopOff 2 and TopOff 4). The Planning Guidance for Protection and Recovery Following Radiological Dispersal Device (RDD) and Improvised Nuclear Device (IND) incidents issued by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) in August 2008 has never been fully tested in an interagency exercise. Recently, another exercise called Empire 09 that was situated in Albany, New York was conducted. Empire 09 consists of 3 different exercises be held in May and June, 2009. The first exercise, May 2009, involved a <b>table</b> <b>top</b> <b>exercise</b> for phase 1 (0 - 48 hours) of the response to an RDD incident. In early June, a full-scale 3 - day exercise was conducted for the mid-phase response (48 hours +). A few weeks later, a one day full-scale exercise was conducted for the late phase (recovery) response to an RDD event. The lessons learned from this study are not available as of June 30, 2009. The objective of this report is to review and summarize anticipated Federal and State response actions and the roles and responsibilities of various agencies (DHS, EPA, DOE, NY-DEP, NY-DEC) with respect to decontamination issues that would arise from a radiological dispersion device (RDD), e. g., dirty bomb attack. These issues arise in the late phase of the response (48 hours and beyond) after the area has been stabilized and forensic information has been obtained. Much of the information provided in this report is taken directly from published guidance that is readily available...|$|R

Future disaster preparedness effortswould benefit from incased reporting of hospitals experiences in disaster response training...|$|R
40|$|Master of Public HealthPublic Health Interdepartmental ProgramMichael W. SandersonThe author {{carried out}} his field {{experience}} in the Kansas Department of Agriculture, Division of Animal Health in Manhattan, Kansas from August 2014 to May 2015. The Kansas Department of Agriculture is the oldest agriculture department in the United States. It has as its responsibility, the overall support of agriculture in Kansas. The Kansas Department of Agriculture (KDA) is divided {{into a number of}} divisions and programs to carry out its mission. The Division of Animal Health was created in 1969 from a consolidation of the Livestock Sanitary Commission and the State Brand Commission. The Division of Animal Health joined the Kansas Department of Agriculture in 2011. It is comprised of three programs: animal disease control, livestock brands and animal facilities inspection. The Kansas Board of Veterinary Examiners also operates under the Division of Animal Health. The Division of Animal Health’s objectives include the securing of public health and safety of the citizens of Kansas through the prevention, control and eradication of infectious diseases and conditions affecting the health of livestock and domestic animals in the state. The author was involved in several different projects and activities. These included: 1) 	Biosecurity recommendations for the Kansas State Fair 2) 	Ebola virus disease <b>table</b> <b>top</b> <b>exercises</b> for state agencies in Kansas, 3) 	Foreign animal disease (FAD) outbreak: Foot and Mouth Disease table-top exercises 4) 	Low pathogenic avian influenza outbreak table-top exercise 5) 	One Health Collaboration Gap Analysis. The author completed a lengthy project (culminating experience) in the development of biosecurity recommendations for the Kansas State Fair. These recommendations dealt with several facets of biosecurity including animal-to-human disease prevention (zoonotic diseases) as well as animal-to-animal disease prevention. The challenge of having large numbers of people at the fair in crowded spaces, combined with thousands of head of livestock and poultry {{while at the same time}} encouraging people to consume food and drink, sets up the potential for large outbreaks of zoonotic and/or food borne diseases. In preparing these recommendations, several factors weigh heavily into making practical, science based recommendations to protect the public. These factors include, the positive name of Kansas agriculture (which is show-cased at the fair), aging fair facilities and limited financial budgets. Human behavior also plays a large roll in reducing or increasing the risks of zoonotic disease at the fair or petting zoo. Education of fair visitors is vital to raising awareness that apparently healthy animals can be a source of disease. Facilities for hand washing or hand sanitizing along with promoting the use of these hand hygiene techniques is necessary to reduce the occurrence of zoonotic disease at the fair. The biosecurity documents were constructed as three different levels of biosecurity: gold (highest), silver (medium) and bronze (lowest level). The intention was that the Kansas State Fair management not be overwhelmed at the prospect of trying to achieve too many changes in a single year of operation. The gold level may not be financially possible the first or second year of improvement and the management could opt for attempting a lower level as opposed to making no biosecurity improvements. These three separate documents appear in their entirety in the Appendix section of this report...|$|R
