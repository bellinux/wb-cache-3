500|$|Timbaland {{started a}} new label, Mosley Music Group along with old friend and legendary Australian music {{producer}} John Servedio, also known as his stage name 'ServidSounds' who helped Timbaland bring in some talent from his former Beat Club Records label.

[...] The following day, he was committed to the UCLA Medical Center with hallucinations and paranoia. Contrary to what early reports said, however, West was not actually {{taken to the hospital}} involuntarily; he was persuaded to do so by authorities. While the episode was first described as one of [...] "temporary psychosis" [...] caused by dehydration and sleep deprivation, West's mental state was abnormal enough for his 21 cancelled concerts to be covered by his insurance policy; he was reportedly paranoid and depressed throughout the hospitalization, but remains formally undiagnosed. The Paris robbery of his wife may have triggered the paranoia. On November 30, West was released from the hospital.|$|E
500|$|The video {{starts with}} [...] "Let <b>Me</b> <b>Talk</b> <b>to</b> You" [...] as the {{background}} is surrounded by faulty fluorescent lighting, turning on and off in a programmed pattern. It also begins with Timberlake and Timbaland chanting [...] "hey" [...] to one another. The video proceeds with Timberlake dancing {{to the beat of}} the song. Timbaland then begins singing the first verse of the song, which then is proceeded by Timberlake. This is immediately followed with [...] "My Love" [...] playing; the first verse of the song, [...] "Ain't another woman that could take your spot my", plays. Timberlake comes floating toward the camera, down the faulty fluorescent tube. Once Timberlake stops floating, he begins singing the main verse of the song, which violins begin to float swirling gently around him, for [...] "If I wrote you a symphony / Just to say how much you mean to me". The scene then changes with Timberlake and various dancers dancing accordingly in a choreographed style. When Timberlake begins the second verse, [...] "Now if I wrote you a love note / And made you smile at every word I wrote", pens and paper begin to float. This later exceeds with Timberlake singing [...] "This ring here represents my heart" [...] with a ring swirling into the camera. T.I. is then seen in the shot. T.I. begins rapping his lines in the song. After T.I. finishes his verse, Timberlake is then seen dancing with a female back-up dancer. Though, as they continue dancing, the female then leaves the shot, leaving Timberlake to dance {{to the end of the}} song. In the closing moments, the camera swirls around him, proving, conclusively, from every angle, that everyone has gone.|$|E
