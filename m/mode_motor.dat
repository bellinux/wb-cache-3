40|$|International audience—This study aims {{to assess}} the impact of inter-turn {{short-circuit}} in stator windings of squirrel cage induction generators on variable-speed wind turbine systems. The short-circuit fault detection is based on a steady-state technique which is Motor Current Signatures Analysis (MCSA). Thus, theoretical developments of both healthy and faulty three-phase squirrel-cage induction generator of the wind turbine system models in the abc-reference frame are made to recognize the current signature variations. Simulation results are carried out to illustrate the severe consequences of inter-turn short-circuit fault on the generator signatures and moreover on the whole system. This work highlights the importance of the existence of a robust monitoring and diagnosis system for wind turbine systems.

40|$|Detection {{of subtle}} ischemic {{injuries}} in moyamoya disease may enable optimization of timing of revascularization surgery, and could potentially improve functional outcomes. Resting-state functional {{magnetic resonance imaging}} (rs-fMRI) is widely used to study functional organization of the brain, but it remains unclear whether rs-fMRI could elucidate distinct characteristics in moyamoya disease. Here, we aimed to determine changes in a conventional rs-fMRI measure and analyze any associations with clinical symptoms and cerebral hemodynamics. Thirty-one adults with moyamoya disease and 25 adult controls underwent rs-fMRI, in which we measured brain connectivity via temporal correlations of low-frequency BOLD signals. We identified the extent of between-group differences with multivoxel pattern analysis. Seed-based analysis was performed to determine associations with vascular lesions, symptoms, and regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF). There was significantly altered connectivity in the precentral gyrus, operculo-insular region, precuneus, cingulate cortex, and middle frontal gyrus in moyamoya disease. There was reduced connectivity in the left insula, left precuneus, right precentral, and right middle frontal regions, which form part of the salience, default <b>mode,</b> <b>motor,</b> and central executive networks, respectively. Patients with ischemic motor-related symptoms showed significantly decreased connectivity in precentral homotopic regions compared with those without, while there were no differences in vascular lesions or rCBF. Connectivity between the right occipital and left hippocampus was significantly associated with cognitive performance and posterior cerebral artery involvement. Our results demonstrate distinct alterations in the temporal correlations of low-frequency BOLD signals, predominantly in resting-state networks in moyamoya disease. Additionally, rs-fMRI measures were associated with ischemic motor-related symptoms and cognitive performance in the patients. Thus, rs-fMRI may offer a useful non-invasive method of acquiring additional information beyond cerebral perfusion as part of clinical investigations in patients with moyamoya disease...|$|E

In vitro experiments of protein filaments and molecular motors have revealed a range of non- equilibrium pattern formation resulting from motor motion along filament tracks, {{and there are a}} number of hydrodynamic models purporting to describe such systems. Here we present results of extensive simulations designed to elucidate the microscopic basis underpinning macroscopic flow in active gels. Our numerical scheme includes thermal fluctuations in filament positions, excluded volume interactions, and filament elasticity in the form of bending and stretching <b>modes.</b> <b>Motors</b> are represented individually as bipolar springs governed by rate-based rules for attachment, detachment and unidirectional motion of motor heads along the filament contour. We systematically vary motor density and speed, and uncover parameter regions corresponding to unusual statics and dynamics which overlap but do not coincide. The anomalous statics arise at high motor densities and take the form of end-bound localized filament bundles for rapid motors, and extended clusters exhibiting enhanced small-wavenumber density fluctuations and power-law cluster-size distributions for slow, processive motors. Anomalous dynamics arise for slow, processive motors over a range of motor densities, and are most evident as superdiffusive mass transport, which we argue is the consequence of a form of effective self-propulsion resulting from the polar coupling between motors and filaments.

The induction motor with the squirrel-cage rotor is considered. The models of electrical and mechanical parts were considered while obtaining the induction motor mathematical model. It allows considering the relationship of electromagnetic and electromechanical pro- cesses in transient and steady-state <b>modes</b> of <b>motor</b> operation. The electrical part model is implemented in the equations for the voltages of windings and flux linkages circuits of the induction motor, which are written in the system of phase coordi- nates "ABC".
