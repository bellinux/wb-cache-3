5|$|As Schwarzenegger only {{signed on}} for the film in February and the film was shot so quickly, only {{six and a half}} months were {{available}} for <b>merchandising,</b> instead of the ideal year. As such, <b>merchandising</b> was limited to a 13.5 inch replica $25 Talking Turbo-Man action figure and the West Coast exclusive Turbo-Man Time Racer vehicle, while no tie-in promotions could be secured. Despite this, several critics wrote that the film was only being made in order to sell the toy. Columbus dismissed this notion, stating that with only roughly 200,000 Turbo-Man toys being made, the <b>merchandising</b> was far less than the year's other releases, such as Space Jam and 101 Dalmatians. The film's release coincided with the Tickle Me Elmo craze, in which high demand for the doll during the 1996 Christmas season lead to store mobbing similar to that depicted for Turbo-Man.|$|E

5|$|During {{the first}} Beatles' {{trip to the}} United States, merchandisers pitched many {{products}} to Epstein, including Beatles clocks, pens, cigarette lighters, plastic wigs, bracelets, games, etc., but he rejected them all. This was because he had already allowed David Jacobs, the lawyer for NEMS, to give away 90 per cent of <b>merchandising</b> rights to one Nicky Byrne, in the UK. This was later deemed to be a disastrous mistake, as it left only 10 per cent for Epstein, NEMS and the Beatles. Byrne then took over Epstein's Stramsact <b>merchandising</b> in the UK and set up Seltaeb (Beatles spelled backwards), in the United States. While the Beatles were ensconced in the Plaza Hotel in New York, Epstein was further besieged by calls and visits from promoters, retailers, television commentators and hustlers.|$|E

A manufacturer's expertise lies in the physical production of the products, but getting a product in front of potential customers is a completely different skill set and a complex process. Within the UK & Ireland promotional <b>merchandise</b> industry a comprehensive network of promotional <b>merchandise</b> distributor companies exist. A promotional <b>merchandise</b> distributor {{is defined as a}} company who [...] "has a dedicated focus to the sale of promotional <b>merchandise</b> to end users". (An 'end user' is a corporate company or organisation that purchases promotional <b>merchandise</b> for their own use.) These distributor companies have the expertise to not only take the product to market, but are also to provide the expert support required. The unique aspect of promotional <b>merchandise</b> is that on most occasions the product is printed with the logo, or brand, of a corporate organisation. The actual manufacturers rarely have the set up to actually print the item. Promotional <b>merchandise</b> distributor companies are expert in artwork and printing processes. In addition to this the promotional <b>merchandise</b> distributors also provide full support in processing orders, artwork, proofing, progress chasing & delivery of promotional products from multiple manufacturing sources.|$|R
