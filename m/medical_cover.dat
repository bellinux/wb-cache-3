40|$|Purpose: In Korea, {{the entire}} {{population}} must enroll in the national health insurance system, {{and those who are}} classified as having a lower socioeconomic status are supported by the medical aid system. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the association of the medi-cal insurance status of gastric cancer patients with their survival after gastrectomy. Materials and Methods: A total of 247 patients who underwent surgical treatment for gastric cancer between January 1999 and De-cember 2010 at the Seoul Medical Center were evaluated. Based on their medical insurance status, the patients were classified into two groups: the national health insurance registered group (n= 183), and the <b>medical</b> aid <b>covered</b> group (n= 64). The survival rates were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Results: The median postoperative duration of hospitalization was longer in the <b>medical</b> aid <b>covered</b> group and postoperative morbidity and mortality were higher in the medical aid group than in the national health insurance registered group (P< 0. 05). The overall 5 -year survival rate was 43. 9 % in the <b>medical</b> aid <b>covered</b> group and 64. 3 % in the national health insurance registered group (P= 0. 001). Conclusions: The medical insurance status reflects the socioeconomic status of a patient and can influence the overall survival of gastric cancer patients.
