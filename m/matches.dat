Fuzzy <b>matching</b> has been proposed in which not exactly <b>matched</b> but nearly <b>matched</b> data are returned to the user.

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{introduces}} a linear relaxation of the matroid <b>matching</b> problem, called the fractional matroid <b>matching</b> problem. When the matroid <b>matching</b> problem {{is in fact}} a matroid intersection problem, the fractional matroid <b>matching</b> polytope and the matroid <b>matching</b> polytope coincide. When the matroid <b>matching</b> problem {{is in fact a}} <b>matching</b> problem in a graph, the fractional matroid <b>matching</b> polytope and the classic fractional <b>matching</b> polytope of the graph coincide. Thus, the fractional matroid <b>matching</b> polytope may properly contain the matroid <b>matching</b> polytope. The fractional matroid <b>matching</b> polytope is a lattice polyhedron and, although its extreme points are not all integral, they are half-integral. This paper establishes strong relationships between extreme points of the fractional matroid <b>matching</b> polytope and those of graphic fractional <b>matching</b> polyhedra. Despite these strong relationships, adding the rank 1 inequalities does not define the matroid <b>matching</b> polytope. In fact, even the <b>matching</b> polytope of a graphic matroid is not generally described by adding these inequalities...|$|R

40|$|To {{manipulate}} {{semantic web}} and integrate different data sources efficiently, automatic schema <b>matching</b> {{plays a key}} role. A generic schema <b>matching</b> method generally includes two phases: the linguistic similarity <b>matching</b> phase and the structural similarity <b>matching</b> phase. Since linguistic <b>matching</b> is an essential step for effective schema <b>matching,</b> developing a high accurate linguistic similarity <b>matching</b> scheme is required. In this paper, a schema <b>matching</b> approach called Similarity Yield Matcher (SYM) is proposed. In SYM, a lexical decision tree is presented to determine the linguistic similarity <b>matching</b> of the first phase. A structural <b>matching</b> algorithm is then proposed to find the structure similarity between two tree schemas.
