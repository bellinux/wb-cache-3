25|$|In {{the first}} decade of the 20th century, Ithaca {{experienced}} a housing and population boom largely attributable to the expansion of the tramways through the area. Subsequently, in the 1910s the Ithaca Town Council embarked on a programme of civic improvements which included the formation and <b>metalling</b> of roads; tree planting; and the establishment of numerous embankment gardens, small reserves and street gardens.|$|E
2500|$|The <b>metalling</b> was in two layers, a {{foundation}} of medium to large stones covered by a running surface, often a compacted mixture of smaller flint and gravel. About one quarter of road pavements were [...] "bottomed" [...] with large stones, mostly {{in the north and}} west where stone was more readily available. Some high-status roads in Italy were bound together by volcanic mortar, and a small minority of excavated sites in Britain have shown concrete or limestone mortar. Road surfaces in the iron-producing areas of the Weald were made from iron slag. The average depth of <b>metalling</b> over 213 recorded roads is about , with great variation from as little as [...] to up to [...] in places, probably built up over centuries.|$|E
2500|$|The first {{improvements}} {{were made}} to the aforementioned section through Cameron, which is called by its original name of Leesburg in the official route description. [...] It consisted of <b>metalling</b> (gravel surfacing) the southern portion of State Route 104, a federal aid route which provided the parish seat with its first highway connection to what was essentially the mainland. [...] Route 104 followed what is now the western leg of LA27 south from Sulphur in neighboring Calcasieu Parish and around the west side of Calcasieu and Mud Lakes to the gulf coast at Holly Beach. [...] It then turned east to Cameron, running concurrent with the future Route 292. [...] This work was completed by 1930. [...] Then, as now, a ferry service provided the necessary crossing at Calcasieu Pass.|$|E

6000|$|... 3. Majrá--here {{pronounced}} [...] "Maghráh"[EN#29]--the divide; literally, {{the place}} of flowing. It is the best ground of all, especially where the yellow or brown sands are overlaid by hard gravel, or by a natural <b>metalling</b> of trap and other stones.|$|E
60|$|There {{were two}} landing-places {{for the large}} Ingotro concession, both on the right bank. The lower leads, they say, over dry land, but the way is long and hilly. That up stream is peculiarly foul, and to us it was made fouler by the pelting shower. At low water, in the dry season, the little Nánwá creek, {{subtending}} the higher ground on the north, becomes too shallow for the smallest dug-out; {{and we had to}} wade or to be carried over an expanse of fetid and poisonous mangrove-mud festering in the sun, and promising a luxuriant growth of ague and fever. The first rise of sandy yellow loam showed the normal Gold Coast <b>metalling</b> of iron-stone and quartz-gravel, thinly spread with water-rounded pebbles. Then the path, very badly laid out, merged into a second foul morass, whose depths were crossed by the rudest of bridges, single and double trunks of felled or fallen trees. Nothing easier than to corduroy this mauvais pas.|$|E
60|$|This fine {{concession}} is {{a rectangular}} parallelogram, whose dimensions are 2,000 yards long {{from north to}} south, by a breadth of half. The village stands outside the south-western angle, and the Fía rivulet runs through the south-eastern corner. The surface is rolling ground, with a rise and a depression trending from south-west to north-east. The whole extent, except where 'bush' lingers, is an old plantation of bananas, manioc, and ground-nuts. There is an ample supply of good hard timber, but red pitch-pine or creosoted teak from England would last much longer. Amongst the trees are especially noted the copal, the gamboge, rich in sticky juice, the brovi, {{said to be the}} hardest wood, and the dum, or African mahogany (Oldfieldia africana), well known in Ceylon as excellent material for boat-building. There was an abundance of the Calabar-bean (Physostigma venenosum), once used for an ordeal-poison, and now applied by surgery in ophthalmic and other complaints. The 'tie-tie,' as Anglo-Africans call the rope-like creepers, was also plentiful; it may prove valuable for cordage, and possibly for paper-making. I was pleased to see the ease with which the heaped-up jungle-growth is burnt at this season and the facility of road-making. Half a dozen Kru-boys with their matchets can open, at the rate of some miles a day, a path fit to carry a 'sulky;' and the ground wants only <b>metalling</b> with the stone which lines every stream. At the same time I hold that here, as in Mexico, we should begin with railways and tramways. Nor will there be any difficulty in keeping down the jungle. The soft and silky Bahama-grass has been brought from Sá Leone to Axim, where it covers the open spaces, and it grows well at Akankon. There is no trouble except to plant a few roots, which extend themselves afar; and the carpet when thick allows, like the orange-tree, no undergrowth.|$|E

50|$|Sections {{made through}} some better {{preserved}} {{parts of the}} road show it to have been of light construction with about 3 in of <b>metalling,</b> usually on a low agger, but in drier places laid direct on the natural subsoil. The width of <b>metalling</b> varies from 25 ft at the wider points, on an agger about 40 ft wide, down to 9 ft on terraceways crossing hillsides. The <b>metalling</b> on this road {{has been found to}} be flint at all the points studied, with a camber of about 8 in. Well preserved examples of the agger occur along the south side of Plumpton Racecourse and adjoining the B2117 road south of Hurstpierpoint.|$|E

50|$|The average {{width of}} the paved road is 7.4 m, or 25 Roman pedes. This is wider than the average 6.51 m or 22 pedes for Roman roads in Britain. The overall width between the outer ditches, which can still be seen on aerial {{photographs}} taken over the South Downs, is 25.6 m or 86 pedes. The actual width of <b>metalling</b> varies from place to place, and the outer ditches {{were found to be}} 27.4 m apart at Westhampnet. Sections of intact road that have been excavated in several places show a variety of local materials, with the agger often being constructed of alternating layers of sand and gravel paved with large flint nodules, or sandstone, surfaced with smaller flint or sand and gravel. The <b>metalling</b> was generally about 30 cm thick at the centre with a pronounced camber. Near to the Alfoldean station the <b>metalling</b> was constructed from iron slag in a solid 30 cm thick mass.|$|E

50|$|The {{need for}} the {{adoption}} of roadmaking methods which would produce more durable results was stressed by Mr. Keane (the county overseer) in 1919. He pointed out {{that only a few}} of the roads had lasted even a third of the term of 36 years relating to the loans which had been raised to construct them. His estimate of the cost of improving the Gisborne-Morere, Gisborne-Kaiteratahi, Gisborne-Hangaroa, Gisborne-Mangapoike and Gisborne-Waimata roads was: <b>Metalling</b> only, £114,100; <b>metalling</b> and tar-sealing, £257,300; and, for concrete, £405,200. Early in 1920 the council sent him to the United States of America to study the latest methods of roadmaking and to inspect the newest types of plant.|$|E
50|$|Many {{clearance}} {{stones were}} used in the construction of defensive structures, houses, farm buildings, walls, drainage ditches, road <b>metalling,</b> etc. Where permanent clearance cairns were formed it was predominately on waste land, such as steep slopes, edges of woodland, field corners, and around earth-fast boulders.|$|E

5000|$|Stravaganzza is a Dark <b>metal</b> {{band from}} Madrid, Spain formed in 2004. The band has since {{released}} 4 studio albums and one EP.

50|$|Thickness of <b>metalling</b> also varies greatly, as {{does the}} size of agger. In some places a thick mass of iron slag was laid on the land surface, as at the {{excavated}} section at Holtye where the slag <b>metalling</b> was 30 cm in the centre reducing to 7.5 cm at the edges, laid directly on the clay subsoil and rusted into a concrete-like mass. Elsewhere an earth agger was protected by a much thinner stone layer, as on Ashdown Forest near Five Hundred Acre Wood where only about 7.5 cm of compacted sandstone lumps were bedded on 5 cm of yellow clay. The London {{end of the road}} was built of gravel or small flints over a layer of larger flints or pebbles, about 30 cm thick at the centre, sometimes on a bed of sand.|$|E
50|$|Memorial Trees {{were planted}} in {{the main street of}} the Beerburrum Soldier Settlement in 1920 and the street renamed Anzac Avenue in honour of the fallen comrades of the soldier settlers.

50|$|At Marlpit Hill {{the road}} makes a small {{direction}} change {{of only three}} degrees, and almost entirely keeps to this line to the high ground of Ashdown Forest. The straight run of Edenbridge High Street, crossing the River Eden and continuing to Dencross, where it continues as a private drive, is the most impressive surviving section of the road. Beyond this the road has been lost, seen only in hedgelines and traces of iron slag <b>metalling</b> in fields. In Peters Wood at Holtye an agger with iron slag <b>metalling</b> can be seen and on a footpath south of the A264 road a length of almost 100 metres of intact road was excavated in 1939, revealing a slag metalled surface in excellent condition and showing wheel marks. Part of this area south of the road has been kept uncovered by the Sussex Archaeological Trust. The agger is clearly visible south of this point and again at Butcherfield Lane, Hartfield, where 40 cm of slag <b>metalling</b> was found on a large wide agger. The road then climbs a small steep hill in an engineered cutting. At Chuck Hatch the road enters Ashdown Forest, zig-zagging to cross a gill at Loneoak Hall, then maintaining its straight line onto the high forest. It then turns 46 degrees west and uses a number of straight alignments to follow the ridge to Camp Hill. This forest section was metalled with sandstone, and was more clearly visible before being damaged by tank training exercises during World War II. Distinct side ditches near Camp Hill are 19 m apart.|$|E
