40|$|Formation and {{selection}} of <b>multiarmed</b> spiral wave due to spontaneous symmetry breaking are investigated {{in a regular}} network of Hodgkin-Huxley neuron by changing the excitability and imposing spatial forcing currents on the neurons in the network. The arm number of the <b>multiarmed</b> spiral wave {{is dependent on the}} distribution of spatial forcing currents and excitability diversity in the network, and the selection criterion for supporting <b>multiarmed</b> spiral waves is discussed. A broken spiral segment is measured by a short polygonal line connected by three adjacent points (controlled nodes), and a double-spiral wave can be developed from the spiral segment. <b>Multiarmed</b> spiral wave is formed when a group of double-spiral waves rotate in the same direction in the network. In the numerical studies, a group of controlled nodes are selected and spatial forcing currents are imposed on these nodes, and our results show that l-arm stable spiral wave (l = 2, 3, 4, [...] . 8) can be induced to occupy the network completely. It is also confirmed that low excitability is critical to induce <b>multiarmed</b> spiral waves while high excitability is important to propagate the <b>multiarmed</b> spiral wave outside so that distinct <b>multiarmed</b> spiral wave can occupy the network completely.

40|$|The <b>multiarmed</b> bandit {{is often}} used as an analogy for the {{tradeoff}} between exploration and exploitation in search problems. The classic problem involves allocating trials to {{the arms of a}} <b>multiarmed</b> slot machine to maximize the expected sum of rewards.

Motivation for the Max K-Armed Bandit is the allocation of restarts among a set of multistart stochastic search algorithms. We present an analysis of this Max K-Armed Bandit showing under certain assumptions that the optimal strategy allocates trials to the observed best arm at a rate increasing double exponentially relative to the other arms. This motivates an exploration strategy that follows a Boltzmann distribution with an exponentially decaying temperature parameter. We compare this exploration policy to policies that allocate trials to the observed best arm at rates faster (and slower) than double exponentially.

In this and many other problems, we face a trade-off between earning (e. g., drilling immediately at the sites with maximal expected values) and learning (e. g., drilling at sites that provide valuable information) {{that may lead to}} greater earnings in the future. These “sequential exploration problems ” resemble a <b>multiarmed</b> bandit problem, but probabilistic dependence plays a key role: outcomes at drilled sites reveal information about neighboring targets. Good exploration policies will take advantage of this information as it is revealed. We develop heuristic policies for sequential exploration problems and complement these heuristics with upper bounds on the performance of an optimal policy. We begin by grouping the targets into clusters of manageable size. The heuristics are derived from a model that treats these clusters as independent. The upper bounds are given by assuming each cluster has perfect information about the results from all other clusters. The analysis relies heavily on results for bandit superprocesses, a generalization of the <b>multiarmed</b> bandit problem.

For this class of RMABs, we establish the indexability and obtain Whittle index in closed form for both discounted and average reward criteria. These results lead to a direct implementation of Whittle index policy with remarkably low complexity. When arms are stochastically identical, we show that Whittle index policy is optimal under certain conditions. Furthermore, it has a semiuniversal structure that obviates the {{need to know the}} Markov transition probabilities. The optimality and the semiuniversal structure result from the equivalence between Whittle index policy and the myopic policy established in this work.

This paper proposes a bandit-based AOS method, fitness-rate-rank-based <b>multiarmed</b> bandit (FRRMAB). In order to track {{the dynamics of the}} search process, it uses a sliding win-dow to record the recent fitness improvement rates achieved by the operators, while employing a decaying mechanism to increase the selection probability of the best operator. Not much work has been done on AOS in multiobjective evolutionary computation since {{it is very difficult to}} measure the fitness improvements quan-titatively in most Pareto-dominance-based multiobjective evolu-tionary algorithms. Multiobjective evolutionary algorithm based on decomposition (MOEA/D) decomposes a multiobjective opti-mization problem into a number of scalar optimization subprob-lems and optimizes them simultaneously. Thus, it is natural and feasible to use AOS in MOEA/D. We investigate several important issues in using FRRMAB in MOEA/D. Our experimental results demonstrate that FRRMAB is robust and its operator selection is reasonable. Comparison experiments also indicate that FRRMAB can significantly improve the performance of MOEA/D.

40|$|Abstract—We {{consider}} the restless <b>multiarmed</b> bandit problem with unknown dynamics {{in which a}} player chooses one out of arms to play at each time. The reward state of each arm transits according to an unknown Markovian rule when it is played and evolves according to an arbitrary unknown random process when it is passive. The performance of an arm selection policy is mea-sured by regret, defined as the reward loss {{with respect to the}} case where the player knows which arm is the most rewarding and al-ways plays the best arm. We construct a policy with an interleaving exploration and exploitation epoch structure that achieves a regret with logarithmic order. We further extend the problem to a decen-tralized setting where multiple distributed players share the arms without information exchange. Under both an exogenous restless model and an endogenous restless model, we show that a decen-tralized extension of the proposed policy preserves the logarithmic regret order as in the centralized setting. The results apply to adap-tive learning in various dynamic systems and communication net-works, as well as financial investment.
