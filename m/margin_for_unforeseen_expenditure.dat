50|$|Diamond and Dybvig's paper {{points out}} that {{business}} investment often requires expenditures in the present to obtain returns in the future. Therefore, they prefer loans with a long maturity (that is, low liquidity). The same principle applies to individuals seeking financing to purchase large-ticket items such as housing or automobiles. On the other hand, individual savers (both households and firms) may have sudden, unpredictable needs for cash, due to <b>unforeseen</b> <b>expenditures.</b> So they demand liquid accounts which permit them immediate access to their deposits (that is, they value short maturity deposit accounts).|$|R
50|$|The Constitution of India {{authorized}} the parliament {{to establish a}} contingency fund of India. The Contingency Fund of India is established under Article 267(1)of the Indian Constitution. It is {{in the nature of}} an imprest (money maintained for a specific purpose). Accordingly, Parliament enacted the contingency fund of India Act 1950. The fund is held by the Finance Secretary (Department of Economic Affairs) on behalf of the President of India and it can be operated by executive action.The Contingency Fund of India exists for disasters and related <b>unforeseen</b> <b>expenditures.</b> In 2005, it was raised from 50 to Rs 500 crore. Approval of the Parliament of India for such expenditure and for withdrawal of an equivalent amount from the Consolidated Fund is subsequently obtained to ensure that the corpus of the Contingency Fund remains intact. Similarly, Contingency Fund of each State Government is established under Article 267(2) of the Constitution - this is in the nature of an imprest placed at the disposal of the Governor to enable him/her to make advances to meet urgent <b>unforeseen</b> <b>expenditure,</b> pending authorization by the State Legislature. Approval of the Legislature for such expenditure and for withdrawal of an equivalent amount from the Consolidated Fund is subsequently obtained, whereupon the advances from the Contingency Fund are recouped to the Fund. The corpus varies across states and the quantum is decided by the State legislatures.|$|R

40|$|A bidding {{rotating}} {{savings and}} credit association (Rosca) is modeled as {{a sequence of}} symmetric-independent-private-value auctions with price-proportional benefits to bidders. We estimate a structural econometric model which, by introducing an altruistic component into each bidder's utility function, allows for socially favorable deviations from the private information, non-altruistic bidding equilibrium. We find that bidding is more altruistic in groups managed by experienced organizers and in Roscas whose current members have already run through more than one Rosca cycle of the current group, implying that effective leadership and enduring relationships help mitigate the social cost of strategic behavior. When a bidder has to meet an <b>unforeseen</b> <b>expenditure</b> and this information is public, bidders act more altruistically than when information is private and the Rosca funds are used for investment, indicating reciprocal risk sharing among Rosca participants.

40|$|The {{precautionary savings}} model predicts that {{households}} accumulate wealth to self-insure against unexpected declines in future income and <b>unforeseen</b> <b>expenditures.</b> The goals {{of this study}} are twofold. First, we investigate whether the near-elderly who face higher health risks save more. Second, we examine the factors that contribute to health risks that the near-elderly face. We use data from the Health and Retirement Study to construct two measures of health risks. Our results do not support the hypothesis that household savings increase with the health risks that they face. Individuals who confront higher health risks in the future are those who are already in fair or poor health status or those who have a health condition such as diabetes or lung disease. Lower earnings and high medical expenditures caused by current poor health status prevent households from accumulating savings for future health adversities...|$|R
