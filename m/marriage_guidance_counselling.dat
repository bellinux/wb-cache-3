Unfortunately, in Andrew's case, this leads to him drink-driving and accidentally knocking down Juanita Solis, leaving her seriously injured. Rex and Bree conceal this to protect him but Bree is soon disappointed with his lack of remorse. Determined to make him realize that there are consequences to his actions, she reveals, in an anonymous tip-off to the coach of the swimming team, that Andrew keeps marijuana in his locker. This discovery results in him being removed from the team. Bree is determined to keep her family together until Rex has a heart attack, leading her to discover that he regularly visited a prostitute. Worse still, the prostitute turns out to be an acquaintance of hers, Maisy Gibbons, who is later arrested for living off immoral earnings. Maisy is persuaded to do a deal with the District Attorney, naming her clients and despite a request from Bree, does not remove Rex's name. Furious, Bree tells Rex she will divorce him but is [...] "persuaded" [...] by Andrew and Danielle to look after him, while he recuperates from a heart attack. Initially wanting to hurt him, Bree starts dating local pharmacist, George Williams, but ends things when Rex asks her to give their marriage another chance. She and George agree to be just friends. Wanting to stop Rex visiting prostitutes, she reluctantly takes part in S&M scenarios with him.|$|E
40|$|This study describes, {{discusses}} and {{assesses the}} impact of a <b>marriage</b> <b>guidance</b> <b>counselling</b> service in a general medical practice. It considers the role of the counsellor in the primary health care team, the appropriateness of providing a counselling service in this setting and the nature and effect of the counselling as experienced by individual clients. The material derives from records provided by the counsellors, from medical casenotes and from interviews with 83 clients counselled at the practice, with their counsellors and with their CPs. The counselling service did appear to be a valued and valuable addition to the range of practice services. It was viewed by clients, counsellors and CPs. as contributing to the quality of patient care, as increasing access to counselling for potential clients and as improving the status and job satisfaction of counsellors. Over half of the clients interviewed had found the counselling of substantial and lasting help and only one-fifth reported no help at all. However, there were significant discrepancies between the assessments of clients, those of their counsellors and those of their CPs., emphasising the dangers of equating client satisfaction with professional judgements. There was also no evidence from medical casenotes to substantiate the claims that counselling in this setting reduces demand for medical services. In addition, if this was to become a general policy development, there were argued to be some unresolved issues in areas such as the desirability of moving towards access to counselling through medical referral? the motivation of clients for whom counselling was 'prescribed'; and the pressures on unpaid, part-time counsellors and on their voluntary marriage guidance organisation, in terms of the most appropriate use of their limited resources and the difficulties of working along side a statutory, highly professionalised service, provided largely 'free' at the point of demand...|$|E

40|$|The overall aim of {{this study}} was to explore the {{perceptions}} of regular teachers of a whole school approach (WSA) to <b>guidance</b> <b>counselling</b> in a mid west post-primary school. The study focuses on the critical discourse developing in the area of <b>guidance</b> <b>counselling</b> provision as a result of the policy decisions in Budget 2012. Whilst a similar study was completed from an eastern perspective by Hui (2002) and Lam and Hui (20 I 0). this study addresses a gap in research on the perceptions of regular teachers of a WSA to <b>guidance</b> <b>counselling</b> from a western perspective. This case study used a mixed method approach with two phases of data collection. Phase I consisted of 30 self reporting online SurveyMonkey questionnaires and Phase 2 collected narratives through interpretive interviews with six regular teachers who volunteered in the survey. The main themes that emerged in the findings related to the: delivery of a holistic education experience: the pastoral care role of regular teachers in the post-primary school; whole school approach (WSA) to guidance counselling; and the implications of Budget 2012 on the <b>guidance</b> <b>counselling</b> provision in the school. The conclusions centre around a disconnect between the current shift of focus in policy in BUdget 2012 and the resultant inadequate guidelines and training being delivered in the postprimary case school.

40|$|The study {{investigated}} challenges in School <b>Guidance</b> and <b>Counselling</b> (SGC) services provisions {{for children with}} disabilities in Zimbabwean inclusive primary schools as a context for strategizing on overcoming them and proposing a model of School <b>Guidance</b> and <b>Counselling</b> services provisions {{for children with disabilities}}. The survey design, which was mainly quantitative in nature, was used. Self-administered questionnaires were used to collect data. Three hundred inclusive primary school administrators and three hundred school counsellors participated in the study. The Statistical Package for the Social Sciences, version 11. 0 was used to analyze data. Frequency tables, ratios and Chi-square tests were computed. The study revealed that Zimbabwean inclusive primary school counsellors lacked training in School <b>Guidance</b> and <b>Counselling</b> and Special Needs Education. The school counsellors also lacked experience in teaching children with disabilities and the stakeholders had negative attitudes towards School <b>Guidance</b> and <b>Counselling</b> services provisions for children with disabilities. It was further revealed that inclusive primary schools lacked materials and supplies, time, finance, physical and curricular resources. The study revealed that there was no mandatory School <b>Guidance</b> and <b>Counselling</b> policy and legislation, clear mission statement, School <b>Guidance</b> and <b>Counselling</b> Framework, school counsellor certification requirements nor a School <b>Guidance</b> and <b>Counselling</b> national model. These facilities, together with Special Needs Education, experience in teaching children with disabilities and staff development, were found to positively impact on SGC services provisions for children with disabilities. School counsellors’ training in School <b>Guidance</b> and <b>Counselling,</b> advocacy on disabilities, stakeholders’ collaboration, passing mandatory School <b>Guidance</b> and <b>Counselling</b> policy and legislation, adequate budgetary and time allocation were seen as strategies to overcome challenges in SGC services provisions for children with disabilities in Zimbabwean inclusive primary schools. It was recommended that School <b>Guidance</b> and <b>Counselling</b> services provisions for children with disabilities in Zimbabwean inclusive primary schools would improve if there would be promulgation of mandatory School <b>Guidance</b> and <b>Counselling</b> policy and legislation, school counsellors’ training in School <b>Guidance</b> and <b>Counselling,</b> requisition of adequate resources and development of positive attitudes among stakeholders.

Available literature shows that students worldwide, including Zimbabwe, experience problems which schools should solve through the provision of <b>guidance</b> and <b>counselling.</b> It was therefore, important to the researcher to assess {{the effectiveness of the}} school <b>guidance</b> and <b>counselling</b> services in meeting students' concerns. The research design consisted of a literature and an empirical study. The survey method was used in the empirical study. A self constructed questionnaire was used. Three hundred and fourteen school counsellors and 636 students participated in this study. The SAS/STAT version 9. 1 was used to analyse the data. One way and combined two way frequency tables were calculated. Ratios were calculated to establish the relative rating of each item. Chi-square tests were also calculated. The study revealed that there were differences between the level of the school <b>guidance</b> and <b>counselling</b> services in Zimbabwean secondary schools and the international arena. For example, school <b>guidance</b> and <b>counselling</b> services policy in Zimbabwe was not mandatory as compared to the international policies. The Zimbabwean school <b>guidance</b> and <b>counselling</b> services were not always planned for {{at the beginning of each}} year, Students and parents were not frequently involved in needs assessment while the services were not frequently evaluated in comparison with those in the international arena. The study also revealed that some biographical variables significantly influenced the way the respondents responded to given items while others did not.

The study further revealed that the effectiveness of the Zimbabwean secondary school <b>guidance</b> and <b>counselling</b> services was negatively affected by lack of resources and training in <b>guidance</b> and <b>counselling</b> and non-counselling duties performed by school counsellors.

40|$|Thesis (M. Ed.) -University of Durban-Westville, 2003. The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{determine}} the perceptions of school counselors or guidance educators and students about the need for <b>Guidance</b> and <b>Counselling</b> in schools. Changes in the political arena and the birth of the new dispensation brought about changes in education and service delivery. The doors of education were opened to allow even the poorest of the poor to access equal opportunities. Apartheid education had disempowered black people to the advantage of whites. For the first time in the history of our education everyone enjoyed equal access and opportunities. Our classrooms became places where young people, black and white, can now access the best education for them to succeed in life, and fulfill ambitions that not so long ago seemed so remote. The study focuses on the availability of psychological services in ten high schools in the greater Durban North region. Questionnaires were administered to School Counsellors, Guidance educators and students in schools where school <b>Guidance</b> and <b>Counselling</b> is offered and to those in schools where it is not offered. It was hypothesized that <b>Guidance</b> and <b>Counselling</b> was not effectively and adequately offered in high schools. The results of the study indicate that both educators and students feel that there is the need to either revive or improve <b>guidance</b> and <b>counselling</b> services. Statistical analysis indicated that the majority of African schools that participated in the study do not offer <b>Guidance</b> and <b>Counselling,</b> with the lack of resources as the main cause. Retrenchments and the granting of voluntary severance packages were cited as some of the factors affecting the delivery of quality <b>guidance</b> and <b>counselling.</b> Schools are unique and problems and challenges facing them differ from one area to another, yet there is a dire need to improve the <b>Guidance</b> and <b>Counselling</b> services that are generally inadequate.

40|$|The {{overarching}} aim of {{this research}} was to examine guidance counsellors’ experiences of the removal of the ex-quota allocation for <b>guidance</b> <b>counselling</b> in the Irish post-primary sector post Budget 2012. As the researcher’s original study (Connor, 2013) examined the same topic, this follow-on investigation specifically focussed on the two areas of professionalism and the role of guidance counsellors and the wellbeing of practitioners in current practice. Similar to Connor (2013) an interpretivist paradigm underpins the current study. Semi-structured interviews were held with seven qualified practitioners in the East of Ireland to examine their perceptions and experiences of the allocation removal on their professional role, the services they provide to students, and the overall guidance profession. The findings indicate that some confusion still exists within the Irish post-primary sector about the meaning of ‘appropriate’ guidance as articulated in the Education Act, 1998. In addition, {{there appears to be a}} significant gap between policies from the Department of Education and Skills (DES) relating to a Whole-School Approach (WSA) to guidance and current practice in post-primary schools. The findings also identify some uncertainty about the service provided by guidance counsellors in the school system. Finally, a lack of a coordinated response from the DES and Institute of Guidance Counsellors (IGC) to help practitioners deal with the increased workload and pressures resulting from the Budget 2012 allocation removal is highlighted. This research study can contribute to policy and practice within post-primary <b>guidance</b> <b>counselling</b> as it provides insights into the ramifications of the Budget 2012 allocation removal on the profession of <b>guidance</b> <b>counselling,</b> individual practitioners and services to pupils.
