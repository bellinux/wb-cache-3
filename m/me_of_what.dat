5|$|It's {{definitely}} riskier {{than something}} a bit more... simple. I {{just heard the}} track and loved {{that it was so}} different: it felt a bit African, a bit electronic and futuristic. It reminded <b>me</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> I love, which is mixing different cultures and eras — things that typically don't go together — to create a new sound. I can never be safe; I always try and go against the grain. As soon as I accomplish one thing, I just set a higher goal. That's how I've gotten to where I am.|$|E
500|$|Russell Crowe {{originally}} {{auditioned for}} a different role in the film before Sharon Stone asked that the actor try for the lead male role. [...] "When I saw Romper Stomper (1992), I thought Russell was not only charismatic, attractive and talented but also fearless," [...] Stone reasoned. [...] "And I find fearlessness very attractive. I was convinced I wouldn't scare him." [...] Raimi found Crowe to be [...] "bold and challenging. He reminds <b>me</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> we imagine the American cowboy to have been like." [...] On working with Raimi, Crowe later described the director as [...] "sort of like the fourth Stooge." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{staff of}} Open Salon.com enjoyed the episode, writing [...] "While I enjoyed {{the last eight}} weeks of {{alternate}} universe hijinks, this week's episode reminded <b>me</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> I had been missing from the earlier seasons... It's nice to know we'll {{be back with our}} good old regular Earth-1 team for the foreseeable future. Overall, this week was really well done - very effectively creepy, well directed and plotted with just the right about of gore to make you jump". Jeff Jensen of Entertainment Weekly named [...] "Marionette" [...] the eleventh best episode of the series, calling it [...] "a strong, disturbing outing that was part of Fringes mid-series peak, in which the show found its best storytelling voice by crafting strange, emotionally resonant case-of-the-week plots that thematically paralleled the ongoing character arcs in ways that felt organic, not contrived." [...] In a similar 2013 list, Den of Geek ranked the episode as the third best of the entire series.|$|E

6000|$|... "I {{thank you}} for the tribute. You imagined, of course, that I was a scene-shifter. And now that you know all about <b>me,</b> <b>what</b> <b>of</b> Gavrillac? <b>What</b> <b>of</b> my godfather?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Look here," [...] he intervened, [...] "you go too far, my friend. You {{never spoke}} to <b>me</b> <b>of</b> this. <b>What</b> have you against Hunterleys?" ...|$|R
500|$|The episode {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} television critics. Eric Goldman, writing for IGN, gave the episode an 8.8 out of 10, indicating {{that it was}} [...] "great". He referred to [...] "Mars, Bars" [...] {{as one of the}} finest episodes of season three, praising the Valentine's Day subplot, the development of the mystery of Dean O'Dell's death, and Muhney's performance. Regarding Logan, he opined that although he did not like him moping after his breakup with Veronica, this episode fixed that by including him in the Valentine's Day subplot and setting up a romantic relationship with Parker: [...] "it's just a huge relief to see Logan in a different light and interacting with different people, finally." [...] He also praised Lamb's death scene as being devoid of clichés by not giving him an act of heroism for his dying moments. Reviewer Alan Sepinwall, on his blog What's Alan Watching?, lauded the episode. He saw the episode and the previous episode as a return to form for Veronica Mars, writing, [...] "it's episodes like these last two that remind <b>me</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> this show looks like when it's really cooking." [...] He also enjoyed the lack of a redemptive moment for Lamb {{at the end of his}} life as well as the comedic value of some scenes in the episode.|$|E
2500|$|By 1 p.m., {{the show}} held a second {{production}} meeting {{to go over}} scripts and determine which pieces to edit. Scripts were [...] "hopefully" [...] completed around 4 p.m., and a rehearsal with the entire staff would begin at 5:30p.m. or occasionally earlier. Afterward, final changes {{were made to the}} script. The final rewrite would take place in a [...] "small, red, poorly ventilated room" [...] until 6:45p.m. Before interviewing his guests, Colbert met with them in the green room and acknowledged that he was playing a character, noting that the persona is [...] "willfully ignorant of what you know and care about" [...] and urging the guest to [...] "honestly disabuse <b>me</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> you see as my ignorance." [...] Emily Lazar, a producer for the interview segments, advised guests to talk with Colbert as though he were a [...] "harmless drunk at the next bar stool." [...] Guests would typically take their seats around 7 p.m., when a warm-up comedian (perhaps Jared Logan or Paul Mercurio) delivered jokes. Colbert, out of character, held a brief question and answer session with the audience prior to taping. Taping lasted as long as three hours but usually ended around 9 p.m., at which point the show was edited and sent to Comedy Central for broadcast. As the show was being edited, the staff met one last time to work through details for the next show.|$|E
60|$|Duke. I am on fire 'till I {{discover}} her. [Aside.]--At least, madam, tell <b>me</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> family you are.|$|E
6000|$|... "I am {{what you}} make me," [...] he answered, in a low tone. [...] "Catherine! A moment ago you accused <b>me</b> <b>of</b> stubbornness. <b>What</b> about yourself?" ...|$|R
6000|$|LILY. Yes, it's very likely, Isey, {{with those}} fine round eyes! (To L.) You'll tell <b>me</b> {{something}} <b>of</b> <b>what</b> you've been saying, to-morrow, won't you? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{must not}} be afraid, Yvonne," [...] he said earnestly; [...] "you must think <b>of</b> <b>me</b> and <b>of</b> <b>what</b> you are doing for me. My word on it--Robespierre will listen to you most kindly." ...|$|R
6000|$|Ulys. I shall wait on you. As freely tell <b>me,</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> honour was This Cressida in Troy? had she no lovers there, Who mourn her absence? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then I wish he {{were absent}} now," [...] I whispered back, {{for at the}} words a sudden fear shot through <b>me,</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> I could not say.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{was a very}} coward, I own; but it was for my mother's sake. If I feared death, it {{was because}} I bethought <b>me</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> it must mean to her." ...|$|E
60|$|Mor. You'll please {{to leave}} <b>me</b> judge <b>of</b> <b>what</b> I do, And not examine by the outward show. Your usage {{of my mother}} might be good: I judged it not.|$|R
6000|$|... "Hah! I thought so," [...] exclaimed Toolooha, evidently {{pleased at}} her {{penetration}} on this point. [...] "Go, child, I cannot quit the lamp. Bring <b>me</b> news <b>of</b> <b>what</b> they say and do." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not all the wit of South, or of Etherege," [...] said Buckingham hastily, [...] "to {{say nothing}} of my own, shall in future make <b>me</b> {{oblivious}} <b>of</b> <b>what</b> I owe the Morisco Princess." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You have {{a pretty}} gift of parable, lady, {{as it should be}} with one who interprets the oracles of a goddess. But you have not told <b>me</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> I, your servant, am the symbol." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Truly I know thou lovest me, Eric; {{but tell}} <b>me</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> worth is this love of man that eyes {{of beauty and}} tongue of craft may so readily bewray? I doubt me of thee, Eric!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{leave us}} all desolated, my dear Pamela," [...] she said. [...] "You remind <b>me</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> your poor dear {{father used to}} say--'Almost any one could live with Pamela if she always had her own way.'" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{feel as if}} I {{had seen}} my Doppelganger," [...] said Searle. [...] "He reminds <b>me</b> <b>of</b> myself. <b>What</b> am I but a mere figure in the landscape, a {{wandering}} minstrel or picker of daisies?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{shall not}} tell you. I will not demean myself by repeating {{anything}} so insignificant {{in my own}} justification. If you suspect <b>me</b> <b>of</b> writing <b>what</b> I should not write, you will suspect <b>me</b> also <b>of</b> lying to conceal it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It is the {{day when}} our {{thoughts}} turn naturally to the dead, and mine are with my mother, who has lain in her grave these three years. I am thinking <b>of</b> <b>what</b> she reared <b>me</b> and <b>of</b> <b>what</b> I am." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The consul has {{informed}} <b>me</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> {{you said}} to him," [...] he answered, kindly. [...] "But, if you will take my advice, I recommend you to tell your story to Lady Janet in your own words." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "This," [...] she replied, blushing. [...] "Suddenly {{he looked}} up and in my own tongue asked <b>me</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> colour were my eyes. I {{answered}} that it depended upon the light in which they might be seen.|$|E
6000|$|... "Very well. Bring Ann--Oh, Peter, {{that reminds}} <b>me</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> I {{wanted to say}} to you, which this dreadful thing in the paper drove {{completely}} out of my mind. Lord Wisbeach has asked Ann to marry him!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Whether I am or no {{makes little}} {{difference}} now, {{since he has}} agreed to join us," [...] I replied, and the lad, to win <b>me</b> out <b>of</b> <b>what</b> was very like a sulky mood, continued: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Pan, you talk--like--oh, {{you make}} <b>me</b> think <b>of</b> <b>what</b> might have been," [...] she cried. [...] "But I'll not consent. I'll not give men {{the right to}} point their fingers at Blink.... I'll run away--or--or kill myself." ...|$|R
60|$|BOHUN (interrupting him). If you did, {{you would}} be <b>me,</b> instead <b>of</b> being <b>what</b> you are.|$|R
6000|$|... "That reminds <b>me</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> I {{wanted to}} say. If you'll believe me, my dear, Steve has got that very idea into his head! Did you or Mac put it there?" [...] asked Kitty, industriously clashing her shears.|$|E
6000|$|... "The Fair of Doune, Annot?" [...] said Allan sadly; [...] "there will be bloody {{work before}} that day, and I may never see it; {{but you have}} well {{reminded}} <b>me</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> I have long intended to do." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Thou tellest <b>me</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> my {{own eyes}} have been a witness. Did I not arrive when men's voices spoke of nothing else? A {{beautiful}} court and a pleasant capital were those of France in our day, Signori." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Fair sir, of your {{kindness}} will ye {{climb the}} ladder there, and bring <b>me</b> news <b>of</b> <b>what</b> ye find? Be {{not afraid to}} report, for times can come when even a mother's heart is past breaking --being already broke." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{see what}} you mean--a {{willingness}} to take the right road, if I can find it. I am {{not at all sure}} that I want to take it. But you must tell <b>me</b> more--more <b>of</b> <b>what</b> you have discovered. Will you?" ...|$|R
6000|$|When {{she paused}} {{by me and}} asked <b>me</b> lightly <b>of</b> <b>what</b> I was dreaming, since I had such a sober face, I {{answered}} her truly that it was of her--whereat she laughed, as one not ill pleased, and said half mockingly: ...|$|R
