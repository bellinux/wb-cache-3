25|$|Depending on geology {{and soil}} type, pump and treat {{may be a}} good method to quickly reduce high {{concentrations}} of pollutants. It is more difficult to reach sufficiently low concentrations to satisfy remediation standards, due to the equilibrium of absorption/desorption processes in the soil. However, pump and treat is typically not the best form of remediation. It is expensive to treat the groundwater, and typically is a very slow process to clean up a release with pump and treat. It is best suited to control the hydraulic gradient and keep a release from spreading further. Better options of in-situ treatment often include air sparge/soil vapor extraction (AS/SVE) or dual phase extraction/multiphase extraction(DPE/MPE). Other methods include trying to increase the dissolved oxygen content of the groundwater to support microbial degradation of the compound (especially petroleum) by direct injection of oxygen into the subsurface, or the direct injection of a slurry that slowly releases oxygen over time (typically <b>magnesium</b> <b>peroxide</b> or calium oxy-hydroxide).|$|E

40|$|The {{oxidation}} state of four transition metals (Fe, Mn, Cu, and Cr) in cloudwater {{has been investigated}} during several cloud events at Whiteface Mountain (NY), one cloud event at San Pedro Hill (CA), and one fog event at Bakersfield (CA). Samples were collected and immediately analyzed for the {{oxidation state}}s of four transition metals: Fe(II) [44 measurements], Cu(I) [30 measurements], Mn(IV) [27 measurements], and Cr(III) [3 measurements]. Extreme care was taken to minimize contamination and interferences when measuring these oxidation states. Particulate and dissolved concentrations of these metals were also determined. Other measurements performed—relevant to the redox chemistry of these metals—included pH, total elemental concentrations (Fe, Cu, Mn, Cr, Al, K, Ca, Na, and Mg), organic anions (formate, acetate, glycolate, oxalate), inorganic anions (chloride, sulfate, nitrate, sulfite), cations (sodium, calcium, <b>magnesium,</b> potassium), <b>peroxides,</b> and formaldehyde. These measurements were then used in thermodynamic-speciation models to understand the speciation of ambient fog and cloudwater. From this analysis, two different cases were found for Fe(III) soluble speciation. Fe(III) was found to exist either as Fe(OH) _ 2 ^+ or Fe(Oxalate) _ 2. However, an unidentified strong chelating ligand with Fe(III) was also suggested by the data. Cu(I) and Cu(II) were calculated to be predominantly Cu^+ and Cu^(2 +) (with less than 10 % as Cu(II) -oxalate complexes). A chemical kinetic model was also used to investigate the transition-metal chemistry. The model results indicate that Fe(II) should be the predominant chemical form of Fe during daylight conditions. This prediction is {{in agreement with the}} field measurements in which the highest ratios of Fe(II) /Fe total were found in samples collected during the day. The model results also indicated that Fe(III) should be the predominant form of Fe during nighttime conditions, which is also in agreement with the field measurements. In the model, Cu(II) and Mn(II) were the predominant oxidation states during daylight and nighttime conditions with Cu(I) and Mn(III) increasing during daylight conditions. Mn(III) concentrations were never high enough to influence the redox chemistry of Cr. Overall, Cr(VI) in cloudwater is predicted to be reduced to Cr(III) if free S(IV) is present...|$|R
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Interest grew {{in the development of}} new oxidising agents as a replacement for high purity meta-chloroperbenzoic acid (mCPBA) and avoiding the difficulty in obtaining high strength hydrogen <b>peroxide.</b> <b>Magnesium</b> monoperoxyphthalate (MMPP) has been advertised as a replacement. However due to problems of solubility of this oxidant in a number of solvents, it cannot be considered as a complete substitute for mCPBA. An oxidising agent is required to either complement MMPP, or succeed mCPBA entirely. This thesis describes the investigation of some hydrogen peroxide adducts as a possible contender to the extremely versatile oxidant, mCPBA. Urea-hydrogen peroxide adduct (UHP) in combination with either trifluoroacetic or acetic anhydride was used for the in situ formation of percarboxylic acids. Oxidations of various functional groups were carried out using these peracids. Reactions include: the epoxidation of terminal, electron deficient alkenes, such as octene, by trifluoroperacetic acid; the epoxidation of electron rich alkenes, such as styrenes and cyclohexenes, by peracetic acid; Baeyer-Villiger reactions of both aliphatic and alkyl aryl ketones by trifluoroperacetic acid; the conversion of anilines into nitrobenzenes; the oxidation of tertiary amines and sulphides; and the oxidative cleavage of dimethylhydrazones. A number of other hydrogen peroxide adducts were produced and their performance in various oxidation reactions was compared to that of ureahydrogen peroxide. Experiments in the formation of adducts to induce chirality in epoxidation reactions were also undertaken...|$|R
50|$|In certain {{circumstances}} MgO2 {{has also been}} shown to inhibit growth of bacteria. In particular, the growth of sulfate-reducing bacteria can be inhibited in an environment containing <b>magnesium</b> <b>peroxide.</b> While the oxygen slowly dissociates, it is theorized that it may then act to displace the sulfate that normally acts as the terminal electron acceptor in their electron transport chain.|$|E
50|$|Liquid oxygen {{supplements}} {{are products}} {{that claim to}} add extra oxygen to the human body, most often through a chemical process in the digestive system, like the breakdown of hydrogen peroxide or <b>magnesium</b> <b>peroxide.</b> While the FDA describes these products as being inert, and has penalized some producers who made explicit medical claims, it has not prohibited their sale.|$|E
50|$|For {{sanitation}} purposes <b>magnesium</b> <b>peroxide</b> {{is often}} used {{as a source of}} oxygen for aerobic organisms in the treatment and disposal of biological waste. Since the breakdown of hydrocarbons in soil is usually quicker in aerobic conditions, MgO2 can also added to compost piles or in soil to speed up the microbe activities and to reduce the odors produced in the process.|$|E
40|$|During oxygen {{delignification}} of kraft pulp the alkalinity has a decisive influence upon the selectivity, defined as viscosity {{at a given}} kappa number. Using 0. 2 % pulp consistency {{in order to achieve}} constant pH-levels a minimum selectivity was reached at pH 13, corresponding to 0. 1 M NaOH. At higher pH-levels the selectivity increased and the yield decreased. By lowering the pH the selectivity and the yield increased. With Na 2 CO 3 as active alkali the selectivity increased with decreasing alkalinity. Additions of large amounts of magnesium converted the alkali to Mg(OH). This led to a lowered pH and increased wet combustion of dissolved organic substances, generating alkali. Both the delignification and the depolymerization rates decreased, mainly due to the lowered pH. An improved selectivity was achieved. At 0. 1 M NaOH the addition of kraft lignin or spent bleach liquors resulted in a markedly decreased pH and improved selectivity. Higher alkalinities or injection of alkali in order to maintain a constant pH-level decreased the selectivity. Additions of aniline or dimethyl aniline improved the selectivity significantly without negative effects on the delignification rate. This improvement was additional to the protective effect of magnesium. In oxygen-alkali treatments of cellobiitol, a model substance for cellulose, addition of manganese(II) was found to exert protective as well as degrading effects, depending on the addition level of manganese, the purity, the temperature and the alkalinity of the system. The concentration at which the net manganese effect turned from retardation to promotion of the oxidation was lower the higher the purity of the system. The protective effect of manganese was different to that of magnesium. <b>Magnesium</b> compounds stabilized <b>peroxide</b> formed while manganese promoted its decomposition. Magnesium added to the system of the highest purity containing 10 mg/L manganese had a small but significant increasing effect on the degradation rate of cellobiitol. Iron and copper additions exerted catalytic effects on cellobiitol. Copper added to a system containing iron suppressed the catalytic effect of iron. Manganese, 10 mg/L, substantially decreased the catalytic effects of iron or copper or both...|$|R

50|$|MgO2 can be {{produced}} by mixing MgO with hydrogen peroxide to create <b>magnesium</b> <b>peroxide</b> and water.

The synthesized nanoparticles were characterized using Thermo gravimetric -Differential Thermal Analysis (TG- DTA), X-Ray Diffraction studies (XRD) and High Resolution Transmission Electron Microscope (HRTEM). Our study provides a clear insight that the formation of magnesium malonate during the synthesis was due to the reaction between magnesium acetate, oxalic acid and ethanol.

40|$|The initial aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the potential of oxygen releasing compounds as an antimicrobial treatment to reduce the transmission of C. jejuni. C. jejuni was highly sensitive to Mg 02 Ca 02 and 2 Na 2 CO 3 H 202 when exposed to these compounds in Maximum Recovery Diluent (MRD), Ultra Heat Treated (UHT) skimmed milk and soil microcosms. in MRD, initial counts of 1 x 107 colony forming units per ml fell to undetectable levels in 32, 8 and 4 hours in the presence of 0. 26, 2. 6 and 5. 2 mM Mg 02 respectively. The same reduction in viability of C. jejuni was seen within 10 minutes and 30 minutes in the presence of 5. 2 mM, 2. 6 mM and CaO 2 respectively. When C. jejuni cells were exposed to 2. 6 mM -and 5. 2 mM 2 NazCO). 31 -hCh. viable counts fell by 7 -logs in 15 minutes. The survival of C. jejuni when exposed to I-h 02 was similar to that seen with Mg 02 but when catalase was added, Mg 02 had little impact on C. jejuni killing, suggesting that H 20 2 formation via this metal peroxide is important in the killing process. Electron microscope observaltions revealed an irregular cell morphology and loss of cell wall integrity as well as loss of polar flagella.

40|$|Sulfate-reducing {{bacteria}} (SRB), {{which cause}} microbiologically influenced material corrosion under anoxic conditions, form {{one of the}} major groups of microorganisms responsible for the generation of hydrogen sulfide. In this study, which is aimed at reducing the presence of SRB, a novel alternative approach involving the addition of <b>magnesium</b> <b>peroxide</b> (MgO(2)) compounds involving the use of reagent-grade MgO(2) and a commercial product (ORC (TM)) was evaluated as a means of inhibiting SRB in laboratory batch columns. Different concentrations of MgO(2) were added in the columns when black sulfide sediment had appeared in the columns. The experimental results showed that MgO(2) is able to inhibit biogenic sulfide. The number of SRB, the sulfide concentration and the sulfate reducing rate (SRR) were decreased. ORC (TM) as an additive was able to decrease more effectively the concentration of sulfide in water and the SRB-control effect was maintained over a longer time period when ORC (TM) was used. The level of oxidation-reduction potential (ORP), which has a linear relationship to the sulfide/sulfate ratio, is a good indicator of SRB activity. As determined by fluorescence in-situ hybridization (FISH), most SRB growth was inhibited under increasing amounts of added MgO(2). The concentration of sulfide reflected the abundance of the SRB. Utilization of organic matter greater than the theoretical SRB utilization rate indicated that facultative heterotrophs became dominant after MgO(2) was added. The results of this study could supply the useful information for further study on evaluating the solution to biocorrosion problems in practical situations...|$|E

Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references: p. 117 - 118. Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. The increased interest in in situ bioremediation has developed a commensurate increased interest in soil chemical amendments. These amendments increase the level of one or more limiting nutrients in the natural environment. Along with the conventional constituents of interest such as nitrogen and phosphorous, oxygen (02) is an important, often limiting, compound in both flooded and subsurface soils. Chemical formulations were developed to provide oxygen to these anoxic environments. We evaluated, in distilled water, the release rates of four chemical compounds formulated for the slow release of oxygen that may be used to enhance bioremediation. The release rates were determined by polarographic measurement of the 02 concentration over time from sealed batch reactors. The acquired analog data was converted to digital and logged to computer. This research addressed the questions of release rates, oxygen to solid ratios, and probability of migration into the soil. We developed a predictive model for the release of oxygen from these solid additives. The four oxidants were: sodium-percarbonate (Na 2 CO 3 ' 1. 5 H 202) encapsulated in poly(vinyhdene chloride) (PVDC); free sodium-percarbonate crystals; calcium peroxide (CaO 2); and <b>magnesium</b> <b>peroxide</b> (MgO 2). The highest calculated release rate was generated by the unencapsulated Na 2 CO 3 ' 1. 5 H 202 (132 mgl-' hr-'), followed by CaO 2 (3. 2 mgr' hr-'), then the encapsulated Na 2 CO 3 ' 1. 5 H 202 (1. 77 X 10 - 2 mgrl hr-'). The lowest release rate was for M 902 (1. 57 X 10 - 3 mgr' hr-'). The data indicated that M 902 or a niix of M 902 and CaO 2 hold the highest promise for use in saturated surface soil applications...|$|E
40|$|The {{search for}} {{alternative}} water disinfectants to those commonly used, such as chlorine, probably {{began when the}} disadvantages of those disinfectants became known. Soluble disinfectants have short half-lives {{and need to be}} replenished periodically which requires monitoring the determination of appropriate concentrations for waters being treated. This disadvantage may be balanced by the ability to alter dose concentrations of soluble disinfectants to meet changes in demands. Maintenance of a residual disinfectant concentration which can act throughout a water distribution system is another advantage of soluble disinfectants. Disadvantages due to reaction of organic materials include the loss of disinfecting capability, health hazards related to the disinfectant and the potential loss of aesthetic water qualities such as taste, smell and color. The {{purpose of this study was}} to investigate different surface contact disinfectants which, while having an inflexible dose concentration capability and releasing no residual disinfectant concentration, do not require monitoring and do not significantly leach into the waters they contact. Powdered aluminum when mixed with a loamy sand reduces virus concentration 3 - 4 orders of magnitude better than controls while not significantly altering the pH or aluminum concentration of waters that pass through the soil columns. Labeled poliovirus 1 was found to adsorb onto the aluminum surface in batch experiments and undergo degradation or dissociation of the capsid proteins with release of viral fragments and clumps within 76 hours. Freon dispersion of the viral clumps showed the clumps to be non-infective. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of poliovirus 1 incubated with aluminum for 76 hours suggested degradation or dissociation of viral capsid proteins 1, 2 and 3. <b>Magnesium</b> <b>peroxide</b> and magnesium oxide, while effectively inactivating viruses, significantly increase the pH of water which they contact.
