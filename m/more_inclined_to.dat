5|$|As word {{increased}} of Bayh's intentions, {{political scientists}} opined on the detractions of a run. Citing {{the fact that}} his eight years as governor may be nullified by its distance in time and that his visibility in the Senate was low, critics pondered whether moderate voters may be <b>more</b> <b>inclined</b> <b>to</b> line with possible candidate Mark Warner of Virginia. However, this criticism subsided once Warner decided against a run in October 2006.|$|E
5|$|Historian Nancy Bristow {{has argued}} that the pandemic, when {{combined}} with the increasing number of women attending college, contributed to the success of women in the field of nursing. This was {{due in part to the}} failure of medical doctors, who were predominantly men, to contain and prevent the illness. Nursing staff, who were predominantly women, felt <b>more</b> <b>inclined</b> <b>to</b> celebrate the success of their patient care and less inclined to identify the spread of the disease with their own work.|$|E

5|$|Polls {{showed that}} the {{majority}} of the public still disapproved of Truman's decision to relieve MacArthur, and were <b>more</b> <b>inclined</b> <b>to</b> agree with MacArthur than with Bradley or Marshall. Truman's approval rating fell to 23 percent in mid-1951, which was lower than Richard Nixon's low of 25 percent during the Watergate Scandal in 1974, and Lyndon Johnson's of 28 percent at the height of the Vietnam War in 1968. , it remains the lowest Gallup Poll approval rating recorded by any serving president.|$|E
5|$|The {{sea otter}} is diurnal. It has {{a period of}} {{foraging}} and eating in the morning, starting {{about an hour before}} sunrise, then rests or sleeps in mid-day. Foraging resumes for a few hours in the afternoon and subsides before sunset, and a third foraging period may occur around midnight. Females with pups appear to be <b>more</b> <b>inclined</b> <b>to</b> feed at night. Observations of the amount of time a sea otter must spend each day foraging range from 24 to 60%, apparently depending on the availability of food in the area.|$|E
5|$|As {{soon as he}} was set free, Theodore {{returned}} to Thessalonica. Lacking any escort or followers, he disguised himself as a beggar in order to enter the city in secret. There he contacted old supporters and favourites, and organized a conspiracy that soon ousted Manuel and took over the city. As Byzantine custom barred him from re-assuming the imperial office due to his blinding, Theodore installed his son John Komnenos Doukas (r. 1237–44) as emperor (without a coronation ceremony), but remained the real ruler of the empire in his son's name. John himself appears to have been mostly interested in religion, and <b>more</b> <b>inclined</b> <b>to</b> enter a monastery than to become emperor. Theodore had to persuade him that being named emperor was a God-given gift, and that he was indeed the rightful Emperor of the Romans due to his imperial descent.|$|E
40|$|In this paper, the {{traditional}} efficiency basis for employment subsidies to high unemployment regions {{is modified to}} incorporate {{a description of the}} transition to employment. Expectations of employment depend not just on the rate of unemployment but also on job turnover rates; thus unemployed in the high unemployment regions are <b>more</b> <b>incline</b> <b>to</b> migrate. At an observed migration equilibrium, implicit migration costs are higher and expected income lower than they would be in the simple model. This means that the shadow price of a job in the high-unemployment region is lower than in the simple model and less than the wage rate. ...|$|R

This mosque is the one only mosque which uses 6000 tonnes of steel or 70 percent building material during the construction, thus it is known as Masjid Besi. This study found that, this masjid is not one hundred percent based on Islamic architecture because is it <b>more</b> <b>incline</b> <b>to</b> modern design. Therefore, this paper will discuss the design of the Masjid Besi design architecture, by examining the relationship Islamic architectural with other elements influences exist on mosque architecture...|$|R
5|$|In {{the post-war}} period the Mahdi's family became wealthy from cotton {{production}} based on irrigation and migrant laborers, mainly their Baggara followers from Darfur and Kordofan. These western tribes {{had been the}} backbone of the original Mahdist movement. The riverine tribes were <b>more</b> <b>inclined</b> <b>to</b> side with the rival Khatmiyya movement. The government supported Abd al-Rahman in these commercial enterprises. Abd al-Rahman's economic activity, and the resulting wide range of contacts with merchants and owners of pump-schemes for irrigating cotton fields, gave him influence among Sudanese engaged in commerce. As of 1 January 1922 the government suspended payment of allowances to Mahdist notables other than the old and those whose movements were restricted. The allowance of Abd al-Rahman was increased somewhat, but only so that he could support old women and other incapable people whose allowances had been stopped.|$|E
5|$|The {{construction}} of the terminal was opposed by {{the residents of the}} Turtle Bay neighborhood, where it was planned to be located in, as it would have changed the character of their neighborhood. Turtle Bay residents wanted the terminal moved to Grand Central. They also disliked the proposed traffic congestion the new terminal would bring. The MTA contended that its studies had shown that Third Avenue was the only feasible place to put the terminal, and there would have been too great of a concentration of rail lines at Grand Central. It concluded that having the LIRR going to Grand Central would further strain the Lexington Avenue Line. If it were on Third Avenue, passengers would have been <b>more</b> <b>inclined</b> <b>to</b> use the Second Avenue Subway, which was partially under construction at the time. On April 16, 1973, a Federal directive directed New York State to consider expanding and modernizing Grand Central before building the new terminal under Third Avenue.|$|E
5|$|Bohr's {{evidence}} {{came from}} an interpretation of a letter he received from a Soviet friend and scientist in Russia, which he showed to the British security services. He reasoned that the longer the United States and Britain hid their nuclear advancements, Russia would feel increasingly threatened and <b>more</b> <b>inclined</b> <b>to</b> speed up their effort to produce an atomic bomb of their own. With the help of U.S. Supreme Court justice Felix Frankfurter, Bohr met with the President of the United States, Franklin D. Roosevelt, who was initially sympathetic to his ideas about controlling nuclear weapons on 26 August 1944; but Churchill was adamantly opposed to informing the Soviet Union of such work. At the Second Quebec Conference in September 1944, Roosevelt sided with Churchill, deciding {{that it would be}} upon the nation's best interest to keep the atomic bomb project a secret. Moreover, they decided Bohr was potentially dangerous and specific security measures must be made in order to prevent him from leaking information {{to the rest of the}} world, Russia in particular.|$|E

5000|$|The {{troubles}} {{before the}} 2004 coup were seen {{by most of}} the nationwide women's group as a reminder of the 1991-94 coup d’etat tactics with the use of rape, kidnapping and murders as forms of intimidation. If most of the feminist activists in Haiti campaigned for the election of Jean-Bertrand Aristide before his first term (1991-1995), many of them, especially intellectuals like Myriam Merlet or Magalie Marcelin, condemned how the first democraticly elected president of Haiti ruled the country during his second term (2000-2004). Other observers, more favorable of the Fanmi Lavalas party, were <b>more</b> <b>incline</b> <b>to</b> criticised the period after the coup as a “rewind” back to the same dictatorship tactics, [...] "a terror campaign employing rape, murder and disappearance as tactics, and rapidly increasing insecurity undermining all economic activity of the informal sector." ...|$|R

40|$|Although the {{licensing}} phenomenon has gained attention {{over the last}} decades, the role of licensing contracts {{as a source of}} external finance for innovation has been under-investigated by scholars so far. Empirical evidence, instead, suggests that accessing capital is among the most common reasons to out-license. In some circumstances licensors is required to further develop the licensed technology which the licensee may finance by paying an upfront fee. Thus, the need for extra finances may affect the decision of the licensor to negotiate and thus actually agree on a specific form of payment. The aim of our paper is to investigate whether financial constrained licensors are more likely to choose an upfront license and <b>more</b> <b>incline</b> <b>to</b> credit a portion of the initial fee against future royalties to meet their short-term financing needs. We investigate this issue by relying on an original dataset of patent licenses...|$|R
