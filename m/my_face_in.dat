[...] He noted, [...] "I don't really want to play professional football, because there is no privacy and no time to be alone when you're a famous athlete." [...] He emphasized that, if he were ever forced to choose between professional football or studying for the ministry, he would give up football: [...] "I see no reason why I can't do both, but if I have to give up pro ball, I'll certainly do it." [...] Timberlake said the thing he would always remember about playing football was the 20 minutes before kickoff. [...] He recalled that those 20 minutes were [...] "horrible." [...] "You want to go home. [...] You want to quit football. [...] It is times like these when something happens to me. [...] I can't explain it. [...] I put <b>my</b> <b>face</b> <b>in</b> my hands and ask God to come into my heart and give me courage. He gives me peace." ...|$|E
500|$|Since Valene, I’ve {{tried to}} do {{anything}} and everything but play a goody-two-shoes. I love Val, I adore her. But I spent a total of 15 years—if you count the first year I played her on Dallas. That was quite an investment for me as an actress. If you were playing a goody-two-shoes today, the tabloid media would be dying to catch you on a bad day. [...] Look at what they’ve done to Tiger Woods. Look at what they’ve done to that man. My feeling is his father—or the absence of his father in his life—is (the root of) what’s going on with Tiger and that marriage. But the media won’t leave him alone. No matter who you are, (the celebrity coverage) is obsessive and constant. It’s hurtful. For me, if they show <b>my</b> <b>face</b> <b>in</b> a bad photo, they latch into me hook, line and sinker. Even Entertainment Tonight now has blood on their hands. It's brutal. I wonder what they’ll do with Alec Baldwin now. He was my brother on Knots. They really threw him under a bus (when endlessly publicizing his infamous voice-mail rant against daughter Ireland, then 11, in 2007). He loves that child so much." ...|$|E
2500|$|... “It {{was through}} Lord Raneleigh [...] and the painter Frank Miles that I was first {{introduced}} to London society... I went to London and was brought out by my friends. Among the most enthusiastic of these was Mr Frank Miles, the artist. I learned afterwards that he saw me one evening at the theatre, and {{tried in vain to}} discover who I was. He went to his clubs and among his artist friends declaring he had seen a beauty, and he described me to everybody he knew, until one day one of his friends met me and he was duly introduced. Then Mr Miles came and begged me to sit for my portrait. I consented, and when the portrait was finished he sold it to Prince Leopold. From that time I was invited everywhere and made a great deal of by many {{members of the royal family}} and nobility. After Frank Miles I sat for portraits to Millais and Burne-Jones and now Frith is putting <b>my</b> <b>face</b> <b>in</b> one of his great pictures." ...|$|E

60|$|My father said, this morning, when <b>my</b> <b>face</b> was <b>in</b> repose and thoughtful, that I looked {{precisely}} as young Edward Twichell of Hartford {{used to look}} some is months ago--chin, mouth, forehead, expression--everything.|$|R
2500|$|He then {{conducted}} an eight-year {{study of the}} effects of unemployment in local New Haven, Connecticut, and published two works – The Unemployed Worker and Citizens Without Work – in 1940 from that study. [...] Bakke focused not just on the economic characteristics of unemployment but also on the social and psychological consequences and costs from it. [...] As such, Bakke became known for the sensitivity which he brought to this subject. [...] He emphasized the distaste the unemployed often had in applying for government relief, as illustrated by quotes like [...] "I'd rather be dead and buried" [...] and, when another was ultimately compelled to do so, [...] "I would hide <b>my</b> <b>face</b> <b>in</b> the ground and pound the earth." [...] The 2004 Encyclopedia of the Great Depression states that Bakke's New Haven study stands [...] "as a powerful statement of the importance of stable, adequately-paying work opportunities for individual well-being, as well as broader social well-being" [...] and that even given his other contributions to sociology, economics, and industrial relations, [...] "Bakke's study of Depression-era unemployment remains his most influential and far-reaching work." [...] Alice O'Connor, {{a professor of history at}} the University of California, Santa Barbara, wrote in 2010 that, [...] "Seventy years later, the study's analysis still resonates".|$|E

60|$|She took <b>my</b> <b>face</b> <b>in</b> {{her hands}} and pressed a kiss against my forehead....|$|E
60|$|Just {{right for}} her and her purposes! It threw all its light on <b>my</b> <b>face,</b> leaving <b>in</b> gloom the <b>faces</b> of both Pierre and the woman, who sat outside of me on each side.|$|R

60|$|Then I {{could suffer}} my woe no longer. I buried <b>my</b> <b>face</b> <b>in</b> his bosom, {{and burst into}} tears.|$|E
60|$|I hid <b>my</b> <b>face</b> <b>in</b> the soft, {{fragrant}} grass. I {{thought of}} the wasted {{years of my life}} between thirteen and twenty-three.|$|E

60|$|Steinar {{rose to his}} feet, {{staggered}} {{to where}} I lay, {{and stared at me}} stretched there as white as the snow, with a smile upon <b>my</b> <b>face</b> and <b>in</b> <b>my</b> hand a spray of some evergreen bush which I had grasped as I fell.|$|R
60|$|Then I {{was called}} upon, {{and in a}} few brief words {{substantiated}} his story: indeed <b>my</b> <b>face</b> did that <b>in</b> the sight of all men.|$|R
6000|$|I clasped {{my hands}} and hid <b>my</b> <b>face</b> <b>in</b> despair. Oh, the {{bitterness}} of heart with which I heard him say those simple words! ...|$|E

60|$|By {{this time}} I was played out, {{and gave up}} hope. The {{schooner}} was still two hundred feet away. <b>My</b> <b>face</b> was <b>in</b> the water, and I was watching him maneuver for another attempt, when I saw a brown body pass between us. It was Otoo.|$|R
60|$|But strongest of all upon me is what {{is strong}} upon all the company, namely, a sense of {{drifting}} to doom. Our way was like a funeral march. Never did a laugh arise. Never did I hear a happy tone of voice. Neither peace nor ease marched with us. The faces {{of the men and}} youths who outrode the train were grim, set, hopeless. And as we toiled through the lurid dust of sunset often I scanned <b>my</b> father's <b>face</b> <b>in</b> vain quest of some message of cheer. I will not say that <b>my</b> father's <b>face,</b> <b>in</b> all its dusty haggardness, was hopeless. It was dogged, and oh! so grim and anxious, most anxious.|$|R

60|$|She took <b>my</b> <b>face</b> <b>in</b> {{her hands}} and looked into my eyes, saying no word. Then she leaned forward, and very gently touched my {{forehead}} with her lips.|$|E

60|$|At this pulpit, by the window, he {{took his}} seat, and signed to me to kneel. I recited the Confiteor. Thereafter, with <b>my</b> <b>face</b> buried <b>in</b> <b>my</b> hands, my soul writhing in an agony of penitence and shame, I poured out the hideous tale of the evil I had wrought.|$|R
