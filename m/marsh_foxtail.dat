5|$|The drier {{areas of}} the reserve contain {{maritime}} grasses such as sea couch grass and sea poa grass. The reedbeds are dominated by common reed with saltmarsh rush, brackish water crowfoot, sea clubrush and common bulrush also common in the various wetland habitats. The coastal pastures at Cley and the adjacent Salthouse Marshes have jointleaf rush, common silverweed and less common grasses such as annual beard grass, <b>marsh</b> <b>foxtail</b> and slender hare's-ear. The site is generally rich in plants, especially those that can cope with saline environments, but three species {{appear to have been}} lost: divided sedge was last recorded in 1999, grey hair-grass in 1982 and lax-flowered sea lavender in 1977. Lichens are not suited to the prevailing habitat, but the nationally rare soot lichen occurs on untreated wood. The locally rare bryophyte Heim's pottia occurs in the saltmarsh, and the coastal variety piliferum of cuspidate earth-moss is found at Salthouse.|$|E
5|$|The reedbeds, {{the largest}} of which are at the Cley, Salthouse and Titchwell reserves, are {{dominated}} by common reed, and salt marsh rush, brackish water crowfoot, sea clubrush and common bulrush also occur in the various wetland habitats. The coastal pastures at Cley and Salthouse Marshes have jointleaf rush, common silverweed, and less common grasses such as annual beard grass, <b>marsh</b> <b>foxtail,</b> and slender hare's-ear. The flat land just inland from the dunes at Holkham was reclaimed from the marshes by {{the nineteenth century and}} was initially used for grazing. It was made arable during World War II, but the water levels have been raised to make the fields attractive to breeding and wintering birds. The pastures are of international importance for {{the tens of thousands of}} geese and ducks that feed there in the winter months.|$|E
50|$|Grass species include cocksfoot, meadow foxtail, meadow barley, {{and smooth}} brome (Bromus racemosus). There is <b>marsh</b> <b>foxtail</b> in the wetter areas.|$|E
5000|$|Alopecurus geniculatus - Bent <b>foxtail,</b> <b>marsh</b> meadow <b>foxtail</b> - Algeria, Eurasia ...|$|R
50|$|Common bent (Agrostis capillaris), crested dog's-tail (Cynosurus cristatus), {{floating}} sweet grass (Glyceria fluitans), <b>marsh</b> <b>foxtail</b> (Alopecurus geniculatus), purple moor grass (Molinia caerulea), {{red fescue}} (Festuca rubra), sweet vernal grass (Anthoxanthum odoratum).|$|E
50|$|Alopecurus pratensis has {{two common}} relatives, <b>marsh</b> <b>foxtail</b> (Alopecurus geniculatus) and black grass (A. myosuroides). It is often {{confused}} with timothy (Phleum pratense). Timothy flowers later, from June until August. Its spikelets have twin hornlike projections arranged in cylindrical panicles, while meadow foxtail {{has a single}} soft awn.|$|E
50|$|Adder's-tongue Spearwort numbers {{fluctuate}} {{from year to}} year, and depend on the climatic conditions during the autumn germination period. June is the normal flowering period. This wetland site supports {{a number of other}} plants, which include Lesser Spearwort, Common Water-crowfoot, Narrow-leaved Water-plantain, Marsh Speedwell, Pink Water-speedwell, Fen Bedstraw and <b>Marsh</b> <b>Foxtail.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The pools on {{the reserve}} are {{surrounded}} by reedmace, sea club-rush, grey club-rush, soft rush and hard rush. Areas of damp grassland contain <b>marsh</b> <b>foxtail,</b> floating sweet-grass, creeping bent and soft rush. Wild flowers include marsh marigold and fleabane. Whilst wild orchids such as southern marsh orchid {{can be found in}} abundance, bee orchids are also present ...|$|E
50|$|The meadow is {{surrounded}} by rivers, streams and drainage ditches which add to the biological diversity of the site, with many species of bank-side plant present including for slender tufted-sedge (Carex acuta), marsh arrowgrass (Triglochin palustris), and great water-dock (Rumex hydrolapathum), tubular water-dropwort (Oenanthe fistulosa), marsh marigold (Caltha palustris), <b>marsh</b> <b>foxtail</b> (Alopecurus geniculatus), early marsh-orchid (Dactylorhiza incarnata), and brown sedge (Carex disticha).|$|E
50|$|Mud rush, meadow barley, red fescue, <b>marsh</b> <b>foxtail</b> and {{the nationally}} rare bulbous foxtail {{flourish}} in the pasture. There is a variety of saltmarsh plants such as sea arrowgrass, sea milkwort, sea aster, greater sea-spurrey, and lesser sea-spurrey. The rare narrow-leaved marsh dandelions (Taraxacum palustre and T. anglicum) are also recorded. Where areas become marshy grassland other species are found. The drainage ditches support a separate range of plants. The brackish water-crowfoot (Ranunculus baudotii) may {{be found at the}} boundaries of some of the fields.|$|E
50|$|The {{eastern part}} of the {{designated}} area is dominated by wavy hair grass, <b>marsh</b> <b>foxtail</b> and creeping bent. The improved grassland is dominated by perennial rye grass, creeping bent and Timothy. The northern section is mostly marshy and comprises rush and sedge species. The marshes also support bog pimpernel and ragged robin. The ditches are significant as they are examples of a disappearing habitat. A wide range of wetland plants flourish with a large population of flote grass and several pondweeds. There are rarities including tubular water dropwort (Oenanthe fistulosa).|$|E
50|$|The {{site has}} been farmed since Domesday Book in the {{eleventh}} century, {{and it was}} probably part of a high status manor in the Middle Ages. The hedgerows show signs of a ditch and bank next to them, and this together with ancient trees suggests that the hedges and layout of the fields pre-date the late eighteenth-century Enclosure Acts. The landscape has changed little in the last 150 years. The fields are currently managed as neutral hay meadows. The northern field is damp and has plants typical of periodically waterlogged fields, such as creeping bent and <b>marsh</b> <b>foxtail.</b> Mammals on the site include woodmice, field voles and roe deer.|$|E
