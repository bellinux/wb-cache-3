"Time" [...] began {{publication}} {{at midnight}} EDT on March 25, 2013, with the comic's image updating every 30 minutes until March 30, {{when they began}} to change every hour, lasting for over four months. The images constitute time lapse frames of a story, with the <b>mouseover</b> text originally reading [...] "Wait for it.", later changed to [...] "RUN." [...] and changed again to [...] "The end." [...] on July 26. The story began with a male and female character building a sandcastle complex on a beach who then embark on an adventure to learn {{the secrets of the}} sea. On July 26, the comic superimposed a frame (3094) with the phrase [...] "The End". Tasha Robinson of The A.V.

40|$|Graphs {{visualizations}} {{can become}} {{difficult to interpret}} when they fail to highlight patterns. Additionally, the data to be visualized may be hierarchical in nature. Therefore, graphs with hierarchical data need to offer means of telescoping that collapse or expand subgraphs while aggregating their data. In this paper, we demonstrate an interactive hier-archical edge graph on book prerequisite data, which can be generalized {{to a variety of}} hierarchical data. We illus-trate the importance of ordering nodes (when possible) and coloring by various features. We then demonstrate various ways of performing exploratory data analysis by delivering various pieces of information on <b>mouseovers</b> and utilizing telescoping and filtering...|$|R
40|$|Aggregated {{search is}} the task of {{blending}} results from dif-ferent search services, or verticals, into a set of web search results. Aggregated search coherence {{is the extent to}} which results from different sources focus on similar senses of an ambiguous or underspecified query. Prior work investigated the “spill-over ” effect between a set of blended vertical re-sults and the web results. These studies found that users are more likely to interact with the web results when the vertical results are more consistent with the user’s intended query-sense. We extend this prior work by investigating three new research questions: (1) Does the spill-over effect generalize across different verticals? (2) Does the vertical rank mod-erate the level of spill-over? and (3) Does the presence of a border around the vertical results moderate the level of spill-over? We investigate four different verticals (images, news, shopping, and video) and measure spill-over using in-teraction measures associated with varying levels of engage-ment with the web results (bookmarks, clicks, scrolls, and <b>mouseovers).</b> Results from a large-scale crowdsourced study suggest that: (1) The spill-over effect generalizes across ver-ticals, but is stronger for some verticals than others, (2) Vertical rank has a stronger moderating effect for verticals with a mid-level of spill-over, and (3) Including a border around the vertical results has a subtle moderating effect for those verticals with a low level of spill-over...|$|R

5000|$|Rollover {{refers to}} a button created by a web {{developer}} or web designer, found within a web page, used to provide interactivity between the user and the page itself.
