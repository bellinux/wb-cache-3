25|$|The melanocortin 1 {{receptor}} (MC1R), {{also known}} as <b>melanocyte-stimulating</b> <b>hormone</b> receptor (MSHR), melanin-activating peptide receptor, or melanotropin receptor, is a G protein–coupled receptor that binds to a class of pituitary peptide hormones known as the melanocortins, which include adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and the different forms of <b>melanocyte-stimulating</b> <b>hormone</b> (MSH).|$|E
25|$|Addison’s {{disease is}} an {{autoimmune}} disorder {{that affects the}} adrenal cortex such that it is unable to efficiently secrete hormones. The immune system specifically targets {{the cells of the}} adrenal cortex and destroys them, but Addison’s disease can also be caused by a severe infection such as tuberculosis. Some symptoms include hypoglycemia and decreased blood sodium levels and increased blood potassium levels caused by a deficiency of aldosterone. These electrolyte imbalances induce nerve and muscle issues. Other symptoms include fatigue, salt cravings, weight loss, and increased skin pigmentation. Increased skin pigmentation is caused by a deficiency of the adrenocortical hormone hydrocortisone. Its normal behavior would be as negative feedback at the pituitary gland, stimulating the pituitary gland to decrease secretion of corticotropin. Because hydrocortisone is not able to be produced in Addison’s disease, the pituitary gland continues to secrete corticotropin which binds to the receptor for <b>melanocyte-stimulating</b> <b>hormone.</b> It then causes melanocytes to produce more pigment, thus darkening the skin tone.|$|E
25|$|Pharmacotherapy {{research}} for unresectable or metastatic malignant melanoma offers new treatment possibilities. In {{addition to the}} advances with recently approved agents, ongoing research into combination therapy, such as dabrafenib and trametinib, may reveal a more effective and better-tolerated option for patients with metastatic melanoma. One important pathway in melanin synthesis involves the transcription factor MITF. The MITF gene is highly conserved and is found in people, mice, birds, and even fish. MITF production is regulated via a fairly straightforward pathway. UV radiation causes increased expression of transcription factor p53 in keratinocytes, and p53 causes these cells to produce <b>melanocyte-stimulating</b> <b>hormone</b> (MSH), which binds to melanocortin 1 receptors (MC1R) on melanocytes. Ligand-binding at MC1R receptors activates adenylate cyclases, which produce cAMP, which activates CREB, which promote MITF expression. The targets of MITF include p16 (a CDK inhibitor) and Bcl2, a gene essential to melanocyte survival. It {{is often difficult to}} design drugs that interfere with transcription factors, but perhaps new drugs will be discovered that can impede some reaction in the pathway upstream of MITF.|$|E
50|$|Aside from melanotan II and {{endogenous}} <b>melanocyte-stimulating</b> <b>hormones</b> like α-MSH, other analogues of bremelanotide include afamelanotide (NDP-α-MSH), modimelanotide, and setmelanotide.|$|R

50|$|The <b>melanocyte-stimulating</b> <b>hormones,</b> known {{collectively as}} MSH, {{also known as}} melanotropins or intermedins, are a family of peptide hormones and neuropeptides {{consisting}} of α-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (α-MSH), β-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (β-MSH), and γ-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (γ-MSH) that are produced by cells in the intermediate lobe of the pituitary gland.|$|R
2500|$|Males with classic CAH {{generally}} have {{no signs of}} CAH at birth. [...] Some may present with hyperpigmentation, due to co-secretion with <b>melanocyte-stimulating</b> <b>hormone</b> (MSH), and possible penile enlargement. [...] Age of diagnosis of males with CAH varies and depends on the severity of aldosterone deficiency. [...] Boys with salt-wasting disease present early with symptoms of hyponatremia and hypovolemia. [...] Boys with non-salt-wasting disease present later with signs of virilization.|$|E
2500|$|The MC1R protein {{lies within}} the cell membrane, and is signalled by <b>melanocyte-stimulating</b> <b>hormone</b> (MSH) {{released}} by the pituitary gland. [...] When activated {{by one of the}} variants of MSH, typically α-MSH, MC1R initiates a complex signaling cascade that leads to the production of the brown or black pigment eumelanin. In contrast, the receptor can also be antagonized by agouti signalling peptide (ASIP), which reverts the cell back to producing the yellow or red phaeomelanin.|$|E
2500|$|Other signs include {{increased}} urination (and accompanying increased thirst), persistent {{high blood}} pressure (due to cortisol's enhancement of epinephrine's vasoconstrictive effect) and insulin resistance (especially common with ACTH production outside the pituitary), leading to high blood sugar and insulin resistance {{which can lead to}} diabetes mellitus. [...] Insulin resistance is accompanied by skin changes such as acanthosis nigricans in the axilla and around the neck, as well as skin tags in the axilla. Untreated Cushing's syndrome can lead to heart disease and increased mortality. Cortisol can also exhibit mineralocorticoid activity in high concentrations, worsening the hypertension and leading to hypokalemia (common in ectopic ACTH secretion). Furthermore, excessive cortisol may lead to gastrointestinal disturbances, opportunistic infections, and impaired wound healing related to cortisol's suppression of the immune and inflammatory responses. Osteoporosis is also an issue in Cushing's syndrome since osteoblast activity is inhibited. Additionally, Cushing's syndrome may cause sore and aching joints, particularly in the hip, shoulders, and lower back. [...] Cushing’s syndrome includes all the causes of increased cortisol leading to the diseased state. [...] Cushing’s disease is a specific type of Cushing’s syndrome caused by a pituitary tumor leading to excessive production of ACTH (adrenocorticotropic hormone). Excessive ACTH stimulates the adrenal cortex to produce high levels of cortisol, producing the disease state. Cushing's disease due to excess ACTH may also result in hyperpigmentation. This is due to <b>Melanocyte-Stimulating</b> <b>Hormone</b> production as a byproduct of ACTH synthesis from Pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC). Alternatively, it is proposed that the high levels of ACTH, β-lipotropin, and γ-lipotropin, which contain weak MSH function, can act on the melanocortin 1 receptor. A variant of Cushing's disease can be caused by ectopic, i.e. extrapituitary, ACTH production from, for example, a small-cell lung cancer. When Cushing's syndrome is caused by an increase of cortisol {{at the level of the}} adrenal glands (via an adenoma or hyperplasia), negative feedback ultimately reduces ACTH production in the pituitary. In these cases, ACTH levels remain low and no hyperpigmentation develops. [...] While all Cushing’s disease gives Cushing’s syndrome, not all Cushing’s syndrome is due to Cushing’s disease.|$|E

Calcitonin could not be demonstrated in human pituitary under conditions suitable for demonstration of the peptide in thyroid C cells. Weakly positive immunostaining could be obtained only with much increase in antiserum concentration and length of incubation, and higher concentrations of calcitonin were needed to abolish staining in preabsorption studies. It thus appears that the immunoreactive calcitonin in human pituitary differs from that in thyroid C cells. Likewise, we could not demonstrate immunoreactive endorphin in any developmental stage of medullary thyroid carcinoma. Our study suggests that caution should be applied in considering a physiologic role for calcitonin in the pituitary and in postulating a common peptide origin for endorphin and calcitonin in humans...|$|R

40|$|Abstract The {{precursor}} protein, proopiomelanocortin (POMC), produces many {{biologically active peptides}} via {{a series}} of enzymatic steps in a tissue-specific manner, yielding the <b>melanocyte-stimulating</b> <b>hormones</b> (MSHs), corticotrophin (ACTH) and β-endorphin. The MSHs and ACTH bind to the extracellular G-protein coupled melanocortin receptors (MCRs) {{of which there are}} five subtypes. The MC 3 R and MC 4 R show widespread expression in the central nervous system (CNS), whilst there is low level expression of MC 1 R and MC 5 R. In the CNS, cell bodies for POMC are mainly located in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus and the nucleus tractus solitarius of the brainstem. Both of these areas have well defined functions relating to appetite and food intake. Mouse knockouts (ko) for pomc, mc 4 r and mc 3 r all show an obese phenotype, as do humans expressing mutations of POMC and MC 4 R. Recently, human subjects with specific mutations in β-MSH {{have been found to be}} obese too, as have mice with engineered β-endorphin deficiency.

Previous {{studies have shown}} that α-MSH increases sodium excretion and promotes vascular function in rodents, but it is unexplored whether these characteristics of α-MSH could translate into therapeutic benefits in the treatment of hypertension. Therefore, we first assessed the diuretic and natriuretic properties of the stable α-MSH analogue [Nle(4), D-Phe(7) ]-α-MSH (NDP-α-MSH) and investigated whether it has protective effects in deoxycorticosterone acetate (DOCA) -salt hypertensive mice. Adult male C 57 Bl/ 6 N mice were subjected to DOCA-salt treatment and randomized to receive intraperitoneal injections of either saline as vehicle or NDP-α-MSH (0. 3 mg/kg/day for 14 days) starting 7 days after the DOCA-salt treatment. Systemic hemodynamics, serum and urine electrolytes, and oxidative stress markers were assessed in control sham-operated and DOCA-salt mice. NDP-α-MSH elicited marked diuretic and natriuretic responses that were reversible with the MC 3 / 4 receptor antagonist SHU 9119. Chronic NDP-α-MSH treatment attenuated blood pressure elevation in DOCA-salt mice without affecting the blood pressure of normotensive control animals. Owing to the enhanced sodium excretion, NDP-α-MSH-treated mice were protected from DOCA-salt-induced hypernatremia. DOCA-salt treatment mildly increased oxidative stress at the tissue level, but NDP-α-MSH had no significant effects on the oxidative stress markers. In conclusion, treatment with NDP-α-MSH increases urinary sodium excretion and protects against DOCA-salt-induced hypertension. These findings point to the potential future use of α-MSH analogues in the treatment of hypertension...|$|R

The recent detection of immunoreactive POMC-derived peptides in the male reproductive tract raised the possibility that these hormones might regulate reproductive function. To determine whether the low concentrations of POMC-derived peptides in the male reproductive tract are synthesized locally and are not contaminants from blood, we have demonstrated POMC-like gene expression in both testis and epididymis. The identification of cells in testis capable of synthesizing POMC mRNA was established by showing the presence of this mRNA in mouse Leydig cell lines (TM 3 and I 10 A). The hybridizing species of POMC-like mRNA in the testis, epididymis, and Leydig cell lines (TM 3 and I 10 A) were approximately 150 bases shorter than those in the pituitary or hypothalamus but were similar in size to that in the amygdaloid nucleus of rat brain. The concentration of POMC-like mRNA in the testis is almost as high as that in the hypothalamus. This finding is quite unexpected because the concentrations of POMC-derived peptides in the testis were 2 - 3 orders of magnitude lower than those in the hypothalamus. The demonstration of a POMC-like gene expression in male reproductive tissues suggests that POMC-derived peptides are synthesized in Leydig cells and epididymis.

The distribution and binding properties of specific MSH binding sites were determined by autoradiography and image analysis after incubation of frozen tumor tissue sections with a biologically active, radiolabeled analogue of alpha-MSH, [125 I]iodo-Nle 4, D-Phe 7 -alpha-MSH ([125 I]NDP-MSH). In melanoma specimens from 11 patients, 3 showed high levels of specific binding, 5 showed low levels, and in 3 patients specific binding of [125 I]NDP-MSH was not detectable. Specific MSH binding sites were present in melanoma cells, but not in adjacent connective or inflammatory tissues. Melanotropins, including alpha-MSH, NDP-MSH, and ACTH, inhibited [125 I]NDP-MSH binding in a concentration-dependent manner, whereas unrelated peptides (somatostatin and substance P) did not. The apparent affinity of alpha-MSH for this binding site was in the nanomolar range (EC 50 = 2 X 10 (- 9) M for inhibition of [125 I]NDP-MSH binding in situ), similar to that recently described for the murine melanoma receptor.

The major tissue that synthesizes POMC-derived peptides is the pituitary gland, where POMC is proteolytically processed by prohormone convertases (PC) 1 and 2 and by carboxypeptidase E (CPE) to cleave POMC to biologically active ACTH and beta-END. Non-pituitary tissues such as immune cells can also produce beta;-END. Those cells migrate into inflamed tissue where they release opioid peptides and attenuate inflammatory pain by activating opioid receptors on peripheral terminals of sensory neurons. Overall {{knowledge about the}} regulation and production of POMC in immune cells is scarce, especially with respect to cells of the adaptive immune system (lymphocytes). Under naïve/unstimulated conditions, Pomc mRNA expression may be repressed in immune cells. The major questions {{of the present study}} were whether and how Pomc is repressed in lymphocytes under naïve conditions, which cell subsets can be stimulated to express Pomc and whether the post-translational processing involves the same proteolytic enzymes as in the pituitary. To study the regulatory mechanisms of POMC expression and beta-END formation in lymphocytes and their subsets (B and T cells), we used isolated cells from lymph node (LN) tissue of rats with/without hind paw inflammation induced by intraplantar injection of complete Freunds adjuvant (CFA). In conclusion, the present studies suggest that the expression of Pomc and beta-END production in rat lymphocytes involve additional mechanisms to DNA-methylation, that are overcome under certain circumstances as in acute CFA-induced inflammation and IL- 4 stimulation of mixed cell cultures. Although the key factor triggering Pomc mRNA expression in B cells remains unknown, the event seems to be cytokine- and JAK/STAT-dependent. The processing of POMC into beta-END seems to be linked to PC 1. These findings may help to develop strategies for pain therapy by boosting opioid peptide production in immune cells. This might be especially interesting for chronic inflammation. Proopiomelanocortin (POMC) ist der Vorläufer für mehrere Peptidhomone wie z. B.

Immunzellen können ebenfalls &# 946;-END bilden. Solche Zellen wandern in entzündetes Gewebe ein.

Bisher ist das Wissen über Regulation und Produktion von POMC in Immunzellen begrenzt, insbesondere bezüglich Zellen des adaptiven Immunsystems (Lymphozyten). Unter naiven/unstimulierten Bedingungen könnte die Pomc mRNA Expression unterdrückt sein. Die Hauptfragestellung dieser Arbeit ist, ob und wie eine solche Unterdrückung stattfindet, welche Zellsubpopulationen zur Pomc Expression stimuliert werden können und ob an der posttranslationalen Prozessierung dieselben Enzyme wie in der Hypophyse beteiligt sind. Zusammengefasst deuten unsere Ergebnisse darauf hin, dass in die Expression von Pomc in Lymphozyten Faktoren involviert sind, die unter bestimmten Umständen wie z. B. der akuten Entzündung in vivo oder der IL- 4 Stimulation von Zellkulturen in vitro aktiv werden. Obwohl der entscheidende Stimulationsfaktor der Pomc mRNA Expression momentan noch unbekannt ist, scheint diese abhängig von Zytokinen und JAK/STAT zu sein.
