The Musée des arts décoratifs suffered in the World War II bombing raids of 1944 but the building has since been restored and the collections replenished. Besides the furniture and decoration of the cardinals' apartments, the collections focus on the local production of porcelain (Strasbourg faience), silver-gilt, and clockmaking, with original parts of the medieval Strasbourg astronomical clock including the automaton rooster from 1354. The reconstructed living room of a former hôtel particulier, the 1750s Hôtel Oesinger, displays 18th-century furniture in situ on a more intimate scale than the rooms of the palace.|$|E

40|$|Mammary {{carcinoma}} {{is extremely}} rare in cattle {{in spite of}} the demands placed on this organ for commercial milk production, and the fact that cows are allowed to live into the ‘cancer age’. There are only 5 cases reported in the litera-turel- 4. 6, most originating in the ductal system. Carcinoma has not been reported from the mammary gland of the water buffalo. The intraductal carcinoma of the udder of an aged female water buffalo described herein is the first report of a mammary carcinoma in this species. Material and Methods In the course of examining over 6800 female buffaloes at the Bareilly and Calcutta <b>municipal</b> <b>slaughterhouses</b> during the period from June to December, 1968, 325 quarters from 300 udders were collected. All the slaughtered animals were in the age group of 8 to 12 years, and were normal on routine ante-mortem examination. Pieces of mammary glands were fixed in neutral 10 % formol-saline, embedded in paraffin, and sectioned at 5 to 6,u thick. Stains used were haematoxy-lin-eosin, Mallory’s aniline blue method for collagen, MacCallum-Goodpasture’s and Ziehl-Neelsen’s acid-fast techniques for microorganisms, and Ozzello’s 5 mo-dification of the periodic acid-Schiff technique (PAS) for integrity of basement membrane. Findings Of the 325 quarters, 164 were normal and one (sp. No. 272 / 68) contained an intraductal carcinoma. This was a shrunken, atrophied, left hindquarter with a solid mass, 5 cm in diameter, palpable in the parenchyma underneath the skin. The cut surface of this mass revealed multiple greyish dots resembling areas of suppuration with induration of the surrounding structures. On slight pressure, the materials from these greyish areas exuded as a series of worm-like casts. at PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIV on September 15, 2016 vet. sagepub. comDownloaded fro...|$|R

40|$|Activated sludge (AS) plays {{a crucial}} role in the {{treatment}} of domestic and industrial wastewater. AS is a biocenosis of microorganisms capable of degrading various pollutants, including organic compounds, toxicants and xenobiotics. We performed 16 S rRNA gene sequencing of AS and incoming sewage in three wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) responsible for processing sewage with different origins: <b>municipal</b> wastewater, <b>slaughterhouse</b> wastewater, and refinery sewage. In contrast to incoming wastewater, the taxonomic structure of AS biocenosis was found to become stable in time, and each WWTP demonstrated a unique taxonomic pattern. Most pathogenic microorganisms (Streptococcus, Trichococcus, etc.) and inductors of AS bulking and flocculation (Comamonadaceae, Flavobacteriaceae, etc.), which are abundantly represented in incoming sewage, were significantly decreased in AS of all WWTPs, except for the slaughterhouse wastewater, which was rich in organic matter. Here we present a novel approach enabling the prediction of the metabolic potential of bacterial communities based on their taxonomic structures and MetaCyc database data. We developed a software application, XeDetect, to implement this approach. Using XeDetect, we found that the metabolic potential of the three bacterial communities clearly reflected the substrate composition. We revealed that the microorganisms responsible for AS flocculation and bulking (abundant in AS of slaughterhouse wastewater) played a leading role in the degradation of substrates such as fatty acids, amino acids, and other bioorganic compounds. Moreover, we discovered that the chemical, rather than the bacterial composition of the incoming wastewater was the main factor in AS structure formation. XeDetect (freely available: [URL] represents a novel powerful tool for the analysis of the metabolic capacity of bacterial communities.

40|$|Class 1 integrons are mobile gene {{elements}} (MGEs) containing qacEΔ 1 {{that are}} resistant to quaternary ammonium compound (QAC) disinfectants. This study compared the abundances of class 1 integrons and antiseptic resistance genes in municipal (M) and swine slaughterhouse (S) wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) and investigated the presence of class 1 integrons and antiseptic resistance genes in methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) isolated from wastewater samples. The abundances of intI 1 and qacEΔ 1 genes in 96 wastewater samples were quantified using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (real-time qPCR), and 113 MRSA isolates recovered from the wastewater samples were detected class 1 integrons and linked antiseptic resistance genes (qacEΔ 1), and minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) for QAC antiseptics. The intI 1 and qacEΔ 1 genes were detected in all the wastewater samples, and they were more abundant in S-WWTP samples than in M-WWTP samples. A higher percentage of MRSA isolates carried qacEΔ 1 in MRSA from swine wastewater samples (62. 8 %) than in municipal MRSA (3. 7 %). All the MRSA isolates showed high MICs for antiseptic agents. This study provides important evidence regarding the abundances of intI 1 and qacEΔ 1 genes in <b>municipal</b> and swine <b>slaughterhouse</b> wastewater, and antiseptic-resistant MRSA strains were detected in swine slaughterhouse wastewater...|$|R
40|$|La evolución de la salud pública en España durante el siglo XIX se puede dividir en tres etapas bien diferenciadas. En la primera (1812 - 1833), el reinado de Fernando VII impidió el desarrollo de los postulados liberales: «la autonomía de los ayuntamientos {{en materia}} de higiene y salud pública». La segunda (1833 - 1873) se caracteriza por el desarrollo legislativo de la organización sanitaria española. Como consecuencia de este nuevo marco legislativo, y en el contexto del higienismo («la desigualdad social como origen de la enfermedad»), aparecen las figuras de los sanitarios locales (facultativos titulares) contratados por los ayuntamientos para encargarse de la asistencia médica de los pobres (médico titular), de la asistencia farmacéutica de los pobres (farmacéutico titular) y de la inspección sanitaria de la carne de los mataderos (veterinario titular). La tercera (1873 - 1904) viene con el {{principio}} de una nueva era (la microbiología) y el inicio del método científico. La microbiología impulsa por todo el Estado la creación de los Laboratorios Municipales, y sienta las bases que darán origen, a principios del siglo XX, a la creación de los Cuerpos Sanitarios de Medicina, Farmacia y Veterinaria con una estructura organizativa bien definida y unas atribuciones más amplias. The evolution {{of public health}} in Spain during the 19 th century {{can be divided into}} three stages. In the first stage (1812 - 1833), the reign of Fernando VII prevented the development of the liberal postulates: «the autonomy of the city councils in the matter of hygiene and public health». The second stage (1833 - 1873), was characterized by the legislative development of sanitary organization in Spain. As a result of this new legislative framework, and in the context of social hygiene («social inequality as the origin of disease»), the figures of municipal health professionals appeared, engaged by the city councils {{to be in charge of}} the medical assistance of the poor (municipal physician), of the pharmaceutical assistance of the poor (municipal pharmacist), and of the health inspection of meat from the <b>slaughterhouses</b> (<b>municipal</b> veterinarian). The third stage (1873 - 1904), marked the beginning of a new age (microbiology) and the beginning of the scientific method. Microbiology prompted the creation of municipal laboratories throughout the state and laid the foundations for the creation of the Healthcare Services of Medicine, Pharmacy and Veterinary Science at the beginning of the xx century.
