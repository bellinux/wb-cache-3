5|$|Returning to Australia in 1938, Hewitt was {{appointed}} senior air staff officer at RAAF Station Richmond, New South Wales, and by July that year had been promoted wing commander. In May 1939, {{he was chosen}} to lead No.10 Squadron, due to be formed on 1July at the recently established RAAF Station Rathmines, near Lake Macquarie. Hewitt was preparing to depart for England to take delivery of the unit's planned complement of Short Sunderland flying boats when he broke his neck riding his <b>motor</b> <b>cycle</b> near Richmond, and had to forgo the assignment while he recovered. Fit for duty by August, he was given command of the Rathmines base to manage the deployment of No.10 Squadron and its aircraft, but this was suspended due to the outbreak of World WarII in September, and the Sunderlands and their RAAF crews remained in Britain for service alongside the RAF.|$|E

The fictional character Tom Swift, who first appeared in 1910 in Tom Swift and His <b>Motor</b> <b>Cycle</b> and Tom Swift and His Airship, has been {{said to have been}} based on Glenn Curtiss.

25|$|In {{an article}} in <b>Motor</b> <b>Cycle</b> {{magazine}} in 1914, Alfred Scott wrote that {{he was drawn to}} the two-stroke engine because he was trained on high speed steam and marine engines, and when turning his attention to gas and petrol engines the regular power strokes of the two-stroke (or Day cycle as he sometimes called it), seemed preferable to the one power stroke in four of the Otto cycle. He said this attraction to the two stroke was further enhanced by the reliable and excellent service from a two stroke engine designed by his brother (A. F. Scott M.I.M.E) and used to drive machinery in his experimental workshop.|$|E
25|$|Also {{competed for}} were the £500 Abdulla Prize, {{donated by the}} Abdulla Tobacco Co. for the {{greatest}} speed over two laps of the same circuit and £150 each from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders and the British Cycle and <b>Motor</b> <b>Cycle</b> Manufacturers and Trade Unions for {{the greatest number of}} completed circuits during the whole competition. Sir Charles Wakefield of Wakefield Oil (Castrol) offered £100 for the machine that attained the greatest altitude. These were large sums of money at a time when £80 would buy a sailplane in Germany. The object of the competition was to produce a motor glider that cost no more than £100.|$|E
25|$|In autumn 1903 Childers {{travelled}} to the United States {{as part of}} {{a reciprocal}} visit between the Honourable Artillery Company of London and the Ancient and Honorable Artillery Company of Massachusetts of Boston. At the end of the official visit he elected to remain and explore New England on a hired <b>motor</b> <b>cycle.</b> One day by chance the machine broke down outside the Beacon Hill home of Dr Hamilton Osgood, a prominent physician in the city. Childers diffidently knocked to borrow a spanner and was invited in for dinner and introduced to Dr Osgood's younger daughter, Mary ("Molly") Alden Osgood. The well-read republican heiress and Childers found each other congenial company. Dr Osgood organised the rest of Childers's stay, with much time shared with Molly, and the pair were married at Boston's Trinity Church on 5 January 1904.|$|E
