5|$|Joust is an arcade game {{developed}} by Williams Electronics and released in 1982. While {{not the first}} game to feature two-player cooperative play, Joust was <b>more</b> <b>successful</b> <b>than</b> its predecessors and popularized the concept. The player uses a button and joystick to control a knight riding a flying ostrich. The object is to progress through levels by defeating groups of enemy knights riding buzzards.|$|E

5|$|The second {{marriage}} of Shaftesbury was <b>more</b> <b>successful</b> <b>than</b> the first, producing two children.

5|$|Bjørnebye's {{experiences}} as a Reds' player in the 1994–95 season under the management of Roy Evans, were markedly <b>more</b> <b>successful</b> <b>than</b> that of previous campaigns. He gained a regular place in the senior team, supplanting the left back position from Julian Dicks, and featured in the 2–1 win against Bolton Wanderers in {{the final of the}} 1995 League Cup Final on 2 April 1995. Subsequent injury, a broken leg sustained on 5 April 1995 in a 3–1 win match against Southampton, terminated his season and he was replaced by Steve Harkness.|$|E

5|$|Flann {{was chosen}} as the High King of Ireland, also known as King of Tara, {{following}} the death of his first cousin and stepfather Áed Findliath on 20 November 879. Flann's reign followed the usual pattern of Irish High Kings, beginning by levying hostages and tribute from Leinster and then to wars with Munster, Ulster and Connacht. Flann was <b>more</b> <b>successful</b> <b>than</b> most kings of Ireland. However, rather than the military and diplomatic successes of his reign, it is his propaganda statements, in the form of monumental high crosses naming him and his father, as kings of Ireland, that are exceptional.|$|E
5|$|Georgia Tech's first {{possession}} of the half was slightly <b>more</b> <b>successful</b> <b>than</b> Wake Forest's, as the Yellow Jackets drove inside the Deacons' 30-yard line on several passes from Reggie Ball. Again, however, the Tech defense stumbled. Facing a fourth down inside the Wake Forest red zone, Tech elected to attempt to convert the first down rather than punt the ball. Despite needing just one yard to gain another first down, Georgia Tech was stopped short of the line. The play {{was typical of the}} third quarter, which saw both teams fail to score.|$|E
5|$|In the Giro di Lombardia, Astana's final {{race of the}} season, {{they were}} <b>more</b> <b>successful</b> <b>than</b> they had been most of the season, {{attaining}} a fourth podium finish in a one-day race on the year.

5|$|Once Sega {{left the}} {{hardware}} market, other companies {{began to take}} {{up some of the}} franchises, including Crazy Taxi. Acclaim brought the game to the PlayStation 2 on May 21, 2001 and GameCube on November 18, 2001, while Activision and Strangelite ported the game to the PC in 2002; only the PlayStation 2 port was <b>more</b> <b>successful</b> <b>than</b> the Dreamcast version, and the rest didn't do as well. The Dreamcast version of Crazy Taxi was also playable through emulation via Gametap on PC systems.|$|E
5|$|Stanford {{returned}} the game's opening kickoff to its 24-yard line, where the Cardinal offense began the game's first possession. On the game's first play, Stanford quarterback Andrew Luck ran 11yards through the Virginia Tech defense {{for a first}} down. The success was short-lived, however, as Stanford's next three plays did not gain enough ground for another first down, and the team punted from its 37-yard line. Virginia Tech's first possession was no <b>more</b> <b>successful</b> <b>than</b> Stanford's had been. The Hokies' offense entered the game at its 31-yard line after the punt, but went three-and-out after failing to gain a first down.|$|E
5|$|The Fox Terrier {{has been}} <b>more</b> <b>successful</b> <b>than</b> any other breed at the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show, with four Best in Show titles {{going to the}} Smooth Fox Terrier and {{fourteen}} titles going to the Wire Fox Terrier.

In the UK, at Crufts, the Smooth Fox Terrier has not won any Best in Show titles, while the Wire Fox Terrier has won on three occasions.|$|E
50|$|Emmerich next helmed the 1994 science-fiction film Stargate. At the time, it set {{a record}} for the highest-grossing opening weekend for a film {{released}} {{in the month of}} October.

5|$|A {{little over}} {{ten years after the}} first US edition ceased, a new version appeared, again as a {{companion}} to F. This time the magazine was quarterly. The debut issue was dated May 1969, and it was edited by Edward L. Ferman—son of Joseph Ferman—who was also the editor of F. There was no statement of editorial intent for this version, but the policy was straightforward: a novel was presented in each issue. Although these were substantially cut, they still took up most of the magazine, with the result that the other stories tended to be very short. As in the first incarnation, the contents were of fairly good quality, with contributions from well-known writers. However, the magazine was no <b>more</b> <b>successful</b> <b>than</b> before, and lasted for only six quarterly issues; the last issue was August 1970.|$|E
5|$|Carr {{returned}} to Ace Books in 1984 {{as a freelance}} editor, launching {{a new series of}} Ace Specials devoted entirely to first novels. This series was even <b>more</b> <b>successful</b> <b>than</b> the first: it included, in 1984 alone, William Gibson's Neuromancer, Kim Stanley Robinson's The Wild Shore, Lucius Shepard's Green Eyes, and Michael Swanwick's In the Drift. All were first novels by authors now regarded as major figures in the sf genre. Other prominent sf publishing figures who have worked at Ace include Tom Doherty, who left to start Tor Books, and Jim Baen, who left to work at Tor and who eventually founded Baen Books. Writers who have worked at Ace include Frederik Pohl and Ellen Kushner.|$|E
5|$|During {{his stay}} in Mercia Wilfrid acted as bishop {{with the consent}} of King Æthelred. Information on Wilfrid's life at this time is meagre, as the Vita Sancti Wilfrithi says little of this period. He is {{generally}} considered to have been Bishop of Leicester until about 706, when he is held to have been transferred to Hexham. Wilfrid became involved in the missionary efforts to the Frisians, which he had started in 678 during his stay in Frisia. Wilfrid helped the missionary efforts of Willibrord, which were <b>more</b> <b>successful</b> <b>than</b> his own earlier attempts. Willibrord was a monk of Ripon who was also a native of Northumbria.|$|E

5|$|Following Virginia Tech's post-touchown kickoff, NC State {{began its}} second {{possession}} of the game at its 24-yard line after a short kick return. The NC State's second drive of the game was <b>more</b> <b>successful</b> <b>than</b> its first, but as before, the Wolfpack offense {{ground to a halt}} before penetrating too deeply into Tech territory, and State was forced to punt the ball back to Virginia Tech. The Hokie offense began work at its eight-yard line but went three and out and prepared to punt the ball back to NC State. Tech punter Tony Romero, kicking from the Tech goal line, had his kick blocked by State defender Derrick Taylor. The ball rolled into the Virginia Tech end zone and was recovered by an NC State's Brian Bulluck for a touchdown. The play and extra point tied the game at 77.|$|E
5|$|Following his {{resignation}} in 1926 to allow Margaret Bondfield {{to take a}} seat in Parliament, Hastings returned to {{his work as a}} barrister, and was even <b>more</b> <b>successful</b> <b>than</b> before his entry into the House of Commons. His cases included the Savidge Inquiry and the Royal Mail Case, and before his full retirement in 1948 {{he was one of the}} highest paid barristers at the English Bar. As well as his legal work, Hastings also tried his hand at writing plays. Although these had a mixed reception, The River was made into a silent film in 1927 named The Notorious Lady. Following strokes in 1948 and 1949, his activities became heavily restricted, and he died at home on 26 February 1952.|$|E
5|$|Gugelmin {{signed with}} Dick Simon Racing {{to take part}} in the North American Champ Car racing series for the last three races of 1993. Although races at Mid Ohio and Nazareth {{resulted}} in non-finishes, Gugelmin finished 13th at Laguna Seca although this was not high enough to receive any points. Despite this, Gugelmin demonstrated promise. In 1994, Gugelmin signed with Chip Ganassi Racing to partner Michael Andretti who returned to the series after a season in Formula One. Andretti was <b>more</b> <b>successful</b> <b>than</b> Gugelmin, and took two wins, including Reynard's first win in Champ Car at Surfers Paradise. Gugelmin was hindered by a lack of cooperation between his and Andretti's crews, and his first full-time year in the Champ Car World Series resulted in seven points finishes and 16th in the points standings.|$|E
