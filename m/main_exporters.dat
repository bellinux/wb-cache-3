Related factors are the fact that Asia's population and area are several times that of North America.

Until 2014, Moroccan authorities, who were content to see their own jihadis leave and add to the pressure on Bashar al-Assad, mostly turned a blind eye to networks of recruitment. Since the dramatic rise of the so-called Islamic State, or ISIS, concern over local repercussions and the return of war-hardened radicals has prompted Rabat to adopt a hardline, security-oriented approach instead. Repression, however, is unlikely to uproot these networks. Instead, a comprehensive strategy for de-radicalization should aim to rehabilitate and reintegrate returning fighters, and use their example to dissuade others from violent militancy.

Exports of high-end products are shown to be less sensitive to distance than other products, and found more sensitive to destination coun-try wealth than other products, but only in relation to countries already producing a large range of luxury brands...|$|E
