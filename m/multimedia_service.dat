30|$|This paper {{deals with}} dynamic voltage and {{frequency}} scaling (DVFS) in mobile <b>multimedia</b> <b>services.</b> The <b>multimedia</b> <b>services</b> that consume {{a large amount of}} energy cannot be continuously used in mobile devices because of battery limitation. The DVFS has been applied to <b>multimedia</b> <b>services</b> in previous studies. However, they have only addressed the issue of power saving and overlooked the fact that mobile <b>multimedia</b> <b>services</b> are sensitive to delays. The proposed method is intended to apply DVFS to <b>multimedia</b> <b>services</b> considering potential delays. Another problem with previous studies is that either separate devices have been employed or appropriate frequency scaling values have been determined through complicated calculation processes to apply DVFS to <b>multimedia</b> <b>services.</b> On the contrary, the proposed method determines appropriate frequency scaling values using the characteristics of multimedia contents without employing any separate devices or undergoing complicated calculation processes. This has the advantage of allowing DVFS to be applied to real-time multimedia content. The present paper proposes a DVFS application method that divides <b>multimedia</b> <b>services</b> into video conferences, which are real-time services, and video streaming, which is a non-real-time service, and that reduces energy consumption in a simple manner while considering the constraints of service delays.|$|R

40|$|With GPRS and UMTS {{networks}} lunched, wireless <b>multimedia</b> <b>services</b> are commercially {{becoming the}} most attractive applications next to voice. Because {{of the nature of}} bursty, packet-switched schemes and multiple data rates, the traditional Erlang approach and Poisson models for characterising voice-centric services traffic are not suitable for studying wireless <b>multimedia</b> <b>services</b> traffic. Therefore, research on the characterisation of wireless <b>multimedia</b> <b>services</b> traffic is very challenging. The typical reference for the study of wireless <b>multimedia</b> <b>services</b> traffic is wired Internet services traffic. However, because of the differences in network protocol, bandwidth, and QoS requirements between wired and wireless services, their traffic characterisations may not be similar.
