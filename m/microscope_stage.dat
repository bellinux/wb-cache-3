50|$|The {{experimental}} set-up is simple: the sample to be characterized is deposited by usual deposit {{techniques such as}} dip-coating, spin-coating, deposit pipette, evaporation… on a surf instead of the traditional microscope slide. The support is then placed on the <b>microscope</b> <b>stage.</b>|$|E
50|$|When viewed under a {{microscope}} in plane polarized light, skaergaardite appears to be bright creamy white (in the presence of bornite or chalcopyrite) or bright white (in the presence of digenite or chalcocite). When the mineral is rotated on the <b>microscope</b> <b>stage</b> its color does not change, indicating that it is non-pleochroic.|$|E
50|$|Before {{a sample}} can be scanned, the {{microscope}} {{has to be}} brought close to the sample. This is achieved by a coarse approach stage driven by a brushed DC motor encased in a pressurised vacuum bellows. This motor drives a spindle which in turn raises or lowers a wheel placed in a spring-loaded wedge, {{as shown in the}} diagram. This allows the entire <b>microscope</b> <b>stage</b> to be moved by about 0.5 mm.|$|E

5000|$|Microscope slides {{are often}} used {{together}} with a cover slip or cover glass, a smaller and thinner sheet of glass that is placed over the specimen. Slides are held in place on the <b>microscope's</b> <b>stage</b> by slide clips, slide clamps or a cross-table {{which is used to}} achieve precise, remote movement of the slide upon the <b>microscope's</b> <b>stage</b> (such as in an automated / computer operated system, or where touching the slide with fingers is inappropriate either due to the risk of contamination or lack of precision) ...|$|R
50|$|Projection lamps {{are used}} in motion-picture and slide {{projectors}} for homes and small office or school use. The compact size of the halogen lamp permits a reasonable size for portable projectors, although heat-absorbing filters must be placed between the lamp and the film to prevent melting. Halogen lamps are sometimes used for inspection lights and <b>microscope</b> <b>stage</b> illuminators. Halogen lamps were used for early flat-screen LCD backlighting, but other types of lamps are now used.|$|E
50|$|The {{sample is}} {{prepared}} on a microscope slide which {{is placed on}} the <b>microscope</b> <b>stage.</b> Once the sample has been focused on, then an image can be acquired and displayed on the monitor. If it is a digital camera or a frame grabber is present, the image can now be saved in digital format, and image processing algorithms can be used to isolate particles in the field of view and measure them.|$|E
50|$|According to Wesner and Miller (1986), {{instrument}} myopia {{is promoted}} when the viewing is with one eye, when {{the field of}} view is small, and when the luminance is low, concluding that these are consistent with accommodation's going towards a person's dark focus, which is about one meter from the eyes.Wesner and Miller also said it is possible that a person's knowledge that the viewed object is very close (on the <b>microscope</b> <b>stage)</b> contributes to instrument myopia. They said that instrument myopia is minimised by using a binocular microscope that forces the person's vergence angle to be small.|$|E
50|$|A cover slip, {{coverslip}} {{or cover}} glass {{is a thin}} flat piece of transparent material, usually square or rectangular, about 20 mm (4/5 in) wide and {{a fraction of a}} millimetre thick, that is placed over objects for viewing with a microscope. The object is usually held between the cover slip and a somewhat thicker microscope slide, which rests on the <b>microscope's</b> <b>stage</b> or slide holder and provides the physical support for the object and slip.|$|R

40|$|Key words: sample stage; {{structural}} dynamic observation; SEM Abstract: At present, {{the structural}} dynamic observation by {{scanning electron microscope}} (SEM) has a wide range application in the research and production of materials. In this scheme, the sample stages with the function of stretching, compressing, bending and twisting samples are designed by reforming the construction of scanning electron <b>microscope</b> sample <b>stage.</b> Specifically, the aim of conducting structural dynamic observation is achieved by installing different mechanical clamping devices on the scanning electron <b>microscope</b> sample <b>stage</b> base.

50|$|Undulose {{extinction}} or undulatory extinction is a geological term {{referring to}} the type of extinction that occurs in certain minerals when examined in thin section under cross polarized light. As the <b>microscope</b> <b>stage</b> is rotated, individual mineral grains appear black when the polarization due to the mineral prevents any light from passing through. If a mineral is deformed plastically by dislocation processes without recovery, strain builds up within the crystal lattice causing it to warp. This means that different parts of a crystal reach extinction at slightly different angles, giving the crystal an irregular, mottled look.|$|E
50|$|Micromanipulators {{are usually}} used in {{conjunction}} with microscopes. Depending on the application, one or more micromanipulators may be fitted to a <b>microscope</b> <b>stage</b> or rigidly mounted to a bench next to a microscope. A typical application of micromanipulation is human intracytoplasmic sperm injection. Here, a spermatozoon measuring some 3 to 5 micrometres across is injected into an oocyte of approximately 100 micrometres in diameter, under the direct manual control of an embryologist. A disposable glass micropipette is fitted to a toolholder mounted on the output of the manipulator. The toolholder can be adjusted for different sized tools as well as the angle at which the tool is held.|$|E
50|$|Under the {{microscope}} the spherulites are of circular outline and {{are composed of}} thin divergent fibers that are crystalline as verified with polarized light. Between crossed Nicols, a black cross appears in the spherulite; its axes are usually perpendicular {{to one another and}} parallel to the crosshairs; as the <b>microscope</b> <b>stage</b> is rotated the cross remains steady; between the black arms there are four bright sectors. This shows that the spherulite consists of radiate, doubly refracting fibers that have a straight extinction; the arms of the black cross correspond to those fibers that are extinguished. The aggregate is too fine-grained to directly determine what minerals it is composed of using visible light microscopy.|$|E
30|$|Embryos were {{obtained}} from mass spawning. Eggs were collected 30  min after the light was switched on and rinsed in aquarium water. Embryos were inspected under an inverted <b>microscope</b> and <b>staged</b> according to Kimmel et al. [47].|$|R
30|$|The {{depth of}} field for the 32 × {{magnification}} of our microscope used to acquire individual mosaic images is only several μ m. Small errors in defining {{the plane of the}} sample to be imaged can lead to acquiring out-of-focus images. Additionally, unpolished sections may contain topography outside of the depth-of-field that the user wishes to record in a single image. Transmitted light imaging for thin sections, ∼ 30 μ m thick, can show different features depending on what depth in the section is in focus. For these reasons it is frequently useful to acquire a “focus stack” of images at each point in the plane of the <b>microscope’s</b> <b>stage.</b> A focus stack combines the in-focus parts of a number of images captured at different focal plane depths into one image.|$|R
30|$|At {{each point}} in {{the plane of the}} <b>microscope’s</b> <b>stage,</b> in {{addition}} to focus-stacking as described above, we acquire a range of images with different values of exposure compensation, typically − 2, − 1, 0, + 1, and + 2 eV. We use exposure blending as employed by enfuse to merge the best-exposed (not too dark and not too bright) parts of these individual images together into one well-exposed image. A single field of view in a meteorite thin section can contain metal grains (very bright in reflected light) and fine-grained matrix (very dark in reflected light). A single digital image capture will saturate the pixels in either or both the metal (recorded as pixel value = 255, 255, 255) and matrix (recorded as pixel value = 0, 0, 0), whereas an exposure-fused image will record information in both these constituents.|$|R
5000|$|In optical mineralogy, a {{petrographic}} microscope and cross-polarised light {{are often}} used to view the interference pattern. The thin section containing the mineral to be investigated {{is placed on the}} <b>microscope</b> <b>stage,</b> above one linear polariser, but with a second (the [...] "analyser") between the objective lens and the eyepiece. The microscope's condenser is brought up close underneath the specimen to produce a wide divergence of polarised rays through a small point, and light intensity increased as much as possible (e.g., turning up the bulb and opening the diaphragm). A high power objective lens is typically used. This both maximises the solid angle subtended by the lens, and hence the angular variation of the light intercepted, and also increases the likelihood that only a single crystal will be viewed at any given time.|$|E
5000|$|In 1962, Richard Williams, a {{physical}} chemist working at RCA Laboratories, started seeking new physical phenomena that might yield a display technology without vacuum tubes. Aware {{of the long}} line of research involving nematic liquid crystals, he started experimenting with the compound p-azoxyanisole which has a melting point of 115 C. Williams set up his experiments on a heated <b>microscope</b> <b>stage,</b> placing samples between transparent tin-oxide electrodes on glass plates held at 125 C. He discovered that a very strong electrical field applied across the stack would cause striped patterns to form. These were later termed [...] "Williams domains". The required field was about 1,000 volts per centimeter, far too high for a practical device. Realizing that development would be lengthy, he turned the research over to physicist George Heilmeier and moved on to other work.|$|E
5000|$|For {{position}} control {{in more than}} one direction, multiple linear stages may be used together. A [...] "two-axis" [...] or [...] "X-Y" [...] stage can be assembled from two linear stages, one mounted to the platform of the other such that the axis of motion of the second stage is perpendicular to that of the first. A two-axis stage with which many people are familiar is a <b>microscope</b> <b>stage,</b> used to position a slide under a lens. A [...] "three-axis" [...] or [...] "X-Y-Z" [...] stage is composed of three linear stages mounted to each other (often with the use of an additional angle bracket) such that the axes of motion of all stages are orthogonal. Some two-axis and three-axis stages are integrated designs rather than being assembled from separate single-axis stages. Some multiple-axis stages also include rotary or tilt elements such as rotary stages or positioning goniometers. By combining linear and rotary elements in various ways, four-axis, five-axis, and six-axis stages are also possible.|$|E

40|$|These deposits, in Pennsylvanian {{limestone}} and shale, contain barite, fluorite, low-silver galena with "J-type " lead, and quartz, {{and only}} minor amounts of other minerals.

The main stages of hypogene mineralization are: 1) sphalerite, pyrite, galena and chalcopyrite; 2) five easily recog-nizable substages of fluorite with intermittent quartz and barite; and 3) late calcite.

50|$|Like {{conventional}} lenses, macro lenses need light, and ideally {{would provide}} similar # to conventional lenses to provide similar exposure times. Macro lenses also have similar focal lengths, so the entrance pupil diameter {{is comparable to}} that of conventional lenses (e.g., a 100 mm 2.8 lens has a 100 mm/2.8 = 35.7 mm entrance-pupil diameter). Because they focus at close subjects, the cone of light from a subject point to the entrance pupil is relatively obtuse (a relatively high subject numerical aperture to use microscopy terms), making the depth of field extraordinarily small. This makes it essential to focus critically on {{the most important part of}} the subject, as elements that are even a millimetre closer or farther from the focal plane might be noticeably blurred. Due to this, the use of a <b>microscope</b> <b>stage</b> is highly recommended for precise focus with large magnification such as photographing skin cells. Alternatively, more shots of the same subject can be made with slightly different focusing lengths and joined afterwards with specialized focus stacking software which picks out the sharpest parts of every image, artificially increasing depth of field.|$|E
40|$|We {{describe}} {{a novel approach}} for creating virtual slides that incorporates the positioning accuracy of the <b>microscope</b> <b>stage</b> in the optimization step. To capture a complete slide in microscopy, {{a large number of}} fields of view have to be acquired by moving the <b>microscope</b> <b>stage</b> in a controlled way. These fields of view are aligned {{in such a way that}} a globally consistent virtual slide is formed. However, depending on the positioning repeatability of the stage and the accuracy of the stage calibration, this results in alignment errors. These errors are usually resolved by applying a mosaicing algorithm. Our algorithm extends known mosaicing approaches by analyzing the positioning accuracy of the stage and incorporating this knowledge to make the mosaicing process more robust...|$|E
