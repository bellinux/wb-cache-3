50|$|In {{addition}} to acknowledging increased socio-cultural contextualization and diversification of text-types, multiliteracies pedagogies also {{enable us to}} critically frame and reconceptualize traditional notions of writing, calling into question issues of authority, authorship, power, and knowledge. Domingo, Jewitt, & Kress (2014) address these concepts through a study of template designs on websites and blogs that empowers the readers through non-linear readings paths, with the <b>modular</b> <b>layout</b> allowing them {{to choose their own}} reading paths.

40|$|Web pages such as {{news and}} {{shopping}} sites often use <b>modular</b> <b>layouts.</b> When used effectively this practice allows authors to present clearly {{large amounts of}} information in a single page. However, while sighted people can visually parse and understand these complex layouts in seconds, current assistive technologies such as screen readers cannot. This puts visually impaired users at a great disadvantage. In order to design better assistive technologies, we conducted a study of how people interpret <b>modular</b> <b>layouts</b> of news and shopping Web pages. The study revealed that when the layout complexity increases, the interpretation process gets longer and the reading gets more varied. Also, before looking at the main content, users first frame the Web page by looking for familiar structural elements {{that can be used}} as references and entry points. These elements include navigational bars, search boxes, and ads.

40|$|Abstract. Effective {{visualization}} {{is critical}} to developing, analyzing, and optimizing distributed systems. We have developed OverView, a tool for online/offline distributed systems visualization, that enables <b>modular</b> <b>layout</b> mechanisms, so that different distributed system high-level programming abstractions such as actors or processes can be visualized in intuitive ways. OverView uses by default a hierarchical concentric layout that distinguishes entities from containers allowing migration patterns triggered by adaptive middleware to be visualized. In this paper, we develop a force-directed layout strategy that connects entities according to their communication patterns in order to directly exhibit the application communication topologies. In force-directed visualization, entities ’ locations are encoded with different colors to illustrate load balancing. We compare these layouts using quantitative metrics including communication to entity ratio, applied on common distributed application topologies. We conclude that modular visualization is necessary to effectively visualize distributed systems since no layout is best for all applications. ...|$|E

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2013 Behavioral {{performance}} often suffers when {{attention is}} divided across multiple visual items. These results {{are supported by}} fMRI experiments showing reduced responses during divided attention, relative to focused attention, in primary visual cortex. However, a subset of behavioral research on divided attention suggests {{that the costs of}} dividing attention are dependent on task complexity and stimulus type. For example, costs are typically minimal when searching for a constant target that is defined by simple features such as orientation or contrast. Here we show fMRI evidence in humans that shows no cost of dividing attention in a task that incorporates simple search, on responses in primary visual cortex. Observers determined whether or not a vertically oriented low-contrast Gabor patch was present within one or four relevant locations. All four locations were always occupied by horizontally oriented Gabor pedestals, and the probability of a target being present was independent across trials and locations. Only the number of relevant locations varied across conditions. We found that the BOLD signal measured from human V 1 was not reduced by divided attention when the task and stimuli are simple, suggesting that neural processing of simple features in primary visual cortex has unlimited capacity, corroborating a recent finding in monkeys (Chen and Seidemann, 2012). Multiple visual tasks can be performed on the same visual input, with different tasks presumably engaging different neuronal populations. The <b>modular</b> <b>layout</b> of the visual system implies that specific cortical regions carry more information about certain stimulus attributes than others. Thus, {{it is reasonable to assume}} that decisions during a task will be optimal if they are based on the responses of the most informative neuronal signals, which presumably originate in regions with the sharpest tuning for the relevant stimulus feature. Previous studies have supported this position. Here we present the results of two fMRI experiments that confirm these findings and expand on earlier investigations by addressing the effects of the physical properties of an attended stimulus on task-related modulations in human visual cortex. Specifically, we ask whether performing two-alternative forced choice speed- and color-discrimination tasks (and other attentional processes) can modulate neural activity independent of visual stimulation, and whether the effect of spatial attention depends on which task is being performed. The results indicate that, (1) when stimulation and spatial attention are constant, responses in V 4 and MT+ depend on the task being performed, and are independent of the tested physical properties of the selected stimulus, (2) this task-dependent modulation might require a stimulus - task-specific preparatory mechanisms alone are not sufficient to drive responses, and (3) independent of which task is being performed, spatial attention adds a baseline shift to responses in MT+ and V 4 when a stimulus is present...|$|E
40|$|Redox cycling is a {{powerful}} tool for the electrical detection of chemical electrode reactions. Owing to repeated analyte oxidation and reduction, this technique enables extremely sensitive and highly selective identification of redox-active molecules. Further benefits are provided when implementing the principle of redox cycling in nanoporous devices. Here, a thin non-conducting layer separates two individually addressable electrodes. One of these electrodes faces the analyte containing medium directly, while the other one can be accessed through apertures within the first electrode and the spacing layer. Due to the <b>modular</b> <b>layout</b> according sensors are strongly coupled to the reservoir. Additionally, the lateral sensor's dimensions can freely be chosen during fabrication. Within this work, three major contributions are made regarding the detailed understanding, the convenient fabrication, and the comprehensive theoretical analysis of nanoporous dual-electrode sensors. First, the fundamental characteristics of redox cycling in nanopores are investigated. To this purpose, a sensor-chip holding an array of 32 dual-microelectrodes is fabricated. Each of the sensors features up to 209, 000 nanopores with radii of 50 nm and interpore distances of 200 nm. The efficiency for electrochemical sensing is proven by screening a concentration range of three orders of magnitude. The densely integrated pores and the close electrode spacing of about 100 nm lead to per-area sensitivities of up to 9 mA/mM cm 2. Furthermore, as supported by numerical in-depth analyses, every parameter involved in the redox cycling process leaves a unique footprint in the current recorded at the sensor. Consequently, the specific nanoporous geometry allows detailed studies on the heterogeneous electron transfer reactions of an analyte. In this context, a highly asymmetric transfer coefficient is revealed for the Fc(MeOH) 20 / 1 +-couple. As a second part of this work, a dual-electrode sensor is presented that is based on nanoporous alumina membranes. Novel processing steps are developed to enable high-throughput fabrication. These steps include a selective passivation of structured electrode surfaces by polymers and processes for the selective etching of titania. Combining the techniques with the on-chip anodization of aluminum films, large-area nanoporous redox cycling sensors are fabricated on the wafer scale. Eventually, each of the sensors comprises more than one billion pores on a basal area of 9 mm 2. With interpore distances of approximately 100 nm and pore radii of 20 nm sensitivities of up to 330 µA/mM are reached. Furthermore, the specific coupling of the extended nanopore array is found to have a direct impact on the redox cycling currents of analytes, such as the Fe(CN) 64 -/ 3 [...] couple, which feature distinct diffusion coefficients for the reduced and the oxidized species. The issue of accurately simulating nanopatterned redox cycling sensors is addressed in the third part of this work. To describe effects similar to those investigated at the microelectrode sensor, an according model has to represent the detailed nano-geometry of a patterned interface. As shown by the large-area alumina sensor, however, the model must additionally include the coupling between a sensor and its surrounding volume. To this end, a novel approach is developed that can quickly and precisely calculate a sensor's comprehensive behavior. While other methods might even fail to predict basic current characteristics, errors of the presented approach are commonly below the percentage range...|$|E
40|$|The Apartment Construction Cost Demonstration Project was an {{innovative}} and collaborative partnership between Renewal SA {{and the private}} development sector to investigate contemporary design and construction approaches to minimise building costs. Following a public expression of interest process run by Renewal SA in mid- 2014, multiaward-winning firm Mossop Construction + Interiors was appointed as the builder partner and leading Adelaide architectural firm Studio Nine {{was chosen as the}} design team leader.  Consistent with State Government urban planning policy, identifying more cost effective construction methodologies for multi-storey residential buildings supports higher urban density and urban infill within the middle ring suburbs. Industry and Renewal SA experience shows that typical apartment construction rates make it challenging to recover construction costs from the selling prices supported by the market outside of the CBD, near CBD locations, beachfront and other selected high amenity nodes within metropolitan Adelaide. Typical apartment construction rates are often more than double the cost per square metre of a two-storey detached home. Analysis by Renewal SA indicated that a total project construction cost between $ 1800 and $ 2000 per m² (GST inclusive) would need to be achieved to ensure commercially viable apartment developments of four storeys. This became the target construction cost range for the project which compares favourably to historical apartment build costs between $ 2400 and more than $ 3000 per m² (GST inclusive). The demonstration project highlights the exciting potential for cost savings and improved design outcomes through early and ongoing collaboration between the design team and the builder. The preferred construction system determined by the project team was a combination of an insulated concrete form (ICF) product for the external and internal walls and a pre-cast concrete floor cassette system for the floors. The system achieved the target cost per square metre rate, with a market-tested price of $ 1974 per m 2 (GST inclusive) or $ 1795 per m 2 (GST exclusive) for the demonstration project. It {{is important to note that}} depending on market conditions and supplier relationships, pricing can vary. Indeed, the project revealed a plethora of new materials and emerging systems continually coming to market. Ultimately, the most cost effective system will depend on the developer’s specific apartment design. Based on the project team’s experience, adopting some or all of the following principles were found to be effective in reducing construction costs for the demonstration project: 	<b>Modular</b> <b>layout</b> with straight and aligned walls on a grid pattern at span widths of the structural/ flooring systems 	Reducing the volume of material by designing all load-bearing walls to the ground (using direct load paths) to avoid secondary framing 	Co-location of services to allow floors to be easily ‘stacked’ 	Optimal spans of around three metres to allow a wider choice of materials and to reduce waste during construction 	Designing all bedrooms, kitchens and bathrooms to be of similar size and layout to maximise replication and reduce costs 	Rationalise room orientation to have direct light and ventilation 	Easy fire compartmentalisation 	Compact common areas (which will also reduce community corporation costs) 	Moving wet areas to external walls of apartments to minimise noise-reduction costs 	Reduced building footprint 	No roof plant 	Prefabrication such as bathroom pods, pre-built internal and external walls, and floors. Summing up: this report does not propose a single solution to every building cost challenge. Rather, it demonstrates a logical step-by-step process whereby developers can assess options in terms of design, material selection, construction methodology, site influences and building layout.

The tonal layout of sonata form has frequently been described by theorists, and involves a motion from the tonic to a secondary key in the exposition, answered by a return and solidification of the tonic later in the piece (usually in the recapitulation). The rhetorical form, on the other hand, concerns the manner in which themes, textures, and musical ideas are presented; it [...] "includes personalized factors of design and ad hoc expression: <b>modular</b> and textural <b>layout,</b> selection and arrangement of musical topics, varieties of structural punctuation, and so on." [...] A key consideration of the theory in this regard is the rotational layout of the usual sonata design. An exposition usually presents a number of differing musical ideas in a specific order. Later sections of the piece (such as the development, recapitulation, and coda) usually revisit these ideas in the same order—though not necessarily touching on every one—as if rotating through a pre-set sequence, like hours on a clock or channels on a television dial.|$|R
40|$|As {{with any}} large {{software}} project, {{the first priority}} of this thesis is program correctness in the GPSS compiler and correct simulation statistics. Several distinct processes are gone through {{in the construction of}} any compiler/simulator: development of specifications, indication of the goals, design, implementation, evaluation, and maintenance. The specifications of the GPSS compiler/simulator were introduced in the thesis proposal. The VAX/VMS 11 / 750 will be the machine which this GPSS compiler/simulator uses because of the supported 2 ̆ 7 C language, a Command Language Definition Utility, and accessibility by this author. The implementation language, 2 ̆ 7 C, was chosen based on ease of readability, ease of understanding, the simple but powerful data structures in the language, and the language 2 ̆ 7 s support of modularization. Three milestones were identified for this thesis project: the parser, the pseudo code generator, and the simulator. Many projects are started with only the end product in mind, but the goals which were identified constitute essential checkpoints to validate the integrity of the compiler/simulator. There were three distinct design phases due to the milestone identification. The parser design encompassed the initial <b>modular</b> design <b>layout</b> of the source code for the entire compiler, and the design of the symbol table. Design of the pseudo code language had two constraints imposed: the ease of representation of the GPSS language in twoaddress code and the ease of integration of the pseudo language into the parser. Last but by no means unimportant was the design of the simulator, which controls the order of events within a model. After each design phase described above was completed, the implementation or writing of the source code was accomplished. The parser, the pseudo code generator, and the simulator carried through the 2 ̆ 7 C capabilities of modularization and readability. Evaluation of the compiler was accomplished at three points: after the implementation of the parser, after the implementation of the pseudo code generator, and after the implementation of the simulator. The milestones or checkpoints specified in the identification of goals were essential in verifying the integrity of the system. Although maintenance is not a part of this thesis, the design phase took into consideration the ease of adding functionality to the implemented subset of GPSS. This compiler/simulator {{could be used as a}} base from which a more sophisticated and current version of the GPSS language would immerge...|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} divided into two chapters, each {{consisting}} of materials from independent journal papers that addresses the issue of order batching in fulfillment centers which utilize the modular order picking areas. ^ In chapter one, an order batching framework designed for the modular picking area is proposed. A modular picking area is a unique picking layout; originally designed for the fulfillment of store orders. Each module is essentially a picking zone where a take-away belt is accessible at any point. In addition, each module has permanently assigned pickers who operate as a team to simultaneously fulfill a common batch of orders. The proposed framework utilizes a distance discriminator procedure to determine orders’ batching priority and to aid picks to picker assignment. The performance measures of interest are TPacked, which represents the system throughput and; MaxSlot, which gauges the congestion of the packaging chutes. Simulation results indicate that the proposed framework has an impact on the system throughput and is highly influenced by the interaction between order selection rule and batch size. The relationship between the two factors are identified and summarized. The main contribution of this chapter is the proposal of the order batching framework which take into consideration of the <b>modular</b> picking <b>layout.</b> ^ In chapter two, a customer order is considered as complete only if it is shipped out. Thus, a new dimension namely the orders to outbound freights assignment is introduced. Four order selection rules, namely R 1, R 2, R 3 and R 4, that consider picking efficiencies as well as orders to freights assignment, are proposed. These rules are evaluated by their performance on the total number of orders picked, TP, and the total number of orders shipped, TS. Experimental results confirm that both R 1 and R 2, the single dimension rules, produced polarized performances. On the other hand, R 3, the weighted approach produced mixed performance. The overall performance of R 4 closely resembles the performance of R 3. In addition, freight arrival schedules, batch sizes, weight ratios, lengths of lead windows as well as interactions among these factors have significant impact on the rules’ performances. This chapter has two contributions. First is the creation of the order selection rules which take into consideration the outbound freight patterns. The results gained from investigating the outbound freight patterns and its effects on the performance measures is the second contribution. ...|$|R
