5|$|Some {{species of}} anurans {{hybridize}} readily. For instance, the edible frog (Pelophylax esculentus) is a hybrid between the pool frog (P. lessonae) and the <b>marsh</b> <b>frog</b> (P. ridibundus). The fire-bellied toads Bombina bombina and B. variegata {{are similar in}} forming hybrids. These are less fertile than their parents, giving rise to a hybrid zone where the hybrids are prevalent.|$|E
5|$|The woodland's {{position}} on the transition zone between the wheatbelt and the jarrah forest determines amphibian populations, with several species existing at the eastern or western limits of their range. Herpetofauna includes the western <b>marsh</b> <b>frog</b> (or golden flecked burrowing frog, Heleioporus barycragus) which is generally restricted to the western Darling Range. There are at least 98 species of bird in the woodland, including the almost flightless malleefowl (Leipoa ocellata).|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was the {{experimental}} determination of the maximum limit of temperature in which <b>marsh</b> <b>frogs</b> (P. ridibundus) from thermal water habitats can still survive. For the experiment ten <b>marsh</b> <b>frogs</b> captured from the nonhibernating population from 1 Mai Spa were used. During the experiment we had determined for each frog the value of two parameters: VTMax and CTMax. Following the experiment we did not identify significant differences regarding the thermoresistance of the studied frogs. Thus VTMax had a mean value of 33. 9 °C and CTMax had the mean value of 36. 7 °C...|$|R
25|$|The <b>marsh</b> <b>frog</b> (Pelophylax ridibundus, a {{non-native}} species introduced from Europe in the 1930s) is now {{commonly found}} in the upper Mole and its tributaries around Newdigate and Gatwick. There {{is no evidence that}} the presence of the frogs has had a deleterious effect on indigenous amphibians. A second non-native species, the edible frog (Pelophylax kl. esculentus) was introduced to a site at Newdigate in the early 1900s. It has in 2008 been recorded in tributaries of the River Mole at Capel and Brockham.|$|E
25|$|The {{island is}} home to a variety of reptiles. The Balkan terrapin (Mauremys rivulata) can be found near fresh water along with the Greek <b>marsh</b> <b>frog</b> (Pelophylax kurtmuelleri), though this habitat is slowly disappearing due to development. The Balkan wall lizard (Podarcis taurica) is seen {{regularly}} in daylight in warm weather and the Hemidactylus turcicus at night. A larger lizard is the Balkan green lizard (Lacerta trilineata). Several varieties of snakes can be observed: the Montpellier snake (Malpolon monspessulanus), the leopard snake (Elephe situla), the large whip snake (Coluber jugularis), the grass snake (Natrix natrix), and a species of viper.|$|E
25|$|Most {{amphibians}} of the Loire {{are found}} in the slow flow areas near the delta, especially in the floodplain, marshes and oxbows. They are dominated by the fire salamander (Salamandra salamandra), frogs and toads. The toads include Bufo bufo, Alytes obstetricans, Bombina variegata, Bufo calamita, Pelobates fuscus and Pelobates cultripes. The frogs are represented by the Parsley frog (Pelodites punctatus), European tree frog (Hyla arborea), Common Frog (Rana temporaria), Agile Frog (R. dalmatina), Edible Frog (R. esculenta), Perez's Frog (R. perezi), <b>marsh</b> <b>frog</b> (R. ridubunda) and Pool Frog (R. lessonae). Newts of the Loire include the Marbled Newt (Triturus marmoratus), Smooth Newt (T. vulgaris), Alpine Newt (T. alpestris) and Palmate Newt (T. helveticus).|$|E

40|$|We used {{molecular}} {{methods and}} population genetic analyses {{to study the}} effects of chronic contaminant exposure in <b>marsh</b> <b>frogs</b> from Sumgayit, Azerbaijan. <b>Marsh</b> <b>frogs</b> inhabiting wetlands in Sumgayit are exposed to complex mixtures of chemical contaminants, including petroleum products, pesticides, heavy metals, and many other industrial chemicals. Previous results documented elevated estimates of genetic damage in <b>marsh</b> <b>frogs</b> from the two most heavily contaminated sites. Based on mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) control region sequence data, the Sumgayit region has reduced levels of genetic diversity, likely due to environmental degradation. The Sumgayit region also acts as an ecological sink, with levels of gene flow into the region exceeding gene flow out of the region. Additionally, localized mtDNA heteroplasmy and diversity patterns suggest {{that one of the most}} severely contaminated sites in Sumgayit is acting as a source of new mutations resulting from an increased mutation rate. This study provides an integrated method for assessing the cumulative population impacts of chronic contaminant exposure by studying both population genetic and evolutionary effects.

25|$|Three Sites of Special Scientific Interest {{lie within}} the parish: Lewes Downs, Lewes Brooks and Southerham Works Pit. Lewes Downs is {{a site of}} {{biological}} interest, an isolated area of the South Downs. Lewes Brooks, also of biological importance, {{is part of the}} floodplain of the River Ouse, providing a habitat for many invertebrates such as water beetles and snails. Southerham Works Pit is of geological interest, a disused chalk pit displaying a wide variety of fossilised fish remains. The Railway Land nature reserve is {{on the east side of}} the town next to the Ouse, and contains an area of woodland and marshes, which now includes the Heart of Reeds, a sculpted reed bed designed by local land artist Chris Drury. The Winterbourne stream, a tributary of the Ouse, flows through it. This stream flows most winters and dries up in the summer, hence its name. It continues through Lewes going through the Grange Gardens and often travelling underground. The Heart of Reeds is one of the sites in East Sussex and Kent home to the <b>marsh</b> <b>frog,</b> an introduced species. It is popular with pond-dippers and walkers. A centre for the study of environmental change is due to be built at the entrance to the nature reserve.|$|E
500|$|Many {{species of}} frog have deep calls. The croak of the American {{bullfrog}} (Rana catesbiana) is sometimes written as [...] "jug o' rum". The Pacific tree frog (Pseudacris regilla) produces the onomatopoeic [...] "ribbit" [...] often heard in films. Other renderings of frog calls into speech include [...] "brekekekex koax koax", {{the call of}} the <b>marsh</b> <b>frog</b> (Pelophylax ridibundus) in The Frogs, an Ancient Greek comic drama by Aristophanes.|$|E
500|$|In the wet tropics, the Pacific blue-eye {{is mostly}} found in streams flowing up to [...] per second, or rarely [...] per second. Within fast-flowing areas, it shelters {{in areas of}} slower-moving water—less than [...] per second—sometimes in {{the lower half of}} the water column or in the lee of {{underwater}} rocks. Further south in southeastern Queensland it is mostly found in water flowing more slowly than [...] per second. It can also be found in tidal pools that become isolated from rivers at low tide. The Pacific blue-eye also forages in mangroves; a field study in the waters around Hinchinbrook Island and near Ingham on mainland Queensland nearby found that the species entered mangroves with the incoming tide as soon as the water was deep enough to swim in but left again an hour later as they kept to areas of shallow water. A field study in two lakes polluted by coal mine runoff in central Queensland found that the Pacific blue-eye was more resistant than tadpoles of the striped <b>marsh</b> <b>frog</b> (Limnodynastes peronii) to adverse health effects. The fish species did not suffer acutely but showed markers of compromised health in the long term.|$|E

40|$|Nucleotide {{sequences}} {{of the control}} region of the mitochondrial DNA of invasive mosquitofish from the highly contaminated industrial city of Sumgayit, Azerbaijan were compared to invasive mosquitofish from pristine sites in Europe and Azerbaijan and to native North American populations. All European and Azerbaijan fish had haplotypes indicative of Gambusia holbrooki which is native to the eastern United States. Persistent heteroplasmy for a hyper-mutable simple sequence repeat was observed in all invasive populations, as well as low haplotype and nucleotide diversities. However, the city of Sumgayit was unique in possessing four de novo haplotypes and heteroplasmic conditions, only {{one of which was}} found in a nearby population. It is concluded that Sumgayit is a mutational hotspot and the cause of the mutations are exposure to legacy contaminants from chemical factories that were mainly operating during the era of the Soviet Union. Sumgayit was also observed to be the site of new mutations in a previous study of <b>marsh</b> <b>frogs</b> (Rana ridibunda), but it is not an ecological sink for mosquitofish {{as was the case with}} <b>marsh</b> <b>frogs.</b> All of the observed variable nucleotide positions were located within or adjacent to a cytosine mononucleotide repeat. This repeat was predicted to be within a conserved secondary structure in both G. affinis and G. holbrooki and it is concluded that this region undergoes expansion and contraction at a rate sufficient to prevent fixation of the common 1 - 3 heteroplasmy. Whereas the 1 - 3 heteroplasmy appeared coincident with the establishment of mosquitofish in Europe, the other forms of heteroplasmy result from contaminant-induced de novo mutations. Native populations of both species of mosquitofish possess the mononucleotide repeat but lack the persistent heteroplasmy. This study builds on a long-term program that has shown Sumgayit to contain ponds and wetlands with high levels of a diversity of chemical contaminants including mercury, PAHs, organochlorine pesticides and PCBs. Previous contaminant and biomarker studies of turtles (Emys orbicularis and Mauremys caspica) and <b>marsh</b> <b>frogs</b> have shown a correlation between somatic chromosomal damage and chemical contaminants. This study shows that an invasive species which arrived in Azerbaijan about the time of the establishment of the industrial city of Sumgayit has a pattern of genetic impacts similar to a native species taken from the same ponds. This confirms that the pattern is not the result of historical events such as glacial cycles, but is rather associated with recent chemical contamination. ...|$|R
50|$|Super-numerary {{chromosome}} numbers can be unstable, {{which can}} lead to instability in the genetics of the hybrid. The European edible frog appears to be a species, but is actually triploid semi-permanent hybrids between pool <b>frogs</b> and <b>marsh</b> <b>frogs.</b> In most populations, the edible frog population is dependent on the presence of {{at least one of the}} parents species to be maintained as each individual need two gene sets from one parent species and one from the other. Also, the male sex determination gene in the hybrids is only found in the genome of the pool frog, further undermining stability. Such instability can also lead to rapid reduction of chromosome numbers, creating reproductive barriers and thus allowing speciation.|$|R
