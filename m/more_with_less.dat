5|$|The {{origins of}} the {{hurricane}} were from a tropical wave that exited the west African coast on September7. It moved rapidly westward, developing into a tropical depression on September11 about 800miles (1300km) east of the Windward Islands. It was one of seven active tropical cyclones in the Atlantic basin that day, {{one of the most}} active single days on record. It existed at a fairly low latitude and failed to intensify due to the unfavorable combination of Hurricane Ginger and a long trough to its northwest. On September 13, the depression passed just south of Barbados and subsequently entered the Caribbean Sea. Interacting with the terrain of South America, the center became broad and ill-defined, although Curaçao reported winds of near tropical storm force as it crossed the island on September 16. It later moved near or over northern Venezuela and Colombia. As it approached the western Caribbean, the depression was able to organize <b>more,</b> <b>with</b> <b>less</b> influence from landmass or the trough to its north. At 0000 UTC on September 17, it is estimated the depression attained tropical storm status; that day, it was named Irene about 350 miles (560 km) east of San Andrés. Initially, the storm was expected to track west-northwestward toward the northwest Caribbean, similar to the track taken by the destructive Hurricane Edith two weeks prior.|$|E

Kathy Iandoli of HipHopDX criticized Carey's vocals, writing: [...] "An attempted whistle-tone {{at the close of}} 'H.A.T.E.U.' doesn't necessarily indicate that Carey’s pipes are rusting, but perhaps she's succeeding <b>more</b> <b>with</b> <b>less</b> blustery vocals these days".|$|E

[...] Among Tigert's many significant reforms, he decentralized the university budget {{to the level}} of the individual academic colleges, allowing them to set their own spending priorities. [...] The University Council, composed of the president, the registrar and the college deans, retained final approval authority.

500|$|In {{his other}} works he experimented <b>more</b> <b>with</b> <b>less</b> {{traditional}} approaches to reality, so that [...] "the most frightful, {{the most unusual}} things are told with the deadpan expression". A commonly cited example is the physical and spiritual ascending into heaven of a character while she is hanging the laundry out to dry in One Hundred Years of Solitude. The style of these works fits in the [...] "marvellous realm" [...] described by the Cuban writer Alejo Carpentier and was labeled as magical realism. Literary critic Michael Bell proposes an alternative understanding for García Márquez's style, as the category magic realism is criticized for being dichotomizing and exoticizing, [...] "what is really at stake is a psychological suppleness which is able to inhabit unsentimentally the daytime world while remaining open to the promptings of those domains which modern culture has, by its own inner logic, necessarily marginalised or repressed." [...] García Márquez and his friend Plinio Apuleyo Mendoza discuss his work in a similar way,"The way you treat reality in your books ... has been called magical realism. I have the feeling your European readers are usually aware of the magic of your stories but fail to see the reality behind it ..." [...] "This is surely because their rationalism prevents them seeing that reality isn't limited {{to the price of}} tomatoes and eggs." ...|$|E

2500|$|A {{different}} {{application of}} the cognitive biology category is manifest in the 2009 publication of papers presented at a three-day interdisciplinary workshop on “The New Cognitive Sciences” held at the Konrad Lorenz Institute for Evolution and Cognition Research in 2006. The papers were listed under four headings, each representing a different domain of requisite cognitive ability: (i) space, (ii) qualities and objects, (iii) numbers and probabilities, and (iv) social entities. The workshop papers examined topics ranging from “Animals as Natural Geometers” and “Color Generalization by Birds” through “Evolutionary Biology of Limited Attention” and “A comparative Perspective on the Origin of Numerical Thinking” as well as “Neuroethology of Attention in Primates” and ten <b>more</b> <b>with</b> <b>less</b> colorful titles. “n {{the last day of}} the workshop the participants agreed [...] the title ‘Cognitive Biology’ sounded like a potential candidate to capture the merging of the cognitive and the life sciences that the workshop aimed at representing.” Thus the publication of Tommasi, et al.

2500|$|In 1927 Fuller {{resolved}} to think independently {{which included a}} commitment to [...] "the search for the principles governing the universe and help advance the evolution of humanity in accordance with them... finding ways of doing <b>more</b> <b>with</b> <b>less</b> to the end that all people everywhere can have more and more." [...] By 1928, Fuller was living in Greenwich Village and spending {{much of his time}} at the popular café Romany Marie's, [...] "Only two years before, on the brink of suicide, Fuller had decided to remake his life and the world. Why not begin on Minetta Street? In 1929, he was shopping around his first major design, plans for an inexpensive, modular home that others air-lift right where desired. Now, in exchange for meals, he took on the interior decoration and chairs for Marie's new location. He must have stood out in person, too, ever the talkative, handsome visionary in tie and starched collar." [...] See also: }} where he had spent an evening in conversation with Marie and Eugene O'Neill several years earlier. Fuller accepted a job decorating the interior of the café in exchange for meals, giving informal lectures several times a week, and models of the Dymaxion house were exhibited at the café. Isamu Noguchi arrived during 1929—Constantin Brâncuși, an old friend of Marie's, had directed him there—and Noguchi and Fuller were soon collaborating on several projects, including the modeling of the Dymaxion car based on recent work by Aurel Persu. It was the beginning of their lifelong friendship.|$|E
2500|$|Tyler {{composed}} {{several other}} new themes for the film, {{to represent the}} titular villain Ultron; the relationship that develops between Black Widow and the Hulk; and the new Avenger Vision. Tyler wanted Ultron's theme to sound [...] "almost heroic", since Ultron thinks he is saving the world, [...] "but dissonant and tweaky enough" [...] to reflect that [...] "he doesn't quite have it right" [...] and is still a villain. The melody is simple {{so that it is}} easy to remember, but starts flat by one note to make the theme sound slightly [...] "off", is played on two pianos with one of them out of tune, and when the main phrase is repeated the last note is played [...] "ahead by a beat" [...] the second time; [...] "not only out of tune, but out of time." [...] The theme also features an artificially distorted guitar to give it a machine-like tone. Tyler described the Black Widow/Hulk relationship as an [...] "unrequited romance and this kind of sad situation" [...] with [...] "the curse of the Hulk being a barrier between [...] and what they really want. And so that melody, that had to be almost like a lullaby, but broken." [...] Tyler wrote the [...] "lullaby" [...] to be understated, and it is often played on piano or cello. For the Vision's theme, Tyler [...] "wanted to go for something that was underneath and delicate, and had kind of a wispy nature to it, in a sense—and almost towards the romantic". He tried to reflect the character's role as a messianic figure of sorts, and Ultron's intended redemption for Earth, and said, [...] "you don’t really know what side he’s on. You have this guy who’s literally two minutes old and is born in this movie with this knowledge of humanity. It’s Machiavellian in a way." [...] The theme is an adagio that is [...] "not your typical bombast, look how muscley this guy is; it’s more of a mystery." [...] To represent the character's youth and questions about himself, it features string glissandos that constantly change between chords during his introduction, and often momentarily settle on uncertain notes and sounds. Tyler constantly instructed the orchestra to play quieter, [...] "trying to say <b>more</b> <b>with</b> <b>less</b> for Vision". The music for the visions that the Scarlet Witch gives the Avengers pays homage to scores from the 1950s, with Tyler using a [...] "randomly played" [...] vibraphone and strings such as a harp to create a [...] "dreaminess" [...] and [...] "hypnotic effect".|$|E

60|$|It {{seems that}} the only means by which in these modern times we are {{permitted}} to develop the beautiful is music. It would appear definitively settled that excellence in the plastic arts is the privilege of the earlier ages of the world. All that is now produced in this respect is mimetic, and, at the best, the skilful adaptation of traditional methods. The creative faculty of modern man seems by an irresistible law {{at work on the}} virgin soil of science, daily increasing by its inventions our command over nature, and multiplying the material happiness of man. But the happiness of man is not merely material. Were it not for music, we might in these days say, the beautiful is dead. Music seems to be the only means of creating the beautiful, in which we not only equal, but in all probability greatly excel, the ancients. The music of modern Europe ranks with the transcendent creations of human genius; the poetry, the statues, the temples, of Greece. It produces and represents as they did whatever is most beautiful in the spirit of man and often expresses what is most profound. And who are the great composers, who hereafter will rank with Homer, with Sophocles, with Praxiteles, or with Phidias?
