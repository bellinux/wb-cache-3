5|$|Several {{witnesses}} reported men collecting for charity. On 20 April, {{four hundred}} yards from apartment 5A, a bedraggled-looking man asked a tourist in her holiday apartment for money for an orphanage in nearby Espiche. She described him as pushy and intimidating, and said he made her feel uncomfortable. Apparently there were no orphanages or similar institutions in or near Espiche at that time. On the afternoon of 25 or 26 April, the tourist who rented apartment 5A before the McCanns encountered a <b>man</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> balcony who had entered via the steps from the street. Polite and clean-shaven, the visitor asked for money for an orphanage. On {{the day of the}} disappearance, 3 May, there were four charity collections by two men in the streets around 5A. At 4 pm two black-haired men approached a British homeowner looking for funds for a hostel or hospice in or near Espiche, and at 5 pm two men approached another British tourist with a similar story.|$|E

25|$|The book {{argues that}} {{intuitive}} judgment is developed by experience, training, and knowledge. For example, Gladwell claims that prejudice can operate at an intuitive unconscious level, even in individuals whose conscious attitudes are not prejudiced. An example {{is in the}} halo effect, where a person having a salient positive quality {{is thought to be}} superior in other, unrelated respects. Gladwell uses the 1999 killing of Amadou Diallo, where four New York policemen shot an innocent <b>man</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> doorstep 41 times, as another example of how rapid, intuitive judgment can have disastrous effects.|$|E
25|$|Elk Island National Park also {{remains a}} seed herd for {{repopulation}} efforts in other areas. Elk Island elk have been relocated to various parts North America, including Ontario and {{the foothills of}} the Rockies. Plains bison have been reintroduced to conservation areas scattered throughout their historic domain, for example American Prairie Reserve in eastern Montana, Grasslands National Park and the Old <b>Man</b> <b>on</b> <b>His</b> Back Prairie and Heritage Conservation Area in Saskatchewan, and in 2006, 30 wood bison were relocated to the Republic of Sakha (Yakutia) to begin repopulation efforts of the area historically inhabited by the now extinct steppe bison.|$|E

25|$|Even {{after the}} 2013 reform, marital rape when {{the wife and}} husband live {{together}} continued {{not to be a}} crime in India. Article 376B of the 2013 law made forced sexual intercourse by a man with his wife – if she is living separately – a crime, whether under a decree of separation or otherwise, punishable with at least a 2-year prison term. Forced sex by a <b>man</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> wife may also be considered a prosecutable domestic violence under other sections of Indian Penal code, such as Section 498(A) as well as the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act 2005. The crime of sexual assault on a child, that is anyone below the age of eighteen, is further outlined and mandatory punishments described in The Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act 2012.|$|E

The lane was only yards from her home in Langside Place. She had been raped and strangled. The {{previous}} night, she had told her parents that she was going out dancing at a nearby club, the Majestic Ballroom in Hope Street. Patricia had, in fact, gone to the Barrowland Ballroom for the over-25s night. It transpired that {{at some point during the}} night, Docker left the Majestic and ended up at the Barrowlands where it is thought she met her killer. It was several days after her murder that the police found out that she had actually gone to the Barrowlands. Focusing their investigation on the Majestic cost the police valuable time. Pat's handbag and clothes were missing and despite months of investigation, neither were ever found.|$|E

[...] In fact, Schulz is the best {{man in the middle}} of the line I have ever seen in all my {{football}} experience". [...] In naming Schulz to his All-America team, Walter Camp said: [...] "He is well over six feet in height, yet a fast, powerful man who gets well over the field and makes more tackles in a game than any other <b>man</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> team. [...] In addition he is an accurate passer and feeds the ball well to his backs either for kicks or runs".|$|E
500|$|Another {{recorded}} witch {{trial in}} Bury St Edmunds was in 1655 when {{a mother and}} daughter {{by the name of}} Boram were tried and said to have been hanged. The last was in 1694 when Lord Chief Justice Sir John Holt, [...] "who did more than any other man in English history to end the prosecution of witches", forced the acquittal of Mother Munnings' of Hartis (Hartest) on charges of prognostications causing death. The chief charge was 17 years old, the second brought by a <b>man</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> way home from an alehouse. Sir John [...] "so well directed the jury that she was acquitted".|$|E

500|$|Bruegel based {{the work}} on the Biblical parable of the blind leading the blind from Matthew 15:14, in which Christ refers to the Pharisees. [...] According to art critic Margaret Sullivan, Bruegel's {{audience}} was likely as familiar with classical literature as with the Bible. Erasmus had published his Adagia two years before Bruegel's painting, and it contained the quotation [...] "" [...] ("the blind leader of the blind") by Roman poet Horace. [...] Bruegel expands the two blind men in the parable to six; they are well dressed, rather than wearing the peasant clothing that typifies his late work. [...] The first blind man's face is not visible; the second twists his head as he falls, perhaps to avoid landing face-first. The shinguard-clad third <b>man,</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> toes with knees bent and face to the sky, shares a staff with the second, by which he is being pulled down. The others have yet to stumble, but the same fate seems implied.|$|E
500|$|According to Neil Finn, [...] "It (Time on Earth) doesn't {{sound like}} any one {{particular}} Crowded House album, {{but it has}} elements of Crowded House... {{in as much as}} Nick and I make a sound together when we play and always did. I think there's a lot of heart and spirit in the album which is connected with the loss of our dear friend Paul but also an attempt to try and make sense of it and move forward. And as such, it seemed the most obvious and {{best way to do that}} was to be playing music again with each other, Nick and I. I want to be in a band and what other band could it be." [...] Crowded House's leader, Neil Finn has indicated that, as the album began life as a solo project, its sound is generally different from Crowded House, though similar in parts, indicating that no one album by the group sounds like this one. As the album is dedicated to Hester and attends to his death, much of the album has a mournful tone, however this has been received well by critics, with some indicating that [...] "fortunately, Finn is a master at expressing ambiguity, (both) lyrically and musically". Finn has said of the song [...] "People Are Like Suns", that [...] "Part of it is the idea that people burn brightly and then they fade out. Also, when I wrote it, I was reading Ian McEwan's novel Saturday, which begins with a <b>man</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> balcony watching his plane go down, so the first lines borrow something from that image." ...|$|E
500|$|Since its airing, [...] "Goodbye, Michael" [...] was {{met with}} {{critical}} acclaim and {{is considered one of}} the best episodes of The Office by critics and fans. Cindy White of IGN said that overall the episode was [...] "one of those historic television moments". She went on to praise the character's awareness of the camera crew along with Michael saying his goodbyes to the staff. She ultimately gave the episode a 9 out of 10. The A.V. Club writer Myles McNutt considered the episode to be a classic and praised Greg Daniels choice of showing [...] "their [...] Michael Scott". He ultimately gave the episode an A. TV Squad writer Joel Keller wrote the episode felt like the series finale and that [...] "As final episodes go, this one was a mixed bag". Entertainment Weeklys Hillary Busis praised Carell's performance. HitFix writer Daniel Feinberg wrote that while the episode [...] "wasn't flawless" [...] it was [...] "an appropriate disentanglement". Despite this, he criticized the episode for proving the point that the show could not survive without Michael. Despite this he complimented the performance of the supporting actors. New York writer Phoebe Reilly slightly criticized Pam's silent goodbye to Michael. Despite this, she said, Dwight's tears in his talking head and Jim's goodbye to Michael [...] "achieved the bearable level of poignancy". Rob Sheffield of Rolling Stone praised the ending of the episode and the reference to the original British version of The Office. BuddyTV writer Meghan Carlson called Oscar's scarecrow gift scene the best moment of the episode. HitFix reviewer Alan Sepinwall called the episode [...] "a pretty fantastic tribute to that <b>man</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> way out the door." ...|$|E
