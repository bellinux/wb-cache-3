Starting in the early 2000s OMAC (Organization for Machine Automation and Control) began work on a similar standard that embraced some of the basic concepts developed for the Batch Control Industry with the intent of providing the same benefits to the <b>Machine</b> <b>Control</b> Industry, specifically for Packaging Machines. [...] These standards continued in parallel development until 2008 when an ISA sanctioned technical report was written to harmonize these standards.

A framework and implementation methods of real-time <b>machining</b> process <b>control</b> based on STEP-NC are presented in this paper. Data model compatible with ISO 14649 standard is built to transfer high-level real-time <b>machining</b> process <b>control</b> information between CAPP systems and CNC systems, in which EXPRESS language is used to define new STEP-NC entities. Methods for implementing real-time <b>machining</b> process <b>control</b> at shop floor are studied and realized on an open STEP-NC controller, which is developed using object-oriented, multithread, and shared memory technologies conjunctively. Cutting force at specific direction of machining feature in side mill is chosen to be controlled object, and a fuzzy control algorithm with self-adjusting factor is designed and embedded in the software CNC kernel of STEP-NC controller. Experiments are carried out to verify the proposed framework, STEP-NC data model, and implementation methods for real-time <b>machining</b> process <b>control.</b> The results of experiments prove that real-time <b>machining</b> process <b>control</b> tasks can be interpreted and executed correctly by the STEP-NC controller at shop floor, in which actual cutting force is kept around ideal value, whether axial cutting depth changes suddenly or continuously...|$|R
