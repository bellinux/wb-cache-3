5|$|Self-empathy {{involves}} compassionately {{connecting with}} {{what is going on}} inside us. This <b>may</b> <b>involve,</b> without blame, noticing the thoughts and judgments we are having, noticing our feelings, and most critically, connecting to the needs that are affecting us.|$|E
5|$|A low calorie diet extends median {{and maximum}} {{lifespan}} in many animals. This effect <b>may</b> <b>involve</b> {{a reduction in}} oxidative stress. While {{there is some evidence}} to support the role of oxidative stress in aging in model organisms such as Drosophila melanogaster and Caenorhabditis elegans, the evidence in mammals is less clear. Indeed, a 2009 review of experiments in mice concluded that almost all manipulations of antioxidant systems had no effect on aging.|$|E
5|$|Another {{important}} form {{of protective}} mimicry is Müllerian mimicry, discovered by and {{named after the}} naturalist Fritz Müller. In Müllerian mimicry both model and mimic are aposematic, so mimicry may be mutual, does not necessarily constitute a bluff or deception, and as in the wasps and bees <b>may</b> <b>involve</b> many species in a mimicry ring.|$|E

5|$|Further to derivational and inflectional morphemes, Wagiman coverbs and {{nominals}} often undergo reduplication, whereby a part, or {{often the}} entirety of the root, is repeated. Reduplication can convey a multitude of meanings. When coverbs are reduplicated, the resulting derived coverb <b>may</b> <b>involve</b> added meaning components such as iterativity, duration or habituality.|$|E
5|$|Mimicry <b>may</b> <b>involve</b> {{numerous}} species; many harmless {{species such}} as hoverflies are Batesian mimics of strongly defended {{species such as}} wasps, while many such well-defended species form Mullerian mimicry rings, all resembling each other. Mimicry between prey species and their predators often involves three or more species.|$|E
5|$|Prehistoric art in Scotland is {{visual art}} created or {{found within the}} modern borders of Scotland, before the {{departure}} of the Romans from southern and central Britain in the early fifth century CE, which is usually seen as the beginning of the early historic or Medieval era. There is no clear definition of prehistoric art among scholars and objects that <b>may</b> <b>involve</b> creativity often lack a context {{that would allow them to}} be understood.|$|E
50|$|Manganates are {{unstable}} towards disproportionation {{in all but}} {{the most}} alkaline of aqueous solutions. The ultimate products are permanganate and manganese dioxide, but the kinetics are complex and the mechanism <b>may</b> <b>involved</b> protonated and/or manganese(V) species.|$|R
50|$|The SRT is on {{stand-by}} {{around the}} clock, ready {{to carry out}} search and rescue operations nationwide, which demand sophisticated and specialised knowledge and skills. Such missions <b>may</b> <b>involved</b> firefighting on ships involving hazardous material and rescuing survivors from capsized or sinking vessels.|$|R
5000|$|Associates no traders: civil {{capacity}} {{is enough to}} be involved. An emancipated minor, a major protected, 2 spouses, a foreigner <b>may</b> be <b>involved.</b> The legal persons <b>may</b> also be <b>involved.</b>|$|R
5|$|Searching for water, food, or mates, {{the painted}} turtles travel {{up to several}} {{kilometers}} at a time. During summer, in response to heat and water-clogging vegetation, the turtles may vacate shallow marshes for more permanent waters. Short overland migrations <b>may</b> <b>involve</b> hundreds of turtles together. If heat and drought are prolonged, the turtles will bury themselves and, in extreme cases, die.|$|E
5|$|The {{condition}} {{is difficult to}} treat, and <b>may</b> <b>involve</b> fillings, fluoride to fight tooth decay and drugs that increase saliva for dry mouth, as well as oral hygiene instruction. It can be medically dangerous for active methamphetamine users because of the cardiac problems that can result from the interaction of local anesthetic with the drug.|$|E
5|$|Troops may plan outings and {{activities}} outside the troop meeting. These <b>may</b> <b>involve</b> camping, backpacking, hiking, canoeing, rafting, climbing, caving, rappelling, and other activities. These outings {{are an important}} place for Scouts to work on skills and rank advancement, have fun, and engage in productive outdoor activities.|$|E

5000|$|The {{mechanisms}} underlying SUDEP are {{not well}} understood but probably involve several pathophysiological mechanisms and circumstances. The most commonly involved are seizure-induced hypoventilation and cardiac arrhythmias but different mechanisms <b>may</b> be <b>involved</b> in different individuals, {{and more than one}} mechanism <b>may</b> be <b>involved</b> in any one individual.|$|R
5|$|When {{the glass}} {{electrode}} cannot be employed, as with non-aqueous solutions, spectrophotometric methods are frequently used. These <b>may</b> <b>involve</b> absorbance or fluorescence measurements. In {{both cases the}} measured quantity {{is assumed to be}} proportional to the sum of contributions from each photo-active species; with absorbance measurements the Beer-Lambert law is assumed to apply.|$|E
5|$|Americium is {{produced}} mostly artificially in small quantities, for research purposes. A tonne of {{spent nuclear fuel}} contains about 100grams of various americium isotopes, mostly 241Am and 243Am. Their prolonged radioactivity is undesirable for the disposal, and therefore americium, together with other long-lived actinides, must be neutralized. The associated procedure <b>may</b> <b>involve</b> several steps, where americium is first separated and then converted by neutron bombardment in special reactors to short-lived nuclides. This procedure is well known as nuclear transmutation, {{but it is still}} being developed for americium. The transuranic elements from americium to fermium occurred naturally in the natural nuclear fission reactor at Oklo, but no longer do so.|$|E
5|$|Earnings {{management}} <b>may</b> <b>involve</b> exploiting {{opportunities to}} make accounting decisions that change the earnings figure reported on the financial statements. Accounting decisions can in turn affect earnings because they can influence the timing of transactions and the estimates used in financial reporting. For example, a comparatively small change in the estimates for uncollectible accounts can {{have a significant effect}} on net income, and a company using last-in, first-out accounting for inventories can increase net income in times of rising prices by delaying purchases to future periods.|$|E
2500|$|Chemical {{engineers}} <b>may</b> be <b>involved</b> {{in industry}} or university research {{where they are}} tasked with designing and performing experiments to create better and safer methods for production, pollution control, and resource conservation. They <b>may</b> be <b>involved</b> in designing and constructing plants as a project engineer. Chemical engineers serving as project engineers use their knowledge in selecting optimal production methods and plant equipment to minimize costs and maximize safety and profitability. After plant construction, chemical engineering project managers <b>may</b> be <b>involved</b> in equipment upgrades, process changes, troubleshooting, and daily operations in either full-time or consulting roles.|$|R

5000|$|Cytosolic beta-glucosidase is a {{predominantly}} liver enzyme that efficiently hydrolyzes beta-D-glucoside and beta-D-galactoside, but not any known physiologic beta-glycoside, {{suggesting that it}} <b>may</b> be <b>involved</b> in detoxification of plant glycosides. GBA3 also has significant neutral glycosylceramidase activity (...) , suggesting that it <b>may</b> be <b>involved</b> in a non-lysosomal catabolic pathway of glucosylceramide metabolism.|$|R
5|$|Enforcers {{sometimes}} start {{fights to}} build game momentum {{and provide a}} psychological advantage over the opposing team. These fights usually involve two enforcers, but <b>may</b> <b>involve</b> any player who is agitating the opposition. This type of fight raises morale on the team of the player who wins, and often excites the home crowd. For that reason, {{it can also be}} a gamble to start a fight for momentum; if an enforcer loses the fight, the momentum can swing the wrong way.|$|E
5|$|It is also {{possible}} to consider matrices with infinitely many rows and/or columns even if, being infinite objects, one cannot write down such matrices explicitly. All that matters is that for every element in the set indexing rows, and every element in the set indexing columns, there is a well-defined entry (these index sets need not even be subsets of the natural numbers). The basic operations of addition, subtraction, scalar multiplication and transposition can still be defined without problem; however matrix multiplication <b>may</b> <b>involve</b> infinite summations to define the resulting entries, and these are not defined in general.|$|E
5|$|The {{cell lines}} of origin {{are not fully}} understood. The {{mechanism}} <b>may</b> <b>involve</b> abnormal activation of stem cells. In the proximal airways, stem cells that express keratin 5 {{are more likely to}} be affected, typically leading to squamous-cell lung carcinoma. In the middle airways, implicated stem cells include club cells and neuroepithelial cells that express club cell secretory protein. Small-cell lung carcinoma may be derived from these cell lines or neuroendocrine cells, and may express CD44.|$|E

5|$|The {{hash value}} that this class {{associates}} with each object, its identityHashCode, {{is guaranteed to}} remain fixed for the lifetime of an object but is otherwise arbitrary. Because the identityHashCode is constructed only once per object, and {{is not required to}} be related to the object's address or value, its construction <b>may</b> <b>involve</b> slower computations such as the call to a random or pseudorandom number generator. For instance, Java 8 uses an Xorshift pseudorandom number generator to construct these values.|$|E
5|$|Archaea can be {{infected}} by double-stranded DNA viruses that are unrelated {{to any other}} form of virus and have a variety of unusual shapes, including bottles, hooked rods, or teardrops. These viruses have been studied in most detail in thermophilics, particularly the orders Sulfolobales and Thermoproteales. Two groups of single-stranded DNA viruses that infect archaea have been recently isolated. One group is exemplified by the Halorubrum pleomorphic virus 1 ("Pleolipoviridae") infecting halophilic archaea and the other one by the Aeropyrum coil-shaped virus ("Spiraviridae") infecting a hyperthermophilic (optimal growth at 90–95°C) host. Notably, the latter virus has the largest currently reported ssDNA genome. Defenses against these viruses <b>may</b> <b>involve</b> RNA interference from repetitive DNA sequences that are related to the genes of the viruses.|$|E
5|$|CSF {{returns to}} the {{vascular}} system by entering the dural venous sinuses via arachnoid granulations. These are outpouchings of the arachnoid mater into the venous sinuses around the brain, with valves to ensure one-way drainage. This occurs because of a pressure difference between the arachnoid mater and venous sinuses. CSF has also been seen to drain into lymphatic vessels, particularly those surrounding the nose via drainage along the olfactory nerve through the cribriform plate. The pathway and extent are currently not known, but <b>may</b> <b>involve</b> CSF flow along some cranial nerves and be more prominent in the neonate. CSF turns over {{at a rate of}} three to four times a day. CSF has also been seen to be reabsorbed through the sheathes of cranial and spinal nerve sheathes, and through the ependyma.|$|E
