Their marriage problems escalated to the point where they separated in 1852. Samuel, when he became her husband, had also taken complete control of her estate income. Upon her husband’s death in 1876, she had found that through a series of bad investments, most of her money had been spent.|$|E

At 8pm, the organiser, Félix Lévitan, told the press that the UCI had ruled that Pollentier would be fined 5,000 Swiss francs and start an immediate suspension of two months. The question was obvious: if a rider was prepared to take drugs and win a stage, knowing he would be tested, how <b>many</b> <b>times</b> <b>had</b> the ruse been shown to work before? ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{second period}} of Black Nationalism began after the Revolutionary War. This period {{refers to the}} time when a {{sizeable}} number of educated Africans within the colonies [...] (specifically within New England and Pennsylvania) had become disgusted with the social conditions that arose out of the Enlightenment ideas. From this way of thinking came the rise of the Black community to unite and create organizations for themselves. The intention behind these organizations was to group together and voice their concerns, and help their own community advance itself. This form of thinking can be found in historical personalities such as; Prince Hall, Richard Allen and Absalom Jones, James Forten, Cyrus Bustill, William Gray through their need to become founders of certain organizations such as African Masonic lodges, the Free African Society, and Church Institutions such as the African Episcopal Church of St. Thomas. These institutions served as early foundations to developing independent and separate organizations for their own people. The goal was to create groups was to include those who so <b>many</b> <b>times</b> <b>had</b> been excluded from (exclusively) white community and government-funded organizations.|$|E

2500|$|The Dubois Brothers {{are nine}} of the ten sons of Napoleon Dubois also known as [...] "Paulo" [...] and Alice Tribodeau. The 10th son, Roger, never had {{any part of the}} {{organized}} crime group and lived a crime free life working a government job. The nine brothers consisted of: Raymond, Jean-Guy, Normand, Claude, Rene, Rolland, Jean-Paul, and the two twins Maurice and Adrien. The Dubois Brothers came from Saint-Henri, a working-class neighbourhood in Montreal, which was bordered by rail yards and factories. Their father worked as a bartender at a local bar. The boys grew up in what they described as an [...] "impoverished childhood" [...] but were considered as being aggressive, strong and very close-knit, quickly realizing the strength in their unity. The Dubois Brothers had explained in an interview that in school they were mocked because of what they wore and <b>many</b> <b>times</b> <b>had</b> to skip meals or could only have molasses sandwiches. Their father, Napoleon 'Paulo' Dubois, died {{near the end of the}} Dubois Brothers reign in January 1976 of what was considered a natural death in an old folks home.|$|E

He heard them repeating the charge. He saw them passing him silently on the street. Shamefully he remembered the time, five months agone, when he had worn the very uniform of his Revolutionary ancestor.

60|$|<b>Many</b> <b>times</b> <b>had</b> Tarzan behaved {{similarly}} in {{the village}} of Mbonga, the chief. His mysterious and unexpected appearances always filled the breasts of the poor, superstitious blacks with the panic of terror; never, it seemed, could they accustom themselves to the sight of him. It was this terror which lent to the adventures the spice of interest and amusement which the human mind of the ape-man craved. Merely to kill was not in itself sufficient. Accustomed to the sight of death, Tarzan found no great pleasure in it. Long since had he avenged the death of Kala, but in the accomplishment of it, he had learned the excitement and the pleasure to be derived from the baiting of the blacks. Of this he never tired.|$|E
