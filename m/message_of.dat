5|$|Barça's local rival {{has always}} been Espanyol. Blanc-i-blaus, {{being one of the}} clubs granted royal patronage, was founded {{exclusively}} by Spanish football fans, unlike the multinational nature of Barça's primary board. The founding <b>message</b> <b>of</b> the club was clearly anti-Barcelona, and they disapprovingly saw FC Barcelona as a team of foreigners. The rivalry was strengthened by what Catalonians saw as a provocative representative of Madrid. Their original ground was in the affluent district of Sarrià.|$|E
5|$|Both {{men were}} incarcerated in Landsberg Prison, where Hitler soon {{began work on}} his memoir, Mein Kampf ("My Struggle"), which he {{dictated}} to fellow prisoners Hess and Emil Maurice. Edited by publisher Max Amann, Hess and others, the work was published in two parts in 1925 and 1926. It was later released in a single volume, which became a best-seller after 1930. This book, with its <b>message</b> <b>of</b> violent antisemitism, became {{the foundation of the}} political platform of the NSDAP.|$|E

5|$|In {{the course}} of his {{preparing}} for a drama review, Hazlitt was in the habit of reading or rereading the play he was soon to see, and his reviews came to include extensive commentary on the plays themselves, turning rapidly from dramatic criticism to literary criticism. With Shakespeare in particular, this led to considerations {{of the ways in which}} the actors—again, particularly his favourite Kean—communicated the <b>message</b> <b>of</b> the plays. But he also noted ways in which no actor's interpretation could live up to the dramatist's conception.|$|E
5|$|In {{the social}} {{evolution}} from the archaic age to the classical, the public ceased carrying weapons into the poleis. Originally {{it was expected}} that one carried a sword while in the city; However, a transition to spears, and then to staffs occurred until wearing any weapon in the city became a foolish old custom. Thus, the very act of carrying a staff was slightly taboo itself. According to modern theorists, the symbol of the staff was one which both functions as a tool to signal the user’s dissociation from physical labour, that is, as a display of conspicuous leisure, {{and at the same time}} it also has an association with sport and typically plays a part in hunting and sports clothing. Thus, it displays active and warlike qualities, rather than being a symbol of a weak man’s need to support himself. The staff itself became a <b>message</b> <b>of</b> how the Cynic was free through its possible interpretation as an item of leisure, but, just as equivalent, was its <b>message</b> <b>of</b> strength - a virtue held in abundance by the Cynic philosopher.|$|E
