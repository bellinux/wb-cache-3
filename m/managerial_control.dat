5|$|An added {{difficulty}} for Killigrew {{and his sons}} Thomas and Charles was the political unrest of 1678–1684 with the Popish Plot and the Exclusion Bill crisis distracting potential audiences from things theatrical. This affected both the King's and the Duke's companies, {{but most of all}} the King's which had no profit margin to carry them through the lean years. In 1682, the companies merged, or rather, the King's was absorbed by the Duke's. Led at the time by Thomas Betterton, the United Company, as it was now called, chose Drury Lane as their production house, leaving the Duke's Company's theatre in Dorset Garden closed for a time. In 1688 Betterton was removed from <b>managerial</b> <b>control</b> by Alexander Davenant, son of William Davenant, the original patent holder for the Duke's Company. Davenant's management (with Charles Killigrew) proved brief and disastrous, and by 1693 he was fleeing to the Canary Islands in the wake of embezzlement charges. The Theatre Royal found itself in the hands of lawyer Christopher Rich for the next 16 years.|$|E

40|$|This is {{the author}} {{accepted}} manuscript. The final version is available from Emerald via the DOI in this record. Purpose The {{purpose of this paper}} is to explore two hospital departments, one of which is laterally dependent on the other to function, but which are subject to distinct vertical <b>managerial</b> <b>controls.</b> This complexity in vertical–lateral relations generates tension amongst the hospital’s senior managers and a perception of coordination difficulties. However, this paper shows how the interplay between <b>managerial</b> and non-managerial <b>controls,</b> plus important employee “work”, moderates tension and facilitates day-to-day lateral coordination at the patient-facing level. Design/methodology/approach This is a case-study, relying mostly on the findings of semi-structured interviews. Theoretically, the paper draws from previous insights on inter-organisational relations (but informing the focus on intra-organisational coordination) and an “institutional work” perspective. Findings Consistent with much extant literature, this paper reveals how non-managerial controls help to moderate tensions that could emerge from the coercive use of <b>managerial</b> <b>controls.</b> However, the authors also show a maintained influence and flexibility in the <b>managerial</b> <b>controls</b> at patient-facing levels, as new circumstances unfold. Research limitations/implications The findings of this paper could generalise neither all laterally dependent spaces in hospitals nor patterns across different hospitals. The authors recommend future research into the dynamics and interaction of <b>managerial</b> and non-managerial <b>controls</b> in other complex settings, plus focus on the purposeful work of influential agents. Originality/value The paper has two primary contributions: extending our knowledge of the interplay between <b>managerial</b> and non-managerial <b>controls</b> inside complex organisations, where non-managerial controls reinforce rather than displace <b>managerial</b> <b>controls,</b> and highlighting that it is seldom just controls per se which “matter”, but also agents’ purposeful actions that facilitate coordination in complex organisations...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACTThis {{research}} aims {{to identify}} {{the contributions of the}} international empirical studies for the development of Brazilian researches in the analyses of the relationships between the Management Control Systems (MCS) and the innovation. The innovation is a process and as such has to be managed. This need for the innovation management emphasizes the relevance of the control systems because the suitability of the <b>managerial</b> <b>controls</b> in the different strategic contexts may be fundamental for the success of the organizations. This paper makes a brief review of the Simons (1995) ’s Levers of Control model {{which is one of the}} most comprehensive organizational management models. Pointing out the importance of innovation in the organizational management, the paper shows a brief definition of innovation and makes a review of the recently published literature in the main international journals involving MCS and the innovation process. It is noticed that the theme is absent in the local literature, and internationally it is noticed a growing number of researches, however, the results are still diffused, which offer the possibility of exploring new opportunities of researches. In this context, the framework presented by Davila, Foster & Oyon (2009 b) for analyses of controls and innovations under the strategic perspective provides a framework to advance in the researches aiming to analyze different ways of <b>managerial</b> <b>controls</b> that can stimulate the innovation and consequent positive effect on the organizational performance...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{develops}} a methodology for modeling consumer response that integrates previous research in stochastic brand selection, diffusion of innovation, test market analysis, and new product design. The methodology makes it practical to extend brand selection models to include diffusion phenomena such as awareness, trial, and information flow. Purchase timing and brand selection are interdependent and both phenomena depend jointly on <b>managerial</b> <b>controls</b> such as advertising, coupons, price-off promotion, product positioning, and consumer characteristics. Within this general structure, we provide practical estimation procedures (a least squares approximation {{to the maximum}} likelihood estimates) to determine the parameters which link <b>managerial</b> <b>controls</b> to consumer response. Closed form solutions are derived for cumulative awareness, cumulative trial, penetration, expected sales, and purchases due to promotion [...] -all {{as a function of}} time. We also provide simplified expressions for equilibrium (t -> ∞) market share. Tradeoffs among complexity of the diffusion process, number of managerial variables, nonstationarity, complexity of purchase timing, consumer segmentation, and sample size are made explicit so that the marketing scientist can customize his analyses to the managerial problems that he faces. The effects of sample size, data interval frequency, and collinearity in the explanatory variables are investigated with simulations based on a five-state consumer response process which depends on 8 [...] 10 marketing variables.

40|$|Empirical {{literature}} on corporate governance often assumes independence among different control mechanisms. However, different {{studies in the}} Anglo-Saxon context find that control mechanisms are interrelated. The Spanish corporate governance system, unlike the Anglo-Saxon one, is characterised by the dominance of internal controls, mainly the stock ownership concentration {{and the board of}} directors. In this internal control context, we specifically analyse the possible substitution of the supervisory potential of the board outsiders by the incentive effects derived from managerial stock ownership and the supervisory role of large shareholders. Our main results show a negative relationship between the proportion of outside directors and managerial and large blockholders' ownership stake. These findings support the substitution among internal controls and suggest that Spanish firms form an efficient conglomerate of <b>managerial</b> <b>controls,</b> in which deficiencies in a single mechanism can be compensated by the action of an alternative one.
