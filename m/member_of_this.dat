5|$|A {{distinct}} {{group of}} DNA-binding proteins is the DNA-binding proteins that specifically bind single-stranded DNA. In humans, replication protein A is the best-understood <b>member</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> family {{and is used}} in processes where the double helix is separated, including DNA replication, recombination, and DNA repair. These binding proteins seem to stabilize single-stranded DNA and protect it from forming stem-loops or being degraded by nucleases.|$|E

50|$|Avukaya is {{an ethnic}} group of South Sudan. Some <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> ethnic have fled to the Democratic Republic of the Congo due to persecution. About 50,000 <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> ethnic group live in South Sudan. Many <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> ethnic group belong to the Christian {{minority}} of South Sudan.

5|$|Luigi Pirandello's 1913 novel I vecchi e {{i giovani}} (The Old and the Young) retraces {{the history of}} the failure and {{repression}} of the Fasci Siciliani in the period from 1893-94. Although Pirandello was not an active <b>member</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> movement, he had close ties of friendship with some of its leading ideologists: Rosario Garibaldi Bosco, Enrico La Loggia, Giuseppe De Felice Giuffrida and Francesco De Luca.|$|E
5|$|After 1462 Wallachia {{preserved}} its autonomy {{mainly through}} {{the intervention of}} Stephen the Great of Moldavia. At {{the end of the}} century, however, Radu IV the Great (14951508) became an obedient subject of the sultan and visited Istanbul annually to personally offer the tribute. Even so, he could only stay in power by collaborating with the powerful Craioveşti family, strongly connected to the Ottomans by trading. In 1512 a <b>member</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> family, Neagoe (15121521) rose to throne, but he adopted the dynastic name of Basarab in order to legitimize his rule. He wrote the first original work of Romanian literature, titled Teachings, to his son, Teodosius on moral, political, and military questions.|$|E

5|$|Another species {{complex in}} Attalea {{includes}} A.speciosa and related species. Henderson (1995) recognised A.speciosa and A.spectabilis, considering {{the latter to}} either be an acaulescent form of A.speciosa or a hybrid between it and A.microcarpa. Govaerts and Dransfield accepted A.spectabilis, but Glassman considered it a dubious taxon. Attalea vitrivir was recognised as a distinct species by Michael Balick and coauthors; Glassman and Govaerts and Dransfield concurred, but Henderson considered it part of A.speciosa. Glassman also described a fourth <b>member</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> group, A.brejinhoensis, and it is accepted by Govaerts and Dransfield.|$|E
5|$|At age 11, Cassidy began {{singing and}} playing guitar in a Washington-area band called Easy Street. This band {{performed}} {{in a variety of}} styles at weddings, corporate parties, and pubs. Due to her shyness, she struggled with performing in front of strangers. While a student at Bowie High School, she sang with a local band called Stonehenge. During the summer of 1983, Cassidy sang and played guitar six days a week at the theme park Wild World. Her younger brother Dan, a fiddler, was also a <b>member</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> working band. She enrolled in art classes at Prince George's Community College but dropped out after finding them unhelpful.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{practical}} limitations {{of meetings with}} 74 members {{on a regular basis}} (the total number of members from the five Chambers), the Charter called for a board of directors comprising nineteen members of the five Chambers. Van Rensselaer was chosen a <b>member</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> College of XIX, as it was called. It is said that care was exercised in the selection of the directors of each chamber, and only men of wealth and the highest known integrity were eligible for the trust. Van Rensselaer was apparently known as an unusually clear-headed man and an able and practical merchant who did not limit himself to his own branch of trade. These qualities presumably garnered the trust needed to be elected to the College of XIX.|$|E
50|$|Acetals, ketals, hemiacetals and hemiketals react {{similarly}} to ethers, although <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> {{group would be}} less likely to form explosively unstable peroxides when exposed to oxygen. <b>Members</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> group may react violently with strong oxidizing agents.|$|R
50|$|John Zenevisi {{was one of}} {{the most}} notable <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> family. In the period 1373-1414 he {{controlled}} Gjirokaster and its surroundings. After the Ottomans captured the region <b>of</b> Epirus, <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> family held high positions within Ottoman hierarchy.|$|R
50|$|<b>Members</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> {{family are}} {{perennial}} plants, with a bulb, corm or rhizome.

5|$|Echmarcach {{appears to}} have forged an {{alliance}} with the powerful Uí Briain. A leading <b>member</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> kindred, Donnchad mac Briain, King of Munster, was married to Cacht ingen Ragnaill, {{a woman who could}} have been closely related to Echmarcach. Certainly, Echmarcach's daughter, Mór, married one of Donnchad's Uí Briain close kinsmen. Echmarcach's violent career brought him into bitter conflict with a particular branch of the Uí Ímair who had held Dublin periodically from the early eleventh century. This branch was supported by the rising Uí Cheinnselaig, an Irish kindred responsible for Echmarcach's final expulsion from Dublin and apparently Mann as well.|$|E
5|$|Equus is a genus {{of mammals}} {{in the family}} Equidae, which {{includes}} horses, asses, and zebras. Within Equidae, Equus is the only recognized extant genus, comprising seven living species. The term equine refers to any <b>member</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> genus, including horses. Like Equidae more broadly, Equus has numerous extinct species known only from fossils. The genus most likely originated in North America and spread quickly to the Old World. Equines are odd-toed ungulates with slender legs, long heads, relatively long necks, manes (erect in most subspecies) and long tails. All species are herbivorous, and mostly grazers with simpler digestive systems than ruminants but able to subsist on lower quality vegetation.|$|E
5|$|In August of 14 his {{grandfather}} Augustus died. In his honor, Drusus read a eulogy before the rostra at his funeral. The next month, on 17 September, the senate met to confirm {{his father as}} princeps. Among his first acts as emperor, Tiberius instituted the Sodales Augustales, a priesthood of the cult of Augustus which members of the imperial family, such as Drusus, became a <b>member</b> <b>of.</b> <b>This</b> wasn't his first religious post though, {{as he had been}} a pontifex since AD 7/8 - an important step to the prestigious pontifex maximus. Since 14 May AD 14, {{he was a member of}} the Fratres Arvales as well.|$|E

5|$|In current practice, the Marcellus Formation(abbr. Dm or Dms) is {{classified}} as the basal unit of the Hamilton Group(Dh), lying beneath the Mahantango Formation(Dmh) <b>member</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> group in Pennsylvania and Maryland. In New York, the Mahantango, also of Middle Devonian age, is further divided. There the Marcellus is separated from the overlying Skaneateles Formation, a more clastic and fossiliferous dark shale, by the thin Stafford or Mottville Limestone bed.|$|E
5|$|In {{its role}} {{supporting}} colonization of New Netherland, the West India Company had {{an executive board}} of nine members from the College of XIX to manage the concerns of their colony. Van Rensselaer was also a <b>member</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> group. In the early career of the Company, Van Rensselaer was one of its mainstays, placing several of his vessels at its disposal and twice advancing money to save its credit. His name is conspicuously identified with all its measures of policy, including the original settlement of Manhattan Island, New Amsterdam.|$|E
5|$|Nemegtomaia is {{estimated}} to have been around 2m (7ft) in length, and to have weighed 40kg (85lb). As an oviraptorosaur, {{it would have been}} feathered. It had a deep, narrow, and short skull, with an arched crest. It was toothless, had a short snout with a parrot-like beak, and a pair of tooth-like projections on its palate. It had three fingers; the first was largest and bore a strong claw. Nemegtomaia is classified {{as a member of the}} oviraptorid subfamily Ingeniinae, and it the only known <b>member</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> group with a cranial crest. Though Nemegtomaia has been used to suggest that oviraptorosaurs were flightless birds, the clade is generally considered a group of non-avian dinosaurs.|$|E

5|$|Q'anjob'al {{is spoken}} by 77,700 in Guatemala's Huehuetenango department, with small populations elsewhere. The region of Q'anjobalan {{speakers}} in Guatemala, due to genocidal policies during the Civil War and its {{close proximity to}} the Mexican border, was the source of a number of refugees. Thus there are now small Q'anjob'al, Jakaltek, and Awakatek populations in various locations in Mexico, the United States (such as Tuscarawas County, Ohio and Los Angeles, California), and, through postwar resettlement, other parts of Guatemala. Jakaltek (also known as Popti') is spoken by almost 100,000 in several municipalities of Huehuetenango. Another <b>member</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> branch is Akatek, with over 50,000 speakers in San Miguel Acatán and San Rafael La Independencia.|$|E
