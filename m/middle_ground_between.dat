A hard-working teacher despite poor pay, within several years Sudirman had become headmaster despite not having a teacher's certificate.

40|$|Abstract. We study a new robust path problem, the Online Replace-ment Path problem (ORP). Consider {{the problem}} of routing a {{physical}} package through a faulty network G = (V,E) from a source s ∈ V to a destination t ∈ V as quickly as possible. An adversary, {{whose objective is to}} maximize the latter routing time, can choose to remove a single edge in the network. In one setup, the identity of the edge is revealed to the routing mechanism (RM) while the package is in s. In this setup the best strategy is to route the package along the shortest path in the remaining network. The payoff maximization problem for the adversary becomes the Most Vital Arc problem (MVA), which amounts to choosing the edge in the network whose removal results in a maximal increase of the s-t distance. However, the assumption that the RM is informed about the failed edge when standing at s is unrealistic in many applica-tions, in which failures occur online, and, in particular, after the routing has started. We therefore consider the setup in which the adversary can reveal the identity of the failed edge just before the RM attempts to use this edge, thus forcing it to use a different route to t, starting from the current node. The problem of choosing the nominal path minimizing the worst case arrival time at t in this setup is ORP. We show that ORP can be solved in polynomial time and study other models naturally pro-viding <b>middle</b> <b>grounds</b> <b>between</b> MVA and ORP. Our results show that ORP comprises a highly flexible and tractable framework for dealing with robustness issues in the design of RM-s. ...|$|R

40|$|Time {{series of}} {{salinity}} and suspended-solids concentration measured at four locations and vertical profiles of salinity and suspended-solids concentration measured during 48 waterquality cruises from January 1993 to September 1997 are analyzed {{to describe the}} influence of salinity, bottom topography, and tides on locations of estuarine turbidity maxima in northern San Francisco Bay, California. Estuarine turbidity maxima form when salinity is present {{but they are not}} associated with a singular salinity. Bottom topography enhances salinity stratification, gravitational circulation and estuarine turbidity maxima formation seaward of sills. The spring/neap tidal cycle affects locations of estuarine turbidity maxima. Salinity stratification in Carquinez Strait, which is seaward of a sill, is greatest during neap tides, which is the only time when tidally averaged suspended-solids concentration in Carquinez Strait was less than that observed landward at Mallard Island. Spring tides cause the greatest vertical mixing and suspended-solids concentration in Carquinez Strait. Therefore, surface estuarine turbidity maxima always were located in or near the Strait (seaward of <b>Middle</b> <b>Ground)</b> during spring tide cruises, regardless of salinity. During neap tides, surface estuarine turbidity maxima always were observed in the landward half of the study area (landward of <b>Middle</b> <b>Ground)</b> and <b>between</b> 0 – 2 practical salinity units. 1...|$|R
