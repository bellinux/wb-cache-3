60|$|The {{summit of}} another bladder, the glands {{of which were}} in a beautifully clear condition, was {{irrigated}} with {{a few drops of}} a <b>mixed</b> <b>solution</b> of nitrate and phosphate of ammonia, each of one part to 437 of water. After 2 hrs. some few of the glands were brownish. After 8 hrs. almost all the oblong glands were brown and much more opaque than they were before; their primordial utricles were somewhat shrunk and contained a little aggregated granular matter. The spherical glands were still white, but their utricles were broken up into three or four small hyaline spheres, with an irregularly contracted mass {{in the middle of the}} basal part. These smaller spheres changed their forms in the course of a few hours and some of them disappeared. By the next morning, after 23 hrs. 30 m., they had all disappeared, and the glands were brown; their utricles now formed a globular shrunken mass in the middle. The utricles of the oblong glands had shrunk very little, but their contents were somewhat aggregated. Lastly, the summit of a bladder which had been previously irrigated for 21 hrs. with a solution of one part of sugar to 218 of water without being affected, was treated with the above mixed solution; and after 8 hrs. 30 m. all the glands became brown, with their primordial utricles slightly shrunk.|$|E
60|$|A short {{immersion}} {{in water for}} 20 m. did not retard the subsequent action of the phosphate, or of splinters of glass placed on the glands; but in two instances an immersion for 50 m. prevented any effect from a solution of camphor. Several leaves which had been left for 20 m. in a solution of one part of white sugar to 218 of water {{were placed in the}} phosphate solution, the action of which was delayed; whereas a <b>mixed</b> <b>solution</b> of sugar and the phosphate did not in the least interfere with the effects of the latter. Three leaves, after being immersed for 20 m. in the sugar solution, were placed in a solution of carbonate of ammonia (one part to 218 of water); in 2 m. or 3 m. the glands were blackened, and after 7 m. the tentacles were considerably inflected, so that the solution of sugar, though it delayed the action of the phosphate, did not delay that of the carbonate. Immersion in a similar solution of gum arabic for 20 m. had no retarding action on the phosphate. Three leaves were left for 20 m. in a mixture of one part of alcohol to seven parts of water, [page 214] and then placed in the phosphate solution: in 2 hrs. 15 m. there was a trace of inflection in one leaf, and in 5 hrs. 30 m. a second was slightly affected; the inflection subsequently increased, though slowly. Hence diluted alcohol, which, as we shall see, is hardly at all poisonous, plainly retards the subsequent action of the phosphate.|$|E

The study has revealed that different soils have different sorption capacity for different heavy metals. The Kd values are proportional to the sorption capacity of the soils. The sorption of Pb and Cu in single solution is higher than in <b>mix</b> <b>solution,</b> due to the competition for sorption sites among heavy metals in <b>mix</b> <b>solution.</b> The Kd values for Pb in single solution ranging from 36. 18 – 334. 48 L/g and for Cu is 9. 29 - 66. 19 L/g.

30|$|From the {{obtained}} {{friction factor}} results, {{it can be}} inferred that addition of XG reduced the DR capability of <b>mixed</b> <b>solutions</b> (DR% =  40 % and 55 %) with respect to 200  wppm HPAM solution. Also results suggested that increasing HPAM concentration in the <b>mixed</b> <b>solutions</b> {{does not change the}} DR efficiency decline significantly. Since there was only a small amount of chain degradation in semirigid polymers, the extent of DR depended only on the interaction between polymer chains and entanglements, which is directly related to polymer concentration. It should be considered that the concentration of XG was 100  wppm for <b>mixed</b> <b>solutions,</b> which is below the critical concentration of XG (C* ≈  300  ppm). Hence, as suggested by other authors (Wyatt et al. 2011; Berman 1978), mixing HPAM with higher concentrations of XG would be more beneficial in maintaining high DR efficiency and even better control of shear degradation of polyacrylamide solutions, which is the subject of our future work. Same as for the HPAM solutions, Brostow and exponential decay models were used to correlate the drag reduction behavior over time for the HPAM/XG <b>mixed</b> <b>solutions.</b> The result is shown in Fig.  9 and Table  4.
