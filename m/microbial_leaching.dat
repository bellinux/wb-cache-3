40|$|Rare earth {{elements}} (REEs) {{have become}} increasingly important in modern day technologies. Unfortunately, their recycling is currently limited, and the conventional technologies for their extraction and purification are exceedingly energy and chemical intensive. New sustainable technologies for REE extraction from both primary and secondary resources would be extremely beneficial. This research investigated a two-stage recovery strategy focused on the recovery of neodymium (Nd) and lanthanum (La) from monazite ore that combines microbially based leaching (using citric acid and spent fungal supernatant) with electrochemical extraction. Pretreating the phosphate-based monazite rock (via roasting) dramatically increased the <b>microbial</b> REE <b>leaching</b> efficiency. Batch experiments demonstrated the effective and continued leaching of REEs by recycled citric acid, with up to 392 mg of Nd L- 1 and 281 mg of La L- 1 leached during seven consecutive 24 h cycles. Neodymium was further extracted in the catholyte of a three-compartment electrochemical system, with up to 880 mg of Nd L- 1 achieved within 4 days (at 40 A m(- 2)). Meanwhile, the radioactive element thorium and counterions phosphate and citrate were separated effectively from the REEs in the anolyte, favoring REE extraction and allowing sustainable reuse of the leaching agent.

40|$|Classic {{resource}} competition theory typically treats resource supply {{rates as}} independent; however, nutrient supplies {{can be affected}} by plants indirectly, with important consequences for model predictions. We demonstrate this general phenomenon by using a model in which competition for nitrogen is mediated by soil moisture, with competitive outcomes including coexistence and multiple stable {{states as well as}} competitive exclusion. In the model, soil moisture regulates nitrogen availability through soil moisture dependence of <b>microbial</b> processes, <b>leaching,</b> and plant uptake. By affecting water availability, plants also indirectly affect nitrogen availability and may therefore alter the competitive outcome. Exotic annual species from the Mediterranean have displaced much of the native perennial grasses in California. Nitrogen and water {{have been shown to be}} potentially limiting in this system. We parameterize the model for a Californian grassland and show that soil moisture–mediated competition for nitrogen can explain the annual species’ dominance in drier areas, with coexistence expected in wetter regions.

40|$|Thesis (M. Sc.) - University of KwaZulu-Natal, Pietermaritzburg, 2008. <b>Microbial</b> <b>leaching</b> plays a {{significant}} role in the natural weathering of silicate containing ores such as diamond-bearing kimberlite. Harnessing <b>microbial</b> <b>leaching</b> processes to pre-treat mined kimberlite ores has been proposed as a means of improving diamond recovery efficiencies. The biomineralization of kimberlite is rarely studied. Therefore, this study investigated the feasibility of exploiting both chemolithotrophic and heterotrophic leaching processes to accelerate the weathering of kimberlite. Preliminary investigations using mixed chemolithotrophic leaching cultures were performed on four finely ground kimberlite samples ( 2 mm 5 mm< 6. 7 mm) was investigated. A continuous plug-flow bioleach column was used to model the behaviour of chemolithotrophic consortia in a dump- or heap leaching system. Two sequential columns were setup, in which the first consisted of kimberlite mixed with sulfur and the second purely kimberlite. Inorganic growth medium was pumped to the first column at a fixed dilution rate of 0. 25 h- 1 and the leachate from the first column dripped into the second. After an 8 week investigation period, the ICP and XRD data showed that weathering did occur. However, the pH results showed that the leaching process is governed by the amount of acid produced by the growth-rate independent chemolithotrophic consortia. Data from pH analyses also showed that the leaching bacteria reached ‘steady state’ conditions from day 45 onwards. The pH also remained higher in the second column than in the first column highlighting the alkaline nature of the kimberlite ores and its ability to act as a buffering agent and resist weathering. This important factor, as well as further optimisation studies in process operating conditions and efficiency, needs to be considered when establishing heap-leaching technology for these kimberlite ores. In the preliminary heterotrophic investigation, Aspergillus niger was used to produce organic metabolites to enhance kimberlite mineralization. The results demonstrated that the organic acid metabolites generated caused partial solubilization of the kimberlite minerals. However, it was deduced that for more significant changes to be observed higher amounts of organic acids need to be produced and maintained. The results obtained in this study also showed that the type of kimberlite presents a different susceptibility to the dissolution process and the presence of the fungal cells may improve the leaching efficiency. The results in this study provided an optimistic base for the use of <b>microbial</b> <b>leaching</b> processes in accelerating the weathering of kimberlite. These findings may also serve to supply data to formulate recommendations for further and future column microbial leach tests as well as validation and simulation purposes...|$|E

40|$|This report {{documents}} {{results from}} a six-year study (1996 - 2001) that evaluated effects of liquid swine manure application management practices on soil nutrients, organic matter, pH, crop yield; and also discussed water quality implications. Swine manure management practices included single-rate (SR) and double-rate (DR) nitrogen (N) -based application rates (168 and 336 kg N ha- 1, respectively), three timings (fall injection [FI], winter broadcast [WB], and spring injection [SI]), and two methods (broadcast and injection) of liquid swine manure. Analysis of these practices involved comparing levels of residual soil total phosphorus (P) as Bray- 1 available P (RSP), residual soil nitrate-N (RSN), percent organic matter (OM%), pH, carbon:nitrogen (C:N) ratio, and crop yields (kg ha- 1) in a corn-soybean rotation. Results of this study indicated that long-term application of higher liquid swine manure rates during winter and spring application times resulted in significantly higher post-harvest accumulation of RSN and RSP in the soil profile, with no significant changes in soil OM%, pH, and C:N ratio. These results also showed that incorporation of swine manure during the spring application time produced significantly higher corn yields compared with fall and winter application times. Overall results suggest that while RSN and RSP content may be significantly higher from spring versus fall manure application times, N and P runoff losses and the potential threat to surface water quality may be substantially lower during spring and summer compared with fall and winter due to effects from crop nutrient uptake, <b>microbial</b> activity, <b>leaching,</b> and evapotranspiration during the growing season...|$|R

Au cours des essais, l'influence, sur la solubilisation des métaux, de la quantité de substrat (FeSO 4 × 7 H 2 O), du pourcentage d'inoculum et de la teneur en solides totaux a été suivie. La concentration de substrat n'a pas d'effet sur l'enlèvement du Cd, du Zn, du Mn et du Cu. Les taux d'enlèvement moyens pour le Cd, Zn et Mn, sont, après 46 heures, de 70 à 90 %, 90 à 100 % et 64 à 72 % pour des concentrations de substrat variant de 0 à 30 % FeSO 4 × 7 H 2 O (poids sec/poids sec).

Each year, more than 106 cubic metres of sediments must be dredged from the st-Lawrence river. The dredged sedirnents are generally dispersed in the water column. However, heavy metal contamination of these sediments may preclude open-water disposal and necessitate their confinement. The research work presented in this article applies to dredged sediments that are too contaminated for open-water disposal. In order to permit their safe disposal, it is necessary to have a method which effectively removes metals from these sediments. One of the effective methods of metal removal from contaminated sediments could be a microbial solubilization process, which was developed at INRS-Eau for sewage sludge decontamination and which has been tested on a pilot scale during the past year. In order to appty such a process to decontaminate sediments, it was necessary to study the influence of various factors affecting the <b>microbial</b> <b>leaching</b> process. This research verified the possibility of using a modified <b>microbial</b> <b>leaching</b> process to decontaminate sediments and also studied the influence of the enerry substrate, the microbial inoculum and the sediment total solids concentration on such a modified process. The experimental methodology consisted of mixing the contaminated sediment in a 500 ml Erlenmeyer flask for a period of 96 hours in the presence of thiobacillus inoculum and ferrous sulfate (FeSO 4 • 7 H 2 O) as the enerry substrate. Before each experiment sediments were adjusted to the desired total solids concentration with deionized water and were acidified with sulfuric acid to obtain the starting pH conditions. The solubilization of Cd, Cu, Zn and Mn was monitored at regular intervals in order to evaluate the influence of the various factors studied. Subsamples were removed, the sediments were digested and the metals were analyzed by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrophotometry (ICP-AES). The elements analyzed were Al, Ca, Cd, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mg, Mn, Ni, Pb,Zn as well as S, P and C. All the digestions and analyses performed made according to the APHA guidelines. The total solids, both volatile and inert, were also determined according to APHA method no. 209 F (APHA, 1985). Regarding the influence of the ferrous sulfate concentration on the application of the <b>microbial</b> <b>leaching</b> process, the removal rates of Cd, Zn and Mn did not vary more than 12 %. For all experiments, the final pH value approached 2, 5. The oxidation-reduction potential (ORP) varied for all experiments from 462 to 560 mV. An energy source could therefore be present in the sediments, which would support the growth of thiobacillus bacteria. During the experiments conducted to study the influence of inoculum concentration on the <b>microbial</b> <b>leaching</b> process, {{it was found that the}} pH decreased from 3. 5 to 2. 4 and the ORP increased from 284 to 593 mV when the inoculum addition increased from 0 to 30 % (v/v). This tendency was also observed during the removal of Cd and above all, Cu. Between 0 and 20 % (v/v) inoculum concentration, Cd removal increased from 64 to 86 % whereas Cu removal increased from 20 to 73 %. However, these two metals did not show any appreciable increase in solubilization when the inoculum was increased from 20 to 30 % (v/v). In the case of Mn, it was not possible to determine the solubilization pattern since the inoculum concentration did not influence the solubilization of this element, Between 0 and 30 % inoculum, the Mn removal varied from 56 to 73 %. Hence the microbial influence on Mn solubilization may be negligible. The study on the influence of total solids content on the <b>microbial</b> <b>leaching</b> process showed that the total solids concentration had an influence on pH and ORP. The final pH increased from 2. 43 to 3. 32 and ORP decreasedfrom 492 to 321 mV when the total solids content was varied from 3 to 15 %. The percent solubilization of Cd after 21 h was 7 l %, 69 %, 43 %, 44 % and, 24 % at 3, 5, 7, 10 and 15 % total solids respectively, On the other hand, Zn solubilization after 45 h was 94 %, 90 %, 84 %, 97 % and 8 l % for the same concentrations of total solids. An increase in total solids content decreased the solubilization efficiency of Cd (at t= 2 l h) and, to a lesser extent, Zn (att= 48 h). However,in the case of Mn, the maximum solubilization was achieved right at the beginning and varied little with time. Its solubilization varied between 61 and 70 % for 3 % total solids, between 67 and, 79 % for 5 % total dolids, between 52 and, 62 % for 7 % totaf solids, between 57 and, 75 % for l 0 % total solids and tretween 40 and 63 % for 15 % total solids. In general, for the sediments studied here, total solids content has little influence on Mn solubilization. In conclusion, use of a <b>microbial</b> <b>leaching</b> process to remove metals from contaminated sediments seems to be less complex than for sewage sludges, since the maximum removal of metals is achieved in less than 48 h in a bench-scale experiment. The average metal solubilization was above 80 % for Cd, 73 % for Cu, 90 % for Zn and 65 % for Mn. The development of thiobacillus does not seem to be dependent upon the presence of an added energy substrate. Only a minimal quantity of substrate, say 5 % ferrous sulfate (dry wt. /dry wt.), is required in order to assure optimal conditions for thiobacillus growth. It is probable that with time, without ferrous sulfate, the microbial conditions would deteriorate due to exhaustion ofthe enerry substrate. A 20 % microbial inoculum seems to be enough to assure an efficient metal solubilization process. Except for Mn, the increase in total solids concentration had a negative influence on the metal solubilization. It is hence preferable to work with a total solids concentration of less than 5 %. Nevertheless, it should be noted that this percentage is more than that used for sewage sludge decontaminaton (around 2 % total solids) ...|$|E
40|$|Chelate-enhanced {{phytoremediation}} {{has been}} proposed as an effective tool for the extraction of heavy metals from soils by plants. However, side-effects related to the addition of chelates, e. g. metal leaching and effects on soil micro-organisms, were usually neglected. Therefore, greenhouse and lysimeter studies were conducted to study the phytoremedation potential of EDGA and citric acid and to evaluate its effects on <b>microbial</b> activity and <b>leaching</b> of Cd, Zn Cu and Pb. Grass, lupine and yellow mustard were grown on a moderately polluted acid (pH 4. 5) sandy soil that contained 2 mg/kg Cd and 200 mg/kg Zn. Citric acid appeared to be degraded microbially {{within a few days}} after addition which limited its potential for long-lasting remediation studies. EDGA enhanced metal solubility but plant uptake did not increase accordingly. The metal shoot:root ratio increased upon addition of EDGA but it also reduced the net shoot and root biomass production of both lupine and yellow mustard. Bacterial biomass was higher in both the citric and EDGA treated pots but bacterial activity remained unaffected. The number of microbivorous nematodes was greatly reduced upon addition of EDGA which was most likely related to the reduced biomass production and, to a smaller extent, to the changes in the composition of the available food. Furthermore, EDGA enhanced metal leaching in the lysimeter study which could lead to groundwater pollution. To prevent these unwanted side-effects, careful management of phytoremediation methods, therefore, seems necessary...|$|R
40|$|A major {{challenge}} to the New Zealand’s growing dairy industry is to achieve an annual productivity gain of 4 % {{in order to remain}} internationally competitive. However, it is important to ensure that this productivity gain is achieved without significantly comprising the quality and integrity of New Zealand’s “clean and green” environment. There is increasing public concern about the effects of dairying on the environment, both within New Zealand and by our overseas customers. One of the main concerns is the possible threat to the quality of groundwater and surface water, particularly by nitrate, phosphate and <b>microbial</b> contaminants. Nitrate <b>leaching</b> from soil is of concern because of its impact on drinking water quality and the effects that nitrate can have on rivers and lakes. A high nitrate concentration in drinking water is a recognised health hazard and a high concentration in rivers and lakes can cause excessive growth of algae and weeds, which may reduce the fish population. Nitrate leaching also represents a financial cost to the farmer and a loss in soil fertility. The establishment of the new Lincoln University dairy farm is designed to enable us to develop and test practical methods to improve productivity {{and at the same time}} protect the environment. The objective of the environmental project on the new Lincoln University dairy farm is to develop best management practices under irrigation which will ensure that the dairy industry’s 4 % productivity gain is achieved in a sustainable way, and that the wider environment is protected...|$|R
40|$|This {{study shows}} that light {{exposure}} of flocculent material (floc) from the Florida Coastal Everglades (FCE) results in significant dissolved organic matter (DOM) generation through photo-dissolution processes. Floc was collected at two sites along the Shark River Slough (SRS) and irradiated with artificial sunlight. The DOM generated was characterized using elemental analysis and excitation emission matrix fluorescence coupled with parallel factor analysis. To investigate the seasonal variations of DOM photo-generation from floc, this experiment was performed in typical dry (April) and wet (October) seasons for the FCE. Our {{results show that the}} dissolved organic carbon (DOC) for samples incubated under dark conditions displayed a relatively small increase, suggesting that <b>microbial</b> processes and/or <b>leaching</b> might be minor processes in comparison to photo-dissolution for the generation of DOM from floc. On the other hand, DOC increased substantially (as much as 259 mgC gC− 1) for samples exposed to artificial sunlight, indicating the release of DOM through photo-induced alterations of floc. The fluorescence intensity of both humic-like and protein-like components also increased with light exposure. Terrestrial humic-like components were found to be the main contributors (up to 70 %) to the chromophoric DOM (CDOM) pool, while protein-like components comprised a relatively small percentage (up to 16 %) of the total CDOM. Simultaneously to the generation of DOC, both total dissolved nitrogen and soluble reactive phosphorus also increased substantially during the photo-incubation period. Thus, the photo-dissolution of floc can be an important source of DOM to the FCE environment, with the potential to influence nutrient dynamics in this system...|$|R
30|$|Metal {{removal from}} coal by {{bacteria}} occurs through leaching, adsorption and accumulation. Leaching mechanisms of metals through bacteria {{takes place in}} various ways such as, (i) the formation of organic or inorganic acids (protons); (ii) oxidation and reduction reactions; and (iii) the excretion of complexing agents (Berthelin 1983). The chief inorganic acid in leaching environments is sulphuric acid which is formed by sulfur-oxidizing microorganisms. However, a series of organic acids are produced by bacterial metabolism which leads to organic acidolysis, complex and chelate formation and facilitates metal removal (Berthelin 1983). After liberation of metals from coal or organic matter through <b>microbial</b> <b>leaching,</b> the processes like adsorption and accumulation of metals by bacteria becomes pronounced. The metal binding in adsorption occurs on the bacterial surface. This may occur {{on the surface of}} both living as well as non-living bacteria. Numerous negatively charged groups are present on the bacterial cell surface where the positively charged cations bind with them through electrical attraction. Subsequently, the cations are removed. Metal accumulation, in bacteria, refers to translocation of the cations which is a metabolic dependent process and takes place across the wall and membrane into the cell. There is specific transport system for metal ions which involves channels and pores of cell membrane. Polyphosphate body in bacteria works as metal sink (Gadd 2009; Kornberg 1995).|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Since metal {{extraction}} from sulfide ores by physicochemical methods {{is expensive}} and also {{detrimental to the}} environment, microorganisms, mainly bacteria are being increasingly used for desulfurization of sulfide minerals. <b>Microbial</b> <b>leaching</b> or bioleaching is an inexpensive and environmentally friendly technology for metal recovery. Materials and Methods: In the present study, to isolate iron and sulfur-oxidizing bacteria which are active in bioleaching process, spring water samples were collected and enriched by iron and sulfur-containing media. In order to identify the isolated bacteria, several morphological, physiological, biochemical and 16 S rDNA phylogenetical methods were implemented. Results: After several sub-cultures, a gram-positive spore-forming rod (NS strain) was isolated and then characterized. Sequence analysis of 16 S rDNA revealed that the isolated strain was closely related to Bacillus firmus strain IAM 12464 (99 %), that was capable to oxidize several sulphur and iron component such as: thiosulfate 5 %, elemental sulphur 3 %, sodium sulphate 3 %, pyrite 3 %, pyrrhotite 3 %, ferrous sulphate 4. 5 % and Iron powder 2 %. Also, this isolate could dissolve copper of SARCHESHME ore to copper sulphate and change the colour of medium to blue-green. The optimal growth of the isolate was observed at 25 °C and pH 4. Discussion and Conclusion: Due to the optimum pH and temperature, and the iron and sulphur oxidizing activity of this isolate, this bacterium together with a consortium of lithotrophic bacteria {{could be used in}} bioleaching processes...|$|E
40|$|Planetary {{materials}} contain {{signatures of}} diverse processes in their mineralogy, chemistry, textures and assemblages. The record contained in planetary materials reflects {{the complex and}} commonly overprinting relationships between many processes. Discerning what mechanisms have operated to produce the rocks we observe requires first a careful characterization of various properties. These include the chemical and structural makeup of the rocks (that is, the mineralogy and mineral chemistry), the textural relations within and between rocks (petrology) Therefore, the key to how the studies here hold together {{is also in the}} methodology and guiding philosophy: understanding what is there (what atoms and how they are arranged, what their interrelationships are) is the first step to unravelling the record of processes stored in planetary materials of all kinds. In this thesis, the tools of mineralogy and geochemistry/cosmochemistry and petrology have been used along with an understanding of the grand-scale astrophysical constraints on planetary formation to interpret diverse planetary materials: terrestrial rocks and meteorites. In this thesis, detailed mineralogical and chemical study of various planetary materials have enabled some new constraints to be placed on asteroidal melting and shock metamorphic processes, the nature of habitable environments in post-impact hydrothermal systems, and the preservation mechanisms of microbial ichnofossils in basaltic glass. These studies all concern the emergence and development of terrestrial planets and habitable environments within them, and the preservation of records of biological activity through deep geologic time. This work therefore represents, in a broad sense, an exploration of the astrobiological implications of planetary materials including likely precursors to terrestrial planets (enstatite chondrites); and important possible planetary habitats including post-impact hydrothermal mineral deposits and their associated weathering assemblages; and the fossilization of records of an ecosystem based on the <b>microbial</b> <b>leaching</b> of seafloor basaltic glass...|$|E

40|$|A {{principal}} {{goal of the}} Budget Period I was {{to demonstrate}} that surface geochemistry {{could be used to}} locate bypassed hydrocarbons in old fields. This part of the program was successful. A surface geochemical survey, employing 5 different techniques, was carried out in the Spring and Summer of 2000 and a demonstration well, the State Vernon & Smock 13 - 23 HD 1 (permit number: PN 53945) was drilled in Vernon Township, Isabella County, Michigan in the late fall of 2000. A demonstration well was selected and drilled based on geologic considerations and surface geochemistry. Over 460 soil samples were collected and analyzed over the drill site. A good anomaly was detected near the proposed well site and the demonstration well, the Smock 13 - 23, was drilled to a depth of 3157 feet by November 17, 2000. Two laterals were drilled, and hydrocarbons were located in a zone approximately 175 feet in length. However, it was determined that the pay zone was too small and difficult reservoir conditions (water production) prevented putting the well in production. The Smock 13 - 23 was shut in and abandoned January 15, 2001. A post-mortem determined that the main reason the well was not economic was because the zone was nearly completely flushed by earlier recovery operations. The post mortem also revealed the presence of an unmapped shale plug crossing the first lateral. It appears that this shale was detected by the geochemical survey, but its significance was not appreciated at the time. It is possible that sections of the well were faulty, ''porposing'' up and down so as to create water blockages. We are continuing to use the Vernon Field and the demonstration well to calibrate the geochemical data. Eventually, this study may provide a standard site {{that can be used to}} test and calibrate geochemical anomalies, something that does not presently exist. A postmortem report on the well, including the geology and geochemistry used to site the well, is presented in Appendix I. Five geochemical techniques have been tested in Phase I. These include surface iodine, <b>microbial,</b> enzyme <b>leaching,</b> soil gas and subsurface iodine. We are most comfortable with the results of the microbial surveys but feel that direct measurement of soil gas is the best method if analytical difficulties can be overcome. The reason the microbial surveys are presently favored is because they provide a logical, consistent picture that is easy to interpret and easy to explain. This in turn is because the microbial anomaly is manifested as an ''apical'' as opposed to an ''edge'' or ''halo'' anomaly. Several lessons were learned during Phase I activities. The main one was that surface geochemistry could locate anomalies over old fields such as Vernon. We also learned that horizontal drilling has advantages and disadvantages in situations such as this. On the plus side, it does provide a means to probe for pockets of bypassed oil, but it is expensive relative to vertical (or slant wells?) and is difficult to control in a narrow pay zone. We tentatively conclude that horizontal wells do not provide a cost-effective solution in this setting and suggest that geochemical anomalies be investigated via a single vertical well or multiple vertical wells...|$|R
