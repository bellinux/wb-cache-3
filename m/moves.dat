5|$|Most Pokémon {{evolve into}} other forms when certain {{conditions}} are met, {{such as when}} they reach a certain level—levels range from 1 to 100—or have a certain item used on them. They can learn up to four <b>moves,</b> including attacking <b>moves,</b> healing <b>moves,</b> and <b>moves</b> that inflict status conditions on the opponent. They have six stats that affect battle performance: maximum HP (hit points), Attack, Defense, Special Attack, Special Defense, and Speed. Attack and Special Attack are distinguished from Defense and Special Defense by the types of <b>moves</b> being considered: generally, <b>moves</b> involving physical exertion are physical, while <b>moves</b> involving supernatural or elemental powers are special. <b>Moves</b> are classed as one of seventeen types, (Normal, Water, Grass, Fire, Electric, Ghost, Bug, Fighting, Ice, Steel, Rock, Poison, Psychic, Dark, Dragon, Ground, and Flying); Pokémon can {{have one or two}} types. Generally, most of a Pokémon's <b>moves</b> correspond to its typing. A Pokémon's type makes it vulnerable or resistant to others; for example, Fire-type Pokémon are weak to Water-type <b>moves,</b> while Grass-type <b>moves</b> do little damage to them and Electric-type <b>moves</b> do normal damage.|$|E
5|$|The fifty-move {{rule was}} also added. At various times, {{the number of}} <b>moves</b> {{required}} was different, such as 24, 60, 70, or 75. For several years in the 20th century, the standard fifty <b>moves</b> was extended to one hundred <b>moves</b> for a few specific endgames (see Fifty-move rule's history).|$|E

5|$|A rook <b>moves</b> {{any number}} of vacant squares in a {{horizontal}} or vertical direction. It also is moved when castling.|$|E
5|$|According to the DTC metric, White should {{capture the}} rook because that leads {{immediately}} {{to a position}} which will certainly win (DTC = 1), {{but it will take}} two more <b>moves</b> actually to checkmate (DTM = 3). In contrast according to the DTM metric, White mates in two <b>moves,</b> so DTM = DTC = 2.|$|E
5|$|An {{artificial}} intelligence approach, designed by Jean-Marc Alliot of the Institut de recherche en informatique de Toulouse ("Toulouse Computer Science Research Institute"), which compares chess grandmaster <b>moves</b> against that of Stockfish—a chess engine which outperforms all human opponents—rated Carlsen {{as the best}} player of all time as he had the highest probability of all World Chess Champions to play the <b>moves</b> which Stockfish suggested.|$|E
50|$|Variations on {{this model}} include the Grand <b>Move,</b> <b>Move</b> Latte and <b>Move</b> Custom. <b>Move</b> Custom {{versions}} {{have been available}} in all generations of <b>Move,</b> it features a sportier look than does the original <b>Move</b> and is often equipped with sport rims and bodykits.|$|R

50|$|If the <b>move</b> {{assignment}} operator is not explicitly defined, the compiler generates an implicit <b>move</b> {{assignment operator}} (C++11 and newer). The parameter of a <b>move</b> assignment operator is an rvalue reference (T&&) to type T, where T {{is the object}} that defines the <b>move</b> assignment operator. The <b>move</b> assignment operator is different than a <b>move</b> constructor because a <b>move</b> assignment operator is called on an existing object, while a <b>move</b> constructor is called on an object created by the operation. Thereafter, the other object's data is no longer valid.|$|R

5|$|For example, Erik Pogosyants {{composed}} the study at right, with White {{to play and}} win. His intended main line was 1. Ne3 Rxh2 2. 0-0-0#! A tablebase discovered that 1. h4 also wins for White in 33 <b>moves,</b> even though Black can capture the pawn (which {{is not the best}} move – in case of capturing the pawn black loses in 21 <b>moves,</b> while Kh1-g2 loses in 32 <b>moves).</b> Incidentally, the tablebase does not recognize the composer's solution because it includes castling.|$|E
5|$|In {{terms of}} combat, the game allows players {{to create and}} {{customise}} their own move combos in the Combo Lab, which uses four categories of fighting <b>moves</b> called Pressens. This is done by chaining them together, made possible through earning PMP (Procedural Mastering Power), with a limit of four combos being active at any one time. The Pressen <b>moves</b> are Regen (healing), Power (damage), Chain (duplication and doubling of previous <b>moves)</b> and Cooldown (regeneration of S-Pressen energy). There are 50,000 possible Pressen combinations. Five S-Pressen <b>moves</b> will {{be made available to}} the player {{over the course of the}} game: the <b>moves</b> enable them to do things like stun groups of enemies, move at high speed and land more hits, or turn hostile robots into allies which then self-destruct. Players also have access to projectile-based weapons like the Spammer and Junk Bolt.|$|E
