40|$|In modern RF {{system on}} chips (SoCs), the digital content consumes up to 85 % of the IC chip area. The recent push to {{integrate}} multiple RF-SoC cores is met with heavy resistance by the remaining RF/analog circuitry, which creates numerous strong aggressors and weak victims leading to RF performance degradation. A key such mechanism is injection pulling through parasitic coupling between various $LC$-tank oscillators {{as well as}} between them and strong transmitter (TX) outputs. Any static or dynamic frequency proximity between aggressors (i. e., oscillators and TX outputs) and victims (i. e., oscillators) that share the same die causes injection pulling, which produces unwanted spurs and/or <b>modulation</b> <b>distortion.</b> In this paper, we propose and demonstrate a new frequency planning technique of a multicore TX where each $LC$-tank oscillator is separated from other aggressors beyond its pulling range. This is done by breaking the integer harmonic frequency relationship of victims/aggressors within and between the RF transmission channels using digital fractional divider based on a phase rotation. Each oscillator's center frequency can be fractionally separated by ~ 28 % but, at the same time, both producing closely spaced frequencies at the phase rotator outputs. The injection-pulling spurs are so far away that they are insignificantly small (- 80 dBc) and coincide with the second harmonic of the carrier.

An ever present issue when interfacing these sources {{is that of}} harmonic distortion reduction at the inter-tie point. One very interesting approach to reduce harmonic distortion is to synchronize power transistor operation for inverters operating in parallel. In this paper, a rarely employed technique for harmonic reduction using synchronized phase shifted parallel PWM inverters with current-sharing reactors is presented and analyzed. Using the technique presented inverter output distortion can be reduced significantly, for example total harmonic reduction can be reduced typically in half using just two synchronized phase-shifted parallel inverters (our simulation and experimental studies indicate that even smaller distortion reduction factors can be achieved). We present analyses for two and three phase-shifted inverters operated in parallel employing current sharing reactors. Our analyses consider {{the impact of a}} wide range of phase-shift delays on net output total harmonic distortion, with the phase-shift delay from zero to one entire cycle of the fundamental component. Some results are expected, such as a dramatic increase in distortion when the fundamental components between multiple inverters tend to cancel out, on the other hand it is interesting to observe a leveling-off, and gradual, smooth increase in the distortion reduction factor over a significant portion of the phase-shift delay variable.

40|$|CMOS {{circuits}} for integrated continuous-time analog filters, {{applicable to}} lo-bit resolution video-rate signal processing systems, are presented. The filters utilize transconductance-C integrators as fundamental building blocks. A differential transconductance element comprising a source-coupled pair with a poly-silicon degeneration resistor and a cross-coupled high-impedance load is described. With this transconductor, tunable integrators for very-high-frequency in-tegrated filters can be realized. Good high-speed properties {{stem from the}} absence of internal nodes, which pushes non-dominant poles to the gigahertz range. These integrators are optimized for the maximum dynamic-range of greater than 64 -dB, which occurs for input signal levels of 200 -mV. Dual feedback loops stabilize circuit performance against temperature- and process-variations. The resonant frequency of a master VCO, comprising back-to-back integrators, tracks the frequency of a stable reference clock by virtue of an on-chip PLL. The VCO control voltage is broadcast to all matched transconductors, thus accurately controlling the natural frequencies of the filter. A separate Q-tuning loop controls the dissipation of the integrator, thus insuring a. 90 -degree phase shift at the resonant frequency. Experimental results of a l 0 -MHz, 60 -dB dynamic-range, 4 th-Order Butterworth lowpass filter, realized in a O. 8 μm CMOS process, are given.

40|$|The {{waveforms}} of {{the emerging}} communication systems aiming at high data rates and high spectral efficiencies {{are becoming more and}} more complex and thereon also sensitive to many implementation nonidealities. One good example is multicarrier waveforms having high peak- to-average power ratio (PAPR) and thus high sensitivity to any nonlinearity in the radio components such as transmitter power amplifier (PA). On the other hand, when emphasizing power efficiency, power amplifiers operate typically close to their saturation region and are thus heavily nonlinear. Such power efficient operation is especially important in handheld terminal equipment but also on the base-station side of, e. g., cellular systems. Thus efficient linearization of power amplifiers is seen as one essential element in obtaining proper compromise between power efficiency and spectral efficiency in the emerging communications systems. Various approaches have been proposed and demonstrated for power amplifier linearization in the literature, among which the so-called feedforward approach is one of the most established ones. Feedforward linearizer builds on two stages, the so-called signal cancellation loop (SCL) and error cancellation loop (ECL), which aim at isolating and subtracting the distortion created by the PA from the overall linearizer output. In practice, however, the operation of feedforward linearizer is susceptible, e. g., to any parameter mismatches in the SCL and ECL components. Also the characteristics of the PA can change in time when the operating conditions or operating point are varying. Adaptive feedforward linearizer is a promising linearization method that is able to adjust the signal cancellation loop and error cancellation loop coefficients to minimize the effects of component mismatch and to track the possible variations in the characteristics of the circuit components. In this thesis, the performance of least-mean squares (LMS) adaptation in terms of steady-state SCL and ECL coefficient behavior and the corresponding suppression of inter- <b>modulation</b> <b>distortion</b> (IMD) are studied, covering both memoryless PA's and PA's with memory. The analysis shows that the adaptive feedforward linearizer is independent from memory effects in terms of IMD suppression even though convergence of SCL coefficient is affected by memory. An estimate for the final IMD suppression is driven for the memoryless amplifier model and it also holds for the model with memory under reasonable assumptions. The findings of the analysis are supported with simulation results. /Kir 1...|$|E

40|$|Work {{continues}} on estimating tilt <b>modulation</b> <b>distortions</b> in the wave topography {{measured by a}} scanning radar altimeter. To quantify this effect, a two-dimensional simulation has been performed in the cross-track plane only which assumed that sinusoidal waves of constant wavelength propagate in the cross-track direction (and are infinitely long-crested in the along-track direction). The initial results reported earlier for a Gaussian surface scattering model indicated that when the highest reasonable value of mss {{is used in the}} simulation (the Plant limit of 0. 08), the nadir values of the ratio of the apparent to actual wave height are the same as for the omnidirectional scattering case. But as the off-nadir angle increased, the apparent wave height increased and became larger than the actual wave height by about 10 degrees off-nadir. And the shorter the wavelength, the larger the apparent wave height increase. This represented a systematic over-estimate of the wave amplitude for waves propagating in the cross-track direction. For lower values of mss the situation worsened. The simulation has been improved by incorporating actual variations of backscattered power with incidence angle measured by the SRA instead of the Gaussian model. The resulting distortion was about half that originally reported. The 3 -dimensional simulation to model waves propagating at various azimuthal angles relative to the cross-track plane is still in progress. The results of this model will be verified by comparing them with Scanning Radar Altimeter (SRA) data and optimum correction procedures will be developed. An assessment of the improved 2 -dimensional model indicates that the distortion will generally be small in the data taken during the Southern Ocean Waves Experiment (SOWEX) presently be analyzed. But tilt modulation effects are of great concern for SRA data collected during the 1998 hurricane season since the minimum aircraft altitude was 1. 5 km and it frequently flew higher.
