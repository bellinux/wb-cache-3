5|$|A {{task force}} of the International Parkinson and <b>Movement</b> <b>Disorder</b> Society (MDS) has {{proposed}} diagnostic criteria for Parkinson’s disease as well as research criteria for the diagnosis of prodromal disease, but these will require validation against the more established criteria.|$|E
5|$|Like {{the other}} neuroacanthocytosis {{syndrome}}s, McLeod syndrome causes <b>movement</b> <b>disorder,</b> cognitive impairment and psychiatric symptoms. The particular features of McLeod syndrome are heart {{problems such as}} arrhythmia and dilated cardiomyopathy (enlarged heart).|$|E
5|$|Conditions {{that must}} be {{considered}} in a differential diagnosis along with ADHD include other ASDs, the schizophrenia spectrum, personality disorders, obsessive–compulsive disorder, major depressive disorder, semantic pragmatic disorder, nonverbal learning disorder, social anxiety disorder, Tourette syndrome, stereotypic <b>movement</b> <b>disorder,</b> bipolar disorder, social-cognitive deficits due to brain damage from alcohol abuse, and obsessive–compulsive personality disorder (OCPD).|$|E
40|$|The Task Force for Nomenclature of Genetic <b>Movement</b> <b>Disorders</b> {{recently}} {{proposed a}} new system of naming genetically determined <b>movement</b> <b>disorders.</b> 1 These recommendations apply to a wide spectrum of <b>movement</b> <b>disorders,</b> including parkinsonisms, dystonias, choreas, paroxysmal <b>movement</b> <b>disorders,</b> cerebellar ataxias, and spastic paraplegias.

40|$|The use {{of animal}} models {{is a key}} aspect of {{scientific}} research in numerous fields of medicine. <b>Movement</b> <b>Disorders,</b> Second Edition vigorously examines the important contributions and application of animal models {{to the understanding of}} human <b>movement</b> <b>disorders,</b> and serves as an essential resource for basic neuroscientists engaged in <b>movement</b> <b>disorders</b> research. Academic clinicians, translational researchers and basic scientists are brought together to connect experimental findings made in different animal models to the clinical features, pathophysiology and treatment of human <b>movement</b> <b>disorders.</b> A vital feature of this book is an ancillary website with video clips of human <b>movement</b> <b>disorders</b> and their corresponding animal models. The book is divided into sections on Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, dystonia, tremor, paroxysmal <b>movement</b> <b>disorders,</b> ataxia, myoclonus, restless legs syndrome, drug-induced <b>movement</b> <b>disorders,</b> multiple system atrophy, progressive supranuclear palsy/corticobasal degeneration, and spasticity.

5|$|Diagnosis of {{epilepsy}} can be difficult. A {{number of}} other conditions may present very similar signs and symptoms to seizures, including syncope, hyperventilation, migraines, narcolepsy, panic attacks and psychogenic non-epileptic seizures (PNES). In particular a syncope can {{be accompanied by a}} short episode of convulsions. Nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy, often misdiagnosed as nightmares, was considered to be a parasomnia but later identified to be an epilepsy syndrome. Attacks of the <b>movement</b> <b>disorder</b> paroxysmal dyskinesia may be taken for epileptic seizures. The cause of a drop attack can be, among many others, an atonic seizure.|$|E
5|$|However, the {{widespread}} use of antipsychotic drugs has long been controversial. There are several reasons for this. First, antipsychotic drugs are perceived as very aversive by people who have to take them, because they produce a general dullness of thought and suppress the ability to experience pleasure. Second, it is difficult to show that they act specifically against psychotic behaviors rather than merely suppressing all types of active behavior. Third, they can produce a range of serious side effects, including weight gain, diabetes, fatigue, sexual dysfunction, hormonal changes, and a type of serious <b>movement</b> <b>disorder</b> known as tardive dyskinesia. Some of these side effects may continue long after the cessation of drug use, or even permanently.|$|E
25|$|Tics must be {{distinguished}} from movements of other movement disorders such as chorea, dystonia, myoclonus; movements exhibited in stereotypic <b>movement</b> <b>disorder</b> or some autistic people, and the compulsions of obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD) and seizure activity.|$|E
50|$|Hypokinetic <b>movement</b> <b>disorders</b> {{refer to}} {{akinesia}} (lack of movement), hypokinesia (reduced amplitude of movements), bradykinesia (slow movement) and rigidity. In primary <b>movement</b> <b>disorders,</b> the abnormal <b>movement</b> {{is the primary}} manifestation of the <b>disorder.</b> In secondary <b>movement</b> <b>disorders,</b> the abnormal <b>movement</b> is a manifestation of another systemic or neurological disorder.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Movement</b> <b>disorders</b> are {{clinical}} syndromes {{with either}} {{an excess of}} movement or a paucity of voluntary and involuntary movements, unrelated to weakness or spasticity. [...] <b>Movement</b> <b>disorders</b> are synonymous with basal ganglia or extrapyramidal diseases. [...] <b>Movement</b> <b>disorders</b> are conventionally divided into two major categories- hyperkinetic and hypokinetic.|$|R
40|$|Non-ketotic {{hyperglycemia}} (NKHG) {{may increase}} the probability of seizures and <b>movement</b> <b>disorders.</b> We describe a series of 14 elders admitted for seizures and <b>movement</b> <b>disorders</b> linked to NKHG. Twelve patients developed motor seizures and two others <b>movement</b> <b>disorders.</b> Glucose levels varied 9. 28 to 32 mmol/l, while osmolarity values varied from 302. 28 to 328 mosmol/l. All patients responded well to insulin therapy and four of them needed anti-epileptic drugs. Seizures or <b>movement</b> <b>disorders</b> in elderly with NKHG could be misdiagnosed as neurological diseases. Blood glucose must be audited whenever patients with seizures or <b>movement</b> <b>disorders</b> are encountered, as the condition may quickly resolve when NKHG is controlled...|$|R
25|$|More rare manifestations are acute confusional state, Guillain–Barré syndrome, aseptic meningitis, {{autonomic}} disorder, demyelinating syndrome, mononeuropathy (which might manifest as mononeuritis multiplex), <b>movement</b> <b>disorder</b> (more specifically, chorea), myasthenia gravis, myelopathy, cranial neuropathy and plexopathy.|$|E
25|$|Other {{problems}} {{to be considered in}} the differential diagnosis include selective mutism, stereotypic <b>movement</b> <b>disorder</b> and bipolar disorder as well as traumatic brain injury or birth trauma, conduct disorder, Cornelia De Lange syndrome, fetal alcohol syndrome, fragile X syndrome, dyslexia, Fahr syndrome, hyperlexia, leukodystrophy, multiple sclerosis and Triple X syndrome.|$|E
25|$|Clonazepam, {{sold under}} {{the brand name}} Klonopin among others, is a {{medication}} used to prevent and treat seizures, panic disorder, and for the <b>movement</b> <b>disorder</b> known as akathisia. It is a tranquilizer of the benzodiazepine class. It is taken by mouth. It begins having an effect within an hour and lasts between six and 12 hours.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} {{several aspects of}} <b>movement</b> <b>disorders</b> in {{patients}} with schizophrenia and in their unaffected siblings. The main hypothesis is that <b>movement</b> <b>disorders</b> are not just side effects of antipsychotic medication but may also be symptoms of the illness itself and {{are related to the}} (genetic) risk of developing the disease. To address these questions a systematic literature search was followed by a clinical prevalence and association study of <b>movement</b> <b>disorders</b> with schizotypy in siblings of patients with schizophrenia, and a candidate gene study of <b>movement</b> <b>disorders</b> in patients using antipsychotic medication. Further, we developped a mechanical instrument and examined whether mechanical measurement of lingual force variability reflects tardive tongue dyskinesia and whether mechanical measurement of <b>movement</b> <b>disorders</b> in siblings of patients with schizophrenia is more sensitive than clinical rating scales. The results of this thesis suggest that <b>movement</b> <b>disorders</b> are associated to antipsychotic naïve patients with schizophrenia and are also more prevalent in their unaffected siblings compared to controls. This could imply that <b>movement</b> <b>disorders</b> represent symptoms of schizophrenia and may be markers of vulnerability of developing the disease. In addition the results of this thesis indicate that in siblings of patients with schizophrenia, mechanical instruments may also be more sensitive for detecting subclinical <b>movement</b> <b>disorders</b> than traditional clinician-based rating scales...|$|R
40|$|Chorea and ballism are <b>movement</b> <b>disorders</b> {{that result}} {{from a variety of}} conditions. Hyperglycemia is an unusual {{recognized}} cause of these <b>movement</b> <b>disorders.</b> We report 3 cases of new-onset choreaballism induced by nonketotic hyperglycemia in elderly patients, highlighting that chorea may be the first manifestation of undiagnosed decompensated diabetes mellitus.

25|$|Sleep {{disorders}} include narcolepsy, periodic limb <b>movement</b> <b>disorder</b> (PLMD), restless leg syndrome (RLS), {{upper airway}} resistance syndrome (UARS), and the circadian rhythm sleep disorders. Fatal familial insomnia, or FFI, an extremely rare genetic disease with no known treatment or cure, {{is characterized by}} increasing insomnia {{as one of its}} symptoms; ultimately sufferers of the disease stop sleeping entirely, before dying of the disease.|$|E
25|$|Haloperidol {{may result}} in a <b>movement</b> <b>disorder</b> known as tardive {{dyskinesia}} which may be permanent. Neuroleptic malignant syndrome and QT interval prolongation may occur. In older people with psychosis due to dementia it results in an increased risk of death. When taken during pregnancy it {{may result in}} problems in the infant. It should not be used in people with Parkinson's disease.|$|E
25|$|Parkinson's disease, a slowly {{progressing}} <b>movement</b> <b>disorder,</b> {{is thought}} to be caused by certain neurotoxins. A neurotoxin called MPTP (1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine), the precursor to MPP+, was found and linked to Parkinson's disease in the 1980s. The active neurotoxins destroy dopaminergic neurons, leading to parkinsonism and Parkinson's disease. Several tetrahydroisoquinoline derivatives have been found to have the same neurochemical properties as MPTP. These derivatives may act as neurotoxin precursors to active neurotoxins.|$|E

40|$|Background. <b>Movement</b> <b>disorders</b> fellowships are an {{important}} source of future clinician-specialists and clinician-scientists for the field. Scant published information exists on the number and characteristics of North American <b>movement</b> <b>disorders</b> fellowship training programs. Methods. A 31 -item internet-based survey was formulated and distributed to academic <b>movement</b> <b>disorders</b> listed in the American Academy of Neurology (AAN) directory as having a <b>movement</b> <b>disorders</b> fellowship and to all National Parkinson Foundation Centers of Excellence and Care Centers in North America. Results. There was a 77 % response rate among academic <b>movement</b> <b>disorders</b> centers. Broad similarities in clinical training were identified. The two most important rated missions of maintaining a <b>movement</b> <b>disorders</b> fellowship were contributions to scholarly activities and to fulfilling a critical need for specialists. Almost a quarter of fellowship programs did not offer a fellowship slot during the most recent academic year. Fellowship directors cited a wide variety of funding sources, but their top concern was lack of available funding for fellowship programs. Conclusions. North American <b>movement</b> <b>disorders</b> fellowship training programs currently offer similar methods of clinical training and education. Lack of funding was the most important obstacle to maintaining fellowship programs and should be made a priority for discussion in the field...|$|R

25|$|Free {{radicals}} {{may also}} be involved in Parkinson's disease, senile and drug-induced deafness, schizophrenia, and Alzheimer's. The classic free-radical syndrome, the iron-storage disease hemochromatosis, is typically associated with a constellation of free-radical-related symptoms including <b>movement</b> <b>disorder,</b> psychosis, skin pigmentary melanin abnormalities, deafness, arthritis, and diabetes mellitus. The free-radical theory of aging proposes that free radicals underlie the aging process itself. Similarly, the process of mitohormesis suggests that repeated exposure to free radicals may extend life span.|$|E
25|$|Dystonia is a <b>movement</b> <b>disorder</b> {{in which}} involuntarily {{sustained}} or intermittent muscle contractions cause twisting or repetitive movements, abnormal postures, or both. Such abnormal postures include foot inversion, wrist ulnar deviation, or lordotic trunk twisting. They can be localized to specific {{parts of the}} body or be generalized to many different muscle groups. These postures are often sustained {{for long periods of time}} and can be combined in time. Dystonic movements can augment hyperkinetic movements, especially when linked to voluntary movements.|$|E
25|$|Clozapine is {{associated}} with a relatively high risk of low white blood cells which may result in death. To decrease this risk it is recommended that the blood be regularly monitored. Other serious risks include seizures, inflammation of the heart, high blood sugar levels, and, in older people with psychosis as a result of dementia, an increased risk of death. Common side effects include drowsiness, dry mouth, low blood pressure, trouble seeing, and dizziness. The potentially permanent <b>movement</b> <b>disorder</b> tardive dyskinesia occurs in about 5% of people. Its mechanism of action is not entirely clear.|$|E

25|$|Common {{side effects}} include {{movement}} problems, sleepiness, trouble seeing, constipation, and increased weight. Serious side effects may include the potentially permanent <b>movement</b> <b>disorder</b> tardive dyskinesia, {{as well as}} neuroleptic malignant syndrome, {{an increased risk of}} suicide, and high blood sugar levels. In older people with psychosis as a result of dementia, it may increase the risk of dying. It is unclear if it is safe for use in pregnancy. Risperidone is an atypical antipsychotic. Its mechanism of action is not entirely clear, but is believed to be related to its action as a dopamine antagonist.|$|E
25|$|Side effects include {{neuroleptic}} malignant syndrome, a <b>movement</b> <b>disorder</b> {{known as}} tardive dyskinesia, {{and high blood}} sugar in those with diabetes. In the elderly there is {{an increased risk of}} death. It is thus not recommended for use in those with psychosis due to dementia. It is pregnancy category C in the United States and category C in Australia, meaning there is possible evidence of harm to the fetus. It is not recommended for women who are breastfeeding. It is unclear whether it is safe or effective in people less than 18 years old.|$|E
25|$|Common {{side effects}} include {{movement}} problems, sleepiness, dry mouth, low blood pressure upon standing, and increased weight.
