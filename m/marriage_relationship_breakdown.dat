40|$|In January of 2001 the Government {{announced}} {{its intention to}} repeal Part 11 of the Family Law Act 1996. Originally scheduled for implementation in 2000, the Act had provided for fundamental changes to English divorce law, including removing matrimonial 'fault' from the divorce process, and encouraging mediation as the preferred method of dispute resolution. The Family Law Act began life {{as a set of}} recommendations intended primarily to bring marriages to an end with minimum hostility and distress. Yet what emerged from the policy 'process' was a piece of legislation that explicitly declared its support for marriage, and which imposed a framework of mechanisms designed to encourage couples to stay together. The first 'phase' of this thesis examines how the Act, with its dual aims of supporting and ending marriage, was reached. Initially the history of divorce law is traced. Through a series of interviews conducted with individuals involved in the Family Law Act 'process', the achievement of this 'middle-way' is then explored in detail. The second 'phase', drawing on a series of interviews conducted with individuals working with families on the ground, subsequently goes on to examine the 'street-level' response to <b>marriage</b> and <b>relationship</b> <b>breakdown.</b> Whilst national policy is something of a compromise between idealism and pragmatism, for those at street-level their work is unambiguously pragmatic - policy is constructed primarily in terms of a non-judgemental 'service' catering to the diversity of the modern family experience. The apparent success of this approach, particularly when compared to the 'failure' of the Family Law Act, prompts the question of whether there are lessons to be learnt for national policy. Indeed the study suggests that a new mind-set and approach akin to that operating on the ground is also needed at national level, if workable divorce law reform is to be achieved...|$|R
40|$|In {{the field}} of <b>marriage</b> and <b>relationships</b> {{research}} there has tended to be a preoccupation with <b>relationship</b> <b>breakdown</b> and dissolution, obscuring the body of literature that explores the reasons why many marriages are enduring, satisfying and happy. Drawing on this literature, Robyn Parker discusses some {{of what is known}} about why many marriages last for very long periods and considers how knowledge {{of the ways in which}} marriages can be made to last can help young couples create and maintain their own enduring and rewarding marriages...|$|R

40|$|<b>Relationship</b> <b>breakdown</b> has {{economic}} costs: one household {{is split}} into two, and its income is also divided. The costs are disproportionately borne by women, who often {{lose more than}} half the household’s income yet retain the majority of the financial responsibility for children. The negative financial shock of <b>relationship</b> <b>breakdown</b> is, however, rarely permanent. In the short term, separated women may benefit from social welfare policies and receive private transfer payments including child support. As time passes, if repartnering occurs this can aid the economic recovery process. A recent analysis of the British Household Panel Survey (BHPS) and the Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia (HILDA) Survey has revealed new insights into the interaction between institutional support, including welfare payments and child support rules, and repartnering as a way of mitigating the negative economic shock of <b>relationship</b> <b>breakdown.</b>   • Dr Hayley Fisher is a Lecturer in the School of Economics at the University of Sydney...|$|R

40|$|An {{association}} between divorce and suicide risk {{has been noted}} in numerous studies, but the gender profile of this risk has not been clearly established. This article reviews the evidence on gender differentials in suicide risk following the breakdown of an intimate relationship (including divorce and separation). Nineteen published articles that included individuallevel data were identified. Twelve reported {{a greater risk of}} suicide in men following <b>relationship</b> <b>breakdown,</b> two indicated a greater risk in women, and a further five showed no clear gender differential. Although there are possible indications of increased risk for men, no definitive conclusion about gender differential can be drawn. Furthermore, research is required that directly compares men with women for suicide risk following <b>relationship</b> <b>breakdown...</b>|$|R

Patients often comment that they never anticipated such situations as a <b>relationship</b> <b>breakdown</b> or death (of their partner or child) may affect their situation.

40|$|Marriage is a {{universal}} social institution through which an adult male and an adult female usually involves in <b>marriage</b> <b>relationship</b> and may perpetuate it to meet their reciprocal sexual, emotional, and material needs across the marital life cycle. Relevant literatures reviewed suggested {{that most of the}} studies on <b>marriage</b> <b>relationship</b> between Muslim and Santal communities in Bangladesh were culture-specific. In order to fulfill the knowledge gap {{purpose of the study was}} to explore and compare <b>marriage</b> <b>relationship,</b> including marital bond development, sexual behavior, and role relationship between Muslim and Santal communities in rural Bangladesh. For this research purpose 100 couples (70 couples for the Muslim and 30 couples for the Santal) out of 380 couples were randomly selected by cluster sampling procedure from the Kalna village situated in the Tanore Upazila of Rajshahi district, Bangladesh. In so doing in-depth interview method with semi-structural questionnaire: Open and close-ended questions was applied for necessary data collection. The collected data were analyzed by Independent Sample T-test to compare <b>marriage</b> <b>relationship,</b> especially marital bond development, marital sexual behavior and marital role relationship between the communities’ couples. The results of the Independent Sample t test showed that there were significant differences in age at marriage for women, sexual frequency, and role relationships among the couples selected between the communities in rural Bangladesh. This study recommends that further cross-cultural research should be done on marital power relationship and marital adjustment across the couples’ life cycle between the two ethnic communities in Bangladesh...|$|R

40|$|Before the 2009 {{decision}} in Callow v Rupchev, {{there were three}} circumstances in which an occupation fee would be payable by a co-owner to another co-owner. In Callow v Rupchev the NSW Court of Appeal found a further circumstance in which occupation rent can be claimed — cases of <b>relationship</b> <b>breakdown</b> {{where there is no}} 'attributable fault' by either party. This further ground is to be distinguished from actual ouster and constructive ouster. This article explores the context in which this decision was made, and reviews previous decisions relating to claims for occupation rent occurring within a <b>relationship</b> <b>breakdown.</b> To the extent that the doctrine of ouster has traditionally represented a particular {{understanding of the nature of}} an undivided proprietary interest inland, this article assesses whether this approach flags a transition in our understanding of the concept of property to mirror a more contemporary picture of society...|$|R
