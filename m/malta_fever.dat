He recalled this time as a [...] "twilight period" [...] when [...] "no-one wanted to know about us" [...] and many good people were let go due to the government's parsimonious retention policies. In 1947, Hancock was promoted to air commodore and appointed inaugural commandant of the newly formed RAAF College, Point Cook, the Air Force's equivalent of Duntroon and the Royal Australian Naval College. He also drafted the institution's charter. Departing in late 1949, he spent the following year in Britain, where he attended the Imperial Defence College. On his return to Australia in 1951, he was promoted to acting air vice marshal and made Deputy Chief of the Air Staff. He was raised to a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 1953 New Years Honours. In October that year, Hancock took over from Air Vice Marshal Frank Bladin as Air Member for Personnel (AMP). As AMP, he occupied a seat on the Air Board, the service's controlling body that consisted of its most senior officers and which was chaired by the Chief of the Air Staff.

5000|$|At {{the time}} of his service in Malta, British {{soldiers}} suffered an outbreak of what was called the <b>Malta</b> <b>fever.</b> In 1886, he led the <b>Malta</b> <b>Fever</b> Commission that identified the organism that caused the fever as a bacterium Micrococcus melitensis (later renamed Brucella melitensis). [...] Themistocles Zammit, {{one of the members of}} the commission, discovered the reason behind Mediterranean fever in 1905. Bruce discouraged the experiments being carried by Zammit and doubted his ability as a microbiologist. Eventually, when he learned of the positive results linking the fever with unpasteurized goat milk, Bruce tried to discredit the role of Zammit and take credit to himself. To a certain extent he succeeded, as it was renamed after him as brucellosis, however information about the role of Zammit has eventually surfaced.|$|E
50|$|Brucella melitensis is a Gram-negative {{coccobacillus}} bacterium {{from the}} Brucellaceae family. The bacterium causes ovine brucellosis, along with Brucella ovis.

5000|$|The popular name [...] "undulant fever" [...] {{originates}} {{from the}} characteristic undulance (or [...] "wave-like" [...] nature) of the fever, which {{rises and falls}} over weeks in untreated patients.

Sir David Bruce isolated B. melitensis from British soldiers who died from <b>Malta</b> <b>fever</b> in Malta. After exposure to Brucella, humans generally have a two- to four-week latency period before exhibiting symptoms, which include acute undulating fever (>90% of all cases), headache, arthralgia (>50%), night sweats, fatigue, and anorexia. Later complications may include arthritis or epididymo-orchitis, spondylitis, neurobrucellosis, liver abscess formation, and endocarditis, the latter potentially fatal.|$|E
50|$|She was {{met with}} skepticism, {{particularly}} {{because she was a}} woman and did not have a Ph.D. She warned that raw milk should be pasteurized to protect people from various diseases.

40|$|AbstractObjectivesNumerous {{studies have}} {{reported}} the epidemiological and clinical features of <b>Malta</b> <b>fever</b> incidence in Iran. Review and synthesis of the related literature through meta-analysis can provide an appropriate measurement for aforementioned indices. Therefore, the present study aimed to determine the epidemiological and clinical features of people with <b>Malta</b> <b>fever</b> in Iran. MethodsThe required documents were obtained through searching national and international databases. In each study, standard deviation of the indices was calculated using binomial distribution formulas. Finally, the heterogeneity index was determined between studies using Cochran (Q) and I 2 tests. ResultsCombining the results of 47 articles in the meta-analysis indicated that 57. 6 % (55. 02 – 60. 1 %) and 42. 3 % (49. 8 – 44. 9 %) of the patients were male and female, respectively. Most of the patients lived in rural areas; 68. 4 % (63. 6 – 73. 2 %) compared to 31. 4 % (26. 7 – 36. 3 %). In addition, 20. 8 % (17. 4 – 24. 2 %) of the patients were ranchers and farmers, 16. 9 % (14. 5 – 19. 4 %) were students, and 31. 6 % (27 – 36. 2 %) were housewives. Of the patients studies, 50. 5 % (35. 6 – 65. 2 %) experienced contact with animals and 57. 1 % (46. 4 – 67. 9 %) used unpasteurized dairy products. Fever, joint pain, and sweating were detected among 65. 7 % (53. 7 – 77. 8 %) and 55. 3 % (44. 4 – 66. 2 %), respectively. ConclusionThe present study revealed that the frequency of male patients with brucellosis was considerably more than that of female patients. The number of patients with <b>Malta</b> <b>fever</b> in rural areas was significantly more than in urban areas. High-risk behavior, unprotected contact with animals, and using unpasteurized dairy products {{were among the most}} significant factors affecting <b>Malta</b> <b>fever</b> incidence in Iran.

40|$|Background and Objectives : <b>Malta</b> <b>fever,</b> a {{zoonosis}} disease, {{which is}} a common health problem among people of East Azerbaijan, has imposed sanitary and economic damage to the society. The {{purpose of this study}} was to determine the effect of interventions based on the need and epidemiological characteristics to control brucellosis in Charoaymaq city. Materials and Methods : This is a descriptive-analytic study which was conducted by collecting the information and applying interventions on the suspected patients of <b>Malta</b> <b>fever</b> in Charoaymaq. A reliable questionnaire, approved by the Iranian Ministry of Health and Medical Education was used for data collecting.   According to the epidemiological situation of <b>Malta</b> <b>fever</b> in the region, some interventions such as providing face to face education to the patients and their families, establishing cooperation with organizations that play role on fighting with <b>Malta</b> <b>fever</b> were designed and applied. Follow up of the patients were conducted and then, the incidence and prevalence of the disease were investigated. Results : During the three years of the study (85 to 87) alongside with applying the interventions, the incidence of the disease was investigated. Among all registered patients (360 cases), 160 cases in year 85, 114 cases in year 86 and 86 case in year 87 were reported. From all of these cases, 40 cases were repeated  relapsed as follows: 36 cases in year 85, 2 cases in year 86 and 2 cases in year 87. Information about age, occupation, place of residence, gender, history of contact with animals, history of dairy products use, incidence season and results of Wright's test were studied on the patients. From all of the cases, male patients by % 55, patients living in villages by % 78, patients  with  animal contact history by % 99, patients  with a history of dairy products use by % 94,  housekeeper patients with % 27. 5, patients from age group 31 - 50 years with % 23 / 3 had highest rate of <b>Malta</b> <b>fever</b> infection. Furthermore, the highest identification and incidence season was during spring with % 43. 3 of cases and majority of the cases (% 68. 1) had been identified with the results of Wright's test by 1. 640. Conclusion : The results of this study shows that designing prevention programs should be considered alongside with epidemiological factors involved in incidence of disease within the region. Considering the results of primary assessment, this study was performed based on interventions tailored for groups at risk for three years that resulted in reducing the number of patients and repeated (relapse) cases of the diseas...|$|E
