60|$|The {{whole of}} our run from Rio to the Line was one {{delightful}} yachting, {{so far as}} fine weather and the ship's sailing were concerned. It was especially pleasant when our quarter-watch lounged in the main-top, diverting ourselves in many agreeable ways. Removed from the immediate presence of the officers, we there harmlessly enjoyed ourselves, more {{than in any other}} part of the ship.

60|$|Christmas {{fell upon}} Monday of that year, 1769. There {{was to be}} a ball at Upper Marlboro on the Friday before, to which <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>were</b> invited. Though the morning came in with a {{blinding}} snowstorm from the north, the first of that winter, about ten of the clock we set out from Annapolis an exceeding merry party, the ladies in four coaches-and-six, the gentlemen and their servants riding at the wheels. We laughed and joked despite the storm, and exchanged signals with the fair ones behind the glasses.|$|E
6000|$|Yes, {{he stood}} there like a man behind a great stone upon the brow of a mountain, slowly, remorselessly, with {{infinite}} skill, labour, and patience, pushing that stone {{to the edge of}} the cliff, whence at length, in the appointed hour, it would thunder down upon those who dwelt beneath, to leave them crushed and no more a people. How could I guess that we, the actors in this play, were all the while helping him to push that stone, and that he cared nothing how <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>were</b> carried with it into the abyss, if only we brought about the triumph of his secret, unutterable rage and hate? ...|$|E
6000|$|It was {{a miracle}} that every soul of us was not drowned that moment, as <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>were.</b> The {{swirling}} eddy which followed as the Vindhya sank swamped two of the boats, and carried down not {{a few of those}} who were standing on the deck with us. The last I saw of the first officer was a writhing form whirled about in the water; before he sank, he shouted aloud, with a seaman's frank courage, [...] "Say it was all my fault; I accept the responsibility. I ran her too close. I am the only one to blame for it." [...] Then he disappeared in the whirlpool caused by the sinking ship, and we were left still struggling.|$|E

Believing, moreover, that I had been drowned in the shipwreck at Melita, {{he was about to}} make a will bequeathing his property to the Emperor Nero, but by good fortune of this he had said nothing. Had he done so I should, I think, be as poor to-day as when I left you, dear, and perhaps poorer still, for I might have lost my head with my inheritance.|$|E
6000|$|... "Now behold {{what this}} mate did. As we came down upon him, {{covering}} {{the sea and}} blowing our conches, he put off from the schooner in the small boat, along with the three black boys, and rowed for the passage. There again he was a fool, for no wise man would put out to sea in so small a boat. The sides of it were not four inches above the water. Twenty canoes went after him, filled with two hundred young men. We paddled five fathoms while his black boys were rowing one fathom. He had no chance, {{but he was a}} fool. He stood up in the boat with a rifle, and he shot many times. He was not a good shot, but as we drew close <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>were</b> wounded and killed.

60|$|Against France {{there is}} no great bitterness, for we feel that France has never had much reason to look upon us in any light save that of an enemy. For many years we have wished to be friendly, but the traditions of centuries are not so easily forgotten. Besides, some of our {{shortcomings}} are of recent date. <b>Many</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>were,</b> and are, ashamed of the absurd and hysterical outcry in this country over the Dreyfus case. Are there no miscarriages of justice in the Empire? An expression of opinion was permissible, but the wholesale national abuse has disarmed us from resenting some equally immoderate criticism of our own character and morals. To Russia also we can bear no grudge, for we know that {{there is no}} real public opinion in that country, and that their press has no means for forming first-hand conclusions. Besides, in this case also there is a certain secular enmity which may account for a warped judgment.|$|E

60|$|As we rode {{down the}} long line a buzz of {{greeting}} and welcome rose now and again from the ranks as they recognised through the gloom Saxon's tall, gaunt figure. The clock was on the stroke of eleven as we returned to our own men, and {{at that very moment}} King Monmouth rode out from the inn where he was quartered, and trotted with his staff down the High Street. All cheering had been forbidden, but waving caps and brandished arms spoke the ardour of his devoted followers. No bugle was to sound the march, but as each received the word the one in its rear followed its movements. The clatter and shuffle of hundreds of moving feet came nearer and nearer, until the Frome men in front of us began to march, and we found ourselves fairly started upon the last journey which <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>were</b> ever to take in this world.|$|E
60|$|The bishop {{had always}} been {{sensitive}} to the secret fount of pathos that is hidden in the spectacle of youth. Long {{years ago when he}} and Lady Ella had been in Florence he had been moved to tears by the beauty of the fresh-faced eager Tobit who runs beside the great angel in the picture of Botticelli. And suddenly and almost as uncontrollably, that feeling returned {{at the sight of the}} young congregation below him, of all these scores of neophytes who were gathered to make a public acknowledgment of God. The war has invested all youth now with the shadow of tragedy; before it came <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>were</b> a little envious of youth and a little too assured of its certainty of happiness. All that has changed. Fear and a certain tender solicitude mingle in our regard for every child; not a lad we pass in the street but may presently be called to face such pain and stress and danger as no ancient hero ever knew. The patronage, the insolent condescension of age, has vanished out of the world. It is dreadful to look upon the young.|$|E
60|$|At the summit, {{where the}} road begins to dip down upon the other side, a halt was called to enable the regiments to close up, and we {{looked back at the}} fair town which <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>were</b> never to see again. From the dark walls and house roofs we could still mark the {{flapping}} and flutter of white kerchiefs from those whom we left behind. Reuben sat his horse beside me, with his spare shirt streaming in the wind and his great pikemen all agrin behind him, though his thoughts and his eyes were too far away to note them. As we gazed, a long thin quiver of sunshine slipped out between two cloud banks and gilded the summit of the Magdalene tower, with the Royal standard which still waved from it. The incident was hailed as a happy augury, and a great shout spread from rank to rank at the sight of it, with a waving of hats and a clattering of weapons. Then the bugles blew a fanfare, the drums struck up a point of war, Reuben thrust his shirt into his haversack, and on we marched through mud and slush, with the dreary clouds bending low over us, and buttressed by the no less dreary hills on either side. A seeker for omens might have said that the heavens were weeping over our ill-fated venture.|$|E
60|$|This is {{what they}} are like; and what we, I fear, too <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>us,</b> <b>are</b> not like.

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} identity {{creation and}} the environment of oppression and exploitation that exists for California’s Mexican Transnational agricul-tural workers.

6000|$|Of {{course there}} is no denying the evil, the black evils <b>of</b> this war; <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>are</b> impoverished and ruined, <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>are</b> wounded, almost all <b>of</b> <b>us</b> have lost friends and {{suffered}} indirectly in a hundred ways. And all that is going on yet. The black stream of consequence will flow for centuries. But all this multitudinous individual unhappiness is still compatible with a great progressive movement in the general mind. Being wounded and impoverished, being hurt and seeing things destroyed, is as much living and learning as anything else in the world. The tremendous present disaster of Europe may not be, after all, a disaster for mankind. Horrible possibilities have to be realized, and they can be realized only by experience; complacencies, fatuities have to be destroyed; we have to learn and relearn what Boon once called [...] "the bitter need for honesty."

60|$|There was no {{delay in}} the work of slaughter. That very night the great gallows was erected outside the White Hart inn. Hour after hour we could hear the blows of mallets and the sawing of beams, mingled with the shoutings and the ribald choruses of the Chief Justice's suite, who were carousing with the {{officers}} of the Tangiers regiment in the front room, which overlooked the gibbet. Amongst the prisoners the night was passed in prayer and meditation, the stout-hearted holding forth to their weaker brethren, and exhorting them to play the man, and to go to their death in a fashion which should be an example to true Protestants throughout the world. The Puritan divines had been mostly strung up off-hand immediately after the battle, but a few were left to sustain the courage of their flocks, and to show them the way upon the scaffold. Never have I seen anything so admirable as the cool and cheerful bravery wherewith these poor clowns faced their fate. Their courage on the battlefield paled before that which they showed in the shambles of the law. So amid the low murmur of prayer and appeals for mercy to God from tongues which never yet asked mercy from man, the morning broke, the last morning which <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>were</b> to spend upon earth.|$|E
60|$|Thus {{we made a}} swift march, {{and thought}} {{ourselves}} pretty secure; but our work was not done yet, for on a sudden we saw ourselves under a necessity of fighting our way through a great body of Manchester's horse, who came galloping upon us over the moor. They had, as we suppose, been pursuing some of our broken troops which were fled before, and seeing us, they gave us a home charge. We received {{them as well as}} we could, but pushed to get through them, which at last we did with a considerable loss to them. However, we lost so many men, either killed or separated from us (for all could not follow the same way), that of our three regiments we could not be above 400 horse together when we got quite clear, and these were mixed men, some of one troop and regiment, some of another. Not that I believe <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>were</b> killed in the last attack, for we had plainly the better of the enemy, but our design being to get off, some shifted for themselves one way and some another, in the best manner they could, and as their several fortunes guided them. Four hundred more of this body, as I afterwards understood, having broke through the enemy's body another way, kept together, and got into Pontefract Castle, and 300 more made northward and to Skipton, where the prince afterwards fetched them off.|$|E

Our punishment was not given into the hands of the bourgeois, who would have dealt justly, but to the scum, the canaille, the demons of the earth. Had our King, had our nobility, been men with the old fire, they would not have stood it. They were worn out with centuries of catering to themselves.
