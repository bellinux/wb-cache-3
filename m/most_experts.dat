To Hamilton, the proper handling of the government debt would also allow America to borrow at affordable interest rates and would also be a stimulant to the economy.|$|E
5|$|Johnson and the 2008 Detroit Lions {{finished}} {{the first ever}} 016 season in NFL history after a 3121 loss to the Green Bay Packers in week17. Despite the Lions' failures {{and the fact that}} five different quarterbacks played during the year, Johnson finished as one of the strongest wide receivers statistically for the 2008 season, finishing fifth in receiving yards (1,331) and 7th in receiving yards per game (83.2), and leading the league in receiving touchdowns (12), {{despite the fact that the}} entire Lions team only passed for 18 touchdowns. However, Johnson missed the Pro Bowl, with <b>most</b> <b>experts</b> attributing the snub to the Lions' dismal winless season (he was named an alternate instead).|$|E
5|$|The {{classification}} of lemurs within the suborder Strepsirrhini is equally controversial, although <b>most</b> <b>experts</b> {{agree on the}} same phylogenetic tree. In one taxonomy, the infraorder Lemuriformes contains all living strepsirrhines in two superfamilies, Lemuroidea for all lemurs and Lorisoidea for the lorisoids (lorisids and galagos). Alternatively, the lorisoids are sometimes placed in their own infraorder, Lorisiformes, separate from the lemurs. In another taxonomy published by Colin Groves, the aye-aye was placed in its own infraorder, Chiromyiformes, {{while the rest of}} the lemurs were placed in Lemuriformes and the lorisoids in Lorisiformes.|$|E

5|$|These {{features}} make Archaeopteryx a clear {{candidate for}} a transitional fossil between non-avian dinosaurs and birds. Thus, Archaeopteryx plays an important role, {{not only in the}} study of the origin of birds, but in the study of dinosaurs. It was named from a single feather in 1861. That same year, the first complete specimen of Archaeopteryx was announced. Over the years, ten more fossils of Archaeopteryx have surfaced. Despite variation among these fossils, <b>most</b> <b>experts</b> regard all the remains that have been discovered as belonging to a single species, although this is still debated.|$|E
5|$|On Sunday 30 September, {{the body}} of prostitute Elizabeth Stride was {{discovered}} at about 1am in Dutfield's Yard, inside the gateway of 40 Berner Street (since renamed Henriques Street), Whitechapel. She was lying {{in a pool of}} blood with her throat cut from left to right. She had been killed just minutes before, and her body was otherwise unmutilated. It is possible that the murderer was disturbed before he could commit any mutilation of the body by someone entering the yard, perhaps Louis Diemschutz, who discovered the body. However, some commentators on the case conclude that Stride's murder was unconnected to the others on the basis that the body was unmutilated, that it was the only murder to occur south of Whitechapel Road, and that the blade used might have been shorter and of a different design. <b>Most</b> <b>experts,</b> however, consider the similarities in the case distinctive enough to connect Stride's murder with at least two of the earlier ones, as well as that of Catherine Eddowes on the same night.|$|E
5|$|On Tuesday 7 August, {{following}} a Monday bank holiday, prostitute Martha Tabram was murdered at about 2:30am. Her {{body was found}} at George Yard Buildings, George Yard, Whitechapel. She had been stabbed 39times with a short blade. On the basis of statements from a fellow prostitute, and PC Thomas Barrett who was patrolling nearby, Inspector Reid put soldiers at the Tower of London and Wellington Barracks on an identification parade, but without positive results. The police did not connect the murder with Smith's, but they did connect it with the later murders. <b>Most</b> <b>experts</b> today do not connect it with the other killings, as Tabram was stabbed whereas the later victims were slashed, but a connection cannot be ruled out.|$|E
