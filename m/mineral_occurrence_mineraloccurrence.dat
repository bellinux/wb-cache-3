40|$|Abstract. Bayesian {{theory was}} {{evaluated}} on the spatial analysis of geological data, to address potential areas for radioactive <b>mineral</b> <b>occurrences</b> in the Po√ßos de Caldas Plateau (750 Km 2). Spatial inference techniques were applied {{controlled by a}} prospecting model based on diagnostic criteria, represented by favorable lithology, structures features and gamma-ray intensity. In the analysis the 48 <b>mineral</b> <b>occurrences</b> were used to calculate statistical parameters, that served for weighting the evidences of the model. Firstly, Contrast studies were conducted to measure the spatial correlation between the evidences and the mineral deposits. This study allowed to determine {{the threshold of the}} binary evidences, where the binary patterns present the best spatial correlation with the <b>mineral</b> <b>occurrences.</b> Before the final integration, Qui-square (? 2) tests were conduct comparing the binary evidences on pairs. The goal was to measure the conditional independence between the classes of the binary evidences. Verified the independence of the binary evidences, it was calculated the Sufficiency (LS) and Necessity (LN) ratio. The natural logarithm of LS and LN, W+ and W- respectively, were added to the prior odds of the <b>mineral</b> <b>occurrences,</b> controlled by {{the presence or absence of}} the potential classes of the binary evidences. This procedure yielded the posterior odds values, from where it was obtained the posterior probabilities considering the whole evidences. The resulting product was arbitrary sliced in four potential categories (null, low, medium and high). The bayesian scenario was qualitatively and quantitatively compared with previous results obtained by Boolean and Weighted Means based models. The comparison of both procedures showed that the bayesian scenario accomplished a medium performance. A target area of 27, 54 Km 2 (3, 78 % of the alkaline complex) included 27 <b>mineral</b> <b>occurrences,</b> whereas each previous model encompassed only 24 in an approximately similar area. We also assessed the correlation of <b>mineral</b> <b>occurrences</b> in relation to the potential classes for the different scenarios. The high and medium potential classes of the bayesian scenario showed posterior probabilities 6. 69 and 8, 39 higher than the prior probabilities. These values were, respectively, 12. 6 and 4. 97 for the same classes defined by the Weighted Means based model. For the potential class of the Boolean model this value was 5. 78. The Bayesian method showed an interesting approach for the spatial analysis. Perhaps being the major advantage, the possibility of applying statistical parameters to calculate the weights of the models evidences. Pages: 895 - 90...|$|R
40|$|The {{clustering}} of <b>mineral</b> <b>occurrences</b> {{and their}} spatial associations with particular geological features are critical aspects of mineral distributions for exploration and understanding ore genesis. Variations {{in the degree}} of clustering of <b>mineral</b> <b>occurrences</b> or geological features can be measured by fractal dimensions, obtained from a shifting box counting method. Spatial associations between <b>mineral</b> <b>occurrences</b> and geological features can be quantified by the weights of evidence (WofE) method using the contrast value, which increases with the strength of the spatial relationship. A new method is proposed to evaluate <b>mineral</b> <b>occurrence</b> distributions by combining the power of fractal analysis of clustering with the WofE approach. The method compares the correlation between the variation in degree of clustering of <b>mineral</b> <b>occurrences</b> and a geological feature in a study area, with the contrast value of the same feature. The possible outcomes can be simplified into four scenarios, depending on whether the correlation in variation of clustering and the contrast are high or low, respectively. Each outcome has specific exploration implications. If either a high correlation in variation of clustering or a high contrast value is obtained, the geological feature can be used for exploration targeting. The integrated fractal and WofE approach is applied to copper occurrences in the Proterozoic Mount Isa Inlier, NW Queensland, Australia, which hosts large numbers of copper deposits (1, 869 occurrences), including the world class Mount Isa copper deposit. Variation in clustering of copper occurrences has a positive correlation with variation in clustering of fault bends (R = 0. 823), fault intersections (R = 0. 862) and mafic rocks (R = 0. 885). WofE results indicate that the copper occurrences are spatially associated with fault intersections and bends and with mafic rocks. Analyses were carried out separately for the two major lithostratigraphic sequences in the Inlier, the Eastern and Western Successions. The Western Succession copper occurrences are apparently more clustered than those of the Eastern Succession, which may reflect a lower degree of exploration and/or geological factors. The association of copper occurrences with mafic rocks compared with fault bends and intersections is greater in the Eastern Succession, which may reflect genetic factors. Correlations in the variation of clustering of <b>mineral</b> <b>occurrences</b> and geological features have a linear relationship with the contrast values, and the spatial association between all geological features and copper occurrences constitute high correlation/high contrast cases. The linear relationship suggests that the geological features that control the clustering of the copper occurrences could be the same features that control their localization...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT Fuzzy logic, {{decision}} making procedure (AHP), and conditional probability were evaluated on the spatial analysis of geological data, to address potential areas for radioactive <b>mineral</b> <b>occurrences</b> in the Po√ßos de Caldas Plateau (‚âÖ 750 Km 2). Spatial inference techniques were applied {{controlled by a}} prospecting model based on diagnostic criteria, represented by favorable lithology, structures features and gamma-ray intensity. The diagnostic criteria, favorable lithology and gamma-ray intensity, were converted on fuzzy members through linear functions applied over weights defined from a heuristic manner. In the lithological case linear functions were applied to spatialise the uncertainly associated with {{the location of the}} inferred boundaries. Structural features were spatialised through sigmoid functions that constitute the fuzzy members decreasingly ordered as the distance from the features increase. The crossover point of the sigmoid function was defined using the spatial correlation (conditional probability) between the diagnostic criteria and the 48 known radioactive <b>mineral</b> <b>occurrences.</b> Finally the fuzzy evidence was combined through a weighted mean sum where the weights were empirically defined according to the Analytical Hierarchic Process (AHP). The resulting grid was arbitrarily sliced in four classes of potentiality (Null, low, medium and high potential), which express different levels of favorability for radioactive <b>mineral</b> <b>occurrences.</b> The fuzzy scenario was qualitatively and quantitatively compared with previous results obtained by Boolean and Weighted Mean...|$|R
