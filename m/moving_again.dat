5|$|The {{effect of}} Rupert's actions, {{even after his}} forces disengaged, was to force another delay in the Parliamentarian retreat; Essex spent much of 19 September looking after wounded {{soldiers}} and, when he finally managed to begin <b>moving</b> <b>again,</b> he was confronted with swampland and bog which further delayed him while the Royalists marched across the relatively open chalk downs above the Kennet. These hardships meant that the Royalists arrived at Newbury before Essex, with both armies settling down for the night outside the town, too exhausted to immediately fight.|$|E
5|$|As Emma {{arrives at}} Granny's Bed & Breakfast, she {{is given a}} key to her room by the elderly {{proprietor}} (Beverley Elliot), who is actually Granny from Little Red Riding Hood. She comes downstairs after yelling at Ruby (Meghan Ory), her granddaughter, followed {{by a man who}} came to collect money: Mr. Gold (Carlyle), Rumpelstiltskin who also helped build and owns the entire town. When Emma mentions her name, Mr. Gold pauses as if he knew something about her. Emma's decision to stay in Storybrooke causes the hands of the town clock, previously frozen at 8:15, to begin <b>moving</b> <b>again,</b> indicating that the Dark Curse is beginning to weaken.|$|E
5|$|Bozon {{was born}} in St. Louis, Missouri, where his father, Philippe Bozon, played hockey for the St. Louis Blues of the National Hockey League (NHL), but was raised in France, where his father is from. Bozon then moved to Switzerland to further his career, before <b>moving</b> <b>again</b> to Canada after the Kamloops Blazers {{selected}} him in the 2011 CHL Import Draft. At the 2012 NHL Entry Draft, Bozon was selected 64th overall by the Canadiens. During his third season with the Blazers Bozon {{was traded to the}} Kootenay Ice. Internationally Bozon has played for the French national junior team in several tournaments and joined the French national senior team in the 2013 IIHF World Championships. Bozon contracted Neisseria meningitis in early 2014, threatening his life, though he ultimately recovered.|$|E

5|$|In 1898 {{the club}} moved {{to their first}} private {{enclosed}} ground at Dinton Road, next to Kingston Barracks, <b>moving</b> <b>again</b> {{at the turn of}} the century to Lower Marsh Lane in 1902, specifically to part of the rugby ground in Richmond Road. The split in 1908–09 between Kingston-on-Thames A.F.C. and Old Kingstonians led to the breakaway group Old Kingstonians playing at Norbiton Sports Ground, Kingston-on-Thames A.F.C. remaining at Richmond Road. Reunited after World War I, the club continued to play at Richmond Road but, in 1920, the site's owners, the Dysarts, leased the site to Leyland Motors, then establishing a factory base at nearby Ham. The club managed to negotiate a ground-sharing arrangement and were eventually able to buy the land, but the issue impacted their performance.|$|E
5|$|Sunderland {{have had}} seven stadiums {{throughout}} their history; {{the first was}} at Blue House Field in Hendon in 1879. The ground {{was close to the}} place where Sunderland formed, at Hendon Board School; at that time the rent for use of the ground was £10 (£ today). The club relocated briefly to Groves Field in Ashbrooke in 1882, before <b>moving</b> <b>again</b> the following season. The club's third stadium was Horatio Street in Roker, the first Sunderland stadium north of the River Wear; the club played a single season there before another move, this time to Abbs Field in Fulwell for two seasons. Abbs Field was notable for being the first Sunderland ground to which they charged admission.|$|E
5|$|The player gains {{points by}} {{defeating}} multiple enemies consecutively and {{can participate in}} a bonus round to gain more points. Enemies are defeated by kicking them over once they have been flipped on their back. This is accomplished by hitting the platform the enemy is on directly beneath them. If the player allows too much time to pass after doing this, the enemy will flip itself back over, changing in color and increasing speed. Each phase has {{a certain number of}} enemies, with the final enemy immediately changing color and increasing to maximum speed. Hitting a flipped enemy from underneath causes it to right itself and start <b>moving</b> <b>again,</b> but it does not change speed or color.|$|E

Five different methods of inferring the distance to the shock lead to estimates that cluster in the range of 90 ± LO AU. In August 2001 Voyager I will be at 82 AU and moving outward at 3. 6 AU per year, suggesting the possibility of encountering the termination shock by 2005 before it starts <b>moving</b> outward <b>again...</b>|$|R
5|$|Yoshimura first {{pitched the}} show to the Homicide: Life on the Street {{production}} team in May 1997 at the San Francisco production center of executive producer Barry Levinson. The episode was discussed and well-received during a round-table discussion involving Levinson, executive producer Tom Fontana, producer David Simon, supervising producer Julie Martin, and consulting producer Gail Mutrux. During that meeting, Markin suggested that the transit authority should pressure the police to resolve the homicide case quickly and get the trains <b>moving</b> <b>again,</b> an element which Yoshimura eventually added to the script. Levinson suggested ending the episode with the detectives {{walking back to the}} surface, then feeling the hum and vibration of the train starting back up under their feet. This suggestion, however, did not appear in the final episode.|$|E
5|$|On October 19, the Martin Company {{was about}} 110 miles (177 km) further east, making its last {{crossing}} of the North Platte River near present-day Casper, Wyoming. Shortly after completing the crossing, the blizzard struck. Many members of the company suffered from hypothermia or frostbite after wading through the frigid river. They set up camp at Red Bluffs, unable to continue forward through the snow. Meanwhile, the original scouting party continued eastward until it reached a small vacant fort at Devil's Gate, {{where they had been}} instructed to wait {{for the rest of the}} rescue party if they had not found the Martin Company. When the main rescue party rejoined them, another scouting party consisting of Joseph Young, Abel Garr, and Daniel Webster Jones was sent forward. The Martin company remained in their camp at Red Bluffs for nine days until the three scouts finally arrived on October 28. By the time the scouts arrived, 56 members of the company had died. The scouts urged the emigrants to begin <b>moving</b> <b>again.</b> Three days later the main rescue party met the Martin Company and the Hodgett and Hunt wagon companies and helped them on to Devil's Gate.|$|E

25|$|The {{club was}} {{originally}} called Grimsby Pelham, {{this being the}} family name of the Earl of Yarborough, a significant landowner in the area. In 1880 the club purchased land at Clee Park which was to become their ground until 1889 when they relocated to Abbey Park, before <b>moving</b> <b>again</b> in 1899 to their present home, Blundell Park. The original colours were blue and white hoops, which were changed to chocolate brown and blue quartered shirts in 1884.|$|E

After capturing seventeen Federal soldiers, Major Hathaway reported to the brigade commander that the Federals had left the field. The one-day battle had cost the regiment three soldiers killed and one wounded.|$|E

Playing a Roll against a Stop hazard corrects it and allows the player to start moving; a second Roll is not needed.|$|E
25|$|City by {{city the}} federal forces broke the ARU efforts {{to shut down}} the {{national}} transportation system. Thousands of United States Marshals and some 12,000 United States Army troops, commanded by Brigadier General Nelson Miles, took action. President Cleveland wanted the trains <b>moving</b> <b>again,</b> based on his legal, constitutional responsibility for the mails. His lawyers argued that the boycott violated the Sherman Antitrust Act, and represented a threat to public safety. The arrival of the military and the subsequent deaths of workers in violence led to further outbreaks of violence. During the course of the strike, 30 strikers were killed and 57 were wounded. Property damage exceeded $80 million.|$|E
25|$|The school survived its denigrators; it {{merged with}} King's College {{for a period}} after 1831 and moved 60 years later to its present {{location}} in Deer Park, which was then a rural area. The government of Ontario then stopped funding UCC in 1900, thus making it a completely independent school. By 1910, however, UCC was dealing with declining enrollment and capital and considered selling the Deer Park campus for $1.125 million and <b>moving</b> <b>again</b> to become a full boarding school on a property purchased in Norval, Ontario. Plans were halted by {{the outbreak of the}} First World War and the college remained where it was. It eventually thrived there, both physically and culturally, as the buildings were expanded and bright instructors attracted.|$|E

25|$|The Soutzos {{family was}} an {{important}} family of Phanariotes in Constantinople, many members of which were men of letters: his maternal uncle was Iakovos Pizos Neroulos, while his sister, Aikaterini Soutsou, was a poet. He was homeschooled by many important intellectuals of that time, and from 1818 till 1820, {{he and his brother}} studied in the School of Chios by educators such as Neophytos Vamvas and Constantinos Vardalachos. In 1820, due to the passing of their father, Konstantinos Soutsos, the two brothers moved to Transylvania where they stayed for a short while with their uncle. In April of the same year they departed to Paris with a recommendation letter of their uncle in order to meet Adamantios Korais. After <b>moving</b> <b>again</b> to Italy two years later, they both finally moved to Greece in 1825.|$|E
25|$|The {{crossing}} of the Sangro and Biferno rivers involved long artillery fire programmes {{at the end of}} November, for which 51st HAA was assigned to 6th Army Group Royal Artillery, after which it switched to protecting the assembly and bridgehead areas for the actual assault. 2nd AA Brigade's commander (51st HAA's former CO, Murray McIntyer, now a brigadier), was an enthusiast for using the versatile 3.7-inch HAA guns for ground support tasks, even wire-cutting. During the winter of 1943–44 he disposed two-thirds of his HAA guns in the forward area, the rest at landing grounds as far back as Foggia, and he rotated batteries between the tasks. When the Adriatic campaign began <b>moving</b> <b>again</b> in May, 2nd AA Bde moved up with V Corps and in July it reached Ancona.|$|E
