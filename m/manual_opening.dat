40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{several aspects}} {{related to the}} development of a reliable finite element model to simulate the craniofacial changes during rapid maxillary expansion treatment. The mechanical model concerns the entire human skull (bony structure and sutures) as well as the jackscrew device; the latter transforms the <b>manual</b> <b>openings</b> into orthodontic forces usually applied to the two maxillary halves through the first premolars and first permanent molars, which are the support points of the appliance. A sensitivity analysis of an approximate finite element model is performed in order to investigate the influence of the model size, the influence of the degree of sutural ossification by assigning different mechanical properties to the sutures and the influence of bone relaxation concerning the effects of dentofacial orthopaedics. Moreover, a more accurate model including the aforementioned teeth and their periodontal ligament as solid elastic structures was analysed in order to evaluate the orthodontic effects induced. Results refer to the opening pattern and associated stresses/displacements/strains on the cranium, the maxillae and the periodontal ligament. (c) 2006 IPEM. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

5000|$|... 3...Nxd4 is possible, though rarely played {{today by}} strong players. It was {{popular in the}} 19th century, and {{receives}} five columns of analysis in Freeborough and Ranken's <b>opening</b> <b>manual</b> Chess <b>Openings</b> Ancient and Modern (3rd ed. 1896 p. 53). It is often described today as a strategic error, since after 4.Nxd4 exd4 5.Qxd4 (5.Bc4 is the Napoleon Gambit) White's queen stands on a central square, and is not developed too early since it cannot be chased away very effectively (5...c5? is a seriously weakening move that blocks Black's king's bishop). Nonetheless, the Encyclopaedia of Chess Openings (volume 3, 3rd edition 1997, p. 251 n.28, referring to p. 252 line 1) concludes that Black equalises with 5...Ne7 6.Bc4 Nc6 7.Qd5 Qf6 8.0-0 Ne5 9.Be2 c6 10.Qb3 Ng6 11.f4 Bc5+ 12.Kh1 d6. Similarly, Harald Keilhack concludes in Knight on the Left: 1.Nc3 (p. 21) that although ...Nxd4 is a [...] "non-line" [...] these days, if Black continues perfectly {{it is not clear}} that White gets even a small advantage. Keilhack analyses 5.Qxd4 d6 6.Nc3 Nf6 7.Bc4 Be7 8.0-0 0-0 9.Bg5 c6 10.a4 Qa5 11.Bh4 and now after 11...Qe5 or 11...Be6, [...] "White has at most this indescribable nothingness which is the advantage of the first move." [...] (Id. p. 25) The Encyclopaedia of Chess Openings also concludes that Black equalises after the alternative 4.Nxe5 Ne6 5.Bc4 Nf6 6.Nc3 Be7 7.0-0 0-0 8.Be3 d6 8.Nd3 Nxe4 10.Nxe4 d5 (p. 251 n.28).

The T3 did not contain many Samara parts however, using the Porsche 959's four-wheel drive system and a 3.6-litre Porsche flat-six. It was developed by French concessionaire Lada-Poch together with NAMI and the Tupolev aircraft factory. In the mid-1980s Lada developed its first ever convertible car on its own, then actually entering production and quickly exported to most European countries, called the Lada Natasha Cabriolet, a four-seater convertible {{that was based on}} the popular Samara 1300/1500 models with a <b>manual</b> <b>opening</b> and closing canvas roof.

50|$|A {{polytunnel}} (also {{known as}} a polyhouse, hoop greenhouse or hoophouse, grow tunnel or high tunnel) is a tunnel made of polyethylene, usually semi-circular, square or elongated in shape. The interior heats up because incoming solar radiation from the sun warms plants, soil, and other things inside the building faster than heat can escape the structure. Air warmed by the heat from hot interior surfaces is retained in the building by the roof and wall. Temperature, humidity and ventilation can be controlled by equipment fixed in the polytunnel or by <b>manual</b> <b>opening</b> and closing of flaps. Polytunnels are mainly used in temperate regions in similar ways to glass greenhouses and row covers. Besides the passive solar heating that every polytunnel provides, every variation of auxiliary heating (from hothouse heating through minimal heating to unheated houses) is represented in current practice. The nesting of row covers and low tunnels inside high tunnels is also common.|$|E
40|$|Ceramic Matrix Composites (CMC) {{modeling}} and life prediction strongly depend on oxidation, and therefore require {{a thorough understanding}} of when matrix cracks occur, the extent of cracking for given conditions (time-temperature-environment-stress), and the interactions of matrix cracks with fibers and interfaces. In this work, the evolution of matrix cracks in a melt-infiltrated Silicon Carbide/Silicon Carbide (SiC/SiC) CMC under uniaxial tension was examined using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) combined with digital image correlation (DIC) and <b>manual</b> crack <b>opening</b> displacement (COD) measurements. Strain relaxation due to matrix cracking, the relationship between COD's and applied stress, and damage evolution at stresses below the proportional limit were assessed. Direct experimental observation of strain relaxation adjacent to regions of matrix cracking is presented and discussed. Additionally, crack openings were found to increase linearly with increasing applied stress, and no crack was found to pass fully through the gage cross-section. This observation is discussed {{in the context of the}} assumption of through-cracks for all loading conditions and fiber architectures in oxidation modeling. Finally, the combination of SEM with DIC is demonstrated throughout to be a powerful means for damage identification and quantification in CMC's at stresses well below the proportional limit...|$|R

5000|$|MMM {{is caused}} by the {{presence}} of 2M fibers in the muscles of the jaw. 2M fibers are not found elsewhere in the body, but they are close in structure to proteins found on the surface of bacteria. The immune system recognizes these proteins as foreign to the body and attacks them, resulting in inflammation. [...] Diagnosis of MMM is through either biopsy of the temporalis or masseter muscles or the 2M antibody assay, in which blood serum of the possible MMM-dog is reacted with temporalis tissue of a normal dog, or both. False negatives by the 2M antibody assay may be obtained if MMM is end-stage with destruction of type 2M fibers and marked fibrosis. Treatment is usually with corticosteroids such as prednisone, often with decreasing doses for up to 4-6 months, {{and in the case of}} trismus, <b>manual</b> <b>opening</b> of the mouth under anesthesia. [...] Feeding very soft or liquid food during this time is usually necessary. The ultimate degree of recovery of jaw function and muscle mass will depend upon the extent of damage to the muscle tissue. Recurrence of MMM may occur. [...] Misdiagnosis of MMM as a retroorbital abscess based on physical examination and finding of trismus leads to inappropriate treatment with antibiotics, which will not impede the progress of MMM.|$|E
50|$|Aleksandr Akimov, {{the unit}} shift chief, {{was in charge}} of the test itself. He took over the shift at midnight from Tregub, who stayed on-site. The drop in reactor power from 1500 MWt to 30 MWt was disconcerting; he wanted to abort the test. He {{supported}} Toptunov's decision to shut down the poisoned reactor, but was over-ridden by Dyatlov and forced to continue. At 1:23:04 am the test began, and the main circulation pumps started cavitating due to the too high temperature of inlet water. The coolant started boiling in the reactor, and the reactor power slowly increased. Toptunov reported a power excursion to Akimov. At 1:23:40, Akimov pressed the AZ-5 button, class-5 emergency. The control rods, according to the synchro indicators, seized at a depth of between 2 and 2.5 meters instead of the entire core depth of 7 meters. Akimov disconnected the clutches of the control rod servos to let the rods descend into the core by their own weight, but the rods did not move. The reactor was now making rumbling noises. Akimov was confused. The reactor control panel indicated no water flow and failure of pumps. The explosion occurred, the air filled with dust, power went out, and only battery-powered emergency lights stayed in operation. Perevozchenko ran into the control room, reporting the collapse of the reactor top. Brazhnik ran in from the turbine hall, reporting fire there. Brazhki, Akimov, Davletbayev, and Palamarchuk ran into the turbine hall, having seen scattered debris and multiple fires on Levels 0 and +12. Akimov called the fire station and the chiefs of electrical and other departments, asking for electrical power for coolant pumps, removal of hydrogen from hydrogen generators, and other emergency procedures to stabilize the plant and contain the damage. Internal telephone lines were disabled; Akimov sent Palamarchuk to contact Gorbachenko. Kudryavtsev and Proskuryakov returned from the reactor and reported its state to Akimov and Dyatlov. Insisting the reactor was intact, Akimov ordered Stolyarchuk and Busygin to turn on the emergency feedwater pumps. Davletbayev reported loss of electrical power, torn cables, and electric arcs. Akimov sent Metlenko to help in the turbine hall with <b>manual</b> <b>opening</b> of the cooling system valves, which was expected to take at least four hours per valve. Perevozchenko returned and reported that the reactor was destroyed, but Akimov insisted it was intact. At 3:30 am, Telyatnikov contacted Akimov, asking what was happening to his firemen; Akimov sent him a dosimetrist. Akimov, already nauseous, was replaced at 6:00 am by the unit chief Vladimir Alekseyevich Babychev, but together with Toptunov stayed in the plant. Believing the water flow to the reactor to be blocked by a closed valve somewhere, they went to the half-destroyed feedwater room on Level +24. Together with Nekhayev, Orlov, and Uskov, they opened the valves on the two feedwater lines, then climbed over to Level +27 and almost knee-deep in a mixture of fuel and water, opened two valves on the 300 line; due to advancing radiation poisoning caused by a dose of over 15 Grays (4 being the LD50), they did not have the strength to open the valves on the sides. Akimov and Toptunov spent several hours turning valves; the radioactive water in Room 712 was half submerging the pipeline. Smagin went in to open the third valves, spent 20 minutes in the room, and received 280 rads. Akimov was evacuated to the hospital. Until his death, he insisted he had done everything correctly and had made no mistakes.|$|E
40|$|Accident {{management}} procedures associated with {{nuclear power plant}} beyond design basis accidents should be developed {{with the aid of}} the more recent versions of advanced computational tools (best estimate codes) in order to verify the effectiveness of normal operation systems of the plant to avoid or minimize core damage.

5000|$|The work {{begins with}} an updated and {{extended}} form of the old prelude-type, manual passaggio followed by a pedal solo, and a motivic-contrapuntal section. Bach's extended passaggio which opens BWV 564 may {{have been inspired by}} Buttstett's preludes; both the rhetorical rests followed by returns to the tonic and the single pedal notes are part of the older tradition as well. The following pedal solo, however, is unique in organ literature: it is the longest known pedal introduction, reaching far beyond the scope of Bach's models (Buxtehude, Böhm, and others) or his own earlier works (e.g. the pedal solo in BWV 549). The full-voiced section that follows elaborates on motives first introduced in the pedal solo. Various scholars have noted how the construction of this first movement is reminiscent of that of a concerto, if the <b>opening</b> <b>manual</b> and pedal passages are taken as [...] "solos" [...] and the closing contrapuntal section as a [...] "tutti".|$|R
2500|$|Probably Myers' best-known {{contribution}} to opening theory is the eccentric line 1.c4 g5, {{a sort of}} Grob's Attack (1.g4) with colors reversed.

When Myers discussed it in New Strategy in the Chess Openings his publisher, without consulting him, inserted in the book the remark, [...] "I can't believe that 1.c4 g5 is good for Black. There is no need to even give the reasons for my opinion; the move 1.-- g5 violates chess principles as I learned them." [...] International Master John L.

40|$|Viscoelastic {{characteristics}} of raw cashew nut shell hinder its decortication by compression. In {{order to facilitate}} the shell opening and to liberate the kernel, nuts were subjected to hydration and thermal treatment in cashew nut shell liquid (CSL) at 210 °C. With the objective of developing more appropriate shelling mechanisms the cashew nut 'CCP 76 ' was characterized by its main dimensions, mass and volume, as well as mechanical behavior of the endocarp and kernel, prior and after thermal treatments. The treatments consisted in submitting the nuts to several combinations of hydration and thermal treatment times. The response surface methodology was applied to identify the best treatment. Specially built devices were used for <b>manual</b> <b>opening</b> of the cashew nut, shear of the endocarp and penetration of the kernel. Changes were observed in the dimensions, length, width, and thickness {{as well as in}} mass and volume values prior and after treatments. Results of endocarp shear and kernel stiffness tests pointed out differences between raw and treated nuts. Changes in dimensions, mass, and volume pointed out to performing sizing after thermal treatments if dimensions are relevant in shelling.

40|$|The EWDS is an {{electronic}} device designed to recognize, on-line {{and well in}} advance, anomalous process conditions in chemical reactors {{that can lead to}} runaway reactions. The EWDS consists of hardware and software parts: In the hardware part we have: PT resistance thermometers to measure reactor and jacket temperatures; a data acquisition unit; a supply unit that complies with industrial safety standards and a PC equipped with a special data acquisition card. The software part is used to save and elaborate data, to show the results on line and to provide warning and alarm signals. For the bench scale reactor experiments the EWDS performance has been satisfactory. The algorithm, in fact, has detected the runaway events in advance without producing false alarms. For the industrial experiments two different algorithms have been used. Algorithm n. 1 was able to distinguish between runaway and non-runaway situations, because it is mainly focused on the dynamics inside the reactor. Algorithm n. 2, instead, produced false alarms during the <b>manual</b> <b>opening</b> of the jacket valve by the operator.

40|$|Natural night {{ventilation}} {{is driven}} by wind and stack generated pressures and cools down the exposed building structure at night, in which {{the heat of the}} previous day is accumulated. This passive cooling technique is applied in the low energy police office Schoten (Belgium). Thermal summer comfort in the offices is analysed based on the adaptive temperature limits indicator. Design, operation and performance of natural night ventilation are also evaluated. The design is compared to design guidelines for natural night ventilation. The operation is evaluated by comparing measured opening/closing of the windows to the designed control system. The performance is analysed based on the achieved temperature drop overnight. Measured data of indoor temperatures and opening/closing of windows were collected from the building management system during short periods in the summers of 2009 and 2010. Good thermal summer comfort is noticed during normal and warm summer periods. Only when the maximum outdoor temperature exceeds 30 °C, high indoor temperatures are measured. Too low temperatures in the morning are noticed in some landscaped offices in normal summer periods. This can be solved by raising the set point for indoor temperature. The users have a large impact on the achieved thermal comfort by <b>manual</b> <b>opening</b> and closing of the windows by day.

40|$|Artistic {{teaching}} tools {{included in}} the process of education increase the efficiency of traditional learning methods. They help pupils to be more open, relaxed and motivated. They enable presenting information easier, which is especially important for pupils with learning difficulties. Puppets present one such tool. By including them in the educational process, puppets can affect different areas of a child's development and can {{play an important role in}} additional expert pedagogical support. They help achieve general and specific objectives {{in the process of}} education set out individually for each pupil with learning difficulties, since they offer a more creative, more interesting and less stressful style of learning. Puppets can affect the emotional, cognitive and social development of pupils and enable their integrated development as well. In the empirical part of the thesis, the frequency and the aim of the use of puppets in additional expert pedagogical support were researched as well as teachers' opinions on the use of puppets, their acquaintance with their use, factors affecting their use and reasons for not using them very often. An internet survey was conducted and analysed with the help of a programme for statistical analysis SPSS. The results are presented in tabular form, in graphs and descriptively. The sample of persons participating comprises special education teachers in Slovenian primary schools. Besides the results of the research, the thesis also presents the activities that included puppets as well as the objectives of the curriculum and of individualised programmes achieved by them on the basis of personal experiences in additional expert pedagogical support. Research findings show that special education teachers generally welcome the use of puppets in additional expert pedagogical support but do not use them frequently, usually because of lack of knowledge and ideas on the one hand and work overload and time shortage on the other. The puppets they mostly use at their work are hand puppets and puppets as toys, and as a learning method, they mostly use storytelling and communication through the puppet as the media. They mostly use them with children with specific learning difficulties in the first and second triad (age of pupils: from 6 to 11 years), and the frequency of their use is closely connected to various activities, methods and forms of work. They assess puppets as especially useful tool at helping pupils express their thoughts and feelings, at encouraging their imagination, and speech and communication development. Special education teachers are willing to participate at training courses on the use of puppets since they suggest seminars, workshops and trainings on various possibilities of the use of puppets, presentations of best practices in schools and study groups, publishing of the <b>manual</b> and <b>opening</b> of the Internet site on the use of puppets in the educational process, and professional help to special education teachers at their work. They also suggest introducing puppets as a compulsory university subject, and creating of didactic suitcase with various puppets. The presentation of the use of puppets in the programme of additional expert pedagogical support highlights the factors that affect the frequency of the use of puppets and at the same time suggests the guidelines for more frequent use by special education teachers. The fundamental contribution of this thesis relates to enrichment of the working methods in additional expert pedagogical support for children with specific learning difficulties and consequently the enrichment of the curriculum in primary schools. ...|$|R
