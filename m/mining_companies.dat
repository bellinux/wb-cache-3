5|$|In 1897, her {{daughter}} Irène was born. To support her family, Curie began {{teaching at the}} École Normale Supérieure. The Curies {{did not have a}} dedicated laboratory; most of their research was carried out in a converted shed next to the School of Physics and Chemistry. The shed, formerly a medical school dissecting room, was poorly ventilated and not even waterproof. They were unaware of the deleterious effects of radiation exposure attendant on their continued unprotected work with radioactive substances. The School did not sponsor her research, but she would receive subsidies from metallurgical and <b>mining</b> <b>companies</b> and from various organizations and governments.|$|E
5|$|In 1918 Davies {{sought the}} {{position}} of miners' agent for the Dowlais district of the SWMF. Against strong competition—his main opponent was William Mainwaring, later a long-serving Labour MP for Rhondda East—Davies was victorious by 100 votes. The main role of the agent was to represent miners in disputes with their employers; typically these would involve issues of pay, redundancy, working hours, and compensation for injuries. Davies's surviving day books reveal {{the extent to which}} he was concerned with cases where the <b>mining</b> <b>companies</b> denied liability for underground injuries.|$|E
5|$|Mining is {{the basis}} of the oblast's economy, and mining {{enterprises}} remain the principal employers in such monotowns as Apatity, Kirovsk, Zapolyarny, Nikel, and Monchegorsk. The Kola Mining and Metallurgical Company, a division of Norilsk Nickel, conducts nickel-, copper-, and platinum-group-metals-mining operations on the peninsula. Other large <b>mining</b> <b>companies</b> include OAO Apatit, which is the largest producer of phosphates in Europe; OAO Olcon, one of the leading producers of iron ore concentrates in Russia; and OAO Kovdorsky GOK, an ore-mining and processing enterprise.|$|E

5|$|Most of the <b>mining</b> <b>companies</b> {{felt that}} the {{expected}} recovery {{would result in a}} labor shortage and challenge economic recovery. The government believed that if copper prices fell in the future, similar effects would be experienced. The colonial administration implemented two schemes to maintain the relationship of urban workers with their rural homelands. Health-service expenditures by rural relatives of urban workers were borne by the government, and the rural male migration of the working population was reduced.|$|E
5|$|The CGS {{warned that}} {{aftershocks}} were {{expected in the}} days following the earthquake and they could possibly continue for months. They recommended that buildings be evacuated {{in the event of an}} aftershock. The mining regulator's chief inspector of mines David Msiza asked <b>mining</b> <b>companies</b> in affected areas, including Klerksdorp, Carletonville and Rustenburg, to undertake underground inspections to ensure no miners were trapped and the working conditions were safe for miners. AngloGold Ashanti denied responsibility for the earthquake, saying it occurred away from its mining infrastructure.|$|E
5|$|With {{a lack of}} {{domestic}} capital that was required for economic growth, the New Order reversed Sukarno's economic self-sufficiency policies and opened selected economic sectors {{of the country to}} foreign investment though the 1967 Foreign Investment Law. Suharto travelled to Western Europe and Japan to promote investment in Indonesia. The first foreign investors to re-enter Indonesia included <b>mining</b> <b>companies</b> Freeport Sulphur Company / International Nickel Company. Following government regulatory frameworks, domestic entrepreneurs (mostly Chinese-Indonesians) emerged in the late 1960s and early 1970s in the import-substitution light-manufacturing sector such as Astra Group and Salim Group.|$|E

5|$|Miners of the Pittston Coal Company {{were glad}} that a {{settlement}} {{had been reached}} {{and that they would}} once again be receiving health and retirement funds. However, because they were without benefits for such a long time, many people had gone into financial trouble. During the strike, the costs of health care had to be paid out of pocket and many miners did not have the resources to do so. As a result, many miners had accumulated debt. Another direct result of the Pittston Strike was the formation of the Coal Act. This act was established in 1992. This act made it mandatory by law for <b>mining</b> <b>companies</b> to provide health and retirement benefits for its workers.|$|E
5|$|On July 22, 1847, {{the first}} party of Mormon pioneers {{arrived in the}} Salt Lake Valley, where they founded Salt Lake City, the first European {{settlement}} in Utah. Over the next 22 years, more than 70,000 pioneers crossed the plains and settled in Utah. Initial colonization along the Wasatch Front was mostly made by members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) with no direct involvement from it. Outside the Wasatch Front, most settlements were directed, planned, organized, and dispatched by leaders of the LDS Church. Settlements were also founded by the railroads, <b>mining</b> <b>companies</b> and non-Mormons. Many settlements were named after leaders, history or from scriptures of the LDS Church. Natural features of the region, including rivers, mountains, lakes and flora, are also commonly used for names.|$|E
5|$|The GWR {{provided}} special wagons, {{handling equipment}} and storage facilities for its largest traffic flows. For example, the coal mines in Wales sent {{much of their}} coal to the docks along the coast, {{many of which were}} owned and equipped by the railway, as were some in Cornwall that exported most of the china clay production of that county. The wagons provided for both these traffic flows (both those owned by the GWR and the <b>mining</b> <b>companies)</b> were fitted with end doors that allowed their loads to be tipped straight into the ships' holds using wagon-tipping equipment on the dockside. Special wagons were produced for many other different commodities such as gunpowder, aeroplanes, milk, fruit and fish.|$|E

5|$|The {{discovery}} of large deposits of copper sulfide during the 1900s encouraged large <b>mining</b> <b>companies</b> {{to invest in}} Northern Rhodesia. South Afric{{an interest in the}} region was led by the Anglo American Corporation, which gained an interest in the Bwana Mkubwa Company in 1924 and acquired a one-third interest in Mufulira in 1928. That year, Anglo American acquired control of the Nkana mine at Kitwe and formed Rhodesian Anglo American; shareholders included the United States, South African finance houses and the British South Africa Company. As the BSAC purchased shares in Rhodesian Anglo American, the latter became a major shareholder in BSAC. By 1930, Chester Beatty's Rhodesian Selection Trust and Ernest Oppenheimer's Anglo-American Corporation controlled most of the region's mining. The Roan Antelope and Nkana mines began commercial production in 1931.|$|E
5|$|The islands {{were first}} taken into {{use as a}} whaling base in the 17th and 18th centuries, after which they were abandoned. Coal mining started at the {{beginning}} of the 20th century, and several permanent communities were established. The Svalbard Treaty of 1920 recognizes Norwegian sovereignty, and the 1925 Svalbard Act made Svalbard a full part of the Kingdom of Norway. They also established Svalbard as a free economic zone and a demilitarized zone. The Norwegian Store Norske and the Russian Arktikugol remain the only <b>mining</b> <b>companies</b> in place. Research and tourism have become important supplementary industries, with the University Centre in Svalbard (UNIS) and the Svalbard Global Seed Vault playing critical roles. No roads connect the settlements; instead snowmobiles, aircraft and boats serve inter-community transport. Svalbard Airport, Longyear serves as the main gateway.|$|E
5|$|There was at {{the time}} a boom in shares in South American <b>mining</b> <b>companies.</b> Spain was losing its South American colonies in the face of rebellions. At the urging of George Canning the British {{government}} recognised the new independent governments of Argentina (1824), Colombia and Mexico (both 1825). With no money of his own, Disraeli borrowed money to invest. He became involved with the financier J. D. Powles, who was prominent among those encouraging the mining boom. In the course of 1825, Disraeli wrote three anonymous pamphlets for Powles, promoting the companies. The pamphlets were published by John Murray, who invested heavily in the boom.|$|E

5|$|With the {{commencement}} of the New Order in 1965, Indonesia's economy developed and opened to foreign investment. In Toraja, a coffee plantation and factory was established by Key Coffee of Japan, and Torajan coffee regained a reputation for quality within the growing international specialty coffee sector Multinational oil and <b>mining</b> <b>companies</b> opened new operations in Indonesia during the 1970s and 1980s. Torajans, particularly younger ones, relocated {{to work for the}} foreign companies—to Kalimantan for timber and oil, to Papua for mining, to the cities of Sulawesi and Java, and many went to Malaysia. The out-migration of Torajans was steady until 1985. and has continued since, with remittances sent back by emigre Torajans performing an important role within the contemporary economy.|$|E
5|$|After 1935, {{the mines}} were reopened {{and there was}} steady growth in the region. According to David M. Gordon, the unrest gave missionaries {{a chance to respond}} to the Watchtower {{movement}} in a coordinated fashion. The London Missionary Society and the Church of Scotland worked together after the strike, saying that the lack of education and religious instruction were contributing factors. The missionaries and the <b>mining</b> <b>companies</b> said that a Christian education would create a disciplined workforce, a belief which was called the spiritual wing of industrial capitalism. The region's Protestant mission established the United Mission of Copperbelt (UMCB), which led to the establishment of Protestant bodies such as the Church of Central Africa in Rhodesia (CCAR) in 1945 and the United Church of Central Africa in Rhodesia in 1958 (which became the United Church of Zambia in 1965).|$|E
5|$|During World War I, the German {{government}} {{hoped to}} destabilize British rule over India by spreading {{rumors that the}} British were unable to redeem for silver all of the paper currency they had printed. These rumors, and hoarding of silver, caused the price of silver to rise and risked damaging the British war effort. The British turned to their war ally, the United States, asking to purchase silver to increase the supply and lower the price. In response, Congress passed the Pittman Act of April 23, 1918. This statute gave the United States authority to sell metal to the British government from up to 350,000,000 silver dollars at $1 per ounce of silver plus {{the value of the}} copper in the coins, and handling and transportation fees. Only 270,232,722 coins were melted for sale to the British, but this represented 47% of all Morgan dollars struck to that point. The Treasury was required by the terms of the Act to strike new silver dollars to replace the coins that were melted, and to strike them from silver purchased from American <b>mining</b> <b>companies.</b>|$|E

5|$|The {{events of}} the Klondike Gold Rush {{challenged}} this policy, as the force soon became essential to controlling the borders in the far north. Moving the entire force to the remote region of the Yukon, though, would {{have more than doubled}} the cost of the police's training and support arrangements, and their existing bases therefore remained vital to the northern operations. The increasing demands from the railway companies and <b>mining</b> <b>companies</b> for police assistance, and appeals from the ranching community for continued support, also made it harder for the Liberals to consider cutting back the force. The Second Boer War then disrupted plans to create a replacement militia unit, while Herchmer's disastrous tour in South Africa enabled the Liberals to replace him with Perry, a Liberal supporter. As a result, the political argument began to swing back in favour of potentially retaining the force.|$|E
5|$|With the Coinage Act of 1873, {{the dollar}} {{was no longer}} {{equivalent}} to a set amount of silver, a statutory change made so that {{as the price of}} silver dropped with increased U.S. production, <b>mining</b> <b>companies</b> could not present their bullion at the mints and receive it back, struck into silver dollars worth more as money than they were as metal. By the post-World War II era, the Bureau of the Mint was striking the three remaining precious metal coins, the dime, quarter and half dollar in 90 percent silver—the dollar had not been coined since 1935 and circulated little outside some Western states like Nevada and Montana. The metal in a silver dollar was worth more as bullion than as money above $1.2929 per troy ounce; the smaller coins would be attractive for the melting pot above $1.38 per ounce.|$|E
