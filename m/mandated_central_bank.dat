40|$|This article {{argues that}} the {{institutional}} <b>mandates</b> of <b>central</b> <b>banks</b> have an important influence on inflation outcomes in the advanced industrialized countries. <b>Central</b> <b>banks</b> that are also responsible for bank regulation will {{be more sensitive to}} the profitability and stability of the banking sector and therefore less likely to alter interest rates {{solely on the basis of}} price stability objectives. When bank regulation is assigned to a separate agency, the <b>central</b> <b>bank</b> is more likely to enact tighter monetary policies geared solely toward maintaining price stability. An econometric analysis of inflation in 23 industrial countries from 1975 to 1999 reveals that inflation is significantly higher in those countries with <b>central</b> <b>banks</b> that are vested with bank regulatory responsibility, although this effect is conditional on the choice of exchange rate regime and the relative size of the banking sector. We also conduct a case study of the Bank of England, which lost its bank regulatory authority to a new agency in 1998. We find that the new Labour government under Tony Blair imposed the institutional change on the Bank of England in part to remove the bank stability bias from its monetary policymaking. These findings suggest that the <b>mandates</b> of <b>central</b> <b>banks</b> not only have important influences on macroeconomic outcomes, but may also be modified in the future by governments seeking to impose their own monetary policy preferences.

This question has received insufficient attention, {{especially in light of}} the unconventional policies introduced since the 2008 financial crisis. The article analyzes three ways in which the concern <b>central</b> <b>banks</b> show for inequalities in their official statements remains incomplete and underdeveloped. First, <b>central</b> <b>banks</b> tend to care about inequality for instrumental reasons only. When they do assign intrinsic value to containing inequalities, they shy away from trade-offs with the standard objectives of monetary policy that such a position entails. Second, <b>central</b> <b>banks</b> play down the causal impact monetary policy has on inequalities. When they do acknowledge it, they defend their actions by claiming that it is an unintended side effect, that it is temporary, and/or that any alternative policy would fare even worse. The article appeals to the doctrine of double effect to criticize these arguments. Third, even if one accepts that inequalities should be contained and that today’s monetary policies exacerbate them, is it both desirable and feasible to make containing inequalities part of the <b>mandate</b> of <b>central</b> <b>banks?</b> The article analyzes and rejects three attempts on the part of <b>central</b> <b>banks</b> to answer this question negatively...|$|R

During the bubble’s development and growth, the Fed was lenient since it considered that the increase in real estate prices helped reduce the risk of financial instability brought on by the financial crisis from 2000 to 2002. When the subprime crisis surfaced, the Fed started to act vigorously as a lender of last resort, with a vigorous expansion of the monetary basis in order to defend the system from the risk of a widespread default in the interbank market. In both cases the Fed was pragmatic and discretionary, and did not follow the mainstream thesis in economics analysis, the so called “New Monetary Consensus”. However, at the same time, the US <b>Central</b> <b>Bank</b> is a “prisoner” of these thesis and of the financial interests that help it sustain them: the thesis that the financial market’s deregulation benefits the entire society inhibited interventionist actions that would have restrained the new financial instruments in the housing market and the thesis that the main goal of the Monetary Authority should be price stability contributed to the leniency with the increasing risks in the financial markets.

40|$|How {{does the}} economy respond to shocks to expectations? This paper {{addresses}} this question within a cashless, monetary economy. A competitive economy features producers and consumers with asymmetric information. Only consumers observe current productivity and hence they perfectly anticipate prices, whereas all agents observe a noisy signal about long-run productivity. Information asymmetries imply that monetary policy and consumers’ expectations have real effects. Non-fundamental, purely expectational shocks are conventionally {{thought of as}} demand shocks. While this remains a possibility, expectational shocks can also have the characteristics of supply shocks: if positive, they increase output and employment, and lower inflation. Whether expectational shocks manifest themselves as demand or supply shocks depends on the monetary policy pursued. Forward-looking policies generate multiple equilibria in which the role of consumers’ expectations is arbitrary. Optimal policies restore the complete information equilibrium. They do so by manipulating prices so that producers correctly anticipate their revenue despite their uncertainty about current productivity. I design targets for forward-looking interest-rate rules which restore the complete information equilibrium for any policy parameters. Inflation stabilization per se is typically suboptimal as it can at best eliminate uncertainty arising through prices. This offers a motivation for the Dual <b>Mandate</b> of <b>central</b> <b>banks...</b>|$|R
40|$|In this paper, we {{take stock}} of how {{statistical}} agencies in different nations are currently accounting for housing in their consumer price indexes (CPIs). The rental equivalence and user cost approaches have been favourites of economists. Both {{can be derived from}} the fundamental equation of capital theory. Concerns about these approaches are taken up. We go on to argue that an opportunity cost approach is the correct theoretical framework for accounting for owner-occupied housing (OOH) in a CPI. This approach, first mentioned in a 2006 OECD paper by Diewert, is developed more fully here. We explore the relationship of this new approach to the usual rental equivalency and user cost approaches. The new approach leads to an owner-occupied housing opportunity cost (OOHOC) index that is a weighted average of the rental and the financial opportunity costs. We call attention to the need for more direct measures of inflation for owner-occupied housing services.
