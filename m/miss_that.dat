5|$|On 10 April, the 2nd Hydroplane Command at Divulje {{began to}} disintegrate, with some pilots flying their {{aircraft}} to the Bay of Kotor {{to join the}} 3rd Hydroplane Command. One Do 22 attacked an Italian tanker off Bari, claiming a near <b>miss</b> <b>that</b> the Yugoslav crew believed to have caused some damage. The following day, Italian dive bombers attacked MTBs of the 2nd Torpedo Division near Šibenik, with the Yugoslav boats shooting down one Italian aircraft and damaging another.|$|E
5|$|There was {{resistance}} from the air, though. As the fifth wave of seven LCIs was coming in to Red Beach, they were attacked by six Zeke fighters and three Betty bombers that dropped twelve bombs. One hit the deck of USS LCI-339 forward of the conning tower; another two were near misses. Badly damaged and riddled by bullets and fragments, the ship caught fire. LCI-339 remained on the beach, where she served as a landmark for Japanese aircraft. She was eventually towed off the beach, but then drifted onto a reef and became a total loss. USS LCI-341 suffered a near <b>miss</b> <b>that</b> tore a huge hole in its side. Eight Australians were killed, including Lieutenant Colonel R. E. Wall, the commanding officer of the 2/23rd Infantry Battalion, and 45 were wounded.|$|E

25|$|By November 16, 2005, 12 trials {{had been}} held since the initial hearing on September 9, 2004. The {{prosecution}} argued that the two defendants neglected to provide proper separation for the two aircraft, the instructions issued were inappropriate, and that the supervisor failed to correct the trainee. The defense argued {{that the lack of}} separation would not immediately have led to a near <b>miss,</b> <b>that</b> the instructions issued were appropriate, that the TCAS procedure was not proper, and that the Computer Navigation Fix (CNF) had faulty data.|$|E
25|$|It {{was during}} the regular season that the Swans caused the upset of the season, {{defeating}} the star-studded Geelong Cats on its home ground, Skilled Stadium, where the home tenant had won its past 29 games in succession, and its past two matches at the ground by a combined margin of 336 points, in Round 23. It was the Swans' first win over the Cats since 2006 and its first win at the ground since Round 8, 1999. The Swans were also the only team to defeat the West Coast Eagles at Patersons Stadium {{during the regular season}}. The Swans' victory over Geelong was overshadowed by the news that co-captain Jarrad McVeigh's baby daughter had died in the week leading up to the match, forcing him to <b>miss</b> <b>that</b> match.|$|E

At 07:00, they returned, refueled, loaded bombs, and departed again. The destroyer [...] came alongside at 08:00 and took on fuel from Europa, departing at 09:45 to join the search.

500|$|Boycott laid {{claim to}} coining the phrase [...] "corridor of uncertainty" [...] as a {{reference}} to the area outside the off stump where a batsman is unsure whether he should leave or hit the ball and was noted for using a key to measure the hardness of the pitch, until this was outlawed by the International Cricket Council. He is especially known for several stock phrases that have become his recognised trademarks in the cricket-watching world, notably (of dropped catches) that his mother or grandmother [...] "could have caught that in her pinny" [...] or (of an easy batting <b>miss)</b> <b>that</b> they could have [...] "hit the ball with a stick of rhubarb." [...] These two phrases in particular inspire much affectionate spoofing of his style.|$|E

500|$|Doctors had an {{artificial}} kidney {{rushed to the}} hospital for him, but the artificial organ reduced his blood's ability to clot and he began to bleed internally. Despite this it is said that he asked assistant manager Jimmy Murphy [...] "What time is the kick off against Wolves, Jimmy? I mustn't <b>miss</b> <b>that</b> match". By 14 February, his condition was reported to have [...] "dramatically improved". However, on 19 February it was reported that he was [...] "sinking rapidly", with use of the artificial kidney machine developing into a [...] "vicious circle, gradually sapping his strength". Doctors were [...] "amazed" [...] at his fight for life, and the next day a [...] "very slight improvement" [...] in his condition was reported, but he died at 2:15a.m. on 21 February 1958. Hours before his death, by coincidence, a new issue of Charles Buchan's Football Monthly was published in the United Kingdom, with a photograph of a smiling Edwards on the cover.|$|E
500|$|Abby {{was well}} {{received}} by television critics. Carolyn McGuire of The Chicago Tribune commented, [...] "Whoever shows {{up as the}} next villain, chances are {{his or her work}} won't be easy. That's because at least one resident—Abby Ewing—knows how to dish nasty with the best of them. Only Alexis Carrington Colby Dexter, played by Joan Collins on Dynasty, and Angela Channing, portrayed by Jane Wyman on [...] Falcon Crest, rival Abby Ewing, played by Donna Mills, for best prime-time female villain." [...] When asked which character he wished he had created, Mike Kelly, the creator of ABC's popular primetime-soap Revenge, said: [...] "Abby Ewing. Donna Mills, you rocked my world." [...] Jamey Giddens of Zap2it said, [...] "While I readily admit Alexis will go down in soap history as the most famous of the 80's primetime soap vixens, she was never truly my cup of detergent. I much preferred the more subdued, methodical villainy of characters like Abby Fairgate (Donna Mills), who slept her way through Seaview Circle, and to the top of Corporate California on Knots Landing.

According to Gaudiosi, dedicated players will learn [...] "all about aerodynamics and stunt flying"; {{he considered the}} latter to be [...] "hard stuff, even with green hoops guiding you". Similarly, Buchanan characterized the Hoops courses as [...] "incredibly demanding", and Atkin cited that mode's Trick difficulty level as [...] "amazingly tough". Bob and John Nolan wrote that people who [...] "love to loop around the skies of Flight Simulator 5 will go bananas for" [...] the aerobatics; but the pair commented that combat flight simulator players [...] "might get a little edgy once the wow-power wears off." [...] However, Atkin believed that only those [...] "never happy without something to shoot at" [...] could be disappointed {{by the lack of}} combat: other players will [...] "be too busy choreographing aerial ballets, pulling off death-defying aerobatic stunts, or just enjoying a quiet soar down the ridge line to <b>miss</b> <b>that</b> stuff". Likewise, Ware called the non-violent gameplay [...] "refreshing", and Buchanan wrote, [...] "If [...] a battle-weary veteran of air combat sims, Flight Unlimited might be just the sort of [...] you need." ...|$|E

500|$|As the {{defending}} champion at the World Championship for the first time, O'Sullivan sought to turn his recent bad form around and break the Crucible curse. O'Sullivan defeated Drew Henry 10–5 in the first round, Robert Milkins 13–2 in the second round, and Stephen Lee 13–10 in the quarter-finals {{to advance to the}} semi-finals where he faced Stephen Hendry. In a pre-match interview, O'Sullivan revealed that he had [...] "no respect" [...] for Hendry, referring to an incident during O'Sullivan's 13–17 semi-final defeat to Hendry three years prior, when the referee had awarded a <b>miss</b> <b>that</b> O'Sullivan felt Hendry should not have accepted. He further added that he wanted [...] "to send [...] back home to Scotland" [...] to stop one of his former manager's players from winning the tournament, and that [...] "I know if I do get beat and [...] comes up and does a moonie {{in front of me and}} goes 'Ne ne ne', I'll just look at him and say 'well done' and say 'go back to your sad little life'.". In the match O'Sullivan took a 5–3 overnight lead after the first session, but Hendry fought back to level at 12–12 before the final session. Hendry subsequently outplayed O'Sullivan winning the semi-final 17 frames to 13. After the match, Hendry said it wasn't [...] "personal" [...] for him and he didn't remember the incident O'Sullivan described. O'Sullivan was unapologetic about the comments he made, saying it made a [...] "better atmosphere" [...] and [...] "what's better than a grudge match?".|$|E
500|$|NXT Arrival {{was well}} {{received}} by critics. Aaron Oster of the Baltimore Sun described the event as fantastic, but [...] "marred by technical issues". He streamed the show live and the stream cut out from Breeze-Woods, which {{caused him to}} <b>miss</b> <b>that</b> match {{and half of the}} main event. Technical issues aside, Oster felt that Arrival [...] "was a phenomenal show that gave the WWE a chance to show off the NXT roster". He also stated that all three promoted matches met or exceeded his expectations. Cesaro and Zayn's match [...] "wasn't the same as their previous encounters, and they actually built on it" [...] and that [...] "they actually told the story that they knew each other well in the ring, and used it to put on a fantastic 20-minute match". Oster gave high praise to the women's match, he thought it [...] "was better than nearly all of the Divas matches on the main roster for the past few years, featuring some strong chain wrestling and submission moves." [...] He also noted that Emma's sitout powerbomb sparked the crowd to chant [...] "Better than Batista". For the main event, Oster felt that there were [...] "some interesting spots with some good storytelling, even if there weren't the typical brutal spots associated with a ladder match", so it was not [...] "overly special" [...] but still [...] "pretty good". Lastly, Oster praised the announcers, who [...] "worked perfectly together in a traditional sports style, which truly added to the broadcast. WWE should really consider going back to this format for the main shows".|$|E

[...] On the same occasion, Emily Nussbaum wrote at Slate that [...] "the show is biting the dust without ever getting the credit it deserved: for social satire, witty writing, and most of all, for a truly original main character". She particularly singled out for praise that all the characters were heading [...] "to very different paths in life, based on their economic prospects," [...] giving the show an ambiguous end; [...] " [...] {{a bit of a}} classic: a sharply funny exploration of social class most teen films would render, well, cartoonish." ...|$|E
