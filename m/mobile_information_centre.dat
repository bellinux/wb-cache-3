40|$|<b>Mobile</b> <b>information</b> systems hold {{great promise}} to support {{organizational}} processes. Clear guidelines however, {{of how to}} design effective <b>mobile</b> <b>information</b> systems in support of organizational processes have not been developed. Based on earlier research studies that {{emphasized the importance of}} a fit between organizational tasks and technology (Goodhue and Thompson 1995), and that developed a systematic fit profile for one particular task−technology combination, namely group support systems to support group tasks (Zigurs and Buckland 1998), this research paper seeks to develop a fit profile for <b>mobile</b> <b>information</b> systems to support managerial tasks. We suggest to determine task−technology fit as a three−way match between managerial tasks (operationalized by non−routineness, interdependence and time−criticality), <b>mobile</b> <b>information</b> systems (operationalized by functionality, user interface, and adaptability), and the mobile use context (operationalized by distraction, quality of network connection, previous experience, and mobility). The analysis shows that use situations characterized by high distraction and poor quality of network connection are particularly challenging for the design of <b>mobile</b> <b>information</b> systems, and that the user interface requires particular attention. The proposed framework provides guidelines for the design of effective <b>mobile</b> <b>information</b> systems and for future research studies...|$|R

Hitachi, Ltd. ’s SupperH RISC (reduced instruction set computer) engine is a central processing unit (CPU) suitable for those Windows CE applications that feature high performance, low power consumption, and low cost. Also, the companion LSI chip HD 64461 has been developed that incorporates the peripheral functions required in <b>mobile</b> <b>information</b> devices.

This project involved a user study, comprising two different types of studies concerning a paper diary and a digital diary. The analysis of both the paper diary and the digital diary was conducted through grounded theory and taxonomy of information needs. our results indicate a relationship between <b>mobile</b> <b>information</b> needs and context factors and expected answers.
