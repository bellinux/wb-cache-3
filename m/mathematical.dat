5|$|The {{earliest}} attested {{examples of}} <b>mathematical</b> calculations {{date to the}} predynastic Naqada period, and show a fully developed numeral system. The importance of mathematics to an educated Egyptian is suggested by a New Kingdom fictional letter in which the writer proposes a scholarly competition between himself and another scribe regarding everyday calculation tasks such as accounting of land, labor, and grain. Texts such as the Rhind <b>Mathematical</b> Papyrus and the Moscow <b>Mathematical</b> Papyrus show that the ancient Egyptians could perform the four basic <b>mathematical</b> operations—addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division—use fractions, compute the volumes of boxes and pyramids, and calculate the surface areas of rectangles, triangles, and circles. They understood basic concepts of algebra and geometry, and could solve simple sets of simultaneous equations.|$|E

5|$|Their {{answer was}} {{surprising}} in two ways. First, they proved that there were, in fact, {{limits to what}} <b>mathematical</b> logic could accomplish. But second (and more important for AI) their work suggested that, within these limits, any form of <b>mathematical</b> reasoning could be mechanized. The Church-Turing thesis implied that a mechanical device, shuffling symbols as simple as 0 and 1, could imitate any conceivable process of <b>mathematical</b> deduction. The key insight was the Turing machine—a simple theoretical construct that captured the essence of abstract symbol manipulation. This invention would inspire a handful of scientists to begin discussing the possibility of thinking machines.|$|E
