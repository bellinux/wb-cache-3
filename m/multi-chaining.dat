40|$|This paper {{presents}} a novel pointer prefetching technique, called <b>multi-chain</b> prefetching. <b>Multi-chain</b> prefetching tolerates serialized memory latency {{commonly found in}} pointer chasing codes via aggressive prefetch scheduling. Unlike conventional prefetching techniques that hide memory latency underneath a single traversal loop or recursive function exclusively, <b>multi-chain</b> prefetching initiates prefetches for a chain of pointers prior to the traversal code, thus exploiting "pre-loop" work to help overlap serialized memory latency. As prefetch chains are scheduled increasingly early to accommodate long pointer chains, <b>multi-chain</b> prefetching overlaps prefetches across multiple independent linked structures, thus exploiting the natural memory parallelism that exists between separate pointer-chasing loops or recursive function calls. This paper makes three contributions {{in the context of}} <b>multi-chain</b> prefetching. First, we introduce a prefetch scheduling technique that exploits [...] ...|$|R

40|$|The {{behavior}} in an {{external magnetic field}} is studied exactly for a wide class of <b>multi-chain</b> quantum spin models. It is shown that the magnetic field together with the inter-chain couplings cause the commensurate-incommensurate phase transitions between the gapless phases in the groundstate. The conformal limit of these models is studied and it is shown that the low-lying excitations for the incommensurate phases are not independent, because they are governed by the same magnetic field (chemical potential for excitations). A scenario for the transition from one to two space dimensions for the exactly integrable <b>multi-chain</b> quantum spin models is proposed and it is shown that the incommensured phases in an external magnetic field disappear {{in the limit of}} an infinite number of the coupled spin chains. The similarities in the external field behavior for the quantum <b>multi-chain</b> spin models and a wide class of quantum field theories are discussed. The scaling exponents for the appearence of the gap in the spectrum of the low-lying excitations of the quantum <b>multi-chain</b> models due to the relevant perturbations of the integrable theories are calculated.

40|$|Pointer-chasing {{applications}} tend {{to traverse}} composite data structures consisting of multiple independent pointer chains. While the traversal of any single pointer chain {{leads to the}} serialization of memory operations, the traversal of independent pointer chains provides a source of memory parallelism. This article investigates exploiting such inter-chain memory parallelism {{for the purpose of}} memory latency tolerance, using a technique called <b>multi-chain</b> prefetching. Previous works [30, 31] have proposed prefetching simple pointer-based structures in a multichain fashion. However, our work enables <b>multi-chain</b> prefetching for arbitrary data structures composed of lists, trees, and arrays. This article makes five contributions in the context of <b>multi-chain</b> prefetching. First, we introduce a framework for compactly describing LDS traversals, providing the data layout and traversal code work information necessary for prefetching. Second, we present an off-line scheduling algorithm for computing a prefetch schedule from the LDS descriptors that overlaps serialized cache misses across separate pointer-chain traversals. Our analysis focuses on static traversals. We also propose using speculation to identify independent pointer chains in dynamic traversals...|$|R

Based on the modularized division of robots and the communication between the host and the modules, a configuration recognition method is proposed. By using the graph theory, the method of topological analysis is proposed, and the assembly incidence matrix (AIM) and path matrix are derived. Subsequently, {{based on the results of}} topological analysis and the definition of module frames, the initial poses and twists of a robot are obtained. To deal with the <b>multi-chain</b> robots, the entries of the path matrix are employed to enable dyads to appear or not to appear in the kinematic equations. Then, the forward kinematics of the <b>multi-chain</b> robot is derived. An illustrative example and an experiment are presented.

40|$|It {{has been}} {{established}} that the entangled polymer dynamics can be reasonably described by single chain models such as tube and slip-link models. Although the entanglement effect {{is a result of}} the hard-core interaction between chains, linkage between the single chain models and the real <b>multi-chain</b> system has not been established yet. In this study, we propose a <b>multi-chain</b> slip-spring model where bead-spring chains are dispersed in space and connected by slip-springs inspired by the single chain slip-spring model [A. E. Likhtman, Macromolecules 38, 6128 (2005) ]. In this model the entanglement effect is replaced by the slip-springs, not by the hard-core interaction between beads so that this model is located in the niche between conventional <b>multi-chain</b> simulations and single chain models. The set of state variables are the position of beads and the connectivity (indices) of the slip-springs between beads. The dynamics of the system is described by the time evolution equation and stochastic transition dynamics for these variables. We propose a simple model which is based on the well-defined total free-energy and the detailed balance condition. The free energy in our model contains a repulsive interaction between beads, which compensate the attractive interaction artificially generated by the slip-springs. The explicit expression of linear relaxation modulus is also derived by the linear response theory. We also propose a possible numerical scheme to perform simulations. Simulations reproduced expected bead number dependence in transitional regime between Rouse and entangled dynamics for the chain structure, the central bead diffusion, and the linear relaxation modulus.

Thus, we recommend Mobile sink improved energy-efficient PEGASIS-based routing protocol (MIEEPB); a <b>multi-chain</b> model having a sink mobility, to achieve proficient energy utilization of wireless sensors. As the motorized movement of mobile sink is steered by petrol or current, {{there is a need}} to confine this movement within boundaries and the trajectory of mobile sink should be fixed. In our technique, the mobile sink moves along its trajectory and stays for a sojourn time at sojourn location to guarantee complete data collection. We develop an algorithm for trajectory of mobile sink. We ultimately perform wide-ranging experiments to assess the performance of the proposed method.
