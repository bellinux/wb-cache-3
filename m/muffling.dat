5|$|On July 21, 1989, OTA {{approved}} {{a contract to}} transplant approximately 290 live trees {{in the path of}} the turnpike to locations along the edge of the right-of-way. There, the trees would serve as a barrier between the road and the surrounding properties, masking the road from view and <b>muffling</b> the sounds of traffic. A Norman landscaping firm performed the work, which included thirty months of maintenance, for a total cost of $288.50 per tree ($544.19 in 2013 dollars).|$|E
5|$|The killings were methodical. After the {{condemned}} individual's personal information was checked and approved, he was handcuffed {{and led to}} a cell insulated with stacks of sandbags along the walls, and a heavy, felt-lined door. The victim was told to kneel {{in the middle of the}} cell, and was then approached from behind by the executioner and immediately shot in the back of the head or neck. The body was carried out through the opposite door and laid in one of the five or six waiting trucks, whereupon the next condemned was taken inside and subjected to the same fate. In addition to <b>muffling</b> by the rough insulation in the execution cell, the pistol gunshots were also masked by the operation of loud machines (perhaps fans) throughout the night. Some post-1991 revelations suggest that prisoners were also executed in the same manner at the NKVD headquarters in Smolensk, though judging by the way that the corpses were stacked, some captives may have been shot while standing on the edge of the mass graves. This procedure went on every night, except for the public May Day holiday.|$|E

40|$|The {{failure of}} burner <b>muffles</b> in shell gasifiers {{has been a}} common problem, which {{directly}} leads to unexpected shutdown in operation of the gasifier and huge economic losses for the factory. Therefore, the experiment of the failure analysis to the burner <b>muffle</b> was conducted in the current work. The microstructure of the burner <b>muffle</b> after failure was measured by means of optical microscope, SEM (scanning electro-microscope) and X-ray diffraction. The reason of failure was obtained based on the analysis of experimental data together with the structural study of the gasifier. It is indicated that the failure of burner <b>muffle</b> is accounted for slag overflow and “backfire”, which lead to local temperature increasing. Cooling water tubes of Burner <b>muffle</b> were partially melted due to oxidation and sulphidation at high temperature, resulting into water leaks.

25|$|<b>Muffling</b> {{the bass}} can be {{achieved}} with the same <b>muffling</b> techniques as the snare, but bass drums in a drum kit are more commonly muffled by adding pillows, a sleeping bag or another soft filling inside the drum, between the heads. Cutting a small hole in the resonant head can also produce a more muffled tone, and allows manipulation in internally placed <b>muffling.</b> The Evans EQ pad places a pad against the batterhead and, when struck, the pad moves off the head momentarily, then returns to rest against the head, thus reducing the sustain without choking the tone.|$|E
25|$|<b>Muffling</b> {{is often}} {{referred}} to as muting, which can also refer to playing with mutes on them (see below).|$|E
25|$|The typical {{method of}} <b>muffling</b> {{is to place}} the pads of the fingers against the head while holding onto the timpani stick with the thumb and index finger. Timpanists are {{required}} to develop techniques to stop all vibration without making any sound from the contact of their fingers.|$|E

25|$|Since timpani {{have a long}} sustain, <b>muffling</b> or {{dampening}} is {{an inherent}} part of playing. Often, timpanists will muffle notes so they only sound for the length indicated by the composer. However, early timpani did not resonate nearly as long as modern timpani, so composers often wrote a note when the timpanist was to hit the drum without concern for sustain. Today, timpanists must use their ear and the score to determine the length the note should sound.|$|E
25|$|Drummers use {{a variety}} of {{accessories}} when practicing. Metronomes and beat counters are used to develop a sense of a steady pulse. Drum <b>muffling</b> pads may be used to lessen the volume of drums during practicing. A practice pad, held on the lap, on a leg, or mounted on a stand, is used for near-silent practice with drumsticks. A set of practice pads mounted to simulate an entire drum kit is known as a practice kit. In the 2010s, these have largely been superseded by electronic drums, which can be listened to with headphones for quiet practice and kits with non-sounding mesh heads.|$|E
25|$|Believing his {{northern}} defenses secure, Blücher {{retired to}} his headquarters at the Golden Angel Inn near the Mühlentor. He was surprised there by Rivaud's skirmishers and barely escaped {{with his son}} and Karl Freiherr von <b>Müffling,</b> though his chief of staff, Gerhard von Scharnhorst {{and the rest of}} his staff became prisoners. Meanwhile, the French pushed through the market-place and the Königstrasse amid vicious street fighting in which Yorck was wounded and many other Prussians were killed or wounded. At the head of a troop of cuirassiers, Blücher tried without success to rescue his staff. Then the group cut their way to the bridge over the Trave and safety.|$|E

5000|$|The <b>muffles</b> of the {{concentration}} camp ovens were smaller that those for civil crematoria, because no {{space for a}} coffin was needed, which saved both space and fuel. Prüfer later designed ovens with <b>muffles</b> large enough for multiple bodies to be burned similtaneously. Later, in Topf & Söhne's instructions on using the ovens, they advised adding bodies to the <b>muffles</b> at 20 minute intervals as the previous body burned down. Bodies were often pushed in four, five or even six at once.|$|R
25|$|Typical ways to <b>muffle</b> a snare or tom include placing {{an object}} {{on the outer}} edge of the drumhead. A piece of cloth, a wallet, gel, or fitted rings made of mylar are common objects. Also used are {{external}} clip-on <b>muffles</b> that work using the same principle. Internal mufflers that lie on the inside of the drumhead are often built into a drum, but are generally considered less effective than external <b>muffles,</b> as they stifle the initial tone, rather than simply reducing the sustain of it.|$|R
25|$|Sometimes {{the front}} {{head of a}} kit bass drum has {{a hole in it}} to allow air to escape when the drum is struck for shorter sustain. <b>Muffling</b> can be {{installed}} through the hole without taking off the front head. The hole also allows microphones to be placed into the bass drum for recording and amplification. In addition to microphones, sometimes trigger pads are used to amplify the sound and provide a uniform tone, especially when fast playing without decrease of volume is desired. Professional drummers often choose to have a customized bass drum front head, with the logo or name of their band on the front.|$|E
25|$|The drum {{head has}} the most effect on how a drum sounds. Each type of drum head serves its own musical purpose and has its own unique sound. Double-ply drumheads dampen high {{frequency}} harmonics because they are heavier and they are suited to heavy playing. Drum heads with a white, textured coating on them muffle the overtones of the drum head slightly, producing a less diverse pitch. Drum heads with central silver or black dots tend to muffle the overtones even more. And drum heads with perimeter sound rings mostly eliminate overtones (Howie 2005). Some jazz drummers avoid using thick drum heads, preferring single ply drum heads or drum heads with no <b>muffling.</b> Rock drummers often prefer the thicker or coated drum heads.|$|E
25|$|As a guitarist Perkins used finger picking, {{imitations of}} the pedal steel guitar, {{right-handed}} damping (<b>muffling</b> strings near the bridge with the palm), arpeggios, advantageous use of open strings, single and double string bending (pushing strings across the neck {{to raise their}} pitch), chromaticism (using notes outside of the scale), country and blues licks, and tritone and other tonality clashing licks (short phrases that include notes from other keys and move in logical, often symmetric patterns). A rich vocabulary of chords including sixth and thirteenth chords, ninth and add nine chords, and suspensions, show up in rhythm parts and solos. Free use of syncopations, chord anticipations (arriving at a chord change before the other players, often by an eighth-note) and crosspicking (repeating a three eighth-note pattern so that an accent falls variously on the upbeat or downbeat) are also in his bag of tricks.|$|E

25|$|Sacken's {{strength}} was variously given as 18,000 men and 90 guns by David G. Chandler, 14,000 soldiers and 80 guns by George Nafziger, and 18,000 soldiers by Francis Loraine Petre. Prussian staff officer Karl Freiherr von <b>Müffling</b> credited the Russians with 20,000 troops while another German officer counted 16,300 men and 90 guns. Sacken led two infantry and one cavalry corps. The foot soldiers belonged to Alexander Ivanovich Tallisin's VI Corps with the 7th and 18th Infantry Divisions and Ivan Andreievich Lieven's XI Corps with the 10th and 27th Infantry Divisions and a brigade from the 16th Division. The cavalry corps included Sergei Nicholaevich Lanskoi's 2nd Hussar Division and Semyon Davydovich Pandschulishev's 3rd Dragoon Division. Artillery chief Alexey Petrovich Nikitin directed three batteries of 12-pound cannons and four batteries of 6-pounders. Tallisin was acting corps commander {{in place of}} Alexei Grigorievich Scherbatov who was ill. The cavalry corps was directed by Ilarion Vasilievich Vasilshikov.|$|E

40|$|The <b>muffle</b> furnace {{main purpose}} is to anneal the rough sponge iron powder transported through it, which is done by burning natural gas. Heat is absorbed by the <b>muffle</b> and is {{transferred}} to the bed of sponge iron powder. In {{order to reduce the}} consumptions of fossil fuel, some companies of the industry aims to exchange the natural gas in their <b>muffle</b> furnace’s burners to syngas, produced from biomass. This will however affect the performance of the furnace in the heating aspect. For this work, it is assumed that the effect will be negative. Thus the aim {{of this study is to}} investigate how to compensate the loss of effect from the burners, by examining which other parameters have influence on the furnace heating performance of the sponge iron powder transported through the furnace. The investigation is executed by simulating a 1 meter of the furnace in COMSOL multiphysics for 10 min, not including the combustion chambers. The investigated parameters are the packing degree of the powder, surface emissivity of the <b>muffle,</b> process gas velocity, conveyor belt velocity and the heat transfer rate coefficient to <b>muffle</b> from the combustion chambers. Alas, the process gas velocity and conveyor belt velocity only have minor influence on the final result, according to this simulation. However, the simulation exhibited that the surface emissivity of the <b>muffle</b> and the packing degree of the powder has great impact on the heating of the powder and could compensate some of the lost effect from the burners. This could be obtained by using an unpolished and oxidized <b>muffle</b> surface, and use densely packed powder sample...|$|R

500|$|In his {{extensive}} {{survey of the}} Beatles' recording sessions, historian Mark Lewisohn confirmed that Starr was both proficient and remarkably reliable and consistent. According to Lewisohn, there were {{fewer than a dozen}} occasions in the Beatles' eight-year recording career where session breakdowns were caused by Starr making a mistake, while the vast majority of takes were stopped owing to mistakes by the other three Beatles. Starr is considered to have influenced various modern drumming techniques, such as the matched grip, tuning the drums lower, and using <b>muffling</b> devices on tonal rings, as well as placing the drums on high risers for visibility as part of the band. According to Ken Micallef and Donnie Marshall, co-authors of Classic Rock Drummers: [...] "Ringo's fat tom sounds and delicate cymbal work were imitated by thousands of drummers." ...|$|E
500|$|Katy Stevens {{notes that}} the {{dialogue}} in [...] "The Body" [...] was recorded with microphones {{very close to the}} actors, making variations in their voices—cracks, rises, and whispers—more prominent to the audience, to close the distance between the actors and the viewer. Conversely, the scene in which Dawn is told of Joyce's death was shot through a large classroom window, <b>muffling</b> Dawn's emotional reaction, to isolate Buffy and Dawn from the class and the audience. Several moments of silence follow this scene. Whedon shot the conversation up close several times, filming over-the-shoulder and reaction shots, but eventually went with a more distanced point of view. Michelle Trachtenberg later said of this effect, [...] "obviously you know in the end result there was no sound and I thought that was actually one of the most brilliant ideas [...] ever had because it allows everyone to sort of attach their own emotional plug into whatever might have happened in your life. I think it allowed the audience to really connect with Dawn for the first time." ...|$|E
