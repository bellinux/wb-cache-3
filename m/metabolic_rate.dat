40|$|<b>Metabolic</b> <b>rates</b> {{reflect the}} {{energetic}} {{cost of living}} but exhibit remarkable variation among conspecifics, {{partly as a result}} of the constraints imposed by environmental conditions. <b>Metabolic</b> <b>rates</b> are sensitive to changes in temperature and oxygen availability, but effects of food availability, particularly on maximum <b>metabolic</b> <b>rates,</b> are not well understood. Here, we show in brown trout (Salmo trutta) that maximum <b>metabolic</b> <b>rates</b> are immutable but minimum <b>metabolic</b> <b>rates</b> increase as a positive function of food availability. As a result, aerobic scope (i. e. the capacity to elevate metabolism above baseline requirements) declines as food availability increases. These differential changes in <b>metabolic</b> <b>rates</b> likely have important consequences for how organisms partition available metabolic power to different functions under the constraints imposed by food availability...|$|R

Macaroni Penguins (Eudyptes chrysolophus) and Rockhopper Penguins (E. chrysocome) breed sympatrically at Marion Island in the sub-Antarctic, {{where they}} account for a {{substantial}} proportion of the avian biomass breeding at the island. This thesis documents the energy requirements of the two species during their respective breeding and moulting cycles at the island. Resting <b>metabolic</b> <b>rates,</b> calculated from lowest, stable rates of oxygen consumption over 24 h, averaged 25 % greater than basal <b>metabolic</b> <b>rates</b> predicted from allometric equations. Body temperatures of the penguins and the relationships between <b>metabolic</b> <b>rates</b> and temperature were investigated over a range of - 10 °C to 25 °C. Lower critical temperature of Rockhopper Penguins was between 0 °C and 5 °C, but that of Macaroni Penguins could not be clearly ascertained. Measured <b>metabolic</b> <b>rates</b> of other species of penguins are reviewed and intra- and inter-specific differences in <b>metabolic</b> <b>rates</b> are discussed.

5|$|Slow lorises have {{an unusually}} low basal <b>metabolic</b> <b>rate,</b> about 40% {{of the typical}} value for placental mammals of their size, {{comparable}} to that of sloths. Since they consume a relatively high-calorie diet that is available year-round, it has been proposed that this slow metabolism is due primarily to the need to eliminate toxic compounds from their food. For example, slow lorises can feed on Gluta bark, which may be fatal to humans.|$|E

40|$|Lecithotrophic, or non-feeding, marine {{invertebrate}} larvae generally have shorter pelagic larval durations (PLDs) than planktotrophic larvae. However, non-feeding larvae of scleractinian corals have PLDs far exceeding those of feeding larvae of other organisms and predictions of PLD based on energy reserves and <b>metabolic</b> <b>rates,</b> {{raising questions about}} how such longevity is achieved. Here, we measured temporal changes in <b>metabolic</b> <b>rates</b> and total lipid content of non-feeding larvae of four species of reef corals to determine whether changes in energy utilization through time contribute to extended larval durations. The temporal dynamics of both <b>metabolic</b> <b>rates</b> and lipid content were highly consistent among species. Prior to fertilization, <b>metabolic</b> <b>rates</b> were low (2. 73 – 8. 63 nmol O 2 larva⁻¹ h⁻¹) before rapidly increasing to a peak during embryogenesis and early development 1 – 2 days after spawning. <b>Metabolic</b> <b>rates</b> remained high until shortly after larvae first became competent to metamorphose and then declined by up to two orders of magnitude to levels at or below rates seen in unfertilized eggs over the following week. Larvae remained in this state of low metabolic activity for up to 2 months. Consistent with temporal patterns in <b>metabolic</b> <b>rates,</b> depletion of lipids was extremely rapid during early development and then slowed dramatically from 1 week onward. Despite the very low <b>metabolic</b> <b>rates</b> in these species, larvae continued to swim and retained competence for at least 2 months. The capacity of non-feeding coral larvae to enter a state of low metabolism soon after becoming competent to metamorphose significantly extends dispersal potential, thereby accruing advantages typically associated with planktotrophy, notably enhanced population connectivity...|$|R
5|$|The {{metabolic}} {{system of}} a particular organism determines which substances it will find nutritious and which poisonous.

5|$|Extant strepsirrhines have an epitheliochorial placenta, {{where the}} {{maternal}} blood {{does not come}} {{in direct contact with}} the fetal chorion like it does in the hemochorial placenta of haplorhines. The strepsirrhine uterus has two distinct chambers (bicornuate). Despite having similar gestation periods to comparably sized haplorhines, fetal growth rates are generally slower in strepsirrhines, which results in newborn offspring that are as little as one-third the size of haplorhine newborns. Extant strepsirrhines also have a lower basal <b>metabolic</b> <b>rate,</b> which elevates in females during gestation, putting greater demands on the mother.|$|E
5|$|Frogs have three-chambered hearts, {{a feature}} they share with lizards. Oxygenated {{blood from the}} lungs and de-oxygenated blood from the respiring tissues enter the heart through {{separate}} atria. When these chambers contract, the two blood streams pass into a common ventricle before being pumped via a spiral valve to the appropriate vessel, the aorta for oxygenated blood and pulmonary artery for deoxygenated blood. The ventricle is partially divided into narrow cavities which minimizes the mixing of {{the two types of}} blood. These features enable frogs to have a higher <b>metabolic</b> <b>rate</b> and be more active than would otherwise be possible.|$|E

After this animals were subjected to carcass analysis. No differences in RMR and ANMR between microtine populations from different latitudes were found, due to seasonal acclimatization {{in the field and}} acclimation during captivity. Northern populations have a lower water content than the southern populations. <b>Metabolic</b> <b>rates</b> and body composition are positively correlated with latitude, due to an increase in body mass and heart+kidney weight. ...|$|R

40|$|Pythons have {{standard}} <b>metabolic</b> <b>rates</b> {{and preferred}} body temperatures that {{are lower than}} those of most other reptiles. This study investigated <b>metabolic</b> <b>rates</b> and preferred body temperatures of seven taxa of Australian pythons. We found that Australian pythons have particularly low <b>metabolic</b> <b>rates</b> when compared with other boid snakes, and that the <b>metabolic</b> <b>rates</b> of the pythons did not change either seasonally or on a daily cycle. Preferred body temperatures do vary seasonally in some species but not in others. Across all species and seasons, the preferred body temperature range was only 4. 9 ˚C. The thermal sensitivity (Q 10) of oxygen consumption by pythons conformed to the established range of between 2 and 3. Allometric equations for the pooled python data at each of the experimental temperatures gave an equation exponent of 0. 72 – 0. 76, which is similar to previously reported values. By having low preferred body temperatures and low <b>metabolic</b> <b>rates,</b> pythons appear to be able to conserve energy while still maintaining a vigilant ‘sit and wait’ predatory existence. These physiological attributes would allow pythons to maximise the time they can spend ‘sitting and waiting’ in the pursuit of prey...|$|R
5|$|Lemurs {{have low}} basal {{metabolic}} rates (BMR), which helps them to conserve energy {{during the dry}} season, when water and food are scarce. They can optimize their energy use by lowering their <b>metabolic</b> <b>rate</b> to 20% below the values predicted for mammals of similar body mass. The red-tailed sportive lemur (Lepilemur ruficaudatus), for instance, reportedly {{has one of the}} lowest metabolic rates among mammals. Its low <b>metabolic</b> <b>rate</b> may be linked to its generally folivorous diet and relatively small body mass. Lemurs exhibit behavioral adaptations to complement this trait, including sunning behaviors, hunched sitting, group huddling, and nest sharing, in order to reduce heat loss and conserve energy. Dwarf lemurs and mouse lemurs exhibit seasonal cycles of dormancy to conserve energy. Before dry season, they will accumulate fat in white adipose tissue located {{at the base of the}} tail and hind legs, doubling their weight. At the end of the dry season, their body mass may fall to half of what it was prior to the dry season. Lemurs that do not experience states of dormancy are also able to shut down aspects of their metabolism for energy conservation.|$|E

Physiological and Biochemical Zoology, 88 (4), 371 - 383. doi: 10. 1086 / 681053 Variation {{in energy}} {{availability}} or maintenance costs in extreme environments can exert selection for efficient energy use, and reductions in organismal energy demand {{can be achieved}} in two ways: reducing body mass or metabolic suppression. Whether long-term exposure to extreme environmental conditions drives adaptive shifts in body mass or <b>metabolic</b> <b>rates</b> remains an open question. We studied body size variation and variation in routine <b>metabolic</b> <b>rates</b> in locally adapted populations of extremophile fish (Poecilia mexicana) living in toxic, hydrogen sulfide-rich springs and caves.

It must eat an estimated 25 to 38% of its own body weight in food each day to burn the calories necessary to counteract the loss of heat due to the cold water environment.

Most of its need for water is met through food, although, in contrast to most other marine mammals, it also drinks seawater.

However, younger loggerheads are more resistant to cold and do not become stunned until temperatures drop below 9°C. The loggerheads' migration helps to prevent instances of cold-stunning.

A loggerhead's body temperature increases in warmer waters more quickly than it decreases in colder water; their critical thermal maximum is currently unknown.|$|E

5|$|After hatching, the nymphs {{fall from}} the {{branches}} to seek {{a crack in the}} soil where they can burrow, often to a depth of 10–40cm (4–16in), by digging with their large forelegs. Larger species of cicada like A.curvicosta are thought to spend 2–8 years underground, during which time they grow and feed through their rostrum on the sap from tree roots. They moult five times before emerging from the ground to shed their final shell. Although consistently taking place at night, the emergence of the population is diffusely spread over the season in comparison to the more high-density Australian species. The sex ratio is about 1.15males to every female, consistent throughout the emergence. The <b>metabolic</b> <b>rate</b> over a period of about 6.5hours during emergence of A.curvicosta is about 1.8times the resting <b>metabolic</b> <b>rate</b> of the adult. A South East Queensland study reported nymphs would emerge on most tree species but avoid Norfolk pine (Araucaria heterophylla) and broad-leaved paperbark (Melaleuca quinquenervia). The adults are usually found between November and May but are sometimes observed as early as September and until as late as June. They were recorded as appearing every year, mainly in December and January in western Sydney, with a similar 92-day emergence period from late November until late February recorded in South East Queensland. This makes it one of the last Australian cicadas to emerge each season. The nymph grips onto the tree bark with all of its legs, swallows air and redistributes haemolymph to split the cast down the center of its back. It then extracts its head and clypeus by hunching its body, and when these have emerged, arches back to draw the legs out of their casing. It then slowly unfolds its wings, finally bending forward and gripping onto the front of the shell to free its abdomen. Once free it hangs for hours more as the wings harden.|$|E
5|$|Animals {{adapted to}} live in deserts are called xerocoles. There is no {{evidence}} that body temperature of mammals and birds is adaptive to the different climates, either of great heat or cold. In fact, with a very few exceptions, their basal <b>metabolic</b> <b>rate</b> is determined by body size, irrespective of the climate in which they live. Many desert animals (and plants) show especially clear evolutionary adaptations for water conservation or heat tolerance and so are often studied in comparative physiology, ecophysiology, and evolutionary physiology. One well-studied example is the specializations of mammalian kidneys shown by desert-inhabiting species. Many examples of convergent evolution have been identified in desert organisms, including between cacti and Euphorbia, kangaroo rats and jerboas, Phrynosoma and Moloch lizards.|$|E

Air sac extensions from the lungs occupy the centre of some bones. The sternum is wide and usually has a keel and the caudal vertebrae are fused.

40|$|Climatic {{warming is}} most {{pronounced}} in the polar regions. For marine ectotherms such as fish, temperature is a key abiotic factor, influencing metabolic processes.

Data of routine <b>metabolic</b> <b>rates</b> of Antarctic fish are scarce, and comparability of existing data sets is often problematic due to ecological differences between species and in experimental protocols. Our objective was to compare routine metabolism and thermal sensitivity of species with similar ecotypes but different thermal environments to assess possible ecological implications of warming waters on energy expenditure in Antarctic fish, a fauna characterised by geographic isolation, endemism and putative thermal adaptation. We measured routine <b>metabolic</b> <b>rates</b> of three benthic Antarctic fish species from low- and high-Antarctic regions at habitat temperature and during acute temperature increase.
