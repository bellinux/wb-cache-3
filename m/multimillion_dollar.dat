25|$|Within {{the last}} few years, Abilene, Texas, has {{steadily}} become the retail, residential, business, medical, and overall center of the surrounding Big Country. Commercial development was especially boosted in 2007, with several <b>multimillion</b> <b>dollar</b> projects throughout the entire city. Most of the recent development is concentrated in roughly four areas in Abilene: Southwest Drive, Catclaw Drive, and Buffalo Gap Road near the Winters Freeway to the southwest, as this area becomes a strong commercial sector {{as well as a}} good residential district; Buffalo Gap Road, Beltway South, and US Highway 83/84 near and beyond {{the outskirts of the city}} in the south with several housing developments; Loop 322 area and Oldham Ln to the southeast, also near and past the edge of the city with a mix of several residential subdivisions as well as the start of commercial growth; and State Highway 351/Ambler Avenue near Interstate 20 to the northeast, also a combination of staple retail development, similar to the southwest commercial development, and the beginnings of residential growth with a new apartment complex and growing subdivisions. All this growth has contributed to the suburbanization of the city; however, as Abilene is not a large city itself, this is also helped the urbanization of the city as a whole. More people in the city leads to more workers and commuters in a city that has a short commute time throughout the city.|$|E

40|$|Introduction Until {{the very}} recent time {{majority}} of AYUSH graduates {{were limited to}} their own field of study with few exceptions {{in the field of}} public health and allied areas. The reasons could be lack of awareness, unavailability of suitable job opportunity or a sense of insecurity in a relatively new and offbeat domain of work. However more recently, there is a paradigm shift; with increase in information access, awareness about job opportunities and a great degree of professional and personal satisfaction. This has led to a huge rush of these graduates in to the field of public health and allied areas. Objective To explore public health and allied career choices for AYUSH graduates with special reference to the scopes and opportunities in each of these fields. Methodology Review based study. Information was obtained by systematic search process using internet based Google, Google Scholar search engines. Discussion The results obtained were pertinent to the domain of public health and allied careers including Public health and related areas such as; Health and Hospital Management, Health Policy, Health Economics, Heath Care Financing, Epidemiology, Medical Sociology, Clinical Research, Pharmaceutical Management etc. it is observed that the placement and job opportunities are much more because of the rapid expansion of health care industry in India with endeavors from public and private stakeholders. There has been a <b>multimillion</b> <b>dollars</b> investment by various national and international donor agencies, pharmaceutical sector, central and state governments and the development partners.

Requires automobile premiums be determined primarily by driving record and miles driven; requires discounts for good drivers. Provides for public disclosure of insurance company operations. Repeals certain exemptions of insurance companies from state civil rights and antitrust laws. Makes Insurance Commissioner elected officer.

Although the Board of Equalization is to adjust insurance tax rates {{for the period of}} November 1988 to January 1, 1991 to compensate for the loss of state revenues from the gross premiums tax paid by insurers, such adjustment will be based on estimates of what the revenues from gross premiums {{would have been in the}} absence of this measure.

40|$|A {{question}} asked by many baseball fans {{during the past}} two decades has been, “Do baseball players really earn <b>multimillion</b> <b>dollars</b> salaries by simply playing a game?” Previous studies have attempted to show that they go generate enough revenue for a given club to justify these exorbitant earnings. In fact, these studies show that, until recently, baseball players have been exploited by owners who have been reaping major profits at the expense of the players. Most studies utilize fan attendance to generate revenue figures in their respective regression equations. The intent in this paper is to determine if baseball players salaries are dependent solely on their ability to draw fans to their respective balls parks. Once a fan drawing power estimate is established, analysis will be made as to whether salaries are based upon this factor. Estimating the average amount fans will spend while attending games will also allow the comparison of revenue estimates with salaries. And finally, a brief investigation will determine if free agent status has any bearing on salary in conjunction with fan drawing power. Data from the 1991 baseball season, from all twenty six major league teams, for both hitters and pitchers, are included in this study. The analysis of this data was made through the two equation model perfected by Scully in his often referenced paper of 1974, where he estimated baseball players marginal revenue products, allowing comparisons to player salaries. The results demonstrate that in 1991 player salaries were not based solely on their ability to draw fans to the ballpark. Establishing a fan revenue figure also shows that, on average baseball players do generate enough revenue to substantiate salaries in the $ 2. 0 -$ 2. 5 million range. Finally, utilizing a free agent attribute illustrates that simply playing baseball over six years will substantially increase salaries, regardless of the player’s status. In fact, the non-free agent players earn two and one half times less than their free agent counterparts but have the same revenue generating abilities. The final conclusions are the choice of the reader; the author has only attempted to collect the facts and present them for your review...|$|R
