50|$|For example, a 15-inch (38 cm) display whose {{dimensions}} {{work out}} to 12 inches (30.48 cm) wide by 9 inches (22.86 cm) high, {{capable of a}} maximum 1024×768 (or XGA) pixel resolution, can display around 85 PPI in both the horizontal and vertical directions. This figure is determined by dividing the width (or height) of the display area in pixels by the width (or height) of the display area in inches.

40|$|Computer vision {{algorithms}} {{have been}} widely used for many applications, including traffic monitoring, autonomous driving, robot path planning and navigation, object detection and medical image analysis, etc. Images and videos are typical input to computer vision algorithms and the performance of computer vision algorithms are highly correlated with the quality of input signal. The quality of videos and images are impacted by vision sensors; environmental conditions, such as lighting, rain, fog and wind. Therefore, it is a very active research issue to determine the failure mode of computer vision by automatically measuring the quality of images and videos. In the literature, many algorithms have been proposed to measure image and video qualities using reference images. However, measuring the quality of image and video without using a reference image, known as no-reference image quality assessment, is a very challenging problem. Most existing methods use a manual feature extraction and a classification technique to model image and video quality. Internal image statics are considered as feature vectors and classical machine learning techniques such as support vector machine and naive Bayes as the classifier. Using convolutional neural network (CNN) to learn the internal statistic of distorted images is a newly developed but efficient way to solve the problem. However, there are also new challenges in image quality assessment field. One of them is the wide spread of computer vision systems. Those systems, like human viewers, also demand a certain method to measure the quality of input images, but with their own standards. Inspired by the challenge, in this thesis, we propose to build an image quality assessment system based on convolutional neural network that can work for both human and computer vision system. In specific, we build 2 models: DAQ 1 and DAQ 2 with different design concept and evaluate their performance. Both models can work well with human visual system and outperform most former state-of-art Image Quality Assessment (IQA) methods. On computer vision system side, the models also show certain level of prediction power and reveal the potential of CNNs in facing this challenge. The performance in estimating image quality is first evaluated using 2 standard data-sets and against three state-of-the art image quality methods. Further, the performance in automatically detecting the failure <b>mode</b> <b>computer</b> vision algorithm is evaluated using Miovision's computer vision algorithm and datasets...|$|E
40|$|Starting from silicon on {{insulator}} (SOI) material, with a top silicon {{layer thickness}} of 100 nm, silicon nanowires were fabricated in a top down approach using electron beam (e-beam) lithography and subsequent eactive ion etching (RIE) and oxidation. Nanowires as narrow as 30 nm could be achieved. Further size reduction was done using electrochemical etching and/or oxidation. The nanowires were contacted creating drain, source and back gate contacts and characterized showing similar behavior as Schottky Barrier Metal Oxide Semiconductor Field Effect Transistors (SB-MOSFETs). As an alternative, by thinning the top silicon layer down nanoribbons, ~ 1 μm wide, with a thickness down to 45 nm could be produced using standard optical lithography showing similar behavior as the nanowires. The conduction mechanism for these devices is through electrons in an inversion current layer for positive back gate voltages and through holes in accumulation mode for negative back gate voltages. When the threshold voltage is extrapolated for the nanowires and the nanoribbons it scales with inverse width and thickness respectively, attributed to charged surface and/or interface states affecting more narrow/thinner devices essentially due to increased {{surface to volume ratio}}. Nanowires were functionalized with 3 -aminopropyl triethoxysilane (APTES) molecules creating amino groups on the surface reactive to pH buffer solutions. By exposing the nanowires to buffer solutions of different pH value the conduction mechanism changed due to the surface becoming more or less negative. Threshold voltage shifts from pH = 3 to pH = 9 were seen to scale with inverse width again attributed to the larger surface to volume ratio for more narrow devices. Simulations confirm this behavior and further show that a charge change of a few elementary charges on the nanowire surface can alter the conductance significantly. Upon addition of the buffer solutions the channel is seen to be quenched for small drain bias attributed to negative surface charges screening the electron current. However, as the drain bias is increased the channel is restored. Computer simulations confirmed this behavior and further showed that the restoration of the channel was due to an avalanche process. A biomolecule detection experiment was set up using the specific binding of biotin to streptavidin. By functionalizing the nanoribbon with biotin molecules the current can be logged and as streptavidin molecules are added the current decreases (increases) if the nanoribbon is run in inversion (accumulation) mode due to the negative charge of the streptavidin molecule, delivered upon binding to biotin. A sensitivity significantly below the picomolar range was observed, corresponding to less than 20 streptavidin molecules attaching to the nanoribbon surface, assuming a homogeneous binding to the biotinylated surface. By decreasing the nanoribbon thickness the response was increased, a behavior attributed to the larger surface to volume ratio of these devices. The response was seen to be larger in the accumulation mode whereas close to the lower oxide in inversion <b>mode.</b> <b>Computer</b> simulations showed that this was due to the hole current running closer to the functionalized surface in accumulation mode and opposite in inversion mode. This was further investigated for different nanoribbon thicknesses and the response was shown to increase with inverse nanoribbon thickness again attributed to the larger surface to volume ratio. The nanoribbon has the advantage of simpler fabrication using standard optical lithography in comparison with e-beam lithography and it may provide a useful scheme for a practical biomolecule sensor.
