5|$|Russell Bryan was an {{enrolled}} {{member of}} the White Earth Band of Ojibwe, which is a component band of the Minnesota Chippewa Tribe. He married Helen Charwood in 1957. Helen was an enrolled {{member of the}} Leech Lake Band of Ojibwe, which was {{also a part of}} the Minnesota Chippewa Tribe. They raised their children on reservation land and lived in a <b>mobile</b> <b>home</b> which they purchased in 1971. The <b>mobile</b> <b>home</b> was located on the Greater Leech Lake Indian Reservation near Squaw Lake in Itasca County, Minnesota. Bryan's <b>mobile</b> <b>home,</b> had it not been on the reservation, would have been subject to taxes from Itasca County. In June 1972, Itasca County notified Bryan that the <b>mobile</b> <b>home</b> was subject to US$147.95 in taxes. The Bryans could not afford to pay the tax, and contacted the Leech Lake Reservation Legal Services Project (Legal Services) for help, noting that the <b>mobile</b> <b>home</b> was on Indian land.|$|E

5|$|However, it {{is highly}} {{unlikely}} that single-story structures such as mobile homes can have a substantial effect on tornado development or evolution. More people are killed in trailer parks because mobile homes are less able to withstand high winds than permanent structures. Winds which can demolish or roll a <b>mobile</b> <b>home</b> may only cause roof damage to a typical one- or two-family permanent residence. Another likely contributing factor to the continued propagation of this myth is confirmation bias: whenever a new instance of a tornado hitting a <b>mobile</b> <b>home</b> park occurs, media outlets report on it more extensively, ignoring damage to the surrounding area which may not have produced as many casualties.|$|E

5|$|The tornado {{crossed the}} Ohio River {{a third time}} back into Indiana and across the {{southern}} fringes of Evansville. Here, the tornado ripped directly through the Eastbrook <b>Mobile</b> <b>Home</b> Park, obliterating numerous mobile homes and killing 20 people. Of about 350 mobile homes in the park, 100 were destroyed and another 125 were damaged. The coroner reported {{that most of the}} victims were probably killed instantly, many by spine and skull fractures. Several bodies were carried almost two hundred yards. The tornado then crossed into Warrick County, Indiana at the Angel Mounds State Historic Site. Several permanent homes were destroyed in this area, along with many others {{on the north side of}} Newburgh. Past Newburgh, the tornado reached its peak intensity (high-end F3) as it tore through an industrial park near Paradise. Further northeast, the tornado passed just south of Boonville and caused a fatality in a <b>mobile</b> <b>home.</b> The tornado then tore directly through the small community of DeGonia Springs, tossing vehicles and destroying homes. Some of the homes in the community were leveled, and three people were killed in a <b>mobile</b> <b>home</b> in this area. The tornado began to rapidly weaken as it passed just south of Tennyson, and then dissipated as it crossed into Spencer County, Indiana. Overall, the tornado damaged or destroyed 500 buildings, killed 25 people, and injured 230 others.|$|E

5|$|After 12:17UTC, the tornado's {{position}} fluctuated between Benton and Washington {{counties in}} northwestern Arkansas. Permanent houses were damaged and mobile homes were destroyed. Numerous trees were uprooted or snapped while many other power poles were snapped. Two {{people were injured}} following {{the destruction of a}} <b>mobile</b> <b>home</b> within the Ozark National Forest in Benton County, while another person was injured west of Tontitown, Arkansas in Washington County.

5|$|If {{a person}} spots a nearby tornado while driving, the {{official}} National Weather Service directive {{has been for}} the individual to abandon the car and seek shelter in a ditch or culvert, or substantial shelter if nearby. Far-away, highly visible tornadoes, however, can be successfully fled from at right angles (90-degrees) from its direction of apparent movement. Despite dangers inherent with operating a vehicle during a tornado, given sufficient advance warning, <b>mobile</b> <b>home</b> residents have been instructed by the National Weather Service to drive to the nearest secure shelter during a warning.|$|E
5|$|Rainfall up to 5in (127mm) in Massachusetts {{caused a}} river in Somerset to {{overflow}} its banks, flooding nearby areas with 2feet (0.6m) of water. A large sinkhole formed on County Street and several cars were {{stranded in the}} floodwaters. Two people had to be rescued by boat when their car was overcome by the floodwaters. In addition, numerous basements were flooded. Damages in Bristol County were estimated at $25,000. A <b>mobile</b> <b>home</b> park in Plymouth County was inundated with 2.5ft (0.7m) of water, causing one home to shift off its foundation. Damages to the homes were estimated at $50,000.|$|E

Rainfall of 8inches (200mm) was reported near the Atascosca County line with an isolated report of 12inches (300mm) in other areas. The rainfall caused severe flashflooding which forced people to flee to roof tops. Damage to buildings, roads and crops totaled up to $800,000 (2002USD; $940,0002007USD).|$|E

5|$|In 2008, Wong created Wandering Home, an {{installation}} {{consisting of a}} <b>mobile</b> <b>home</b> conceptualised on city living and the homeless, which was shown at the Venice Biennale of Architecture. The small tin hut {{on the back of}} a tricycle is a comment on Hong Kong society, and the plight of people who sleep on the streets and who are forced to move on periodically by government officials. Costing HK$5,000 to make, the house is not exactly a practical solution to the homeless, but the concept was tried out on street sleepers in Sham Shui Po. In 2008, Wong created Tin Man No.11, an essay in space in the form of a metallic robot that transforms into a bed. He extended the concept by creating Famiglia Grande, a series of transformable cases. In 2009, Wong attended the Subvision Festival in Hamburg as a skyscraper.|$|E

Residents in <b>mobile</b> <b>home</b> parks, {{as well as}} campgrounds, were advised to evacuate, and 13 jurisdictions opened shelters by August 26. State Governor Jim Gilmore declared a State of Emergency, and as a result, the State Emergency Operations Center was activated. Beaches and piers were shut down in Virginia Beach, Hampton, and Gloucester counties, where communities canceled some local events due {{to the threat of}} Bonnie. Voluntary evacuations throughout the state were issued, and some hotels reached maximum capacity as a result. Roughly 60 Navy ships were ordered to leave port at Norfolk, and ride out the storm far out to sea. The State of Virginia banned swimming along the coast.

Plans also call for building a service road with another overpass that would provide access to Delilah Road. Another project involves the installation of an overpass {{at the end of}} Amelia Earhart Boulevard next to the entrance to the FAA tech center.
