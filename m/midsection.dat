5|$|Originally, dubstep {{releases}} {{had some}} structural {{similarities to other}} genres like drum and bass and UK garage. Typically this would comprise an intro, a main section (often incorporating a bass drop), a <b>midsection,</b> a second main section similar to the first (often with another drop), and an outro.|$|E
5|$|Heinrich Mallison in 2011 {{argued that}} Opisthocoelicaudia {{was able to}} angle the {{anterior}} part of the tail against the posterior part, producing a buckle in <b>midsection.</b> Thus, the anterior part {{would have been more}} straight during rearing than in other sauropods. In 2005, Wilson assumed that rearing was an innovation not only of Opisthocoelicaudia but also of related genera within the subfamily Saltasaurinae. Common features of these genera, such as the shortened tail, may have evolved as adaptations to rearing.|$|E
5|$|Leaving Denver, {{the highway}} serves the {{redevelopment}} {{areas on the}} former site of Stapleton International Airport; runway 17R/35L crossed over the Interstate at the runway's <b>midsection.</b> East of Aurora, I-70 rejoins the alignment of U.S. Highway40 at Colfax Avenue. The freeway proceeds east across the Great Plains, briefly dipping south to serve the city of Limon, which bills itself as Hub City because of the many rail and road arteries that intersect there. I-70 enters Kansas near Burlington, a small community known for {{having one of the}} oldest carousels in the United States.|$|E
50|$|The Cordillera Blanca {{lies in the}} Ancash {{region and}} runs {{parallel}} to the Santa River valley (also called Callejón de Huaylas on its upper and <b>midsections)</b> on the west. Huascarán National Park, established in 1975, encompasses almost {{the entire range of}} the Cordillera Blanca.|$|R
50|$|A. sexdens {{follows the}} basic body plan of ants fairly closely. They have sharp spikes or hooks rising from {{their heads and}} <b>midsections</b> to deter predators. Another {{distinguishing}} feature is a relatively large, two-lobed head. Its purpose is to accommodate the large muscles moving the well-developed mandibles.|$|R
50|$|By {{the early}} 21st century three interrelated themes had emerged. The first is for {{functional}} buildings such as bridges which can elevate their <b>midsections</b> to allow tall ships to pass, or stadiums with retractable roofs {{such as the}} Veltins-Arena, Millennium Stadium in Cardiff, or Wembley Stadium.|$|R
5|$|There {{are very}} few Arabians {{registered}} as roan, and according to researcher D. Phillip Sponenberg, roaning in purebred Arabians is actually the action of rabicano genetics. Unlike a genetic roan, rabicano is a partial roan-like pattern; the horse does not have intermingled white and solid hairs over the entire body, only on the <b>midsection</b> and flanks, the head and legs are solid-colored. Some people also confuse a young gray horse with a roan because of the intermixed hair colors common to both. However, a roan does not consistently lighten with age, while a gray does.|$|E
5|$|Zeus B {{had been}} test fired at both White Sands and the Zeus base on Kwajalein. For Nike-X, the {{extended}} range EX model was planned, replacing Zeus' second stage {{with a larger}} model that provided more thrust through the <b>midsection</b> of the boost phase. Also known as the DM-15X2, the EX was renamed Spartan in January 1967. The Spartan never flew {{as part of the}} original Nike-X, and its first flight in March 1968 took place under Sentinel.|$|E
5|$|Attempts {{by three}} tugs from Cardiff {{to remove the}} wreck were unsuccessful, but the next spring tide carried the <b>midsection</b> up the estuary onto Town Bar, {{opposite}} Padstow, where it was a hazard to shipping. A miner named Pope {{was called in to}} remove it: he used gelignite without success, though the explosion was reported to have broken many windows in the town. In 2010 a wreck, identified as almost certainly the Antoinette, surfaced on Town Bar. The Royal Navy Bomb Disposal Unit failed to demolish it and it was marked with a buoy; in March 2011 work started to demolish the remainder of it using saws.|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: Common rafters without collar beams form {{most of this}} roof. There is {{not always}} a ridge board or beam where the rafter tops meet. Under the <b>midsections</b> of the rafters are purlins which support the common rafters and are {{supported}} by principal rafters. This roof ends in an octagonal hip.|$|R
5000|$|... ===Facelift=== The C3 {{was given}} a minor {{redesign}} in October 2005, with the front end featuring a more imposing bumper, wider lower air intake, single air intake slit below the restyled radiator grille, and a re positioned number plate. The rear of the car was also given redesigned light clusters, with crystal coloured <b>midsections.</b>|$|R
50|$|Artwork for {{the covers}} of volumes two, three, four, and five is by the artist Kozyndan. They feature bunnies in out-of-character {{situations}} on their covers, including hanging from helium balloons (two) and in washing machines (three). The bunnies {{on the cover of}} four begin as amoeba and diagonally evolve into bunnies. The cover of volume five has several bunnies with their <b>midsections</b> replaced with springs.|$|R
5|$|H. altispinus {{shared the}} Horseshoe Canyon Formation with fellow hadrosaurids Edmontosaurus and Saurolophus, hypsilophodont Parksosaurus, ankylosaurid Anodontosaurus, nodosaurid Edmontonia, horned dinosaurs Montanoceratops, Anchiceratops, Arrhinoceratops, and Pachyrhinosaurus, pachycephalosaurid Stegoceras, ostrich-mimics Ornithomimus and Struthiomimus, {{a variety of}} poorly known small theropods {{including}} troodontids and dromaeosaurids, and the tyrannosaurs Albertosaurus and Daspletosaurus. The dinosaurs from this formation are sometimes known as Edmontonian, after a land mammal age, and are distinct {{from those in the}} formations above and below. The Horseshoe Canyon Formation is interpreted as having a significant marine influence, due to an encroaching Western Interior Seaway, the shallow sea that covered the <b>midsection</b> of North America through much of the Cretaceous. H. altispinus may have preferred to stay more landward.|$|E
5|$|Hilde {{appears as}} a slender woman with long, red hair. Her primary {{appearance}} encases her fully in form-fitting body armor, with red and black fabric underneath. A wolf's head, the character's family symbol, extends from the right pauldron and covers her helmet's visor, while the left pauldron is covered by red fabric, fastened {{to the center of}} her breastplate's collar underneath a large brooch. Beneath the armor, a red coat covers her torso, the tail of which extends past her waist. Her alternate character design consists of a long, blue dress, extending to her feet and neck, exposing her shoulders and angled towards her right leg. White gloves, shoes, and stockings cover her arms and legs, while a darker colored sash surrounds her waist and <b>midsection,</b> also angled to the right.|$|E
5|$|In the chaetonotidans, the {{excretory}} system {{consists of}} {{a single pair of}} protonephridia, which open through separate pores on the lateral underside of the animal, usually in the <b>midsection</b> of the body. In the macrodasyidans, there are several pairs of these opening {{along the side of the}} body. Nitrogenous waste is probably excreted through the body wall, as part of respiration, and the protonephridia are believed to function mainly in osmoregulation. Unusually, the protonephridia do not take the form of flame cells, but, instead, the excretory cells consist of a skirt surrounding a series of cytoplasmic rods that in turn enclose a central flagellum. These cells, termed cyrtocytes, connect to a single outlet cell which passes the excreted material into the protonephridial duct.|$|E
2500|$|Chuckwallas are stocky, wide-bodied lizards with {{flattened}} <b>midsections</b> {{and prominent}} bellies. Their tails are thick, tapering to a blunt tip. [...] Loose folds of skin characterize {{the neck and}} sides of their bodies, which are covered in small, coarsely granular scales. The common chuckwalla (Sauromalus ater) measures 15 3/4 inches long, whereas insular species such as the San Esteban chuckwalla of San Esteban Island (Sauromalus varius) can measure as long as 30 in.|$|R
50|$|Peninsular chuckwallas are stocky, wide-bodied lizards with {{flattened}} <b>midsections</b> {{and prominent}} bellies. Their tails are thick, tapering to a blunt tip. Loose folds of skin characterize their necks {{and sides of}} their bodies, which are covered in small, coarsely moderately keeled scales. Their base color is tan to yellow with darker brown or black transverse bands, the centers of which are speckled with the lighter ground color, giving a double striped look from a distance.|$|R
50|$|Originally the Daleks were to {{be armed}} with flamethrowers, but these were vetoed on health and safety grounds and because they were {{considered}} too frightening for a young audience. Instead, the guns produced jets of CO2 gas from internally mounted fire extinguishers. Some of the Daleks used in the background for crowd scenes were constructed from moulded fibreglass, and can be distinguished by the slightly different shape of the collars around their <b>midsections.</b>|$|R
5|$|For {{those who}} were not injured or killed {{outright}} by moving objects, there was little time to reach safety, especially for the men who were manning the guns on the main deck or fetching ammunition and supplies in the hold. The companionways that connected the decks with one another would have become bottlenecks for fleeing men, something indicated by the positioning of many of the skeletons recovered from the wreck. What turned the sinking into a major tragedy in terms of lives lost was the anti-boarding netting that covered the upper decks in the waist (the <b>midsection</b> of the ship) and the sterncastle. With the exception of the men who were stationed in the tops in the masts, most of those who managed to get up from below deck were trapped under the netting; they would have been in view of the surface, and their colleagues above, but with little or no chance to break through, and were dragged down with the ship. Out of a crew of at least 400, fewer than 35 escaped, a catastrophic casualty rate of over 90%.|$|E
5|$|S. osborni {{is known}} {{only from the}} upper part (unit 4) of the Horseshoe Canyon Formation. It lived {{alongside}} other dinosaur species including the ornithopods Hypacrosaurus altispinus and Parksosaurus warreni, ankylosaurid Anodontosaurus lambei, pachycephalosaurid Sphaerotholus edmontonense, ornithomimids Ornithomimus brevitertius and an unnamed species of Struthiomimus, small theropods including Atrociraptor marshalli and Albertonykus borealis, and the tyrannosauroid Albertosaurus sarcophagus. The dinosaurs from this formation form part of the Edmontonian land vertebrate age. The Horseshoe Canyon Formation is interpreted as having a significant marine influence, due to an encroaching Western Interior Seaway, the shallow sea that covered the <b>midsection</b> of North America {{through much of the}} Cretaceous. S. osborni may have preferred to stay inland. A 2001 study suggested that Saurolophus osborni was part of a distinct inland fauna characterized by an association between Anchiceratops ornatus and it, while the contemporary coastal fauna was characterized by the association of Pachyrhinosaurus canadensis and Edmontosaurus regalis. However, the association between S. osborni and Anchiceratops was later noted to be in error, Anchiceratops only occurs lower in the Horseshoe Canyon Formation, before the major transgression of the Western Interior Seaway represented by the Drumheller Marine Tongue.|$|E
25|$|Lines S1, S2 and S25 are north-south {{lines that}} use the North-South tunnel as their <b>midsection.</b> They were equally {{distributed}} into Oranienburg, Bernau and Hennigsdorf in the north, and Teltow Stadt, Lichtenrade and Wannsee.|$|E

5000|$|Jinhua ham is {{traditionally}} produced using the hind {{legs of a}} breed of pigs native to China known as the [...] "two ends black" [...] (兩頭烏), which have black hair growing on their heads and hindquarters with white <b>midsections.</b> This breed is quick to mature, has excellent meat quality, and thin skin. Ham production begins when air temperatures drops below 10 C. The process takes approximately 8 to 10 months to complete.|$|R

Products of digestion (sugars, amino acids, and fatty acids) are absorbed into the bloodstream here.|$|E
40|$|International audienceFaithful {{chromosome}} segregation requires correct {{positioning of the}} spindle during mitosis. In this issue of Developmental Cell, Toyoshima et al. describe a new mechanism for spindle orientation involving phosphatidylinositol- 3, 4, 5 -triphosphate [PtdIns(3, 4, 5) P 3]. They found that in metaphase cells, dynactin {{was associated with the}} cortex through the actin cytoskeleton, and accumulated in the <b>midsections</b> in a PtdIns(3, 4, 5) P 3 -dependent manner. Thus, PtdIns(3, 4, 5) P 3 regulates spindle orientation through dynein-dynactin motor complexes...|$|R
50|$|The GMT800 {{introduced}} a three section frame system, {{which could be}} mixed and matched depending on the wheelbase, GVWR, and body type fitted to the platform, rather than a single piece long frame. The front section was hydroformed. The middle and rear sections were roll formed or stamped, depending on application. This gives greater flexibility to the platform. A total of four front modules, seven <b>midsections,</b> and four rear sections were created to mix and match for nearly 40 different truck configurations.|$|R
5000|$|Gathara-ini Stream [...] {{originates}} in marshes {{in the lower}} reaches of Aberdare mountains and flows through human settled areas. The stream experiences different impacts originating from anthropogenic sources along the channels and in the catchment. In the upper sections of Kiambaa and Kanunga areas, the stream passes through swampy and marshy areas, with subsistence agriculture and human settlement being the main types of land use. In <b>midsections</b> of Kiambu, extensive coffee estates and intensive mixed farming are the major forms of land use.|$|R
25|$|The one {{exception}} to the supposed 'look but don't touch'-policy was the so-named boat no. 10, which was slowly appearing due to apparent soil erosion. For five days, archaeologists carefully examined the <b>midsection</b> of the ship. They uncovered wooden planks, disintegrated rope, and reed bundles. Wood-eating ants had reduced much of the ship's hull to frass (ant excrement), but the frass had retained {{the shape of the}} original hull. The <b>midsection</b> of this boat revealed the construction methods used and confirmed the oldest ‘planked’ constructed boat yet discovered. The boat's construction revealed it had been constructed from the outside in, as there was no internal frame. Averaging 75ft long and 7–10ft wide at their greatest width, these boats were only about two feet deep, with narrow prows and sterns. Several boats were white-plastered, as were the Abydos tombs, and no. 10 was painted yellow.|$|E
25|$|The {{baseline}} LoADS {{design was}} a single-stage missile consisting of three stacked conical sections; a pointed conical nose-cone, a slightly flared cylinder through the <b>midsection</b> forming {{the majority of}} the missile body, and a flared rear section surrounding the rocket nozzles. It was very similar to the upper stage of the Sprint missile, although lacking the Sprint's small aerodynamic fins.|$|E
25|$|The RC has {{a shorter}} {{wheelbase}} than the XE30 series IS {{though it is}} longer overall. The platform shares {{the front end of}} the L10 series GS, <b>midsection</b> from the XE20 series IS convertible, while the rear componentry is from the XE30 series IS. The RC has three LED lamps in the triangular headlights and 18-inch five-spoke alloy wheels as standard, or 19-inch ten-spoke rims as option.|$|E

Before slicing, emitter and collector regions are formed {{on the narrow}} sides of the filaments, and after slicing gate regions are formed in arrow strips extending longitudinally along the <b>midsections</b> of the wide sides of the filaments. Contacts are then formed on the emitter, collector and gate regions of each filament individually for a single filament device, or in parallel for an array of filament devices to increase load current...|$|R
50|$|Barelees Pond is {{situated}} in the north-east of England, immediately south of the Anglo-Scottish border in the county of Northumberland, some 0.95 mi south-east {{of the town of}} Cornhill-on-Tweed. The pond lies within mildly undulating terrain circa 45 m above sea level, and is oval in shape, some 0.11 mi north to south and 0.07 mi east-west. An island has formed to occupy much of the south and <b>midsections</b> of the pond, fringed at the south by a moat of water, the substantial remains of the pond lying to the north end.|$|R
50|$|Aber Taf {{is listed}} as an SSSI for its {{saltmarsh}} vegetation, and for two sorts of migratory fish, allis shad (Alosa alosa) and twaite shad (Alosa fallax), {{as well as for}} the wider marine and intertidal habitats of the area which support wintering wildfowl. The site has a number of graduated zones of saltmarsh, their composition and species dependent on the amount of tidal inundation and grazing. Fine muds predominate in the upper reaches of the three river estuaries; muddy sands are found in the <b>midsections,</b> and clean sand in the mouth of the estuary.|$|R
