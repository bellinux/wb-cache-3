5|$|General Woundwort: The main antagonist: a fearless, cunning and brutally {{efficient}} rabbit who was orphaned {{at a young}} age, Woundwort {{founded the}} Efrafa warren and is its tyrannical chief. Though larger and stronger than Bigwig, he lacks <b>mercy</b> <b>and</b> kindness. He even leads an attack to destroy the Watership warren {{as an act of}} revenge against Bigwig stealing does from Efrafa, which is narrowly defeated by Hazel's ingenuity and Bigwig's bravery.

5|$|Ned confronts Queen Cersei, {{telling her}} that he knows Prince Joffrey and his {{siblings}} are not King Robert's children, but were incestuously fathered by her brother Jaime. Cersei defends her affair with Jaime, comparing it to the ancient Targaryen practice of wedding brothers to sisters and saying she tried to love Robert, {{but he refused to}} love her because he was still in love with Ned's deceased sister, Lyanna. Ned shows Cersei <b>mercy</b> <b>and</b> tells her to leave the capital with her children before he tells Robert the truth.|$|E

Believing Luke is finally broken, the Captain stops the punishment. Boss Paul warns Luke that he will be killed if ever he runs away again, which Luke promises in tears not to do. The prisoners begin to lose their idealized image of Luke, and one tears up the photograph of Luke with the women.|$|E

5|$|Gulls {{are one of}} {{the most}} {{commonly}} seen seabirds, given their use of human-made habitats (such as cities and dumps) and their often fearless nature. They therefore also have made it into the popular consciousness – they have been used metaphorically, as in Jonathan Livingston Seagull by Richard Bach, or to denote a closeness to the sea, such as their use in The Lord of the Rings both in the insignia of Gondor and therefore Númenor (used in the design of the films), and to call Legolas to (and across) the sea. Other species have also made an impact; pelicans have long been associated with <b>mercy</b> <b>and</b> altruism because of an early Western Christian myth that they split open their breast to feed their starving chicks.|$|E
5|$|Monmouth {{fled from}} the field of battle, but was {{captured}} in a ditch on 8 July (either at Ringwood in the New Forest, or at Horton in Dorset).

Despite begging for <b>mercy</b> <b>and</b> claims of conversion to Roman Catholicism, he was beheaded at Tower Hill by Jack Ketch on 15 July 1685. It is said that it took multiple blows of the axe to sever his head. Though some sources say it took eight blows, the official Tower of London website says it took five blows, while Charles Spencer, in his book Blenheim, claims it was seven. His dukedoms of Monmouth and Buccleuch were forfeited, but the subsidiary titles of the dukedom of Monmouth were restored to the Duke of Buccleuch.|$|E

5|$|After {{the death}} of Aurangzeb in 1707, the Mughal Empire's {{influence}} declined rapidly as the Hindu Maratha Empire from Deccan Plateau rose to prominence. In 1737, Maratha forces sacked Delhi following their victory against the Mughals in the First Battle of Delhi. In 1739, the Mughal Empire lost the huge Battle of Karnal {{in less than three}} hours against the numerically outnumbered but militarily superior Persian army led by Nader Shah of Persia. After his invasion, he completely sacked and looted Delhi, carrying away immense wealth including the Peacock Throne, the Daria-i-Noor, and Koh-i-Noor. The Mughals, severely further weakened, could never overcome this crushing defeat and humiliation which also left the way open for more invaders to come, including eventually the British. Nader eventually agreed to leave the city and India after forcing the Mughal emperor Muhammad Shah I to beg him for <b>mercy</b> <b>and</b> granting him the keys {{of the city and the}} royal treasury. A treaty signed in 1752 made Marathas the protectors of the Mughal throne in Delhi.|$|E

Timon, Pumbaa, Rafiki, Zazu, and the lionesses fend off the hyenas while Scar, {{attempting}} to escape, is cornered by Simba at the top of Pride Rock.
