Pointing accuracy is 0.04 degree {{with respect to the}} inertial reference frame and 0.8 degree with respect to the Mars orbital frame. Three on-board systems help Mars Express maintain a very precise pointing accuracy, which is essential to allow the spacecraft to communicate with a 35-metre and 70-metre dish on Earth up to 400 million kilometres away.|$|E
25|$|Three-axis MEMS-based {{gyroscopes}} {{are also}} being used in portable electronic devices such as tablets, smartphones, and smartwatches. This adds to the 3-axis acceleration sensing ability available on previous generations of devices. Together these sensors provide 6 component motion sensing; acceleration for X,Y, and Z movement, and gyroscopes for measuring the extent and rate of rotation in space (roll, pitch and yaw). Some devices (e.g. the iPhone) additionally incorporate a magnetometer to provide absolute angular measurements relative to the Earth's magnetic field. Newer MEMS-based inertial <b>measurement</b> <b>units</b> incorporate up to all nine axes of sensing in a single integrated circuit package, providing inexpensive and widely available motion sensing.|$|E

40|$|Abstract- Inertial <b>measurement</b> <b>unit</b> {{consists}} of gyroscopes and accelerometers, which {{are known as}} inertial sensors. These sensors are prone to various deterministic and random errors which need to be compensated. This work presents a calibration and stochastic modeling technique for six degree of freedom inertial <b>measurement</b> <b>unit</b> in order to remove these errors from inertial sensors. Calibration of inertial <b>measurement</b> <b>unit</b> is carried out to estimate the coefficients which transform the raw output of sensors into meaningful data. In this paper, allan variance technique is used to model and analyze various random errors present in inertial sensors. This paper covers the theoretical basis of calibration and allan variance along with implementation of these techniques to inertial sensors.

25|$|A serious {{difficulty}} arises if the variables are not {{measured in the}} same units. First consider measuring distance between a data point and the curve – what are the <b>measurement</b> <b>units</b> for this distance? If we consider measuring distance based on Pythagoras' Theorem then {{it is clear that}} we shall be adding quantities measured in different units, and so this leads to meaningless results. Secondly, if we rescale one of the variables e.g., measure in grams rather than kilograms, then we shall end up with different results (a different curve). To avoid this problem of incommensurability it is sometimes suggested that we convert to dimensionless variables—this may be called normalization or standardization. However there are various ways of doing this, and these lead to fitted models which are not equivalent to each other. One approach is to normalize by known (or estimated) measurement precision thereby minimizing the Mahalanobis distance from the points to the line, providing a maximum-likelihood solution; the unknown precisions could be found via analysis of variance.|$|E

500|$|Within {{the range}} of mass-classifiers, authors have {{proposed}} subdivisions based on {{the manner in which}} a mass-classifier organizes the noun into countable units. One of these is <b>measurement</b> <b>units</b> (also called [...] "standard measures"), which all languages must have in order to measure items; this category includes units such as kilometers, liters, or pounds (see list). Like other classifiers, these can also stand without a noun; thus, for example, (bàng, pound) may appear as both (sān [...] ròu, [...] "three [...] of meat") or just (sān , [...] "three [...] ", never *sān [...] ). Units of currency behave similarly: for example, 十 (shí , [...] "ten [...] "), which is short for (for example) 十人民币 (shí [...] rénmínbì, [...] "ten [...] of renminbi"). Other proposed types of mass-classifiers include [...] "collective" [...] mass-classifiers, such as (yì [...] rén, [...] "a [...] of people"), which group things less precisely; and [...] "container" [...] mass-classifiers which group things by containers they come in, as in (yì [...] zhōu, [...] "a [...] of porridge") or (yì [...] táng, [...] "a [...] of sugar").|$|E

40|$|AbstractA compact 3 D shape <b>measurement</b> <b>unit</b> {{that uses}} the light-source-stepping method (LSSM) is developed. The LSSM {{proposed}} by the authors is a phase-shifting fringe projection method for shape measurement. The authors also developed a linear LED device for high-speed shape measurement using the LSSM. A compact and high-speed 3 D shape <b>measurement</b> <b>unit</b> can be realized using a linear LED device. However, the LSSM is difficult to utilize because the phase-shifting amount is not uniform. The phase-shifting amount depends on {{the distance from the}} grating plate. It is therefore necessary to consider carefully the locations of the linear LED device and the grating plate. In this paper, the design method for a 3 D shape <b>measurement</b> <b>unit</b> {{that uses the}} LSSM is shown, and a prototype of a compact 3 D shape <b>measurement</b> <b>unit</b> with a linear LED device is developed...|$|R
