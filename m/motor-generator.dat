25|$|Because {{of their}} shorter {{wheelbase}} {{and the smaller}} <b>motor-generator</b> set designed for one trailer only, 36/42 stock units were kept for the Johnsonville line as much as possible. Similarly, the three-car sets of 1946 stock were kept for use on the Paekakariki, Melling and Upper Hutt services due to their greater passenger-carrying capacity and reduced brake capacity on steep lines.|$|E
25|$|The April 2006 {{incident}} {{had been}} {{the second time in}} eight months that the tram system lost power. On September 2, 2005, more than 80 people were trapped on the tram for over 90 minutes. After that incident, state inspectors cited the Roosevelt Island Tramway for not having an operational diesel backup, or <b>Motor-generator</b> system. The State Department of Labor said the system did not pass electrical inspection and could not run when the April 18 power outage took place.|$|E

25|$|In a WRIM, {{the rotor}} winding {{is made of}} many turns of {{insulated}} wire and is connected to slip rings on the motor shaft. An external resistor or other control devices can be connected in the rotor circuit. Resistors allow control of the motor speed, although significant power is dissipated in the external resistance. A converter can be fed from the rotor circuit and return the slip-frequency power {{that would otherwise be}} wasted back into the power system through an inverter or separate <b>motor-generator.</b>|$|E
25|$|The Prius Plug-in {{has three}} drive modes, all-electric (EV), and two hybrid modes: Eco and Power. The EV mode is user-selectable and when running in this mode the hybrid {{engine control unit}} (ECU) {{operates}} the vehicle using only the larger <b>motor-generator</b> (MG2) if pre-determined parameters are satisfied, such as sufficient {{battery state of charge}} (SOC) and vehicle speed within EV mode range. The Eco mode is designed to maximize fuel savings for any driving conditions, and modifies or smoothes out the electronic throttle control program to reduce throttle response, reducing the throttle opening to a maximum of 11.6%, and also modifies the operation of the air conditioning system. As an additional benefit, the Eco mode improves performance in low-traction conditions because the reduced output helps to minimize wheel skidding such as those caused by ice and snow. Power mode increases throttle response in the middle range more than normal.|$|E
500|$|Another {{change was}} due to {{every part of the}} {{equipment}} having different power requirements. The tubes for the transmitter used 6V to heat their filaments, but 4V was needed for the receiver tubes and 2V for the filament of the CRT. The CRT also [...] needed 800V for its electron gun, but the transmitter tubes 1000V for their modulators (drivers). At first, the team used <b>motor-generator</b> sets placed in the Anson and Battle fuselages, or batteries connected in various ways as in the earliest sets in the Heyfords. Bowen decided the solution was to build a power supply that would produce all of these DC voltages from a single 240V 50Hz supply using transformers and rectifiers. This would allow them to power the radar systems using mains power while the aircraft were on the ground.|$|E

50|$|The {{inverters}} replaced two ca. 1928 Westinghouse Electric motor generators {{that were}} each rated at 21.4 MVA. The capability also formerly existed to supply power from PECO Energy's Somerset Substation, which had three <b>motor-generators</b> normally used {{to supply the}} Pennsylvania Railroad's electrification system. This capability has been removed, as have the Somerset <b>motor-generators.</b> The ex-Reading system now operates completely independently from Amtrak's power system.|$|R

2500|$|HVDC {{converters}} {{can take}} several different forms. Early HVDC systems, built until the 1930s, were effectively rotary converters and used electromechanical conversion with <b>motor-generator</b> sets connected in {{series on the}} DC side and in parallel on the AC side. [...] However, all HVDC systems built since the 1940s have used electronic (static) converters.|$|E
2500|$|Some DC {{locomotives}} used <b>motor-generator</b> sets as [...] "stepdown transformers" [...] {{to produce}} more convenient voltages for auxiliary loads such as lighting, fans and compressors but they are inefficient, noisy and unreliable. Solid-state converters have replaced them. State-of-the-art locomotives (diesel-electric as well as electric) have even replaced the traditional universal-type traction motor with a three-phase AC induction motor driven by a special-purpose AC inverter, a variable frequency drive.|$|E
50|$|Three {{types of}} {{equipment}} {{are currently in}} operation: hydroelectric generators, <b>motor-generators</b> (sometimes called rotary frequency converters), and static frequency converters.|$|R
25|$|They must be {{converted}} from utility power by <b>motor-generators</b> or static inverters at the feeding substations or generated at dedicated traction powerstations.|$|R
50|$|Hybrid gasoline/electric {{vehicles}} may {{be considered}} to have partial inboard braking, because the <b>motor-generator(s)</b> used for the regenerative part of the braking are usually mounted inboard.|$|R
2500|$|As {{early as}} the 1880s, the {{advantages}} of DC long-distance transmission were starting to become evident and several commercial power transmission systems were put into operation. The most successful of these used the system invented by René Thury and {{were based on the}} principle of connecting several <b>motor-generator</b> sets in series on the DC side. [...] The best-known example was the 200km, Lyon–Moutiers DC transmission scheme in France, which operated commercially from 1906 to 1936 transmitting power from the Moutiers hydroelectric plant to the city of Lyon.|$|E
2500|$|The second {{generation}} Toyota Prius {{makes use of}} a 201.6-volt NiMH battery composed of 28 modules, where each module is made of six individual 1.2-volt, 6.5Ah Prismatic NiMH cells. The 7.2-volt modules each contain a charge controller and a relay. The 28 modules are connected in series to produce a total energy storage capacity of 1.310kWh (via 201.6-volts × 6.5Ah). The battery control computers keep the state of charge (SOC) between approximately 40 and 80percent (shallow cycling), where the average SOC hovers around 60percent, allowing about 400Wh of useful energy storage to capture energy from regenerative braking and to release {{it back into the}} hybrid drive-train through <b>Motor-generator</b> 1 and <b>Motor-generator</b> 2 in the power split device. [...] The shallow cycling enables the hybrid battery to last tens of thousands of cycles, which translates into decades of use and in many case more than [...] of operation. The computer controlled charging and discharging of the battery enhances its cycle life, calendar life, and thermal control performance. Passive battery cooling and heating is accomplished through the metal case of the battery assembly pack, while a forced air cooling system with a blower motor and ducting system enables active cooling of the HV battery.|$|E
2500|$|A <b>motor-generator</b> set, or {{the similar}} rotary converter, is not {{strictly}} a rectifier {{as it does}} not actually rectify current, but rather generates DC from an AC source. In an [...] "M-G set", the shaft of an AC motor is mechanically coupled {{to that of a}} DC generator. The DC generator produces multiphase alternating currents in its armature windings, which a commutator on the armature shaft converts into a direct current output; or a homopolar generator produces a direct current without the need for a commutator. M-G sets are useful for producing DC for railway traction motors, industrial motors and other high-current applications, and were common in many high-power D.C. uses (for example, carbon-arc lamp projectors for outdoor theaters) before high-power semiconductors became widely available.|$|E

50|$|In Norway {{nearly all}} railway {{substations}} uses <b>motor-generators</b> which converts three phase AC from public grid into single phase AC. Most of these device are mounted on rail-cars for quick replacement. Some substations are in blind-ending tunnels.|$|R
50|$|In 1902, two 1,500-kW Parsons {{steam turbine}} driven turbo-alternators {{were added to}} the initial {{equipment}} at the station. At the time, these were the largest three-phase steam turbine driven alternators in the world, as well as being the first of the barrel type rotary design. Results gained from the turbines influenced the Cunard Steamship Company to install steam turbines on the Mauretania. The turbines drove 6,000 V three-phase alternators, supplying current to <b>motor-generators</b> and transformers in the substations attached to the distribution network. The <b>motor-generators</b> in the substations provided DC from the supplied AC and the transformers stepped-down the 6,000 V supply to 200 V for lighting use and 400 V for industrial use.|$|R
2500|$|Modern HEVs {{make use}} of efficiency-improving {{technologies}} such as regenerative brakes which convert the vehicle's kinetic energy to electric energy to charge the battery. Some varieties of HEV use their internal combustion engine to generate electricity by spinning an electrical generator to either recharge their batteries or to directly power the electric drive motors; this combination {{is known as a}} <b>motor–generator.</b> Many HEVs reduce idle emissions by shutting down the ICE at idle and restarting it when needed; this is known as a start-stop system. A hybrid-electric produces less emissions from its ICE than a comparably sized gasoline car, since an HEV's gasoline engine is usually smaller than a comparably sized, pure gasoline-burning, vehicle and if not used to directly drive the car, can be geared to run at maximum efficiency, further improving fuel economy. (Natural gas and propane fuels produce fewer emissions.) ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{radio room}} was {{located on the}} Boat Deck, in the officers' quarters. A soundproofed [...] "Silent Room", next to the {{operating}} room, housed loud equipment, including the transmitter and a <b>motor-generator</b> used for producing alternating currents. The operators' living quarters were adjacent to the working office. The ship was equipped with a 'state of the art' 5kilowatt rotary spark-gap transmitter, operating under the radio callsign MGY, and communication was conducted in Morse code. This transmitter {{was one of the}} first Marconi installations to use a rotary spark gap, which gave Titanic a distinctive musical tone that could be readily distinguished from other signals. The transmitter was one of the most powerful in the world, and guaranteed to broadcast over a radius of [...] An elevated T-antenna that spanned the length of the ship was used for transmitting and receiving. The normal operating frequency was 500kHz (600 m wavelength), however the equipment could also operate on the [...] "short" [...] wavelength of 1000kHz (300 m wavelength) that was employed by smaller vessels with shorter antennas.|$|E
50|$|In {{hybrid vehicle}} applications, wear on braking systems is greatly reduced by energy {{recovering}} <b>motor-generators</b> (see regenerative braking), so some hybrid vehicles {{such as the}} GMC Yukon Hybrid and Toyota Prius (except the third generation) use drum brakes at the rear wheels.|$|R
