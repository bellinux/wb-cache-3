This paper introduces this current grain price support policy and assesses {{the effect of this}} policy on regulating China domestic grain prices employing the grey relational analysis. The results suggest that price support policy plays a most important role in determining grain market prices relative to other factors including production cost, international price and production, implying that the policy impacts the grain market prices effectively and the expected goals of this policy have been achieved. Therefore, in controlling grain market prices, employing grain <b>minimum</b> <b>purchasing</b> <b>price</b> policy is efficient, and continuing efforts should be made to design appropriate minimum purchasing prices for grains...|$|E

She was built for the Ministry of Transport and initially managed by P Hendersonn & Co, and then by Alfred Holt & Co. In April 1947, Empire Athelstan was put up for sale by tender, at a <b>minimum</b> <b>purchase</b> <b>price</b> of £340,000, with delivery after 31 May and before 31 August 1947.|$|R

UTZ Certified does not interfere in price negotiations. In contrast to Fair Trade, no <b>minimum</b> <b>purchase</b> <b>price</b> is set.

40|$|The {{standard}} Tobit {{maximum likelihood}} estimator under zero censoring threshold produces inconsistent parameter estimates, when the constant censoring threshold γ is non-zero and unknown. Unfortunately, {{the recording of}} a zero rather than the actual censoring threshold value is typical of economic data. Non-trivial <b>minimum</b> <b>purchase</b> <b>prices</b> for most goods, fixed cost for doing business or trading, social customs such as those involving charitable donations, and informal administrative recording practices represent common examples of non-zero constant censoring threshold where the constant threshold is not readily available to the econometrician. Monte Carlo results show that this bias can be extremely large in practice. A new estimator is proposed to estimate the unknown censoring threshold. It is shown that the estimator is superconsistent and follows an exponential distribution in large samples. Due to the superconsistency, the asymptotic distribution of the maximum likelihood estimator of other parameters is not affected by the estimation uncertainty of the censoring threshold.

In a treaty made on September 23, 1836, {{the federal government}} agreed to purchase forty-two sections of their Indiana land for $33,600 (or $1.25 per acre, the <b>minimum</b> <b>purchase</b> <b>price</b> the government could receive {{from the sale of}} public lands). A treaty made with the Potawatomi on February 11, 1837, provided for further cessions of Indiana land in exchange for a parcel of reservation land for tribal members on the Osage River, southwest of the Missouri River in present-day Kansas, and other guarantees. Another small group of Potawatomi from Indiana removed in 1850. Those who had been forcefully removed were initially relocated to reservation land in eastern Kansas, but moved to another reservation in the Kansas River valley after 1846. Not all the Potawatomi from Indiana removed to Kansas. A small group joined an estimated 2,500 Potawatomi in Canada.|$|R
500|$|In the US, {{wind power}} {{receives}} a production tax credit (PTC) of 1.5¢/kWh in 1993 dollars for each kW·h produced, {{for the first}} ten years; at 2.2 cents per kW·h in 2012, the credit was renewed on 2 January 2012, to include construction begun in 2013. A 30% tax credit can be applied instead of receiving the PTC. Another tax benefit is accelerated depreciation. Many American states also provide incentives, such as exemption from property tax, mandated purchases, and additional markets for [...] "green credits". The Energy Improvement and Extension Act of 2008 contains extensions of credits for wind, including microturbines. Countries such as Canada and Germany also provide incentives for wind turbine construction, such as tax credits or <b>minimum</b> <b>purchase</b> <b>prices</b> for wind generation, with assured grid access (sometimes referred to as feed-in tariffs). These feed-in tariffs are typically set well above average electric power prices. In December 2013 U.S. Senator Lamar Alexander and other Republican senators argued that the [...] "wind energy production tax credit {{should be allowed to}} expire at the end of 2013" [...] and it expired 1 January 2014 for new installations.|$|R
40|$|The {{last decade}} has {{witnessed}} a strong growth in foreign investments in residential properties (FIRP) in Malaysia. However, FIRP is not equally distributed among Malaysian states. Hence, this warrants {{an investigation into}} why some states have larger FIRP than others. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to investigate the pattern and determinants of FIRP in Malaysian states. FIRP in Malaysia has been agglomerated in the major and industrialized states (such as Kuala Lumpur, Selangor, Pulau Pinang and Johor). Using a panel of 14 Malaysian states over a period of 7 years (2004 - 2010) and applying the system Generalized Method of Moments (GMM) approach, the statistical results show that tourism agglomeration (learning about the host location), well-being of the local people, foreign investments in other sectors, religious diversity and <b>minimum</b> property <b>purchase</b> <b>price</b> are important determinants of FIRP...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACTDue to the {{proliferation}} of products on the shelves in the stores, many companies started to use brands to differentiate their offer from competitors. However, many managers create an improper positioning of their brands and, thus, reduce {{the value of their}} products, rather than expand it. In order to improve the understanding about the type of brand, this study aimed to analyze the consumer preference in relation to facial anti-aging cosmetics attributes that brands can influence, such as: brand type, <b>price,</b> perceived quality, <b>minimum</b> <b>purchase</b> quantity and status. To achieve this scope, a survey was carried, during the year of 2009, concerning the preferences of 100 women about anti-aging cosmetics. The data analysis was executed using conjoint analysis. It was discovered that, to the analyzed sample, the determinative attributes to choose an anti-aging facial cosmetic, arranged in ascending order, are: <b>minimum</b> <b>purchase</b> quantity, status, <b>price,</b> brand type and quality. And, despite a few exceptions, it was obtained that social brand is preferred by the respondents. Thus, since the quality is the most important attribute for the interviewees, social brands that focus on the quality of their products and on how they are made can be great sources of value for the companies...|$|R

40|$|I {{examine the}} {{negotiation}} of accounting rules in the <b>purchase</b> <b>price</b> adjustment clause of corporate acquisition agreements. <b>Purchase</b> <b>price</b> adjustments make the deal value contingent on the target's closing working capital or net worth. Some <b>purchase</b> <b>price</b> adjustments use "rigid" accounting and specify which measurement rules {{will be used to}} prepare the closing-date balance sheet. Many more use "flexible" accounting and require only GAAP compliance. I provide evidence that hidden action and adverse selection problems determine whether the buyer and seller use rigid or flexible accounting. I also provide evidence that this choice is associated with other features of the contract related to <b>purchase</b> <b>price</b> adjustment flexibility and to the prospect of hold-up. Estimates of the effect of rigid accounting on finalized <b>purchase</b> <b>price</b> adjustments are consistent with implications of the adverse selection and hold-up problems. by Derek Christopher Johnson.
