40|$|Water uptake in {{fractured}} brick samples {{is monitored}} with X-ray radiography. This technique can measure both the <b>moisture</b> profiles <b>in</b> the matrix and {{the height of}} the waterfront in the fracture during the experiment. It was found that the waterfront in the fracture could quickly reach {{the opposite side of the}} specimen, resulting in an extra water source for the surrounding matrix over the total height of the sample. For smaller fracture apertures, however, the waterfront in the fracture stagnates and <b>moisture</b> profiles <b>in</b> the matrix run ahead of the waterfront in the fracture. To simulate the experiments, a numerical model for unsaturated <b>moisture</b> transport <b>in</b> fractured porous media is developed. The model combines a discrete fracture model for <b>moisture</b> flow <b>in</b> a variable aperture fracture with a finite element model for unsaturated flow in the porous matrix. To achieve a stable numerical solution, movable nodes, following the <b>moisture</b> front <b>in</b> the fracture, are introduced on the boundary of the finite element mesh. The numerical results of height of rise in the fracture as well as of <b>moisture</b> profiles <b>in</b> the matrix show to be in good agreement with the measurements. The paper ends with a parameter analysis, investigating the effects of fracture aperture and matrix properties on the unsaturated <b>moisture</b> flow <b>in</b> fractured porous media.

5|$|Actinium reacts rapidly {{with oxygen}} and <b>moisture</b> <b>in</b> air forming a white coating of {{actinium}} oxide that impedes further oxidation. As with most lanthanides and actinides, actinium {{exists in the}} oxidation state +3, and the Ac3+ ions are colorless in solutions. The oxidation state +3 originates from the 6d17s2 electronic configuration of actinium, with three valence electrons that are easily donated to give the stable closed-shell structure of the noble gas radon. The rare oxidation state +2 is only known for actinium dihydride (AcH2); even this may in reality be an electride compound like its lighter congener LaH2.|$|E
5|$|B.telmatiaea {{is rarely}} cultivated. It grows fairly quickly, but tends to become untidy as it ages.

George recommends a sunny position in poorly drained soil, preferably with <b>moisture</b> <b>in</b> winter. Seeds do not require any treatment, and take around 14 days to germinate.|$|E

5|$|During the day, tammars {{stay close}} to scrub for shade and move out to more open {{grassland}} by nightfall. Like all macropods, the tammar is herbivorous. They are known to both graze and browse, but the latter is less effective, as they commonly drop leaves when chewing on them. When eating large leaves, tammars handle them with their forelimbs. This species spends more time chewing its food than other similar sized macropods, which likely aids digestion. Tammars commonly feed on acacia seeds. Other species consumed include heart-leaved poison (Gastrolobium bilobum), small-flowered wallaby grass (Austrodanthonia setacea), and marri (Corymbia calophylla). Tammars survive on several islands that have no fresh water, subsisting on seawater and the <b>moisture</b> <b>in</b> plants.|$|E
5|$|Engine {{starting}} {{was achieved}} {{by a combination of}} compressed air and a hand-turned magneto; however, starting problems were encountered during pre-race testing at Calshot due to <b>moisture</b> <b>in</b> the air and water contamination of the fuel.

As expected, minor engine failures continued to be experienced, and to counter this engines and parts were transported at high speed between Derby and Calshot using an adapted Rolls-Royce Phantom I motor car.

5|$|Inside a cold cyclone, 500hPa {{temperatures}} {{can fall}} {{as low as}} , which can initiate convection even in the driest atmospheres. This also explains why <b>moisture</b> <b>in</b> the mid-levels of the troposphere, roughly at the 500hPa level, is normally a requirement for development. However, when dry air is found at the same height, temperatures at 500hPa need to be even colder as dry atmospheres require a greater lapse rate for instability than moist atmospheres. At heights near the tropopause, the 30-year average temperature (as measured in the period encompassing 1961 through 1990) was −77°C (−132°F). A recent example of a tropical cyclone that maintained itself over cooler waters was Epsilon of the 2005 Atlantic hurricane season.|$|E

5|$|Thick haze {{and smoke}} {{originating}} from burning biomass in northwestern India {{and air pollution}} from large industrial cities in northern India often concentrate over the Ganges Basin. Prevailing westerlies carry aerosols along the southern margins of the sheer-faced Tibetan Plateau towards eastern India and the Bay of Bengal. Dust and black carbon, which are blown towards higher altitudes by winds at the southern margins of the Himalayas, can absorb shortwave radiation and heat the air over the Tibetan Plateau. The net atmospheric heating due to aerosol absorption causes the air to warm and convect upwards, increasing the concentration of <b>moisture</b> <b>in</b> the mid-troposphere and providing positive feedback that stimulates further heating of aerosols.|$|E
