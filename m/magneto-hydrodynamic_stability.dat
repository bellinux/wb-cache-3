40|$|A {{high density}} {{internal}} diffusion barrier has been {{produced in the}} intrinsic helical divertor configuration in LHD by optimizing the pellet fueling scenario and magnetic configuration. The internal diffusion barriereasily appears in the outer shifted magnetic configuration in which <b>magneto-hydrodynamic</b> <b>stability</b> properties {{are considered to be}} favorable. The attainable central plasma density becomes higher as the magnetic axis shifts outward and the central density exceed 5 × 10 ^ 20 m- 3. Central pressure exceeds 130 kPa and, therefore, very large Shafranov shift is observed, even at high magnetic field (Bt > 2. 54 T) ...|$|E
40|$|Tokamak {{research}} shows that magnetic fusion energy deserves serious consideration as a viable baseline electric power source for the future. The challenge remaining is to optimize the concept and pursue {{greater understanding of the}} new advanced-tokamak (AT) regimes to increase the economic and environmental attractiveness of both tokamaks and magnetic fusion energy more generally. The advanced tokamak mission is to further the knowledge and performance of advanced tokamak plasmas—as an attractive power plant, as a vehicle for the demonstration and exploration of burning plasmas, and for the broader contribution to fusion energy science and technology. In pursuit of this broader objective, tokamak research is the most capable vehicle available today for advancing magnetic fusion science. The tokamak’s ability to produce high temperature plasmas, its extensive diagnostics instrumentation, and its coupling to maturing simulation capabilities are accelerating the deepening foundation of high temperature plasma physics. Research in the 2000 decade will emphasize understanding and optimization through experiment-theory interaction across a wide spectrum of fusion plasma physics: transport processes, <b>magneto-hydrodynamic</b> <b>stability</b> and control, wave-particle interaction...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Superthermal E ×B {{rotation}} {{can provide}} magne-tohydrodynamic stability and enhanced confinement to axisym-metric mirrors. However, the rotation speed {{has been limited}} by phenomena at end electrodes. A new prediction is that rotation might instead be produced using a magnetic ripple and alpha particle kinetic energy, in {{an extension of the}} alpha channeling concept. The interaction of alpha particles with the ripple results in visually interesting and practically useful orbits. Index Terms—Magnetic confinement, plasma devices, plasma simulation, plasma waves. AXISYMMETRIC mirrors have many potential advantagesas fusion reactors including high beta, steady-state op-eration, and a simple coil configuration [1]. The major issues that must be overcome by axisymmetric mirrors are <b>magneto-hydrodynamic</b> (MHD) <b>stability</b> and excessive parallel energy loss. Both of these may be addressed by inducing superthermal E ×B rotation, which provides MHD stability through veloc-ity shear and increases axial confinement by the centrifugal force [2]–[4]. In past experiments, the rotation has been pro-duced by electrodes in the mirror throat, and these electrodes limited the rotation speed to the Alfven critical ionization velocity (CIV) [2], [5], [6]. However, rotation might best be produced by waves rather than electrodes, allowing the CIV limit to be overcome [7]. The method of driving rotation with waves is an extension of the alpha channeling effect in tokamaks [8]. In alpha channel-ing, waves are injected which create a diffusion path connecting the hot core of the plasma to the cold edge. That is, there is coupled diffusion in energy and position. As alpha particles interact with the wave, they diffuse radially and may eventually exit at the outer edge. Because the radial diffusion is related to diffusion in energy by the wave properties, alpha particles can be made to exit at low energy, transferring their energy to the wave. The wave energy can then be used for heating ions or other purposes [9]...|$|R
