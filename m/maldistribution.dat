The {{performance}} of a packed-bed reactor typically used in Gas-to-Liquid (GTL) or Biomass-to-Liquid (BTL) technologies in producing liquid fuels was affected by unfavorable high pressure drop, flow and temperature <b>maldistributions</b> which in turn could cause severe catalyst deactivation, and result in inefficient reaction etc. A certain types of fluid mixers such as Kenics TM or Mixing & Stirring type static mixers had been suggested to improve the {{performance of}} this type of reactor.

In this report, an analysis is developed to predict the flow-induced forced response of an aerodynamically detuned rotor operating in a supersonic flow with a subsonic axial component. The aerodynamic detuning is achieved by alternating the circumferential spacing of adjacent rotor blades. The total unsteady aerodynamic loading acting on the blading, {{as a result of}} the convection of the transverse gust past the airfoil cascade and the resulting motion of the cascade, is developed in terms of influence coefficients. This analysis is used to investigate the effect of aerodynamic detuning on the forced response of a 12 -blade rotor, with Verdon's Cascade B flow geometry as a uniformly spaced baseline configuration. The results of this study indicate that, for forward traveling wave gust excitations, aerodynamic detuning is very beneficial, resulting in significantly decreased maximum-amplitude blade responses for many interblade phase angles...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of this investigation is to evaluate the ability of analytical and computational models to describe the momentum and heat transfer between the gas and particles in a falling-bed heat exchanger. Experimental data are presented for a test falling-bed heat exchanger. Measured temperatures, pressures, and overall heat transfer rates are compared to predicted values from analytical and computational models, and the capabilities and deficiencies of these modeling methods are discussed. In addition, {{the effect of the}} addition of a particle distributor on the performance of the falling-bed heat exchanger is measured. ^ In the falling-bed heat exchanger, solid particles fall through a vertical column against a counterflowing gas stream flowing upward with a velocity less than the terminal velocity of the particle. Heat is exchanged between the falling particles and rising gas. This arrangement has been proposed for heat recovery and regeneration in power plants and other process applications. ^ The ability to model and predict the heat transfer rate between the gas and particles is critical to the design of the falling-bed heat exchanger. The heat transfer between the gas and solid particles in these devices has typically been modeled by assuming steady-state and ideal, uniform, one-dimensional flow of the continuous fluid and the particle or droplets. This model, termed the uniform mixing model in this study, has been used in many instances to estimate the effective heat transfer coefficient and Nusselt number of the falling droplets and particles as a function of effective Reynolds number from experimental data. ^ The addition of a particle distributor has been shown to increase the heat transfer effectiveness of the falling-bed heat exchanger in experiments. It has been determined that the uniform mixing model generally does not provide an accurate representation of the falling-bed heat exchanger, as it cannot account for gas and particle <b>maldistributions</b> such as those created by a particular particle distributor design. Computational fluid dynamics, which can permit the modeling of these spatial <b>maldistributions,</b> has been used to model the falling-bed heat exchanger. The predictions of the overall heat transfer rate from computational fluid dynamics are in better agreement with the measured values. However, discrepancies between the predicted and measured pressures and local temperatures indicate that the modeling of the turbulent mixing of momentum and energy is inadequate. ...|$|R

40|$|Parallel channel heat {{transfer}} system is an attractive means to enhance {{heat transfer}} by increasing the total surface area in the heat exchanger. Uniform distribution of flow in the channels is an important operation attribute {{in order to avoid}} channel dryout and the subsequent hot spots and possible device failure. For the system operating in the single-phase regime, uniform flow distribution is a stable equilibrium. However, in the two-phase boiling regime, stable equilibrium bifurcates – the uniform distribution becomes unstable, and new stable or unstable non-uniform distributions, or <b>maldistributions,</b> equilibria emerge. As a result, parallel channel heat exchangers typically operate in the single phase regime to avoid such “maldistribution instability. ” This paper presents a stability analysis and active flow and temperature control of a parallel channel evaporator in a pumped two-phase boiling heat transfer loop. We show that for identical channels, the system is uncontrollable with the pump alone and unobservable from the overall flow rate measurement. A conventional solution involves introducing additional valve-induced pressure drop, but the drawback is a resulting higher pumping power. We present a new, somewhat surprising, result that if the channel characteristics are all distinct, the system actually becomes controllable fro...|$|R

In addition, the effect of fibre spacing and bundle size on the aeration rate of various modules was evaluated experimentally. Previous studies typically base performance evaluations on the liquid inlet velocity or an average velocity, an approach which neglects the effect of geometric features within modules. The use of validated CFD simulations provides more detailed information for performance assessment.

40|$|Progressivism {{is in part}} a {{particular}} moral and political response to the sadness of lesser lives, lives unnecessarily diminished by economic, psychic and physical insecurity {{in the midst of}} a society or world that offers plenty. This insecurity is unjust and should end; the suffering should be alleviated, and those lives should be enriched. To do so must be one of the goals of a morally just or justifiable state. Not all suffering and not all lesser lives, of course, give rise to such a response. The suffering attendant to accident, disease, war and happenstance is neither entirely chargeable to our societal account, nor is it within our control. A 2 ̆ 2 lesser life 2 ̆ 2 marred by the early loss of a parent, a parent 2 ̆ 7 s mourning occasioned by the accidental death of a child, or an adult 2 ̆ 7 s ongoing trauma set off by a childhood disease, although cosmically unjust, is neither unjust in the ordinary sense, nor is it easily ameliorated through politics. In contrast, the suffering attendant to poverty or stunted opportunities for growth, the suffering attendant to the absence of supportive communities, or the suffering attendant to the desperate attempt to nurture children while unsure of one 2 ̆ 7 s own physical or economic safety is largely chargeable to our moral account and may be ameliorated through politics [...] at least in a social world like our own, marked by abundant natural resources, vast economic opportunity, thriving neighborhoods, and competent police and security forces. The question I want to raise first is whether it is possible to read the Constitution, or any part of it, as a part of this progressive moral imperative? Does the Constitution, as well as political and moral conscience, require of us (2 ̆ 2 us, 2 ̆ 2 meaning all citizens, or the polity, or people who vote, or those who engage in political discourse or have political influence, or anyone who pledges to uphold the Constitution) a collective response to the needless suffering attendant to private <b>maldistributions</b> of power, wealth, or privilege? It should already be clear that what Steve Shiffrin helpfully calls the 2 ̆ 2 positive Constitution, 2 ̆ 22 ̆ 7 and what I have elsewhere called the 2 ̆ 2 adjudicated Constitution 2 ̆ 2 is not a part of any such moral imperative, and indeed, mutes its force. I have described the suffering that triggers the distinctive progressive imperative as caused by private power combined with state or collective neglect, and the positive Constitution, as it has been authoritatively interpreted for the last one hundred years, at best simply does not address the suffering attendant to private action and state neglect: neither private action nor state inaction, we have all been taught to say, comes within the ambit of constitutional concern. Indeed, quite the contrary. At various times in our all too familiar constitutional history, and through the construction of various individual 2 ̆ 2 rights, 2 ̆ 2 the Constitution, far from being concerned with such suffering, has been authoritatively interpreted in such a way as to quite aggressively protect the conditions which give rise to such suffering against ordinary forms of political intervention. That our positive constitution is so clearly at cross purposes with the moral imperative that animates progressive politics in this country does indeed imply that that body of law does actual harm to this country 2 ̆ 7 s disenfranchised. That it has not been the object of sustained critique from the progressive left is indicative of the indirect harm it has done to our moral and intellectual culture. Nevertheless, I want to argue against the positive, posited, adjudicated Constitution, and to suggest instead that the constitutional story, properly understood, is a part of progressivism 2 ̆ 7 s core moral and political imperative: to wield collective action toward the end of ameliorating the suffering that is consequent to private <b>maldistributions</b> of wealth and security. Thus, what I want to suggest is that the Constitution and our constitutional history should be read as a part of the progressive moral response to such suffering, that it is indeed unjust and the progressive political response to it as well is unjust, and that the state or some other form of collective action representing the will and sentiment of the people must be aimed at eradicating it. Unwarranted private suffering brought on by private <b>maldistributions</b> of wealth or power, in other words, is of constitutional as well as moral significance, and our collective indifference to it is unconstitutional and shameful. That it is unconstitutional is a part of what makes it shameful, and the shame is what makes it unconstitutional...|$|R

The microchannel heat sinks with various inlet/outlet arrangements are investigated in this study. All of the geometric dimensions of these heat sinks are the same except the inlet/outlet locations.

The shortage is expected to worsen, unless a dramatic increase occurs in the generation of additional primary care clinicians. Geographical <b>maldistributions</b> of PCP also exist. Whereas 20 % of the US population resides in rural areas, only 10 % of physicians practice in these areas. This study explores factors that influence medical students’ decisions to select primary care residency training programs, and to practice in rural areas. Specifically, the levels of debt among 1391 graduates from University of Louisville School of Medicine (ULSOM) during 2001 - 2010 were examined in association with their selection of categories of residency training programs. Similarly, levels of debt among 1180 ULSOM graduates during 2001 - 2008 were examined in association with rural practice locations. Statistical methods included evaluations of receiver-operating curves (ROC) and multiple logistic regression analyses. The ROC analyses showed no association was present for any level of debt with either selection of primary care residency programs or rural practice sites. Multiple logistic regression analyses showed a statistically significant, positive association was present between the two extreme quintiles of medical students’ debt, whereby medical students in the lower quintile of debt were more likely select a primary care residency, compared to those students within the highest quintile. No statistically significant association was found for students’ debt with rural practice location. Multiple policy options to increase the primary care workforce were examined, including raising physicians’ reimbursements, shortening time for medical training, and altering how medical schools finance medical education.

40|$|The modern semi-wet Lepol {{process of}} Portland Cement {{manufacture}} {{relies on a}} filter pressed, 13 - 15 % moisture, mix of clay/shale plus chalk/limestone, being first dried and then partially calcined on a travelling grate. The cement clinkering reaction then {{takes place in a}} shortened version of a conventional rotary kiln. A significant improvement in both process efficiency and clinker output is envisaged if a larger proportion of the calcination reaction could be removed from the kiln and transferred to the grate section. This process alteration, of course, needs extra heat and this can be supplied by some form of fuel injection to the grate chamber. Such a process modification is known as pre-calcining. The research described in this thesis involves the establishment of the fundamental aerodynamic mixing patterns which occur in real Lepol kilns, through the aid of a 1 : 24 th scale Perspex replica, backed-up by "cold" trials on a working prototype. These results were then used to develop a compatible coal fired burner system, which would deliver approximately 30 % of the total process heat requirement, direct to the grate calcination chamber. The flow regimes, exhibited in the model by polystyrene beads, suggested that approximately 20 % of Lepol grate area was not being utilised for heat transfer. Areas of slow moving gases were observed, their position coinciding with areas of alkali dust build up in the real kiln. These aerodynamic flow <b>maldistributions</b> were, effectively, cured by the installation of under grate baffles in the kiln model. The modification of the Lepol grate system to accommodate auxiliary pre-calcination firing proved to be a far more intractable problem. The high momentum flows required to ensure adequate burn out for conventional coal burners only succeeded in exasperating the existing aerodynamic problems. Oil or gas burners would have produced better results but would have been quite uneconomic, excepting only that very cheap waste fuels might have tipped the balance. The ultimate solution to the problem proved to be a vortex combustion chamber, fitted over the grate, as a source of clean, low momentum hot gases...|$|R
40|$|Background: Health {{workforce}} governance {{is increasingly}} {{recognized as a}} burning policy issue and focused on workforce shortages. Yet the most pressing problem is to solve <b>maldistributions</b> through governance and integration. Poor management of health 242 European Journal of Public Health, Vol. 24, Supplement 2, 2014 human resources is relevant on all levels and areas of governance. Including, for instance, regional and international imbalances in the health workforce reinforced by austerity agendas, inefficient distribution of skills and tasks within and between professions, and lack of integration of women doctors in leadership positions and some specialties. One key challenge of health workforce governance is integration. Efforts are currently on European data sources and harmonizing licencing models. But strong national interests and institutional arrangements, as well as professional interests and social inequalities, are also challenging integration. In this respect, Europe {{is not only a}} problem case, but also a ‘natural laboratory’ to explore different routes for integration and coordination of decentralized policy and planning systems. Objectives: The objective of this workshop is to bring together scholars from different European countries and leading institutions to achieve three goals. First, to provide a platform for knowledge exchange and exploration of both best-practice examples. Second, to foster the development of a trans-European approach that is sensitive to local (national and regional) conditions. And third, to {{contribute to the development of}} political-practical solutions for sustainable health human resources policy by a fresh academic debate and methodology. The presentations aligned for this workshop address policy, management and planning of health human resources, taking into account different countries, dimensions, levels and areas of change in the demand and the supply of the health professional workforce. Results: The planned workshop presentations comply with the need for integrative theoretical and methodological approaches, and empirical research, to better understand the challenges of a highly diverse European landscape and integration. While integration is the ‘core’ of this workshop, it is viewed through different ‘lenses’. This includes the demand for efficient and reliable workforce planning, inter- and intra-professional collaboration, ethical and sustainable migration policy and management, and gender-sensitive organisational work and career conditions. Conclusion: This workshop and its presentations demonstrate the relevance of integration of health resource resources governance in their respective areas. The workshop aims to go beyond exploring the intersecting areas of health human resources development and integration, thereby contributing to map the ‘priority areas’ for health human resources policy in Europe. Key messages Integration is key for sustainable health workforce governance. An integrated perspective on health workforce governance sets the priority areas for health human resources policy in Europe...|$|R

40|$|Conventional {{combustion}} control systems for multiburner installations which rely on monitoring the average C 02 and/or 02 {{content of the}} gases {{have a number of}} inherent limitations on their ability to maintain efficient plant operation. Air infiltration'into the flue or sampling lines has the same effect as an instrumental error in causing the control system to adjust the stoichiometry to an incorrect level. Even' when the overall stoichiometry of the furnace is correctly and accurately controlled it is still extremely difficult to ensure that no individual burners are operating inefficiently due to local <b>maldistributions</b> of air or fuel, or to poor nozzle spray characteristics. The potential for fuel savings and for'improved limitation of pollutant emissions has provided strong incentive for the development of individual burner fuel/air ratio control systems which would eliminate the shortcomings associated with the global control method. The present report first reviews past attempts to identify some unique property of an individual flame which can be reliably interpreted as an indicator of the flame behavior over a wide range of operating conditions [...] Information potentially usable in this manner could be contained in the acoustic characteristics of the flame, in the local distribution of key chemical species, or in the electromagnetic radiation or absorption behavior of regions of the flame. For many reasons the previous studies have tended to concentrate on the optical portion of the electromagnetic spectrum, with particular emphasis on emission from flames over much of the ultraviolet (u. v.), visible and infrared (i. r.) wavelength regions. A brief review is given of the pioneering work of Penzias and his associates, and of the later work carried out at Sheffield University by Smith which {{led to the development of}} the LandTM control system. All of these studies dealt with the infrared emission from flames, wilth particular emphasis on the CO 2 barnd at 4. 3 pm, and on the H 0 /CO 2 binds near 2. 8 m. The report then addresses the experimental work carried out at M. I. T under the sponsorship of five utility companies supporting the M. I. T. Energy Laboratory Electric Power Program. This focused initially on attempts to use a Land control system in the Combustion Research Facility (CRF), with limited success in terms of achieving stability and adequacy of control when operating conditions were varied over a moderate range. The experiments in the CRF also yielded very useful data on the intensities and sources of u. v. emission from No. 6 fuel oil flames over a wide range of fuel equivalence ratio. One other set of experiments carried out in the CRF made use of equipment and personnel supplied by the Foxboro Company, and results of this work are discussed. Also included in the report is a summary of measurements carried out on a small methane-fueled burner which add appreciably to the available information on the dependence of the infrared emission on viewing location relative to the flame front and on fuel equivalence ratio. The overall results obtained under this program do not leave the prospect of individual fuel/air ratio controllers within immediate grasp, but they substantially advance the state of knowledge required for attainment of such control. They give a strong indication that satisfactory control could be obtained over a wide range of furnace operating conditions if both i. r. and u. v. signals were monitored and used in the control system.
