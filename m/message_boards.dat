5|$|Unbeknownst to the band, their fanbase was {{connecting}} {{and growing}} on the internet, which was helping to boost the reputation and sales of Pinkerton. When it was released, Pinkerton was considered a critical and commercial failure; however, {{in the years following}} the release of the album, it would gain a much more positive reputation due to word-of-mouth on <b>message</b> <b>boards</b> and various web pages. This expanding internet activity would later {{set the stage for the}} band's 2001 comeback. Renewed interaction between band members took place when Weezer was offered a lucrative offer to perform in Japan in August 2000 for the Summer Sonic Festival. Rehearsals for the show reinvigorated the band into talking about making a new album. The band returned to performing in June 2000, playing low-key shows around Los Angeles under the pseudonym Goat Punishment, ensuring that Weezer would only perform for longtime fans who would recognize the name.|$|E
5|$|Before season 20, {{little was}} shown {{concerning}} Cartman's romantic interests, {{as for the}} most part, his attitude towards females had been sexist. However, at least in one episode ("Chef Goes Nanners"), Cartman develops an attraction to Wendy, which is apparent {{from the end of}} episode when Wendy describes her temporary infatuation towards Cartman as 'sexual tension' and even though Cartman agrees in front of Wendy, he sighs with sorrow at being alone again. During a period when he was physically unable to control his speech and he repeatedly blurted hidden feelings, he expressed a romantic interest in classmate Patty Nelson, a side character who has not been seen before or since. In Season 20, after Cartman is wrongfully accused of being a persistent and highly aggressive internet troll (actually Gerald Broflovski) leaving foul posts primarily targeting women and girls on South Park Elementary's school <b>message</b> <b>boards,</b> the other boys destroy most of Cartman's electronics, and by extension, his social media presence, causing him to become despondent to everything around him. That is until Heidi Turner, who had quit social media in response to the trolling, offers to show him life outside of social media. The two quickly become friends, and later, an official and shockingly very happy couple.|$|E

5|$|Following the {{announcements}} {{concerning the}} three titles, Operation Rainfall {{came into existence}} {{in an effort to}} persuade Nintendo to bring the titles to North America. Xenoblade Chronicles and The Last Story were chosen for their pedigree, while Pandora's Tower was selected due to its unique mechanics {{and the fact that it}} was also published by Nintendo for the Wii. The team also decided on the titles as they were already confirmed for an English release in Europe and had received critical acclaim in Japan, so they avoided trying to push for the release of critically and commercially unsuccessful games such as Earth Seeker. The campaign's title stemmed from the group's wish to inundate Nintendo of America with requests. Beginning in June 2011 on the <b>message</b> <b>boards</b> of gaming site IGN, it was met with support from the gaming community. Its campaign was spread across letters and emails to Nintendo of America president Reggie Fils-Aim√©, in addition to campaigns on Facebook and Twitter. Both physical and digital mediums were chosen for the campaign to make them more obvious and less able to be deleted, as a purely digital campaign would have been. To this end, letters and objects inspired by the titles were sent to Nintendo of America.|$|E
