The aim {{was to determine whether}} Xhosa parents needed <b>guidance</b> <b>programmes</b> and if so, to provide guidelines that addressed this need. A literature study was done and thereafter a survey was conducted using a questionnaire with closed items to collect data from 180 Xhosa parents with children with cerebral palsy living in the rural areas of the Eastern Cape's former Transkei. They were sampled by using a non-random (purposive) sampling method. One hundred and two (102) parents (out of the total of 180) answered the questions in the questionnaires and returned them by mail. The same types of questions were used to interview 54 parents. The data was analyzed by a statistical analyst by Microsoft Excel spread sheets. Data was presented in the form of tables and pie charts and the researcher interpreted the outcomes {{in the light of the}} literature and her own indigenous knowledge of the Xhosa community. The implications of findings for all Xhosa parents with children with cerebral palsy are that they lack knowledge of issues such as cerebral palsy, inclusive education and how to deal with their children with cerebral palsy.

[...] The career <b>guidance</b> <b>programme</b> was carried out with an academic and general grade nine class in Mobile school, a rural Newfoundland central high school. The programme consisted of a variety of activities designed to give the student insight into occupational opportunities and into their own interests and abilities. The objectives of the programme were to increase the students' knowledge of themselves and the world of work, and to help them realistically relate their own self-characteristics to occupational opportunities. [...] A criterion of career development for the ninth grade level was established and a career knowledge instrument to measure this criterion was developed. [...] The career <b>guidance</b> <b>programme</b> was evaluated by pretest and posttest administrations of the career knowledge instrument. The programme was compared with the Seal Cove Prevocational Programme by a posttest administration of the career knowledge instrument to a sample of 150 grade nine academic and general students in the Conception Bay area who had been involved in the Prevocational Programme. A t-test and an analysis of variance were carried out on the data related to the questions of the Project.

40|$|Proefskrif (PhD) [...] PU vir CHO, 1992 OUTLINING THE PROBLEM In the {{contemporary}} Republic of South Africa, {{it is of}} vital importance that each pupil should be guided effectively to develop to his full potential. As society, {{the community and the}} vocational world are undergoing perpetual changes, the school's educational programmes should be subjected to some criterium of relevancy. The complexity of life should therefore be allowed for by the home, the school community as well as the school programmes which specifically include the secondary school's Career <b>Guidance</b> <b>Programme.</b> The secondary school has a specific function in career guidance. The pupil's career choice is evaluated in the outcome of his choice of subject, of course and of field of study, as well as his scholastic achievement and his self-esteem. The value of the school's educational <b>guidance</b> <b>programme</b> is reflected in the youth's future occupational life. This is where he is confronted with the discovery and the maintenance of the self. The quality of the work being done in the school's Career <b>Guidance</b> <b>Programme</b> has far-reaching consequences. As such it has an influence on the country's manpower as well as its economy. Shortages in schooled manpower could hamper the further development of the South African economy. In the course of this study several problem areas have been identified. The researcher will endeavour to outline certain findings and make recommendations in this regard. OBJECTIVES OF THIS STUDY This study intended to evaluate the Career <b>Guidance</b> <b>Programme</b> of the secondary school in the Transvaal. In {{order to be able to}} do such an evaluation, it is necessary to determine to what extent theory and practice can be reconciled. (1) The objective evaluation of the Career <b>Guidance</b> <b>Programme,</b> according to educational criteria, as identified in the literature. (2) The determination of whether the objectives as set by the programme, are being reached. (3) The provision of guidelines for an effective and relevant career orientation programme where necessary. METHOD OF STUDY In order to obtain data available on the topic, literature was explored. Secondly, a questionnaire was used for empirical research. It provided information regarding aspects of the career <b>guidance</b> <b>programme</b> including demographic data, data on national military service, the school's Career <b>Guidance</b> <b>Programme</b> and the respondent's career choice. The questionnaire was completed by first year students of the University of Potchefstroom for Christian Higher Education (Potchefstroom and Vanderbijl Park Campuses), University of Pretoria, Rand Afrikaans University, Technikon Pretoria, Technikon Witwatersrand and Technikon Vaal Triangle. The problem was approached from the perspective of the first-year student. The content of the career <b>guidance</b> <b>programme</b> was analyzed in depth. MAJOR FINDINGS The majority, 688 (75, 0 %) of the 917 respondents (381 men and 536 women) who took part in this research project, matriculated in secondary schools in Transvaal. There were 716 (78, 1 %) respondents from Afrikaans medium-schools, 77 (8, 4 %) from Englishmedium schools, and 119 (13, 0 %) from Afrikaans and English dualmedium schools while 4 (0, 4 %) indicated another medium. The "popular" field of study followed by respondents in the secondary school, in order of priority, are: General field of study - 318 (34, 7 %); Natural Sciences field of study - 273 (29, 8 %); Commercial field of study - 174 (19, 4 %). while the other five fields of study identified, are spread among 152 (16, 6 %) respondents. 495 (54, 0 %) respondents regarded the primary school's career orientation programme as at least "Important", while 882 (96, 2 %) regarded the secondary school's programme as at least "important". Notwithstanding the fact that it should be individualised career guidance is preponderantly taught in large class groups. On the frequency of career choice interviews held with respondents it seemed that the majority never held career choice interviews with subject teachers at primary school level. At secondary school level, 195 (21, 3 %) respondents never held career choice interviews with their teacher counsellor, 251 (27, 4 %) never with a subject teacher and 538 (58, 1 %) never held career choice interviews with the educational advisor. Respondents rather discussed their problems in connection with career choice with their parents, friends and relatives, and a special friend, in this order of priority.   It was also found that schools possess sufficient career information material. The Career <b>Guidance</b> <b>Programme</b> emphasized study as well as career opportunities at university and technikon level in preference to the study and career opportunities at the level of other training and in service training institutions. The presentation of the scheduled themes in std 6 to std 10 were also investigated. Certain themes are highlighted more than others. Less attention is paid to the themes where the teaching of vocational skills, is required. The majority of respondents (672 (73, 3 %) were of the opinion that the school's career <b>guidance</b> <b>programme</b> did not influence their career choices. Most, 817 (89, 1 %) indicated that they had made their career choices independently of their schools' career <b>guidance</b> <b>programme.</b> Salary/compensation is the factor which most strongly influenced their career choice.

40|$|Thesis (M. Ed.) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2011. Career {{choice is}} one of the most {{daunting}} decisions one has to make, since it has implications that affect a variety of aspects in one’s life. For adolescents, career decision–making is even more challenging because it is done at a time when adolescents are going through a period of identity formation, and when their core personalities have not yet been fully formed. It is therefore essential to provide systematic career <b>guidance</b> <b>programmes</b> that will assist adolescents in their career development in order to empower them to make realistic career choices. The school, as a place where adolescents spend most of their time, can be used as a vehicle to promote meaningful career development amongst adolescent learners. However, the contribution by adolescents themselves in determining the appropriate content and career guidance services/activities that will best address their needs is vital. Senior secondary school learners, in particular, are in a position to articulate their career planning needs and to identify the deficits in existing career <b>guidance</b> <b>programmes.</b> The situation in Botswana where career guidance forms only a quarter of the public secondary school <b>guidance</b> and counselling <b>programme,</b> which, with all its four components, is allocated only one 40 minute–period per week deserves special attention. Hence, this study set out to determine: * the career planning needs of Senior Public Secondary School Learners in Gaborone, Botswana as articulated by the learners themselves; * the extent to which the current career <b>guidance</b> <b>programme</b> in Senior Public Secondary Schools meets the needs of the learners. A mixed methods design, consisting of the use of a questionnaire to collect the quantitative data and a qualitative method in the form of focus–group interviews, was used to collect the data for the study. The findings of the study highlight several challenges which hamper the provision of a systematic career <b>guidance</b> <b>programme</b> to the learners, which include limited time, lack of trained personnel and less than optimal career service delivery practices. The lack of key career exploration activities in schools, such as the use of internet resource materials and career video/audio tapes, job–shadowing, career field–trips/excursions and, in some cases, career talks, results in learners experiencing unmet career needs. This situation affects the extent to which the curriculum in place addresses the career planning needs of the learners. No significant differences were noted in the needs of the learners according to gender. The study reveals that the Career <b>Guidance</b> <b>Programme</b> provides the relevant theoretical frame–work for providing the necessary assistance to learners to make informed career decisions. However, the actual implementation of the programme in the different schools leaves a lot to be desired, with several learning outcomes for the career <b>guidance</b> <b>programme</b> in both Form 4 and Form 5 not being achieved. The effectiveness of the annual career fair as a major method of disseminating career information to learners also came into question since most learners expressed having gained minimal benefit from it.

40|$|Proefskrif (PhD (Ortopedagogiek)) [...] PU vir CHO, 1996 Recent {{research}} indicates that depression in childhood and adolescence exists, and that contributory factors are on the increase. Social problems like poverty, unemployment, and political change {{have led to a}} general feeling of helplessness and insecurity. Adolescence is characteristically a time of immense change in the physical, emotional, cognitive, moral, religious, and social areas of the adolescent. The above-mentioned factors, make the adolescent vulnerable, and a prime target for depressive feelings. Some writers view reactive depression, as a general reaction during the emancipation of an adolescent. The family and school, jointly forms {{an integral part of the}} adolescents' total lifestyle, and the role of the parent and educationalist in the guidance of the depressed adolescent should be viewed closely. Taking into account, the vulnerability, that the family experiences in present times, the necessary support for the adolescent, is often sadly lacking. It is therefore imperative, that parents and educators be made aware of, and be enabled to offer, the necessary support and guidance. The purpose of the research was to investigate a variety of guidance techniques from the literature, to evaluate their practical implementation as well as their educational implications; to compare and identify support systems that can be successfully applied. The research also evaluates the feasibility of involving both the family and school in support-system programmes. Chapter two highlights the nature and mannerisms of the adolescent, in the family and school environment, with specific reference to development and vulnerability, in relation to depressive feelings. Chapter three focuses on the identification of depression during adolescence, as well as the incidence, reasons and manifestation of symptoms. Chapter four discusses and evaluates various approaches, with regards to support of the depressed adolescent, in relation to practicability, both in the family and at school. With regards to the literature study, it would seem that an eclectic approach, in the form of group counselling <b>programmes,</b> and parental <b>guidance</b> <b>programmes</b> be implemented. Following the literature study chapter five focuses attention on the empirical research. The following steps were undertaken: The identification of twenty depressive adolescents, who qualify, according to the CDI (Children's Depression Inventory). The above were selected at random, according to gender, and the intensity of depressive feelings, and then divided into three separate guidance groups. Following the <b>guidance</b> <b>programmes,</b> the groups were exposed to two post-test trials, the results of which were compared with each other. With regards to the results of the different guidance groups in Chapter six, it is evident that all three <b>guidance</b> <b>programmes</b> were successful. The combined programme where the adolescents were exposed to both a group counselling programme, and the parents to a parental <b>guidance</b> <b>programme,</b> showed the best results. Followed by the group that were exposed only to group counselling. Although the group, whose parents only had exposure to the parental <b>guidance</b> <b>programme,</b> showed a decline in depressive feelings, it was not as dramatic as the decline in depressive feelings in the above-mentioned guidance groups. Following the investigation it becomes apparent that the teacher in general, as well as the Head of Department: Educational Guidance/Guidance teacher, has an important role to play in the guidance of the depressed adolescent. Parents should, with the necessary support and guidance from the above-mentioned personnel be able to adapt their parenting styles to ease the depressive feelings in their adolescents. Doctora...|$|R

These aims were achieved by firstly conducting a literature study on the historical development of school guidance in the United States of America, Japan, Britain and in South Africa. The practice and status of guidance in South Africa were also discussed. Secondly, a questionnaire based on the interim core syllabus was devised and given to a sample of Standard ten pupils from the Potchefstroom area for completion. The literature study indicated that school <b>guidance</b> <b>programmes</b> introduced to the various education departments were not the same and did not adequately deal with the diversity of issues they needed to address nor had they kept abreast of current changes and developments relevant to the South African context. The empirical investigation indicated that the guidance needs of different population groups differed. The study also revealed that black pupils faced unique problems that could be ascribed to the education system's failure to provide enough guidance support for schools. White pupils were satisfied with the syllabus, while the Black, Coloured and Indian pupils did not agree with certain aspects of the interim core syllabus. The conclusions derived from both the theoretical and practical parts, that is, the literature study and the empirical investigations, provided the guidelines for educators to design a well-structured <b>guidance</b> <b>programme</b> that would be relevant to the needs and experience of all learners. This study recommends that further research should be undertaken in other provinces especially where there are reasonable numbers of Indians and Coloured pupils.
