50|$|<b>Microcosmic</b> <b>salt</b> (see infobox {{for other}} names) is a salt found in urine with the formula Na(NH4)HPO4. It is {{left behind in}} the {{residues}} after extracting the urea from dried urine crystals with alcohol. In the mineral form, <b>microcosmic</b> <b>salt</b> is called stercorite.|$|E
50|$|The bead test is a {{traditional}} part of qualitative inorganic analysis to test {{for the presence of}} certain metals. The oldest one is the borax bead test or blister test. It was introduced by Berzelius in 1812. Since then other salts were used as fluxing agents, such as sodium carbonate or sodium fluoride. The most important one after borax is <b>microcosmic</b> <b>salt,</b> which is the basis of the <b>microcosmic</b> <b>salt</b> bead test.|$|E

40|$|Many substances, {{including}} some common minerals, do not undergo thermal reactions of sufficient magnitude to provide useful differential thermal analyis data. The {{purpose of this}} study was to consider possible new techniques by which differential thermal data could be obtained from such relatively inert substances. The technique explored was to react two substances (the non-reactive material with some chemical agent) and to determine the thermal effects that occur as the mixture is heated. Several reactants were considered including alkali hydroxides, carbonates, and fluorides, <b>microcosmic</b> <b>salt,</b> VrOu, and LLWOT. Of the reactants considered, LirWOn was found to be most satisfactory. Heating curves were obtained using heating rates of approximately 14 oC per minute. Cooling curves were obtained by turning off the furnace power and the cooling rates were nonlinear. Eight silicate minerals, wollastonite, grossular, bytownite, albite, microcline, enstatite, olivine, and zircon were studied. Differential curves for wollastonite, grossular, bytownite, albite, and microcline showed detectable reactions and characteristic differences. The reaction temperatures for enstatite, olivine, and zircon were apparently too high for the furnaces used (1000 'C limit) to detect any reactions. X-ray and optical examination revealed the presence of CaWO., NarWOa, and LiAlSiOn in the reaction end products. It was concluded that this method is feasible and if further developed might broaden the scope of presently existing differential thermal techniques. It is proposed that this method be called differential reaction analysis (DRA) ...|$|E
