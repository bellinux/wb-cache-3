A significant quantity of gas has been discovered at Sangu in the Bay of Bengal, the extraction of which has already started.

30|$|The {{above is}} {{telling of the}} {{significance}} attached to maritime security by China. Notable {{with regard to the}} emphasis on far sea operations and preparedness {{is that it is not}} specific to any particular region or space; rather it is defined by Chinese <b>maritime</b> <b>interest</b> which, as noted above, has been expanding of late. In fact, China has been increasing its access to ports and airfields and making huge investments in infrastructure development and also attempting to establish base facilities with friendly countries like Sri Lanka as part of it Maritime Silk Route initiative. Therefore it is clear that China is embarking on expanding its influence commensurate with its expanding role and interests.|$|E
40|$|Where {{national}} boundaries allow, any {{country with a}} coastline {{has the right to}} enforce its <b>maritime</b> <b>interest</b> over a territorial zone up to 12 nm off shore and may patrol an Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) of 200 Nm off shore. Countries with successful economies achieve this through coastguard organisations backed up by naval resources and huge defence budgets. However, some countries are restricted by their economies and are therefore constrained in the range of cover that they are able to provide. This provides the market with a vessel, that at relatively low cost, can be used to police the countries EEZ whilst allowing the versatility to cover a range of further operational requirements that may be needed to defend national interests. To this end the proposed vessel is designed around the following key criteria: •	A robust vessel giving low through life costs •	A need to be highly versatile in the roles it may perform •	The ability to be modified from its primary role with the minimum of time and expense This report identifies how the criteria is to be met {{through the use of a}} fixed set of vessel parameters including the hull form, powering and command and control systems with the versatility achieved through the introduction of changeable wet and dry mission modules. To further maximise versatility these modules are to be sized to the internal capacity of haulage minicons and are able to be removed from their containers and plug directly into, and interact with, the existing vessel systems. The objective of this design is to provide a good balance between the performances in the primary role, which the vessel will undertake through most of its life, and a range of secondary roles...|$|E

40|$|The {{dissertation}} {{attempted to}} picture the behaviour of maritime- and fishing- related interest groups vis-a-vis the European Union. Case {{studies have been}} used. On the one hand the maritime accidents of the crude carriers Erika and Prestige. The accidents prompted the Commission to initiate. However, {{the content of the}} initiation did not please the <b>maritime</b> <b>interests,</b> therefore they reacted vociferously and tried to influence it so as to be amended. On the other hand is attitudes and behaviours of the fishing industry vis-a-vis the Common Fisheries Policy and especially stock preservation and management. The basic questions set were the following: Regarding the first case study: Despite their international orientation <b>maritime</b> <b>interests</b> appeared to oppose the Union, where common sense would say that they would be groups pressing governments for further transfer of competences from the national to the supranational level. How could this behaviour be explained? On the second case study: Is there an unofficial alliance between fishermen and their respective governments which opposes the unofficial alliance between the Commission and related to fisheries scientists? Analysis did not prove any "anti-europeanism" by <b>maritime</b> <b>interests,</b> therefore refuting the hypothesis. In the particular case study <b>maritime</b> <b>interests</b> did not show their loyalty towards their respective national states but towards the International Maritime Organisation, which is global and specialised instead of the European Union which is considered a regional entity. On the other hand, neither the claim that there are competing alliances between fishermen/governments vs Commission/scientists was corroborated. Relevant to the subject scientific literature, press related to the particular industries and interviews have been used in order to complete the dissertation. ...|$|R
