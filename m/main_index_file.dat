This presentation describes how to create graphical overlays on-the-fly for AWIPS, by using two examples of AWIPS applications that were created by the Applied Meteorology Unit (AMU) located at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station (CCAFS), Florida. The first example is the Anvil Threat Corridor Forecast Tool, which produces a shapefile that depicts a graphical threat corridor of the forecast movement of thunderstorm anvil clouds, based on the observed or forecast upper-level winds. This tool {{is used by the}} Spaceflight Meteorology Group (SMG) at Johnson Space Center, Texas and 45 th Weather Squadron (45 WS) at CCAFS to analyze the threat of natural or space vehicle-triggered lightning over a location. The second example is a launch and landing trajectory tool that produces a DGM file that plots the ground track of space vehicles during launch or landing. The trajectory tool can be used by SMG and the 45 WS forecasters to analyze weather radar imagery along a launch or landing trajectory. The presentation will list {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} both file types for creating interactive graphical overlays in future AWIPS applications. Shapefiles are a popular format used extensively in Geographical Information Systems. They are usually used in AWIPS to depict static map backgrounds. A shapefile stores the geometry and attribute information of spatial features in a dataset (ESRI 1998). Shapefiles can contain point, line, and polygon features. Each shapefile contains a <b>main</b> <b>file,</b> <b>index</b> <b>file,</b> and a dBASE table. The main file contains a record for each spatial feature, which describes the feature with a list of its vertices. The <b>index</b> <b>file</b> contains the offset of each record from the beginning of the main file. The dBASE table contains records for each attribute. Attributes are commonly used to label spatial features. Shapefiles can be viewed, but not created in AWIPS. As a result, either third-party software can be installed on an AWIPS workstation, or new software must be written to create shapefiles in the correct format...|$|R

The objective of this paper is to develop a mobile application which supports a functionality such as changing the attribute name in shapefile or adding the attribute in shapefile by the help of handheld device (mobile).

ArcEditor is used for changing the attribute in computer systems but in the present work, we are building an application in. NET which can provide these features easily.

40|$|Since {{indexing}} systems concentrate {{upon the}} information content {{of materials and}} not upon their form, instructional media centers (IMC) can use one system for all media. Content descriptors can be selected from a thesaurus of accepted terms, from {{the title of the}} material, or from an analysis of the content. The first of these three methods is the most satisfactory for dealing with multiple forms of media; the Sears List of Subject Headings Subject Headings used in the Dictionary Catalogs of the Library of Congress are the most commonly used thesauri.

50|$|Because the <b>index</b> <b>files</b> were so small, they {{minimized}} {{the amount of}} extra data {{that had to be}} downloaded from Usenet to verify that the data files were all present and undamaged, or to determine how many parity volumes were required to repair any damage or reconstruct any missing files. They were most useful in version 1 where the parity volumes were much larger than the short <b>index</b> <b>files.</b> These larger parity volumes contain the actual recovery data along with a duplicate copy of the information in the <b>index</b> <b>files</b> (which allows them to be used on their own to verify the integrity of the data files if there is no small <b>index</b> <b>file</b> available).|$|R
