25|$|There are {{a number}} of {{safeguards}} that are usually taken to prevent this sort of accident happening. Railroads have strict government-approved procedures for testing the air brake systems when <b>making</b> <b>up</b> <b>trains</b> in a yard or picking up cars en route. These generally involve connecting the air brake hoses, charging up the brake system, setting the brakes and manually inspecting the cars to ensure the brakes are applied, and then releasing the brakes and manually inspecting the cars to ensure the brakes are released. Particular attention is usually paid to the rearmost car of the train, either by manual inspection or via an automated end-of-train device, to ensure that brake pipe continuity exists throughout the entire train. When brake pipe continuity exists throughout the train, failure of the brakes to apply or release on one or more cars is an indication that the cars' triple valves are malfunctioning. Depending on the location of the air test, the repair facilities available, and regulations governing the number of inoperative brakes permitted in a train, the car may be set out for repair or taken to the next terminal where it can be repaired.|$|E
6000|$|Of {{the next}} three days I know nothing. I have learned since that, so far from my being the first {{discoverer}} of the Martian overthrow, several such wanderers as myself had already discovered this on the previous night. One man--the first--had gone to St. Martin's-le-Grand, and, while I sheltered in the cabmen's hut, had contrived to telegraph to Paris. Thence the joyful news had flashed all over the world; a thousand cities, chilled by ghastly apprehensions, suddenly flashed into frantic illuminations; they knew of it in Dublin, Edinburgh, Manchester, Birmingham, at the time when I stood upon the verge of the pit. Already men, weeping with joy, as I have heard, shouting and staying their work to shake hands and shout, were <b>making</b> <b>up</b> <b>trains,</b> even as near as Crewe, to descend upon London. The church bells that had ceased a fortnight since suddenly caught the news, until all England was bell-ringing. Men on cycles, lean-faced, unkempt, scorched along every country lane shouting of unhoped deliverance, shouting to gaunt, staring figures of despair. And for the food! Across the Channel, across the Irish Sea, across the Atlantic, corn, bread, and meat were tearing to our relief. All the shipping in the world seemed going Londonward in those days. But of all this I have no memory. I drifted--a demented man. I found myself in a house of kindly people, who had found me on the third day wandering, weeping, and raving through the streets of St. John's Wood. They have told me since that I was singing some insane doggerel about [...] "The Last Man Left Alive! Hurrah! The Last Man Left Alive!" [...] Troubled as they were with their own affairs, these people, whose name, much as I would like to express my gratitude to them, I may not even give here, nevertheless cumbered themselves with me, sheltered me, and protected me from myself. Apparently they had learned something of my story from me during the days of my lapse.|$|E

60|$|The {{rest of the}} {{afternoon}} was spent in <b>making</b> <b>up</b> the <b>train.</b> I am afraid to say how many baggage-waggons followed the engine--certainly a score; then came the Chinese, then we, then the families, and the rear was brought up by the conductor in what, if I have it rightly, is called his caboose. The class to which I belonged was of course far the largest, and we ran over, so to speak, to both sides; so that there were some Caucasians among the Chinamen, and some bachelors among the families. But our own car was pure from admixture, save for one little boy of eight or nine, who had the whooping-cough. At last, about six, the long train crawled out of the Transfer Station and across the wide Missouri river to Omaha, westward bound.|$|R

The service was seen as interfering with the goods services by the CLC and they withdrew it on [...] Despite the low numbers of passengers which had used the service, there was considerable local petitioning {{for it to be}} reinstated. The CLC were reluctant to do this and passenger services did not run again until [...] once again as mixed trains.

30|$|Various {{expensive}} automation {{systems for}} the sorting process, such as PROYARD III, Star II, MSR- 32, and DDC III, have been created to improve {{the control of the}} process of breaking and <b>making</b> <b>up</b> the <b>trains</b> at the humps [1, 2, 3, 4]. These systems regulate the process of car rolling from the hump, and for this purpose, determine the necessary exit speed from each retarder positions. To solve this problem, a significant number of various sensors are included in the automation system. They make it possible to specify the weight of cars, their running resistance, velocity and direction of wind, and other parameters necessary to control the retarders. Problems in controlling the process of cut rolling from the hump arise because of the errors in measuring these parameters, as well as because of random errors in controlling of cars, in the retarders, to the desired exit speed. We do not mean to lessen the importance of this approach, but {{it should be noted that}} there is an alternative approach for solving the problem. It is based on the improvement of the control algorithm of retarder positions and makes it possible to ensure a reliable separation of cuts at the switches even in the conditions of uncertainty.|$|R

This change (mutation) results in cells with uncontrolled growth patterns. In cancer classification, the approach, Back propagation is sufficient and also it is a universal technique of training artificial neural networks. It is also called supervised learning method. It needs many dataset for input and output for <b>making</b> <b>up</b> the <b>training</b> set. The back propagation method may execute the function of collaborate multiple parties. In existing method, collaborative learning is limited and it considers only two parties. The proposed collaborative function can perform well and problems can be solved by utilizing the power of cloud computing. This technical note applies hybrid models of Back Propagation Neural networks (BPN) and fast Genetic Algorithms (GA) to estimate the feature selection in gene expression data. The proposed research work examines many feature selection algorithms which are “fragile”; that is, the superiority of their results varies broadly over data sets. By this research, {{it is suggested that}} this is due to higherorder interactions between features causing restricted minima in search space in which the algorithm becomes attentive. GAs may escape from such minima by chance, because works are highly stochastic.

It is called [...] "The Dream of Love," [...] and it {{represents}} a beautiful young girl, sleeping in a very beautiful but somewhat disarranged bed. Indeed, one hopes, for the sleeper's sake, that the night is warm, and that the room is fairly free from draughts. A ladder of light streams down from the sky into the room, and upon this ladder crowd and jostle one another a small army of plump Cupids, each one laden with some pledge of love. Two of the Imps are emptying a sack of jewels upon the floor. Four others are bearing, well displayed, a magnificent dress (a [...] "confection," [...] I believe, is the proper term) cut somewhat low, but <b>making</b> <b>up</b> in <b>train</b> what is lacking elsewhere.

Caskets, mirrors, twelve-buttoned gloves, scent-bottles and handkerchiefs, hair-pins, and the gayest of parasols, has the God of Love piled into the arms of his messengers. Really a most practical, up-to-date God of Love, moving with the times! One feels that the modern Temple of Love must be a sort of Swan and Edgar's; the god himself a kind of celestial shop-walker; while his mother, Venus, no doubt superintends the costume department.
