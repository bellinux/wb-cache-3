Brad Wete for Entertainment Weekly explained that Mars was [...] "ready to drown his sorrows in a tall glass of alcohol" [...] and tipped [...] "find out what concoction Mars and Marley are whipping up" [...] by watching the clip. Prefix Magazine s Andrew Winistorfer gave the video a harsh critic, he wrote that the smoke was not the only featured in the video as anyone [...] "get to see Damian Marley sell out in real time". He furthered that Damian, [...] "might as well be in McDonald's commercials.

500|$|He {{frequently}} {{tells the}} press that [...] "My music is not Christian, Lecrae is." [...] He told Miami New Timess Crossfade that [...] "I think Christian is a wonderful noun, but a terrible adjective. Are there Christian shoes, Christian clothes, Christian plumbers, Christian pipes? I think if you're going to, you should label it hip-hop... hip-hop is a particular poetic style. Labeling it with the faith assumes that the song {{is going to be}} some kind of sermon, but there's a lot of social and political things that I don't think make it gospel or Christian music." [...] He also stated, [...] "I like to wrap my mind around a total situation. I'm a social anthropologist. If I never been homeless, let <b>me</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> be homeless for a week and soak up that information. More like a method actor. So for me it's spending time with people and talking about things from their perspective." ...|$|E
500|$|The same year, Holmes was {{approached}} by Martin Delany, an African-American man {{who had worked with}} Frederick Douglass. The 38-year-old requested admission to Harvard after having been previously rejected by four schools despite impressive credentials. In a controversial move, Holmes admitted Delany and two other black men to the Medical School. Their admission sparked a student statement, which read: [...] "Resolved That we have no objection to the education and evaluation of blacks but do decidedly remonstrate against their presence in College with us." [...] Sixty students signed the resolution, although 48 students signed another resolution which noted it would be [...] "a far greater evil, if, in the present state of public feeling, a medical college in Boston could refuse to this unfortunate class any privileges of education, which it is {{in the power of the}} profession to bestow". In response, Holmes told the black students they would not be able to continue after that semester. A faculty meeting directed Holmes to write that [...] "the intermixing of races is distasteful to a large portion of the class, & injurious to the interests of the school". Despite his support of education for blacks, he was not an abolitionist; against what he considered the abolitionists' habit of using [...] "every form of language calculated to inflame", he felt that the movement was going too far. This lack of support dismayed friends like James Russell Lowell, who once told Holmes he should be more outspoken against slavery. Holmes calmly responded, [...] "Let <b>me</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> improve and please my fellowmen after my own fashion at present." [...] Nonetheless, Holmes believed that slavery could be ended peacefully and legally.|$|E
