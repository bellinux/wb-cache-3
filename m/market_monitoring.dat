5000|$|Systemic risk {{has been}} {{associated}} with a bank run which has a cascading effect on other banks which are owed money by the first bank in trouble, causing a cascading failure. As depositors sense the ripple effects of default, and liquidity concerns cascade through money markets, a panic can spread through a market, with a sudden flight to quality, creating many sellers but few buyers for illiquid assets. These interlinkages and the potential [...] "clustering" [...] of bank runs are the issues which policy makers consider when addressing the issue of protecting a system against systemic risk. [...] Governments and <b>market</b> <b>monitoring</b> institutions (such as the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and central banks) often try to put policies and rules in place with the justification of safeguarding the interests of the market as a whole, claiming that the trading participants in financial markets are entangled in a web of dependencies arising from their interlinkage. In simple English, this means that some companies are viewed as too big and too interconnected to fail. Policy makers frequently claim that they are concerned about protecting the resiliency of the system, rather than any one individual in that system. [...] Systemic risk arises because of the interaction of market participants, and therefore {{can be seen as a}} form of endogenous risk. See also [...]|$|E
50|$|A 2012 study out of Cornell's College of Veterinary Medicine by Robert Oswald, a {{professor}} of molecular medicine at Cornell's College of Veterinary Medicine, and veterinarian Michelle Bamberger, DVM, soon {{to be published in}} 'New Solutions: A Journal of Environmental and Occupational Health Policy,' suggests that hydraulic fracturing is sickening and killing cows, horses, goats, llamas, chickens, dogs, cats, fish and other wildlife, as well as humans. The study covered cases in Colorado, Louisiana, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Texas. The case studies include reports of sick animals, stunted growth, and dead animals after exposure to hydraulic fracturing spills from dumping of the fluid into streams and from workers slitting the lining of a wastewater impoundment (evaporation ponds) so that it would drain and be able to accept more waste. The researchers stated that it was difficult to assess health impact because of the industry's strategic lobbying efforts that resulted in legislation allowing them to keep the proprietary chemicals in the fluid secret, protecting them from being held legally responsible for contamination. Bamberger stated that if you don't know what chemicals are, you can't conduct pre-drilling tests and establish a baseline to prove that chemicals found postdrilling are from hydraulic fracturing. The researchers recommended requiring disclosure of all hydraulic fracturing fluids, that nondisclosure agreements not be allowed when public health is at risk, testing animals raised near hydraulic fracturing sites and animal products (milk, cheese, etc.) from animal raised near hydraulic fracturing sites prior to selling them to <b>market,</b> <b>monitoring</b> of water, soil and air more closely, and testing the air, water, soil and animals prior to drilling and at regular intervals thereafter.|$|E

5000|$|In his PhD work on {{the wartime}} black market (published under the title Histoire du marché noir 1940-46, 2001) Sanders {{stressed}} the importance of the subject to a correct understanding of the social, economic and political stakes of the occupation. It is these wider implications that led French historian Dominique Veillon (CNRS) to credit the book with leaving a [...] "lasting mark". Sanders' thesis allows for a re-examination of German occupation policy, while also highlighting civilian survival strategies, wealth distribution and the changing occupier-occupied relationship. The author's particular (but not sole) focus is on the German occupier: in France, the latter spent at least 15% of all financial resources available through the Vichy occupation levy on the illegal market. This purchasing started from the onset of occupation. Until December 1941 German economic agencies bought 'anything, at any price'. The uncoordinated bidding led to a black market bubble, the effects of which spilled over into the official markets. Spring 1942 brought the centralisation of German black market purchasing and during the ensuing second phase (until spring 1943) the occupier still bought 'anything', but no longer at 'any price'. Although this stabilised prices, it also encouraged illegal production, with raw materials diverted from official industry allocations. During this second period 50-60% of all Vichy occupation payments were spent on the black market, at a strategic juncture of the war when such extravagance was no longer justifiable. This undermined German finances in France and became a liability to exploitation and collaboration. The third phase of black market exploitation, from summer 1943 {{to the end of the}} occupation, was the most rational. During this period the Germans restricted purchasing to genuinely indispensable strategic raw materials. This built on the effective implementation of a German black market purchasing ban in spring 1943, the support of the Vichy government and French industrial leaders for economic collaboration, business concentrations and closures, <b>market</b> <b>monitoring</b> and resource management methods. As a result, the illegal market in the industrial economy was largely brought under control. Sanders argues that the same degree of economic mobilisation could have been achieved one or even two years earlier, had the Germans abstained from unilateral black market purchasing and instead heeded Vichy calls for closer co-operation. German failure in this area was due to lack of co-ordination, institutional chaos, economic dilettantism, endemic corruption and reckless resource competition - all of which have their origin in the structure of the Nazi regime. While the Germans were relatively successful in their exploitation of French and Belgian industrial resources, illegal food markets demonstrated the limits of coercion. As the nutritional value of official civilian rations remained below subsistence level, the French continued to evade all control efforts and depended on the illegal market for their survival: countermanding food restrictions became something of a national pastime. This further punctured Vichy's will-power (and legitimacy) in enforcing thorough economic control over agricultural production.|$|E
40|$|<b>Market</b> <b>monitoring</b> {{involves}} the systematic analysis of prices and behavior in wholesale power markets {{to determine when}} and whether potentially anti-competitive behavior is occurring. Regional Transmission Organizations (RTOs) typically have a <b>market</b> <b>monitoring</b> function. Because the West does not have active RTOs outside of California, {{it does not have}} the <b>market</b> <b>monitoring</b> that RTOs have. In addition, because the West outside of California does not have RTOs that perform centralized unit commitment and dispatch, the rich data that are typically available to market monitors in RTO markets are not available in the West outside of California. This paper examines the feasibility of <b>market</b> <b>monitoring</b> in the West outside of California given readily available data. We develop simple econometric models of wholesale power prices in the West that might be used for <b>market</b> <b>monitoring.</b> In addition, we examine whether production cost simulations that have been developed for long-run planning might be useful for <b>market</b> <b>monitoring.</b> We find that simple econometric models go a long ways towards explaining wholesale power prices in the West and might be used to identify potentially anomalous prices. In contrast, we find that the simulated prices from a specific set of production cost simulations exhibit characteristics that are sufficiently different from observed prices that we question their usefulness for explaining price formation in the West and hence their usefulness as a <b>market</b> <b>monitoring</b> tool...|$|E
40|$|Policymakers have {{increasingly}} recognized the structural impediments to effective competition in electricity markets, which {{has resulted in}} a renewed emphasis on the need for careful market design and <b>market</b> <b>monitoring</b> in wholesale and retail electricity markets. In this study, we review the <b>market</b> <b>monitoring</b> activities of four Independent System Operators in the United States, focusing on such topics as the organization of an independent <b>market</b> <b>monitoring</b> unit (MMU), the role and value of external market monitors, performance metrics and indices to aid in market analysis, issues associated with access to confidential market data, and market mitigation and investigation authority. There is consensus across the four ISOs that <b>market</b> <b>monitoring</b> must be organizationally independent from market participants and that ISOs should have authority to apply some degree of corrective actions on the market, though scope and implementation differ across the ISOs. Likewise, current practices regarding access to confidential market data by state energy regulators varies somewhat by ISO.
