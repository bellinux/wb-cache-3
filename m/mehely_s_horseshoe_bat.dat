50|$|The trust became {{involved}} in bat conservation in Britain and Ireland in the 1980s, providing information and advice and helping {{to set up the}} network of county Bat Groups that still exists today. In 1980, the Trust purchased a farm building in Devon that is now home to the largest maternity colony of greater <b>horseshoe</b> <b>bats</b> in western Europe. Roost acquisition continued over a period of more than 25 years. Today, the trust still manages 40 <b>horseshoe</b> <b>bat</b> roosts in Britain and Ireland and this also includes, in Wales, the largest maternity colony of lesser <b>horseshoe</b> <b>bats</b> in western Europe. Much of the Trust's bat research has focused on the lesser <b>horseshoe</b> <b>bat,</b> including a number of radio-tracking studies. Population studies include detailed surveys of the lesser <b>horseshoe</b> <b>bat</b> in Ireland. In 2008, the trust published The Lesser <b>Horseshoe</b> <b>Bat</b> Conservation Handbook, a practical guide to the management of lesser <b>horseshoe</b> <b>bat</b> roosts.|$|R

5000|$|<b>Horseshoe</b> <b>bats</b> {{are called}} [...] "chrysanthemum bats" [...] in Chinese {{because they have}} horseshoe-shaped folds of skin that unfurl on their faces like the petals of a flower.

Species found in China include the greater, least, king, big-eared, rufous, Chinese rufous, little Japanese, Blyth's, Osgood's, Pearson's, Thomas's, and Dobson's. The king and Osgood's <b>horseshoe</b> <b>bats</b> are endemic to southwest China.Scientists believe that the SARS coronavirus may have originated in <b>horseshoe</b> <b>bats</b> in China.|$|R

50|$|This {{variety of}} {{habitats}} ensures that {{a wide range}} of fauna occurs on the site. In total 22 species of mammal have been recorded including a strong population of dormouse (Muscardinus avellanarius) and five species of bat, including the Greater <b>Horseshoe</b> <b>bat</b> (Rhinolophus ferrumequinum) and Lesser <b>Horseshoe</b> <b>bat</b> (Rhinolophus hipposideros) which use the site for feeding.

Thirty species of birds are known to breed within this site and at least 23 species of butterfly breed here.|$|R
50|$|These bats use caves for roosts {{during the}} day, {{although}} {{at least one}} individual was found inside a house. They roost singly or form small colonies, consisting of up to six individuals. They are found in caves also occupied by Angolan rousette bats, Large-eared slit-faced <b>bats,</b> Guinean <b>horseshoe</b> <b>bats,</b> RÃ¼ppell's <b>horseshoe</b> <b>bats,</b> Dent's <b>horseshoe</b> <b>bat,</b> Jones's roundleaf bats, and Noack's roundleaf bats.|$|R

50|$|<b>Horseshoe</b> <b>bats</b> {{hibernate}} in cold underground {{sites like}} large caves, during the winter.

50|$|The Madura <b>horseshoe</b> <b>bat</b> (Rhinolophus madurensis) is {{a species}} of bat from the family Rhinolophidae. Current {{taxonomy}} treats the Madura <b>horseshoe</b> <b>bat</b> as a species separate of the Sulawesi <b>horseshoe</b> <b>bat</b> and not including parvus, but Csorba et al. (2003) recognizes both as subspecies of the Sulawesi <b>horseshoe</b> <b>bat.</b> It is known only from seven specimens from Madura Island and the Kangean Islands in Indonesia, and its type locality is Soemenep, Madura Island. The species is listed as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List, and it suffers from habitat loss due to limestone excavation and deforestation for logging and agriculture in its habitat. It is also unknown {{whether or not the}} Madura <b>horseshoe</b> <b>bat</b> lives in any protected areas. The species is cave-roosting and most likely independent of water, foraging in primary forest.|$|R

50|$|The lesser <b>horseshoe</b> <b>bat</b> (Rhinolophus hipposideros), {{is a type}} of European bat {{related to}} but smaller than its cousin, the greater <b>horseshoe</b> <b>bat.</b> The species gets its name from its {{distinctive}} horseshoe-shaped nose.|$|R
50|$|The Timorese <b>horseshoe</b> <b>bat</b> (Rhinolophus montanus) is {{a species}} of bat native to Timor-Leste. Only a single holotype of the Timorese <b>horseshoe</b> <b>bat</b> has ever been collected, so {{information}} regarding the species is limited.|$|R
50|$|The greater <b>horseshoe</b> <b>bat</b> is {{the largest}} <b>horseshoe</b> <b>bat</b> in Europe. It has a {{distinctive}} noseleaf, which has a pointed upper part and a horseshoe shaped lower part. Its horseshoe noseleaf helps to focus the ultrasound it uses to 'see'. The greater <b>horseshoe</b> <b>bat</b> also has tooth and bone structures that are distinct from that of other rhinolophids. Its first premolar on the upper jaw protrudes from the row of teeth. For other <b>horseshoe</b> <b>bats,</b> this premolar is very small or non-existent. Also in comparison to its relatives, the greater <b>horseshoe</b> <b>bat</b> has relatively short third and fourth metacarpal bones in its wings. It also lacks a tragus. The Greater <b>Horseshoe</b> <b>Bat</b> is on average between 57 and 71 mm long, with a 35 - 43 mm tail and a 350 - 400 mm wingspan. The fur of the species is soft and fluffy, with the base of hairs being light grey, the dorsal side hair grey brown and the ventral side grey-white, with juvenile bats having more of an ash-grey tint to their fur. Wing membranes and ears are light grey-brown. It weighs up to 30 grams.|$|R
50|$|The {{constant}} frequency {{sound is}} between 105 and 112 kHz, {{with a short}} drop in frequency {{at the end of}} the signal, which normally lasts between 20 and 30 milliseconds.

The fur is brown in colour, varying from almost black to a lighter, cinnamon, shade, and is paler on the animal's underside. Distinguishing features of the bat include a long, narrow, skull, unusually large ears, and a uniquely shaped nose-leaf. Apart from the nose-leaf, they most closely resemble the king <b>horseshoe</b> <b>bat,</b> but are smaller, with a longer, narrower antitragus.|$|R
50|$|Little {{is known}} about the Thai <b>horseshoe</b> <b>bat,</b> {{including}} its abundance, population size, population trend, major threats, natural history, or presence in protected areas.
