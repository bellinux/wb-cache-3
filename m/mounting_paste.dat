40|$|Summary Usually low basis-weight Chinese {{painting}} {{papers are}} mostly made from silk or non-wood long fibers which are thinner {{and easy to}} brittle by aging as well. In order to have attractive appearance and storage convenience, Chinese painting papers are backed with flax paper cotton fabrics i. e., so called "mounting". Paste varieties show apparent influence on the mounting properties {{and the life of}} Chinese painting. The {{purpose of this study was}} intended to investigate:(1) the manufacturing procedures of pastes and their properties (2) effect of preservatives and cooling on the conservation of paste varierties (3) effect of commercial preservatives-phenol and aluminum sulfate on the properties of <b>mounting</b> <b>pastes</b> and Chinese painting papers. The experimental results were summarized as follows: 1. For wheat starch, the concentration of starch to water 1 : 6 in gelatinazation achieved a stable pasting property, but the gelatinization temperature should not over 80 ℃. 2. The pH of pastes decreased as prior to wheat starch soaking, and picking strength decreased as the soaking time (days) increasing. Besides, the viscosity of diluted liquor increased as the soaking time increasing. 3. It was apparent that aluminum sulfate has much influence on brightness, tensile and fold of Chinese painting papers. Phenol addition resulted in paste color change. In addition, color change of paste may be inhibited by addition of both of alum and phenol. No color change occurred while over 2 % alum followed by phenol were added in the paste. 4. There was no significant beneficial effect on the conservation of Chinese painting papers by the addition of alum in paste. Besides, sodium benzoic acid, borax and potassium sorbate addition can not prevent the paste from mould growth, but benzoic acid and thymol have better mold growth resistance. 5. Alum and phenol-containing commercial pastes are not available for the conservation of papers. It is apparent to lessen the paper aging for the use of high pH and viscosity of paste while NaOH was added. Paste showed the highest viscosity at pH 7 - 8. The improved picking strength can be achieved by the addition of optimum amount of NaOH, MgCO 3 and CaCO 3 in the paste, but Ca(OH) 2 and Ba(OH) 2 were in vain. 6. The improved picking strength and softness of mounted paper were caused by the addition of preservatives i. e., benzoic acid and thymol in the paste, nevertheless, there was no apparent paper strength deterioration occurred. 7. Cold storage make paste preservation available. Cold the water-covered paste in a cold room will not deteriorate the properties of the paste and the picking strength of papers, in addition to this, picking strength can be improved with no mould growth. 摘 要 中國的書畫主要採用絲絹或宣紙為材料作成，其材料質地纖薄，柔軟，歷 時較久易破碎。為了利於收藏、欣賞，以麻紙、布帛等在書畫背面裝裱， 稱之為「裱褙」。裱褙所使用的材料中，以漿糊最為重要，因漿糊的好壞 會影響裝裱的品質，也關係到書畫日後之保存性。本研究主要針對裱褙用 漿糊的製法及性質，及添加防腐劑及冷藏對漿糊的保存性影響，並針對市 售裱褙用漿糊使用的防腐劑-酚及硫酸鋁對漿糊及紙張性質的影響做一探 討，並嘗試以添加鹼於工業用漿糊的方式中和其酸性物質。試驗結果如下 ﹕ 1. 以小麥澱粉為原料，製糊時濃度以澱粉﹕水＝ 1 ﹕ 6 ，所製得的糊性質 較穩定，而煮糊溫度以不超過 80 ℃為佳。 2. 小麥澱粉之前浸泡處理所製之糊pH值會下降，且剝離強度會隨泡水天 數增加而下降，稀釋液的黏度則會有隨泡水天數增加的趨勢。 3. 硫酸鋁對紙張之白度、引張強度及耐摺力影響很大，酚會導致漿糊的 變色，二者同時添加，硫酸鋁會抑制酚對漿糊的變色，添加 2 %以上硫酸 鋁之漿糊，再添加酚則沒有變色的情形。添加硫酸鋁及酚可增加漿糊的黏 度及剝離強度。 4. 添加硫酸鋁對漿糊保存性並沒有太大幫助，苯甲酸鈉、硼砂及己二烯 酸鉀不能防止漿糊的發霉﹔而酚、苯甲酸及瑞香草酚的防黴抗菌性較佳。 5. 添加硫酸鋁及酚的工業用漿糊不利於紙張的保存。添加鹼可提升工業 用漿糊液的pH值及黏度，並對紙張劣化有明顯的緩和作用。漿糊的黏度在 pH值為 7 ~ 8 時最大。添加適當的氫氧化鈉、碳酸鎂及碳酸鈣可增加漿糊的 剝離強度﹔添加氫氧化鈣及氫氧化鋇則較無效果。 6. 苯甲酸及瑞香草酚可作為漿糊的防腐劑使用，劣化後紙力衰退並不明 顯，並可增加漿糊的剝離強度及裱褙後的柔軟度。 7. 冷藏為保存漿糊的可行辦法，漿糊表面覆水後冷藏在低溫下並不會降 低漿糊的品質，在未發霉的情況下可增加剝離強度...|$|R

40|$|Moisture Sensitive Devices (MSD) {{have become}} widely {{used with the}} {{increased}} sophistication of electronic products. However, MSDs present a number of challenges when used in surface mount assembly as they may suffer internal damage during the manufacturing process {{if they are not}} handled and stored according to industry standards. In surface <b>mount</b> assembly, solder <b>paste</b> is printed on to a PCB, components are mounted and the entire board is sent through a reflow oven. In the reflow process the entire PCB and component packages are heated along with the solder and component leads. The high reflow temperatures can cause a package containing moisture to swell and crack affecting the performance and reliability of the component. These problems are normally the result of poor handling and storage of MSDs. While most of the damaged components may be detected prior to shipment of the final product, many make it to the market place only to fail out in the field. Although a component with external cracking may pass pre-shipment functional tests, subsequent high temperature and moisture exposure can induce the transport of ionic contaminants through these openings to the die surface increasing the potential for failure due to corrosion. Furthermore, internal cracking/delamination can be present even if {{there is no evidence of}} external cracks. Ball grid array (BGAs) and chip scale packages (CSPs) are especially sensitive to moisture and damage to these components can be very difficult to detect. Manufacturers must pay close attention to their handling and storage of MSDs to maximize yields and ensure the quality of their finished products.
