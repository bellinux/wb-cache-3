40|$|Arbuckle-Simpson aquifer in {{southern}} Oklahoma, USA, is a <b>major</b> <b>source</b> {{of water for}} industrial and municipal use. It is also a <b>major</b> <b>source</b> for spring-fed <b>streams</b> in the area. As {{part of an ongoing}} study to map and characterize the Arbuckle-Simpson aquifer, an electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) study and electrical resistivity sounding studies were conducted in Johnston County, Oklahoma, USA, to map the subsurface of a small area of the carbonate aquifer. The main aim {{of the study was to}} obtain constraints on the location of near surface faults and fractures and how they control groundwater flow in the study area. The interpreted resistivity section along an N-S profile indicates that the water table in the region is deepening to the south and probably bounded in the north by a south dipping fault. Inverse modeling of 2 D electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) data acquired at two adjacent locations within the study area indicate shallow, fractured Arbuckle group rocks saturated with water adjacent to dry rocks. From electrical resistivity mapping results, it is inferred that the Mill Creek block in the Arbuckle-Simpson aquifer is an isolated system, interacting with the northern segment of a silicate-based aquifer through dissolution faults and fractures...|$|R
40|$|The Tizinafu {{watershed}} has {{a complex}} mountainous terrain {{in the western}} Kunlun Mountains; little study {{has been done on}} the spatial and temporal characteristics of snow cover in the region. Daily snow cover data of 10 hydrological years (October 2002 to September 2012) in the watershed were generated by combining MODIS Terra (MOD 10 A 1) and Aqua (MYD 10 A 1) snow cover products and employing a nine-day temporal filter for cloud reduction. The accuracy and window size of the temporal filter were assessed using a simulation approach. Spatial and temporal characteristics of snow cover in the watershed were then analyzed. Our results showed that snow generally starts melting in March and reaches the minimum in early August in the watershed. Snow cover percentages (SCPs) in all five elevation zones increase consistently with the rise of elevation. Slope doesn’t {{play a major role in}} snow cover distribution when it exceeds 10 °. The largest SCP difference is between the south and the other aspects and occurs between mid-October and mid-November with decreasing SCP, indicating direct solar radiation may cause the reduction of snow cover. While both the mean snow cover durations (SCDs) of the hydrological years and of the snowmelt seasons share a similar spatial pattern to the topography of the watershed, the coefficient of variation of the SCDs exhibits an opposite spatial distribution. There is a significant correlation between annual mean SCP and annual total stream flow, indicating that snowmelt is a <b>major</b> <b>source</b> of <b>stream</b> runoff that might be predictable with SCP...|$|R

Ecological Indicators, 25, pp. 184 - 196. Fine sediment {{is one of}} the <b>major</b> <b>sources</b> of <b>stream</b> physical and ecological impairment worldwide. We assessed the ecological effects of fine sediment in an otherwise undisturbed catchment (the Is?bena, NE Spain). Using data from sites across the catchment we describe the spatial variability and nestedness of invertebrate assemblages and evaluate the effectiveness of compositional (taxon-based) and functional (trait-based) metrics for detecting sediment impacts on these assemblages. Invertebrate assemblages were relatively taxon poor and had low densities in those locations with high fine sediment content. Assemblages showed significantly nested patterns, with those in sediment-rich locations consisting of a subset of those in locations with little fine sediment. A number of biological traits appeared to promote this nestedness, particularly those conferring resistance and resilience to fine sediment (polivoltinism, short live cycles and small body sizes). Generalised Additive Models indicated that most metrics were able to detect ecological responses to sedimentation. Some taxon-based metrics (%EPT and evenness) performed less well, with values showing only a weak relationship with fine sediment. Results are consistent with previous studies which have highlighted the limitations of taxon-based metrics and suggest that indices of functional diversity are capable of detecting sediment related impairment. Overall, the study suggests that fine sediment in the Is?bena was selecting for specific life-history traits, and that this selection resulted in clear differences in assemblage structure across the catchment. The use of biological traits in studies of sediment related disturbance may help identify extinction-prone species (e. g. those with univoltine and/or long life-cycles), while trait-based monitoring and assessment metrics, because they reflect the ecological mechanisms underlying observed patterns, should prove useful to help guide management in catchments subjected to excessive fine sediment. More broadly, the study indicates that nestedness in assemblage structure can be driven by local habitat changes, and not only by large scale biogeographical processes. Peer reviewe...|$|R

With {{a large number of}} stream PEs (Processing Elements) implementing various stream analytic algorithms, running on a large-scale, distributed cluster of nodes, and collaboratively digesting several multi-modal <b>source</b> <b>streams</b> with vastly differing rates, prototyping a reference application on System S faces many challenges. Specifically, we focus on our experience in prototyping DAC (Disaster Assistance Claim monitoring), a reference application dealing with multi-modal stream analytic and monitoring. We describe three critical challenges: (1) How do we generate correlated, multi-modal <b>source</b> <b>streams</b> for DAC? (2) How do we design and implement a comprehensive stream application, like DAC, from many divergent stream analytic PEs? (3) How do we deploy DAC in light of <b>source</b> <b>streams</b> with extremely different rates?

40|$|Abstract—Streaming erasure codes encode a <b>source</b> <b>stream</b> to {{guarantee}} that each source packet is recovered within a fixed delay at the receiver over a burst-erasure channel. This paper introduces diversity embedded streaming erasure codes (DE-SCo), that provide a flexible tradeoff between the channel quality and receiver delay. When the channel conditions are good, the <b>source</b> <b>stream</b> is recovered with a low delay, whereas when the channel conditions are poor the <b>source</b> <b>stream</b> is still recovered, albeit with a larger delay. Information theoretic analysis of the underlying burst-erasure broadcast channel reveals that DE-SCo achieve the minimum possible delay for the weaker user, without sacrificing {{the performance of the}} stronger user. A larger class of multicast streaming erasure codes (MU-SCo) that achieve optimal tradeoff between rate, delay and erasure-burst length is also constructed. I...|$|R

A <b>source</b> <b>stream</b> is understood as generated from a note played by a musical instrument.

The propagated weights are calculated in the forward tracking stage, followed by an iterative tracking of the most likely trajectories in the backward tracking stage. Then, the estimation of the underlying <b>source</b> <b>streams</b> is carried out by means of iteratively pruning the candidate trajectories in a maximum likelihood manner. The proposed system is evaluated by a specially constructed polyphonic music database.

40|$|Stream {{mitigation}} banking is rapidly becoming a major {{driver of the}} stream restoration industry, particularly in the Southeast. Like other types of {{mitigation banking}} regulated by the Clean Water Act Section 404 program, stream mitigation banking (SMB) gives developers the option to offset construction impacts by purchasing “credits. ” These credits are generated by for-profit companies that restore damaged streams on a speculative basis and are approved by federal regulatory agencies. In states such as North Carolina, SMB has now eclipsed wetlands banking in terms of number of credits bought and sold. SMB is becoming a <b>major</b> private-sector <b>source</b> of <b>stream</b> restoration funding, perhaps presaging {{a major shift in}} what has been until now a predominantly publicly funded market. In addition to its growing eco-nomic importance, the emerging practice of SMB is worth attention because many of the tensions and debates that have been settled in the more established practice of wet-lands mitigation banking are still unresolved, and thus potentially open to input from practitioners and scientists. The most important of these are the proper amount and location of compensation, and how stream credits should be certified and measured. Mitigation banking began in the early 1990 s, when private developers frustrated with the slow pace of Section 404 permitting and the high cost of creating new on-site wetlands proposed the creation of large consolidated areas of constructed wetlands as advance compensation to th...|$|R
