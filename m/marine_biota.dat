40|$|SYNOPSIS. Patterns of {{distribution}} and processes of differentiation {{have often been}} contrasted between terrestrial and <b>marine</b> <b>biotas.</b> The islands of Oceania offer an excellent setting to explore this contrast, because the geographic setting for terrestrial and shallow-water, benthic, marine organisms are the same: the myriad islands strewn across the vast Pacific. The size of species ranges and the geographic distribution of endemism are two biogeographic attributes that are thought to differ markedly between terrestrial and <b>marine</b> <b>biotas</b> in the Pacific. While terrestrial species are frequently confined to single islands or archipel-agoes throughout Oceania, marine species tend to have wide to very wide distributions, and are rarely restricted to single island groups except for the most isolated archipelagoes. We explore {{the conditions under which}} species can reach an island by dispersal and differentiate. Genetic differentiation can occur either through founder speciation or vicariance; these processes are requisite ends of a continuum. We show that founder speciation is most likely when few propagules enter the dispersal medium and survive well while they travel far. We argue that conditions favorable to founder speciation are common in marine as well as terrestrial systems, and that terrestrial-type, archipelagic-level endemism is likely common in marine taxa. We give examples of marine groups that show archipelagic level endemism on most Pacific island groups as well as of terrestrial species that are widespread. Thus both the patterns and processes of insular diver-sification are variable, and overlap more between land and sea than previously considered...|$|R

Here, using a novel multidimensional functional framework and comprehensive null-models, we compare the functional structure of Cambrian, Silurian and modern benthic <b>marine</b> <b>biotas.</b> We demonstrate that, after controlling for increases in taxonomic diversity, functional richness increased incrementally between each time interval with benthic taxa filling progressively more functional space, combined with a significant functional dissimilarity between periods. The modern benthic biota functionally overlaps with fossil biotas but some modern taxa, especially large predators, have new trait combinations that may allow more functions to be performed. From a methodological perspective, these results illustrate the benefits of using multidimensional instead of lower dimensional functional frameworks when studying changes in functional diversity over space and time...|$|R

However, cone snails {{are a small}} minority of venomous molluscan biodiversity, the vast majority being tiny venomous morphospecies in the family Turridae. A novel method called lumun-lumun opens access to these micromolluscs and their venoms. Old fishing nets are anchored to the sea bottom for a period of 1 - 6 months and <b>marine</b> <b>biotas</b> rich in small molluscs are established. In a single lumun-lumun community, we found a remarkable gastropod biodiversity (155 morphospecies). Venomous predators belonging to the superfamily Conoidea (36 morphospecies) were the largest group, the majority being micromolluscs in the family Turridae. We carried out an initial analysis of the most abundant of the turrid morphospecies recovered, Clathurella (Lienardia) cincta (Dunker, 1871). In contrast to all cDNA clones characterized from cone snail venom ducts, one of the C. cincta clones identified encoded two different peptide precursors presumably translated from a single mRNA. The prospect of easily accessing so many different morphospecies of venomous marine snails raises intriguing toxinological possibilities: the 36 conoidean morphospecies in this one net alone have the potential to yield thousands of novel pharmacologically active compounds.

50|$|The {{interaction}} between <b>marine</b> <b>biota</b> and geologic processes {{is very important}} to shoreline stability, especially in soft sedimentary environments where sediments are more likely to erode away. Benthic, and planktonic organisms, as well as Shellfish filter, package, and even bind fine sediments together in tidal regions. This action reduces turbidity in the area by solidifying and protecting loose, soft sediments, and thus allowing for more colonization by other organisms. If disturbance of these soft sediments occurs, particularly through human interaction like shellfish harvesting, dredging, or the introduction of toxins the environment may drastically change. If this occurs, and <b>marine</b> <b>biota</b> are removed from the environment, erosion can occur, or increase, especially in regions prone to wave action and tidal resuspension (Bernal P., and P.M.

40|$|In natural environments, <b>marine</b> <b>biotas</b> {{are exposed}} {{to a variety of}} {{simultaneously}} acting abiotic factors. Among these, temperature, irradiance and CO 2 availability are major factors influencing the physiological performance of marine macroalgae. To test whether elevated levels of CO 2 may remediate the otherwise reduced performance of uncalcified seaweeds under the influence of other stressful abiotic factors, we performed multifactorial experiments with the red alga Chondrus crispus from Helgoland (North Sea) with two levels of CO 2, temperature and irradiance: low and high pCO 2 levels were tested in combination with either (1) optimal and low irradiances or (2) optimal and sub-lethal high temperatures for growth. Performance of C. crispus was evaluated as biomass increase and relative growth rates (RGR), gross photosynthesis and pigment content. Acclimations of growth and photosynthesis were measured after 4 and 8 days. Acclimation time was crucial for elucidating single or combined CO 2 effects on growth and photosynthesis. Signifi- cant CO 2 effects became evident only in combination with either elevated temperature or reduced irradiance. Growth and photosynthesis had divergent patterns: RGR and biomass significantly increased only under a combination of high pCO 2 and elevated temperature; gross photosynthesis was significantly reduced under high pCO 2 conditions at low irradiance. Pigment content varied in response to irradiance and temperature, but was independent of pCO 2...|$|R
40|$|The {{impact of}} global warming on the {{composition}} of <b>marine</b> <b>biotas</b> is increasing, underscoring the need for better baseline information on the species currently present in given areas. Little {{is known about the}} bryozoan fauna of Israel; the most recent publication concerning species from the Mediterranean coast was based on samples collected in the 1960 s and 1970 s. Since that time, not only have the species present in this region changed, but so too has our understanding of bryozoan taxonomy. Here we use samples collected during the last decade to identify 47 bryozoan species, of which 15 are first records for the Levantine basin. These include one new genus and species (Crenulatella levantinensis gen. et. sp. nov.), two new species (Licornia vieirai sp. nov. and Trematooecia mikeli sp. nov.), and two species that may be new but for which available material is inadequate for formal description (Reteporella sp. and Thalamoporella sp.). In addition, Conopeum ponticum is recorded for the first time from the Mediterranean Sea. Non-indigenous species make up almost one-quarter of the 47 species identified. All of the non-indigenous species are native to tropical and subtropical regions, implying a change of the Levant bryozoan biota from a temperate to a more tropical state, probably related to both higher temperature and salinity and to the opening of the Suez Canal connecting the Red Sea and the Eastern Mediterranean...|$|R
40|$|For present-day biotas, close {{relationships}} {{have been documented}} {{between the number of}} species in a given region and the area of the region. To date, however, there have been only limited studies of these relationships in the geologic record, particularly for ancient <b>marine</b> <b>biotas.</b> The recent development of large-scale marine paleontological databases, in conjunction with enhanced geographical mapping tools, now allow for their investigation. At the same time, there has been renewed interest in comparing the environmental and paleobiological properties of two broad-scale marine settings: epicontinental seas, broad expanses of shallow water covering continental areas, and open-ocean-facing settings, shallow shelves and coastlines that rim ocean basins. Recent studies indicate that spatial distributions of taxa and the kinetics of taxon origination and extinction may have differed in these two settings. Against this backdrop, we analyze regional Genus-Area Relationships (GARs) of Late Cretaceous marine invertebrates in epicontinental sea and open-ocean settings using data from the Paleobiology Database. We present a new method for assessing GARs that is particularly appropriate for fossil data when the geographic distribution of these data is patchy and uneven. Results demonstrate clear relationships between genus richness and area for regions worldwide, but indicate that as area increases, genus richness increases more per unit area in epicontinental seas than in open-ocean settings. This difference implies a greater degree of compositional heterogeneity as a function of geographic area in epicontinental sea settings, a finding that is consistent with the emergin...|$|R

40|$|The {{transport}} of organisms across oceans is an anthropogenic agent of global change that has profoundly affected the natural distribution of littoral biota and altered {{the makeup of}} biogeographic regions. The homogenization of <b>marine</b> <b>biotas</b> is a phenomenon especially affecting coastal regions and is spearheaded by a suite of opportunistic species {{at the expense of}} native species. Climate change may exacerbate the trend: sea surface temperatures, hydrodynamics, pH and carbonate cycles, already show marked fluctuations compared to the past. Alien invasive species are impacted by the change of marine climate in a variety of ways, which are we have just begun to notice, observe and interpret. A conceptual framework has yet to be conceived that links theories on biological introductions and invasions with the physical aspects of global change. Therefore predicting the scale of invasions or their impact on biodiversity is a daunting task. Integration of biological and environmental information systems, niche models, and climate projections would improve management of aquatic ecosystems under the dual threats of biotic invasions and climate change. The recorded spread of alien species and analysis of patterns of invasions may serve as the starting point for searching connections with climate change descriptors. The Mediterranean Sea is home to an exceptionally large number of alien species, resulting from its exceptional history and multiple vectors. For much of the twentieth century alien thermophilic species, which had entered the Mediterranean through the Suez Canal, have been confined to the Levantine Basin. In recent years climate driven hydrographic changes have coincided with a pronounced expansion of alien thermophilic biota to the central and western basins of the Mediterranean. We discuss some changes in emergent functions and services in Mediterranean ecosystems under the combined effect of invasive species and climate changes...|$|R

40|$|Knowledge of Antarctic biotas and environments has {{increased}} dramatically in recent years. There {{has also been a}} rapid increase in the use of novel technologies. Despite this, some fundamental aspects of environmental control that structure physiological, ecological and life-history traits in Antarctic organisms have received little attention. Possibly {{the most important of these}} is the timing and availability of resources, and the way in which this dictates the tempo or pace of life. The clearest view of this effect comes from comparisons of species living in different habitats. Here, we (i) show that the timing and extent of resource availability, from nutrients to colonisable space, differ across Antarctic marine, intertidal and terrestrial habitats, and (ii) illustrate that these differences affect the rate at which organisms function. Consequently, there are many dramatic biological differences between organisms that live as little as 10 m apart, but have gaping voids between them ecologically. Identifying the effects of environmental timing and predictability requires detailed analysis in a wide context, where Antarctic terrestrial and marine ecosystems are at one extreme of the continuum of available environments for many characteristics including temperature, ice cover and seasonality. Anthropocentrically, Antarctica is harsh and as might be expected terrestrial animal and plant diversity and biomass are restricted. By contrast, Antarctic <b>marine</b> <b>biotas</b> are rich and diverse, and several phyla are represented at levels greater than global averages. There has been much debate on the relative importance of various physical factors that structure the characteristics of Antarctic biotas. This is especially so for temperature and seasonality, and their effects on physiology, life history and biodiversity. More recently, habitat age and persistence through previous ice maxima have been identified as key factors dictating biodiversity and endemism.

40|$|Aim To {{determine}} if K≈çko Seamount submerged {{below sea level}} before Kure Island and Pearl and Hermes Reef formed, resulting in {{a period in which}} there were no extant islands. A period with no islands would eliminate prior terrestrial and shallow <b>marine</b> <b>biotas</b> that could migrate from island to island and require a restart of colonization from distant shores to populate the younger islands of the Hawaiian volcanic chain. Location Emperor Seamount Chain, north-central Pacific Ocean. Methods We estimate subsidence rates for K≈çko Seamount using ages determined from fossil large foraminifera and Sr-isotopes, and maximum depths using palaeodepth estimates based on coralline algae. These data are combined with palaeolatitude changes as the Pacific Plate moved northwards, sea level variations, and sea surface temperature variations at the seamount through time to reconstruct the time and causes of submergence. Results Rounded carbonate clasts include three facies: zooxanthelate corals, bioclastic packstones to rudstones, and rhodolith floatstones. Two rudstones contain relatively deep-water, coralline algal rhodoliths and large foraminifera indicative of Aquitanian (20. 4 ‚Äì 20 Ma) and Burdigalian (20 ‚Äì 16 Ma) stages of the Early Miocene, consistent with Sr-isotope ages of algae and one sample of large foraminifera. Corals grew on K≈çko Seamount from c. 50 to 27. 1 ¬± 0. 4 Ma, the youngest Sr-isotope age of a coral sample. These shallow, warm-water coral reefs came under increasing stress as the volcano subsided at 0. 012 ¬± 0. 003 mm yr‚àí 1, and migrated northwards, and as global climate cooled. The summit submerged and shallow coral reef growth ceased before 29 Ma, probably around 33 Ma. The volcano continued its slow subsidence, and deep-water carbonates accumulated until they too were unable to keep pace, dying out at c. 16 Ma. Main conclusions The final submergence of the summit of K≈çko Seamount by about 33 Ma confirms that biota on older Hawaiian‚ÄìEmperor Islands could not have migrated from island to island along the entire chain to eventually colonize the present Hawaiian Islands. There was a period between at least 33 and 29 Ma in which no islands existed, and distant colonization had to repopulate the younger portion of the Hawaiian chain, which began to emerge between about 29 and 23 Ma...|$|R

The objectives of the research were to determine the characteristics of marine water and its sediment, which are important control for coral reef growth in the study area. The survey acquired samples of Total Suspended Sediment (TSS) and gravity coring. Several analyses were then carried out on those samples; TSS analysis to {{determine the amount of}} suspended sediments in sea water that reflect the water quality for marine ecology, stratigraphic profile and sediment thickness pattern analyses to determine the sources of sediment, and grain-size analysis based on granulometry to determine deposition energy and grain-size distribution in the area. Those analyses were both conducted on-board Baruna Jaya VIII research vessel and P 2 O LIPI laboratory in Jakarta. The results showed that in Java Sea nearby Karimun Java Islands, the sediment supply came from the surrounding islands. Two sedimentary units were found in this area. The first units has thickness of tens centimeter from sea bed surface. It is characterized by grayish green color, grain size variation from clay to coarse sand, soft or low density and abundance with shells. The second unit is located beneath the first one, indicated by sharp contact. It is characterized by brownish color, higher density resembling the density of rock, less compacted and can be broken easily by hand, with occasionally thin carbon lenses or remnant of decomposed vegetation, and less shell or fossil At sea surface, TSS distribution shows value between 0. 018 and 0. 034 gr/l, with average of 0. 025 gr/l, whereas at near bottom sea, it ranges between 0. 024 and 0. 030 gr/l, with average value of 0. 027 gr/l.
