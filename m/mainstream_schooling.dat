40|$|Objectives: To examine {{perceived}} {{participation in}} students with ASC and their classmates in <b>mainstream</b> <b>schools</b> and to investigate correlations between activities the students {{wanted to do}} and actually participated in. Methods: Twenty-two students with ASC and their 382 classmates responded to a 46 -item questionnaire regarding perceived participation in <b>mainstream</b> <b>schools.</b> Results: On 57 % of the items, students with ASC perceived lower participation than their classmates. These results emphasize the importance of knowledge about students’ perceived participation.

Conclusion: Students with ASC perceived lower overall participation in <b>mainstream</b> <b>school</b> than their classmates. The correlations between “I want to” and “I do” statements in students with ASC indicated that aspects of autonomy are important to incorporate when studying, and interpreting, self-rated participation in <b>mainstream</b> <b>schools...</b>|$|R

40|$|The main {{assertion}} in this dissertation is {{that there}} is a lack of adequate and appropriate parental involvement in the education of learners with mild intellectual impairment in <b>mainstream</b> <b>schools</b> in Sisonke District. Empirical research was conducted to understand the perceptions of parents and teachers of the involvement of parents in the education of learners with mild intellectual impairment in <b>mainstream</b> <b>schools.</b> The focus was on parents and teachers in an extreme poverty context in Sisonke District of KwaZulu-Natal. A qualitative investigation of parental involvement in five <b>mainstream</b> <b>schools</b> was conducted by collecting data through interview, observation and documents analysis with ten parents and five teachers. The literature that was reviewed focused on the factors that increase and hinder parental involvement, prevalence of intellectual impairment, theories related to family, school and community partnership and inclusive education. The research has revealed that the lack of adequate and appropriate parental involvement at <b>mainstream</b> <b>schools</b> admitting learners with mild intellectual impairment is influenced by factors such as poor socio-economic background, high illiteracy, cultural beliefs, and parents’ denial of intellectual impairment, diversity, lack of teacher training in parental involvement, lack of healthy inclusive climate characteristics, parents’ attitudes and perceptions. The investigation further found that there is an urgent need for teachers to acquire knowledge, skills and strategies for active involvement of parents in inclusive <b>mainstream</b> <b>schools.</b> Each School Management Team (SMT) should strive to create a climate of inclusion that displays healthy school characteristics in order to improve parental involvement in <b>mainstream</b> <b>schools.</b> Inclusive EducationM.

In the group of age-matched severely deaf children, 38 % (239 children) attended <b>mainstream</b> <b>schools,</b> whereas 51 % (326 children) were in a unit of a <b>mainstream</b> <b>school,</b> and 11 % (70 children) were in schools for the deaf. Statistical analysis revealed a highly {{significant difference between the}} educational placement of implanted children and hearing-aided profoundly deaf children (p< 0. 00001), whereas there was no statistically significant difference between implanted children and hearing-aided severely deaf children. In conclusion, implanted profoundly deaf children who have received their implants before beginning school have the same profile of educational placement as aided severely deaf children rather than aided profoundly deaf children of the same age in the UK. This is likely to have significant implications for the future management of profoundly deaf children and to influence future planning of educational support services...|$|R

Results from the special education survey indicated that type of disability, geographical location and controlling authority were associated with transition to mainstream education. Findings from the action research study suggest that supportive school leadership and positive attitudes towards disability and inclusion contribute to greater mobilisation of supporting resources. However, limitations in facilities and resources currently pose barriers which prevent inclusion for all students with disabilities.

As a result of public funding of Catholic high schools, by 1988, the Tabor Park property was ceded to the Metropolitan Separate School Board (later the Toronto Catholic District School Board) and was reopened as Jean Vanier to serve the rest of Scarborough. In that case, it was established to relive overcrowding at Mary Ward and Newman.|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{we provide}} {{specific}} {{examples of the}} educational promises and problems that arise as multiliteracies pedagogical initiatives encounter conventional institutional beliefs and practices in <b>mainstream</b> <b>schooling.</b> This paper documents and characterizes {{the ways in which}} two specific digital learning initiatives were played out in two distinctive traditional schooling contexts, as experienced by two different student groups: one comprising an elite mainstream and the other an excluded minority. By learning from the instructive complications that arose out of attempts by innovative and well-meaning educators to provide students with more relevant learning experiences than currently exist in <b>mainstream</b> <b>schooling,</b> this paper contributes fresh perspectives and more nuanced understandings of how diverse learners and their teachers negotiate the opportunities and challenges of the New London Group's vision of a multiliteracies approach to literacy and learning. We conclude by arguing that, where multiliteracies are understood as “garnish” to the “pedagogical roast” of traditional code-based and print-based academic literacies, they will continue to work on the sidelines of <b>mainstream</b> <b>schooling</b> and be seen only as either useful extensions or helpful interventions for high-performing and at-risk students respectively...|$|E
40|$|We {{compared}} the goals, reputations and behaviours of three groups: African adolescents from refugee backgrounds in Australian Intensive English Centres (IEC), African adolescents who have transitioned from an IEC into <b>mainstream</b> <b>schooling,</b> and Australian mainstream adolescents. We posit {{that the need}} for African adolescents from refugee backgrounds to identify with the dominant social group within the IEC and mainstream settings {{is an important factor in}} the goals they set, the reputations they choose, and the manner in which they pursue them. To this end, we conducted a cross sectional comparison through Reputation Enhancing Goals Theory, an approach congruent with sociocultural adaptation. Using multivariate techniques we found African adolescents in the IEC context set academic goals associated with a conforming reputation, whereas African adolescents in <b>mainstream</b> <b>schooling</b> set social goals associated with a non-conforming reputation. Australian mainstream students had an equal split between academic and social goals and conforming/non-conforming reputations. Each of the three groups indulged in behaviours congruent with the goals they set and reputation sought. A series of separate multiple-mediation models revealed significant indirect effects on a number of variables via School Connectedness, Control over most important goal, and to a lesser extent Goals. It appears African adolescents in <b>mainstream</b> <b>schooling</b> are attempting to adapt to another dominant culture (i. e., mainstream peers) on transitioning from the IEC, but they face confusion about who they are and who they wish to be. The implications for adolescents from African refuge backgrounds is, that while placing them in IECs for up to two years to help them settle into the education system is laudable, further support is needed when they transition to <b>mainstream</b> <b>schooling...</b>|$|E
