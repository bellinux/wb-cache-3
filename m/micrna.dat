50|$|Antisense RNA (asRNA) is a {{single-stranded}} RNA that is complementary to {{a messenger}} RNA (mRNA) strand transcribed within a cell. Some authors {{have used the}} term <b>micRNA</b> (mRNA-interfering complementary RNA) to refer to these RNAs {{but it is not}} widely used.|$|E
40|$|The {{expression}} of the genes for the major outer membrane proteins OmpF and OmpC are osmoregulated. The ompC locus {{was found to be}} transcribed bidirectionally under conditions of high osmolarity and a 174 -base transcript encoded upstream of ompC was found to inhibit the OmpF production and to substantially reduce the amount of the ompF mRNA. This RNA [mRNA-interfering complementary RNA (<b>micRNA)</b> ] has a long sequence that is complementary to the 5 ' end region of the ompF mRNA. We propose that the <b>micRNA</b> inhibits the translation of the ompF mRNA by hybridizing with it. This RNA interaction may cause premature termination of the transcription of the ompF gene or destabilization of the ompF mRNA or both...|$|E
40|$|Creation of an {{artificial}} mRNA-interfering complementary RNA (<b>micRNA)</b> immune system, utilizing anti-sense RNAs to inhibit viral gene expression, {{has been shown}} to be an effective way to prevent viral infection. In the RNA coliphage SP, the gene for the maturation protein was found to be the best target for this type of immune system; mRNA-interfering complementary RNAs specific to the genes for coat protein and replicase were less effective in preventing infection. The greatest inhibitory effect was observed with a 240 -base sequence encompassing the 24 -base noncoding region of the maturation gene plus the 216 -base coding sequence. Significantly, even a 19 -base sequence covering only the Shine-Dalgarno sequence (ribosome-binding region) without the coding region exerted a strong inhibitory effect on phage proliferation. In contrast to the highly specific action against phage SP exhibited by the longer mRNA-interfering complementary RNA, the specificity with the shorter mRNA-interfering complementary RNA was broadened to phages Q beta and GA as well as SP, all of which are classified in the different groups of RNA coliphages. Therefore, this type of anti-viral reagent may be designed to have a particular breadth of specificity, thus increasing its value in various research and possibly clinical applications...|$|E
