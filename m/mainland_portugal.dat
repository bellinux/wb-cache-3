25|$|As Muslims {{and other}} peoples {{constantly}} attacked Portuguese fleets in India, and because India {{was so far}} from <b>mainland</b> <b>Portugal,</b> it was extremely difficult for John III to secure Portuguese dominion in this area. A viceroy (or Governor-General with extensive powers) was nominated, {{but this was not}} enough to defend the Portuguese possessions in India. The Portuguese started by creating feitorias – commercial strongholds in Cochin, Cannanore, Coulão, Cranganore and Tanor – with the initial objective of establishing just a commercial dominion in the region.|$|E

It includes <b>mainland</b> <b>Portugal's</b> highest point at 1993 m above mean sea level (although the summit of Mount Pico in the Portuguese Azores islands is higher). This point is not a distinctive mountain summit, but rather the highest point in a plateau, being known as Torre ("Tower" [...] in English). Torre is an unusual summit in that it is accessible by a paved road. The peak has a topographic prominence of 1204 m and its parent peak is Pico Almanzor, in Spain.|$|R
25|$|In 1968, a {{rearmament}} {{study by}} the Air Force perceived {{the need for a}} new fighter capable of reaching Mach 2 in horizontal flight and a rate of climb that allowed it to reach 40,000ft in less than five minutes. The study also gave preference to twin-engine aircraft and specified the armament capacity and the capability to operate in hot environments, in addition to being capable of flying directly from <b>mainland</b> <b>Portugal</b> to Sal, Cape Verde. The preferred contenders at the time were the Dassault Mirage III, Dassault Mirage 5, Northrop F-5A, and McDonnell-Douglas F-4C Phantom II.|$|E
25|$|Moreover, {{the club}} publishes the weekly {{newspaper}} O Benfica each Friday, since 28 November 1942. It contains information about {{everything in the}} club, mostly news.

25|$|Nonetheless, it {{was only}} in 1971 that the Portuguese {{government}} gave priority to the procurement of new fighters and approved a new rearmament plan for the purchase of 64 fighters, 28 of which would be for the defense of <b>mainland</b> <b>Portugal</b> and 36 to be deployed overseas. This plan called for an initial order of 30 aircraft (27 single-seat and three twin-seat). At the time Portugal was under a United Nations arms embargo and the United States was against the Portuguese colonial war and Portugal's presence in Africa, having even previously put limitations on the use of Portuguese F-86F Sabre fighters in Africa. Meanwhile, France saw a Portuguese presence in Africa as coinciding with its own interests and had become, between 1964 and 1971, in the largest supplier of weapons to Portugal. As such, the Dassault Mirage was seen as the best option.|$|E

25|$|The {{assembly}} consisted {{at first}} of 250 members, but the constitutional reforms of 1989 reduced its number to between 180 and 230. Members are elected by popular vote for legislative terms {{of four years}} from the country's twenty-two constituencies (eighteen in <b>mainland</b> <b>Portugal</b> corresponding to each district, one for each autonomous regions, Azores (Portuguese: Açores) and Madeira, one for Portuguese living in Europe and a last one for those living {{in the rest of}} the world. Except for the constituencies for Portuguese living abroad, which are fixed at two members each, the number of voters registered in a constituency determines the number of its members in the assembly, using the D'Hondt method of proportional representation. Constituencies vary greatly in size; from as large as the district of Lisbon, which returns 47 representatives, to as small as the district of Portalegre, which elects just two.|$|E
25|$|However, {{by the end}} of the 19th {{century the}} {{illiteracy}} rate was over 80 percent and higher education was reserved for a small percentage of the population. 68.1 percent of Portugal's population was still classified as illiterate by the 1930 census. Portugal's literacy rate by the 1940s and early 1950s was low for North American and Western European standards at the time. From the 1960s, the country made public education available for all children between the ages of six and twelve, expanded a robust network of industrial and commercial technical schools aimed at intermediate education of future skilled workers (ensino médio), recognized the Portuguese Catholic University in 1971, and by 1973 a wave of new state-run universities were founded across <b>mainland</b> <b>Portugal</b> (the Minho University, the New University of Lisbon, the University of Évora, and the University of Aveiro - Veiga Simão was the Minister in charge for education by then).|$|E
25|$|The 1497 English {{expedition}} led by Italian Venetian John Cabot (Giovanni Caboto) was {{the first}} of a series of French and English missions exploring North America. Spain put limited efforts into exploring the northern part of the Americas, as its resources were concentrated in Central and South America where more wealth had been found. These expeditions were hoping to find an oceanic Northwest Passage to Asian trade. This was never discovered, but other possibilities were found, and in the early 17th century colonists from a number of Northern European states began to settle on the east coast of North America. In 1520–1521 the Portuguese João Álvares Fagundes, accompanied by couples of <b>mainland</b> <b>Portugal</b> and the Azores, explored Newfoundland and Nova Scotia (possibly reaching the Bay of Fundy on the Minas Basin), and established a fishing colony on the Cape Breton Island, that would last until at least the 1570s or near the end of the century.|$|E

25|$|Brazilian science {{effectively}} {{began in}} {{the first decades of}} the 19th century, when the Portuguese royal family, headed by D. João VI, arrived in Rio de Janeiro, escaping from the Napoleon's army invasion of Portugal in 1807. Like almost all territories and regions of the New World, Brazil was a Portuguese colony, without universities, and a few cultural and scientific organizations. The former American colonies of the Spanish Empire, although having a largely illiterate population like Brazil, Portugal and Spain, had, however, a number of universities since the 16th century. This may have been a deliberate policy of the Portuguese colonial power, because they feared that the appearance of educated Brazilian classes would boost nationalism and aspirations toward political independence, as it had happened in the United States and several Latin American former Spanish colonies. However, throughout the centuries of Portuguese rule, Brazilian students were allowed and even encouraged to enroll at higher education in <b>mainland</b> <b>Portugal.</b> In addition, mainland Portugal's population at the time was also largely illiterate and had for most of those period a single university, the University of Coimbra, which educated Portuguese people from all the Empire, including from the colony of Brazil.|$|E
25|$|By 1900, Hudson's {{population}} reached about 7,500 residents, and {{the town}} had built a power plant, so some houses were wired for electricity. Electric trolley lines were built that connected Hudson with the towns of Leominster, Concord, and Marlborough. The factories in town continued to grow, attracting immigrants from England, Germany, Portugal, Lithuania, Poland, Greece, Albania, and Italy. These immigrants usually lived in boarding houses near their places of employment. By 1928, 19 languages were spoken by the workers of the Firestone-Apsley Rubber Company. Today, the majority of Hudson residents are of Irish or Portuguese descent, with lesser populations of Italian, French, English, Scots-Irish, and Greek descent. About one-third of Hudson residents are Portuguese or are of Portuguese descent. Most people of Portuguese descent in Hudson are from the Azorean island of Santa Maria, with a smaller amount from the island of São Miguel or from the Trás-os-Montes region of <b>mainland</b> <b>Portugal.</b> The Portuguese community in Hudson maintains the Hudson Portuguese Club, who, in 2001, rebuilt a state-of-the-art clubhouse. The Hudson Portuguese Club {{was established in the}} mid-1910s and has outlived several other ethnic clubs, such as the town's long-gone Italian Club. Recent immigrants to Hudson arrive mainly from Mexico, Central America, Brazil, and other South American countries, as well as Asia, and Europe.|$|E

40|$|Copyright © 2002 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved. Airborne {{particulate}} matter {{plays an important}} role in the Earth's energy balance. One of the main reasons is that the real size of a significant number of the particles, mainly those of anthropogenic origin, is similar to the wavelength of visible light. Knowledge of the composition of such particles, as well as their dynamics and trajectories in the atmosphere is therefore very important. In the period from 23 February to 22 March 2000, a movement of airborne {{particulate matter}} going over Europe and towards Azores was identified based on satellite observation.
