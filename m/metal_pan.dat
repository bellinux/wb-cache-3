25|$|It is {{possible}} for metal objects to be microwave-oven compatible, although experimentation by users is not encouraged. Microwaving an individual smooth metal object without pointed ends, for example, a spoon or shallow <b>metal</b> <b>pan,</b> usually does not produce sparking. Thick metal wire racks {{can be part of}} the interior design in microwave ovens (see illustration). In a similar way, the interior wall plates with perforating holes which allow light and air into the oven, and allow interior-viewing through the oven door, are all made of conductive metal formed in a safe shape.|$|E
25|$|The rear carpark {{stands behind}} the rear podium, {{accessed}} from {{the lowest level}} of the building (B3) and from Wedd Street at the rear. It is one-storey with a flat, steel-framed roof clad with <b>metal</b> <b>pan</b> and rib sheeting, pierced by large, rhythmic openings to the sky. A decorative lattice wall of painted concrete breezeblocks lines the Wedd Street boundary, screening the car park. Internally, the former functions of the building are clearly defined, with public entry and reception in the front portico; offices in the tower; vertical circulation, toilets, and other shared facilities in the core; offices and a semi-enclosed carpark in the rear podium; and car parks and store rooms in the rear car park.|$|E

25|$|The beer is {{generally}} brewed from a grist containing approximately 60–70% barley malt and 30–40% unmalted wheat. The wort is cooled overnight in a shallow, flat <b>metal</b> <b>pan</b> called a coolship {{where it is}} left exposed to the open air so microorganisms may inoculate the wort. While this cooling method of open air exposure is a critical feature of the style, the key yeasts and bacteria that perform the fermentation reside within the breweries' timber fermenting vessels. Over eighty microorganisms {{have been identified in}} lambic beer, the most significant being Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Saccharomyces pastorianus and Brettanomyces bruxellensis. The process {{is generally}} only possible between October and May as in the summer months there are too many unfavourable organisms in the air that could spoil the beer.|$|E
2500|$|During the series, Sachs {{was seriously}} injured twice. Cleese {{describes}} using a real <b>metal</b> <b>pan</b> to knock Manuel unconscious in [...] "The Wedding Party", although {{he would have}} preferred to use a rubber one. The original producer/director, John Howard Davies, explains that he made Basil use a metal one and that he was responsible for most of the violence on the show, which he felt was essential to the type of comical farce they were creating. Later, when Sachs's clothes were treated to give off smoke after he escapes the burning kitchen in [...] "The Germans", the corrosive chemicals ate through them and gave Sachs severe burns.|$|E
2500|$|The {{tower is}} the major {{component}} of the building, comprising 14 levels (B3 to L10) and a rooftop plant room and caretaker's flat (L11). The tower is a tall, narrow, rectangular block with a concealed timber-framed hipped roof clad with <b>metal</b> <b>pan</b> and rib sheeting. It is oriented with its long sides (the front and rear) facing north and south. These elevations are highly glazed with an external grid of white-painted, concrete sun hoods forming a shading [...] "egg crate". The hoods on the northern side project further than the south. The windows are large, double glazed aluminium framed casements and have spandrel panels inset with a chunky, white quartz aggregate. The window hardware {{has been removed from}} the sashes. The side (eastern and western) elevations are painted concrete, finely articulated with off-form-patterned panels. Largely windowless in comparison to the north and south, the eastern and western elevations have four columns of small, square aluminium-framed windows with opaque glass.|$|E

50|$|Salt pans are shallow open, often <b>metal,</b> <b>pans</b> used to {{evaporate}} brine {{for the production}} of salts. They are usually found close to the source of the salt. For example, pans used in the solar evaporation of salt from sea water are usually found on the coast, while those used to extract salt from solution-mined brine will be found near to the brine shaft. In this case, extra heat is often provided by lighting fires underneath.|$|R

5000|$|An unblech, or K'Deira Blech (lit. [...] "pot blech", {{commonly}} referred to as [...] "water blech"), is also used to heat up pre-cooked food on the Sabbath, but utilizes different halakhic mechanisms from a standard blech. An unblech consists of a shallow <b>metal</b> <b>pan</b> filled with hot water and covered by another <b>metal</b> <b>pan,</b> and thus is akin to a pot of warm food for halakhic purposes. As such, it may be more flexible than a standard blech for halachic purposes. However, the temperature of an unblech is limited by the boiling point of water and is not as hot as a typical blech.|$|E
40|$|Research on the {{efficiency}} of silicone bakeware is limited. Manufacturers claim that silicone bakeware is nonstick, has easy product release and even heat distribution. This study attempted to replicate consumer baking conditions through a comparison of muffins baked in silicone pans to muffins baked in nonstick, anodized aluminum dark-colored <b>metal</b> <b>pans</b> (‘nonsilicone’). Using a consumer corn-muffin mix, structured baking procedures and controlled tests were performed, such as measures of the top surface browning, texture, water activity and heat transfer coefficient of the pans. The results of the tests indicated that silicone muffin pans did not produce a better product; rather, they were moister, had greater volume, with top-crust texture and color significantly less than muffins baked in nonsilicone muffin pans...|$|R
5000|$|<b>Metal</b> <b>pans</b> {{filled with}} hot coals {{were used for}} {{smoothing}} fabrics in China in the 1st century BC. From the 17th century, sadirons or sad irons (from Middle English [...] "sad" [...] meaning of [...] "solid", used in modern English through the 1800s) began to be used. They were thick slabs of cast iron, delta-shaped and with a handle, heated in a fire or on a stove. These were also called flat irons. A later design consisted of an iron box which could be filled with hot coals, {{which had to be}} periodically aerated by attaching a bellows. In Kerala in India, burning coconut shells were used instead of charcoal, as they have a similar heating capacity. This method is still in use as a backup device, since power outages are frequent. Other box irons had heated metal inserts instead of hot coals.|$|R
5|$|Around {{the time}} of the American Civil War, syrup makers started using large, flat sheet <b>metal</b> <b>pans</b> as they were more {{efficient}} for boiling than heavy, rounded iron kettles, because of a greater surface area for evaporation. Around this time, cane sugar replaced maple sugar as the dominant sweetener in the US; as a result, producers focused marketing efforts on maple syrup. The first evaporator, used to heat and concentrate sap, was patented in 1858. In 1872, an evaporator was developed that featured two <b>pans</b> and a <b>metal</b> arch or firebox, which greatly decreased boiling time. Around 1900, producers bent the tin that formed the bottom of a pan into a series of flues, which increased the heated surface area of the pan and again decreased boiling time. Some producers also added a finishing pan, a separate batch evaporator, as a final stage in the evaporation process.|$|R

40|$|This {{study was}} {{performed}} {{to determine whether the}} particle size of the starting collagen powder or the material of molds used during freeze-drying had effects on the scaffold pore structure. Collagen particles were separated by size prior to slurry making using a sieve with 1000 [mu]m openings, and scaffolds were made using both <b>metal</b> <b>pans</b> and polysulfone trays, two commonly used molds. The mean and variation of pore diameter and interconnectivity of freeze-dried scaffolds were compared to determine the relationship between particle size or mold material and the resulting pore diameter, for a specific same freeze-drying condition (viz., temperature). Knowing these relationships will permit a better control of pore size during fabrication, allowing researchers to design scaffolds with greater predictability and specificity. by Jenny K. Chan.

50|$|Two urns reside on {{the south}} side of the district, between Jackson Place and Madison Place. They each stand at 5 feet tall by 4 feet wide, and are made of bronze with granite bases. The sides of the urns are {{decorated}} with classical female figures. The urns were part of the original park plan as designed by Andrew Jackson Downing in 1852. They may have been designed by Downing, or his assistant Calvert Vaux. The urns were cast in a New York foundry at the orders of George M. Robeson, who was Secretary of the United States Navy at the time. The urns were originally placed on granite bases in the center of two small flower beds to the east and west sides of the Andrew Jackson statue. In 1879, they were fitted with <b>metal</b> <b>pans</b> which allowed them to be used as flower pots. The park was redesigned in 1936, and the urns were moved to their current location.|$|R
30|$|The {{formulation}} {{aimed for}} products {{that had an}} energy distribution of carbohydrate, protein, and fat at 60, 15 and 25  kcal/ 100  kcal, respectively. Their protein qualities should be comparable to requirements set in the latest WHO technical report (World Health Organization 2007). Energies from saturated fatty acid and free sugar were less than 8 % and 10 %, respectively (World Health Organization 2002 b). The carbohydrate sources should be low on the glycemic index. The product prototypes included: (i) flake snack, (ii) instant beverage, and (iii) instant soup. All ingredients, except for rice bran oil, sugar, and acesulfame K, were analyzed for protein, fat, carbohydratecontents and amino acid profile. As carbohydrate sources, rice flour, brown rice flour, and mung bean starch were cooked on electric double-sided flat <b>metal</b> <b>pans</b> in order to simulate cooking with a drum dryer, and then used in the in-vitro carbohydrate digestibility test. To combine data from the analyses and nutrient data base (Puwasatien et al. 1999), the formulation was performed by using the mass-balance equation.|$|R
