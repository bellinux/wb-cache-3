25|$|A {{variety of}} techniques, most notably narrow {{correlator}} spacing, {{have been developed}} to mitigate <b>multipath</b> errors. For long delay <b>multipath,</b> the receiver itself can recognize the wayward signal and discard it. To address shorter delay <b>multipath</b> from the signal reflecting off the ground, specialized antennas (e.g., a choke ring antenna) may be used to reduce the signal power as received by the antenna. Short delay reflections are harder to filter out because they interfere with the true signal, causing effects almost indistinguishable from routine fluctuations in atmospheric delay.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the major}} {{benefits}} provided by COFDM is in rendering radio broadcasts relatively immune to <b>multipath</b> distortion and signal fading due to atmospheric conditions or passing aircraft. Proponents of COFDM argue it resists <b>multipath</b> far better than 8VSB. Early 8VSB DTV (digital television) receivers often had difficulty receiving a signal. Also, COFDM allows single-frequency networks, which is not possible with 8VSB.|$|E

Further, we bring out the role of <b>multipaths</b> (or images) in reducing the error in the localization.

In such a configuration, the amplitudes of the <b>multipaths</b> can be numerically or analytically calculated, whereas their phases are modelled as uniformly distributed. A probabilistic formulation of the VOR error that overestimates its variance is introduced to obtain the quantiles. The method is useful to obtain probabilities of occurrence of large VOR errors for multiple configurations and in a short computation time. Examples with wind farms are presented...|$|R
40|$|The {{principal}} difficultly {{in tracking}} {{in an urban}} terrain {{is the presence of}} <b>multipaths.</b> However by using proper modelling and signal processing techniques these <b>multipaths</b> can be used favourably. In this paper we consider a more robust model of the urban terrain by not assuming exact wall locations but rather allowing for small deviations. This is achieved by introducing a random phase shift to the radar equation.

25|$|A simple example: If one sends {{a million}} symbols per second using {{conventional}} single-carrier modulation over a wireless channel, then {{the duration of}} each symbol would be one microsecond or less. This imposes severe constraints on synchronization and necessitates the removal of <b>multipath</b> interference. If the same million symbols per second are spread among one thousand sub-channels, the duration of each symbol can be longer {{by a factor of}} a thousand (i.e., one millisecond) for orthogonality with approximately the same bandwidth. Assume that a guard interval of 1/8 of the symbol length is inserted between each symbol. Intersymbol interference can be avoided if the <b>multipath</b> time-spreading (the time between the reception of the first and the last echo) is shorter than the guard interval (i.e., 125 microseconds). This corresponds to a maximum difference of 37.5 kilometers between the lengths of the paths.|$|E
25|$|Precoding is multi-stream beamforming, in {{the narrowest}} definition. In more general terms, it is {{considered}} to be all spatial processing that occurs at the transmitter. In (single-stream) beamforming, the same signal is emitted from each of the transmit antennas with appropriate phase and gain weighting such that the signal power is maximized at the receiver input. The benefits of beamforming are to increase the received signal gain – by making signals emitted from different antennas add up constructively – and to reduce the <b>multipath</b> fading effect. In line-of-sight propagation, beamforming results in a well-defined directional pattern. However, conventional beams are not a good analogy in cellular networks, which are mainly characterized by <b>multipath</b> propagation. When the receiver has multiple antennas, the transmit beamforming cannot simultaneously maximize the signal level at all of the receive antennas, and precoding with multiple streams is often beneficial. Note that precoding requires knowledge of channel state information (CSI) at the transmitter and the receiver.|$|E

25|$|DAB is more {{efficient}} in its use of spectrum than analogue FM radio, and thus may offer more radio services for the same given bandwidth. DAB is more robust with regard to noise and <b>multipath</b> fading for mobile listening, since DAB reception quality first degrades rapidly when the signal strength falls below a critical threshold, whereas FM reception quality degrades slowly with the decreasing signal.|$|E
25|$|The DVB-T {{standard}} {{is not used}} for terrestrial digital television in North America. Instead, the ATSC standard calls for 8VSB modulation, which has similar characteristics to the vestigial sideband modulation used for analog television. This provides considerably more immunity to interference, but is not immune— as DVB-T is— to <b>multipath</b> distortion and also does not provide for single-frequency network operation (which is in any case not relevant in the United States).|$|E
25|$|Suitable and {{manageable}} {{models are}} needed for the propagation of electromagnetic signals (or waves) through various media, such as air, taking into account <b>multipath</b> propagation (due to reflection, refraction, diffraction and dispersion) caused by signals colliding with obstacles such as buildings. The propagation model is a building block of the stochastic geometry wireless network model. A common approach is to consider propagation models with two separate parts consisting of the random and deterministic (or non-random) components of signal propagation.|$|E
40|$|Abstract — RAKE {{receiver}} {{is widely}} used in wideband {{code division multiple access}} (W-CDMA) system to combat the <b>multipaths</b> fading. RAKE receiver can co-phase the <b>multipaths</b> signals and add these signals to form the coherent output. Combined the spatial with temporal diversity features, RAKE receiver can be generalized into two dimensional and is expected to have further performance improvement when the channel estimation is perfect. In this paper, we will propose an analytical smart two dimensional RAKE receiver to choose the receiving antenna number and finger number dynamically under imperfect channel estimation. Experimental measured examples are presented to analyze the performance improvement of the proposed method...|$|R

25|$|When a {{receiver}} receives {{a signal that}} has been transmitted from the different transmitters {{that are part of}} an SFN, the signals from the different transmitters will typically have different delays, but to OFDM they will appear to simply be different <b>multipaths</b> of the same signal. Reception difficulties can arise, however, when the relative delay of <b>multipaths</b> exceeds the OFDM guard interval duration, and there are frequent reports of reception difficulties due to this issue when there is a lift, such as when there's high pressure, due to signals travelling farther than usual, and thus the signals are likely to arrive with a relative delay that is greater than the OFDM guard interval.|$|R
25|$|One key {{principle}} of OFDM {{is that since}} low symbol rate modulation schemes (i.e., where the symbols are relatively long compared to the channel time characteristics) suffer less from intersymbol interference caused by <b>multipath</b> propagation, it is advantageous to transmit a number of low-rate streams in parallel instead of a single high-rate stream. Since the duration of each symbol is long, it is feasible to insert a guard interval between the OFDM symbols, thus eliminating the intersymbol interference.|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} {{objectives of}} converting to digital transmission were to enable higher fidelity, more stations and more resistance to noise, co-channel interference and <b>multipath</b> than in analogue FM radio. However, the leading countries in implementing DAB on stereo radio stations use compression {{to such a}} degree that it produces lower sound quality than that received from non-mobile FM broadcasts. This is because of the bit rate levels being too low for the MPEG Layer 2 audio codec to provide high fidelity audio quality.|$|E
25|$|The {{effects of}} frequency-selective channel conditions, for example fading caused by <b>multipath</b> propagation, can be {{considered}} as constant (flat) over an OFDM sub-channel if the sub-channel is sufficiently narrow-banded (i.e., if the number of sub-channels is sufficiently large). This makes frequency domain equalization possible at the receiver, which is far simpler than the time-domain equalization used in conventional single-carrier modulation. In OFDM, the equalizer only has to multiply each detected sub-carrier (each Fourier coefficient) in each OFDM symbol by a constant complex number, or a rarely changed value.|$|E
