Her boyfriend gets <b>mad</b> <b>and</b> then throws a vase at the wall while Spears goes into the bathroom, hurling something at the mirror. She begins to fill the bathtub and remove her clothes. After this, the video includes intercut scenes of a close-up of Spears singing in a white shirt {{in front of a}} bright white light. As she lies in the bathtub, a red string, a custom associated with Kabbalah is seen in her wrist. She touches her head and looks at her hand, realizing she is bleeding from the wound. According to Jennifer Vineyard of MTV, the blood in her hand is stigmata. She loses consciousness in the bathtub and drowns. Shortly after, her boyfriend finds her and tries to resuscitate her. Meanwhile, it is revealed that in the close-up scenes Spears is actually inside a hospital hallway. The video continues with scenes of her being carried into an ambulance and surrounded by photographers, as well as scenes of her being resuscitated by doctors in a hospital bed. The ghost of Spears in a white shirt, watches herself in the bed and walks into the next room, where a baby girl is born. Spears is then seen running away from the camera into the light. The music video ends with her rising from under the water, resting her head and smiling, suggesting the whole scene of her death was a dream or a morbid fantasy.|$|E

40|$|The basic helix-loop-helix-leucine zipper (bHLHZip) protein Max {{associates}} {{with members of}} the Myc family, {{as well as with the}} related proteins <b>Mad</b> (<b>Mad</b> 1) <b>and</b> Mxi 1. Whereas both Myc:Max and Mad:Max heterodimers bind related E-box sequences, Myc:Max activates transcription and promotes proliferation while Mad:Max represses transcription and suppresses Myc dependent transformation. Here we report the identification and characterization of two novel <b>Mad</b> 1 - <b>and</b> Mxi 1 -related proteins, <b>Mad</b> 3 <b>and</b> <b>Mad</b> 4. <b>Mad</b> 3 <b>and</b> <b>Mad</b> 4 interact with both Max and mSin 3 and repress transcription from a promoter containing CACGTG binding sites. Using a rat embryo fibroblast transformation assay, we show that both <b>Mad</b> 3 <b>and</b> <b>Mad</b> 4 inhibit c-Myc dependent cell transformation. An examination of the expression patterns of all mad genes during murine embryogenesis reveals that mad 1, <b>mad</b> 3 <b>and</b> <b>mad</b> 4 are expressed primarily in growth-arrested differentiating cells. mxi 1 is also expressed in differentiating cells, but is co-expressed with either c-myc, N-myc, or both in proliferating cells of the developing central nervous system and the epidermis. In the developing central nervous system and epidermis, downregulation of myc genes occurs concomitant with upregulation of mad family genes. These expression patterns, together with the demonstrated ability of Mad family proteins to interfere with the proliferation promoting activities of Myc, suggest that the regulated expression of Myc <b>and</b> <b>Mad</b> family proteins function in a concerted fashion to regulate cell growth in differentiating tissues...|$|R

25|$|The {{description}} of Nebuchadnezzar II in the Book of Daniel (2nd century BC) greatly influenced the medieval European concepts. Daniel 4 depicts God humbling the Babylonian king for his boastfulness; stricken <b>mad</b> <b>and</b> ejected from human society, he grows {{hair on his}} body and lives like a beast. This image was popular in medieval depictions of Nebuchadnezzar. Similarly, late medieval legends of Saint John Chrysostom (died 407) describe the saint's asceticism as making him so isolated and feral that hunters who capture him cannot tell if he is man or beast.|$|E

40|$|The spindle {{assembly}} checkpoint (SAC) {{is a key}} mechanism to regulate the timing of mitosis and ensure that chromosomes are correctly segregated to daughter cells. The recruitment of the <b>Mad</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>Mad</b> 2 proteins to the kinetochore is normally necessary for SAC activation. This recruitment is coordinated by the SAC kinase Mps 1, which phosphorylates residues at the kinetochore to facilitate binding of Bub 1, Bub 3, <b>Mad</b> 1, <b>and</b> <b>Mad</b> 2. There {{is evidence that the}} essential function of Mps 1 is to direct recruitment of Mad 1 / 2. To test this model, we have systematically recruited Mad 1, <b>Mad</b> 2, <b>and</b> Mps 1 to most proteins in the yeast kinetochore, and find that, while Mps 1 is sufficient for checkpoint activation, recruitment of either Mad 1 or Mad 2 is not. These data indicate an important role for Mps 1 phosphorylation in SAC activation, beyond the direct recruitment of <b>Mad</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>Mad</b> 2...|$|R
40|$|As a {{component}} of chromatin-modifying complexes with histone acetyltransferase (HAT) activity, TRRAP {{has been shown to}} be involved in various cellular processes including gene transcription and oncogenic transformation. Inactivation of Trrap, the murine ortholog of TRRAP, in mice revealed its function in development and cell cycle progression. However, the underlying mechanism is unknown. Here, we show that the loss of Trrap in mammalian cells leads to chromosome missegregation, mitotic exit failure and compromised mitotic checkpoint. These mitotic checkpoint defects are caused by defective Trrap-mediated transcription of the mitotic checkpoint proteins <b>Mad</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>Mad</b> 2. The mode of regulation by Trrap involves acetylation of histones H 4 and H 3 at the gene promoter of these mitotic players. Trrap associated with the HAT Tip 60 and PCAF at the <b>Mad</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>Mad</b> 2 promoters in a cell cycle-dependent manner and Trrap depletion abolished recruitment of these HATs. Finally, ectopic expression of <b>Mad</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>Mad</b> 2 fully restores the mitotic checkpoint in Trrap-deficient cells. These results demonstrate that Trrap controls the mitotic checkpoint integrity by specifically regulating <b>Mad</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>Mad</b> 2 genes...|$|R
