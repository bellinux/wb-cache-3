40|$|In {{this work}} we present an {{analysis}} of the influence of the thermodynamic regime on the <b>monochromatic</b> <b>emissivity,</b> the radiative power loss and the radiative cooling rate for optically thin carbon plasmas over a wide range of electron temperature and density assuming steady state situations. Furthermore, we propose analytical expressions depending on the electron density and temperature for the average ionization and cooling rate based on polynomial fittings which are valid for the whole range of plasma conditions considered in this work...|$|E
40|$|A {{study of}} a parallel-plate system for thermophotovoltaic power {{production}} at moderate temperatures is reported. The impetus behind this analysis is the desire to apply systems of this type in microdevices where large temperature differences {{would be difficult to}} sustain. The emphasis is on the combination of the photovoltaic (PV) modeling (which has been relatively well documented in the literature) with the thermal transport aspects, particularly the radiative properties, which have been addressed less fully. Of the latter, the <b>monochromatic</b> <b>emissivity</b> is defined in detail. In 0. 8 Ga 0. 2 As is considered as the basic PV material, and two emitter surface treatments are assumed in the analysis including the gray approximation and both an idealistic and a realistic selective surface. Estimates of both the power generation and the power generation efficiency are determined. As expected for temperature differences of these magnitudes, the energy production is shown to be quite small...|$|E
40|$|A {{systematic}} {{formulation of}} various radiative transfer parameterizations is presented, including the absorption approximation (AA), d-two-stream approximation (D 2 S), d-four-stream approximation (D 4 S), and d-two- and four-stream combination approximation (D 2 / 4 S), in a consistent manner for thermal infrared flux calculations. The D 2 / 4 S scheme uses a source function from the d-two-stream approximation and evaluates intensities in the four-stream directions. A {{wide range of}} accuracy checks for <b>monochromatic</b> <b>emissivity</b> of a homogeneous layer and broadband heating rates and fluxes in nonhomogeneous atmospheres is performed {{with respect to the}} ‘‘exact’’ results computed from the d- 128 -stream scheme for radiative transfer. The computer time required for the calculations using different radiative transfer parameterizations is compared. The results pertaining to the accuracy and efficiency of various radiative transfer approximations can be utilized to decide which approximate method is most appropriate for a particular application. In view of its overall high accuracy and computational economy, it is recommended that the D 2 / 4 S scheme is well suited for GCM and climate modeling applications. 1...|$|E
40|$|We {{present in}} this paper a {{numerical}} study of the validity limit of the geometrical optics approximation compared with a differential method which is established according to rigorous formalisms based on the electromagnetic theory. The precedent studies show that this method is adapted {{to the study of}} diffraction by periodic rough surfaces. We determine by two methods the emissivity of gold and tungsten for surfaces with a rectangular or sinusoidal profile, for a wavelength equal to 0. 55 microns. The <b>monochromatic</b> directional <b>emissivity</b> of these surfaces clearly depends on the angle of incidence, the surface profile, height, period {{and the nature of the}} material. We perform our calculations by a method of coupled wave analysis (CWA) and a geometric optics method (GOA). The latter method is theoretically valid only when the dimensions of the cavities are very large compared to the wavelength, while the CWA is theoretically correct whatever these dimensions. The main purpose of this work is to investigate the validity limit of GOA compared with CWA. The obtained results for a fixed height of the grating, allowed us to delimit the validity domain of the optic geometrical approximation for the treated cases. Finally, the agreement between the emissivity calculated by the differential method and that given on the basis of the homogenization theory is satisfactory when the period is much smaller than the wavelength...|$|R
40|$|Spectroscopic {{measurements}} {{were made on}} the primary zone flame of a constant speed, semi-closed cycle, and recuperated gas turbine. This was undertaken at various loads while introducing cooled exhaust gas into the combustor reactant stream as a diluent. Operating conditions included primary reaction zone equivalence ratios from 0. 42 to 0. 64 and reactant oxygen concentration from 15. 4 to 20. 7 % at an average combustion pressure of 34. 8 psia. The results demonstrated a power relationship between soot volume fraction and the oxygen concentration in the reactant gas mixture. Soot formation was reduced by {{an order of magnitude}} when oxygen concentration was reduced to 17. 5 %. Two predictive models, based on data regression analysis, were developed for soot temperature as a function of combustion pressure and oxygen concentration and for soot volume fraction, normalized to the maximum observed, as a function of equivalence ratio, oxygen concentration, soot temperature and combustion pressure. The models demonstrate a close agreement with data and predict both soot temperature and soot volume fraction will increase with primary zone oxygen concentration.
