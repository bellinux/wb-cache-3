5|$|After many failed {{attempts}} {{to steal the}} teddy bear, in desperation, <b>Mr.</b> <b>Burns</b> has Smithers literally beg Homer for the bear. Homer tells <b>Mr.</b> <b>Burns</b> that it is Maggie's now, and {{she is the only}} one that can return it. <b>Mr.</b> <b>Burns</b> decides to talk to Maggie and becomes deeply depressed and asks Maggie to look after his bear. Maggie, in an act of pity, lets the desperate <b>Mr.</b> <b>Burns</b> have the bear.|$|E
5|$|<b>Mr.</b> <b>Burns</b> sends hired goons to the Simpson {{house in}} order to take Homer back to Mr. Burns' Manor to negotiate. While <b>Mr.</b> <b>Burns</b> is setting the agenda for the discussion, Homer is struck by the urgent need to use the rest room. Homer asks <b>Mr.</b> <b>Burns</b> where the rest room is and {{immediately}} leaves, leading <b>Mr.</b> <b>Burns</b> to conclude that Homer is a tough negotiator who is unwilling to even hear him out. At a later union meeting, Homer tries to resign, tired of meeting with <b>Mr.</b> <b>Burns.</b> The union misunderstands his frustration, and the members nearly unanimously decide to strike. <b>Mr.</b> <b>Burns</b> is undeterred by the strike and tries several methods of breaking it up, but fails. On an edition of Kent Brockman's talk show Smartline, <b>Mr.</b> <b>Burns</b> is allowed an opening tirade and he threatens dire events if the strike is not concluded.|$|E
5|$|<b>Mr.</b> <b>Burns</b> then reveals to Smithers his grandest scheme: the {{construction}} of a giant, movable disc that will permanently block out the sun in Springfield, forcing the residents to continuously use the electricity from his power plant. A horrified Smithers finally stands up to <b>Mr.</b> <b>Burns,</b> insisting that he has gone too far; <b>Mr.</b> <b>Burns</b> fires him in response.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Mrs.</b> <b>Burns</b> {{lemon basil}} {{is named after}} Janet Burns, an organic {{gardener}} in Carlsbad, New Mexico who introduced it in 1939; she obtained the seeds from a neighbor who had been growing it since the 1920s. Although <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Burns</b> lemon basil is considered a type of [...] "lemon basil", it is not closely related to lemon basil. <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Burns</b> (O. basilicum var. citriodora) is a variety of sweet basil (O. basilicum). Lemon basil (O. × citriodorum), in contrast, is a hybrid between sweet basil and hoary basil (O. americanum), also known as African basil (not {{to be confused with}} O. gratissimum).|$|R
50|$|Warned by {{a friend}} about Russell's possessive mother, {{including}} her way of feigning a heart condition, Hilda declines a $50,000 bribe from <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Burns</b> to leave town. She leaves the old woman slumped {{in a chair and}} proceeds to the church for the wedding. <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Burns</b> was not pretending this time, however, and has died.|$|R
5|$|Mr. Burns's {{political}} advisers {{break the}} news to <b>Mr.</b> <b>Burns</b> that he is greatly despised by many people while Bailey is beloved by all. To compensate for this, they force <b>Mr.</b> <b>Burns</b> to try being friendly and even smile. <b>Mr.</b> <b>Burns</b> makes a television commercial discussing Blinky with an actor portraying Charles Darwin, who claims Blinky is an evolutionary step and not a mutated fish. Combined with a promise to lower taxes and a smear campaign against Bailey, <b>Mr.</b> <b>Burns</b> ties {{with her in the}} polls. On the night before the election, Mr. Burns's advisers suggest that <b>Mr.</b> <b>Burns</b> have dinner at the home of a middle-class family as an opportunity to put himself in the lead. <b>Mr.</b> <b>Burns</b> scans his employees for the most average man he can find, and Homer is chosen.|$|E
5|$|Bart and Lisa {{go fishing}} {{downstream}} of the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant, and Springfield Shopper reporter Dave Shutton pulls {{up just as}} Bart catches a three-eyed fish, much to both the kids' and Shutton's surprise. The fish, nicknamed Blinky by the media, makes headlines around the state, and incumbent governor Mary Bailey calls in a government inspection team to investigate nuclear waste coming from the plant that could have caused the fish to mutate. After the inspection, the plant's owner, <b>Mr.</b> <b>Burns,</b> is presented {{with a list of}} 342 violations, which would cost $56 million to rectify. Distraught, <b>Mr.</b> <b>Burns</b> talks to plant employee Homer, who half-heartedly suggests <b>Mr.</b> <b>Burns</b> run for governor against Bailey so that he could change the standards and prevent the plant from being shut down. <b>Mr.</b> <b>Burns</b> instantly pounces on the idea.|$|E
5|$|In {{the third}} segment, <b>Mr.</b> <b>Burns</b> fires Homer for his laziness and incompetence. Looking for work, Homer answers a {{classified}} ad {{to become a}} grave digger. Meanwhile, <b>Mr.</b> <b>Burns</b> is nearing the completion of his giant robotic laborer, which he hopes will eventually replace weak-bodied human workers. The only remaining step is to implant a human brain into the machine's body. Searching a graveyard the following night, <b>Mr.</b> <b>Burns</b> mistakes Homer, snoring in an open grave, for a newly buried corpse and, despite signs that Homer may still be alive, removes Homer's brain with an ice cream scoop and places it in the robot. However, Robo-Homer is just as lazy and incompetent as he was as a human, using his X-ray vision to locate donuts. <b>Mr.</b> <b>Burns</b> declares the experiment a failure and, after restoring the brain to Homer's still-living body, kicks the robot, which topples over and crushes <b>Mr.</b> <b>Burns.</b> Afterward, he tells Smithers to get some surgical tools and ether.|$|E
50|$|<b>Mrs.</b> <b>Burns</b> {{lemon basil}} (Ocimum basilicum var. citriodora 'Mrs. Burns') is an {{heirloom}} cultivar of sweet basil (Ocimum basilicum) from New Mexico in the United States. Compared to lemon basil, {{which is a}} different species of basil (O. × citriodorum), in <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Burns</b> lemon basil the lemon flavor is more intense, the leaves are larger, and the plant itself is more robust.|$|R

5|$|<b>Mr.</b> <b>Burns</b> sits in {{his office}} {{awaiting}} the union leader, who mysteriously disappeared after promising {{to clean up the}} union, so that they can discuss the proposed union contract. While perusing the contract, <b>Mr.</b> <b>Burns</b> becomes disgusted with the union demands and reminisces about simpler times in which disgruntled workers were simply walled up in coke ovens. <b>Mr.</b> <b>Burns</b> then decides to take on the union, and revokes their dental plan.|$|E
5|$|To impress Jacqueline, Grampa {{takes her}} out dancing, {{but when he}} does, <b>Mr.</b> <b>Burns</b> steals her from him and breaks his heart. <b>Mr.</b> <b>Burns</b> {{declares}} {{that he is in}} love with Jacqueline, {{and they are going to}} get married, against Marge's interest. Meanwhile, Bart buys a $350 Itchy & Scratchy animation cel with one of Homer's credit cards. In order to pay Homer back, Bart blackmails <b>Mr.</b> <b>Burns</b> by threatening to ruin his suit before his date.|$|E
50|$|Since {{it belongs}} to the O. basilicum clade, <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Burns</b> lemon basil is {{tetraploid}} (2n = 4x = 48), with a monoploid number of 12.|$|R

50|$|<b>Mrs.</b> <b>Burns</b> {{lemon basil}} readily self-seeds, and, being from arid New Mexico, it tolerates heat and dryness well. It blooms {{late in the}} season and is slow to bolt. It is a tender {{perennial}} but is typically grown as an annual. Like many basils, it prefers fertile, well-drained soil and 6 to 8 hours of full sunlight per day. The flowers should be pinched to prevent the leaves from becoming bitter. <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Burns</b> lemon basil can be repeatedly harvested by taking a few leaves at a time and should be harvested periodically to encourage regrowth.|$|R
5|$|Bart {{explains}} that he knew Homer would probably change his mind, and decided to send the letter before that could happen. Homer desperately tries to prevent the letter from reaching <b>Mr.</b> <b>Burns,</b> but fails. <b>Mr.</b> <b>Burns</b> becomes furious and demands that Homer be beaten. However, Smithers calls off the beating {{on the grounds that}} is no way to thank the man who saved Mr. Burns' life, and instead convinces <b>Mr.</b> <b>Burns</b> to instead reward the Simpson family. The Simpsons receive an antique Xtapolapocetl, an Olmec head (a massive, Tiki-god-like affair) that Bart, the blood donor, likes, and which Homer hates.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, <b>Mr.</b> <b>Burns</b> learns of the school's oil and {{immediately}} decides {{that he must}} have it, even as Smithers voices his disapproval. After failing to convince Principal Skinner to give him the oil, <b>Mr.</b> <b>Burns</b> establishes a slant drilling operation and beats the school to tapping the oil well. The school is told they have no legal recourse, and Willie and Puente are laid off to cover the school's losses.|$|E
5|$|<b>Mr.</b> <b>Burns</b> and Smithers take a train back to Springfield after {{attending}} the annual Harvard-Yale football game. The train makes an unexpected stop {{and a man}} named Larry comes up to the train and tries to sell merchandise. He sees <b>Mr.</b> <b>Burns</b> and takes out an old picture {{of a man who}} looks similar and compares the two. Suddenly the train pulls away, leaving Larry behind. Meanwhile, the Simpson family are on their way home from visiting a cider mill and see Larry hitchhiking. After much discussion, the family picks up the hitchhiker. Larry asks the Simpsons about <b>Mr.</b> <b>Burns</b> and they agree to take Larry to his house. In Springfield, Larry visits Mr. Burns' estate and reveals that he is Burns' son.|$|E
50|$|<b>Mrs.</b> <b>Burns</b> {{lemon basil}} {{is well suited}} for teas, salads, soups, and vinegars. It is also {{excellent}} in desserts and baked goods, and it complements fish and chicken well.|$|R

60|$|Mose felt a {{warm glow}} around his heart as he trotted away beside Reynolds across the smooth sod. His {{affection for the}} Reynolds family was {{scarcely}} second to his boyish love for <b>Mr.</b> and <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Burns.</b>|$|R
5|$|<b>Mr.</b> <b>Burns</b> asks Homer to {{help him}} with a speech for a crisis {{shareholders}} meeting. Homer gives Smithers his last joint, and while Smithers is smoking it, Burns apparently drowns in his bathtub. For the meeting, Smithers and Homer make <b>Mr.</b> <b>Burns</b> into a marionette, and the movement of the marionette inadvertently gets Mr. Burns' heart working again. The meeting is a success, and another financial crisis at the power plant is avoided.|$|E
5|$|<b>Mr.</b> <b>Burns</b> {{attempts}} to seduce Marge, who {{tells him that}} she is married. He dismisses her, so she threatens a lawsuit and enlists the help of Lionel Hutz, who is completely unsuccessful and flees from Mr. Burns' army of real lawyers. <b>Mr.</b> <b>Burns</b> gives up after Homer defends Marge. The episode ends as Homer and Marge enjoy a private show performed by the captured Tom Jones, who secretly begs Marge to help him escape.|$|E
5|$|<b>Mr.</b> <b>Burns</b> {{demands for}} Maggie to be arrested, {{but he is}} {{dismissed}} by Wiggum, who says no jury would convict a baby for a crime. Marge also adds the shooting {{must have been an}} accident, considering Maggie, being an infant, is very unlikely to know how to operate a gun. In the final shot, Maggie is shown with shifty eyes, suggesting that she may have shot <b>Mr.</b> <b>Burns</b> deliberately.|$|E
6000|$|... "The boy is put upon," [...] <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Burns</b> always argued. [...] "A quieter, more peaceabler boy I never knew, {{except my}} own Jack. They're good, helpful boys, both of 'em, and I don't care what anybody says." ...|$|R
60|$|The Councills and the Burns {{families}} took dinner together. <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Burns,</b> fretful and worn, cuffed {{the children}} {{back from the}} table while bringing out her biscuit and roast chicken.

50|$|As {{a variety}} of O. basilicum, in <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Burns</b> lemon basil the calyx has five lobes, with a single-lobed {{posterior}} (upper) lip and a four-lobed anterior (bottom) lip. The posterior lip is decurrent on the tube. The throat of the calyx is open and bearded with a ring of hairs just below the mouth. The lateral lobes on the anterior lip are lanceolate and symmetrical. The tube of the corolla is dorsally gibbous at the midpoint at a point opposite of the appendage of the posterior stamen. <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Burns</b> lemon basil has four stamens, with an anterior pair near the corolla mouth and a posterior pair near the corolla base. The ovary is divided into four parts, which develop into single-seeded nutlets or mericarps. The nutlets produce copious mucilage when wet.|$|R
5|$|<b>Mr.</b> <b>Burns</b> {{looks from}} his balcony {{and talks about}} {{stealing}} candy from a baby.|$|E
5|$|The {{impending}} {{dinner with}} <b>Mr.</b> <b>Burns</b> divides the Simpson household. Homer pragmatically supports <b>Mr.</b> <b>Burns,</b> while Marge and Lisa oppose him. Before the dinner arrives, Mr. Burns's advisers prepare {{the family for}} the event, even giving them pre-written questions to ask in lieu of conversation. Lisa becomes disillusioned by it all, but Marge tells her not to worry. To everyone's surprise, Marge serves Blinky for dinner. <b>Mr.</b> <b>Burns</b> tries {{to act as if}} it does not bother him, but is not able to keep from spitting it out. The cameras flash as the bite flies through the air, {{and by the time the}} chunk hits the floor the press is gone and his governatorial campaign dissolves. Bailey wins the election and, despite <b>Mr.</b> <b>Burns</b> saying that Homer's dreams will be unfulfilled for as long as he is alive, the Simpson family happily get together again.|$|E
5|$|With {{the score}} tied and bases loaded {{with two outs}} {{in the bottom of}} the ninth inning, <b>Mr.</b> <b>Burns</b> elects to field a {{right-handed}} hitter against a left-handed pitcher and pinch hits Homer for Strawberry. Distracted by <b>Mr.</b> <b>Burns,</b> the first pitch hits Homer in the head, rendering him unconscious, but forcing in the winning run. The team wins the title and Homer, still unconscious, is paraded as a hero.|$|E
