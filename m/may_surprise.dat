5|$|Despite {{its size}} and gaudy coloration, this vulture is quite {{inconspicuous}} when it is perched in trees. While perched, it holds its head lowered and thrust forward. It is non-migratory and, unlike the turkey, lesser yellow-headed and American black vulture, it generally lives alone or in small family groups. Groups of up to 12 birds have been observed bathing and drinking in a pool above a waterfall in Belize. One or two birds generally descend to feed at a carcass, although occasionally up to ten or so may gather if there is significant amount of food. King vultures have lived up to 30 years in captivity, though their lifespan in the wild is unknown. This vulture uses urohidrosis, defecating on its legs, to lower its body temperature. Despite its bill and large size, it is relatively unaggressive at a kill. The king vulture lacks a voice box, although it can make low croaking noises and wheezing sounds in courtship, and bill-snapping noises when threatened. Its only natural predators are snakes, which will prey upon the vulture's eggs and young, and large cats such as jaguars, which <b>may</b> <b>surprise</b> and kill an adult vulture at a carcass.|$|E
5|$|How the ostensibly weak-swimming {{frilled shark}} captures active, {{fast-moving}} squid {{is a matter}} of speculation. One possibility is that it takes advantage of injured squid, or those that are exhausted and dying after spawning. Alternatively, it <b>may</b> <b>surprise</b> its prey by curving its body and, bracing itself with its posteriorly positioned fins, launching a quick strike forward {{in the manner of a}} snake. It may also be able to close its gill slits and create negative pressure to suck prey into its mouth. The many small, sharp, recurved teeth of the frilled shark are functionally similar to squid jigs and could easily snag the body or tentacles of a squid, particularly as they are rotated outwards when the jaws are protruded. Observations of captive frilled sharks swimming with their mouths open suggest that the small teeth, light against the dark mouth, may even fool squid into attacking and entangling themselves.|$|E
500|$|Critical {{reviews of}} Autobiography were mixed. People {{magazine}} {{considered it a}} [...] "passable debut" [...] and said that it showed Simpson was a [...] "credible talent in her own right"; Allmusic called it [...] "an unexpectedly strong debut". The Village Voice compared Autobiography favorably to Courtney Love's 2004 album, America's Sweetheart, referring particularly to Autobiographys [...] "Fruit Stripe bubblegrunge guitars and insanely chewy melodies and an ear-tickling production job." [...] It also praised Simpson's singing, saying that she [...] "can pack so much contradictory emotion into a single line—a single word—that the music can barely contain it." [...] According to Blender, all of the album's songs [...] "paint in huge strokes"; its review also regarded Simpson's vocals positively.E! Online also praised Simpson's singing and catchy tracks, saying that [...] "Ashlee Simpson still managed to piece together this collection of tracks that sound {{as if they were}} ripped right from the pages of her diary. Ashlee even makes you think twice about her semicharmed life. So, even if it doesn't wow you, Autobiography <b>may</b> <b>surprise</b> you." ...|$|E

5000|$|Linguistics {{may play}} a role in the {{formulation}} of surprise. The Language expectancy theory (LET) states that people develop norms and expectations concerning appropriate usage of a language in a given situation. [...] When norms or expectations of verbal language are violated <b>surprise</b> <b>may</b> occur. The EVT model supports that expectations can be violated verbally and this violation <b>may</b> cause a <b>surprise</b> within the individual. Expectations of verbal language that <b>may</b> lead to <b>surprise</b> <b>may</b> include but are not limited to, expletives, shouts, screams, and gasps.|$|R

500|$|In May 2007 Time {{magazine}} ran {{an article}} by James Poniewozik titled [...] "Is Shrek Bad for Kids?" [...] which considered the negative effects on children of being raised with fairy tale satires, instead of the original stories. Poniewozik mentioned Hoodwinked! writing, [...] "I thought Hoodwinked! {{and most of the}} Shrek series were hilarious... But even if you ultimately reject their messages, old-school fairy tales are part of our cultural vocabulary. There's something a little sad about kids growing up in a culture where their fairy tales come pre-satirized, the skepticism, critique and revision having been done for them by the mama birds of Hollywood." [...] Cory Edwards wrote into the magazine, expressing his similar sentiments and writing, [...] "As the writer-director of Hoodwinked, it <b>may</b> <b>surprise</b> you that I couldn't agree more with James Poniewozik's article. Even as I was making the film, I asked myself the same question: Are we parodying something that kids should have the chance to experience first, 'un-parodied?' We {{went to great lengths to}} distance our film from Shreks humor (and no, I don't think Shrek considers kids). I would hope that Hoodwinked and its sequels will be seen as trying to do something genuine with its characters, rather than look for the next joke at the expense of innocence. We ALL need the real folklore of fairytales, whether we admit it or not." ...|$|E

2500|$|This unusual feature enables {{what are}} called cryptic creams. A certain {{percentage}} of dark bay, seal brown, and black horses exhibit such subtle dilution of their coats as to be misregistered. In the study that mapped the cream gene, three horses registered as seal brown, dark bay or bay were actually smoky black and buckskin. This is one way by which the cream gene is transmitted through generations without being identified. Horses born palomino, buckskin, and smoky black, but also carry the gray gene, have a hair coat that turns white as they age and are usually registered as [...] "gray" [...] rather than as their birth color. [...] This is particularly a common occurrence in the Connemara breed. [...] Horses sold after turning fully gray <b>may</b> <b>surprise</b> breeders by producing golden or cream offspring.|$|E

2500|$|Sound effects: Standard {{responses}} to the caller. [...] These include vocalized sounds, hand claps and foot stomps. [...] Sound effects are generally well accepted, as they do not change either the timing or {{the execution of the}} step, although they <b>may</b> <b>surprise</b> and/or amuse newcomers to a club. [...] The sound effects often serve as a mnemonic device, in that dancers associate the execution of the step with the particular sounds. [...] A rhyming or punning word-play on the name of the call is common. [...] For example, the response [...] "Pink Lemonade" [...] mirrors rhythmically and rhymes with the call [...] "Triple Trade". [...] Since some dancers respond [...] "Boom!" [...] to the call [...] "Explode", the call [...] "Reverse Explode" [...] may elicit the response [...] "Moob!" [...] (that is, [...] "Boom" [...] reversed right-to-left).|$|E

British alternative rock band Coldplay, with whom Rihanna would later collaborate on their song [...] "Princess of China", covered [...] "We Found Love" [...] on October 27, 2011, during a performance at BBC Radio 1's Live Lounge. Jocelyn Vena of MTV News called the performance [...] "flawless", writing [...] "Lead singer Chris Martin's haunting vocals and the band's acoustic rendition, using drums, piano and guitar, play up {{the sadness of}} the track." [...] Jason Lipshutz of Billboard magazine {{also noted that the}} band used [...] "piano flourishes, a kick drum and a simple guitar lick to convey the song's romantic declaration", while making a ballad which was [...] "reminiscent of Bruno Mars emotional reworking of Katy Perry's 'California Gurls. Matthew Perpetua of Rolling Stone wrote: [...] "It <b>may</b> <b>surprise</b> that their rendition is actually pretty good. Whereas Rihanna's version is a thumping rave anthem, Chris Martin and company transform it into a lovely piano ballad nearly indistinguishable from many of their own songs." [...] A writer for The Hollywood Reporter said: [...] "Martin's vocals blend with the piano for a slightly softer take on the tragic love story." [...] On February 17, 2012, British singer Jessie J made a cover of the song on BBC Radio1's Live Lounge.|$|E
2500|$|A new Broadway revival began previews on March 31, 2003 {{and opened}} on May 1, 2003 at the Shubert Theatre. The {{director}} was Sam Mendes, with choreography by Jerry Mitchell and costumes and sets by Anthony Ward. Bernadette Peters {{played the role}} of Rose. The New York Times described Peters as [...] "a surefire box office draw who nonetheless <b>may</b> <b>surprise</b> some Gypsy aficionados...How will the ladylike Ms. Peters fit into the role of Rose, a part indelibly marked by its brassy, belting originator, Ethel Merman?...'One of the main reasons I wanted to do the piece was to cast someone as Rose that was closer to Rose as she really existed,' Mr. Mendes said. 'She was a tiny woman. And she was a charmer. And so is Bernadette.'" [...] Laurents had talked to Mendes ("Roughly five years ago" [...] according to The New York Times in 2003) about directing the revival, and Mendes said [...] "he was surprised by the idea of casting Ms. Peters as Rose". Laurents notes of his suggestions on this production are in his 2009 book Mainly on Directing 'Gypsy', 'West Side Story' and Other Musicals. In a 2004 interview Laurents said that Peters' portrayal of Rose was [...] "brilliant, original, totally unlike any of the others" [...] while criticizing Mendes for the [...] "physical production" [...] which Laurents said [...] "was misconceived and hurt the show more than people realized." [...] Gypsy had begun previews with a virtually bare stage, but by opening night this had been changed to a minimalist set. The cast featured John Dossett as Herbie, Tammy Blanchard as Louise, Kate Reinders as June and David Burtka as Tulsa. The production was nominated for four Tony Awards, including Best Revival of a Musical and Best Actress in a Musical.|$|E
