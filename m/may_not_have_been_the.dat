Arguing that there was little evidence for how the faith was born, he suggested that the city of Mecca <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> real birthplace of Muhammad and Islam, and– while not clearly disputing Muhammad's existence as a real historical figure– claimed that much of the Islamic origin story was later developed {{in the early years of}} the Arab Empire.|$|E

Red Robinson, Vancouver radio icon and MC of the Presley concert in that city, said Parker did not accompany Presley to that show, but instead stayed in Washington.

25|$|As such, {{the play}} is one of Fielding's Scriblerian plays, and the {{commentary}} in the print edition adds another level of satire that originates in the Scriblerus model of Alexander Pope, Jonathan Swift, et al. H. Scriblerus Secundus prefaces the play with claims that Scriblerus spent ten years working on an edition and that the play comes from the Elizabethan time period and may or <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> work of Shakespeare. Additionally, Scriblerus abuses classical sources through mistranslations and misreadings, botches contemporary and traditional critical theory, and is a satirical representation of criticism in general {{in the tradition of}} A Tale of a Tub and The Dunciad Variorum. Regardless of the humorous elements, the notes do reveal Fielding's vast classical education.|$|E

25|$|Iceland {{was first}} settled around 870. The first {{permanent}} settler in Iceland is usually {{considered to have}} been a Norwegian chieftain named Ingólfr Arnarson. According to the story, he threw two carved pillars overboard as he neared land, vowing to settle wherever they landed. He then sailed along the coast until the pillars were found in the southwestern peninsula, now known as Reykjanesskagi. There he settled with his family around 874, in a place he named Reykjavík (Bay of Smokes) due to the geothermal steam rising from the earth. It is recognized, however, that Ingólfur Arnarson <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> first one to settle permanently in Iceland— that may have been Náttfari, a slave of Garðar Svavarsson who stayed behind when his master returned to Scandinavia.|$|E
25|$|Sampling {{evidence}} supports {{the theory that}} Mound A was originally {{part of a group}} (including mounds B, C, D, E, and F) surrounding the western plaza possibly as early as the Bayland phase(but more likely the Aden phase), and certainly established by the Kings Crossing phase. Mound A may or <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> principal structure at this time. This plan may have carried on into the Crippen Point phase, but the evidence strongly suggests that either then or in the succeeding Mayersville phase site reorientation took place. Mound A becoming the principle feature of an east plaza assemblage (with mounds F', G, G', H, U, and V) which remained the ritual center of the site throughout the remainder of its history.|$|E
25|$|In 2003, {{southern}} California witnessed powerful chaparral wildfires. Hundreds {{of homes}} {{and hundreds of thousands}} of acres of land went up in flames. Extreme fire weather (low humidity, low fuel moisture and high winds) and the accumulation of dead plant material from 8 years of drought, contributed to a catastrophic outcome. Although some have maintained that fire suppression contributed to an unnatural buildup of fuel loads, a detailed analysis of historical fire data has showed that this <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> case. Fire suppression activities had failed to exclude fire from the southern California chaparral. Research showing differences in fire size and frequency between southern California and Baja has been used to imply that the larger fires north of the border are the result of fire suppression, but this opinion has been challenged by numerous investigators and is no longer supported by the majority of fire ecologists.|$|E

25|$|The book {{refers to}} the book of learning, however, for a {{university}} that sought to implement the Oxbridge traditions of teaching excellence, {{it is important to}} note that the La Trobe book, unlike Oxford, Cambridge, Sydney or Monash, does not contain clasps, which signifies that the book cannot be opened with ease. Its absence does not suggest that the La Trobian approach to learning is any less rigorous, rather, it represents a different approach towards knowledge that can only be seen in conjunction with the other heraldic symbols. That is, that learning and the pursuit of enlightenment is attained through the journey that one undertakes to achieve their desired outcome. Even then, the outcome at which one has reached, <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> outcome initially sought. Thus, it is the importance placed on the journey of learning, and what is derived from it, that forms the heart of the university philosophy.|$|E
25|$|The {{motorcycle}} is a single-track, two-wheeled {{motor vehicle}} powered by an engine. Although the first gasoline/petrol motorcycle powered by an {{internal combustion engine}} was built in 1885 by a German named Gottlieb Daimler, his <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> first motorcycle. Ironically, Daimler's motorcycle used a four-stroke internal combustion engine that wasn't of his own creation, instead having to rely upon an engine built by Nicolaus August Otto which he simply mounted onto the frame of a bicycle. Furthermore, if {{the definition of a}} motorcycle is inclusive of a steam engine and not exclusive to an internal combustion engine, then the world's first motorcycle may either have been American; a coal-powered, two-cylinder, steam-driven motorcycle known as the Roper steam velocipede invented by Sylvester Howard Roper in 1867; or perhaps a French one, independently invented by a competing claim by French blacksmith Pierre Michaux and engineer Louis-Guillaume Perreaux, who invented the Michaux-Perreaux steam velocipede in 1868.|$|E
25|$|The Fourth Crusade further {{degraded}} {{the position}} of Byzantine Jews. As smaller states separated from a weakened empire, the rulers of these states found themselves more capable of enforcing legislation than their Byzantine counterparts. The most powerful protection {{on the rights of}} Jews—governmental impotence to enforce laws—was thus abolished. Theodore Doukas, who crowned himself emperor of Epiros after he conquered Thessalonica, was known for his persecution of the Jews, which began in 1229, a year before the end of his reign. Theodore's disdain for the Jews is well-established. Still, his waiting until 1229—five years after capturing Thessalonica and declaring himself emperor—indicates that antisemitism <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> cause of his anti-Jewish edicts. Rather, they appear to have been motivated by a desire to confiscate Jewish property at a time when his empire was short of funds. This explains the expropriations of Jewish property under Theodore, as well as his regime's abstention from religious persecution for its own sake.|$|E
