25|$|Frank Dikötter {{writes that}} beatings with sticks {{was the most}} common method used by local cadres and roughly half of all cadres {{regularly}} pummeled or caned people. Other cadres devised harsher means to humiliate and torture those who failed to keep up. As mass starvation set in, ever greater violence had to be inflicted in order to coerce malnourished people to labor in the fields. Victims were buried alive, thrown bound into ponds, stripped naked and forced to labor in the <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> <b>winter,</b> doused in boiling water, forced to ingest excrement and urine, and subjected to mutilation (hair ripped out, noses and ears lopped off). In Guangdong, some cadres injected salt water into their victims with needles normally reserved for cattle. Around 6 to 8 percent of those who died during the Great Leap Forward were tortured to death or summarily killed.|$|E
25|$|Immediately {{when war}} was declared, Genghis sent orders for a force already {{out to the}} west to {{immediately}} cross the Tien Shan mountains {{to the south and}} ravage the fertile Ferghana Valley {{in the eastern part of}} the Khwarezm Empire. This smaller detachment, no more than 20-30,000 men, was led by Genghis's son Jochi and his elite general Jebe. The Tien Shan mountain passes were much more treacherous than the Dzungarian Gate, and to make it worse, they attempted the crossing in the <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> <b>winter</b> with 5+ feet of snow. Though the Mongols suffered losses and were exhausted from the crossing, their presence in the Ferghana Valley stunned the Khwarezm leadership and permanently stole the initiative away. This march can be described as the Central Asian equivalent of Hannibal's crossing of the Alps, with the same devastating effects. Because the Shah did not know if this Mongol army was a diversion or their main army, he had to protect one of his most fertile regions with force. Therefore, the Shah dispatched his elite cavalry reserve, which prevented him from effectively marching anywhere else with his main army. Jebe and Jochi seem to have kept their army in good shape while plundering the valley, and they avoided defeat by a much superior force. At this point the Mongols split up and again maneuvered over the mountains: Jebe marched further south deeper into Khwarezm territory, while Jochi took most of the force northwest to attack the exposed cities on the Syr Darya from the east.|$|E

The Financial Times called it [...] "the worst possible timing to launch what was proclaimed to be a serious, road-going vehicle". Sinclair's biographer Rodney Dale describes it as [...] "a calculated (or miscalculated) risk", pointing out that production was already underway, details were beginning to leak out to the press and [...] "the launch could hardly have been held up until the possibility of a bright spring day". He justified the choice of January as being necessitated by a need to release the C5 [...] "as soon as possible lest the erroneous speculation should have done more harm than good". Rob Gray offers an alternative explanation, that the launch date had been brought forward because Sinclair's development funds were running low.|$|E

The beginning scene in [...] "Who Guards the Guards?", where Mace and Khordad meet in Hebron, was filmed on a roof garden in below zero temperatures; however, McInnerny and Paul Bhattacharjee wore summer clothes. To prevent hypothermia a heater was placed near them. The cameras used light-coloured filters to make the environment look warmer. However, winter did have an advantage of longer nights, making night scenes easier; summer nights would last as little as five hours. The producers hired real news presenters from Sky News and the programme London Tonight to present the news of the events from some episodes. All episodes begin with a recap from past episodes, which the producers regard as [...] "an art in themselves" [...] in terms of editing.

[...] In his youth, he became a senior officer in the colonial militia during the first stages of the French and Indian War. In 1775, the Second Continental Congress commissioned him as commander-in-chief of the Continental Army in the American Revolution. In that command, Washington forced the British out of Boston in 1776 but was defeated and nearly captured later that year when he lost New York City. After crossing the Delaware River in the <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> <b>winter,</b> he defeated the British in two battles (Trenton and Princeton), retook New Jersey, and restored momentum to the Patriot cause. His strategy enabled Continental forces to capture two major British armies at Saratoga in 1777 and Yorktown in 1781. Historians laud Washington for the selection and supervision of his generals, preservation and command of the army, coordination with the Congress, state governors, and their militia, and attention to supplies, logistics, and training.

On August16, the system organized into a tropical disturbance, becoming Tropical Depression A1 the next day; this made it the first such storm in the month of August since Tropical Depression Aline in August 1969. Also on August17, the JTWC initiated advisories on Tropical Cyclone 2S. The depression moved southward, developing a well-defined central dense overcast, despite the presence of northerly wind shear. On August18, an anticyclone turned the depression eastward; that day, the JTWC estimated peak 1minute winds of 85km/h (50mph), and the MFR estimated a peak 10minute intensity of [...] 55km/h (35mph). The depression later began to weaken under the influence of an approaching trough, and was dissipating as it crossed into the Australian region on August19.
