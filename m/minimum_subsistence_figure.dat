On the one hand, considering the actual situations of the quickening of China’s urbanization and deepening of poverty, it is necessary to make significant adjustment and transformation in China’s poverty reduction policies and <b>minimum</b> <b>subsistence</b> security system. On the other hand, it is pointed out that there is no omnipotent experience to follow in the convergence of <b>minimum</b> <b>subsistence</b> security system and poverty reduction policies. The actual conditions in various regions should be taken into consideration. And it is suggested that China should achieve the organic integration of rural <b>minimum</b> <b>subsistence</b> security system and poverty alleviation policies from management, capital and policy.

The relative changes in the expected terminal wealth, <b>minimum</b> <b>subsistence</b> and the risk aversion are studied. Taking VaR as the risk measure, the return/risk tradeoff efficient frontier is constructed.

3000|$|Equations  4 and 5 show {{child labor}} {{decreases}} {{with an increase}} in adult wages and remittance income. However, remittance receipt is more complex than just a change in non-labor household income, since migration necessarily requires removing at least one member from the household to go abroad, i.e., a decrease in n. Equation  6 gives the change in optimal child labor effort with respect to the number of adults in the household. This implies that when the adult wage is less than the <b>minimum</b> <b>subsistence</b> level, migration will lead to a decrease in child labor and when the adult wage is greater than the <b>minimum</b> <b>subsistence</b> level migration leads to an increase in child labor, before accounting for any change in remittance income.

At this low stable equilibrium level, both the rate of investment and saving are low. If per capita income is increased above the <b>minimum</b> <b>subsistence</b> level, it encourages growth in population. The population growth, in turn pushes down per capita income again to subsistence level. Thus the economy is caught in low level equilibrium trap.

We consider an exchange economy with two types of agents, food producers and non-food producers. An agent starves if his consumption of food falls below the <b>minimum</b> <b>subsistence</b> level. We show that non-food producers are more vulnerable to starvation than food producers, and may fail to survive even when the aggregate amount of food in the economy is enough to guarantee survival of all agents.
