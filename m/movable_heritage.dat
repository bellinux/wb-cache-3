We find different implementation outcomes stemming from one and the same formal policy. Due to high levels of polarization between political decision makers, the implementing actors have broad discretion to apply different informal policies. In depth analysis of implementation also suggests that under these conditions different implementing players have followed their normative orientations and applied completely different informal policies. Different implementing actors apply different policies and, thus, as it were, they live in parallel universes where different implementation practices exist...|$|R

The items of this collection may be the subject of loans for temporary exhibitions and include objects from the archaeological excavations of the city of Cambrai, architectural elements, sculpture, paintings, pieces of jewellery and liturgical ornaments. This museum's history began in 1926 when Monseignor , Archbishop of Cambrai, established a commission of religious history and sacred art aimed to inventory and preserve the archives and <b>movable</b> <b>heritage</b> of the diocese. Canon Cyrille Thelliez became secretary. In 1958, many religious objects from the diocese were gathered together and Thelliez founded the Diocesan Museum, the first religious art museum opened in France. The museum was installed in the former chapel of the Grand Seminary.|$|E
40|$|Movable {{cultural}} heritage is not bounded nor shielded by national territorial borders. Applicable domestic laws are of limited import without {{the cooperation of}} other states and the international community. Despite a century of domestic legal protection of movable {{cultural heritage}} in many states, widespread non-compliance and lack of enforcement has been the norm rather than the exception. However, the tide is turning. States formerly reluctant to ratify cultural heritage treaties have done so, signalling their acceptance {{of the importance of}} multilateral action in this field. Enforcement of such laws is viewed as part of the reinforcement of good governance, rule of law and human rights in the international and domestic spheres. This new found international cooperation has emerged within the context of developments in human rights law which have necessarily redefined and informed initiatives to combat the illicit traffic of cultural objects. These efforts are clarifying the nature of the obligations owed by states (and non-state actors) in respect of protection of <b>movable</b> <b>heritage,</b> and expanded the right-holder beyond the state – to individuals and groups. This chapter seeks to outline recent developments in the human rights law and international law for the protection of cultural heritage which manifest this interrelation as it pertains to <b>movable</b> <b>heritage.</b> Part One focuses on the obligations on states and non-state actors in leading international instruments for the protection of <b>movable</b> <b>heritage</b> including prevention of its illicit transfer during armed conflict, belligerent occupation and peacetime. Part Two details how human rights norms have been referenced in multilateral instruments for the protection of cultural heritage; and examines the relationship between controls on the export of cultural material and specific human rights, namely, the right to property, right to self-determination, right to participate in cultural life, and minority protection...|$|E

40|$|In first {{instance}} an attempt {{is made to}} give a definition of Preventive Conservation {{in the field of}} immovable heritage based on previous definitions and concepts. Analogies of daily life and in medicine are used to clarify the concept that has a broader basis in society. Subsequently a methodology for preventive conservation actions is proposed based on the general approach of conservation and using a proper understanding of risk versus effects as originally developed for <b>movable</b> <b>heritage.</b> A similar concept for immovable heritage is proposed. The 3 rd PRECOMOS gathering in Ecuador on challenges of Preventive conservation addresses different issues dealing with general approaches and tools for preventive conservation. A second group of presentations address the social aspects of preventive conservation including the economic aspects of them. Reflections on the social aspects are fed by the experience on the intensive Preventive Conservation Minga held in Susudel at the end of 2011 but also by the PhD research of Hsien-yang Tseng. The economic aspects dealt with by the team of Prof. Della Torre demonstrate that cultural heritage should not be understood only as a resource leading to financial streams but rather as a driver for economy contributing to regional development, innovation in the field of creative industries. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|The {{preservation}} of the cultural heritage is a complex process {{not only because of}} the intrinsic characteristics of the historical buildings, but also for the simultaneous presence of real interest from the point of view of art, such as furniture and decorative elements as works like stucco, frescoes. A similar task was much more difficult in an area like the Italian one exposed to considerable natural hazards including earthquakes. With the aim to support proper preventive actions and mitigation of seismic risk, in recent times the regulatory framework has been heavily renovated. In this context it is essential the knowledge of the main formal, structural, functional characteristics of the protected works and to extend this knowledge to movable also in seismic perspective. Such an objective could be pursued through simple and rapid tools, able to characterize the object in a simple and standardized way, thus providing a hierarchical structure of information that define it and provide the essence, appreciating the quality and highlighting the criticality under exceptional actions. The aim of this thesis is to discuss and extend the approach to the structural and non-structural knowledge outlined in the "Guidelines for the evaluation and reduction of seismic risk of cultural heritage", to the <b>movable</b> <b>heritage...</b>|$|E
40|$|Aran Valley, on the north-west side of Catalonia, {{is located}} on the septentrional {{gradient}} of the central Pyrenees, constituting the source of the Garona River. It borders with France in the north and Aragon in the west. This particular locality, and its singular history, have made this valley a strategic area since medieval times.

This organism has an integral composition and functionality that differs from the Heritage Commissions that we can find in other places.
