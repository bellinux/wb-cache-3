5000|$|Before {{the advent}} of CT scanning, the {{pathology}} in failed back syndrome was difficult to understand. Computerized tomography in conjunction with <b>metrizamide</b> myelography in the late 1960s and 1970s allowed direct observation of the mechanisms involved in post operative failures. Six distinct pathologic conditions were identified: ...|$|E
50|$|The {{root cause}} of the {{condition}} is not entirely clear, and {{it appears to have}} multiple causes, including iatrogenic cause from misplaced epidural steroid injection therapy when accidentally administered intrathecally (inside the dura mater, the sac enveloping the arachnoid mater), or from contrast media used in myelography prior to the introduction of <b>Metrizamide.</b> Other noninfectious inflammatory processes include surgery, intrathecal hemorrhage, and the administration of anesthetics (e.g. chloroprocaine), and steroids (e.g. prednisolone, triamcinolone acetonide). A variety of other causes exist, including infectious, inflammatory, and neoplastic processes. Infectious causes include bacterial, viral, fungal, and parasitic agents. Prior spinal surgery has been documented as a cause of arachnoiditis ossificans, {{as well as for the}} adhesive form. It can also be caused by long term pressure from either a severe disc herniation or spinal stenosis.|$|E
5000|$|Fibrous {{scarring}} {{can also}} be a complication within the subarachnoid space. It is notoriously difficult to detect and evaluate. Prior to the development of magnetic resonance imaging, the only way to ascertain the presence of arachnoiditis was by opening the dura. In the days of CT scanning and Pantopaque and later, <b>Metrizamide</b> myelography, the presence of arachnoiditis could be speculated based on radiographic findings. Often, myelography prior to the introduction of <b>Metrizamide</b> was the cause of arachnoiditis. It {{can also be}} caused by the long term pressure brought about with either a severe disc herniation or spinal stenosis. [...] The presence of both epidural scarring and arachnoiditis in the same patient are probably quite common. Arachnoiditis is a broad term denoting inflammation of the meninges and subarachnoid space. A variety of causes exist, including infectious, inflammatory, and neoplastic processes.Infectious causes include bacterial, viral, fungal, and parasitic agents. Noninfectious inflammatory processes include surgery, intrathecal hemorrhage, and the administration of intrathecal (inside the dural canal) agents such as myelographic contrast media, anesthetics (e.g. chloroprocaine), and steroids (e.g. Depo-Medrol, Kenalog). Lately iatrogenic arachnoiditis has been attributed to misplaced Epidural Steroid Injection therapy when accidentally administered intrathecally. The preservatives and suspension agents found in all steroid injectates, which aren't indicated for epidural administration by the U.S. Food & Drug Administration due to reports of severe adverse events including arachnoiditis, paralysis and death, have now been directly linked to the onset of the disease following the initial stage of chemical meningitis. [...] Neoplasia includes the hematogenous spread of systemic tumors, such as breast and lung carcinoma, melanoma, and non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Neoplasia also includes direct seeding of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from primary central nervous system (CNS) tumors such as glioblastoma multiforme, medulloblastoma, ependymoma, and choroid plexus carcinoma. Strictly speaking, {{the most common cause of}} arachnoiditis in failed back syndrome is not infectious or from cancer. It is due to non-specific scarring secondary to the surgery or the underlying pathology.|$|E
50|$|Both {{agents are}} {{administered}} by spinal tap (lumbar puncture - LP or cisternal puncture at the cervicocranial junction). The human patient is rolled from the lateral decubitus (lying on the side) to prone. Ankles are {{strapped to the}} end of a hard X-ray, CT, or MRI table. To obtain images of the cervical region the patient is then carefully tilted cephalad (toward the head) so contrast agent (particularly Pantopaque) can enter the neck region. Care is given to prevent spilling dye into the posterior fossa (back of the head) or to enter the cranial cavity in general. This speaks to the inability to remove the heavier or more viscous Pantopaque without aspirating it with spinal fluid (CSF) through a lumbar puncture needle in the low back (sticking up vertically) or back of the neck. With <b>Metrizamide</b> the issue is that if entering the cranial cavity and high dose exposure to the blood brain barrier, side effects are more likely encountered. Issues related to absorption into the general circulation are also encountered.|$|E
40|$|Bloody {{cerebrospinal}} fluid {{is thought to}} {{increase the risk of}} arachnoiditis from myelography with iophendylate, but not with aqueous media. An experimental study was undertaken of the effects of <b>metrizamide,</b> iocarmate, and blood, independently and in mixtures, on the production of arachnoid fibrosis. Monkeys exposed to a mixture of iocarmate or <b>metrizamide</b> and blood developed no more significant arachnoid fibrosis than animals exposed to the contrast medium alone. Lumbar puncture with bloody {{cerebrospinal fluid}}, although a possible cause of adverse effects, is not a contraindication to proceeding with <b>metrizamide</b> myelography. Bloody cerebrospinal fluid is not considered a contraindication to <b>metrizamide</b> myelography by radiologists [1], but is listed as a warning by the manufacturer in the package insert.

However, the incidence of adverse reactions differed markedly. Of patients receiving <b>metrizamide,</b> 68 % had some type of adverse reaction, whereas only 26 % receiving iohexol had symptoms. The incidence of headache (<b>metrizamide,</b> 34 %; iohexol, 26 %) was not statistically different, but the quality of the headache differed: half of the <b>metrizamide</b> headaches were moderate or severe, whereas all iohexol headaches were mild.

40|$|Three {{patients}} with cervical radicular symptoms and normal <b>metrizamide</b> myelograms underwent thin-section high-resolution computed tomographic scanning {{because of a}} strong clinical suspicion of herniated disk. Herniated disk was demonstrated in all three cases. In two, the disk protrusions were recognized only by computed tomographic myelography, and in the third case, the diagnosis was made with plain computed tomography and confirmed by computed tomographic myelography. Traditionally, confirmation of clinically suspected cervical disk disease has been sought by Pantopaque or plain-film <b>metrizamide</b> myelography [1, 2]. Recently computed tomography (CT) {{has been used to}} demonstrate cervical disk disease in {{patients with}} suspicious myelograms [3]. CT myelography is a technique in which spinal CT is combined with the intrathecal administration of <b>metrizamide.</b> Since its first description, this procedure has been used in a large number of disorders of the spinal canal and its contents [4, 5].

40|$|Recognized {{risk factors}} for <b>metrizamide</b> {{myelography}} are seizure disorder, seizure-threshold-lowering drugs, dehydration, and possibly age. After observing serious neu-rologic complications in diabetic patients after routine <b>metrizamide</b> myelography, a retrospective {{study was conducted to}} determine if diabetes should be considered another independent and important risk factor. Forty-one diabetic patients who had lumbar <b>metrizamide</b> myelograms were compared with a control group of 110 nondiabetic patients. A significantly higher incidence was found of severe vomiting (15 % vs. 3 %, P < 0. 01) and neurologic complications (20 % vs. 2 %, P < 0. 001) in the diabetic population. Neurologic complications included one case each of seizure, severe encephalopathy, auditory and visual hallucinations, and prolonged somnolence and four cases of confu-sion-anxiety. Four of the diabetic patients had major transient elevations of blood pressure. These findings suggest that diabetics are a high-risk population for metriza-mide myelography. The dose of <b>metrizamide</b> should be minimized, whenever possible.

Material from 35 - 55 S monoparticles was indeed distributed along the gradient but rerun experiments, CsCl density determinations, formaldehyde fixation prior to centrifugation suggested that the separation was due to dissociation or (and) action of endogeneous ribonucleases rather than to monoparticle fractionation. That dissociation had indeed occured was confirmed by the study of 60 - 110 S polyparticles. They were dissociated into ribonucleoproteins rich in phosphoproteins and into free proteins. These products were essentially similar to those obtained after NaCl treatment of the particles though the modes of action of <b>metrizamide</b> and NaCl {{are likely to be}} different.

40|$|To detect {{changes in}} capsid {{structure}} that occur when a preassembled bacteriophage T 7 capsid both packages and cleaves to mature-size longer (concatameric) DNA, the kinetics and thermodynamics are determined {{here for the}} binding of the protein-specific probe, 1, 1 '-bi(4 -anilino) naphthalene- 5, 5 '-di-sulfonic acid (bis-ANS), to bacteriophage T 7, a T 7 DNA deletion (8. 4 %) mutant, and a DNA-free T 7 capsid (<b>metrizamide</b> low density capsid II) {{known to be a}} DNA packaging intermediate that has a permeability barrier not present in a related capsid (<b>metrizamide</b> high density capsid II). Initially, some binding to either bacteriophage or <b>metrizamide</b> low density capsid II occurs too rapidly to quantify (phase 1, duration < 10 s). Subsequent binding (phase 2) occurs with first-order kinetics. Only the phase 1 binding occurs for <b>metrizamide</b> high density capsid II. These observations, together with both the kinetics of the quenching by ethidium of bound bis-ANS fluorescence and the nature of bis-ANS-induced protein alterations, are explained by the hypothesis that the phase 2 binding occurs at internal sites. The number of these internal sites increases as the density of the packaged DNA decreases. The accompanying change in structure is potentially the signal for initiating cleavage of a concatemer.
