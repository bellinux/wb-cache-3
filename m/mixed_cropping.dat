40|$|As {{calls for}} bolstering {{environmental}} services on croplands {{have grown more}} insistent {{during the past two}} decades, the search for ways to foster sustainable, reduced input agriculture has become more urgent. In this context we re-examine by means of a meta-analysis the argument, first proposed by Robert McC. Netting, that small scale, <b>mixed</b> <b>crop</b> – livestock farming, a common livelihood among poor rural peoples, encourages environmentally sustainable agricultural practices. As predicted, <b>mixed</b> <b>crop</b> – livestock farms exhibit more sustainable practices, but, contrary to predictions, a small scale of operation does not predict sustainability. Unsustainable practices occur on small farms characterized by degrading, input scarce agriculture and on large farms characterized by industrialized, high chemical input agriculture. Sustainable practices occur on small farms that <b>mix</b> <b>crops</b> with livestock production, and they occur on large farms characterized by minimum tillage. The strength and pervasiveness of the link between <b>mixed</b> <b>crop</b> –livestock farming and sustainable agricultural practices in both developed and developing countries argues for agricultural policies that promote <b>mixed</b> <b>crop</b> – livestock livelihoods.

50|$|Ricebean is {{valuable}} {{for its ability}} to fix nitrogen in depleted soils and in <b>mixed</b> <b>cropping</b> with local varieties of maize, as well as for its beneficial role in preventing soil erosion. The crop receives almost no inputs, and is grown on residual fertility and moisture and in marginal and exhausted soils. Anecdotal evidence indicates that the area and production of ricebean in Nepal is declining due to the introduction of high yielding maize varieties and increasing use of chemical fertilizers, while consumption is decreasing due to increased availability of more preferred pulses in the local markets. No modern plant breeding has been done and only landraces with low yield potential are grown. These have to compete with other summer legumes such as soybeans (Glycine max), black gram, cowpea, common beans (Phaseolus vulgaris) and horse gram (Mactrotyloma uniflorum). Other production constraints that limit the production of ricebean include small and fragmented land holdings and declining productivity.|$|E

50|$|Organic {{farming is}} an {{alternative}} agricultural system which originated early in the 20th century in reaction to rapidly changing farming practices. Organic farming continues to be developed by various organic agriculture organizations today. It relies on fertilizers of organic origin such as compost, manure, green manure, and bone meal and places emphasis on techniques such as crop rotation and companion planting. Biological pest control, <b>mixed</b> <b>cropping</b> and the fostering of insect predators are encouraged. In general, organic standards are designed to allow the use of naturally occurring substances while prohibiting or strictly limiting synthetic substances. For instance, naturally occurring pesticides such as pyrethrin and rotenone are permitted, while synthetic fertilizers and pesticides are generally prohibited. Synthetic substances that are allowed include, for example, copper sulfate, elemental sulfur and Ivermectin. Genetically modified organisms, nanomaterials, human sewage sludge, plant growth regulators, hormones, and antibiotic use in livestock husbandry are prohibited. Reasons for advocation of organic farming include real or perceived advantages in sustainability, openness, self-sufficiency, autonomy/independence, health, food security, and food safety, although the match between perception and reality is continually challenged.|$|E

5000|$|When Dr. M.H Marigowda {{took the}} charge of the post of the Superintendent of Horticulture in Mysore, in 1951, the {{developmental}} works in the state started with an unprecedented pace. In 1963, consequent {{to the formation of}} the separate Department of Horticulture, he was elevated to the post of the Director of Horticulture. Several schemes which were earlier handled by the Agriculture Department, were transferred to this newly created Department. In 1965, the reorganization of the Department took place and several posts were created in order to carry over the task of Horticulture development in the state. Also, a large number of new scheme were sanctioned. In 1956, as a result of reorganization of the state, the Horticultural activities were extended to all the 19 districts. Thus, he was responsible for elevating the minor Department of Horticulture to a major Department. During his term, he took the Horticulture to the rural areas and to the common man. He set into implementation of a unique pattern of Horticulture development i.e., “4-Limbed Model of Horticulture”. To suit to this, he established the Horticulture Produce Co-operative Marketing Society and the Nurserymen’s Co-operative Society at Bangalore. He started as many as 357 farms and nurseries all over the state. His visualization of the farms and nurseries was in developing them as progeny orchards, nursery centers and places of demonstration of new crops and technology to the farmers. Seed testing, soil testing and plant protection laboratories were started at Lalbagh by him. Several park and gardens were laid out in different cities and towns of the state. The area of Lalbagh Botanical Garden was expanded to 240 acre and planted with additional native and exotic species of plants during his period. Dr. Marigowda was a staunch advocate of Dry Land Horticulture and the principals and practices of these technologies were demonstrated in most of the farms started by him. This inspired the farmers of the state to practice Dry Land Horticulture on vast dry and drought prone tracts of the state. <b>Mixed</b> <b>cropping</b> and intercroppings got special fillip during his times. Thus, through multifarious achievements and feats, the state of Karnataka became the “Horticultural State of India”, and Dr. Marigowda’s name became immortal in the annals of Horticulture development in Karnataka.|$|E
