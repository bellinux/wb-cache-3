Integrated circuits have made digital logic so inexpensive that an electronic timer is now less expensive than many <b>mechanical</b> and electromechanical <b>timers.</b> Individual timers are implemented as a simple single-chip computer system, similar to a watch and usually using the same, mass-produced, technology.|$|R
50|$|On August 28, 2003, two {{sophisticated}} homemade bombs exploded {{approximately one}} hour apart, at the Chiron Corporation in Emeryville, California, causing minor property damage but no injuries. The FBI believes the second bomb was timed to target first responders. Another bomb, wrapped with nails to produce shrapnel, exploded on September 26, 2003 at the Shaklee Corporation in Pleasanton, California, again causing damage but no casualties. The bombs used ammonium nitrate explosives and <b>mechanical</b> <b>timers.</b>|$|R
50|$|However, {{proximity}} fuzes {{can suffer}} premature detonation {{because of the}} moisture in heavy rain clouds. This led to 'controlled variable time' (CVT) after World War II. These fuzes have a <b>mechanical</b> <b>timer</b> that switched on the radar about 5 seconds before expected impact, they also detonated on impact.|$|E

The physical act of winding the timer confirms the user's determination {{to start the}} task; ticking externalises desire to complete the task; ringing announces a break. Flow and focus become associated with these physical stimuli.|$|E
50|$|In the 1950s and 1960s, the United States {{developed}} {{several different}} types of lightweight nuclear device. The smallest of these was the W54 warhead, which had a 10.75 in diameter, was about 15.7 in long, and weighed approximately 51 lb. It was fired by a <b>mechanical</b> <b>timer</b> and had a TNT equivalent between 10 tons and 1 kiloton. The W54 nuclear device was also used in the Davy Crockett Weapon System and in the GAR-11/AIM-26A.|$|E
50|$|The first {{automatic}} timer, the dashpot timer {{has been}} used in many different machines and has many variations. Pneumatic, hydraulic-action, and mercury displacement timers. Being used in a variety of things such as printing presses, motors, and even irrigation systems, the dashpot timer has seen many applications. Even in modern times with electrical and digital <b>timers,</b> these old <b>mechanical</b> <b>timers</b> are still in use due to their simplicity and ability to function in tough environments.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Mechanical</b> <b>timers</b> use {{clockwork}} {{to measure}} time. [...] Manual timers are typically set by turning a dial {{to the time}} interval desired; turning the dial stores energy in a mainspring to run the mechanism. They function similarly to a mechanical alarm clock; the energy in the mainspring causes a balance wheel to rotate back and forth. [...] Each swing of the wheel releases the gear train to move forward by a small fixed amount, causing the dial to move steadily backward until it reaches zero, when a lever arm strikes a bell. The <b>mechanical</b> kitchen <b>timer</b> was invented in 1926 by Thomas Norman Hicks. Some less accurate, cheaper mechanisms use a flat paddle called a fan fly that spins against air resistance; low-precision mechanical egg-timers are sometimes of this type.|$|R
5000|$|In 1937, Lincoln {{introduced}} the first single-line, positive-displacement lubrication system for industry. The system was significantly {{less expensive than}} conventional two-line systems. Designed by Lincoln's chief of Engineering, Lutwin Rotter, the Centro-Matic system used a pump to distribute lubricant {{to a number of}} injectors. These injectors measure the amount of lubricant dispensed with each cycle of the pump. Initially, the pumps were hand operated. Later, air-operated pumps and <b>mechanical</b> <b>timers</b> called [...] "Chicken House Timers" [...] (Conley) were added to automate the entire system.|$|R
5000|$|The 1937 Bendix Home Laundry [...] {{would be}} {{recognised}} as a front loading automatic washer by any modern user of such machines. It had a glass porthole door, a rotating drum and an electrically driven <b>mechanical</b> <b>timer.</b> The machine {{was able to}} autofill, wash, rinse and spin-dry. Initially {{the lack of any}} vibration damper meant that the machine had to be secured firmly to the floor. The machine also lacked an internal water heater.|$|E
5000|$|In the 1950s and 1960s, the United States {{developed}} {{several different}} types of lightweight nuclear devices. The main one was the W54, a cylinder 40 by 60 cm (about 16 by 24 inches) that weighed 68 kg (150 lb). It was fired by a <b>mechanical</b> <b>timer</b> and had a variable yield equivalent to between 10 tons and 1 kt of TNT. A Field non-variable yield version of the W54 nuclear device (called the [...] "Mk-54 Davy Crockett" [...] warhead for the M-388 Crockett round) {{was used in the}} Davy Crockett Weapon System.|$|E
50|$|Nowadays {{when people}} are using more and more mobile phones, there are also timer apps that mimic the old <b>mechanical</b> <b>timer,</b> but which have also highly {{sophisticated}} functions. These apps are also easier to use daily, because they are available at once, without any need to purchase or carry the separate devices, as today timer is just a software application on a phone or tablet. Some of these apps are countdown timers, stopwatch timers, etc. These timer apps {{can be used for}} tracking working or training time, motivating children to do tasks, replacing an hour glass in board games, or for the traditional purpose for tracking time when cooking and baking.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT. Irrigation {{application}} duration is {{an important}} factor influencing surface irrigation efficiency. Most methods of semiautomatic timing and control use <b>mechanical</b> <b>timers</b> for (1) direct gate release by the timer, and (2) timers designed for use with electrical components such as solenoid or electric motor-actuated releases. A trip-cord gate release system and water sensors were also used to semiautomate irrigation. The trip-cord system uses the energy of an opening or closing gate to either open or close other gates in the operating sequence. Semiautomatic gates, described in articles I and II of this series, and their associated controls were tested on a basin and three border irrigation systems on two farms during a five-year period. The semiautomatic controls provided operator convenience and reduced water and labo...|$|R

50|$|Every kind of dashpot timer {{has seen}} use in {{different}} technologies, from toasters to automated factory operations. The dashpot timer, or <b>mechanical</b> <b>timer,</b> {{has changed the}} way we use technology. With its many industrial and commercial applications, to household appliances and gardening, the dashpot timer is a very important invention that has certainly led to many changes in how thing were done during the 20th century and how things are done in modern times. In modern times, even though we have electrical and digital timers, mechanical timers are still used, especially in cases where the environment is not friendly for electronics. Another advantage of mechanical timers is that they are easy to repair. The amount of precise automated systems used in modern factories shows the usefulness and precision of these timers, while their presence in many households shows their availability and inexpensiveness. Even with the small problems that are present in these systems they have proven themselves reliable enough to be used in many fields for nearly a century.|$|E
5000|$|A {{sprinkler}} system timer is an electrical device {{that is used}} to set an irrigation {{sprinkler system}} to come on automatically at a certain time. Irrigation timers first appeared in the early 1960s to control large-radius lawn sprinklers, which at the time usually contained their own electrically operated valve (most golf-course sprinklers still use this type of actuation). These timers were large and cumbersome with numerous mechanical parts and were usually relegated to agricultural and commercial applications. Compact irrigation timers did not become commonplace until the 1970s when Lawn Genie introduced a <b>mechanical</b> <b>timer</b> which measured only ten by six inches and was four inches deep. This controller proved popular for many years, but was hard to reprogram and it did not operate valves in immediate succession unless each valve was set to run for an hour. Rain Bird later introduced the RC-7A to their Rain Clox line, which featured an [...] "at a glance" [...] electromechanical programming interface that proved very easy to operate, and offered the ability to omit stations from the program sequence without creating time gaps. This timer which became standard issue in many tract homes during the 1980s and proved to be remarkably durable in its construction, with many still operating today.|$|E
5000|$|Frost-free {{refrigerators}} or freezers use {{electric fans}} {{to cool the}} appropriate compartment. This could be called a [...] "fan forced" [...] refrigerator, whereas manual defrost units rely on colder air lying at the bottom, versus the warm air at the top to achieve adequate cooling. The air is drawn in through an inlet duct and passed through the evaporator where it is cooled, the air is then circulated throughout the cabinet via a series of ducts and vents. Because the air passing the evaporator is supposedly warm and moist, frost begins to form on the evaporator (especially on a freezer's evaporator). In cheaper and/or older models, a defrost cycle is controlled via a <b>mechanical</b> <b>timer.</b> This timer is set to shut off the compressor and fan and energize a heating element located near or around the evaporator for about 15 to 30 minutes at every 6 to 12 hours. This melts any frost or ice build up and allows the refrigerator to work normally once more. It is believed that frost free units have a lower tolerance for frost, due to their air-conditioner like evaporator coils. Therefore, if a door is left open accidentally (especially the freezer), the defrost system may not remove all frost, in this case, the freezer (or refrigerator) must be defrosted.|$|E

5000|$|... "Skill stop" [...] buttons {{were added}} to some slot {{machines}} by Zacharias Anthony in the early 1970s. These enabled the player to stop each reel, allowing a degree of [...] "skill" [...] so as to satisfy the New Jersey gaming laws of the day which required that players were {{able to control the}} game in some way. The original conversion was applied to approximately 50 late model Bally slot machines. Because the typical machine stopped the reels automatically in less than 10 seconds, weights {{were added to}} the <b>mechanical</b> <b>timers</b> to prolong the automatic stopping of the reels. By the time the New Jersey Alcoholic Beverages Commission (ABC) had approved the conversion for use in New Jersey arcades the word was out and every other distributor began adding skill stops. The machines were a huge hit on the Jersey Shore and the remaining unconverted Bally machines were destroyed as they had become instantly obsolete.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: The cis {{peptide bond}} is a {{characteristic}} feature of turns in protein structures and {{can play the}} role of a hinge in protein folding. Such cis conformations are most commonly found at peptide bonds immediately preceding proline residues, as the cis and trans states for such bonds are close in energy. However, isomerization over the high rotational barrier is slow. In this study, we investigate how mechanical force accelerates the cis to trans isomerization of the prolyl−peptide bond in a stretched backbone. We employ hybrid quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical force-clamp molecular dynamics simulations in order to describe the electronic effects involved. Under tension, the bond order of the prolyl−peptide bond decreases from a partially double toward a single bond, involving a reduction in the electronic conjugation around the peptide bond. The conformational change from cis to extended trans takes place within a few femtoseconds through a nonplanar state of the nitrogen of the peptide moiety in the transition state region, whereupon the partial double-bond character and planarity of the peptide bond in the final trans state is restored. Our findings give insight into how prolyl−peptide bonds might act as force-modulated <b>mechanical</b> <b>timers</b> or switches in the refolding of proteins...|$|R
5000|$|The Dualit Classic Toaster is {{recognised}} as {{a design}} icon. It differs from other toasters {{on the market}} in two key ways: Firstly, it has Dualit’s patented ProHeat elements that have an armour-plated design to protect them from damage. Secondly, the hand-built process used in their manufacture, with each part held together with visible screws, makes the toaster robust, yet easy to disassemble and repair, with replacement elements and other parts readily available so it typically has a longer service life than contemporary electronically controlled toasters. It has a <b>mechanical</b> <b>timer</b> and manual lever to lift the toast from the slots, as opposed to an auto [...] "pop-up" [...] mechanism. [...] Designed in 1952 it is notable for its 'large loaf' shape, characterised with cooling slots {{at both ends of the}} unit designed to allow it to function for periods of extended use in commercial environments such as a café or canteen. The toasters are currently available in different sizes, with various slot numbers and are manufactured in a range of colours and finishes. Since its creation, it has offered upwards of 50 hues. Among the most recent colours to launch was a copper toaster in 2014, launched alongside a new range of Classic Kettles that also offered a copper option. The Classic Toaster is still hand built at Dualit's factory in Crawley, West Sussex.|$|E
5000|$|Because of {{the vast}} {{difficulty}} and extreme danger that came along with handling Special Atomic Demolition Munitions, the extreme versions of transportation needed for the tactical nuclear weapon, and the stealth-like, perfect {{manner in which the}} missions must be executed, Green Light Teams are comparable to the Japanese kamikaze pilots. [...] The general thought of many of the members of these Green Light Teams was that these missions were near suicidal. [...] One Green Light Team member, Louis Frank Napoli, said of the missions, [...] "We were kamikaze pilots without the airplanes", in reference to the heightened danger that they present. [...] Another Green Light Team member, Robert Deifel, also said of the missions, [...] "There was no room for error… We had to be absolutely perfect". The risk was extremely prevalent when discussing the possible time frame for when these atomic devices could ignite on a <b>mechanical</b> <b>timer.</b> This timer would become less efficient and more risky the longer the duration of the timer was set. The team members had been informed that the timers could go off up to eight minutes earlier than desired and even thirteen minutes after expected. [...] This would obviously create a time crisis for the Green Light team members operating the mission. If the team members were instructed to bury the nuclear device, they certainly may have been able to evade the explosion, but radioactive fallout could still cause heavy damage.

50|$|Chacko master {{had always}} been a very strict teacher, who {{emphasized}} on memorization and discipline at the expense of analysis and creativity. His achievements made him narcissistic as a father, wanting to make his son as good a mathematician as himself. His pride blinded him to his son’s aspirations and talents. Unlike his father Thomas was not good at math, but was very creative and productive in designing mechanical and electronic gadgetry like a <b>mechanical</b> <b>timer</b> school bell, something the admirers call “miracle bell” (for its excellence and innovation). He even made an AM radio receiver inside a soap case, at a time when phonographs were the fad of the time. Thomas’s talent astonished others, whereas his father saw them as a waste of time, or even as insults showered at him. He destroyed each one of them and was angry at him for converting his mathematical instrument box into a mechanical toolbox. Chacko master, who punished his students ruthlessly, treated his son worse - assuming him to be behind every mischief in school and punishing him until the actual culprit gives in. He always compared his son to the best student in the class - Balu (the son of a ‘simple’ police constable), adding to his pressure. Thomas worked hard, and did well in his language paper, but his father asked his language teacher Ravunni master to grade his paper so as to fail him, on the belief that only low grades will provoke him to study harder. His language teacher did as asked (regretting it later on). When Thomas found out that even his most beloved language teacher was biased against him, he became outraged and ran away from the village; after stabbing Balu on the palm with a compass. Fourteen years later, he returned as a changed man, no longer interested in clockwork or gadgetry. His father still hate him and profess to love his sister more, who lived up to the expectations. Thomas’s only regret is that he couldn’t get a chance to apologize to Balu, who died in a bike-accident; for which he feels his father is to blame, as he praised the boy too much so as to bring an early death upon him.|$|E

This study aimed to examine the accuracy of therapeutic ultrasound machines in terms of power output and timing function, and to determine factors that relate to the degree of machine accuracy. An observational design was used. Sixty-four machines were sampled. Machines were tested at three power settings, two frequencies, and pulsed and continuous modes. Timers were assessed for 5 - and 10 -minute durations. Ultrasound machines were considered inaccurate if they deviated by more than ± 20 % and timers if they deviated by ± 10 %. Fifty-nine percent (291 / 492) of power tests were inaccurate, with 79 % of these producing less power output than depicted on the dial. Thirty-seven percent of timers were inaccurate, with <b>mechanical</b> <b>timers</b> more inaccurate than digital timers (p < 0. 05). Older ultrasound machines {{were more likely to be}} inaccurate (p < 0. 05). Length of time since machine calibration was also associated with machine inaccuracy at 3 MHz (p < 0. 05). There is a high level of power and timer inaccuracy in machines that may be related to machine age and frequency of calibration. This study highlights the need for therapists to be aware of the potential for machine inaccuracy and for stricter guidelines on machine calibration to be introduced...|$|R

40|$|Automatic and {{semi-automatic}} {{surface irrigation}} structures and systems {{are being developed}} to improve irrigation water management and conservation on the farm. Most mechanized structures may be classified as fully automatic or semiautomatic depending upon their method of operation. A fully automatic system operates without attention from the operator other than periodic inspections from one irrigation to the next. The need for irrigation and often the irrigation time periods, however, are still largely determined by the irrigator who usually has to turn water into the system. The semi-automatic system uses gates and checks which are normally tripped at a preset time by a <b>mechanical</b> <b>timer</b> or electrically. In addition to determining the need for irrigation, the irrigator also manually resets the structures or moves them from one location to another, or both, prior to each irrigation.

Precision is attained to within 1 min when used in the circadian mode or to within 16. 7 msec when used at the highest speed (60 Hz). The {{electronic timer}} is useful for behavioral studies, control of environmental chambers, and control of general laboratory appliances. Timers that switch electrical devices on and off are useful for automatic control of lamps, heaters, humidifiers, and other equipment in environmental chambers. Timers are also useful in many behavioral and physiological studies of organisms in which {{the presence or absence}} of various light, sound, temperature, and chemical stimuli in precise sequences and combinations is required. Commercial timers are generally limited to only two on-off switches per day or, at most, to switching every other hour. <b>Mechanical</b> <b>timers</b> are motor driven, so that the exact moment of switching is difficult to adjust with precision, thus causing inaccuracy in synchronous switching of multiple electrical devices.

50|$|Timing relays are {{arranged}} for an intentional delay in operating their contacts. A very short (a {{fraction of a}} second) delay would use a copper disk between the armature and moving blade assembly.
