40|$|Batch and {{greenhouse}} {{experiments were}} conducted {{to examine the effects}} of Fenton process on transformation of roxarsone in soils and its resulting impacts on the growth of and As uptake by a rice plant cultivar. The results show that addition of Fenton reagent markedly accelerated the degradation of roxarsone and produced arsenite, which was otherwise absent in the soil without added Fenton <b>reagent.</b> <b>Methylation</b> of arsenate was also enhanced by Fenton process in the earlier part of the experiment due to abundant supply of arsenate from Roxarsone degradation. Overall, addition of Fenton reagent resulted in the predominant presence of arsenate in the soils. Fenton process significantly improved the growth of rice in the maturity stage of the first crop, The concentration of methylated As species in the rice plant tissues among the different growth stages was highly variable. Addition of Fenton reagent into the soils led to reduced uptake of soil-borne As by the rice plants and this had a significant effect on reducing the accumulation of As in rice grains. The findings have implications for understanding As biogeochemistry in paddy rice field receiving rainwater-borne H 2 O 2 and for development of mitigation strategies to reduce accumulation of As in rice grains...|$|R
40|$|Dimethylformamide dimethylacetal (DMFDMA) {{is widely}} used {{as a source of}} electrophilic one-carbon units at the formic acid {{oxidation}} level; however, electrophilic <b>methylation</b> with this <b>reagent</b> is previously unreported. Reaction of anthranilamide with DMFDMA at 150 degrees C for short periods gives mainly quinazolin- 4 -one. However, prolonged reaction with dimethylformamide di(primary-alkyl) acetals leads to subsequent alkylation at N 3. 3 -Substituted anthranilamides give 8 -substituted 3 -alkylquinazolin- 4 -ones. Condensation of anthranilamides with dimethylacetamide dimethylacetal provides 2, 3 -dimethylquinazolin- 4 -ones. In these reactions, the source of the N 3 -alkyl group is the O-alkyl group of the orthoamides. By contrast, reaction with the more sterically crowded dimethylformamide di(isopropyl) acetal diverts the alkylation to the oxygen, giving 4 -isopropoxyquinazolines, along with N 3 -methylquinazolin- 4 -ones where the methyl is derived from N-Me of the orthoamides. Reaction of anthranilamide with the highly sterically demanding dimethylformamide di(t-butyl) acetal gives largely quinazolin- 4 -one, whereas dimethylformamide di(neopentyl) acetal forms a mixture of quinazolin- 4 -one and N 3 -methylquinazolin- 4 -one. The observations are rationalised in terms of formation of intermediate cationic electrophiles (alkoxymethylidene-N,N-dimethylammonium) by thermal elimination of the corresponding alkoxide from the orthoamides. These are the first observations of orthoamides as direct alkylating agents...|$|R
40|$|Trimethylaluminum is a {{versatile}} <b>methylation</b> <b>reagent</b> in organic synthesis. However, {{because of its}} pyrophoric nature, it cannot be handled in open air. Developed by the Woodward group (University of Nottingham, U.

40|$|Introduction [11 C]choline {{is a very}} {{effective}} PET radiopharma-ceutical {{for the study of}} prostate cancer. To support the increasing demand for [11 C]choline, several different synthetic approaches have been described in the literature, including different automated production methods using remote-controlled synthesis modules [1 – 4]. The most popular method uses a C 18 Sep-Pak as solid support for methylation and, subsequently, a CM Sep-Pak for purification [2]. We report an optimized method for producing [11 C]choline using only one CM Sep-Pak for both reaction and purification as was shown in the literature [4]. For synthesis of [11 C]choline we used two modules Tracerlab FXC for preparation of <b>methylation</b> <b>reagent</b> [11 C]CH 3 I and GPF- 101 for [11 C]choline synthesis. Material and Methods TracerlabFXC GE, GPF- 101 Veenstra Instrument, 2 -(dimethylamino) -ethanol (DMAE) ABX, Sep-Pak Light Accell Plus CM cation-exchange cartridges Waters used without conditioning, precursor 50 µL of DMAE dissolved in 25 µL of ethanol and loaded on a CM Sep-Pak. Schematic diagram of the automated system for the production of [11 C]choline is given below. [11 C]CH 4 was produced in two standard Nitra target IBA irradiation of mixture 90 % N 2 / 10 % H 2 with 15 MeV protons using dual beam. Results and Conclusion [11 C]CH 4 was prepared in the targets and connected with Tracerlab FXC. [11 C]CH 3 I was pre-pared in a loop in which allowed to react of elemental iodine at a temperature 720 oC. Con-version to [11 C]CH 3 I usually is around 50 % uncorrected activity. Activity is within the range 15 – 18 GBq of [11 C]CH 3 I and time of production 10 min. Synthesis of [11 C]choline is based on the reaction DMAE with [11 C]CH 3 I on a Accell Plus CM cation-exchange column which serves both as a support for reaction and for separation of choline from DMAE by ethanol washing. The basic parameters are shown in TABLE 1. Beam current 2 X			 20 µA Irradiation time 			 30 min DMAE 				 50 µl Synthesis time from EOB 		 25 min Absolute yield without correction	 6. 6 GBq Radiochemical purity	 	 > 99 % Residual DMAE in product	 	< 5 ppm Ethanol				 < 1000 mg/L pH 				 4. 5 – 8. 5 TABLE 1. Reaction parameters and result of production of [11 C]choline syntheses Conclusion We have applied a simple synthesis method for [11 C]choline preparation using automated commercial equipments with one column used both for reaction and separation purpose. The main advantage of using one column is lower contamination of the product [11 C]choline with DMAE. When for synthesis of [11 C]choline two columns C 18 for synthesis and CM for separation is used, higher contamination of DMAE {{can be found in the}} product due to a release of DMAE from C 18 column...|$|E
