We propose a logical formalism based on epistemic logic that this agent can use to represent `for herself 2 ̆ 7 the surrounding world. We call this modeling approach the subjective approach.

40|$|The {{discovery}} and exploration of Supersymmetry in a model-independent fashion {{will be a}} daunting task due to {{the large number of}} soft-breaking parameters in the MSSM. In this paper, we explore the capability of the ATLAS detector at the LHC ($\sqrt s= 14 $ TeV, 1 fb$^{- 1 }$) to find SUSY within the 19 -dimensional pMSSM subspace of the MSSM using their standard transverse missing energy and long-lived particle searches that were essentially designed for mSUGRA. To this end, we employ a set of $\sim 71 $k previously generated <b>model</b> <b>points</b> in the 19 -dimensional parameter space that satisfy all of the existing experimental and theoretical constraints. Employing ATLAS-generated SM backgrounds and following their approach in each of 11 missing energy analyses as closely as possible, we explore all of these $ 71 $k <b>model</b> <b>points</b> for a possible SUSY signal. To test our analysis procedure, we first verify that we faithfully reproduce the published ATLAS results for the signal distributions for their benchmark mSUGRA <b>model</b> <b>points.</b> We then show that, requiring all sparticle masses to lie below 1 (3) TeV, almost all(two-thirds) of the pMSSM <b>model</b> <b>points</b> are discovered with a significance $S> 5 $ in {{at least one of these}} 11 analyses assuming a 50 \% systematic error on the SM background. If this systematic error can be reduced to only 20 \% then this parameter space coverage is increased. These results are indicative that the ATLAS SUSY search strategy is robust under a broad class of Supersymmetric models. We then explore in detail the properties of the kinematically accessible <b>model</b> <b>points</b> which remain unobservable by these search analyses in order to ascertain problematic cases which may arise in general SUSY searches.

50|$|Each dendridic {{section is}} {{subdivided}} into segments, which are typically seen as uniform circular cylinders or tapered circular cylinders. In the traditional compartmental <b>model,</b> <b>point</b> process location is determined only to an accuracy of half segment length. This {{will make the}} model solution particularly sensitive to segment boundaries. The accuracy of the traditional approach for this reason is O(1/n) when a point current and synaptic input is present. Usually the trans-membrane current where the membrane potential is known is represented in the model at points, or nodes and {{is assumed to be}} at the center. The new approach partitions the effect of the input by distributing it to the boundaries of the segment. Hence any input is partitioned between the nodes at the proximal and distal boundaries of the segment. Therefore, this procedure makes sure that the solution obtained is not sensitive to small changes in location of these boundaries because it affects how the input is partitioned between the nodes. When these compartments are connected with continuous potentials and conservation of current at segment boundaries then a new compartmental model of a new mathematical form is obtained. This new approach also provides a model identical to the traditional model but an order more accurate. This model increases the accuracy and precision by an order of magnitude than that is achieved by point process input.|$|E

A global Bayesian analysis is performed, incorporating results from a broad range of CMS supersymmetry searches, as well as constraints from other experiments.
