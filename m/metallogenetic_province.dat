40|$|The Hercynian cycle, {{starting}} in Late Precambrian times and terminated {{at the end}} of the Palaeozoic, is associated in the Iberian Peninsula with the deposition of a wide variety of metallic and nonmetallic mineral resources. The most famous of these are the base-metal sulphides of the Iberian Pyrite Belt (Rio Tinto and other deposits), tin and tungsten (Panasqueira), and mercury (Almadén). The depositional stage of the Hercynian cycle saw the accumulation of syngenetic mineral deposits, resulting from the interplay of palaeogeographical, sedimentary and volcanic controls. During and after the following orogenic stage, epigenetic minerals originated through magmatic activity, mostly as direct deposits from magmatic-derived fluids and also indirectly through thermal activation of existing rock. In both stages felsic magmatism was the dominant agent of mineralization, both for the more important volcanogenic and for the plutonic mineral deposits. Framework and evolution of Hercynian mineralization are defined by the geotectonic intraplate — not plate-margin – setting of the Meseta and by its palaeogeographical and structural development during the cycle, modified by regional and local factors, foremost among which are volcanic and plutonic heat and mass transfer. <b>Metallogenetic</b> <b>provinces</b> and epochs are distinguished, metallotects outlined, and possible sources for the introduced ore elements discussed...|$|R

40|$|Mining in the Iberian Pyrite Belt (IPB), {{the biggest}} VMS <b>metallogenetic</b> <b>province</b> {{known in the}} world to date, has to face a deep crisis in spite of the huge {{reserves}} still known after ≈ 5 000 years of production. This is due to several factors, as the difficult processing of complex Cu-Pb-Zn-Ag- Au ores, the exhaustion of the oxidation zone orebodies (the richest for gold, in gossan), the scarce demand for sulphuric acid in the world market, and harder environmental regulations. Of these factors, only the first and the last mentioned can be addressed by local ore geologists. A reactivation of mining can therefore only be achieved by an improved and more efficient ore processing, under the constraint of strict environmental controls. Digital image analysis of the ores, coupled to reflected light microscopy, provides a quantified and reliable mineralogical and textural characterization of the ores.

The mineralogical analyses were performed by X-Ray diffraction and electron microscopy. The obtained results showed the extraordinary abundance of aluminum sulfates with acicular habit, from the series pickeringite-apjhonite-halotrichite. They form typical assemblages with other aluminum sulfates, such as alunogen and tamarugite, and with the Mg sulfates: epsomite and hexahydrite. Moreover, the paragenetic relationships indicate the late occurrence of acicular Alsulfates from the halotrichite group.

40|$|This work {{presents}} a methodology {{based on the}} joint use of geostatistical and image analysis techniques applied to map thematic areas - geology or favorability areas {{from the point of}} view of mineral resources occurrence. The methodology makes use of information from geochemical and mineralogical data analysis of samples produced by exploration surveys and from Landsat T M remote sensing imagery. For interpretation there is a need to compare maps coming from the classification procedure which are built from quantitative data and based on qualitative data. Instead of establishing simple spatial relationships between them, a criterion of degree of similarity between the shape and the neighbourhood relationships of the respective coding indicator variables (geochemical and T M imagery) and those presented by the qualitative thematic variables (geology) is proposed. The methodology is tested in a target area within the Moura-Ficalho region, located in the Alentejo, in the South of Portugal, at the Magnetic-Zinciferous belt, <b>metallogenetic</b> <b>province</b> within the Ossa Morena Zone.

40|$|THE Borborema <b>metallogenetic</b> <b>province</b> in {{north-eastern}} Brazil, extending over {{parts of}} Paraiba and Rio Grande do Norte states, {{is well known}} due to its mineral riches. This note sums up studies made on the bismuth minerals found there. Mineralization of bismuth is observed both in the pegmatites that cut the mica schists of the Serido formation, and in the skarnites and tactites of the Middle Parelhas formation, both of them belonging to the Cears series of the Algonkian period. The minerals include native bismuth, bismuthinite, bismutite, bismutotantalite, bismoclite, arseno-bismite, and some doubtful species. Native bismuth is found as masses in pegmatites and as an accessory in tactites, recovered in the latter during the concentration of scheelite in Brejui Mine near Currais Novos, Rio Grande do Norte state. Masses weighing up to 13 Kg {{have been found in}} the Boqueir~o pegmatite near Parelhas in the same state.

40|$|In {{order to}} improve our {{understanding}} of poorly studied Mexican Porphyry Copper Deposits in the SW regional <b>metallogenetic</b> <b>province,</b> a detailed study of the hydrothermal fluid evolution of La Caridad porphyry copper-molybdenum deposit, and its connection to a high sulfidation epithermal deposit, was performed using oxygen, hydrogen and sulfur stable isotopes combined with fluid inclusion studies. In addition, UPb and Re-Os geochronology from La Caridad, Milpillas and El Arco porphyry deposit were performed to constrain the timing of mineralization and magmatism in northwest Mexico. Uranium-lead zircon ages from La Caridad suggest {{a short period of}} magmatism, between 55. 5 and 53. 0 Ma. Re-Os molybdenite ages from potassic and phyllic hydrothermal veins yielded identical ages within error, 53. 6 ± 0. 3 Ma and 53. 8 ± 0. 3 Ma, respectively. Four stages of hypogene alteration and mineralization are recognized at La Caridad porphyry copper deposit. The isotopic composition of the water in equilibrium with hydrothermal alteration minerals is consistent with highly evaporated lacustrine waters mixed with magmatic waters or vapor separated from magmatic fluids, however, sulfur isotopes and fluid inclusions data support the lacustrine-magmatic water hypothesis. Milpillas porphyry copper deposit in the Cananea Mining District, yielded a crystallization age of 63. 9 ± 1. 3 Ma. Two Re-Os molybdenite ages yielded an identical age of 63. 1 ± 0. 4 Ma, Suggesting a restricted period of mineralization. Re-Os data indicate that mineralization in Cananea District, spanned ~ 4 m. y. in three discrete pulses at ~ 59 Ma, ~ 61 Ma and ~ 63 Ma.

40|$|The Central African Copperbelt is an {{exceptionally}} rich <b>metallogenetic</b> <b>province</b> in theDemocratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and Zambia. Decades of research yielded avast amount of knowledge concerning {{the formation of}} the various ore deposits. However, the source of the ore metals is still not well understood. Manyauthors refer in a rather vague manner to the igneous or metamorphic basementunderlying the deposits as the metal source. This research therefore focuses onthe origin of the ore metals in the Copperbelt deposits. A promising way of relating an ore deposit with its metal source, is to compare the Sr andNd isotopic composition of potential source rocks, and the gangue minerals thatare associated with the ore minerals. This concept has been systematicallyapplied to stratiform Cu-Co deposits in the DRC (i. e. Kamoto, Kambove West, andLuiswishi) and Zambia (i. e. Nkana and Konkola). The role of Co in these depositsis crucial with respect to the metal sources and is discussed in detail. Nextto the stratiform deposits, two vein-type Cu-Zn-Pb mineralisations in the DRC(i. e. Dikulushi and Kipushi) were also used as case studiesThe study has been designed to solve three research questions. The first question iswhether the metal sources for the case study deposits can be constrained usingthe isotopic signature approach. The second question asks what the differencesare between the stratiform Cu-Co deposits in the DRC and Zambia, and how theyrelate to their sources. The last question addresses the possible applicationof ore sulphide trace element compositions in the search of the ore metal sources. The analytical equipment used to determine the major and minor element compositionof basement samples was an Inductively Coupled Plasma Optical EmissionSpectrometer (ICP-OES). The Sr and Nd isotopic signature of these samples, andof gangue carbonates from the different case studies, was characterised with aMulti-Collector Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometer (MC-ICP-MS). Theore sulphide element composition was measured with an Electron ProbeMicroanalyser (EPMA). For the stratiform Cu-Co deposits in the Katanga Copperbelt (i. e. the Congolese part ofthe Central African Copperbelt), gangue carbonates of the diageneticmineralisation phase display variable Sr and Nd isotopic compositions. The lownumber of samples available and their variable isotopic signatures make itdifficult to relate them to a specific basement unit. In addition, the basementdirectly below the Katanga Copperbelt is unknown. However, the isotopiccomposition of the diagenetic gangue carbonates generally corresponds with thesignature of felsic basement rocks. Nevertheless, the high Co content of thesedeposits is most likely derived from mafic basement rocks. Syn-orogenicmineralisation in Katanga resulted from remobilisation of diagenetic sulphides. This caused homogeneous radiogenic isotope ratios and an ore mineral assemblagesimilar to the diagenetic phase. A small new metal contribution from felsicbasement rocks might be indicated by the isotopic composition of some samplesfrom the Kamoto deposit. This contribution is likely still detectable becauseof the relatively low metamorphic grade that was reached at Kamoto. The pre- to syn-kinematic mineralisation phase at the Zambian stratiform Cu-Co depositscontains gangue carbonates with isotopic compositions that correspond withfelsic rocks of the Domes Region. However, the isotopic signatures of the Nkanaand Konkola deposits differ slightly, indicating that the ore metals wereleached from Domes Region basement rocks occurring close to each deposit. Thegangue minerals of the successive syn-kinematic mineralisation phase haveisotopic compositions resembling the earlier mineralisation phase at eachdeposit. Remobilisation of the precursor ore minerals most likely occurredduring the syn-kinematic mineralisation. Because of the appearance of Co and Nisulphides in the late-kinematic phase at Nkana, a new source probably providedthese metals to the ore forming fluid. Nevertheless, the isotopic signaturesfrom gangue carbonates associated with the late-kinematic phase do not reflectthis new source and are similar to the gangue signatures of the earlier phases. The gangue carbonates of the Cu-Co deposits in the DRC have clearly different isotopicsignatures than in Zambia. In the DRC, 87 Sr/ 86 Sr ratiosof the gangue minerals are lower and the eNd values are higher. Two other majordifferences between the Katanga and Zambian Copperbelts are the higher Coconcentrations in Katangan deposits, and the carbonate-dominated host rocks inthe DRC versus the mainly siliciclastic host rocks in Zambia. Thesedissimilarities are in line with each other and strongly suggest that thesource rocks for the Katanga deposits included an important mafic component. Unfortunately, the scarse information about the basement in Katanga does notallow to indicate a specific source rock. If the isotopic compositions ofgangue carbonates of all stratiform deposits in the DRC are consideredtogether, they appear to lie on a vertical trend in the Sr-eNd isotopic space. The endmembers of this trend may represent on one side felsic rocks similar tothe felsic rocks of the Domes Region, {{and on the other side}} unknown mafic rockssituated in the Katanga subsurface. In analogy to the local sources for theNkana and Konkola deposits, local basement rocks (including mafic rocks) arethe most plausible metal source for the Katanga deposits. The other important difference concerns the host rock type. The siliciclastics in Zambiacould have influenced the isotopic composition of the gangue carbonates of theNkana and Konkola deposits. This is especially so for the Rb-Sr isotopicsystem, which is prone to remobilisation and alteration. However, it is arguedthat it would not change the interpretation of the Domes Regionfelsic rocks asmetal source for these deposits. Firstly, previous research has shown that thesedimentary Katanga Supergroup rocks, which host the ore bodies, did notcontain the required metal budget to be a viable metal source for the knowndeposits. Secondly, the metasedimentary rocks were derived from the underlyingDomes Region basement (i. e. the interpreted metal source), which would resultin similar isotopic compositions for the host rocks as for this basement. Hence, even if the siliciclastic rocks influenced the isotopic composition ofthe mineralising fluid and gangue carbonates of the Zambian deposits, the mainmetal source was the local basement. The difference in Co concentrations and related isotopic signatures between theKatanga and Zambian stratiform deposits is clear. However, a similar but moresubtle effect is recognised for the Nkana and Konkola deposits in the ZambianCopperbelt. The Nkana deposit contains more Co and its gangue minerals havehigher eNd values and lower 87 Sr/ 86 Sr ratios than theKonkola deposit. Mixing calculations indicate that the metal source for Nkanamust have contained at least 5 % more mafic rocks than the metal source for theKonkola deposit. Co is absent in the stratiform Cu deposits at thenorth-eastern side of the Kafue Anticline. Hence, the mafic rocks that couldhave provided Co to the Zambian deposits probably occur at the south-western sideof the Kafue Anticline (i. e. close to case study deposits). For the vein-type Cu-Ag and Cu-Zn deposits of Dikulushi and Kipushi (DRC),respectively, very high eNd signatures were found. This concurs with thepresence of mafic rocks at each mineralisation site, i. e. gabbros within theAxial Breccia of the Kipushi anticline, and basalts in a breccia observed inthe Dikulushi mine. Nevertheless, the required mafic rocks could equally residein the deep subsurface. The gangue minerals of the syn-orogenic mineralisationat Dikulushi lie on a trend between the isotopic compositions of the GombelaSubgroup host rocks and a required mafic component. Mixing calculations demonstratethat a mixture of both metal sources could easily have yielded the isotopiccompositions of the gangue minerals. In contrast with the very 'mafic' isotopicsignature of the Kipushi gangue carbonates, previous research on fluidinclusions has suggested a felsic source rock. The possible influence of felsicbasement rocks on the isotopic composition of the gangue carbonates has beenassessed. If all measured variation in the eNd values is explained in terms ofmore or less influence of felsic rocks, about 10 % more felsic rock contributionis needed to explain the lowest eNd signature compared to the highest. Nevertheless, mafic rocks must have been the dominant rock type determining theisotopic signatures at the Kipushi deposit. Microprobe analysis of the ore sulphides has shown that the intracrystalline trace elementvariability is about as largeas the intercrystalline variability for the casestudy deposits. This hampers the applicability of this technique tocharacterise sulphides from different mineralisation phases. In addition, fewsystematic differences were found between the case studies, which could havebeen expected for the typical 'mafic' elements Co, Cr or Ni. However,chalcopyrites from the late-kinematic mineralisation phase at Nkana haveslightly higher concentrations of Co than chalcopyrites from the two earliermineralisation phases at Nkana. This is in agreement with the input of 'mafic'metals during this mineralisation phase. Moreover, the Ge concentration wasmarkably low for sulphides from the Nkana deposit, whereas the highest Ge andAg levels were found for samples from the Dikulushi deposit. More in general, the results of this research show that the Sr and Nd isotopicsignatures of gangue carbonates are a valuable tool for constraining the metalsource(s) of sulphide ore deposits. The right basement unit and source rocktype can be determined by comparing the gangue mineral signatures with theisotopic composition of basement rocks. For the Central African Copperbelt, thelocal basement beneath or surrounding the different ore deposits has shown tobe the most likely metal source to these deposits. With regard to the role ofCo, the Co-rich deposits did also display characteristic isotopic signatures,and strongly support the existence of (still unknown) mafic bodies in thebasement that provided the Co to the mineralising fluids. For subsequentmineralisation phases, usually related to the Lufilian orogenesis, theimportance of remobilisation of ore metals is emphasised. The next step forwardin this research domain will be the detailed charactarisation of the localbasement beneath the ore deposits, in order to relate the geochemical signatureof each ore deposit with specific rock units. <w:latentstyles deflockedstate="false" defunhidewhenused="true"  <w:lsdexception="" locked="false" priority=" 0 " semihidden="false"
