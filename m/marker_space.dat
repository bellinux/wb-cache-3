40|$|Abstract. Understanding {{the basis}} of human {{movement}} and reproducing it in robotic environments is a compelling challenge that has engaged a multidisciplinary audience. In addressing this challenge, an important initial step involves reconstructing motion from experimental motion capture data. To this end we propose a new algorithm to reconstruct human motion from motion capture data through direct control of captured marker trajectories. This algorithm {{is based on a}} task/posture decomposition and prioritized control approach. This approach ensures smooth tracking of desired marker trajectories as well as the extraction of joint angles in real-time without the need for inverse kinematics. It also provides flexibility over traditional inverse kinematic approaches. Our algorithm was validated on a sequence of tai chi motions. The results demonstrate the efficacy of the direct marker control approach for motion reconstruction from experimental marker data.

To improve the productivity, genetic improvement through breeding is essential. A linkage map {{is an important component}} in molecular breeding. We established a first-generation linkage map using a mapping panel containing two backcross populations with 93 progeny. We mapped 506 markers (216 microsatellites and 290 SNPs from ESTs) onto 11 linkage groups. The total length of the map was 1440. 9 cM with an average <b>marker</b> <b>space</b> of 2. 8 cM. Blasting of 222 Jatropha ESTs containing polymorphic SSR or SNP markers against EST-databases revealed that 91. 0 %, 86. 5 % and 79. 2 % of Jatropha ESTs were homologous to counterparts in castor bean, poplar and Arabidopsis respectively. Mapping 192 orthologous markers to the assembled whole genome sequence of Arabidopsis thaliana identified 38 syntenic blocks and revealed that small linkage blocks were well conserved, but often shuffled. The first generation linkage map and the data of comparative mapping could lay a solid foundation for QTL mapping of agronomic traits, marker-assisted breeding and cloning genes responsible for phenotypic variation...|$|E

The advantage of using interval mapping as compared to single-marker analysis was slight. ``Resolving power'' of a marker-QTL linkage experiment was defined as the 95 % confidence interval for the QTL map location that would be obtained when scoring an infinite number of markers. It was found that reducing <b>marker</b> <b>spacing</b> below the resolving power did not add appreciably to narrowing the confidence interval.

Populations under random selection, under selection among full-sib families, and under selection within a full-sib family were simulated each with heritability of 0. 3, 0. 5, and 0. 7. They were analyzed with the <b>marker</b> <b>spacing</b> of 10 cM and 20 cM. The accuracy for QTL detection decreased for the populations under selection within full-sib family. Estimates of QTL effects and positions differed (P,. 05) from their input values. The problems could be ignored when mapping a QTL for the populations under selection among full-sib families. A large heritability helped reduction of such problems. When the animals were selected within a full-sib family, the QTL was detected for the populations with heritability of 0. 5 or larger using the <b>marker</b> <b>spacing</b> of 10 cM, and with heritability of 0. 7 using the <b>marker</b> <b>spacing</b> of 20 cM.

40|$|Abstract. Reconstructing human motion {{dynamics}} in real-time is a challenging problem since it requires accurate motion sensing, subject specific models, and efficient reconstruction algorithms. A promising {{approach is to}} construct accurate human models, and control them to behave {{the same way the}} subject does. Here, we demonstrate that the whole-body control approach can efficiently reconstruct a subject’s motion {{dynamics in}} real world task-space when given a scaled model and marker based motion capture data. We scaled a biomechanically realistic musculoskeletal model to a subject, captured motion with suitably placed markers, and used an operational space controller to directly track the motion of the markers with the model. Our controller tracked the positions, velocities, and accelerations of many markers in parallel by assigning them to tasks with different priority levels based on how free their parent limbs were. We executed lower priority marker tracking tasks in the successive null spaces of the higher priority tasks to resolve their interdependencies. The controller accurately reproduced the subject’s full body dynamics while executing a throwing motion in near real time. Its reconstruction closely matched the marker data, and its performance was consistent for the entire motion. Our findings suggest that the direct marker tracking approach is an attractive tool to reconstruct and synthesize the dynamic motion of humans and other complex articulated body systems in a computationally efficient manner.

However, they were not enough for its breeding. In this work, Saccharina longissima (♀) and Saccharina japonica (♂), which showed obvious differences in morphology and genetics, were applied in hybridization to yield the F 2 mapping population with 102 individuals. Using these 102 F 2 hybrids, the genetic linkage map of Saccharina was constructed by MapMaker software based on 37 amplified fragment length polymorphisms (AFLPs), 22 sequence-related amplified polymorphisms (SRAPs) and 139 simple sequence repeats (SSRs) markers. Meanwhile, QTL analysis was performed for six economic traits. The linkage map constructed in this research consisted of 422 marker loci (137 AFLPs, 57 SRAPs and 228 SSRs), which formed 45 linkage groups (LGs) with an average <b>marker</b> <b>space</b> of 7. 92 cM; they spanned a total length of 2233. 1 cM, covering the whole estimated genome size.

40|$|Abstract Four global algorithms, maximum {{likelihood}} (ML), sum of adjacent LOD score (SALOD), sum of adjacent recombinant fractions (SARF) and product of adjacent recombinant fraction (PARF), and one approx-imation algorithm, seriation (SER), {{were used to}} compare the marker ordering efficiencies for correctly given linkage groups based on doubled haploid (DH) popula-tions. The Monte Carlo simulation results indicated the marker ordering powers for the five methods were almost identical. High correlation coefficients were greater than 0. 99 between grouping power and ordering power, indicating that all these methods for marker ordering were reliable. Therefore, the main problem for linkage analysis was how to improve the grouping power. Since the SER approach provided the advantage of speed without losing ordering power, this approach was used for detailed simulations. For more generality, multiple link-age groups were employed, and population size, linkage cutoff criterion, <b>marker</b> <b>spacing</b> pattern (even or uneven), and <b>marker</b> <b>spacing</b> distance (close or loose) were considered for obtaining acceptable grouping powers. Simulation results indicated that the grouping power was related to population size, <b>marker</b> <b>spacing</b> distance, and cutoff criterion. Generally, a large population size provided higher grouping power than small population size, and closely linked markers provided higher grouping power than loosely linked markers. The cutoff criterion range for achieving acceptable grouping power and ordering power differed for varying cases; however, combining all situations in this study, a cutoff criterion ranging from 50 cM to 60 cM was recommended for achieving acceptable grouping power and ordering power for different cases...|$|R

Using analytic methods and computer simulation, we compared the ordering accuracy of three multipoint statistical methods: minimum breaks (MB), maximum likelihood (ML), and maximum posterior probability (PP). For 8, 12, and 16 markers and all combinations of numbers of hybrids, retention patterns, and marker spacings considered, the probabilities that the true order is identified as the best order were considerably higher with the ML and PP methods than with the MB method. ML and PP performed similarly, but PP tended to give slightly greater support for the best order than did ML. Our results can be used as guidelines for determining sample size requirements and optimal <b>marker</b> <b>spacing</b> for future RH mapping experiments.

40|$|Abstract Background Gradual or sudden {{transitions}} {{among different}} states as exhibited by cell populations in a biological sample under particular conditions or stimuli {{can be detected}} and profiled by flow cytometric time course data. Often such temporal profiles contain features due to transient states that present unique modeling challenges. These could range from asymmetric non-Gaussian distributions to outliers and tail subpopulations, which need to be modeled with precision and rigor. Results To ensure precision and rigor, we propose a parametric modeling framework StateProfiler based on finite mixtures of skew t -Normal distributions that are robust against non-Gaussian features caused by asymmetry and outliers in data. Further, we present in StateProfiler a new greedy EM algorithm for fast and optimal model selection. The parsimonious approach of our greedy algorithm allows us to detect the genuine dynamic variation in the key features as and when they appear in time course data. We also present a procedure to construct a well-fitted profile by merging any redundant model components {{in a way that}} minimizes change in entropy of the resulting model. This allows precise profiling of unusually shaped distributions and less well-separated features that may appear due to cellular heterogeneity even within clonal populations. Conclusions By modeling flow cytometric data measured over time course and <b>marker</b> <b>space</b> with StateProfiler, specific parametric characteristics of cellular states can be identified. The parameters are then tested statistically for learning global and local patterns of spatio-temporal change. We applied StateProfiler to identify the temporal features of yeast cell cycle progression based on knockout of S-phase triggering cyclins Clb 5 and Clb 6, and then compared the S-phase delay phenotypes due to differential regulation of the two cyclins. We also used StateProfiler to construct the temporal profile of clonal divergence underlying lineage selection in mammalian hematopoietic progenitor cells. </p...|$|E
40|$|A multimarker {{linkage disequilibrium}} mapping method was {{developed}} for the fine mapping of quantitative trait loci (QTL) using a dense marker map. The method compares the expected covariances between haplotype effects given a postulated QTL position to the covariances that {{are found in the}} data. The expected covariances between the haplotype effects are proportional to the probability that the QTL position is identical by descent (IBD) given the marker haplotype information, which is calculated using the genedropping method. Simulation results showed that a QTL was correctly positioned within a region of 3, 1. 5, or 0. 75 cM in 70, 62, and 68 %, respectively, of the replicates using <b>markers</b> <b>spaced</b> at intervals of 1, 0. 5, and 0. 25 cM, respectively. These results were rather insensitive to the number of generations since the QTL occurred and to the effective population size, except that 10 generations yielded rather poor estimates of the QTL position. The position estimates of this multimarker disequilibrium mapping method were more accurate than those from a single marker transmission disequilibrium test.

Depending on the marker position the expansion may partially offset the compaction, especially in the CL scenario with a very low permeable clay. To obtain a representative field compaction the markers should span a depth interval made mostly by sand and entirely depleted, and should be installed in a test hole far from producing wells.

We have previously hypothesized that CHARGE syndrome could be caused by unidentified genomic microdeletion, but no such deletion was detected using short tandem repeat (STR) <b>markers</b> <b>spaced</b> an average of 5 cM apart. Recently, microdeletion at 8 q 12 locus was reported in two patients with CHARGE, although point mutation in CHD 7 on chromosome 8 was the underlying etiology {{in most of the}} affected patients. METHODS:We have extended our previous study by employing a much higher density of SNP markers (3258) with an average spacing of approximately 800 kb. These SNP markers are diallelic and, therefore, have much different properties for detection of deletions than STRs. RESULTS:A global error rate estimate was produced based on Mendelian inconsistency. One marker, rs 431722 exceeded the expected frequency of inconsistencies, but no deletion could be demonstrated after retesting the 4 inconsistent pedigrees with local flanking markers or by FISH with the corresponding BAC clone. Expected deletion detection (EDD) was used to assess the coverage of specific intervals over the genome by deriving the probability of detecting a common loss of heterozygosity event over each genomic interval. This analysis estimated the fraction of unobserved deletions, taking into account the allele frequencies at the SNPs, the known <b>marker</b> <b>spacing</b> and sample size.

Extensive simulations showed that: (1) Standard error of QTL location (SEQTL) decreased when QTL effect (d) or population size (N) increased, but was constant for given "power factor" (PF = d(2) N); (2) increasing the proportion selected in the tails beyond 0. 25 had only a negligible effect on SEQTL; and (3) <b>marker</b> <b>spacing</b> in the target interval had a remarkably powerful effect on SEQTL, yielding a reduction of up to 10 -fold in going from highest (24 cM) to lowest (0. 29 cM) spacing at given population size and QTL effect.

40|$|Progressive {{myoclonus}} epilepsy of the Lafora type (Lafora's disease) is an {{autosomal recessive}} disease characterized by epilepsy, myoclonus, dementia, and periodic acid-Schiff-positive intracellular inclusion bodies. The inclusion deposits consist of branched polysaccharides (polyglucosans) but the responsible biochemical defect {{has not been}} identified. Onset is during late childhood or adolescence and the disease leads to a fatal outcome within a decade of first symptoms. We studied nine families in which Lafora's disease had been proven by biopsy {{in at least one}} member. In order to locate the responsible gene, we screened the human genome with microsatellite <b>markers</b> <b>spaced</b> an average of 13 cM. We used linkage analysis in all nine families and homozygosity map...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background CHARGE {{syndrome}} {{is a complex}} of birth defects including coloboma, choanal atresia, ear malformations and deafness, cardiac defects, and growth delay. We have previously hypothesized that CHARGE syndrome could be caused by unidentified genomic microdeletion, but no such deletion was detected using short tandem repeat (STR) <b>markers</b> <b>spaced</b> an average of 5 cM apart. Recently, microdeletion at 8 q 12 locus was reported in two patients with CHARGE, although point mutation in CHD 7 on chromosome 8 was the underlying etiology {{in most of the}} affected patients. Methods We have extended our previous study by employing a much higher density of SNP markers (3258) with an average spacing of approximately 800 kb. These SNP markers are diallelic and, therefore, have much different properties for detection of deletions than STRs. Results A global error rate estimate was produced based on Mendelian inconsistency. One marker, rs 431722 exceeded the expected frequency of inconsistencies, but no deletion could be demonstrated after retesting the 4 inconsistent pedigrees with local flanking markers or by FISH with the corresponding BAC clone. Expected deletion detection (EDD) was used to assess the coverage of specific intervals over the genome by deriving the probability of detecting a common loss of heterozygosity event over each genomic interval. This analysis estimated the fraction of unobserved deletions, taking into account the allele frequencies at the SNPs, the known <b>marker</b> <b>spacing</b> and sample size. Conclusions The results of our genotyping indicate that more than 35 % of the genome is included in regions with very low probability of a deletion of at least 2 Mb. </p...|$|R
40|$|An {{investigator}} {{planning a}} QTL (quantitative trait locus) experiment has {{to choose which}} strains to cross, the type of cross, genotyping strategies, {{and the number of}} progeny to raise and phenotype. To help make such choices, we have developed an interactive program for power and sample size calculations for QTL experiments, R/qtlDesign. Our software includes support for selective genotyping strategies, variable <b>marker</b> <b>spacing,</b> and tools to optimize information content subject to cost constraints for backcross, intercross, and recombinant inbred lines from two parental strains. We review the impact of experimental design choices on the variance attributable to a segregating locus, the residual error variance, and the effective sample size. We give examples of software usage in real-life settings. The software is available a...|$|R
40|$|Genomewide {{association}} {{studies may}} {{offer the best}} promise for genetic mapping of complex traits. Such studies in outbred populations require very densely spaced single-nucleotide polymorphisms. In recently founded population isolates, however, extensive linkage disequilibrium (LD) may make these studies feasible with currently available sets of short tandem repeat <b>markers,</b> <b>spaced</b> at intervals {{as large as a}} few centimorgans. We report the results of a genomewide association study of severe bipolar disorder (BP-I), using patients from the isolated population of the central valley of Costa Rica. We observed LD with BP-I on several chromosomes; the most striking results were in proximal 8 p, a region that has previously shown linkage to schizophrenia. This region could be important for severe psychiatric disorders, rather than for a specific phenotype...|$|R
40|$|Genomic {{selection}} (GS) is a DNA-based {{method of}} selecting for quantitative traits in {{animal and plant}} breeding, and offers a potentially superior alternative to traditional breeding methods that rely on pedigree and phenotype information. Using a 60 ¿K SNP chip with <b>markers</b> <b>spaced</b> throughout the entire chicken genome, we compared the impact of GS and traditional BLUP (best linear unbiased prediction) selection methods applied side-by-side in three different lines of egg-laying chickens. Differences were demonstrated between methods, both at the level and genomic distribution of allele frequency changes. In all three lines, the average allele frequency changes were larger with GS, 0. 056 0. 064 and 0. 066, compared with BLUP, 0. 044, 0. 045 and 0. 036 for lines B 1, B 2 and W 1, respectively. With BLUP, 35 selected regions (empirical...|$|R
40|$|Facioscapulohumeral muscular {{dystrophy}} (FSHMD) is a neuromuscular disorder characterized by autosomal dominant inheritance and clinical onset in {{the muscles of}} the face and shoulder girdle. Using a set of RFLP <b>markers</b> <b>spaced</b> at approximately 20 centimorgans, we have begun a systematic search for markers linked to the disease. A total of 81 RFLP loci on six autosomes (1, 2, 5, 7, 10, and 16) have been examined for linkage to FSHMD in 13 families. With the computer program CRI-MAP, two-point and multipoint analyses have not resulted in any LOD score indicative of linkage to FSHMD. However, these analyses have allowed us to exclude 909 centimorgans (sex average) of our genetic maps in intervals where the LOD score is less than – 2. 0. We estimate our data have excluded 23 % of the human genome...|$|R
40|$|The gene {{encoding}} A Disintegrin And Metalloprotease (ADAM) 33 was {{the first}} asthma susceptibility gene to be discovered by positional cloning. 1 In 460 families enriched with asthma, linkage analysis using microsatellite <b>markers</b> <b>spaced</b> 9 cM apart revealed a region on chromosome 20 p 13 that carried one or more asthma genes, achieving a Maximum Lod Score (MLS) of 2. 24 at 9. 99 cM. The addition of further markers at 1. 2 cM increased the MLS to 2. 94 at 12. 1 cM which further rose to 3. 93 when bronchial hyperresponsiveness {{was included in the}} definition of asthma despite halving the sample size, thereby exceeding the threshold for genome wide significance. Physical mapping, direct cDNA selection, and sequencing of DNA cloned into bacterial artificial chromosomes (BACs) identified 25 candidate genes...|$|R
