40|$|This {{research}} analyses upward long-wave {{radiation flux}} density from urban surfaces using a high-resolution thermal-infrared (TIR) camera and meteorological measurements {{in the city}} of Berlin, Germany. We report spatio-temporal patterns of the difference between upward long-wave radiation flux density from courtyard surfaces and the roof. Thermal patterns show persistence effects due to shadow, sky view factor (SVF) distribution, thermal properties of surface materials, human activities and turbulence characteristics of the surface-atmosphere interface. The attenuation of thermal patterns caused by temporary disturbances due to parked cars can be described by a <b>modified</b> <b>exponential</b> <b>curve</b> and a time-constant. This study shows that ground-based high-resolution TIR imagery is highly suitable to investigate dynamic processes controlling thermal patterns within a complex three-dimensional urban structure...|$|E

Among them, rural sports {{are one of the}} main factors. The paper starts from Chinese rural sports public service funding input prediction and current status analysis two aspects, and goes ahead with compre-hensive researches through trend extrapolation prediction model and statistical analysis method. Firstly, it utilizes trend extrapolation prediction’s <b>modified</b> <b>exponential</b> <b>curve</b> approach to make quantitative analysis of Chinese rural sports pub-lic service funds input from 2007 to 2012, and then predict Chinese rural sports funds input changes in five years. Sec-ondly, it makes use of statistical analysis to study Chinese rural sports public service funds input current status, and gets conclusions that the amplification of Chinese rural sports funds input occupied percentage in overall fiscal expenditure is not big, sports consciousness is not strong, sports facilities utilization is incomplete, sports activities places construction is imperfect, sports personnel management system is unsound, sports field and equipment maintenance is not formal, all of these are key problems that Chinese rural sports public service development should consider at present stage...|$|E

For both the wild and captive groups, {{there were significant differences}} between individuals in the growth parameters for both head and pes. However, {{there were no significant differences}} between the corresponding composite curves generated for the captive and wild macropodids.

30|$|All cores were {{mounted on}} grooved boards with glue and sanded using {{progressively}} finer sand papers. The first sanding {{was applied to}} flatten the cores, whereas the subsequent sanding episodes polished the cores for better visualization of the cross-sectional area (Speer 2012). The annual tree-ring widths of the cores were measured using a Lintab digital positioning table with a resolution of 1 / 100  mm (Rinn 2005). For cross-dating of the time-series, the software package TSAP-Win (Rinn 2003) was used and hereby checked for possible missing growth rings or measurement errors. Further analyses were carried out in R (R Core Team 2018) using package dplR (Bunn et al. 2015). With dplR, all tree-ring series were indexed using a double detrending process: first, <b>modified</b> negative <b>exponential</b> <b>curves</b> were applied followed by cubic smoothing splines (20  years rigidity, 50 % wavelength cutoff). The detrending was conducted to remove low frequency trends, which are age associated (Holmes et al. 1986; Gillner et al. 2014). The resulting detrended series were averaged using Tukey’s biweight robust mean to build a final chronology and chronologies for each category (all trees; urban, suburban, rural; center, north, east, west). As a result of detrending, standardized chronologies with a yearly ring width index (RWI) averaging around 1 were obtained. Values smaller than 1 indicate growth below normal, while values greater than 1 indicate growth higher than normal. For chronology building, the autocorrelation of every individual series was removed (maximum order: 3). This procedure of detrending ensured a removal of all long-term growth trends, thereby obtaining a chronology containing only tree ring variability with climate fluctuations (Cook and Holmes 1986; Gillner et al. 2013). The statistical validity of the chronologies was assessed using the expressed population signal (EPS) for the common period of the time series of all analyzed tree individuals.|$|R
40|$|One of {{the main}} {{elements}} of dendrochronological standardization is removing the biological trend, i. e. the progressive decline of ring width along a cross-sectional radius that is caused by the corresponding increase in stem size and tree age over time. The ‘‘conservative’’ option for removing this biological trend is to fit a <b>modified</b> negative <b>exponential</b> <b>curve</b> (or a straight line with slope ≤ 0) to the ring-width measurements. This method {{is based on the assumption}} that, especially for open-grown and/or shade-intolerant species, annual growth rate of mature trees fluctuates around a specific level, expressed by a constant ring width. Because this method has numerical and conceptual drawbacks, we propose an alternative approach based on the assumption that constant growth is expressed by a constant basal area increment distributed over a growing surface. From this starting point, we derive a mathematical expression for the biological trend of ring width, which can be easily calculated and used for dendrochronological standardization. The proposed C-method is compared to other standardization techniques, including Regional Curve Standardization (RCS), of tree-ring width from ponderosa pines (Pinus ponderosa Douglas ex P. Lawson & C. Lawson) located at the Gus Pearson Natural Area (GPNA) in northern Arizona, USA. Master ring-index chronologies built from ring area, RCS, and C-method reproduced stand-wide patterns of tree growth at the GPNA, whereas other standardization options, including the ‘‘conservative’’ one, failed to do so. In addition, the C-method has the advantage of calculating an expected growth curve for each tree, whereas RCS is based on applying the same growth curve to all trees. In conclusion, the C-method replaces the purely empirical ‘‘conservative’’ option with a theory based approach, which is applicable to individual ring-width measurement series, does not require fitting a growth curve using nonlinear regression, and can be rigorously tested for improving tree-ring records of environmental changes...|$|R

50|$|The {{distribution}} of failure times is over-laid with a <b>curve</b> representing an <b>exponential</b> distribution. For this example, the exponential distribution approximates the {{distribution of}} failure times. The <b>exponential</b> <b>curve</b> is a theoretical distribution fitted to the actual failure times. This particular <b>exponential</b> <b>curve</b> is specified by the parameter lambda, λ= 1/(mean time to failure) = 1/59.6 = 0.0168. The distribution of failure times is called the probability density function (pdf), if time can take any positive value. In equations, the pdf is specified as f(t). If time can only take discrete values (such as 1 day, 2 days, and so on), {{the distribution of}} failure times is called the probability mass function (pmf). Most survival analysis methods assume that time can take any positive value, and f(t) is the pdf. If the time between observed air conditioner failures is approximated using the exponential function, then the <b>exponential</b> <b>curve</b> gives the probability density function, f(t), for air conditioner failure times.|$|R
30|$|Our results {{indicate}} that the exponential model previously used by some authors and currently used for risk assessment in the EU [37],[71]-[77] is inferior to the power function in terms of goodness of fit.

The <b>exponential</b> <b>curve</b> used in the EU risk assessment underestimates deposition and, thus, underestimates exposure of non-target organisms, especially over a longer distance range. Consequently, previous risk assessments and conclusions regarding distances, potential exposure, and effects on non-target organisms should be revised in the light of these findings.|$|R
