40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to assess the effect of arm {{exercise}} on the heat balance in spinal cord-injured (SCI) individuals with complete lesions at ambient temperatures of 10 and 35 degrees C. Four SCI with a high lesion (> or = T 6) (SCI-H), seven with a low lesion (< T 6) (SCI-L), and ten able-bodied controls (AB) performed arm-cranking exercises at 40 % of the maximal power output for 45 min, once in 10 degrees C and once in 35 degrees C. Oxygen uptake, rectal temperature, and skin temperature (chest, upper arm, thigh, calf) were measured at rest and 15, 30, and 45 min after the onset of exercise. Metabolism, heat production, skin temperature, <b>mean</b> <b>body</b> <b>temperature</b> (a combination of rectal and skin temperature), and body heat content were calculated. Heart rate at 10 degrees C was 103 b/min in SCI-H, 120 in SCI-L and 112 in AB, while in 35 degrees C, heart rate was 112 b/min in SCI-H, 144 in SCI-L and 134 in AB. The increase in rectal temperature in 35 degrees C was larger in SCI-L (+ 0. 07 degrees C) and SCI-H (+ 0. 08 degrees C) than in AB (+ 0. 06 degrees C). The decrease in <b>mean</b> <b>body</b> <b>temperature</b> at 10 degrees C was larger in SCI-H (33. 0 +/- 0. 68 degrees C) than in SCI-L (33. 6 +/- 0. 29 degrees C) and AB (34. 5 +/- 0. 31 degrees C). During exercise in 35 degrees C, <b>mean</b> <b>body</b> <b>temperature</b> increased in all three groups. The increase in body temperature in SCI-L was larger than in AB. During exercise in 10 degrees C, body heat content decreased in SCI-H (80. 0 +/- 15. 1 kJ) and SCI-L (89. 2 +/- 9. 1 kJ) but remained constant in AB (97. 0 +/- 16. 1 kJ). During exercise in 35 degrees C, body heat content increased in all three groups. The increase in body heat content after exercising in 35 degrees C was not significantly different between the three groups. In summary, <b>mean</b> <b>body</b> <b>temperature</b> and body heat content in the cold decreased in SCI, despite exercising.

Sceloporus aeneus is oviparous, and has an elevation range of approximately 2400 - 3000 m. It is replaced at elevations above 3000 m by its viviparous sister species, S, bicanthalis, whose elevational range extends to at least 4250 m. Selected <b>body</b> <b>temperatures</b> (T-sel) were measured on a laboratory thermal gradient. <b>Mean</b> selected <b>body</b> <b>temperatures</b> of S. aeneus and S. bicanthalis were 35. 5 and 34. 9 C, respectively.

For neither species did selected <b>body</b> <b>temperature</b> vary as a function of sex or reproductive status of females. <b>Body</b> <b>temperatures</b> during activity in the field were not related to the time of year or the reproductive status of females, although male S, bicanthalis at one site had higher <b>body</b> <b>temperatures</b> than females.

40|$|Abstract. Pneumonia is {{the most}} common cause of {{mortality}} in stroke patients and it has been demonstrated to contribute to mortality and poor functional outcome following stroke in the majority of clinical studies. The risk of infection may be attrib-uted to stroke-induced immunodepression syndrome (SIDS). Cytokine production is increased in SIDS. However, the correla-tion between biomarkers and the risk of post-stroke pneumonia in patients with diabetes mellitus is not clear. The aim of this study was to determine the correlation between pneumonia and the levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) and interleukin- 6 (IL- 6), as well as to identify early predictors of pneumonia in acute ischemic stroke patients with diabetes mellitus. Additionally, we investigated the impact of pneumonia on functional outcome after 1 month. A total of 106 ischemic stroke patients with diabetes mellitus who were admitted after the onset of symp-toms were included in the study. They were divided into two groups, the pneumonia and non-pneumonia groups. CRP, IL- 6, white blood cells (WBCs), <b>mean</b> <b>body</b> <b>temperature</b> and National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score were measured at the time of admission. The modified Rankin Scale score was assessed at 30 days. The levels of IL- 6, CRP and WBCs, as well as <b>mean</b> <b>body</b> <b>temperature</b> were significantly higher in the patients with pneumonia than in the patients without pneumonia. There were also significant differences between the pneumonia and non-pneumonia groups in age, admission NIHSS score, length of hospital stay and dysphagia.

Scientists confirmed these results and proposed that the method of action was inhibition of serotonin uptake since the drug also blocked the serotonin depleting action of extra-neuronal monoamine transporters (EMT). This would lead to increased stimulation of serotonin receptors through a negative feed back mechanism, eventually decreasing serotonin out put. However, the study points out that other studies {{have shown that}} drugs combined with EMT cause a lowering of <b>body</b> <b>temperature</b> that in fact results in a decrease in 5HT turnover. This <b>means</b> that <b>body</b> <b>temperature</b> effects cannot be ruled out.|$|R
