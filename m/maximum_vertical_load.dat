40|$|Lunge is one {{frequently}} executed {{movement in}} badminton and involves a unique sagittal footstrike angle {{of more than}} 40 degrees at initial ground contact compared with other manoeuvres. This study examined if the shoe heel curvature design of a badminton shoe would influence shoe-ground kinematics, ground reaction forces, and knee moments during lunge. Eleven elite and fifteen intermediate players performed five left-forward maximum lunge trials with Rounded Heel Shoe (RHS), Flattened Heel Shoe (FHS), and Standard Heel Shoes (SHS). Shoe-ground kinematics, ground reaction forces, and knee moments were measured by using synchronized force platform and motion analysis system. A 2 (Group) x 3 (Shoe) ANOVA with repeated measures was performed {{to determine the effects}} of different shoes and different playing levels, as well as the interaction of two factors on all variables. Shoe effect indicated that players demonstrated lower <b>maximum</b> <b>vertical</b> <b>loading</b> rate in RHS than the other two shoes (P < 0. 05). Group effect revealed that elite players exhibited larger footstrike angle, faster approaching speed, lower peak horizontal force and horizontal loading rates but higher <b>vertical</b> <b>loading</b> rates and larger peak knee flexion and extension moments (P < 0. 05). Analysis of Interactions of Group x Shoe for <b>maximum</b> and mean <b>vertical</b> <b>loading</b> rates (P < 0. 05) indicated that elite players exhibited lower left <b>maximum</b> and mean <b>vertical</b> <b>loading</b> rates in RHS compared to FHS (P < 0. 01), while the intermediate group did not show any Shoe effect on <b>vertical</b> <b>loading</b> rates.

Other factors in the landing gear problem are ignored except insofar as they affect this one type of loading. As an instrument for study, one model of aircraft was chosen for which extensive flight test and drop test data were available. The main parameters which enter into the spin-up drag load are the landing weight of the aircraft, the rate of descent at contact, the ground speed, the time interval from initial contact to attainment of <b>maximum</b> <b>vertical</b> <b>load,</b> and the coefficient of friction between the tire and the runway surface. Minor parameters which may affect the drag load are the tire pressure, moment of inertia of the rolling stock, oleo pressure, and quantity {{of oil in the}} hydraulic shock absorber. The results {{of this study indicate that}} the maximum gear drag load is primarily a function of the time required to reach <b>maximum</b> <b>vertical</b> <b>load,</b> and that further study of this parameter, using drop test data for several types of aircraft, might well lead to some valuable empirical information essential to landing gear design.

40|$|Introduction: Encountering {{soil from}} the {{viewpoint}} of management and product manufacturing has always been considered important, and an attempt is always made hat the tools and contrasting methods of soil be designed {{in such a way that}} itself prevents, as much as possible, the destructive consequences or energy waste that include economical or environmental limitations. Enhancing the soil encountering methods, quality reformation, and its related equipment, requires performing reliable tests in actual soil conditions. Considering the complexity and variety of variables in soil and machine contrast, this is a hard task. Hence, the numeral simulations are the key of all optimizations that illustrate efficient models by removing the costly farm tests and reducing research time. Tire is one of the main factors engaged with soil, and it is one of those tools that are discussable in both farms, and software environments. Despite the complexities in soil behavior, and tire geometry, modeling, tire movement on the soil has been the researchers’ objective from the past. Materials and methods: A non-linear finite element (FE) model of the interaction of a non-driving tire with soil surface was developed to investigate the influence of the forward speed, tire inflation pressure and <b>vertical</b> <b>load</b> on rolling resistance using ABAQUS/Explicit code. In this research numerical and experimental tests were done under different conditions in order to estimate tire rolling resistance. In numerical tests, the soil part was simulated as a one-layer viscous-elastic material with a Drucker-Prager model by considering realistic soil properties. These properties included elastic and plastic properties which were obtained in the soil laboratory using relevant tests. The soil samples were prepared from the soil which was inside the soil bin. The same soil was utilized in experimental tests. Finite strain hyper elasticity model is developed to model nearly incompressible rubber materials for the tire. Tire model consisted of three components: tread, rubber and ring. Using a soil bin and one wheel tester with their related equipment, experimental tests were carried out in the workstation of mechanics of bio system engineering department of the Urmia University. This system includes various sections such as soil storage in dimensions of 22 × 2 × 1 meter, tools carrier or tracker, soil processing equipment, dynamic system, evaluation tools and controlling systems. In order to launch the collection and supply required power for wheel carrier, an industrial three phase electromotor with 22 kW (30 hp) was used. Both numerical and experimental tests were done at three levels of wheel dynamic load (1, 2, 3, 4 and 5) kN, tire inflation pressure (100, 200 and 300) kPa and four levels of speed (0. 25, 0. 45, 0. 65, 0. 9 and 1. 15) m s- 1 to obtain the rolling resistance of the tire. Results and discussion: In order to evaluate the performance of final non driving tire-soil model to estimate the rolling resistance, numerical results were compared with preliminary experimental data obtained from the soil-bin tests. The comparison showed reasonably good agreement between the computed and measured general pattern of the rolling resistance at the tire-soil interface under different speeds, <b>vertical</b> <b>loads</b> and inflation pressures. In both tests, a specified relation was not seen between tire velocity and its rolling resistance, as it was not seen in empirical models such as Wismar and Luce. Correlation coefficient between experimental and numerical data, in the minimum and maximum value of tire inflation pressure was computed to be 0. 06 and 0. 016 percent, respectively. The amount of tire rolling resistance significantly increased with increase of tire <b>vertical</b> <b>load.</b> Correlation coefficient between experimental and numerical data, in the minimum and <b>maximum</b> <b>vertical</b> <b>loads</b> was computed to be 80 and 87 percent, respectively. Gent and Walter obtained the same results. The tire inflation pressure and rolling resistance variables had inverse relation to each other in both numerical and experimental tests. Correlation coefficient between experimental and numerical data was computed to be 97 and 73 percent in the minimum and maximum tire inflation pressure, respectively. The gradient of changes in tire inflation pressure - rolling resistance diagram was less in numerical tests. This was because of differences between real properties and the properties entered into the software. Conclusions: To conclude, in this investigation a new 3 D tire-soil model was simulated which has specific features. The experimental results showed that the numerical data of estimation of non-driven tire rolling resistance were reliable. In both tests, the effect of changes in tire forward speed on rolling resistance was not significant. The amount of the tire rolling resistance significantly increased with increasing tire <b>vertical</b> <b>load.</b> Changes in tire inflation pressure and rolling resistance had an inverse relation with each other in both numerical and experimental tests. The slope of rolling resistance - inflation pressure diagram in numerical tests was less than the same diagram in the experimental tests...|$|R
40|$|The {{main purpose}} of the Load Alleviation system on which this paper is focused is a drop in {{structural}} wing loads for improved performances, fatigue life, Operative Empty Weight reduction. The driving idea is to perform the alleviation during a quasi-steady symmetric maneuver {{by means of a}} symmetric actuation of dedicated control surfaces. The control effectiveness of the load alleviator is evaluated, in terms of required deflection for a desired bending moment reduction in the wing, but keeping the same <b>maximum</b> <b>vertical</b> <b>load</b> factor attained during the unalleviated maneuver. When high performance is important, internal structural loads (maneuver loads) reduction becomes significant, if the alleviated maneuver can be performed with the vertical load factor kept unvarying. Consequently evaluations on the load alleviator effectiveness in the early design process are appropriate to find the best set of controls. The load alleviator deflection time history is evaluated a priori, without feed-back calculations, simply depending upon elevators time history, system characteristics and flight condition. An application on a business aircraft has been performed (not neglecting structural flexibility) for two kinds of symmetric maneuvers. By adopting the ailerons as load alleviators, the maximum bending reduction at the wing root is about 37 percent, with a maximum aileron deflection less than 12 deg...|$|E
40|$|A {{conceptual}} {{mechanism of}} rockfill deformation was postulated by Oldecop & Alonso (2001) {{on the basis}} of the observed rockfill behaviour in suction-controlled oedometer tests. Rockfill mechanical behaviour was linked to water action by means of some crack propagation phenomena, usually known as subcritical crack growth (Atkinson, 1984). For most rocks, the propagation velocity of cracks depends on the applied loads and the chemical action of water contained within the rock particles. Water action is conveniently measured by the relative humidity or by the total suction. It is believed that such phenomena are involved in rockfill particle breakage, an experimental fact that is well recognised as being part of rockfill volumetric deformation under a wide range of stress states (Kjaernsli & Sande, 1963; Sowers et al., 1965; Fumagalli, 1969; Marsal, 1973). A phenomenological constitutive model was proposed (Oldecop & Alonso, 2001) for one-dimensional compression, in which total suction and total stress are the relevant variables. This initial approach was based on a reduced number of laboratory tests, in which the vertical stress was limited to a maximum of 1 MPa. A new experimental programme was performed on the same material, using a newly developed testing device. A large-diameter (300 mm) oedometer, specially designed for the control of relative humidity by means of an air-flow circulation through the specimen, was built. The <b>maximum</b> <b>vertical</b> <b>load</b> was extended to 2 · 8 MPa in order to investigate the material behaviour in a load range common to rockfill dam structures. New features of rockfill behaviour were observed during this experimental programme. These are described in the paper. Moreover, the previously proposed constitutive model has been reformulated in order to extend its capabilities to cover these new features. Peer Reviewe...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThis paper {{presents}} the methodology {{to perform a}} conceptual structural design of the landing gears and the dynamic landing loads for the Unmanned Space re-entry Vehicle USV 3, currently under development at CIRA. The landing gear preliminary design is usually carried-out by responding to requirements of maximum overall dimensions, maximum weight and maximum attainable load factor. The oleo-pneumatic mechanism is conceived {{with the aim of}} maximizing the oleo-pneumatic efficiency, since it is critically depending on the <b>maximum</b> <b>vertical</b> <b>load</b> factor and on the strut length, whereas the structure is generally sized by combining the design vertical loads with the maximum expected horizontal loads. The horizontal drag component simulating the force required to accelerate the tires and wheels up to the landing speed (spin-up) and the forward acting horizontal load resulting from rapid reduction of the spin-up drag loads (spring-back) must be evaluated. The dynamic model of the landing gear system, fully nonlinear and taking into account the structural flexibility has been conceived. In particular, the dynamic model is made of subsystems based on statistical evaluations and/or semi-empirical equations; these subsystems should be easy manageable, making the whole system simple to analyze for different values of the project parameters. The model is used for material selection and preliminary sizing of components through dynamic analyses. At the same time, maximum expected horizontal loads are evaluated in an iterative manner, the entire process leads to the conceptual design of the landing gear. A method to carry-out the dynamic landing simulations by integration of the vehicle equations with those of each undercarriage (pseudo-elastic, fully nonlinear dynamic equations) has been defined and applied to the USV 3 vehicle. The coupling between the vehicle and the landing gears has been performed by using a kinematic approach, i. e. the aircraft is considered rigid. The developed methodology is entirely encoded in the MATLAB/Simulink environment, and linked to excel sheets for the input and output data management. Dynamic landing simulations on two and three points have been performed for evaluating the maximum responses of spin-up and spring back loads in a rational manner. A sensitivity analysis involving landing horizontal and vertical speed, and tire inflation pressure completes the whole work. A comparison of resulting horizontal loads with those obtained by using the Appendix C and D of STANAG 4671 (USAR) shows the convenience to use the rational approach presented herein. In fact the attained lower structural loads may lead to potential weight and cost reduction from the earliest phases of design...|$|E

Based on these tests, the effects of <b>vertical</b> dead <b>load</b> on the lateral resistance of the battered pile groups are found to depend on pile arrangement, pile inclination, and soil density. The lateral resistances of the 3 x 3 pile groups do not appear to vary considerably with the <b>vertical</b> dead <b>loads</b> in the range of the <b>vertical</b> <b>loads</b> studied.

40|$|AbstractIn this paper, {{hydrodynamic}} wave loads on {{an offshore}} stationary–floating {{oscillating water column}} (OWC) are investigated via a 2 D and 3 D computational fluid dynamics (CFD) modeling based on the RANS equations and the VOF surface capturing scheme. The CFD model is validated against previous experiments for nonlinear regular wave interactions with a surface-piercing stationary barge. Following the validation stage, the numerical model is modified to consider the pneumatic damping effect, and an extensive campaign of numerical tests is carried out to study the wave–OWC interactions for different wave periods, wave heights and pneumatic damping factors. It is found that the horizontal wave force is usually larger than the vertical one. Also, there a direct relationship between the pneumatic and hydrodynamic vertical forces with a <b>maximum</b> <b>vertical</b> force almost at the device natural frequency, whereas the pneumatic damping has a {{little effect on the}} horizontal force. Additionally, simulating the turbine damping with an orifice plate induces higher <b>vertical</b> <b>loads</b> than utilizing a slot opening. Furthermore, 3 D modeling significantly escalates and declines the predicted hydrodynamic vertical and horizontal wave loads, respectively...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. [Purpose] The {{present study}} {{examined}} the activity and the gait characteristics of the gluteus medius and the trunk stability muscles during the stance phase of gait on level ground when a <b>vertical</b> <b>load</b> corresponding to 0 %, 1 %, or 2 % of body weight {{was placed on the}} lower extremities during the swing phase of the gait. [Methods] The subjects were 40 young males aged between 21 and 30 years. The <b>vertical</b> <b>load,</b> corresponding to 0 %, 1 %, 2 % of weight, which was measured with an electronic scale, was placed bilaterally 3 cm above from {{the upper part of the}} lateral malleous. Electrodes were symmetrically attached to the gluteus medius, erector spinae, external oblique, and internal oblique muscles. [Results] There were significant differences in the activities of the left gluteus medius, bilateral external oblique, and right internal oblique muscles among the <b>vertical</b> <b>loads</b> of 0 %, 1 %, and 2 % during gait. [Conclusion] Increases in <b>vertical</b> <b>load</b> were accompanied by changes in the activities of the internal and exter-nal oblique abdominal muscles to ensure the stability of the trunk under the different loads. Gait was only possible with the activity of the gluteus medius muscle and the trunk muscles resisting the different <b>vertical</b> <b>loads</b> rather than activating other muscles of the lower extremities in terms of energy efficiency...|$|R
