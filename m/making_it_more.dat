5|$|The same {{applies to}} herbivores, animals that eat plants, {{and the plants}} that they eat. In the Rocky Mountains, red {{squirrels}} and crossbills (seed-eating birds) compete for seeds of the lodgepole pine. The squirrels get at pine seeds by gnawing through the cone scales, whereas the crossbills get at the seeds by extracting them with their unusual crossed mandibles. In areas where there are squirrels, the lodgepole's cones are heavier, and have fewer seeds and thinner scales, <b>making</b> <b>it</b> <b>more</b> difficult for squirrels {{to get at the}} seeds. Conversely, where there are crossbills but no squirrels, the cones are lighter in construction, but have thicker scales, <b>making</b> <b>it</b> <b>more</b> difficult for crossbills to get at the seeds. The lodgepole's cones are in an evolutionary arms race with the two kinds of herbivore.|$|E

5|$|Adidas Terrestra Silverstream was the {{official}} match ball {{used in the}} final. It was assembled and marketed by German sport firm Adidas, and was the ninth ball in the European Championship series, as well {{as part of the}} Adidas Finale. The ball's design was created by British independent brand specialist company Design Bridge, and influenced by the waters, in the Netherlands and Belgium. The ball contains synthetic foam layers, <b>making</b> <b>it</b> <b>more</b> comfortable to grip and smoother to control. The Terrestra Silverstream was later unveiled as {{the official}} match ball of the UEFA Euro 2000.|$|E
5|$|Association football, {{the modern}} game, also has {{documented}} early involvement of women. An annual competition in Mid-Lothian, Scotland during the 1790s is reported, too. In 1863, football governing bodies introduced standardised rules to prohibit {{violence on the}} pitch, <b>making</b> <b>it</b> <b>more</b> socially acceptable for women to play. The first match recorded by the Scottish Football Association took place in 1892 in Glasgow. In England, the first recorded game of football between women took place in 1895.|$|E
5|$|At least 32 {{metastable}} isomers {{have been}} characterized, ranging in mass number from 164 to 197. The most stable {{of these is}} 192m2Ir, which decays by isomeric transition with a half-life of 241years, <b>making</b> <b>it</b> <b>more</b> stable than any of iridium's synthetic isotopes in their ground states. The least stable isomer is 190m3Ir with a half-life of only 2µs. The isotope 191Ir {{was the first one}} of any element to be shown to present a Mössbauer effect. This renders it useful for Mössbauer spectroscopy for research in physics, chemistry, biochemistry, metallurgy, and mineralogy.|$|E

5|$|Between {{these two}} seasons, Bradman seriously {{contemplated}} playing professional cricket in England with the Lancashire League club Accrington, a move that, {{according to the}} rules of the day, would have ended his Test career. A consortium of three Sydney businesses offered an alternative. They devised a two-year contract whereby Bradman wrote for Associated Newspapers, broadcast on Radio 2UE and promoted the menswear retailing chain FJ Palmer and Son. However, the contract increased Bradman's dependence on his public profile, <b>making</b> <b>it</b> <b>more</b> difficult to maintain the privacy that he ardently desired.|$|E
5|$|During {{the first}} few months, the wing was not {{assigned}} any aircraft, and thus worked with other units who were in possession of the B-36 Peacemaker. In March and April, the base began preparing for operations of the B-36, which arrived later in April. This gave the newly activated 69th Bombardment Squadron {{a full complement of}} aircraft. By the end of August, the number had increased to 27 bombers, 322 officers, 313 airmen, and 350 civilians. Additionally, more buildings were constructed on base, <b>making</b> <b>it</b> <b>more</b> of a home for airmen and their families.|$|E
5|$|Flight Unlimited was {{the first}} self-published game {{released}} by Looking Glass Technologies. It was intended to establish the company as a video game publisher and to compete with flight simulator franchises such as Microsoft Flight Simulator. Project leader Seamus Blackley, a particle physicist and amateur pilot, conceived the game in 1992. He felt that other flight simulators failed to convey the experience of real flight, and he reacted by coding a simulated atmosphere for Flight Unlimited based on real-time computational fluid dynamics. Aerobatic pilot Michael Goulian endorsed the game and assisted the team in <b>making</b> <b>it</b> <b>more</b> true to life.|$|E

5|$|In {{some areas}} of the world, {{including}} Berlin, Germany, dropping salt is prohibited altogether except on the highest-risk roads; plain sand without any melting agents is spread instead. While this may protect the environment, it is more labour-intensive, as more gritting runs are needed; because the sand is insoluble, it tends to accumulate at the sides of the road, <b>making</b> <b>it</b> <b>more</b> difficult for buses to pull in at bus stops.|$|E
5|$|Other basic {{defensive}} measures {{included the}} removal of signposts, milestones (some had the carved details obscured with cement) and railway station signs <b>making</b> <b>it</b> <b>more</b> likely that an enemy would become confused. Petrol pumps were removed from service stations near the coast and there were careful preparations {{for the destruction of}} those that were left. Detailed plans were made for destroying anything that might prove useful to the invader such as port facilities, key roads and rolling stock. In certain areas non-essential citizens were evacuated. In the county of Kent, 40% of the population was relocated; in East Anglia, the figure was 50%.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the 1940s, {{wildfires}} {{burned through}} the Little Applegate River watershed frequently. The United States Forest Service began fire suppression {{efforts in the}} 1920s, and a smokejumper station was built about 20 years later. Species that depend on fire to reproduce—such as ponderosa pine—declined in population, while Douglas-fir and white fir spread. Buckbrush and manzanita, normally chaparral plants, encroached on the oak savanna regions. The vegetation in the watershed continues to grow denser, <b>making</b> <b>it</b> <b>more</b> susceptible to insect infestations and disease.|$|E

5|$|Smartsheet {{was first}} {{introduced}} in 2006. According to the company's co-founder, Brent Frei, initial adoption was slow because the software was too difficult to use.

The company began making changes to the software in 2008, eventually cutting 60 percent of its features for the purpose of <b>making</b> <b>it</b> <b>more</b> user-friendly. Following the 2010 launch of the redesign, adoption grew to 1 million users at 20,000 organizations by 2012.|$|E
5|$|The main {{entrance}} to the castle would have involved crossing a stone bridge between the two easterly ditch bridge towers and the main gatehouse; little remains of the bridge towers today and a timber entrance way to the gatehouse replaces the bridge. A water gate overlooks a protected stairway of 127 steps that runs down {{to the foot of}} the cliffs. In the 13th century, the sea came up close to the stairway, allowing resupply by sea, but today the sea has retreated significantly, <b>making</b> <b>it</b> <b>more</b> difficult to envisage the concept in its original setting.|$|E
5|$|About half {{of those}} {{who lost their lives}} on the Wall were killed in the first five years after it was {{originally}} installed. Death rates fell from then on, and took a particularly dramatic downturn after 1976. Nearly 86% of the Wall's victims, 120 people, died between 1961 and 1975; between 1976 and 1989 only 19 died. Several factors account for this reduction. The Wall became even more impregnable owing to technical improvements carried out in the mid-1970s and more restrictions were put on the area adjoining the Wall, <b>making</b> <b>it</b> <b>more</b> difficult to reach in the first place. The signing of the Helsinki Accords in 1975 led to new opportunities to cross the border legally, resulting in a rise in emigration applications and a corresponding fall in escape attempts.|$|E
