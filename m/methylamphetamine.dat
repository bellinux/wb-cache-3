In November 2010, Nutt {{published a}}nother study in The Lancet, co-authored with Les King and Lawrence Phillips on behalf of this independent Committee. This ranked the harm done to user and society by a range of drugs. Owing in part to criticism over the arbitrary weighting of the factors in the 2007 study, the new study employed a multi-criteria decision analysis procedure and found that alcohol is more harmful to society than both heroin and crack, while heroin, crack and <b>methylamphetamine</b> (crystal meth) were the most harmful drugs to individuals.

5000|$|Black market ecstasy pills are {{frequently}} found to contain other drugs {{in place of}} or in addition to methylenedioxymethylamphetamine (MDMA). Since the slang term [...] "ecstasy" [...] usually refers only to MDMA, any pill which contains other compounds may be considered adulterated. 3,4-Methylenedioxyamphetamine (MDA), methylenedioxyethylamphetamine (MDEA), amphetamine, <b>methylamphetamine,</b> benzylpiperazine (BZP), trifluoromethylphenylpiperazine (TFMPP), caffeine, ephedrine, pseudoephedrine, and dextromethorphan (DXM) are all commonly found in pills being sold as ecstasy. Less common drugs in ecstasy include diphenhydramine, acetaminophen, 5-MeO-DiPT, 2C-B, procaine, and phencyclidine (PCP). Ecstasy pills sometimes contain dimethylamylamine to increase its stimulant effects. Ecstasy pills might also contain a low dose of 2C-I to potentiate its euphoric effects. Pharmaceutical pills are sometimes sold as ecstasy, as well as pills that contain no psychoactive chemicals at all. Ecstasy sometimes contains 10 mg to 20 mg of baclofen to reduce overheating caused by ecstasy. para-Methoxyamphetamine (PMA or [...] "Dr. Death", a drug that causes so much overheating that it can kill within 40 minutes) is sometimes sold as ecstasy. There is one published case of an ecstasy tablet being adulterated with 8 mg of strychnine, a toxic alkaloid which was used in very low doses (less than 1 mg) as a stimulant and performance-enhancing drug in the past. Recently, several groups advocating for drug safety through education have made reagent testing products available to confirm what substances there are.|$|E
5000|$|Criminal organisations may {{generate}} significant income {{through the}} manufacture and trafficking of illicit drugs and their precursor chemicals. Increased involvement {{has resulted in}} larger and more sophisticated clandestine laboratories being detected in Australia. In 2008-09, a record 449 clandestine laboratories were detected in Australia (a 26 per cent increase from 2007-08). 67.7 per cent of clandestine laboratories continue to be detected in residential locations. Over two tonnes of precursor chemicals {{for the production of}} meth/amphetamines were detected at the Australian border in 2008-09, nearly double the weight detected in 2007-08. In 2008-09, clandestine laboratory detections increased across most jurisdictions, the largest occurring in Western Australia, which increased from 30 laboratories in 2007-08 to 78 in 2008-09, an increase of 160 per cent. In the context of the Australian Illicit Drug Report, a clandestine laboratory is any concealed place where chemicals are used to produce illicit drugs. [...] Such laboratories range from crude, makeshift operations using simple processes to highly sophisticated operations using technically advanced facilities. They can be located virtually anywhere—in private residences, motel and hotel rooms, apartments, horse trailers, houseboats, boats, vehicles, buses, trucks, campgrounds and commercial establishments—and are usually very portable. Some clandestine laboratories use very simple processes such as extracting cannabis oil from plants using solvents; others use complex processes involving a number of chemicals and a range of equipment to manufacture drugs such as <b>methylamphetamine</b> and ecstasy. Clan labs are usually discovered after they have exploded.|$|E

Manning, broke the news that drugs were involved in Simpson's death, 31 July 1967. On the next racing day, the other riders were reluctant to continue racing and asked the organisers for a postponement. France's Stablinski suggested that the race continue, with a British rider, whose team would wear black armbands, allowed to win the stage. Hoban won the stage, although many thought the stage winner should have been Denson, Simpson's close friend. Media reports suggested that his death was caused by heat exhaustion, until, on 31 July 1967 British journalist J. L. Manning of the Daily Mail broke the news about a formal connection between drugs and Simpson's death. French authorities confirmed that Simpson had traces of amphetamine in his body, impairing his judgement and allowing him to push himself beyond his limits. His death contributed to the introduction of mandatory testing for performance-enhancing drugs in cycling, leading to tests in 1968 at the Giro d'Italia, Tour de France and Summer Olympics. Simpson was buried in Harworth Cemetery, after a service at the 12th-century village church attended by an estimated 5,000 mourners, including Peugeot teammate Eddy Merckx, the only continental rider in attendance. The epitaph on Simpson's gravestone in Harworth cemetery reads, [...] "His body ached, his legs grew tired, but still he would not give in", taken from a card left by his brother, Harry, following his death.|$|E

40|$|The clandestine {{manufacture}} of <b>methylamphetamine</b> has been detected in over 60 countries worldwide. <b>Methylamphetamine</b> can be manufactured easily {{using a variety}} of common household chemicals and several different methods, or routes. Information on how to synthesise <b>methylamphetamine</b> is readily available on the Internet, publically accessible scientific journals, chemical patents and published books. The illicit {{manufacture of}} <b>methylamphetamine</b> produces a substantial amount of toxic waste. This waste is often dumped illegally, creating a source of environmental pollution. Environmental crime is perceived by criminals as low risk, high profit crime due to low detection and prosecution rates. In 2004, the European Commission put into place a directive (2004 / 35 /CE) aimed at punishing polluters financially. This directive came into force by member states in 2007 and promotes the “polluters pay” principle. By determining the fate of <b>methylamphetamine</b> waste products, detection of pollution will be feasible. It is important to understand the partitioning behaviour of the waste in order to ensure samples are collected from the appropriate environmental compartment (air, water, soil and sediment). Additionally, knowledge of how long the waste will persist in the environment will give information as to the age of a dumpsite, and whether or not waste can be detected. Using the principles of environmental science and justice, clandestine chemists can be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law. While much work has been completed investigating the reaction impurities of clandestine <b>methylamphetamine</b> manufacture, little research has been conducted into profiling the waste. In this work, we present data on the environmental fate and distribution of <b>methylamphetamine</b> waste. Components of the waste were identified using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and subsequently input to a computer modelling programme. A fugacity model was produced using the United States Environmental Protection Agency’s computer modelling programme, EPISuite. A fugacity model calculates the tendency of a compound to partition into each environmental compartment at equilibrium. In order to improve on the default model, which uses inherent chemical and physical properties, a more accurate model can be obtained by measuring experimentally the partition coefficients Kd, Koc and Kow. This allows a site-specific model to be developed using the sediment-water partition coefficient and the octanol-water partition coefficient and other parameters that affect those values. This will aid in the understanding of the behaviour of <b>methylamphetamine</b> waste in the environment and will provide information for the investigation of a suspected dumpsite...|$|E
40|$|<b>Methylamphetamine,</b> ephedrine, and {{pseudoephedrine}} were derivatized using trifluoroacetic anhydride and enantiomers of each {{were analyzed}} using gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (GC/MS) fitted with a γ-cyclodextrin (Chiraldex™ G-PN) chiral column. A temperature-programmed method was developed and optimized and the results compared with those obtained using a previously published isothermal GC method applied to GC/MS analysis. Trifluoroacetylated 3 -(trifluoromethyl) phenethylamine hydrochloride {{was used as an}} internal standard, and mass fragmentation patterns are proposed for all derivatives analyzed. Qualitative validation of the optimized chromatographic conditions was completed in accordance with the guidelines published by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC). Under conditions of repeatability and reproducibility, the method gave relative retention times with a relative standard deviation of less than 0. 02 % for all six analytes of interest. This surpasses the UNODC's acceptance criteria of 2 % for validation of qualitative precision. Ephedrine and pseudoephedrine are common precursors in the clandestine manufacture of <b>methylamphetamine.</b> Seizures of illicit <b>methylamphetamine</b> therefore often contain mixtures of these optically active compounds.

The instruments contained different generations of gas chromatograph and mass selective detector components and revealed significantly different results when presented with the same samples. The extraction methodology also compared two SPE systems. The extraction efficiency of commercially available molecular imprinted polymers as a sorbent in SPE was compared with commonly used hydrophilic balance sorbent. Molecular imprinted polymers provided excellent recoveries (81 +/- 2 % and 108 +/- 3 % at 30 mu g L- 1, and 94 +/- 2 % and 94 +/- 2 % at 200 mu g L- 1 for amphetamine and <b>methylamphetamine,</b> respectively).

40|$|Impurity {{profiling}} and {{classification of}} abused drugs using chiral analytical techniques {{is of particular}} interest and importance because of the additional information obtained from this approach. When these methods are applied to the synthesis of illicitly used substances, they can supply valuable information about the conditions/chemicals used in the synthesis. We have applied GC and NMR methods to the study of intermediates found in <b>methylamphetamine</b> manufacture with the aim of linking the intermediates to the ephedrine/pseudoephedrine starting materials. Therefore, determination of the stereochemical makeup within samples of forensic interest is important giving further specific information to the analyst. This study investigates the stereochemical course of the Emde synthesis of <b>methylamphetamine</b> with particular focus on intermediate formation via the chlorination of ephedrine and pseudoephedrine enantiomers. The configurations of these chloro-phenethylamines were determined by 1 D and 2 D NMR analysis, and thereafter, the GC/MS analysis was carried out. We have shown here that chlorination of the ephedrine/pseudoephedrine compounds occurs via inversion (SN 2) and retention (SNi) of configuration around the α carbon and mixture of diastereoisomers (chloroephedrine and chloropseudoephedrine) were formed, with the ratio of the resulting compounds dependent on the precursors used.
