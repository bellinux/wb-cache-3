For {{the first time we}} perform a statistical meta-analyses of over 1000 observations on maize gene flow in Europe. Taking into account the results obtained by several statistical approaches, we conclude that separation distances of 20 - 30 m are enough to keep out-crossing below legal thresholds (0. 9 % in the EU). We conclude that <b>mandatory</b> <b>distances</b> established by some European countries (up to 800 m) may be disproportionate to the desired policy objective. JRC.

40|$|One {{key element}} for future Air Traffic Management (ATM) is Trajectory-Based Operations (TBO). However, {{there is a}} big gap between today’s {{adaptive}} operations and future’s required capability to follow 4 D trajectories with low deviations, only. In theory, the highest efficiency in airspace can be reached with very closely spaced trajectories, allowing flights to be separated by minimum allowed safety distance. In practice, execution of such a tight plan typically results in a large amount of rescheduling, because reality imposes deviations due to uncertainties not included in the initial perfect plan. This paper discusses the trade-off between built-in robustness in the initial planning stage and the obtainable efficiency. Resilience is added by increasing the separation between trajectories. Assuming that the <b>mandatory</b> <b>distance</b> for guaranteeing safe flights remains constant, the additional separation provides freedom for aircraft following their trajectories...|$|R

40|$|Modern Flight Management Systems (FMS) {{are able}} to predict highly precise 4 D trajectories for {{complete}} flights from take-off to touchdown. The generated trajectories take into account aircraft’s performance parameters, altitude-, speed- and time constraints, given procedures, and the expected weather conditions, as forecasted. Based on these trajectories, a traffic scheduler can generate and guarantee conflict-free traffic – as long as every aircraft sticks to the plan. However, even the most accurate trajectory becomes unrealizable when significant disturbances arise that were not foreseeable at prediction time. Uncertainties like imprecise weather forecasts, inaccurate departure times, and issues with delayed passengers influence a direct implementation of pre-planned 4 D schedules in practice. If such disturbing events are rare, the overall plan may be adapted. Too many disturbances might ruin the whole schedule though.

50|$|Naturally, the tooth-to-restoration margin is an {{unsightly}} {{thing to}} have exposed {{on the surface of}} a tooth visible in a smile. In such a circumstance, the dentist would like to place the margin as far apical (towards the root tip of the tooth) as possible, even below the gum line. While there is no issue, per se, with placing the margin at the gumline, problems may arise when placing the margin too subgingivally (below the gumline). First, there might be issues in terms of capturing the margin in an impression to make the stone model of the prepared tooth (see stone model replication of tooth in photographs, above). Secondly, there is the seriously important issue of biologic width. Biologic width is the <b>mandatory</b> <b>distance</b> to be left between the height of the alveolar bone and the margin of the restoration, and if this distance is violated because the margin is placed too subgingivally, serious repercussions may follow. In situations where the margin cannot be placed apically enough to provide for proper retention of the prosthetic crown on the prepared tooth structure, the tooth or teeth involved should undergo a crown lengthening procedure.|$|R

50|$|The outfield wall or outfield {{fence is}} the wall or fence {{that marks the}} outer {{boundary}} of the outfield. A ball passing over the wall is dead; if it passes over the wall in fair territory while in flight, it is a home run. The official rules do not specify the shape, height, or composition of the wall, or a specific <b>mandatory</b> <b>distance</b> from home plate (though Major League Baseball mandates a minimum distance of 250 ft and recommends a minimum distance of 320 ft at the foul poles and 400 ft at center field). As a result, baseball fields can vary greatly along those lines. The wall has numbers affixed or painted on it that denote the distance in feet {{from that point on}} the wall to home plate. In most modern major league ballparks, the wall is made of some hard material (e.g., concrete) with padding on the field side to protect players who may collide with the wall at high speed while trying to make a play. Chain link fencing may also be incorporated into the wall in areas where the wall needs to be transparent, e.g., an outfield bullpen, a spectator area behind the wall, or to protect a scoreboard incorporated into the wall. Many ballparks feature a yellow line denoting the top of the wall to aid umpires in judging whether the ball passed over the wall or if the ball is fair or foul.|$|R

25|$|On April 8, 1933, Arlosoroff {{organized}} a historic {{event at the}} King David Hotel in Jerusalem on the Jewish Agency's behalf. The luncheon, attended by Weizmann and prominent Arab leaders of Transjordan, {{would be the first}} time Jewish Zionists and key Arabs gathered together to help promote cooperative efforts between the two groups. Arlosoroff hoped that by building an accord with the Arab sheiks of Transjordan, political relations with Arab leaders of Mandatory Palestine might be enhanced. However, not everyone was pleased with Arlosoroff's vision for Jewish/Arab collaboration, nor the possibility of a bi-nationalistic future in Eretz Israel. After the luncheon, Arab radicals openly chastised the moderate Arabs who had attended the meeting. Certain Arab leaders in <b>Mandatory</b> Palestine <b>distanced</b> themselves completely from the Transjordanian Arab delegation. Particular anger was directed at Transjordan's Emir Abdullah, the ruler over large territories in Transjordan, who had taken {{a leading role in the}} conciliation efforts. Jewish opposition to the King David Hotel meeting also became apparent as the major party of religious Zionism, Mizrachi, demanded that Arlosoroff should resign from his position at the Jewish Agency. Some radicals in the Revisionist movement went even further and questioned Arlosoroff's right to be alive.|$|R

2500|$|Stop sign {{placement}} {{can pose}} an additional challenge to users. There is a trade-off between the salient visual cues provided by increased limit line set-back, and the crucial {{time that is}} lost in approaching the intersection from behind that line; being closer can provide a few additional seconds requisite for safe transit. However, common creeping into the intersection past the limit line causes drivers to lose the invaluable perspective of the visual acuity of lateral motion, crippling them to the more dangerous SAVT. This makes {{it very difficult to}} estimate the movement of oncoming traffic. As intersections are not engineered to be used this way, the traffic flow ideals have broken down when drivers consistently choose this method as the safer alternative. Stop signs are accompanied with a limit line, which has a <b>mandatory</b> set-back <b>distance</b> which is often not less than 15 feet. While it may be negligence per se to prematurely pass the stop limit line, drivers may be unfairly denied sufficient time gap or opportunity to enter otherwise because of the through-traffic flow and speed; the inherent problem with this traffic control device. While stop signs are a relatively inexpensive method of traffic management, they can be expensive from perspective of the damage they cause users. Pricey but safer traffic signals, roundabouts, and traffic circles are alternatively used where traffic flow dictates it is inappropriate to use a stop sign. It is just as crucial for law enforcement to regulate traffic through-speed that is above the [...] assured clear distance ahead ahead as it is to cite stop sign runners for this device to be a viable option.|$|R
40|$|A {{wireless}} {{sensor network}} is {{the combination of a}} large number of deployed sensors over a terrain. Communication between the sensors is the most important issue for a successful network. It is <b>mandatory</b> that long <b>distance</b> and multi-hop communication will occur between sensors. Sensors relay the sensed data of a particular territory to the command center via a base station. An out of communication range problem may arise for the base station to the sensor due to non uniformed deployment of sensors in hostile areas. To solve this problem a solution of agent sensor based group management technique was proposed earlier. But in that solution the proposed load balancing technique seems to create bottleneck particularly in the agent sensors. This paper proposes a revised sensor communication management scheme using a dynamic load balancing approach based on residual energy of each agent sensors. Moreover the proposal considers that each group will contain a maximum number of member nodes. Performance of the proposed scheme is evaluated by some experimental results. 1...|$|R
50|$|This is in turn used {{to define}} most {{broadcast}} classes for FM stations in North America. Each class (except D) is defined as having a maximum ERP and HAAT. If the HAAT of a station's radio antenna exceeds that specified for the class, it must reduce ERP so that its signal does not exceed the reference distance. The signal strength used differs by class, but generally the value is 1.0mV/m (millivolt per meter) or 60dBu (decibels over one microvolt per meter) {{for most of the}} United States, and 0.5mV/m or 54dBu in Canada, and for some U.S. stations in parts of certain areas including California, the Great Lakes region, and the Northeast. This is considered the service contour of a station by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC), and by COFETEL in Mexico, according to NARBA and other international agreements among the three.

40|$|The Anglo American open-cut {{coal mines}} in Australia {{routinely}} obtain structural data from exposed highwalls {{to determine the}} potential for instability caused by joint orientation, joint dip, and joint persistence. Three methods are currently available to obtain this data: direct in-pit measurements with a geological compass, photogrammetry, and laser scanning. Direct measurements are often very time-consuming and can lack the precision of other methods due to the inability to perform proper line surveys where <b>mandatory</b> safety stand-off <b>distances</b> are enforced at the toe of each highwall. For this reason, photogrammetry has been the method of choice for many years, where stereo pairs are {{used to create a}} 3 D image of the highwall. In recent years however, laser scanners now appear to be the preferred method of data acquisition due to their faster capturing and processing time, as well as their user-friendly CAD processing functionality. Concerns however have been raised over the accuracy of laser scanner data as examples to date have lacked the point cloud density necessary for picking representative joint planes. To resolve this issue, both methods were applied on the same highwall and the outputs compared. From this comparison, it was concluded that accuracy is not compromised with laser scanner acquisition methods as long as the correct intensity is selected prior to capturing the scan. Discrepancies were however identified between the joint orientation outputs of Sirovision and I-site mapping technologies. These discrepancies are attributed to the different algorithms each program uses, as well as the survey control and density of data points produced and required by each method...|$|R

The sample size was 247 farmers in 12 catchments (approximately 4 - 12 km 2) in the Republic of Ireland. The survey was based on a proposal to install a 10 metre deep riparian buffer zone on a five year scheme and the analysis was based on principal components analysis, contingent valuation methodology and a Generalized Tobit Interval model. Results from this analysis indicated that famers’ willingness to supply a riparian buffer zone depended on a mix of economic, attitudinal and farm structural factors.
