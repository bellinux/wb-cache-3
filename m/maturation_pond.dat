Determinations of Biochemical and Chemical Oxygen Demand and Total Suspended Solids (BOD 5, COD and TSS mg/L), Recovered Heterotrophics and Total and Fecal Coliforms (RH, TC and FC, CFU ml/L) were performed at UM-Biology Lab. The removal efficiencies were 10 % higher at CAB for BOD 5 and COD and 10 % higher at TEB for TSS. RH removal was mostly higher than 95 %, but on CAB 6 and 9 samples, was respectively null and weak.

40|$|During 1982 benthic and {{floating}} filamentous algal mats {{appeared in the}} maturation ponds of the Grahamstown Sewage Disposal Works. These mats clogged the ponds and reduced the efficiency by which the effluent was purified. As they {{continued to be a}} problem despite numerous efforts to remove them, this study was initiated to investigate the alga, establish why it was successful in the pond environment, and how its growth could be controlled. The physico-chemical environment of a representative <b>maturation</b> <b>pond</b> was characterised while laboratory studies were conducted to investigate the growth, photosynthetic and respiratory characteristics in the alga. The alga was identified as Rhizoclonium riparium (Roth) Harv. although its morphological variability was greater than that reported in the literature. Growth and photosynthetic studies indicated that the alga favoured temperatures between 20 and 30 ⁰C and relatively high light intensity (700 μE. m⁻². s⁻¹) and that it was highly productive. In addition, the alga exhibited photoadaptive ability, although it seemed to be sensitive to photoinhibition. Its success in the <b>maturation</b> <b>pond</b> was attributed to the favourable physico-chemical environment, particularly the high transparency of the effluent which allowed the penetration of PAR to the pond floor and to the alga's ability to adapt to the change in environment when it floated from the pond floor to its surface.

40|$|Waste {{stabilization}} ponds (WSPs) {{are one of}} {{the most}} prevalent types of domestic wastewater treatment technologies employed worldwide, and global stressors such as urbanization, population growth, climate change, and water scarcity have increased the demand for reusing treated wastewater. The safe reuse of treated wastewater in agriculture can ease water scarcity, aid in food production, and reduce environmental degradation from the discharge of wastewater effluent to surface waters. The ability to predict virus concentrations in wastewater effluent is an important criterion for determining whether wastewater is suitable for discharge to the environment or for reuse in agriculture. However, many uncertainties remain about virus removal efficiency in WSPs and there is currently no mechanistic or empirical model that reliably predicts virus removal in WSPs. The overall objective of this thesis research was to model the extent of virus removal in individual waste stabilization ponds to support the reuse of wastewater. A literature review was used to create a database of estimated apparent virus removal rate coefficients (Kv,app) in three different WSP types (anaerobic, facultative, and <b>maturation</b> <b>ponds).</b> The database consisted of 249 paired influent and effluent concentrations of enteric viruses or bacteriophages from 44 unique WSP systems, comprised of 112 individual WSPs from 19 different countries. Apparent virus removal rate coefficients (Kv,app) were calculated for each individual WSP using the following three mathematical models from reactor theory: complete mix, plug flow, and dispersed flow. Pearson’s correlation analysis was used to determine correlations between Kv,app values and the following design, operational, and environmental parameters: solar radiation, air temperature, pond depth, hydraulic retention time (HRT), and virus loading rates. The median Kv,app values were greater for anaerobic ponds than for facultative and maturation ponds; however, Kv,app values in facultative and <b>maturation</b> <b>ponds</b> had more significant correlations with design, operational, and environmental parameters. Additionally, Kv,app values appear to be significantly different for various types of enteric viruses and bacteriophages. Alternative multiple linear regression equations were developed to predict Kv,app values using the design, operational, and environmental parameters as explanatory variables. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) tests were used to select the most appropriate multiple linear regression equations with the least amount of explanatory variables. The most appropriate plug flow and dispersed flow multiple linear regression equations for predicting Kv,app values included air temperature and HRT as explanatory variables. The results indicate that the plug flow regression equation was able to better predict Kv,app values (R 2 = 0. 38) than the dispersed flow regression equation (R 2 = 0. 24) in facultative and <b>maturation</b> <b>ponds</b> based on the dataset. However, both the dispersed flow and plug flow models had R 2 values of approximately 0. 84 when they were used to predict effluent virus concentrations in facultative and <b>maturation</b> <b>ponds</b> based on the dataset. According to this research, the plug flow regression equation is recommended for predicting apparent virus removal rate coefficients in WSPs. However, a multi-model approach that utilizes both the plug flow and dispersed flow models may yield a more robust mathematical model that can improve WSP design, reliably predict virus removal in WSPs, and ultimately be used to support wastewater reuse...|$|R

However, the relative supremacy of the denitrification process over other nitrogen removal mechanisms (e. g., biological uptake) depends upon phytoplanktonic activity...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The {{performance}} {{evaluation of the}} waste stabilization pond (WSP) {{as a model of}} domestic wastewater treatment unit in rural area was carried out. The unit comprised of anaerobic, facultative and maturation ponds in two series. The effluents of WSP which are discharged in the drain had the BOD reduced to 109 - 245 mg L− 1 (Mean = 145. 3 mg L− 1, 50. 65 % removal), while the COD was reduced to 221 - 400 mg L− 1 (Mean = 289 mg L− 1, 48. 95 % removal) and the total suspended solids (TSS) were reduced to 118 - 190 mg L− 1 (Mean = 157. 8 mg L− 1, 44. 3 % removal). The reduction percentages of total coliform (TC), faecal coliform (FC), E. coli, faecal streptococci (FS), salmonellae and Listeria were 98. 8, 95. 6, 79. 4, 96. 8, 97. 9 and 89. 5 % respectively. Also, the removal percentages of coliphage and infectious rotaviruses were 49. 03 and 99. 66 % respectively. Identical sequences of rotaviruses VP- 6 detected in the final effluent of the pond and the drain were observed. Euglena variables and Chlamydomonas reinhardii were predominant in anaerobic, facultative and maturation effluents. It has been noticed that pollution affected species diversity of zooplankton; the number of species in facultative pond was 8 species because of high pollution level, whereas in <b>maturation</b> <b>pond</b> increased to 21 species. Also, pollution in anaerobic pond increased density of ciliates (Protozoa) which are known to be bio-indicators of organic pollution. The percent removal of ciliates in the <b>maturation</b> <b>pond</b> was 70 %. It is recommended to make some modifications in the design to increase the efficiency of WSP...|$|E
40|$|In {{spite of}} the {{existence}} of numerous treatment plants throughout Morocco, the quantity of treated wastewater in this country is still low. At the Institut Agronomique et Vétérinaire Hassan II in Rabat (Morocco), a new approach combining high-rate anaerobic/aerobic units is used to treat a daily average flow of 63 m 3 coming mainly from the student’s home and restaurant of the campus. The treatment system includes one anaerobic pre-treatment unit followed by a post-treatment, aerobic unit. The former consists of a two-step upflow anaerobic reactor which includes two reactors in series and an external settler. The post-treatment unit includes a high-rate algal <b>pond</b> and two <b>maturation</b> <b>ponds.</b> Since the end of 2001, a sand/gravel filtration unit was introduced between the anaerobic and the aerobic units leading to the improvement of nutrients and pathogens removals in the post-treatment unit. Since, even under this new configuration, some particles coming from the anaerobic reactors were reaching the post treatment unit; a new filtration unit was constructed during the summer 2004. The purpose of this filtration was to remove any particulate matter originated from th...|$|R
40|$|The {{design and}} {{performance}} {{evaluation of a}} model domestic wastewater treatment unit was carried out. The treatment unit was a Waste Stabilization Pond (WSP) comprised of one facultative <b>pond,</b> three <b>maturation</b> <b>ponds,</b> and a contact filtration unit, all in series. The effluent of the WSP, after filtration through clay media, had the BOD reduced to 15. 4 mg/l, from 356 mg/L indicating a 95. 67 % removal level. A Faecal Coliform (FC) count of the influent sample gave 1 x 108 FC/ 100 ml,. whereas the effluent gave 9 FC/ 100 ml, which was 99. 99 % FC removal. It was concluded that the effluent from the WSP is therefore suitable for discharge to the environment. It also met the requirement of 25 mg/L BOD standard of Federal Environmental Protection Agency (FEPA). A rice husk filter media {{was found to be}} non-promising earlier in the removal process. The treatment system can be recommended to private/public estates {{in order to have a}} more environmentally friendly discharge of domestic wastewater...|$|R
40|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} problems with disigning and maintaining a landfill is managing the leachate that is generated when water passes trough the waste. Problems that obtain in lechate treatment installation are drying at dry season and overflow at rain season. Besides, leachate effluent concentrations is higher than standard quality according to Central Java Province regulation 10 / 2004. the extensive area of landfill and differences topography caused difficulty if only one installation built. Installation that will be evaluated and designed is the installation located on zone 1 Putri Cempo landfill and will be the pilot project for the other zones. According to those conditions, leachae treatment installation will be design with this steps, identifying amount of leachate flowrate, identifying leachate quality and evaluating leachate treatment exsisting, analyzing and planning alternative processing of new leachate treatment and designing new leachate treatment installation, calculating cost budget plan to build new leachate treatment plant. New leachate treatment are 2 anaerobic ponds, 2 facultative <b>ponds,</b> 2 <b>maturation</b> <b>ponds</b> and wetland. Budget plan to build leachate treatment amount Rp. 325, 420, 000. 00.
