5|$|Balla's {{interest}} in capturing {{a single moment}} {{in a series of}} planes was inspired by his fascination with chronophotography. In later, <b>more</b> <b>abstract</b> works created during World War I, Balla used planes of color to suggest movement.|$|E
5|$|Besides {{counting}} fruits, addition {{can also}} represent combining other physical objects. Using systematic generalizations, addition {{can also be}} defined on <b>more</b> <b>abstract</b> quantities, such as integers, rational numbers, real numbers and complex numbers and other abstract objects such as vectors and matrices.|$|E
5|$|Architecturally, most war {{memorials}} {{were relatively}} conservative in design, aiming to use established styles {{to produce a}} tragic but comforting, noble and enduring commemoration of the war dead. Classical themes were particularly common, taking the prevailing styles of the late 19th century and typically simplifying them to produce cleaner, <b>more</b> <b>abstract</b> memorials. Allegorical and symbolic features, frequently drawing on Christian imagery, were used to communicate themes of self-sacrifice, victory and death. Some memorials adopted a medievalist theme instead, looking backwards to a more secure past, while others used emerging realist and Art Deco architectural styles to communicate the themes of the war.|$|E

50|$|During the 1970s Albrecht's work became <b>more</b> and <b>more</b> <b>abstracted,</b> {{although}} it often still began with {{observations of the}} landscape, making studies in places like Auckland's West Coast and Manukau Harbour. Art historian Linda Gill notes that as Albrecht's paintings became <b>more</b> <b>abstracted,</b> her titles - originally prosaic, such as Table-Cloth with Curtain - became 'as poetic as her use of colour: Grey Ledge, Winged Spill, Storm Swell, Fritillary, Cushioned Fall,Penumbra.' An exhibition of American painter Morris Louis' large abstract acrylic paintings at the Auckland Art Gallery in 1971 encouraged Albrecht's commitment to her abstract style and encouraged her to be more bold.|$|R
50|$|Maldarelli's {{classical}} training {{allowed him}} to obtain commissions for both garden decorations and architectural sculpture. However as he grew older his work became <b>more</b> and <b>more</b> <b>abstracted,</b> though it would remain basically figurative.|$|R
5|$|From {{this model}} of Kantian ethics, O'Neill begins to develop a theory of justice. She argues that the {{rejection}} of certain principles, such as deception and coercion, provides {{a starting point for}} basic conceptions of justice, which she argues are more determinate for human beings that the <b>more</b> <b>abstract</b> principles of equality or liberty. Nevertheless, she concedes that these principles may seem to be excessively demanding: there are many actions and institutions that do rely on non-universalisable principles, such as injury.|$|E
5|$|Heterodox economists {{adhere to}} {{theories}} sufficiently {{outside the mainstream}} to be marginalized and treated as irrelevant by the establishment. Initially, heterodox economists including Joan Robinson, worked alongside mainstream economists, but heterodox groups isolated themselves and created insular groups in the late 1960s and 1970s. Present day heterodox economists often publish in their own journals rather {{than those of the}} mainstream and eschew formal modeling in favor of <b>more</b> <b>abstract</b> theoretical work.|$|E
5|$|Historically, {{the first}} ideas leading to vector spaces {{can be traced}} back as far as the 17th century's {{analytic}} geometry, matrices, systems of linear equations, and Euclidean vectors. The modern, <b>more</b> <b>abstract</b> treatment, first formulated by Giuseppe Peano in 1888, encompasses more general objects than Euclidean space, but much of the theory can be seen as an extension of classical geometric ideas like lines, planes and their higher-dimensional analogs.|$|E
5000|$|Leslie Shows' earlier {{works were}} {{mixed-media}} collages depicting abstracted landscapes. [...] Her more recent paintings, while retaining {{the use of}} mixed media, have become <b>more</b> <b>abstracted</b> and focus on mineral textures and geologic features.|$|R
50|$|Green's earlier {{works are}} {{predominantly}} cityscapes, such as Laight St., View No. 1 (1975). The paintings {{that she made}} during her first years in New York often focused on the architecture of building facades, evidently inspired by her architectural studies in Paris in the 1960s. During the mid- to late-1970s, her work became <b>more</b> <b>abstracted</b> as her focus shifted to the portrayal of centralized objects isolated in space. In the 1980s, her work became even <b>more</b> <b>abstracted</b> with works like Summer Heat (1981). With this work she introduces the use of ambiguous, calligraphic marks that allude to written language. During this period of her oeuvre, Green emphasized strong colors and basic forms, like circles and fan shapes.|$|R
5000|$|There {{are several}} kinds of Tibetan tiger rug designs. Some consist of [...] "realistic" [...] renderings of tiger pelts, while closely related rugs show <b>more</b> <b>abstracted</b> {{versions}} of tiger stripes. Another type of tiger rug shows a [...] "whole pelt", complete with legs and grinning face.|$|R
5|$|In {{addition}} to being an idea of considerable theoretical interest, M-theory provides a framework for constructing models of real world physics that combine general relativity with the standard model of particle physics. Phenomenology is the branch of theoretical physics in which physicists construct realistic models of nature from <b>more</b> <b>abstract</b> theoretical ideas. String phenomenology {{is the part of}} string theory that attempts to construct realistic models of particle physics based on string and M-theory.|$|E
5|$|Painting is {{a recent}} art form common among women artists. Famous artists include Yvette Bouquet from Koumac who has {{produced}} paintings with Pacific and Oceania themes, Paula Boi, whose paintings are of <b>more</b> <b>abstract</b> scenes, and Denise Tuvouane and Maryline Thydjepache who use mixed art forms. Bus stop shelters are common places where their paintings are illustrated.|$|E
5|$|Van der Weyden {{developed}} {{the conventions of}} northern portraiture and was hugely influential on the following generations of painters. Rather than merely follow van Eyck's meticulous attention to detail, van der Weyden created <b>more</b> <b>abstract</b> and sensual representations. He was highly sought after as a portraitist, yet there are noticeable similarities in his portraits, likely because he used and reused the same underdrawings, which met common ideals of rank and piety. These were then adapted to show the facial characteristics and expressions of the particular sitter.|$|E

25|$|Along with Richter, {{her sister}} Catherine Burchfield Parker (1926-2012) and daughter, Peggy Richter Haug (Born May 11, 1948), also became painters. Parker painted <b>more</b> <b>abstracts</b> but Peggy also liked to paint landscapes {{and said she}} loved the Western New York countryside. When Haug was a {{teenager}} and young adult, she participated in three-generational exhibits alongside her mother and grandfather.|$|R
5|$|Albion's first regular shirt badge {{appeared}} in the late 1960s and early 1970s where it was blue. Although it featured the throstle, it {{did not include the}} blue and white striped shield of the club badge. A similar design was also used during the late 1980s and early 1990s. In the mid-1970s, a <b>more</b> <b>abstract</b> version of the throstle was used on the club's shirts, while in the late 1970s through to the mid-1980s, an embroidered WBA logo was displayed, a common abbreviation of the club's name in print. Not until the early 21st century did the full club badge appear on the team's shirts.|$|E
5|$|Radiohead {{were largely}} {{inactive}} following their 1997–1998 tour; after its end, their only public performance in 1998 {{was at an}} Amnesty International concert in Paris. Yorke later said that during that period the band came close to splitting up, {{and that he had}} developed severe depression. In early 1999, Radiohead began work on a follow-up to OK Computer. Although the album's success meant there was no longer any pressure or a deadline from their record label, tension during this period was high. Band members all had different visions for Radiohead's future, and Yorke experienced writer's block, influencing him toward a <b>more</b> <b>abstract,</b> fragmented form of songwriting. Radiohead secluded themselves with producer Nigel Godrich in studios in Paris, Copenhagen, and Gloucester, and in their newly completed studio in Oxford. Eventually, all the members agreed on a new musical direction, redefining their instrumental roles. After nearly 18 months, Radiohead's recording sessions were completed in April 2000.|$|E
5|$|The Frank sisters each {{hoped to}} return to school {{as soon as they were}} able, and {{continued}} with their studies while in hiding. Margot took a shorthand course by correspondence in Bep Voskuijl's name and received high marks. Most of Anne's time was spent reading and studying, and she regularly wrote and edited her diary entries. In addition to providing a narrative of events as they occurred, she wrote about her feelings, beliefs, and ambitions, subjects she felt she could not discuss with anyone. As her confidence in her writing grew, and as she began to mature, she wrote of <b>more</b> <b>abstract</b> subjects such as her belief in God, and how she defined human nature.|$|E

50|$|The Tilled Field (French: La terre labourée; Catalan: Terra llaurada) is a 1923-4 oil-on-canvas {{painting}} by Catalan painter Joan Miró, depicting a stylised {{view of his}} family's farm at Mont-roig del Camp in Catalonia. The painting shows development from Miró's earlier works, such as The Farm, and {{is considered to be}} one of his first Surrealist works, created around {{the same time as the}} <b>more</b> <b>abstracted</b> Catalan Landscape (The Hunter).|$|R

5|$|The {{harmonium}} {{was out of}} {{tune with}} everything. It wasn't even in tune with itself. She insisted on playing it on everything {{so we had to}} figure out ways to separate her voice from it as much as possible and then find instrumental voices that would be compatible with the harmonium track... As an arranger you're usually trying to take the songs and put a structure on them, but what I thought was valuable was when you took the centre out of the track and worked around the central core of the tonality and changes. That left you with a sort of floating free-form tapestry behind what she was doing, which is when things became <b>more</b> <b>abstract.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{opportunity}} for Durkheim to a receive major academic appointment in Paris was inhibited by {{his approach to}} society. From 1882 to 1887 he taught philosophy at several provincial schools. In 1885 he decided to leave for Germany, where for two years he studied sociology at the universities of Marburg, Berlin and Leipzig. As Durkheim indicated in several essays, it was in Leipzig that he learned to appreciate the value of empiricism and its language of concrete, complex things, {{in sharp contrast to}} the <b>more</b> <b>abstract,</b> clear and simple ideas of the Cartesian method. By 1886, as part of his doctoral dissertation, he had completed the draft of his The Division of Labour in Society, and was working towards establishing the new science of sociology.|$|E
5|$|The {{university}} logo, the upheld torch, {{is derived}} from the Statue of Liberty, signifying NYU's service to New York City. The torch is depicted on both the NYU seal and the <b>more</b> <b>abstract</b> NYU logo, designed in 1965 by renowned graphic designer Tom Geismar of the branding and design firm Chermayeff & Geismar. There are at least two versions of the possible origin of the university color, violet. Some believe that it may have been chosen because violets are said to have grown abundantly in Washington Square and around the buttresses of the Old University Building. Others argue that the color may have been adopted because the violet was the flower associated with Athens, the center of learning in ancient Greece.|$|E

50|$|Middleditch was a painter, {{draughtsman}} and printmaker. He {{drew his}} motifs {{from the natural}} world: grasses, water, feathers, opening petals, reflections etc. Gradually shifting observed patterns became fleeting abstracted movements often caught from water currents and light effects. His later work became much <b>more</b> <b>abstracted,</b> concerned with repeating patterns as if seen from above and filling the picture-frame; drawing influence from kilims and Persian carpets. Middleditch died in 1987 in Chelmsford, Essex.|$|R

5|$|While some {{titles of}} the World of Mana series do share direct {{connections}} with other installments, the {{games of the}} series have few concrete links. There is no overall explicit in-game chronological order. Further, according to Koichi Ishii in 2006 the games do not take place {{in exactly the same}} world, and characters or elements who appear in different titles are best considered alternate versions of each other. Instead, the connections between each title are <b>more</b> <b>abstract</b> than story-based, linked only on the karmic level. Contradicting this assertion, Ishii has also {{said in an interview that}} Children is set ten years after Dawn, while Heroes is set one generation prior to Seiken Densetsu 3.|$|E
25|$|Some {{readers of}} Herodotus {{believe that his}} habit of tying events back to {{personal}} motives signifies an inability to see broader and <b>more</b> <b>abstract</b> reasons for action. Gould argues to the contrary that this is likely because Herodotus attempts to provide the rational reasons, as understood by his contemporaries, rather than providing <b>more</b> <b>abstract</b> reasons.|$|E
25|$|Multiplication is also defined {{for other}} types of numbers, such as complex numbers, and <b>more</b> <b>abstract</b> constructs, like matrices.

50|$|Baber {{began her}} career working {{primarily}} in oils, but began experimenting with watercolor paints in the 1950s. Her experimentation with watercolor initiated {{a shift in}} style for Baber as she went from painting still lifes to creating <b>more</b> <b>abstracted</b> works. Her abstract works focus on color and form with shapes such as the circle being a common motif. Baber was well known for her use of light and color holding several exhibitions devoted to these themes.|$|R
50|$|The RuneQuest {{combat system}} has a {{subsystem}} for hit location. Successful attacks are allocated randomly (or by decision) to {{a part of}} the target's body. In RuneQuest, a lucky hit against a character's leg, weapon arm, or head could have specific effects on the game's mechanics and narrative. This was a unique part of the game's combat system and helped to separate it from the <b>more</b> <b>abstracted,</b> hit-point-based combat of competitors such as Dungeons & Dragons.|$|R
