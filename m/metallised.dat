Of the Gringotts Wizarding Bank, he said, [...] "our banking hall, like any other, is made of marble and big marble columns. And it has great strength. The fact that the goblins are the bankers and tellers at the counter helps that feeling of grandeur and solidity and the big proportions. That {{was part of the}} fun of the set: we exaggerated the size of it, we exaggerated the weight of it, and we even exaggerated the shine of the marble." [...] About the multiplication of treasure in one of the bank's vaults, he noted, [...] "We made literally thousands of pieces for it and vacuum <b>metallised</b> them to be shiny gold and silver. John Richardson, the special effects supervisor, made a floor that was capable of rising on different levels, so there was kind of a physical swelling of the treasure on it." ...|$|E

50|$|<b>Metallised</b> {{films have}} a {{reflective}} silvery surface similar to aluminium foil and are highly flammable. The coating also reduces the permeability {{of the film}} to light, water and oxygen. The properties of the film remain, such as higher toughness, {{the ability to be}} heat sealed, and a lower density at a lower cost than an aluminium foil. This gives <b>metallised</b> films some advantages over aluminium foil and aluminium foil laminates. It was thought that <b>metallised</b> films would become a replacement for aluminium foil laminates, but current films still cannot match the barrier properties of foil.

40|$|During {{this thesis}} a new {{infrastructure}} of methods to template functional materials at specific sites in a DNA architecture using molecular recognition of specific DNA duplexes has been developed. The project {{focused on the}} use of naturally occurring duplex DNA and the Tollens’ reaction as a mild source of metal amenable to reduction in the presence of aldehyde functional groups. The advantages of this choice are: 1) The use of naturally-occurring DNA increases modularity; 2) The Tollens’ reagent acts as a mild selective <b>metallising</b> reagent that enables the reduction of metal ions at specific sites along DNA.

40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} {{difficulties}} of <b>metallising</b> grooves created using inkjet printing and laser doping in high efficiency solar cell structures. Poor metallisation of these grooves has been a persistent problem due to the shallowness of the created grooves and, {{in the case of}} inkjet printing, the smoothness of the groove surface. In this thesis we select a suitable metallisation technique for plating double sided or interdigitated contact solar cells; identify and understand the current problems faced using this metallisation technique; establish techniques to overcome these limitations; and evaluate the performance of the proposed solutions. The thesis begins with a review of buried contact solar cell structures, laser doping and inkjet printing technologies and the suitability of various wet chemical plating processes. Having identified electroless plating as the most suitable metallisation technique, we continue with an in-depth study of the chemistry behind electroless metal deposition and the effect of different metal solution constituents in the deposition reaction. Experiments in <b>metallising</b> inkjet printed and laser doped grooves find that the metal adhesion of heavily doped phosphorous grooves is the limiting factor in the application of these technologies, and that palladium activation is the cause of this metal-silicon adhesion failure. Electroless plating using nickel boron reducing agent, combined with surface roughening techniques in the case of inkjet printed cells, is investigated as an alternative to palladium activation in both laser doped and inkjet printed cells. We show that excellent adhesion can be achieved using the novel metallisation scheme. An in-depth study identifies the optimal conditions for forming silicide and removing unreacted nickel, therefore improving the adhesion and obtaining negligible contact resistance. We continue by presenting a detailed investigation into the different available contact resistance measurement techniques. The thesis concludes by showing that negligible ohmic contact resistance on both heavily doped phosphorous and boron grooves can be achieved through the use of the proposed novel metallisation scheme...|$|R
