By using the Separation of Variables technique in conjunction with Green 2 ̆ 7 s Function a numerical solution to the temperature field induced by the radiation is found.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{construct}} the domains of structural stability for optimal discrete flows, to compare the discrete case with the case of the Beckmann model of continuous flows, and to find the structurally stable minimal-cost flows for the hierarchical central-place models. The mathematical basis for this construction is the sensitivity analysis of the linear programming problem instead of the generic theory of differential equations and the catastrophe theory in the continuous case. The domain of structural stability is the Cartesian product of the domain (cone) of the existence of flow with a preset topological structure and the domain (wedge) of optimality of the flow with the same structure. A detailed algorithm for the construction of these domains of structural stability is given. This algorithm leads to the vector generalization of <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>potentials</b> of Kantorovitch - Dantzig for the transportation problem and also gives a description of structural change for dynamic flows. As an application, the generalized (Christaller - Parr) hierarchical three-level central-place models are investigated, for which structurally stable optimal flows exist. ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The first {{three-dimensional}} {{boundary value}} problem is considered for the basic equations of statics of the elastic mixture theory in the finite and infinite domains bounded by the closed surfaces. It is proved that this problem splits into two problems whose investigation is reduced to the first {{boundary value problem}} for an elliptic equation which structurally coincides with an equation of statics of an isotropic elastic body. Using the potential method and the theory of Fredholm integral equations of second kind, the existence and uniqueness of {{the solution of the}} first boundary value problem is proved for the split equation. Basic homogeneous equations of statics of the elastic mixture theory have the form [1] a 1 ∆u ′ + b 1 grad div u ′ + c∆u ′ ′ + d grad div u ′ ′ = 0, c∆u ′ + d grad div u ′ + a 2 ∆u ′ ′ + b 2 grad div u ′ ′ = 0, (1) where a 1, b 1, c, d, a 2, b 2 are the coefficients kharacterizing the physical properties of an elastic mixture, u ′ and u ′ ′ are partial displacements. The problem to be considered in this paper is formulated as follows: given a continuous displacement vector on the boundary S, in the domain D + (or D −) find a solution u(u ′, u ′ ′) ∈ C(D ±) ∩ C 2 (D ±) of equation (1).

40|$|In this thesis, {{we apply}} the <b>method</b> <b>of</b> layer <b>potentials</b> {{to prove that}} there is a unique {{solution}} to the Dirichlet problem for Laplace's equation in C^ 1 -domains. We assume that C^ 1 -domains are subsets of R^d, d≥ 2, they are bounded and they have connected boundaries. In addition, we assume that the boundary data of the Dirichlet problem belong to the Lebesgue space L^p(∂ D,σ) with p∈(1,∞). We will follow the work of E. B. Fabes, M. Jodeit Jr. and N. M. Rivière. In their work, they solved various boundary value problems in domains that were merely C^ 1 by applying the <b>method</b> <b>of</b> layer <b>potentials.</b> The <b>method</b> <b>of</b> layer <b>potentials</b> is a procedure for solving the boundary value problems in the form <b>of</b> layer <b>potentials.</b> We will use it to solve the Dirichlet problem {{in the form of the}} double layer potential. The double layer potential satisfies Laplace's equation and the boundary values of the double layer potential are given by an operator 12 I+K. It turns out that in C^ 1 -domains the operator K is compact on L^p(∂ D). Consequently, we can use the Fredholm theory to deduce that the operator 12 I+K is invertible and thus, we obtain a double layer potential solution to the Dirichlet problem. Finally, we will establish the uniqueness of the solution by using the properties of Green's function. In the end of this thesis, we will also discuss how the <b>method</b> <b>of</b> layer <b>potentials</b> can be applied to the Dirichlet problem for Laplace's equation in Lipschitz domains with L^ 2 -boundary data by following the doctoral dissertation of G.
