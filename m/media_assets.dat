25|$|In November 1992, Don Bluth Entertainment found {{investment}} from UK filmmaker John Boorman's production company Merlin Films and Hong Kong-based company <b>Media</b> <b>Assets.</b> Merlin Films and <b>Media</b> <b>Assets</b> invested US$14M {{to purchase the}} studio's next three films and a further US$6M to ensure {{the completion of the}} two partially completed films, with further investment to follow on the third film, The Pebble and the Penguin, then still in early development. A condition of the investment was that Merlin Films and <b>Media</b> <b>Assets</b> would have a close involvement in the management of Don Bluth Entertainment's financial operations, following reports of the studio's past mismanagement. In 1993, STAR TV (Asia), the parent company of <b>Media</b> <b>Assets,</b> was purchased by Rupert Murdoch (son of former Australian journalist Keith Murdoch, an editor for Adelaide's former The News), effectively making the studio a subsidiary of The News namesake News Corporation.|$|E
25|$|Although A Troll in Central Park {{was closer}} to completion, Merlin and <b>Media</b> <b>Assets</b> decided that Thumbelina {{was more likely to}} be a {{commercial}} success, and pressed for its completion and release first. MGM/UA, who planned to distribute the films in the US, had already backed off in the wake of DBE's bankruptcy, doubtful that the pictures would ever be completed. J Entertainment, which was slated to release the films overseas, sold their rights to <b>Media</b> <b>Assets.</b> Warner Bros. picked up Thumbelina and subsequent films for worldwide distribution. The film was released in March 1994. Critical reception was generally indifferent to mixed, and the film performed poorly at the box office, grossing US$11.4M.|$|E
25|$|In March 2006, Packer began {{discussing}} {{whether to}} sell Channel Nine and the Australian Consolidated Press magazine group {{to help fund}} his move into the international gaming and tourism business. Given changes in media due to the Internet and pay-TV, Packer {{was concerned about the}} future of free-to-air television. On 17 October 2006, Packer's team finalised a deal to sell 50% of the <b>media</b> <b>assets</b> - which also included a 50% stake in web portal Ninemsn and a 51% stake in Carsales - to private equity group CVC Asia Pacific for 4.5 billion, plus an additional A$1 billion in equity in the new company, which would be called PBL Media.|$|E

After {{the completion of the}} sale, a press release announced the name change of the Washington Post Company to Graham Holdings Company (the change was made effective on November 29, 2013).|$|E
25|$|After The Land Before Time, {{the studio}} severed its {{connection}} with Amblin and negotiated with UK-based Goldcrest Films, which invested in and distributed two additional features, All Dogs Go to Heaven and Rock-a-Doodle. In 1989, during {{the production of}} All Dogs Go to Heaven, founding member John Pomeroy {{and many of the}} remaining US staff members returned to America to form a US wing in Burbank, California. The studio found itself in financial difficulty in 1992 when Goldcrest withdrew funding due to concerns about the poor box office returns of its most recent films and budgetary over-runs in its in-production films, Thumbelina, A Troll in Central Park and The Pebble and the Penguin. Another British film company, Merlin Films, and Hong Kong media company <b>Media</b> <b>Assets</b> invested in the studio to fund the completion and release of the three partially completed films.|$|E
25|$|As a key {{facet of}} the {{public-private}} partnership with Sarasota, Angelos developed a unique “sisterhood city” integrated marketing approach {{to capitalize on the}} power of the Baltimore Orioles and Major League Baseball to create economic impact through tourism incubation for the city. The approach utilizes the Orioles’ multiplatform <b>media</b> <b>assets</b> to market Sarasota to consumers in the Mid-Atlantic region year-round. According to the Sarasota Convention and Visitors Bureau, visits and inquiries from Mid-Atlantic residents have increased by double-digits since the partnership began. The partnership was recognized by industry publication Sports Business Journal for providing the “marketing muscle” necessary to generate the tourist dollars that are “more important than ever to making the spring training business equation work.” In late 2013, the Tampa Bay Business Journal heralded the results of the partnership in a cover story, describing the deal as a home run for Sarasota’s tourism industry.|$|E

25|$|Black {{resigned}} from the board of Hollinger in 2005, many of Hollinger International's assets ended up being sold at prices significantly lower than those contemplated by incomplete talks while Black was with the company. By the early 2000s, {{it was clear that}} Black had accurately anticipated the decline in profitability of print <b>media</b> <b>assets</b> and sought to divest those types of assets held by Hollinger before their value was irrevocably diminished. The criminal sanctions on Black not overturned were for removing 13 boxes of paper from his office a few days before he had to move offices, and under the gaze of security cameras he has installed, and for receiving US $285,000 as a non-compete payment that was approved by the independent director and publicly disclosed, but where the company secretary had neglected, in what the trial judge considered to be a clerical oversight, to have signed by the parties.|$|E
25|$|In late 1993, {{shortly after}} the Merlin Films/Media Assets deal, founders Don Bluth and Gary Goldman met with then-President of 20th Century Fox Television Peter Chernin, and CEO and Chairman of Fox Filmed Entertainment Bill Mechanic to discuss the {{creation}} of a feature animation division. While Bluth and Goldman wanted to remain at the Dublin studio, arguing that because <b>Media</b> <b>Assets</b> was owned by Fox's parent company News Corporation, Fox effectively had a working animation studio already, Mechanic wanted Bluth and Goldman to head up a new studio in Phoenix, Arizona instead. Bluth and Goldman intended to remain in Ireland to complete work on The Pebble and the Penguin, but when they were forced to make changes to the film they left the studio and began working with Mechanic to set up Fox Animation Studios. After the release of The Pebble and the Penguin in 1995, it went bankrupt and operations at the Dublin studio were wound down. Many of the staff moved to the new Fox Animation studio, and the studio closed its doors later the same year.|$|E
25|$|In early 2007, the Portuguese conglomerate, Sonae's {{takeover}} offer for Portugal Telecom failed. PT's board rejected an initial bid, worth EUR 11.1 bn, in February 2006. Sonae.com's takeover bid opposed Belmiro de Azevedo (founder and historical chairman of Sonae holding company) {{and his son}} Paulo Azevedo (then the head officer of Sonae.com telecommunications operator) to the investor José Berardo and PT's administrators Zeinal Bava and Henrique Granadeiro. In April 2007 the European Commission gave an ultimatum to the Portuguese government ordering it {{to give up on}} the 500 golden shares pack that it owned on the company and that enable special veto powers to the government on vital issues. This could give the government a decisive role in the bid by any company to buy Portugal Telecom. In November 2007, Portugal Telecom spun off its <b>media</b> <b>assets</b> (PT Multimédia), that included TV Cabo and Lusomundo Cinemas. In January 2008, the European Commission began legal proceedings against the Portuguese government over its 'golden share' in incumbent telecoms operator Portugal Telecom. The 500 golden shares with extended voting rights, allowing it to block potential takeover bids, were the reason for the Commission's legal action. Similarly, in November 2005, the Commission had forced the Spanish government to give up its golden share in the other telecommunications' major player in the Iberian Peninsula, the Spanish telecoms giant Telefónica.|$|E

2500|$|Due {{to changes}} insisted by MGM, {{animation}} fell behind and additional coloring {{had to be}} done at a Hungarian animation studio. Don Bluth and Gary Goldman were so dissatisfied with the final film that they left during production (to help set up Fox Animation Studios) and demanded to be uncredited as the directors. The book Animated Films said, [...] "changes at MGM during production...resulted in the project being affected in terms of production value". In a 2001 edition of his magazine Toon Talk, Bluth admitted [...] "Penguin had story problems. We knew it. The crew knew it". Though he attempted to fix these issues when his Irish studio got taken over by the Hong Kong company <b>Media</b> <b>Assets,</b> [...] "the story and film were now compromised", so neither he or Goldman stayed. They had their names removed from the film's credits and accepted an offer by Bill Mechanic - 20th Century Fox's then-president - to set up a new animation studio in the US (which would become Fox Animation Studios). Bluth said to his animation crew [...] "I can't chew with someone else's mouth". Despite this executive interference, The Animated Movie Guide noted MGM/UA producer Walter Mirisch's comments on the film: [...] "I think it's one of Don's best films ever...There's no issue of our claiming the credit for this. It's his film".|$|E
