40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to analyse the pricing {{behaviour}} of print media firms when consumption on reader <b>markets</b> <b>is</b> addictive or habituated. However, not only the reader but also the advertising <b>market</b> has to <b>be</b> considered by a publisher optimising profits. Because print media <b>markets</b> <b>are</b> highly concentrated a monopoly-monopoly model is built, where both <b>markets</b> <b>are</b> of monopolistic structure. Moreover, a monopoly-duopoly model is considered, where only the reader <b>market</b> <b>is</b> monopolistic but the advertising <b>market</b> <b>is</b> of duopolistic structure. To compare the results from the models regarding habit effects, simple static models are presented as a benchmark. ...|$|R

5|$|By the 14thcentury, Norwich {{was one of}} {{the largest}} and most prosperous cities in England, and Norwich <b>Market</b> <b>was</b> a major trading hub. Control of, and income from, the <b>market</b> <b>was</b> ceded by the monarchy to the city of Norwich in 1341, from which time it {{provided}} a significant source of income for the local council. Freed from royal control, the <b>market</b> <b>was</b> reorganised to benefit the city as much as possible. Norwich and the surrounding region were devastated by plague and famine in the latter half of the 14thcentury, with the population falling by over 50%. Following the plague years, Norwich came under the control of local merchants and the economy was rebuilt. In the early 15thcentury, a Guildhall was built next to the market to serve as a centre for local government and law enforcement. The largest surviving mediaeval civic building in Britain outside London, it remained the seat of local government until 1938 and in use as a law court until 1985.|$|E
5|$|Coal {{and other}} {{minerals}} were extracted {{in the west}} of Scotland from medieval times; getting the heavy product to <b>market</b> <b>was</b> always a challenge, and this encouraged the development of tracked systems; the earliest plateways {{in the vicinity of}} Ayr date from—at the latest—1775.|$|E
5|$|Following the First World War, {{the local}} {{authority}} began to systematically buy {{up all the}} stalls on the market, eventually bringing the entire market into public ownership. It was radically redesigned in the 1930s: stalls were arranged into parallel rows and a new City Hall was built along the entire {{western side of the}} marketplace to replace the by then inadequate Guildhall. This new arrangement survived with few significant changes {{for the rest of the}} 20thcentury. By the 1990s, the <b>market</b> <b>was</b> becoming decrepit and, in 2003, proposals were made for another radical rebuilding of the area. These proposals were extremely controversial and were abandoned in 2004 in favour of a scheme which retained the parallel rows of stalls, but replaced the old stalls with steel units of four stalls each. The rebuilt <b>market</b> <b>was</b> completed in early 2006 and is one of the largest markets in Britain.|$|E
