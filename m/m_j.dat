The aesthetic and constructional design of the bridges was also heavily criticised. Over the next 15 years, almost all of the original carriageway had to be replaced with asphalt.|$|E

5|$|Mounseer Nongtongpaw was {{originally}} published by William Godwin's publishing firm, <b>M.</b> <b>J.</b> Godwin, in 1808 {{as part of}} its Juvenile Library series. English editions have been located for 1811, 1812, 1823, and 1830 and Philadelphia editions have been located for 1814 and c. 1824. The original edition was illustrated by a protégé of Godwin, William Mulready. Shelley biographer Emily Sunstein speculates that some of the verses may have been written to match illustrations that were already designed. The copper plate engravings are reproduced in Peter and Iona Opie's Nursery Companion.|$|E
