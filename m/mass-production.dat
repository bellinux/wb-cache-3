5|$|Despite the controversy, {{the first}} E85 {{flexible}} fuel vehicles {{were introduced in}} November 2008. The first two models available in the Thai market were the Volvo S80 and the C30. The S80 is manufactured locally and the C30 is imported. By {{the time of the}} introduction of flex vehicles there were already two gas stations with E85 fuel available. During 2009 it was expected that 15 fueling stations in Bangkok will have E85 fuel available. In October 2009 the Mitsubishi Lancer Ex was launched becoming the first <b>mass-production</b> E85 flexi-fuel vehicle produced in Thailand.|$|E
5|$|Ingham (1991) {{shows how}} small, {{independent}} {{iron and steel}} manufacturers survived and prospered from the 1870s through the 1950s, despite competition from much larger, standardized production firms. These smaller firms were built on a culture that valued local markets and the beneficial role of business in the local community. Small firms concentrated on specialized products, particularly structural steel, where the economies of scale of larger firms were no advantage. They embraced technological change more cautiously than larger firms. They also had less antagonistic relations with workers and employed {{a higher percentage of}} highly skilled workers than their <b>mass-production</b> counterparts.|$|E
5|$|Several plug-in {{electric}} vehicle fire incidents {{have taken place}} since the introduction of <b>mass-production</b> plug-in {{electric vehicle}}s in 2008. Most {{of them have been}} thermal runaway incidents related to the lithium-ion batteries and have involved the Zotye M300 EV, Chevrolet Volt, Fisker Karma, BYD e6, Dodge Ram 1500 Plug-in Hybrid, Toyota Prius Plug-in Hybrid, Mitsubishi i-MiEV and Outlander P-HEV. , four fires after a crash have been reported associated with the batteries of all-electric cars involving a BYD e6 and three Tesla Model S cars.|$|E
5|$|The initial non-military {{application}} of distributed element filters {{was in the}} microwave links used by telecommunications companies to provide the backbone of their networks. These links were also used by other industries with large, fixed networks, notably television broadcasters. Such applications were part of large capital investment programs. However, <b>mass-production</b> manufacturing made the technology cheap enough to incorporate in domestic satellite television systems. An emerging application is in superconducting filters {{for use in the}} cellular base stations operated by mobile phone companies.|$|E
5|$|Chemical vapor {{deposition}} is {{a method}} by which diamond can be grown from a hydrocarbon gas mixture. Since the early 1980s, this method {{has been the subject}} of intensive worldwide research. Whereas the <b>mass-production</b> of high-quality diamond crystals make the HPHT process the more suitable choice for industrial applications, the flexibility and simplicity of CVD setups explain the popularity of CVD growth in laboratory research. The advantages of CVD diamond growth include the ability to grow diamond over large areas and on various substrates, and the fine control over the chemical impurities and thus properties of the diamond produced. Unlike HPHT, CVD process does not require high pressures, as the growth typically occurs at pressures under 27 kPa.|$|E
5|$|The {{practice}} of managing design {{to achieve a}} business objective was first documented in 1907. The Deutscher Werkbund (German Work Federation) was established in Munich by twelve architects and twelve business firms as a state-sponsored effort to better compete with Great Britain and the United States by integrating traditional craft and industrial <b>mass-production</b> techniques. A German designer and architect, Peter Behrens, created the entire corporate identity (logotype, product design, publicity, etc.) of Allgemeine Elektrizitäts Gesellschaft (AEG), and {{is regarded as the}} first industrial designer in history. His work for AEG was the first large-scale demonstration of the viability and vitality of the Werkbund's initiatives and objectives and can be considered as first contribution to design management.|$|E
5|$|These {{designs for}} the uniform, however, did not prevail, as the {{complexity}} of the uniform proved to be difficult for <b>mass-production.</b> The simpler uniform {{turned out to be the}} regulations dictated by Judah Benjamin. He stated that the uniform should be that of: a gray jacket; a blue, gray, or brown pair of trousers; any slouch hat or cap-type of head cover; and any kind of foot-wear to be worn for Confederate service in mid-1861. His regulations, however, were overruled by the subsequent set of regulations of June 1861, stating the Franco-Austrian styled uniform to be issued and purchased to all corps and by all officers, respectively.|$|E
5|$|After {{the fall}} of France, the U.S. Army studied the reasons behind the {{effectiveness}} of the German campaign against the French and British forces. One aspect that was highlighted by this study was the use of self propelled artillery; however, by 1941, there was little available in the U.S. Army's arsenal {{that could be used in}} such a role. The Army had a number of M1897A5 guns, sufficient for the <b>mass-production</b> for such a weapon, and the M3 half-track was coming into production. After some debate, the Army decided to place M1897A5 guns on the M3 half-track chassis, which was designated the T12 GMC. The M1897A5 gun was originally adapted for the M3 chassis by placing it in a welded box riveted to the chassis behind the driver's compartment. It was accepted by the Army on 31 October 1941.|$|E
5|$|In {{the twentieth}} century the {{distinctive}} Scottish use of stone architecture declined as it was replaced by cheaper alternatives such as Portland cement, concrete, and <b>mass-production</b> brick. Stone would however be retained as a material for some housing stock in Edinburgh, Aberdeen and Dumfries, and would undergo revivals. In {{the twentieth century}} private architecture was increasingly client driven. James Robert Rhind (1854–1918), the son of David Rhind, was successful in the competition for new libraries to be constructed in Glasgow following Andrew Carnegie's gift of £100,000 to the city in 1901. His designs were selected for seven libraries, allowing him to demonstrate his individual interpretation of Edwardian Baroque architecture. Rhind's libraries were all built with locally quarried sandstone, which blended in with the existing tenement neighbourhoods. His landmark buildings were greatly enhanced by his liberal use of columns, domes and sculpted features. James Miller (1860–1947) is noted for his Scottish railway stations, such as his 1901–05 extensions to Glasgow Central railway station, and the spectacular Wemyss Bay railway station on the Firth of Clyde.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in the 1870s, {{entrepreneurs}} {{transformed the}} economy from small, craft-organized factories located {{inside the city}} limits to a large integrated industrial region stretching 50 miles across Allegheny County. The new industrial Pittsburgh was based on integrated mills, mass production, and modern management organization in steel and other industries. Many manufacturers searched for large sites with railroad and river accessibility. They purchased land, designed modern plants, and sometimes built towns for workers. Other firms bought into new communities that began as speculative industrial real estate ventures. Some owners removed their plants from the central city's labor unions to exert greater control over workers. The region's rugged topography and dispersed natural resources of coal and gas accentuated this dispersal. The rapid growth of steel, glass, railroad equipment, and coke industries resulted in both large <b>mass-production</b> plants and numerous smaller firms. As capital deepened and interdependence grew, participants multiplied, economies accrued, {{the division of labor}} increased, and localized production systems formed around these industries. Transportation, capital, labor markets, and the division of labor in production bound the scattered industrial plants and communities into a sprawling metropolitan district. By 1910 the Pittsburgh district was a complex urban landscape with a dominant central city, surrounded by proximate residential communities, mill towns, satellite cities, and hundreds of mining towns.|$|E
25|$|Various {{agencies}} and organizations use web template systems for <b>mass-production</b> of content when slower production alternatives prove unfeasible.|$|E
25|$|The {{bunkering}} {{of ships}} with oil instead of coal, <b>mass-production</b> of automobiles and increasing aviation, all {{increased demand for}} oil and thus oil transport.|$|E
25|$|Only {{the best}} {{electret}} microphones rival good DC-polarized units {{in terms of}} noise level and quality; electret microphones lend themselves to inexpensive <b>mass-production,</b> while inherently expensive non-electret condenser microphones are made to higher quality.|$|E
25|$|Two {{of these}} bodies were {{produced}} by Vignale, however {{it quickly became}} clear that the design would be too expensive for <b>mass-production</b> and so work began on completely redesigned the car in time for the Earls Court Motor Show in October.|$|E
25|$|Until the 19th century, shoemaking was a {{traditional}} handicraft, {{but by the}} century's end, the process had been almost completely mechanized, with production occurring in large factories. Despite the obvious economic gains of <b>mass-production,</b> the factory system produced shoes without the individual differentiation that the traditional shoemaker was able to provide.|$|E
25|$|The MC-1 {{chemical}} {{bomb was}} first brought into regular <b>mass-production</b> in 1959. A modified general purpose demolition bomb, the MC-1 {{was the first}} non-clustered chemical munition in the U.S. arsenal. The MC-1 {{was designed to be}} delivered via U.S. Air Force aircraft. The MC-1 was never used against enemy targets.|$|E
25|$|The Volksflugzeug (People’s Aircraft) was a grand Third Reich {{scheme for}} the <b>mass-production</b> {{of a small}} and simple {{airplane}} in the 1930s. It {{was one of the}} attempts of the Nazi regime to shape progressive consumer technologies {{for the benefit of the}} community and as a powerful propaganda tool for the state.|$|E
25|$|Blue phase mode LCDs {{have been}} shown as {{engineering}} samples early in 2008, {{but they are not}} in <b>mass-production.</b> The physics of blue phase mode LCDs suggest that very short switching times (~1 ms) can be achieved, so time sequential color control can possibly be realized and expensive color filters would be obsolete.|$|E
25|$|Compared to fossil {{and nuclear}} energy sources, very little {{research}} {{money has been}} invested {{in the development of}} solar cells, so there is considerable room for improvement. Nevertheless, experimental high efficiency solar cells already have efficiencies of over 40% in case of concentrating photovoltaic cells and efficiencies are rapidly rising while <b>mass-production</b> costs are rapidly falling.|$|E
25|$|Increased {{economic}} activity, {{combined with}} the presence of Luke Air Force Base and tremendous growth throughout the entire Valley—coinciding with the <b>mass-production</b> of air conditioning in the early 1950s—led to an increase in residential housing in Peoria. A postwar construction boom set the stage for Peoria to become a suburb of Phoenix, providing housing for the capital city as growth moved west.|$|E
25|$|The {{production}} announcement for the LFA {{marked the}} 20th {{anniversary of the}} launch of Lexus. Given {{the high cost of}} construction and development, analysts did not expect LFA sales to be profitable. However, the coupe was intended to serve as a testbed for new car technologies, including carbon fiber <b>mass-production,</b> and related performance vehicle development. At its debut, a circuit-ready model was also indicated for 2012 release.|$|E
25|$|Ethical vegetarianism {{has become}} popular in {{developed}} countries particularly because of the spread of factory farming, faster communications, and environmental consciousness. Some believe that the current mass demand for meat cannot be satisfied without a <b>mass-production</b> system that disregards the welfare of animals, while others believe that practices like well-managed free-ranging and consumption of game, particularly from species whose natural predators have been significantly eliminated, could substantially alleviate the demand for mass-produced meat.|$|E
25|$|During {{the course}} of the Second World War, the No. 4 rifle was further {{simplified}} for <b>mass-production</b> with the creation of the No. 4 Mk I* in 1942, with the bolt release catch replaced by a simpler notch on the bolt track of the rifle's receiver. It was produced only in North America, by Long Branch Arsenal in Canada and Savage-Stevens Firearms in the USA. The No.4 Mk I rifle was primarily produced for the United Kingdom.|$|E
25|$|Similar exigencies at {{the time}} of the Crimean War stimulated a renewed {{interest}} in methods of mechanization and <b>mass-production,</b> which proved longer lasting. A shoemaker in Leicester, Tomas Crick, patented the design for a riveting machine in 1853. His machine used an iron plate to push iron rivets into the sole. The process greatly increased the speed and efficiency of production. He also introduced the use of steam-powered rolling-machines for hardening leather and cutting-machines, in the mid-1850s.|$|E
25|$|In early 1959, Noyce solved another {{important}} problem, {{the problem of}} interconnections that hindered <b>mass-production</b> of ICs. According to the colleagues from the traitorous eight his idea was self-evident: of course, the passivating oxide layer forms a natural barrier between the chip and the metallization layer. According to Turner Hasty, who worked with Kilby and Noyce, Noyce planned to make the microelectronic patents of Fairchild accessible {{to a wide range}} of companies, similar to Bell Labs which in 1951–1952 released their transistor technologies.|$|E
25|$|Several plug-in {{electric}} vehicle fire incidents {{have taken place}} since the introduction of <b>mass-production</b> plug-in {{electric vehicle}}s in 2010. Most {{of them have been}} thermal runaway incidents related to the lithium-ion batteries and have involved the Zotye M300 EV, Chevrolet Volt, Fisker Karma, Dodge Ram 1500 Plug-in Hybrid, Toyota Prius Plug-in Hybrid, Mitsubishi i-MiEV and Outlander P-HEV. Most hybrid electric vehicles available in the market today use nickel-metal hydride batteries which do not pose the same risk of thermal runaway as lithium-ion batteries.|$|E
25|$|While {{standards}} {{that put the}} emphasis on operational reliability satisfy most users and the industry, certain groups of dedicated hobby modellers who were dissatisfied with the scale inaccuracies {{in the name of}} reliability have developed alternative scale standards where prototype proportions are maintained to the extent possible. These alternative standards are called finescale standards. Finescale standards are very much restricted to discerning hobbyists since, by definition, finescale model railways are generally less reliable and more expensive to manufacture, which makes them unsuitable for <b>mass-production</b> products.|$|E
25|$|Germany {{is known}} to have pursued entomological warfare {{programs}} during World War II. The nation pursued the <b>mass-production,</b> and dispersion, of the Colorado potato beetle (Lepinotarsa decemlineata), aimed at the enemy's food sources. The beetle was first found in Germany in 1914, as an invasive species from North America. There are no records that indicate the beetle was ever employed as a weapon by Germany, or any other nation during the war. Regardless, the Germans had developed plans to drop the beetles on English crops.|$|E
25|$|For {{electrical}} and electronics work, solder wire {{is available in}} a range of thicknesses for hand-soldering, and with cores containing flux. It is also available as a paste or as a preformed foil shaped to match the workpiece, more suitable for mechanized <b>mass-production.</b> Alloys of lead and tin were commonly used in the past and are still available; they are particularly convenient for hand-soldering. Lead-free solders have been increasing in use due to regulatory requirements plus the health and environmental benefits of avoiding lead-based electronic components. They are almost exclusively used today in consumer electronics.|$|E
25|$|In horticulture, {{carnivorous}} {{plants are}} considered a curiosity or a rarity, but are becoming more common in cultivation {{with the advent of}} <b>mass-production</b> tissue-culture propagation techniques. Venus flytraps are still the most commonly grown, usually available at garden centers and hardware stores, sometimes offered alongside other easy to grow varieties. Nurseries that specialize in growing carnivorous plants exclusively also exist, more uncommon or demanding varieties of carnivorous plants can be obtained from specialist nurseries. California Carnivores is a notable example of such a nursery that specializes in the cultivation of carnivorous plants. It is owned and operated by horticulturalist Peter D'Amato.|$|E
25|$|Bookbinding is {{an artistic}} craft of great antiquity, {{and at the}} same time, a highly {{mechanized}} industry. The division between craft and industry is not so wide as might at first be imagined. It is interesting to observe that the main problems faced by the <b>mass-production</b> bookbinder are the same as those that confronted the medieval craftsman or the modern hand binder. The first problem is still how to hold together the pages of a book; secondly is how to cover and protect the gathering of pages once they are held together; and thirdly, how to label and decorate the protective cover.|$|E
25|$|The National Labor Relations Act of 1935, {{also known}} as the Wagner Act, finally {{guaranteed}} workers the rights to collective bargaining through unions of their own choice. The Act also established the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) to facilitate wage agreements and to suppress the repeated labor disturbances. The Wagner Act did not compel employers to reach agreement with their employees, but it opened possibilities for American labor. The result was a tremendous growth of membership in the labor unions, especially in the <b>mass-production</b> sector, composing the American Federation of Labor. Labor thus became a major component of the New Deal political coalition.|$|E
25|$|Semiconductor (or solid state) QCA {{implementations}} {{could potentially}} be used to implement QCA devices with the same highly advanced semiconductor fabrication processes used to implement CMOS devices. Cell polarization is encoded as charge position, and quantum-dot interactions rely on electrostatic coupling. However, current semiconductor processes have not yet {{reached a point where}} mass production of devices with such small features (~20 nanometers) is possible. Serial lithographic methods, however, make QCA solid state implementation achievable, but not necessarily practical. Serial lithography is slow, expensive and unsuitable for <b>mass-production</b> of solid-state QCA devices. Today, most QCA prototyping experiments are done using this implementation technology.|$|E
25|$|Advantages of {{electric}} heating methods over other forms include precision control of temperature {{and distribution of}} heat energy, combustion not used to develop heat, {{and the ability to}} attain temperatures not readily achievable with chemical combustion. Electric heat can be accurately applied at the precise point needed in a process, at high concentration of power per unit area or volume. Electric heating devices can be built in any required size and can be located anywhere within a plant. Electric heating processes are generally clean, quiet, and do not emit much byproduct heat to the surroundings. Electrical heating equipment has a high speed of response, lending it to rapid-cycling <b>mass-production</b> equipment.|$|E
25|$|Vista V50 is {{significant}} because it's {{one of the first}} fruits of Toyota's company-wide platform renewal efforts known as the MC. Studies for new front-wheel drive (FWD) platform and packaging layout began in 1993 and appeared on market in February 1997 in the Toyota Prius, but the Vista is the first <b>mass-production,</b> FWD Toyota with a new platform. Toyota claims this is the first true redesign and re-think of its FWD platforms since the 1982 Camry/Vista. With this platform, Toyota trades rear MacPherson Struts for a torsion beam axle setup. A double-wishbone setup is available for all-wheel drive. Toyota also flipped the engine orientation so that the intake manifold is in front, improving space efficiency.|$|E
25|$|Between 1933 and 1934 {{not only}} Haworth and Edmund Hirst had {{synthesized}} vitamin C, but also, independently, Tadeus Reichstein succeeded in synthesizing the vitamin in bulk, {{making it the}} first vitamin to be artificially produced. The latter process made possible the cheap <b>mass-production</b> of semi-synthetic vitamin C, which was quickly marketed. Only Haworth was awarded the 1937 Nobel Prize in Chemistry in part for this work, but the Reichstein process, a combined chemical and bacterial fermentation sequence still used today to produce vitamin C, retained Reichstein's name. In 1934 Hoffmann–La Roche, which bought the Reichstein process patent, became the first pharmaceutical company to mass-produce and market synthetic vitamin C, under the brand name of Redoxon.|$|E
