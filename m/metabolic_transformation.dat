However, other mechanisms mediating <b>metabolic</b> <b>transformation</b> remain undefined. Here we report that carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 C (CPT 1 C), a brain-specific metabolic enzyme, may participate in <b>metabolic</b> <b>transformation.</b> CPT 1 C expression correlates inversely with mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway activation, contributes to rapamycin resistance in murine primary tumors, and is frequently up-regulated in human lung tumors. Tumor cells constitutively expressing CPT 1 C show increased fatty acid (FA) oxidation, ATP production, and resistance to glucose deprivation or hypoxia. Conversely, cancer cells lacking CPT 1 C produce less ATP and are more sensitive to metabolic stress. CPT 1 C depletion via siRNA suppresses xenograft tumor growth and metformin responsiveness in vivo. CPT 1 C can be induced by hypoxia or glucose deprivation and is regulated by AMPKα. Cpt 1 c-deficient murine embryonic stem (ES) cells show sensitivity to hypoxia and glucose deprivation and altered FA homeostasis.

In combination with measured CM contents of the sediment, the model gave good fits for the biota that are known not to metabolize PAHs (macrophytes, periphyton, floating algal biomass). The same model was applied to invertebrates and fish but now with optimization of their <b>metabolic</b> <b>transformation</b> rates (km). For fish, these rates correlated empirically with log KOW: Log km = - 0. 8 log KOW + 4. 5 (r 2 adj = 0. 73). For invertebrates, log km did not correlate with logKOW. Sensitivity analysis revealed that the model output is highly sensitive to sediment CM content and sorption parameters, moderately sensitive to <b>metabolic</b> <b>transformation</b> rates, and slightly sensitive to lipid fraction of the organism and diet-related parameters.

40|$|AbstractBackground: The {{structural}} {{complexity of}} taxol dictates continued reliance on biological production methods, {{which may be}} improved by a detailed understanding of taxol biosynthesis, especially the rate-limiting steps. The biosynthesis of taxol involves the cyclization of the common isoprenoid intermediate geranylgeranyl diphosphate to taxa- 4 (5), 11 (12) -diene followed by extensive, largely oxidative, modification of this diterpene olefin. We set out to define the first oxygenation step in taxol biosynthesis. Results: Microsomal enzymes from Taxus stem and cultured cells were used to define the first hydroxylation of taxadiene. We confirmed {{the structure of the}} reaction product (taxa- 4 (20), 11 (12) -dien- 5 α-ol) by synthesizing this compound. The responsible biological catalyst was characterized as a cytochrome P 450 (heme thiolate protein). In vivo studies confirmed that taxadienol is a biosynthetic intermediate and indicated that the hydroxylation step that produces this product is slow relative to subsequent <b>metabolic</b> <b>transformations.</b> Conclusions: The structure of the first oxygenated intermediate on the taxol pathway establishes that the hydroxylation reaction proceeds with an unusual double bond migration that limits the mechanistic possibilities for subsequent elaboration of the oxetane moiety of taxol. The reaction is catalyzed by a cytochrome P 450, suggesting that the seven remaining oxygenation steps in taxol biosynthesis may involve similar catalysts. Because the first oxygenation step is slow relative to subsequent <b>metabolic</b> <b>transformations,</b> {{it may be possible to}} speed taxol biosynthesis by isolating and manipulating the gene for the taxadiene- 5 -hydroxylase that catalyzes this reaction...|$|R

The hypotheses assessed are: do 1) lowered intracellular ATP concentration or 2) reduction of the muscular glycogen stores act as triggers of <b>metabolic</b> <b>transformation?</b> We find that 3  days of decreased cytosolic ATP content have no impact on the investigated metabolic markers, whereas incubation of the cells with little or no glucose leads to decreases in glycogen in conjunction with decreases in glyceraldehyde- 3 -phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) promoter activity, GAPDH mRNA and specific GAPDH enzyme activity (indicators of the anaerobic glycolytic pathway), and furthermore to increases in mitochondrial acetoacetyl-CoA thiolase (MAT, also known as ACAT) promoter activity, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator 1 α (PGC- 1 α) expression and citrate synthase (CS) specific enzyme activity (all indicators of oxidative metabolic pathways). The AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activity under these conditions is reduced compared to controls. In experiments with two inhibitors of glycogen degradation we show that the observed <b>metabolic</b> <b>transformation</b> caused by low glucose takes place even if intracellular glycogen content is high. These findings for the first time provide evidence that metabolic adaptation of skeletal muscle cells from rabbit in primary culture can be induced not only by elevation of intracellular calcium concentration or by a rise of AMPK activity, but also by reduction of glucose supply.

40|$|Abstract Background In {{prostate}} cancer, normal citrate-producing glandular secretory {{epithelial cells}} undergo a <b>metabolic</b> <b>transformation</b> to malignant citrate-oxidizing cells. m-Aconitase {{is the critical}} step involved in this altered citrate metabolism that is essential to prostate malignancy. The limiting m-aconitase activity in prostate epithelial cells could {{be the result of}} a decreased level of m-aconitase enzyme and/or the inhibition of existing m-aconitase. Earlier studies identified zinc as an inhibitor of m-aconitase activity in prostate cells; and that the depletion of zinc in malignant cells {{is an important factor in}} this <b>metabolic</b> <b>transformation.</b> However, a possibility remains that an altered expression and level of m-aconitase enzyme might also be involved in this <b>metabolic</b> <b>transformation.</b> To address this issue, the in situ level of m-aconitase enzyme was determined by immunohistochemical analysis of prostate cancer tissue sections and malignant prostate cell lines. Results The immunocytochemical procedure successfully identified the presence of m-aconitase localized in the mitochondrial compartment in PC- 3, LNCaP, and DU- 145 malignant prostate cell lines. The examination of prostate tissue sections from prostate cancer subjects demonstrated that m-aconitase enzyme is present in the glandular epithelium of normal glands, hyperplastic glands, adenocrcinomatous glands, and prostatic intraepithelial neoplastic foci. Quantitative analysis of the relative level of m-aconitase in the glandular epithelium of citrate-producing adenomatous glands versus the citrate-oxidizing adenocarcinomatous glands revealed no significant difference in m-aconitase enzyme levels. This is in contrast to the down-regulation of ZIP 1 zinc transporter in the malignant glands versus hyperplastic glands that exists in the same tissue samples. Conclusion The results demonstrate the existence of m-aconitase enzyme in the citrate-producing glandular epithelial cells; so that deficient m-aconitase enzyme is not associated with the limiting m-aconitase activity that prevents citrate oxidation in these cells. The level of m-aconitase is maintained in the malignant cells; so that an altered enzyme level is not associated with the increased m-aconitase activity. Consequently, the elevated zinc level that inhibits m-aconitase enzyme is responsible for the impaired citrate oxidation in normal and hyperplastic prostate glandular epithelial cells. Moreover, the down-regulation of ZIP 1 zinc transporter and corresponding depletion of zinc results in the increase in the activity of the existing m-aconitase activity in the malignant prostate cells. The studies now define the mechanism for the <b>metabolic</b> <b>transformation</b> that characterizes the essential transition of normal citrate-producing epithelial cells to malignant citrate-oxidizing cells. </p...|$|E

This is of great benefit to the scientific doping community, because steroids are prohibited by WADA and are still amongst the most frequently detected doping substances.

But this experimental approach raises a lot of ethical concerns to use healthy human volunteers. As an alternative, in vitro cell cultures are used to have an indication on the steroid metabolism. However, most primary cell cultures have a very limited lifespan. To circumvent the above stated problems, an in vivo chimeric mouse model was presented.
