30|$|In {{order to}} control the quality of <b>spline</b> <b>shaft</b> in rolling process, an {{efficient}} measurement method for rolling performance evaluation is essential. Here, a newly developed on-machine non-contact measurement prototype based on laser displacement sensor and rotary encoder is proposed. The prototype is intended for the automated evaluation of the <b>spline</b> <b>shaft</b> rolling performance by measuring the dimensional change of tooth root, which is correlated with the surface residual stress and micro-hardness. Laser displacement sensor and rotary encoder are used to record the polar radius and polar angle of each point on measuring section. Data are displayed in a polar coordinate system and fitted in a gear. Through multipoint curvature method, the roots of <b>spline</b> <b>shaft</b> are recognized automatically. Then, the dimensional change can be calculated by fitting the radius of the tooth root circle before and after rolling. Systematic error covering offset error is also analyzed and calibrated. At last, measurement test {{results show that the}} system has advantages of simple structure, high measurement precision (radius error <[*] 0.6  μm), high measurement efficiency (measuring time <[*] 2  s) and automatic control ability, providing a new opportunity for the efficient evaluation of various <b>spline</b> <b>shafts</b> in high-precision mechanical processing.|$|R

The second set of models consists of a solid cylindrical <b>shaft</b> with incomplete <b>spline</b> teeth. The incomplete regions of the spline teeth are modeled in three radii (R). Bending, torsion, and combined loads are applied to each model, including several combinations of bending and torsion between pure bending and pure torsion.

For the spline with position requirements, that is: one of the spline tooth is located at an angle of the <b>spline</b> <b>shaft</b> cross section, cold rolling processing can't guarantee the spline tooth position. The paper analyzes the defects existed in the rolling and processing of this kind of spline. Through transforming a hydraulic press and design special frock clamp to ensure the spline tooth position angle, the small modulus involute spline processing with position requirements is realized in the way of punch press processing...|$|R

30|$|The {{dimensional}} {{change of the}} tooth root is about 20  μm after rolling. Thus, the measurement precision of the conventional mechanical measuring instrument is not enough and it is time-consuming due {{to the complexity of}} the <b>spline</b> <b>shaft.</b> In order to solve such problems, it is necessary to develop a new measuring system with high efficiency and high precision. The laser triangulation displacement sensor (LDS) is a common-used tool in high precision and short-distance measuring, which can measure the displacement change of an object without any contact. It is mainly used in automatically measuring the geometrical parameter such as thickness, distance, diameter, etc [7 – 10]. Over a period of time there were several novel measuring systems by combining it with other devices, such as identification of location error of rotary axes for five-axes machine tools [11], on machine measurement of RFQS [12], automated inner dimensional measurement system for long-stepped pipes [13] and piston secondary motion measurement [14]. For <b>spline</b> <b>shaft</b> measuring system, a rotary encoder is needed to record the rotation angle. Together with the radius recorded by the laser displacement sensor, the section contour of the <b>spline</b> <b>shaft</b> is obtained by plotting each point of the measuring section in a polar coordinate system.|$|R
30|$|Through {{multipoint}} curvature method (MCM) {{and joint}} least square fitting method, {{the roots of}} the <b>spline</b> <b>shaft</b> were recognized automatically.

This device transmits rotary force in one direction only and disengages to permit the driven part to free wheel when the input member is stopped and precludes the backdriving of rotary force from output member to input member. The coupling includes an input member having a <b>splined</b> <b>shaft,</b> a coupling member connected to the <b>splined</b> <b>shaft,</b> and a coaxial output member. The coupling member and the output member having complementary sets of axially facing clutch teeth. Guides {{in the form of}} helical grooves on the coupling member and spring loaded followers acting with the guides affect the engagement and disengagement of the clutch teeth by moving the coupling member toward and away from output member, the followers and guides themselves disengaging to permit free wheeling of output member when input member is stopped...|$|R
30|$|<b>Spline</b> <b>shaft</b> is an {{important}} part of a machine to transmit power or bear torque. Its section contour is like a gear. It suffers from great loads and alternating stress during the runtime. The tooth root of the <b>spline</b> <b>shaft</b> has a risk of fracture due to fatigue stress [1 – 4]. Thus, it is essential to conduct a surface hardening process such as rolling after machining. In order to control the quality of product, a rolling performance evaluation becomes essential. The commonly used evaluation parameters of surface integrity involve the surface roughness, the surface residual stress and the micro-hardness. However, measurement of surface roughness or through-thickness residual stresses in difficult locations or complex geometries is not easy. Many measurement techniques are destructive, such as the centre-hole drilling method, the ring core method and the block removal method. There are non-destructive techniques (e.g., X-ray and neutron diffraction, optical, magnetic or ultrasonic methods) [5], but they often require the off-machine measuring. Note that for the rolling process, it is an efficient alternative to conventional cutting processes to manufacture <b>spline</b> <b>shaft</b> as it possesses several advantages i.e. shorter process times, no material loss and no chip disposal, high surface quality [6]. The residual stress is only induced by the residual strain and the residual strain appears as the dimensional change in the macroscopic view. Therefore, it is probably feasible to use the dimensional change of tooth root as an alternative evaluation parameter.|$|R

40|$|In many {{rotating}} machinery applications, such as helicopters, the splines of an externally-splined steel shaft {{that emerges from}} the gearbox engage with the reverse geometry of an internally <b>splined</b> driven <b>shaft</b> for the delivery of power. The splined section of the shaft is a critical and non-redundant element which is prone to cracking due to complex loading conditions. Thus, early detection of flaws is required to prevent catastrophic failures. The acoustic emission (AE) method is a direct way of detecting such active flaws, but its application to detect flaws in a <b>splined</b> <b>shaft</b> in a gearbox is difficult due to the interference of background noise and uncertainty {{about the effects of}} the wave propagation path on the received AE signature. Here, to model how AE may detect fault propagation in a hollow cylindrical <b>splined</b> <b>shaft,</b> the <b>splined</b> section is essentially unrolled into a metal plate of the same thickness as the cylinder wall. Spline ridges are cut into this plate, a through-notch is cut perpendicular to the spline to model fatigue crack initiation, and tensile cyclic loading is applied parallel to the spline to propagate the crack. In this paper, the new piezoelectric sensor array is introduced with the purpose of placing them within the gearbox to minimize the wave propagation path. The fatigue crack growth of a notched and flattened gearbox spline component is monitored using a new piezoelectric sensor array and conventional sensors in a laboratory environment with the purpose of developing source models and testing the new sensor performance. The AE data is continuously collected together with strain gauges strategically positioned on the structure. A significant amount of continuous emission due to the plastic deformation accompanied with the crack growth is observed. The frequency spectra of continuous emissions and burst emissions are compared to understand the differences of plastic deformation and sudden crack jump. The correlation of the cumulative AE events at the notch tip and the strain data is used to predict crack growth. The performance of the new sensor array is compared with the conventional AE sensors in terms of signal to noise ratio and the ability to detect fatigue cracking...|$|R
