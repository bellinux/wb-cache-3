40|$|International audienceA bitext is a <b>merged</b> <b>document</b> {{composed}} of two versions of a given text, usually in two different languages. An aligned bitext is produced by an alignment tool or aligner, that automatically aligns or matches the {{versions of the same}} text, generally sentence by sentence. A multilingual aligned corpus or collection of aligned bitexts, when consulted with a search tool, can be extremely useful for translation, language teaching and the investigation of literary text. This is all the more true for a pair of languages such as Korean and French, for which few people are bilingual, and many literary translations involve pairs of translators. For such language pairs, retrieving solutions of previously resolved translation problems is an invaluable aid. In addition, multilingual corpora are in the core of some research in natural language processing (NLP), both in theoretical fields, such as contrastive linguistic and lexicography, and in applicative fields, such as translation, term extraction, or translation memories production. The current methods of construction and exploitation of multilingual aligned corpora are essentially based on statistical models of text. In this article, we propose an enhancement of these methods with the use of lexical and grammatical resources. The open-source Unitex system is the main corpus processor that systematically makes use of lexicons and grammars for text exploration. This system can process one language at a time. We outline a project of extension of Unitex to the processing of bitexts...|$|E

30|$|Related to {{the last}} {{category}} “Others” in Fig.  1, Hill (2011) developed several tools for automated grading in terms of Microsoft Office software, particularly an automated assessment system for Microsoft Office Excel (Microsoft Excel Automated Grader—MEAGER) and an automated assessment system for Microsoft Office Access (Microsoft Access Database Automated Grading System—MADBAGS) (Hill 2004). Recently, his focus is on Microsoft Office Word and Microsoft Office PowerPoint programs. These grading systems exploit the Microsoft Word “Compare and Combine” function. This latter feature of Microsoft Office Word allows systems to <b>merge</b> <b>documents</b> to identify differences between them. Thus, the document of the correct version of the assignment given by the instructor is <b>merged</b> with the <b>document</b> produced by the student, and the differences are then recorded in a Microsoft Office Access table. The Word Grader counts obtained errors and embeds a grade report in the marked-up document. Even though Hill’s developments are powerful, they are limited {{by the use of}} Microsoft Office programs only, and as the author stated, the ability to assess new skills (e.g., manipulating text boxes) that are not compared by the Microsoft Word “Compare and Combine” function will be more difficult.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: There {{are many}} methods having {{different}} approaches for assessing similarity and relatedness {{and they are}} used in many application areas, including web service discovery, invocation and composition, word sense disambigua-tion, information retrieval, ontology alignment and <b>merging,</b> <b>document</b> clustering, and short answer grading. These methods can be categorized as path-based, information content-based, feature-based, geometric model-based, and hybrid approaches. These approaches use resources such as concept hierarchy, conceptual graph, and corpus for computing sim-ilarity and relatedness. With {{the rise of the}} semantic web, ontologies have attracted the attention of several researchers. Ontologies represented in the Web Ontology Language (OWL) are also valuable resources for similarity and relatedness measurement. The method proposed in this paper interprets some OWL constructs to assess semantic relatedness. The motivation behind this is to benefit from the rich expressive power of OWL to obtain better semantic relatedness mea-surement results. The success of the method has been validated against human judgments. The correlation between human judgments and automatically computed semantic relatedness values was calculated as 0. 685 and was significant at the 0. 01 level...|$|R

In this paper we study the feasibility of meta search results clustering, which has unique features compared to the general meta clustering problem. After showing {{that the combination of}} multiple search results clusterings is empirically justified, we cast meta clustering as an optimization problem of an objective function measuring the probabilistic concordance between the clustering combination and the single clusterings. We then show, using an easily computable upper bound on such a function, that a simple stochastic optimization algorithm delivers reasonable approximations of the optimal value very efficiently, and we also provide a method for labeling the generated clusters with the most agreed upon cluster labels. Optimal meta clustering with meta labeling is applied to three descriptioncentric, state-of-the-art search results clustering algorithms. The performance improvement is demonstrated through a range of evaluation techniques (i. e., internal, classificationoriented, and information retrieval-oriented), using suitable test collections of search results with document-level relevance judgments per subtopic...|$|R

40|$|It is {{becoming}} normal that a document should serve several purposes.

40|$|The {{continued}} growth of very large data environments such as Westlaw and Dialog, {{in addition to}} the World Wide Web, increases the importance of effective and efficient database selection and searching. Current research focuses largely on completely autonomous and automatic selection, searching, and results merging in distributed environments.

It also <b>merges</b> <b>documents,</b> often from disparate data sources that users may have discarded before their source selection task proceeded (diluted precision). We examine the impact that early user interaction can have on the process of database selection. After analyzing thousands of real user queries, we show that precision can be significantly increased when queries are categorized by the users themselves, then handled effectively by the system. Such query categorization strategies may eliminate limitations of fully automated query processing approaches. Our system harnesses the WIN search engine, a sibling to INQUERY, run against one or more authority sources when search is required.

40|$|Result merging is an {{important}} research problem in federated search for <b>merging</b> <b>documents</b> retrieved from multiple ranked lists of selected information sources into a single list. The state-of-the-art result merging algorithms such as Semi-Supervised Learning (SSL) and Sample-Agglomerate Fitting Estimate (SAFE) try to map document scores retrieved from different sources to comparable scores according to a single centralized retrieval algorithm for ranking those documents. Both SSL and SAFE arbitrarily select a single centralized retrieval algorithm for generating comparable document scores, which is problematic in a heterogeneous federated search environment, since a single centralized algorithm is often suboptimal for different information sources. Based on this observation, this paper proposes a novel approach for result merging by utilizing multiple centralized retrieval algorithms. One simple approach is to learn a set of combination weights for multiple centralized retrieval algorithms (e. g., logistic regression) to compute comparable document scores. The paper shows that this simple approach generates suboptimal results as it is not flexible {{enough to deal with}} heterogeneous information sources. A mixture probabilistic model is thus proposed to learn more appropriate combination weights with respect to different types of information sources with some training data.
