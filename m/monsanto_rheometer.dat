40|$|The dual {{functionality}} of epoxide and unsaturated {{sites in}} {{epoxidized natural rubber}} (ENR) permits different types of cross-linking reactions. Besides the normal vulcanization via double bonds, alternative cross-linking reactions could take place via ring opening of epoxide groups by dicarboxylic acids and diamines. We investigated the cross-linking reactions of silica-filled ENR 50 with fumaric acid. The cross-linking reactions at 160 °C were assessed using a <b>Monsanto</b> <b>rheometer.</b> Supporting evidence of the reactions was provided by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), solvent swelling, and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) analysis. FT-IR showed new absorbance peaks of hydroxyl and ester groups {{in agreement with the}} structures expected to form during the reactions between ENR 50 and fumaric acid. The increase in crosslinks led to a lower percentage of solvent swelling, higher glass transition temperature, and higher torque. Incorporation of silica filler has further increased the torque due to the stiffening effect of the filler. The amorphous silica used in the current work was prepared from rice husk. Leaching of the rice husk with dilute sulfuric acid before the combustion at 600 °C for 2 h led to the production of high-purity amorphous silica (. 99 % SiO 2) ...|$|E
40|$|In this study, Epoxidized Natural Rubber (ENR- 25) {{formulations}} are compounded {{and tested}} {{to obtain a}} stable expandable rubber foam {{as well as to}} determine the foam cell physical morphology and its mechanical properties. The experiment was carried out by employing different ratio of rubber blend between ENR- 25 and natural rubber (SMR-L), different amount of blowing agent which is Sodium Bicarbonate and different ratio of accelerator between Tetramethylthiuram-disulfenamide (TMTD) and N-cyclohexyl- 2 -benzotiazolsulfenamide (CBS). Cure characteristics of the compounded rubber were determined using <b>Monsanto</b> <b>Rheometer</b> and the expandable rubber foam is produced using compression moulding technique with utilization of heat transfer process. The generated foam cell morphology is analyzed using image analyzer and SEM while the mechanical properties of the foam are examined by using Instron machine to determine its compression stress. On the other hand, swelling test using the Flory-Rhener equation is also done to support the substitute results. The data shows that at the ratio of 60 phr ENR- 25 and 40 phr SMR-L is able to deliver stable rubber foam. Furthermore, increasing the amounts of blowing agent evidently increased the foam cell size, inducing smaller cell in between the foam cell wall, decreasing the value of compression stress and compression set. It was also observed that increasing the ratio of CBS in the compounded rubber will increase the cell size, creating thicker foam cell wall, increasing the value of compression stress and compression set...|$|E
40|$|Powdered {{vulcanized}} rubber waste generated {{in a factory}} was examined as a compounding additive in natural rubber compounds and in blends of natural rubber and styrene-butadiene rubber. The cure characteristics were evaluat-ed with the <b>Monsanto</b> Oscillating Disc <b>Rheometer</b> while tensile sheets were prepared and stress-strain measurements in simple extension were used to characterize the mechanical properties of the vulcanized elastomers. In all the vulcanizates examined, the incorporation of rubber waste resulted in a slight deterioration of properties. The deterioration of properties is attributed tQ the poor interfacial bonding between the rubber waste and the virgin matrix elastomer. Also, {{it was found that}} at low volume loading, the vulcanized waste has no adverse effect on vulcanizate properties.

40|$|Abstract. Organoclay filler {{was added}} to natural rubber and cured by {{conventional}} vulcanization system. The filler loading was varied from 0 – 10 phr. The compounds were characterized in respect of their curing characteristics and mechanical properties. The cure characteristics: cure time and torque of the rubber compounds were studied by using the <b>Monsanto</b> MDR 2000 <b>rheometer.</b> The mechanical properties were investigated. The tensile strength, elongation at break and tear properties were improved at 2 phr organoclay. Further increase in organoclay loading decreases these properties. Modulus at 100 % (M 100) and modulus at 300 % (M 300) increased continuously with filler loading from 0 – 10 phr. Scanning electron microscopy was used to study the microstructure of the fracture surfaces...|$|R
30|$|The nanocomposites were {{synthesized}} {{by using}} a solution-mixing technique. EVA (5 g per batch) was dissolved in 50 -mL of THF to make 10 % solution of the rubber using a mechanical stirrer. 0.05 g of DCP as the curing agent and 0.05 g of TAC as the co-agent {{were added to the}} rubber solution. The solution was thoroughly stirred using a mechanical stirrer. CNFs dispersed in THF were first sonicated for 15 min and subsequently added to the rubber solution while stirring at room temperature (27 °C). The final solution was cast over Teflon trays and kept for air drying followed by vacuum drying at 50 °C till there was practically no weight variation. The dried films were molded in a hot press at a pressure of 5 MPa at 150 °C for an optimum cure time of 25 min, determined from a <b>Monsanto</b> oscillating disc <b>rheometer</b> (100 S).|$|R
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. As an aid to understanding the mechanics of mixing in an internal mixer laboratory scale trials {{have been carried out}} using a mixer having a transparent plastics chamber. The use of a transparent rubber and coloured 'markers' then permitted direct viewing of the characteristic flow patterns deriving from the use of three fill factors. These mixing trials have indicated the rheological properties which must be measured in order to predict the mixing behaviour of a rubber. Also considerable information is contained in the visualisations which will aid further work into control and instrumentation strategies and into fundamental design/mathematical modelling studies. A laboratory Banbury mixer and Brabender Plastograph are used to prepare the rubber compounds which are then characterised for the dispersion of compounding ingredients. For carbon black dispersion studies several techniques are employed. Capillary rheometry is used to study their stress-strain rate relationships and to obtain die swell, shear and tensile properties. Creep and elongational tests are also carried out on uncured mixes. In addition measurements on Mooney viscometer, <b>Monsanto</b> <b>rheometer</b> and analysis of bound rubber are made. These tests for filler dispersion are supported by microscopic examination of microtomed sections. Work is also geared to examine properties that are not only sensitive to changes in levels of carbon black dispersion but also that which are readily measured and can be used in industry. Measurements of mechanical phase angle and electrical resistivity are considered. Dispersion of non-black compounding ingredients is studied by X-ray microradiographic technique and the analysis of vulcanisate properties. To relate the performance of the Plastograph and Banbury mix the concept of mixing energy per unit volume of material is used...|$|E
40|$|Antioxidants {{containing}} polymerisable vinyl {{groups have}} been successfully bound to natural rubber {{in the presence of}} suitable free radical generators. Reaction parameters such as the mode of initiation, initiator system, reaction time, pH of the reaction medium, swelling time have been investigated in natural rubber latex. Of the free radical generating systems examined the redox system consisted of tertiary butyl hydroperoxide and tetra ethylene pentamine (TBHP/TEP) appeared to be most effective in natural rubber latex. Infra-red spectroscopy has been used to estimate the concentration of the bound anlioxidants and ageing behaviour was assessed by oxygen absorption and continuous stress relaxation. The curing characteristics of the grafted rubber samples were studied in detai 1 using the <b>Monsanto</b> <b>rheometer.</b> It was found that antioxidants which do not contain vinyl groups also react under the same conditions with natural rubber latex. Some of these appeared to be marginally more effective than the corresponding vinyl antioxidants. It was observed {{that in the case of}} the vinyl antioxidants only a part of the added antioxidant grafted into the rubber and the rest remained unchanged or was oxidised to coloured products. The by-products formed during the process of grafting were identified and analysed. A masterbatch technique has been developed to produce concentrates of bound antioxidants in rubber latex and these have been used as additives to untreated latex to obtain grafted rubber latices with a known level of oxidative stability. It was found that irrespective of the presence or absence of vinyl group in the antioxidants phenols containing one tertiary butyl and one methyl group in ortho position were most effective. Followed by phenols with two tertiary butyl groups. This is the order of activity previously observed for rubber antioxidants. The effectiveness of these antioxidant structures appears to be similar when present in a rubber bound form to that of Lhe free antioxidant...|$|E

Neste trabalho, um novo tipo de termoplástico vulcanizado foi obtido por vulcanização dinâmica in situ da blenda PVC/NBR, utilizando-se um sistema de cura a base de enxofre (S) e combinação dos aceleradores 2, 2 -ditiomercaptobenzotiazol (MBTS) e dissulfeto de tetrametiltiuram (TMTD). As blendas PVC/NBR (90 / 10, 80 / 20 e 70 / 30 % em massa) foram processadas em um reômetro de torque Haake (Rheomix 600) a 160 °C com rotação de 60 rpm. As blendas obtidas por processamento reativo foram caracterizadas por calorimetria diferencial de varredura (DSC) para determinação do grau de cura.

Dynamic {{vulcanization}} is {{a process}} of vulcanization of an elastomer during melt mixing with a thermoplastic wich results in material called thermoplastic vulcanizates or TPVs. In this study, a new kind of TPV was obtained by in situ dynamic curing of poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC) /nitrile rubber (NBR) blends. The crosslinking of PVC/NBR blends was accomplished using sulphur (S) /tetramethylthiuram disulphide (TMTD) and mercaptobenzthiazyl disulphide (MBTS) curative system during the reactive processing. The blends of PVC/NBR at the ratio of 90 / 10; 80 / 20 and 70 / 30 wt. (%) were melt mixed using a Haake Rheomix 600 at 160 °C and rotor speed of 60 rpm. The curing behavior of NBR was investigated by a <b>Monsanto</b> <b>Rheometer</b> and the degree of cure was calculated using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) for different mixing times.

40|$|The {{effect of}} filler loading and bonding agent on the dynamic {{properties}} and swelling behaviour of bamboo fibre filled natural rubber composites were carried out. Bamboo fibre {{was used as}} a filler and the loading range was from 0 to 50 phr. Dynamic properties were determined using a <b>Monsanto</b> moving die <b>rheometer</b> (MOR 2000) at 150 'C. Results show that the maximum elastic torque (S-raw) and minimum elastic torque (S 'ML) increase with increasing filler loading and the addition of bonding agent. However, the viscous torque (S-MN) and tan Sae decrease with the addition of bonding agent. For swelling behaviour, the water absorption of the composites increases with increasing filler loading but decreases with the addition of bonding agent. The presence of bonding agent is found to improve the adhesion between bamboo fibre and natural rubber matrix as indicated by the tensile fracture surfaces of the composites using scanning electron microscope (SEM).

40|$|Cure {{characteristics}} and tear properties of {{epoxidized natural rubber}} (ENR- 33) and natural rubber were studied. Three types of accelerators, namely 2 -mercaptobenzothiazole (MBT), 2 -morpholinothiobenzothiazole (MBS) and N-tert-butyl- 2 -benzothiazyl sulphenamide (TBBS) were used in this work. The conventional valcanization (CV) system was used. Cure characteristics were determined using a <b>Monsanto</b> Oscillating Disk <b>Rheometer</b> (ODR 2000) at 150 ºC. Also, a systematic study of tear strength was carried out before and after ageing at 70 ºC for 72 h. A Hounsfield tensometer (Model H 10 KS) operating at 500 mm/min {{was used to determine}} the tear strength using standard angle test pieces. The results indicated that scorch time and cure time of natural rubber are greater than those of ENR- 33 compounds. However, the contrary was observed for the minimum and maximum torques and the torque differences. The observation is attributed to the activation of a double bond by the adjacent epoxide group in ENR- 33. Furthermore, we found that the change in tear strength of aged ENR sample was greater than that of NR vulcanizates...|$|R

Blends were prepared using a two-roll mill at {{a temperature of}} 40 - 50 °C. The curing was assessed using a <b>Monsanto</b> oscillating disc <b>rheometer</b> R- 100.

The stress-strain experiments were performed using a tensile tester machine (Zwick 1425). Results indicate that the scorch time, ts 2, and optimum cure time, tc 90, increase with increasing CSM content in both blends. The value of modulus at 100 and 300 % elongation and tensile strength increases with increasing CSM content, whereas elongation at break shows a decreasing trend.

40|$|A <b>Monsanto</b> Automatic Capillary <b>Rheometer</b> and {{a sliding}} plate {{rheometer}} {{were used to}} study the spurt phenomenon and to discover {{whether it is the}} result of a system instability or a material property. The capillary rheometer has been the only instrument able to operate at spurt stresses up to present time, because capillary rheometers operate at shear stresses that are out of the range of rotational shear rheometers. However, a sliding plate rheometer can generate shear stresses in the spurt range. A comparative study using two linear polybutadiene samples at 50 °C was carried out using these two rheometers. Special attention was paid to the evaluation of the actual pressure drop in the capillary in order to determine the true shear stress at the wall. It was found that spurt occurs only in the capillary rheometer. In other words, the flow curve generated by the sliding plate rheometer is continuous in the shear stress range where spurt is observed in the capillary rheometer. Slip velocities were determined using data from the two rheometers, and the slip velocities for the post-slip capillary flow all fall on the smooth curve based on sliding plate data, provided that the pressure drop in the capillary, and not the overall driving pressure, is used to calculate the wall shear stress...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: The aim of {{this study}} is to {{investigate}} the influence of accelerator-vulcanizing agent system and the vulcanization temperature on the properties of vulcanizates based on Natural rubber/Polybutadiene rubber (NR/BR) compounds. This preliminary study will allow optimizing the composition for improving the mechanical properties and understanding the damage behaviour. Design/methodology/approach: NR/BR based composites with different vulcanization temperatures and curing systems were characterized in respect of their curing characteristics (for 140 ºC and 160 ºC) and mechanical properties. The cure characteristics of the rubber compounds were studied by using the <b>Monsanto</b> MDR 2000 <b>rheometer.</b> The mechanical properties were investigated- tensile strength, elongation at break, tensile modulus at 100 % (M 100) and at 300 % (M 300) deformation. The hardness (Shore A) and molecular mass of the samples were also determined. Scanning electron microscopy was used to study the microstructure of the fracture surfaces. Findings: The processing, physical, mechanical and viscoelastic properties and chemical structure of the mixture of Natural rubber/Polybutadiene rubber (NR/BR) compounds have been evaluated in detail for the compounds of D 1 and D 2 (140 / 160). Research limitations/implications: limitations/implications: Some critical point, control of the temperature during vulcanization in press, can introduce some restrictions; these measurements can play on the final vulcanizates and in the course of processing. Practical implications: In practical way, mechanical test results (tensile and shore A) give very useful information about the damage behaviour of the elastomeric matrix composites. Originality/value: Natural rubber/Polybutadiene rubber (NR/BR) compounds were mixed by additions of some certain elements to improve physical, mechanical and viscoelastic properties and damage behaviours of these compounds produced under certain conditions...|$|R
