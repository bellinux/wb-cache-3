40|$|Land-surface {{heterogeneity}} (LSH) {{at different}} scales has {{significant influence on}} atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) buoyant and shear turbulence generation and transfers of water, carbon and heat. The extent of proliferation of this influence into larger-scale circulations and atmospheric structures is a topic continually investigated in experimental and numerical studies, in many cases with the hopes of improving land-atmosphere parameterizations for modeling purposes. The blending height is a potential metric for the vertical propagation of LSH effects into the ABL, and {{has been the subject}} of study for several decades. Proper assessment of the efficacy of blending height theory invites the combination of observations throughout ABLs above different LSH scales with model simulations of the observed ABL and LSH conditions. The central goal of this project is to develop an apt and thoroughly scrutinized method for procuring ABL observations that are accurately detrended and justifiably relevant for such a study, referred to here as Detrending with Empirical Mode Decomposition (DEMD). The Duke University helicopter observation platform (HOP) provides ABL data [wind (u, v, and w), temperature (T), moisture (q), and carbon dioxide (CO 2) ] at a wide range of altitudes, especially in the lower ABL, where LSH effects are most prominent, and where other aircraft-based platforms cannot fly. Also, lower airspeeds translate to higher resolution of the scalars and fluxes needed to evaluate blending height theory. To confirm noninterference of the main rotor downwash with the HOP sensors, and also to identify optimal airspeeds, analytical, numerical, and observational studies are presented. Analytical analysis clears the main rotor downwash from the HOP nose at airspeeds above 10 m s - 1. Numerical models find an acceptable range from 20 - 40 m s - 1, due to a growing compressed air preceding the HOP nose. The first observational study finds no impact of different HOP airspeeds on measurements from ~ 18 m s - 1 to ~ 55 m s - 1 over a stable marine boundary layer (MBL). Another set of observations studies HOP and tower data, using the Duke University <b>Mobile</b> <b>Micrometeorological</b> <b>Station</b> (MMS) over an MBL, and concludes that HOP sensible heat (SH), latent heat (LE), and carbon dioxide (F CO 2) fluxes align well with MMS findings. The HOP sensors provide ABL data at 40 Hz, as well as a real-time display of θ for in-flight ABL height estimation. Sensor calibration and alignment procedures indicate usable ABL measurements. HOP data are especially susceptible to the spurious influence of platform motion on ABL data, largely due to the low-altitude and low-airspeed capabilities of the HOP. For example, HOP altitude motion in the presence of a lapse rate can cause spurious T fluctuations. Empirical mode decomposition (EMD) can separate HOP data into a set of adaptive and unique intrinsic mode functions (IMFs), often with physical meaning. DEMD aims to correct for spurious contributions to HOP data, while merging EMD with a correlation analysis to adjust data without eliminating relevant ABL dynamics. To evaluate DEMD efficacy, two-dimensional synthetic T fields with simulated turbulence over a prescribed lapse rate are sampled with altitude fluctuations similar to HOP flights, and with a wide range of T perturbation and sampling path parameter variations. DEMD recovers the prescribed lapse rate within 1 % on average for the 552 test cases passing the filtering criteria. The method is further evaluated via application to vertical cross sections taken from the Ocean-Land-Atmosphere Model (OLAM) large-eddy simulation (LES) results, where DEMD shows improved accuracy of SH recovery. DEMD is applied to three low-altitude HOP flight legs flown on 19 June 2007 during the Cloud and Land Surface Interaction Campaign (CLASIC), both as an example of practical application and to compare DEMD to the initially proposed method (Holder et al. 2011, hereafter H 11). H 11 dictates the elimination of correlated IMFs, along with other subtle differences from DEMD, which also eliminates any ABL motions embedded in those IMFs. As suspected, the H 11 method produces marked reductions of variances and turbulence kinetic energy (TKE) and substantial deviations in SH, LE, and F CO 2 compared to DEMD. DEMD detrends without unnecessary elimination. DEMD is vital for ensuring accurate scalars and fluxes from HOP data, and a strategy for future research is presented that integrates properly detrended observations from the CLASIC HOP dataset with OLAM simulations to explore LSH effects on ABL processes and evaluate blending height theory.

40|$|The eddy-covariance {{technique}} {{tends to}} underestimate turbulent heat fluxes, {{which results in}} nonclosure of the surface energy balance. This study shows experimental evidence that mesoscale turbulent organized structures, which are inherently not captured by the standard eddy-covariance technique, can affect near-surface turbulent exchange. By using a combined setup of three Doppler wind lidars above a cropland-dominated area in Germany, low-frequency turbulent structures were detected in the surface layer down to a few meters above ground. In addition, data from two <b>micrometeorological</b> <b>stations</b> {{in the study area}} were analyzed with respect to energy balance closure. In accordance with several previous studies, the data confirm a strong friction velocity dependence of the energy balance residual. At both stations, the energy balance residual was found to be positively correlated with the vertical moisture gradient in the lower atmospheric boundary layer, but at only one station was it correlated with the temperature gradient. This result indicates that mesoscale transport probably contributes more to the latent heat flux than to the sensible heat flux, but this conclusion depends largely on the measurement site. Moreover, flow distortion due to tower mountings and measurement devices affects the energy balance closure considerably for certain wind directions...|$|R

An interesting approach lies in using process-based crop yield models in combination with real-time monitoring of the input climatic data of these models, but unknown future weather remains the main obstacle to reliable yield prediction. Since accurate weather forecasts can be made only a short time in advance, much information can be derived from analyzing past weather data. This paper presents a methodology that addresses the problem of unknown future weather by using a daily mean climatic database, based exclusively on available past measurements. It involves building climate matrix ensembles, combining different time ranges of projected mean climate data and real measured weather data originating from the historical database or from real-time measurements performed in the field.

Ground and airborne data collected over the Walnut Gulch experimental watershed during the Monsoon' 90 experiment {{were used to}} test these approaches. These data consisted of eight <b>micrometeorological</b> <b>stations</b> (METFLUX) and six flights of the L-band Push Broom Microwave Radiometer (PBMR). For each PBMR flight, the 180 -m resolution L-band pixels covering the eight METFLUX sites were first aggregated to generate a 500 -m “coarse-scale” passive microwave pixel. The coarse-scale-derived soil moisture was then downscaled to the 180 -m resolution using two different surface soil moisture indexes (SMIs) : 1) the evaporative fraction (EF), which is {{the ratio of the}} evapotranspiration to the total energy available at the surface; and 2) the actual EF (AEF), which is defined as the ratio of the actual-to-potential evapotranspiration. It is well known that both SMIs depend on the surface soil moisture. However, they are also influenced by other factors such as vegetation cover, soil type, root-zone soil moisture, and atmospheric conditions. In order to decouple the influence of soil moisture from the other factors, a land surface model was used to account for the heterogeneity of vegetation cover, soil type, and atmospheric conditions. The overall accuracy in the downscaled values was evaluated to 3 % (vol.) for EF and 2 % (vol.) for AEF under cloud-free conditions. These results illustrate the potential use of satellite-based estimates of instantaneous evapotranspiration on clear-sky days for downscaling the coarse-resolution passive microwave soil moisture...|$|R

Measurements were made successively on seed potato, winter wheat and sugar beet. The general objectives of the study were, first to evaluate the relative contributions to total ecosystem respiration (TER) of heterotrophic, above ground autotrophic and below ground autotrophic respiration over a succession of three agricultural crops (seed potato, winter wheat and sugar beet) cultivated on successive years at the same location and, secondly, to identify the driving variables of these contributions. Results showed that, during the observation periods, TER was dominated by autotrophic respiration (AR) (60 – 90 %) and that AR was dominated by its above ground component (60 – 80 %). HR was found to increase with temperature and to be independent of Gross Primary Production (GPP), whereas AR was driven by GPP and was mostly independent of temperature. The AR response to GPP was specific to the crop: not only AR intensity but also AR distribution between its above- (ARa) and below- (ARb) ground components were found to differ from one crop to another and, in the winter wheat, from one development stage to another. Generally, ARb contribution to AR was found larger when carbon allocation towards roots was more important.

The main objective {{of this paper is to}} analyse the daily and seasonal pattern in PM 2. 5 concentrations and fluxes and to discuss their correlation with the main meteorological and micrometeorological parameters using high temporal resolution measurements. Observed data showed a seasonal pattern in turbulent fluxes with daytime average positive value during winter and negative during summer. Deposition velocities, ranged from – 60 to 20 mm/s, appeared to be mainly influenced by atmospheric stability. There were larger emissions in cases of high wind velocities blowing from water sector indicating a significant potential contribution of sea spray to PM 2. 5 fluxes. The local atmospheric circulation, due to the orography of the area, was characterised by diurnal winds coming from the Adriatic Sea and nocturnal wind coming from the Alps. This circulation influenced deposition velocity creating an increase of negative fluxes in the morning at the starting of the sea breeze. A diurnal pattern in concentration has been observed and it is similar for all three measurement campaigns, with higher concentrations in nocturnal periods. The daily pattern was investigated in terms of its correlation with meteorological and micro-meteorological parameters, and was found highly correlated with the diurnal pattern of boundary layer height (BLH) and with relative humidity...|$|R
40|$|Water vapour flux {{profiles}} in the atmospheric boundary layer have been derived from measurements of water vapour density fluctuations by a ground-based Differential Absorption Lidar (DIAL) and of vertical wind fluctuations by a ground-based Doppler lidar. The {{data were collected}} during the field experiment LITFASS- 2003 in May/June 2003 {{in the area of}} Lindenberg, Germany. The eddy-correlation method was applied, and error estimates of ± 50 [*]W/m 2 for latent heat flux were found. Since the sampling error dominates the overall measurement accuracy, time intervals between 60 and 120 [*]min were required for a reliable flux calculation, depending on wind speed. Rather large errors may occur with low wind speed because the diurnal cycle restricts the useful interval length. In the lower height range, these measurements are compared with DIAL/radar-RASS fluxes. The agreement is good when comparing covariance and error values. The lidar flux profiles are well complemented by tower measurements at 50 and 90 [*]m above ground and by area-averaged near surface fluxes from a network of <b>micrometeorological</b> <b>stations.</b> Water vapour flux {{profiles in}} the convective boundary layer exhibit different structures mainly depending on the magnitude of the entrainment flux.

The grass was 0. 6 m tall {{during most of the}} field campaign. The station is equipped with traditional devices, four multiplexed TDR probes, and an eddy [...] covariance apparatus sampling at 20 Hz (Gill WindMaster Sonic Anemometer and Licor Li 7500 Gas Analyzer), at about 3 m above the ground. The local winds regime is strongly affected by the morphology of the valley, and the topography is complex also due to the heterogeneity of the surrounding-areas land—cover. Using EddyPro software, the sensitivity of the turbulent fluxes estimate was assessed addressing three major issues of the data processing procedure, i. e. the choice of the computational averaging period, of the axis rotation method and of the data detrending criterion. Once identified three test periods of consecutive days without rainfall, the fluxes of momentum, sensible heat and latent heat were computed at the averaging period of 30, 60 and 120 min respectively. At each averaging period, both the triple rotation method, the double rotation method and the planar fit method were applied. Particularly the latter was applied both fitting a unique plane for all the wind directions and fitting multiple planes, one for each sector of the wind rose. Regarding the detrending criteria, data were processed with a block average and a linear detrend, the latter with time constant of 5, 30, 60 and 120 min respectively. Therefore, for each test period about 50 estimates of the fluxes were provided. As a result the obtained fluxes were compared. Even if with different flux quality, their pattern is quite stable with regard to the applied estimate procedures, but with sensitively different average values...|$|R
40|$|Peat is {{a common}} land surface {{material}} in many {{countries of the world}} and is particularly important in upland regions of the UK. Peat landscapes represent an important land use for hill farming, water management, and shooting, and are a globally scarce resource. Wind is a fundamental characteristic of upland environments in the UK and has long been recognised as a significant factor in peat erosion. This paper presents the first results of a project that aims to determine the significance of wind action in the erosion of upland peat. Wind erosion monitoring is being undertaken at Moor House in the North Pennines on a 3 -ha area of relatively flat, sparsely vegetated peat. Measurements using arrays of passive horizontal mass flux gauges (fixed orientation vertical slot gauges), together with a vertical array of mass flux samplers (directional), provide estimates of sediment flux. A <b>micrometeorological</b> <b>station</b> records local wind speed (four heights), wind direction, rainfall, soil moisture, and temperature conditions. For 1999 and 2000, the annual horizontal net erosion flux is 0. 46 and 0. 48 t ha− 1, respectively. Results of detailed monitoring over a 10 -month period demonstrate that the peat sediment flux collected in windward- and leeward-oriented sediment traps on 10 separate occasions is between 3 and 12 times greater in the windward-facing traps. The concentration of peat with height decays rapidly and the majority of the peat is transported close to the ground surface. Above 0. 3 m, very little peat is found. Significant horizontal fluxes of peat occur in both wet and dry periods. This is evaluated using the local micrometeorological data to try and predict sediment yields. Correlations among time-averaged friction velocity measurements, surface conditions, and sediment flux are complex. Event-based measurements, as opposed to cumulative sediment yields, are required to resolve this. These results quantify {{for the first time the}} significance of wind action in the erosion of peat in a UK upland environment. ...|$|R

The black screen (T 5) had the lowest solar radiation transmissivity (10. 4 %). For PAR and Rn the same tendency was observed. The highest temperature was observed under blue screen (T 4) treatment, which was 1. 3 °C higher than external condition. Blue screen (T 4) treatment also presented the highest relative humidity difference between inside and outside conditions.

Climate models predict that water limited regions around the world will become drier and warmer in the near future, including southwestern North America. We developed a large-scale experimental system that allows testing of the ecosystem impacts of precipitation changes. Four treatments were applied to 1600 m 2 plots (40 m × 40 m), each with three replicates in a piñon pine (Pinus edulis) and juniper (Juniper monosperma) ecosystem. These species have extensive root systems, requiring large-scale manipulation to effectively alter soil water availability.  Treatments consisted of: 1) irrigation plots that receive supplemental water additions, 2) drought plots that receive 55 % of ambient rainfall, 3) cover-control plots that receive ambient precipitation, but allow determination of treatment infrastructure artifacts, and 4) ambient control plots. Our drought structures effectively reduced soil water potential and volumetric water content compared to the ambient, cover-control, and water addition plots. Drought and cover control plots experienced an average increase in maximum soil and air temperature at ground level of 1 - 4 ° C during the growing season compared to ambient plots, and concurrent short-term diurnal increases in maximum air temperature were also observed directly above and below plastic structures. Our drought and irrigation treatments significantly influenced tree predawn water potential, sap-flow, and net photosynthesis, with drought treatment trees exhibiting significant decreases in physiological function compared to ambient and irrigated trees. Supplemental irrigation resulted in a significant increase in both plant water potential and xylem sap-flow compared to trees in the other treatments. This experimental design effectively allows manipulation of plant water stress at the ecosystem scale, permits a wide range of drought conditions, and provides prolonged drought conditions comparable to historical droughts in the past – drought events for which wide-spread mortality in both these species was observed. A <b>micrometeorological</b> <b>station</b> was used to document the climatic conditions at the study site.  Monitoring the ambient environment in this way allowed us to more easily determine which tree growth responses were driven by changes in the native climate as opposed to those resulting from the rainfall manipulation treatments.  Environmental factors such as temperature, relative humidity, and photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) have a huge impact on the physiological processes that are being explored in this project.  The data collected by the station created a local climatic record which was needed to provide {{the context in which the}} treatment effects can be examined and sensor readings can be interpreted...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe use {{of energy}} fluxes data to {{validate}} land surface models requires that energy balance closure conservation is satisfied, but usually this condition is not verified when the available energy {{is bigger than}} the sum of turbulent vertical fluxes. In this work, a comprehensive evaluation of energy balance closure problems is performed on a 2012 data set from Livraga obtained by a <b>micrometeorological</b> eddy covariance <b>station</b> located in a maize field in the Po Valley. Energy balance closure is calculated by statistical regression of turbulent energy fluxes and soil heat flux against available energy. Generally, the results indicate a lack of closure with a mean imbalance in the order of 20 %. Storage terms are the main reason for the unclosed energy balance but also the turbulent mixing conditions play a fundamental role in reliable turbulent flux estimations. Recently introduced in literature, the energy balance problem has been studied as a scale problem. A representative source area for each flux of the energy balance has been analyzed and the closure has been performed in function of turbulent flux footprint areas. Surface heterogeneity and seasonality effects have been studied to understand the influence of canopy growth on the energy balance closure. High frequency data have been used to calculate co-spectral and ogive functions, which suggest that an averaging period of 30 min may miss temporal scales that contribute to the turbulent fluxes. Finally, latent and sensible heat random error estimations are computed to give information about the measurement system and turbulence transport deficiencies...|$|R
40|$|Motivated by {{the demand}} for {{reliable}} area-averaged fluxes associated with natural landscapes this thesis investigates a relative new measurement technique known as the scintillation method. For homogeneous areas the surface fluxes can be derived with reasonable accuracy. However, fluxes representative for large natural landscapes (comparable to the horizontal grid box size of numerical models or the pixel size of satellite imagers) {{are more difficult to}} obtain because at these scales the surface is mostly heterogeneous. At this moment only a few techniques are available that can provide flux information at spatial scales of several kilometres, such as the scintillation method. Based on the propagation statistics of EM radiation that has propagated through the atmosphere over a horizontal path of several kilometres it is possible to derive the surface fluxes of sensible heat, water vapour and momentum. In this study a Large Aperture Scintillometer (LAS) has been developed that can be used over distances up to 5 km. Since the LAS operates at a near-infrared wavelength hence it is primarily sensitive to temperature related scintillations, from which the sensible heat flux can inferred. In this thesis the following aspects regarding the LAS are investigated: The performance of the LAS over heterogeneous land surfaces The reliability of area-averaged water vapour fluxes provided by the LAS and in combination with a radio wave scintillometer over heterogeneous land surfaces Its practical applicability and usefulness in other scientific areas For the derivation of the sensible heat flux from the LAS signal one must rely on the Monin-Obukhov Similarity Theory (MOST). However, MOST requires homogeneous surface conditions. The question arises whether the LAS can be used over distances of several kilometres, since at these scales the surface is mostly heterogeneous. In order to test experimentally the applicability of the LAS over heterogeneous areas and the reliability of the derived fluxes of sensible heat a field campaign was carried out in Flevoland (The Netherlands). The general characteristics of the Flevoland area are as follows: a vast and completely flat area covered by four crops in a chessboard configuration of patches of 500 m ´ 250 m. Based on the horizontal length scale of the patches this landscape is classified as a Type A landscape, meaning that only {{the lower part of the}} surface layer is affected by the irregularities. Eddy covariance (EC) measurements were performed over the main types of farmland to provide to aggregation independent area-averaged fluxes. The EC observations reveal that the heterogeneity in the Flevoland area is primarily the result of spatial variations in the thermal properties. The fluxes of two large aperture scintillometers, installed at a height of 11. 6 m and 20. 4 m, respectively, show a close resemblance with the area-averaged EC fluxes, especially for the upper LAS. The lower LAS shows a slight underestimation of the sensible heat flux of approximately 7 %. This underestimation is assessed using a blending height approach and an analytical footprint model for estimating the source areas and the associated fluxes. The blending height is considered as the level above the surface where the influences of the patches gradually decay. It is found, using a heuristic model that the blending height for the Flevoland area varies between 9 m and 14 m. Based on the found blending heights it is concluded that the upper LAS always measured above the blending height, which is consistent with the depicted LAS results. For the lower LAS the situation is more complicated as the individual fields influence the measurements, suggesting that the MOST may be violated. After dividing the Flevoland area into 8 wind-sectors and re-arranging the area-averaged fluxes for the entire area and for the 8 source areas, a closer agreement is found. These results indicate that from a LAS, which measures just below the blending height, still reliable area-averaged fluxes can be derived and that the violation of MOST is small. Next the performance of a combined LAS and radio wave scintillometer (LAS-RWS) over a heterogeneous land surface is studied. Although this scintillation technique, known as the two-wavelength method, provides both the sensible heat flux and the water vapour flux, most attention is focussed at the water vapour flux. The water vapour flux provided by a `stand-alone` LAS is evaluated also. In the latter case the water vapour flux is estimated as the residual of the surface energy balance equation using a simple parameterisation scheme (based on global radiation data) for estimating the area-averaged available energy (i. e. Rn - Gs). The LAS-RWS study is based also on data of the Flevoland experiment. As mentioned before the EC observations collected in Flevoland reveal that the heterogeneity in the area is primarily the result of spatial variations in the thermal properties and likewise in the buoyant production term of MOST. First, the water vapour fluxes from the combined LAS-RWS system are investigated. It was found that these fluxes agree well with the area-averaged water vapour flux aggregated from the in-situ observations. The found scatter is explained to be caused by: closure failure of the energy balance for the EC measurements, the non-linearity between the structure parameters and the inferred fluxes, and low frequency water vapour absorption fluctuations that affect the RWS. Finally, the water vapour fluxes derived from the stand-alone LAS are discussed. These results show that the `stand-alone¿ LAS can provide also reliable estimates of the area-averaged water vapour flux over heterogeneous areas (type A). In order to study the operational aspects of the LAS two LAS devices and a small <b>micrometeorological</b> <b>station</b> were installed in the Gediz Basin near Menemen (Turkey) in 1998 as part of an international experiment. The main objective of this experiment was to compare actual evapotranspiration estimates based on satellite remote sensing methods, hydrological models and field methods. This thesis deals only with the field methods, i. e. the variance method and in particular the LAS. One LAS was set-up over a transect of the valley of the Gediz river basin. For the derivation of the sensible heat flux additional wind speed and temperature data are taken from a nearby meteorological station. In addition a small micro-meteorological station was placed at an irrigated cotton field. The fluxes for this site are inferred from collected temperature fluctuation data using the variance method. Due to experimental problems with a second LAS installed at the same site these data are excluded from this study. The presented time series of 24 -hour average fluxes for the valley clearly shows the seasonal trend of the sensible heat flux, including the irrigation events. This time series demonstrates from an operational perspective that the LAS, which was operational during the entire growing season, is a robust and reliable instrument that requires only occasional servicing. Finally, it is investigated whether the LAS fluxes collected in Turkey can be used as `ground-truth` data in other scientific studies such as remote sensing. For that purpose a large number of surface flux maps are generated using the SEBAL remote sensing algorithm, and are compared with the LAS results. In this validation study the in-situ fluxes and radiation measurements of the irrigated cotton field are included also. The SEBAL fluxes are derived from moderate resolution AVHRR visible and thermal-infrared images taken from the NOAA- 14 satellite. Both instantaneous and daily average sensible heat fluxes are determined for the entire growing season. It is found that the SEBAL based instantaneous fluxes agree closely with the in-situ fluxes for the cotton site. However, the results for the valley site, i. e. SEBAL versus LAS, reveal a discrepancy. The following reasons are offered: the scaling mismatch between the source area of the LAS and the pixel size of the raw AVHRR images; a possible distortion by the dry slopes in the relative narrow valley compared to the resolution of the AVHRR imager. Therefore a convincing validation of SEBAL for the valley cannot be done. Finally, the daily average sensible heat fluxes for the cotton field are compared. It is found that only during the irrigation period the daily average results agree. Not actually dry reference pixels, which lead to underestimated evaporative fractions, are suggested to be the reason for the observed difference...|$|R

Une approche originale impliquant l'association d'un gradient de concentration de ces composés sur un profil vertical de 1, 5 m au transfert de flux turbulent micrométéorologique fut utilisée pour la détermination des flux. L'étude démontre qu'une hausse du niveau d'eau d'un bassin versant alimentant une zone humide influence les flux de méthane, de monoxyde de carbone d'hydrogène et de dioxyde de carbone. En conditions submergées, le marais émettait du méthane et du monoxyde de carbone et consommait moins d'hydrogène troposphérique. Ainsi, cette étude démontre que des mesures in situ peuvent servir à inférer des scénarios d'impacts possibles des changements climatiques et des variations des niveaux d'eau sur les émissions des gaz à effets de serre dans l'écosystème du fleuve Saint-Laurent. Wetlands {{are known}} for their great biodiversity and the important carbon reservoir that they represent. Moreover, in the global warming context, these ecosystems represent net sources or sinks for different greenhouse gases depending of their conditions. For instance, flooded conditions favour methane production whereas they prevent hydrogen and carbon monoxide soil consumption. Baie Saint-François is a freshwater wetland that opens onto Lake Saint-Pierre (St. Lawrence River) where water levels are subject to important fluctuations due to natural processes and human activities (hydroelectricity and navigation). This study was done in order {{to assess the impact of}} the Lake Saint-Pierre water level variations on the tropospheric methane, carbon monoxide, hydrogen and carbon dioxide dynamics over the wetland. Knowledge of these dynamics should provide indications about the possible effects of the decreasing or increasing water level associated with the global warming on the production or consumption of these trace gases. Studies were carried out between June and August 2003 in Baie Saint-François where soil was subjected to successions of flooded and dry conditions. Water and carbon dioxide fluxes were obtained with a Bowen ratio <b>micrometeorological</b> <b>station</b> including a high frequency single infrared gas analyser. Hydrogen, carbon monoxide and methane fluxes were estimated with the modified Bowen method, their vertical concentration gradients (1. 5 m) were measured over the plant canopy. The Bowen Ratio station was equipped with different probes to measure parameters such as net radiations, soil heat fluxes and vertical temperature gradients. The turbulent transfer coefficient (k) obtained every 20 min was assumed equal for heat, water vapour and trace gases. Hence, fluxes calculations were done by the multiplication of the turbulent transfer coefficients with the vertical concentration gradients of hydrogen, carbon monoxide and methane. The instrument used to detect hydrogen, carbon monoxide and methane was a RGA 5. This analyser has two detectors: the reductive gas detector (RGD) for hydrogen and carbon monoxide and a flame ionisation detector (FID) for methane. The RGD contains an HgO bed wherein oxygen reacts with reductive gases resulting in Hg° releases detectable by differential UV absorbance. Chemicals were detected continuously in 10 min cycles with an analytical reproducibility of ± 0. 2, 0. 3 and 2 % for hydrogen, carbon monoxide and methane. Generally, vertical concentration gradients measured were greater than these limits. A calibration gas containing hydrogen, carbon monoxide and methane at 4940, 1000 and 1000 ppbv respectively in nitrogen was analysed daily to verify calibration. To ensure data integrity, linearity of the instrument was assayed by several dilutions of the standard gas and the integration of the curves gave a correction factor for hydrogen (18 %) and carbon monoxide (13 %). An intercomparison with NOAA (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration) was done to corroborate these correction factors. Background carbon monoxide, methane and carbon dioxide levels were in agreement with literature values. However, hydrogen was low, as observed by other investigators in summertime, since this season is related to minimal concentrations. Methane followed a diurnal cycle where maximum levels were observed during nighttime. In wet conditions, these nocturnal peaks reached occasionally 4000 ppbv and could be explained by specific production mechanisms and diurnal changes of vertical mixing in the boundary layer. Sensitivity of the processes responsible for methane and carbon monoxide cycling was seen between July 21 st and 26 th where a rain episode (total precipitation of 33. 2 mm) increased their background concentrations. It seems that this precipitation was enough to favour methanogenesis and inhibit tropospheric CO and CH 4 consumptions by a reduction of the diffusion of these chemicals into the soil. Our results demonstrated that four to eleven days following a variation of the Lake Saint-Pierre water level, a change in the tropospheric hydrogen, carbon monoxide and methane concentrations was observed. This lag might be explained by the distance between the lake and the research station (about 1. 5 km) and the required time for the adaptation of soil microorganisms to the disruption of their environment. The concentration variations of these chemicals resulted from the inhibition of the processes responsible for their consumption or the activation of the processes accountable for their production. In June, the wetland was flooded and the CO 2 median flux was - 56. 5 g m- 2 d- 1. Fluxes increased significantly (Mann-Whitney, α= 0. 01) in July to 5. 30 g m- 2 d- 1, possibly due to dry conditions. Indeed, absence of water favours the activity of soil aerobic microorganisms which might produce more carbon dioxide than the quantity used by plants during photosynthesis. Methane was produced in June where the median flux was 54 mg m- 2 d- 1. These emissions were caused by the presence of water which maintained anaerobic conditions in the sediments, a suitable environment for methanogenic microorganisms. July was characterised by dry conditions, which generated aerobic environments in soils, an unfavourable microniche for methanogens. Therefore, methane median fluxes decreased significantly (Mann-Whitney, α= 0. 05) to 0. 011 mg m- 2 d- 1 in July. In August, before the end of the investigation period, water levels had increased but methane fluxes were not significantly higher than in July. Moreover, in this period, methane concentrations tended to increase, showing that after an augmentation of the Lake Saint-Pierre water level, Baie Saint-François flooding area could represent a methane source. During summer 2003, Baie Saint-François acted as a net source of carbon monoxide. In June, the median flux was 21 µg m- 2 d- 1 due to presence of water which inhibited consumption by soil. Emissions were significantly (Mann-Whitney, α= 0. 05) lower in July (15 µg m- 2 d- 1) due to the absence of water, which represented a suitable environment for microorganisms consuming tropospheric carbon monoxide. In August, the median carbon monoxide flux attained 65 µg m- 2 d- 1 due to an increase of the Lake Saint-Pierre water level. Net carbon monoxide emissions observed in wet and dry conditions might be due to the high organic content in soil and water in addition to the presence of plants since all of these are subjected to photooxidation, generating this pollutant. Therefore, an increase of the Lake Saint-Pierre water level is associated with an augmentation of tropospheric carbon monoxide due to the inhibition of the processes responsible of its consumption. A decline in the water level might result in the activation of the soil microorganisms (or abiotic hydrogenases) able to consume tropospheric hydrogen. At the beginning of the campaign (June), the median hydrogen flux was weak (- 1. 37 g m- 2 d- 1) due to the presence of water. However, a net soil consumption was seen in July, where the median hydrogen flux decreased to - 125 g m- 2 d- 1. The Lake Saint-Pierre water level increase observed in August was associated with a significant (Mann-Whitney, α= 0. 05) augmentation of the hydrogen median flux to 299 g m- 2 d- 1. Consequently, a rise in the Lake Saint-Pierre water levels induced an inhibition of the processes responsible of the tropospheric hydrogen consumption. This study illustrated that the water level fluctuations of the Lake Saint-Pierre have an impact on the H 2, CO, CH 4 and CO 2 dynamics over the surrounding wetlands. When the Lake Saint-Pierre water level decreased, the wetlands acted as a carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide source, but as a consumer of tropospheric hydrogen and a minor source of methane...|$|R
40|$|The European Nitrates Directive 91 / 6 / 76 /EEC aims {{to ensure}} water quality by {{preventing}} pollution of surface and groundwater induced by nitrates originating from agricultural sources and by promoting agronomical good practices. While {{the implementation of}} this Directive seems effective, it appears however {{that the use of}} nitrogen has still increased by 6 % {{over the last four years}} in 27 European countries. Furthermore, agricultural sources would be still at the origin of 50 % of the total amount of nitrogen discharged into surface waters ([URL] In Wallonia (Belgium), the Nitrates Directive has been transposed under the Sustainable Nitrogen Management in Agriculture Program (PGDA). Launched in 2002, it involves different sets of actions, like rules definitions concerning fertilizers application, specific and appropriate crop management in vulnerable areas, the control of potentially leachable nitrogen (APL) levels in soils, etc. This is the global context in which lies the present thesis. The main aim is to optimise the nitrogen fertiliser practices to ensure that the needs of a winter wheat culture (Triticum aestivum L.) could be met while reducing the environmental pressure. It relies on the use of crop models, which describe the growth and the development of a culture interacting with its environment, namely the soil and the atmosphere. The major difficulty while working with crop models and model-based decision support tools lies in the fact that different sources of uncertainties have an impact on the modelled phenomena. Indeed, crop models are constituted by a consequent number of differential non-linear equations, involving a lot of parameters which need to be determined as accurately as possible in order to match as close as possible observed sequences of measurements. The first source of uncertainty is thus constituted by the parameters definition. Once the model has been correctly and robustly calibrated it can be used to perform predictions. However, in an agronomical context, the time-delay between sowing and harvest is consequent. As the end-season yield is often the expected output, the uncertainty linked to the non-knowledge of the future implies for the modeller to refer to different hypothesis concerning upcoming climatic scenarios. Finally, moving from models to decision systems dealing with N management involves a last source of uncertainty. Indeed the main problem is that the impact of a given practice is delayed in time from its realisation. In addition to the uncertainty linked to climatic projections themselves, it is highly important to consider the interactions between the practices and the climate. Furthermore, in a decision-making process, it could be highly relevant to know the uncertainty's estimation that could be tolerated on the decision [...] Therefore, the present thesis aims to study these different sources of uncertainty in order to design an efficient decision support system. It is divided into five parts. In the first part, a Bayesian sampling algorithm, known as DREAM (DiffeRential Evolution Adaptative Metropolis) will be presented. It was successfully coupled with the STICS soil-crop model used in this study. The a posteriori probability density function of many parameters was sampled in order to improve the simulations of the growth of a winter wheat culture (Triticum aestivum L.). The DREAM algorithm offers different advantages in comparison to usual methods. Among these, it is possible to study i) the most probable a posteriori parameters distributions, ii) the parameters correlations, and iii) the uncertainties impacted on model outputs. Furthermore, a new version of the likelihood function was proposed, making an explicit use of the coefficient of variation. Results showed that it allowed the noise existing on measurements to be considered, but also the heteroscedasticity phenomenon usually encountered in biological growth processes. In parallel, assimilation data is another way to improve models simulations. These techniques allow considering measurements performed in real-time (e. g. remote measures of LAI or soil water content) in order to correct and adjust the possible drift of model simulations. In particular, a recently developed algorithm, known as variational filter, was evaluated. Its superiority, both in term of state variables simulations improvement and parameter resampling, was demonstrated. The third part of the research focuses on the real-time end season yield prediction. It involves building climate matrix ensembles, combining different time ranges of projected mean data and real measured weather originating from the historical records. As the crop growing season progresses, the effects of real monitored data plays a greater role and the prediction reliability increases. Our results demonstrated that a reliable predictive delay of 3 - 4 weeks before harvest could be obtained. Finally, using real-time data acquired with a <b>micrometeorological</b> <b>station</b> enabled to (i) predict, daily, potential yield at the local level, (ii) detect stress occurrence, and (iii) quantify yield losses (or gains). Being based on projected seasonal norms, this methodology is in opposition to another technique that consists to offer a panel of solution for what concerns the future. Such probabilistic technique relies on the use of stochastic weather generator (LARS-WG in this case). However, in the fourth part of this thesis, on the basis of the convergence in law theorem, it was demonstrated that in 90 % of the climatic situations, both approaches were equivalent, exhibiting RRMSE and normalised deviation criteria inferior to 10 %. Furthermore the two approaches offered similar predictive delay-time. The main difference between techniques lies in the finality. The first allows to quickly simulate the remaining yield potential, while the second aims to quantify the uncertainty level associated to the predictions. In the fifth and last part of this thesis, in order to quantify the uncertainty level associated to different modalities of N applications, the STICS model answers were studied under stochastic climatic realisations. It was demonstrated that, if no N was applied, under our temperate climatic conditions, the yield distribution could be considered as normal. However, with increasing N practices, the asymmetry level was found itself increasing. As soon as N was applied, not only were the yields higher, but also was the probability to achieve yields that were at least superior to the mean of the distribution. This undoubtedly reduced the risk for the farmer to achieve low yields levels. To summary all the researches conducted in this thesis, a N strategic decision support system was developed. In a general way, for what concerns the Hesbaye Region, the superiority of three fractions N protocols was demonstrated. In addition, the three rates fertilisation management based on the systematic applications of 60 kgN. ha- 1 at tillering and stem extension stages and offering the possibility to adapt the flag-leaf fraction in real-time appeared as an optimal strategy. Within this tool, the uncertainty associated to climatic variability could be finely characterised, and the risk encountered by the farmer was quantified for different investigated practices. But far more important, it was demonstrated that N management could be optimised in real-time. In a general way, the research should be pursued by studying more fundamentally and systematically a wide range of different agro-environmental situations. In particular, it would be interesting to study of the Genotype × Environment × Cultural practices interactions to ensure food security in a climatic changing world. La directive Européenne 91 / 6 / 76 /EEC vise à protéger la qualité de l’eau en prévenant la pollution des eaux souterraines et superficielles par les nitrates provenant de sources agricoles et en promouvant l’usage de bonnes pratiques. Si la mise en œuvre de cette directive s’avère efficace, il apparaît cependant que l’utilisation d’azote a augmenté de 6 % au cours des quatre dernières années dans les 27 Etats membres et que l’agriculture est toujours à l’origine de plus de 50 % de la quantité totale d’azote déversée dans les eaux superficielles ([URL] En Wallonie, la directive «Nitrates» est transposée sous la forme du Programme de Gestion Durable de l'Azote (PGDA). Entré en vigueur en 2002, celui-ci comporte un ensemble de mesures comme, par exemple, la fixation de règles au niveau de l’épandage des fertilisants, la mise en place de modes de gestion spécifiques des cultures en zones vulnérables, la mesure des teneurs en azote potentiellement lessivable (APL) dans les sols, etc. La thèse de doctorat s'inscrit dans ce contexte général qui vise à optimiser la quantité de fertilisants azotés à apporter à une culture de blé d’hiver (Triticum aestivum L.). Elle s’appuie sur un modèle de culture ou modèle écophysiologique, qui décrit la croissance et le développement d’une culture en interaction avec le sol et l’atmosphère. La difficulté majeure dans l’utilisation d’un tel modèle en tant qu'outil d’aide à la décision est liée aux nombreuses incertitudes qui interviennent à différents niveaux. En effet, les modèles de culture dynamiques sont constitués d’un grand nombre d’équations différentielles non-linéaires, comportant de nombreux paramètres à estimer pour que les sorties se rapprochent le plus possible de séquences observées. Une première source d’incertitude existe donc au niveau des paramètres du modèle. Une fois le modèle robustement calibré, il peut être utilisé à des fins prédictives. Toutefois, dans un contexte agronomique, le délai entre la date de semis et celle de récolte est important. Comme il est souhaitable de prédire le rendement final d’un point de vue quantitatif et qualitatif, différentes hypothèses sur les scénarios climatiques qui interviennent pendant la saison culturale doivent être posées.|$|R
