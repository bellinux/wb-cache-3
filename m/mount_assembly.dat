40|$|To {{cope with}} the rapid {{technological}} advances, product proliferation, shorter product lifecycles, and increasing competition, electronics companies are adopting flexible assembly strategies using multiple surface <b>mount</b> <b>assembly</b> modules to produce many different products in small batches. The component placement machines account for over half the investment in surface <b>mount</b> <b>assembly</b> lines, and also require considerable setup time (comparable to the actual processing time for small lot sizes) to changeover production from one product to another. This paper addresses a tactical planning problem for high mix, low volume electronics assembly facilities containing several placement machines (modules) operating in parallel. We propose an optimization model to decide which product families to assemble on each machine {{in order to minimize}} the total setup cost per demand period while ensuring that none of the machines is overloaded. Unlike strategic and operational models that emphasize either workload balancing or setup optimization, our tactical planning model simultaneously considers both these conflicting factors.

40|$|Purpose – This paper aims to {{demonstrate}} the innovative functionality of additive manufacturing technology provided by combining multiple processes for the fabrication of packaged electronics. Design/Methodology/Approach – This research {{is focused on the}} improvement in resolution of conductor deposition methods through experimentation with build parameters. Material dispensing with two different low temperature curing isotropic conductive adhesive materials were characterised for their application in printing each of three different conductor designs, traces, z-axis connections and fine pitch flip chip interconnects. Once optimised, demonstrator size can be minimised within the limitations of the chosen processes and materials. Findings – The proposed method of printing z-axis through layer connections was successful with pillars 2 mm in height and 550 µm in width produced. Dispensing characterisation also resulted in tracks 134 µm in width and 38 µm in height allowing surface <b>mount</b> <b>assembly</b> of 0603 components and thin-shrink small outline packaged integrated circuits. Small 149 µm flip chip interconnects deposited at a 457 µm pitch have also been used for packaging silicon bare die. Originality/Value – This paper presents an improved multifunctional additive manufacturing method to produce fully packaged multilayer electronic systems. It discusses the development of new 3 D printed, through layer z-axis connections and the use of a single electrically conductive adhesive material to produce all conductors. This facilitates the surface <b>mount</b> <b>assembly</b> of components directly onto these conductors before Stereolithography is used to fully package multiple layers of circuitry in a photopolymer...|$|E
