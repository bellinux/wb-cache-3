5|$|Exeter {{had been}} badly damaged {{in the battle}} with Admiral Graf Spee, and Dorsetshire escorted her back to Britain in January 1940, before {{returning}} to South American waters to search for German supply ships. On 11 February, her reconnaissance aircraft spotted the German supply freighter Wakama twelve <b>miles</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>coast</b> of Brazil, which was promptly scuttled by her crew. Dorsetshire {{arrived on the scene}} shortly thereafter, picked up ten officers and thirty-five crewmen and sank Wakama to prevent her from being a navigational hazard. The following month, the President of Panama, Augusto Samuel Boyd, sent a formal complaint to the British government protesting against Dorsetshires violation of the Pan-American Security Zone in the Wakama incident.|$|E
5|$|Lipsett {{decided to}} tow New Mexico for {{scrapping}} at Newark, New Jersey. The proximity of Newark to rail lines {{made it an}} ideal location for dismantling the ship and hauling away the steel. In early November 1947 New Mexico departed Boston, towed by two tugs. On 12 November, while {{off the coast of}} New York, the tugs pulling the battleship encountered heavy weather and were forced to cut the tow lines. Running lights were kept on aboard New Mexico along with three crewmembers, but the tugs eventually lost sight of the battleship. New Mexico then drifted as a derelict until spotted by a Coast Guard plane the next day, 35 <b>miles</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>coast.</b> The two tugs then secured tow lines and continued the journey to the scrapyard.|$|E

5|$|The {{formation}} of Tropical Storm Juliette {{can be traced}} back to a tropical wave that emerged off the western coast of Africa on September12. After interacting with a secondary wave over the central Atlantic a few days later, it entered the eastern Caribbean, becoming steadily better defined. Convective activity was enhanced as the wave passed into the West Caribbean on September22 and it moved inland over Central American shortly thereafter. A broad area of low pressure formed along the wave axis on September27 and convection steadily increased; around 0000UTC on September19, the system acquired enough organization to be declared a tropical depression. Twelve hours later, the system intensified into Tropical Storm Juliette. Turning northwest as a result of an upper-level trough, the system attained its peak with winds of 60mph (95km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of 997mb (hPa; 29.44inHg) at 1200UTC on September30. Strong wind shear began to affect the storm thereafter, causing it to steadily weaken to tropical depression strength by 0000UTC on October2. Twelve hours later, the system degenerated into a remnant low. The low meandered several hundred <b>miles</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>coast</b> of Baja California before degenerating into a trough on October5.|$|E
5|$|On 25 January 1942 U-105 left Lorient on {{her fifth}} patrol. On 31 January she sank the British warship , part of Convoy SL-98, {{south-west}} of Ireland, and, on 5 February 1942, she rescued seven men from a crashed German Dornier Do 24 350 <b>miles</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>coast</b> of France. U-105 returned to Lorient on 8 February. Seventeen days later, on 25 February, U-105 left Lorient. Between 25 and 27 March, she sank the British merchant ship Narragansett and the Norwegian merchant ship Svenør off {{the east coast}} of the United States. U-105 returned to Lorient on 15 April after spending 50 days in the North Atlantic, and left on another patrol on 7 June. While crossing the Bay of Biscay, she was attacked by an Australian Short Sunderland aircraft from No. 10 Squadron RAAF. U-105 sought shelter in Ferrol, Spain and did not leave until 28 June, when she departed for Lorient, which she reached on the 30th. The attack apparently caused serious damage, as she did not sail again until 23 November. During this period, Oberleutnant zur See Hans-Adolf Schweichel was put in command of the boat, but did not undertake any patrols and was replaced by Oberleutnant zur See Jürgen Nissen, under whose command U-105 left Lorient.|$|E

25|$|Dora was {{the only}} storm in {{recorded}} history to affect Jacksonville with hurricane-force winds, though {{the city has been}} affected by weaker storms as well as hurricanes that lost intensity before reaching the area. In September 1999, after Hurricane Floyd struck the Bahamas, over one million Floridians were evacuated from coastal areas, many of them from Jacksonville. Mayor John Delaney announced the mandatory evacuation of the Jacksonville Beaches and other low lying neighborhoods early on September 14; in total, nearly 80,000 Jacksonville residents left their homes. Ultimately the storm turned northward 125 <b>miles</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>coast,</b> causing only minor damage in Jacksonville and the southeastern US before making ground in North Carolina.

25|$|In early 1995, the Philippines {{discovered}} a primitive Chinese military structure on Mischief Reef in the Spratly Islands, {{one hundred and}} thirty nautical <b>miles</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>coast</b> of Palawan. The Philippine government issued a formal protest over China's occupation of the reef and the Philippine Navy arrested sixty-two Chinese fishermen at Half Moon Shoal, eighty kilometers from Palawan. A week later, following confirmation from surveillance pictures that the structures were of military design, President Fidel Ramos had the military forces in the region strengthened. He ordered the Philippine Air Force to dispatch five F-5 fighters backed by four jet trainers and two helicopters, while the navy sent two additional ships. The People’s Republic of China had claimed that the structures were shelters for fishermen but these small incidents could have triggered {{a war in the}} South China Sea.|$|E
25|$|The trawler {{designated}} in U.S. Navy {{records as}} An Xuyen Province Trawler (map reference #1) was first sighted on 28 February approximately 150 miles east southeast of Vũng Tàu holding a southeasterly course. On {{the evening of}} the 29th she changed to a westerly course and USCGC Winona started a covert surveillance. The trawler crossed the 12 mile limit at 0120 1 March and began a run for the beach near the mouth of the Bo De River at 0200. A blocking force placed near the mouth of the river consisted of several Navy PCF's and the Coast Guard cutters Point Hudson, Point Grace, and Point Marone. Winona fired warning shots eight <b>miles</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>coast</b> which were ignored so she opened up with her 5 inch/38 caliber gun after receiving return fire from the trawler. The trawler exploded in a huge fireball after taking several direct hits and sank approximately seven miles off the beach. Winona was struck by several pieces of debris from the explosion, however only minor injuries were sustained by the crew during the action.|$|E

25|$|At 11:30 PM on {{the evening}} of Saturday June 8, 1990, an {{explosion}} in the cargo room of the Norwegian oil tanker the Mega Borg “ruptured the bulkhead between the pump room and the engine room”, causing the ship to catch fire and begin to leak oil. The 853-foot-long, 15-year-old vessel was about 50 <b>miles</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>coast</b> of Galveston, Texas when the explosion occurred. The weather at the time was calm and the tanker had easily passed Coast Guard safety inspections in April earlier that year. While the direct cause of the engine room explosion remains unknown, the initial blast occurred during a lightening process in which the Mega Borg was transferring oil onto a smaller Italian tanker, the Fraqmura, in order to then transport the oil to Houston. This transfer was necessary, as the Mega Borg was too large to dock at the Texas port. Three million gallons of the total 38 million gallons of light Angolan Palanca crude oil on board the tanker were able to be transferred to the Fraqmura before the blast.|$|E
25|$|McDonnell {{advocated}} drilling off the Virginia {{coast of}} the Atlantic Ocean as a possible revenue source for the state. However, according to the law, Virginia could not receive any revenues from drilling in federal waters, which included all drilling sites more than 3 <b>miles</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>coast.</b> On May 6, 2010, the Department of Interior suspended the proposed auction of offshore Virginia leasing rights. Congressman Moran issued a statement commending the decision. On May 18, Moran forwarded to McDonnell a Department of Defense report finding that the proposed lease site would interfere with naval operations. On May 25, McDonnell reaffirmed his interest in having oil drilling off the Virginia coast notwithstanding the British Peteroleum oil spill and the inability of Virginia to get any of the royalty income. On May 27, President Obama announced that the offshore Virginia lease sale was cancelled. Subsequently, McDonnell proposed continuing a federal environmental study of drilling off the Virginia coast or drilling for just gas and not oil. However, a consulting firm said that liquids are almost always produced with gas offshore and so the proposed idea may not be possible.|$|E
