50|$|In March 2016, {{mayor of}} Belgrade Siniša Mali {{announced}} the massive {{reconstruction of the}} bridge, slated to begin in the late 2017. In the next 15 months, both Mali and the city architect, Milutin Folić, explained that the project was to include the widening of the bridge with one extra car lane in each direction and separate tram tracks. The <b>metalic</b> arch construction {{was supposed to be}} cut and elevated above the traffic lanes, effectively making the bridge on two levels and the documentation asked for the bridge's specific metal arch to be preserved. Upper level was to be turned into the pedestrian and bicycle paths with lush vegetation. Ending constructions were to be replaced and instead of the main bridge span one pillar with the joint beam was projected. Width of the navigation path on the Sava river at the bridge's main span was to remain the same. They named the Tehran's Tabiat Bridge as an inspiration.|$|E

This {{is an essential}} step in modelling of electromagnetic forming of <b>metalic</b> sheets. The finite element method is employed in the conducting region of the <b>metalic</b> sheet. The boundary element method relies on the Stratton-Chu representation formula and it models the electromagnetic field in the air including its decay at infinity.

40|$|The main objektive of the {{bachelor}} thesis is to evolve problems of <b>metalic</b> surface welding and {{to implement the}} basic partition of the most expanded used technologies of surface welding. Sometimes {{we can see the}} term deposition <b>metalic</b> surface welding too but in practice is used technical term <b>metalic</b> surface welding. The introdution includes the basic acquaintance with problems and the characterization of the proces of surface welding including the summary of its advantages and disadvantages. In other chapters we aim on individual technologies of surface welding, its principle and using in technical practice. Simultaneously is worked out the overview of already unused or minimally used technologies of surface welding. After the presentation of individual technologies follows the section dealing with partition of materials used for surface welding by the basic material as well as surface welding materials at the present technical practice. In the experimental section of thesis follows selected examples of using the presented technologies of surface welding in practice at present...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} numerical {{stress calculation}} in the stationary temperature domain for a hybride structure with fiber composite (for example, {{based on the}} epoxy risen as matrice of prepreg) and <b>metalic</b> part (other part of structure or <b>metalic</b> mould), as different material {{according to their own}} thermical behaviour. The thermal stress analysis is based on the finite element method. A sample problem involving such a composite plate and <b>metalic</b> part of structure or mould at two different temperature levels, corresponding to curing process (co-curing) and operating temperatures respectively, is calculated and discussed. The specifics of composite are emphasized particularly for thermal coefficients (especially shear coefficient is different than zero, there are situations when some of coefficients could be less then zero). This composites as generalized orthotropic material are completelly different than isotropic material (for isotropic material shear coefficient is always equal zero). It was pointed out also that the calculation for the initial crack to appear in the lamellae (the most common occurrence of cracks in the matrix) can be set with a reserve of elasticity or without reserve...|$|E
40|$|Printed {{electronics}} is {{an emerging}} manufacturing technology with applications in consumer electronics including future display products. Direct deposition {{methods such as}} inkjet printing {{can be used to}} deposit droplets of ink directly onto a substrate using an additive method. A wide variety of materials including dielectrics, metals, organic semiconductors, etc., can be printed. <b>Metalic</b> nanoparticles, in particular, are used for <b>metalic</b> inks due to the quantum confinement effect observed in these <b>metalic</b> inks when the size of the particles is less than 100 nanometers. For example, copper nanoparticle inks for inkjet printing are a promising substitute for more expensive silver- or gold-based inks for consumer electronics applications. However, because of the relatively high melting temperature of copper and tendency to oxidize in ambient atmosphere the utilization of copper in the printed electronics industry was delayed. This paper we will present novel inkjettable copper nanoparticle inks for use with Kapton substrates. Copper is a common material in electronics and less expensive than noble metals. Potential applications for printable copper inks range from polymer based flexible circuits, metalization and printable transistors for backplanes among others. 1...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the issues of {{locating}} and marking both <b>metalic</b> and optical transmission network. The choice of an appropriate program for creation and management of map document is discussed. In the following chapter some necessary adjustments to the ArcGIS ArcView program are made {{so that it is}} applicable to the field of telecommunication networks. The last chapter addresses the design of documentation options in optical transmission network. For <b>metalic</b> cables the possibilities of attaching transmitter to a cable and locating the induced magnetic field is covered. Among the methods for finding optical cables we list ways of locating through the use of markers, GPS location and added <b>metalic</b> conductors. Fundamentals of markers and their types are thoroughly analysed. In the chapter on GPS we examine how this system works and evaluate its accuracy. The next chapter enumerates requirements that a program should meet. We analyse properties of considered programs and evaluate them with respect to these requirements. For a chosen program the possibilities of enriching it with selected map document are discussed. For these map document, information about their applicability and source is presented. We also quote the cost for these maps wherever possible. The last chapter treats ways of documenting optical networks...|$|E
