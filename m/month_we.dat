500|$|Three years later, in the {{build-up}} to {{the release}} of Manhunt 2, the controversy re-ignited. Two days after announcing the game, which was set for release in July, Take-Two Interactive (Rockstar's parent company) issued a statement which read, in part: [...] "We are aware that in direct contradiction to all available evidence, certain individuals continue to link the original Manhunt title to the Warren Leblanc case in 2004. The transcript of the court case makes it quite clear what really happened. At sentencing the Judge, defense, prosecution and Leicester police all emphasized that Manhunt played no part in the case." [...] Later that day, however, Patrick and Giselle Pakeerah condemned the decision to release a sequel, and insisted that Manhunt was a factor in their son's murder. Upon the announcement of the sequel, Patrick stated [...] "I'm very disappointed. This is rubbing salt into the wounds in the <b>month</b> <b>we</b> will be marking the anniversary of Stefan's death. I'm very surprised they are doing this after all that has happened and all the publicity." [...] Giselle added [...] "It is an insult to my son's memory that they have announced this game in the <b>month</b> <b>we</b> will be marking this anniversary. These game moguls are {{making a lot of money}} out of games which are morally indecent. Why do they have to pump more violence into society?" [...] Leicester East MP Keith Vaz supported the Pakeerahs, claiming he was [...] "astonished" [...] that Rockstar were making a sequel; [...] "It is contempt for those who are trying very hard to ensure something is done to control the violent nature of these games." ...|$|E
500|$|New Seasons {{met with}} WNA {{and offered to}} {{reproduce}} the painting, either {{on the east side}} of the Red Fox Vintage building or the west side of the planned grocery store. Luening said the latter option was more practical, because the artist could paint on panels in her studio instead of working outside. New Seasons hired Dan Cohen of Dan Cohen Creative Labs to duplicate the mural using a method similar to one he uses in his work as a [...] "mega mural" [...] painter. He said of the process: I paint giant advertising murals all over the country. I do about one mural a <b>month.</b> <b>We</b> create the pattern using the original image, and paint on top of it. We use a special machine [...] that works like an arc welder.|$|E

2500|$|On January 17, 1985, American Airlines {{launched}} Ultimate Super Saver fares in {{an effort}} to compete with low cost carrier People Express Airlines. Donald Burr, the CEO of People Express, is quoted as saying [...] "We were a vibrant, profitable company from 1981 to 1985, and then we tipped right over into losing $50 million a <b>month...</b> <b>We</b> had been profitable from the day we started until American came at us with Ultimate Super Savers."

2500|$|With their {{previous}} contract with Warner Bros. Records having expired in 2011, the band re-signed to Warner Bros. for the United States and to Bella Union in Europe in early 2012. The first release under these new deals was The Flaming Lips and Heady Fwends, initially released as a limited edition vinyl-only package for Record Store Day on April 21. The album features collaborations with {{artists such as}} Kesha, Nick Cave, and Erykah Badu. In an interview with American Songwriter, Coyne stated that [...] "Since we were releasing music every <b>month,</b> <b>we</b> {{thought it would be}} a little bit boring for us each month to say 'Well here's four more Flaming Lips songs.' We just thought 'Well we'll get some of our friends, and we'll do collaborations and see what happens.'" [...] The album later received a wider release on CD and digitally on June 26 in the US and July 30 in Europe.|$|E
2500|$|Andrea Towers of Entertainment Weekly {{notes in}} her {{assessment}} of the review: [...] "From Camelot to Neverland, the show has never quite been able to sustain itself when it’s simply Storybrooke, as much {{as some of the}} better stories have been rooted there. So it’s not a shock to find out that, after tonight, we’re probably going to be spending some time in the Underworld next <b>month.</b> <b>We</b> already know we’re meeting Hercules and Megara; given tonight’s events, does that also mean we’re meeting Hades? The bigger (and more interesting) question at stake is the fact that now that we’re in the Underworld, how many previously dead characters {{are going to get a}} chance to return? We’ve already had confirmations of past-dead characters like Cruella and Cora, though both of those characters are supposedly strictly for the show’s 100th episode. Regardless, moving to the Underworld opens up a host of options for 5B in terms of characters and plot, and I’m curious to see what those options are." ...|$|E
