The EPEC algorithm partitions the colour table into clusters of size equal to a power of 2 so that embeddable pixels can be used efficiently. Our experiments also prove that by adding 'virtual' colours in an informed manner to the colour table of images with significant low-frequency components can significantly increase the embedding capacity without inflicting distortion on the stego-images. ...|$|R

40|$|Over {{the last}} twenty years the {{architectural}} field has seen the development of the so-called “Deconstructivism”, showing a great tendency to break the rules regarding regularity and symmetry, right-angles, vertical and horizontal planes. These aspects had been proposed and tacitly accepted for centuries, becoming the prevailing compositional rules up to modern times (with a peak in neoclassical architecture) and characterising a great many public and private buildings; with some exceptions which, as anomalies, have become a great tourist attraction. Modern buildings following the new trend show conspicuous examples of perceptual incongruity. This visual property, with its emotional repercussions, constitutes its most salient feature, regardless of the usual philosophical references and of the rationalisations accompanying the designs at a theoretical level. The taste for incongruity is found both in the blueprints and in the final constructions, including examples by Frank O. Gehry, located in Europe or in the United States; or buildings, such as the UFA multiscreen cinema here in Dresden, designed by Wolf Dieter Prix, Helmut Swiczinsky and associates; or works by Daniel Libeskind, Peter Eisenman, Zaha Adid, Bernard Tshumi and others (Papadakis, 1994; Thiel-Siling, 1999). Continuity and novelty aspects, with respect to previous relatively incongruous buildings, have been carefully evaluated; and more in general, speaking of incongruity, we should quote Bruner & Postman (1949), Berlyne (1960), Venturi (1966). From a psychological standpoint, we found it interesting and useful to demonstrate the possibility of modifying – through appropriate verbal messages transmitted to beholders – the intensity of the perceptions of incongruity and their possible anxiety arousing power. These studies derive from previous investigations which had shown the possibility to manipulate perceptual incongruity and its correlates, by using verbal explanations which reduced the degree of “open conflict” when perceiving paradoxical configurations; or, depending on their content, managed to accentuate the conflict if this was initially “latent” (Bartoli, Biasi & Bonaiuto, 1989). Similar results there also obtained with non-verbal <b>messages</b> (<b>colours</b> and symbols). In the last experiment, the conflict-reducing procedure based on written verbal descriptions was applied with observers involved in examining slide projections of large full-colour pictures of two very incongruent buildings: the Dresden UFA multiscreen cinema just mentioned and the two parodoxical towers of Prague. Comparisons were made of the resulting effects of fitting interpretations and appropriate explanations, or of extraneous texts or even the absence of explanations...|$|R
40|$|The toy {{has always}} existed. To state {{that it is}} ageless presupposes a sentimental regret typical of the adult who denies the {{inevitable}} gradual disappearance of the child within us. However it is expedient {{to take note of}} how, year after year, our society is losing the fundamental essence of what an object gives us. The essence which we refer to is imagination. It is through imagination that fantasy, enjoyment and perhaps ephemeral happiness are born. The toy has undergone a long journey {{on its way to the}} present: from stone figures, rough homemade wooden forms, scraps or lines traced on a surface which have become the attractive and simple pastime that we nowadays call board games. In this document we set out to analyse the major advertising catalogues from 2006 and 2007 paying particular attention to those pertaining to Christmas advertising campaigns. We consider the different types of toys and their potential market, along with the images, <b>messages,</b> slogans, <b>colours</b> and prices. The paper concludes by identifying stereotypes, roles and division of household tasks, drawing out the clearly consumer driven intentions of companies operating in the toy sector...|$|R
40|$|Traditional visual {{cryptography}} {{is mainly}} used to hide one secret message {{in two or}} more black and white images called share images. The secret message can be revealed by stacking the share images without any computation. Visual cryptography is safe because secret messages cannot be revealed {{by one of the}} share images. Traditional visual cryptography is impractical though, as secret messages are always black-and-white text or simple images. Recently, many researchers have used grey-level images or colour images for secret messages that can be much more complex. Furthermore, these complex and large secret messages can be protected employing visual cryptography. This paper presents a new method of producing multicoloured share images based on visual cryptography. A horizontal rotation is employed to reveal a second secret <b>colour</b> <b>message.</b> This proposed method can create share multicoloured secret messages and, moreover, provide safety...|$|R

50|$|The {{speeches of}} Sadhu Kochoonju Upadesi was {{enjoyed by the}} old and young alike. He used {{a wide range of}} stories, examples, {{experiences}} and humour liberally throughout his <b>messages</b> to add <b>colour</b> to his speeches. He was very inclined to people experience a born again warmth than bored again. He incorporated his own composed songs in these gatherings, which later made his revised hymns popular. So the ministry of Sadhu Kochoonju Upadesi had great results in Kerala and South India. The results were that many came to hear {{what he had to say}} and accepted Christ as their saviour in this meetings. It wasn't an unusual thing to see drunkards coming to his meetings and going back as a new men. Most of these conversions were genuine and those who came to Christ shared their understanding of faith with their friends and family. Thus the ministry of Kochoonju was a great success. His modus operandi brought revival to many parts of South India which opened the doors to many future Christian missions.|$|R
40|$|Currently, {{as the use}} of cross border communication, global media, and {{advanced}} telecommunication are increasing and undergoing constant development, geographical borders are becoming less important. However, the impact on psychological borders is not as evident, making international market communication complicated and challenging, as marketers need to decide whether to standardize or adapt their marketing activities. Today, the majority of advertising spending in most countries is put on print advertising. This has led to the purpose of this thesis, which was to gain a deeper understanding of how print advertising is standardized/adapted in international markets. In order to reach this purpose the <b>message,</b> contents, and <b>colours</b> used in international print advertising were investigated. This was done by observing full-page advertisements in two different magazines from three different countries. Print advertising in each country represents a case and each magazine a subunit within the cases. The result of the study is that the message and contents in international print advertising are partly standardized and partly adapted, while the use of colours is mostly standardized. Further, the study also indicates a lack in theory and provides a list of these shortcomings. Validerat; 20101217 (root...|$|R
40|$|In {{this thesis}} I {{investigate}} aesthetic preference for picture books among children aged 3 – 6 {{as well as}} criteria for preference among parents. Through my design project: illustration of a picture book, I aim to put my research on preference {{in the context of}} illustration and design. By using the design project as an applied method for research I have sought to answer how one as an illustrator can apply knowledge regarding preferences of the target groups when illustrating for picture books. I have primarily based my research within the field of cognitive developmental psychology, with primary focus on stage theory, and the field of literature. I also performed small scale studies on preference as well as a web survey. The results regarding childrens preferences confirm previous studies. It shows that children base preference mainly on subject matter and colour. They also show preference for saturated colours and pictures with less realism. The parents tended to like what their children like regarding <b>colour.</b> <b>Message,</b> conversation and humour were found to be significant, but not generalizable criteria for preference among parents. These findings were summarized and used as guide lines during the process of illustrating a picture book...|$|R

Moreover, within each sphere, the colours distribute sparsely and uniformly. As a result, a large number of gaps would appear between colours with high occurrences in the histograms of the stego-images. Such a phenomenon usually do not appear in natural images, therefore its appearance would attract the steganalyst's attention. This is why histogram and histogram characteristic functions have been extensively used in measuring the security of stegonagraphic schemes [18 – 20]. By analysing the histogram of the stego-image, the attacker can easily detect the spheres in the form of aggregated clusters separated by large gaps in the histogram. These gaps allow the attacker to reconstruct the sphere/cluster configuration and even infer the hidden message. Compared to [15, 16], the proposed PEC algorithm does not separate the 3 -deminsional RGB colour for generating colours. Instead, all the physical colours are preserved while some virtual colours are added to expand the clusters in order to increase embedding capacity without inflicting high distortion. Hence, the attacker cannot detect separated clusters in the histogram.|$|R
40|$|Abstract:- Steganography is an {{application}} of data hiding which can attain camouflage and increase security by embedding the secret message into digital media for sending to the receiver without leaking to the third party. Several proposed methods which construct stegoimage by embedding the secret <b>message</b> into the <b>colour</b> palette. The person who receives the stegoimage can extract the secret message from the palette obtained by the received image. This method, however, greatly degrades {{the quality of the}} stegoimage and tends to arouse the intention of the intruders. In this paper, we propose a method for constructing stegoimages with high quality which greatly eliminate the above problem. The advantage of the proposed method is that the image quality is highly improved by accompanying with improvement of security and camouflage of the secret message. In order to avoid the intruder to attack the generated palette when transmission, the sender does not need to send the palette to the receiver directly, but instead asking the receiver to own a copy of the original secret image or obtain one when needed for extracting the secret message. Fortunately, there are several image pools which contain a lot of images allowing to be accessed by the public. The experimental results show that our method outperforms EZ stego and the methods proposed by Fridrich and Wu et al. Key-Words:- Steganography, Palette optimization, Minimum Spanning Tree...|$|R
40|$|Objective: Several {{countries}} have recently implemented national bowel cancer screening programs. To ensure {{equal access to}} screening, information is needed to suit adults ranging in literacy level. Decision aids are effective in providing balanced information and have been applied in screening. However, few have been designed for populations with lower education and literacy. This article describes the development and preliminary evaluation of a bowel cancer screening decision aid for this group. Method: We conducted face-to-face interviews with adults of varying literacy ability, to develop the decision aid (Stage I). We applied principles of plain language, created visual illustrations to support key textual <b>messages,</b> and used <b>colour</b> coding to direct the reader through the booklet. We then explored its acceptability and Comprehension among consumers with higher and lower education (Stage 2). Participants were recruited from a community sample with lower education and a university alumni network. Results: A total of 75 participants were interviewed, 43 with lower educational attainment and 32 with university education. The decision aid was positively reviewed by both education groups. Results highlighted the need to clarify {{the purpose of the}} decision aid and the availability of choice in the context of screening, especially to those with lower education. Conclusion: The 2 stage iterative development process identified important factors to consider in the development of decision tools for this target group, and is recommended. Practice implications: Our findings have implications for how to support people with lower education and literacy make informed screening decisions...|$|R
40|$|We have {{designed}} and built a mobile emotional messaging system named eMoto. With it, users can compose messages through using emotion-related gestures as input, rendering a <b>message</b> background of <b>colours,</b> shapes and animations expressing the emotional content. The design intent behind eMoto was {{that it should be}} engaging physically, intellectually and socially, and allow users to express themselves emotionally in all those dimensions, involving them in an affective loop experience. In here, we describe the user-centred design process that lead to the eMoto system, but focus mainly on the final study where we let five friends use eMoto for two weeks. The study method, which we name in situ informants, helped us enter and explore the subjective and distributed experiences of use, as well as how emotional communication unfolds in everyday practice when channelled through a system like eMoto. The in situ informants are on the one hand users of eMoto, but also spectators, that is close friends who observe and document user behaviour. Design conclusions include the need to support the sometimes fragile communication rhythm that friendships require – expressing memories of the past, sharing the present and planning for the future. We saw that emotions are not singular state that exist within one person alone, but permeates the total situation, changing and drifting as a process between the two friends communicating. We also gained insights into the under-estimated but still important physical, sensual aspects of emotional communication. Experiences of the in situ informants method include the need to involve participants in the interpretation of the data obtained, as well as establishing a closer connection with the spectators.

40|$|Thesis (M. A. (Communication Studies)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2004. A logo lies {{central in}} an organisation's visual {{identity}} system {{and it is}} a way of communicating fundamental aspects about the organisation, such as the organisation personality or the organisation's mission and vision. The logo, or corporate visual identity, could be seen as the organisation's visual shorthand that summarises these fundamental aspects. A design element such as colour can be an expressive tool in terms of visual identity. The use of a particular colour in the logo of an organisation conveys a specific message about that company's identity and personality through the meaning and symbolism that is attached to the colour. The corporate colour scheme of an organisation can also aid in communication without being displayed in context of the visual identity. The combination of both verbal communication such as text, and visual communication such as images, through a design element like colour, could provide an effective method of conveying information. The nature of this study is descriptive. It examined the role played by colour in an organisation's visual identity as a communication tool. The study followed a qualitative approach, making use of a literature study and a case study approach. In the literature study, the role of the graphic designer, the visual identity and a design element like colour in the context of corporate communication were examined. The sources of evidence used for the case study approach, were questionnaires, as well as a colour analysis of the corporate colour schemes of each of the selected case organisations as utilised in their visual identities. The research project attempted to determine the role of colour as communication, as well as the motivation behind the use of a particular colour, should such a motivation exist, and the communication intended behind each colour. The project also attempted to determine the target markets at which the communication is aimed; the research done by each of the case organisations regarding colour symbolism and the suitability of the colour regarding the target markets; and the importance attached to colour as a communication tool. These questions were investigated through the use of the questionnaires. The colour analysis was done to function as a control mechanism to, for example, determine whether the intended <b>message</b> behind <b>colour</b> correlated to the perceived message as determined by the colour analysis. The results from the questionnaires and colour analysis used in the study showed that colour does play an important role in the selected case organisation's visual identities. The results of the study also found, however, that regardless of how important colour was viewed as a method of communication by the respondents, certain factors exist which influence the effectiveness of colour as a communication tool.
