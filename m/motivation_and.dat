40|$|How {{to enhance}} prosocial employees&# 039; {{commitment}} to their organizations is of both theoretical and practical importance. The present study argues that {{a high level of}} organizational commitment in prosocial employees is predicted by bipartite synergy between employees&# 039; prosocial <b>motivations</b> <b>and</b> their supervisors&# 039; prosocial motivations, between employees&# 039; prosocial <b>motivations</b> <b>and</b> their organizations&# 039; prosocial orientations, and tripartite synergy among all three. Polynomial regressions and hierarchical regression analyses are undertaken on data collected from a sample of 216 full-time employees in China. The results show that perceived fit between employees and supervisors&# 039; prosocial motivations (i. e., person-supervisor [PS] fit) is positively related to employees&# 039; organizational commitment (i. e., there is bipartite synergy between employees and supervisors&# 039; prosocial motivations). Perceived corporate social responsibility (CSR) moderates the relationship between employees&# 039; prosocial <b>motivations</b> <b>and</b> their organizational commitment such that when employees&# 039; prosocial <b>motivations</b> <b>and</b> perceived CSR are both high (as opposed to when either or both are low), their organizational commitment is stronger (i. e., there is bipartite synergy between employees&# 039; prosocial <b>motivations</b> <b>and</b> CSR). Furthermore, perceived CSR moderates the relationship between PS fit in relation to prosocial <b>motivations</b> <b>and</b> organizational commitment. Notably, organizational commitment is strongest when there is a strong alignment among employees&# 039; prosocial motivations, supervisors&# 039; prosocial <b>motivations,</b> <b>and</b> CSR (i. e., there is tripartite synergy among employees&# 039; prosocial motivations, supervisors&# 039; prosocial <b>motivations,</b> <b>and</b> CSR). The theoretical contributions and practical implications of this study are discussed...|$|R
40|$|The primary {{purposes}} of this study were to identify the perceived importance of <b>motivations</b> <b>and</b> activities for travel to a rural destination, and to determine whether these variables were influenced by the tourist’s place of residence. The study is based on an on-line survey completed by 1, 048 individuals. A series of independent t-tests were used to determine whether there were differences in the <b>motivations</b> <b>and</b> preferred activities of rural residents versus urban residents, while canonical correlation analysis revealed relationships between the two sets of variables (<b>motivations</b> <b>and</b> activities). Findings suggest that rural destinations appeal to both rural and urban residents. In some instances, differences with regards to the <b>motivations</b> <b>and</b> activity preferences of these two groups were identified. Correlations between the <b>motivations</b> <b>and</b> activity preferences of respondents also suggest that rural tourists are interested in activities that are aligned with their initial motivations for deciding to travel to a rural area...|$|R

5|$|A gas-station scene {{within the}} episode {{was meant to}} {{establish}} what the brothers and the series are about—bantering, credit card scams, and classic rock; Kripke feared {{that it would be}} cut because it was character-based and did not further the episode's plot. He also did not want the series to feature ballad music typical of The WB network, and forced the use of classic rock for the soundtrack by writing the music into the script. For the episode's villain, Kripke used the well-known urban legend of the vanishing hitchhiker, but combined it with the Mexican legend of La Llorona to give the spirit more <b>motivation</b> <b>and</b> characterization. The ghost was younger in an earlier version of script, and murdered her parents instead of her children; this was revised to allow for the casting of an older actress.|$|E
5|$|Before {{the start}} of the 2011–12 season, Neuner hinted the {{upcoming}} season might be her last. She began the winter in Östersund with the best season start of her career, beating Tora Berger by 0.2 seconds in the sprint to claim her 25th World Cup win. She also came third in the individual and the pursuit, and took the yellow bib of the Overall World Cup leader. On 6 December 2011, Neuner announced her retirement from biathlon {{by the end of the}} season on her homepage. She explained her early departure from the sport (at age 25) with a lack of <b>motivation</b> <b>and</b> her desire for a normal life. Neuner nonetheless continued her good form in Hochfilzen, where she claimed her 26th World Cup win in the sprint.|$|E
5|$|Billiard balls {{have been}} made from many {{different}} materials {{throughout the history of}} the game, including clay, wood, ivory, plastics (including celluloid, Bakelite, crystalate, and phenolic resin, polyester and acrylic) and even steel. The dominant material from 1627 until the early- to mid-20th century was ivory. The search for a substitute for ivory use was not for environmental concerns but based on economic <b>motivation</b> <b>and</b> fear of danger for elephant hunters. It was in part spurred on by a New York billiard table manufacturer who announced a prize of $10,000 for a substitute material. The first viable substitute was celluloid billiard balls, invented by John Wesley Hyatt in 1868, but the material was volatile and highly inflammable, sometimes exploding during manufacture.|$|E

Viewing rookie Will Middlebrooks as the superior third baseman, Valentine {{began to play}} Middlebrooks over Youkilis. The Red Sox traded Youkilis to the Chicago White Sox on June 24 for pitcher Zach Stewart and utility man Brent Lillibridge. The Red Sox agreed to pay $5.5 million of Youkilis' salary to help close the deal. In the seventh inning of that day's game, Ben Cherington, the Red Sox General Manager, informed Valentine that a transaction was pending. Youkilis hit a triple in his last at bat, and received a long standing ovation while tipping his helmet to the crowd after being taken out for pinch runner Nick Punto.|$|E

The American game publishing company TSR, Inc. released it as a standalone adventure booklet in 1983 {{for use with}} the first edition Advanced Dungeons & Dragons game. It was written by Tracy and Laura Hickman, and includes art by Clyde Caldwell with maps by David SutherlandIII. The plot of Ravenloft focuses on the villain Strahd von Zarovich, a vampire who pines for his lost love. Various story elements, including Strahd's <b>motivation</b> <b>and</b> the locations of magical weapons, are randomly determined by drawing cards. The player characters attempt to defeat Strahd and, if successful, the adventure ends.|$|E
40|$|Millennial {{generation}} {{students are}} a growing {{market for the}} travel and tourism industry, yet tourism marketers lack research regarding travel habits <b>and</b> <b>motivations</b> for them. As a result, the travel and leisure industry {{have not been able}} to capitalize on this revenue stream. The purpose of this study was to explore the beliefs, <b>motivations,</b> <b>and</b> attitudes that millennial generation students have about the benefits of travel and leisure. Topics for the literature review included <b>motivations</b> <b>and</b> attitudes, and qualitative research. Essays on <b>motivations</b> <b>and</b> beliefs of travel and leisure were assigned in fall 2009 to the RPTA 214 class and submitted electronically over Blackboard. Of the original 22 essays 12 were randomly selected and converted into a master copy to eliminate names. The researcher analyzed the data qualitatively by scanning for word usage and context. The results indicated that the major beliefs, <b>motivations,</b> <b>and</b> attitudes for millennial generation students were: the whole experience, education, freedom, and personal growth. These findings can be used by the travel and leisure industry to better target the millennial generation college students...|$|R

30|$|It {{is clear}} that consumers’ choice and {{behavior}} are impacted by their <b>motivations</b> <b>and</b> intentions and consumers {{are assumed to be}} rational. Therefore, some irrational behavior of consumers can be explained by different <b>motivations</b> <b>and</b> intentions.

If the consumers have highly borrowing behavior with high interest rates offer, they may be high-risk borrowers and banks may face an adverse selection problem.|$|R
5|$|Several {{recent studies}} have shown that adding seductive details does not have a {{significant}} impact on learner outcomes. Park et al. (2011) looked at cognitive load theory to explain these controversial results. The experiment asked high school students to learn about biology using a multimedia environment (one with seductive details and one without). The experiment also varied the cognitive load for the students. The results showed that students performed significantly higher when seductive details were present in a low cognitive load environment as compared with all other conditions. Another study by Park et al. (2015) showed that while seductive details were detrimental to learning in high cognitive load text conditions, seductive details actually improved <b>motivation</b> <b>and</b> learning outcomes in narration conditions where the cognitive load was low. This means that slideshows or webcasts with well-prepared narration that use motivating bits of information increase learner motivation.|$|E

40|$|Previous {{research}} {{has suggested that}} the experience of studying law reorients students toward external, extrinsic <b>motivations</b> <b>and</b> objectives, and that this orientation contributes to the high rates of psychological distress among law students. This article offers support for that thesis as well as further insight into the associations between law students’ <b>motivations,</b> academic expectations <b>and</b> levels of psychological distress. Findings from two empirical studies of students’ <b>motivations</b> <b>and</b> expectations are compared in order to identify changes that may be a result of the experience of studying law. The first study investigated the <b>motivations</b> <b>and</b> expectations of commencing students in an LLB and a JD program. The second study investigated the <b>motivations</b> <b>and</b> expectations of LLB and JD students at a point in the degree when most students would have completed at least five law subjects. The second study also assessed students’ levels of psychological distress. Although not a longitudinal study, the data point to possible differences between the <b>motivations</b> <b>and</b> expectations of commencing law students and students later in their degree. Specifically, experienced students were more likely to cite non-Intrinsic reasons for studying law and also more likely to expect their results to be in the top one-third of their cohort. Further research into these factors is suggested to test whether they are contributing to law students’ psychological distress...|$|R
