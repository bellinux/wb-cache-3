Present study {{is aimed at}} determining anatomy of sacrum specially sacral hiatus for caudal epidural block, {{with the help of}} morphometric measurements of the sacrum in relation to sacral hiatus in dry sacral bones. Material & method: Total 103 complete and undamaged adult, dry sacral bones were measured with Vernier caliper (accuracy 0. 1 mm) and anatomical measurements were obtained. Results: Three bones were excluded because of total posterior closure defect. Agenesis of the sacral hiatus was detected in three sacral bones. Right and left superolateral <b>sacral</b> <b>crests</b> of the sacrum were taken as two points on dorsal surface of sacrum (forming the base of a triangle) because posterior superior iliac spines impose on the superolateral <b>sacral</b> <b>crests.</b> The distance between the two superolateral <b>sacral</b> <b>crests</b> (base of a triangle), the distances between the right and left superolateral <b>sacral</b> <b>crest</b> and the <b>sacral</b> apex were on average 60. 61 (SD 6. 71), 61. 95 (11. 71) and 61. 4 (11. 98) mm respectively [...] Summary: An equilateral triangle formed between the apex of the sacral hiatus and right and left superolateral <b>sacral</b> <b>crests.</b> This equilateral triangle will help in determining the location of the sacral hiatus during caudal epidural block.

40|$|The {{accuracy}} {{of a single}} fat thickness measurement at each of five carcass sites and at the 10 th and 12 th ribs in estimating side fat weight and side fat percentage was determined in 36 steer carcasses. Three sites {{were associated with the}} fat layers of the split brisket, one was located at the caudodorsal angle of M. biceps femoris and one was situated 3. 0 cm lateral to the highest point of the <b>sacral</b> <b>crest.</b> All three brisket sites were poor predictors of side fat weight and side fat percentage. The other four sites were of approximately equal accuracy in predicting side fat percentage, with residual standard deviations of: M. biceps femoris, 2. 81 %; <b>sacral</b> <b>crest,</b> 3. 07 %; 10 th rib, 3. 12 %; and 12 th rib, 2. 81 %. Side fat weight was predicted less accurately by M. biceps femoris (5. 42 kg) than by <b>sacral</b> <b>crest</b> (4. 50 kg), 10 th rib (4. 98 kg) or 12 th rib (4. 94 kg). Chilled side weight was a valuable addition in multiple regression analyses, significantly improving the residual standard deviations of all four sites, especially M, biceps femoris, in predicting side fat weight (M. biceps femoris, 1. 56 kg; <b>sacral</b> <b>crest,</b> 3. 54 kg; 10 th rib, 3. 31 kg; 12 th rib, 2. 84 kg). Only in the case of M. biceps femoris did the addition of chilled side weight improve the {{accuracy of}} prediction of side fat percentage (residual standard devation = 1. 75 %). The reliability of the seven sites in accurately measuring fat thickness was determined in 3215 dressed carcasses in six abattoirs. <b>Sacral</b> <b>crest</b> was clearly the most useful site.

A frequent problem in this is needle placement as {{it is difficult to}} determine the location of sacral hiatus. The knowledge of anatomy of sacral hiatus plays a major role in the success of needle placement. Aim: To study the anatomy of sacral hiatus from point of view of caudal epidural anesthesia. Materials and Methods: The sacral hiatus of 300 sacra was studied. Parameters of sacral hiatus such as shape, level of apex and base, length, anteroposterior (AP) diameter at apex, and intercornual distance along with distance between superolateral <b>sacral</b> <b>crests</b> and their distance from apex of sacral hiatus were studied. Results: Inverted "U" shape (46. 33 %) was most commonly encountered. Apex and base of the hiatus were most commonly seen at the level of S 4 and S 5 respectively. Length of sacral hiatus ranged between 8. 8 mm and 45. 7 mm. AP diameter at apex of sacra and intercornual distance were seen most commonly in the range 4 – 6 mm and 11 – 15 mm respectively. Conclusion: The study of these sacra indicated the type of variations in shape and size of sacral hiatus in population of state of Maharashtra in India. While absent sacral hiatus leads to poor outcome of the caudal epidural anesthesia, dorsal agenesis of the sacrum would lead to only partial anesthesia. The formation of equilateral triangle by joining superolateral <b>sacral</b> <b>crests</b> and apex of sacral hiatus forms a practical guide in locating sacral hiatus for caudal epidural anesthesia...|$|R

30|$|The {{reported}} {{prevalence of}} ARA ranges from 12 to 49 % [1, 2]. The problems {{most likely to}} occur during EVAR for AAA with ARA are renal infarction caused by ARA obstruction and type II endoleaks from ARA blood flow. As ARA coverage {{has been reported to}} increase risk of renal infarction, with reported rates ranging from 0 to 84 %, ARA reconstruction procedures have been devised using fenestrated stentgrafts, branched stentgrafts, or debranching [7 – 9]. Yet some believe that the reconstruction of ARA is unnecessary since it offers no significant benefit in terms of eGFR or blood pressure control [3 – 6]. Type II endoleak occurs from the lumbar artery, inferior mesenteric artery (IMA), <b>median</b> <b>sacral</b> artery, and accessory renal artery (ARA). These branches act as inflow or outflow depending on the pressure gradient between the aorta and each branch. When a renal artery is covered with a stentgraft, the pressure on the kidney parenchyma is decreased. Yet covering the ARA while leaving the renal artery uncovered would result in high pressure, and the ARA would act as inflow. Therefore, ARA larger than 3  mm has been reported as a potential cause of type II endoleak [5]. Because of this, prophylactic ARA coil embolization for ARAs larger than 3  mm is effective for reduction of type II endoleak. In general, routine embolization for lumbar artery, IMA, and <b>median</b> <b>sacral</b> artery is not recommended. In our case, we did not embolize any of these branches.|$|R

In order to label premigratory <b>sacral</b> neural <b>crest</b> cells selectively, DiI was injected into the lumen of the neural tube {{at the level of}} the hindlimb. In chick embryos, DiI injections made prior to stage 19 resulted in labelled cells in the gut, which had emerged from the neural tube adjacent to somites 29 – 37. In mouse embryos, neural crest cells emigrated from the sacral neural tube between E 9 and E 9. 5. In both chick and mouse embryos, DiI-labelled cells were observed in the rostral half of the somitic sclerotome, around the dorsal aorta, in the mesentery surrounding the gut, as well as within the epithelium of the gut. Mouse embryos, however, contained consistently fewer labelled cells than chick embryos. DiI-labelled cells first were observed in the rostral and dorsal portion of the gut. Paralleling the maturation of the embryo, there was a rostral-to-caudal sequence in which neural crest cells populated the gut at the sacral level. In addition, neural crest cells appeared within the gut in a dorsal-to-ventral sequence, suggesting that the cells entered the gut dorsally and moved progressively ventrally. The present results resolve a long-standing discrepancy in the literature by demonstrating that <b>sacral</b> neural <b>crest</b> cells in both the chick and mouse contribute to the enteric nervous system in the postumbilical gut...|$|R

40|$|Background: The {{reliability}} {{and success of}} caudal epidural anesthesia depends on anatomic variations of sacral hiatus (SH) as observed by various authors. SH is an important landmark during caudal epidural block (CEB). The {{purpose of the present}} study was to clarify the morphometric characteristics of the SH in human Egyptian dry sacra and pelvic radiographs and identification of nearest ony landmarks to permit correct and uncomplicated caudal epidural accesses. Methods: The present study was done on 46 human adult Egyptian dry sacra. The maximum height, midventral curved length, and maximum breadth of each sacrum were measured and sacral and curvature indices were calculated. According to sacral indices, sacra were divided into 2 groups (22 male and 24 female sacra). SH was evaluated in each sacrum according to its shape, level of its apex, and base according to sacral and coccygeal vertebrae, length, anteroposterior (AP) diameter at its apex, and transverse width at its base. Linear distances were measured between the apex of SH and second sacral foramina, right and left superolateral <b>sacral</b> <b>crests.</b> The distance between the 2 superolateral <b>sacral</b> <b>crests</b> also was measured. Results: The most common types of SH were the inverted U and inverted V (in male) and inverted V and dumbbell shaped (in female). Absent SH was observed in male group only. The most common location of SH apex was at the level of S 4 in all groups of dry sacra and S 3 in all groups of lumbosacral spine radiographs, whereas S 5 was the common level of its base. The mean SH length, transverse width of its base, and AP diameter of its apex were 2. 1 ± 0. 80, 1. 7 ± 0. 26, and 0. 48 ± 0. 19 cm. Female sacra showed narrower SH apex than male. The distance between the S 2 foramen and the apex of the SH was 4. 1 ± 1. 14, 3. 67 ± 1. 21, and 4. 48 ± 1. 01 cm in total, female and male sacra, respectively. Conclusion: Sacrum and SH showed morphometric variations in adult Egyptians. The equilateral triangle is an important guide to detect SH easily and increases the success rate of CEB. Insertion of a needle into the SH for caudal block is suggested to be done at its base to avoid the anatomic variations of its apex...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe enteric {{nervous system}} (ENS) {{arises from the}} coordinated migration, {{expansion}} and differentiation of vagal and <b>sacral</b> neural <b>crest</b> progenitor cells. During development, vagal neural crest cells enter the foregut and migrate in a rostro-to-caudal direction, colonizing the entire gastrointestinal tract and generating {{the majority of the}} ENS. <b>Sacral</b> neural <b>crest</b> contributes to a subset of enteric ganglia in the hindgut, colonizing the colon in a caudal-to-rostral wave. During this process, enteric neural crest-derived progenitors (ENPs) self-renew and begin expressing markers of neural and glial lineages as they populate the intestine. Our earlier work demonstrated that the transcription factor Foxd 3 is required early in neural crest-derived progenitors for self-renewal, multipotency and establishment of multiple neural crest-derived cells and structures including the ENS. Here, we describe Foxd 3 expression within the fetal and postnatal intestine: Foxd 3 was strongly expressed in ENPs as they colonize the gastrointestinal tract and was progressively restricted to enteric glial cells. Using a novel Ednrb-iCre transgene to delete Foxd 3 after vagal neural crest cells migrate into the midgut, we demonstrated a late temporal requirement for Foxd 3 during ENS development. Lineage labeling of Ednrb-iCre expressing cells in Foxd 3 mutant embryos revealed a reduction of ENPs throughout the gut and loss of Ednrb-iCre lineage cells in the distal colon. Although mutant mice were viable, defects in patterning and distribution of ENPs were associated with reduced proliferation and severe reduction of glial cells derived from the Ednrb-iCre lineage. Analyses of ENS-lineage and differentiation in mutant embryos suggested activation of a compensatory population of Foxd 3 -positive ENPs that did not express the Ednrb-iCre transgene. Our findings highlight the crucial roles played by Foxd 3 during ENS development including progenitor proliferation, neural patterning, and glial differentiation and may help delineate distinct molecular programs controlling vagal versus <b>sacral</b> neural <b>crest</b> development...|$|R

Rump P 8 predicted saleable beef yield weight, saleable beef yield percentage, fat trim weight and fat trim percentage with means (¦ s. e.) of 72. 55 (¦ 6. 69) kg, 70. 52 (¦ 0. 72) %, 7. 23 (¦ 0. 86) kg and 6. 99 (¦ 0. 68) %, respectively. Multiple regression analysis showed that the addition of hot carcass weight or cold carcass weight as the second regressor resulted in predictions of similar accuracy. Quadratic analyses indicated that weight or percentage of cuts, manufacturing trim, saleable beef yield and fat trim were linearly related to 12 th rib (cold) fat thickness and to P 8 fat thickness...|$|R
40|$|Objective: The aim of {{this study}} was to analyse the optimal trajectories for sacral alar iliac screws (SAISs) in a Japanese patient {{population}} and the clinical assessment of insertion accuracies. Methods: The ideal trajectories of SAISs, starting from 2  mm medial to the apex of the lateral <b>sacral</b> <b>crest</b> on the midline between S 1 and S 2 dorsal foramina, were measured in 80 consecutive spinal disease patients (40 males and 40 females; average age: 67. 4  ±  8. 1 years) using three-dimensional computed tomographic image software. Following these anatomic analyses, accuracies of 32 inserted SAISs in consecutive patients, who underwent long spinal posterior fusion, were investigated clinically. Results: Lateral angulations of optimal SAIS trajectories in males (left: 37. 9; right: 37. 7) were significantly larger than those than in females (left: 32. 8; right: 32. 4). Caudal SAIS angulations for females (left: 33. 4; right: 33. 9) were significantly larger than those in males (left: 27. 5; right: 28. 0). The 32 SAISs (100  mm long and 9  mm in diameter) assessed clinically were accurately inserted on optimal trajectories. Conclusion: The optimal trajectories of SAISs in a Japanese patient population are more lateral in males and more caudal in females. This study examines the clinical safety and accuracy of SAIS insertion on these optimal trajectories...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe vagal {{neural crest}} is {{the origin of}} {{majority}} of neurons and glia that constitute the enteric nervous system, the intrinsic innervation of the gut. We have recently confirmed that a second region of the neuraxis, the <b>sacral</b> neural <b>crest,</b> also contributes to the enteric neuronal and glial populations of both the myenteric and the submucosal plexuses in the chick, caudal {{to the level of}} the umbilicus. Results from this previous study showed that sacral neural crest-derived precursors colonised the gut in significant numbers only 4 days after vagal-derived cells had completed their migration along the entire length of the gut. This observation suggested that in order to migrate into the hindgut and differentiate into enteric neurons and glia, <b>sacral</b> neural <b>crest</b> cells may require an interaction with vagal-derived cells or with factors or signalling molecules released by them or their progeny. This interdependence may also explain the inability of <b>sacral</b> neural <b>crest</b> cells to compensate for the lack of ganglia in the terminal hindgut of Hirschsprung's disease in humans or aganglionic megacolon in animals. To investigate the possible interrelationship between sacral and vagal-derived neural crest cells within the hindgut, we mapped the contribution of various vagal neural crest regions to the gut and then ablated appropriate sections of chick vagal neural crest to interrupt the migration of enteric nervous system precursor cells and thus create an aganglionic hindgut model in vivo. In these same ablated animals, the sacral level neural axis was removed and replaced with the equivalent tissue from quail embryos, thus enabling us to document, using cell-specific antibodies, the migration and differentiation of sacral crest-derived cells. Results showed that the vagal neural crest contributed precursors to the enteric nervous system in a regionalised manner. When quail–chick grafts of the neural tube adjacent to somites 1 – 2 were performed, neural crest cells were found in enteric ganglia throughout the preumbilical gut. These cells were most numerous in the esophagus, sparse in the preumbilical intestine, and absent in the postumbilical gut. When similar grafts adjacent to somites 3 – 5 or 3 – 6 were carried out, crest cells were found within enteric ganglia along the entire gut, from the proximal esophagus to the distal colon. Vagal neural crest grafts adjacent to somites 6 – 7 showed that crest cells from this region were distributed along a caudal–rostral gradient, being most numerous in the hindgut, less so in the intestine, and absent in the proximal foregut. In order to generate aneural hindgut in vivo, it was necessary to ablate the vagal neural crest adjacent to somites 3 – 6, prior to the 13 -somite stage of development. When such ablations were performed, the hindgut, and in some cases also the cecal region, lacked enteric ganglionated plexuses. <b>Sacral</b> neural <b>crest</b> grafting in these vagal neural crest ablated chicks showed that sacral cells migrated along normal, previously described hindgut pathways and formed isolated ganglia containing neurons and glia at the levels of the presumptive myenteric and submucosal plexuses. Comparison between vagal neural crest-ablated and nonablated control animals demonstrated that sacral-derived cells migrated into the gut and differentiated into neurons in higher numbers in the ablated animals than in controls. However, the increase in numbers of sacral neural crest-derived neurons within the hindgut did not appear to be sufficiently high to compensate for the lack of vagal-derived enteric plexuses, as ganglia containing sacral neural crest-derived neurons and glia were small and infrequent. Our findings suggest that the neuronal fate of a relatively fixed subpopulation of <b>sacral</b> neural <b>crest</b> cells may be predetermined as these cells neither require the presence of vagal-derived enteric precursors in order to colonise the hindgut, nor are capable of dramatically altering their proliferation or differentiation...|$|R
40|$|The {{anatomy of}} the arteries on the anterolateral {{surfaces}} of the lower two lumbar vertebral bodies has been described in 100 living subjects, using radiographs obtained at aortography. The classic description of this anatomy is commonly correct in the young subject. In addition, a precostal anastomosis was seen in 5 out of 7 subjects aged 10 years or younger. Distortion of this pattern was seen in older subjects; most of this distortion was due to degenerative disease. The average number of observed arteries around the fifth lumbar vertebral body declined steadily in decennial age groups over 30 years, but {{a statistically significant difference}} could not be found between the categories of indications for aortography, nor between those judged grossly atherosclerotic and those not so judged as a result of aortography. The precostal anastomosis is an important collateral supply in some older subjects with arterial disease. In addition, a common artery of origin for the fourth lumbar arteries was observed in 15 subjects, and an origin from the <b>median</b> <b>sacral</b> artery for the fourth lumbar arteries was observed in two subjects. These features have not previously been described in healthy subjects...|$|R
40|$|The radiologic {{anatomy of}} the aortic {{bifurcation}} in the rabbit has received little study {{but it is important}} as this anatomical area is widely used in atherosclerosis research. Thirty rabbits were used to study the aortic bifurcation and subsequent branching patterns on arteriography. Fifteen different arteries were identified. Mean arterial diameters of 2. 88 ± 0. 7 and 2. 27 ± 0. 55 mm were obtained for the aorta and external iliac arteries, respectively. The cranial and middle aspects at the seventh lumbar vertebra (L 7) were the most frequent anatomical landmarks (53. 3 % of the cases) for aortic and common iliac bifurcations, respectively. The caudal aspect of L 6 was the most frequent origin (50 % of the cases) for the <b>median</b> <b>sacral</b> artery. Deep circumflex iliac arteries originated from common iliac arteries and not the abdominal aorta in the rabbit, showing anatomical asymmetry in 73. 3 % of the cases. No gender disparity was found in the anatomical location of any of the arteries of the study. Knowledge of normal vascular landmarks for the aortic bifurcation as well as anatomical variations should be helpful to future experimental studies...|$|R
40|$|Multiple {{variations}} {{were found}} in a 54 -year-old male cadaver during routine dissections of abdominal retroperitoneal region. Right inferior phrenic artery was arising from right renal artery, while the right middle and superior suprarenal artery branched from the right inferior phrenic artery. Left inferior phrenic artery was originating from the abdominal aorta below celiac trunk. The left middle suprarenal artery appeared as the branch of celiac trunk. Double left renal artery was arising separately {{from the left side}} of the aorta. The upper left renal artery showed approximately 80 º of kinking which then crossed the lower one and entered to the inferior pole of hilum of kidney. Left testicular artery was originating from the upper left renal artery after this kinking. The left and right fourth lumbar arteries and <b>median</b> <b>sacral</b> artery have branched from a common trunk posterior to the abdominal aorta. In spite of these abundant variations in the branches, abdominal aorta itself did not show any variation, spanning normally between the levels of T 12 –L 4 vertebrae. The variations of abdominal aorta may have clinical importance, especially in surgical and radiologic investigations...|$|R
40|$|Image-guided sensory {{block and}} {{radiofrequency}} ablation of the nerves innervating the sacro-iliac joint require readily identifiable bony landmarks for accurate needle/electrode placement. Understanding the relative {{locations of the}} transverse sacral tubercles along the lateral <b>sacral</b> <b>crest</b> is important for ultrasound guidance, as they demarcate {{the position of the}} posterior sacral network (S 1 –S 3 ± L 5 /S 4) innervating the posterior sacro-iliac joint. No studies were found that investigated the spatial relationships of these bony landmarks. The {{purpose of this study was}} to visualize and quantify the interrelationships of the transverse sacral tubercles and posterior sacral foramina to inform image-guided block and radiofrequency ablation of the sacro-iliac joint. The posterior and lateral surfaces of 30 dry sacra (15 [*]M/ 15 [*]F) were digitized and modeled in 3 D and the distances between bony landmarks quantified. The relationships of bony landmarks (S 1 –S 4) were not uniform. The mean intertubercular and interforaminal distances decreased from S 1 to S 4, whereas the distance from the lateral margin of the posterior sacral foramina to the transverse sacral tubercles increased from S 1 to S 3. The mean intertubercular distance from S 1 to S 3 was significantly (p< 0. 05) larger in males. The interrelationships of the sacral bony landmarks should be taken into consideration when estimating the site and length of an image-guided strip lesion targeting the posterior sacral network...|$|R
40|$|Tamandua tetradactyla, Xenarthra, is {{a native}} species from South America which, due to the few number of studies on its biology, still has many unknown aspects in its morphology. Taking into account the {{importance}} of morphological data for various studies, this paper aimed to elucidate the branching of the abdominal aorta in this species to foster the development of further studies. To do this, 4 specimens were used, 2 male and 2 female, all young, from the Bauxite Mine – Paragominas, Para, Brazil, donated after death due to running over to the Animal Morphology Research Laboratory (LaPMA) of Universidade Federal Rural da Amazonia (UFRA). The arterial system was filled with contrasted latex and the animals were fixed in a formaldehyde solution (10 %), and then dissected, in order to evidence the abdominal aorta and its collateral branches. The parietal branches consisted of 1 pair of caudal phrenic arteries, 2 pairs of intercostal arteries, and 3 pairs of lumbar arteries. Among the visceral branches, stood out: celiac artery; cranial mesenteric artery; adrenal arteries; renal arteries; caudal mesenteric artery; and external, internal, and <b>median</b> <b>sacral</b> iliac arteries, formed from the final portion of the abdominal aorta. Testicular and ovarian arteries originated from the renal arteries, differing from that described in various species...|$|R
40|$|URL] The genus Aotus {{is found}} in South America and {{is known for its}} nocturnal habit. The {{morphology}} of the genus is poorly understood even though it is used in biomedical research. The objective {{of this study was to}} identify the collateral branches of the abdominal aorta of two females and one male Aotus azarae infulatus (commonly known as the night monkey). The vessels were observed and stained with Neoprene latex and radiopaque contrast. The animals were fixed in an aqueous solution of 10 % formaldehyde via intramuscular and intracavitary routes, dissected and radiographed. It was observed that the celiac artery was divided into three subjacent branches, the gastric, hepatic and splenic arteries. The left and right renal arteries originated from a common trunk in two animals (animals 1 and 2), while the adrenal artery in one of the animals was derived from the celiac trunk and renal artery (animal 2). In one animal the mesenteric artery flow gave rise to individual cranial rectal, sigmoid and left colic arteries (animal 3). In the three animals the abdominal aorta bifurcated in the final portion of the abdomen, with the external and internal iliac artery on each side, and then the <b>median</b> <b>sacral</b> artery. These anatomical variations need to be identified and reported because these animals are frequently used in clinical and surgical, veterinary practices...|$|R
