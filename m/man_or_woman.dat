5|$|The 2012 French Open Men's singles final was the {{championship}} tennis match of the Men's Singles tournament at the 2012 French Open. It pitted the world's top two players, Novak Djokovic and Rafael Nadal, {{against each other}} in a Grand Slam tournament final for the fifth time overall and fourth consecutive time. This match had historical proportions as Djokovic would have become the first man since Rod Laver in 1969 to win all four Majors simultaneously, whereas Nadal was looking to break Björn Borg's record of six French Open titles and equal Chris Evert's record of seven French Open titles held by a <b>man</b> <b>or</b> <b>woman.</b>|$|E
5|$|As {{the term}} double burden might suggest, when people {{consider}} paid work vs. unpaid work, they often consider them as two separate entities - that the <b>man</b> <b>or</b> <b>woman</b> is doing {{one or the}} other, {{but not at the}} same time. In reality, men and especially women often undertake both paid and unpaid labor simultaneously, creating the issue of work intensity, where the person undertakes many activities {{at the same time in}} order to compensate for the time necessary to accomplish many things in one day. Household surveys often only let people write down one thing that they are doing at any given time, and do not take into consideration that they may be cooking while cleaning, or sewing while taking care of the children. Because of this, the time taken for child care and other domestic activities may be underestimated. This coping mechanism of undertaking two or more tasks at once can especially be seen in women in developing countries. For example, many Caribbean rural women use this as a method of increasing the number of things they can accomplish in a day.|$|E

25|$|The Defense of Marriage Act did {{not provide}} a legal {{definition}} of <b>man</b> <b>or</b> <b>woman.</b> Until 2002, USCIS tended to recognize marriages that included a transgender partner if those marriages were considered valid in the jurisdiction where the marriage was established. Beginning in 2002, USCIS rejected all applications of couples in which one partner was transgender, which became formal policy in 2004. Later that year, the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) rejected the policy in a non-precedential decision.|$|E

25|$|Leaving Islam {{is a sin}} and a {{religious}} crime.

Before executing the death penalty, sharia demands that the individual be offered one chance to return to Islam.|$|E
25|$|The 16th century Swedish writer Olaus Magnus {{says that}} the Livonian werewolves were {{initiated}} by draining a cup of specially prepared beer and repeating a set formula.

25|$|Some {{texts of}} the Abhidharma state that a paṇḍaka cannot achieve {{enlightenment}} in their own lifetime, but must wait for reincarnation as a <b>man</b> <b>or</b> <b>woman.</b> Ananda — Buddha's cousin and disciple — {{was said to be}} a paṇḍaka in one of his many previous lives, as was the Buddhist nun Isidāsī (from the Therigatha). In both cases birth as a paṇḍaka was a result of poor karma, and the idea that being a paṇḍaka stems from bad behaviour in a previous life is common in Buddhist literature. Asanga and Vasubandhu discussed if a pandaka was able to be enlightened or not.|$|E

25|$|Blasphemy in Islam is impious {{utterance}} or action concerning God, Muhammad {{or anything}} considered sacred in Islam. The Quran admonishes blasphemy, {{but does not}} specify any worldly punishment for it. The hadiths, which are another source of Sharia, suggest various punishments for blasphemy, which may include death. There {{are a number of}} surah in Qur'an relating to blasphemy, from which Quranic verses 5:33 and 33:57-61 have been most commonly used in Islamic history to justify and punish blasphemers. Various fiqhs (schools of jurisprudence) of Islam have different punishment for blasphemy, depending on whether blasphemer is Muslim or non-Muslim, <b>man</b> <b>or</b> <b>woman.</b> The punishment can be fines, imprisonment, flogging, amputation, hanging, or beheading.|$|E
25|$|It {{was first}} envisaged {{that the pilot}} could be any <b>man</b> <b>or</b> <b>woman</b> {{willing to take a}} {{personal}} risk. However, the first Americans to venture into space were drawn, on President Eisenhower's insistence, from a group of 508 active duty military test pilots, who were either USN or USMC naval aviation pilots (NAPs), or USAF pilots of Senior or Command rating. This excluded women, since there were no female military test pilots at the time. It also excluded civilian NASA X-15 pilot Neil Armstrong, though he had been selected by the U.S. Air Force in 1958 for its Man In Space Soonest program, which was replaced by Mercury. Although Armstrong had been a combat-experienced NAP during the Korean War, he left active duty in 1952. Armstrong became NASA's first civilian astronaut in 1962 when he was selected for NASA's second group, and became the first man on the Moon in 1969.|$|E
25|$|Yom Kippur is {{considered}} {{to be the most important}} day of the Jewish year-cycle and fasting as a means of repentance is expected of every Jewish <b>man</b> <b>or</b> <b>woman</b> above the age of bar mitzvah and bat mitzvah respectively. This is the only fast day mentioned in the Torah (Leviticus 23:26-32). It is so important to fast on this day, that only those who would be put in mortal danger by fasting are exempt, such as the ill or frail (endangering a life is against a core principle of Judaism). Those that do eat on this day are encouraged to eat as little as possible at a time and to avoid a full meal. For some, fasting on Yom Kippur {{is considered}} more important than the prayers of this holy day. If one fasts, even if one is at home in bed, one is considered as having participated in the full religious service.|$|E
