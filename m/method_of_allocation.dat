25|$|ABO-incompatible (ABOi) {{transplantation}} is a <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>allocation</b> in {{organ transplantation}} that permits more {{efficient use of}} available organs regardless of ABO blood type, which would otherwise be unavailable due to hyperacute rejection. Primarily in use in infants and young toddlers, research is ongoing to allow for increased use of this capability in adult transplants. Normal ABO-compatibility rules may be observed for all recipients. This means that anyone may receive a transplant of a type-O organ, and consequently, type-O recipients {{are one of the}} biggest beneficiaries of ABO-incompatible transplants. While focus has been on infant heart transplants, the principles generally apply to other forms of solid organ transplantation.|$|E

40|$|This study assesses 12 {{types of}} project {{overhead}} costs, 6 <b>methods</b> <b>of</b> <b>allocation</b> and 15 factors which affect project overhead costs in South-South of Nigeria. The {{objective is to}} compare small and medium contractors’ perception <b>of</b> the <b>methods</b> <b>of</b> <b>allocation,</b> factors affecting project overhead costs {{and the effect of}} the types of project overhead costs on cost, time and quality of the projects. Data were obtained through 501 structured questionnaires administered to small and medium contractors and analysed using mean item score, and Mann-Whitney U test. The results reveal that contractors perceive that supervision costs, cost of rework, equipment management costs, general field expenses, and temporary works costs were prominent overheads affecting cost, time, and quality performance of projects. There is no difference in the contractors’ perceptions of issues affecting overhead costs. It is recommended that contractors should give adequate priority to significant project overheads and their influencing factors...|$|R

5000|$|In {{determining}} the profits (net income) from an activity, the receipts from the activity must {{be reduced by}} appropriate costs.

[...] Such cost so allocated in a given period is equal to the reduction in the value placed on the asset, which is initially equal to the amount paid for the asset and subsequently {{may or may not be}} related to the amount expected to be received upon its disposal. Depreciation is any method of allocating such net cost to those periods in which the organization is expected to benefit from use of the asset. The asset is referred to as a depreciable asset. Depreciation is technically a <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>allocation,</b> not valuation, even though it determines the value placed on the asset in the balance sheet.|$|E

In simple interest situations, the possibilities are (1) apply a payment first to interest, then to principal; (2) apply a payment first to principal, then to interest; (3) apply a payment first to the current month's obligation, then to interest, then to principal. There is fourth payment allocation description in use in some states (e.g. California Code of Civil Procedure Section 695.221, effective January 1, 2009) which calls for payment [...] "first to current month, then to principal, then to interest." [...] In fact, however, this <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>allocation</b> is mathematically the same as method #2 above - first to principal, then to interest - for the reason the current month's obligation becomes part of the principal immediately upon falling due.|$|E
