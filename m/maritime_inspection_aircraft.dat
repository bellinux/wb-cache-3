This paper {{is concerned with}} automated flight of fixed-wing <b>inspection</b> <b>aircraft</b> to track approximately linear infrastructure. We propose a guidance law approach that seeks to maintain aircraft trajectories with desirable position and orientation properties relative to the infrastructure under inspection.

We employ an integrated design methodology particularly suited for an automated <b>inspection</b> <b>aircraft.</b> Simulation studies using full nonlinear semi-coupled six degree-of-freedom equations of motion are used to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed guidance and adaptive maneuver selection approaches in realistic flight conditions.

40|$|Safety and {{availability}} of ageing infrastructures require periodic or continuous monitoring of the structure's integrity. Innovative design criteria for new infrastructure components may allow material and energy conservation if components are continuously monitored by using advanced sensor systems. This concept for recurring Structural Health Monitoring will replace {{a significant part of}} conventional NDE by new maintenance concepts. The goal consists in sensor networks based on advanced principles of testing technology with integrated signal/data processing and data communication. NDE modeling is required for the quantification of measurement results. Finally, a decision on the integrity of the structure based on sensor results requires detailed knowledge about material behavior and modeling capacity for materials and components. IZFP has developed sensor concepts for complex solutions applicable to Structural Health Monitoring for different applications. These applications include railroad <b>inspection,</b> <b>aircraft</b> <b>inspection,</b> inspection of wind energy systems, power electric switches and micro gas valves.
