6000|$|Back of {{this room}} were some small bed rooms, and what {{interested}} me much, a staircase leading up into a dark garret. I could not but fancy I saw a bright-eyed, curly-headed boy creeping up those stairs, zealous to explore the mysteries of that dark garret. There perhaps he saw the cat, with [...] "eyne of burning coal, crouching 'fore the mouse's hole." [...] Doubtless in this old garret were wonderful mysteries to him, curious stores of old cast-off goods and furniture, and rats, and mice, and cobwebs. I fancied the indignation of some belligerent grandmother or aunt, who finds Willie up there watching a <b>mouse</b> <b>hole,</b> with the cat, and has him down straightway, grumbling that Mary did not govern that child better.|$|E

50|$|Tom's {{pursuit of}} Jerry circles around {{a room and}} back to Jerry's <b>mouse</b> <b>hole.</b> Tom is moving so fast, he runs into the wall and turns into a four-legged stool. Tom {{attempts}} to cut off a 4×4 area of the wall with Jerry's <b>mouse</b> <b>hole</b> in {{it in order to}} reach the mouse, but instead, the rest of the wall falls—on him.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, at any rate, {{you managed}} uncommonly well, Ryan, {{whether it was}} martial ardour that {{animated}} you or not; and O'Grady was not far wrong {{when he said that}} you and O'Connor would creep out through a <b>mouse's</b> <b>hole,</b> if {{there was no other way}} of doing it." ...|$|R
50|$|Designed {{for urban}} warfare where a {{projectile}} {{heavier than the}} HEDP AT4 is needed. This projectile combines a HEAT warhead with a shallow cone, which results in low penetration but produces a wide hole, with a follow-through high-blast warhead. It has two settings: one for destroying bunkers and one for <b>mouse</b> <b>holing</b> a building wall for combat entry.|$|R
60|$|The client, {{with his}} dejection insensibly {{relieved}} and his vague hopes rekindled, takes {{pen and ink}} and writes the draft, not without perplexed consideration and calculation of the date it may bear, implying scant effects in the agent's hands. All the while, Vholes, buttoned up in body and mind, looks at him attentively. All the while, Vholes's official cat watches the <b>mouse's</b> <b>hole.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Energy (Par 5): A two-part hole which {{consists}} of a giant computer on the lower level and a field of false holes surrounding the real hole on the top level. To complete the level, the player must hit two buttons on the giant computer, then shoot into a suction tube {{that leads to the}} top level. Alternatively, there is a <b>mouse</b> <b>hole</b> on the bottom level which is either empty, shows white eyes, or very rarely shows red eyes if both buttons have been hit. If a ball is shot into the <b>mouse</b> <b>hole</b> while the red eyes are displayed, that player completes the level automatically and the secret level is activated (see next hole below). At any other time, the ball is pushed out of the hole and the shot may be re-attempted. In a multiplayer game, only one player needs to successfully enter the <b>mouse</b> <b>hole.</b> Any other surviving players that use the regular hole are also allowed to proceed to the Mystery hole.|$|E

5000|$|Tom then gives Jerry a {{piece of}} cheese, but Jerry doesn't want it and throws it away. It lands in an egg cup on the shelf, which rolls and knocks a dish, which rolls into a laundry basket and into the broom. The broom falls over and {{releases}} a door which holds the ironing board, which hits Tom on the head, finally curing him of his amnesia. Jerry lets out a happy scream and runs to his <b>mouse</b> <b>hole.</b> He kisses Tom and then lies down on his bed to relax. Tom also lies down right outside Jerry's <b>mouse</b> <b>hole.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Akutaq {{is served}} on all special occasions. Like Yup'ik dance, akutaq {{is not an}} {{everyday}} dish. It is a special treat, an honor to receive and a responsibility to give. [...] "Mouse akutak" [...] is made from roots found in <b>mouse</b> <b>holes.</b> Only {{a portion of the}} mouse's stored roots is taken, and some people replace the roots with something else the mouse can eat.|$|R
50|$|The {{spaceship}} {{gives the}} player {{the ability to}} visit various planets. Aside from using the ship to move between planets, a complicated network of shortcuts exists between planets and scenes. The game, being presented in first person view, enables shifts from the macroscopic to the microscopic level. Most of the shortcuts are found at the microscopic level; through a water drain or a <b>mouse's</b> <b>hole,</b> for example.|$|R

50|$|Tom nails Jerry's <b>mouse</b> <b>hole</b> shut, {{and decides}} to make a mouse trap to catch Jerry (using footage from the 1955 short Designs on Jerry). Jerry gets out of his <b>mouse</b> <b>hole</b> and finds the trap. He modifies a {{measurement}} on the blueprints in order again to make the trap fail (like he did in Designs on Jerry). The trap is set, but the safe contraption (a part of the trap meant to get him) hits Tom instead. Later, Jerry films Tom ripping the blueprints he used for the mouse trap. Unlike the ending of Designs on Jerry, however, Tom appears flattened and bandaged, rather than cube-shaped.|$|E
50|$|Speedy {{leads him}} back into town, but upon {{reaching}} the <b>mouse</b> <b>hole,</b> Speedy dives in while Vulturo crashes into the wall. As his head begins to split open, he quickly grabs his sombrero to cover it, then asks Speedy where the mouse {{he was talking about}} is as he climbs back to his feet. Speedy however, says that Vulturo has the wrong <b>mouse</b> <b>hole</b> as there's no one in that hole except for chickens, complete with Speedy clucking like one to fool him. Vulturo is not convinced in the slightest, but plays along, saying he'll look somewhere else, but has a plan to lure Speedy out.|$|E
5000|$|Uncle Pecos asks Jerry {{if he has}} a spare guitar string, but Jerry {{shakes his}} head in the way of saying no. Pecos looks out the <b>mouse</b> <b>hole</b> and claims he sees another string. He walks up to a {{sleeping}} Tom and fearlessly plucks a whisker off the cat's face and installs it into his guitar, startling Tom awake. As Pecos starts to play a song, a shocked Jerry comes to the rescue and quickly carries his reckless uncle away from Tom back to the <b>mouse</b> <b>hole,</b> accidentally banging his uncle's head on the wall just above the hole whilst doing so. Just as Tom is about to get them, Jerry drags Pecos into the hole, but Pecos quickly sticks his head out and thanks a confused Tom for his [...] "service".|$|E
6000|$|... 'I shall {{leave the}} door open,' Sheila continued. 'I am not, as you no doubt very {{naturally}} assumed--I {{am not going}} to do anything either senseless or heedless. I am merely going to ask your brother Cecil to come in, if he is at home, and if not, no doubt our old friend Mr. Montgomery would--would help us.' Her scrutiny was still and concentrated, like that of a cat above a <b>mouse's</b> <b>hole.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Knives & Forks: This {{level will}} feature a similar boss to Great Expectations, except this boss will be {{throwing}} knives and forks. You will have two <b>mouse</b> <b>holes</b> to make it easier. There are also two blue targets that will shield you. To win the game, {{you have to get}} the boss to hit both blue targets with a knife or fork. A blue laser beam will appear {{in the middle of the}} screen and the boss will get fried.|$|R
50|$|Because of {{his young}} age, Roo {{is a very small}} animal, the {{smallest}} in the story (other than Rabbit's friends and relations, and Alexander Beetle), although he must be very close in size to Piglet since Kanga is unable to tell the difference when Piglet jumps into her pouch instead of Roo. (In Ernest H. Shepard's illustrations, Roo appears to be very slightly smaller than Piglet.) He is also apparently small enough to fall down <b>mouse</b> <b>holes</b> while practicing jumps, and too small to reach the first rail of the Poohsticks bridge.|$|R
5000|$|The {{music video}} to the Bis song [...] "Sweet Shop Avengerz" [...] {{features}} Bis, having been miniaturized {{to only a}} few inches tall, performing next to a <b>mouse</b> <b>hole.</b> During the video, the band are nearly crushed by a man with a pen and later, are nearly eaten by a cat.|$|E
50|$|To {{start the}} game (and after each goal), the puck is {{placed under the}} center <b>mouse</b> <b>hole.</b> Each player raps {{the bottom of the}} box with his hockey stick and then taps his opponent's blade, repeating this three times. After the third tap, both players can go after the puck and play begins.|$|E
50|$|A mother {{woodpecker}} {{leaves her}} nest for lunch, but an egg {{in the nest}} jumps up and falls to the ground, rolling into Jerry's <b>mouse</b> <b>hole.</b> Jerry wakes up to find himself sitting on the egg. An adorable baby woodpecker hatches and instantly takes to Jerry as his mother, but cannot resist pecking Jerry's furniture.|$|E
50|$|During the Battle of Ortona, the Canadian Army (which {{gave the}} tactic its name) {{used it to}} great effect. Using weapons such as the PIAT or {{anti-tank}} guns to breach {{the walls of a}} building (as houses within Ortona shared adjoining walls), the soldiers would then throw in grenades and assault through the <b>mouse</b> <b>holes,</b> clearing the top floors and making their way down, where both adversaries struggled in repeated close-quarters combat. Mouse-holing was also used to pierce through walls into adjoining rooms, sometimes catching enemy troops by surprise.|$|R
50|$|<b>Mouse</b> <b>holes</b> {{can be made}} {{in light}} {{interior}} walls by hand or with small arms. More substantial walls require the use of explosives such as a satchel charge, or a large caliber, vehicle-mounted cannon or tank gun. If time and conditions allow, breaches can be made with even small amounts of explosive if properly tamped and braced, e.g. with sandbags and props, to direct the force of the explosion into the wall. Since the early 90s many armies developed special purpose weapons like the MATADOR and SMAW specifically for this tactic.|$|R
5000|$|In this mode, {{the shaman}} {{attempts}} {{to kill the}} mice, mainly by using cannonballs, or other summoned things. In this mode, there isn't any <b>mouse</b> <b>holes,</b> but there is cheese in some maps {{to make it harder}} to move. The mice try to avoid the cannonballs and stay alive by the time the round is over. Sometimes, this mode features [...] "vampire" [...] maps. These maps have no shaman. One mouse is randomly selected as the vampire. The vampire attempts to [...] "infect" [...] other mice, while the mice attempt {{to stay away from the}} vampires.|$|R
50|$|Sylvester then hypnotizes {{the kitten}} {{with a book}} of {{hypnosis}} to hit the sleeping Elmer {{on the head with}} a baseball bat; the kitten misinterprets Sylvester's visual instruction and hits Sylvester instead. Elmer, woken up, throws Sylvester back down the stairs, warning him he'll be held responsible for the next disturbance. Sylvester then sets a wind-up mouse toy loose and the kitten chases it, following it into a <b>mouse</b> <b>hole.</b> Sylvester blocks up the <b>mouse</b> <b>hole</b> with wood and nails. The kitten, however, starts knocking out the nails holding up the paintings and shelves hanging on the wall. Sylvester, remembering Elmer's warning, tries to catch all of the falling objects, as the kitten (still trapped in the walls) makes his way upstairs. The chandelier above Fudd's head crashes to the floor before Sylvester can stop it, which awakens Elmer, who issues a final ultimatum to Sylvester should he be disturbed yet again.|$|E
50|$|It {{begins with}} various {{household}} items in a darkly lit utility room assembling themselves into Jones's backing band. Jones performs the song with the band, as a doll in a doll's house {{and on a}} miniature stage, and she dances with an empty tuxedo before performing the song in a <b>mouse</b> <b>hole,</b> dressed in a mouse costume. The video ends with the items assuming their original positions in the room.|$|E
50|$|Tom feeds Quacker on {{plenty of}} bread to fatten and stuff him up, {{and while the}} {{duckling}} is not looking, the cat gets hold of a cleaver and attempts to chop Quacker up, but invariably misses. The duckling escapes into Jerry's <b>mouse</b> <b>hole</b> and into his bed, shaking in terror (the shape under Jerry's sheet resembles a ringing bell). Jerry uncovers Quacker, who informs the mouse of what Tom was tried to do with him. Then the Quacker hides back under Jerry's bed and shakes in terror once again. Jerry emerges from his <b>mouse</b> <b>hole</b> cautiously, but Tom is quick and cuts him down with his cleaver... almost. Quacker, believing that Jerry has been beheaded, he pulls the mouse's legs, only for the camera to pull away, showing that Tom has only managed to catch Jerry by the whiskers. Jerry is set free and gets his revenge on Tom by grabbing the cat's tail and sticking {{it out of the}} hole, so that Tom reflexively chops it with the cleaver and then screams in pain upon doing so.|$|E
5000|$|Without any success so far, Porky {{constructs}} {{a robotic}} cat. The mouse retaliates at the robot cat, which flawless being unaffected by a bowling ball, a flamethrowing boiler, dynamite and a pistol shot. The robot cat then blocks the mouse's ways into the <b>mouse</b> <b>holes.</b> The robot cat further resists the mouse's tricks from electrocution, more flamethrowing, decapitation and battering. Finally the mouse blows up the robot cat with a dynamite laced clockwork mouse, destroying Porky's house. Despite this, Porky Pig is {{relieved to be}} rid of the mouse, who then emerges to say [...] "Shall I tell him?".|$|R
50|$|Tom rolls {{a lighted}} {{firework}} into Jerry's hole, and Jerry rolls it back out under Tom. Tom hears it hissing under him and raises himself such {{that he is}} dazed, but not hurt, by the explosion. Both cats then arm a hand grenade and throw it into the <b>mouse's</b> <b>hole,</b> but they hit each other and return to their owners. The two grenades {{go back and forth}} until the explosion of them occurs in each of their users' hands, damaging the almost entire wall. Both cats will give up and they move on going to Paris as Lightning waves to him, while Jerry whistles and follows with them.|$|R
50|$|Similar to {{underground}} tunnels used {{in rural}} battlefields, mouse-holes can also allow forces to infiltrate behind enemy lines, providing a significant tactical advantage. In some cases, a mouse-hole will be camouflaged with furniture, {{especially when they}} are created to aid a defending force or a clandestine operation. When used in defensive positions, <b>mouse</b> <b>holes</b> often join and combine with underground tunnels. This {{was used by the}} Red Army of the Soviet Union during the Battle of Stalingrad, where it allowed troops to consistently infiltrate areas to the German rear that were supposedly cleared. The ubiquitous availability of the Panzerfaust in the last months of the war made all sides use it to quickly breach buildings from unexpected directions.|$|R
50|$|The cartoon {{starts with}} Tom fishing on a pier. Tom baits {{the line with}} cheese and casts {{it all the way}} out to a far-off ship and into Jerry's <b>mouse</b> <b>hole.</b> The cat gets a bite and gets pulled off the pier and onto a pillar, while the {{sleeping}} mouse nibbles at the cheese, not knowing it's actually rubber. Tom catches the mouse in a fish net and plops him onto the pier, waking Jerry up with a start.|$|E
5000|$|Somewhere in Beverly Hills, in {{the house}} of Jack Benny (a sign out front proclaims, [...] "Star of Stage * Screen * Radio * Television...also cartoons"), a mouse version of Jack is {{practicing}} his violin—off-key—and saying to himself, [...] "Who is this guy Isaac Stern?" [...] (In real life Benny and Stern were good friends.) Outside Jack's <b>mouse</b> <b>hole,</b> a cat is lying in wait, wearing ear muffs to filter out the discordant sound of Jack's violin.|$|E
50|$|The fireballs pursue Jerry {{through the}} <b>mouse</b> <b>hole</b> through the barrel {{going back and}} forth until he {{eventually}} he leads them into a hose, which he shoots like a machine gun into a barrel where Tom is hiding. The barrel explodes, leaving Tom riding the remaining parts of the barrel like a bicycle, which then crashes into the wall. Recovering, Tom fires a dart gun at Jerry, which hits him on the tail as he again attempts to dive into his mousehole.|$|E
50|$|Sylvester's owners, Sam and Violet, go on {{vacation}} to California, forgetting to put him outside. Sylvester abruptly notices this, finding that he is locked inside an empty house devoid of food with no milk being delivered for two weeks. Fortunately, he finds a cupboard full of canned tuna and cat food, but discovers that he also needs a can opener. He seemingly cannot find one, until he sees a mouse with it. He begs the mouse to give it, {{but for some reason}} the mouse throws it into his hole. Sylvester frantically tries and fails to retrieve it and the mouse casually walks away. Sylvester angrily gives chase and crashes into the <b>mouse's</b> <b>hole</b> while trying to catch him.|$|R
