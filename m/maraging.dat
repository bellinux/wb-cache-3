5|$|Some {{more modern}} steels include tool steels, which are alloyed with {{large amounts of}} {{tungsten}} and cobalt or other elements to maximize solution hardening. This also allows the use of precipitation hardening and improves the alloy's temperature resistance. Tool steel is generally used in axes, drills, and other devices that need a sharp, long-lasting cutting edge. Other special-purpose alloys include weathering steels such as Cor-ten, which weather by acquiring a stable, rusted surface, and so can be used un-painted. <b>Maraging</b> steel is alloyed with nickel and other elements, but unlike most steel contains little carbon (0.01%). This creates a very strong but still malleable steel.|$|E
25|$|Among the alloys {{cited for}} Wankel housing use are A-132, Inconel 625, and 356 treated to T6 hardness. Several {{materials}} {{have been used}} for plating the housing working surface, Nikasil being one. Citroen, Mercedes-Benz, Ford, A P Grazen and others applied for patents in this field. For the apex seals, the choice of materials has evolved along with the experience gained, from carbon alloys, to steel, ferrotic, and other materials. The combination between housing plating and apex and side seals materials was determined experimentally, to obtain the best duration of both seals and housing cover. For the shaft, steel alloys with little deformation on load are preferred, the use of <b>Maraging</b> steel has been proposed for this.|$|E

50|$|In {{the sport}} of fencing, blades used in {{competitions}} run {{under the auspices of}} the Fédération Internationale d'Escrime are usually made with <b>maraging</b> steel. <b>Maraging</b> blades are superior for foil and épée because crack propagation in <b>maraging</b> steel is 10 times slower than in carbon steel, resulting in less blade breakage and fewer injuries. Stainless <b>maraging</b> steel is used in bicycle frames and golf club heads.

50|$|<b>Maraging</b> steel's {{strength}} and malleability in the pre-aged stage {{allows it to}} be formed into thinner rocket and missile skins than other steels, reducing weight for a given strength. <b>Maraging</b> steels have very stable properties, and, even after overaging due to excessive temperature, only soften slightly. These alloys retain their properties at mildly elevated operating temperatures and have maximum service temperatures of over 400 °C F. They are suitable for engine components, such as crankshafts and gears, and the firing pins of automatic weapons that cycle from hot to cool repeatedly while under substantial load. Their uniform expansion and easy machinability before aging make <b>maraging</b> steel useful in high-wear components of assembly lines and dies. Other ultra-high-strength steels, such as AerMet alloys, are not as machinable because of their carbide content.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Maraging</b> steels (a {{portmanteau}} of [...] "martensitic" [...] and [...] "aging") are steels (iron alloys) {{that are}} known for possessing superior strength and toughness without losing malleability, although they cannot hold a good cutting edge. Aging refers to the extended heat-treatment process. These steels are a special class of low-carbon ultra-high-strength steels that derive their strength not from carbon, but from precipitation of intermetallic compounds. The principal alloying element is 15 to 25 wt.% nickel. Secondary alloying elements, which include cobalt, molybdenum, and titanium, are added to produce intermetallic precipitates,. Original development (by Bieber of Inco in the late 1950s) was carried out on 20 and 25 wt.% Ni steels to which small additions of Al, Ti, and Nb were made; {{a rise in the}} price of cobalt in the late 1970s {{led to the development of}} cobalt-free <b>maraging</b> steels ...|$|E

50|$|When {{heat-treated}} {{the alloy}} {{has very little}} dimensional change, so it is often machined to its final dimensions. Due to the high alloy content <b>maraging</b> steels have a high hardenability. Since ductile FeNi martensites are formed upon cooling, cracks are non-existent or negligible. The steels can be nitrided to increase case hardness, and polished to a fine surface finish.|$|E

50|$|The {{material}} used {{to manufacture}} the beam coupling also affects its performance and suitability for specific {{applications such as}} food, medical and aerospace. Materials are typically aluminum alloy and stainless steel, {{but they can also}} be made in acetal, <b>maraging</b> steel and titanium. The most common applications are attaching rotary encoders to shafts and motion control for robotics.|$|E
50|$|The common, non-stainless grades contain 17-19 wt.% nickel, 8-12 wt.% cobalt, 3-5 wt.% molybdenum, and 0.2-1.6 wt.% titanium. Addition of {{chromium}} produces stainless grades {{resistant to}} corrosion. This also indirectly increases hardenability as they require less nickel: high-chromium, high-nickel steels are generally austenitic {{and unable to}} transform to martensite when heat treated, while lower-nickel steels can transform to martensite. Alternative variants of Ni-reduced <b>maraging</b> steels are based on alloys of Fe and Mn plus minor additions of Al, Ni, and Ti where compositions between Fe-9wt.% Mn to Fe-15wt.% Mn have been used. The Mn has a similar effect as Ni, i.e. it stabilizes the austenite phase. Hence, depending on their Mn content, Fe-Mn <b>maraging</b> steels can be fully martensitic after quenching them from the high temperature austenite phase or they can contain retained austenite. The latter effect enables the design of maraging-TRIP steels where TRIP stands for Transformation-Induced-Plasticity.|$|E
