5|$|Behan {{testified that}} when he searched Tom McLaury for a weapon prior to the gunfight, he was not thorough, and that Tom <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> pistol hidden in his waistband. Behan's {{testimony}} was significant, {{since he was a}} prime witness for the prosecution but had equivocated on this point. Behan's sympathy to the Cowboys was well known, and during the trial he firmly denied he had contributed money to help Ike with his defense costs. However, documents were located in 1997 that showed Behan served as guarantor for a loan to Ike Clanton during the Spicer hearing. Since Wyatt planned to run against Behan for County Sheriff, Behan had an incentive to help convict Wyatt.|$|E
5|$|Counsel {{assisting}} the Inquiry, Henry Winneke, advocated {{that the cause}} of the accident was Spence's diabetes. Justice Simpson was critical of the Director-General's investigation panel for considering 25 possible causes of the accident but failing to consider that the Department's negligence in licensing a diabetic pilot might have been the root cause of the accident. After the inquiry had received all available information related to Spence's diabetes, Justice Simpson said the insulin reaction of the pilot <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> considerable bearing on the accident.|$|E

5|$|The Mission of the Guardian Angel {{was somewhere}} in the {{vicinity}} of Chicago from 1696 until it was abandoned in around 1700. The Fox Wars effectively closed the Chicago area to Europeans {{in the first part of}} the 18th century. The first non-native to re-settle in the area may have been a trader named Guillory, who <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> trading-post near Wolf Point on the Chicago River in around 1778. After Point du Sable, Antoine Ouilmette is the next recorded resident of Chicago; he claimed to have settled at the mouth of the Chicago River in July 1790, a few months after Hugh Heward visited Point du Sable.|$|E
5|$|All the {{vertebrae}} {{were highly}} pneumatised by invading air sacs, {{except for the}} atlas bone and the hindmost tail vertebrae, and were thereby connected to the respiratory system. The back vertebrae were as pneumatised as those of sauropod dinosaurs, and had an extensive system of depressions. These adaptations may be correlated with gigantism, as they reduce weight. The six vertebrae of the sacrum were also tall and pneumatised, and all but the first one were fused together at the top, their neural spines forming a neural plate. The ilium, the top hip bone, was also partially pneumatised close to the sacral vertebrae. Part of the pelvis was hypertrophied (enlarged) compared to other ornithomimosaurs, to support {{the weight of the}} animal with strong muscle attachments. The front hip bones tilted upwards in life. The tail of Deinocheirus ended in at least two fused vertebrae, which were described as similar to the pygostyle of oviraptorosaurian and therizinosauroid theropods. Ornithomimosaurs are known to have had pennaceous feathers, so this feature suggests that they <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> fan of feathers at the tail end.|$|E
5|$|The {{release of}} Invincible {{was preceded by}} a dispute between Jackson and his record label, Sony Music Entertainment. Jackson had {{expected}} the licenses to the masters of his albums to revert to him {{some time in the}} early 2000s, after which {{he would be able to}} promote the material however he pleased and keep the profits; however, clauses in the contract set the revert date years into the future. Jackson discovered that the attorney who had represented him in the deal had also been representing Sony. He was also concerned that for years Sony had been pressuring him to sell his share in its music catalog venture; he feared that Sony <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> conflict of interest, since if Jackson's career failed, he would have had to sell his share of the catalog at a low price. Jackson sought an early exit from his contract.|$|E

25|$|Poseidonia <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> major {{share in}} a new {{foundation}} of Sybaris, which lasted from 452/1 BC until 446/5BC. This {{is suggested by the}} great resemblance of the coins of Sybaris to those of Poseidonia during this period. Possibly a treaty of friendship between Sybaris, its allies, and the Serdaioi (an unknown people) dates to this new foundation, because Poseidonia was the guarantor of this treaty.|$|E
25|$|Investigators {{at first}} focused on Emile and Roldan, since {{both of them}} <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> motive to harm Bethany due to the love {{triangle}} they were involved in.

Later they were able to have him return to the U.S., where he spoke with police at length and took a lie detector test.|$|E

The investigation stalled and charges of police laxity and indifference were made by the press. The implications, then compared to the police complicity in the 1912 murder of Herman Rosenthal, created such a scandal that then Police Commissioner Joseph Warren, a former law partner of Mayor James J. Walker, resigned due to ill health.|$|E
25|$|This affair instigated public {{discussion}} and was {{often referred to}} as 'scandalous'. Whether Lokhvitskaya and Balmont had ever been physically close, remained unclear. Some suggested they <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> short affair in the early days; in the later years even in the geographical terms both were wide apart, with Balmont spending much of his time abroad. In his autobiography At the Dawn (На заре) he described their relationship as 'poetic friendship'. Modern literary historians consider their relationship to have been truly platonic affair, albeit violently passionate, frustrating and psychologically detrimental for both.|$|E
25|$|T. azerguensis has {{a similar}} size and postcranial anatomy to the other Temnodontosaurus species however it has {{different}} cranial morphology. The rostrum more elongate and thin {{and it has a}} reduced quadrate. It seems T. azerguensis either had very small teeth or no teeth at all. Martin explains that it was probably not effective at eating hard shelled or bony prey. It was that T. azerguenis <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> diet of smaller and softer prey compared to the other Temnodontosaurus species. It is also believed from Martin’s description of T. azerguensis that this specimen is younger than other Ichthyosaurs known because it is from the bifrons ammiote zone of the middle Toarcian.|$|E

25|$|Domestically in Zimbabwe, he {{did well}} in the Logan Cup, captaining the Midlands team and scoring two centuries to average 55. However, this was down the order, as he decided his {{technique}} was not tight {{enough for him to}} open the innings. Despite his domestic success, he failed to keep his place against Bangladesh, and decided to take up a club appointment in England rather than stay at home and hope for selection against India and West Indies. He <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> match or two, in fact, as Zimbabwe suffered from injuries, and had he been available he might have played in the final Test against the West Indies instead of Hamilton Masakadza, who hit a century on debut.|$|E
25|$|On Holy Saturday, Parma {{travelled}} to Udinese to face ex-employee Francesco Guidolin's charges. Udinese {{started the}} game well, {{but the first}} half was an even affair. Udinese <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> man sent off when Giovinco was fouled when through on goal, but Roberto Pereyra was only booked. Udinese took the lead on the stroke of half-time with a calm finish from Kwadwo Asamoah. Antonio Di Natale doubled the lead just before the hour mark, but it was Parma who continued to press. The away side's reward eventually came from a corner and captain Alessandro Lucarelli's calm finish from close range. As Parma looked for an equaliser, Udinese broke and Asamoah sealed victory with his second goal of the afternoon. Unlikely victories for Lecce against Roma and Fiorentina against Milan meant Parma were dragged back into the relegation fight.|$|E
25|$|Louis Jolliet and Jacques Marquette, though {{probably}} not the first Europeans to visit the area, are the first recorded to have visited the Chicago River in 1673, when they wrote of their discovery of the geographically vital Chicago Portage. Marquette returned in 1674, camped a few days {{near the mouth of}} the river, then moved on to the Chicago River–Des Plaines River portage, where he stayed through the winter of 1674–75.
