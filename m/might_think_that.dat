25|$|With all {{the focus}} on veterans, the {{children}} are left {{to grow up in}} sometimes harsh, usually very strict environments with no recognition and no help. With enormous differences between military children and civilian children, one <b>might</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> there would be inquiry into the effects, yet few can be found readily available. Mary Edwards Werstch writes about her experiences, as well as the experiences of those she has interviewed, in her book Brats: Growing up inside the Fortress. Pat Conroy also sheds light on the difficult circumstances of growing up in his book (later a movie), The Great Santini.|$|E
25|$|Based on this, one <b>might</b> <b>think</b> <b>that,</b> if the wavefunction {{for each}} {{particle}} (in more precise terms, the quantum field for each particle type) were simultaneously mirror-reversed, then the {{new set of}} wavefunctions would perfectly satisfy {{the laws of physics}} (apart from the weak interaction). It turns out that this is not quite true: In order for the equations to be satisfied, the wavefunctions of certain types of particles have to be multiplied by −1, in addition to being mirror-reversed. Such particle types are said to have negative or odd parity (P=−1, or alternatively P=–), while the other particles are said to have positive or even parity (P=+1, or alternatively P=+).|$|E
25|$|Commodity ETFs trade {{just like}} shares, are simple and {{efficient}} and provide exposure to an ever-increasing range of commodities and commodity indices, including energy, metals, softs and agriculture. However, {{it is important}} for an investor to realize that there are often other factors that affect the price of a commodity ETF that might not be immediately apparent. For example, buyers of an oil ETF such as USO <b>might</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> as long as oil goes up, they will profit roughly linearly. What isn't clear to the novice investor is the method by which these funds gain exposure to their underlying commodities. In the case of many commodity funds, they simply roll so-called front-month futures contracts from month to month. This does give exposure to the commodity, but subjects the investor to risks involved in different prices along the term structure, such as a high cost to roll.|$|E

25|$|Cornelia calls Dr. Wells back to {{the house}} to examine Richard's body. Dale asks Wells to hide the {{blueprint}} she took from Richard, because the others <b>might</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> she killed him for it. Reginald Beresford, a lawyer waiting in his car after he drove Richard to the house, comes inside. Reginald recognizes Jack, and the exposure of her fiancé makes Dale admit that she gave Wells the blueprint with the hidden room. Wells claims that he does not have the blueprint; Cornelia reveals other evidence incriminating him, and Anderson asks to question him alone. Wells knocks Anderson unconscious during the interrogation and drags him into another room. Before Wells can go to the hidden room, a stranger claiming to have lost his memory after he was attacked and tied up in the garage appears at the terrace door. When the guests try to identify the unknown man, they discover that they have been locked in the house. At {{the end of the second}} act, Cornelia finds the Bat's calling card, a black paper bat, tacked to a door.|$|E
500|$|The International Astronomical Union (IAU) {{currently}} recognizes five dwarf planets: Pluto; and [...] Brown criticizes {{this official}} recognition: [...] "A reasonable person <b>might</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> {{this means that}} there are five known objects {{in the solar system}} which fit the IAU definition of dwarf planet, but this reasonable person would be nowhere close to correct." ...|$|E
500|$|By January 1915, {{the horrific}} {{nature of the}} war was apparent. Michael felt [...] "greatly embittered towards people in general and most of all towards those who are at the top, who hold power and allow all that horror to happen. If the {{question}} of war were decided by the people at large, I would not be so passionately averse to that great calamity." [...] Michael confessed {{in a letter to his}} wife that he felt [...] "ashamed to face the people, i.e. the soldiers and officers, particularly when visiting field hospitals, where so much suffering is to be seen, for they <b>might</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> one is also responsible, for one is placed so high and yet has failed to prevent all that from happening and protect one's country from this disaster." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Does she <b>think</b> <b>that</b> {{my mother}} dislikes her; her specially?" [...] asked Lord Lufton. No; Robarts could not suppose {{that that was}} the case; but Lady Lufton <b>might</b> {{probably}} <b>think</b> <b>that</b> a marriage with a clergyman's sister would be a mésalliance.|$|R
6000|$|... "But if she did, {{it seems}} natural {{to me that}} she should speak of it to no one. She <b>might</b> {{probably}} <b>think</b> <b>that</b> Bernard would be as well pleased that it should not be known." ...|$|R

500|$|Moffat was {{inspired}} by a crack in his son's bedroom wall and developed the idea into the main story arc for the fifth series. He thought that a child <b>might</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> something interesting lived inside such a crack. The hidden room in Amelia's house was based on Moffat's recurring childhood dream of a nonexistent hidden room in his grandmother's house. Moffat was keen to give the monster a giant eyeball, and commented that the Atraxi's design— a giant eyeball on a star— was easy for children to draw, as he used to draw Doctor Who monsters as a child. These aspects reflect Doctor Who [...] "domestically-scaled menace" [...] principle. Moffat wrote a scene that explained Prisoner Zero's crime, but cut it because he figured no one would care.|$|E
500|$|The {{restaurant}} did {{not receive}} universal acclaim, however. In a negative review for The Portland Mercury in 2000, Robin Rosenberg wrote: ... one expects the food at Esparza's to be something special; You <b>might</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> the line trickling out the door on a Thursday night {{is an indication of}} exceptional Tex-Mex, worth a considerable sum. Well, certainly, Esparza's dècor, an amalgam of Western nostalgia, Texan brawn, and Tijuana cheese is executed with flair. Unfortunately though, no thematic coup can compensate for the fact that Esparza's food rarely exceeds mediocre, and never lives up to its price... The bulk of the clientele resides in a comfortable economic bracket and come down to the gritty Eastside to quaff top shelf margaritas and feast on manic kitsch. The hot corn chips and fresh salsa, which come fast and free, are the height of the meal. Smoked salmon enchiladas are just wrong; No quantity of barbecue sauce (in this case, cloying and acrid) is going to improve a tough, dry brisket. The pork tacos are equally dry, but the ground buffalo enchiladas are very macho and spicy (though they will linger painfully)... The beans and rice that accompany most entrees are utterly flavorless, a gratuitous use of space on the plate. Some people like beans and rice; Esparza's doesn't seem to care. It's a troublesome adage, 'you get what you pay for,' when you've gorged on flash and formula—and yet, you're starved for a good meal.|$|E
500|$|By 1808 it {{was still}} {{considered}} unsafe to return to Berlin, and the royal family consequently spent the summer near Königsberg; Louise believed that the hard trials of her children's early lives {{would be good for}} them: [...] "If they had been reared in luxury and prosperity they <b>might</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> so it must always be." [...] In the winter of 1808, Tsar Alexander I invited the king and queen to St. Petersburg, where she was treated to sumptuously decorated rooms; [...] "Nothing dazzles me anymore", she exclaimed on her return to Germany. Near the birth of her youngest child Princess Louise in 1809, Louise wrote to her father, [...] "Gladly...the calamities which have befallen us have not forced their way into our wedded and home life, rather have strengthened the same, and made it even more precious to us." [...] Louise was sick for much of that year, but returned with the king to Berlin near the end of it after an absence of three years; the queen arrived in a carriage accompanied by her two daughters Charlotte and Alexandrine and younger son Charles, and was greeted by her father at Charlottenburg Palace– the residence was ransacked however, as Napoleon and his commanders had stripped its rooms of paintings, statues, manuscripts, and antiquities. Returning to a much different Prussia than she left, a preacher observed that [...] "our dear queen is far from joyful, but her seriousness has a quiet serenity... her eyes have lost their former sparkle, and one sees that they have wept much, and still weep".|$|E
2500|$|Rabbi Simeon {{noted that}} Scripture always lists turtledoves before pigeons, and {{imagined}} <b>that</b> one <b>might</b> thus <b>think</b> <b>that</b> Scripture prefers turtledoves over pigeons. But Rabbi Simeon quoted the instructions of [...] "a young pigeon or a turtledove for a sin-offering", to teach that Scripture accepted both equally.|$|R

2500|$|In the {{continuation}} of the reading ( [...] , aliyah) in chapter [...] God told Moses to tell the Israelites to turn back and encamp by the sea, so that Pharaoh <b>might</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> the Israelites were trapped and follow after them. When Pharaoh learned that the people had fled, he had a change of heart, and he chased the Israelites with chariots. The first reading ( [...] , aliyah) ends here.|$|E
40|$|Majority rule {{is often}} adopted almost by default {{as a group}} {{decision}} rule. One <b>might</b> <b>think,</b> therefore, <b>that</b> {{the conditions under which}} it applies, and the argument on its behalf, are well-understood. However, the standard arguments in support of majority rule display systematic deficiencies. This article explores these weaknesses, and assesses what can be said on behalf of majority rule. ...|$|R

2500|$|The Mishnah {{taught that}} {{notwithstanding}} its mature content, in the synagogue, Jews read and translated Tamar's story in [...] The Gemara questioned why the Mishnah bothered {{to say so}} and proposed that one <b>might</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> Jews should forbear {{out of respect for}} Judah. But the Gemara deduced that the Mishnah instructed that Jews read and translate the chapter to show that the chapter actually redounds to Judah's credit, as it records in [...] that he confessed his wrongdoing.|$|E
2500|$|Some of the {{recommendation}} {{that was given}} to practitioners was that the individuals had to explore and understand what forgiveness means before starting any intervention because the preconceived idea of forgiveness can cause problems with couples being open to forgive.

It was stated that the couple must know the following: ...|$|E
2500|$|The Sifra {{noted that}} [...] says both, [...] "if he be poor," [...] and [...] "his means do not suffice."

That's a lot to take care of, and our approach to this is not just doing something with them but doing the right thing. That takes time - that's why we're sometimes slow and not announcing, say, the next Destroy All Humans right away. We need to think about the place that IP has in today's gaming world, what the right next step is and what the fans want. Once we feel comfortable with all that, then we go ahead and do it.".|$|R

2500|$|The Rabbis {{interpreted}} {{the words of}} [...] "These are the statutes and the ordinances, which you shall observe {{to do in the}} land [...] [...] [...] all the days that you live upon the earth," [...] in a Baraita. They read [...] "the statutes" [...] to refer to the Rabbinic interpretations of the text. They read [...] "the ordinances" [...] to refer to monetary, civil laws. They read [...] "which you shall observe" [...] to refer study. They read [...] "to do" [...] to refer to actual practice. Reading [...] "in the land," [...] one <b>might</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> all precepts are binding only in the Land of Israel; therefore [...] states, [...] "all the days that you live upon the earth" [...] to teach that the laws bind one wherever one lives. Reading [...] "all the days," [...] one <b>might</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> all precepts are binding {{both inside and outside the}} Land of Israel; therefore [...] states, [...] "in the land." [...] The Rabbis taught that one could thus learn from the next verse, [...] "You shall utterly destroy all the places, wherein the nations served their God," [...] that just as the destruction of idolatry is a personal duty, and is binding both inside and outside the Land of Israel, so everything that is a personal duty is binding both inside and outside the Land of Israel. And conversely, laws that are connected to the land are binding only in the Land of Israel.|$|E
