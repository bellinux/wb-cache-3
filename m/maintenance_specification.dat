40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves 80 - 81). OOMMT (Object Oriented Maintenance Management Tool) is a CASE {{tool that}} provides guidelines {{and procedures for}} carrying out {{a variety of activities}} performed during the maintenance process. This tool keeps track of change requests and reported problems specifically for object oriented systems. It helps the maintainer in controlling and managing the maintenance process through out its different stages. This tool is based on a 5 stages model that begins with the change request stage, passes through the change evaluation, <b>maintenance</b> <b>specification,</b> and maintenance design stages till it ends with the system release stage. At the end of each stage a form is generated. The model design corresponds to the traditional waterfall life-cycle model of software development. The tool's implementation is done in Visual Basic 5. 0 as a front-end interface while all data are stored in Access 97 as a back-end database. Additionally a set of queries and reports brings ease and simplicity to the tool. 1 boudn copy: viii, 90 leaves; ill.; 31 cm. Available at RNL...|$|E
40|$|Integrated vehicle health {{management}} {{is a major}} component in a new, future fleet-management paradigm where a conscious effort is made to shift aircraft maintenance from a schedule-based approach to a more proactive and predictive approach (that is, condition-based maintenance). Its goal is to maximize fleet operational availability while minimizing the logistics footprint through monitoring of the deterioration of equipment conditions. A comprehensive integrated vehicle health-management system will be executed {{in an environment that}} includes different sensor technologies, multiple information systems, and different data models. Integrated vehicle healthmanagement implementers have to therefore deal with an integration problem that involves different specialized algorithms and embedded hardware platforms. Integrated vehicle {{health management}} applications will have common execution logic, and many will share the same data-processing algorithms; hence, development productivity and the quality of integrated vehicle health management applications can be increased through reusable software building blocks and algorithm libraries or, in particular, by using a software development framework. This paper presents an approach to distributed integrated vehicle health management systems that offers reusable software architecture for a class of integrated vehicle health management applications. The focus of this paper deals with an open software framework for development of integrated vehicle health management applications stemming from the open system architecture for a condition-based <b>maintenance</b> <b>specification,</b> which is an architecture-promoting interoperability and a component framework that enables reuse, data-process partitioning, configuration, and rapid prototyping. The framework is developed using Java and Internet communications engines' distributed middleware, and its application is demonstrated through a gearbox health-monitoring system, where the integrated vehicle health management software is deployed on the distributed embedded devices. This approach provides software-enabled capability to distribute/reconfigure the integrated vehicle health management data process (through the open system architecture for condition-based maintenance common interface and data model) across the hardware platforms to meet the given system configuration. The performance evaluation for the test example shows negligible overhead in the central processing unit, band width, and latency when using the framework...|$|E

H 577 P ISE 2016 Xinxix, 221 pages :color illustrationsThere is an {{increasing}} demand {{for the development of}} automated repair strategies for aerospace components. Compared with the high cost of purchasing new components, the cost of repairing used ones is much lower. Due to the foreign object damage, high-cycle fatigue, corrosion, wear, etc., various kinds of deformation of the used components are exhibited. A single general repair process is not feasible for the maintenance or restoration of those worn and deformed parts. The ideal advanced machining process to repair aeronautical components according to their unique shapes, with a quick turn-around time and high precision, should be automatically controlled by computers with only a few manual operations needed. Such fully automated process, also termed adaptive machining process, is hot research topic in the maintenance, repair, and overhaul (MRO) industry. This research presents a novel adaptive machining approach to restore the critical shape of the thin worn leading edge (LE) of the large size wide chord fan blade (WCFB) based on reverse engineering. For high overall efficiency, this study adopts the contact on-machine measurement approach which hybrids the function of surface measurement and machining. The advantages are the elimination of repeated operations of blade movement and orientation saving time and preventing positional differences between measurement and machining, ensuring high machining accuracy. An adaptive and automatic machining process has been developed in this study. The developed algorithms control the workflow based on the calculation result of each step. The restoration of the LE is constructed from the mathematical models. The innovative points of this study are the establishment of new mathematical models of the LE for the measurement of both full radius and non-full radius profiles, high efficiency algorithms for presenting the reconstructed profiles parametrically and three dimensional models, highly adaptive workflow algorithm to control the movement of the machine without using master model as a reference, easy operation fixture for large size freeform aero engine components with thin edge, and an integrated automatic system requiring very limited manual operation. The repaired Trent 800 fan blades were sent out for independent verification by third parties. The results of better than 3 microns prove that the repaired part has high surface continuity and smoothness. The check points requisite in the <b>maintenance</b> <b>specification</b> of the Trent 800 fan blade are complied with fully. The adaptive automatic process enhances the efficiency, accuracy, and reduces cost for the repair of the LE of the WCFBs. The engine manufacture Rolls-Royce is prepared to take the above process onto the production floor. It will bring great benefits to the aviation industry.

Software development at CDC was originally under the direction of George Hanson. Later Frank Mullaney oversaw software development before Clair Miller was hired to head software development specifically. Zemlin points out that early software was conceived of as applications. Zemlin considers CDC's attempts to limit their support to system software and compares the policies of CDC with those of International Business Machines. He discusses training a force of outside analysts that was developed to provide support for specific customers and subsequently became part of the marketing organization.

40|$|The {{theories}} {{based on}} session types {{stand out as}} effective methodologies to specify and verify properties of distributed systems. A key result in the area shows the suitability of choreography languages and session types {{as a basis for}} a choreography-driven methodology for distributed software development. The methodology it advocates is as follows: a team of programmers designs a global view of the interactions to be implemented (i. e., a choreography), then the choreography is projected onto each role. Finally, each program implementing one or more roles in the choreography is validated against its corresponding projection(s). This is an ideal methodology but it may not always be possible to design one set of choreographies that will drive the overall development of a distributed system. Indeed, software needs <b>maintenance,</b> <b>specifications</b> may evolve (sometimes also during the development), and issues may arise during the implementation phase. Therefore, {{there is a need for}} an alternative approach whereby it is possible to infer a choreography from local behavioural specifications (i. e., session types). We tackle the problem of synthesising choreographies from local behavioural specifications by introducing a type system which assigns – if possible – a choreography to set of session types. We demonstrate the importance of obtaining a choreography from local specifications through two applications. Firstly, we give three algorithms and a methodology to help software designers refine a choreography into a global assertion, i. e., a choreography decorated with logical formulae specifying senders’ obligations and receivers’ requirements. Secondly, we introduce a formal model for distributed systems where each participant advertises its requirements and obligations as behavioural contracts (in the form of session types), and where multiparty sessions are started when a set of contracts allows to synthesise a choreography...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{transcription}} factor Sox 9 was first discovered {{in patients with}} campomelic dysplasia, a haploinsufficiency disorder with skeletal deformities caused by dysregulation of Sox 9 expression during chondrogenesis. Since then, {{its role as a}} cell fate determiner during embryonic development has been well characterized; Sox 9 expression differentiates cells derived from all three germ layers into a large variety of specialized tissues and organs. However, recent data has shown that ectoderm- and endoderm-derived tissues continue to express Sox 9 in mature organs and stem cell pools, suggesting its role in cell <b>maintenance</b> and <b>specification</b> during adult life. The versatility of Sox 9 may be explained by a combination of post-transcriptional modifications, binding partners, and the tissue type in which it is expressed. Considering its importance during both development and adult life, it follows that dysregulation of Sox 9 has been implicated in various congenital and acquired diseases, including fibrosis and cancer. This review provides a summary of the various roles of Sox 9 in cell fate specification, stem cell biology, and related human diseases. Ultimately, understanding the mechanisms that regulate Sox 9 will be crucial for developing effective therapies to treat disease caused by stem cell dysregulation or even reverse organ damage...|$|R
