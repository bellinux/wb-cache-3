5|$|Although lesbian-feminism was a {{significant}} shift, not all lesbians agreed with it. Lesbian-feminism was a youth-oriented movement: its members were primarily college educated, with experience in New Left and radical causes, but they had not seen any success in persuading radical organizations to take up women's issues. Many older lesbians who had acknowledged their sexuality in more conservative times felt <b>maintaining</b> <b>their</b> ways of coping in a homophobic world was more appropriate. The Daughters of Bilitis folded in 1970 over which direction to focus on: feminism or gay rights issues.|$|E
5|$|An {{enduring}} theme {{during and}} after the oil boom has been a reluctance among Texans to relinquish their identity and a stubbornness in <b>maintaining</b> <b>their</b> cultural heritage in the face of drastic changes to the state brought by the sudden wealth. Despite its growth and industrialization, Texas culture in the mid-20th century remained distinct from the other industrial centers of the nation.|$|E
5|$|As a {{consequence}} of the race, Coulthard's second place narrowed the gap to Michael Schumacher in the Drivers' Championship to six points, while Häkkinen's win meant he closed to within two points of Coulthard. After the Grand Prix, McLaren were docked 10 points for a post-race technical infringement, resulting in Ferrari <b>maintaining</b> <b>their</b> lead in the Constructors' Championship with a four-point gap over McLaren, with seven races of the season remaining.|$|E

5|$|Bats seem to {{make use}} of {{particularly}} strong venomotion, a rhythmic contraction of venous wall muscles. In most mammals, the walls of the veins provide mainly passive resistance, <b>maintaining</b> <b>their</b> shape as deoxygenated blood flows through them, but in bats they appear to actively support blood flow back to the heart with this pumping action. Due to their relatively small and lightweight bodies, bats are not at risk of blood flow rushing to their heads when roosting.|$|E
5|$|England {{whitewashed}} Bangladesh in {{both the}} Test and ODI series, <b>maintaining</b> <b>their</b> record as the only Test-playing nation {{not to have been}} beaten by the Bangladeshis. England gave debuts to five players during the series, including South African-born Craig Kieswetter, which drew criticism over the number of foreign-born players in the England team, particularly from former England captain Michael Vaughan.|$|E
5|$|It passed {{onto his}} younger brother, George, who entertained Queen Anne and Prince Henry there in 1603, and onto George's grandson, Henry, who hosted James I three times between 1612 and 1617, and Charles I in 1634. The gardens were redeveloped, {{probably}} {{to provide a}} suitable venue for these royal visits.

5|$|Of the six common strong {{mineral acids}} in chemistry, {{hydrochloric}} acid is the monoprotic acid {{least likely to}} undergo an interfering oxidation-reduction reaction. It {{is one of the}} least hazardous strong acids to handle; despite its acidity, it consists of the non-reactive and non-toxic chloride ion. Intermediate-strength hydrochloric acid solutions are quite stable upon storage, <b>maintaining</b> <b>their</b> concentrations over time. These attributes, plus {{the fact that it is}} available as a pure reagent, make hydrochloric acid an excellent acidifying reagent.|$|E
5|$|Pest {{control of}} the jack jumper ant is {{successful}} in <b>maintaining</b> <b>their</b> populations around suburban habitats. Chemicals like bendiocarb, chlorpyrifos, diazinon and permethrin are effective against them. Spraying of Solfac into nests is an effective way of controlling nests {{if they are in}} a close range of areas with considerable amounts of congestion and human activity. Pouring carbon disulfide into nest holes and covering entrances up with soil is another method of removing colonies. The Australian National Botanic Gardens has an effective strategy of marking and maintaining jack jumper nests.|$|E

5|$|A mill {{was built}} on Welhay stream but this was {{replaced}} by tidal mills. In the 17th century the City of Bristol bought the manors of North Weston and Portishead {{for access to the}} channel and as a place to stay outside of the city and, in the 19th century, as a seaside resort. An outer sea wall was built allowing the local marshes to be drained and increased the land available for farming. The dominant architecture is early Victorian, with some buildings <b>maintaining</b> <b>their</b> original features. The expansion in residential property coincided with the construction of the dock, pier and the rail link to Bristol. The Royal Hotel by the pier was built in a Tudor Gothic style in 1830, to provide accommodation and catering for travellers on the steamers from Bristol, Wales and Ireland.|$|E
5|$|A {{video game}} {{distribution}} service, GOG.com {{was established by}} CD Projekt to help players find old games. Its mission is to offer games free of digital rights management (DRM) to players and its service was expanded to cover new AAA and independent games. The company opposes DRM in video games, and hopes that free downloadable content becomes an industry standard. CD Projekt considers <b>maintaining</b> <b>their</b> independence {{one of their most}} important strategies. As of September 2017, it is the largest publicly-traded game company in Poland, and also became the fifth largest game company in the Americas and Europe in terms of revenue and market capitalization after Activision Blizzard, Electronic Arts, Take-Two Interactive, and Ubisoft.|$|E

5|$|Team {{effectiveness}} (also {{referred to}} as group effectiveness) is the capacity a team has to accomplish the goals or objectives administered by an authorized personnel or the organization. A team {{is a collection of}} individuals who are interdependent in their tasks, share responsibility for outcomes, and view themselves as a unit embedded in an institutional or organizational system which operates within the established boundaries of that system. Teams and groups have established a synonymous relationship within the confines of processes and research relating to their effectiveness (i.e. group cohesiveness, teamwork) while still <b>maintaining</b> <b>their</b> independence as two separate units, as groups and their members are independent of each other's role, skill, knowledge or purpose versus teams and their members, who are interdependent upon each other's role, skill, knowledge and purpose.|$|E
5|$|The English Civil War {{broke out}} between the {{supporters}} of Charles I and Parliament in the 1640s; with the king and Parliament <b>maintaining</b> <b>their</b> capitals in Oxford and London respectively, the Thames Valley once again became a critical war zone. Wallingford was a Royalist town, with a garrison established there in 1642 to prevent an advance on Oxford to the north-west. Colonel Thomas Blagge was appointed governor, and in 1643 the king instructed him to refortify the castle, inspecting the results later that year. By 1644, the surrounding Thames towns of Abingdon and Reading had fallen and Parliamentary forces unsuccessfully attacked the town and castle of Wallingford in 1645. General Thomas Fairfax placed Wallingford Castle under siege the next year; after 16 weeks, during which Oxford fell to Parliamentary forces, the castle finally surrendered in July 1646 under generous terms for the defenders.|$|E
5|$|The {{athletics}} {{competition at}} the first Olympics featured a men's long jump competition and a women's competition was introduced at the 1948 Summer Olympics. Professional long jumpers typically have strong acceleration and sprinting abilities. However, athletes must also have a consistent stride {{to allow them to}} take off near the board while still <b>maintaining</b> <b>their</b> maximum speed. In addition to the traditional long jump, a standing long jump contest exists which requires that athletes leap from a static position without a run-up. A men's version of this event featured on the Olympic programme from 1900 to 1912.|$|E

5|$|The summer aggregations of the short-tail {{stingray}} at the Poor Knights Islands seem to {{at least}} partly serve a reproductive purpose, as both mating and birthing have been observed among the gathered rays. Courtship and mating take place in mid-water, {{and it has been}} speculated that the rising current flowing continuously through the narrow archways aids the rays in <b>maintaining</b> <b>their</b> position. Each receptive female may be followed by several males, who attempt to bite and grip her disc. One or two males may be dragged by the female for hours before she accedes; the successful male flips upside-down beneath her, inserting one of his claspers into her vent and rhythmically waving his tail from side to side. Copulation lasts 3–5 minutes. Females in captivity have been observed mating with up to three different males in succession.|$|E
5|$|When Chandrabhanu {{embarked}} on a second invasion of the south, the Pandyas came to {{the support of the}} Sinhalese king and killed Chandrabhanu in 1262 and installed Aryacakravarti, a minister in charge of the invasion, as the king. When the Pandyan Empire became weak due to Muslim invasions, successive Aryacakravarti rulers made the Jaffna kingdom independent and a regional power to reckon with in Sri Lanka. All subsequent kings of the Jaffna Kingdom claimed descent from one Kulingai Cakravarti who is identified with Kalinga Magha by Swami Gnanaprakasar and Mudaliar Rasanayagam while <b>maintaining</b> <b>their</b> Pandyan progenitor’s family name.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the end of}} World War I {{the units}} that had been raised {{as part of the}} AIF were disbanded, and the focus of Australian defence {{planning}} returned once more to the maintenance of the Citizens Forces. To this end, a review of defence requirements in 1920 established the need for Australia to be able to field a force of approximately 270,000 men {{in the event of a}} war, of which half of this would be maintained in peacetime through compulsory enlistment. It was also decided that the Citizens Force would be re-organised along the lines of the AIF, adopting the divisional structure of the AIF units and <b>maintaining</b> <b>their</b> battle honours. The AIF officially ceased to exist on 1 April 1921 and the new organisation of the Citizens Forces was adopted a month later; this saw the reorganisation of the 88 infantry battalions and five pioneer regiments that had been established under the 1918 scheme, the abolition of infantry regiments and the re-establishment of the 60 infantry battalions that had existed within the AIF, as well as various other units, such as light horse regiments, as well.|$|E
