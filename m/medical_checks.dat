40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{determine}} health related factors that affect neonatal, post neonatal,infant and child mortality. For this, the data is collected using multistage sampling technique and direct methodof mortality estimation, contingency analysis and logistic regression procedure has been applied.
