50|$|The Atari {{joystick}} port used a 9-pin <b>male</b> <b>socket</b> in {{the host}} system, and female connectors on the devices. Classic Atari peripherals used a teardrop shaped rounded plug that was easy to grip {{to make it easier}} to plug in. Almost all compatible devices used similar physical layouts, often to the point of copying the plug design outright.|$|E
5000|$|Special [...] "octal" [...] {{connectors}} {{with either}} 8 or 11 pins, {{almost identical to}} octal relay sockets or tube sockets, were used to connect power supplies to some tube audio amplifiers, transmitters and tranceivers (especially in amateur radio models). Female sockets were installed on the power supply and <b>male</b> <b>sockets</b> (with exposed pins) on the radio equipment. Cable assemblies with mating connectors were also readily available. These connections transferred anode positive voltage (typically 600 VDC for Heathkit, 800 VDC for Collins), grid negative bias (-130 VDC), 6.3 and 12.6 VAC for heaters (filaments), and control functions (remote mains switching).|$|R
50|$|A banana {{connector}} (commonly {{banana plug}} for the <b>male,</b> banana <b>socket</b> or banana jack for the female) is a single-wire (one conductor) electrical connector used for joining wires to equipment. The term 4 mm connector is also used, especially in Europe, {{although not all}} banana connectors will mate with 4 mm parts. The plug is typically a four-leafed spring tip that fits snugly into the jack. The plugs are frequently used to terminate patch cords for electronic test equipment.|$|R

40|$|Mating pair of {{insulators}} forces initial alinement of {{plug and}} <b>socket.</b> <b>Male</b> pins recessed {{behind one of}} alining insulators so they cannot touch female contacts alined. Contacts mate when coupling nut draws alined plug and socket together, depressing one of alining insulators against spring. Compressed spring provides tension on mated threads of assembly helping connector to resist loosening under vibration or shock. Arrangement prevents breakage or bending of male pins on conventional connectors when misalined contacts carelessly pressed together...|$|R
50|$|The MC4 system {{consists}} of a plug and socket design. Oddly, the plugs and sockets are placed inside plastic shells {{that appear to be}} the opposite gender - the plug is inside a cylindrical shell that looks like a female connector but is referred to as <b>male,</b> and the <b>socket</b> is inside a square probe that looks male but is electrically female. The female connector has two plastic fingers that have to be pressed toward the central probe slightly to insert into holes {{in the front of the}} male connector. When the two are pushed together, the fingers slide down the holes until they reach a notch cut into the side of the male connector, where they pop outward to lock the two together.|$|R
40|$|Human face {{is one of}} the {{elements}} in which humans' variability and individuality is reflected. This is especially due to a face variability of shape. The aim of this thesis is to evaluate variability of human's face and its sexual dimorphism. The base for the study is a set of 50 females with average age 21, 6 and 50 males with average age 21, 1. The data set was processed using the methods of geometric morphometrics. The main outcome is an average surface model of males and females which could be used in biomedical and forensic antropology. In this data set, variability of face is set by differences of size, height and width including characteristics which shows significant sexual dimorphism. The male's forhead is slighlty arched with markedly developed superciliary and the area of glabella. There is deeper position of eyes in an eye <b>socket.</b> <b>Males</b> are also likely to have a wide and flat nose with sharper transition of frontal bone (os frontale) into nasal bones (os nasale). Generally, males have bigger and relativelly more narrow face with slightly prominent zygomatic bones (os zygomaticum). Males also have less volume of face soft tissues. On the other hand, males have more massive area of low face with more highlihted musculature around oral cavity which become into a wide prominent chin. Key [...] ...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Finite element {{analysis}} has been universally employed for {{the stress and}} strain analysis in lower extremity prosthetics. The socket adapter was the principal subject of interest due to its importance in deciding the knee motion range. OBJECTIVES: This article focused on the static and dynamic stress analysis of the designed hybrid adapter developed by the authors. A standard mechanical design validation approach using von Mises was followed. Four materials were considered for the analysis, namely, carbon fiber, oil-filled nylon, Al- 6061, and mild steel. STUDY DESIGN: The paper analyses the static and dynamic stress on designed hybrid adapter which incorporates features of conventional <b>male</b> and female <b>socket</b> adapters. The finite element analysis was carried out for possible different angles of knee flexion simulating static and dynamic gait situation. METHODS: Research was carried out on available design of socket adapter. Mechanical design of hybrid adapter was conceptualized and a CAD model was generated using Inventor modelling software. Static and dynamic stress analysis was carried out on different materials for optimization. RESULTS: The finite element analysis was carried out on the software Autodesk Inventor Professional Ver. 2011. The peak value of von Mises stress occurred in the neck region of the adapter and in the lower face region at rod eye-adapter junction in static and dynamic analyses, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Oil-filled nylon {{was found to be}} the best material among the four with respect to strength, weight, and cost. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Research investigations on newer materials for development of improved prosthesis will immensely benefit the amputees. The study analyze the static and dynamic stress on the knee joint adapter to provide better material used for hybrid design of adapter...|$|R
