25|$|The {{color pattern}} {{consists}} of a pale tan to pinkish tan ground color that becomes darker towards the foreline, overlaid {{with a series of}} 10–18 (13.4) crossbands. Characteristically, both the ground color and crossband pattern are pale in A. c. contortrix. These crossbands are light tan to pinkish tan to pale brown in the center, but darker towards the edges. They are about 2 scales wide or less at the midline of the back, but expand to a width of 6–10 scales {{on the sides of the}} body. They do not extend down to the ventral scales. Often, the crossbands are divided at the midline and alternate on either side of the body, with some individuals even having more half bands than complete ones. A series of dark brown spots is also present on the flanks, next to the belly, and are largest and darkest in the spaces between the crossbands. The belly is the same color as the ground color, but <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> whitish in part. At the base of the tail there are 1–3 (usually 2) brown crossbands followed by a gray area. In juveniles, the pattern on the tail is more distinct: 7–9 crossbands are visible, while the tip is yellow. On the head, the crown is usually unmarked, except for a pair of small dark spots, one near the midline of each parietal scale. A faint postocular stripe is also present; diffuse above and bordered below by a narrow brown edge.|$|E

[...] Warren Truitt of About.com agreed but stated, [...] " [...] <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> cookie-cutter, {{but at least the}} songwriters realize who their audience is and they deliver the goods".

500|$|Neoromicia malagasyensis is a {{relatively}} small [...] "pipistrelle", but larger than N.somalica.

Relative to the two other Malagasy Neoromicia species, the tibia is short. A single baculum (penis bone), 2.2mm long, has been studied. It resembles the baculum of N.melckorum, but is smaller. As in N.matroka, the distal (far) end is flat and displaced downwards, but the N.malagasyensis baculum has a smaller area and less well-developed flanges at the sides and a smaller vertical extension of the bone.|$|E

The protests brought debates and discussions to our homes." [...] She also said that since the rape and protests the media is now providing coverage of sexual violence. However, she saw [...] "absolutely no change in the rape culture and related brutality. The streets are not safe. Teasing [...] and catcalling or worse are to be found everywhere. Sexual harassment in public places as well as inside the home is still rampant." [...] She added, [...] "I do acknowledge, however, that a year is too less to undo what patriarchy has done over centuries. It is too embedded in our homes, our institutions and in our laws.

[...] Oliver Sava of The A.V. Club gave the episode a B-, with his {{highlights}} the reveal that Simmons is on another planet, which would allow the series interesting story opportunities. Conversely, Sava felt elements of the episode were too procedural and [...] "a surplus of infodumps that drag the pacing," [...] and, unlike Goldman, felt leaving out May and Ward was [...] "a big reason why this premiere is an underwhelming reintroduction to this world." [...] He concluded, [...] "There’s lots of potential for this season to address the moral complications of S.H.I.E.L.D.’s mission, and hopefully the writers will use the themes of Civil War to explore the murky ethics of capturing and holding superpowered people against their will ... the transition into the age of Inhumanity <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> rocky, but there’s enough substance in this premiere to suggest a promising season ahead."

500|$|Entertainment Weeklys Ken Tucker {{gave the}} episode an A, posing the question: [...] "Has there {{ever been a}} TV show more aptly named than Glee? It both embodies and inspires exactly that quality." [...] Glee was the top ranked topic on social {{networking}} site Twitter {{on the night of}} its initial airing. Alessandra Stanley for The New York Times called the show [...] "blissfully unoriginal in a witty, imaginative way", saying the characters are [...] "high school archetypes" [...] but noted [...] "a strong satiric pulse that doesn’t diminish the characters’ identities or dim the showmanship of a talented cast". The Daily News David Hinckley wrote that the show [...] "isn't close to perfect" [...] but [...] "has likable characters, {{a good sense of humor}} and a reasonably deft touch with music." [...] He called the pilot episode [...] "not very plausible" [...] but [...] "potentially heartwarming", writing of the musical choices: [...] "The duet of [...] "You're the One That I Want" [...] from Grease <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> obvious, but setting a group dance routine to Amy Winehouse's [...] "Rehab" [...] shows some inspiration. Whether Glee can hold that note remains a very unanswered question. But it will at least be worth watching to see." [...] USA Today Robert Bianco assessed: [...] "There's a lot to like here: the exuberance of the musical numbers, the bite to the comedy and the joy of seeing something different. It has casting and tone problems, but it has all summer to fix them." ...|$|E
500|$|Reviews of the episode's {{release on}} DVD were mostly positive, calling the episode [...] "wickedly funny, {{no matter how}} offensive." [...] Frazier Moore of the Associated Press commented that [...] "What, in other hands, {{could have been a}} serious, even heart-wrenching story is on Family Guy a devilish burlesque — not to mention a wickedly astute {{examination}} of the current abortion clash." [...] Moore also noted, however, that [...] "the uninitiated, the faint-of-heart and, most of all, the anti-abortion crowd should maybe choose to take a pass." [...] Dave Itzkoff of The New York Times deemed the episode [...] "typical of that audacious Fox animated comedy, teeming with rapid-fire jokes and willfully offensive non sequiturs about disabled animals, God, Nazis, bodily functions and the sexual habits of 'Sesame Street' characters." [...] In a slightly more mixed review of the DVD release, Cindy White of IGN criticized the episode for its shock value, but appreciated [...] "that the writers didn't cop out in the end, and actually picked a side." [...] White went on to comment that it was [...] "hard to believe that the writers ever expected 'Partial Terms of Endearment' to make it to air" [...] and that [...] "even devoted, longtime fans of the show <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> uncomfortable with the subject matter." [...] White gave the release a 7 out of 10 rating. Assessing Family Guys impact on television, Mary Elizabeth Williams of Salon commented on the portrayal of abortion: [...] "That Family Guy, that doofy, generally unfunny bastion of sophomoric jokes, should {{be one of the few}} shows brave enough to even address the topic is bananas [...] And that Fox wouldn't air the episode says we're still a long way from having anybody on 'Glee' or 'The Office' or 'House' look at those telltale lines on the stick and finally decide what millions of American women have — that they're just not ready for motherhood." ...|$|E

500|$|Released to {{positive}} reviews, with aggregated scores of 87/100 on Metacritic and 88.7% on GameRankings, some journalists considered Super Monkey Ball {{the highlight of}} the GameCube's launch lineup. The staff of Edge praised the main game as [...] "absorb" [...] due to its high level of difficulty, noting that the trial and error required to complete challenging levels forces one to learn the nuances of its [...] "reductive control system" [...] and eventually enables the player to perform seemingly impossible tasks with increasing ease: [...] "Once a level falls, the mysticism around it vanishes. It's beatable; it's an afterthought on the route to your next impossible hurdle." [...] Writing for GameSpy, Ben Turner commented on the [...] "excellent progression of difficulty" [...] engendered by three distinct difficulty modes and thoughtful stage design, expounding [...] "most levels introduce some new idea or concept to the game" [...] and [...] "every single level played adds to your skill." [...] IGN's Matt Casamassina commended the [...] "great level variation", with [...] "well created mazes and puzzles that must be completed using a combination of physics calculations, careful planning and a huge helping of patience." [...] Turner complimented the frequent introduction of incentives to keep playing such as additional continues and hidden levels, adding that a high [...] "ceiling of mastery" [...] enhanced the game's longevity through a [...] "simple but well conceived" [...] scoring system and the ability to test strategies in practice mode. Edge and Casamassina thought similarly, with the latter stating [...] "there are shortcuts that can be carved out by the crafty player, physics to be considered when navigating and more." [...] N-Sider's Tim Knowles pointed out that [...] "the latter levels in the game get extremely difficult and you will often get frustrated", while Casamassina felt [...] "it <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> too difficult for the casual gamer." [...] However, N-Sider's Mark Medina called the learning curve [...] "perfectly spot on": [...] "Any falling off the platforms feels entirely your fault and at the same time, you always get the sense that you're just that little bit closer to that elusive goal." [...] Edge and N-Sider's Jason Nuyens and Will Stevenson agreed with this sentiment, with the latter emphasizing the addictive quality of the gameplay. On a technical note, GamePros Four-Eyed Dragon faulted the camera system, which [...] "can get out of position, making it hard to maneuver in tight spots." [...] In The Japan Times, Steven L. Kent described the game as [...] "a test of nerve" [...] requiring [...] "advanced eye–hand coordination." [...] Turner reflected on the game's ability to evoke feelings of [...] "nervous excitement", [...] "intensity", and [...] "electrifying, stomach-wrenching fear": [...] "It's a thrilling feeling to be winding down a paper-thin path with ten seconds on the clock, hoping against hope that you can keep your balance for just a few more seconds and make it to the goal before time expires."
