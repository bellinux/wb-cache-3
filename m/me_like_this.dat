5|$|The website Allmusic {{called the}} song 'a tormented ballad about romantic loss and regret {{built on a}} spooky yet heart-wrenching piano melody'. The torment {{is present in the}} song's opening ('There were nights when the wind was so cold'), from which the singer recovers ('I {{finished}} crying in the instant that you left... And I banished every memory you and I had ever made'). However, the defiance in the verses are replaced by the return of the 'subservient' feelings in the chorus ('when you touch <b>me</b> <b>like</b> <b>this,</b> and you hold me like that...'); this juxtaposition continues throughout the song.|$|E
500|$|Atlanta's climate {{was cited}} as a {{potential}} issue that would hinder production. Darabont recalled that he {{found it difficult to}} adjust to the sweltering heat, adding that he [...] "never had clothes stick to <b>me</b> <b>like</b> <b>this</b> in my life". Lincoln retorted that it was [...] "becoming a running joke that people arrive on set ready for the day and then they are battered and beaten up by the weather." [...] Despite such assertions, he opined that it added to the episode's overall emotion. [...] "There's a lot of hard-earned sweat on camera. It's not comfortable and it's not pleasant, but it's as you would imagine it would be trying to survive in this world." ...|$|E

5000|$|When it {{aired on}} MTV, the chorus was {{slightly}} altered. The unedited version goes, [...] "You're not the one, but you're {{the only one}} who can make <b>me</b> feel <b>like</b> <b>this</b> / You're not the one, but you're {{the only one who}} can make <b>me</b> feel <b>like</b> shit!"
