40|$|The role of {{pheromone}} biosynthesis activating neuropeptide (PBAN) in {{the regulation}} of pheromone biosynthesis of several female moth species is well elucidated, but {{its role in the}} males has been a mystery for over two decades since its discovery from both male and female central nervous systems. In previous studies we have identified the presence of the gene transcript for the PBAN-G-protein coupled receptor (PBAN-R) in Helicoverpa armigera male hair-pencil-aedaegus complexes (male complexes), a tissue structurally homologous to the female pheromone gland. Moreover, we showed that this transcript is up-regulated during pupal-adult development, analogous to its regulation in the female pheromone-glands, thereby indicating a likely functional gene. Here we argue in favor of PBAN’s role in regulating the free fatty-acid components (myristic, palmitic, stearic, and oleic acids) and alcohol components (hexadecanol, cis- 11 hexadecanol, and octadecanol) in male complexes.

40|$|Ever since Darwin's {{pioneering}} research, {{the evolution}} of self-fertilisation (selfing) has been {{regarded as one of}} the most prevalent evolutionary transitions in flowering plants. A major mechanism to prevent selfing is the self-incompatibility (SI) recognition system, which consists of male and female specificity genes at the S-locus and SI modifier genes. Under conditions that favour selfing, mutations disabling the <b>male</b> recognition <b>component</b> are predicted to enjoy a relative advantage over those disabling the female <b>component,</b> because <b>male</b> mutations would increase through both pollen and seeds whereas female mutations would increase only through seeds. Despite many studies on the genetic basis of loss of SI in the predominantly selfing plant Arabidopsis thaliana, it remains unknown whether selfing arose through mutations in the female specificity gene (S-receptor kinase, SRK), male specificity gene (S-locus cysteine-rich protein, SCR; also known as S-locus protein 11, SP 11) or modifier genes, and whether any of them rose to high frequency across large geographic regions. Here we report that a disruptive 213 -base-pair (bp) inversion in the SCR gene (or its derivative haplotypes with deletions encompassing the entire SCR-A and a large portion of SRK-A) is found in 95 % of European accessions, which contrasts with the genome-wide pattern of polymorphism in European A. thaliana. Importantly, interspecific crossings using Arabidopsis halleri as a pollen donor reveal that some A. thaliana accessions, including Wei- 1, retain the female SI reaction, suggesting that all female components including SRK are still functional. Moreover, when the 213 -bp inversion in SCR was inverted and expressed in transgenic Wei- 1 plants, the functional SCR restored the SI reaction.

40|$|Abstract. In {{hermaphrodite}} plants, {{variations in}} structural gender (defined as the ratio {{between male and}} female gametes) may occur at different levels (among flowers, plants, and populations). In this study, we investigated variation in four traits influencing structural gender (number of carpels, ovules per carpel, stamens, and pollen grains per stamen) within and among six distant populations of the hermaphrodite perennial herb Helleborus foetidus (Ranunculaceae) in the Iberian Peninsula. Our results show that the four traits investigated varied significantly at all levels considered. Traits influencing the female sexual component (number of carpels and ovules per carpel) showed greater variation at the lowermost levels (within flower and plant) than traits influencing the <b>male</b> <b>component,</b> which in turn varied more markedly among pop-ulations. Number of carpels per flower and number of pollen grains per anther were the most important traits affecting between-plant variation in structural gender. There was no evidence of significant plant-level trade-offs or correlations between the various male and female traits, which covaried differently across populations. The observed between-popula-tion variation in structural gender of Helleborus foetidus can be explained as a consequence of differences in self-pollination levels related to a flower’s ‘‘mating environment’’...|$|E
40|$|The {{evolutionary}} {{transition from}} outcrossing to self-fertilization (selfing) through {{the loss of}} self-incompatibility (SI) {{is one of the}} most prevalent events in flowering plants, and its genetic basis has been a major focus in evolutionary biology. In the Brassicaceae, the SI system consists of male and female specificity genes at the S-locus and of genes involved in the female downstream signaling pathway. During recent decades, much attention has been paid in particular to clarifying the genes responsible for the loss of SI. Here, we investigated the pattern of polymorphism and functionality of the female specificity gene, the S-locus receptor kinase (SRK), in allotetraploid Arabidopsis kamchatica. While its parental species, A. lyrata and A. halleri, are reported to be diploid and mainly self-incompatible, A. kamchatica is self-compatible. We identified five highly diverged SRK haplogroups, found their disomic inheritance and, for the first time in a wild allotetraploid species, surveyed the geographic distribution of SRK at the two homeologous S-loci across the species range. We found intact full-length SRK sequences in many accessions. Through interspecific crosses with the self-incompatible and diploid congener A. halleri, we found that the female components of the SI system, including SRK and the female downstream signaling pathway, are still functional in these accessions. Given the tight linkage and very rare recombination of the <b>male</b> and female <b>components</b> on the S-locus, this result suggests that the degradation of <b>male</b> <b>components</b> was responsible for the loss of SI in A. kamchatica.

We also examine the behavioral components of sex role reversal. In the reversed condition, rejections of mating attempts are almost solely by the male and contests are almost solely between females. Role-reversed males sing less frequently and at a much reduced intensity. We use geographic variation in the calling song of this species to assess the strength of female phonotactic discrimination between races. This is not significantly reduced despite sex role reversal.

Several female signaling components essential for pollen tube reception have been identified [4 – 11]); however, <b>male</b> <b>components</b> remain unknown. We show that the expression of three closely related MYB transcription factors is induced in pollen tubes by growth in the pistil. Pollen tubes lacking these three transcriptional regulators fail to stop growing in synergids, specialized cells flanking the egg cell that attract pollen tubes [12 – 16] and degenerate upon pollen tube arrival [17, 18]. myb triple-mutant pollen tubes also fail to release their sperm cargo. We define a suite of pollen tube-expressed genes regulated by these critical MYBs and identify transporters, carbohydrate-active enzymes, and small peptides as candidate molecular mediators of pollen tube-female interactions necessary for flowering plant reproduction. Our data indicate that de novo transcription in the pollen tube nucleus during growth in the pistil leads to pollen tube differentiation required for release of sperm cells...|$|R
