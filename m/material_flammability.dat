From these studies, oxygen partial pressures can be compared for both the MOC and MTP methods to determine the role of partial pressure in <b>material</b> <b>flammability.</b> This evaluation also assesses the influence of other variables on flammability performance.

The equivalent low stretch apparatus (ELSA) uses an inverted cone heater to minimize buoyant effects while at the same time providing a forced stagnation flow on the sample, which ignites and burns as a ceiling fire. Ignition delay and burning rate data is correlated with incident heat flux and convective heat transfer and compared to results from other test methods and fuel geometries using similarity to determine the equivalent stretch rates and thus convective cooling (or heating) rates for those geometries. With this correlation methodology, buoyant effects inherent in normal gravity <b>material</b> <b>flammability</b> test methods can be estimated, to better apply the test results to low stretch environments relevant to spacecraft material selection...|$|E

40|$|<b>Material</b> <b>flammability</b> is an {{important}} factor in determining the pressure and composition (fraction of oxygen and nitrogen) of the atmosphere in the habitable volume of exploration vehicles and habitats. The method chosen in this work to quantify the flammability of a material is by its ease of ignition. The ignition delay time was defined as the time it takes a combustible material to ignite after it has been exposed to an external heat flux. Previous work in the Forced Ignition and Spread Test (FIST) apparatus has shown that the ignition delay in the currently proposed space exploration atmosphere (approximately 58. 6 kPa and 32 % oxygen concentration) is reduced by 27 % compared to the standard atmosphere used in the Space Shuttle and Space Station. In order to determine whether there is a safer environment in terms of <b>material</b> <b>flammability,</b> a series of piloted ignition delay tests using polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) was conducted in the FIST apparatus to extend the work over a range of possible exploration atmospheres. The exploration atmospheres considered were the normoxic equivalents, i. e. reduced pressure conditions with a constant partial pressure of oxygen. The ignition delay time was seen to decrease as the pressure was reduced along the normoxic curve. The minimum ignition delay observed in the normoxic equivalent environments was nearly 30 % lower than in standard atmospheric conditions. The ignition delay in the proposed exploration atmosphere is only slightly larger than this minimum. Interms of <b>material</b> <b>flammability,</b> normoxic environments with a higher pressure relative to the proposed pressure would be desired...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} reduce the risk of {{decompression}} sickness associated with extravehicular activity (EVA), NASA is designing the next generation of exploration vehicles and habitats with a different cabin environment than used previously. The proposed environment uses a total cabin pressure of 52. 7 to 58. 6 kPa with an oxygen concentration of 30 to 34 % by volume and was chosen with <b>material</b> <b>flammability</b> in mind. Because materials may burn differently under these conditions and there is little information on how this new environment affects the flammability of the materials onboard, it is important to conduct <b>material</b> <b>flammability</b> experiments at the intended exploration atmosphere. One method to evaluate <b>material</b> <b>flammability</b> is by its ease of ignition. To this end, piloted ignition delay tests were conducted in the Forced Ignition and Spread Test (FIST) apparatus subject to this new environment. In these tests, polymethylmethacylate (PMMA) was exposed to a range of oxidizer flow velocities and externally applied heat fluxes. Tests were conducted for a baseline case of normal pressure and oxygen concentration, low pressure (58. 6 kPa) with normal oxygen (21 %), and low pressure with 32 % oxygen concentration conditions to determine the individual effect of pressure and the combined effect of pressure and oxygen concentration on the ignition delay. It was found that reducing the pressure while keeping the oxygen concentration at 21 % reduced the ignition time by 17 % on average. Increasing the oxygen concentration at low pressures reduced the ignition time by an additional 10 %. It was also noted that the critical heat flux for ignition decreases at exploration atmospheres. These results show that tests conducted in standard atmospheric conditions will underpredict the ignition of materials intended for use on spacecraft and that, at these conditions, materials are more susceptible to ignition than at current spacecraft atmospheres...|$|E

40|$|Materials {{selection}} for spacecraft {{is based on}} conventional flammability or ignition sensitivity acceptance tests. Current procedures for determining the inter-laboratory repeatability and reproducibility of aerospace <b>materials</b> <b>flammability</b> tests are not considering the dependence of data variability on test conditions and consequently attempts to characterize the precision of these methods were not successful. The inter-laboratory data variability is determined with tests conducted under arbitrary conditions, which consequently may not provide sufficient information to enable adequate determination of a method's precision. For evaluating the precision of NASA's flammability test methods, the protocol recommended includes selecting critical parameters and determining the 50 % failure point by considering the specific failure criteria of each method using the critical parameter as a variable. Upon performing inter-laboratory round robin testing using this approach, the laboratories' performance could be evaluated by comparing the repeatability of the 50 % failure point and/or the repeatability of critical conditions where the probabilities of passing and failing are unity, i. e., the transition zone repeatability.

40|$|Spacecraft {{fire safety}} {{emphasizes}} fire prevention, which is achieved primarily {{through the use}} of fire-resistant materials. Materials selection for spacecraft is based on conventional flammability acceptance tests, along with prescribed quantity limitations and configuration control for items that are non-pass or questionable. ISO 14624 - 1 and - 2 are the major methods used to evaluate <b>flammability</b> of polymeric <b>materials</b> intended for use in the habitable environments of spacecraft. The methods are upward flame-propagation tests initiated in static environments and using a well-defined igniter flame {{at the bottom of the}} sample. The tests are conducted in the most severe flaming combustion environment expected in the spacecraft. The pass/fail test logic of ISO 14624 - 1 and - 2 does not allow a quantitative comparison with reduced gravity or microgravity test results; therefore their use is limited, and possibilities for in-depth theoretical analyses and realistic estimates of spacecraft fire extinguishment requirements are practically eliminated. To better understand the applicability of laboratory test data to actual spacecraft environments, a modified ISO 14624 protocol has been proposed that, as an alternative to qualifying materials as pass/fail in the worst-expected environments, measures the actual upward flammability limit for the material. A working group established by NASA to provide recommendations for exploration spacecraft internal atmospheres realized the importance of correlating laboratory data with real-life environments and recommended NASA to develop a flammability threshold test method. The working group indicated that for the Constellation Program, the flammability threshold information will allow NASA to identify <b>materials</b> with increased <b>flammability</b> risk from oxygen concentration and total pressure changes, minimize potential impacts, and allow for development of sound requirements for new spacecraft and extravehicular landers and habitats. Furthermore, recent research has shown that current normal gravity <b>materials</b> <b>flammability</b> tests do not correlate with flammability in ventilated, micro- or reduced-gravity conditions. Currently, the materials selection for spacecraft is based on the assumption of commonality between ground flammability test results and spacecraft environments, which does not appear to be valid. <b>Materials</b> <b>flammability</b> threshold data acquired in normal gravity can be correlated with data obtained in microgravity or reduced-gravity experiments, and consequently a more accurate assessment of the margin of safety of the material in the real environment can be made. In addition, the method allows the option of selecting better or best space system materials, as opposed to what would be considered just acceptable from a flammability point of view and realistic assessment of spacecraft fire extinguishment needs, which could result in significant weight savings. The knowledge afforded by this technique allows for limited extrapolations of flammability behavior to conditions not specifically tested and that could potentially result in significant cost and time savings. The intent of this Technical Specification is to bring to the attention of International Aerospace Community the importance of correlating laboratory test data with real-life space systems applications. The method presented is just one of the possibilities that are believed will lead to better understanding the applicability of laboratory aerospace <b>materials</b> <b>flammability</b> test data. International feedback on improving the proposed method, as well as suggestions for correlating other laboratory aerospace test data with real-life applications relevant to space systems are being sought...|$|R

Environmental and safety concerns are leading to progressive phasing out of versatile and effective halogen-based fire retardants which, so far, ensured a satisfactory polymer fire hazard control. Among the intensive efforts which are being made to develop new, environmentally safe, polymer fire protection approaches, the recognition of the paramount role played by the polymer surface during combustion and the exploitation of the new nanotechnologies developed for polymer surface engineering offer a promising perspective for polymer fire retardance. Indeed, heat transfer to the polymer and diffusion to the gas phase of polymer degradation combustible volatiles, which both fuel the combustion, occur across the polymer surface which characteristics regulate the polymer combustion process. It is shown that by engineering the polymer material surface by intumescent coatings or layer by layer nano-deposition or by oxidic nanostructures sol-gel synthesis, polymer combustion can be conveniently slowed down to extinguishment, complying fire safety rules of specific applications, through the creation of a surface barrier to heat and mass transfer across the polymer surfac...|$|R
