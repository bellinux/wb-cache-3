She stated that [...] "It is a songs that I listen to and wish I had written. It’s really so special. I {{think a lot of}} people have found strength and hope in the lyrics. It's been really rewarding to meet and talk to people at our meet and greet events come up and tell <b>me</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> that song means to them and how it has helped them". Irish singer Chloë Agnew recorded the track for her debut album Chloë (2002).|$|E
500|$|By the 1951 season, media sources {{had given}} the {{nickname}} [...] "Big Four" [...] to the pitching combination of Garcia, Bob Feller, Bob Lemon and Early Wynn. Garcia had learned to control the curveball that Harder taught him in spring training of 1949. Harder said that Garcia already had a terrific fastball, but that he became a good pitcher by learning the curveball and working on his control. Cleveland sportswriter Hal Lebovitz wrote, [...] "Garcia, {{until the day he}} died, would tell <b>me</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> of the success he owed to Harder." [...] Garcia also once admitted to throwing an occasional spitball, an illegal pitch. [...] "Maybe a dozen in my life. I'm sure plenty of the great pitchers did", he said.|$|E
500|$|Conversely, Ghosh {{assessed}} her {{low point}} as being her romancing of Will, writing, [...] "Sure, Schue's got it going on, {{what with the}} rapping, the break dancing, the boy band'ing and the lindy hopping too. But Rachel's eye-on-the-prize, I'll-get-what-I-want attitude coupled with her inappropriate crush on the teacher just made her creepier than usual. Infiltrating his home, cooking and cleaning for him right under his crazy wife's nose. Come on, Berry, you're better than that..." [...] Raymund Flandez for The Wall Street Journal commented on the episode [...] "Preggers", [...] "Rachel has become insufferable. The disagreements with Mr. Schue about her own development as a bonafide triple-threat have branded her as an overbearing prima donna {{to the rest of}} Glee." [...] Eric Goldman for IGN agreed, [...] "It's hard not to be annoyed by Rachel". James Poniewozik of Time has suggested that Rachel's negative character traits may actually be an asset, commenting on her performance of [...] "Don't Rain on My Parade" [...] in the episode [...] "Sectionals", [...] "The number reminded <b>me</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> I like what the show's done with Rachel: she's a lead character, yet the show allows her to be annoying—but at the same time, her dedication makes her likeable. And as we see here, as much of a pill as she can be, her ability to whip out a performance she's been working on since age four is an asset." ...|$|E

500|$|Initially, Che {{was going}} to be made in English and was met with a strong {{interest}} in financing; however, when {{the decision was made to}} make it in Spanish and break it up into two films, the studios' pay-TV deals, which were for English-language product only, [...] "disappeared", according to Bickford, [...] "and, at that point, nobody wanted to step up". The director defended his decision to shoot almost all of the film in Spanish in an interview: [...] "You can't make a film with any level of credibility in this case unless it's in Spanish. I hope we're reaching a time where you go make a movie in another culture, that you shoot in the language of that culture. I'm hoping the days of that sort of specific brand of cultural imperialism have ended". Both films were financed without any American money or distribution deal; [...] Soderbergh remarked, [...] "It was very frustrating to know that this is a zeitgeist movie and that some of the very people who told <b>me</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> they now regret passing on Traffic passed on this one too". Foreign pre-sales covered $54 million of the $58 million budget. Wild Bunch, a French production, distribution and foreign sales company put up 75% of the budget for the two films, tapping into a production and acquisition fund from financing and investment company Continental Entertainment Capitol, a subsidiary of the U.S.-based Citigroup. Spain's Telecinco/Moreno Films supplied the rest of the budget.|$|E
500|$|Between 1901 and 1903, Leno {{recorded}} {{more than}} twenty-five songs and monologues on the Gramophone and Typewriter Company label. He also made 14 short films {{towards the end of}} his life, in which he portrayed a bumbling buffoon who struggles to carry out everyday tasks, such as riding a bicycle or opening a bottle of champagne. On 26 November 1901, Leno, along with Seymour Hicks and his wife, the actress Ellaline Terriss, was invited to Sandringham House {{to take part in a}} Royal Command Performance to entertain King Edward VII, Queen Alexandra, their son George and his wife, Mary, the Prince and Princess of Wales. [...] Leno performed a thirty-five-minute solo act that included two of his best-known songs: [...] "How to Buy a House" [...] and [...] "The Huntsman". After the performance, Leno reported, [...] "The King, the Queen and the Prince of Wales all very kindly shook hands with me and told <b>me</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> they had enjoyed it. The Princess of Wales was just going to shake hands with me, when she looked at my face, and couldn't do it for some time, because she laughed so much. I wasn't intending to look funny– I was really trying to look dignified and courtly; but I suppose I couldn't help myself." [...] As a memento, the king presented Leno with a jewel-encrusted royal tie pin, and thereafter, Leno became known as [...] "the King's Jester". Leno was the first music hall performer to give a Royal Command Performance during the king's reign.|$|E

2500|$|According to {{an article}} from The New York Times, [...] "over the years, Frazier has lost a fortune through a {{combination}} of his own generosity and naïveté, his carousing, and failed business opportunities. The other headliners from his fighting days—Ali, George Foreman, and Larry Holmes—are millionaires." [...] Asked about his situation, Frazier became playfully defensive, but would not reveal his financial status. [...] "Are you asking <b>me</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> money I have?" [...] he said. [...] "I got plenty of money. I got a stack of $100 bills rolled up over there {{in the back of the}} room." [...] Frazier blamed himself, partly, for not effectively promoting his own image. [...] In a 2006 HBO documentary on the fight in Manila, Frazier was interviewed living in a one-room apartment on the second floor of his gym.|$|E

2500|$|The papal nuncio, the Most Rev.

Let no one have any doubts about it: we are celebrating a religious occasion; we are reflecting on a religious assassination, not a political one. Fr. Kaiser has been murdered because he was, and in the eternity of God still is, a Catholic priest who preached the Gospel. Those who killed him, those who planned his killing, wanted to silence the voice of the Gospel.... Only two days before his death, I met Fr. Kaiser for a long conversation. At the end, he asked my blessing, which I reluctantly gave him. At that moment, I thought {{it would have been better}} if he, an old and worthy missionary, had blessed <b>me.</b> <b>How</b> <b>much</b> more I am convinced of that now that we look at him as a martyr of the faith?".

2500|$|However, he then strangely says to Cleopatra: [...] "All that is won and lost. Give me a kiss. Even this repays me"(3.12.69–70). Antony's speech conveys {{pain and}} anger, but he acts in {{opposition}} to his emotions and words, all {{for the love of}} Cleopatra. Literary critic Joyce Carol Oates explains: [...] "Antony's agony is curiously muted for someone who has achieved and lost so much." [...] This irony gap between word and deed of the characters results in a theme of ambivalence. Moreover, due to the flow of constant changing emotions throughout the play: [...] "the characters do not know each other, nor can we know them, any more clearly than we know ourselves". However, it is believed by critics that opposition is what makes good fiction. Another example of ambivalence in Antony and Cleopatra is in the opening act of the play when Cleopatra asks Anthony: [...] "Tell <b>me</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> you love." [...] Prominent professor at The Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Tzachi Zamir, points out: [...] "The persistence of doubt is in perpetual tension with the opposing need for certainty" [...] and he refers to the persistence of doubt that derives from the contradiction of word and deed in the characters.|$|E
