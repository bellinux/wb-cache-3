25|$|The <b>memory</b> <b>effect</b> is {{evaluated}} {{using the}} ratio of Rmax to Rmin (see figure). This ratio increases with decreasing light intensity and has a value of 1.5–1.6 at 0.1 lux and 1.05–1.10 at 1000 lux for PerkinElmer devices. In some low-resistive RO models this ratio was as high as 5.5, but by 2009 their production has been discontinued. High-resistance photoresistors typically have a less pronounced <b>memory</b> <b>effect,</b> are less sensitive to temperature, and have a more linear response, but are also relatively slow.

These resistivity changes affect the RO temperature, bringing additional instabilities. The stabilization time nonlinearly increases with the light intensity and can vary between hours and days; by convention, it is assumed that the output of an illuminated RO reaches equilibrium within 24 hours.|$|E
40|$|Dynamics of {{a system}} in general depends on its initial state and how the system is driven, but in many-body systems the memory is usually {{averaged}} out during evolution. Here, interacting quantum systems without external relaxations are shown to retain long-time <b>memory</b> <b>effects</b> in steady states. To identify <b>memory</b> <b>effects,</b> we first show quasi-steady state currents form in finite, isolated Bose and Fermi Hubbard models driven by interaction imbalance and they become steady-state currents in the thermodynamic limit. By comparing the steady state currents from different initial states or ramping rates of the imbalance, long-time <b>memory</b> <b>effects</b> can be quantified. While the <b>memory</b> <b>effects</b> of initial states are more ubiquitous, the <b>memory</b> <b>effects</b> of switching protocols are mostly visible in interaction-induced transport in lattices. Our simulations suggest the systems enter a regime governed by a generalized Fick's law and <b>memory</b> <b>effects</b> lead to initial-state dependent diffusion coefficients. We also identify conditions for enhancing <b>memory</b> <b>effects</b> and discuss possible experimental implications. Comment: 11 pages, 11 figures, publish versio...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a simple and}} effective approach for eliminating <b>memory</b> <b>effects</b> in OFDM transmitters. It uses advantages of OFDM systems to provide pre-compensation of the frequency-dependent distortions, which are results of the power amplifiers (PA) <b>memory</b> <b>effects.</b> The process of <b>memory</b> <b>effects</b> quantification is carried out in this paper by obtaining a frequency-dependent PA gain, phase shift and intermodulation products. The <b>memory</b> <b>effects</b> are eliminated at baseband using equalization of the IDFT signal. Implementation of the equalization procedure at baseband makes the process of minimizing <b>memory</b> <b>effects</b> simple and effective, because no additional RF components or feedback loops are used. <b>Memory</b> <b>effects</b> are compensated in DSP part using simple multiplication of the frequency-domain digital signal by coefficients, which are calculated adaptively for each OFDM sub-carrier frequency and input power. The approach is tested with Motorola MOSFET MRF 9742 power amplifier model in Advanced Design System (ADS). Simulations show significant improvement in minimizing <b>memory</b> <b>effects.</b> Received constellation of the 16 -QAM OFDM signal after implementing baseband pre-compensation technique looks alike ideal one, whereas without pre-compensation it shows high dispersion due {{to the presence of}} PA memory...|$|R

Here we explore possibilities of generating <b>memory</b> <b>effects</b> in simple isolated quantum systems. By utilizing geometrical effects from a class of lattices supporting flat-bands consisting of localized states, <b>memory</b> <b>effects</b> could be observed in ultracold atoms in optical lattices. As the optical lattice continuously transforms from a triangular lattice into a kagome lattice with a flat band, history-dependent density distributions manifest quantum <b>memory</b> <b>effects</b> even in noninteracting systems, including fermionic as well as bosonic systems in the proper ranges of temperatures. Rapid growth in ultracold technology predicts a bright future for quantum memory-effect systems, and here two prototypical applications of geometry-induced quantum <b>memory</b> <b>effects</b> are proposed: An accelerometer recording the mechanical change rate in a coupled system and a rate-controlled memvalve where the rate of ramping the lattice potential acts as a control of the remnant density in the lattice.

25|$|In one experiment, {{subjects}} were asked to write down their dreams in a diary.

25|$|Emotional target cues {{have been}} shown to {{eliminate}} age differences in prospective memory. For older participants, emotional prospective memory cues were better remembered than neutral cues. Whether the cues are positive or negative, strong emotional attachment makes the cue more self-relevant and easier to remember. For example, an aversive picture of a snake biting a person or a positive picture of a dog licking its owner are easier to remember because they evoke emotional responses, as opposed to a neutral picture of an animal that does not evoke an emotional response. It is speculated that the amygdala and hippocampus {{may play a role in}} this emotionally enhanced <b>memory</b> <b>effect.</b>|$|E
25|$|In recent research, a {{group of}} {{subjects}} was faced with remembering a list of items and then measured when trying to recall said items. The evoked potentials and hemodynamic activity measured during encoding were found to exhibit reliable differences between subsequently recalled and not recalled items. This effect has been termed the subsequent <b>memory</b> <b>effect</b> (SME). This difference in these specific brain regions determines whether or not an item is recalled. A study by Fernandez et al. {{has shown that the}} differences that predict recall appear both as a negative deflection in the rhinal cortex of an event-related potential (ERP) 400ms after stimulus exposure, and as a positive hippocampal ERP beginning 800ms after stimulus onset. This means that recall only occurs if these two brain regions (rhinal cortex and hippocampus) are activated in synchrony.|$|E

40|$|In this Thesis {{various aspects}} of <b>memory</b> <b>effects</b> in the {{dynamics}} of open quantum systems are studied. We develop a general theoretical framework for open quantum systems beyond the Markov approximation which allows us to investigate different sources of <b>memory</b> <b>effects</b> and to develop methods for harnessing {{them in order to}} realise controllable open quantum systems. In {{the first part of the}} Thesis a characterisation of non-Markovian dynamics in terms of information flow is developed and applied to study different sources of <b>memory</b> <b>effects.</b> Namely, we study nonlocal <b>memory</b> <b>effects</b> which arise due to initial correlations between two local environments and further the <b>memory</b> <b>effects</b> induced by initial correlations between the open system and the environment. The last part focuses on describing two all-optical experiment in which through selective preparation of the initial environment states the information flow between the system and the environment can be controlled. In the first experiment the system is driven from the Markovian to the non- Markovian regime and the degree of non-Markovianity is determined. In the second experiment we observe the nonlocal nature of the <b>memory</b> <b>effects</b> and provide a novel method to experimentally quantify frequency correlations in photonic environments via polarisation measurements...|$|R
40|$|We empirically {{study the}} {{activity}} patterns of individual blog-posting and find significant <b>memory</b> <b>effects.</b> The <b>memory</b> coefficient first decays {{in a power}} law and then turns to an exponential form. Moreover, the inter-event time distribution displays a heavy-tailed nature with power-law exponent dependent on the activity. Our findings challenge the priority-queue model that can not reproduce the <b>memory</b> <b>effects</b> or the activity-dependent distributions. We think there is another kind of human activity patterns driven by personal interests and characterized by strong <b>memory</b> <b>effects.</b> Accordingly, we propose a simple model based on temporal preference, which can well reproduce both the heavy-tailed nature and the strong <b>memory</b> <b>effects.</b> This work helps in understanding both the temporal regularities and the predictability of human behaviors...|$|R
25|$|The {{transfer}} characteristic of RO is usually represented as the electrical {{resistance of the}} photoresistor {{as a function of}} the current through the light source; it is a convolution of three main factors: the dependence of light source intensity on its current, optical coupling and spectral matching between the light source and photoresistor, and the photoresponse of the photoresistor. The first dependence is almost linear and temperature independent for LEDs in the practical range of the controlling current. On the contrary, for incandescent lamps the light-current curve is not linear, and the emission spectrum varies with temperature, and thus with the input current. As to the light detector, its properties depend on temperature, voltage and the history of utilization (<b>memory</b> <b>effect).</b> Therefore, the {{transfer characteristic}} takes a range of values.|$|E
25|$|Circuits with defined {{control voltage}} of the divider can {{compensate}} for the thermal drift of the LED in a RO, {{but not for the}} <b>memory</b> <b>effect</b> and thermal drift of the photoresistor. The latter compensation requires a second (reference) photoresistor, which is illuminated by the same light intensity, at the same temperature as the main (modulating) device. Best compensation is achieved when both photoresistors are formed on the same semiconductor chip. The reference photoresistor is included in a divider of stabilized voltage or in a measuring bridge. The error amplifier compares the voltage at the middle point of the divider with the target value and adjusts the controlling current. In the linear controlling regime the RO becomes an analog multiplier: the current through the photoresistor is proportional to the product of the voltage across the photoresistor and the control voltage.|$|E

2500|$|Negative priming is an {{implicit}} <b>memory</b> <b>effect</b> in which prior {{exposure to a}} stimulus unfavorably influences {{the response to the}} same stimulus. It falls under the category of priming, which [...] refers to the change in the response towards a stimulus due to a subconscious <b>memory</b> <b>effect.</b> Negative priming describes the slow and error-prone reaction to a stimulus that is previously ignored. For example, a subject may be imagined trying to pick a red pen from a pen holder. The red pen becomes the target of attention, so the subject responds by moving their hand towards it. At this time, they mentally block out all other pens as distractors to aid in closing in on just the red pen. After repeatedly picking the red pen over the others, switching to the blue pen results in a momentary delay picking the pen out (however, there is a decline in the negative priming effect when {{there is more than one}} nontarget item that is selected against). The slow reaction due to the change of the distractor stimulus to target stimulus is called the negative priming effect.|$|E

By 1960, ROs based on incandescent lamps and CdS/CdSe photoresistors were used in feedback circuits in the industry, for example, for controlling rotation speed and voltage. In the early 1960s, the introduction of sensitive and compact CdS/CdSe photoresistors resulted in the mass production of cameras with automatic exposure. However, these photoresistors were not adopted in medicine because of their <b>memory</b> <b>effect</b> and rapid aging – they required regular recalibration that was not acceptable for medical practice.|$|E
2500|$|Priming is {{a theory}} in which an {{implicit}} <b>memory</b> <b>effect</b> in which exposure to one stimulus (i.e., perceptual pattern) influences the response to another stimulus. The seminal experiments of Meyer and Schvaneveldt in the early 1970s led to the flowering of research on priming of many sorts.

[...] For example, NURSE is recognized more quickly following DOCTOR than following BREAD. [...] Various experiments supported the theory that activation spreading among related ideas was the best explanation for the facilitation observed in the lexical decision task. [...] The priming paradigm provides excellent control over the effects of individual stimuli on cognitive processing and associated behavior because the same target stimuli can be presented with different primes. [...] Thus differences in performance {{as a function of}} differences in priming stimuli must be attributed to the effect of the prime on the processing of the target stimulus.|$|E
