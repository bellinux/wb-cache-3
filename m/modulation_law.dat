Available chorus/flanger just translate into digital implementations the behaviour and parameters typical of cost-sensitive analogue realizations.

40|$|The {{convergence}} {{of information technology}} and consumer electronics towards battery powered portable devices has increased the interest in high efficiency, low dissipation amplifiers. Class D amplifiers are {{the state of the}} art in low power consumption and high performance amplification. In this thesis we explore the possibility of exploiting nonlinearities introduced by the PWM modulation, by designing an optimized <b>modulation</b> <b>law</b> which scales its carrier frequency adaptively with the input signal's average power while preserving the SNR, thus reducing power consumption. This is achieved by means of a novel analytical model of the PWM output spectrum, which shows how interfering harmonics and their bandwidth affect the spectrum. This allows for frequency scaling with negligible aliasing between the baseband spectrum and its harmonics. We performed low noise power spectrum measurements on PWM modulations generated by comparing variable bandwidth, random test signals with a variable frequency triangular wave carrier. The experimental results show that power-optimized frequency scaling is both feasible and effective. The new analytical model also suggests a new PWM architecture that can be applied to digitally encoded input signals which are predistorted and compared with a cosine carrier, which is accurately synthesized by a digital oscillator. This approach has been simulated in a realistic noisy model and tested in our measurement setup. A zero crossing search on the obtained PWM <b>modulation</b> <b>law</b> proves that this approach yields an equivalent signal quality with respect to traditional PWM schemes, while entailing the use of signals whose bandwidth is remarkably smaller due to the use of a cosine instead of a triangular carrier. ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: A {{framework}} for modeling and control is introduced for robotic manipulators {{with a number}} of energetically self-contained semiactive joints. The control approach consists of three steps. First, a virtual control design is conducted by any suitable means, assuming a fully-actuated system. Then, virtual control inputs are matched by a parameter <b>modulation</b> <b>law.</b> Finally, the storage dynamics are shaped using design parameters. Storage dynamics coincide with the system’s internal dynamics under exact virtual control matching. An internal energy balance equation and associated self-powered operation condition are given for the semiactive joints. This condition is a structural characteristic of the system and independent of the control law. Moreover, the internal energy balance equation is independent of the energy storage parameter (capacitance), which adds flexibility to the approach. An external energy balance equation is also given {{that can be used to}} calculate the work required from the active joints.

The stability of the coupled human-robot system is guaranteed ensuring that the impedance parameters vary in a range evaluated experimentally. Through an extensive experimental study on a 7 -DOF KUKA LWR 4 arm, we show that using redundancy to decouple the equivalent inertia at the end-effector enables a more flexible choice of the impedance parameters and improves the performance during manual guidance. Moreover, variable impedance is more performant with respect to constant impedance due to a favourable compromise between accuracy and execution time and the enhanced comfort perceived by humans during manual guidance...|$|R

The comparison has been performed for different values of the output frequency. For each output frequency the load power has been increased until one of the switching devices reaches the maximum thermal stress, so defining the maxi-mum output power of the converter. For this purpose, a sim-plified thermal model has been used to evaluate the junction temperature of the switches {{on the basis of the}} switch losses.

40|$|International audienceThe {{presence}} or absence of orbital frequencies in the palaeomagnetic field spectrum is the subject of intense discussions. While palaeoclimatic variations, i. e. glacial/interglacial alternation periods, are known to be governed by insolation variations via orbital frequencies, the link between such frequencies and the geomagnetic field maintenance processes (convection and rotation in the fluid metallic core) remains unclear. The study of frequency behaviour of long time-series proxy records requires a robust and linear time-frequency method with local and scale analysis properties. For these reasons, we use algorithms based on complex continuous wavelet theory and the stationary phase method, first developed in acoustics in the years 1988 - 1991, for extracting frequency and amplitude <b>modulation</b> <b>laws</b> of arbitrary signals from the phase of their wavelet transform. This method is robust in the presence of noise and does not require restrictive conditions on the energy of signals. After introducing the basis of the method with some illustrations on periodic signals, we show the efficiency of our algorithms on a synthetic insolation signal (Milankovitch cycles), by extracting the main three orbital frequencies (precession, obliquity and eccentricity); then we show its robustness {{in the presence of a}} high level of noise. Finally, we apply this method to various proxy records of (i) past climate variations (δ 18 O), (ii) the past geomagnetic field intensity variations recorded by ocean sediments and (iii) along the deep-seafloor basalts and (iv) variations of the production of cosmogenic nuclide (10 Be/ 9 Be).

40|$|A {{robust and}} {{flexible}} autopilot architecture for NASA's Space Launch System (SLS) family of launch vehicles is presented. As the SLS configurations represent a potentially {{significant increase in}} complexity and performance capability of the integrated flight vehicle, it was recognized early in the program that a new, generalized autopilot design should be formulated to fulfill the needs of this new space launch architecture. The present design concept is intended to leverage existing NASA and industry launch vehicle design experience and maintain the extensibility and modularity necessary to accommodate multiple vehicle configurations while relying on proven and flight-tested control design principles for large boost vehicles. The SLS flight control architecture combines a digital three-axis autopilot with traditional bending filters to support robust active or passive stabilization of the vehicle's bending and sloshing dynamics using optimally blended measurements from multiple rate gyros on the vehicle structure. The algorithm also relies on a pseudo-optimal control allocation scheme to maximize the performance capability of multiple vectored engines while accommodating throttling and engine failure contingencies in real time with negligible impact to stability characteristics.

A question may arise: How does the manufacturer select the frequency modulation parameters of chirp excitations in clinical practice? The present study aims to select, automatically, the optimal frequency modulation parameters of chirp excitations by maximizing the backscattered power using two post-processing techniques: chirp inversion and chirp reversal imaging. Our simulation setup {{consisted of a}} transducer (central frequency 2. 25 MHz), microbubble with diameter 5 μm reception phase and optimization feedback. Fifty iterations were carried out, during each, the medium was insonified with two either out-of-phase to time reversed chirp excitations having a linear frequency <b>modulation</b> <b>law</b> and a driving pressure 100 kPa. Simulations revealed that optimal command was advantageous over the standard technique in both chirp inversion and reversal techniques. In chirp inversion, the gain reached 7. 2 dB, and the maximum backscattered power was achieved after 24 iterations. The transmitted frequency has decreased by 0. 73 MHz, and the second modulation index increased by 0. 13 MHz/s compared to the standard optimization. In chirp reversal, the gain has reached 17. 4 dB, the transmitted frequency decreased by 0. 8 MHz and the frequency modulation index increased by 0. 03 MHz/s compared to the standard optimization.

40|$|International audienceThree {{sessions}} of acoustics records were performed {{by our own}} in 2009 and 2010 in Bay of Biscay and Ushant area. Autonomous recorders AURAL from Multi Electronique Inc. ([URL] were moored in shallow water (depth ~ 130 m) at a 85 m depth to acquire sounds at a 32672 Hz sampling rate and with a 16 bit resolution. An exhaustive exploration of these data with a home-made whistles detector indicates that the 2009 ‟s records present many 2 -hours patches filled with whistles from common or bottlenose dolphins whereas the 2010 ‟s records present only four 2 -hour patches filled with whistles from Risso dolphins or pilot whales. A rapid inspection of ambient noise level and whistles source level reveals a detection range of 1 kilometer for the whistles. This range together with water depth create a multipath structure resolved by a spectrogram representation. As a first contribution of the communication, an inversion scheme to exploit this chorus of whistles is proposed to estimate the superficial sediment nature. A first part of our inversion scheme exploits one whistle a) to estimate {{the position of the}} emitter thanks to multipath (direct, bottom reflected, surface reflected) relative times of arrival, b) to estimate the elevation angle of bottom reflected path, c) to estimate relative strength between bottom reflected and direct paths and then d) to estimate a set {elevation angle, coefficient of reflexion} for this whistle. A second part of our inversion scheme consists in stacking the sets {elevation angle, coefficient of reflexion} obtained for many whistles to build the reflective properties of the bottom and to estimate a bottom structure that fits well with the measurements. The second contribution of the communication is to investigate and present the features of the whistles (level, directivity, bandwidth, frequency <b>modulation</b> <b>law)</b> and ambient noise (spectrum level) that conditioned the performance of our inversion scheme.

40|$|Emotional {{experience}} has two distinct components in human beings: ‘automatic’ and ‘attended’. The former {{of these is}} based more heavily on the ventral and limbic areas of the brain; the attention part is concerned with cognitive aspects of experience, and involves more dorsal components. A rapidly increasing body of knowledge on these two separate components of human experience is being developed through brain imaging, single cell recording and deficit analyses under emotional as compared to neutral inputs. We start by summarizing this data. We then incorporate the data into a recently developed engineering control model of attention and motor responses. The crucial extension of this model involves a ventral/limbic brain network building representations of salience and valence. A simulation of a simple paradigm is used to demonstrate the considerable dissociation possible between the cognitive and emotional components. The system is developed to give an extension of standard artificial neural network architectures to a new class, in which attention effects are explicitly included through adaptive feedback <b>modulation.</b> Learning <b>laws</b> are developed which extend BEP to the attention case.

The theory suggests how quantized activity patterns which reflect these visual properties can coherently fill-in, or complete, visually ambiguous regions starting with visually informative data features. Phenomena {{such as the}} Cornsweet and Craik-O'Brien effects, phantoms and subjective contours, binocular brightness summation, the equidistance tendency, Emmert's law, allelotropia, multiple spatial frequency scaling and edge detection, figure-ground completion, coexistence of depth and binocular rivalry, reflectance riyalry, Fechner's paradox, decrease of threshold contrast with increased number of cycles in a grating pattern, hysteresis, adaptation level tuning, Weber <b>law</b> <b>modulation,</b> shift of sensitivity with background luminance, and the finite capacity of visual short term memory are {{discussed in terms of}} a small set of concepts and mechanisms. Limitations of alternative visual theories which depend upon Fourier analysis, Laplacians, zero-crossings, and cooperative depth planes are described. Relationships between monocular and binocular processing of the same visual patterns are noted, and a shift in emphasis from edge and disparity computations toward the characterization of resonant activity-scaling correlations across multiple spatial scales is recommended. This recommendation follows from the theory's distinction between the concept of a structural spatial scale, which is determined by local receptive field properties, and a functional spatial scale, which is defined by the interaction between global properties of a visual scene and the network as a whole. Functional spatial scales, but not structural spatial scales, embody the quantization of network activity that reflects a scene's global visual representation.

40|$|Neural {{substrates}} {{for processing}} constant speed visual motion have been extensively studied. Less {{is known about}} the brain activity patterns when the target speed changes continuously, for instance under the influence of gravity. Using functional MRI (fMRI), here we compared brain responses to accelerating/decelerating targets with the responses to constant speed targets. The target could move along the vertical under gravity (1 g), under reversed gravity (- 1 g), or at constant speed (0 g). In the first experiment, subjects observed targets moving in smooth motion and responded to a GO signal delivered at a random time after target arrival. As expected, we found that the timing of the motor responses did not depend significantly on the specific motion law. Therefore brain activity in the contrast between different motion laws was not related to motor timing responses. Average BOLD signals were significantly greater for 1 g targets than either 0 g or - 1 g targets in a distributed network including bilateral insulae, left lingual gyrus, and brain stem. Moreover, in these regions, the mean activity decreased monotonically from 1 g to 0 g and to - 1 g. In the second experiment, subjects intercepted 1 g, 0 g, and - 1 g targets either in smooth motion (RM) or in long-range apparent motion (LAM). We found that the sites in the right insula and left lingual gyrus, which were selectively engaged by 1 g targets in the first experiment, were also significantly more active during 1 g trials than during - 1 g trials both in RM and LAM. The activity in 0 g trials was again intermediate between that in 1 g trials and that in - 1 g trials. Therefore in these regions the global activity <b>modulation</b> with the <b>law</b> of vertical motion appears to hold for both RM and LAM.
