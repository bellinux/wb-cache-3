A national flag flown at sea is known as an ensign.

To fly one's ensign alone in foreign waters, a foreign port or {{in the face of a}} foreign warship traditionally indicates a willingness to fight, with cannon, for the right to do so.

25|$|However, {{this success}} rate {{can only be}} {{achieved}} with the institution of optimum care within fifteen {{minutes to an hour}} of the accident. In the case of knocked-out teeth, being prepared and knowing what to do can <b>mean</b> <b>the</b> <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> a person retaining or losing replanted knocked-out teeth for life. Teeth that have been knocked out when they are fully matured, that is, when the root has completely formed, have a much better prognosis than those teeth that are immature and not fully formed. This is due to the fragility of the root. When teeth have not fully formed, the walls of the root are thinner and thus more fragile. Another complication for the prognosis is the length of time that the tooth has been out of its socket. Teeth that are replanted within fifteen minutes of the accident have an excellent prognosis. Teeth that have been extra-oral and dry stored for more than one hour have a poor prognosis. Teeth that have been placed in an optimal storage medium within one hour of the accident also have an excellent prognosis. All teeth that have been knocked out should be replanted but watched carefully for the development of root resorption. Teeth that do not have root canal treatment within two weeks of replantation also have a poor prognosis.|$|E

That is, I consider the thought {{that some of our}} communicative practices are so vital to our flourishing existence as human persons that we suffer an injustice in certain circumstances when these practices fail. For instance, sometimes the ability to successfully communicate consent or refusal <b>means</b> <b>the</b> <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> maintaining authority over our bodies and becoming victims of rape and assault. Sometimes the ability to communicate successfully about an experience like sexual harassment <b>means</b> <b>the</b> <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> vulnerability to confusion, self-doubt, and further injustice and the ability to understand and combat that injustice from a situation of relative epistemic security. I argue that there are conditions under which {{we should be able to}} communicate certain things, and that sometimes an inability to communicate constitutes an injustice. That is, under my account, a person may become a victim of injustice when certain kinds of communication become impossible for her. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R

Each athlete has their own method of generating as much inrun speed as possible, depending on such intricacies as crouch depth, hip and knee angle, arm placement, or how far the torso is positioned over the knees. Body weight is also a factor (see power-to-weight ratio), which has led to some athletes' health becoming a concern over the years.|$|E

2500|$|New Zealand's Naultinus {{are highly}} prized by {{international}} lizard collectors for three main reasons; firstly {{they have very}} attractive colouration and indeed, have been referred to by some as [...] "the world's most beautiful geckos". Secondly, they are day active and so are out and about when their keepers are awake and thirdly, they are cold tolerant, coming from New Zealand's strongly seasonal temperate habitats – since most collectors are wealthy hobbyists in developed countries in places like North America, Europe and Japan – also temperate areas – this means they do not require heat lamps when kept in terrariums.

All endemic New Zealand lizard species including all species of Naultinus [...] are protected by law both under the New Zealand Wildlife Act (1953) and the United Nations Convention on the Trade in Endangered Species (CITES). In an effort to clamp down on continual poaching, DOC attempted to get tighter controls placed on trade in Naultinus in 2002 under the CITES agreement but the request was denied, however, fines and periods of imprisonment under the New Zealand Wildlife act and trade in endangered species acts were increased in 2004 in an attempt to deter further illegal collecting and trading of these animals.|$|E
