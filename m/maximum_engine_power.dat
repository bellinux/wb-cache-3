5|$|The E Series 3 was {{announced}} in September 2010. It carried the same motor and drivetrain as before, and only {{minor changes to the}} exterior. In this series HSV focused on changes to the interior of the car as well as major upgrades to the computer systems and a new electronic interface called the HSV Enhanced Driver Interface. External changes included the shock wave exhaust tips and grilles and new HID Xenon adaptive projector headlamps. The control panel changes included a new 'Oracle Dash' with upgraded trip computer, tire pressure monitors and fuel statistics; the center console was reworked, introducing the Holden touchscreen IQ system and the HSV EDI performance data logging system (similar to the Nissan GT-R), which displays real-time information on engine speed, brakes, gear shifts, g-forces on the car, steering angle, fuel economy, stability control, Magnetic Ride Control suspension, car dynamics, Bi-Modal Exhaust, battery voltage, oil pressure, power, torque, elevation, exhaust pressure, intake manifold pressure and air intake temp. The system includes preloaded race track locations, stop watches and track maps, satellite navigation, digital radio, Bluetooth, optional DVD player and ability to download data onto a PC using the Motech i2 software. The E Series 3 introduced (SBZA) Side Blind Zone Alert which uses ultrasonic sensors to alert drivers of traffic obstructions in blind spots. Using the HSV EDI the driver can customize operation of the car by for example turning off stability control and controlling the Bi-Modal Exhaust. The E Series 3 offered the option of HSV LPI (Liquid Propane Injection), an LPG Autogas system which allows the use of liquid propane as an alternative fuel. The LPI is controlled by the car's ECU and seamlessly changes from petrol to LPG when the engine has reached optimum temperature (when <b>maximum</b> <b>engine</b> <b>power</b> is required, the system automatically switches back to petrol).|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe paper {{presents}} a numerical analysis of injection timing effect on <b>engine</b> output <b>power</b> and heat rejected by exhaust gas in a turbocharged direct injection diesel engine implemented for a tractor application. The engine performance and exhaust gas enthalpy were studied {{by means of}} an engine computational model built in advanced simulation code AVL Boost. A Rankine-Hirn cycle model was developed due to estimate recovery potential of the exhaust gas. Injection timing optimization was carried out at the most commonly used engine operating points (n= 1650 rpm and variable load). The <b>maximum</b> <b>engine</b> output <b>power</b> was chosen as a target parameter to determine the optimal injection timing. A combination of Rankine-Hirn cycle using water as working fluid and injection timing optimization increased the <b>maximum</b> <b>engine</b> output <b>power</b> by 7. 4 %.

50|$|On {{the other}} hand, was the GT Junior range, which {{featured}} engines with smaller cubic capacities. GT Juniors sold {{in great numbers}} to people who wanted a sporting, stylish car that handled well, but either did not require the <b>maximum</b> in <b>engine</b> <b>power,</b> or could not afford the taxation on larger engine capacities in some markets - most notably, Alfa Romeo's home Italian market.

50|$|Some {{innovations}} {{increase the}} exhaust back-pressure by various means, leading to more torque at the flywheel, {{and therefore more}} braking power.

50|$|Complaints {{from the}} pilots {{led to a}} search for a solution.

The restrictor orifice was made to accommodate just the fuel needed for <b>maximum</b> <b>engine</b> <b>power,</b> the power setting usually used during dogfights. It came in two versions, one for 12 psi manifold pressure and one for boosted engines with 15 psi manifold pressure.|$|E
50|$|On January 13, 1982, Air Florida Flight 90 {{crashed into}} Washington, DC's 14th Street Bridge {{and fell into}} the Potomac River shortly after taking off. A total of 70 passengers, 4 crew and 4 motorists on the bridge were killed. The crash of the Boeing 737-200 was due to an {{anti-icing}} system being left off, which caused an inaccurately high engine pressure ratio (EPR) indication at an extremely low power setting and the crew's failure to either abort the takeoff or apply <b>maximum</b> <b>engine</b> <b>power.</b> The crash prompted modifications to Air Florida's pilot training regarding anti-ice systems.

50|$|Formerly, gasoline/petrol engines {{exhibited}} better {{throttle response}} than diesel engines. This results from higher specific power output and higher <b>maximum</b> <b>engine</b> <b>power,</b> {{as well as}} the fact that lower-powered diesel engines were disproportionately heavier. Recently diesel engines became able to outperform similar-sized petrol engines. Most naturally aspirated gasoline engines have better responsiveness than supercharged or turbocharged engines for engines with similar peak power outputs. However, factors such as improper maintenance, fouled spark plugs or bad injectors can reduce throttle response. Diesel engines are less likely to lose throttle response, since their power comes from self-igniting fuel. Older diesel engines directly connect the accelerator pedal to the injection pump resulting in instant response.|$|E
50|$|An {{improvement}} on the automatic type was the constant-speed propeller. This type automatically adjusts the blade pitch {{according to the}} engine speed, thereby maintaining a constant engine speed for any given manual control setting. Constant-speed propellers allow the pilot to set a rotational speed according {{to the need for}} <b>maximum</b> <b>engine</b> <b>power</b> or maximum efficiency, and a propeller governor acts as a closed-loop controller to vary propeller pitch angle as required to maintain the selected engine speed. In most aircraft this system is hydraulic, with engine oil serving as the hydraulic fluid. However, electrically controlled propellers were developed during World War II and saw extensive use on military aircraft, and have recently seen a revival in use on homebuilt aircraft.|$|E
50|$|At idle, {{the thermal}} {{efficiency}} is zero, since no usable {{work is being}} drawn from the engine. At low speeds, gasoline engines suffer efficiency losses at small throttle openings from the high turbulence and frictional (head) loss when the incoming air must fight its way around the nearly closed throttle; diesel engines do not suffer this loss because the incoming air is not throttled. At high speeds, efficiency in both types of engine is reduced by pumping and mechanical frictional losses, and the shorter period within which combustion has to take place. Engine efficiency peaks in most applications at around 75% of rated engine power, {{which is also the}} range of greatest engine torque (e.g. in most modern passenger automobile engines with a redline of about 6,000 RPM, maximum torque is obtained at about 4,500 RPM, and <b>maximum</b> <b>engine</b> <b>power</b> is obtained at about 6,000 RPM). At all other combinations of engine speed and torque, the thermal efficiency is less than this maximum.|$|E

40|$|Abstract 3 D CFD {{analyses}} {{are used to}} analyse the effects of port-injection of water in a high performance turbocharged GDI engine. Particularly, water injection is adopted to replace mixture enrichment while preserving, if not improving, indicated mean effective pressure and knock resistance. A full-load / <b>maximum</b> <b>power</b> <b>engine</b> operation of a currently made turbocharged GDI engine is investigated comparing the actual adopted fuel-only rich mixture to stoichiometric-to-lean mixtures, for which water is added in the intake port under constant charge cooling in the combustion chamber. In order to find the optimum fuel/water balance, preliminary {{analyses are}} carried out using a chemical reactor to evaluate the effects of charge dilution and mixture modification on both autoignition delays and laminar flame speeds. Thanks to the lower chemical reactivity of the diluted end gases, the water-injected engine allows the spark advance (SA) to be increased; as a consequence, <b>engine</b> <b>power</b> target is met, or even crossed, with a simultaneous relevant reduction of fuel consumption...|$|R
