40|$|IT IS THE {{purpose of}} this article to review the {{importance}} of <b>microforms</b> as <b>library</b> media, to discuss the current status of the micropublishing industry as it relates to libraries, and to describe developments in micropublishing and micrographics which have strong implications for future library services. Emphasis ulill be on a discussion of the problem of selection of microform soft~vare and a delineation of the major sources. A cursory review of hardware problems will also be presented. DEFINITIONS AND DELIMITATIOKS As used in this article, microform is a generic word used to describe a large variety of photographically reduced printed sources which must be mechanically enlarged for satisfactory use. Included are microforms of various sizes and types- 16 mm and 35 mm roll film, microfiche (from the French word fiche meaning- card), and microopague (sometimes referred to as microprint). This article will deal primarily with the microforms commonly used in libraries today. Except for some mention under a discussion of trends and developments, it will therefore not deal with the still-limited use of computer output microfilm (COM); nor will it deal with ultrafiche (where approximately 3200 pages at a reduction ratio of 150 :l are placed on one 4 " x 6 " fiche), since several major projects have not been widely accepted on the marketplace, and "it appears that ultrafiche will have no significant impact upon library microforms," at least in the immediate future. &apos...|$|R

40|$|The Brigham {{family tree}} {{seems to have}} many {{branches}} with deep roots in the Fredonia area. In the Pioneer Cemetery there are eleven grave sites known to be resting places of people bearing the name Brigham. Their first names are John, Abigail, John Jr., Walter, Helen, Sophia, James, James R., Fanny, Fidelio, and Adeline. These people {{can be divided into}} probably five different immediate families, though some of the relationships are slightly unclear. The first branch of the family tree begins with James, the head of his household. James was married to Fanny, as evidenced by adjacent graves bearing the same plot number, and many other sources that confirmed this relationship. These two are parents to James Risley Brigham, who was born to them in 1823, died twenty years later, and was buried in Pioneer Cemetery. James and Fanny were parents to Sophia F. (possibly Fanny), who died at age nine, and to Helen H., who died as an infant. Indexed 19 th Century death records from the Fredonia Censor in Reed <b>Library,</b> <b>microforms</b> room, confirm that these five people whose burial plots are adjacent are in fact one family unit. There were more children, as indicated by census records, but they apparently outlived their parents and were buried in different locations...|$|R
