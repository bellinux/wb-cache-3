5|$|Barnes {{was born}} in 1916 in Annandale, an inner suburb of Sydney. However, in his autobiography, {{he claims to have}} been born in 1918 or 1919 in Queensland, and his <b>military</b> <b>service</b> <b>record</b> has his date of birth as 5 June 1917. He was the third child of Alfred Percival Barnes and Hilda May Barnes (n√©e Jeffery), both from farming {{families}} near Tamworth in northern New South Wales. After marrying, the couple left Tamworth to take up a lease on a remote sheep station near Hughenden in North Queensland. Before Sid was born, Alfred died from typhoid fever, caused by drinking contaminated water on the family property. After his death, Hilda, widowed and pregnant with her latest child, moved to Sydney with her children and stayed with her sister, where Sid was born. From her husband's estate, Hilda Barnes mother was able to purchase and renovate real estate in Stanmore and Leichhardt,New South Wales, to let or sell. Later in life, Barnes would recount how, as a child, he used to collect the rents for his mother.|$|E
25|$|Many Marine Corps 'training liaisons' {{represent}} the Marines at many cross-services schools, to ensure training slots and openings are met and filled by the Marines that requested, or were recommended, for advanced training. Some of these courses {{may not be}} able to facilitate the Marine students, the instructors of these schools resort to complement the Marines' requested syllabus by designing subsidiary courses of the similar. This argument becomes clear on whether Marines may, or may not, actually attend the Basic Underwater Demolition/SEAL training (BUD/S). Nonetheless, in the past, selected operators within Force Recon had attended the courses of instructions provided by BUD/S Instructors and their completion is documented in their <b>military</b> <b>Service</b> <b>Record</b> Book (SRB) or Officer Qualification Record (OQR).|$|E

500|$|Bare-faced Messiah {{covers a}} period from 1911, when Hubbard was born, {{to his death}} in 1986, with some {{additional}} background on his family history. It describes his early life, his success as a science fiction writer in the 1930s and 1940s, his military career during the Second World War, the rise of Dianetics and Scientology in the 1950s, his journeys at sea with his followers in the 1960s and early 1970s and his legal problems and period as a recluse from the mid-1970s to 1986. The author draws on previously unpublished materials, such as Hubbard's teenage diaries and personal correspondence to colleagues, employers and the FBI, as well as government documents like Hubbard's <b>military</b> <b>service</b> <b>record</b> and FBI file. In an [...] "author's note", Miller writes that the book {{would have been impossible}} without the Freedom of Information Act. Among the private papers quoted in the book are a letter written by Hubbard to the FBI denouncing his wife as a Soviet spy, another in which he tells his daughter Alexis that he is not really her father and an internal letter in which he suggests that Scientology should pursue religious status for business reasons. Other sources used by Miller include news articles and comments from interviews that he conducted with Hubbard's old acquaintances and family members.|$|E

2500|$|During John Kerry's {{candidacy}} in the 2004 U.S. presidential campaign, {{a political}} issue that gained widespread public attention was Kerry's Vietnam War record. In television advertisements and a book called Unfit for Command, co-authored by John O'Neill and Jerome Corsi, the Swift Boat Veterans for Truth (SBVT), a 527 group later known as the Swift Vets and POWs for Truth, questioned details of his <b>military</b> <b>service</b> <b>record</b> and circumstances relating to the award of his combat medals. Their campaign against Kerry's presidential bid received widespread publicity, but was later discredited and {{gave rise to the}} neologism [...] "swiftboating", to describe an unfair or untrue political attack. Defenders of John Kerry's service record, including nearly all of his former crewmates, have stated that SBVT's allegations are false.|$|E

2500|$|Similarly, blogs {{were among}} the driving forces behind the [...] "Rathergate" [...] scandal. To wit: (television journalist) Dan Rather {{presented}} documents (on the CBS show 60 Minutes) that conflicted with accepted accounts of President Bush's <b>military</b> <b>service</b> <b>record.</b> Bloggers declared the documents to be forgeries and presented evidence and arguments in support of that view. Consequently, CBS apologized for what it said were inadequate reporting techniques (see Little Green Footballs). Many bloggers view this scandal as the advent of blogs' acceptance by the mass media, both as a news source and opinion and as means of applying political pressure. The impact of these stories gave greater credibility to blogs as a medium of news dissemination. Though often seen as partisan gossips, bloggers sometimes lead the way in bringing key information to public light, with mainstream media having to follow their lead. More often, however, news blogs tend to react to material already published by the mainstream media. Meanwhile, {{an increasing number of}} experts blogged, making blogs a source of in-depth analysis.|$|E
