50|$|<b>Mud</b> <b>logging</b> is the {{creation}} of a detailed record (well log) of a borehole by examining the cuttings of rock brought to the surface by the circulating drilling medium (most commonly drilling mud). <b>Mud</b> <b>logging</b> is usually performed by a third-party <b>mud</b> <b>logging</b> company. This provides well owners and producers with information about the lithology and fluid content of the borehole while drilling. Historically it is the earliest type of well log. Under some circumstances compressed air is employed as a circulating fluid, rather than mud. Although most commonly used in petroleum exploration, <b>mud</b> <b>logging</b> is also sometimes used when drilling water wells and in other mineral exploration, where drilling fluid is the circulating medium used to lift cuttings out of the hole. In hydrocarbon exploration, hydrocarbon surface gas detectors record the level of natural gas brought up in the mud. A mobile laboratory is situated by the <b>mud</b> <b>logging</b> company near the drilling rig or on deck of an offshore drilling rig, or on a drill ship.|$|E

5000|$|The <b>mud</b> <b>logging</b> {{company is}} {{normally}} contracted {{by the oil}} company (or operator). They then organize this information {{in the form of}} a graphic log, showing the data charted on a representation of the wellbore.1The oil company representative (Company Man or [...] "CoMan") together with the tool pusher, and well-site geologist (WSG) provides mud loggers their instruction. The <b>mud</b> <b>logging</b> company is contracted specifically as to when to start well-logging activity and what services to provide. <b>Mud</b> <b>logging</b> may begin on the first day of drilling, known as the [...] "spud in" [...] date but is more likely at some later time (and depth) determined by the oil industry geologist's research. The mud logger may also possess logs from wells drilled in the surrounding area. This information (known as [...] "offset data") can provide valuable clues as to the characteristics of the particular geo-strata that the rig crew is about to drill through.|$|E

5000|$|Pressure shale is shale {{that has}} been exposed to high {{pressures}} that causes it to fracture, usually into large [...] pieces. In <b>mud</b> <b>logging,</b> watching {{for this type of}} shale is one method of monitoring for the possibility of drilling into high pressures that might cause a blowout.|$|E
5000|$|Mud loggers examine {{cuttings}} for mineral composition, visual sign of hydrocarbons {{and recorded}} <b>mud</b> <b>logs</b> of lithology, ROP, gas detection or geological parameters.|$|R
50|$|The drill {{cuttings}} are commonly examined {{to make a}} record (a well log) of the subsurface materials penetrated at various depths. In the oil industry, this is often called a <b>mud</b> <b>log.</b>|$|R
30|$|Stratigraphic {{packages}} invariably contain multiple lithologies and {{are generally}} distinguished {{based on the}} dominant rock type(s) or by relative age. Isotopic age dating and/or whole rock geochemistry can be crucial in distinguishing stratigraphic packages that may appear homogenous in outcrop or in cuttings/core (Edwards and Faulds 2012; Edwards 2013). In our experience, lithologic interpretations from <b>mud</b> <b>logs</b> or driller logs can have highly variable quality and reliability. However, penetration rate data, downhole geophysical logs, and other data that are typically included with <b>mud</b> <b>logs</b> and other drilling data can be useful indicators of major lithologic changes and therefore help distinguish stratigraphic units.|$|R
50|$|<b>Mud</b> <b>logging</b> {{technicians}} in an {{oil field}} drilling operation determine positions of hydrocarbons {{with respect to}} depth, identify downhole lithology, monitor natural gas entering the drilling mud stream, and draw well logs for use by oil company geologist. Rock cuttings circulated to the surface in drilling mud are sampled and analyzed.|$|E
50|$|In the {{petroleum}} industry, lithology, or more specifically <b>mud</b> <b>logging,</b> is the graphic representation of geological formations being drilled through, and drawn {{on a log}} called a mud log. As the cuttings are circulated out of the borehole they are sampled, examined (typically under a 10× microscope) and tested chemically when needed.|$|E
5000|$|The Corrected d-exponent, {{also known}} as cd-exponent or more {{correctly}} dc-exponent (dc-exponent) as used in <b>mud</b> <b>logging</b> and formation pore pressure analysis in the oil industry, is an extrapolation of certain drilling parameters to estimate a pressure gradient for pore pressure evaluation while drilling. Normally this is done in over-pressured zones, but most <b>mud</b> <b>logging</b> contracts require it {{to be done at}} all times. It is {{regarded as one of the}} best tools for pore pressure evaluation. See mud log for an example of the corrected d-exponent plotted on a mud log. The parameter is an extension ("correction", hence the [...] "c" [...] notation) to the d-exponent method previously used for estimating formation pore pressures. The extension consists of a correction for the mud weight in use, compared to [...] "standard" [...] mud for the region.|$|E
50|$|First {{developed}} by Conrad and Marcel Schlumberger in 1927, wireline logs measure formation properties in a well through electrical lines of wire. Different from MWD and <b>mud</b> <b>logs,</b> wireline logs are constant downhole measurements sent through the electrical wireline {{used to help}} geologists, drillers and engineers make real-time decisions about drilling operations. Wireline logs can measure resistivity, conductivity and formation pressure, as well as sonic properties and wellbore dimensions.|$|R
30|$|Once a {{permeable}} zone {{was detected}} in the <b>mud</b> <b>logs,</b> the geophysical logs’ responses corresponding to that zone were also studied (Fig.  2). The geophysical logs enabled the identification of open permeable fractures at the borehole scale and in the best cases assisted in characterizing the flow contribution of the fracture.|$|R
50|$|<b>Mud</b> Bay <b>Logging</b> Company was a 20th-century logging {{company based}} in Olympia, Washington. The company was {{established}} in 1899 as Western Washington Logging Company by Mark Draham, who had previously established Mason County Logging Company. The name changed to <b>Mud</b> Bay <b>Logging</b> Company in 1910. The company was disestablished in 1941.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Mud</b> <b>logging</b> {{is often}} written {{as a single}} word [...] "mudlogging". The {{finished}} product can be called a [...] "mud log" [...] or [...] "mudlog". The occupational description is [...] "mud logger" [...] or [...] "mudlogger". In most cases, the two word usage {{seems to be more}} common. The mud log provides a reliable time log of drilled formations.|$|E
50|$|<b>Mud</b> <b>logging</b> {{includes}} {{observation and}} microscopic examination of drill cuttings (formation rock chips), {{and evaluation of}} gas hydrocarbon and its constituents, basic chemical and mechanical parameters of drilling fluid or drilling mud (such as chlorides and temperature), as well as compiling other information about the drilling parameters. Then data is plotted on a graphic log called a mud log. Example1, Example2.|$|E
50|$|While the {{borehole}} {{is being}} drilled {{according to the}} well plan, new geological information is gathered from <b>mud</b> <b>logging,</b> measurement while drilling (MWD) and logging while drilling (LWD). These usually show some differences from what is expected from the model. As the model is continuously updated with the new geological information (formation evaluation) and the borehole position (well deviation survey), changes start {{to appear in the}} geological substructures and can lead to the well plan being updated to reach the corrected geological targets.|$|E
50|$|In the oil industry, {{the well}} and <b>mud</b> <b>logs</b> are usually {{transferred}} in 'real time' to the operating company, which uses these logs to make operational decisions about the well, to correlate formation depths with surrounding wells, and to make interpretations about {{the quantity and quality}} of hydrocarbons present. Specialists involved in well log interpretation are called log analysts.|$|R

The company's mud and petroleum engineers provide technical services for drilling wells including: Preparing drilling proposals according to geologist reports; (2) wire line and production estimates; mud cleaner equipment, centrifugal hole shaker, fitting tools for casing, Production tubing and technical inspection; geological services to determine the type and depth of drilling beds containing hydrocarbons and gas; drilling fluids materials, power tongues, <b>mud</b> <b>logging,</b> oil separators, silk line services, and drill stem testing.|$|E
50|$|In 1952, in Sacramento, California a {{group of}} Stanford University {{engineering}} and geology graduates founded Exploration Logging Company (EXLOG) to provide geologic <b>mud</b> <b>logging</b> services from mobile logging units using technical innovations in hot-wire gas detection. Vern Jones was the company's first president. EXLOG would become a world leader in surface logging, rig instrumentation and data acquisition. Baker International acquired EXLOG in 1972, and invested in its expansion. By 1982, the company had more than 200 logging units and 1,000 geologists on staff. Its broad expertise in geological services would eventually become the Surface Logging Service product line of Baker Hughes INTEQ.|$|E
50|$|As {{drilling}} proceeds, the mud engineer {{will get}} information from other service providers {{such as the}} mud logger (<b>mud</b> <b>logging</b> technician) about progress through the geological zones, and will make regular physical and chemical checks on the drilling mud. In particular the Marsh funnel viscosity and the density are frequently checked. As drilling proceeds, the mud tends to accumulate small particles of the rocks which are being drilled through, and its properties change. It {{is the job of}} the mud engineer to specify additives to correct these changes, or to partially or wholly replace the mud when necessary. He or she must also {{keep an eye on the}} equipment which is used to pump the mud and to remove particles, and be prepared if the geologists' predictions are not entirely correct, or if other problems arise.|$|E
