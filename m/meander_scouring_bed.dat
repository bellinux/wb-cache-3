40|$|A laboratory-theoretical {{investigation}} on {{the stability of}} jets developing downstream of a drop structure is presented. Two series of laboratory experiments were performed with both a mobile and a flat rigid bed downstream of the drop. The discharge and the downstream water depth were varied and two kinds of jet flow were observed developing downstream of the drop: a surface wave jet and an oscillating jet. The os-cillating jet is an unstable flow configuration. Both velocity and free surface flow measurements were per-formed. Starting from laboratory measurements, a mathematical model, which investigates {{the stability of the}} surface wave jet both over a flat and a <b>scoured</b> <b>bed,</b> was developed. The modified De Saint-Venant equations, i. e. with correction terms accounting for the curvature of the streamlines, were obtained from the theoretical velocity and pressure profiles.

40|$|To improve {{understanding}} of the flow and scour processes associated with spur dikes more fully, 3 -dimensional flow velocities were measured using an acoustic Doppler velocimeter at a closely spaced grid over a fixed flat bed and a fixed <b>scoured</b> <b>bed</b> with a submerged trapezoidal shaped spur dike. Flow velocities were measured at 2592 points for the flat bed and 3484 points for the <b>scoured</b> <b>bed</b> {{in the vicinity of}} the spur dike and the scour hole. General distribution of velocities and detailed near field flow structures were revealed by the measurements. Some important differences between the flow fields measured in this study and those measured for non-submerged vertical obstructions were observed in this study. Numerical simulation was performed using the free surface turbulent flow model, CCHE 3 D. The numerical simulation of the flow velocity field generally showed very good agreement between the computation results and the measurements. Bed shear stress fields derived from measured and simulated data showed some discrepancies. The numerical simulation results indicate the CCHE 3 D model can be used to reasonably predict near-field flows around hydraulic structures; however, further research is needed for accurate prediction of local scour using simulated flows...|$|R

50|$|Traditional {{logging in}} the West {{coast of the}} United States {{included}} many practices which increased river incision. Timber removal and the associated road construction facilitate runoff and thus increased erosion and sediment delivery to streams (Wakabayashi 2001). Increases in sediment increases the water’s stream power, increasing the stream’s ability to do geomorphic work {{on the bed and}} banks (Yang et. al.1974). This leads to <b>scouring</b> of the <b>bed</b> material, exposing the bedrock channel bed to erosion and thus faster rates of channel incision (Kondolf, et. al. 2002). The <b>scoured</b> <b>bed</b> material consists of finer sediments such as silts, sands, and gravels. The removal of these removes important aquatic habitats for salmonid species and other aquatic organisms (Kondolf 1997). In many agricultural areas, rivers have been straightened and dyked for flood control and to plant crops in the floodplain (Doyle, et al.). Normally, floods are allowed to spread out across the floodplain, allowing deposition of sediment and slowing water speeds, reducing the erosive potential of the water (Heiler, et. al. 1995). Channelization concentrates flood flows down the active channel, increasing erosion. River incision due to agriculture is well-documented throughout the agricultural regions of the world, such as the Central Valley of California (Florsheim, et. al. 2011).|$|R

The present study uses an experimental model to simulate the propagation of a hydraulic bore over a movable sediment bed placed around a circular pier-like structure. Measurements of water surface elevation, bore propagation velocity and scour distribution were taken. The linear relationship between reservoir depth and bore depth led to an increase in flow acceleration, and thus to an increase in flow velocity.

The interaction between the stream of the increased turbulence and the bed is a direct cause of formation of scour downstream water structures, which has a great effect on overall flow characteristics. The scour hole that arose downstream the jump moderated, in a small degree, the turbulence intensity at its end.

40|$|Scouring is {{the process}} of soil or {{sediment}} erosion due to flowing water, which can lead to bed degradation and compromised transportation infrastructure. In the decade before 2000, over half of the 500 bridge failures in the United States were caused by flooding or scouring. To gain a better grasp of the effects of extreme weather events, such as Tropical Storm Irene, on the scouring process, this work is focused on a first principle understanding of the mechanism(s) of scour. The field of Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) is particu larly well suited to this task. Utilizing a Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) code, the repeated impacts of a vortex dipole on a particle bed are simulated. The resulting scour characteristics and flow dynamics are investigated {{as a function of the}} Shields number. The vortex dipole propagates perpendicularly to the particle bed, resulting in the <b>scouring</b> of the <b>bed</b> and dissipation of the dipole. After completion of the scour event, the simulation is repeated four more times, where subsequent simulations use the <b>scoured</b> <b>bed</b> from the previous simulation as the initial bed form. This simulation series is conducted over a Shields number parameter space. The fluid phase is treated as a continuum and the discretized Navier-Stokes equations are solved down to the smallest scales of the flow on an Eulerian grid. The particles comprising the bed are represented by the Discrete Particle Model (DPM), whereby each individual particle is tracked in a Lagrangian framework. Particle-particle and particle-wall collisions are calculated using a soft-sphere model. The fluid phase and the solid phase are coupled through a forcing term in the fluid conservation of momentum equation, and a drag force in the particle equation of motion, governed by Newton 2 ̆ 7 s Second Law. Above the critical Shields number, the scour hole topography is not fundamentally altered with subsequent impacts until the scale of the scour hole reaches a critical value. At which point, the shape and scale of the scour hole significantly alters the behavior of the vortex dipole and results in strongly asymmetric scour topographies. This two-way coupling between the <b>bed</b> <b>scour</b> and the vortex dipole dynamics is the focus of this work...|$|R

40|$|Natural {{streams and}} rivers {{have the ability to}} <b>scour</b> <b>bed</b> {{materials}} and to carry a large amount of solid particles. When a dam wall is built across a river, it often acts as a sediment trap. After several years of use, a reservoir might become filled with sediments and cease to provide water storage. Since the European settlement of Australia, the development of the country has been linked with the availability of water resources. Australia is a dry continent with an average rainfall of 420 mm per year that is characterised by high spatial and temporal variability, including long droughts. Reservoir sedimentation has been and is still a serious problem in Australia, and Australian engineers should draw upon local and overseas experience, and particularly from past failures : "Those who cannot remember the past are doomed to repeat it" (SANTAYANA 1916). Several reservoirs became fully-silted because the designers did not take into account correctly the soil erosion and sediment transport processes, and no soil conservation practice was introduced. Today fully-silted reservoirs stand as a source of embarrassment for the engineers, scientists and the public.

40|$|Abstract:- Simulation of scour-pit {{formations}} {{under the}} bridge decks and around the bridge piers, due to sediment suspension and transport caused by flooding and pressure flow conditions, is of significant interest nowadays to computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and hydraulic researchers. From CFD perspective, analysis of bridge under various flooding conditions and impact of the drag and lift forces on it, are necessary to determine bridge stability. This study {{is focused on the}} simulation of open channel turbulent flows over inundated bridge deck and evolution of scour pit under various flooding conditions. Solutions for flow field and turbulence, using a representative bed roughness value, are based on Reynolds Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) equations, and turbulence closure model using a commercial CFD code. An iterative computational methodology is developed for the evolution of scour-pit profile using the single-phase slip-flat-top surface with (re) moving boundary formulation, based on an empirical correlation for critical shear stress to characterize initiation of sediment removal. The computational model has demonstrated stable and converged solution for the evolution of the scour-pit shape and size using a constant critical shear stress value.

40|$|The {{intensive}} {{research on}} sediment transport indicates a need of an appropriate equation for predicting the total sediment load in rivers to manage reservoirs, operate dam and design in-stream hydraulic structures. None {{of the available}} equations in sediment transport has gained universal acceptance for predicting the total sediment transport rate. These facts indicate the need of a general formula to represent all these formula for predicting the sediment transport rate. The first goal of this dissertation {{is to find a}} unified total sediment transport equation for all rivers. On the other hand, scour around hydraulic structures such as spur dikes and bridge piers can be a serious problem that weakens structural stability. An investigation on the turbulent flow field and turbulence distribution around such hydraulic structures is essential to understand the mechanism of local scour and to determine which turbulence properties affect the local sediment transport. In addition, a universal turbulent model that is valid for all cases of turbulent flow in open channels does not exist. This dissertation thoroughly examined the turbulent flow field and turbulence distribution around a series of three dikes. The goal is to determine the significant turbulent properties for predicting the local sediment transport rate and to identify the appropriate turbulence model for simulating turbulent flow field around the dikes. To develop a general unified total load equation, this study evaluates 31 commonly used formulae for predicting the total sediment load. This study attributes the deviations of calculated results from different formulae to the stochastic properties of bed shear stresses and assumes that the bed shear stress satisfies the log- normal distribution. At any given bed shear stress, Monte Carlo simulation is applied to each equation, and a set of bed shear stresses are randomly generated. Total sediment load generated from each Monte Carlo realization of all the equations are assembled to represent the samples of total sediment load predicted from all the equations. The statistical properties of the resultant total sediment loads (e. g. standard deviation, mean) at each given bed shear stress are calculated. Then, a unified total sediment load equation is obtained based on the mean value from all the equations. The results showed the mean of all the equations is a power function of dimensionless bed shear stress. Reasonable agreements with measurements demonstrate that the unified equation is more accurate than any individual equation for predicting the total sediment load. An experimental study and numerical simulation of the flow field and local scour around a series of spur dikes is performed in a fixed flat <b>bed</b> and <b>scoured</b> <b>bed</b> condition. A micro-Acoustic Doppler Velocimeter (ADV) is used to measure the instantaneous velocity field in all the three spatial directions and the measured velocity profiles are used to calculate the turbulence properties. Results show that the local scour develops around the first dike. Turbulence intensity together with the mean velocity in the vertical direction measured at the flat bed closely correlates to the scour depth. In addition, the maximum bed shear stress, occurring {{at the tip of the}} second dike in the three-dike series, does not correspond to the maximum <b>scour.</b> Large <b>bed</b> load transport due to bed shear stress may not initiate <b>bed</b> <b>scouring,</b> but turbulence bursts (e. g. sweeps and ejections) will entrain sediment from bed surface and develop the local scour. A three-dimensional numerical model FLOW- 3 D is used to simulate the turbulent flow field around a series of spur dikes in flat and <b>scoured</b> <b>bed.</b> This study examines Prandtl's mixing length model, one equation model, standard two-equation model, Renormalization-Group (RNG) model, and Large Eddy Simulations (LES) turbulence model. The Prandtl's mixing length model and one equation model are not applicable to flow field around dikes. Results of mean flow field by using the standard two-equation model, and RNG turbulence model are close to the experimental data, however the simulated turbulence properties from different turbulent model deviate considerably. The calculated results from different turbulence models show that the RNG model best predicts the mean flow field for this series of spur dikes. None of the turbulence closure models can predict accurate results of turbulence properties, such as turbulence kinetic energy. Based on those results, this study recommends the use of RNG model for simulating mean flow field around dikes. Further improvements of FLOW- 3 D model is needed for predicting turbulence properties near this series of spur dikes under various flow conditions...|$|R

Conversely, it is delayed by strong winds from the east or north, high barometric pressure, little fresh water and more <b>meandering,</b> poorly <b>scoured</b> channels. The wind direction out at sea is of more significance than the local air-flow.|$|R
25|$|Hydroelectric {{projects}} can be disruptive to surrounding aquatic ecosystems both {{upstream and downstream}} of {{the plant}} site. Generation of hydroelectric power changes the downstream river environment. Water exiting a turbine usually contains very little suspended sediment, {{which can lead to}} <b>scouring</b> of river <b>beds</b> and loss of riverbanks. Since turbine gates are often opened intermittently, rapid or even daily fluctuations in river flow are observed.|$|R
40|$|The {{evolution}} of bridge pier scour {{is very important}} for bridge safety warning and assessment. During typhoon seasons in Taiwan, the torrential river flow often causes scour monitoring instruments to fail in their attempt to measure the temporal variations of pier scour depths. To better understand the scouring phenomenon during a large flood event, this study proposes a fast and reliable method for bridge pier scour simulation. The proposed method consists of two main components: (1) a robust finite-volume hydraulic model that simulates the flow depth and velocities; and (2) two scour depth computation algorithms that predict the temporal development of the general and local scour depths. The greatest advantage of this method is that it is very straight-forward and reliable, giving bridge managers sufficient time to make an informed decision for bridge safety warning. Only a few hydraulic flow conditions near the bridge are necessary to simulate the scour depth evolution. Moreover, the method can be applied for both general and local scour simulations. To demonstrate the accuracy of the proposed method, field data collected using the “numbered-brick” method were performed at the Mingchu Bridge, which is located along an incised channel reach of the Cho-Shui River in Taiwan. The simulated water levels and total scour depths are in good agreements with the field data. Finally, to help bridge authorities responsible for making a decision towards bridge scour warning, a bridge safety curve (<b>scoured</b> <b>bed</b> level-discharge relationship) is proposed. Based on the results of two flood events, the study shows that the proposed method can quickly and accurately simulate the bridge pier scour...|$|R
