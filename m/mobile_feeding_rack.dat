50|$|The stable is {{typically}} historically the second-oldest building type on the farm.

These stables covered approximately 182,986 square feet, had floors sloped for drainage, and could contain about 480 horses.Free-standing stables began to be built from the 16th century. They were well built and placed near the house due to the value that the horses had as draught animals. High-status examples could have plastered ceilings to prevent dust falling through into the horses’ eyes. Relatively few examples survive of complete interiors (i.e. with stalls, mangers and <b>feed</b> <b>racks)</b> from the mid-19th century or earlier.|$|R
