5|$|Prior to the {{identification}} of HIV {{as the cause of}} AIDS in 1984, Sonnabend's investigations led him to propose that AIDS among gay <b>men</b> <b>might</b> be caused by multiple factors including Epstein–Barr virus and repeated exposure to cytomegalovirus and semen. This suggestion conflicted with the prevailing view that a single agent was likely responsible.|$|E
5|$|When Atkinson {{arrived back}} at Cape Evans from the Beardmore Glacier {{at the end}} of January, he was the senior officer present and thus in command of the base camp, a role to which he was not accustomed. Terra Nova arrived from her winter mooring in New Zealand on 9 February, and instead of setting off for Scott, Atkinson used the shore party for the arduous task of {{unloading}} the ship – a mistake, Cherry-Garrard thought, since these <b>men</b> <b>might</b> be required to sledge again. Belatedly, on 13 February, Atkinson set out with Dimitri Gerov and the dog teams for the scheduled meeting with Scott on the Barrier, arriving and pausing at Hut Point on 19 February.|$|E
5|$|While {{the revolt}} was {{unfolding}} in London, John Wrawe led his force into Suffolk. Wrawe had considerable {{influence over the}} development of the revolt across eastern England, where there may have been almost as many rebels as in the London revolt. The authorities put up very little resistance to the revolt: the major nobles failed to organise defences, key fortifications fell easily to the rebels and the local militias were not mobilised. As in London and the south-east, this was in part due to the absence of key military leaders and the nature of English law, but any locally recruited <b>men</b> <b>might</b> also have proved unreliable {{in the face of a}} popular uprising.|$|E

5|$|After the Texas Revolution ended, the {{original}} {{draft of the}} letter was given to Travis's family in Alabama. Several prominent Texians {{are known to have}} visited Travis's estranged wife shortly after the hostilities ended, but historians are unsure which of these <b>men</b> <b>might</b> have delivered the letter. Travis's daughter Susan (aged five {{at the time of his}} death) passed the letter down to her descendants; it eventually reached her great-grandson, John G. Davidson. In February 1891, Davidson lent the letter to the Texas Department of Agriculture, Insurance, Statistics, and History. Two years later, Davidson offered to sell the letter to the state of Texas for $250 ($ today). This represented half of the annual sum allocated for collecting historical manuscripts, and the state was hesitant to agree. After negotiations, Davidson agreed to accept $85 ($ today) for the letter, and on May 29 it officially passed into state ownership.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} the march, Julian gave {{a speech}} to the {{assembled}} army. Its wording could be read as implying that Julian had already had a fortified marching-camp built (in accordance with standard Roman military practice), or that he was simply proposing to do so. In any case, it appears that Julian, concerned that his <b>men</b> <b>might</b> be too tired to fight after a 6-hour march in the hot sun, urged that the clash be postponed until the following day. But his officers and men {{would have none of it}} and clamoured to be led against the enemy immediately. Julian, who prided himself on acting by consensus, gave way. However, since Ammianus states that the battle and subsequent pursuit ended after sunset, it seems unlikely that the army would have actually engaged at midday straight after the march without a few hours rest and refreshment (and, if a camp was built, a couple of hours spent on that task). It thus seems more likely that battle commenced in the late afternoon.|$|E
5|$|Failure usually meant {{six more}} months of sea service before the {{examination}} could again be attempted. Some men never passed it. Successful completion made the midshipman a 'passed midshipman'. From the 18th century {{until the second}} half of the 19th century, a midshipman in the Royal Navy who passed the lieutenant's examination did not automatically receive a commission. Midshipmen with political connections were promoted first, while others would wait their turn on a roster. During wartime, when large numbers of ships and <b>men</b> <b>might</b> be lost in battle, most passed midshipman would be promoted in a year or two, but during peacetime the wait might be so long that the midshipman would eventually be considered too old and lose his chance for a commission.|$|E

5|$|Taylor's exhortations to the Vietnamese {{officers}} to remove Khánh {{were not a}} secret, and it had an unwanted side-effect; it accelerated coup action from figures not favored by Washington. The likes of Kỳ, Thiệu, Có and Cang were {{not yet ready to}} stage a coup, and their preparations were well behind those of Thảo, an unstinting plotter. On February 14, the commander of the Marine Brigade General Lê Nguyên Khang reported to an American official that he was involved in plotting against Khánh but said he and the other Young Turks were not ready because the military was not sufficiently united. He said they had to wait for a time when a coup could be carried out without generating unspecified side-effects. Khang was aware Thảo was planning a move with some generals who were now on the outer. He anticipated trouble in trying to keep his subordinates from joining Thảo, as his <b>men</b> <b>might</b> not wait for the younger generals to launch their coup if they thought it would never come.|$|E
5|$|The {{figure of}} 300,000 has been doubted, {{along with many}} of Herodotus' numbers, by many historians; modern {{consensus}} estimates {{the total number of}} troops for the Persian invasion at around 250,000. According to this consensus, Herodotus' 300,000 Persians at Plataea would self-evidently be impossible. One approach to estimating the size of the Persian army has been to estimate how many <b>men</b> <b>might</b> feasibly have been accommodated within the Persian camp; this approach gives figures of between 70,000 and 120,000 men. Lazenby, for instance, by comparison with later Roman military camps, calculates the number of troops at 70,000, including 10,000 cavalry. Meanwhile, Connolly derives a number of 120,000 from the same-sized camp. Indeed, most estimates for the total Persian force are generally in this range. For instance, Delbrück, based on the distance the Persians marched in a day when Athens was attacked, concluded that 75,000 was the upper limit for the size of the Persian army, including the supply personnel and other non-combatants. In his battle account of Plataea, Delbrück estimated the Persian army, including allied Greeks, as amounting to 40,000.|$|E
5|$|With the {{surrender}} of Fort Henry, the Confederates faced some difficult choices. Grant's army now divided Confederate Gen. Albert Sidney Johnston's two main forces: P.G.T. Beauregard at Columbus, Kentucky, with 12,000 men, and William J. Hardee at Bowling Green, Kentucky, with 22,000 men. Fort Donelson had only about 5,000 men. Union forces might attack Columbus; they might attack Fort Donelson and thereby threaten Nashville, Tennessee; or Grant and Maj. Gen. Don Carlos Buell, who was quartered in Louisville with 45,000 <b>men,</b> <b>might</b> attack Johnston head-on, with Grant following behind Buell. Johnston was apprehensive about {{the ease with which}} Union gunboats defeated Fort Henry (not comprehending that the rising waters of the Tennessee River played a crucial role by inundating the fort). He was more concerned about the threat from Buell than he was from Grant, and suspected the river operations might simply be a diversion.|$|E
