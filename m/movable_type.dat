5|$|The <b>movable</b> <b>type</b> {{invented by}} Bi Sheng was {{ultimately}} trumped {{by the use}} of woodblock printing due to the limitations of the enormous Chinese character writing system, yet <b>movable</b> <b>type</b> printing continued to be used and was improved in later periods. The Yuan dynasty scholar-official Wang Zhen (fl. 1290–1333) implemented a faster typesetting process, improved Bi's baked-clay <b>movable</b> <b>type</b> character set with a wooden one, and experimented with tin-metal <b>movable</b> <b>type.</b> The wealthy printing patron Hua Sui (1439–1513) of the Ming dynasty established China's first metal <b>movable</b> <b>type</b> (using bronze) in 1490. In 1638 the Beijing Gazette switched their printing process from woodblock to <b>movable</b> <b>type</b> printing. Yet it was during the Qing dynasty that massive printing projects began to employ <b>movable</b> <b>type</b> printing. This includes the printing of sixty-six copies of a 5,020 volume long encyclopedia in 1725, the Gujin Tushu Jicheng (Complete Collection of Illustrations and Writings from the Earliest to Current Times), which necessitated the crafting of 250,000 <b>movable</b> <b>type</b> characters cast in bronze. By the 19th century the European style printing press replaced the old Chinese methods of <b>movable</b> <b>type,</b> while traditional woodblock printing in modern East Asia is used sparsely and for aesthetic reasons.|$|E
5|$|By the 15th century, metal <b>movable</b> <b>type</b> {{printing}} {{was developed}} in Ming Dynasty China (and earlier in Joseon Korea, by the mid 13th century), and was widely applied in China by at least the 16th century. In Jiangsu and Fujian, wealthy Ming era families sponsored the use of metal type printing (mostly using bronze). This included the printing works of Hua Sui (1439–1513), who pioneered the first Chinese bronze-type movable printing in the year 1490. In 1718, during the mid Qing Dynasty (1644–1912), the scholar of Tai'an known as Xu Zhiding developed <b>movable</b> <b>type</b> with enamelware instead of earthenware. There was also Zhai Jinsheng (b. 1784), a teacher of Jingxian, Anhui, who spent thirty years making a font of earthenware <b>movable</b> <b>type,</b> and by 1844 he had over 100,000 Chinese writing characters in five sizes.|$|E

5|$|Movable type: The polymath {{scientist}} and official Shen Kuo (1031–1095) of the Song Dynasty (960–1279) {{was the first}} to describe the process of <b>movable</b> <b>type</b> printing in his Dream Pool Essays of 1088. He attributed the innovation of reusable fired clay characters to a little-known artisan named Bi Sheng (990–1051). Bi had experimented with wooden type characters, but their use was not perfected until 1297 to 1298 with the model of the official Wang Zhen (fl. 1290–1333) of the Yuan Dynasty (1271–1368), who also arranged written characters by rhyme scheme on the surface of round table compartments. It was not until 1490 with the printed works of Hua Sui (1439–1513) of the Ming Dynasty (1368–1644) that the Chinese perfected metal <b>movable</b> <b>type</b> characters, namely bronze. The Qing Dynasty (1644–1912) scholar Xu Zhiding of Tai'an, Shandong developed vitreous enamel <b>movable</b> <b>type</b> printing in 1718.|$|E
5|$|China {{has been}} the source of many innovations, {{scientific}} discoveries and inventions.

5|$|Perhaps {{the best}} known herbals were {{produced}} in Europe between 1470 and 1670. The invention in Germany of printing from <b>movable</b> <b>type</b> in a printing press c. 1440 was a great stimulus to herbalism. The new herbals were more detailed with greater general appeal and often with Gothic script {{and the addition of}} woodcut illustrations that more closely resembled the plants being described.|$|E

25|$|Clay type {{printing}} was practiced in China from the Song dynasty through the Qing dynasty. As late as 1844 {{there were still}} books printed in China with ceramic <b>movable</b> <b>types.</b>|$|R
5|$|The {{innovation}} of <b>movable</b> <b>type</b> printing {{was made}} by the artisan Bi Sheng (990–1051), first described by the scientist and statesman Shen Kuo in his Dream Pool Essays of 1088. The collection of Bi Sheng's original clay-fired typeface was passed on to one of Shen Kuo's nephews, and was carefully preserved. <b>Movable</b> <b>type</b> enhanced the already widespread use of woodblock methods of printing thousands of documents and volumes of written literature, consumed eagerly by an increasingly literate public. The advancement of printing deeply affected education and the scholar-official class, since more books could be made faster while mass-produced, printed books were cheaper in comparison to laborious handwritten copies. The enhancement of widespread printing and print culture in the Song period was thus a direct catalyst in the rise of social mobility and expansion of the educated class of scholar elites, the latter which expanded dramatically in size from the 11th to 13th centuries.|$|E
5|$|When Su Song's Xinyi Xiangfayao {{was written}} in 1092 and the horological {{monograph}} finalized and presented in 1094, his work was published and widely printed in the north (see woodblock printing and <b>movable</b> <b>type</b> of Bi Sheng). In the south, printing and circulation of his work was not widely distributed until Shi Yuanzhi of Jiangsu had it printed there in 1172.|$|E
5|$|Despite these advances, <b>movable</b> <b>type</b> {{printing}} never {{gained the}} amount of widespread use in East Asia that woodblock printing had achieved since the Chinese Tang Dynasty in the 9th century. With written Chinese, the vast amount of written morpheme characters impeded movable type's acceptance and practical use, and was therefore seen as largely unsatisfactory. Furthermore, the European printing press, first invented by Johannes Gutenberg (1398–1468), was eventually wholly adopted as the standard in China, yet the tradition of woodblock printing remains popular in East Asian countries still.|$|E
25|$|Using {{more than}} 30,000 wooden <b>movable</b> <b>types,</b> Wang Zhen printed a hundred {{copies of his}} county gazetteer, Records of Jingde County (Jingde xianzhi 旌德縣志), a text {{containing}} more than 60,000 characters.|$|R

5|$|Informal essay {{and travel}} writing was another highlight. Xu Xiake (1587–1641), a travel {{literature}} author, published his Travel Diaries in 404,000 written characters, {{with information on}} everything from local geography to mineralogy. The first reference to the publishing of private newspapers in Beijing was in 1582; by 1638 the Beijing Gazette switched from using woodblock print to <b>movable</b> <b>type</b> printing. The new literary field of the moral guide to business ethics was developed during the late Ming period, for the readership of the merchant class.|$|E
5|$|Alongside his {{colleague}} Wei Pu, Shen planned {{to map the}} orbital paths of the Moon and the planets in an intensive five-year project involving daily observations, yet this was thwarted by political opponents at court. To aid his work in astronomy, Shen Kuo made improved designs of the armillary sphere, gnomon, sighting tube, and invented {{a new type of}} inflow water clock. Shen Kuo devised a geological hypothesis for land formation (geomorphology), based upon findings of inland marine fossils, knowledge of soil erosion, and the deposition of silt. He also proposed a hypothesis of gradual climate change, after observing ancient petrified bamboos that were preserved underground in a dry northern habitat that would not support bamboo growth in his time. He was the first literary figure in China to mention the use of the drydock to repair boats suspended out of water, and also wrote of the effectiveness of the relatively new invention of the canal pound lock. Although Ibn al-Haytham (965–1039) was the first to describe camera obscura, Shen was the first in China to do so, several decades later. Shen wrote extensively about <b>movable</b> <b>type</b> printing invented by Bi Sheng (990–1051), and because of his written works the legacy of Bi Sheng and the modern understanding of the earliest <b>movable</b> <b>type</b> has been handed down to later generations. Following an old tradition in China, Shen created a raised-relief map while inspecting borderlands. His description of an ancient crossbow mechanism which he himself unearthed proved to be a Jacob's staff, a surveying tool which wasn't known in Europe until described by Levi ben Gerson in 1321.|$|E
5|$|Die casting {{equipment}} {{was invented in}} 1838 {{for the purpose of}} producing <b>movable</b> <b>type</b> for the printing industry. The first die casting-related patent was granted in 1849 for a small hand-operated machine for the purpose of mechanized printing type production. In 1885 Otto Mergenthaler invented the linotype machine, an automated type-casting device which became the prominent type of equipment in the publishing industry. The Soss die-casting machine, manufactured in Brooklyn, NY, was the first machine to be sold in the open market in North America. Other applications grew rapidly, with die casting facilitating the growth of consumer goods and appliances by making affordable the production of intricate parts in high volumes. In 1966, General Motors released the Acurad process.|$|E

5|$|Woodblock {{printing}} {{made the}} written word available to vastly greater audiences. One of the world's oldest surviving printed documents is a miniature Buddhist dharani sutra unearthed at Xi'an in 1974 and dated roughly from 650 to 670. The Diamond Sutra is the first full-length book printed at regular size, complete with illustrations embedded with the text and dated precisely to 868. Among the earliest documents to be printed were Buddhist texts as well as calendars, the latter essential for calculating and marking which days were auspicious and which days were not. With so many books coming into circulation for the general public, literacy rates could improve, along with the lower classes being able to obtain cheaper sources of study. Therefore, there were more lower-class people seen entering the Imperial Examinations and passing them by the later Song dynasty. Although the later Bi Sheng's <b>movable</b> <b>type</b> printing in the 11th century was innovative for his period, woodblock printing that became widespread in the Tang would remain the dominant printing type in China until the more advanced printing press from Europe became widely accepted and used in East Asia. The first use of the playing card during the Tang dynasty was an auxiliary invention of the new age of printing.|$|E
25|$|Although Wang's Nong Shu {{was mostly}} printed {{by use of}} woodblock printing, his {{innovation}} of wooden <b>movable</b> <b>type</b> soon became popularly used {{in the region of}} Anhui. Wang's wooden <b>movable</b> <b>type</b> was used to print the local gazetteer paper of Jingde City, which incorporated the use of 60,000 written characters organized on revolving tables. During the year of 1298, roughly one hundred copies of this were printed by wooden <b>movable</b> <b>type</b> in a month's time. Following in the footsteps of Wang, in 1322 the magistrate of Fenghua, Zhejiang province, named Ma Chengde, printed Confucian classics with <b>movable</b> <b>type</b> of 100,000 written characters on needed revolving tables. The process of metal <b>movable</b> <b>type</b> was also developed in Joseon Korea by the 13th century, while metal <b>movable</b> <b>type</b> was not pioneered in China until the Ming Dynasty (1368–1644) printer Hua Sui used bronze <b>movable</b> <b>type</b> in 1490. Although metal <b>movable</b> <b>type</b> became available in China during the Ming period, wooden <b>movable</b> <b>type</b> persisted in common use even until the 19th century. After that point, the European printing press machine first pioneered by Johannes Gutenberg in the 15th century became the mainstay and standard in China {{and for the most part}} the global community until the advent of digital printing and the modern computer printer.|$|E
25|$|Compared to woodblock printing, <b>movable</b> <b>type</b> {{page-setting}} was {{quicker and}} more durable. The metal type pieces were more durable and the lettering was more uniform, leading to typography and fonts. The high quality and relatively low {{price of the}} Gutenberg Bible (1455) established the superiority of <b>movable</b> <b>type,</b> and printing presses rapidly spread across Europe, {{leading up to the}} Renaissance, and later all around the world. Today, practically all <b>movable</b> <b>type</b> printing ultimately derives from Gutenberg's <b>movable</b> <b>type</b> printing, which is often regarded as the most important invention of the second millennium.|$|E

25|$|<b>Movable</b> <b>type</b> is {{the system}} of {{printing}} and typography using movable pieces of metal type, made by casting from matrices struck by letterpunches. <b>Movable</b> <b>type</b> allowed for much more flexible processes than hand copying or block printing.|$|E
25|$|Bi Sheng also {{developed}} wooden <b>movable</b> <b>type,</b> {{but it was}} abandoned in favor of ceramic types due {{to the presence of}} wood grains and the unevenness of the wooden type after being soaked in ink.
