50|$|The {{high-resolution}} {{computed tomography}} (HRCT) chest scan {{is better than}} the chest radiograph to detect cystic parenchymal disease and is almost always abnormal at the time of diagnosis, even when the chest radiograph and pulmonary function assessments are normal. The typical CT shows diffuse round, bilateral, thin-walled cysts of varying sizes ranging from 1 to 45 mm in diameter. The numbers of cysts varies in LAM from a few to almost complete replacement of normal lung tissue. The profusion of cysts tends to be milder in patients with TSC-LAM than S-LAM, perhaps explained in part because TSC-LAM patients typically receive earlier screening. Pleural effusions are seen on CT in 12% of patients with S-LAM and 6% of patients with TSC-LAM. Other CT features include linear densities (29%), hilar or mediastinal lymphadenopathy (9%), pneumothorax, lymphangiomyoma, and thoracic duct dilation. Ground-glass opacities (12%) suggest the presence of interstitial edema due to lymphatic congestion. In patients with TSC, nodular densities on HRCT may represent multifocal micronodular pneumocyte hyperplasia (<b>MMPH)</b> made up of clusters of hyperplastic type II pneumocytes. <b>MMPH</b> may be present in males or females with TSC in {{the presence or absence of}} LAM, but not in patients with S-LAM. <b>MMPH</b> is not typically associated with physiologic or prognostic consequences, but one case of respiratory failure due to <b>MMPH</b> has been reported.|$|E

40|$|Multifocal micronodular pneumocyte {{hyperplasia}} (<b>MMPH)</b> is rare entity seen {{mostly in}} patients with the tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC). We present {{the case of a}} 50 year old woman with TSC (confirmed TSC 2 mutation) found to have multiple ground glass opacities with an upper lobe predominance on a screening chest CT. No abnormalities were detected in other viscera. A thoracoscopic lung biopsy obtained from right upper lobe confirmed the diagnosis of <b>MMPH.</b> There were no lesions suggestive of lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM) either on the chest CT or lung biopsy. A repeat CT chest obtained on follow up 9 years after initial diagnosis continued to show stability of all <b>MMPH</b> ground glass lesions.

40|$|We {{report a}} {{peculiar}} case of multifocal micronodular pneumocyte hyperplasia (<b>MMPH)</b> in a 54 -year-old woman with {{tuberous sclerosis complex}} (TSC) diagnosed during antituberculous treatment. Findings were initially detected by chest computed tomography (CT) to check for complication of pulmonary tuberculosis. Chest CT demonstrated multiple small nodules with ground-glass opacity, measuring up to 5 mm diameter, presenting in the bilateral lung fields, without cystic change. Because the differentiation from multiple atypical adenomatous hyper-plasia (AAH) was necessary, we finally performed a diagnosis of <b>MMPH</b> based on specimens obtained by video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery. Histologically, type II pneumocytes without nuclear atypia lined the thickened alveolar septa and proliferated papillary structures. There was no proliferation of immature smooth muscle cells suggestive of lymphangioleiomyomato-sis. Although immunohistochemical stains for cytokeratin and surfactant apoprotein A and B were positive for alveolar lining cells in each <b>MMPH</b> lesion, those for HMB- 45, alpha-smooth muscle actin, p 53 and carcinoembryonic antigen were negative. We must consider <b>MMPH</b> {{as part of the}} differential diagnosis along with multiple AAH when multiple small nodules with ground-glass opacity were observed on chest CT in patients with TSC.

40|$|The {{advent of}} {{pharmacological}} therapies for lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM) has made early diagnosis important {{in women with}} tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC), although the lifelong cumulative radiation exposure caused by chest computer tomography (CT) should not be underestimated. We retrospectively investigated, in a cohort of TSC outpatients of San Paolo Hospital (Milan, Italy) 1) the role of pulmonary function tests (PFTs) for LAM diagnosis, 2) the association between LAM and other features of TSC (e. g. demography, extrapulmonary manifestations, genetic mutations, etc.), and 3) the characteristics of patients with multifocal micronodular pneumocyte hyperplasia (<b>MMPH).</b> Eighty-six women underwent chest CT scan; pulmonary involvement was found in 66 patients (77 %; 49 % LAM with or without <b>MMPH,</b> and 28 % <b>MMPH</b> alone). LAM patients were older, with {{a higher rate of}} pneumothorax, presented more frequently with renal and hepatic angiomyolipomas, and tended to have a TSC 2 mutation profile. PFTs, assessed in 64 % of women unaffected by cognitive impairments, revealed a lower lung diffusion capacity in LAM patients. In multivariate analysis, age, but not PFTs, resulted independently associated with LAM diagnosis. Patients with <b>MMPH</b> alone did not show specific clinical, functional or genetic features. A mild respiratory impairment was most common in LAM-TSC patients: In conclusions, PFTs, even if indicated to assess impairment in lung function, are feasible in a limited number of patients, and are not significantly useful for LAM diagnosis in women with TSC...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{simultaneously}} {{investigates the}} effectiveness of benefit sanctions and active labour market programmes on the exit rate from unemployment using Danish data. In the data about {{one third of the}} individuals who are sanctioned also participate in some active labour market programmes (ALMPs). Hence, modeling only one of them as treatment might over or underestimate the true effect. Therefore, by using a multivariate mixed proportional hazard model (<b>MMPH),</b> we model the hazard rate out of unemployment along with the sanction rate and hazard rate into active labour market programmes. We optimally select the number of supports point for the distribution of unobserved heterogeneity. Results show that pre-specifying two support points underestimates the effect of sanctions and active labour market programmes. Failing to control for selectivity for sanctions not only underestimates the treatment effect of sanctions but also biases the treatment effect of ALMPs. competing risks, unemployment insurance, timing of events, NPMLE, <b>MMPH...</b>|$|E

40|$|Based on Norwegian {{register}} data, {{we set up}} {{a multivariate}} mixed proportional hazard model (<b>MMPH)</b> to analyze nurses’ pattern of work, sickness absence, nonemployment, and social insurance dependency from 1992 to 2000, and how that pattern was affected by workplace characteristics. The model is estimated by means of the nonparametric maximum-likelihood estimator (NPMLE). We find that downsizing processes involve {{a significant increase in the}} level of sickness absence among still-employed nurses. They also cause a significant increase in the probability of entering into more long-lasting health-related social insurance dependency. ...|$|E

We take account {{of information on the}} timing of treatment in the unemployment spell and of observ-able and unobservable factors to control for selectivity applying a multivariate mixed proportional hazards model (<b>MMPH).</b> Moreover, we suggest an extension of the model to estimate treatment effects varying over time. In ad-dition, to shed more light the effects, we provide estimates in terms of average treatment effects that are common in the evaluation literature. The results show that training measures significantly reduce unemployment duration...|$|E
30|$|To {{investigate}} whether the UIS affects job stability, {{it is crucial}} to account for dynamic selection and endogeneity issues (i.e., the endogeneity of previous unemployment duration on subsequent employment duration). For this purpose, we use duration models that are closely related to the timing-of-events approach of Abbring and van den Berg (2004). This approach is able to solve the endogeneity problem caused by selective treatment by exploiting the variation in the timing of each transition. In particular, we set up a multivariate mixed proportional hazard rate model (<b>MMPH)</b> that combines information related to an individual’s use of the UIS system with information on employment and unemployment dynamics.|$|E
40|$|We examine empirically {{the impacts}} of labor market {{policies}} – in terms of unemployment insurance (UI) and active labor market programs (ALMP) – on the duration and outcome of job search and {{on the quality of}} a subsequent job. We find that time invested in job search tends to pay off in the form of higher earnings once a job match is formed. More generous UI raises expected unemployment duration, while improving the quality of the resultant job. Participation in ALMP raises the probability of finding a job and the level of expected earnings, but at the cost of lengthening job search. multivariate hazards, job search, job quality, timing-of-events, NPMLE, <b>MMPH...</b>|$|E
40|$|Monolayer {{protected}} gold nanoparticles (MPGN) {{coated with}} metal chelating groups were prepared. In {{the presence of}} Ce(IV), the MPGN proved to be highly active in promoting the hydrolytic cleavage of the DNA model bis-p-nitrophenyl phosphate (BNP). A 2. 5 million-fold rate acceleration of the BNP hydrolysis was measured at a concentration of Ce(IV) as low as 120 <b>mM(pH</b> 7, 25 ◦C). This corresponds to a reduction of the substrate half-life time from 2000 years to few hours. The MPGN-Ce(IV) system is 1 to 2 orders of magnitude more reactive than any mono- and binuclear Ce(IV) complex so far reported.

30|$|Overall, our <b>MMPH</b> model {{demonstrates}} {{its relevance}} with the {{significant differences between}} the patterns of duration dependence and the effects of the explanatory variables on each hazard rate. The likelihood function obtains its maxima at three mass-points in the distribution of unobserved heterogeneity. These support points are robustly identified {{on the basis of a}} large number of estimators with different starting values. The results are also highly robust as long as the number of support points remains between two and three. 23 This may imply that the information content in the data relating to the distribution of the unobserved heterogeneity term is sufficient to ensure robust identification of the structural duration dependence in the hazard rates, as well as the effects of benefits on spell duration.|$|E
40|$|A 52 {{years old}} lady was {{diagnosed}} to have Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC) {{on the basis}} of 2 major and one minor criterion. She had family history of similar complaints in her sister and two sons.

40|$|Based on {{comprehensive}} administrative register {{data from}} Norway, {{we examine the}} determinants of sickness absence behavior; in terms of employee characteristics workplace characteristics, panel doctor characteristics, and economic conditions. The analysis {{is based on a}} novel concept of a worker's steady state sickness absence propensity, computed from a multivariate hazard rate model designed to predict the incidence and the duration of sickness absence for all workers. Key conclusions are i) that most of the cross-sectional variation in absenteeism is caused by genuine employee heterogeneity; ii) that the identity of a person's panel doctor has a significant impact on absence propensity; iii) that sickness absence insurance is frequently certified for reasons other than sickness; and iv) that the recovery rate rises enormously just prior to the exhaustion of sickness insurance benefits. sickness absence, multivariate hazards, <b>MMPH,</b> NPMLE...|$|E
40|$|Based on a {{sequence}} of reforms in the Norwegian unemployment insurance (UI) system, we show that activity-oriented UI regimes - i. e., regimes with a high likelihood of required participa-tion in active labor market programs, duration limitations on unconditional UI entitlements, and high sanction probabilities - deliver substantially shorter unemployment spells than pure income-insurance regimes. Soft constraints, {{in the form of}} activity requirements or small benefit cuts af-ter a pre-specified UI duration, have many of the same behavioral consequences as threats of complete benefit termination. Early introduction of a soft constraint appears particularly effec-tive; our results show that the expected unemployment duration falls by half a day for each week the soft constraint is moved ahead in the UI spell. Mild sanctions, in the form of temporary bene-fit terminations in response to inadequate search effort or excess choosiness, cause a significant rise in the job hazard.

40|$|Since {{the early}} 1980 s, the econometric {{analysis}} of duration variables has become widespread. This chapter {{provides an overview}} of duration analysis, with an emphasis on the specification and identification of duration models, and with special attention to models for multiple durations. Most of the chapter deals with so-called reduced-form duration models, notably the popular Mixed Proportional Hazard (MPH) model and its multivariate extensions. The MPH model is often used to describe the relation between the empirical exit rate and "background variables[equal, rising dots] in a concise way. However, since the applications usually interpret the results in terms of some economic-theoretical model, we examine to what extent the deep structural parameters of some important theoretical models can be related to reduced-form parameters. We subsequently examine the specification and identification of the MPH model in great detail, we provide intuition on what drives identification, and we infer to what extent biases may occur because of misspecifications. This examination is carried out separately for the case of single-spell data and the case of multi-spell data. We also compare different functional forms for the unobserved heterogeneity distribution. Next, we examine models for multiple durations. In the applied econometric literature on the estimation of multiple-duration models, the range of different models is actually not very large. Typically, the models allow for dependence between the duration variables by way of their unobserved determinants, with each single duration following its own MPH model. In addition to this, the model may allow for an interesting "causal[equal, rising dots] effect of one duration on the other, as motivated by an underlying economic theory. For all these models we examine the conditions for identification. Some of these are intimately linked to particular estimation strategies. The multiple-duration model where the marginal duration distributions each satisfy an MPH specification, and the durations can only be dependent by way of their unobserved determinants, is called the Multivariate Mixed Proportional Hazard (<b>MMPH)</b> model. For this model, we address the issue of the dimensionality of the heterogeneity distribution and we compare the flexibility of different parametric heterogeneity distributions. On a number of occasions, we incorporate recent insights from the biostatistical literature on duration analysis, and we contrast points of view in this literature to those in the econometric literature. Finally, throughout the chapter, we discuss the importance of the possible collection of additional data. ...|$|E
