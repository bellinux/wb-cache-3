In comparison to older versions, the new radar enables the ASaC7 to simultaneously track up to 400 targets, instead of an earlier limit of 250 targets. The effectiveness of the AEW7 was greatly increased via the addition of a Link 16 data link, allowing gathered radar information to be analysed and rapidly put to use by multiple allied platforms in range.|$|E

Speech recognition integrated with speech synthesis constructs Speech Instruction Control System (SICS). The {{design of a}} kind of Speech Instruction Control System (SICS) prototype is presented in this paper. The 32 bit embedded system is adopted as the hardware core, while the middle layer is embedded Linux. Outside the middle layer is the application software shell. The development and experimental study on the SICS prototype has been carried out. Under the 100 Mbps fast switch Ethernet and WINDOWS 98 OS environment, a simplified Chinese SICS bas been realized. In the system, a broadening endpoint Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) algorithm is applied which implements speaker-dependent rapid speech recognition and has the adaptive performance to process the tiny diversification of the speech speed. The UDP protocal is adopted to implement the real time transmission of the recognition result code of speech commands. The SICS prototype have been also realized in Linux Redhat 7. 0.

40|$|With the {{increase}} of communication between computers, we need (i) techniques for communication to be handled automatically or implicitly, and (ii) flexible programs capable of handling data from different kinds of correspondents with no reprogramming.

We propose handling these activities implicitly and in a unified manner by separating a program into a pure algorithm with no communication statements (PurAL), and separate declarations which describe externally mapped variables and distribution of programs (DUAL declarations).
