500|$|Indian Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru stated upon Jinnah's death, [...] "How {{shall we}} judge him? I {{have been very}} angry with him often during the past years. But {{now there is no}} {{bitterness}} in <b>my</b> <b>thought</b> of him, only a great sadness for all that has been... he succeeded in his quest and gained his objective, but at what a cost and with what a difference from what he had imagined." [...] Jinnah was buried on 12 September 1948 amid official mourning in both India and Pakistan; a million people gathered for his funeral. Indian Governor-General Rajagopalachari cancelled an official reception that day in honour of the late leader. Today, Jinnah rests in a large marble mausoleum, Mazar-e-Quaid, in Karachi.|$|E
500|$|The Astonishing is Dream Theater's second concept album after 1999's [...] Described as an [...] "honest-to-God rock opera" [...] by Rolling Stone, it {{has been}} {{compared}} to The Who's Tommy (1969), Rush's 2112 (1976), Pink Floyd's The Wall (1979), and Queensrÿche's [...] (1988). 2112 also revolves around music being used to achieve freedom in a futuristic setting. The album's story was inspired by Petrucci's love of fantasy and science fiction franchises such as Game of Thrones, Lord of the Rings, and Star Wars, as well as his observations on the role of technology in modern-day society. In an interview with Billboard, he explained, “I was thinking of all of the things now that people used to do that they don’t do anymore because they’re automated or done by robots: lots of jobs, self-driving cars coming right around the corner ... <b>My</b> <b>thought</b> was, 'What would happen if ... music [...] all artificial?’” ...|$|E

2500|$|Given Schiller's {{view that}} {{the meaning of a}} thought amounts to the {{consequences}} one means to bring about by the thought, Schiller further concluded that the truth of a thought depends on whether it actually brings about the consequences one intended. For example, if while following a cooking recipe that called for salt I were to think to myself, [...] "Cerebos is salt", <b>my</b> <b>thought</b> will be true if it consequently leads me to add Cerebos and produce a dish with the intended taste. However, if while working in a chemistry lab to produce a certain mixture I were to think to myself, [...] "Cerebos is salt", <b>my</b> <b>thought</b> would both have a different meaning than before (since my intent now differs) and be false (since Cerebos is only equivalent to salt for culinary purposes). According to Schiller, the question of what a thought like [...] "Cerebos is salt" [...] means or whether it is true can only be answered if the specific circumstances with which the thought arose are taken into consideration. While there is some similarity here between Schiller's view of meaning and the later ordinary language philosophers, Schiller's account ties meaning and truth more closely to individuals and their intent with a specific use rather than whole linguistic communities.|$|E

[...] After working on the idea with Upham, Bellamy concluded, [...] "It was <b>my</b> <b>thought</b> that a vow of loyalty or allegiance to the flag should be the dominant idea.

For the same reason the thoughts of proceeding directly to the Cape of Good Hope was laid aside, especially as no discovery of any Moment could be hoped for in that rout. It was therefore resolved to return by way of the East Indies by the following rout: upon Leaving this Coast to steer to the Westward until we fall in with the East Coast of New Holland, and then to follow the direction of that Coast to the Northward, or what other direction it might take us, until we arrive at its Northern extremity; and if this should be found impracticable, then to Endeavour to fall in with the Land or Islands discovered by Quiros".|$|E
