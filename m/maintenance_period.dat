25|$|The {{reason for}} {{the sheer number of}} dams in the project, more than would at first appear needed, is maintenance. Dams need to be cleaned from the debris carried with the water flow. After a while the dam becomes {{obsolete}} as water flow slows down to inadequate levels. The dams will be shut down every 5 to 10 years for fall maintenance (also called fall cleanup). Water levels are normally lowest in fall. The extra dams are placed in service during this <b>maintenance</b> <b>period.</b>|$|E

25|$|The ship {{remained}} in Somali waters until late May, apart from runs to Mombasa to embark humanitarian supplies, {{along with a}} port visit to the Seychelles in late April. As well as providing heavy lift and logistic support, Tobruk provided the main communications link for 1RAR back to Australia, {{and served as a}} venue for rest and recreation for soldiers. Re-embarkation of Australian equipment began on 14 May, and Tobruk sailed for home on 20 May. The ship called at Diego Garcia and Singapore before unloading in Townsville, then returning to Sydney on 21 June. After a <b>maintenance</b> <b>period</b> lasting until August, Tobruk resumed normal exercise and training routines. The ship was awarded the Gloucester Cup for 1993 for her service off Somalia and subsequent operations during the year.|$|E
25|$|In mid-2000, a {{civil war}} {{broke out in the}} Solomon Islands; Tobruk was ordered to the Islands' capital, Honiara, to {{evacuate}} Australian citizens. She arrived on 8 June and embarked 486 civilians, who were then transported to Cairns, Queensland. After a brief <b>maintenance</b> <b>period,</b> Tobruk returned to the Solomons in late June, where she served as the venue for peace talks. She spent almost all of July at anchor off Honiara and returned to Australia after a cease-fire agreement was signed on board the ship on 2 August. Tobruk made a further voyage to the Solomons in December 2000 to support the International Peace Monitoring team which had been established there. A peace treaty ending the conflict was signed on board the ship on 7 February 2001 and she returned to Sydney on 15 February. Tobruk took part of Operation Relex in late 2001 and early 2002 where she transported would-be refugees to Nauru and Christmas Island. She also made a further voyage from Darwin to East Timor in April 2002 to deliver supplies to the Australian Defence Force units there.|$|E
25|$|On 19 May 2010, Norfolk Naval Shipyard {{completed}} the six-month Planned Incremental Availability (PIA) maintenance cycle on Reagan. This PIA project came in under budget, and it marked both Norfolk Naval Shipyard's largest off-site availability, {{as well as}} the largest public-sector work package ever performed on an aircraft carrier berthed at Naval Air Station North Island located near Coronado, California (pictured). During the <b>maintenance</b> <b>period,</b> Ronald Reagan received technological upgrades that prepared it for its next deployment and subsequent operations. Refurbishments included high-tech combat systems and firefighting equipment to improved ship's laundry services and living spaces. This PIA maintenance project was an example of the 'One Shipyard' concept wherein the U.S. Navy mobilizes its work force across its various shipyards to better meet fleet readiness requirements and to stabilize a vital workforce base for the U.S. defense industry. While Norfolk Naval Shipyard (NNSY) was the project lead, significant work was done by its partners: Puget Sound Naval Shipyard & Intermediate Maintenance Facility (PSNS), Southwest Regional Maintenance Center (SRMC), and Northrop Grumman Shipbuilding (NGSB).|$|E

25|$|Perth {{sailed to}} Subic for {{emergency}} maintenance and rebarrelling on 26 October, {{and returned to}} Sea Dragon duties on 1 November. Another <b>maintenance</b> <b>period</b> occurred between 7 and 16 November, after which Perth sailed to Singapore for shore leave, returning to operations on 27 November. This gunline deployment lasted until 20 December, with Perth coming under shore battery fire on two occasions, but receiving no hits or damage. After maintenance at Subic, the destroyer returned Sea Dragon operations on 9 January. Problems with the forward gun turret and the starboard propeller saw Perth withdraw to Subic for repairs on 2 February. These were completed by 14 February, with the destroyer returning to the Sea Dragon force that day. The commanding officer of Perth was appointed overall commander of both {{the northern and southern}} task units; the northern unit was normally led by the commander of the assigned cruiser, but Newport News was in dock for maintenance. In mid-February, the forward gun mount malfunctioned again, which left the turret operational but unable to rotate. On 1 March, the destroyer withdrew for maintenance, returning to operations ten days later. On 23 March, Perth withdrew to Subic to conclude her tour of duty, and was replaced on 31 March by Hobart.|$|E

500|$|The Johnstown Inclined Plane {{was listed}} on the National Register of Historic Places on June18, 1973. On July20, 1977, the incline was again used as an escape route, {{evacuating}} residents from the valley amid rising floodwaters. It also carried [...] "boats, emergency personnel, and equipment down to the valley to aid in rescue operations". The incline was again sold for $1 by Westmont borough on March8, 1983, to the Cambria County Transit Authority, now CamTran. CamTran initiated a $4.2million renovation on September7, 1983, replacing [...] "the incline's foundation piers, structural steel, and track." [...] The renovations were completed on August22, 1984, and the incline was rededicated on September6. It was designated an Historic Mechanical Engineering Landmark by the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) in September1994. A footbridge spanning Pennsylvania Route 56 between the incline and Vine Street was opened around the same time. On September1, 2000, the incline was closed when the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation (PennDOT) undertook an $2.3million renovation of the bridge and the access road leading to the bridge. It was reopened in April 2001, but again closed in September to allow PennDOT to finish repairs to the bridge deck. The repairs were completed on December 14, 2001. A strong thunderstorm disrupted power to the incline on April16, 2010, stranding the cars and two passengers almost halfway down the slope; the rescue took three hours and ended when firefighters rappelled down the tracks to reach the car. The Johnstown Inclined Plane was closed from September9 to October14, 2010, for the installation of a new [...] "hoist brake shaft." [...] From October 29 to October 31, 2012, CamTran shut down the incline fearing power outages due {{to the passage of}} Hurricane Sandy. During the annual Thunder in the Valley motorcycle rally, two resistors failed and stopped the incline just outside the stations on June 28, 2014; repairs took approximately a month after having experts brought in diagnose the failure. Sensor issues briefly disrupted service in August2014 and, again, December2014 forcing the incline to start its winter <b>maintenance</b> <b>period</b> early.|$|E

She next put to sea on 24 April 1953 for trials and did not resume training pilots until the following month. She was reunited with the four other carriers that served with the BPF {{for the first time}} since the war for the Coronation Fleet Review of Queen Elizabeth II on 15 June at Spithead. The following day, the Fireflies of No. 4 Squadron, RNNAS and 824 Squadron landed aboard for more deck-landing training. During September she participated in Exercise Mariner with three British squadrons of Fireflies and Sea Furies and a Dutch Squadron of Avengers. The ship resumed flying training off the north coast of Scotland in October for two weeks, but she spent most of the rest of the year on trials of the new mirror-landing system that automated the process of landing aircraft aboard. Illustrious began her final <b>maintenance</b> <b>period</b> at Devonport Royal Dockyard on 10 December. Captain K. A. Short relieved Watson on 28 December. The refit was completed by the end of January 1954 and she resumed her normal role. The ship completed 1,051 deck landings and steamed [...] by April. She made her first foreign port visit in many years at Le Havre, France, on 20–22 March, where 13,000 people came aboard. After another round of flying operations, she visited Trondheim, Norway, on 19 June. During 12 days of training in September, she completed 950 daytime and nighttime arrested landings and 210 helicopter landings. She conducted her last landings on 3 December and arrived at Devonport four days later to begin decommissioning. Illustrious was paid off at the end of February 1955 and she was towed to Gareloch and placed in reserve. She was sold on 3 November 1956 and broken up in early 1957.|$|E
