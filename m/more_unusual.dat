5|$|Among the <b>more</b> <b>unusual</b> chase {{sequences}} {{include the}} gondola sequence from Moonraker, which leaves the canals of Venice {{to continue on}} land, and the cello case chase in The Living Daylights, {{as well as a}} double-decker bus in Live and Let Die.|$|E
5|$|A {{comparable}} chamber {{work for}} an even <b>more</b> <b>unusual</b> set of instruments, the Capriccio for piano left hand, flute, two trumpets, three trombones and tenor tuba, was written for pianist Otakar Hollmann, who lost {{the use of his}} right hand during World War I. After its première in Prague on 2 March 1928, the Capriccio gained considerable acclaim in the musical world.|$|E
50|$|A party's {{share of}} the vote at a general {{election}} is not always matched at subsequent general elections, but given the five-year maximum term of a Parliament, reductions of 20% or <b>more</b> are <b>unusual.</b>|$|R
50|$|In the United Kingdom, Grundy Television {{produced}} {{a version of}} The Main Event that was broadcast on BBC One from 1 May - 24 July 1993. Chris Tarrant was the emcee. This version featured several <b>more,</b> often <b>unusual,</b> mini-games.|$|R

5|$|In the United States, the American Kennel Club(AKC) and the Labrador's breed club {{have set}} the breed {{standard}} to accommodate the field-bred Labrador somewhat. For instance, the AKC withers-height standards allow conformation dogs to be slightly taller than the equivalent British standard. However, dual champions, or dogs that excel in both {{the field and the}} show ring, are becoming <b>more</b> <b>unusual.</b>|$|E
5|$|One of Euler's <b>more</b> <b>unusual</b> {{interests}} was {{the application}} of mathematical ideas in music. In 1739 he wrote the Tentamen novae theoriae musicae, hoping to eventually incorporate musical theory as part of mathematics. This part of his work, however, did not receive wide attention and was once described as too mathematical for musicians and too musical for mathematicians.|$|E
5|$|Some of the <b>more</b> <b>unusual</b> {{proposals}} {{are that the}} Eskaya people are a Semitic proto-Christian tribe; that they possess the lost book of Enoch; that they are descended from the builders of King Solomon's temple; that their existence proves the imminence of a second Messiah in Bohol; or that they guard esoteric secrets.|$|E

60|$|It was Ozma's custom on her {{birthday}} to give a grand feast at the palace, to which all her closest friends were invited. It was a queerly assorted company, indeed, for there are <b>more</b> quaint and <b>unusual</b> characters in Oz than in {{all the rest of}} the world, and Ozma was <b>more</b> interested in <b>unusual</b> people than in ordinary ones--just as you and I are.|$|R

5|$|Tropical cyclones, {{and their}} remnants, move into New Mexico {{from both the}} eastern Pacific and Atlantic basins. Although Atlantic Basin {{tropical}} cyclones are <b>more</b> <b>unusual</b> events, the rainfall record for New Mexico was from a tropical depression which moved across Texas from the Gulf of Mexico in October 1954.|$|E
5|$|Two of the <b>more</b> <b>unusual</b> {{relationships}} are those between certain anemones (such as Adamsia, Calliactis and Neoaiptasia) and hermit crabs or snails, and Bundeopsis or Triactis anemones and Lybia boxing crabs. In the former, the anemones {{live on the}} shell of the hermit crab or snail. In the latter, the small anemones are carried in the claws of the boxing crab.|$|E
5|$|Venous {{thrombosis}} {{may also}} occur in <b>more</b> <b>unusual</b> places: in the veins of the brain, liver (portal vein thrombosis and hepatic vein thrombosis), mesenteric vein, kidney (renal vein thrombosis) and the veins of the arms. Whether thrombophilia also {{increases the risk}} of arterial thrombosis (which is the underlying cause of heart attacks and strokes) is less well established.|$|E
25|$|In 1980, Barker {{hosted a}} series called That's My Line for Goodson-Todman. The series {{was not a}} game show, but rather a program {{along the lines of}} Real People and That's Incredible! The show's second season in 1981 focused <b>more</b> on <b>unusual</b> stunts, and was {{cancelled}} in September.|$|R
40|$|During {{the past}} year, X-ray crystallographic studies of DNA {{have begun to}} focus {{not only on the}} {{relationship}} between base sequence and the fine structure of DNA, but <b>more</b> on <b>unusual</b> structures such as quadraplexes and bulges.

He {{is a man with}} secrets, bitterness, lies, and regret - and he's being watched.|$|R
5|$|While {{the show}} portrays real events among the Kalahari Meerkats, it also removes {{repetitive}} {{elements of the}} animals' lives. Because many days are filled with behaviour related to grooming and foraging, these routines were often {{left out of the}} show in favour of <b>more</b> <b>unusual</b> events.|$|E
5|$|Recorded in Los Angeles with {{producer}} David Schiffman, {{the album}} was initially released on October 20, 2009, by Indica Records in Canada. By design, the album lacks the production values of the band's debut album, Hello Master, {{in order to achieve}} a more natural sound. As the band took more progressive rock influences and applied them to their songwriting, they changed their lyrical focus and wrote about themes considered to be <b>more</b> <b>unusual</b> for rock music, such as film and television characters, for this album.|$|E
5|$|The book's {{illustrator}} is {{the well-known}} food photographer, Ben Fink, whose photographs appear in Food & Wine, Bon Appétit, Saveur and publications of the Culinary Institute of America. A native of Memphis, Tennessee now based in New York, Fink illustrated Jacques Pépin's, Fast Food My Way (2004) and Maggie Glezer's Artisan Baking Across America (2000) {{for which he}} won a James Beard Foundation Award in 2001. Some of Fink's <b>more</b> <b>unusual</b> food photographs are those for Martha Hopkins and Randall Lockridge's 1997 , where the food is photographed {{against the background of}} a naked human body.|$|E

30|$|Laparoscopy {{remains the}} gold-standard {{investigation}} for {{pelvic inflammatory disease}} but is seldom performed in such circumstances. Perhaps if more laparoscopies were performed in women with dyspareunia, <b>more</b> patients with <b>unusual</b> diagnoses would be found.|$|R
5|$|There is {{the base}} of a stone cross on Townfield Lane, and wooden stocks nearby, {{probably}} dating from the 17th century. One of the <b>more</b> <b>unusual</b> listed structures in Warburton is the 25m stretch of wall constructed from flagstones, probably built in the 18th or 19th century. There are two listed structures in the grounds of the old Church of St Werburgh: a lychgate from the late 19th century, and a sundial from 1765.|$|E
5|$|Chelsea's away colours {{are usually}} all yellow or all white with blue trim. More recently, the club {{have had a}} number of black or dark blue away kits. As with most teams, they have also had some <b>more</b> <b>unusual</b> ones. At Docherty's behest, in the 1966 FA Cup semi-final they wore blue and black stripes, based on Inter Milan's kit. In the mid-1970s, the away strip was a red, white and green kit {{inspired}} by the Hungarian national side of the 1950s. Other memorable away kits include an all jade strip worn from 1986–89, red and white diamonds from 1990–92, graphite and tangerine from 1994–96, and luminous yellow from 2007–08. The graphite and tangerine strip often appears in lists of the worst football kits ever.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Peter, {{with help}} from his {{children}} Chris and Meg, decides to create his own animated series about a trio of handicapped ducks entitled Handi-Quacks. All of Meg's reasonable and sometimes rational suggestions are shot down by Peter and Chris in favor of their <b>more</b> <b>unusual</b> and nonsensical ideas. Peter eventually fires Meg. He and Chris then decide on a joke involving a wood stove and a house of cards, and invite Cleveland, Quagmire and Joe to voice the characters. Although {{it is suggested that}} the crudely animated and developed pilot episode will likely fail, CEO Peter Chernin enjoys it and agrees to air the show, but Peter becomes angered when he suggests that the character Poopyface Tomato Nose's nose be a plum instead of a tomato. Peter's passion about his work impresses Chernin into allowing him to air the episode unedited, but he decides not to let the episode be aired at all, which he later regrets.|$|E
40|$|A case is {{reported}} of an adolescent sprinter who was chronically disabled by pain after non-operative management for an acute hamstring injury. He had sustained an avulsion fracture of the ischial apophysis with displacement of 2. 5 cm. Avulsion fractures of the ischial apophysis with displacement of 2 cm or <b>more</b> are <b>unusual,</b> but they frequently {{result in a}} symptomatic non-union, and early diagnosis, open reduction, and internal fixation is to be encouraged. ...|$|R

5|$|Pursuit of {{specific}} and narrow {{areas of interest}} {{is one of the}} most striking possible features of AS. Individuals with AS may collect volumes of detailed information on a relatively narrow topic such as weather data or star names, without necessarily having a genuine understanding of the broader topic. For example, a child might memorize camera model numbers while caring little about photography. This behavior is usually apparent by age 5 or 6. Although these special interests may change from time to time, they typically become <b>more</b> <b>unusual</b> and narrowly focused, and often dominate social interaction so much that the entire family may become immersed. Because narrow topics often capture the interest of children, this symptom may go unrecognized.|$|E
5|$|Some {{species of}} fish are {{viviparous}}. In such species the mother retains the eggs and nourishes the embryos. Typically, viviparous fish have a structure analogous to the placenta seen in mammals connecting the mother's blood supply {{with that of the}} embryo. Examples of viviparous fish include the surf-perches, splitfins, and lemon shark. Some viviparous fish exhibit oophagy, in which the developing embryos eat other eggs produced by the mother. This has been observed primarily among sharks, such as the shortfin mako and porbeagle, but is known for a few bony fish as well, such as the halfbeak Nomorhamphus ebrardtii. Intrauterine cannibalism is an even <b>more</b> <b>unusual</b> mode of vivipary, in which the largest embryos eat weaker and smaller siblings. This behavior is also most commonly found among sharks, such as the grey nurse shark, but has also been reported for Nomorhamphus ebrardtii.|$|E
5|$|Sounds {{right fielder}} Caleb Gindl became the third player in team history to hit for the cycle when he {{accomplished}} the feat on July 10, 2011. Center fielder Logan Schafer garnered national media attention when he initiated a triple play on August 20, 2011, against the Omaha Storm Chasers. What made the rare occurrence even <b>more</b> <b>unusual</b> {{is that the}} ball first bounced off Schafer's glove and head before landing in his glove for the first out. He then returned {{the ball to the}} infield where second baseman Eric Farris and first baseman Mat Gamel completed the triple play by stepping on their respective bases. With Money at the helm, Nashville ended the year with a 71–73 record, placing third in their division.|$|E
40|$|The use of {{automated}} haematological analysers {{to differentiate}} leucocytes has become <b>more</b> widespread. <b>Unusual</b> eosinophilia in a 57 year {{old man with}} liver cirrhosis, caused by hepatitis C infection, and abnormal blood counts detected using a manual method (eosinophils, 50 %) was not detected by an automated analyser using the electrical impedance method (0. 3 %) or the optical method (14. 1 %). It is important to check blood films when cell counts are apparently abnormal, even for automated haematological examination...|$|R
50|$|Until 2007 he {{had been}} {{building}} steam engine models, but then turned to <b>more</b> elaborate and <b>unusual</b> Heat Engines, especially vacuum engines such as the flame thrower, Stirling and Rankyne engines (closed cycle Butane based steam engines).
