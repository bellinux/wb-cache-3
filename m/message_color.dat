Even though there are attempts to classify consumer response to different colors, everyone perceives color differently. The physiological and emotional effect of color in each person is influenced by several factors such as past experiences, culture, religion, natural environment, gender, race, and nationality. When making color decisions, it is important to determine the target audience in order to convey the right <b>message.</b> <b>Color</b> decisions can influence both direct messages and secondary brand values and attributes in any communication. Color should be carefully selected to align with the key message and emotions being conveyed in a piece.|$|E

Austria-Hungary followed their lead. Just two weeks into the war, reporters noted of airplanes: “They have ranged constantly over the enemy’s positions, so that the French have always known what the Germans have been doing. This has so disconcerted the latter that they are now making efforts to frighten the French air scouts away.” By 17 August 1914 and repeatedly thereafter, Belgian “air scouts” reported on German troop movements.|$|R
40|$|Research on colorism {{continues}} {{to gain momentum}} across several disciplines. However, while varied studies have explored the social phenomenon among adult populations, especially those of African ancestry, few have systematically investigated {{the extent to which}} African American youth are exposed to or endorse hierarchical perceptions of skin color. The current study addresses this void in colorism literature. Employing a grounded theory approach, the present investigation examines African American female adolescents’ perceptions of skin color, aiming specifically to understand the sociocultural factors that underpin and contribute to colorist socializations as well as sources of skin <b>color</b> <b>messages.</b> Five focus groups and nine interviews were conducted with 30 African American girls ranging in age from 12 - 16. Participants were recruited from local Boys and Girls clubs, neighborhood centers, and nonprofit organizations. Participants were asked such a priori based questions as: 1) What do people think about light skin Black girls? 2) What do people think about dark skin Black girls? 3) What <b>messages</b> about skin <b>color</b> do you hear from Rap music? and 4) Do Black men and boys prefer girls of certain skin colors. Constant comparison data analysis and coding revealed African Americans girls are, in fact, exposed to and endorse hierarchical perceptions of skin color, the central phenomenon Three core categories related to the central phenomenon emerged: 1) sources of skin <b>color</b> <b>messages,</b> e. g. family and rap music 2) skin <b>color</b> <b>messages,</b> e. g. skin color governs social standing, physical attributes, and personality/behavioral traits and 3) effects of skin <b>color</b> <b>messages,</b> e. g. mate preferences, desires to change one’s appearance, and within-race division. From these three core categories emerged seven subcategories and themes that offer additional information and insight into the central phenomenon. Findings from this study indicate African American young females are significantly influenced by skin color preferences, and thus may stand to gain from the development of curricula or programs designed to counter colorist stereotypes, reduce the effects of skin color biases, and promote a greater sense of self-satisfaction and wellbeing...|$|R

40|$|International audienceIn this work, {{we propose}} {{to extend the}} secure {{information}} display introduced by Yamamoto et al. [1] to full color images. Yamamoto's technique makes use of black and transparent mask as decoding shadow image of a visual cryptography scheme sharing 3 bits multi-color messages. By combining perspective setup together with a color visual cryptography (VC) scheme which does not use any mask, we can securely display color images. A satisfying color VC scheme is used which can be printed on a transparency film. When printed, colors act as filters [2] and allow a wider color gamut for the message which {{is not limited to}} saturated color as in [1] because of the black and transparent mask as decoding shadow image. In our implementation of the two-out-of-two visual cryptography scheme which shares a secret <b>message</b> into two <b>color</b> shadow images, the first one is projected onto a glass diffuser and the second one is printed on a transparency. A registration method is used in order to overcome the difficulty of shadow image alignment. As the two shadow images are superposed with an air layer, the message disappears when the angular position is not close to the ideal one. Examples with binary <b>colored</b> <b>messages</b> and with <b>color</b> images are provided to show the extension. By moving the detector (or the eyes) angularly around the right position, perspective effects can be perceived...|$|R

40|$|Perhaps rarely {{is there}} any piece of Pre-Islamic Arabic {{literature}} where color features more strongly and less naturally than in Antara’s poetry. Therefore, the intended <b>message</b> of <b>color</b> in Antara’s poetry is adequately understood inasmuch as the pragmatic implicatures of color are worked out. Evidence in literature explicitly attributes Antara’s extraordinary concern with color to the dramatic impact of his dark complexion, which is, in turn, closely reflected in his careful choice of the lexical elements and black poetic images and metaphors throughout his poetic works. However, none of the previous attempts, devoted to analyzing his poetry, has pointed {{to the possibility of}} the involvement of pragmatics, pretext or abstract context in the interpretation of color. That is, color has been always interpreted literally in all the previous studies devoted to exploring Antara’s poetry. This article argues that much of the <b>message</b> of <b>color</b> in Antara’s works goes beyond the natural or literal meaning, and thus, much of the color story has not been revealed yet.   To this end, an attempt is made here to reveal the color subtext via a psycho-pragmatic construct. Results reveal that Antara skillfully and purposely uses color in an attempt to: (i) alleviate the negative connotations clung to blackness via associating it with all that of precious values, immortality, elegance, eternity and strength and (ii) belittle the prevailing social values associated with whiteness by using it in contexts where blackness outweighs whiteness...|$|R

Satellite television also began a digital transition, well before over-the-air broadcasting did the same, to increase satellite capacity and/or {{reduce the size of}} the receiving antennas; this also made it more difficult for individuals to intercept these signals. Eventually, the industry began to cater to individuals who wanted to continue to receive satellite television (and were willing to pay for it) in two ways: by authorizing the descrambling of the original satellite feeds to the cable television operators, and with new direct broadcast satellite television services using their own satellites. These latter services, which began operating in the mid-1990s, offer programming similar to cable television.|$|R

But the public key is known to everyone and so anyone can encrypt the data and send the message. Hence authentication of users is needed. In this technique we use RGB color model to provide authentication. Every user will have a unique color assigned to him. A sender must know the receiver’s color to send a <b>message.</b> The <b>color</b> value is encrypted using a key which {{is used as a}} password while decrypting the message.
