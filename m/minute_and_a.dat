5|$|In a squad {{with much}} less star power than that {{sent to the}} Tour de France, they were again {{middle of the pack}} in the team time trial, {{finishing}} 11th of 22 teams. The squad did not show themselves much, as it was not until stage 10 that they so much as finished in the top ten on a stage. Phinney took fifth place in the stage 10 individual time trial, a <b>minute</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> half off the pace of the day's winner Tony Martin. Frank rode to fourth from a breakaway in the next stage, again a <b>minute</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> half off the pace of the day's winner, this time David Moncoutié. All the team had to show for itself from {{the second half of the}} Vuelta was a seventh place from Van Avermaet in the field sprint finish to stage 12. Six BMC riders reached the Vuelta's finish, with Van Avermaet in 83rd place being their highest overall finisher.|$|E

Down by 16 {{entering}} the fourth quarter, and 10 with a <b>minute</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> half to go, the Lakers mounted a furious rally in the closing moments which fell just short. After dropping to 36 wins and losing {{in the first round}} of the 1967 NBA Playoffs, they {{lost in the}} finals to the Celtics again in 1968. Los Angeles moved to a brand-new arena, The Forum, in 1967, after playing seven seasons at the Los Angeles Memorial Sports Arena.|$|E

Symantec set several goals for version 2009 while in development: complete installations under <b>minute</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> footprint of 100 MB. Average installation times range from {{eight to ten}} minutes, and the previous 2008 version had a 400 MB footprint. Other goals included reducing load time after the computer starts, from 20–30 seconds to 10 seconds, and file scanning times with a technology allowing Norton to skip certain trusted files.

5|$|As {{the month}} progressed, Benfica made some squad adjustments, selling Francisco Fonseca back to Mexico and {{replacing}} him with Derlei on a loan from Dynamo Moscow. They then sold Ricardo Rocha to Tottenham Hotspur, and signed David Luiz, also on a loan deal, as his replacement. On 21 January, Benfica played the fifth {{round of the}} Portuguese Cup against União de Leiria. Harison scored first for Leiria, but Benfica countered with an equalizer friom Nuno Gomes in the 80th <b>minute</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> winning goal from Mantorras five minutes later. Rui Costa was happy with the comeback because Benfica remained in all three fronts. Benfica's last match of January was a visit to Restelo to play Belenenses. Costa assisted Simão for the opening goal and before half time assisted Luisão for the second, with Benfica winning 2–1.|$|E
5|$|Stage 12 into Briançon in France was the Giro's first high {{mountain}} stage, and it shook up the standings {{for the final}} time. Di Luca took the stage win, twice attacking from an elite group of five that had made the climb together. As Noè finished nearly ten minutes behind, Di Luca took the pink jersey for a third time, while still holding the green jersey. As Di Luca concentrated on winning the race overall, Piepoli took the green jersey after stage 15, the race's queen stage, topping two of that stage's climbs in first position. His lead in the mountains classification quickly became unassailable, and he won the jersey in Milan. It was also on this stage that 's Eddy Mazzoleni distinguished himself as a podium contender, taking a <b>minute</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> half out of Di Luca to move into second overall. Schleck lost time to Di Luca and Mazzoleni, but gained time over other riders {{in the top of}} the overall standings and stood third overall.|$|E

Furthermore, the main ballast tanks could be blown from either end of the ship.|$|E
5|$|The Road World Championships {{took place}} in Cancellara's native country Switzerland and he stated that he wished to win both events. Cancellara {{dominated}} the time trial event and won {{by a margin of}} close a <b>minute</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> half over the second-place finisher. This was Cancellara's third world championship in the time trial discipline, which was tied for most ever with Australia's Michael Rogers. Cancellara's next goal was the road race, which was to take place three days later. During the final lap of the race, Cancellara crossed the gap to the race's leading group that had just formed. At the bottom of the final climb Cadel Evans (Australia) attacked, but no other riders reacted. Cancellara crossed the line in fifth.|$|E
5|$|The team {{picked up}} their first single-day win {{the same day}} as the more prestigious Tour of Flanders, in which they participated but were not {{especially}} competitive, with Duque in 19th their best finisher. The race they won was the inaugural Flèche d'Emeraude, a new race in the UCI Europe Tour and the French Road Cycling Cup. Gallopin came first {{at the head of a}} field sprint in Saint-Malo. Zingle figured into a winning breakaway at the Brabantse Pijl, the precursor to the Ardennes classics. He took seventh place, a <b>minute</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> half back of the winner Philippe Gilbert. Vogondy was sixth at the Tour du Finistère, finishing with a big main group behind two leaders.|$|E

50|$|In {{his second}} NHL season, Berg again had {{difficulties}} {{staying on the}} Kings' lineup. He nonetheless raised his level of play, scoring his first two goals. He played 41 games for the Kings, scoring two goals and adding 6 assists, while getting 24 penalty <b>minutes</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> -9 rating. In 23 games for the Roadrunners, Berg had 1 goal, 3 assists, 21 penalty <b>minutes</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> -9 rating. During the season Berg also represented Finland in the World Junior Championships, having 2 assists in 8 games.|$|R
5|$|Early in {{the third}} period Eric Staal tied the game at seven with his first goal of the game. Minutes later Duchene got a breakaway, but before he could take a shot, Ovechkin threw his stick at the puck, {{resulting}} in the first penalty shot in All-Star game history, and only the third penalty assessed during the past ten years of All-Star competition. Duchene took the shot against Henrik Lundqvist, who stopped the attempt. Kris Letang scored shortly after the penalty shot to give back the lead to Team Staal. Briere scored a little over a minute later assisted by Weber and Henrik Sedin to re-tie the game. Weber's assist was his fourth of the game making him the second defenceman in history to record four assists in an All-Star Game (Ray Bourque, 1985). Team Lidstrom added two more goals before Rick Nash scored to cut the deficit to one. With about a <b>minute</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> half left in the game, Team Staal pulled their goaltender for the extra attacker. The decision backfired as Eriksson scored on the empty net with 1:11 remaining. Eric Staal scored with 33.6 seconds remaining to bring his team back within one goal, but they failed to get another shot on goal before time ran out. By coming back from a four-goal deficit to win the game Team Lidstrom set the record for biggest comeback victory in All-Star history. Lidstrom finished the game with a +7 rating, the highest rating since 1991 when Adam Oates was also a +7 for the Wales Conference. Tim Thomas earned the victory becoming the first goaltender to win three straight All-Star Games. Patrick Sharp was named Most Valuable Player (MVP) after registering one goal and two assists in a losing cause for Team Staal. The combined 21 goals was the fourth highest total in NHL All-Star Game history.|$|E
5|$|Florida State {{received}} the post-score kickoff merely needing {{to run down}} the clock to secure its lead and the win. Twocomplete passes set up a third-and-two for Drew Weatherford, but his third-down pass fell short, stopping the clock and forcing a Florida State punt. Only a <b>minute</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> half had run off the clock, and Virginia Tech recovered the punt at its 22-yard line. On the second play after the punt, Florida State committed a pass interference penalty that gave Virginia Tech 15automatic yards and a first down. As in the previous drive, the penalty kick-started the Virginia Tech offense. On the next play, Vick connected with Josh Morgan on a 50-yard pass—the longest offensive play of the game—that drove the Hokies to the Florida State nine-yard line. After that, a Florida State holding penalty gave Virginia Tech a first-and-goal from inside the FSU five-yard line. Marcus Vick scrambled fouryards for the touchdown, and {{what had been a}} 24-point Seminole lead was now cut to 11points. The drive had taken just 55seconds off the clock, and it appeared that Virginia Tech still had a chance to make it a close game. As before, Virginia Tech attempted a two-point conversion, and as before, it failed. With 10:50 remaining in the game, the score was now Florida State 27, Virginia Tech 15.|$|E
5|$|In {{the cross}} country events, {{the heat of}} 45°C (113°F), caused all but 15 of the 38 {{competitors}} to abandon the race. Eight finishers were taken away on stretchers. One athlete began to run in tiny circles after reaching the stadium, until setting off into the stands and knocking himself unconscious. Early leader Wide {{was among those who}} blacked out along the course, and was incorrectly reported to have died at the hospital. Nurmi exhibited only slight signs of exhaustion after beating Ritola to the win by nearly a <b>minute</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> half. As Finland looked to have lost the team medal, the disoriented Liimatainen staggered into the stadium, but was barely moving forward. An athlete ahead of him fainted 50 metres from the finish, and Liimatainen stopped and tried to find his way off the track, thinking he had reached the finish line. After having ignored shouts and kept the spectators in suspense for a while, he turned into the right direction, realised his situation and reached the finish in 12th place and secured team gold. Those present at the stadium were shocked by what they had witnessed, and Olympic officials decided to ban cross country running from future Games.|$|E

5|$|Liverpool {{continued}} to press forward following their goal. Carroll found Gerrard with a headed {{pass in the}} 71st minute, but Gerrard's shot went over the crossbar. Two minutes later a shot by Suárez was saved by Čech and out for a Liverpool corner, but Agger's header from the resulting corner went wide. Carroll {{had a number of}} chances in the subsequent minutes, but none of his headers were on target. Chelsea replaced goalscorer Ramires with midfielder Raul Meireles in the 76th <b>minute</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> minute later Bellamy was replaced by Dirk Kuyt for Liverpool. A minute after the substitution Suárez worked his way into the Chelsea half, his pass to Kuyt was cleared, but it fell to Henderson, whose shot went over the Chelsea goal. Carroll thought he equalised in the 81st minute when his header from a Suárez cross was then palmed by Čech onto the underside of the bar and away to safety. Carroll ran away celebrating his second goal, but after consulting with his assistant, referee Phil Dowd did not award the goal. Replays of the incident remain ambiguous. Liverpool {{continued to}} push forward for the equaliser in the closing minutes, but they were unable to score and the match finished 2–1 to Chelsea.|$|E
5|$|On 21 February 2016, Totti {{publicly}} criticised returning manager – and Rudi García's replacement – Luciano Spalletti in {{the media}} for his lack of playing time since his return from injury. He was subsequently dropped for Roma's 5–0 win over Palermo, with the decision causing an uproar among the fans and {{in the media}}, while rumours once again began to circulate that Totti would be leaving the club once his contract had expired {{at the end of}} the season, as a result of his limited appearances and clashes with Spalletti. On 8 March, Totti came on as a substitute for Stephan El Shaarawy in the return leg of the round of 16 of the UEFA Champions League against Real Madrid, and was given a standing ovation by the fans at the Santiago Bernabéu Stadium in Madrid; Roma lost the match 2–0, however, and were eliminated from the competition following a 4–0 aggregate loss. On 20 April, he came off the bench in the 86th minute, one goal down to Torino at home to rescue the team with a brace; one in the 87th <b>minute</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> penalty in the 89th minute to win the match 3–2. With his 69th goal in Serie A from the penalty spot, he overtook Roberto Baggio as the outright top scorer of penalties in Serie A history. Totti's double also made him the oldest player in Serie A history to score two goals in a single league match, at the age of 39 years, 6 months and 23 days, breaking Silvio Piola's previous record of 39 years, 4 months and 2 days, which he had managed with Novara on 1 February 1953, after scoring a brace against his former team Lazio.|$|E
5|$|The Trojans next {{stayed on}} the road and faced the fifteenth–ranked Arizona State Sun Devils, led by fifth–year head coach Dirk Koetter and quarterback Sam Keller. With both offenses {{struggling}} in the first quarter, Sun Devil, Terry Richardson, opened scoring on an 84-yard punt return for a touchdown. The Trojans answered early in the second quarter with a field goal, however, two touchdowns, a Keller pass and a Keegan Herring rush, gave the Sun Devils an 18-point half-time lead. Starting in the third quarter the Trojans got on track with a pair of rushing touchdowns to bring their deficit to four, and midway through the fourth quarter they took the lead on a quarterback sneak by Leinart. Keller drove the Sun Devils to another touchdown to take back the lead, but two more rushing touchdowns by the Trojans, within a <b>minute</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> half, gave them the win, 38–28. Reggie Bush and LenDale White both ran for over 150yards to help the Trojans win their Pac-10 record 26th consecutive game. Helping to seal the win for the Trojans were their defense who sacked Keller five times and caused him to throw five interceptions. Before the game, Keller, in his first year as a starter, had thrown for 2,165yards in seven games.|$|E

5|$|Though Evans was the {{stronger}} {{of the two}} against the clock, Schleck had surpassed expectations in the long time trial at the 2010 Tour de France, leading to speculation as to whether his 57-second cushion over the Australian could be sufficient for him to win the Tour. Evans rode {{one of the best}} time trials of his career, finishing in second place seven seconds off the pace of Tony Martin, the rider who was crowned world time trial champion later that year. Andy said of his and his brother's rides that they were probably the best time trials likewise of their respective careers, but they were no match for Evans' performance. The Australian was two and a half minutes better than both of them, taking the overall lead by a <b>minute</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> half with Andy slipping to second and Fränk to third. Since the Tour's final stage is traditionally mostly ceremonial save for a final sprint finish, the time trial effectively cemented the final overall standings. Andy took the positive from the result, saying he and his brother were both proud of each other for their efforts and were excited to stand on the podium together in Paris, even if neither of them was on the top step.|$|E
