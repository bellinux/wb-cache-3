He won his third consecutive title over the half marathon distance with ease, taking the lead early on and beating the second-placed Patrick Makau Musyoki by almost two minutes. His success caused much celebration in his home country, so <b>much</b> <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> President of Eritrea greeted him at the airport upon his return. With a strong history in the half marathon, Zersenay announced he would try the full marathon distance the following season.|$|E
5|$|Following {{his term}} as governor, Powell {{was elected to}} the U.S. Senate. Before he could assume office, President James Buchanan {{dispatched}} Powell and Major Benjamin McCulloch to Utah to ease tensions with Brigham Young and the Mormons. Powell assumed his Senate seat on his return from Utah, just prior to the election of Abraham Lincoln as president. Powell became an outspoken critic of Lincoln's administration, so <b>much</b> <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Kentucky General Assembly asked for his resignation and some of his fellow senators tried to have him expelled from the body. Both groups later renounced their actions.|$|E

5|$|In Congress, the {{influential}} senator and losing presidential candidate Rui Barbosa championed the rebels' cause. Barbosa used the navy official's rhetoric {{against them in}} arguing for a diplomatic solution, noting that if the new dreadnoughts were as unsinkable as they claimed, the remaining warships in government hands would certainly {{not be able to}} force a military victory. Furthermore, he argued, if such an attack had the support of Congress and failed, any resulting destruction of Rio de Janeiro would be held at fault. These arguments won Barbosa much support in the Senate, so <b>much</b> <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> body began working on an amnesty that would absolve the mutineers of all criminal charges once the ships were turned back over to the government. After hours of debate, the bill was passed unanimously that day and sent to the lower Chamber of Deputies on 25 November.|$|E
5|$|King Leopold, {{on holiday}} in Paris, wants to visit Monte Carlo, {{but does not}} have time for the seventeen-hour express train ride between the two cities. He happens upon an {{automobile}} maker who claims his car can make the distance in just two hours. The King agrees and sets off in the car, with the auto maker acting as chauffeur. A large crowd sees them off from outside the Paris Opera House, including many celebrities from the Paris theatre world. After stopping to fill the car with gas, the King starts it and, from inexperience, accidentally runs it backward over a policeman, who is squashed flat as a pancake. The King starts inflating him with a pump, and then, to save time, lets other onlookers finish the job while he drives off. The onlookers set to the work with gusto, so <b>much</b> <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> overinflated policeman ends up exploding.|$|E
5|$|A {{few weeks}} {{following}} this, the bad blood {{between the two}} sides intensified, so <b>much</b> <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> new management of TNA (now renamed Impact Wrestling) Anthem Sports & Entertainment issued a cease and desist letter to The Hardys' new promotion Ring of Honor (ROH), in which Anthem essentially ordered ROH as well as any broadcasting company airing ROH's 15th Anniversary pay–per–view show (on which The Hardys were to participate in a match) to not in any way speak of, indicate or acknowledge the existence of the Broken Matt and Brother Nero characters and instead to refer to The Hardys as simply Matt Hardy and Jeff Hardy. The issue with this is that while The Hardys were in TNA, they had full creative control over the Broken gimmick, with them even filming their own segments to air on TNA programming in some circumstances, thus making the Hardy family (in their belief) the owners of the Broken gimmick. It is believed that civil litigation will follow and a potential court hearing will take place regarding the final outcome on who owns the Broken gimmick: Anthem or the Hardy family. Until then, the status of the Broken gimmick remains undecided. Despite this, Matt continues to use the Broken gimmick through his social media accounts, but neither him or Jeff use the Broken gimmick at any professional wrestling shows for ROH or on the independent circuit, presumably until the results of the expected legal proceedings have been finalized.|$|E

5|$|At 18:00, {{with the}} rest of the pursuit far behind, Paulet succeeded in {{bringing}} Gloire within range of the cannon on his ship's quarterdeck. Opening fire with these guns brought a response from Beens' sternchaser guns, the frigates exchanging cannon shot for four and a half hours as Astraea slowly caught up with its elusive opponent. At 22:30, Paulet was finally close enough to lay Astraea alongside Gloire and the two frigates exchanged fire at close range for the next 58 minutes, Paulet concentrating his gunnery on the hull of the French ship while Beens' ordered his men to disable the British ship's rigging and masts. Gloire was a substantially larger ship than Astraea, both in weight of shot and gross tonnage, and the battle was fiercely contested: Beens suffered a head injury and all three of Astraeas topmasts taking serious damage, so <b>much</b> <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> main topmast collapsed in the aftermath of the action. However at 23:28, with two British ships of the line visible in the distance, Beens surrendered his ship to Paulet.|$|E
5|$|Cooper {{handed over}} to Group Captain Val Hancock, former {{commanding}} officer of No.100 Squadron, in April 1945. To maximize support to Australian ground troops in the lead-up to the final assault on Wewak, No.71 Wing's three extant Beaufort squadrons were joined by two more, Nos.6 and 15. Approximately sixty Beauforts and Boomerangs struck Japanese positions behind Dove Bay prior to amphibious landings on 11May to cut off retreating enemy troops. Over the entire month, the wing dropped more than 1,200 tons of bombs and flew in excess of 1,400 sorties. By mid-year, the wing was again acutely short of fuel and ordnance, so <b>much</b> <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> squadrons took to arming their Beauforts with captured Japanese bombs. On 9July, enough supplies arrived to enable the wing to continue operating at nominal strength. No.71 Wing was active to {{the last day of}} the Pacific War, flying its final combat mission involving thirty Beauforts only hours before news arrived of victory on 15August 1945. Thereafter its squadrons dropped leaflets to remaining pockets of Japanese resistance, making them aware of the surrender. The last entry in No.71 Wing's operations book was for 21January 1946 at Tadji, New Guinea. The headquarters was disbanded six days later.|$|E

25|$|The poet {{seems to}} have been {{inspired}} by the Kirātārjunīya of Bharavi, and intended to emulate and even surpass it. Like the Kirātārjunīya, the poem displays rhetorical and metrical skill more than the growth of the plot and is noted for its intricate wordplay, textual complexity and verbal ingenuity. It has a rich vocabulary, so <b>much</b> <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> (untrue) claim has been made that it contains every word in the Sanskrit language.|$|E

25|$|Another {{restriction}} on GPS, antispoofing, remains on. This encrypts the P-code {{so that it}} cannot be mimicked by a transmitter sending false information. Few civilian receivers have ever used the P-code, and the accuracy attainable with the public C/Acode was much better than originally expected (especially with DGPS). So <b>much</b> <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> antispoof policy has relatively little effect on most civilian users. Turning off antispoof would primarily benefit surveyors and some scientists who need extremely precise positions for experiments such as tracking tectonic plate motion.|$|E
25|$|Generally speaking, any {{research}} that combines psychological principles with legal applications or contexts {{could be considered}} legal psychology (although research involving clinical psychology, e.g., mental illness, competency, insanity defense, offender profiling, etc., is typically categorized as forensic psychology, and not legal psychology). For a time, legal psychology researchers were primarily focused on issues related to eyewitness testimony and jury decision-making; so <b>much</b> <b>so,</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> editor of Law and Human Behavior, the premier legal psychology journal, implored researchers to expand the scope of their research {{and move on to}} other areas.|$|E
