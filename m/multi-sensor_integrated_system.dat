40|$|This paper takes {{advantage}} of the complementary characteristics of Global Positioning System (GPS) and Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) to provide periodic corrections to Inertial Navigation System (INS) alternatively in different environmental conditions. In open sky, where GPS signals are available and LiDAR measurements are sparse, GPS is integrated with INS. Meanwhile, in confined outdoor environments and indoors, where GPS is unreliable or unavailable and LiDAR measurements are rich, LiDAR replaces GPS to integrate with INS. This paper also proposes an innovative hybrid scan matching algorithm that combines the feature-based scan matching method and Iterative Closest Point (ICP) based scan matching method. The algorithm can work and transit between two modes depending on the number of matched line features over two scans, thus achieving efficiency and robustness concurrently. Two integration schemes of INS and LiDAR with hybrid scan matching algorithm are implemented and compared. Real experiments are performed on an Unmanned Ground Vehicle (UGV) for both outdoor and indoor environments.

40|$|Constraints {{can provide}} {{additional}} aids to a <b>multi-sensor</b> <b>integrated</b> navigation <b>system</b> and hence can increase {{accuracy of the}} solution and enhance reliability of the <b>system.</b> To <b>integrate</b> the constraints with {{the data from the}} sensors, the traditional integration Kalman filter (IKF) needs to be reconstructed. A new algorithm, the so-called constrained adaptive robust integration Kalman filter (CARIKF) is presented, which implements adaptive integration upon the robust direct fusion solution. In the algorithm the raw observations from all heterogeneous sensors are corrected by the pseudoobservations derived from state equality constraint. The posterior covariances of the corrected observations are subsequently estimated upon the robust maximum-likelihood-type estimation (M-estimation) theory. The fusion state and its covariance are solved for all sensors further in the least squares (LS) sense. The pseudoobservations are constructed according to the estimated state and its covariance. They are further combined with the dynamic model of the host platform in an adaptive Kalman filter (AKF), from which a reliable and accurate navigation solution can be then obtained. A state constraint model is proposed upon Newton’s forward differential extrapolation numerical method. To demonstrate performance of the CARIKF algorithm, simulations have been conducted in different dynamic and observation scenarios. Several algorithms are compared to evaluate the validity and efficiency of the CARIKF. The results show that the CARIKF is superior to other algorithms and can significantly improve the precision and reliability of the integrated solution...|$|R

40|$|To {{address the}} {{navigation}} and positioning demands for military, marine, surveying, mapping, civil construction {{and many other}} uses, a number of innovative technologies {{have been developed to}} suit different environments, including technologies based on global navigation satellite system (GNSS), inertial navigation system (INS), terrestrial ranging, vision-based navigation, WIFI signals and others. The different characteristics of these individual systems result in a number of challenges for successful integration. One of the most challenging issues is the fault detection and exclusion (FDE) procedure used within <b>integrated</b> <b>multi-sensor</b> navigation <b>systems.</b> The primary objective of this thesis is to investigate from a geometrical perspective the benefits of integrating multiple sensors to system stability and reliability. Issues such as separability analysis of FDE are studied and applied to GNSS/INS, GNSS/Locata/INS, and GNSS/WIFI/INS integration systems. The major contributions of this research are: a) 	A theoretical extension of the separability analysis of the data-snooping FDE method. The outlier (fault) detection test with two alternative hypotheses has been extended to handle multiple alternative hypotheses. The geometrical effects that cause missed detection and wrong exclusion were studied. A more accurate and reliable estimation of the minimal detectable bias (MDB) has been proposed so as to improve the success rate of the outlier detection procedure. Performance studies were conduct using a single-epoch GPS point positioning scenario. b) 	An optimal receiver autonomous integrity monitoring (RAIM) -based FDE method was applied to GPS. It has been found that the probabilities of committing missed detection and wrong exclusion can be theoretically estimated to aiding in deciding whether or not the faulty pseudorange data can be correctly identified. c) 	The FDE performance of loosely and tightly coupled GPS/INS integration system for land vehicle navigation was investigated and evaluated using some road tests. d) 	Different integration architectures for GPS/Locata/INS <b>integrated</b> <b>system</b> have been investigated and compared with respect to navigation accuracy, reliability and integrity. The influence of LocataNet configuration on the performance of Locata-aided navigation systems was investigated. e) 	A GPS/WIFI/INS integration system for seamless pedestrian navigation has been developed.

In order to improve WIFI positioning accuracy, map-based information has been introduced into the fingerprinting database.

40|$|With recent {{advances}} of lidar technology, the accuracy potential of lidar data has significantly improved. State-of-the-art lidar systems can achieve 2 to 3 cm ranging accuracy under ideal conditions, {{which is the}} accuracy level required by engineering scale mapping. However, {{this is also the}} accuracy range that cannot be realized by routine naviga-tion-based direct sensor platform orientation. Furthermore, lidar <b>systems</b> are highly <b>integrated</b> <b>multi-sensor</b> <b>systems,</b> and the various components, as well as their spatial relation-ships, introduce different errors that can degrade the lidar data accuracy. Even after careful system calibration, includ-ing individual sensor calibration and sensors intra-calibra-tion, certain errors in the collected data can still be present. These errors are usually dominated by navigation errors and cannot be totally eliminated without introducing absolute control information into the lidar data. Therefore, to support applications that require extremely high, engineering scale mapping accuracy, such as transportation corridor mapping, we propose the use of lidar-specific ground targets. Simula-tions were performed to determine the most advantageous lidar target design and targets were fabricated based upon the simulation results. To investigate the potential of using control targets for lidar data refinement, test flights were carried out with different flight parameters and target distributions. This paper provides a description of the optimal lidar target design, the target identification algo-rithm, and a detailed performance analysis, including the investigation of the achievable lidar data accuracy improve-ment using lidar-specific ground control targets in the case of various target distributions and flight parameters...|$|R
40|$|Space {{surveillance}} requires capabilities for detection, tracking, {{imaging and}} characterization of specific objects in space environment. In general, most current space surveillance systems are single-sensor based {{and are not}} capable of generating the desired tracking accuracy, and providing required object characterization. A suite of various types of the sensors that are spatially or temporarily separated may thus be used collectively to synthesize a composite, improved surveillance picture through fusion and post processing of retrieved data. However, this approach will not yield the highest possible data accuracy due to the errors introduced in correlation of location, orientation and detection time from different sensors. Furthermore, it may not provide timely surveillance data to the user and hence may degrade the utility of these data. In this paper, we present the architecture, operational concept and preliminary design of an advanced <b>integrated</b> <b>multi-sensor</b> <b>system</b> (AIMS) for enhanced space surveillance capability to alleviate these shortfalls.

40|$|To {{provide a}} long-time {{reliable}} orientation, sensor fusion technologies {{are widely used}} to integrate available inertial sensors for the low-cost orientation estimation. In this paper, a novel dual-linear Kalman filter was designed for a <b>multi-sensor</b> <b>system</b> <b>integrating</b> MEMS gyros, an accelerometer, and a magnetometer. The proposed filter precludes the impacts of magnetic disturbances on the pitch and roll which the heading is subjected to. The filter can achieve robust orientation estimation for different statistical models of the sensors. The root mean square errors (RMSE) of the estimated attitude angles are reduced by 30. 6 % under magnetic disturbances. Owing to the reduction of system complexity achieved by smaller matrix operations, the mean total time consumption is reduced by 23. 8 %. Meanwhile, the separated filter offers greater flexibility for the system configuration, as {{it is possible to}} switch on or off the second stage filter to include or exclude the magnetometer compensation for the heading. Online experiments were performed on the homemade miniature orientation determination system (MODS) with the turntable. The average RMSE of estimated orientation are less than 0. 4 ° and 1 ° during the static and low-dynamic tests, respectively. More realistic tests on two-wheel self-balancing vehicle driving and indoor pedestrian walking were carried out to evaluate the performance of the designed MODS when high accelerations and angular rates were introduced. Test results demonstrate that the MODS is applicable for the orientation estimation under various dynamic conditions.

40|$|<b>Integrated</b> <b>multi-sensor</b> <b>systems,</b> {{with their}} major {{progress}} {{in terms of}} sensor resolution, data rate and operational flexibility, have become a very attractive mapping tool over the last decade. In aerial mapping application, for example, Exterior Orientation (EO) parameters for the imaging sensors are required. Using the integrated Differential Global Positioning System (DGPS) with Inertial Measurement Units (IMU), direct determination of the EO parameters {{can be obtained from}} the <b>integrated</b> <b>system</b> navigation solution. This process is referred to as Direct Georeferening (DG). DG provides substantial benefits over the indirect determination method of estimating the EO parameters from conventional Aerial Triangulation (AT) techniques using a block of images with a sufficient number of known control points. These benefits include the ability to map remote and inaccessible regions, and by replacing tie point measurements/matching and AT, significant cost-savings can be obtained for projects that do not require stereo models (such as projects with existing DEM or single image). The accuracy of DG, however, is limited by the accuracy attainable by the DGPS and any residual datum calibration errors. These can typically be as large as 10 cm RMSE, which is not sufficient for some large scale mapping applications. However, by combining the direct EO data a traditional block adjustment, AT techniques can be used to remove the residual errors in the solution. This technique is known as Integrated Sensor Orientation (ISO). It has several advantages over traditional AT, primarily because the stable geometry provided by direct EO can reduce the number of required GCP and tie-point to a minimum. At the same time, ISO provides an excellent tool for Quality Control/Quality Assurance (QC/QA) of the EO derived from a DG system. This paper examines the factors that determine the system performance for ISO. In addition, examples are given to illustrate the expected accuracy of an aerial mapping project using ISO under different qualities of DGPS/IMU data...|$|R

40|$|In {{the last}} few years Homeland Security (HS) has gained a {{considerable}} interest in the research community. From a scientific point of view, it is a difficult task to provide a definition of this research area and to exactly draw up its boundaries. In fact, {{when we talk about the}} security and the surveillance, several problems and aspects must be considered. In particular, the following factors play a crucial role and define the complexity level of the considered application field: the number of potential threats can be high and uncertain; the threat detection and identification can be made more complicated by the use of camouflaging techniques; the monitored area is typically wide and it requires a large and heterogeneous sensor network; the surveillance operation is strongly related to the operational scenario, so that it is not possible to define a unique approach to solve the problem [1]. Information Technology (IT) can provide an important support to HS in preventing, detecting and early warning of threats. Even though the link between IT and HS is relatively recent, sensor integration and collaboration is a widely applied technique aimed to aggregate data from multiple sources, to yield timely information on potential threats and to improve the accuracy in monitoring events [2]. A large number of sensors have already been developed to support surveillance operations. Parallel to this technological effort in developing new powerful and dedicated sensors, interest in integrating a set of stand-alone sensors into an <b>integrated</b> <b>multi-sensor</b> <b>system</b> has been increasing. In fact, rather than to develop new sensors to achieve more accurate tracking and surveillance systems, it is more useful to integrate existing stand-alone sensors into a single system in order to obtain performance improvements In this dissertation, a notional <b>integrated</b> <b>multi-sensor</b> <b>system</b> acting in a maritime border control scenario for HS is considered. In general, a border surveillance system is composed of multiple land based and moving platforms carrying different types of sensors [1]. In a typical scenario, described in [1], the <b>integrated</b> <b>system</b> is composed of a land based platform, located on the coast, and an airborne platform moving in front of the coast line. In this dissertation, we handle two different fundamental aspects. In Part I, we focus on a single sensor in the system, i. e. the airborne radar. We analyze the tracking performance of such a kind of sensor in the presence of two different atmospheric problems: the turbulence (in Chapter 1) and the tropospheric refraction (in Chapter 2). In particular, in Chapter 1, the losses in tracking accuracy of a turbulence-ignorant tracking filter (i. e. a filter that does not take into account the effects of the atmospheric turbulences) acting in a turbulent scenario, is quantified. In Chapter 2, we focus our attention on the tropospheric propagation effects on the radar electromagnetic (em) signals and their correction for airborne radar tracking. It is well known that the troposphere is characterized by a refractive index that varies with the altitude and with the local weather. This variability of the refractive index causes an error in the radar measurements. First, a mathematical model to describe and calculate the em radar signal ray path in the troposphere is discussed. Using this mathematical model, the errors due to the tropospheric propagation are evaluated and the corrupted radar measurements are then numerically generated. Second, a tracking algorithm, based on the Kalman Filter, that is able to mitigate the tropospheric errors during the tracking procedure, is proposed. In Part II, we consider the <b>integrated</b> <b>system</b> in its wholeness to investigate a fundamental prerequisite of any data fusion process: the sensor registration process. The problem of sensor registration (also termed, for naval system, the grid-locking problem) arises when a set of data coming from two or more sensors must be combined. This problem involves a coordinate transformation and the reciprocal alignment among the various sensors: streams of data from different sensors must be converted into a common coordinate system (or frame) and aligned before they could be used in a tracking or surveillance system. If not corrected, registration errors can seriously degrade the global system performance by increasing tracking errors and even introducing ghost tracks. A first basic distinction is usually made between relative grid-locking and absolute grid-locking. The relative grid-locking process aligns remote data to local data under the assumption that the local data are bias free and that all biases reside with the remote sensor. The problem is that, actually, also the local sensor is affected by bias. Chapter 3 of this dissertation is dedicated to the solution of the relative grid-locking problem. Two different estimation algorithms are proposed: a linear Least Squares (LS) algorithm and an Expectation-Maximization-based (EM) algorithm. The linear LS algorithm is a simple and fast algorithm, but numerical results have shown that the LS estimator is not efficient for most of the registration bias errors. Such non-efficiency could be caused by the linearization implied by the linear LS algorithm. Then, in order to obtain a more efficient estimation algorithm, an Expectation-Maximization algorithm is derived. In Chapter 4 we generalize our findings to the absolute grid-locking problem. Part III of this dissertation is devoted to a more theoretical aspect of fundamental importance in a lot of practical applications: the estimate of the disturbance covariance matrix. Due to its relevance, in literature it can be found a huge quantity of works on this topic. Recently, a new geometrical concept has been applied to this estimation problem: the Riemann (or intrinsic) geometry. In Chapter 5, we give an overview on the state of the art of the application of the Riemann geometry for the covariance matrix estimation in radar problems. Particular attention is given for the detection problem in additive clutter. Some covariance matrix estimators and a new decision rule based on the Riemann geometry are analyzed and their performance are compared with the classical ones.

The implementation of <b>integrated</b> <b>systems</b> in the private sector is well documented. However, <b>integrated</b> <b>systems</b> are still a relatively new phenomenon in the public sector. One of the researchers of this paper was working as an accountant, in Cork County Council in Ireland, when it deciding to, and then tendering for, a new computerised <b>integrated</b> <b>system.</b> Recognising the gap in the literature in this regard, and having the opportunity to act as participant observers, the researchers decided this would be a worthy area of research. This study is a descriptive case study examining the decision to implement, and the tendering process for, an <b>integrated</b> <b>system</b> i...|$|R

40|$|Many {{advanced}} applications need {{to access}} and in-tegrate resources and {{services provided by}} distributed, autonomous, and heterogeneous <b>systems.</b> Building an <b>integrated</b> <b>system</b> to provide uniform access and co-operation among these underlying heterogeneous sys-tems is both an increasing necessity and a formidable challenge. An important component of such a com-plex <b>integrated</b> <b>system</b> is a language that would serve both as a data definition and as a data manipulation tool. Special requirements are posed in the instance of an <b>integrated</b> <b>system</b> which includes database systems among its components. In this paper, we present the necessary constructs that an object-oriented program-ming language should provide for being adopted as {{the language of the}} <b>integrated</b> <b>system</b> in such a setting. ...|$|R

My thesis includes the evaluation of the efficiency of <b>integrated</b> <b>system</b> of management quality, human safety and environment and after that there is included the valuation of the company in two versions. The first version reflects the real situation, the company has implemented the <b>integrated</b> <b>system</b> of management quality, human safety and environment. The second version reflects the hypothetical situation, in this settings the company wouldn't have the <b>integrated</b> <b>system.</b> The difference between these two valuation is the financial gain of this system...|$|R

This paper uses the power bond graph method to establish nonlinear coupling mathematical model of the <b>integrated</b> <b>system</b> of electromagnetic brake and frictional brake and conducts the contrastive analysis on the dynamic characteristics based on this mathematical model. Meanwhile, the accuracy of the nonlinear coupling mathematical model proposed above is verified on the hardware in the loop simulation platform, and nonlinear coupling characteristics of the <b>integrated</b> <b>system</b> are also analyzed through experiments...|$|R
