40|$|AbstractObjectiveIn {{the first}} years after the finding of HIV-infection, the main was for its {{transmission}} among western women was the intravenous drug addiction. The objective of our work consisted in evaluating the main social and clinical characteristics {{of a group of}} seropositive mothers, and in analyzing their potential relationship with intravenous consumption of drugs. MethodWe performed an observational prospective study in 220 HIV-infected women who had recently given birth to children with high risk for infection. We included every women at an HIV Unit of a hospital in Valencia who had been diagnosed of HIV infection at any moment between the first motherchild transmission reported in 1985 and 1993. The analysis was based on univariate analysis. ResultsThe virus transmission was produced by heterosexual relations in a 27, 7 % of the study women and due to the parenteral drug addiction in 69, 1 %. We detected more women who had an abortion, with criminal antecedents and parental abandonment among those who were intravenous drug users (IVDU), with OR of 1. 8 (p = 0. 087), 8. 95 (p = 0. 012) and 15 (p = 0. 000), when compared with those mothers non-IVDU.

40|$|SummaryA single {{exposure}} to <b>drugs</b> of <b>abuse</b> produces an NMDA receptor (NMDAR) -dependent long-term potentiation (LTP) of AMPA receptor (AMPAR) currents in DA neurons; however, {{the importance of}} LTP for various aspects of drug addiction is unclear. To test the role of NMDAR-dependent plasticity in addictive behavior, we genetically inactivated functional NMDAR signaling exclusively in DA neurons (KO mice). Inactivation of NMDARs results in increased AMPAR-mediated transmission that is indistinguishable from the increases associated with a single cocaine exposure, yet locomotor responses to <b>multiple</b> <b>drugs</b> of <b>abuse</b> were unaltered in the KO mice. The initial phase of locomotor sensitization to cocaine is intact; however, the delayed sensitization that occurs with prolonged cocaine withdrawal did not occur. Conditioned behavioral responses for cocaine-testing environment were also absent in the KO mice. These findings provide evidence for a role of NMDAR signaling in DA neurons for specific behavioral modifications associated with drug seeking behaviors...|$|R

We developed and validated an LCâ€“MS/MS method for simultaneous identification of <b>multiple</b> <b>abused</b> <b>drugs,</b> benzodiazepines, and new psychoactive substances in urine from suspected drug abusers. The instrument was operated in multiple-reaction monitoring using an electrospray ionization mode. Chromatograms were separated using an ACE 5 C 18 column on a gradient of acetonitrile. After liquidâ€“liquid extraction, samples were {{passed through a}} 0. 22 -Î¼m polyvinylidene difluoride filter before injection into the LCâ€“MS/MS. The limits of quantitation ranged from 0. 5 Â ng/mL to 31. 3 Â ng/mL. The linearity ranged from 0. 5 Â ng/mL to 200 Â ng/mL. The precision results were below 15. 4 % (intraday) and 18. 7 % (interday). The intraday accuracy ranged from 85. 9 % to 121. 0 %; interday accuracy ranged from 66. 1 % to 128. 7 %. The proposed method was applied to 769 urine samples. The most common three drugs identified were ketamine, amphetamine, and opiates. The drug positive rate for one or more drugs was 79. 6 %.

40|$|DARPP- 32 (dopamine- and cAMP-regulated phosphoprotein) is {{a potent}} {{endogenous}} inhibitor of protein phosphatase- 1, which {{plays an important role}} in dopaminergic transmission. A large body of evidence supports the key role of DARPP- 32 -dependent signalling in mediating the actions of <b>multiple</b> <b>drugs</b> of <b>abuse,</b> including cocaine, which, when acutely administered, increases the Thr(34) phosphorylation of DARPP- 32 in the striatal and cortical areas. In this study, we have examined the contribution of the kappa opioid system to the regulation of DARPP- 32 phosphorylation at Thr(34), following acute cocaine administration, in selected rat brain areas. Results showed that a single injection of cocaine induces a significant increase in DARPP- 32 phosphorylation at Thr(34) in the hippocampus, caudate putamen and prefrontal cortex. In addition, pretreatment with the kappa opioid receptor agonist U- 69593 prevented cocaine effects in all the investigated areas.

Microfiche. viii, 105 leaves, bound ill. 29 cmA {{retrospective}} study was run examining {{the utility of}} the stylus-maze test as part of a more extensive neuropsychological test battery. The stylus-maze test is thought to measure learning ability in the visual-spatial realm, making minimal demands on verbal or higher level abstracting ability. Selected neuropsychological test results including the stylus-maze test results were compiled for eight groups of subjects. Four of these groups were defined in terms of location of cortical lesions. These were: (1) right hemisphere, (2) left hemisphere, (3) bilateral not restricted to frontal lobes (bilateral), and (4) bilateral frontal (anterior). In addition, four groups defined in terms of medical history were examined: (1) subjects with histories of chronic <b>multiple</b> <b>drug</b> <b>abuse</b> (polydrug), (2) chronic alcoholics, (3) schizophrenics, and (4) learning disabled subjects. A group of normal controls was given the stylus-maze test only. As predicted on the basis of previous research on the stylus-maze test, subjects with right hemisphere and bilateral cortical lesions were highly impaired on this test in comparison to subjects with left hemisphere lesions and controls. Polydrug abusers were found to be fully as impaired in maze learning as the right hemisphere and bilateral cases which was a surprising finding. Subjects with anterior cortical lesions, alcoholics, and schizophrenics were also judged to be moderately impaired in maze learning, left hemisphere cases and learning disabled subjects were not. The results of a factor analysis were interpreted as suggesting that a visual-spatial perceptual defect underlies faulty maze learning for the subject pool (except controls) as a whole. In addition, a number of methods of scoring the stylus-maze test were examined for their ability to distinguish between subject groups. It was concluded that this test is sensitive to brain pathology of various kinds and is potentially valuable {{as a part of a}} more comprehensive neuropsychological test battery.

40|$|Further to a {{previous}} article about codeine-containing medicinal products (March 2004) and recent publicity regarding possible inappropriate use, the Irish Medicines Board wishes to again highlight among healthcare professionals {{the importance of}} discussing use of all medications (including non-prescribed medicinal products) with patients/consumers. In addition, patients should be advised {{about the need to}} strictly adhere to the recommended dosage and duration of use and to avoid chronic use, which is associated with dependence. Health care professionals are also reminded of the following: Use of codeine is contra-indicated in patients with respiratory depression. Opioid analgesics such as codeine should be given with care to patients receiving tricyclic antidepressants or monamine oxidase inhibitors. The effect of CNS depressants (including alcohol) may be potentiated by codeine. Codeine can produce typical opioid effects including constipation, nausea, vomiting, dizziness, lightheadedness, confusion, drowsiness and urinary retention. The frequency and severity are determined by dosage, duration of treatment and individual sensitivity. Codeine is a narcotic analgesic and no more than the recommended dose should be taken in any 24 -hr period. Consumption of quantities in excess of the recommended dose, or for a prolonged period of time, may lead to tolerance, psychological and physical dependence and may result in symptoms such as restlessness and irritability upon cessation of this medicine. Since 1981, the IMB has received a total of eight Adverse Drug Reaction (ADR) reports of dependence associated with use of codeine-containing medicinal products, all of which arose with prolonged use and/or doses exceeding those recommended. The volume of these spontaneous ADR reports and available literature reviews suggest the overall number of reports of misuse is small, compared with the volume of sales of the products. However, recent information has highlighted anecdotal concerns raised from some areas around the country, which appear from the currently available information to have mainly arisen in the context of <b>multiple</b> <b>drug</b> <b>abuse.</b> To ensure a complete and comprehensive overview of the national experience of this issue is available for review and evaluation, the IMB requests healthcare professionals to notify any suspected cases of tolerance/dependence/addiction as soon as possible, in the usual way.

40|$|<b>Drugs</b> of <b>abuse</b> {{share the}} ability to enhance dopaminergic {{neurotransmission}} in the dorsal and ventral striatum. The action of dopamine is modulated by additional neurotransmitters, including glutamate, serotonin and adenosine. All these neurotransmitters regulate the phosphorylation state of Dopaminal serine/threonine protein phosphatase, PP- 1. Phosphorylatine- and cAMP-regulated phosphoprotein, Mr 32 kDa (DARPP- 32). Phosphorylation at Thr 34 by protein kinase A converts DARPP- 32 into a potent inhibitor of the multifunctioon at Thr 75 by Cdk 5 converts DARPP- 32 into an inhibitor of protein kinase A. The state of phosphorylation of DARPP- 32 at Thr 34 also depends on the phosphorylation state of Ser 97 and Ser 130, which are phosphorylated by CK 2 and CK 1, respectively. By virtue of regulation of these 4 phosphorylation sites, and through its ability to modulate the activity of PP- 1 and protein kinase A, DARPP- 32 {{plays a key role}} in integrating a variety of biochemical, electrophysiological, and behavioral responses controlled by dopamine and other neurotransmitters.

40|$|AbstractBackground: <b>Drugs</b> of <b>abuse</b> have {{a common}} {{property}} in mammals, which is their ability to facilitate {{the release of the}} neurotransmitter and neuromodulator dopamine in specific brain regions involved in reward and motivation. This increase in synaptic dopamine levels is believed to act as a positive reinforcer and to mediate some of the acute responses to drugs. The mechanisms by which dopamine regulates acute drug responses and addiction remain unknown. Results: We present evidence that dopamine plays a role in the responses of Drosophila to cocaine, nicotine or ethanol. We used a startle-induced negative geotaxis assay and a locomotor tracking system to measure the effect of psychostimulants on fly behavior. Using these assays, we show that acute responses to cocaine and nicotine are blunted by pharmacologically induced reductions in dopamine levels. Cocaine and nicotine showed a high degree of synergy in their effects, which is consistent with an action through convergent pathways. In addition, we found that dopamine is involved in the acute locomotor-activating effect, but not the sedating effect, of ethanol. Conclusions: We show that in Drosophila, as in mammals, dopaminergic pathways play a role in modulating specific behavioral responses to cocaine, nicotine or ethanol. We therefore suggest that Drosophila {{can be used as a}} genetically tractable model system in which to study the mechanisms underlying behavioral responses to <b>multiple</b> <b>drugs</b> of <b>abuse...</b>|$|R

Due to the increasing clinical use of dual orexin receptor antagonists in the treatment of disorders such as insomnia, we examined whether a dual orexin receptor antagonist may also be effective in reducing nicotine seeking. We tested the effect of intracerebroventricular (i. c. v.) administration of the potent and selective dual orexin receptor antagonist TCS 1102 on orexin-A-induced food self-administration, nicotine self-administration and reinstatement of nicotine-seeking in rats. Our results show that 30 Î¼g of TCS 1102 i. c. v. abolishes orexin-A-induced increases in food self-administration but does not reduce nicotine self-administration. Neither i. c. v. 10 Î¼g nor 30 Î¼g of TCS 1102 reduced compound reinstatement after short-term (15 days) self-administration nicotine, but 30 Î¼g transiently reduced cue/nicotine compound reinstatement after chronic self-administration (29 days). These results indicate that TCS 1102 has no substantial effect on motivation for nicotine seeking following chronic self-administration and no effect after shorter periods of intake. Orexin receptor antagonists may therefore have little clinical utility against nicotine addiction...|$|R

Paradigms investigating the suppression of actions have been investigated in animal and human research on drug addiction.

40|$|Abstract Background The mouse C 57 BL/ 6 (C 57) and DBA/ 2 J (DBA) inbred strains differ {{substantially}} in {{many aspects of}} their response to <b>drugs</b> of <b>abuse.</b> The development of microarray analyses represents a genome-wide method for measuring differences across strains, focusing on expression differences. In the current study, we carried out microarray analysis in C 57 and DBA mice in the nucleus accumbens of drug-naÃ¯ve and morphine-treated animals. Results We identified mRNAs with altered expression between the two strains. We validated the mRNA expression changes of several such mRNAs, including Gnb 1, which has been observed to be regulated by several <b>drugs</b> of <b>abuse.</b> In addition, we validated alterations in the enzyme activity of one mRNA product, catechol-O-methyltransferase (Comt). Data mining of expression and behavioral data indicates that both Gnb 1 and Comt expression correlate with aspects of drug response in C 57 /DBA recombinant inbred strains. Pathway analysis was carried out to identify pathways showing significant alterations {{as a result of}} treatment and/or due to strain differences. These analyses identified axon guidance genes, particularly the semaphorins, as showing altered expression in the presence of morphine, and plasticity genes as showing altered expression across strains. Pathway analysis of genes showing strain by treatment interaction suggest that the phosphatidylinositol signaling pathway may represent an important difference between the strains as related to morphine exposure. Conclusion mRNAs with differing expression between the two strains could potentially contribute to strain-specific responses to <b>drugs</b> of <b>abuse.</b> One such mRNA is Comt and we hypothesize that altered expression of Comt may represent a potential mechanism for regulating the effect of, and response to, multiple substances of abuse. Similarly, a role for Gnb 1 in responses to <b>multiple</b> <b>drugs</b> of <b>abuse</b> is supported by expression data from our study and from other studies. Finally, the data support a role for semaphorin signaling in morphine effects, and indicate that altered expression of genes involved in phosphatidylinositol signaling and plasticity might also affect the altered drug responses in the two strains. </p...|$|R
40|$|Natural {{rewards and}} {{addictive}} drugs increase {{the release of}} dopamine (DA) in the brain's reward circuit by augmenting the activity of dopaminergic neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA). Exposure to <b>drugs</b> of <b>abuse</b> produces persistent adaptations in neural signaling, both excitatory and inhibitory. G protein-gated inwardly rectifying potassium (GIRK or Kir 3) channels activate a slow inhibitory postsynaptic current in dopamine neurons mediated by GABA(B) or D 2 receptors and {{are involved in the}} response to <b>multiple</b> <b>drugs</b> of <b>abuse.</b> How the psychostimulants methamphetamine or cocaine affect GIRK channel signaling, however, remains unclear. This thesis describes novel mechanisms of GIRK channel plasticity and regulation in VTA dopamine and GABA neurons in response to methamphetamine. Activation of dopamine neurons induces a biphasic response of GABA(B) R-GIRK signaling in VTA, with short-term drug exposure down-regulating GABA(B) R-GIRK signaling in GABA neurons, increasing VTA inhibition, while repeated methamphetamine exposure down-regulates GABA(B) R-GIRK currents in DA neurons through a mechanism involving GIRK 3 -containing channels, dis-inhibiting DA neurons. SNX 27 is an endosomal trafficking protein that regulates the surface expression and signaling of GIRK 3 channels and is inducible by repeated exposure to psychostimulants. Through conditional deletion of SNX 27, I describe the first neuronal function of a sorting nexin in vivo, which is regulation of GABA(B) R-GIRK signaling and inhibitory control of VTA DA neurons. Mice lacking SNX 27 in DA neurons display hyperlocomotion in a novel environment and an enhanced sensitivity to the locomotor- stimulant effects of cocaine, suggesting that SNX 27 regulation of GIRK channel signaling is involved in addictive behaviors. The data presented in this dissertation thus identify novel mechanisms of psychostimulant-induced plasticity in the VTA and highlight SNX 27 and GIRK channels as promising therapeutic targets for addiction and other complex psychiatric disorder...|$|R

The {{purpose of this}} study was to determine whether smoking cessation after entering <b>drug</b> <b>abuse</b> treatment influenced <b>drug</b> use 12 months after <b>drug</b> <b>abuse</b> treatment. We analyzed 2316 cigarette smokers in the <b>Drug</b> <b>Abuse</b> Treatment Outcome Study (DATOS), a national, longitudinal study of <b>drug</b> <b>abuse</b> treatment. Heckman probit selection models assessed the association of self-reported smoking cessation while in <b>drug</b> <b>abuse</b> treatment on self-reported drug abstinence in the year after treatment completion, while simultaneously accounting for possible nonparticipation bias. Controlling for multiple factors, smoking cessation was associated with greater abstinence from drug use after completion of <b>drug</b> <b>abuse</b> treatment (P=. 04). Despite <b>drug</b> <b>abuse</b> treatment programs 2 Ì† 7 hesitance to encourage smokers to quit, smoking cessation does not negatively impact drug use outcomes...|$|R

The model presents data on which to base eve 7 'yday judgments about <b>drug</b> <b>abuse,</b> to plan for <b>drug</b> <b>abuse</b> services, and to allocate limited resources on local levels. <b>Drug</b> <b>abuse</b> indicators and their rationale for selection are explored, including <b>drug</b> <b>abuse</b> treatment admissions, hepatitis morbidity, and <b>drug</b> <b>abuse</b> violation arrests. Methods for acquiring these data, including samples of various data collection Instruments, are discussed. The experiences of a local community are used as an example to suggest that implementation of this paradigm requires the cooperation of various <b>drug</b> <b>abuse</b> agencies and data sources.

40|$|Forensic hair {{evidence}} {{can be used}} {{to obtain}} retrospective timelines of drug use by analysis of hair segments. However, this is a laborious and time-consuming process, and mass spectrometric (MS) imaging techniques, which show great potential for single-hair targeted analysis, are less useful due to differences in hair growth rate between individual hairs. As an alternative, a fast untargeted analysis method was developed that uses direct analysis in real timeâ€“high-resolution mass spectrometry (DART-HRMS) to longitudinally scan intact locks of hair without extensive sample preparation or segmentation. The hair scan method was validated for cocaine against an accredited liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS) method. The detection limit for cocaine in hair was found to comply with the cutoff value of 0. 5 ng/mg recommended by the Society of Hair Testing; that is, the DART hair scan method is amenable to forensic cases. Under DART conditions, no significant thermal degradation of cocaine occurred. The standard DART spot size of 5. 1 Â± 1. 1 mm could be improved to 3. 3 Â± 1. 0 mm, corresponding to approximately 10 days of hair growth, by using a high spatial resolution exit cone. By use of data-dependent product ion scans, <b>multiple</b> <b>drugs</b> of <b>abuse</b> could be detected in a single drug user hair scan with confirmation of identity by both exact mass and MS/HRMS fragmentation patterns. Furthermore, full-scan high-resolution data were retrospectively interrogated versus a list of more than 100 compounds and revealed additional hits and temporal profiles in good correlation with reported drug use...|$|R

40|$|Is <b>drug</b> <b>abuse</b> a disease? What causes <b>drug</b> <b>abuse?</b> How can <b>drug</b> <b>abuse</b> be best {{prevented}} or treated? This concise {{and comprehensive}} overview unravels the complexities surrounding the definition, cause {{and treatment of}} <b>drug</b> <b>abuse.</b> The authors set out the different classes of <b>drugs</b> of <b>abuse,</b> distinguish <b>drug</b> use from <b>abuse,</b> and consider whether or not <b>drug</b> <b>abuse</b> {{should be seen as}} a disease. They go on to examine other compulsive behaviors, such as eating disorders and pathological gambling, for their similarities and differences from <b>drug</b> <b>abuse,</b> and detail current methods of assessing <b>drug</b> <b>abuse.</b> Numerous extra-personal and intra-personal predictors of <b>drug</b> use and <b>abuse</b> are examined, including drug distribution systems, and biological factors, as well as social psychological factors. Finally, the authors present the wide spectrum of current prevention and treatment programs and discuss future directions in the prevention and cessation of <b>drug</b> <b>abuse.</b> This book takes an international approach and provides vital information on key issues, presenting its material from a social psychological perspective, but drawing on work in public health, clinical psychology and sociology. Each chapter provides a summary and tables to help the reader integrate the information. It will prove invaluable not only to undergraduate and postgraduate students, but to counselors, researchers, and policy makers...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study was to assess communityâ€™s {{involvement}} in prevention of <b>drug</b> <b>abuse</b> among youth in the Tanzania the case of Kinondoni Municipality in Dar es Salaam region. The primary objective was to examine and to find out how the local communities are involved in <b>drug</b> <b>abuse</b> prevention, their community strategies or initiatives in <b>drug</b> <b>abuse</b> control and to find out why <b>drug</b> <b>abuse</b> persists despite the measures taken by the government to control <b>drug</b> <b>abuse</b> in the country. The study findings revealed that, the local have not yet involved in the prevention of <b>drug</b> <b>abuse</b> among youth in the country from the local community level to national legislation and institutions. Most of <b>drug</b> <b>abuse</b> prevention effort has been done by the government and non government organization. The existing policies and legislations also do not recognize the role of local communities in fighting <b>drug</b> <b>abuse</b> among the community and the nation at large. The local communities lack or have inadequate resources and not well informed about the <b>drug</b> <b>abuse</b> and its impact on the community. The main factor that leads youth to engage in <b>drug</b> <b>abuse</b> has been the lack of employment and peer group pressure. Apart from that, the study shows that people believe that participations and involvement of communities in the prevention effort will help reduce the problem and its impact among the youth. Many respondents shown concern that, the government is not doing enough effort to prevent <b>drug</b> <b>abuse</b> in the country since there many loopholes for drug traffickers and dealers to conduct this business in the country. Based on the research findings a number of recommendations have been made in order to address the problem of <b>drug</b> <b>abuse</b> by involving the local communities...|$|R
