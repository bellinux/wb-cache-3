5|$|The {{magnetic}} field produced by an atom—its magnetic moment—is determined by these {{various forms of}} angular momentum, just as a rotating charged object classically produces a {{magnetic field}}. However, the most dominant contribution comes from electron spin. Due {{to the nature of}} electrons to obey the Pauli exclusion principle, in which no two electrons may be found in the same quantum state, bound electrons pair up with each other, with one member of each pair in a spin up state and the other in the opposite, spin down state. Thus these spins cancel each other out, reducing the total <b>magnetic</b> <b>dipole</b> <b>moment</b> to zero in some atoms with even number of electrons.|$|E

500|$|The {{main part}} of Earth's {{magnetic}} field is generated in the core, {{the site of a}} dynamo process that converts the kinetic energy of thermally and compositionally driven convection into electrical and magnetic field energy.

At the equator of the magnetic field, the magnetic-field strength at the surface is , with global <b>magnetic</b> <b>dipole</b> <b>moment</b> of [...] The convection movements in the core are chaotic; the magnetic poles drift and periodically change alignment.

500|$|In 1924, Austrian {{physicist}} Wolfgang Pauli {{observed that}} the shell-like structure of the atom {{could be explained by}} a set of four parameters that defined every quantum energy state, as long as each state was occupied by no more than a single electron. This prohibition against more than one electron occupying the same quantum energy state became known as the Pauli exclusion principle. The physical mechanism to explain the fourth parameter, which had two distinct possible values, was provided by the Dutch physicists Samuel Goudsmit and George Uhlenbeck. [...] In 1925, they suggested that an electron, in addition to the angular momentum of its orbit, possesses an intrinsic angular momentum and <b>magnetic</b> <b>dipole</b> <b>moment.</b> This is analogous to the rotation of the Earth on its axis as it orbits the Sun. The intrinsic angular momentum became known as spin, and explained the previously mysterious splitting of spectral lines observed with a high-resolution spectrograph; this phenomenon is known as fine structure splitting.|$|E

[...] Throughout the 1930s and 1940s it was not readily apparent which of these two mechanisms caused the neutron's intrinsic magnetic moment. [...] In 1930, E. Fermi showed that the magnetic moments of nuclei (including the proton) are Ampèrian. The two kinds of magnetic moments experience different forces in a magnetic field.

5000|$|The {{ground state}} of neutral {{hydrogen}} {{consists of an}} electron bound to a proton. Both the electron and the proton have intrinsic <b>magnetic</b> <b>dipole</b> <b>moments</b> ascribed to their spin, whose interaction results in {{a slight increase in}} energy when the spins are parallel, and a decrease when antiparallel. The fact that only parallel and antiparallel states are allowed {{is a result of the}} quantum mechanical discretization of the total angular momentum of the system. When the spins are parallel, the <b>magnetic</b> <b>dipole</b> <b>moments</b> are antiparallel (because the electron and proton have opposite charge), thus one would expect this configuration to actually have lower energy just as two magnets will align so that the north pole of one is closest to the south pole of the other.

[...] The neutron interacts with normal matter through either the nuclear force or its magnetic moment. [...] The neutron's magnetic moment is exploited to probe the atomic structure of materials using scattering methods and to manipulate the properties of neutron beams in particle accelerators. [...] The neutron was determined to have a magnetic moment by indirect methods in the mid 1930s. [...] Luis Alvarez and Felix Bloch made the first accurate, direct measurement of the neutron's magnetic moment in 1940. [...] The existence of the neutron's magnetic moment indicates the neutron is not an elementary particle. [...] For an elementary particle to have an intrinsic magnetic moment, it must have both spin and electric charge. [...] The neutron has spin 1/2ħ, but it has no net charge. [...] The existence of the neutron's magnetic moment was puzzling and defied a correct explanation until the quark model for particles {{was developed in the}} 1960s.
