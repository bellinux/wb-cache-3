In 2011, the government conceded that the equipment required was not available in the lab calling into question a key pillar of the FBI's case, that Ivins had produced the anthrax in his lab. According to Worsham, the lab's equipment for drying spores, a machine the size of a refrigerator, was not in containment so that it would be expected that non-immunized personnel in that area would have become ill. Colleagues of Ivins at the lab have asserted that he couldn't have grown the quantity of anthrax used in the letters without their noticing it.|$|E
500|$|Pei's work {{is celebrated}} {{throughout}} the world of architecture. His colleague John Portman once told him: [...] "Just once, I'd like {{to do something like}} the East Building." [...] But this originality does not always bring large financial reward; as Pei replied to the successful architect: [...] "Just once, I'd like to <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> money you do." [...] His concepts, moreover, are too individualized and dependent on context to give rise to a particular school of design. Pei refers to his own [...] "analytical approach" [...] when explaining the lack of a [...] "Pei School". [...] "For me," [...] he said, [...] "the important distinction is between a stylistic approach to the design; and an analytical approach giving the process of due consideration to time, place, and purpose... My analytical approach requires a full understanding of the three essential elements... to arrive at an ideal balance among them." ...|$|E
500|$|... "A Time Machine Is My New Girlfriend" [...] is a frenetic rocker with a Bo Diddley rhythm, {{and lyrics}} cautioning {{listeners}} that relationships can come with [...] "late fees". Hunt explained its lyrics to be {{a metaphor for}} his lover making him feel younger. The title track features metronomic drumming and chicken scratch riffs. It is about people from different economic classes falling in love after social and economic conditions moved them into the same neighborhood. The setting is described in the first verse, [...] "It's the end of white flight / even tycoons are licking their wounds / economic blight got the neighborhood looking gap-toothed / end of white flight / maybe now you see something you like / money tight and you're hating your life". Hunt said that writing the song was [...] "essentially a response {{to some of the}} things I have seen {{as a result of the}} global recession we are going through. I wasn't trying to make any political statement. I was more making a philosophical comment that essentially says we have all these unspoken issues in our society. But I see a collision of those ideas and unresolved issues. My question is what could you have been hoping for when we <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> decisions in our society that we have made." ...|$|E

2500|$|After Kennedy {{gave his}} July 25, 1969 {{televised}} speech regarding the incident, supporters responded with telephone calls and telegrams to newspapers {{and to the}} Kennedy family. They were heavily in favor of his remaining in office, and he was re-elected in 1970, with 62% of the vote, a margin of nearly a half million votes. Nonetheless, the incident severely damaged his national reputation and reputation for judgment; one analyst asked, [...] "Can we really trust him if the Russians come over the ice cap? Can he <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> split-second decisions the astronauts had to make in their landing on the moon?" [...] Before Chappaquiddick, public polls showed that a large majority expected Kennedy {{to run for the}} presidency in 1972. After the incident, he pledged not to run in 1972 and declined to serve as George McGovern's running mate that year. In 1974, he pledged not to run in 1976, {{in part because of the}} renewed media interest in Chappaquiddick.|$|E

They produced a psychological thriller film called Tumbling After which garnered an Award of Merit at the Accolade Film Festival. In 2011, Lowenthal and Platt produced Shelf Life, a web series where they act as action figures in a Toy Story-like environment, but with more adult humor. Lowenthal {{said in an interview that}} he wanted to make a show for nerds: [...] "I wanted to <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> thing that my friends and I would watch.

60|$|He had, at least, the consolation--if it were one--of {{reflecting}} {{that his}} reputation was safe, {{that there would}} be no scandal, since two are necessary to <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> scandal he had always feared, and Miss Bumpus, apparently, had no intention of being the second party. Yet she was not virtuous, as he had hitherto defined the word. Of this he was sure. No woman who moved about as she did, who had such an effect on him, who had on occasions, though inadvertently, returned the lightning of his glances, whose rare laughter resembled grace notes, and in whose hair was that almost imperceptible kink, could be virtuous. This instinctive conviction inflamed him. For the first time in his life he began to doubt the universal conquering quality of his own charms,--and when such a thing happens to a man like Ditmar he is in danger of hell-fire. He indulged less and less in the convivial meetings and excursions that hitherto had given him relaxation and enjoyment, and if his cronies inquired as to the reasons for his neglect of them he failed to answer with his usual geniality.|$|E
60|$|Data are {{not those}} things of which our {{consciousness}} is earliest in time. At every period of life, {{after we have}} become capable of thought, some of our beliefs are obtained by inference, while others are not. A belief may pass from either of these classes into the other, and may therefore become, or cease to be, a belief giving a datum. When, in what follows, I speak of data, I do not mean the things of which we feel sure before scientific study begins, but the things which, when a science is well advanced, appear as affording grounds for {{other parts of the}} science, without themselves being believed on any ground except observation. I assume, that is to say, a trained observer, with an analytic attention, knowing the sort of thing to look for, and {{the sort of thing that}} will be important. What he observes is, at the stage of science which he has reached, a datum for his science. It is just as sophisticated and elaborate as the theories which he bases upon it, since only trained habits and much practice enable a man to <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> observation that will be scientifically illuminating. Nevertheless, when once it has been observed, belief in it is not based on inference and reasoning, but merely upon its having been seen. In this way its logical status differs from that of the theories which are proved by its means.|$|E

5000|$|Whilst {{denying the}} {{existence}} of a [...] "state of hypnosis", Tsander has since the early 1990s presented [...] "close up" [...] sessions in which volunteers sit with him at a table whilst the audience sit or stand adjacent.

50|$|The {{theory of}} value {{is closely related}} to that of allocative efficiency, the quality by which firms produce those goods and {{services}} most valued by society.
