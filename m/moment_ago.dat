500|$|Later {{on in his}} speech, President Reagan said, [...] "As I {{looked out}} a <b>moment</b> <b>ago</b> from the Reichstag, that {{embodiment}} of German unity, I noticed words crudely spray-painted upon the wall, perhaps by a young Berliner, 'This wall will fall. Beliefs become reality.' Yes, across Europe, this wall will fall. For it cannot withstand faith; it cannot withstand truth. The wall cannot withstand freedom." ...|$|E
500|$|Whitehead {{pointed to}} the {{limitations}} of language {{as one of the}} main culprits in maintaining a materialistic way of thinking, and acknowledged that {{it may be difficult to}} ever wholly move past such ideas in everyday speech. [...] After all, each moment of each person's life can hardly be given a different proper name, and it is easy and convenient to think of people and objects as remaining fundamentally the same things, rather than constantly keeping in mind that each thing is a different thing from what it was a <b>moment</b> <b>ago.</b> [...] Yet the limitations of everyday living and everyday speech should not prevent people from realizing that [...] "material substances" [...] or [...] "essences" [...] are a convenient generalized description of a continuum of particular, concrete processes. [...] No one questions that a ten-year-old person is quite different by the time he or she turns thirty years old, and in many ways is not the same person at all; Whitehead points out that it is not philosophically or ontologically sound to think that a person is the same from one second to the next.|$|E

(Recitative: Dormono entrambi ... non vedran la mano che li percuote / [...] "They are both asleep ... they shall not see the hand which strikes them.") [...] But she cannot bring herself to do it: (Aria: Teneri, teneri figli, Essi, pur dianzi delizia mia / [...] "My dear, dear sons; a <b>moment</b> <b>ago</b> they were my delight, in their smiles, I thought I saw the forgiveness of heaven.") [...] The children wake up and she calls for Clotilde, demanding that Adalgisa be brought to her.|$|E
60|$|Letitia, who to David's keen {{observation}} seemed {{already to}} have lost something of that strange new quality which she had shown to him only a few <b>moments</b> <b>ago,</b> shook her head.|$|R
2500|$|Bertrand Russell (1872–1970) — British philosopher. In a footnote, {{the story}} refers (accurately) to his {{conjecture}} that (in Borges's words) [...] "our planet was created a few <b>moments</b> <b>ago,</b> and {{provided with a}} humanity which 'remembers' an illusory past." ...|$|R
50|$|The episode {{ends with}} Isobel’s (Mia Kirshner) return and her going to Jenna’s house. She {{introduces}} herself as Alaric's ex-wife, something that shocks Jenna since a few <b>moments</b> <b>ago</b> Alaric {{was telling her}} once again that Isobel is dead.|$|R
60|$|Domiloff looked anxious. A <b>moment</b> <b>ago</b> {{the affair}} had seemed settled.|$|E
60|$|Lady Underhill {{uttered a}} faint moan. Freddie {{noticed that she}} was looking deucedly chippy, even chippier than a <b>moment</b> <b>ago.</b>|$|E
6000|$|Madame Merle stared, {{and indeed}} she was justly bewildered. [...] "Ah, a <b>moment</b> <b>ago</b> I thought you seemed rather to disparage her." ...|$|E

60|$|But I {{could not}} make the other man see it. I felt that some service was due from me to Justice, in {{compensation}} of the wrong I had done her a few <b>moments</b> <b>ago,</b> and I argued most eloquently.|$|R
6000|$|... "I put {{you up to}} nothing. I didn't {{even put}} you up to the chance that, as I said a few <b>moments</b> <b>ago,</b> I saw for you in {{forwarding}} that thing. Your liberty is therefore in every way complete." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'My dear Kate,' said Mrs Nickleby, {{kissing her}} {{daughter}} affectionately. 'How ill you looked a <b>moment</b> <b>ago!</b> You quite frightened me, I declare!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, sir. I {{could have}} sworn I had heard you moving in there not a <b>moment</b> <b>ago.</b> It's most extraordinary... very sorry, sir." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't {{know her}} name--she was {{over by the}} door a <b>moment</b> <b>ago.</b> I asked {{somebody}} and was told, I think, that she's American." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Pardon an {{inquisitive}} compatriot, madam," [...] I said; [...] "but I {{heard you}} a few <b>moments</b> <b>ago</b> address this young lady {{by the name of}} a very dear young friend, whom I knew twenty years ago--Sarah Walker. Am I right?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{would have}} been inexcusable if I had {{forgotten}} you," [...] he answered with a smile. [...] "Still, I couldn't quite place you until a few <b>moments</b> <b>ago,</b> when you faced the light. But you were wrong in one thing; I'm no longer Lieutenant Blake." ...|$|R
5000|$|Cosell: [...] "That's a live shot again, of {{that fire}} in the south Bronx that Keith called to your {{attention}} just a few <b>moments</b> <b>ago.</b> Wonder how many alarms are involved? But as Keith said, the fire department really has its {{work cut out for}} it." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "A <b>moment</b> <b>ago.</b> I was {{descending}} the steps. The lanthorn {{was close}} to the prisoner; I saw two forms--that looked unfamiliar to me--close to him." ...|$|E
40|$|Most street vending {{is illegal}} in Istanbul, but {{nonetheless}} frequent. Many vendors have ingeniously designed their displays {{in a way}} that they can be moved at a moment's notice. Here vendors, who only <b>moments</b> <b>ago</b> were selling their wares, scramble to exit the scene, having mistaken the photographer for a policeman...|$|R
50|$|The theory {{presented}} {{in the book is}} now called the omphalos hypothesis: that the world and everything in it could have been created at any time, even mere <b>moments</b> <b>ago,</b> with even our own memories being false indications of its age. This is a largely philosophical position, not a scientific one.|$|R
6000|$|Grant quickly {{recovered}} himself. [...] "I am afraid," [...] he said, coming forward, [...] "unless Miss Harcourt does, that I am a mere trespasser in your house, Senora. I saw her pass in your carriage a few <b>moments</b> <b>ago,</b> {{and having}} a message for her I ventured to follow her here." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now go ahead, Joe. You were {{speaking}} to me a <b>moment</b> <b>ago</b> in conundrums, and you have aroused my curiosity to a most uncomfortable degree." ...|$|E

6000|$|Mr. Hemmingway {{thought this}} very witty, and said so. [...] "But," [...] he added, [...] "when I {{was a little}} nearer a <b>moment</b> <b>ago,</b> you stopped me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He {{came out}} of Master Lillie's a few <b>moments</b> <b>ago,</b> and would have torn down the pole but for the crowd which {{threatened}} him. There he is now, and while you are watching your precious uncle, I'll continue to demand my money from that red-coated lieutenant, if it so pleases me!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, but {{you talk}} of a painful {{difference}} of opinion with your husband, and then, when I ask {{for information on the}} point, you bring out a valise. And only a few <b>moments</b> <b>ago</b> you reproached me for not being serious. I wonder who is the serious person of us two now." ...|$|R
50|$|J: Mookie Wilson is the batter...he has a hit...one out of three...a switch hitter, he'll bat left. <b>Moments</b> <b>ago,</b> the Red Sox {{were one}} strike away. Now they're one out away. Here's the pitch...and a foul strike one...back into the seats and Wilson wasn't taking. Howard Johnson is on deck, we {{mentioned}} earlier {{he stayed in}} the game.|$|R
6000|$|... "He {{was with}} me but a <b>moment</b> <b>ago.</b> When we heard the cries at camp I hastened on to {{discover}} what calamity had befallen us--we became separated." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That hadn't {{prevented}} her--as {{you yourself}} a <b>moment</b> <b>ago</b> said--during the previous time. If {{it had been}} only illness {{it would have made}} no difference with her." ...|$|E

6000|$|Ralph {{leaned over}} his father's pillows and gently {{smoothed}} them; {{he was aware}} their talk had been unduly prolonged. [...] "I shall get just the good I said a few <b>moments</b> <b>ago</b> I wished to put into Isabel's reach--that of having met the requirements of my imagination. But it's scandalous, the way I've taken advantage of you!" ...|$|R
60|$|She {{drew back}} now, her cheeks white {{as those of}} the dead. With a wild terror in her eyes she turned to Charlot, who stood the very picture of anguish and {{impotent}} rage. In the cortege, where but a few <b>moments</b> <b>ago</b> all had been laughter, a sob or two sounded now from some of the women.|$|R
60|$|She {{looked away}} from him and shuddered. This passionate {{absorption}} of all his energies into one channel had made a fiend of the man. Her slowly growing purpose took to itself root and branch, as she knelt {{by the side of the}} young Englishman, who only a few <b>moments</b> <b>ago</b> had seemed the very embodiment of all manly vigour.|$|R
