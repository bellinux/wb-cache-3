500|$|Some {{critics have}} {{negatively}} responded to RuPaul's use of {{humor in the}} album. AllMusic's Thomas Erlewine criticized RuPaul's reliance on camp in the album, writing that it was [...] "tired, predictable, and simply not funny" [...] and a [...] "sad display from an entertainer {{who used to be}} hip, clever, and very funny". Newman questioned the effectiveness of the record's overall message, noting that RuPaul's message in the liner notes about [...] "creating one's own family for the holidays" [...] did not fit with the image of [...] "Ru's Christmas panties around his ankles". While she responded positively to a majority of the songs, Newman viewed [...] "You're A <b>Mean</b> <b>One,</b> Mr. Grinch" [...] as an unsuccessful cover. In an interview with Queerty, drag queen Hedda Lettuce revealed that RuPaul's cover of [...] "Hard Candy Christmas" [...] was her least favorite Christmas song of all time; Lettuce said that the song [...] "akes [...] want to shove a candy cane in [...] eye".|$|E
500|$|Alternatively, his {{covers of}} [...] "I Saw Mommy Kissing Santa Claus" [...] and [...] "Hard Candy Christmas" [...] were noted {{for their use}} of camp. However, RuPaul {{identified}} [...] "Hard Candy Christmas" [...] {{as one of the}} [...] "serious ones" [...] on the album, and said it was only referenced as camp due to [...] "the fact that [...] doing it". When recording the song, Visage was unfamiliar with its source The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas, and sang it according to RuPaul's direction. Carol Hall, who had written the song, had described RuPaul's cover as her favorite version of single, and ranked it above Dolly Parton's interpretation. The album also includes a cover of [...] "You're a <b>Mean</b> <b>One,</b> Mr. Grinch" [...] incorporating elements from funk, and [...] "Christmas Train (Medley)", which serves as [...] "a sassy summary of the season’s favorites atop a white-hot club mix". The final track is a remix of the [...] "Celebrate", which had previously appeared on Foxy Lady (1996). It peaked at number 31 on Billboard Dance Club Songs chart on October 11, 1997 and remained on the chart for a total of seven weeks.|$|E

500|$|Following {{an eclipse}} in {{popularity}} in {{the eighteenth and nineteenth}} century, many modern revival faces in the Garamond style have been developed. It is common to pair these with italics based on those created by his contemporary Robert Granjon, who was well known for his proficiency in this genre. However, although Garamond himself remains considered a major figure in French printing of the sixteenth century, historical research has increasingly placed him in context as one artisan punchcutter among many active at a time of rapid production of new typefaces in sixteenth-century France and research has only slowly developed into which fonts were cut by him and which by contemporaries. Therefore, a [...] "Garamond" [...] revival font in modern use can in practice often be understood to <b>mean</b> <b>one</b> based on the general appearance of early modern French printing, not necessarily specifically Garamond's work. The term [...] "Garalde" [...] is used by the publishing association ATypI to generally refer to designs on the Aldus-French renaissance model. In particular, many 'Garamond' revivals of the early twentieth century are actually {{based on the work of}} a later punch-cutter, Jean Jannon, whose noticeably different work was for some years misattributed to Garamond. Modern Garamond revivals also often add a matching bold and 'lining' numbers at the height of capital letters, neither of which were used in Garamond's time.|$|E
500|$|Of the {{two songs}} from How the Grinch Stole Christmas! {{featured}} in the episode, the first, a voiceover vocal of [...] "You're a <b>Mean</b> <b>One,</b> Mr. Grinch" [...] sung by k.d. lang, based on {{a version of the}} song by artist Aimee Mann, as Sue wreaks havoc on the choir room, confused some reviewers, who thought that it was sung by Lynch herself. Benigno was one of these, though he said it was [...] "thoroughly enjoyable", gave the song a [...] "B+", and approved of the change in lyrics from [...] "Mr. Grinch" [...] to [...] "Sue the Grinch". Harper also approved of the change, and admitted she thought Lynch had sung it until Google set her straight. Futterman called the song a [...] "weirdly fitting moment" [...] that [...] "nevertheless fell a bit short of being fully realized". The second song, [...] "Welcome Christmas", was welcomed by reviewers: Benigno described it as [...] "really, really lovely" [...] and gave it an [...] "A". Harper cheered, and noted that the song [...] "was sung very much like a real glee club, without people getting to showboat individually". Futterman characterized it as a [...] "note-perfect performance", and wrote: [...] "The layered harmonies and simple sentiment—'Christmas will always be, just so long as we have glee!'—tie the episode up with a bow, smoothing out the bumps that came before it." ...|$|E
