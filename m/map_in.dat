5|$|A metal-surfaced {{road from}} US 20 in Rushville to {{north of the}} Niobrara River was {{constructed}} between 1940 and 1948. It was extended south to north of Cravath Lake by 1953.

A narrow road was extended from N-250 to N-2 around 1981–82, but it was not part of N-250 until 1996. The routing has not changed significantly since.|$|E

The extension first appeared on the Official Nevada Highway <b>map</b> <b>in</b> 1935. By 1937, US6 had been extended to California, concurrent with US395 between Bishop and Inyokern.|$|E

5|$|Having, it is believed, {{purchased}} the plates of Molyneux's globes, Jodocus Hondius {{was granted a}} ten-year privilege on 1 April 1597 to make and publish a terrestrial globe. In that year, he produced in Amsterdam a Dutch translation of Hues' Tractatus de Globis. On 31 October 1598, despite a legal challenge by rival globe-maker Jacob van Langeren, Hondius obtained another privilege for ten years. He duly published globes in 1600 and 1601, and his sons Henricus and Jodocus published a pair in 1613. Hondius also published a world <b>map</b> <b>in</b> 1608 on the Mercator projection. Its reliance on the Molyneux globe is shown {{by a number of}} legends, names and outlines which must have been copied directly from it.|$|E
5|$|He had his {{breakout}} {{game for}} the New Zealand club in the round 18 48-0 victory over the Parramatta Eels. Tomkins scored two tries, {{one of which was}} directly from the lock position after a scrum win against the feed. The other of which, also from a scrum play, was down the short side where he broke four tackles in a fantastic individual effort. He also set up a brilliant try for captain Simon Mannering. In the first half, Tomkins recorded nine tackle breaks, a try assist, two line breaks, 84 running metres and two tries. His first half performance truly put him on the <b>map</b> <b>in</b> the National Rugby League after some debate previous to this game over whether he was worth the big money.|$|E

5|$|In England, the {{scientist}} Francis Galton {{heard of this}} work, {{as well as the}} pioneering weather forecasts of Robert Fitzroy. After gathering information from weather stations across the country for the month of October 1861, he plotted the data on a map using his own system of symbols, thereby creating the world's first weather map. He used his map to prove that air circulated clockwise around areas of high pressure; he coined the term 'anticyclone' to describe the phenomenon. He was also instrumental in publishing the first weather <b>map</b> <b>in</b> a newspaper, for which he modified the pantograph (an instrument for copying drawings) to inscribe the map onto printing blocks. The Times began printing weather maps using these methods with data from the Meteorological Office.|$|E
5|$|MS 465 first {{appeared}} as a gravel road on the state <b>map</b> <b>in</b> 1956, connecting US 61 near Vicksburg to MS 1 in Fitler. A year later, {{a section of the}} highway became paved in northwest Warren County, and its southern terminus was realigned to north of Vicksburg by 1958. The terminus continued to shift north to parallel the Yazoo River the next two years, ending near Redwood. The southern half of the route was fully paved by 1964, and the northern by 1984. The route has not changed significantly since. The route was proposed {{to be part of the}} Great River Road, but it was not included in the most recent reiteration of the route.|$|E
5|$|MSHD {{had plans}} to upgrade the US16 {{corridor}} to freeway standards {{in the middle of}} the 20th century. The first planning <b>map</b> <b>in</b> 1947 for what later became the Interstate Highway System showed a highway in the corridor. The General Location of National System of Interstate Highways Including All Additional Routes at Urban Areas Designated in September 1955, or Yellow Book after the cover color, showed generalized plans for the locations of Interstate Highways as designated in 1955. This also included a highway in the US16 corridor. The 1957 approval for the Interstate Highway System replaced much of US16 with a portion of Interstate 94 (I-94). MSHD submitted a recommended numbering plan for the Interstates in 1958 that showed I-96 following the US16 corridor.|$|E

5|$|Missions are tasks {{undertaken}} by a clan. There are {{four types of}} missions: regular, encounter, dispatch, and area. In regular missions, Marche's entire party ventures to a particular location to do battle. Many of these missions are used to advance the story. In encounter missions, Marche's group battles a rival mercenary clan by purchasing a mission or meeting them on the <b>map.</b> <b>In</b> dispatch missions, which do not involve battle, Marche temporarily sends away one member from his party. Area missions are usually a dispatch mission where Marche's clan can liberate certain regions to obtain bonuses and discounts at shops.|$|E
5|$|Pokémon HeartGold and SoulSilver are {{role-playing}} {{video games}} with adventure elements. The basic {{mechanics of the}} games are largely {{the same as their}} predecessors'. As with all Pokémon games for hand-held consoles, gameplay is viewed from a third-person overhead perspective, and consists of three basic screens: a field <b>map,</b> <b>in</b> which the player navigates the main character; a battle screen; and the menu, in which the player configures his party, items, or gameplay settings. The player begins the game with one Pokémon and can capture more using Poké Balls. The player can also use the Pokémon to battle or deceive others, often forming alliances or trends via the Team Rocket networks.|$|E
5|$|SH-412A existed {{prior to}} the {{extension}} of US-412 in Oklahoma.

SH-33C was first shown on the Oklahoma state highway <b>map</b> <b>in</b> 1958. At {{the time of the}} highway's designation, it was a gravel highway; by 1959, however, it had been paved. The first revision of the state highway map to reflect the renumbering of SH-33 to US-412 was the 1989 edition; this was also the first to show SH-33C redesignated as SH-412A.|$|E
