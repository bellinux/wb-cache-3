40|$|Abstract Secure initial {{pairing of}} {{electronic}} gadgets is a challenging problem, especially considering {{lack of any}} common security infrastructure. The main security issue is the threat of so-called Man-in-the-Middle (MiTM) attacks, whereby an attacker inserts itself into the pairing protocol by impersonating one of the legitimate parties. A number of interesting techniques have been proposed, all of which involve the user in the pairing process. However, they are inapplicable to many common scenarios where devices to-be-paired do not possess required interfaces, such as displays, speakers, cameras or microphones. In this paper, we introduce BEDA (Button-Enabled Device Association), a protocol suite for secure pairing devices with <b>minimal</b> <b>user</b> <b>interfaces.</b> The most common and minimal interface available on wide variety of devices is a single button.

40|$|Kurzfassung Innerhalb dieses Beitrags wird die numerische Simulationsmethode der Extended Discrete Element Methode (XDEM) vorgestellt, mit der die Wechselwirkung zwischen Reifen und steinigem Untergrund detailliert beschrieben werden kann. Dabei wird der Reifen als ein Kontinuum betrachtet, das mit der Finiten Element Methode (FEM) abgebildet wird. Der grobkörnige Untergrund, wie beispielsweise Sand oder Kies, wird als granulares Medium betrachtet. Dieses kann sehr vorteilhaft mit der Diskreten Element Methode (DEM) behandelt werden, die eine Betrachtung der individuellen Partikel zulässt. Basierend auf den Gesetzen von Newton werden Position und Orientierung aller Partikel berechnet, wobei Kräfte zwischen den Partikeln und dem Reifen berücksichtigt werden. Kräfte zwischen Partikeln und Reifen treten als Randbedingungen in der FEM Struktur des Reifens auf, und führen damit zur Deformation und somit zu Spannungverteilung in der Reifenstrucktur. Eine Integration in der Zeit bestimmt sowohl den Zustand des Untergrunds als auch die Reaktion des Reifens. Dies wird durch eine {{innovative}} Kopplung zwischen der Discrete Particle Method (DPM) zur Beschreibung des granularen Mediums und dem Finite Element Löser DiffPACK erreicht und deshalb als Extended Discrete Element Methode bezeichnet wird. Beides sind objekt- orientierte Software-Werkzeuge, die über eine Schnittstelle die notwendigen Daten austauschen, so dass der Anwender sein Augenmerk auf die Problemlösung richten kann als sich mit Datenaustausch und Algorithmen zu befassen. Damit wurde ein vielseitiges und flexibles Werkzeug zur Lösung vielfältiger Probleme wie auch die Bewegung eines Reifens im Schnee geschaffen. Das neuartige Konzept ist sowohl auf Windows als auch auf UNIX basierenden Betriebssystemen verfügbar. Abstract The {{objective of}} this contribution is to resolve different length scales in structure analysis by an interface coupling the Discrete Element Method (DEM) with the Finite Element Method (FEM) and therefore, is labelled Extended Discrete Element Methode (XDEM). This approach distinguishes itself from other methods in so far that no overlapping domains between Finite and Discrete Elements exist. Both domains are separated in physical space and numerical simulation domain. The proposed approach is relevant to almost all engineering applications that deal with granular matter such as storage in hoppers, transport on conveyor belts or displacement of granular material as in mixers or excavation of soil. For these applications an engineering device such as mixer blades or cutting tools are in contact with granular matter. Contacts with individual particles generate contact forces that act on both the engineering device and the granular material. The latter experiences a displacement of individual particles whereby the engineering structure responds with deformation and stresses. In order to predict and optimize both the behaviour and motion of granular material and the structures in contact, numerical simulation tools are increasingly employed [1]. Simulations are popular especially because experiments which are often expensive, time- consuming and sometimes even dangerous [2]. The continuous increase in computing power is now enabling researchers to implement numerical methods that do not focus on the granular assembly as an entity, but rather deduce its global characteristics from observing the individual behaviour of each grain. An interaction between granular media and a structure relies on a transfer of forces between them. Granular media consists of an ensemble of particles of which a number of particles may be in contact with a surface e. g. walls as surfaces of solid structures. The contact is resolved similar to inter-particle contacts by a representative overlap. It defines the position of impact {{as well as the}} force acting on the particle at this position. The same force, however, into the opposite direction defines a mechanical load for the structure. In order to determine the effect of forces on the solid structure, it is discretised by finite elements. The impact of the force is transferred to the nodes of the respective surface element and appears as a load for the finite element system. Hence, integrating particle dynamics and the response of the solid structure due to particle impacts advances both new position of particles and corresponding deformation and stress of the solid structure in time. Developing flexible software which is capable of performing simulation in different applications will enable the engineers to focus entirely on their specific problem and hence save them valuable time. This concept is supported by the software tools of the Discrete Particle Method (DPM) and Diffpack. Hence, the solid structure is analysed by the Finite Element Method under load due to the impact of individual particles that changes both in time and space. For this purpose traditional formulations of the Finite Element Method are employed that are available by the commercial multi-physics software package Diffpack. It represents object-oriented hierarchy of classes that provide an excellent interface to introduce external loads from particle impact onto the finite element structure. Diffpack is an object-oriented development environment, which comes as a rich set of C++ classes, for the numerical modelling and solution of arbitrary differential equations. User applications cover a wider range of engineering areas and span from simple educational applications to major product development projects. The behaviour of granular material is represented by the advanced software package of the Discrete Particle Method (DPM), which is based on the Discrete Element Method. It is designed to relieve users from underlying mathematics and software design and allows them to focus on physics and their applications. The software uses object oriented techniques that support objects representing three-dimensional particles of various shapes such as cylinders, discs or tetrahedrons for example, size and material properties. This makes it a highly versatile tool dealing with a large variety of different applications of granular matter arising in the automotive industry, such as road tire interaction. Various force models for the inter- particle and particle-wall contacts are also available. A <b>minimal</b> <b>user</b> <b>interface</b> easily allows extending the software further by adding user-defined impact models or material properties to an already available selection of materials and properties. Thus, the user is relieved of the underlying mathematics or software design, and therefore, is able to direct his focus entirely onto the application.

These users come {{from a wide range}} of backgrounds but have in common an extremely mobileand dynamic workplace.

From this experience, we have formulated our resulting ideas about interface design for fieldworkers into two generalprinciples: <b>Minimal</b> Attention <b>User</b> <b>Interfaces</b> (MAUIs) and context awareness.

40|$|With {{the advent}} of PDAs (Personal Digital Assistants), smart phones, {{and other forms of}} mobile and {{ubiquitous}} computers, our computing resources are increasingly moving off of our desktops and into our everyday lives. However, the software and <b>user</b> <b>interfaces</b> for these devices are generally very similar to that of their desktop counterparts, despite the radically different and dynamic environments that they face. We propose that to better assist their users, such devices should be able to sense, react to, and utilise, the user's current environment or context. That is, they should become context-aware. In this thesis we investigate context-awareness at three levels: <b>user</b> <b>interfaces,</b> applications, and supporting architectures/frameworks. To promote the use of context-awareness, and to aid its deployment in software, we have developed two supporting frameworks. The first is an application-oriented framework called stick-e notes. Based on an electronic version of the common Post-It Note, stick-e notes enable the attachment of any electronic resource (e. g. a text file, movie, Java program, etc.) to any type of context (e. g. location, temperature, time, etc.). The second framework we devised seeks to provide a more universal support for the capture, manipulation, and representation of context information. We call it the Context Information Service (CIS). It fills a similar role in context-aware software development as GUI libraries do in <b>user</b> <b>interface</b> development. Our applications research explored how context-awareness can be exploited in real environments with real users. In particular, we developed a suite of PDA-based context-aware tools for fieldworkers. These were used extensively by a group of ecologists in Africa to record observations of giraffe and rhinos in a remote Kenyan game reserve. These tools also provided the foundations for our HCI work, in which we developed the concept of the <b>Minimal</b> Attention <b>User</b> <b>Interface</b> (MAUI). The aim of the MAUI is to reduce the attention required by the user in operating a device by carefully selecting input/output modes that are harmonious to their tasks and environment. To evaluate our ideas and applications a field study was conducted in which over forty volunteers used our system for data collection activities {{over the course of a}} summer season at the Kenyan game reserve. The PDA-based tools were unanimously preferred to the paper-based alternatives, and the context-aware features were cited as particular reasons for preferring them. In summary, this thesis presents two frameworks to support context-aware software, a set of applications demonstrating how context-awareness can be utilised in the ''real world'', and a set of HCI guidelines and principles that help in creating <b>user</b> <b>interfaces</b> that fit to their context of use...|$|R

40|$|Efficient error {{correction}} of recognition output {{is a major}} barrier in the adoption of speech interfaces. This thesis addresses this problem through a novel correction framework and <b>user</b> <b>interface.</b> The system uses constraints provided by the user to enhance re-recognition, correcting errors with <b>minimal</b> <b>user</b> effort and time. In our web <b>interface,</b> <b>users</b> listen to the recognized utterance, marking incorrect words as they hear them. After they have finished marking errors, they submit the edits back to the speech recognizer where it is merged with previous edits and then converted into a finite state transducer. This FST, modeling the regions of correct and incorrect words in the recognition output, is then composed with the recognizer's language model and the utterance is re-recognized. We explored the use of our {{error correction}} technique in bot...|$|R
40|$|We address current {{research}} concerning patterns dedicated to enable higher reusability during the automated development of GUI systems. <b>User</b> <b>interface</b> patterns are promising artifacts for improvements in this regard. Both general models for abstractions of graphical <b>user</b> <b>interfaces</b> and <b>user</b> <b>interface</b> pattern based {{concepts such as}} potential notations and model-based processes are considered. On that basis, the present limitations and potentials surrounding <b>user</b> <b>interface</b> patterns are to be investigated. We elaborate what theoretical implications emerge from <b>user</b> <b>interface</b> patterns applied for reuse and automation within <b>user</b> <b>interface</b> transformation steps. For this purpose, formal descriptions of <b>user</b> <b>interface</b> patterns are necessary. We analyze {{the capabilities of the}} mature XML-based <b>user</b> <b>interface</b> description languages UIML and UsiXML to express <b>user</b> <b>interface</b> patterns. Additionally, we experimentally investigate and analyze strengths and weaknesses of two general transformation approaches to derive practical implications of <b>user</b> <b>interface</b> patterns. As a result, we develop suggestions on how to apply positive effects of <b>user</b> <b>interface</b> patterns for the development of pattern-based graphical <b>user</b> <b>interfaces...</b>|$|R
