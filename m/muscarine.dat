5|$|<b>Muscarine,</b> {{discovered}} in 1869, was long {{thought to be}} the active hallucinogenic agent in A.muscaria. <b>Muscarine</b> binds with muscarinic acetylcholine receptors leading to the excitation of neurons bearing these receptors. The levels of <b>muscarine</b> in Amanita muscaria are minute when compared with other poisonous fungi such as Inocybe erubescens, the small white Clitocybe species C. dealbata and C. rivulosa. The level of <b>muscarine</b> in A.muscaria is too low {{to play a role in}} the symptoms of poisoning.|$|E
5|$|Inocybe praetervisa is a small, {{yellow and}} brown {{mushroom}} in the Inocybaceae family, distinguished from {{other members of}} the genus by its unusual spores and bulb. The unusual spores led to the species being named the type species of the now-abandoned genus Astrosporina; recent studies have shown that such a genus could not exist, as the species with the defining traits do not form a monophyletic group. However, it is a part of several clades within the genus Inocybe. I.praetervisa grows on the ground in woodland, favouring beech trees, and can be found in Europe, North America and Asia. It is inedible and probably poisonous due to the presence of <b>muscarine.</b> The ingestion of <b>muscarine</b> can lead to SLUDGE syndrome, and could potentially lead to death due to respiratory failure.|$|E
5|$|The flesh has a mild taste, and a strong, pungent, fruity smell. The {{mushroom}} is poisonous, containing <b>muscarine</b> compounds. Consumption of {{the mushroom}} {{could lead to}} a number of physiological effects, including: salivation, lacrimation, urination, defecation, gastrointestinal problems and emesis (vomiting); this array of symptoms is also known by the acronym SLUDGE. Other potential effects include a drop in blood pressure, sweating and death due to respiratory failure.|$|E
5|$|In general, blue-staining red-pored boletes {{should be}} avoided for consumption. Thiers warned this species may be toxic after being alerted to severe {{gastrointestinal}} symptoms in one who had merely tasted it. Years later, in 1994, a couple developed gastrointestinal symptoms after eating this fungus and the husband died as a result. A subsequent autopsy revealed {{that the man had}} suffered an infarction of the midgut. Rubroboletus pulcherrimus was the only bolete that had been implicated in the death of someone consuming it, It is known to contain low levels of <b>muscarine,</b> a peripheral nervous system toxin. until 2005. A report from Australia records a fatality from muscarinic syndrome after consuming a mushroom from the genus Rubinoboletus.|$|E
5|$|Inocybe maculata, {{commonly}} known as the frosty fibrecap, is a species of mushroom in the Inocybaceae family. First described by Jean Louis Émile Boudier in 1885, I. maculata can be found throughout Europe, Asia and North America. It is a medium-sized brown mushroom with a fibrous, brown cap with white remnants of a universal veil in the middle. The stem is cream or brown. The species is ectomycorrhizal and grows at the base of various trees, including beech. Inocybe maculata is poisonous, containing <b>muscarine.</b> Possible symptoms after consumption of I.maculata mushrooms are salivation, lacrimation, urination, defecation, gastrointestinal problems and vomiting, with the possibility of death due to respiratory failure.|$|E
5|$|This {{species is}} a {{mycorrhizal}} fungus, {{widespread in the}} Americas and Europe. It can grow either singly, scattered, or in groups. It prefers habitats like coniferous and mixed forests and alongside paths, where it fruits in summer and fall. It is a toxic mushroom that has <b>muscarine,</b> the same toxin as Amanita muscaria and Amanita pantherina {{as well as many}} species in the Clitocybe and Inocybe genera. It is often confused with various other European species. A.gemmata resembles the false death cap, tawny grisette and panther cap mushrooms. Its cap is brighter in color than the former, and more yellow than the latter two.|$|E
5|$|The major toxins {{involved}} in A.muscaria poisoning are muscimol (3-hydroxy-5-aminomethyl-1-isoxazole, an unsaturated cyclic hydroxamic acid) {{and the related}} amino acid ibotenic acid. Muscimol {{is the product of}} the decarboxylation (usually by drying) of ibotenic acid. Muscimol and ibotenic acid were discovered in the mid-20th century. Researchers in England, Japan, and Switzerland showed that the effects produced were due mainly to ibotenic acid and muscimol, not <b>muscarine.</b> These toxins are not distributed uniformly in the mushroom. Most are detected in the cap of the fruit, a moderate amount in the base, with the smallest amount in the stalk. Quite rapidly, between 20 and 90 minutes after ingestion, a substantial fraction of ibotenic acid is excreted unmetabolised in the urine of the consumer. Almost no muscimol is excreted when pure ibotenic acid is eaten, but muscimol is detectable in the urine after eating A.muscaria, which contains both ibotenic acid and muscimol.|$|E
5|$|There is no antidote, and {{supportive}} care is {{the mainstay of}} further treatment for intoxication. Though {{sometimes referred to as}} a deliriant and while <b>muscarine</b> was first isolated from A. muscaria and as such is its namesake, muscimol does not have action, either as an agonist or antagonist, at the muscarinic acetylcholine receptor site, and therefore atropine or physostigmine as an antidote is not recommended. If a patient is delirious or agitated, this can usually be treated by reassurance and, if necessary, physical restraints. A benzodiazepine such as diazepam or lorazepam can be used to control combativeness, agitation, muscular overactivity, and seizures. Only small doses should be used, as they may worsen the respiratory depressant effects of muscimol. Recurrent vomiting is rare, but if present may lead to fluid and electrolyte imbalances; intravenous rehydration or electrolyte replacement may be required. Serious cases may develop loss of consciousness or coma, and may need intubation and artificial ventilation. Hemodialysis can remove the toxins, although this intervention is generally considered unnecessary. With modern medical treatment the prognosis is typically good following supportive treatment.|$|E
5|$|Psilocybin {{is present}} in varying {{concentrations}} in over 200 species of Basidiomycota mushrooms which evolved to produce the compound from <b>muscarine</b> some 20 million years ago. In a 2000 review on the worldwide distribution of hallucinogenic mushrooms, Gastón Guzmán and colleagues considered these to be distributed amongst the following genera: Psilocybe (116species), Gymnopilus (14), Panaeolus (13), Copelandia (12), Hypholoma (6), Pluteus (6), Inocybe (6), Conocybe (4), Panaeolina (4), Gerronema (2) and Agrocybe, Galerina and Mycena (1species each). Guzmán increased his estimate {{of the number of}} psilocybin-containing Psilocybe to 144 species in a 2005 review. The majority of these are found in Mexico (53 species), with the remainder distributed in the US and Canada (22), Europe (16), Asia (15), Africa (4), and Australia and associated islands (19). In general, psilocybin-containing species are dark-spored, gilled mushrooms that grow in meadows and woods of the subtropics and tropics, usually in soils rich in humus and plant debris. Psilocybin mushrooms occur on all continents, but the majority of species are found in subtropical humid forests. Psilocybe species commonly found in the tropics include P.cubensis and P.subcubensis. P.semilanceata — considered by Guzmán to be the world's most widely distributed psilocybin mushroom — is found in Europe, North America, Asia, South America, Australia and New Zealand, but is entirely absent from Mexico. Although {{the presence or absence of}} psilocybin is not of much use as a chemotaxonomical marker at the familial level or higher, it is used to classify taxa of lower taxonomic groups.|$|E
25|$|<b>Muscarine</b> {{has been}} {{isolated}} from fruiting bodies, but the quantities {{are believed to}} be far too small to account for its toxic effects. More recently, the enzyme bolesatine has been isolated from this mushroom Bolesatine is a protein synthesis inhibitor, and, when given to mice, causes massive thrombosis.|$|E
25|$|A {{link between}} {{what we now know}} as the {{sympathetic}} system and the lung was shown in 1887 when Grossman showed that stimulation of cardiac accelerator nerves reversed <b>muscarine</b> induced airway constriction. In elegant experiments in the dog, where the sympathetic chain was cut {{at the level of the}} diaphragm, Jackson showed that there was no direct sympathetic innervation to the lung, but that bronchoconstriction was reversed by release of epinephrine from the adrenal medulla. An increased incidence of asthma has not been reported for adrenalectomized patients; those with a predisposition to asthma will have some protection from airway hyper-reactivity from their corticosteroid replacement therapy. Exercise induces progressive airway dilation in normal subjects that correlates with work load and is not prevented by beta blockade. The progressive dilation of the airway with increasing exercise is mediated by a progressive reduction in resting vagal tone. Beta blockade with propranolol causes a rebound in airway resistance after exercise in normal subjects over the same time course as the bronchoconstriction seen with exercise induced asthma. The reduction in airway resistance during exercise reduces the work of breathing.|$|E
500|$|Inocybe cookei {{has been}} {{described}} as both poisonous (due to the presence of <b>muscarine</b> compounds) and non-toxic. Consumption of mushrooms containing <b>muscarine</b> compounds could lead to a number of physiological effects, including: excess salivation, lacrimation, uncontrolled urination or defecation, gastrointestinal problems and emesis (vomiting); this array of symptoms may also be known by the acronym SLUDGE. Other potential effects include a drop in blood pressure, sweating and death due to respiratory failure. The flesh of the mushroom has a mild taste and a slight smell of honey. Regardless of its actual toxicity or edibility, it is considered [...] "best avoided".|$|E
500|$|Psilocybin ( [...] ) is a {{naturally}} occurring psychedelic prodrug compound produced {{by more than}} 200 species of mushrooms, collectively known as psilocybin mushrooms. Psilocybin evolved in mushrooms from its ancestor, <b>muscarine,</b> some 20 million years ago.|$|E
500|$|The {{species has}} a mild, indistinct taste, and a faint smell of flour. Mycologist Roger Phillips {{describes}} its edibility as [...] "suspect", recommending {{that it be}} avoided, and notes {{that it is possible}} that the species is poisonous; most species of Inocybe have been shown to contain poisonous chemicals. Mycologist Ian Robert Hall lists the mushroom as containing the poisonous compound <b>muscarine.</b> Consumption of <b>muscarine</b> could lead to a number of physiological effects, including: excess salivation, lacrimation, uncontrollable urination and defecation, gastrointestinal problems and emesis (vomiting); this array of symptoms is also known by the acronym SLUDGE.

500|$|Inocybe godeyi flesh has {{a strong}} smell, which has been {{variously}} described as [...] "unpleasant", [...] "earthy or mealy", and [...] "not distinctive". The flesh has an acrid taste. The mushrooms {{are known to be}} poisonous, containing toxic compounds of <b>muscarine.</b> Consumption of the mushroom could lead to a number of physiological effects, including: salivation, lacrimation, urination, defecation, gastrointestinal problems and emesis (vomiting); this array of symptoms is also known by the acronym SLUDGE.

500|$|Inocybe godeyi is {{a species}} of Inocybaceae fungus found in Europe. The species {{produces}} mushrooms with cone-shaped caps up to [...] in diameter. The caps are cream, becoming browner, but they bruise red. The stem is up to [...] long, and has a [...] "bulb" [...] at the base. The white flesh has a strong smell and an [...] taste. The mushrooms {{can be found on}} forest floors in autumn months; the species forms an ectomycorrhizal relationship to surrounding trees, favouring beech. I.godeyi is known to be poisonous, containing <b>muscarine</b> compounds, and consumption of the mushrooms can lead to SLUDGE syndrome. The species is sometimes mistaken for the deadly I.erubescens.|$|E
500|$|Mild tasting, Suillellus luridus is edible after {{thorough}} {{cooking and}} is highly regarded in France. It is also commonly consumed in Italy and China. The mushroom {{is sold in}} regional markets in central Mexico; despite this, it is considered inedible by inhabitants of La Malinche National Park. Caution is advised if choosing this species for consumption, as it resembles other less edible blue-staining boletes. Some guidebooks recommend avoiding it altogether. If eaten raw or insufficiently cooked, symptoms of gastrointestinal poisoning can occur within 30 minutes to two hours, including [...] nausea, vomiting, abdominal [...] cramps, [...] and diarrhoea. A full recovery can be expected within 24 to 48 hours if fluid losses are restored. Chemical analysis has revealed traces of the toxin <b>muscarine</b> and its stereoisomers.|$|E
2500|$|Like {{many other}} biologically active substances, {{acetylcholine}} exerts its effects by binding to and activating receptors {{located on the}} surface of cells. There are two main classes of acetylcholine receptor, nicotinic and muscarinic. [...] They are named for chemicals that can selectively activate each type of receptor without activating the other: [...] <b>muscarine</b> is a compound found in the mushroom Amanita muscaria; nicotine is found in tobacco.|$|E
2500|$|Inocybe lacera has mild-tasting {{flesh and}} a mild, mealy smell. The North American variety I.lacera var. heterosperma has a [...] smell. However, species of Inocybe {{should always be}} avoided when {{choosing}} mushrooms for consumption, {{as many of the}} members of the genus are dangerously toxic. I. lacera is known to be poisonous, containing quantities of the toxic compound <b>muscarine.</b> Consumption of the mushroom typically leads to salivation, lacrimation, urination, defecation, gastrointestinal problems and emesis (vomiting), which has given rise to the acronym SLUDGE. Other potential effects include a drop in blood pressure, sweating and death due respiratory failure.|$|E
2500|$|Inocybe lacera (commonly {{known as}} the torn fibrecap) is a {{poisonous}} species of mushroom in the genus Inocybe. Its appearance {{is that of a}} typical [...] "little brown mushroom": small, brown and indistinct. However, it is distinguishable by its microscopic features, particularly its long, smooth spores. As with many other species of Inocybe, I.lacera contains the poisonous chemical <b>muscarine</b> which, if consumed, can lead to salivation, lacrimation, urination, defecation, gastrointestinal problems and emesis. Found in Europe and North America, it typically grows in autumn in mixed woods, favouring sandy soil. There are several documented subspecies in addition to the main I.lacera var lacera, including the dwarf form I.lacera var. subsquarrosa and I.lacera var. heterosperma, found in North America.|$|E
2500|$|Plants are a {{major source}} of complex and highly {{structurally}} diverse chemical compounds (phytochemicals), this structural diversity attributed in part to the natural selection of organisms producing [...] compounds to deter herbivory (feeding deterrents). Major classes of phytochemical include phenols, polyphenols, tannins, terpenes, and alkaloids. [...] Though the number of plants that have been extensively studied is relatively small, many pharmacologically active natural products have already been identified. [...] Clinically useful examples include the anticancer agents paclitaxel and omacetaxine mepesuccinate (from Taxus brevifolia and Cephalotaxus harringtonii, respectively), the antimalarial agent artemisinin (from Artemisia annua), and the acetylcholinesterase inhibitor galantamine (from Galanthus spp.), used to treat Alzheimer's disease. Other plant-derived drugs, used medicinally and/or recreationally include morphine, cocaine, quinine, tubocurarine, <b>muscarine,</b> and nicotine.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the early}} 1890s, the German {{pharmacologist}} Carl Jacobj (1857–1944) {{in the laboratory}} of Oswald Schmiedeberg [...] in Strasbourg studied {{the relationship between the}} adrenals and the intestine.

The experiment has been called [...] "the first indirect demonstration {{of the role of the}} adrenal medulla as an endocrine organ [...] actually a more sophisticated demonstration of the adrenal medullary function than the classic study of Oliver and Schäfer". [...] While this may be true, Jacobj did not envisage a chemical signal secreted into the blood to influence distant organs, in other words a hormone, but nerves running from the adrenals to the gut, [...] "Hemmungsbahnen für die Darmbewegung".|$|E
50|$|<b>Muscarine,</b> L-(+)-muscarine, or muscarin is {{a natural}} product found in certain mushrooms, {{particularly}} in Inocybe and Clitocybe species, such as the deadly C. dealbata. Mushrooms in the genera Entoloma and Mycena have also been found to contain levels of <b>muscarine</b> which can be dangerous if ingested. <b>Muscarine</b> {{has been found in}} harmless trace amounts in Boletus, Hygrocybe, Lactarius and Russula. <b>Muscarine</b> is only a trace compound in the fly agaric Amanita muscaria; the pharmacologically more relevant compound from this mushroom is muscimol. A. muscaria fruitbodies contain a variable dose of <b>muscarine,</b> usually around 0.0003% fresh weight. This is very low and toxicity symptoms occur very rarely. Inocybe and Clitocybe contain <b>muscarine</b> concentrations up to 1.6%.|$|E
50|$|A {{paucity of}} {{research}} {{exists on the}} metabolism of <b>muscarine</b> in the human body, suggesting this compound is not metabolized by humans. Though there has been extensive {{research in the field}} of acetylcholine metabolism by acetylcholinesterase, <b>muscarine</b> is not metabolized by this enzyme, partly explaining the compound's potential toxicity. <b>Muscarine</b> is readily soluble in water. The most likely way for <b>muscarine</b> to leave the blood is via renal clearance; it will eventually leave the body in urine.|$|E
50|$|<b>Muscarine,</b> {{discovered}} in 1869, was long {{thought to be}} the active hallucinogenic agent in A. muscaria. <b>Muscarine</b> binds with muscarinic acetylcholine receptors leading to the excitation of neurons bearing these receptors.

The level of <b>muscarine</b> in A. muscaria is too low {{to play a role in}} the symptoms of poisoning.|$|E
50|$|Many small Clitocybe species {{contain the}} toxin <b>muscarine,</b> which was {{originally}} found {{in small amounts}} in the famous fly agaric. However, the small white Clitocybe species contain <b>muscarine</b> in dangerous amounts, and two species in particular, the closely related Clitocybe dealbata and Clitocybe rivolusa, contain <b>muscarine</b> in deadly amounts, and deaths have been recorded for eating those two Clitocybe species.|$|E
50|$|As <b>muscarine</b> {{works on}} the muscarinic {{acetylcholine}} receptor the best comparison {{can be made with}} acetylcholine, which normally works on this receptor. Pure <b>muscarine</b> compared to pure acetylcholine is stated in most cases to be more potent, its action is always slower but longer lasting than acetylcholine. A possible explanation for this long lasting behavior might be that <b>muscarine</b> does not get hydrolyzed by acetylcholinesterase in the synaptic cleft.|$|E
5000|$|Muscarine: <b>Muscarine</b> {{stimulates the}} muscarinic receptors of the nerves and muscles. Symptoms include sweating, salivation, tears, blurred vision, palpitations, and, in high doses, {{respiratory}} failure. <b>Muscarine</b> {{is found in}} mushrooms of the genus Omphalotus, notably the Jack o' Lantern mushrooms. It {{is also found in}} A. muscaria, although it is now known that the main effect of this mushroom is caused by ibotenic acid. <b>Muscarine</b> can also be found in some Inocybe species and Clitocybe species, in particular Clitocybe dealbata, and some red-pored Boletes.|$|E
50|$|In the Dorothy L. Sayers's novel The Documents in the Case, {{a murder}} is {{committed}} {{that is designed}} to appear as accidental death from eating poisonous mushrooms containing <b>muscarine.</b> The case is proved to be murder because the <b>muscarine</b> found in the deceased's stomach is racemic and therefore synthetic.|$|E
50|$|<b>Muscarine</b> {{poisoning}} {{is characterized}} by miosis, blurred vision, increased salivation, excessive sweating, lacrimation, bronchial secretions, bronchoconstriction, bradycardia, abdominal cramping, increased gastric acid secretion, diarrhea and polyuria. If <b>muscarine</b> reaches the brain it can cause tremor, convulsions and hypothermia.Cardiac ventricles contain muscarinic receptors that mediate {{a decrease in the}} force of contractions leading to a lower blood pressure. If <b>muscarine</b> is administered intravenously, <b>muscarine</b> can trigger acute circulatory failure with cardiac arrest.The symptoms of intoxication with mushrooms rich in <b>muscarine,</b> especially Inocybe, are very typical:The symptoms start early, after one-quarter to two hours, with headache, nausea, vomiting, and constriction of the pharynx. Then salivation, lacrimation, and diffuse perspiration set in, combined with miosis, disturbed accommodation, and reduced vision. Gastric and small bowel colic leads to diarrhea, and there is a painful urge for urination. Bronchoconstriction leads to asthmatic attacks and severe dyspnea, and bradycardia combined with marked hypotension and vasodilation results in circulatory shock. Death after 8 to 9 hours has been reported in about 5% of the cases, but can be avoided completely by prompt diagnosis and treatment with atropine.|$|E

50|$|<b>Muscarine</b> {{mimics the}} {{function}} of the natural neurotransmitter acetylcholine in the muscarinic part of the cholinergic nervous system, despite the less flexible structure due to the five-membered ring in the molecular skeleton.

50|$|<b>Muscarine</b> {{was first}} {{isolated}} from Amanita muscaria by German chemists Oswald Schmiedeberg and Richard Koppe, who reported their findings in 1869. It {{was the first}} parasympathomimetic substance ever studied and causes profound activation of the peripheral parasympathetic nervous system that may end in circulatory collapse and death. Being a quaternary ammonium salt, <b>muscarine</b> is less completely absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract than tertiary amines, {{and it does not}} cross the blood-brain barrier.Muscarinic agonists activate muscarinic receptors while nicotinic agonists activate nicotine receptors. Both are direct-acting cholinomimetics; they produce their effects by binding to and activating cholinergic receptors.Final proof of the structure was given by Franz Jellinek and colleagues in 1957 with the help of X-ray diffraction analysis; Jellinek further described the three-dimensional structure of the molecule using <b>muscarine</b> chloride. These new findings set into motion research not only on the pharmacology of <b>muscarine,</b> but also on that of muscarine-like substances that are structurally related to acetylcholine.|$|E
