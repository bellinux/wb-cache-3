40|$|DE 102007027428 A 1 UPAB: 20090103 NOVELTY - The {{component}} (100) has an oscillation element (1) and suspensions (2 a, 2 b) {{by which}} the oscillation element is suspended in a direction in an oscillating manner and another suspension (6) {{by which the}} oscillation element is suspended in another direction in an oscillating manner. A drive device placed the oscillation element in an oscillation in the latter direction based on a thermal deformation, a <b>magnetorestriction</b> or a piezoelectric deformation. USE - Component for use in two-dimensional deflecting micro mirrors and two-dimensional scanner mirrors. ADVANTAGE - The drive device placed the oscillation element in an oscillation in the latter direction based on a thermal deformation, a <b>magnetorestriction,</b> or a piezoelectric deformation, and hence ensures an improved image resolution and reduced electronic expenditure for correlation between position and source of light modulation...|$|E
40|$|In this work, a {{study of}} the stress relief in Finemet ribbons, Fe 73. 5 Cu 1 Nb 3 Si 16. 5 B 6, as a {{function}} of the annealing temperature is presented. The as melt-spun samples are amorphous and become partially crystallized after annealing at appropriate temperatures. For temperatures TA≥ 480 °C the samples are nanocrystalline, with a microstructure composed by α-Fe 12 xSix(x~ 0. 2) crystallites (10 nm average diameter) embedded in an amorphous matrix. Nanocrystallization, associated with stress relief effects, improves the soft magnetic properties of this kind of material. The stress level was quantified using <b>magnetorestriction</b> (measured by SAMR), magnetoelastic anisotropy, and domain wall energy data obtained from impedance spectra measurements. A reduction of the internal stress from 15 to 0. 2 MPa was verified when comparing the as-cast to the sample annealed at 580 °C. Improvement of the magnetic softness of the samples was also followed by the increase of the domain wall and magnetization rotation contributions to the overall effective permeability...|$|E
