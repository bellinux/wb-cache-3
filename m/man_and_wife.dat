5|$|In 1827, Mary Shelley was {{party to}} a scheme that enabled her friend Isabel Robinson and Isabel's lover, Mary Diana Dods, who wrote {{under the name}} David Lyndsay, {{to embark on a}} life {{together}} in France as <b>man</b> <b>and</b> <b>wife.</b> With the help of Payne, whom she kept in the dark about the details, Mary Shelley obtained false passports for the couple. In 1828, she fell ill with smallpox while visiting them in Paris. Weeks later she recovered, unscarred but without her youthful beauty.|$|E
5|$|The {{story of}} Ila, a king cursed by Shiva and Parvati to {{be a man}} one month and a woman the next, appears in several {{traditional}} Hindu texts. After changing sex, Ila loses the memory of being the other gender. During one such period, Ila marries Budha (the god of the planet Mercury). Although Budha knows of Ila's alternating gender, he doesn't enlighten the 'male' Ila, who remains unaware of his life as a woman. The two live together as <b>man</b> <b>and</b> <b>wife</b> only when Ila is female. In the Ramayana version, Ila bears Budha a son, although in the Mahabharata Ila is called both mother and father of the child. After this birth the curse is lifted and Ila is totally changed into a man who goes on to father several children with his wife.|$|E
5|$|After {{the guests}} take their seats, Scott starts {{to worry that}} Charlene will not show up, but Paul and Mike assure him {{that she will be}} there. Reverend Sampson (Howard Bell) then invites {{everyone}} to stand as Charlene and Henry begin their walk up the aisle. Scott and Charlene exchange vows and Reverend Sampson pronounces them <b>man</b> <b>and</b> <b>wife.</b> At the reception, Jim tells Scott that he is proud of him and welcomes Charlene to the family. Harold Bishop (Ian Smith) finds Madge crying in the kitchen and he comforts her. They are interrupted by Mrs. Mangel (Vivean Gray) who informs them that the telegrams from Max and Maria, Clive and Rosemary, who all are unable to attend, are being read out. Dan Ramsay (Syd Conabere) spots a mouse and tries to pick it up, but hits Mrs. Mangel's foot. She accuses Dan of groping her and as he protests his innocence, an argument breaks out among the guests. Scott and Charlene go to his bedroom and Gail brings them a gift from her father. Jane comes to tell Charlene {{that it is time to}} get changed for the honeymoon, while Paul takes their bags out to the car. Lucy tells Scott that she will miss him and he gives her his skateboard.

25|$|The {{wild man}} {{was used as}} a symbol of mining in late medieval and Renaissance Germany. It appears in this context in the coats of arms of Naila and of Wildemann.

25|$|The rioting largely {{died down}} after a heavy {{thunderstorm}} struck {{the area around}} midnight, and gunfire ended around 1 AM. Joyce Arnett, a 26-year-old African American mother of three, {{was shot in the}} head by an unidentified gunman when she leaned out a window. African American man Alton Burks was shot in the hip and African American man Wallace Kelly was shot in the jaw by unidentified gunmen as well. A white <b>man</b> <b>and</b> <b>wife,</b> the Nopwaskis, were hit by rocks while riding a public bus and also suffered minor injuries. Another five civilians were shot (but only lightly injured), and three were injured by rocks or bottles, while 12 policemen were injured (although only slightly). Ten buildings were destroyed by fire, and 53 African Americans—most of them teenagers—were arrested.|$|E
25|$|The English Catholic exiles {{eventually}} {{split into}} two parties, the one, called the Spanish faction, supporting {{the claims of the}} Infanta of Spain to the English crown, while the other, denominated the Scottish faction, advocated the right of James VI of Scotland. Paget was the acknowledged head of the Scottish faction, and in 1599 he threw up his employment under the King of Spain, and returned to Paris. Among the State Papers is a letter from a Catholic in Brussels to his friend, a monk at Liege, giving a detailed account of Paget and his 'practices'. The writer says that from the first hour that his years permitted him to converse with men, he has been tampering in broils and practices, betwixt friend and friend, <b>man</b> <b>and</b> <b>wife,</b> and, as his credit and craft increase, betwixt prince and prince.|$|E

On the floor is the brass of a <b>man</b> <b>and</b> his <b>wife,</b> of about 1470.

500|$|Despite her family's {{disapproval of}} their relationship, Fanny {{began to write}} passionate letters to Kent, [...] "filled with {{repeated}} entreaties {{to spend the rest}} of their lives together". [...] He eventually allowed her to join him at lodgings in East Greenwich near London. [...] The two decided to live together as <b>man</b> <b>and</b> <b>wife,</b> making wills in each other's favour and hoping to remain discreet. [...] In this, however, they did not reckon on Fanny's relations. [...] The couple moved to lodgings near the Mansion House, but their landlord there may have learnt of their relationship from Fanny's family, expressing his contempt by refusing to repay a sum of money Kent loaned him (about £20). [...] In response, Kent had him arrested.|$|E
500|$|In London, Anne {{adopted a}} {{cosmopolitan}} lifestyle, while James preferred {{to escape the}} capital, most often at his hunting lodge in Royston. Anne's chaplain, Godfrey Goodman, later summed up the royal relationship: [...] "The King himself was a very chaste man, and there was little in the Queen to make him yet they did love as well as <b>man</b> <b>and</b> <b>wife</b> could do, not conversing together." [...] Anne moved into Greenwich Palace and then Somerset House, which she renamed Denmark House. After 1607, she and James rarely lived together, by which time she had borne seven children and suffered at least three miscarriages. After narrowly surviving the birth and death of her last baby, Sophia, in 1607, Anne's decision to have no more children may have widened the gulf between her and James.|$|E
60|$|Everything seemed {{divided into}} classes, {{carefully}} docketed and valued. For instance, a Briton was of more value than a <b>man,</b> <b>and</b> <b>wives</b> than women. Those things or phases {{of life with}} which people had no personal acquaintance were regarded with a faint amusement and a certain disapproval. The principles of the upper class, in fact, were strictly followed.|$|R

500|$|Immediately {{after her}} arrival in Edmonton, she said, Brownlee had telephoned her—commenting that [...] "a little birdie" [...] {{had told him}} that she was in town—and invited her to his home to meet his family; she soon became a regular visitor there. [...] She alleged that in October 1930, while Brownlee was driving her home after one such visit, the premier took her hand and asked her what she knew [...] "about life". [...] On her {{response}} that she knew probably as much as any girl of eighteen, he invited her out the next evening for what she presumed would be some advice. [...] Instead, he drove her [...] west of town on Highway 16 and parked on a side road before asking her to have sex with him. [...] He said that he had been madly in love with her from the start, that he was lonely, {{that he and his wife}} had not lived together as <b>man</b> <b>and</b> <b>wife</b> in a long time, that his wife (an invalid) would be endangered by a pregnancy, and that he could not be premier any longer unless MacMillan agreed to have sex with him. [...] He told her that if she refused him, he would be forced to resume his sexual relationship with his wife, and that this would likely kill her. [...] MacMillan reacted fearfully, and asked if there was anything else she could do to help Brownlee and his wife; he replied that there was not.|$|E
500|$|Wiesenthal wrote {{a number}} of books, some of which contain {{conflicting}} stories and tales, {{many of which were}} invented. Several authors, including Segev and British author Guy Walters, feel that Wiesenthal's autobiographies are not reliable sources of information about his life and activities. For example, Wiesenthal would describe two people fighting over one of the lists he had prepared of survivors of the Holocaust; the two look up and recognise each other and have a tearful reunion. In one account it is a <b>man</b> <b>and</b> <b>wife,</b> and in another telling it is two brothers. Wiesenthal's memoirs variously claim he had spent time in as many as eleven concentration camps; the actual number was five. A drawing he made in 1945 that he claimed was a scene he witnessed in Mauthausen had actually been sketched from photos that appeared in Life magazine that June. He particularly over-emphasised his role in the capture of Eichmann, claiming that he prevented Veronika Eichmann from having her husband declared dead in 1947, when in fact the declaration was denied [...] "at the instigation of the authorities." [...] Wiesenthal said that he had retained his Eichmann file when he sent his research materials to Yad Vashem in 1952; in fact he sent all his materials there, and it was his counterpart, Tuviah Friedman in Vienna, who had retained materials on Eichmann. Isser Harel, director of the Mossad at the time, has stated that Wiesenthal had no role in the capture of Eichmann.|$|E
