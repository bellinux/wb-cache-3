500|$|September 5, 1942: In {{the morning}} {{attended}} a special {{action from the}} women's concentration camp (Muslims); the most dreadful of horrors. Master-Sergeant Thilo (troop doctor) was right when he said to <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> the anus mundi. In the evening towards 8:00 attended another special action from Holland [...] Because of the special rations they get a fifth of a liter of schnapps, 5 cigarettes, 100 g salami and bread, the men all clamor {{to take part in}} such actions. Today and tomorrow (Sunday) work.|$|E
500|$|In April 2010, after {{eighteen}} months of negotiations, {{the deal was}} reportedly suspended; reports cited French concerns about Pakistan's financial situation, the protection of sensitive French technology, and lobbying by the Indian government, which operates many French-built aircraft. France wanted the PAF to purchase several Mirage 2000-9 fighters from the United Arab Emirates Air Force, which would overlap with the upgraded JF-17. In July 2010, the PAF's Chief of Air Staff, Air Chief Marshal Rao Qamar Suleman, said these reports were false. He said, [...] "I have had discussions with French Government officials who have assured <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> not the position of their government". Suleman also speculated that [...] "someone was trying to cause mischiefto put pressure on France not to supply the avionics we want".|$|E
500|$|The {{so-called}} [...] "cyber-kidnapping" [...] {{portrayed in}} [...] "Weeping Willow" [...] {{is believed to}} be the first such crime ever portrayed on television. While the writers and producers prepared the episode, several district attorneys they consulted said the law was dangerously vague regarding what charges could be filed in the event of such a real-life cyber-kidnapping; Wright said, [...] "They told <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> a real problem, that there's a lag between what's on the books now and what's happening out there." [...] The script also includes a difficulty on the part of the detectives in coping and dealing this new form of cyber-crime and differentiating the truth from the hoax; Leight said, [...] "Their biggest frustration is trying to understand what's real and what isn't. Does this woman, Willow, really exist, and has something happened to her? Is she playing a character and a game that's gotten out of hand? And how do you locate someone in cyberspace?" ...|$|E
60|$|My own {{observation}} {{of human nature}} told <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> wisely said. I led the way at once to the cell.|$|R
5000|$|AC [...] "No, {{not in the}} slightest, {{it never}} entered my head. You tell <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> happening, I didn't hear about it or know about it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Of course, yes. The jolly old hotel. I'm {{coming to}} that. Well, it <b>was</b> like <b>this.</b> A chappie {{on the boat}} told <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> {{the best place to}} stop at in New York--" ...|$|R
500|$|In 1993, Pascu {{experienced}} {{his first}} significant success in music with the album Mixed Grill {{and the single}} [...] "Ţara arde şi babele se piaptănă" [...] ("The Country Is Burning and Old Women Are Combing Their Hair", referencing a Romanian proverb). A poll conducted by the journal Evenimentul Zilei nominated the track as the best song of 1993, and the nationwide station Radio Contact awarded Pascu its [...] "Composer of the Year" [...] title. Mixed Grill marked Pascu's brief experimentation with a fusion of rock and reggae. [...] Hits such as [...] "Gizzi" [...] and [...] "Mi-am luat colac" [...] ("I Got Me a Lifebuoy") led some to consider {{him one of the}} pioneers of Romanian reggae, years ahead of acts like El Negro and Pacha Man. The mix of genres became characteristic of Pascu's work in music: [...] "When I was writing records, I figured that, should someone, say, be playing my record at a party, they would have several kinds to choose from, and they would not grow bored. But it's not because of that, I think that's how inspiration visits <b>me,</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> how I write. I won't stick to any one musical genre." [...] In addition to the piano, guitar and drums, Pascu also began playing the harmonica.|$|E
2500|$|... "It {{seems to}} <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> {{a case where}} I would be failing in my duty if I didn't report action to the {{relevant}} authority that would prevent future fatalities," ...|$|E
6000|$|... 21. *Rubus longithyrsiger (Lees). [...] "Mr. Baker informs <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> a [...] very {{distinct}} plant never {{yet found}} on the continent." [...] (J. D. H.) ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Do you {{remember}} what poor papa once let drop--that Cytherea {{was the name of}} his first sweetheart in Bloomsbury, who so mysteriously renounced him? A sort of intuition tells <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> the same woman.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Is it so?' {{she said}} softly, 'yet {{in my dream}} it seemed to <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> their last {{strength}} ere they sink into death unending. Look yonder!' and she pointed toward the snowy crest of the volcan Xaca.|$|R
6000|$|... "I've been so frightened," [...] she sobbed. [...] "They got me in here--they told <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> {{the street}} in which my aunt lived--and they wouldn't let me go. The woman <b>was</b> horrible. And <b>this</b> {{afternoon}} this man came. The brute!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Are {{you trying}} to tell <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> a final overthrow?" [...] said Yeovil in a shaking voice; [...] "are we to remain a subject race like the Poles?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'He {{has gone}} without his hat,' he murmured. 'It seems to <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> {{practically}} {{a case of}} running amok. And now {{to break the news}} to bereaved Comrade Gregory.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And do {{you mean}} to tell <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> the man who is trying to sell me this stock in the Sunset Milling Company?" [...] asked Mr. Fordham, when Dave had finished.|$|E
60|$|A {{quick glance}} showed <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> the only {{door to the}} small {{apartment}} in which we had found sanctuary, and, {{with a sigh of}} relief, I leaned for a moment against the panels of the stout barrier that separated us from the ramping demons without.|$|R
60|$|I champed my egg for a bit. I {{was most}} awfully moved, don't you know, {{by the way}} Jeeves had rallied round. Something seemed to tell <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> an {{occasion}} <b>that</b> called for rich rewards. For a moment I hesitated. Then I made up my mind.|$|R
60|$|This sounded all right. Goodness knows I am no snob, and can rough it when required, but I do like comfort when {{it comes}} my way, {{and it seemed to}} <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> where I got it. And I liked the boy. He was the right sort.|$|R
6000|$|... "It strikes <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> {{a mighty}} poor welcome for {{one who has}} just {{come all the way}} from South America," [...] said the little black and white bird with {{twinkling}} eyes.|$|E
6000|$|... "What!" [...] exclaimed Mrs. Fox, when {{from the}} other side of the lawn she saw him alight. [...] "Another young man with a valise! It seems to <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> an overdose!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Spare you? Yes, {{when you}} have told <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> some nightmare, some phantasm--a lie! Spare you! Yes, when {{you tell me that}} this presumptuous upstart has gone back to his upstart country." ...|$|E
60|$|Here {{the person}} {{sitting next to}} me, {{speaking}} low, informed <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> Jimmy Jacob, the sweep, that he owned a pet jackdaw, known to every one in the village, and {{supposed to be the}} cleverest bird that ever was. He added that Jimmy could be very amusing about his bird.|$|R
60|$|Goza told <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> {{because the}} King's Slayers made a custom of {{dragging}} the victim along the projecting tongue {{to the edge}} of this rock and hurling him, either dead or living, to the ground beneath; or, in the case of witches; driving them over after they had been blinded.|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{immediately}} {{occurred to}} <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> {{a good opportunity}} to escape. I was proud of my great size, and realized that now I could safely travel anywhere in the world, while my superior culture would make me a fit associate for the most learned person I might chance to meet.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Kate, my dear,' said Mrs Nickleby, {{taking her}} {{daughter}} aside, {{as soon as}} they got upstairs, 'you don't really mean to tell <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> actually true about Miss La Creevy and Mr Linkinwater?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Wait," [...] and Dane's voice stopped him. [...] "Now, I don't fancy {{that would}} do. It seems to <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> {{a case in}} which a woman to look after him would be necessary." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Look!" [...] she exclaimed. [...] "Look at that! In my own country, yes, {{but here}} I do not understand. They tell <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> the richest {{city in the}} world, and the most charitable." ...|$|E
60|$|Experience {{has since}} taught <b>me</b> <b>that</b> these great beasts are as terror-stricken by this {{phenomenon}} as a landsman by a fog at sea, {{and that no}} sooner does a fog envelop them than they {{make the best of}} their way to lower levels and a clear atmosphere. It <b>was</b> well for <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> true.|$|R
50|$|Zahn, a Catholic and a pacifist, {{first heard}} of Jägerstätter in 1956, while doing {{research}} for an earlier book, German Catholics and Hitler's Wars. He was impressed and inspired by Jägerstätter’s story {{and felt that}} it deserved a wider audience: “it was enough to convince <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> indeed an amazing story, one deserving the widest possible attention".|$|R
5000|$|... “It seemed {{abundantly clear}} to <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> how the culture needed to evolve — rock, jazz, pop and world music all fusing {{together}} to form one truly universal language. No Walls was the embodiment of everything I had dreamed of since I first got turned on to music. We were the Freedom Principle in action!” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, Owen," [...] said one, [...] "what {{brings you}} here {{on such a}} night as this? You told <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> one of Vasquez' {{favorite}} haunts! And you are a believer. Aren't you afraid to be out?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But {{you have}} never before left home in such {{peculiar}} circumstances," [...] said Nigel. [...] "Have you not told <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> {{the first time for}} about two hundred years that Krakatoa has broken out in active eruption?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Can you assure me, on your honor, of {{one other}} thing," [...] she asked, {{lowering}} her voice on her side. [...] "Can you honestly tell <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> {{not the first}} of other fits that are to come?" ...|$|E
6000|$|It was a disappointment, but it couldn't be helped, and it cost us a sigh or two. We talked pleasantly along, and he {{was always}} reading our {{thoughts}} and responding to them, and it seemed to <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> the most wonderful of all the things he did, but he interrupted my musings and said: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] she replied, [...] "but {{you are not}} to eat {{much and}} you must only drink water. The priestesses in Kendah Land told <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> {{necessary}} before taking Taduki in its strongest form, as {{we are going to}} do to-night. You know the prophet Harût only gave us the merest whiff in this room years ago." ...|$|R
60|$|She {{rushed into}} his arms like someone {{charging}} in for a bowl of soup at a railway station buffet. And I drifted out. It seemed to <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> {{a scene in which}} I was not on. I sidled to the door, and slid forth. They didn't notice me. My experience is that nobody ever does--much.|$|R
