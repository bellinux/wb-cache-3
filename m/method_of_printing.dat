25|$|At {{the dawn}} of the Industrial Revolution, the {{mechanics}} of the hand-operated Gutenberg-style press were still essentially unchanged, although new materials in its construction, amongst other innovations, had gradually improved its printing efficiency. By 1800, Lord Stanhope had built a press completely from cast iron which reduced the force required by 90%, while doubling the size of the printed area.

25|$|Movable-type {{was invented}} in the Northern Song dynasty around the year 1041 by the {{commoner}} Bi Sheng. Bi Sheng's movable-type was fired in porcelain.

However Shen Kuo did not invent the movable-type but credited it to Bi Sheng in his Dream Pool Essays. The ceramic movable-type was also mentioned by Kublai Khan's councilor Yao Shu, who convinced his pupil Yang Gu to print language primers using this method.|$|E
25|$|After {{finishing}} lower {{high school}} in Tábor, the boy was particularly interested in chemigraphy (a <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>printing</b> photographs). In 1891 (at the age of 14) he started {{to work as a}} trainee in the polygraphic factory of Jan Vilím in Prague. After two years, in 1893, he changed jobs to work as a photographer in the studio of František Krátký in Kolín. Krátký's studio specialized in stereoscopy and publishing photographs as educational tools, allowing Josef Jindřich to further develop his interests in photographic printing. His certificate of a completed apprenticeship, written in 1906 by his father Ignác Šechtl, also certifies his studies in the Šechtl & Voseček studios in the period 1892–1895, apparently in parallel with his jobs in Prague and Kolín. At 22, after serving in the army (1898–1899), he started work in the affiliated Šechtl & Voseček studio in Černovice u Tábora, a town near Tábor. At this time his father Ignác was travelling with his cinematograph (motion pictures), and the Tábor studio was run by Ignác's partner Jan Voseček.|$|E

50|$|The {{earliest}} decorated biscuit tin {{was commissioned}} in 1868 by Huntley & Palmers from the London firm of De La Rue to a design by Owen Jones. Early <b>methods</b> <b>of</b> <b>printing</b> included the transfer process (essentially {{the method used}} to decorate porcelain and pottery since about 1750) and the direct lithographic process, which involved laying an inked stone directly on to a sheet of tin. Its disadvantage was that correct colour registration was difficult. The breakthrough in decorative tin plate production was {{the invention of the}} offset lithographic process. It consists of bringing a sheet of rubber into contact with the decorated stone, and then setting-off the impression so obtained upon the metal surface. The advantages over previous <b>methods</b> <b>of</b> <b>printing</b> were that any number of colours could be used, correctly positioned, and applied to an uneven surface if necessary. Thus the elaborately embossed, colourful designs that were such a feature of the late Victorian biscuit tin industry became technically possible.|$|R

2500|$|Artists, designers, {{engravers}} {{and administrative}} officials {{are involved with}} the choice of subject matter and the <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>printing</b> stamps. Early stamp images were almost always produced from engravings — a design etched into a steel die, which was then hardened and whose impression was transferred to a printing plate. Using an engraved image was deemed a more secure way of printing stamps as it was nearly impossible to counterfeit a finely detailed image with raised lines unless you were a master engraver. In the mid-20th century, stamp issues produced by other forms of printing began to emerge, such as [...] lithography, photogravure, intaglio and web offset printing. These later printing methods were less expensive and typically produced images of lesser quality.|$|E
2500|$|Block {{books are}} short books, 50 or fewer leaves, that were {{printed in the}} second half of the 15th century from wood blocks in which the text and {{illustrations}} were both cut.

[...] Some books also were made with the illustrations printed from woodcuts, but the text printed from movable metal type, but are nevertheless considered block books because of their <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>printing</b> (only on one side of a sheet of paper) and their close relation to [...] "pure" [...] block books. [...] Block books are categorized as incunabula, or books printed before 1501. [...] The only example of the blockbook form that contains no images is the school textbook Latin grammar of Donatus.|$|E

2500|$|Critical work in {{the second}} half of the twentieth century, however, has often {{challenged}} the assumption that An Island originated in Blake's rejection of a specific social circle. Foremost amongst such work is that of David V. Erdman, who suggests instead that the main background to the An Island is Blake's belief in his own imminent financial success. In early 1784, Blake opened a print shop at No. 27 Broad Street with James Parker, alongside whom he had served as an apprentice to the engraver James Basire during the 1770s. At the time, engraving was becoming an extremely lucrative trade, accruing both wealth and respectability for many of its practitioners, and Erdman believes that the increasing prosperity for engravers in the early 1780s represents the most important background to An Island, arguing that the confidence which Blake and Parker must have felt informs the content more so than any sense of social rejection; [...] "the kind of envy that breeds satire is that of the artist and artisan who is anticipating the taste of success and is especially perceptive of the element of opportunism." [...] Erdman also sees as important the fact that the character based on Blake, Quid the Cynic, partially outlines a new <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>printing,</b> not unlike Blake's own, as yet unrealised, illuminated printing. Quid argues that he will use this new <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>printing</b> to outdo the best known and most successful of artists and writers, such as Joshua Reynolds, William Woollett, Homer, John Milton and William Shakespeare. Behind this claim, argues Erdman, [...] "lies the vision of a man [...] who begins to see a way to replace the division of labour with the harmony of One Man, to renew and join together the arts of poetry and painting without going outside his own shop and his own head." [...] As such, it is Erdman's contention that the primary background factor for An Island is the sense of anticipation and exuberance on the part of Blake, expectation for his new business venture and excitement regarding his new method of printing; An Island was thus borne from anticipation.|$|E

The thickness of the layer of ink is tested {{from time to time}} by taking a print of a finger, and comparing its clearness and blackness with that of a standard print, hung up for the purpose close at hand. If too much ink has been put on the slab, some of it must be cleaned off, and the slab rolled afresh with what remains on it and on the roller. But this fault should seldom be committed; little ink should be put on at first, and more added little by little, until the required result is attained.|$|E
