50|$|Like the wings, {{the hull}} {{was made of}} wood. The bottom had a single, small step and was {{relatively}} flat-bottomed and without a sharp central V-form cross-section, rather having gentle double curvature flattening towards the chines. Above the chines the hull sides were flat and vertical, with the wing mounted on top. On each side an unstepped <b>metal</b> <b>float</b> was mounted from two pairs of parallel struts at the outer end of the wing centre-section to stabilise the aircraft on water. There was a large, open position in the nose for an observer/bombardier, provided {{with a pair of}} machine guns on a flexible mount, who could also take bearings and provide signals. The LeO H-23 had an enclosed cockpit just ahead of the wing leading edge with two side-by-side seats and dual controls. The remaining crew position was a dorsal cockpit in the rear fuselage, well behind the wing and where the top of the hull had curved decking. This post was equipped, like the one in the nose, with twin machine guns and also housed radio equipment and a camera. The crew communicated with each other through speaking tubes. At the rear the fin was large and almost rectangular, as was the rudder. Its tailplane was mounted about halfway up the fin, braced from below with a pair of divergent struts on each side. The horizontal tail had high aspect ratio and both tailplane and elevator had rectangular plans.|$|E

The investigation of the acoustic field profile across the plate thickness revealed the presence of modes having longitudinal polarization, the Anisimkin Jr. plate modes (AMs), travelling at a phase velocity close {{to that of the}} wz-BN longitudinal bulk acoustic wave propagating in the same direction. The study of the S 0 mode phase velocity and coupling coefficient (K 2) dispersion curves, for different electrical boundary conditions, has shown that eight different coupling configurations are allowable that exhibit a K 2 as high as about 4 % and very high phase velocity (up to about 16, 700 m/s). The effect of the thickness and material type of the <b>metal</b> <b>floating</b> electrode on the K 2 dispersion curves has also been investigated, specifically addressing the design of an enhanced coupling device. The gravimetric sensitivity of the BN/AlN-based acoustic waveguides was then calculated for both the AMs and elliptically polarized S 0 modes; the AM-based sensor velocity and attenuation shifts due to the viscosity of a surrounding liquid was theoretically predicted.
