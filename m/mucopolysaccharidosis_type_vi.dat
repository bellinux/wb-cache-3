40|$|The Maroteaux-Lamy {{syndrome}} (<b>mucopolysaccharidosis</b> <b>type</b> VI; MPS <b>VI)</b> is a lysosomal {{storage disease}} caused by deficiency of the enzyme arylsulphatase B (ASB).

Human MPS VI fibroblasts infected with recombinant retrovirus integrated the provirus into their genome and expressed retrovirus-encoded ASB mRNAs. In infected fibroblasts the level of ASB was up to 36 -fold higher than in normal fibroblasts.

40|$|BACKGROUND: We {{previously}} {{demonstrated the}} benefits of daily, oral pentosan polysulfate (PPS) treatment in a rat model of <b>mucopolysaccharidosis</b> (MPS) <b>type</b> <b>VI.</b> Herein we compare these effects to once weekly, subcutaneous (s. c.) injection. The bioavailability of injected PPS is greater than oral, suggesting better delivery to difficult tissues such as bone and cartilage. Injected PPS also effectively treats osteoarthritis in animals, and has shown success in osteoarthritis patients. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: One-month-old MPS VI rats were given once weekly s. c. injections of PPS (1, 2 and 4 mg/kg, human equivalent dose (HED)), or daily oral PPS (4 mg/kg HED) for 6 months. Serum inflammatory markers and total glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) were measured, as were several histological, morphological and functional endpoints. Overall, weekly s. c. PPS injections led to similar or greater therapeutic effects as daily oral administration. Common findings between the two treatment approaches included reduced serum inflammatory markers, improved dentition and skull lengths, reduced tracheal deformities, and improved mobility. Enhanced effects of s. c. treatment included GAG reduction in urine and tissues, greater endurance on a rotarod, and better improvements in articular cartilage and bone in some dose groups. Optimal therapeutic effects were observed at 2 mg/kg, s. c [...] No drug-related increases in liver enzymes, coagulation factor abnormalities or other adverse effects were identified following 6 months of s. c. PPS administration. CONCLUSIONS: Once weekly s. c. administration of PPS in MPS VI rats led to equal or better therapeutic effects than daily oral administration, including a surprising reduction in urine and tissue GAGs. No adverse effects from s. c. PPS administration were observed over the 6 -month study period...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{lysosomal}} storage {{disorders are}} {{a group of}} inherited metabolic diseases each characterised by a relative or absolute deficiency {{of one or more}} of the lysosomal proteins involved in the hydrolysis of glycoconjugates or in the transport of the resulting product. Enzyme replacement therapies are under consideration for a number of these disorders and are based on the in vitro observation that cells from affected patients can be corrected by addition of exogenous enzyme. In this study, two glycosylation variants of the lysosomal enzyme N-acetylgalactosamine- 4 -sulphatase (4 S) (the deficiency of which causes <b>Mucopolysaccharidosis</b> (MPS) <b>type</b> <b>VI,</b> (Maroteaux–Lamy syndrome) were made by expression of 4 S cDNA in both wild type chinese hamster ovary (CHO-K 1), and Lec 1 (N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase I deficient CHO-K 1) cells. Differences in the glycosylation pattern of the two enzyme forms were demonstrated with endoglycosidase H and N-glycosidase F digestions. The receptor mediated binding of these two forms of 4 S to two cell types, human skin fibroblasts and rat alveolar macrophages, was then analysed. We have shown that both enzyme forms bind to the mannose- 6 -phosphate receptor on human skin fibroblasts with equal affinity demonstrating that the degree of phosphorylation of mannose residues in the two forms is similar. However, using rat alveolar macrophages, we found that the binding/uptake of the two enzymes differs considerably. These results show that differences in glycosylation of lysosomal enzymes can be an important factor in altering enzyme uptake by different cell types. Thus, producing carbohydrate modification variants in this way may be useful for altering the distribution of exogenous enzyme in vivo...|$|R

METHODS. A retroviral construct containing a rat j 3 -glucuronidase cDNA (NTK-BGEO) was used to infect RPE cells at subconfluence. The transduced cells were selected in G 418, an antibiotic toxic to normal mammalian cells. j 3 -Glucuronidase activity was measured in transduced cells and media, using a fluorogenic substrate. Glycosaminoglycan profiles were examined by metabolically labeling RPE with Na 2 35 SO 4. RESULTS. Transduced RPE cells, regardless of species or disease status, expressed rat j 3 -glucuronidase. The expressed enzyme restored normal levels of glycosaminoglycans in the RPE cells of homozygous MPS Vll-affected dogs by metabolizing stored glycosaminoglycans. The expressed enzyme failed to metabolize stored glycosaminoglycans of MPS I and MPS VI, indicating that overexpression could not bypass the exoglycosidase restriction.

40|$|We {{previously}} {{demonstrated the}} therapeutic benefits of pentosan polysulfate (PPS) in a rat model of <b>mucopolysaccharidosis</b> (MPS) <b>type</b> <b>VI.</b> Reduction of inflammation, reduction of glycosaminoglycan (GAG) storage, and {{improvement in the}} skeletal phenotype were shown. Herein, we evaluate the long-term safety and therapeutic effects of PPS in a large animal model of a different MPS type, MPS I dogs. We focused on the arterial phenotype since {{this is one of}} the most consistent and clinically significant features of the model. MPS I dogs were treated with daily oral or biweekly subcutaneous (subQ) PPS at a human equivalent dose of 1. 6 mg/kg for 17 and 12 months, respectively. Safety parameters were assessed at 6 months and at the end of the study. Following treatment, cytokine and GAG levels were determined in fluids and tissues. Assessments of the aorta and carotid arteries also were performed. No drug-related increases in liver enzymes, coagulation factors, or other adverse effects were observed. Significantly reduced IL- 8 and TNF-alpha were found in urine and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). GAG reduction was observed in urine and tissues. Increases in the luminal openings and reduction of the intimal media thickening occurred in the carotids and aortas of PPS-treated animals, along with a reduction of storage vacuoles. These results were correlated with a reduction of GAG storage, reduction of clusterin 1 staining, and improved elastin integrity. No significant changes in the spines of the treated animals were observed. PPS treatment led to reductions of pro-inflammatory cytokines and GAG storage in urine and tissues of MPS I dogs, which were most evident after subQ administration. SubQ administration also led to significant cytokine reductions in the CSF. Both treatment groups exhibited markedly reduced carotid and aortic inflammation, increased vessel integrity, and improved histopathology. We conclude that PPS may be a safe and useful therapy for MPS I, either as an adjunct or as a stand-alone treatment that reduces inflammation and GAG storage...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: <b>Mucopolysaccharidosis</b> <b>type</b> I is an {{autosomal}} recessive disorder caused by deficiency of α-L-iduronidase and {{characterized by a}} progressive course with multisystem involvement. Clinically, <b>Mucopolysaccharidosis</b> <b>type</b> I is classified into two forms: severe (Hurler syndrome), which presents in infancy and is characterized by rapid progressive neurological involvement and attenuated (Hurler/Scheie and Scheie syndromes), which presents with slower progression and absent to mild nervous system involvement. The specific treatment for attenuated <b>Mucopolysaccharidosis</b> <b>type</b> I consists of enzyme-replacement therapy with laronidase (human recombinant α-L-iduronidase, Aldurazyme). We present here the clinical and laboratory results in an 12 -year-old patient affected by the attenuated form of <b>Mucopolysaccharidosis</b> <b>type</b> I treated by enzyme-replacement therapy {{from the age of}} 5 months, compared with his 17 year old affected sister, who started therapy at 5 years of age. CASE PRESENTATION: Clinical evaluation of these siblings shows that initiation of therapy prior of the onset of clinically detectable disease resulted in considerable improvement in outcome in the young sibling. After 12 years of enzyme-replacement therapy, facial appearance, linear growth rate, and liver and spleen volumes were normal; moreover, the degree of joint disease, vertebral, and cardiac valvular involvement were only minimal compared with those of his sister.

40|$|SummaryThe chondron {{represents}} the chondrocyte and its pericellular microenvironment and {{plays an important}} role in the progression of osteoarthritis. <b>Type</b> <b>VI</b> collagen is preferentially localized in the pericellular microenvironment of adult articular cartilage and increases during osteoarthritis. In this study, we characterized the pericellular sequestration of <b>type</b> <b>VI</b> collagen in long-term chondrocyte-agarose cultures, and assessed the action of interleukin- 1 on <b>type</b> <b>VI</b> collagen deposition and assembly. Immunohistochemical and biochemical analysis showed that cultured chondrocytes initiate <b>type</b> <b>VI</b> collagen sequestration immediately upon plating and continue pericellular matrix sequestration in a time dependent manner. Confocal microscopy confirmed the cell surface localization and pericellular accumulation of <b>type</b> <b>VI</b> collagen, while image analysis identified a ‘cargo-net like’ organization of <b>type</b> <b>VI</b> collagen around each chondrocyte. Quantitative analysis revealed a primary phase of rapid cell division and low levels of <b>type</b> <b>VI</b> collagen sequestration, followed by a secondary phase of relative growth stability and high levels of <b>type</b> <b>VI</b> collagen deposition. Interleukin- 1 treated cultures showed increased sequestration and retention of <b>type</b> <b>VI</b> collagen in an expanded microenvironment surrounding the chondrocytes. The data suggests a role for <b>type</b> <b>VI</b> collagen in the differentiation of the pericellular microenvironment in vitro.
