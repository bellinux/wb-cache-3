The group has addressed several aspects of the immunity of, especially, industrial equipment against voltage dips. Compared to the work earlier groups, the equipment performance is not seen as a final aim, but as a step towards the ultimate aim: allowing the process to ride through the voltage dip. Some of the contributions and conclusions from the WG C 4. 110 are discussed in this paper, <b>Check</b> <b>Mark</b> Description of voltage dips, <b>Check</b> <b>Mark</b> Equipment and process immunity, <b>Check</b> <b>Mark</b> Testing and characterization, <b>Check</b> <b>Mark</b> Economics, <b>Check</b> <b>Mark</b> Immunity classes and application, <b>Check</b> <b>Mark</b> Further work. © 2010 Chinese Soc for Elec Eng. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

Tones 4 and 6, for example, are said to make tenuis plosives breathy voiced (浊送气), suggesting they may be breathy/murmured like the Hmong g-tone.

2500|$|During {{the first}} four {{audition}} rounds (episodes 1-4), only the jury could decide who would continue to the semi-finals. [...] At any time during a performance, {{each member of the}} jury could push on one of two buttons: a green <b>check</b> <b>mark</b> of approval or a red X for disapproval. [...] When a member of the jury pressed one of the buttons, a loud sound effect let the contestant know that a member of the jury had made a decision and what the decision was. [...] If a contestant received three red X's before the end of their performance, that contestant was eliminated and their performance was abruptly stopped. Sometimes, however, an eliminated contestant could convince the jury to allow them to complete their performance. To continue to the semi-finals, a contestant needed to gain at least two green <b>check</b> <b>marks</b> from the jury. If more than 6 contestants were given 2 or more green <b>check</b> <b>marks</b> in a single program, the jury would decide {{at the end of the}} program which 6 contestants would continue to the semi-finals.

50|$|There are {{two ways}} that Speechranks {{measures}} student participation: Points and Green <b>Check</b> <b>Marks.</b> Points are awarded to competitors based on the student’s percentile finish in each event. Students achieving the same percentile finish in any event and any tournament will be awarded {{the same number of}} Points. A student’s three best finishes in a particular event are used to sum their total Points for that event. Overall ranking on Speechranks is determined {{by the total number of}} Points a competitor has accumulated. Green <b>Check</b> <b>Marks</b> recognize consistent excellence throughout the competitive season. There is no limit to the number of Green <b>Check</b> <b>Marks</b> a student may earn. In general, Green <b>Check</b> <b>Marks</b> are awarded to any competitor who achieves a winning record in debate or finishes in the top 40% of an individual event (IE). Green <b>Check</b> <b>Marks</b> are unique to each event and students may not transfer checkmarks from one event to another. Speechranks requirements were drafted by Isaiah McPeak, with development chaired by Dr. Van Schalin and programmed by Connor McKay.
