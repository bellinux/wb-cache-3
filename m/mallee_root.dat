A. aurita was {{formerly}} found in the Woomelang and Ouyen areas of north-western Victoria. Due to human land use, it is now mostly found in 400 ha of Wathe State Wildlife Reserve, north-western Victoria. It has also been found in Cobbler Creek Recreation Park in South Australia and Mambray Creek Reserve.

50|$|The biogeographical {{constraints}} of their terrain lacking surface water, determined {{much of their}} lifestyle. Neighbouring tribes such as the Warki, Jarildekald, and Portaulun had access to swamps, marshes, lake water, and stretches of river where they could hunt and trap animals, fish and ducks, and such resourcess enabled a more settled tribal existence. The Ngarkat, conversely, were an ever-shifting nomadic people, lacking even a fixed nomenclature for the mallee groves where they pitch camp and draw water from the <b>mallee</b> <b>roots,</b> day after day. The few stable points of return, which allowed a seasonal living base, were named and the lore of the ancestral beings of each clan developed only in such places.|$|R

40|$|Sustainability {{responds}} to crises of ecology {{and human development}} and the relationships between them. Sustainability cannot be adequately described using disciplinary categories arising from the modern dichotomy between nature and culture. Sustainability research requires a methodology that reflects the reality of its subject. This thesis presents material semiotics as a methodology for sustainability research. Material semiotics refers {{to the work of}} actor-network theorists and latter developments of alternate spatial metaphors for material relationality. Actor-network theory is a methodology that describes human and non-human actors in the same terms. It follows actor through networks of material relationships that they constitute and are constituted by, depicting heterogeneous objects without recourse to prior categories of nature or culture. The description of material relationships in fluid and regional, as well as network, spaces expands the descriptive power of material semiotics to include Others and to better represent complexity. The Oil Mallee Project is a case study of sustainability in the Western Australian wheatbelt. Indigenous eucalypts, oil mallees, are planted on land that was cleared for agriculture. The above ground biomass can be processed for eucalyptus oil, electricity and activated carbon, and the rights to carbon stored in the extensive <b>mallee</b> <b>roots,</b> or in unharvested trees, can be sold. The Project {{responds to}} a number of sustainability issues, including ozone depletion, land degradation, climate change and rural decline. This thesis follows the actors that comprise the Oil Mallee Project to describe its complexity, multiplicity and sustainability. Qualitative interviews with actors in the Project and the wheatbelt provided the primary data, which is supported by documentary material. Three contingent phases can be identified {{in the history of the}} Oil Mallee Project - eucalyptus oil industry, dryland salinity management, and greenhouse response. The Project has persisted because it is simultaneously a regional, network and fluid object. Mallees grow well in the tough conditions of the wheatbelt. Mallees can be integrated with existing networks of industrial agriculture. The Project has achieved contingent stability in policy documents and the networks of scientific research. The fluidity of the Project has enabled it to change shape and identity in response to threats and opportunities, and as relationships break and form, without complete disruption. Specific humans have been central heroes in different phases of the Project. The mallees themselves are the only actors that have been consistently central to the identity of the Project. Sustainability requires knowledge of the relationships between humans and non-humans that constitute the multiple crises of ecology and human development. Sustainability is the re-ordering of those relationships in ways that make possible ecological integrity and human fulfilment. Material semiotics is a methodology for knowing sustainability in ways that reveal the possibilities for such re-orderings...|$|R
40|$|In the Australian Continent, {{in those}} areas {{occupied}} by Eurpoeans during the past 200 years, the natural environment has been modified; the change are most severe in the semi-arid regions. Prior to Eurpoean settlement, for some tens of thouthands years of Aboriginal occupation, there were slow changes mainly due to occasional burning of vegetation so that the Australian flora was gradually moved towards fire-resisted species. With the introduction of agricuture and grazing drastic changes in the density, floristics, and structure of native vegetation occurred. Disturbance or removal of vegetation has also affected surface and sub-surface hydrology. These changes have resulted in water or wind erosion and salinization. Where vegetation has been regenerated the species established are often those which are unpalatable to grazing stock or can withstand frequent burning. This leads to "desertification". The concept of "desertification" is ecologically defined as follows: The natural vegetation in equilibrium with the potentiality of regional climate (climatic climax) is replaced by the vegetation which grows naturally and originally in more arid region due to environmental stress directly induced by man and the accompanying land degradation. The Murray-Mallee Region {{in the southern part}} of Austrralia, where the late Pleistocene and Holocene sand dunes are widely distributed, is a semi-arid region with annual rainfall of 250 - 400 mm; it is wholly covered with mallee (Eucalyptus spp.) scrub. The sand dunes which were stable covered totally with such vegetation during the pre-European days have become unstable at many sites due to vegetation clearing, farming and grazing associated with European settlement since the late 19 th Century. The remobilization of sand dunes is one of the typical events of "desertification" and, in extreme cases, the surface remains unvegetated. Various stages in vegetation change can be observed showing "desertification" or regeneration process. The authors describe the processes involved in land and vegetation degradation, and discuss the measures to prevent "desertification" based on the examination of the relationships between activity of sand drifting, thickness of loose sand overlying the stable substrata, floristic composition, community height, and activlty of rabbits (Olyctolagus cuniculus). The natural mallee scrub in the conservation park is dominated by Eucalyptus spp. accompanled by rlch lower shrub layer species such as Casuarina stricta, Callitris verrucosa and Hakea leucoptera. The mallee scrub remaining on farmland, however, is very poor in understory resulting from grazing. Triodia spp. and Acacia spp. invade in the understory of the mallee scrub after bushfires. Acacia spp. regenerate easily and are dominant on the land where the surface is disturbed by vegetation clearance and/or wind erosion. Natural mallee scrub will regenerate through sprouting from so-called <b>mallee</b> <b>roots</b> (lignotuber) persisting after surface disturbance. When the lignotuber is exposed by wind erosion or covered by sand accumulation, the recovery to natural mallee scrub becomes very difficut. On such sites, Triodia colonies and/or Acacia scrub stand as disclimax communities with a life cycle of 30 to 50 years (Figs. 6 and 7). The thicker the loose sand is, the more active and continuous is the sand drifting (Fig. 8). In particular, on many dunes with loose sand thicker than 80 cm, serious drifting has continued for recent tens of years exacerbated by the large amount of mobile sands and the difficulty of vegetation invasion. At the sites with thick loose sands, the population of rabbit introduced from Europe is larger, suggesting that the reactivation and acceleration of sand drifting is induced by rabbit infestation (Fig. 9). On the other hand, where vegetation height is greater than the line shown in Fig. 8, suggesting a minimum height of vegetation for erosion control, sand dunes tend to be stabilized. The results of investigation as mentioned above show the various processes of vegetation changes according to the combinations of local difference in natural conditions and the importance of human impacts, and imply many stages of"desertification". The remobilization of sand dunes is regarded as an extreme stage of "desertification" caused by a combination of many factors. The soil conservation and the vegetation management based on detailed survey of physical and ecological characteristics of land will identify the factors contributing to landscape instability and "desertification" and so provide a framework for reversing the processes of land and vegetation degradation...|$|R
