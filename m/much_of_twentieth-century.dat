40|$|For <b>much</b> <b>of</b> the <b>twentieth-century,</b> {{aluminium}} producers {{enjoyed a}} close relationship with national governments, not least as prominent players in military-industrial complexes (for example, Anderson 1951; Smith 1988; Grinberg and Hachez-Leroy 1997). This paper explores the ideological motivations and political activities of senior figures within Britain’s dominant native aluminium producer for <b>much</b> <b>of</b> the <b>twentieth-century,</b> the British Aluminium Company Ltd. (BACo), drawing on work by the author (Perchard 2007, 2010). As a company self-styled as ‘the Service’, support within BACo for imperial priorities and patrician values was sustained both by commercial imperatives as well as the social and cultural background of many of the directors (until the 1960 s), amongst them hereditary landowners, retired senior military officers and latterly senior civil servants. This paper will examine the political activities of directors collectively and individually through their engagement with power elites (Mills 1956). In particular, it will focus upon the areas of imperial defence, and regional development in the Scottish Highlands (where BACo’s main smelters were based), to illustrate how their involvement in political activities and social networks was both self-serving and governed by instinctive values. In so doing it will also comment upon the ‘revolving door’ between public and private spheres. While calling into question the general application of the notion of a ‘gentlemanly capitalist’ order, this paper accords with Larry Butler’s view of imperial mining concerns and the British metropolitan government’s priorities during decolonization that: ‘it may, rather, be more accurate to speak of temporary convergences of interest’ (Butler 2007 : 477; Cain and Hopkins 1987) ...|$|R
40|$|August Weismann {{is famous}} for having argued against the {{inheritance}} of acquired characters. However, an analysis of his work indicates that Weismann always held that changes in external conditions, acting during development, were the necessary causes of variation in the hereditary material. For <b>much</b> <b>of</b> his career he held that acquired germ-plasm variation was inherited. An irony, which is in tension with <b>much</b> <b>of</b> the standard <b>twentieth-century</b> history <b>of</b> biology, thus exists – Weismann was not a Weismannian. I distinguish three claims regarding the germ-plasm: (1) its continuity, (2) its morphological sequestration, and (3) its variational sequestration. With respect to changes in Weismann’s views on the cause of variation, I divide his career into four stages. For each stage I analyze his beliefs on {{the relative importance of}} changes in external conditions and sexual reproduction as causes of variation in the hereditary material. Weismann believed, and Weismannism denies, that variation, heredity, and development were deeply intertwined processes.

40|$|Criticisms of {{analytic}} philosophy {{have increased}} in intensity in the last decade, denouncing specifically its closing in on itself, which results in barrenness and ignorance of real human problems. The thought of C. S. Peirce is proposed as a fruitful way of renewing the analytic tradition and obviating these criticisms. While this paper is largely a reflection on Hilary Putnam’s study of {{the historical development of}} analytic philosophy, not only can some of its main roots be traced back to Peirce, but also the recent resurgence of pragmatism can be regarded as a pragmatist renovation of the analytic tradition. Further, Peirce’s thought offers suggestions for tackling some of the most stubborn problems in contemporary philosophy, thereby enabling us to shoulder once more the philosophical responsibility which has been abdicated by <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>twentieth-century</b> philosophy.

40|$|The {{history of}} police and {{policing}} {{have been the subject}} of much interest and research in recent years, but this book provides the first serious academic exploration of the origins and development of the role of soldier-policemen: the gendarmeries of nineteenth-century Europe. The author presents a detailed account of the French Gendarmeries from the old regime up to the First World War, and looks at the reasons for how and why this model came to be exported across continental Europe in the wake of the Revolutionary and Napoleonic armies. In particular their role is examined within the differing national contexts of Italy, Germany and the Habsburg Empire. The gendarmeries, it is argued, played a significant role in establishing the state, particularly in rural areas. As the physical manifestation of the state, gendarmes carried the state's law and a promise of protection, whilst at the same time ensuring in turn that the state received its annual levies of conscripts and taxes This account fully explores how the organisation and style of nineteenth-century soldier-policing in France developed in such a way that it brought the idea of the state and the state's law to <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>twentieth-century</b> continental Europe...|$|E

40|$|What remains {{from the}} fin-de-siecle Mozart revival is, of course, its {{aesthetic}} influence on twentieth-century neoclassicism and modernism, particularly within {{the tradition of}} the Second Viennese School. Despite the fantastic commercial popularity that Mozart's music now enjoys, from the historian's perpective the turn to Mozart {{in the early twentieth century}} constituted an effort to revive the claims among many musicians on behalf of a model of purely musical hearing and listening. A premium on form and procedures of musical development within works of music-on structural devices overtly detached from the sort of extramusical illustration associated with Wagner-became a hallmark of much twentieth-century concert music. The turn away from the associative musical strategies of late Romanticism helped make <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>twentieth-century</b> music less accessible and therefore less popular. Wagnerism held the key to the mass audience. Therefore, from the vantage point of the late twentieth century, the rediscovery of Mozart during the early 1900 s helped lead, on the one hand, to the most extreme deification and dissemination of Mozart and his music within the museum of music, and, on the other (albeit indirectly, through the medium of modernist advocates of theories of absolute music) to the relative marginalization of contemporary music and musical modernism in our own time...|$|E
40|$|<b>Much</b> <b>of</b> <b>twentieth-century</b> {{continental}} {{philosophy has}} defined its task as "witnessing the inhuman. " With this is meant, first of all, a critical diagnostic aiming {{to uncover the}} nihilism that brought the modern world into the abyss. The philosophical side of this critique is famously the deconstruction of metaphysics. But witnessing the inhuman also has a positive meaning: the imperative {{to move beyond the}} separation of the human and the inhuman forces philosophy to correctly identify the inhuman {{at the heart of the}} human. This essay engages two attempts at solving the double task of witnessing the inhuman. In the first part, Giorgio Agamben's ethics of testimony is situated in his general project of a deconstruction of what he sees as the inherently dangerous metaphysics of Western logos, conducive to the destructive biopolitics that found in Auschwitz its fateful realization. Rather than a critique at a conceptual level, Agamben's overall project is questioned here on the basis of its practical consequences. Against the disempowering of praxis, Maurice Merleau-Ponty's alternative mode of constructing the witnessing of the inhuman is upheld. Merleau-Ponty's critique of humanism is the most fruitful one, I claim, because it is the one that opens the most promising horizon for truly effective models of ethical, political, and aesthetic praxis. 22 page(s...|$|E

Does {{a focus on}} private management of assets take {{attention away from the}} real issues in the future of Social Security? The demographer Richard Easterlin, in his book Birth and Fortune, advanced the proposition that large birth cohorts necessarily follow small ones, and small cohorts follow large. The unexpectedly high living standards that small generations enjoy give rise to relatively large families, and the large generations' disappointment with their living standards leads to reluctance to have many children.

40|$|Jules Henri Poincaré may rightly be {{considered}} the father of modern topology (Leonhard Euler and the Königsberg bridges notwithstanding). It is fitting, therefore, {{that many of the}} questions explored in this thesis originated with Poincaré. Poincaré’s famous conjecture – which has driven so <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>twentieth-century</b> topology – arose, in fact, as the successor of an earlier conjecture. Poincaré originally conjectured that any 3 -manifold with the homology of S 3 is homeomorphic to S 3. But he soon found a counterexample, known today as the Poincaré homology sphere (obtained from S 3 by surgery along the right trefoil with framing 1). As a result, Poincaré re-formulated his conjecture into the now-famous statement that any compact, connected, oriented 3 -manifold with trivial fundamental group is homeomorphic to S 3. Although yet unresolved in dimension three, there is a natural generalization of Poincaré’s conjecture stating that any compact, oriented n-manifold with the homotopy type of S n, n ≥ 4, is homeomorphic to S n. Stephen Smale resolved the Generalized Poincaré Conjecture affirmatively for n ≥ 5 in 1961. Finally, in 1982, Michael Freedman provided a proof in dimension four. Smale approached the Generalized Poincaré Conjecture by investigating the properties of manifolds equivalent up to cobordism.

40|$|Abstract: <b>Much</b> <b>of</b> <b>twentieth-century</b> {{political}} philosophy {{can be seen}} as a polarized debate shuttling back and forth between two extreme positions. On the one hand we have a bold ‘rationalism’ characteristic of liberal political reflection dominant in recent German and North American philosophy. At the other extreme an ‘irrationalism ’ qualifies much work in recent French theory. One source of this polarization is a common intellectual history employed by both sets of political theorists. As is the case with recent {{political philosophy}}, much recent intellectual history vacillates between pro-Enlightenment optimism and anti-Enlightenment pessimism. To flesh out these contrasts, I juxtapose an unlikely pair of intellectual historians also influential on political philosophical thought: Hannah Arendt and Hans Blumenberg. I locate in Blumenberg an over-confidence in modernity’s employment of reason. In Arendt I find a too-pessimistic suspicion of reason coupled with a romantic conception of natality. The error common to both is a Weberian simplification: they understand modernity in univocal terms as an age of relentless rationalization. Herein Blumenberg sees an important promise while Arendt discerns a terrible risk. My assessment confirms Bruno Latour’s insight: “Except for the plus or minus sign, moderns and antimoderns share all the same convictions. ” We should be dissatisfied with both approaches. I conclude by urging a reconsideration of John Dewey’s pragmatism which steers an intellectual historical course between Blumenbergian optimism and Arendtian pessimism. Rooted in this more plausible intellectual historical frame, pragmatist political philosophy is able to avoid the extremes characteristic of much contemporary theory...|$|E

40|$|This {{introduction}} to Economic Anthropology’s special issue on “Energy and Economy” argues {{that we might}} find inspiration for a much more engaged and public anthropology in an unlikely place— 19 th century evolutionist thought. In addition to studying the particularities of energy transitions, which anthropology does so well, a more engaged anthropology might also broaden its temporal horizons to consider {{the nature of the}} future “stage” into which humanity is hurtling in an era of resource depletion and climate change. Net energy (EROEI), or the energy “surplus” on which we build and maintain our complex societal arrangements, is a key tool for anthropologists as we bring our trademark cross-cultural, ethnographically grounded knowledge and perspectives to bear in examining the complex interplay of material infrastructures, energy flows, social organization, and culture. We are now mindful of the always already cultural nature of such circuitry and interactions—in ways obviously unavailable to our nineteenth-century forebears. And yet even as our energy futures are neither predetermined nor inevitable, neither are they as unfettered by material constraints as many have come to think. A robust anthropology of energy informed by awareness of the energetic basis of the historically specific moment in which we find ourselves seems poised to help us get beyond the developmentalist ideas of Morgan and Tylor and to overcome a seeming inability to think comprehensively about the human predicament in simultaneously general and particular terms. We have a chance in the space now opening to get beyond the antinomies—materialist—mentalist, infrastructure—superstructure, agency—structure, objective—subjective, and so on—that dominated <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>twentieth-century</b> anthropology...|$|E
40|$|This study {{begins with}} the {{observation}} that <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>twentieth-century</b> art, literature, and philosophy exhibits a concern with nothing itself. Both Martin Heidegger and Jean Paul Sartre, for example, perceive that nothing is part-and-parcel of (man’s) being. The present study adopts a similar position concerning nothing and its essential relationship to being, but adds a third element: that of writing narrative. This relationship between nothing and narrative is, I argue, established {{in the writings of}} Friedrich Nietzsche, Mikhail Bakhtin, Jacques Derrida, and Julia Kristeva. As Heidegger and Sartre position nothing as essential to the creation of being, so Nietzsche, Bakhtin, Derrida, and Kristeva figure nothing as essential to the production of narrative. The parallels between their theories regarding nothing and being, and nothing and narrative, are particularly telling, especially as the twentieth century deconstructs our notions of reality and fiction, rendering these increasingly indistinguishable from one another. This thesis regarding nothing’s relationship to narrative is further developed through analysis of the literary works of Nikolai Gogol, Herman Melville, Vladimir Nabokov, Samuel Beckett, and Victor Pelevin. These authors compose literature that not only gives narrative form to nothing itself (narratives about nothing), but that also envisions nothing as a generator of narrative (narratives of nothing). My phrase narratives of nothing indicates the symbiotic relationship between nothing and writing, wherein nothing resides at the forever-deferring center of a semiotic system that produces writing, narrative fiction, and thus “reality” as we know it. In each of the texts I have selected, there is a clear relationship established between (1) the act of writing, producing narrative and/or meaning, and (2) nothing or one of its many signifiers (e. g. void, cipher, zero, etc.). My analysis ultimately refigures the transcendental signified as nothing itself. Nothing as the transcendental signified is therefore the ever-deferring generator of a system of signifiers that perpetually recreate their own original transcendental signified. Because of this, nothing as the transcendental signified is an infinite nothing that constantly transforms depending on its own signifiers’ significations...|$|E
40|$|University of Minnesota Ph. D. dissertation. May 2015. Major: English. Advisors: Siobhan Craig, Maria Damon. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); v, 238 pages. This dissertation shows how twentieth-century advances in media technology {{have contributed to}} a surge of formal experimentation in postwar American literature and film. Scholars have identified a pervasive influence of mass media on avant-garde art in the postwar era, as can be readily witnessed in the celebrity-obsession of Frank OO'Hara's poems or Andy Warhol's films. But more than providing mere subject matter, the technological instruments of popular culture presented artists with new ways to work, challenging the traditional relationship between the artist {{and the work of}} art. <b>Much</b> <b>of</b> <b>twentieth-century</b> literary and critical theory has argued that human perception is endlessly mediated, revealing the concepts of "reality," "the self," and "the author" � to be constructs. I demonstrate that this postmodern conception {{of what it means to}} be an author [...] -and even, to be human is a direct result of the ways that electronic media such as radio and television have reframed perception. I consider how postwar American writers and filmmakers contemplated the aesthetic possibilities of newer media by adopting those technologies for their own use, constructing "literary machines" [...] -technological assemblages that subsume the author's body into the creative process. My project defines "technology"� in Marshall McLuhan's sense of "extenions of man"� in order to show how postwar, pre-digital American literature and film implicated the human body in their understandings of the literary, the cinematic, and the technological. For example, I treat narcotics as a media technology in their own right, provoking users with new ways to see, hear, and experience time. I trace the various roles that drugs have played in twentieth-century theories of literature, media, and human embodiment as well as American literary and film history. Because drugs are a technology literally consumed by the human body, the texts and films that Henry Miller, Terry Southern, John Cassavetes, and William S. Burroughs produced about and under the influence of drugs suggest that the aesthetic and conceptual problems posed by new media technologies are in fact inherent to human experience...|$|E
