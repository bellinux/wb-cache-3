5|$|Membership {{peaked in}} the 1920s, {{but with the}} onset of the Great Depression {{declined}} steadily, and by the 1970s the congregation could no longer afford to heat the sanctuary. <b>Membership</b> <b>has</b> recovered since that low point; the congregation renovated its school/community center in 2004, and in 2008 embarked on a million-dollar capital campaign to renovate the sanctuary.|$|E

NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen has stated that NATO membership is still an option for Ukraine, and support for NATO <b>membership</b> <b>has</b> risen to 63.9 percent in government-controlled Ukraine according to a July 2015 poll.

5|$|Offitt's <b>membership</b> <b>has</b> {{tired of}} endless talk, and plans a general strike, {{a fact of}} which Farnham is {{informed}} by Mr. Temple, a salty-talking vice president of a rolling mill. An element among the strikers also plans to loot houses along Algonquin Avenue, including Farnham's. The strike begins, paralyzing Buffland's commerce, though it is initially nonviolent. Neither the mayor nor the chief of police, when approached by Farnham, are willing to guard Algonquin Avenue. Farnham proceeds to organize Civil War veterans, and purchases weapons to arm them. After Farnham's force rescues the mayor from being attacked, he deputizes them as special police—on condition there is no expense to the city.|$|E

5|$|Larrea's {{prestige}} as {{an influential}} businessman promoted his appointment as {{member of the}} Primera Junta. However, as with the other members, the precise reasons for his inclusion are unclear. The Junta's <b>membership</b> <b>has</b> been considered a balance between Carlotists and Alzaguists. Larrea resigned his wages from his position as Junta member, and organized the resources for the upcoming war of independence. Together with Manuel de Sarratea he drafted a new code regulating business in Argentina, and he also secured the exile of former viceroy Baltasar Hidalgo de Cisneros by bribing {{the captain of the}} ship carrying him, the Dart, to avoid any landfall until reaching the Canary Islands {{on the far side of}} the Atlantic. He supported the execution of Liniers after the defeat of his counter-revolution, and supported the secretary Mariano Moreno against the president Cornelio Saavedra. Larrea voted for the incorporation of deputies from other cities into the Junta, although he had previously indicated his opposition to the proposal. It was intended by Saavedra that this change would reduce Moreno's influence within the Junta.|$|E
