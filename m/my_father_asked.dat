2500|$|Pisemsky {{remembered his}} mother a nervous, dreamy, astute, eloquent (even if not well educated) and rather sociable woman. [...] "Except for those clever eyes of hers, she wasn't good-looking, and once, when I was a student, <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>asked</b> me: 'Tell me Aleksey, {{why do you think}} your mother becomes more {{attractive}} with age?' – 'Because {{she has a lot of}} inner beauty which, as years go by, becomes more and more evident', I answered, and he had to agree with me," [...] Pisemsky later wrote. His mother's cousins were Yury Bartenev, one of the most prominent Russian Freemasons (colonel Marfin in the novel Masons) and Vsevolod Bartenev (Esper Ivanovich in People of the Forties), a Navy officer; both exerted considerable influence upon the boy.|$|E

5000|$|... "Let {{me begin}} {{by saying that}} I am not a “Monarch of Minstrelsy,” not even ... I can remember, as a youngster even before my school days began, <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>asking</b> me if I {{wanted to be a}} minstrel." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What do you mean?" [...] <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>asked,</b> peering {{forward into}} the darkness, for there was no lamp lit in the room. [...] "Come nearer; I cannot see your face." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then it was so! I thought I {{had dreamed}} it. I was {{beginning}} to remember something, and <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>asked</b> me what it was, and then I couldn't remember. Do you believe I shall keep on remembering?" ...|$|E
60|$|May 7.--They are married: we {{have just}} {{returned}} from church. Charles looked so pale this morning that <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>asked</b> {{him if he was}} ill. He said, 'No: only a slight headache;' and we started for the church.|$|E
6000|$|Hetty {{understood}} what prompted him, {{but she would}} not commit herself. [...] "You will do what suits you," [...] she said. [...] "When <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>asks</b> any one to Cedar I really don't often make myself unpleasant to him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then I {{know that}} <b>my</b> <b>father</b> {{will go to}} my people. His head is grey, and his words will not be blown away with the smoke. Let him get on my lodge, and call the name of Hard-Heart aloud. No Pawnee will be deaf. Then let <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>ask</b> for the colt, {{that has never been}} ridden, but which is sleeker than the buck, and swifter than the elk." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Before we parted we were affianced lovers, {{pledged to}} marry {{as soon as}} possible. I wrote to <b>my</b> <b>father,</b> <b>asking</b> for his {{permission}} to wed the lady. But in his reply he utterly forbade any such marriage. Marie also discovered that her parents would not permit a union with a foreigner, and would indeed oppose her marriage with any one at this time.|$|R
6000|$|... "I was passing--going on to Forsyth's place--and <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>asked</b> me to call," [...] she said. [...] "You {{were talking}} about buying cattle, and a man at Dunblane has some good Herefords to sell. Father thinks they would suit you." ...|$|E
60|$|When we were come {{nearly to}} the city <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>asked</b> me if we had any money with which to {{purchase}} food, and I replied by showing him the two silver coins remaining of the amount paid by the Britishers for oysters.|$|E
60|$|Within {{the half}} of an hour we were there, and <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>asked</b> for speech with its master. The serving man looked at me askance, remembering his orders, still he ushered us into the justice room where the Squire sat {{drinking}} ale.|$|E

60|$|Zara. Nay, Selim, I {{do not ask}} it of thee. The proud name <b>my</b> <b>father</b> bears shall ne'er be stained by one false deed of mine. I ask thee but to lead me to the prisoner's cell, that I {{may offer}} freedom, and tell him woman's {{gratitude}} can never fail, nor woman's heart forget. And if <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>ask</b> thee aught of this, thou shalt answer freely. Tell him all, and trust his kindness to forgive; and if evil come I will bear it bravely,--thou shalt not suffer. Thou shalt win thy fair child's freedom, and my fadeless thanks.|$|R
6000|$|... "Then I {{missed him}} at the cross-roads," [...] said Grace.

6000|$|... "Tell me, then, why <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>asked</b> {{you here}} to-night? I can {{understand}} his bringing {{you to the}} opera, {{that was just a}} whim of the moment, but an invitation down here savours of deliberation. Studiously polite though you are to one another, one is conscious all the time of the hostility beneath the surface." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "On my mother's wedding-day," [...] said Maruja, {{in a lower}} voice, [...] "after {{the party}} had come from church to supper in the old casa, <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>asked,</b> 'What dog is that under the table?' When they lifted the cloth to look, a coyote rushed from the very midst of the guests and dashed out across the patio. No one knew how or when he entered." ...|$|E
5000|$|In an {{obituary}} for Awooner, British writer Nii Parkes {{called the}} novel [...] "wonderfully musical prose, its immersion in Accra's history, its obvious confidence {{in its place}} in the world, made me go to <b>my</b> <b>father</b> and <b>ask</b> about the other uncle." ...|$|R
6000|$|... “No; it was Aynsley Clay {{who told}} me. <b>My</b> <b>father</b> {{certainly}} <b>asked</b> {{one of the}} Empress mates {{what had become of}} you, but learned only that you had left the ship. You must remember Aynsley, the yachtsman you met on the island.” ...|$|R

6000|$|He {{went down}} by the same train with Mr. Grey,--"a great grind," [...] as Mountjoy called it, when Mr. Grey {{proposed}} a departure at ten o'clock. Harry followed so as to reach Tretton only in time for dinner. [...] "If I may venture to advise you," [...] said Mr. Grey in the train, [...] "I should do in this matter whatever <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>asked</b> me." [...] Hereupon Mountjoy frowned. [...] "He is anxious to make some provision for you." ...|$|E
60|$|It did {{not strike}} me as strange then that <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>asked</b> his way of no man, but went to a little {{ordinary}} in a humbler part of the town. After a modest meal {{in a corner of}} the public room, we went out for a stroll. Then, from the wharves, I saw the bay dotted with islands, their white sand sparkling in the evening light, and fringed with strange trees, and beyond, of a deepening blue, the ocean. And nearer,--greatest of all delights to me,--riding on the swell was a fleet of ships. My father gazed at them long and silently, his palm over his eyes.|$|E
6000|$|... "I cannot {{tell you}} much, Lady," [...] {{returned}} Richard. [...] "The last thing I recollect on that dreadful day was, that <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>asked</b> for quarter- -for us--for my brother Henry and me. We heard the reply: 'No quarter for traitors!' and Henry fell before us a dead man. My father shouted, 'By {{the arm of}} St. James, {{it is time for}} me to die!' I saw him, with his sword in both hands, cut down a wild Welshman who was rushing on me. Then I saw no more, till in the moonlight I was awakened by this dog's cool tongue licking the blood from my face, and heard his low whining over me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "At {{any rate}} I could write to <b>my</b> <b>father</b> and <b>ask</b> him," [...] Roland said. [...] "He may not {{remember}} the numbers; it is hardly possible that he should, when there are such {{a lot of them}} missing; but {{he might be able to}} give us some hint how to set about it." ...|$|R
50|$|Many years later, {{in researching}} <b>my</b> <b>father’s</b> life, I <b>asked</b> Cliff Langley, Doc’s co-corpsman, about the {{discovery}} of Iggy’s body. Langley told me it looked to him as though Ralph Ignatowski had endured just about every variety of physical cruelty imaginable.|$|R
30|$|<b>My</b> <b>father</b> {{is a very}} {{conservative}} person, I {{feel that it is}} not easy for him to finally accept that we are together. Now he finally accepted us, he would ask, “how are you guys doing?“ because he knew that I have already moved into with him. I remember that when I brought David home, and he lived with me in <b>my</b> room. <b>My</b> <b>father</b> even <b>asked</b> <b>my</b> mom to suggest us “not do that thing’ (not having sex), but now they knew we live together, and didnot say anything.|$|R
6000|$|She replied, {{very simply}} and candidly: [...] "I was born near Cincinnati. My {{father was a}} spiritualist early in the 'craze,' as it was called, and I was about nine when I became a medium. At first {{we did not know}} that I was the psychic. Demons seemed to take {{possession}} of our house, and for a few weeks nothing movable was safe. After awhile my father became sure that I was the cause of these disturbances, because everywhere I went raps were heard: the movement of small objects near where I sat made me an object of aversion or of actual terror to my school-mates. So finally <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>asked</b> me to sit. I didn't want to do so at first, but he told me it was my duty. They used to tie me in every way and experiment with me. It was very wearisome to me, but I submitted, and I have been devoted to the work ever since. After my father and mother died I gave up all opposition to my gift, and now it is a great comfort to me; for now I get messages from my father and my little daughter almost every day." ...|$|E

5000|$|Due to her activism, Chinese state {{security}} agents visited and threatened {{her father in}} China, attempting to have him sever all contact with her.

60|$|Wood. I {{must have}} a ramble in the town: When I have spent my money, I will grow dutiful, see <b>my</b> <b>father,</b> and <b>ask</b> for more. In the mean time, I have beheld a {{handsome}} woman at a play, I am {{fallen in love with}} her, and have found her easy: Thou, I thank thee, hast traced her to her lodging in this boarding-house, and hither I am come, to accomplish my design.|$|R
6000|$|... "Son," [...] {{replied the}} Sultan of the Indies, [...] "I {{should be very}} sorry if what I ask of you should cause me the displeasure of never seeing you more. I find you don't know the power a husband has over a wife; and yours would show that her love to you was very {{indifferent}} if she, with the power she has of a fairy, should refuse you so trifling a request as this I desire you to ask of her for my sake." [...] The Prince went back, and was very sad for fear of offending the Fairy. She kept pressing him {{to tell her what}} was the matter, and at last he said: [...] "Madam, you may have observed that hitherto I have been content with your love, and have never asked you any other favor. Consider then, I conjure you, that it is not I, but the Sultan <b>my</b> <b>father,</b> who indiscreetly, or at least I think so, begs of you a pavilion large enough to shelter him, his Court, and army from the violence of the weather, and which a man may carry in his hand. But remember it is the Sultan <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>asks</b> this favor." ...|$|R
5000|$|Dalgliesh {{worked with}} the {{textbook}} department at Charles Scribner and Sons editing social studies books. This led to an invitation to start a children's book publishing department at the firm in 1934. According to Charles Scribner, Jr., at that time [...] "Scribner's employed no women except secretaries. When she came to <b>my</b> <b>father</b> and <b>asked</b> him to give her an office, he replied, 'Oh, {{do you really need}} one?'" [...] Apparently he had expected her to begin and run the division out of her home. She held the position of children's book editor until 1960.|$|R
