Linux has full support for XFS and JFS, FAT (the DOS file system), and HFS, the <b>main</b> <b>file</b> system for the Macintosh. Support for Microsoft Windows NT's NTFS file system has been developed and is now comparable with other native Unix file systems.

50|$|The textual {{data can}} be {{specified}} in multiple languages. In the actual device description only text identifiers are used. Separate text lists (for each supported language one is necessary) link the corresponding language-dependent text to the text identifier.

50|$|A {{physical}} journal logs {{an advance}} copy of every block that will later be {{written to the}} <b>main</b> <b>file</b> system. If there is a crash when the <b>main</b> <b>file</b> system is being written to, the write can simply be replayed to completion when the file system is next mounted. If there is a crash when the write is being logged to the journal, the partial write will have a missing or mismatched checksum and can be ignored at next mount.|$|E

As from then he easily could navigate through the menu and select the program he wanted to launch.|$|R
