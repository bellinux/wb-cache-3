40|$|In {{addition}} to melanin-producing cells {{similar to those}} in mammalian skin, the skin of reptiles possesses three other specialized chromatophores: iridophores, xanthophores, and erythrophores [3]. Characteristic ultrastructural and biochemical features of all chromatophore cells have been described for several species of reptiles [1, 2]. One <b>malignant</b> <b>chromatophoroma</b> (melanin-producing) in a Western terrestrial garter snake (Thamnophis elegans terrestris) has been reported [5]. Tumors were removed from the skin of a gopher snake (Pituophis catenifer var. sayi) on three separate occasions over a span of 14 months. The original growth was a solitary, subcutaneous 3 X 1 X 1 -cm nodule. Tumors of similar size recurred twice at the original site, and were removed. Histologically similar tumors appeared at distant locations in the skin and were removed at the second and third surgeries. All tumors were bright orange and extremely friable. Larger tumors had necrotic centers. While it was easy to distinguish tumor tissue from host tissue at surgery, it was difficult to remove all neoplastic tissue because of extensive invasion of underlying fascia and perimysium. The original tumor was submitted to the United States Army Medical Research Institute o...|$|E
