I knew that honour required me to pursue, and I had a vivid impression of having just been {{down in the}} dust with a very wiry and active and dirty little antagonist of disagreeable odour and incredible and incalculable unscrupulousness, kneeling on me and gripping my arm and neck. I wanted of course to be even with him, but also I doubted if catching him would necessarily involve that. They kicked my cap into the ditch {{at the end of}} the field, and made off compactly along a cinder lane while I turned aside to recover my dishonoured headdress. As I knocked the dust out of that and out of my jacket, and brushed my knees and readjusted my very crumpled collar, I tried to focus this startling occurrence in my mind.|$|E
60|$|In endeavouring to {{make out}} the cause of the {{lamination}} of these igneous feldspathic rocks, let us return to the facts so minutely described at Ascension. We there see, that some of the thinnest layers are chiefly formed by numerous, exceedingly minute, though perfect, crystals of different minerals; that other layers are formed by the union of different kinds of concretionary globules, and that the layers thus formed, often cannot be distinguished from the ordinary feldspathic and pitchstone layers, composing {{a large portion of the}} entire mass. The fibrous radiating structure of the sphaerulites seems, judging from many analogous cases, to connect the concretionary and crystalline forces: the separate crystals, also, of feldspar all lie in the same parallel planes. (The formation, indeed, of a large crystal of any mineral in a rock of <b>mixed</b> <b>composition</b> implies an aggregation of the requisite atoms, allied to concretionary action. The cause of the crystals of feldspar in these rocks of Ascension, being all placed lengthways, is probably the same with that which elongates and flattens all the brown sphaerulitic globules (which behave like feldspar under the blowpipe) in this same direction.) These allied forces, therefore, have played an important part in the lamination of the mass, but they cannot be considered the primary force; for the several kinds of nodules, both the smallest and largest, are internally zoned with excessively fine shades of colour, parallel to the lamination of the whole; and many of them are, also, externally marked in the same direction with parallel ridges and furrows, which have not been produced by weathering.|$|E

40|$|The cement-less wastepaper-based {{lightweight}} block (CWLB) is a {{newly developed}} eco-friendly non-load bearing block manufactured from majorly cellulosic wastes {{without the use}} of cement. The main constituents of CWLB includes; wastepaper aggregate (WPA) produced from post-consumer wastepaper, waste additive and sand. This study was conducted to determine its optimum <b>mix</b> <b>composition</b> and the corresponding strength and stiffness properties. The experimentations carried out covered; the optimization of the <b>mix</b> <b>composition</b> of CWLB using the Taguchi statistical optimization technique (TSOT) and the determination of the compressive strength, density, elastic modulus and the ultrasonic pulse velocity (UPV) of the optimal CWLB specimen. The findings from the TSOT ascertains that the optimum <b>mix</b> <b>composition</b> of CWLB comprises of processing parameters including; 2. 5 WPA/sand ratio, 0. 75 water/binder ratio, and 3. 5 Metric ton (i. e. 13. 7 MPa) compacting force. Also, {{it was found that the}} optimal CWLB exhibited; an average compressive strength of 2. 71 MPa, an average density of 901. 5 kg/m 3, an average UPV of 989. 9 m/s and an estimated elastic modulus of 883. 4 MPa. The comparison of these properties with the applicable standard requirements indicates the suitability of CWLB for non-load bearing application. In addition, the presence of 75 % waste content in the <b>mix</b> <b>composition</b> of CWLB indicates its eco-friendliness and its potential to contribute to the sustainability in the construction industry through reduction in natural resources consumption. The innovation presented in this study includes; the development of a suitable optimum <b>mix</b> <b>composition</b> of constituent materials for the novel CWLB, the identification of factors that affects it strength properties and the determination of its engineering properties.

60|$|There is one incident, however, in {{connection}} with the war in this region which one would desire to pass over in silence if such a course were permissible. Some eighty miles to the east of Pietersburg is a wild part of the country called the Spelonken. In this region an irregular corps, named the Bushveld Carbineers, had been operating. It was raised in South Africa, but contained both Colonials and British in its ranks. Its wild duties, its <b>mixed</b> <b>composition,</b> and its isolated situation must have all militated against discipline and restraint, and it appears to have degenerated into a band not unlike those Southern 'bush-whackers' in the American war to whom the Federals showed little mercy. They had given short shrift to the Boer prisoners who had fallen into their hands, the excuse offered for their barbarous conduct being that an officer who had served in the corps had himself been murdered by the Boers. Such a reason, even if it were true, could of course offer no justification for indiscriminate revenge. The crimes were committed in July and August 1901, {{but it was not until}} January 1902 that five of the officers were put upon their trial and were found to be guilty as principals or accessories of twelve murders. The corps was disbanded, and three of the accused officers, Handcock, Wilton, and Morant, were sentenced to death, while another, Picton, was cashiered. Handcock and Morant were actually executed. This stern measure shows more clearly than volumes of argument could do how high was the standard of discipline in the British Army, and how heavy was the punishment, and how vain all excuses, where it had been infringed. In the face of this actual outrage and its prompt punishment how absurd becomes that crusade against imaginary outrages preached by an ignorant press abroad, and by renegade Englishmen at home.|$|E
6000|$|Let {{this single}} fact be quietly meditated upon by our {{ordinary}} painters, {{and they will}} see {{the truth of what}} was above asserted,--that if a great thing can be done at all, it can be done easily; and let them not torment themselves with twisting of compositions this way and that, and repeating, and experimenting, and scene-shifting. If a man can compose at all, he can compose at once, or rather he must compose in spite of himself. And this is the reason of that silence which I have kept in most of my works, on the subject of Composition. Many critics, especially the architects, have found fault with me for not [...] "teaching people how to arrange masses;" [...] for not [...] "attributing sufficient importance to composition." [...] Alas! I attribute far more importance to it than they do;--so much importance, that I should just as soon think of sitting down to teach a man how to write a Divina Commedia, or King Lear, as how to [...] "compose," [...] in the true sense, a single building or picture. The marvellous stupidity of this age of lecturers is, that they do not see that what they call [...] "principles of composition," [...] are mere principles of common sense in everything, as well as in pictures and buildings;--A picture is to have a principal light? Yes; and so a dinner is to have a principal dish, and an oration a principal point, and an air of music a principal note, and every man a principal object. A picture is to have harmony of relation among its parts? Yes; and so is a speech well uttered, and an action well ordered, and a company well chosen, and a ragout well <b>mixed.</b> <b>Composition!</b> As if a man were not composing every moment of his life, well or ill, and would not do it instinctively in his picture as well as elsewhere, if he could. Composition of this lower or common kind is of exactly the same importance in a picture that it is in any thing else,--no more. It is well that a man should say {{what he has to say}} in good order and sequence, but the main thing is to say it truly. And yet we go on preaching to our pupils as if to have a principal light was every thing, and so cover our academy walls with Shacabac feasts, wherein the courses are indeed well ordered, but the dishes empty.|$|E

40|$|Shrinkage {{cracking}} is a {{major problem}} in view of the durability of cement-based materials. One way to mitigate shrinkage, and thus reduce or avoid shrinkage cracking, consists in adding a shrinkage-reducing admixture (SRA) during mixing. SRAs are known for their capability to reduce shrinkage but the current state of knowledge on SRAs lacks in regard to: (i) their influence on other concrete properties and (ii) the influence of the concrete composition on the SRA performance. The present research evaluates the influence of two SRAs produced by different companies on two distinct self-compacting concrete (SCC) <b>mix</b> <b>compositions.</b> Each <b>mix</b> <b>composition</b> was studied for 0 %, 1 %, 2 % and 5 % of the SRA-topowder weight ratio. Tests were carried out in order to evaluate the influence and the performance of the SRA type and its content on concrete fresh properties, hardening and shrinkage evolution. After 330 days the E-modulus, compressive strength, resistivity and chloride diffusion tests were evaluated in the same specimens that had been previously used for shrinkage measurement.

The distribution of SiC particles on the internal walls of the bubbles has been investigated by scanning electron microscopy observations, which evidenced also the presence of particles of another phase, identified as Ti 3 Al by energy dispersion spectroscopy. Some tests, performed without SiC particles, showed that the Al foaming occurs also under these conditions, however foams exhibit few bubbles of very large size and irregular shape.
