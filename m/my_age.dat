5|$|Football on the Pacific Coast {{had been}} on the rise since the late 1910s. Early in 1922, Warner signed a {{contract}} with Stanford University in which he would begin coaching in 1924 (after his contract with Pitt expired). Health concerns, a significant pay raise and the rising status of Pacific Coast football made Warner make the big change. Years later, he wrote:I felt my health would be better on the Pacific coast. Weather conditions at Pittsburgh during the football season are rather disagreeable, and much of the late season work had to be done upon a field which was ankle deep in mud. At the close of every season I would be in poor physical condition, twice being rendered incapable of coaching while I recuperated in a hospital. Doctors advised me that the climate of the Pacific coast would be much better for a man of <b>my</b> <b>age</b> and in the work in which I was engaged.|$|E

25|$|Reflecting on {{her work}} in musical films, Powell said: People are always fascinated by the {{so-called}} golden age of musicals, but it wasn’t all that great. Everything was glazed. Those movies didn’t reflect reality. I was at MGM for 11 years and nobody ever let me play anything but teenagers. I was 25 years old with kids of my own and it was getting ridiculous. Publicity was froth. Everything you said was monitored. With me, they didn’t have to worry. I never had anything to say, anyway. It was hard work, I had no friends, no social interaction with people <b>my</b> <b>age</b> and the isolation was tough. But I had to support my family, so I did what I was told and had no other choice.|$|E

5000|$|I {{made the}} {{transition}} from choreography to filmmaking between 1972 and 1975. In a general sense my burgeoning feminist consciousness was an important factor. An equally urgent stimulus was the encroaching physical changes in <b>my</b> <b>aging</b> body.|$|R
25|$|In an oral history, Lopez-De La Cruz remembered some {{circumstances}} {{of being a}} female labor organizer. “It was very hard being a woman organizer. Many of our people <b>my</b> <b>age</b> and older were raised with the old customs where the husband rules and the wife obeys… Neighbors in Parlier were for the union, {{but they were not}} taking orders from women.” She suggested reforms to make the union more inclusive to women, for example her “suggestion” to add women to the all male ranch committee of Christian Brothers Wine Company, and her push to end a ban on women pruning, making higher paying work available to women’s crews at the Christian Brothers Wine Company. She also remembered how women took the lead in volunteering for store front picket lines and engaging customers in conversations about the struggle. Aside from being an efficient and passionate organizer, Lopez-De La Cruz is remembered for her incredible wit. Many stories have survived of her ability to invoke humor and justice in situations. For example, after being red bated at a picket line at a Fresno Safeway in the mid 1960s and being asked by a white man “how do you say communists in Spanish?”, she responded “Ustedes Ganaran” (You shall win), and the man went on to passionately shout the phrase while UFW members looked on and laughed.|$|E
25|$|Next after fine colors, I like plain white. One of my sorrows, {{when the}} summer ends, is that I must put off my cheery and {{comfortable}} white clothes and enter {{for the winter}} into the depressing captivity of the shapeless and degrading black ones. It is mid-October now, and the weather is growing cold {{up here in the}} New Hampshire hills, but it will not succeed in freezing me out of these white garments, for here the neighbors are few, and it is only of crowds that I am afraid. I made a brave experiment, the other night, to see how it would feel to shock a crowd with these unseasonable clothes, and also to see how long it might take the crowd to reconcile itself to them and stop looking astonished and outraged. On a stormy evening I made a talk before a full house, in the village, clothed like a ghost, and looking as conspicuous, all solitary and alone on that platform, as any ghost could have looked; and I found, to my gratification, that it took the house less than ten minutes to forget about the ghost and give its attention to the tidings I had brought.I am nearly seventy-one, and I recognize that <b>my</b> <b>age</b> has given me a good many privileges; valuable privileges; privileges which are not granted to younger persons. Little by little I hope to get together courage enough to wear white clothes all through the winter, in New York. It will be a great satisfaction to me to show off in this way; and perhaps the largest of all the satisfactions will be the knowledge that every scoffer, of my sex, will secretly envy me and wish he dared to follow my lead.|$|E

500|$|In an {{interview}} in 2013, Cher reflected on how her voice had evolved {{during the course of}} her career, eventually getting stronger and suppler over the years. While she didn't really like it at the beginning, working with vocal coaches had made a significant difference; she stated in the Toronto Sun: [...] "It's so freaky because people <b>my</b> <b>age</b> are having to lose notes and I'm gaining notes, so that's pretty shocking." ...|$|E

500|$|In 1983, on her {{way back}} from Paris, Steinberg began dancing in the studio of Moses Pendleton, who had founded the modern dance company Pilobolus. She had been {{attracted}} to Pilobolus growing up: [...] "I was taller than most girls <b>my</b> <b>age,</b> and I thought that was a company I could be with because the women were always lifting the men." [...] There she joined up with Daniel Ezralow, Jamey Hampton, and Ashley Roland, and the four created the Connecticut-based, dancer-illusionist company MOMIX. From 1983 to 1986, Steinberg toured nationally with MOMIX. The group became known for their visual humour, contorted positions, and Trompe-l'œil effects.|$|E
500|$|At this time, as an {{adolescent}} in Los Angeles, bebop and the swing era big bands both attracted Farmer's attention. Decades later, he stated that, at that time, [...] "I knew I {{had to be}} in jazz. Two things decided me – the sound of a trumpet section in a big band and hearing a jam session". Farmer's trumpet influences in the 1940s were Dizzy Gillespie, Miles Davis and Fats Navarro, but, in his own words, [...] "then I heard Freddie Webster, and I loved his sound. I decided to work on sound because it seemed like most of the guys <b>my</b> <b>age</b> were just working on speed".|$|E

500|$|Enema of the State was an {{enormous}} commercial success, though the band was criticized as synthesized, manufactured pop only remotely resembling punk and pigeonholed as a joke act due to the puerile slant of its singles and associating music videos. The album sold over 15 million copies worldwide, catapulting the band {{to become one of}} the biggest rock bands of the turn of the century. [...] "What's <b>My</b> <b>Age</b> Again?", [...] "All the Small Things" [...] and [...] "Adam's Song" [...] became hit singles and MTV staples, generating heavy radio airplay.
