5|$|Clinicians {{assess the}} {{physical}} aspects {{such as the}} appearance of a patient, including apparent age, height, weight, and manner of dress and grooming. Colorful or bizarre clothing <b>might</b> <b>suggest</b> mania, while unkempt, dirty clothes <b>might</b> <b>suggest</b> schizophrenia or depression. If the patient appears much older than his or her chronological age this can suggest chronic poor self-care or ill-health. Clothing and accessories of a particular subculture, body modifications, or clothing not typical of the patient's gender, might give clues to personality. Observations of physical appearance might include the physical features of alcoholism or drug abuse, such as signs of malnutrition, nicotine stains, dental erosion, a rash around the mouth from inhalant abuse, or needle track marks from intravenous drug abuse. Observations can also include any odor which <b>might</b> <b>suggest</b> poor personal hygiene due to extreme self-neglect, or alcohol intoxication. Weight loss could also signify a depressive disorder, physical illness, anorexia nervosa or chronic anxiety.|$|E
5|$|The small seated {{statue of}} Menkauhor wearing the robe of the Sed festival <b>might</b> <b>suggest</b> a longer reign, since this festival was {{typically}} celebrated {{only after a}} ruler had spent 30 years on the throne. However, Egyptologist Hartwig Altenmüller deems this hypothesis unlikely.|$|E
5|$|A {{year before}} their 1972 Eldredge and Gould paper, Niles Eldredge {{published}} {{a paper in}} the journal Evolution which suggested that gradual evolution was seldom seen in the fossil record and argued that Ernst Mayr's standard mechanism of allopatric speciation <b>might</b> <b>suggest</b> a possible resolution.|$|E
50|$|There is {{a curious}} Sundanese legend of Sangkuriang that {{mentioned}} the existence of Bandung lake. This folklore mentioned the mythical origin on the creation lake Bandung and Mount Tangkuban Perahu. This <b>might</b> <b>suggested</b> the collective native Sundanese memories about the lake existence, transmitted through oral tradition in Pantun Sunda through ages.|$|R
50|$|The {{characterization}} of these behaviors <b>might</b> <b>suggests</b> that crown shyness {{is simply the}} result of mutual shading based on well-understood shade avoidance responses. Malaysian scholar Francis S.P. Ng, who studied Dryobalanops aromatica in 1977 suggested that the growing tips were sensitive to light levels and stopped growing when nearing the adjacent foliage due to the induced shade.|$|R

5|$|Bal Gangadhar Tilak has {{credited}} Jainism {{with the}} cessation of slaughter of animals in the brahamanical religion. Some scholars have traced the origin of Ahimsa to Jains and their precursor, the sramanas. According to Thomas McEvilley, a noted Indologist, certain seals of Indus Valley civilisation depict a meditative figure surrounded by a multitude of wild animals, providing evidence of proto yoga tradition in India akin to Jainism. This particular image <b>might</b> <b>suggest</b> that all the animals depicted are sacred to this particular practitioner. Consequently, these animals would be protected from harm.|$|E
5|$|The plumage colour is genetically controlled, {{and studies}} in Finland and Italy {{indicate}} that grey-morph tawny owls have more reproductive success, better immune resistance, and fewer parasites than brown birds. Although this <b>might</b> <b>suggest</b> that eventually the brown morph could disappear, the owls show no colour preference {{when choosing a}} mate, so the adverse selection pressure is reduced. There are also environmental factors involved. The Italian study showed that brown-morph birds were found in denser woodland, and in Finland, Gloger's rule would suggest that paler birds would in any case predominate in the colder climate.|$|E
5|$|The signs s1, s2 and s3 on the {{right-hand}} sides of the equations may be chosen in eight possible ways, and each choice of signs gives up to two solutions, since the equation for r's is quadratic. This <b>might</b> <b>suggest</b> (incorrectly) that there are up to sixteen solutions of Apollonius' problem. However, due to a symmetry of the equations, if (r's, x's, y's) is a solution, with signs s'i, then so is (−r's, x's, y's), with opposite signs −s'i, which represents the same solution circle. Therefore, Apollonius' problem has at most eight independent solutions (Figure2). One way to avoid this double-counting is to consider only solution circles with non-negative radius.|$|E

5|$|It {{is unknown}} exactly when Voltaire wrote Candide, but {{scholars}} estimate {{that it was}} primarily composed in late 1758 and begun as early as 1757. Voltaire {{is believed to have}} written a portion of it while at his house in Ferney and also while visiting Charles Théodore, the Elector-Palatinate at Schwetzingen, for three weeks in the summer of 1758. Despite solid evidence for these claims, a popular legend persists that Voltaire wrote Candide in three days. This idea is probably based on a misreading of the 1885 work La Vie intime de Voltaire aux Délices et à Ferney by Lucien Perey (real name: Clara Adèle Luce Herpin) and Gaston Maugras. The evidence indicates strongly that Voltaire did not rush or improvise Candide, but worked on it over a significant period of time, possibly even a whole year. Candide is mature and carefully developed, not impromptu, as the intentionally choppy plot and the aforementioned myth <b>might</b> <b>suggest.</b>|$|E
5|$|Rovers won {{once again}} in an away game against Upton Park at West Ham Park by a {{scoreline}} of 3–0 in the fifth round. The match was more competitive than the scoreline <b>might</b> <b>suggest,</b> as Blackburn were a goal down at half time but won the game after a goal by John Inglis and two by Joe Lofthouse in the second half. At Birmingham in a neutral venue, they defeated Notts County in the semi-final 1–0. As with Olympic against Queen's Park, Notts also complained of events that took place during their semi-final. They argued that Rovers had illegally fielded Inglis, a player from Glasgow who had played for Rangers and was only drafted it to the Blackburn team to improve their cup performance. A letter was produced by Rovers {{to show that he}} had been expelled from Rangers because he continued to play for the English team instead. Notts wanted the match to be replayed without Inglis, but the FA did not uphold the complaint.|$|E
5|$|There {{is also an}} {{indeterminate}} {{relationship between}} the figures in the spandrels and the lunettes beneath them. Because of {{the constraints of the}} triangular shape, in each spandrel the figures are seated on the ground. In six of the eight spandrels the compositions resemble traditional depictions of the Flight into Egypt. Of the two remaining, one shows a woman with shears trimming the neck of a garment she is making while her toddler looks on. The Biblical woman who is recorded as making a new garment for her child is Hannah, the mother of Samuel, whose child went to live in the temple, and indeed, the male figure in the background is wearing a distinctive hat that <b>might</b> <b>suggest</b> that of a priest. The other figure who differs from the rest is a young woman who sits staring out of the picture with prophetic intensity. Her open eyes have been closed in the restoration.|$|E

5|$|All figures quoted for {{the losses}} of the cavalry brigades {{as a result}} of this charge are estimates, as {{casualties}} were only noted down after the day of the battle and were for the battle as a whole. Some historians, Barbero for example, believe the official rolls tend to overestimate the number of cavalrymen present in their squadrons on the field of battle and that the proportionate losses were, as a result, considerably higher than the numbers on paper <b>might</b> <b>suggest.</b> The Union Brigade lost heavily in both officers and men killed (including its commander, William Ponsonby, and Colonel Hamilton of the Scots Greys) and wounded. The 2nd Life Guards and the King's Dragoon Guards of the Household Brigade also lost heavily (with Colonel Fuller, commander of the King's DG, killed). However, the 1st Life Guards, on the extreme right of the charge, and the Blues, who formed a reserve, had kept their cohesion and consequently suffered significantly fewer casualties. On the rolls the official, or paper strength, for both Brigades is given as 2,651 while Barbero and others estimate the actual strength at around 2,000 and the official recorded losses for the two heavy cavalry brigades during the battle was 1,205 troopers and 1,303 horses.|$|E
5|$|As {{the term}} double burden <b>might</b> <b>suggest,</b> when people {{consider}} paid work vs. unpaid work, they often consider them as two separate entities - {{that the man}} or woman is doing one or the other, {{but not at the}} same time. In reality, men and especially women often undertake both paid and unpaid labor simultaneously, creating the issue of work intensity, where the person undertakes many activities {{at the same time in}} order to compensate for the time necessary to accomplish many things in one day. Household surveys often only let people write down one thing that they are doing at any given time, and do not take into consideration that they may be cooking while cleaning, or sewing while taking care of the children. Because of this, the time taken for child care and other domestic activities may be underestimated. This coping mechanism of undertaking two or more tasks at once can especially be seen in women in developing countries. For example, many Caribbean rural women use this as a method of increasing the number of things they can accomplish in a day.|$|E
5|$|Bede relates that Paulinus told Edwin {{that the}} birth of his and Æthelburg's {{daughter}} at Easter 626 was because of Paulinus' prayers. The birth coincided with a foiled assassination attempt on the king by a group of West Saxons from Wessex. Edwin promised to convert to Christianity and allow his new daughter Eanflæd to be baptised if he won a victory over Wessex. He did not fulfill his promise immediately after his subsequent military success against the West Saxons however, only converting after Paulinus had revealed the details of a dream the king had before he took the throne, during his exile at the court of King Rædwald of East Anglia. In this dream, according to Bede, a stranger told Edwin that power would be his in the future when someone laid a hand on his head. As Paulinus was revealing the dream to Edwin, he laid his hand on the king's head, which was the proof Edwin needed. A late seventh-century hagiography of Pope Gregory I claims that Paulinus was the stranger in the vision; if true, it <b>might</b> <b>suggest</b> that Paulinus spent some time at Rædwald's court, although Bede does not mention any such visit.|$|E

5|$|When {{a colony}} is dying, for {{whatever}} cause, and other healthy colonies are nearby (as is typical in a bee yard), those healthy colonies often enter the dying colony and rob its provisions {{for their own}} use. If the dying colony's provisions were contaminated (by natural or man-made toxins), the resulting pattern (of healthy colonies becoming sick when in proximity to a dying colony) <b>might</b> <b>suggest</b> to an observer that a contagious disease is involved. However, it is typical in CCD cases that provisions of dying colonies are not being robbed, suggesting that at least this particular mechanism (toxins being spread via robbing, thereby mimicking a disease) {{is not involved in}} CCD. Additional evidence that CCD is an infectious disease came from the following observations: the hives of colonies that had died from CCD could be reused with a healthy colony only if they were first treated with DNA-destroying radiation, and the CCD Working Group report in 2010 indicated that CCD-exhibiting hives tended to occur in proximity to one another within apiaries.|$|E
