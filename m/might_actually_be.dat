5|$|Attribution {{is often}} {{difficult}} with Farsari's photographs because 19th-century photographers frequently acquired each others' images and sold them under their own names. This {{may be due to}} the commonplace exchange of stock and negatives between various commercial photographers, or due to the number of freelance amateurs who sold their work to more than one studio. Thus a photograph identified as by Farsari <b>might</b> <b>actually</b> <b>be</b> by Beato, Stillfried & Andersen or Kusakabe. A case in point is the photograph of an Officer's Daughter, variously attributed to Farsari, Stillfried, Kusakabe or even Suzuki Shin'ichi.|$|E
5|$|When Häyhänen {{announced}} {{himself at}} the embassy on 4 May, he appeared drunk. The Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) officials at the Paris embassy did not find Häyhänen's story credible. They weren't convinced he <b>might</b> <b>actually</b> <b>be</b> a Russian spy until he produced a hollow Finnish 5-mark coin. Upon opening the coin a square of microfilm was revealed. On May 11, the CIA returned him to the United States and handed {{him over to the}} FBI. As a member of a Soviet spy ring operating on American soil, Häyhänen came under the FBI's jurisdiction and they began verifying his story.|$|E

5|$|Small sized {{pterosaur}} species {{apparently were}} present in the Csehbánya Formation, indicating a higher diversity of Late Cretaceous pterosaurs than previously accounted for. The recent findings of a small cat-sized adult azhdarchid further indicate that small pterosaurs from the Late Cretaceous <b>might</b> <b>actually</b> have simply <b>been</b> rarely preserved in the fossil record, helped by {{the fact that there is}} a strong bias against terrestrial small sized vertebrates such as juvenile dinosaurs, and that their diversity <b>might</b> <b>actually</b> had <b>been</b> much larger than previously thought.|$|R
5|$|In {{his later}} years, Fermi {{continued}} {{teaching at the}} University of Chicago. His PhD students in the post-war period included Owen Chamberlain, Geoffrey Chew, Jerome Friedman, Marvin Goldberger, Tsung-Dao Lee, Arthur Rosenfeld and Sam Treiman. Jack Steinberger was a graduate student. Fermi conducted important research in particle physics, especially related to pions and muons. He made the first predictions of pion-nucleon resonance, relying on statistical methods, since he reasoned that exact answers were not required when the theory was wrong anyway. In a paper co-authored with Chen Ning Yang, he speculated that pions <b>might</b> <b>actually</b> <b>be</b> composite particles. The idea was elaborated by Shoichi Sakata. It has since been supplanted by the quark model, in which the pion {{is made up of}} quarks, which completed Fermi's model, and vindicated his approach.|$|E
5|$|Lactifluus piperatus was the {{original}} type species of the genus Lactarius. However, after the finding that Lactarius actually represented more than one genus, the species Lactarius torminosus was conserved as type for that genus. Thus, L. piperatus is now the type species of Lactifluus, which was split from Lactarius and contains mainly tropical milk-caps, but also some species of the north temperate zone. Phylogenetic research showed that L. glaucescens, sometimes considered only a variety of L. piperatus, is a distinct species in Europe. Furthermore, the existence of at least ten lineages worldwide, with no overlap among continents, was shown for the group around L. piperatus, suggesting that populations in North America <b>might</b> <b>actually</b> <b>be</b> distinct species.|$|E
5|$|The biographies {{cover the}} {{emperors}} from Hadrian to Carinus and Numerian. A section covering the reigns of Philip the Arab, Decius, Trebonianus Gallus, Aemilian {{and all but}} {{the end of the}} reign of Valerian is missing in all the manuscripts, and {{it has been argued that}} biographies of Nerva and Trajan have also been lost at the beginning of the work, which may suggest the compilation might have been a direct continuation of Suetonius. It has been theorized that the mid-3rd-century lacuna <b>might</b> <b>actually</b> <b>be</b> a deliberate literary device of the author or authors, saving the labour of covering Emperors for whom little source material may have been available.|$|E

25|$|The {{tradeoff}} {{comes in}} terms of power and accuracy; AA #2 is designed for small cases, and will burn inconsistently in the large 44 Magnum case. AA #9, however, will fill the case much better, and the slow burn rate of AA #9 is ideal for magnum handgun rounds, producing 20% higher velocities (at maximum levels) while still producing less pressure than the fast burning AA #2. A medium burning powder <b>might</b> <b>actually</b> <b>be</b> a better choice, as it could split the difference in powder weights while delivering more power and accuracy than the fastest powder.|$|E
25|$|Few studies {{into the}} {{chemical}} nature of turacoverdin {{have been performed}} to date. Research by R.E. Moreau in the 1950s showed it to be less soluble in basic solutions than its chemical cousin turacin. While originally thought to contain little copper by its discoverer, who instead believed it to be iron-based, later spectroscopic analysis demonstrated high copper (and low iron) content in pigment from the green feathers of the Knysna turaco and the Schalow's turaco. Moreau also demonstrated that the green coloration of turacos <b>might</b> <b>actually</b> <b>be</b> due to the combined effect of two different turacoverdin pigments that differ slightly in polarity.|$|E
50|$|Yang in 1959 placed Chialingosaurus in the Stegosaurinae {{within the}} Stegosauridae.

25|$|During design, planning, {{maintenance}} and construction, metric is used. As a result, (and anticipating that the roadsigns themselves {{will one day}} be changed to display in metric units) recently erected signs are increasingly being placed at metric intervals but display an imperial unit as required by the current road-signage rules. For example, a 110yd marker <b>might</b> <b>actually</b> <b>be</b> placed at the 100m distance. Since 2008, location marker posts have appeared on motorways and major A roads in England, situated generally at intervals of 500 metres (though the dimension is not given). These repeat the information given on the co-sited surveyors' marker post which, since the 1960s, have reported distances on such roads in kilometres from a datum—usually the start of the road, or the planned start-point of the road.|$|E
25|$|Czerkas also {{believed}} that the animal may {{have been able to}} fly better than Archaeopteryx, the animal usually referred to as the earliest known bird. He cited the fused sternum and asymmetrical feathers, and argued that Microraptor has modern bird features that make it more derived than Archaeopteryx. Czerkas cited the fact that this possibly volant animal is also very clearly a dromaeosaurid to suggest that the Dromaeosauridae <b>might</b> <b>actually</b> <b>be</b> a basal bird group, and that later, larger, species such as Deinonychus were secondarily flightless (Czerkas, 2002). The current consensus is that there is not enough evidence to conclude whether dromaeosaurs descended from an ancestor with some aerodynamic abilities. The work of Xu et al. (2003) suggested that basal dromaeosaurs were probably small, arboreal, and could glide. The work of Turner et al. (2007) suggested that the ancestral dromaeosaur could not glide or fly, but that there was good evidence that it was small-bodied (around 65 centimeters long and 600-700grams in mass).|$|E

500|$|Despite {{the work}} of Zhou et al.

500|$|During {{the period}} of Republican expansionism when slavery had become pervasive, war captives were a main source of slaves.

Slaves were also traded in markets, and sometimes sold by pirates. Infant abandonment and self-enslavement among the poor were other sources. Vernae, by contrast, were [...] "homegrown" [...] slaves born to female slaves within the urban household or on a country estate or farm.
