40|$|The {{diagonal}} quadratic approximation (DQA) {{algorithm is}} extended {{for the case}} of risk-averse utility and other nonlinear functions associated with stochastic programs. The method breaks the stochastic program into a sequence of smaller quadratic programming subproblems that can be executed in parallel. Each subproblem is solved approximately {{by means of a}} convex version of a primal-dual interior-point code (LOQO). Convergence of the distributed DQA method is discussed. All communication takes place among neighboring processors rather than via a <b>master</b> <b>routine</b> leading to an efficient distributed implementation. Results with a realworld airline planning model possessing a convex objective, 155, 320 linear constraints and 303, 600 variables, show the DQA algorithm’s efficiency.

40|$|The present paper {{deals with}} an {{innovative}} approach to control compound multiswitching converter systems. The proposed modulation strategy directly controls the external current. A simple tracking algorithm working {{at very high}} frequency manages the switching of {{the system as a}} whole. Once the switching action is decided by a <b>master</b> <b>routine,</b> the choose of which leg has to be effectively switched is demanded to a separate slave routine. An acceleration algorithm and a maximum leg currents protection are also adopted. Under the proposed approach the system bandwidth is related to the global switching frequency equal to the valve frequency multiplied by the number of valves. As long as the external current is directly measured and processed by the master control, cumulative errors from acquisitions and processing of single leg currents are avoided. Consequently both system dynamics and accuracy over external current are greatly improved. Details of the proposed control and simulation results are reported...|$|E

40|$|In this paper, we for {{the first}} time {{simulate}} the process of hydrodynamic bead aggregation in a flat micro-fluicid chamber by a porous-media model in an iterative routine. This allows us to optimize the chamber design of our recently developed experimental method to form periodical monolayers from the flow of bead suspension. Periodical monolayers are advantageous for parallel assay formats since they enhance the mechanical rigidity of the aggregated pattern. This is important to avoid a spatial rearrangement along various steps of a read-out procedure which would impair the correlation between measurements. Furthermore, the monolayer formation guarantees the individual optical accessibility of all probe beads. By modelling the monolayers with porous media, we can drastically reduce the degrees of freedom in a two-phase, multi-particle problem. This way, we are able to compute stationary hydrodynamic flow patterns in the chamber. In order to simulate the complete filling process from these stationary solutions, we developed an iterative <b>master</b> <b>routine</b> which takes the transient aggregation pattern as the initial condition, then evaluates the placement of the newly introduced beads, and finally converts the points of aggregation into porous media...|$|E

40|$|This {{library is}} a set of subroutines {{designed}} for vector plotting to CRT's, plotters, dot matrix, and laser printers. LONGLIB subroutines are invoked by program calls similar to standard CALCOMP routines. In addition to the basic plotting routines, LONGLIB contains an extensive set of routines to allow viewport clipping, extended character sets, graphic input, shading, polar plots, and 3 -D plotting with or without hidden line removal. LONGLIB capabilities include surface plots, contours, histograms, logarithm axes, world maps, and seismic plots. LONGLIB includes master subroutines, which are self-contained series of commonly used individual subroutines. When invoked, the <b>master</b> <b>routine</b> will initialize the plotting package, and will plot multiple curves, scatter plots, log plots, 3 -D plots, etc. and then close the plot package, all with a single call. Supported devices include VT 100 equipped with Selanar GR 100 or GR 100 + boards, VT 125 s, VT 240 s, VT 220 equipped with Selanar SG 220, Tektronix 4010 / 4014 or 4107 / 4109 and compatibles, and Graphon GO- 235 terminals. Dot matrix printer output is available by using the provided raster scan conversion routines for DEC LA 50, Printronix printers, and high or low resolution Trilog printers. Other output devices include QMS laser printers, Postscript compatible laser printers, and HPGL compatible plotters. The LONGLIB package includes the graphics library source code, an on-line help library, scan converter and meta file conversion programs, and command files for installing, creating, and testing the library. The latest version, 5. 0, is significantly enhanced and has been made more portable. Also, the new version's meta file format has been changed and is incompatible with previous versions. A conversion utility is included to port the old meta files to the new format. Color terminal plotting has been incorporated.

40|$|This study aims at {{revealing}} the school {{culture and its}} professional development activities. In essence, it attempts to reveal the relationships among the context, teachers beliefs, practices, and interactions. Little is documented as to how inservice teachers perceive English language teaching, how they actually teach, how they interact with colleagues, and how they continue to learn to teach in a Japanese learning environment. Using multiple data sources including interviews, observations, surveys, and documents of teachers in an English department, this yearlong study revealed that experiencing new teaching practices in classrooms was not sufficient for teacher learning toward professional development {{to occur in the}} school and department context. The teaching culture of this school was consistent and almost immutable throughout the study. Responses from these teachers revealed at least three rules for this particular teaching culture: (1) Managing students and managing various work took precedence over teaching; (2) Communication and collaboration centered on keeping pace with others and getting through the day, rather than solving teaching issues; (3) It was particularly important to teach the same way for the common test and to maintain classroom management. The teaching culture of this school was defined and sustained by teachers beliefs. As teachers worked together in this school culture, they identified with one another and shared the same beliefs about school norms and values, the subject matter, students, and other work. Thus, individual teachers prioritized their educational beliefs over any beliefs they may have brought to the context. Consequently, these teachers reinforced their beliefs, existing practices, and internal interactions in this school context. The study revealed that these EFL (English as a foreign language) teachers lacked many teacher learning opportunities in their context. Although the majority of teachers replied that they learned how to teach by watching other teachers in this school context, there had been only a few peer-observations throughout the yearlong study. Experienced teachers were reluctant to have their classes observed and critiqued, while young teachers socialized themselves to the norm of teaching as other experienced teachers did. It was evident that a few peer-observations only helped these young teachers <b>master</b> <b>routine</b> practices. In addition, experienced teachers reported that they had been teaching the same way based on their second language (L 2) learning and initial teaching experiences. As long as they teach the same way according to the existing curriculum, they do not seem to need any new ideas. In fact, a majority of teachers continued to avoid attending workshops outside the school. In contrast, only a few teachers tried out new ideas, and then mainly in special classes. However, those teaching experiences were little reported or shared, and innovation remained marginalized in this school and department context. As a result, individual trial and error generated few teacher learning opportunities for professional development in this school and department context. The study described the teaching culture through comprehensive investigation of the relationships among context, beliefs, practices, and interactions. The study revealed the context-specific nature of beliefs, which prioritized managing students and various kinds of work over teaching the subject in this school context. As long as teachers maintain such beliefs, they choose not to participate in many teacher learning opportunities in this context. This study calls for reconceptualization of teacher development in school contexts. Future questions remain as to how teachers can be life-long learners in their workplace...|$|E

40|$|Many {{researchers}} have noted how children's whole number schemes {{can interfere with}} their efforts to learn fractions. This paper examines the persistence of whole number schemes among 14 year-old students who appear to have successfully <b>mastered</b> <b>routine</b> algorithms for working with fractions. Uncovering whole number thinking among such students is therefore difficult, and is illustrated {{through the use of}} several probing interview tasks, revealing quite different forms of whole number thinking. These forms of thinking can give correct answers also making it difficult for teachers to identify incorrect thinking about fractions. Representations of fractions using number lines can assist in identifying and correcting such thinking. Hunting (1986), Streefland (1984), Bezuk (1988) and Kieren (1980 a; 1980 b) have suggested that difficulties experienced by children solving rational number tasks arise because rational number ideas are sophisticated and different from natural number ideas and that children have to develop the appropriate images, actions and language to precede the formal work with fractions, decimals and rational algebraic forms. The research reported above has focused quite properly on difficulties experienced by young children when they first encounter rational numbers. Relatively, little research has taken place with older students. Like Hannula (2003), this paper focuses on difficulties with fractions experienced by older students. Many of these students appear still to use whole number thinking which Behr, Wachsmuth, Post and Lesh (1984) defined as “making separate comparisons of numerators and denominators using the ordering of whole numbers ” (p. 332).
