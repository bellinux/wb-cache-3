25|$|The Institution Anthem {{was written}} by E.W.Jesudason, RI's {{headmaster}} from 1963 to 1966. It is sung every <b>Monday</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Y1-4 and every Tuesday at Y5-6 assemblies, at the closure of all formal Institution events {{as well as in}} celebration of the Institution's triumphs. Although the anthem refers to Prometheus and God, the school maintains secular principles. The inclusion of Prometheus is due to the literary allusion to passing the torch, signifying the importance of education while 'God' in this context is a historical legacy of the school's British roots.|$|E

It was inaugurated by the eccentric local landowner Joseph Pocklington in 1792, {{and after a}} lapse {{of more than two}} centuries was revived in 2013. Its organisers describe it as [...] "A weekend of mayhem and madness afloat, with the chance to climb aboard in a variety of races on Derwentwater". The Keswick Agricultural Show, founded in 1860, has traditionally been held on August Bank Holiday <b>Monday</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> western edge of the town on the Crossing Fields section of the open land known as the Howrahs. The show features both commercial and charity stands, and attracts large numbers of competitors, exhibitors and spectators. From 2014 the venue has changed to Pump Field, a few hundred yards further from the town centre towards Braithwaite.|$|E

6000|$|A little demur {{as to the}} {{reasonableness}} of this stipulation followed, but {{the terms}} finally were established. Mr. and Mrs. Grey, old family friends, had long been engaged to spend the ensuing <b>Monday</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Homestead. The elder daughter, an old intimate of Grace's, had married an Indian civil servant, whom Colonel Keith was invited to meet at luncheon, and Captain Keith at dinner, and Alick was further to sleep at Gowanbrae. Lady Temple, who {{was to have been}} of the party, was called away, much to her own regret, by an appointment with the dentist of St. Norbert's, who was very popular, and proportionately despotic, being only visible at his own times, after long appointment. She would therefore be obliged to miss Alick's ordeal, though as she said, when Rachel--finding it vain to try to outstay so many--had taken her leave, [...] "I should much like to see how it will turn out. I do believe that there is some difference in the colour of the ink in the middle and at the edge, and if those people are deceiving Rachel, who knows what they may be doing to the poor children?" ...|$|E

60|$|The {{postscript}} had {{not been}} added without much consideration. What would the tailor think of this invitation? Would he not be disposed to take it as encouragement in his pernicious suit? Would he not go to Keppel Street with a determination to insist upon the girl's promise? The Serjeant had {{thought that it would}} be best to let the thing take its chance. But the Serjeant's wife, and the Serjeant's daughters, and the Countess, too, had all agreed that something if possible should be said to disabuse him of this idea. He was to have nine thousand pounds paid to him. Surely that might be sufficient. But, if he was greedy and wanted more money, more money should be given to him. Only he must be made to understand that the marriage was out of the question. So the Serjeant again gave way, and proposed the interview. Daniel sent back his compliments to the Serjeant and begged to say he would do as he was bid. He would call at the Serjeant's chambers on the Saturday, and in Keppel Street on the following <b>Monday,</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> hours named.|$|E
6000|$|My dear Fanny--I {{shall be}} with you next <b>Monday</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> farthest. I could not keep my promise of seeing you again in a week because I am in so {{unsettled}} {{a state of mind}} about what I am to do--I have given up the Idea of the Indiaman; I cannot resolve to give up my favorite studies: so I purpose to retire into the Country and set my Mind at work once more. A Friend of Mine who has an ill state of health called on me yesterday and proposed to spend a little time with him {{at the back of the}} Isle of Wight where he said we might live very cheaply. I agreed to his proposal. I have taken a great dislike to Town--I never go there--some one is always calling on me and as we have spare beds they often stop a couple of days. I have written lately to some acquaintances in Devonshire concerning a cheap Lodging and they have been very kind in letting me know all I wanted. They have described a pleasant place which I think I shall eventually retire to. How came you on with my young Master Yorkshire Man? Did not Mrs. A. sport her Carriage and one? They really surprised me with super civility--how did Mrs. A. manage it? How is the old tadpole gardener and little Master next door? it is to be hop'd they will both die some of these days. Not having been to Town I have not heard whether Mr. A. purposes to retire from business. Do let me know if you have heard anything more about it. If he should not I shall be very disappointed. If any one deserves to be put to his shifts it is that Hodgkinson--as for the other he would live a long time upon his fat and be none the worse for a good long lent. How came miledi to give one Lisbon wine--had she drained the Gooseberry? Truly I cannot delay making another visit--asked to take Lunch, whether I will have ale, wine, take sugar,--objection to green--like cream--thin bread and butter--another cup--agreeable--enough sugar--little more cream--too weak--12 shillin etc. etc. etc.--Lord I must come again. We are just going to Dinner I must must[101] with this to the Post---- ...|$|E
