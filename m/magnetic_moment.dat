5|$|In {{addition}} to the intrinsic <b>magnetic</b> <b>moment,</b> Ganymede has an induced dipole magnetic field. Its existence is connected with the variation of the Jovian magnetic field near Ganymede. The induced moment is directed radially to or from Jupiter following {{the direction of the}} varying part of the planetary magnetic field. The induced <b>magnetic</b> <b>moment</b> is an order of magnitude weaker than the intrinsic one. The field strength of the induced field at the magnetic equator is about 60 nT—half of that of the ambient Jovian field. The induced magnetic field of Ganymede is similar to those of Callisto and Europa, indicating that Ganymede also has a subsurface water ocean with a high electrical conductivity.|$|E
5|$|The Galileo craft made six close flybys of Ganymede from 1995–2000 (G1, G2, G7, G8, G28 and G29) and {{discovered}} that Ganymede has a permanent (intrinsic) <b>magnetic</b> <b>moment</b> independent of the Jovian magnetic field. The value of the moment is about , which is three {{times larger than the}} <b>magnetic</b> <b>moment</b> of Mercury. The magnetic dipole is tilted with respect to the rotational axis of Ganymede by 176°, which means that it is directed against the Jovian <b>magnetic</b> <b>moment.</b> Its north pole lies below the orbital plane. The dipole magnetic field created by this permanent moment has a strength of 719 ± 2 nT at Ganymede's equator, which should be compared with the Jovian magnetic field at the distance of Ganymede—about 120 nT. The equatorial field of Ganymede is directed against the Jovian field, meaning reconnection is possible. The intrinsic field strength at the poles is two times that at the equator—1440 nT.|$|E

5|$|The Galileo orbiter {{found that}} Europa has a weak <b>{{magnetic}}</b> <b>moment,</b> which is {{induced by the}} varying part of the Jovian magnetic field. The field strength at the magnetic equator (about 120 nT) created by this <b>magnetic</b> <b>moment</b> is about one-sixth the strength of Ganymede's field and six times the value of Callisto's. The existence of the induced moment requires a layer of a highly electrically conductive material in Europa's interior.

5|$|The dipole is tilted roughly 10° from Jupiter's axis of rotation; {{the tilt}} {{is similar to}} that of the Earth (11.3°). Its {{equatorial}} field strength is about 776.6μT (7.766G), which corresponds to a dipole <b>magnetic</b> <b>moment</b> of about 2.83 T·m3. This makes Jupiter's magnetic field about 20 times stronger than Earth's, and its <b>magnetic</b> <b>moment</b> ~20,000times larger.

5|$|At the {{suggestion}} of C. J. Gorter, the team attempted to use an oscillating field. This {{became the basis for}} the nuclear magnetic resonance method. In 1937, Rabi, Kusch, Millman and Zacharias used it to measure the <b>magnetic</b> <b>moment</b> of several lithium compounds with molecular beams, including lithium chloride, lithium fluoride and dilithium. Applying the method to hydrogen, they found that the moment of a proton was 2.785±0.02 nuclear magnetons, and not 1 as predicted by the then-current theory, while that of a deuteron was 0.855±0.006 nuclear magnetons. This provided more accurate measurements of what Stern's team had found, and Rabi's team had confirmed, in 1934. Since a deuteron is composed of a proton and a neutron with aligned spins, the neutron's <b>magnetic</b> <b>moment</b> could be inferred by subtracting the proton's <b>magnetic</b> <b>moment</b> from the deuteron's. The resulting value was not zero, and had a sign opposite to that of the proton. Based on curious artifacts of these more accurate measurements, Rabi suggested that the deuteron had an electric quadrupole moment. This discovery meant that the physical shape of the deuteron was not symmetric, which provided valuable insight into the nature of the nuclear force binding nucleons. For the creation of the molecular-beam magnetic-resonance detection method, Rabi was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1944.|$|E

Hyperons {{are treated as}} MIT bags, and the interactions {{are considered to be}} mediated by the exchange of scalar and vector mesons which are approximated as mean fields.
