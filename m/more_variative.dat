40|$|According to {{the most}} of students, {{chemistry}} is an abstract and diffi cult subject. The learning approach that can attract the studentsâ€™ interest and correlate the science, environment, technology, and society aspects, and therefore enhance the studentsâ€™ academic result, should be applied. This research was conducted using quasi-experimental method with cluster random sampling technique. The developed instruments consist of the learning sets using salingtemas approach, test sets, observation and questionnaire sheets. The result of this {{research shows that the}} chemistry learning on chemical bond topic using salingtemas approach is effective to enhance the studentsâ€™ academic result and come up the studentsâ€™ learning interest. The implementation of chemistry learning using salingtemas approach is suggested to be performed using <b>more</b> <b>variative</b> method in order to more improvement of studentsâ€™ interest and academic result.

40|$|Students’ {{academic}} achievement {{is one of}} main indicator of education goals. This research aimed to analyze adolescents’ characteristics, family’s characteristics, academic emotions, and learning strategies, {{and its effect on}} {{academic achievement}} of high school students. The locations were chosen purposively in Bogor District. Samples of this study were 132 high school students from both X and Y high schools by proportional random sampling technique. Data were collected through questionnaires and filled-in by samples. The data analysis used descriptive analysis (minimum value, maximum value, average, standard deviation, and frequency) and inferential analysis (Spearman correlation test, Pearson correlation test, and multiple linear regression test). Result showed that positive-activation emotion was mostly felt by adolescents. Learning strategies that mostly used were time/study environment management and help-seeking, meanwhile in general learning strategy usage was still low. Female students engaged <b>more</b> <b>variative</b> learning strategies and better academic achievement than male students. Positive-activation emotion had increased the learning strategies, and the variety of learning strategies usage will affect academic achievement positively. Meanwhile, family characteristics was found have no significant effect on learning neither strategies nor academic achievement...|$|E

It was considered final from the Qur’an dan Hadits teachings, so it was sacral, complete and difficult to critic, and the students of Islamic Education be stagnant and less creative. Kitab kuning must {{be considered as a}} culture product, and had many falseness. It is a duty of Islamic Scholars (ulama) and we to revise this falseness...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} aims {{to design}} pyrolysis reactor, develop pyrolysis operating procedure, and {{to investigate the}} effect of pyrolysis temperature to liquid product quality. The pyrolysis experiments will be performed in batch reactor equipped from carbon steel with 20 cm inside diameter and 40 cm height. The experimental conditions are as follows: temperature range 250 - 400 degrees C, and reaction time 0 - 30 min. The effect of inert (N 2) flow rate to liquid product quality will also be observed. From all variables studied, it seemed that temperature had the highest effect. Chemical reaction rate constant was affected by temperature in accordance with Arrhenius equation. The activation energy of k was 12145, 4 cal. /mole, respectively. This value was not {{so far from the}} extreme values (104 cal/mole) presented by Westerterp et al. These facts ascertained that the chemical reaction step controlled the overall rate of reaction. The highest volatile matter conversion in this research was 46, 5 %, and this was obtained at process conditions of 30 minutes and temperature of 360 oC. The pyrolytic oil yield increase with the increase of the temperature and its composition becomes <b>more</b> <b>variative</b> and few contents of carboxylic acids and aromatics compound...|$|E
