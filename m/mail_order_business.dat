25|$|George Huntington Hartford joined Gilman & Company {{as a clerk}} {{perhaps in}} the late 1850s; Hartford later was {{promoted}} to bookkeeper, then cashier, in 1866. By 1871 Hartford {{was in a position}} of authority and was responsible for expanding A to Chicago after its great fire. A's first store outside New York City was opened just days after the disaster. The firm rapidly expanded; in 1875 A had stores in 16 cities. In 1878, Gilman left the active management of the firm to Hartford. By then, the firm operated 70 lavishly-equipped stores and a <b>mail</b> <b>order</b> <b>business</b> with combined annual sales of $1 million.|$|E
25|$|Gilman {{proved to}} be a master at promotion; the {{business}} quickly expanded by advertising low prices. The firm was able to offer low prices by acting as both the wholesaler and retailer. Gilman also built a nationwide <b>mail</b> <b>order</b> <b>business.</b> By 1866, the firm was valued at more than $1 million. In 1869, the transcontinental railroad was completed; Gilman created a parallel company, the Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea Company, to promote the then-new concept of prepackaged tea under the Thea-Nector name. The tea company continued to use the Great American name for mail-order purposes. In 1871, A introduced another concept when it offered premiums, such as lithographs, china, and glassware with the purchase of coffee and/or tea at its stores. These premiums are now collectibles.|$|E

Shortly after his death, his art dealer said he believed that Skelton made more money on his paintings than from his television work. At {{the time of his}} death, Skelton had produced over 1,000 oil paintings of clowns. [...] When asked why his artwork focused on clowns, he said at first, [...] "I don't know why it's always clowns." [...] He continued after thinking a moment by saying [...] "No, that's not true—I do know why. [...] I just don't feel like thinking about it..."

500|$|Elderly Instruments {{expanded}} {{during the}} following years. Shortly after the 1972 United States Presidential election, the Michigan Youth Politics Institute {{moved out of the}} space across the hall, and Elderly took over the entire basement of the building. [...] In 1975, it expanded into the <b>mail</b> <b>order</b> <b>business.</b> By 1982, Elderly Instruments had about 25employees but little available space, and so in the following year the owners bought an Independent Order of Odd Fellows building in Lansing, Michigan. After it was renovated for retail use, the company moved into it in January 1984, and in 1986 Werbin bought out McInturff to become the sole owner. In 1994, Elderly expanded again by buying adjacent building space that had once been a post office and a National Cash Register Company building. Around the same time, it began taking merchandise orders over its new web site. The company does not, however, sell merchandise through online auction sites such as eBay, unlike many other independent musical instrument retailers. Werbin notes that entering the Internet business was not much of a challenge for Elderly, as the staff was already experienced at taking and shipping orders for customers throughout the world. He also notes that, with its mail order and Internet business accounting for 6570 percent of its total revenue, Elderly would have experienced limited growth in Lansing had it not expanded into those markets. The company operates in around 35,000ft² (3,300m²) of space, {{and is one of the}} largest vintage instruments dealers in the United States.|$|E
500|$|High-profile {{advertising}} {{was central}} to the marketing campaign. Although Sinclair Research was a relatively small company, it had a long-standing policy of using large-scale advertisements that stood out {{in stark contrast to}} the more muted advertisements of other manufacturers. Superlatives, exhortations, appeals to patriotism, testimonials, eye-catching drawings and photographs on double-page spreads, varying from month to month, were used to drum up <b>mail</b> <b>order</b> <b>business</b> for Sinclair. The launch advertising for the ZX81 illustrates this approach. A photograph of the ZX81 alongside the official Sinclair peripherals dominated the centre of a double-page spread. The value for money of Sinclair's products was emphasised by the prices being printed in larger type than any other text on the spread. The ZX81's benefits were promoted with the aspirational slogan [...] "Sinclair ZX81 Personal Computer – the heart of a system that grows with you". The advertisement highlighted ZX81 BASIC Programming, the manual written by Steve Vickers, as [...] "a complete course in BASIC programming, from first principles to complex programs." [...] The educational benefits of the ZX81 were stressed ("it's still very simple to teach yourself computing") and its technical advantages were explained in relatively non-technical terms. For instance, the ZX81's idiosyncratic method of typing commands with a single keystroke – the result of the memory-saving method of using one-byte tokens to represent keywords – was presented as [...] "eliminat a great deal of tiresome typing". The ZX81's British character was emphasised; it was [...] "designed by Sinclair and custom-built in Britain." [...] Sinclair's advertising in the United States provides an illustration of how the company perceived the ZX81's purpose: ...|$|E

50|$|The transcontinental {{railroad}} {{spurred the}} development of trunk and feeder lines and {{the rapid growth of}} Omaha specifically, creating a rail network extending from the city that eventually reached over most of the West. The railroads made possible the transformation of the United States from an agrarian society to a modern industrial nation.

2500|$|Founded in 1859 by George Gilman as [...] "Gilman & Company", {{within a}} few years it opened a small chain of retail, tea, and coffee stores in New York City and {{operated}} a national <b>mail</b> <b>order</b> <b>business.</b> The firm grew to 70 stores by 1878 when Gilman passed management to George Huntington Hartford, who turned A into the country's first grocery chain. In 1900, it operated almost 200 stores. After Hartford acquired ownership, A grew dramatically by introducing the economy store concept in 1912, growing to 1,600 stores in 1915. After World War I, it added stores that offered meat and produce, while expanding manufacturing. In 1930, A, now the world's largest retailer, reached $2.9 billion in sales with 16,000 stores. In 1936, it adopted the self-serve supermarket concept and opened 4,000 larger stores (while phasing out many of its smaller units) by 1950.|$|E
2500|$|A second main {{equivalent}} to a security interest is a [...] "Quistclose trust" [...] named after the case Barclays Bank Ltd v Quistclose Investments Ltd. Here a company named Rolls Razor Ltd had promised to pay a dividend to its shareholders, but had financial difficulty. Already in debt to its bank, Barclays, for £484,000 it agreed to take a loan from Quistclose Investments Ltd for £209,719. This money was deposited in a separate Barclays account, {{for the purpose of}} being paid out to shareholders. Unfortunately, Rolls Razor Ltd entered insolvency before the payment was made. Barclays claimed it had a right to set off the Quistclose money against the debts that were due to it, while Quistclose contended the money belonged entirely to it, and could not be used for the satisfaction of other creditors. The House of Lords unanimously held that a trust had been created in favour of Quistclose, and if the purpose of the payment (i.e. to pay the shareholders) failed, then the money would revert to Quistclose's ownership. While Quistclose trust cases are rare, and their theoretical basis has remained controversial (particularly because the trust is for a purpose and so sits uncomfortably with the rule against perpetuities), trusts have also been acknowledged to exist when a company keeps payments by consumers in a separate fund. In Re Kayford Ltd a <b>mail</b> <b>order</b> <b>business,</b> fearing bankruptcy and not wanting pre-payments by its customers to be taken by other creditors, acted on its solicitors' advice and placed their money in a separate bank account. Megarry J held this effectively ensured other creditors would not have access to this cash. Since the Insolvency Act 1986 reforms, it is probable that section 239, which prohibits transactions that desire to give a preference to one creditor over others, would be argued to avoid such an arrangement (if ever a company does in fact seek to prefer its customers in this way). The position, then, would be that while banks and trade creditors may easily protect themselves, consumers, employees and others in a weaker bargaining position have few legal resources to do the same.|$|E
2500|$|However, {{the courts}} have had {{difficulty}} in defining appropriate principles for cases where trusts are declared over property that many people have an interest in. This is especially true where the person who possesses that property has gone insolvent. In Re Kayford Ltd a <b>mail</b> <b>order</b> <b>business</b> went insolvent and customers who had paid for goods wanted their money back. Megarry J held that because Kayford Ltd had put its money in a separate account the money was held on trust, and so the customers were not unsecured creditors. By contrast in Re London Wine Co (Shippers) Ltd Oliver J held that customers who had bought wine bottles were not entitled to take their wine because no particular bottles had been identified for a trust to arise. A similar view was expressed by the Privy Council in Re Goldcorp Exchange Ltd, where the customers of an insolvent gold bullion reserve business {{were told that they}} never had been given particular gold bars, and so were unsecured creditors. These decisions were said to be motivated by the desire to not undermine the statutory priority system in insolvency, although it is not entirely clear why those policy reasons extended to consumers who are usually seen as [...] "non-adjusting" [...] creditors. However, in the leading Court of Appeal decision, Hunter v Moss, there was no insolvency issue. There, Moss had declared himself to be a trustee of 50 out of 950 shares he held in a company, and Hunter sought to enforce this declaration. Dillon LJ held that it did not matter that the 50 particular shares had not been identified or isolated, and they were held on trust. The same result was reached, however, in an insolvency decision by Neuberger J in the High Court, called Re Harvard Securities Ltd, where clients of a brokerage company were held to have had an equitable property interest in share capital held for them as a nominee. The view that appears to have been adopted is that if assets are [...] "fungible" [...] (i.e. swapping them with other will not make much difference) a declaration of trust can be made, so long as the purpose of the statutory priority rules in insolvency are not compromised.|$|E

2500|$|Annie saved most of {{the money}} she made cooking to start her {{catering}} business which she operated out of her restaurant, the Wayside Inn, which was located {{at the sight of her}} childhood home behind Grindstone schoolhouse. She reportedly had over 1,000 place settings of china and handled many large catered events for the University of Missouri. One of her largest banquets at an Alumni dinner for the University of Missouri she was paid 1,200 dollars at a price of two dollars per plate. Annie's beaten biscuits became so popular that Missourians who had moved out of state would mail order her biscuits to be delivered to states as far away as New York and California. Annie cooked in what she referred to as, [...] "old Missouri style," [...] which meant she used local ingredients to give her food a distinct flavor and her cooking became so popular that she began endorsing local businesses such as the Boone County Mill's H-P flour which she used in her famous biscuits. In 1911, a Sedalia hostess who handled catering for the Missouri State fair made sure Fisher's biscuits were on the presidential table for William Howard Taft's visit. Fisher's ingenuity didn't end in the kitchen, she invented a specific cutter for her biscuits that would keep them from sticking to the surface of the cutter and after Fisher's <b>mail</b> <b>order</b> <b>business</b> had taken off, she incorporated a biscuit brake to meet the demand for her biscuits. In a news article, Fisher reported she usually makes around one million biscuits a year and around 50 dozen biscuits every hour with the help from her daughter. By 1919, Fisher was making 500 dollars a month on selling her biscuits alone, she sold them for 15 cents a dozen. Using the profits from her cooking and catering businesses, Fisher bought her first house in 1901 and paid it off in two years. After her first property purchase, Fisher went on to buy 18 rental properties in the downtown Columbia area, most of which were along what is now Ash street and fifth street. Later after Fisher's catering business had become quite successful, she purchased a 58 acre farm outside of Columbia where she raised livestock and crops to use in her cooking.|$|E
