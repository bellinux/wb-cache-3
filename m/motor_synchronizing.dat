Three kinds of behavior were distinguished: smooth swimming, flexing, and reversals in direction of swimming after a short pause (120 ms). Cell populations exposed to chemoattractants spent, on average, 66, 33, and 1 % of the time in these modes, respectively. After the addition of a chemoattractant, behavior was modified transiently [...] smooth swimming increased, flexing decreased, and reversals were suppressed. After addition of D-xylose (final concentration, 10 mM), the adaptation time (the time required for the populations to return to the unmodified behavior) for S. aurantia was 1. 5 to 2. 0 min.

40|$|A {{continuous}} web {{winding system}} is a large-scale, complex interconnected dynamic system with numerous tension zones to transport the web while processing it. There are two control schemes for large-scale system control: the centralized scheme and the decentralized scheme. Centralized control is the traditional control method, which considers all {{the information about the}} system to be a single dynamic model and design a control system for this model. A speed synchronization control strategy for multiple induction motors, based on adjacent cross-coupling control structure, is developed by employing total sliding mode control method. The proposed control strategy is to stabilize speed tracking of each induction <b>motor</b> while <b>synchronizing</b> its speed with the speed of the other motors so as to make speed synchronization error amongst induction motors converge to zero.

40|$|Dual-motor {{systems have}} been widely used in {{industrial}} applications, and speed synchronization of the motors can always be deteriorated by system parameter uncertainties and load torque perturbations. In this paper, a new robust control strategy for the dual-motor systems is developed by incorporating second order sliding mode control (2 -SMC) techniques. The strategy is to design chatting-free control laws to stabilize speed tracking of each <b>motor</b> while <b>synchronizing</b> their velocity. In the proposed scheme, firstly, speed controller for a single motor is designed to eliminate the effects of system parameter variations and load torque perturbations. Secondly, a cross-coupled architecture based synchronous controller is designed to reduce speed error of the motors caused by characteristic inconsistency and unbalanced load torque. Stability of the closed loop system is analyzed by Lyapunov theory; it is proven that both speed tracking errors and synchronous error can converge to zero. Finally, experiments are performed to examine the effectiveness of the developed controllers. Experimental results will show the good performance of the proposed control scheme...|$|R

40|$|Nature is {{abundant}} in oscillatory activity, with oscillators {{that have the}} remarkable ability of synchronizing to external events. Using electrocorticographic (ECoG) recordings from a subject rhythmically producing consonant-vowel syllables (CVSs) we show that neural oscillators recorded at individual ECoG electrodes become precisely synchronized to initiations of the production of CVSs (i. e., that these initiations occur at precise phases of bandpassed-filtered voltages recorded at most ECoG electrodes). This synchronization is not a trivial consequence of the rhythmic production of CVSs, since it takes several minutes to be fully established and is observed at the frequency of CVS production and at its second harmonic. The phase of filtered voltages at which CVSs are produced varies systematically across the grid of electrodes, consistently with the propagation of traveling waves (TWs). Using these synchronized phases we isolate a first TW in voltages (filtered at the median CVS-production frequency) moving from primary auditory to premotor cortex, and a second TW in high-gamma amplitude (coupled to phase at the CVS-production frequency) moving along the same path but in opposite direction. To our knowledge, {{this is the first}} report of rhythmic <b>motor</b> acts <b>synchronizing</b> spatio-temporally organized cortical activity in the human brain...|$|R

Furthermore, the temporal variability of cycling behavior correlated positively with both P 300 latency and P 300 amplitude.

We show that recurring patterns of directed locomotion are executed in tandem with, co-reset, and co-terminate with the DMP cycle. Calcium waves in the intestine and proton signaling were shown to regulate the DMP. We found that genetic manipulations affecting these calcium dynamics regulated the corresponding patterns of directed locomotion.

40|$|Human Kinesin- 12 (hKif 15) plays {{a crucial}} role in {{assembly}} and maintenance of the mitotic spindle. These functions of hKif 15 are partially redundant with Kinesin- 5 (Eg 5), which can cross-link and drive the extensile sliding of antiparallel microtubules. Although both motors are known to be tetramers, the functional properties of hKif 15 are less well understood. Here we reveal how single or multiple Kif 15 motors can cross-link, transport, and focus the plus-ends of intersecting microtubules. During transport, Kif 15 motors step simultaneously along both microtubules with relative microtubule transport driven by a velocity differential between motor domain pairs. Remarkably, this differential is affected by the underlying intersection geometry: the differential is low on parallel and extreme on antiparallel microtubules where one motor domain pair becomes immobile. As a result, when intersecting microtubules are antiparallel, canonical transport of one microtubule along the other is allowed because one motor is firmly attached to one microtubule while it is stepping on the other. When intersecting microtubules are parallel, however, Kif 15 motors can drive (biased) parallel sliding because the motor simultaneously steps on both microtubules that it cross-links. These microtubule rearrangements will focus microtubule plus-ends and finally lead to the formation of parallel bundles. At the same time, Kif 15 motors cooperate to suppress catastrophe events at polymerizing microtubule plus-ends, raising the possibility that Kif 15 <b>motors</b> may <b>synchronize</b> the dynamics of bundles that they have assembled.
