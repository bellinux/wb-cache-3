50|$|The player <b>must</b> <b>line</b> up falling {{blocks of}} animals and foodstuffs. When an animal is aligned {{adjacent}} to a tile of its favored food, the animal eats the food. Larger groups of connected food of the same type scores higher when eaten.|$|R
50|$|Linebackers - At {{least two}} {{defensive}} players <b>must</b> <b>line</b> {{up at least}} 5 yards behind the line of scrimmage. The other two non-linemen <b>must</b> either <b>line</b> up face-to-face with an offensive non-lineman on the line, or be five yards behind the line of scrimmage. After the snap, this rule is eliminated and the players can roam anywhere they wish, provided it doesn't violate blitzing rules. Linebackers can line up at the goal line if the offense is within five yards of scoring.|$|R
5000|$|Making the {{practice}} of a receiver declared ineligible lining up in the slot formation illegal; ineligible receivers <b>must</b> <b>line</b> up inside the tackle box.

50|$|Also in 2010, the NFL {{mandated}} that during field goals or extra point attempts, defenders <b>must</b> <b>line</b> {{up with their}} entire bodies {{on the outside of}} the snapper's body to protect the snapper while he is in a position of vulnerability. Violations of this rule, however, result in only a five-yard penalty for illegal formation.|$|R
50|$|Defensive Linemen - There must {{be three}} {{defensive}} linemen, and they <b>must</b> <b>line</b> {{up on the}} nose, or can line up inside foot-to-outside foot outside of an offensive lineman. Linemen must rush inside if nose up or slanted into if shaded, and they must make contact before any movement to the outside is made.|$|R
50|$|Offensive Linemen - Three linemen {{must be in}} a three- or four-point stance {{prior to}} the snap. They <b>must</b> <b>line</b> up guard, center, guard and next to one another. Any {{offensive}} lineman not covered up by the fourth man on {{the line of scrimmage}} is an eligible receiver if he is wearing an eligible receiver number (1-49, 80-89).|$|R

2500|$|Formation: four {{offensive}} players <b>must</b> <b>line</b> up on {{the line}} of scrimmage. Three defensive players must be down linemen (in a three or four-point stance). Only the [...] "Mac" [...] linebacker may blitz {{on either side of}} the center. Alignment is two or more yards off the line of scrimmage. No stunting or twisting. Offensive motion in the backfield: one receiver may go in a forward motion before the snap.|$|R
50|$|Each {{team member}} <b>must</b> <b>line</b> up behind a buzzer. Clues and letters are revealeduntil a speller buzzes to {{identify}} the word that the clues point to. If a speller spells acorrectly identified word accurately, they gain a point for their team. The first two teams to reach a scoreof three are safe. The third and final team must face an individual Spelling Bee, where two members willbe sent home.|$|R

50|$|The {{pitch is}} {{rectangular}} in shape. The longer sides are called touchlines. The other opposing sides {{are called the}} goal lines. The two goal <b>lines</b> <b>must</b> be between 45 and 90 m and be the same length. The two touch <b>lines</b> <b>must</b> also be of the same length, and be between 90 and 120 m in length.

50|$|Another {{application}} {{of the law of}} averages is a belief that a sample's behaviour <b>must</b> <b>line</b> up with the expected value based on population statistics. For example, suppose a fair coin is flipped 100 times. Using the law of averages, one might predict that there will be 50 heads and 50 tails. While this is the single most likely outcome, there is only an 8% chance of it occurring. Predictions based on the law of averages are even less useful if the sample does not reflect the population.|$|R
50|$|The novelist Robertson Davies {{once said}} that englynion were an old enthusiasm of his. He said that the form was derived by the Welsh from the {{inscriptions}} on Roman tombs in Wales. According to him, englynion <b>must</b> have four <b>lines,</b> the first one having ten syllables, then six, then the last two having seven syllables each. In the first <b>line</b> there <b>must</b> be a break after the seventh, eighth, or ninth syllable, and the rhyme with the second line comes at this break; but the tenth syllable of the first <b>line</b> <b>must</b> either rhyme or be in assonance with {{the middle of the}} second line. The last two <b>lines</b> <b>must</b> rhyme with the first rhyme in the first line, but the third or fourth <b>line</b> <b>must</b> rhyme on a weak syllable.|$|R

50|$|When {{adding a}} new room, the player {{randomly}} picks one from the pile of unused ones. One restriction is that a door in the new room <b>must</b> <b>line</b> up with a door {{in the room that}} the player is in so a doorway is formed between the two. A second restriction is that a room needs to be either on the same level, or one level above or below the level the player is on (i.e. a doorway cannot directly connect the cellar with the second floor). The plastic staircases are used to basically indicate doorways connecting one level to another.|$|R

All of the <b>lines</b> <b>must</b> rhyme and have the same rhythm.|$|R
5000|$|If a line {{reaches a}} corner of a 2, and the <b>line</b> <b>must</b> {{continue}} {{through one of the}} two connecting sides of the 2, then exactly one of the other two sides of the 2 must be filled, and that <b>line</b> <b>must</b> continue through one of the two connecting sides of the diagonally adjacent square.|$|R

5000|$|On {{the line}} of convergence, the {{question}} of convergence remains open {{as in the case}} of power series. However, if a Dirichlet series converges and diverges at different points on the same vertical line, then this <b>line</b> <b>must</b> be the <b>line</b> of convergence. The proof is implicit in the definition of abscissa of convergence. An example would be the series ...|$|R
5000|$|If a line {{reaches a}} corner of a 3, there <b>must</b> be <b>lines</b> {{on both sides of}} the 3 that said corner is not {{adjacent}} to, because if the 3's sole empty space were not adjacent to it, the corner would have three lines connected to it. Furthermore, the segment leading away from the 3 at the corner reached by the <b>line</b> <b>must</b> be empty; if it were filled, neither of the remaining 2 undetermined sides of the 3 would be able to contain a line.|$|R
