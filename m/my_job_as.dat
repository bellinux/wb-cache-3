He had to find an inner balance to overcome obstacles that went far beyond his career. That's Tony Stark." [...] Favreau faced opposition from Marvel in casting Downey, but would not take no for an answer, saying, [...] "It was <b>my</b> <b>job</b> <b>as</b> a director to show that it was the best choice creatively ... everybody knew he was talented [...] certainly by studying the Iron Man role and developing that script I realized that the character seemed to line-up with Robert in all the good and bad ways.
