5|$|Doom 3 {{was also}} {{intended}} to be more storyline focused than previous id titles, as was demonstrated by the developers' conscious effort to have <b>more</b> <b>professional</b> voice acting. Late in 2002, two employees at ATI Technologies leaked a development version of Doom 3 onto the Internet. One year later, a new trailer was shown at E3 2003 and soon afterwards id Software's website was updated to showcase Doom 3 as an upcoming project, although it was also announced that Doom 3 would not {{be ready for the}} 2003 holiday season. According to John Carmack, the development took longer than expected.|$|E
5|$|From the 1990s onwards, {{track and}} field became {{increasingly}} <b>more</b> <b>professional</b> and international, as the IAAF gained over two hundred member nations. The IAAF World Championships in Athletics became a fully professional competition {{with the introduction of}} prize money in 1997, and in 1998 the IAAF Golden League—an annual series of major {{track and field}} meetings in Europe—provided a higher level of economic incentive {{in the form of a}} US$1 million jackpot. In 2010, the series was replaced by the more lucrative IAAF Diamond League, a fourteen-meeting series held in Europe, Asia, North America and the Middle East—the first ever worldwide annual series of track and field meetings.|$|E
5|$|Since {{dance is}} already an art form, “weapon dance as art” may seem redundant; yet, “art” is used here {{to mean the}} re-creation, say, of a folk weapon dance in a <b>more</b> <b>{{professional}}</b> staged venue, such as a ballet, or when an Australian, Native American, or African troupe of professional musicians and dancers present a reenactment on stage of a weapon dance, or when the use of weapons is introduced in stylized dance enactments of fighting. For example, recent ballets such as the New York City Ballet’s version of Romeo and Juliet (to the music of Sergei Prokofiev) employ highly choreographed sword-fight/dance sequences.|$|E
5000|$|The {{professional}} staff in local BSA councils consists {{of one or}} <b>more</b> commissioned BSA <b>professionals.</b> Smaller councils usually have three to five professionals, medium-sized councils have six or <b>more</b> <b>professionals,</b> and the largest councils may have 20 or <b>more</b> <b>professionals.</b> All professional Scouters are considered [...] "exempt" [...] employees according {{to the standards of}} the Fair Labor Standards Act and are salaried rather than paid by hourly wage. Most councils have a similar number of support staff and camp rangers who are [...] "non-exempt" [...] employees whose duties are very job-specific, limited to standard hours or equivalent labor rules, and paid by hourly wage. The BSA greatly values these non-exempt employees but does not include their positions in the classifications of professional Scouters.|$|R

5|$|The International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) are {{standards}} and interpretations {{developed by the}} International Accounting Standards Board, which are principle-based. IFRS are used by over 115 countries or areas including the European Union, Australia, and Hong Kong. The United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), the standard framework of guidelines for financial accounting, is largely rule-based. Critics have stated that the rules-based GAAP is {{partly responsible for the}} number of scandals that the United States has suffered. The principles-based approach to monitoring requires <b>more</b> <b>professional</b> judgment than the rules-based approach.|$|E
5|$|The {{architecture}} of the Song dynasty (960–1279) was noted for its towering Buddhist pagodas, enormous stone and wooden bridges, lavish tombs, and extravagant palaces. Although literary works on architecture existed beforehand, architectural writing blossomed during the Song dynasty, maturing into a <b>more</b> <b>professional</b> form that described dimensions and working materials in a concise, organized manner. In addition to the examples still standing, depictions in Song artwork, architectural drawings, and illustrations in published books all aid modern historians in understanding the {{architecture of}} the period.|$|E
5|$|The mid-1970s saw the {{beginning}} of a new wave of Canadian comics, one in which the creators chose to remain in Canada, rather than seeking their fortunes south of the border. Richard Comely's Captain Canuck appeared in July 1975, the first appearance of a non-satirical superhero in Canada since the 1940s. During the 1950s and 1960s, the idea of native comics seemed unattainable to Canadian kids, and the appearance of Captain Canuck gave these kids the optimism to make their own. This was followed up with James Waley's <b>more</b> <b>professional,</b> newsstand-distributed Orb, which featured a number of talents that would later take part in the North American comics scene.|$|E
5000|$|As far as {{occupation}} is concerned, residents surveyed {{come from}} all walks of life, ranging from the professionals and managers (28.6%), clerical and administrative workers (19.2%) to technicians and trades workers (15%). There were <b>more</b> <b>professionals</b> in Matraville in 2016 than any other occupation.|$|R
40|$|KUANTAN: The Cooperative College of Malaysia (CCM) will be {{upgraded}} {{to a university}} college soon, Domestic Trade, Cooperative and Consumerism Minister Datuk Hasan Malek said.

50|$|Most of the Lanjwani {{population}} are agriculturist {{but some of}} them are related to animal caregivers, business. Many Lanjwani families are living in Middle East countries and Canada. There are scientist, professors, doctors, engineers and many <b>more</b> <b>professionals</b> from Lanjwani tribes working in the country and abroad.|$|R
5|$|The role of {{the main}} {{caregiver}} is often taken by the spouse or a close relative. Alzheimer's disease is known for placing a great burden on caregivers which includes social, psychological, physical or economic aspects. Home care is usually preferred by people with AD and their families. This option also delays or {{eliminates the need for}} <b>more</b> <b>professional</b> and costly levels of care. Nevertheless, two-thirds of nursing home residents have dementias.|$|E
5|$|Walter {{also helped}} with the {{creation}} of a <b>more</b> <b>professional</b> group of royal justices. Although the group, which included Simon of Pattishall, Ralph Foliot, Richard Barre, William de Warenne, Richard Herriard, and Walter's brother Osbert fitzHervey, had mostly already served as justices prior to Walter's term of office, it was Walter who used them extensively. It appears likely that Walter chose them for their ability, not for any familial ties to himself. This group of men replaced the previous system of using mostly local men, and are the first signs of a professional judiciary.|$|E
5|$|After {{defeating}} Young Battling Nelson again, in {{a rematch}} set in Binghamton, Dyer lost on points {{a week later}} to Wisconsin fighter Pal Reed. He continued to appear at charity contests in the early half of 1919, mainly for the Boxers' Loyalty League, sparring {{with the likes of}} Tim Healy and Silas Green. By now Dyer's vaudeville bookings were far outnumbering his boxing appearances and {{in the latter half of}} 1919 he faced only a handful of opponents in paid boxing matches. These included a newspaper decision loss to Steve Latzo in May and a win over Johnny Evans in New Jersey in July. Between August and September Dyer was part of a touring boxing show organised by the Knights of Columbus, fighting for the entertainment of returned and injured soldiers. Dyer fought a few <b>more</b> <b>professional</b> bouts in America, a draw and a loss to Joe Egan and a newspaper decision win over Jimmy Gray, but by 1920 Dyer had left the country and had returned to Europe.|$|E
50|$|When he was 13, Liu {{travelled}} {{thousands of}} miles to play in southern China, where there were <b>more</b> <b>professionals.</b> There he improved and began to play competitive matches. In 2007, {{the chairman of the}} Asian Snooker Association saw his potential, and he gained a wild card in the China Open.|$|R

50|$|Few collegiate woman golf {{programs}} have produced <b>more</b> <b>professionals</b> than Furman, which has 11 former Lady Paladins on the LPGA Tour, including two World Golf Hall of Fame inductees (Betsy King and Beth Daniel). Furman has claimed 16 Southern Conference championships: 1994-2002, 2004-05, 2008-09, 2015-2017. They {{also won the}} AIAW national championship in 1976 (pre-NCAA championship).|$|R
5|$|Also to this end, and {{to provide}} <b>more</b> <b>professional</b> {{military}} leadership, Diocletian separated military from civil command at the lowest, provincial level. Governors of provinces on the frontiers were stripped of command of the troops stationed there in favour of purely military officers called duces limitis ("border commanders"). Some 20 duces may have been created under Diocletian. Most duces were given command of forces in a single province, but a few controlled more than one province e.g. the dux Pannoniae I et Norici. However, at higher echelons, military and administrative command remained united in the vicarii and praefecti praetorio. In addition, Diocletian completed {{the exclusion of the}} senatorial class, still dominated by the Italian aristocracy, from all senior military commands and from all top administrative posts except in Italy.|$|E
5|$|An English fan {{translation}} of Ace Attorney Investigations 2, subtitled Prosecutor's Path, has been developed, and includes localized names for new {{characters in the}} style of Capcom's Ace Attorney localizations. The translation project was done on the Ace Attorney fan site Court-Records, where a user asked people who were interested in the project to send in applications, which had to be approved for them {{to become part of the}} project. Alexa Ray Corriea at Polygon described this approach as uncommon, with most fan translation projects letting anyone help if they want, but said that it made the project <b>more</b> <b>professional.</b> A patch translating the game's first two episodes was released in 2013, and a complete patch for the game was released in 2014. A final patch was later released in 2015.|$|E
5|$|At the war's end in 1945, Ull {{only had}} {{fourteen}} members. Its average member age was lowered to 65 {{years after the}} admission of five new members in 1946 and 1947. The post-war period also saw the admission to SK Ull of men from <b>more</b> <b>professional</b> groups. One of the new members, Erik Plahte, would serve as chairman from 1951 to 1973, when he backed down {{at the age of}} 84. Another of the new post-war members, Jakob Vaage, took over. He was then aged 68. By 1953, all the club's elected positions were held by post-war members. Three of the older members, some with experience dating to the 1880s, were admitted as honorary members, the first honorary members in SK Ull since 1889.|$|E
50|$|The {{third one}} {{is the lack of}} experts specializing in horticultural therapy. Since this therapy is still a rather new {{developing}} type of treatment in Hong Kong, there are not so many specialists in this field. As a results, it is difficult for Serene Oasis to have <b>more</b> <b>professionals</b> and improve the efficiency of their therapy.|$|R
25|$|From 1946 to 1964, {{the total}} number of Filipinos in Canada was 770. During the 1960s, Canada {{recruited}} <b>more</b> <b>professionals,</b> mostly from the United States, with some coming directly from the Philippines. Most of these nurses, technicians, office workers and doctors arrived in Winnipeg, Manitoba. In the late 1960s, more Filipinos came to Winnipeg to work in the garment industry.|$|R
50|$|NSA’s goal in {{establishing}} centers of academic excellence {{is to reduce}} vulnerability in our national information infrastructure by promoting higher education in information assurance and producing <b>more</b> <b>professionals</b> with IA expertise in various disciplines. This designation applies to the entire university, although the degrees under this program are graduate degrees that are primarily issued through the Graduate School of Computer and Information Sciences.|$|R
5|$|By {{the second}} half of the fourteenth century, in {{addition}} to forces raised on the basis of common service and feudal obligations, money contracts of bonds or bands of manrent, similar to English indentures of the same period, were being used to retain <b>more</b> <b>professional</b> troops, particular men-at-arms and archers. In practice, forms of service tended to blur and overlap, and several major Scottish lords brought contingents from their kindred. These systems produced relatively large numbers of poorly armoured infantry, usually armed with 12–14 foot spears. They often formed the large close order defensive formations of shiltrons, able to counter mounted knights as they did at Bannockburn, or infantry assault as at Otterburn in 1388, but vulnerable to arrows (and later artillery fire) and relatively immobile, as they proved at Halidon Hill in 1333 and Humbleton Hill in 1402.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the death}} of Gene Upshaw in 2008, Richard Berthelsen was named interim {{executive}} director, serving from August 2008 until March 2009. The NFLPA Board of Representatives elected DeMaurice Smith for a three-year term as the executive director on March 16, 2009. Smith has been largely praised for his work ethic by the media, current and former players and colleagues as director and for making the union <b>more</b> <b>professional</b> despite the resentment of some players who found his leadership style to be too controlling. Smith's contract was renewed for an additional three years in March 2012. He was elected for a third term in March 2015. The major issue of Smith's tenure has been the 2011 lockout; former offensive lineman Chester Pitts praised Smith for fiercely fighting for the players' rights during negotiations.|$|E
5|$|Initial {{candidates}} {{to host the}} program included Soupy Sales, host of children's variety shows in the 1950s and 1960s, and comedian Dana Carvey. After Nickelodeon determined Sales to be too old for the role, and Carvey was offered a chance to audition for Saturday Night Live, {{the search for a}} host continued. Producers viewed over 1,000 applicants from Los Angeles and New York. First attending a tryout in lieu of a friend, and later passing multiple auditions, television warm-up comedian Marc Summers was one of two finalists advancing to a final audition. Each hosted a mock game for Nickelodeon to make an ultimate decision on who would host Double Dare. The producers felt the way Summers ended the game by leading into a commercial break was <b>more</b> <b>professional</b> and he was hired for the position {{in the first week of}} September 1986. Because focus groups showed that the audience thought he was more than 10 years younger than he actually was, Summers was obligated by Nickelodeon for years to not mention his age publicly.|$|E

5|$|Raonic {{was born}} on December 27, 1990, in Titograd, SFR Yugoslavia (now Podgorica, Montenegro), and is of Serb heritage. Prompted by the {{political}} unrest in the Balkans, and seeking <b>more</b> <b>professional</b> opportunities, {{his family moved to}} Canada in 1994 when he was three, settling in Brampton, Ontario. His parents are both engineers; his father, Dušan, holds a Ph.D. in electrical engineering, while his mother, Vesna, has degrees in mechanical and computer engineering, including a master's. He has two siblings, both significantly older: his sister, Jelena, has a master's degree in international trade and finance and is eleven years older, while his brother, Momir, has a degree in information technology and business and is nine years older. Raonic's uncle, Branimir Gvozdenović, is a politician in the Government of Montenegro, where he has served as Deputy Prime Minister. Raonic is fluent in Serbian and English.|$|E
5|$|Saavedra {{began to}} lose {{political}} power from this point. The decree of Mariano Moreno that changed the military promotions, which was never derogated, began to bear fruit, even if Moreno {{was not in the}} Junta anymore. The army became <b>more</b> <b>professional,</b> and less based on militias. Many of the new military authorities opposed Saavedra. The political crisis increased with the unfavourable military outcomes of the war: Belgrano was defeated at the Paraguay campaign, Castelli at the Upper Peru campaign, and the capture of Montevideo became increasingly difficult with the intervention of Portuguese troops supporting it. The many members of the Junta made the internal work difficult, as all measures were discussed by all members, hindering the swift reactions needed by the war. Saavedra left Buenos Aires at this point, and headed to the Upper Peru, to take command of the Army of the North. He thought that he could be of greater help as a military leader than facing the political struggles of Buenos Aires.|$|E
5|$|The {{music for}} the game was {{composed}} by Alexander Brandon and Todd Simmons; Brandon had previously worked on the original game. Brandon's guidance when composing the music for Invisible War was the sparse musical style of the Thief series, shifting away from the style used for the original game. The voice acting style also underwent changes, with the aim being for <b>more</b> <b>professional</b> performances. The improved voice acting was attributed to the team being given a larger budget. The soundtrack included six tracks from the album Trickster by industrial rock band Kidneythieves; the band's lead singer Free Dominguez provided voice work for the idol character NG Resonance. Dominguez described the experience of recording her voice work being fun.|$|E
