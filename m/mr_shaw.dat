5|$|These {{sessions}} {{of the legislature}} designated Oregon City as the official capital and introduced income and property taxes that replaced an 1843 subscription program used to finance the government's activities. Other business included a ban on hard liquor, the incorporation of Oregon City, approval for the Barlow Road around Mount Hood, incorporation of the Multnomah Circulating Library, and incorporation of the Oregon Institute. At the meetings John E. Long served as the recorder, Frederick Prigg as the clerk, a <b>Mr.</b> <b>Shaw</b> as the sergeant at arms, and two people as chaplains.|$|E
25|$|Newcome and {{his friend}} Adam Martindale were among the Presbyterian ministers who knew of the {{preparations}} for Booth's Rebellion of August 1659 {{and it seems that}} there was a wide circle of supporters among the ministers, although no specific evidence of Fisher's position. Although Fisher's patron played an initially farcical role in the events that brought about the Restoration of the monarchy, he was the first chosen of the MPs deputed to carry the Convention Parliament's response to the Declaration of Breda to Charles II. Despite all the hopes of a Presbyterian establishment, Fisher and Edgley were turned out of Thornton in the Great Ejection of 1662. The living was taken by a <b>Mr</b> <b>Shaw,</b> who had been Booth's chaplain but decided to conform to the Act of Uniformity 1662.|$|E
500|$|Shaw's {{first major}} work to appear {{after the war}} was Heartbreak House, written in 1916–17 and {{performed}} in 1920. It was produced on Broadway in November, and was coolly received; according to The Times: [...] "Mr Shaw on this occasion has more than usual to say and takes {{twice as long as}} usual to say it". After the London premiere in October 1921 The Times concurred with the American critics: [...] "As usual with <b>Mr</b> <b>Shaw,</b> the play is about an hour too long", although containing [...] "much entertainment and some profitable reflection". Ervine in The Observer thought the play brilliant but ponderously acted, except for Edith Evans as Lady Utterword.|$|E

6000|$|If then, I repeat, {{there is}} to be mental advance, it must be mental advance in the {{construction}} of a definite philosophy of life. And that philosophy of life must be right and the other philosophies wrong. Now of all, or nearly all, the able modern writers whom I have briefly studied in this book, this is especially and pleasingly true, that they do each of them have a constructive and affirmative view, and that they do take it seriously and ask us to take it seriously. There is nothing merely sceptically progressive about Mr. Rudyard Kipling. There is nothing in the least broad minded about Mr. Bernard Shaw. The paganism of Mr. Lowes Dickinson is more grave than any Christianity. Even the opportunism of Mr. H. G. Wells is more dogmatic than the idealism of anybody else. Somebody complained, I think, to Matthew Arnold that he was getting as dogmatic as Carlyle. He replied, [...] "That may be true; but you overlook an obvious difference. I am dogmatic and right, and Carlyle is dogmatic and wrong." [...] The strong humour of the remark ought not to disguise from us its everlasting seriousness and common sense; no man ought to write at all, or even to speak at all, unless he thinks that he is in truth and the other man in error. In similar style, I hold that I am dogmatic and right, while <b>Mr.</b> <b>Shaw</b> is dogmatic and wrong. But my main point, at present, is to notice that the chief among these writers I have discussed do most sanely and courageously offer themselves as dogmatists, as founders of a system. It may be true that the thing in <b>Mr.</b> <b>Shaw</b> most interesting to me, is the fact that <b>Mr.</b> <b>Shaw</b> is wrong. But it is equally true that the thing in <b>Mr.</b> <b>Shaw</b> most interesting to himself, is the fact that <b>Mr.</b> <b>Shaw</b> is right. <b>Mr.</b> <b>Shaw</b> may have none with him but himself; but it is not for himself he cares. It is for the vast and universal church, of which he is the only member.|$|E
60|$|I am, indeed, {{delighted to}} {{discover}} that Mr. McCabe reckons <b>Mr.</b> <b>Shaw</b> along with me in his system of condemnation of frivolity. He said once, I believe, that he always wanted <b>Mr.</b> <b>Shaw</b> to label his paragraphs serious or comic. I do not know which paragraphs of <b>Mr.</b> <b>Shaw</b> are paragraphs to be labelled serious; but surely {{there can be no}} doubt that this paragraph of Mr. McCabe's is one to be labelled comic. He also says, in the article I am now discussing, that <b>Mr.</b> <b>Shaw</b> has the reputation of deliberately saying everything which his hearers do not expect him to say. I need not labour the inconclusiveness and weakness of this, because it has already been dealt with in my remarks on Mr. Bernard Shaw. Suffice it to say here that the only serious reason which I can imagine inducing any one person to listen to any other is, that the first person looks to the second person with an ardent faith and a fixed attention, expecting him to say what he does not expect him to say. It may be a paradox, but that is because paradoxes are true. It may not be rational, but that is because rationalism is wrong. But clearly it is quite true that whenever we go to hear a prophet or teacher we may or may not expect wit, we may or may not expect eloquence, but we do expect what we do not expect. We may not expect the true, we may not even expect the wise, but we do expect the unexpected. If we do not expect the unexpected, why do we go there at all? If we expect the expected, why do we not sit at home and expect it by ourselves? If Mr. McCabe means merely this about <b>Mr.</b> <b>Shaw,</b> that he always has some unexpected application of his doctrine to give to those who listen to him, what he says is quite true, and to say it is only to say that <b>Mr.</b> <b>Shaw</b> is an original man. But if he means that <b>Mr.</b> <b>Shaw</b> has ever professed or preached any doctrine but one, and that his own, then what he says is not true. It is not my business to defend Mr. Shaw; as has been seen already, I disagree with him altogether. But I do not mind, on his behalf offering in this matter a flat defiance to all his ordinary opponents, such as Mr. McCabe. I defy Mr. McCabe, or anybody else, to mention one single instance in which <b>Mr.</b> <b>Shaw</b> has, for the sake of wit or novelty, taken up any position which was not directly deducible from the body of his doctrine as elsewhere expressed. I have been, I am happy to say, a tolerably close student of Mr. Shaw's utterances, and I request Mr. McCabe, if he will not believe that I mean anything else, to believe that I mean this challenge.|$|E

6000|$|... "We 'll get her somehow. The {{little room}} will cost something, {{and she can}} stay with us {{just as well as}} not, even if she does teach. Tell her I say so," [...] said <b>Mr.</b> <b>Shaw.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, dear, {{you are all}} I could ask," [...] and <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Shaw</b> {{looked up}} at him with such affection and {{confidence}} in her eyes, that Polly gave Tom the first approving look she had vouchsafed him since she came.|$|R
