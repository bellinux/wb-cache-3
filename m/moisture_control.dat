500|$|In May 1991, the Connecticut Historic Bridge Inventory plan {{outlined}} {{a plan for}} the preservation of the Samson Occom Bridge. It is unlikely that traffic would require replacement or modification of the bridge in the foreseeable future. According to a 2011 Connecticut Department of Transportation report, the bridge carries 1,100 vehicles per day. The biggest threat to the bridge is <b>moisture</b> <b>control</b> and the repair of eroded surfaces. Stone arch bridges rarely require structural rehabilitation, but an alternative solution to structural rehabilitation would be to use concrete slab imbedded above the arch, only requiring raising the roadway. The report stated that the [...] "rustic quality" [...] of the bridge is not compatible with roadways larger than two lanes, but that additional width could be facilitated without compromising its historical significance.|$|E

40|$|During {{the past}} 50 years, {{a wide variety}} of {{chemical}} compounds have been placed in the 149 single-shell tanks (SSTS) on the Hanford Site. A concern relating to chemical stability, chemical control, and safe storage of the waste is the potential for propagating reactions as a result of ferrocyanide-oxidizer and organic-oxidizer concentrations in the SSTS. Propagating reactions in fuel-nitrate mixtures are precluded if the amounts of fuel and moisture present in the waste are within specified limits. Because most credible ignition sources occur near the waste surface, the main emphasis of this study is toward monitoring and <b>controlling</b> <b>moisture</b> in the top 14 cm (5. 5 in.) of waste. The purpose of this engineering study is to recommend a <b>moisture</b> monitoring and <b>control</b> system for use in SSTs containing sludge and saltcake.

Drip irrigation can be much more efficient than sprinkler irrigation since only the root zone of the cropped area is irrigated. However, improper irrigation management can lead to wasted water and leaching of soluble chemicals such as nitrate.

Three nitrogen rates (80 %, 100 %, and 150 % of the recommended rate) and several irrigation treatments were imposed on drip irrigated tomato and pepper.

40|$|Precompression {{stress is}} an {{important}} property for assessment of tropical soil structure sustainability and is often determined in laboratory tests. The objective {{of this study was}} to compare the load bearing capacity models obtained with <b>controlled</b> <b>moisture</b> in laboratory and those obtained with natural field moistures determined a long one year. The evaluation of soil structural sustainability follows four distinct steps: soil sampling in the field, uniaxial compression test of the samples in the laboratory, determination of precompression stress and estimation of the load bearing capacity models. Laboratory estimates of precompression stress were obtained from <b>moisture</b> <b>controlled</b> in laboratory and from natural moisture determined in a field a long one year. In this process, the soil samples were saturated by capillarity with distilled water in laboratory, and after 48 hours, the samples were air dried to obtain the different moisture contents. Then, the precompression stress was determined for this both conditions. To verify if the load bearing capacity models obtained with <b>controlled</b> <b>moisture</b> in laboratory may represent the load bearing models obtained with natural field moisture, these models were compared using the homogeneity test procedure. It was observed that 75 % of field models analyzed were similar to the laboratory models. Thus, due to the similarity on the load-bearing capacity models obtained using natural (field) or <b>controlled</b> (laboratory) <b>moisture</b> contents, the assessment of the soil structure sustainability can be done using both methods...|$|R
