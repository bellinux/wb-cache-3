50|$|Although {{there is}} no general law {{prescribing}} formalities for <b>powers</b> <b>of</b> <b>attorney,</b> there are requirements for <b>powers</b> <b>of</b> <b>attorney</b> for certain specific purposes. For example, if the <b>power</b> <b>of</b> <b>attorney</b> {{is to be used}} in a deeds registry, it must be attested either by two witnesses above the age of fourteen years and competent to give evidence in a court of law, or by a magistrate, justice of the peace, commissioner of oaths or notary public, but no person who derives any benefit under such <b>power</b> <b>of</b> <b>attorney</b> may attest it. A <b>power</b> <b>of</b> <b>attorney,</b> whether special or general, is no longer subject to stamp duty. General <b>powers</b> <b>of</b> <b>attorney,</b> and also <b>powers</b> <b>of</b> <b>attorney</b> to carry out a series of acts or transactions, may be registered in the Deeds Registry.|$|R
5000|$|... ==Types== A <b>power</b> <b>of</b> <b>attorney</b> may be: special (also called limited), general, or temporary. A special <b>power</b> <b>of</b> <b>attorney</b> is {{one that}} is limited to a {{specified}} act or type of act. A general <b>power</b> <b>of</b> <b>attorney</b> {{is one that}} allows the agent to make all personal and business decisions A temporary <b>power</b> <b>of</b> <b>attorney</b> is one with a limited time frame. If ever required, a durable <b>power</b> <b>of</b> <b>attorney</b> can be revoked or changed as long as the principal is still mentally competent to act.|$|R
50|$|Standardized {{forms are}} {{available}} for various kinds <b>of</b> <b>powers</b> <b>of</b> <b>attorney,</b> and many organizations provide them for their clients, customers, patients, employees, or members. However, the grantor should exercise caution when using a standardized POA form obtained from a source other than a lawyer because there is considerable variation in approved formats among the states. In some states statutory <b>power</b> <b>of</b> <b>attorney</b> forms are available. Examples include the California Statutory Form <b>Power</b> <b>of</b> <b>Attorney,</b> New York Form <b>Power</b> <b>of</b> <b>Attorney</b> and Wisconsin Form <b>Power</b> <b>of</b> <b>Attorney.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{relevant}} {{legislation is}} the <b>Powers</b> <b>of</b> <b>Attorney</b> Act 1996 and the Enduring <b>Powers</b> <b>of</b> <b>Attorney</b> Regulations 1996 (SI No. 196/1996) {{as amended by}} SI No. 287/1996. Part 7 of the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015 provides for new arrangements for {{those who wish to}} make an Enduring <b>Power</b> <b>of</b> <b>Attorney</b> and once the 2015 act is commenced, no new <b>powers</b> <b>of</b> <b>attorney</b> will be created under the 1996 act.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the paper}} {{is an attempt to}} {{determine}} the legal nature of establishing a proxy, or giving a <b>power</b> <b>of</b> <b>attorney,</b> and in particular to identify the recipient <b>of</b> the <b>power</b> <b>of</b> <b>attorney</b> granted by way of a statement of will of the person establishing a proxy. Further, the role of a proxy in the creation <b>of</b> an effective <b>power</b> <b>of</b> <b>attorney</b> is analyzed. Issues such as the form, contents, legal effects <b>of</b> a <b>power</b> <b>of</b> <b>attorney</b> granted, or its active or passive legitimization are not discussed. In the author's opinion, the granting <b>of</b> a <b>power</b> <b>of</b> <b>attorney</b> is a one-sided legal act the effects of which exist independently of the internal relations between the person establishing a proxy and the person to whom a <b>power</b> <b>of</b> <b>attorney</b> is given. A statement of will of the person establishing a proxy is made in favour of the person receiving the <b>power</b> <b>of</b> <b>attorney</b> <b>of</b> which he is only recipient. Accepting the granted <b>power</b> <b>of</b> <b>attorney</b> is an intrinsic element of the proxy being established and effective. Such an acceptance consists in an inclusion in the statement of will of the person establishing a proxy of the consent of the recipient of the proxy to receive the <b>power</b> <b>of</b> <b>attorney</b> so given. Such a statement, however, {{does not need to be}} specifically addressed and submitted, and may take a form the proxy so established commencing to exercise the granted <b>powers</b> <b>of</b> <b>attorney...</b>|$|R

40|$|This article {{addresses}} the durable general <b>power</b> <b>of</b> <b>attorney,</b> tracing its evolution from general principles of agency law {{to the new}} Uniform <b>Power</b> <b>of</b> <b>Attorney</b> Act. The author also discusses the utility <b>of</b> the <b>power</b> <b>of</b> <b>attorney</b> {{as a tool to}} assist a senior who wishes to avail themselves of the services of an agent. From this perspective, the author addresses fiduciary duty and fiduciary liability, common problems with the <b>power</b> <b>of</b> <b>attorney,</b> and proposed methods of dealing with such problems...|$|R
50|$|In Portuguese law, Electronic <b>power</b> <b>of</b> <b>attorney</b> allows {{someone to}} provide a proxy or a civil {{representative}} with the necessary powers, granted by electronic means and using the technology in place and the Cartão de Cidadão (literally Citizen's Card). This <b>power</b> <b>of</b> <b>attorney</b> has the same legal value as the traditional paper <b>power</b> <b>of</b> <b>attorney</b> and is duly hand-signed.|$|R
50|$|Under Russian law, {{specifically}} art. 185 of the Russian Civil Code, a <b>power</b> <b>of</b> <b>attorney</b> may {{be executed}} under hand or in notarial form. The <b>power</b> <b>of</b> <b>attorney</b> to act must be notarially executed. Notarial execution {{is required for}} any <b>power</b> <b>of</b> <b>attorney</b> made for concluding a contract subject to special public recordation, namely those dealing with interests in immovable property.|$|R
50|$|In English and Welsh law, {{anyone with}} {{capacity}} can grant a <b>power</b> <b>of</b> <b>attorney.</b> These can be general (i.e., {{to do anything}} which can legally be done by an attorney), or relate to a specific act (e.g., to sell freehold property). A <b>power</b> <b>of</b> <b>attorney</b> is only valid while the donor {{has the capacity to}} ratify the attorney's actions, unless it is made in the form <b>of</b> a lasting <b>power</b> <b>of</b> <b>attorney</b> and registered with the Office of the Public Guardian. This new form <b>of</b> <b>power</b> <b>of</b> <b>attorney</b> was introduced in 2007 under the Mental Capacity Act 2005 and replaced the former enduring <b>power</b> <b>of</b> <b>attorney,</b> although EPAs correctly made before the law changed are still valid. EPAs only need to be registered if the donor has since lost capacity.|$|R

5000|$|Under {{the common}} law, a <b>power</b> <b>of</b> <b>attorney</b> becomes {{ineffective}} if its grantor dies or becomes [...] "incapacitated," [...] meaning unable to grant such a <b>power,</b> because <b>of</b> physical injury or mental illness, for example, unless the grantor (or principal) specifies that the <b>power</b> <b>of</b> <b>attorney</b> {{will continue to}} be effective even if the grantor becomes incapacitated. This type <b>of</b> <b>power</b> <b>of</b> <b>attorney</b> is called [...] "power <b>of</b> <b>attorney</b> with durable provisions" [...] in the United States or [...] "enduring <b>power</b> <b>of</b> attorney" [...] elsewhere. In effect, under a durable <b>power</b> <b>of</b> <b>attorney</b> (DPA), the authority of the attorney-in-fact to act and/or make decisions on behalf of the grantor continues until the grantor's death.|$|R
50|$|Since the <b>power</b> <b>of</b> <b>attorney</b> readily and {{conveniently}} furnishes {{proof of}} an agent’s authority, banking and financial institutions, and businesspersons generally, usually require agents to exhibit <b>powers</b> <b>of</b> <b>attorney</b> before entering into transactions with them.|$|R
5000|$|Robert's Rules of Order {{notes that}} proxy voting {{involves}} granting a <b>power</b> <b>of</b> <b>attorney.</b> The term [...] "proxy" [...] refers {{to both the}} <b>power</b> <b>of</b> <b>attorney</b> itself and the person to whom it is granted.|$|R
5000|$|Formerly, {{the term}} [...] "power" [...] {{referred}} to an instrument signed under seal while a [...] "letter" [...] was an instrument under hand, {{meaning that it}} was simply signed by the parties, but today a <b>power</b> <b>of</b> <b>attorney</b> need not be signed under seal. Some jurisdictions require that <b>powers</b> <b>of</b> <b>attorney</b> be notarized or witnessed, but others will enforce a <b>power</b> <b>of</b> <b>attorney</b> {{as long as it}} is signed by the grantor.|$|R
50|$|The {{person who}} creates a <b>power</b> <b>of</b> <b>attorney,</b> {{known as the}} grantor, {{can only do so}} when he/she has the {{requisite}} mental capacity. Suppose the grantor loses capacity to grant permission after the <b>power</b> <b>of</b> <b>attorney</b> has been created (for example, from Alzheimer's disease or a head injury in a car crash); then the power will probably no longer be effective. In some <b>powers</b> <b>of</b> <b>attorney</b> the grantor states that he/she wishes the document to remain in effect even after he/she becomes incapacitated. This type <b>of</b> <b>power</b> is commonly referred to as a durable <b>power</b> <b>of</b> <b>attorney.</b> If someone is already incapacitated, it is not possible for that person to execute a valid power. If a person does not have the capacity to execute a <b>power</b> <b>of</b> <b>attorney</b> (and does not already have a durable power in place), often the only way for another party to act on their behalf is to have a court impose a conservatorship or a guardianship.|$|R
40|$|The recent {{decision}} of the Queensland Civil and Administrative Tribunal (QCAT) in Guardianship and administration application {{in the matter of}} MDC [2014] QCAT 338, provides an important ruling on the limits of who can be appointed as an enduring <b>power</b> <b>of</b> <b>attorney</b> under the <b>Powers</b> <b>of</b> <b>Attorney</b> Act 1998 (Qld). In particular, the tribunal adopted a broad interpretation of the term "health provider" when considering the limits on who can be appointed as an enduring <b>power</b> <b>of</b> <b>attorney</b> under the legislation [...] ...|$|R
50|$|Unless the <b>power</b> <b>of</b> <b>attorney</b> {{has been}} made {{irrevocable}} by its own terms or by some legal principle, the grantor may revoke the <b>power</b> <b>of</b> <b>attorney</b> by telling the attorney-in-fact it is revoked. However, if the principal does not inform third parties and it is reasonable for the third parties to rely upon the <b>power</b> <b>of</b> <b>attorney</b> being in force, the principal might still be bound by the acts of the agent, though the agent may also be liable for such unauthorized acts.|$|R

50|$|Depending on the jurisdiction, a <b>power</b> <b>of</b> <b>attorney</b> may be oral and, whether witnessed, {{will hold}} up in court, {{the same as}} if it were in writing. For some purposes, the law {{requires}} a <b>power</b> <b>of</b> <b>attorney</b> to be in writing. Many institutions, such as hospitals, banks and, in the United States, the Internal Revenue Service, require a <b>power</b> <b>of</b> <b>attorney</b> to be in writing before they will honor it, and they will usually keep a duplicate original or a copy for their records. Nursing homes often follow the same practice.|$|R

40|$|This change project {{focused on}} {{increasing}} the awareness and understanding <b>of</b> the Enduring <b>Power</b> <b>of</b> <b>Attorney</b> among members <b>of</b> a regional Mental Health Team, patients and carers. In 2011, 1405 Wardship orders, a provision under the outdated Lunacy Regulations Ireland Act, 1871, were signed in Ireland {{as opposed to}} 440 appointed Enduring <b>Powers</b> <b>of</b> <b>Attorney,</b> under Irish <b>Power</b> <b>of</b> <b>Attorney</b> Act 1996. This suggests a probable lack of awareness or understanding and uptake of the provisions for advance care instructions. A pre-audit revealed {{less than half of}} a selected population of the Psychiatry of Old Age patients were aware <b>of</b> the Enduring <b>Power</b> <b>of</b> <b>Attorney.</b> The project entailed developing guidelines for implementing discussions on the Enduring <b>Power</b> <b>of</b> <b>Attorney,</b> developing an information booklet on the Enduring <b>Power</b> <b>of</b> <b>Attorney,</b> facilitating training and information sessions and incorporating measures for regular reviews of the implementation into existent organisational structures. Kotter’s eight step change model was utilised to guide the change process implementation. Also, SWOT analysis was integrated prior to, during and after the implementation of the change process. The change objectives were attained, as evidenced by the development of information booklet, and approval of standard guidelines for Enduring <b>power</b> <b>of</b> <b>attorney</b> discussions with inclusion and exclusion criteria. Increased EPA awareness was demonstrated by staff, and patients and carers feedbacks. Also, most staff felt confident or supported after change was implemented.

40|$|Based on the Instruction of the Internal Affairs Minister No. 14 / 1982 on the Prohibition to use Irrevocable <b>Power</b> <b>of</b> <b>Attorney</b> as the Transfer on Land Rights on March 6, 1982, {{there was}} a {{prohibited}} <b>Power</b> <b>of</b> <b>Attorney</b> in which it contained the element {{which could not be}} withdrawn by the principal since it is the transfer of land rights. In its development, the Instruction of the Internal Affairs Minister was changed: the Decree of the Agrarian Director General, on behalf of the Internal Affairs Minister No. 594 / 1492 /AGR regulates the use irrevocable <b>power</b> <b>of</b> <b>attorney,</b> not as prohibited irrevocable power attorney as stipulated in sales certificate, sales agreement, and APHT.). Deviation in irrevocable <b>power</b> <b>of</b> <b>attorney</b> occurred after being revised on March 30, 1982; if it was not revised or rectified, the land would returned to the heir when the seller died, and it would be chaos because the buyer was harmed financially. Therefore, the Circular Letter of the Directorate of Agrarian Affairs No. 594 / 1492 /AGR on March 30, 1982 has been amended by the Government. The legal domicile of the parties concerned in the irrevocable <b>power</b> <b>of</b> <b>attorney</b> can actually be implemented provided that it is united with purchase agreement.
