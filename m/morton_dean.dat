5000|$|The Trees Community was an Episcopal Church-affiliated Christian {{community}} and a music group. They were also known simply as The Trees, and originally as [...] "The Symphony of Souls." [...] They were at first a disparate set of unlikely young acquaintances that bonded {{in a sense of}} common brokenness that permeated young {{men and women in the}} United States at the time, and that resulted in a wide-ranging [...] "search for Truth". From this simple beginning in a loft in Manhattan in 1970, the group evolved into a community with a formal, religious order. Based at The Cathedral Church of Saint John the Divine in New York City, they worked closely with James Parks <b>Morton</b> who was <b>Dean</b> of the cathedral at the time they were artists in residence there. Canon Edward Nason West, upon whom novelist Madeleine L'Engle based the fictional character Canon Tallis, was their spiritual advisor. The group was mentioned in an article on <b>Dean</b> <b>Morton</b> in Time magazine: [...] Morton is pleased that at least one group of young people has chosen the cathedral as the base for one of those alternatives: a religious community. The five men and three women, ranging in age from 20 to 30, went through a virtual catalogue of religious experiences before undergoing their Christian conversions. Now known as the Trees Group, they live in an apartment near the church, regularly give concerts at the cathedral and also perform tasks like guiding cathedral visitors. This fall they will take preliminary vows of poverty, chastity and obedience.|$|R

In 1979 the then bishop, the Right Reverend Paul Moore, Jr., decided that construction should be continued, in part to preserve the crafts of stonemasonry by training neighborhood youths, thus providing them with a valuable skill. In 1979, Mayor Ed Koch quipped during the dedication ceremony, [...] "I am told that some of the great cathedrals took over five hundred years to build. But I would like to remind you that we are only in our first hundred years." ...|$|R

50|$|In January 1985, Holbrook's duties {{were reduced}} to the 7:30 PM local {{newscast}} on WPIX and he was replaced on the national INN broadcast and the 10:30 PM local newscast by veteran CBS News correspondent <b>Morton</b> <b>Dean.</b> Four months later Pat Harper left WPIX after over a decade to take over for John Hambrick as Chuck Scarborough's co-anchor on WNBC's 6:00 PM newscast, necessitating replacements for her on all three of WPIX's news productions; on the national broadcast, former WBAL-TV anchor Sheila Stainback {{was brought in to}} be Dean's new co-anchor.|$|E
50|$|In January 1987, the {{national}} INN newscast was renamed USA Tonight and kept that {{name for the}} remainder of its run (WPIX, in turn, renamed the local broadcast that followed to New York Tonight).

He took the elevator down, then he took it right back up again and said, [...] "I'd like to try to be a clown. Dean performs occasionally as a Ringling clown. [...] "It's my Walter Mitty side," [...] he told an interviewer.|$|E
5000|$|Upon leaving WNEW, Jorgensen {{initially}} co-anchored Action News with Pat Harper on WPIX. In June 1980, {{days after}} Ted Turner began the Cable News Network, WPIX began producing Independent Network News, a prime time national newscast that ran throughout the United States on small independent television stations. The Miami Herald described Independent Network News as a half-hour program {{of national and}} international news as well as brief sports and weather segments, offered to participating stations during prime time, and therefore not in direct competition with the networks' evening newscasts. [...] Jorgensen anchored both a 10:00 national newscast and a 10:30 local newscast on WPIX with Steve Bosh and Pat Harper. Tribune Broadcasting hired <b>Morton</b> <b>Dean</b> to replace the three anchors in 1985 and rebranded the program as USA Tonight.|$|E

Those hundreds of others included ABC News personalities stationed {{around the world to}} cover the new year in every time zone, including Elizabeth Vargas in Sydney, Australia, Cokie Roberts at the Vatican, with her mother, the then U.S. Ambassador to the Vatican, Carole Simpson in Chicago, and Bob Brown, who narrated many segments consolidating the day's events. Local stations also featured their own coverage during time local breaks, which varied from traditional breaks for local news and weather to full-scale coverage of local countdowns and possible Y2K bug effects (which in ABC and local coverage, eventually became minimal as little to any issues came out of that).|$|E
