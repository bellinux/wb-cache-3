25|$|Rhode Island's {{taxes were}} appreciably higher than {{neighboring}} states, because Rhode Island's income tax {{was based on}} 25% of the payer's federal income tax payment. Former Governor Donald Carcieri claimed that the higher tax rate had an inhibitory effect on business growth {{in the state and}} called for reductions to increase the competitiveness of the state's business environment. In 2010, the Rhode Island General Assembly passed a new state income tax structure that was then signed into law on June 9, 2010 by Governor Carcieri. The income tax overhaul has now made Rhode Island competitive with other New England states by lowering its <b>maximum</b> <b>tax</b> rate to 5.99% and reducing the number of tax brackets to three. The state's first income tax was enacted in 1971.|$|E

500|$|Under {{the latest}} {{taxation}} system, introduced by former governor Sarah Palin in 2007 and {{passed by the}} Alaska Legislature that year, the <b>maximum</b> <b>tax</b> rate on profits is 50 percent. The rate fluctuates based {{on the cost of}} oil, with lower prices incurring lower tax rates. The state also claims 12.5 percent of all oil produced in the state. This [...] "royalty oil" [...] is not taxed but is sold back to the oil companies, generating additional revenue. At a local level, the pipeline owners pay property taxes on the portions of the pipeline and the pipeline facilities that lay within districts that impose a property tax. This property tax is based on the pipeline's value (as assessed by the state) and the local property tax rate. In the Fairbanks North Star Borough, for example, pipeline owners paid $9.2 million in property taxes—approximately 10 percent of all property taxes paid in the borough.|$|E

2500|$|Among other provisions, the act {{accelerated}} certain tax changes {{passed in}} the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001, increased the exemption amount for the individual Alternative Minimum Tax, and lowered taxes of income from dividends and capital gains. JGTRRA continued on the precedent established by the 2001 EGTRRA, while increasing tax reductions on investment income from dividends and capital gains. JGTRRA accelerated the gradual rate reduction and increase in credits passed in EGTRRA. The <b>maximum</b> <b>tax</b> rate decreases originally scheduled to be phased into effect in 2006 under EGTRRA were retroactively enacted {{to apply to the}} 2003 tax year. Also, the child tax credit was increased to what would have been the 2010 level, and [...] "marriage penalty" [...] relief was accelerated to 2009 levels. In addition, the threshold at which the alternative minimum tax applies was also increased. JGTRRA increased both the percentage rate at which items can be depreciated and the amount a taxpayer may choose to expense under Section 179, allowing them to deduct the full cost of the item from their income without having to depreciate the amount.|$|E
2500|$|The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics {{reports that}} a {{comparison}} of academic studies yields a range of revenue maximizing rates that centers around 70%. In the early 1980s, Edgar L. Feige and Robert T. McGee developed a macroeconomic model from which they derived a Laffer Curve. According to the model, the shape and position of the Laffer Curve depend upon the strength of supply side effects, the progressivity of the tax system {{and the size of}} the unobserved economy. [...] Economist Paul Pecorino presented a model in 1995 that predicted the peak of the Laffer curve occurred at tax rates around 65%. A draft paper by Y. Hsing looking at the United States economy between 1959 and 1991 placed the revenue-maximizing average federal tax rate between 32.67% and 35.21%. A 1981 article published in the Journal of Political Economy presented a model integrating empirical data that indicated that the point of <b>maximum</b> <b>tax</b> revenue in Sweden in the 1970s would have been 70%. A 2011 paper by Trabandt and Uhlig published in the Journal of Monetary Economics presented a model that predicted that the US and most European economies were on the left of the Laffer curve (in other words, that raising taxes would raise further revenue).|$|E

40|$|The {{effective}} {{income tax}} function is useful and practical methodology {{to analyze the}} relationship between income and tax amounts. It includes the measures of <b>tax</b> progressivity, the <b>maximum</b> effective <b>tax</b> rate, and horizontal inequity. We statistically estimated the effective income tax function using the seven countries out of LIS datasets and Korean data. We also estimated the R-S index and the Kakwani index so as to test the consistency among these indexes. Our empirical results give us several implications. Four different indexes of tax progressivity reflect different aspects about the progressivity, implying that it requires policy planners to evaluate the income tax system with alternatives.

2500|$|Reagan {{significantly}} increased public expenditures, primarily the Department of Defense, which rose (in constant 2000 dollars) from $267.1 billion in 1980 (4.9% of GDP and 22.7% of public expenditure) to $393.1 billion in 1988 (5.8% of GDP and 27.3% of public expenditure); {{most of those}} years military spending was about 6% of GDP, exceeding this number in 4 different years. Those numbers had not been seen {{since the end of}} U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War in 1973. In 1981, Reagan significantly reduced the <b>maximum</b> <b>tax</b> rate, which affected the highest income earners, and lowered the top marginal tax rate from 70% to 50%; in 1986 he further reduced the rate to 28%. The federal deficit under Reagan peaked at 6% of GDP in 1983, falling to 3.2% of GDP in 1987 and to 3.1% of GDP in his final budget. The inflation-adjusted rate of growth in federal spending fell from 4% under Jimmy Carter to 2.5% under Ronald Reagan; however, federal deficit as percent of GDP was up throughout the Reagan presidency from 2.7% at the end of (and throughout) the Carter administration. As a short-run strategy to reduce inflation and lower nominal interest rates, the U.S. borrowed both domestically and abroad to cover the Federal budget deficits, raising the national debt from $997 billion to $2.85 trillion. This led to the U.S. moving from the world's largest international creditor to the world's largest debtor nation. Reagan described the new debt as the [...] "greatest disappointment" [...] of his presidency.|$|E
