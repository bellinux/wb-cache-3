5|$|The {{purchase}} must be <b>made</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> treaty, as {{in other}} cases. This insures publicity, and affords a protection against fraud. But the proviso does not require that the treaty should be one between the United States and the tribe from whom the purchase is made, as in the cases coming under the first clause of the section. It is sufficient if the purchase is <b>made</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> treaty held ‘under {{the authority of the}} United States,’ and in the ‘presence and with the approbation of the commissioner or commissioners of the United States,’ etc.|$|E
5|$|A Bulldog Drummond {{radio series}} {{ran on the}} Mutual Broadcasting System from 13 April 1941 to 12 January 1949. An attempt was <b>made</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> revival between 3 January and 28 March 1954. Drummond was {{initially}} portrayed by George Coulouris, before being taken over by Santos Ortega and Ned Wever after 1942; Cedric Hardwicke took over in 1954.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} the {{production}} was nearing completion, the trade sources had estimated the film to cost around 120–150 million; but, as often happens with films directed by Shankar, the budget was overshot. <b>Made</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> cost of 263.8 million, Anniyan was touted as the most expensive South Indian film to be ever made {{during the time of}} its release.|$|E

5|$|The {{area around}} Lulworth Cove {{contains}} a fossil forest, and 71 different rock strata {{have been identified}} at Lyme Regis, {{each with its own}} species of ammonite. The fossil collector Mary Anning lived here and her major discoveries of marine reptiles and other fossils were <b>made</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> time when the study of palaeontology was just starting to develop. The Charmouth Heritage Coast Centre provides information on the heritage coast, and the whole length of the site can be visited via the South West Coast Path.|$|E
5|$|In February 2008, Lazcano Lazcano sent Treviño Morales to kill rival {{drug traffickers}} and {{take control of}} the drug {{trafficking}} routes in Guatemala. Reportedly, he carried out a military-like ambush that resulted in the death of the Guatemalan drug lord Juan José León Ardón (alias Juancho) in March. An unnamed U.S. official said that Treviño Morales may have been the man who fired the bullet that killed the drug kingpin. Having succeeded outside of Mexico, Treviño Morales was appointed by Lazcano Lazcano as the national commander of Los Zetas, a position traditionally reserved to Zetas members with military background. In this position, Treviño Morales had a say in nearly all the decisions Los Zetas <b>made</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> national level, creating some resentment among the old-generation commanders of Los Zetas who, unlike him, had been in the Mexican Armed Forces before turning to the drug trade.|$|E

5|$|Only {{two years}} later the people of Fenton voted in favour of {{incorporation}} of the borough, while further meetings in Stoke and Burslem came out against incorporation but reiterated calls for {{the appointment of a}} stipendiary magistrate. Later the same year, a further call for better policing was <b>made</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> meeting chaired by the Duke of Sutherland. These calls were heard and in 1839 two acts of Parliament were passed, the Staffordshire Potteries Stipendiary Justice Act (2 & 3 Vict. c.15) and the Staffordshire Potteries Improvement and Police Act (2 & 3 Vict. c.xliv). This legislation created boards of commissioners with the same powers given to Hanley and Burslem by the 1825 acts. Following these amendments to local policing and justice, the discussion of co-operation and federation between the various townships was subdued for several decades.|$|E
5|$|The game spans six levels, each lasting {{about five}} minutes, {{with a variety}} of boss battles. Over the course of the game, the plot is {{revealed}} through cutscenes using the game's own graphic engine. Gameplay consists of a player controlling a flying dragon and his rider through an aiming reticle that can be moved over the whole screen with the D-pad; the player must shoot a variety of enemies (ranging from machines to monsters) in a 3D post-apocalyptic fantasy environment of barren landscapes and mysterious ruins of a fallen civilization. Progression through the levels is <b>made</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> predetermined pace, as the player is constantly set along a rail of gameplay. The only time the game pauses is during boss battles. The field of vision can be directed with the aiming reticle on the x and y-axis, but the overall direction of travel is predetermined. The dragon follows the reticle movements, allowing the player to avoid enemy projectiles and obstacles.|$|E
5|$|The {{length of}} the time step chosen within the model {{is related to the}} {{distance}} between the points on the computational grid, and is chosen to maintain numerical stability. Time steps for global models are on the order of tens of minutes, while time steps for regional models are between one and four minutes. The global models are run at varying times into the future. The Met Office's Unified Model is run six days into the future, the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts model is run out to 10days into the future, while the Global Forecast System model run by the Environmental Modeling Center is run 16days into the future. The visual output produced by a model solution is known as a prognostic chart, or prog. The raw output is often modified before being presented as the forecast. This can be in the form of statistical techniques to remove known biases in the model, or of adjustment to take into account consensus among other numerical weather forecasts. MOS or model output statistics is a technique used to interpret numerical model output and produce site-specific guidance. This guidance is presented in coded numerical form, and can be obtained for nearly all National Weather Service reporting stations in the United States. As proposed by Edward Lorenz in 1963, long range forecasts, those <b>made</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> range of two weeks or more, are impossible to definitively predict the state of the atmosphere, owing to the chaotic nature of the fluid dynamics equations involved. In numerical models, extremely small errors in initial values double roughly every five days for variables such as temperature and wind velocity.|$|E

25|$|Miter gauge: The table has {{one or two}} slots (grooves) {{running from}} front to back, also {{parallel}} to the cutting plane of the blade. These miter slots (or miter grooves) are used to position and guide either a miter gauge (also known as a crosscut fence) or crosscut sled. The miter gauge is usually set to be at 90 degrees to {{the plane of the}} blade's cut, to cause the cut made in the workpiece to be <b>made</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> right angle. The miter gauge can also be adjusted to cause the cut to be <b>made</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> precisely controlled angle (a so-called miter cut).|$|E
