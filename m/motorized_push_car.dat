50|$|<b>Push</b> <b>cars</b> were {{passenger}} and {{freight cars}} powered by human labor. The <b>push</b> <b>cars</b> operated on narrow gauge railways. On Taiwan, the gauge was 18 to 20 inches. The {{design of the}} <b>push</b> <b>cars</b> was simple; {{the foundation of the}} <b>push</b> <b>car</b> was a platform attached to railway wheels. Behind the platform were two raised poles, where <b>push</b> <b>car</b> operators could <b>push</b> the <b>car</b> along the railways. Passenger <b>push</b> <b>cars</b> could seat up to four people, although most passenger cars could only seat two. Freight <b>push</b> <b>cars</b> could carry up to 450 pounds.|$|R
50|$|Taiwanese <b>push</b> <b>car</b> {{railways}} (臺車) were {{a historic}} transportation system on Taiwan, based on Japan's daisha <b>push</b> <b>car</b> railways. After Taiwan was ceded to Japan, the <b>push</b> <b>car</b> system {{was brought to}} Taiwan. The <b>push</b> <b>car</b> railways were in general service from 1895 to the late 1940s. The <b>push</b> <b>cars</b> complemented the developing steam locomotive system on Taiwan.|$|R
50|$|The first <b>push</b> <b>car</b> line in Taiwan {{ran from}} Tainan to Kaohsiung; {{the line was}} {{completed}} in December 1895. The <b>push</b> <b>car</b> network ran across all of western, coastal Taiwan, running from Taipei to Kaohsiung. <b>Push</b> <b>car</b> lines were built across waterways and ran across inclined terrain. The <b>push</b> <b>car</b> system reached its peak during the late 1920s to mid-1930s. The <b>push</b> <b>cars</b> were gradually replaced by modern road systems that often ran parallel to the old <b>push</b> <b>car</b> railways.|$|R

50|$|To {{launch the}} trains, Storm Runner {{utilizes}} a system invented by Intamin that launches the trains using hydraulics. This system {{is similar to}} the propulsion on a locomotive wheel except it doesn't spin completely. The inner diameter of the wheel is attached to the hydraulic actuator and the outer radius of the wheel is then attached to the launch mechanism. The outer diameter of the wheel amplifies the energy output from the slow actuator stroke creating a high speed launch in a matter of seconds. A <b>pusher</b> <b>car</b> is attached to the launch mechanism and the train attaches to this <b>pusher</b> <b>car</b> prior to launch. Once the train reaches the end of the launch area, the <b>pusher</b> <b>car</b> disengages and gravity does the rest.|$|R

5000|$|Push It: Teams have {{to build}} a road along an {{obstacle}} course on the beach, by using 12 wooden planks underneath two cars — one car for each team, and each team has to designate one player to steer the car, while the remainder of the team <b>pushes</b> the <b>car</b> on the wooden planks, and move the wooden planks to the front in order to <b>push</b> the <b>car</b> through the obstacle course.

50|$|By late-1925, the {{railroad}} ceased operations for good, {{according to records}} at the Canadian County Historical society in El Reno. There are however a few post death stories of interest.

They would <b>push</b> the <b>cars</b> up the long grade to the Town Cemetery and then jump aboard for a wild ride back into town. Railroad inspectors were called out when it was learned that the railroad was moving carloads of wheat and farm products long after it was abandoned.
