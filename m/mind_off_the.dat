5|$|At soccer {{practice}} the next day, Brendon—still upset with his mother's decision to date his coach—is uncooperative and chastises McGuirk for dating his mother, {{accusing him of}} desires {{to engage in a}} relationship with all the soccer players' mothers. While being driven home by Erik, Brendon asks Erik to fight McGuirk as revenge, but Erik denies his request and suggests he take his <b>mind</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> topic by playing a car game. Eventually, Brendon decides to apologize to McGuirk for his behavior, and the two reconcile. Later, McGuirk and Paula decide over the phone to end their relationship, a decision Brendon overhears using three-way calling.|$|E
5|$|Marge {{figures out}} what Homer saw from the {{movements}} of his pupil. They decide not to tell Manjula but while they are playing Badminton Homer and Marge act awkwardly with Manjula and Apu looking at them, trying not to give out hints Apu cheated on Manjula. They then confront Apu {{and he says he}} will break up with the Squishee Lady named Annette. However, he breaks his promise (as it gets his <b>mind</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> octuplets and she forces him). Later, Manjula watches the surveillance footage of Apu cheating and kicks him out. To help get them together, Homer and Marge invite them both to dinner, but do not tell them that the other one is coming. After a failed attempt with Bart and Lisa, Apu tries to promise to Manjula that he will change, but Manjula refuses to listen and demands a divorce.|$|E
500|$|However, {{the film}} {{received}} several negative reviews. Richard Schickel of Time wrote that after [...] "a {{third of a}} century's hard use", Bond's conventions survived on [...] "wobbly knees", while in Entertainment Weekly, Owen Gleiberman thought the series had [...] "entered a near-terminal state of exhaustion." [...] Dragan Antulov said that GoldenEye had a predictable series of scenes, and Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times said that the film was [...] "a middle-aged entity anxious to appear trendy at all costs". David Eimer of Premiere wrote that [...] "the trademark humour is in short supply" [...] and that [...] "Goldeneye isn't classic Bond {{by any stretch of}} the imagination." [...] Madeleine Williams said that [...] "there are plenty of stunts and explosions to take your <b>mind</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> plot." ...|$|E

500|$|Former KMFDM member Raymond Watts, {{last seen}} {{contributing}} vocals, programming, and production to 1988's Don't Blow Your Top before starting his own band, Pig, called Konietzko {{and asked if}} he would be interested in working on a small musical collaboration. [...] Konietzko agreed, and Watts flew to Seattle, where the pair, along with Schulz, worked on an EP entitled Sin Sex & Salvation. [...] Konietzko said of the trio's working together, [...] "It was the breath of fresh air I had been hoping and waiting for. [...] This short project took my <b>mind</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> problems with the KMFDM album and gave me a welcome change of perspective." [...] Watts then stayed on with the group to begin work on Nihil, which featured a core group of Konietzko, Schulz, Watts, and Esch, along with some input from steel guitar specialist Durante and drummer Bill Rieflin.|$|E
2500|$|Hazard takes {{a fishing}} trip to take his <b>mind</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> problem, hoping that an idea will occur to him. [...] Remembering one of the {{chimpanzees}} used by his project trying to solve a simple puzzle, he decides {{that the whole thing}} is a gigantic experiment, a puzzle to be solved with some reward at the end. [...] He also realizes that a necessary part of the experiment is an observer, someone who can monitor it. [...] Such a person would want to get close to the time-travel project, and the best candidate is Gottwald himself, who came from Europe and never talks about his past.|$|E
2500|$|However, Payton {{became much}} less {{volatile}} {{in his later}} years, and many players, including Shaquille O'Neal and Antoine Walker, have greatly enjoyed playing with Payton. In Los Angeles, Boston, and Miami, he was recognized as a psychological leader and mentor {{for many of the}} younger players. Of his trash talking, Payton has stated [...] "I never take it too far...I just try to talk and get their <b>mind</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> game, and turn their attention on me", adding that [...] "sometimes I get accused of trash talking even though I'm not... immediately figure you're trash talking. But I could be talking to a guy about what's going on or asking about his family." [...] One of Payton's major beliefs is that [...] "mental toughness" [...] {{is as much a part}} of the game as on-court play. In addition, All-Star point guard Jason Kidd has referred to Payton as a [...] "mentor" [...] for the way he treated Kidd growing up in the same neighborhood of Oakland. [...] Payton has said that his own mental toughness was developed in his days learning to play basketball in Oakland: [...] "You learned that you can be friends before the game and after the game. But once the game starts, it's all about business. No jive." ...|$|E
50|$|The {{next three}} days are {{the start of the}} hundred days of games decreed by Titus to {{celebrate}} the new amphitheatre - and to take people's <b>minds</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> disastrous events of his reign thus far. For each day a programme of events is given: beginning with acrobats or dancers, then exotic beasts and the fancifully-staged execution of criminals, and in the afternoon the popular gladiatorial contests. The first day, the children are stuck on the top tier with the senator's family watching the displays at a distance, alternately fascinated and horrified at the drama, the ferocity, and the bloodshed.|$|R

5000|$|The Pocahontas tale is an American {{narrative}} {{that has been}} popularized at various points in time. As seen in the previously sourced examples, Pocahontas has often been publicized and romanticized {{at the same time}} that Indians have been viewed in a romanticized light as well. Strangely enough, there was several times that were well-suited for historical romance in America. Both the [...] "era of Indian wars, which lie scattered along a considerable period" [...] and [...] "the revolution" [...] served as historic time periods where romantic feelings of heroism and romanticism pleased the masses (Tilton, 58). These time periods exemplified eras where citizens sought literature and entertainment as sources to take their <b>minds</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> otherworldly problems occurring.|$|R

5000|$|Guynemer was lionized by the French {{press and}} became a {{national}} hero. The French government encouraged the publicity to boost morale and take <b>the</b> people's <b>minds</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> terrible losses in the trenches. Guynemer was embarrassed by the attention, but his shyness only increased the public's appetite {{to know everything about}} him. This was quite different later in 1918 with the French top ace René Fonck, who despite having 75 confirmed victories, had bad publicity for his arrogance and shameless self-promotion. Guynemer's death was a profound shock to France; nevertheless, he remained an icon {{for the duration of the}} war. Only 22 at his death, he continued to inspire the nation with his advice, [...] "Until one has given all, one has given nothing." ...|$|R

60|$|JOHNNY. Oh, public work! He does {{too much}} of it. It's really a sort of laziness, getting away from your own serious {{business}} to amuse yourself with other people's.

60|$|In the {{intervals}} when he gained her attention he strove, by talking lightly of other things, {{to take her}} <b>mind</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> incident, but somehow it had left him strangely and--he felt--disproportionately depressed,--although he had believed himself capable of facing more or less philosophically that condition which the speaker had so frankly expressed. Yet the remark, somehow, had had an illuminating effect like a flashlight, revealing to him {{the isolation of the}} Church as never before. And after dinner, as they were going to the smoking-room, the offender accosted him shamefacedly.|$|E

6000|$|The {{young man}} pondered this, and Imogene started {{up with an}} air of rescuing them from each other--as if she would not let Mr. Morton think Colville trivial or Colville {{consider}} the clergyman stupid, but would do what she could to take their <b>minds</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> whole question. Perhaps she was not very clear as to how this was to be done; at any rate she did not speak, and Mrs. Bowen came to her support, from whatever motive of her own. It might have been from a sense of the injustice of letting Mr. Morton suffer from the complications that involved herself and the others. The affair had been going very hitchily ever since they started, with the burden of the conversation left to the two men and that helpless girl; if it were not to be altogether a failure she must interfere." ...|$|R

50|$|The {{history of}} Njuup {{derives from the}} Ndut {{classical}} teachings. Young Serer boys in the Ndut (nest) were required to compose religious songs during their circumcision rite of passage {{in order to take}} their <b>minds</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> pending circumcision operation, develop their artistic skills and spirituality. These songs are Serer religious in nature. The Njuup tradition is the progenitor of Mbalax and for a long part of its history has remained {{within the confines of the}} Ndut. Unlike the Mbalax which is a party music, the Njuup tradition is religious, and it was not until some prominent Senegalese artists such Youssou N'Dour (himself of Serer heritage) began to incorporate it in their early works thereby giving birth to the Mbalax music. All Mbalax artists are strongly influenced by the Njuup tradition. There are also other Senegambian artists who sing the purest form of Njuup in the Serer language, some of these include Rémi Jegaan Dioh, the late Serer diva - Yandé Codou Sène, etc.|$|R
