50|$|A nettop (or <b>miniature</b> <b>PC,</b> Mini PC or Smart Micro PC) is a small-sized, inexpensive, low-power, legacy-free desktop {{computer}} designed for basic {{tasks such as}} Internet surfing, accessing web-based applications, document processing, and audio/video playback. The word nettop is a portmanteau of Internet and desktop.|$|E
40|$|Objective of the Master Thesis was {{to bring}} in two {{solutions}} of <b>miniature</b> <b>PC</b> display. One of them uses the VGA signal {{as the source of}} the data. The second uses USB for communication. Display using USB was chosen to be produced. Device contains LCD screen, SD card reader and audio DAC with mini speaker. Software running on the PC allows user to watch part of the screen of the computer. Position and size of the chosen part may be varied. The display may be controlled by touch screen. One part of the software running on PC is a simple video player...|$|E
40|$|Sensor {{systems for}} machine {{monitoring}} (energy monitoring, condition monitoring) {{can be built}} up from available low cost components. The Raspberry Pi, being a <b>miniature</b> <b>PC,</b> is well suited to collect and save data, to control a human machine interface and make the connection to the Web via Ethernet. Metering the energy of a 3 phase power line {{can be done by}} an energy metering sensor combined with an Arduino Uno microcontroller. The used sensor ADE 7758 can do energy and power measurement with about 1 % accuracy. Autonomous, wireless sensors working on energy harvesting principles complement the system by measuring additional physical quantities and building a sensor network distributed over the machine. The use of programmable sensors is necessary to analyze measured data and transmit only a few specific values, thus having a minimum number of transmitted bytes...|$|E
50|$|Sharp has {{continued}} {{development of the}} SL series in Japan releasing the SL-C700, C750, C760 and C860 models which all feature 640x480 VGA screen resolution. They are all based on faster 400 MHz Intel XScale technology, although the SL-C700 was flawed and the apparent speed {{was the same as}} the 206 MHz SL-5500. All four of the SL-C models are clamshell type devices with the unusual ability to rotate the screen. This allows the device to be used in landscape mode with the keyboard, much like a <b>miniature</b> notebook <b>PC,</b> or in portrait mode as a PDA.|$|R
40|$|Abstract—One of the {{essential}} building-blocks of <b>miniature</b> photonic crystal (<b>PC)</b> -based photonic integrated circuits (PICs) is the sharp bend. Our group {{has focused on the}} 2 -D photonic crystal based on a triangular lattice of holes perforating a standard heterostructure. The latter, GaAlAs-based or InP-based, is vertically a monomode waveguide. We consider essentially one or two 60 bends defined by one to five missing rows, spanning both cases of monomode and multimode channel waveguides. From intensive modeling and various experimental measurements (both on GaAs and InP), we point out the origin of the present level of bend insertion losses and discuss the merits of the many roads open for improved design. Index Terms—Integrated optics, photonic crystals (PCs), waveguides. I...|$|R
50|$|After the {{conclusion}} of the first stage of the trials at the sea, it was obvious that operating the DSRV in such complex submarine rescue operations could not be conducted manually alone, but instead, automation was not only needed, {{but it was also a}} must. Harbin Engineering University professor Bian Xinqian (边信黔), who was among the first exchange scholars China sent abroad in the early 1980s to study computer systems, PCs in particular, recommended and subsequently lead a team to develop a new computer system for Type 7103 DSRV, because the computer system China had back then was simply too bulky to be fit into Type 7103 DSRV and a brand new system was needed. This was a considerable challenge for Chinese considering that the first <b>miniature</b> computer IBM <b>PC</b> had just appeared several years before and China had nothing similar at the time. Under the leadership of Professor Bian Xinqian, the team succeeded in successfully developing a mini/micro computer system during a short span of time, and adopted the system for use on Type 7103 DSRV. This computer system won national award in 1985, even before the completion of Type 7103 DSRV program.|$|R
40|$|AbstractA {{great number}} of sensors are {{nowadays}} available, this has {{stressed the need for}} new approaches to merge low-level measurements to realize what facts they refer to in the real environment. Ambient Intelligence (AmI) techniques exploit information about the environment state to adapt the environment itself to the users’ preferences. Even if traditional sensors allow a rough understanding of the users’ preferences, ad-hoc sensors are required to obtain a deeper comprehension of users’ habits and activities. In this paper we propose a framework to recognize users’ activities via the Microsoft Kinect. The approach proposed here takes advantage of the position of some human body parts estimated by using Kinect depth information. In our system, significant patterns of joints (i. e., postures) are discovered by applying a clustering technique and then classified by means of a multi-class SVM. Each activity is then modeled as a sequence of known postures by using HMMs. A prototype has been implemented by connecting the Kinect to a <b>miniature</b> <b>PC</b> with limited computational resources. Experimental tests have been performed on a dataset we collected at our laboratory and results look very promising...|$|E
