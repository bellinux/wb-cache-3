40|$|Coaching is {{a modern}} tool for {{personal}} development with many advantages and successful applications. However, some concerns arise from the religious and ethical perspectives. Links to esoterics and New Age have been proclaimed by leaders <b>of</b> <b>coaching</b> schools that operate in the Czech Republic. Moreover, a survey has indicated that ethical limits <b>of</b> Czech <b>coaches</b> are more liberal than the official position of the Catholic Church. Thus, for a Catholic Christian, the coaching is promising as well as questionable. Biblical texts, {{as well as the}} facts from the subsequent history of Church, indicate many similarities: Christianity has exhibited <b>marks</b> <b>of</b> <b>coaching</b> since the very beginnings. On the other hand, most <b>of</b> the <b>coaching</b> schools deny God, absolute truth, or the concept of sin. An appropriate approach how to address this tension is a reflection of anthropological fundaments. Analyzing sincerely one <b>of</b> the <b>coaching</b> schools (Neuroleadership), we can conclude that all of them have clear counterparts in the Christian doctrine. In spite to this positive conclusion, it is necessary to be cautious when facing practical ethical dilemmas. A wise application <b>of</b> the <b>coaching</b> approach can be helpful also in the spiritual direction. Powered by TCPDF (www. tcpdf. org...|$|R

50|$|Following the {{derailment}} of 390033 at Grayrigg in 2007, Virgin Trains had {{the need}} for an additional set.

Nicknamed the Pretendolino, this received re-upholstered seating, power points, wi-fi and a full external re-paint at Wabtec, Doncaster in 2009. Virgin used this set with a Class 90 locomotive hired from Freightliner on a Euston to Crewe (via Birmingham) Friday relief service until December 2012, and also hired the train out as a charter train.
