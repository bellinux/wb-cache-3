50|$|Previously, {{electric}} {{passenger services}} stopping at Linden were trains hauled by ED and EW class electric locomotives, and DM/D and EM/ET class electric <b>multiple</b> <b>units.</b> ED locomotives hauled passenger trains from their introduction in 1940 but were rarely seen on passenger trains after {{the introduction of}} the EW class locomotives in 1952. The last ED operated in 1981. EW class locomotives introduced in 1952 pulled the majority of passenger trains from 1952 but became redundant with the introduction of EM/ET class <b>multiple</b> <b>units</b> in the early 1980s. The last EW hauled passenger service through Linden was on 11 February 1983. DM/D electric <b>multiple</b> <b>units</b> first ran on the line on 5 September 1949, and the last of this class were withdrawn from service after the arrival of the FT/FP class (Matangi) <b>multiple</b> <b>units</b> in 2011. The EM/ET class <b>multiple</b> <b>units</b> were introduced between 1982 and 1983 to replace locomotive-hauled trains and some of the DM/D electric <b>multiple</b> <b>units</b> and last operated on 27 May 2016 after additional FT/FP class (Matangi) <b>multiple</b> <b>units</b> were introduced.|$|R
5|$|On 26 April 1924, an {{electric}} <b>multiple</b> <b>unit</b> {{collided with the}} rear of an excursion train carrying passengers from the FA Cup Final in Coventry. Five passengers were killed. The accident was blamed on poor visibility owing to smoke and steam under the Park Street Bridge.|$|E
5|$|On 4 April 1958, {{locomotive}} No. 31867 was hauling a parcels {{train that}} overran signals and collided {{with an electric}} <b>multiple</b> <b>unit</b> at Gloucester Road Junction, Croydon, Surrey. Nine people were injured.|$|E
5|$|Vehicles {{weighing}} over 5,000 kilograms {{are divided}} into two categories: Heavy Single Units and Heavy Multiple Units. Heavy <b>Multiple</b> <b>Unit</b> Vehicles will be charged two or three time the passenger rate, {{depending on the size}} of the vehicle.|$|E
50|$|The fleet {{comprises}} five 2-car Protos electric <b>multiple</b> <b>units</b> {{and nine}} 3-car Stadler GTWs diesel <b>multiple</b> <b>units.</b> Two Stadler Flirts are due for delivery in 2018.|$|R
50|$|Multiple-unit {{train control}} {{was first used}} in Electric <b>Multiple</b> <b>Units</b> in the 1890s. This allowed electrically-powered rapid transit trains to be {{operated}} from a single driving position. Early users of such <b>multiple</b> <b>units</b> include the Liverpool Overhead Railway (the first <b>multiple</b> <b>units)</b> and Chicago's South Side Elevated Railroad (the first units to use a low-voltage control system).|$|R
5000|$|RB: class 650 diesel <b>multiple</b> <b>units</b> (Herrenberg-Plochingen, Herrenberg-Bad Urach), one service {{operated}} {{with class}} 110 locomotives + Silberling carriages (Plochingen-Tübingen) and class 426 electric <b>multiple</b> <b>units</b> (Plochingen-Nürtingen) ...|$|R
5|$|When the Central London Railway {{opened in}} 1900, it used {{camel-back}} electric locomotives hauling six-car trains. The locomotives weighed 44 tons and were largely unsprung, causing severe vibration problems in properties near the line. In {{an effort to}} resolve the problem, four of the coaches were fitted with motors, in the first trial in Britain of the Sprague-Thomson-Houston <b>multiple</b> <b>unit</b> control system. The trials were a success, and <b>multiple</b> <b>unit</b> trains were running by 1903. Two of the trial cars, numbers 201 and 202, were retained {{and became the first}} ballast motor cars to work on the Underground. They worked in this form until about 1910, when batteries were fitted. They were renumbered L22 and L23 in 1929, and were scrapped in 1936 and 1937.|$|E
5|$|GMB Class 71 is an {{electric}} <b>multiple</b> <b>unit</b> used by Flytoget for the Airport Express Trains on the Gardermoen Line of Norway. Sixteen three-car train sets were built by Adtranz Strømmen between 1997 and 1998. The units {{are capable of}} , connecting Oslo Central Station and other stations in Metropolitan Oslo to the Oslo Airport, Gardermoen, along Norway's only high-speed railway.|$|E
5|$|Like other London termini, steam trains were {{phased out}} of Victoria by the 1960s, to be {{replaced}} by suburban electric and Diesel <b>Multiple</b> <b>Unit</b> services. Despite the end of international services following the opening of the Channel Tunnel, Victoria still remains an important London station, and its underground facilities in particular suffer from overcrowding. The Gatwick Express service provides easy access between Central London and Gatwick Airport for international travellers.|$|E
50|$|First North Western {{inherited}} {{a fleet of}} Mark 2 carriages, Class 101, 142, 150, 156 and 158 diesel <b>multiple</b> <b>units,</b> and Class 309 and 323 electric <b>multiple</b> <b>units.</b>|$|R
50|$|Rolling {{stock is}} mainly former SNCF Class X4500 Diesel <b>multiple</b> <b>units</b> and for long routes RIO / RIB <b>multiple</b> <b>units</b> withSNCF calss BB 25500 push pull {{electric}} locomotives.|$|R
50|$|Commuter rail {{trains are}} usually {{composed}} of <b>multiple</b> <b>units,</b> which are self-propelled, bidirectional, articulated passenger rail cars with driving motors on each (or every other) bogie. Depending on local circumstances and tradition {{they may be}} powered either by diesel engines located below the passenger compartment (diesel <b>multiple</b> <b>units)</b> or by electricity picked up from third rails or overhead lines (electric <b>multiple</b> <b>units).</b> <b>Multiple</b> <b>units</b> are almost invariably equipped with control cabs at both ends, which is why such units are so frequently used to provide commuter services, due to the associated short turn-around time.|$|R
5|$|On 10 March 2000, a {{passenger}} train collided {{with an empty}} stock train in platform 5 due to driver error. Thirty-five people were injured. On 15 August 2017, a Class 456 electric <b>multiple</b> <b>unit</b> collided with an engineers' train at the station. The passenger train was derailed, causing disruption {{for the remainder of}} the day. Three people were checked for injuries, but nobody was hospitalised.|$|E
5|$|On 3 June 1960, {{an empty}} stock train formed of two 4COR {{electric}} multiple units overran signals {{and was in}} a sidelong collision with a steam-hauled passenger train that was departing for , Dorset. A few people suffered slight injuries. On 11 April the following year, an electric <b>multiple</b> <b>unit</b> overran signals and was in a head-on collision with a steam locomotive. One person was killed and fifteen were injured.|$|E
5|$|The Kawasaki Heavy Industries C151, {{sometimes}} {{abbreviated to}} C151 or KHI C151 {{is the first}} generation electric <b>multiple</b> <b>unit</b> rolling stock in operation on the North South and East West Lines of Singapore's Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) system. These are the oldest trains built for the system; they were introduced in 1987 and are still in operation. Sixty-six trainsets consisting of six cars each and a single money trainset consisting of four cars were purchased. These trains are operated by SMRT Trains.|$|E
50|$|In the 1960s declining {{passenger}} {{numbers and}} {{the high cost of}} electricity lead to the replacement of the electric <b>multiple</b> <b>units</b> with diesel <b>multiple</b> <b>units.</b> The units had all been withdrawn by 17 June 1967 when electric working ceased.|$|R
50|$|In 1983, Stadtbahn <b>multiple</b> <b>units</b> were {{purchased}} {{to replace the}} articulated <b>multiple</b> <b>units</b> used by AVG on A line in August 1983. The new sets offered significantly more capacity.|$|R
50|$|Most Southern routes are {{operated}} using electric <b>multiple</b> <b>units,</b> but the London Bridge-East Croydon-Oxted-Uckfield and Brighton-Eastbourne-Hastings-Rye-Ashford International routes are {{not fully}} electrified and are operated using diesel <b>multiple</b> <b>units.</b>|$|R
