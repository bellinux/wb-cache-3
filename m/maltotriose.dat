It is during this stage that {{fermentable}} sugars won from the malt (maltose, <b>maltotriose,</b> glucose, fructose and sucrose) are metabolized into alcohol and carbon dioxide. Fermentation tanks come in many shapes and sizes, from enormous cylindroconical vessels that can look like storage silos, to five-gallon glass carboys used by homebrewers. Most breweries today use cylindroconical vessels (CCVs), which have a conical bottom and a cylindrical top. The cone's aperture is typically around 70°, an angle that will allow the yeast to flow smoothly out through the cone's apex at the end of fermentation, but is not so steep as to take up too much vertical space. CCVs can handle both fermenting and conditioning in the same tank. At the end of fermentation, the yeast and other solids have fallen to the cone's apex can be simply flushed out through a port at the apex. Open fermentation vessels are also used, often for show in brewpubs, and in Europe in wheat beer fermentation. These vessels have no tops, making it easy to harvest top-fermenting yeasts. The open tops of the vessels increase the risk of contamination, but proper cleaning procedures help to control the risk.|$|E
5000|$|For {{manufacturing}} IMO on {{a commercial}} scale, food industries use starch processed from cereal crops like wheat, barley, pulses (peas, beans, lentils), oats, tapioca, rice, potato and others. This variety in sources could benefit consumers who have allergies or hypersensitivity to certain cereal crops. The manufacturing process controls the degree of polymerization (dp) and the α(1,6)-linkages to ensure a consistent quality of IMO from different starch sources. The starch is first converted, by means of simple enzymatic hydrolysis, into high maltose syrup with di-, tri and oligosaccharides (2, 3 or more glucose units) having α(1,4)-glycosidic linkages which are readily digestible in the human intestine. These α(1,4)-glycosidic linkages are further converted into digestion-resistant α(1,6)-glycosidic linkages, creating [...] "iso" [...] linkages between glucose moieties and forming Isomalto-oligosaccharide (IMO). [...] The majority of oligosaccharides found in IMO consist of three to six monosaccharide (glucose) units linked together. However, disaccharides, as well as longer polysaccharides (up to nine glucose units), are also present. The disaccharide fraction of IMO consists mainly of α(1,6)-linked isomaltose, while <b>maltotriose,</b> panose, and isomaltotriose make up the trisaccharide fraction.

5000|$|Mashing {{usually takes}} 1 to 2 hours, and {{during this time}} the various {{temperature}} rests activate different enzymes depending upon the type of malt being used, its modification level, and {{the intention of the}} brewer. The activity of these enzymes convert the starches of the grains to dextrins and then to fermentable sugars such as maltose. A mash rest from 49 - 55 C activates various proteases, which break down proteins that might otherwise cause the beer to be hazy. This rest is generally used only with undermodified (i.e. undermalted) malts which are decreasingly popular in Germany and the Czech Republic, or non-malted grains such as corn and rice, which are widely used in North American beers. A mash rest at [...] activates β-glucanase, which breaks down gummy β-glucans in the mash, making the sugars flow out more freely later in the process. In the modern mashing process, commercial fungal based β-glucanase may be added as a supplement. Finally, a mash rest temperature of 65 - 71 C is used to convert the starches in the malt to sugar, which is then usable by the yeast later in the brewing process. Doing the latter rest {{at the lower end of}} the range favours β-amylase enzymes, producing more low-order sugars like <b>maltotriose,</b> maltose, and glucose which are more fermentable by the yeast. This in turn creates a beer lower in body and higher in alcohol. A rest closer to the higher end of the range favours α-amylase enzymes, creating more higher-order sugars and dextrins which are less fermentable by the yeast, so a fuller-bodied beer with less alcohol is the result. Duration and pH variances also affect the sugar composition of the resulting wort.|$|E
40|$|Efficient {{fermentation}} of <b>maltotriose</b> is {{a desired}} property of Saccharomyces cerevisiae for brewing.

In this study, radiolabeled <b>maltotriose</b> was used to show that overexpression of the maltose permease gene, MAL 61, in an industrial yeast strain resulted in an increase in the rate of transport of <b>maltotriose</b> as well as maltose. A strain derived from W 303 - 1 A and lacking any maltose or <b>maltotriose</b> transporter but carrying a functional maltose transport activator (MAL 63) was developed. By complementing this strain with permeases encoded by MAL 31, MAL 61, and AGT 1, it was possible to measure their specific transport kinetics by using <b>maltotriose</b> and maltose. All three permeases were capable of high-affinity transport of <b>maltotriose</b> and of allowing growth of the strain on the sugar. <b>Maltotriose</b> utilization from the permease encoded by AGT 1 was regulated by the same genetic mechanisms as those involving the maltose transcriptional activator. Competition studies carried out with two industrial strains, one not containing any homologue of AGT 1, showed that maltose uptake and <b>maltotriose</b> uptake were competitive and that maltose was the preferred substrate. These results indicate that the presence of residual <b>maltotriose</b> in beer is not due to a genetic or physiological inability of yeast cells to utilize the sugar but rather to the lower affinity for <b>maltotriose</b> uptake in conjunction with deteriorating conditions present at the later stages of fermentation.

To this end, a previously constructed genomic library was used to identify <b>maltotriose</b> transporter genes by functional complementation of a strain devoid of known maltose transporters. One gene, clearly belonging to the MAL transporter family, was repeatedly isolated from the library. Sequence comparison showed that the novel gene (designated MTY 1) shares 90 % and 54 % identity with MAL 31 and AGT 1, respectively.

The sequence variations and discrepancies between these two proteins (Agt 1 pWH 310 and Agt 1 pWH 314) were investigated for potential effects on the functionality and <b>maltotriose</b> transport efficiency of these two AGT 1 -encoded a-glucoside transporters. A 23 -aminoacid C-terminal truncation proved not to be critical for <b>maltotriose</b> affinity. The identification of three amino acid differences, which potentially could have been instrumental in the transportation of <b>maltotriose,</b> were further investigated. Single mutations were created to restore the point mutations I 505 T, V 549 A and T 557 S one by one.

They have mild sweetness, increase the viscosity and have been suggested to delay the retrogradation of starch. As native starch is only slowly degradable by amylases, the first steps in the conversion of starch are gelatinization and liquefaction of the starch polymers. The obtained maltodextrins can then be used for saccharification, i. e. the further hydrolysis to malto-oligosaccharides.

One enzyme unit is the amount of enzyme that releases 1 µmol reducing sugars per mL from a 1. 0 % soluble starch solution per min at pH 6. 0 and 40 °C. Incubation of a 20 % maltodextrin solution with 3. 5 units maltotetraose producing amylase / g dm maltodextrin for 28 h at 50 °C and pH 5. 5 gave the highest yields of maltotetraose. The obtained syrups were further enriched in <b>maltotriose</b> or maltotetraose in one step by size exclusion chromatography (SEC) and collecting specific fractions, or in two steps by selective fermentation of glucose, maltose (and <b>maltotriose)</b> in the syrups with specific yeast strains and ethanol precipitation to remove larger glucose chains. SEC produces <b>maltotriose</b> and maltotetraose of high purity, but the yields are low. It was possible to selectively ferment glucose and maltose (for the <b>maltotriose</b> enriched syrup) and glucose, maltose and <b>maltotriose</b> (for the maltotetraose enriched syrup) by making use of two different Saccharomyces cerevisiae yeast strains. Next to that, larger glucose chains can be removed with ethanol precipitation. Under the experimental conditions, an ethanol concentration of 60 % was necessary to precipitate large glucose chains without precipitation of <b>maltotriose</b> and maltotetraose. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|To {{investigate}} a satiety substance in the hemolymph of the prawn P. japonicus, chemical analysis of saccharide group under different molting stages and feeding conditions was done using paper and thin-layer chromatographies. Hemolymph patterns of saccharides, {{regardless of the}} individual prawn's condition, showed a prominent glucose, and an especially weak reaction which corresponded to <b>maltotriose.</b> The oligosaccharide was identified as <b>maltotriose</b> by the thin-layer chromatography of hemolymphs collected from four prawns. These prawns were injected with glucose solution through the oesophagus into the stomach cavity and kept alive for 4. 5 h. In contrast to glucose, <b>maltotriose</b> showed an inhibitory effect on feeding during the postmolt period after its abdominal injection. Further, <b>maltotriose</b> indicated an accelerative effect on the nerve cells in the ventro-anterior portion of the suboesophageal ganglion, because {{of the increase in}} their nucleo-cytoplasm ratio after its abdominal injection. As a result, the oligosaccharide <b>maltotriose</b> seemed to perform as a satiety substance which originated in the midgut gland of the prawn...|$|E
