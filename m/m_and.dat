40|$|AbstractThe Banach fixed-point theorem {{states that}} a {{contraction}} mapping on a {{complete metric space}} has a unique fixed point. Given an oracle access to a finite metric space (<b>M,d)</b> <b>and</b> a contraction mapping f:M→M on it, we show that the fixed point of f can be found with an expected O(|M|) oracle queries. We also show that every randomized algorithm for finding a fixed point must make an expected Ω(|M|) oracle queries to (<b>M,d)</b> <b>and</b> f for some finite metric space (<b>M,d)</b> <b>and</b> some contraction mapping f:M→M on it. As a generalization of the Banach fixed-point theorem, the Caristi–Kirk fixed-point theorem gives weaker conditions on (<b>M,d)</b> <b>and</b> f guaranteeing {{the existence of a}} fixed point of f. We show that every randomized algorithm that finds a fixed point must make the expected Ω(|M|) oracle queries to (<b>M,d)</b> <b>and</b> f for some finite metric space (<b>M,d)</b> <b>and</b> some function f:M→M satisfying the conditions of the Caristi–Kirk fixed-point theorem...|$|R

5|$|Born into {{a working-class}} family, Nurmi left school at 12 {{to provide for}} his family. In 1912, he was {{inspired}} by the Olympic feats of Hannes Kolehmainen and began developing a strict training program. Nurmi started to flourish during his military service, setting national records en route to his international debut at the 1920 Summer Olympics. After a silver medal in the 5000 m, he took gold in the 10,000 <b>m</b> <b>and</b> the cross country events. In 1923, Nurmi became the first, and so far only, runner to hold the world record in the mile, the 5000 <b>m</b> <b>and</b> the 10,000 m races at the same time. He went on to set new world records for the 1500 <b>m</b> <b>and</b> the 5000 m with just an hour between the races, and take gold medals in the distances in less than two hours at the 1924 Olympics. Seemingly untouched by the Paris heat wave, Nurmi won all his races and returned home with five gold medals, but embittered, as Finnish officials had refused to enter him for the 10,000 m.|$|E
5|$|Buoyed by {{his defeat}} to Guillemot, Nurmi's races became {{a series of}} {{experiments}} which he analyzed meticulously. Previously known for his blistering pace on the first few laps, Nurmi started to carry a stopwatch and spread his efforts more uniformly over the distance. He aimed to perfect his technique and tactics {{to a point where}} the performances of his rivals would be rendered meaningless. Nurmi set his first world record on the 10,000 m in Stockholm in 1921. In 1922, he broke the world records for the 2000 m, the 3000 <b>m</b> <b>and</b> the 5000 m. A year later, Nurmi added the records for the 1500 <b>m</b> <b>and</b> the mile. His feat of holding the world records for the mile, the 5000 <b>m</b> <b>and</b> the 10,000 m at the same time has not been matched by any other athlete before or since. Nurmi also tested his speed in the 800 m, winning the 1923 Finnish Championships with a new national record. After excelling in mathematics, Nurmi graduated as an engineer in 1923 and returned home to prepare for the upcoming Olympic Games.|$|E
