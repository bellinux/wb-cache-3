40|$|For {{the first}} time, {{to the best}} of our knowledge, {{analytical}} expressions for <b>mutually</b> <b>compensating</b> the curved mirror astigmatism in the two terminal arms of a folded resonator are deduced and experimentally verified. The analytical expressions are derived using the theory of the propagation and transformation of Gaussian beams under few assumptions. Our exact analytical expressions describe the necessary and sufficient conditions for simultaneously compensating astigmatism in two arms of a sequence of two off-axis curved mirrors. The theoretical results indicate that, when the astigmatism compensation expressions are satisfied, the astigmatism introduced by a folded curved mirror can be <b>mutually</b> <b>compensated</b> by another folded curved mirror, even if there is no additional Brewster element inside the cavity. The astigmatism can only be successfully eliminated by using a pair of concave mirrors or convex mirrors. Our analytical expressions can be used to design astigmatically compensated folded resonators without a Brewster element. A typical side-pumped z-shaped cavity Nd:YAG laser is employed to demonstrate the astigmatic compensation. Experimental measurements of the pattern of the laser output beam show that not only the spot intensity profile deformation but, in addition, the phase distortion in the two terminal arms can be simultaneously compensated completely in the cavity, which is in good agreement with the analytical predictions...|$|R

40|$|Antibiotic-resistant {{bacteria}} are increasingly a major healthcare problem {{but very few}} new classes of antibiotics have been discovered or launched in recent decades. Approaches {{to dealing with the}} problem include learning how bacteria evolve to resistance and improving dosing regimens with current antibiotics so as to reduce the selection of resistant bacteria. This thesis presents studies examining whether antibiotic dosing at high levels can prevent the selection of fluoroquinolone-resistant mutants in Escherichia coli. It also addresses the genetics of fluoroquinolone resistance in E. coli in relation to fitness costs for the resistant bacteria, and the evolution of E. coli to reduce the costs of resistance. The mutant prevention concentration (MPC) of ciprofloxacin was measured for a set of clinical urinary tract infection E. coli strains showing that MPC could not be predicted from the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC). Results from an in vitro kinetic model showed that an AUC/MPC > 22 for ciprofloxacin was the single best pharmacodynamic index that predicted prevention of resistance emergence in the wild-type. Simulating currently approved dosing regimens for three different fluoroquinolones it was found that only a few were effective in preventing the selection of a small sub-population of pre-existing mutants. Step-wise selection of fluoroquinolone resistance showed that the accumulation of mutations usually reduced bacterial fitness in vitro and in vivo. Systematic construction of isogenic resistant strains confirmed this result and revealed that some combinations of resistance mutations <b>mutually</b> <b>compensate</b> and increase both resistance and fitness. It was discovered that mutations altering RNA polymerase could ameliorate the fitness costs of fluoroquinolone resistance. Thus, the major fitness cost of fluoroquinolone resistance is due to defective transcription. The finding that fluoroquinolone resistance mutations can increase resistance while <b>mutually</b> <b>compensating</b> their fitness costs, shows that resistance to fluoroquinolones can continue to evolve in the absence of antibiotic selection...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Renewable {{energy sources}} often provide inter-mittent power at {{distributed}} locations in {{transmission and distribution}} networks. Efficient utilization of these sources must consider economics, computation, and reliability in managing network resources. A new computational tool for efficient dispatch of intermittent sources is developed using the risk limiting operational paradigm. Optimal dispatch of regulation and load following ancillary services is computed using current estimates of future random energy production. Substitution of intermittent power with firm power through a curtailment strategy is used to avoid regulation costs in excess of current firm power prices. The underlying mathematical framework is a non-convex optimal power flow problem, which is shown to have an exact convex relaxation under a set of realistic assumptions. The methodology is successfully tested on an IEEE 30 -bus test system. Several operational effects of source uncertainty are captured. For instance, optimal solutions are shown to create power flows that <b>mutually</b> <b>compensate</b> intermittencies from different sources to minimize regulation requirements. I...|$|R

The idea is very simple. The dynamical friction acting on a small satellite, moving through a stellar galactic halo, makes this satellite slow down. On the other hand, a stellar disk, rotating faster than a satellite, makes it speed up. But the density distributions in radius for disk's and halo's stars in real flat galaxies are quite different (respectively, exponential and power-law). Moreover, the observational data show that the exponential profile for disk's surface density drops abruptly at some radius (r sub d).

Synthetic ecology has indicated that it is feasible for organisms to establish novel mutualism merely through encountering each other by showing that it is feasible to construct synthetic mutualism between organisms.

In this study, we synthetically constructed mutualism between a bacterium and a eukaryote by using two model organisms. We mixed a bacterium, Escherichia coli (a genetically engineered glutamine auxotroph), and an amoeba, Dictyostelium discoideum, in 14 sets of conditions in which each species could not grow in monoculture but potentially could grow in coculture.
