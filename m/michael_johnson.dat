5|$|At {{the age of}} 29, <b>Michael</b> <b>Johnson</b> {{was engaged}} to be married to a local woman, Mary Neild, but she {{cancelled}} the engagement. Twenty years later, in 1706, he married Sarah Ford. She came from a middle-class milling and farming family and was twelve years his junior, daughter of Cornelius Ford. Although both families had money, Samuel Johnson often claimed that he grew up in poverty. It is uncertain what happened between the marriage of his parents and Samuel's birth three years later to provoke a decline in the family's fortunes, but <b>Michael</b> <b>Johnson</b> quickly became overwhelmed with debt from which he was never able to recover.|$|E

5|$|On 31 October 1728, a {{few weeks}} after he turned 19, Johnson entered Pembroke College, Oxford as a fellow-commoner. The {{inheritance}} did not cover all of his expenses at Pembroke, but Andrew Corbet, a friend and student at Pembroke, offered to make up the deficit. Corbet left Pembroke soon after Johnson arrived, so this source of aid disappeared. To meet the expenses, <b>Michael</b> <b>Johnson</b> allowed his son to borrow a hundred books from his bookshop, at a great cost to himself, and these books were not fully returned to Michael until many years later.|$|E

The season saw {{the continuation of}} the wildcard format and 14-man tournament bracket.

The wildcard slots went to Marc Stevens and Aaron Wilkinson, with Wilkinson handing Stevens his second successive guillotine choke loss. The show was dominated by Josh Koscheck's attempts to annoy Georges St-Pierre, with St-Pierre's paramedic getting involved in the arguments with Koscheck.

5|$|The silver medals {{from the}} 2007 Osaka World Championships boosted Bolt's desire to run, {{and he took}} a more serious, more mature stance towards his career. Bolt {{continued}} to develop in the 100 m, and he entered to run in the event at the Jamaica Invitational in Kingston. On 3 May 2008, Bolt ran a time of 9.76 s, with a 1.8 m/s tail wind, improving his personal best from 10.03 s. This was the second-fastest legal performance {{in the history of the}} event, second only to compatriot Asafa Powell's 9.74 s record set the previous year in Rieti, Italy. Rival Tyson Gay lauded the performance, praising Bolt's form and technique especially. <b>Michael</b> <b>Johnson,</b> who was observing the race, said that he was shocked at how quickly he had improved over the 100 m distance. The Jamaican surprised even himself with the time, but coach Glen Mills remained confident that there was more to come.|$|E

5000|$|The final {{match on}} the undercard was a four-on-four Survivor Series {{elimination}} match pitting Shawn <b>Michaels,</b> Ahmed <b>Johnson,</b> British Bulldog and Sycho Sid against Yokozuna, Owen Hart, the WWF Intercontinental Champion Razor Ramon and Dean Douglas. The tension arose {{between the two}} teams as heroes and villains were randomly distributed in both teams and the match was dubbed as a [...] "Wildcard" [...] match. The heroes and villains fought their own teammates as Ramon attacked his own teammate Douglas, allowing Michaels to eliminate him by pinning him with a roll-up. Sid was next on Michaels' team to dominate Ramon and grabbed him for Michaels to perform a Superkick, which Michaels called Sweet Chin Music. Michaels tried to hit the move but Ramon ducked and Sid was hit instead, allowing Ramon to pin Sid for the elimination. Sid retaliated by performing a Powerbomb on <b>Michaels.</b> <b>Johnson</b> would then control the match as he eliminated Hart by performing a Sitout Double Underhook Powerbomb, which he called Pearl River Plunge. Ramon battled for his team and performed a Crucifix Powerbomb on Johnson, which he called Razor's Edge. However, Bulldog tagged Johnson which meant that Johnson could not be eliminated. Ramon was distracted by Sycho Sid, 1-2-3 Kid and Ted DiBiase, allowing Bulldog to perform a Running Powerslam for the elimination. Yokozuna battled the opposing team as he was the remaining member on his team. Johnson powerslammed Yokozuna and tried to pin him but Bulldog broke up the pin to save his ally. This caused <b>Michaels</b> and <b>Johnson</b> to attack Bulldog. Michaels then performed a Sweet Chin Music on Yokozuna and Johnson performed a Diving Splash on Yokozuna to win the match. <b>Michaels,</b> <b>Johnson</b> and Bulldog survived on their team.|$|R
