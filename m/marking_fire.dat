50|$|Fire Insurance {{has over}} 200 {{years of history}} in America. The early <b>fire</b> <b>marks</b> of Benjamin Franklin's time can still be seen on some Philadelphia {{buildings}} {{as well as in}} other older American cities. Subscribers paid fire fighting companies in advance for fire protection and in exchange would receive a <b>fire</b> <b>mark</b> to attach to their building. The payments for the <b>fire</b> <b>marks</b> supported the <b>fire</b> fighting companies. Volunteer fire departments were also common in the United States, and some fire insurers contributed money to these departments and awarded bonuses to the first fire engine arriving at the scene of a fire.|$|R
50|$|The Coat of Arms for Gamma Iota Sigma is in {{the shape}} of what is known as a <b>fire</b> <b>mark.</b> <b>Fire</b> <b>marks</b> were made of iron and placed on the {{exterior}} of the buildings on insured properties so as to identify the specific fire company that, {{in the event of a}} fire, would serve to extinguish it. The <b>fire</b> <b>mark</b> is decorated with the symbol of the four clasped right hands. Each hand is representative of one of the four ideals upon which the fraternity is based: friendship, knowledge, integrity, and fidelity. Beneath clasped hands are the Greek letters for Gamma Iota Sigma.|$|R

50|$|The <b>Mark</b> 92 <b>Fire</b> Control System is a US-built medium-range {{anti-aircraft}} {{missile and}} gun fire control system.

The <b>Mark</b> 92 <b>fire</b> control system was approved for service use in 1975. Introduction to the fleet and follow-on test and evaluation began in 1978.|$|R
50|$|The song {{revolves}} around {{a tragedy that}} {{took place on the}} evening of December 24, 1913, in Calumet's Italian Hall when more than five hundred striking miners and their families gathered for a Christmas party. The hall was on the second story and was reached by climbing a steep set of stairs. The only other exit was a poorly <b>marked</b> <b>fire</b> escape which could be reached by climbing out the windows.|$|R

25|$|The Brooklyn Class was {{deployed}} {{with the}} Mark 34 director {{and later the}} Mark 3 radar. This would be upgraded to the Mark 8 and again to the Mark 13 radar. The secondary battery was controlled by the Mark 28 and upgraded to the <b>Mark</b> 33 <b>fire</b> control systems. The associated radars were the <b>Mark</b> 4 <b>fire</b> control radar and upgraded again to the Mark 12. Two anti-aircraft fire directors were fitted to each ship. A late World War 2 refit saw the Mk 51 director installed for the 40mm Bofors guns. Night engagements were improved when in 1945 the Mark 57 and 63 directors in installed.|$|R
40|$|Stochastic Well-Formed Nets (SWN) is a High-Level Stochastic Petri Net {{formalism}} supporting performa-bility analysis. The symbolic <b>marking</b> and <b>firing</b> notions in SWNs {{allow to}} automatically aggregate states achieving significant reductions in highly symmetric models. If the reduced state space {{is still too}} large, simulation may be applied exploiting symbolic <b>marking</b> and <b>firing</b> to achieve more efficient handling of the Future Event List. This technique is implemented in the GreatSPN tool. In this paper symmetry based simulation methods are presented, their strong and weak points are discussed, the issue of performance indices definition and computation is introduced, and an extension exploiting the most recent results on partial symmetries is proposed. ...|$|R

50|$|Fire brigades in {{metropolitan}} areas were organised much {{along the same}} lines as in the United Kingdom and the United States and were funded by the insurance companies. Likewise the companies issued <b>fire</b> <b>marks</b> to be affixed to buildings to indicate where there were risks for which they had underwritten policies. Such <b>fire</b> <b>marks</b> were commonly made of tinplate, cast iron and lead.|$|R
50|$|The Sims class {{introduced}} the advanced <b>Mark</b> 37 Gun <b>Fire</b> Control System. With a turret-mounted gun director as in previous systems, the Mark 37 system incorporated the Ford <b>Mark</b> 1 <b>Fire</b> Control Computer mounted in a plotting room {{deep in the}} hull, which enabled automatic aiming of guns against surface or air targets with firing solutions in near real-time. The system would evolve and be used extensively to control most 5-inch guns on destroyers and larger ships, and remained in service on US ships until the 1970s.|$|R
50|$|One gunnery {{advantage}} the Americans had was the radar-controlled <b>Mark</b> 37 Gun <b>Fire</b> Control System. The {{brains of}} the system was the Ford <b>Mark</b> I <b>Fire</b> Control Computer, which provided coordinated automatic firing solutions for her 5-inch guns merely by pointing the gun director at the target. Crude by comparison, the Japanese used optical range finders aided by splash color dye markers in each shell, color-coded to the firing ship. At this point, the Japanese were unable to find the range of their attacker.|$|R
