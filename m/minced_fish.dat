5|$|In {{the northwestern}} Atlantic, the roughtail {{stingray}} is listed under Least Concern; {{it is not}} targeted or utilized by commercial fisheries, though inconsequential numbers are captured incidentally in trawls and on demersal longlines. Historically, it was sometimes ground up for fertilizer. In the Mediterranean, intensive fishing occurs in the habitat of the roughtail stingray, and it is caught incidentally by artisanal and commercial fishers using trawls, longlines, gillnets, and handlines. Though no specific data is available on this species, declines of other species and its intrinsic susceptibility to depletion have led it to be assessed as Near Threatened in the region. In the southwestern Atlantic, the roughtail stingray and other large rays are heavily fished using demersal trawls, gillnets, longlines, and hook-and-line; this fishing pressure is liable to increase due to growing commercial interest in using large stingrays for <b>minced</b> <b>fish</b> products. Anecdotal reports suggest that landings of this species are decreasing, leading to a regional assessment of Near Threatened.|$|E
25|$|Terengganu laksa (Malay: Laksa Terengganu) is {{the easiest}} laksa recipe that is famous among peoples {{from the town of}} Kuala Terengganu of the Terengganu state, located at the east coast of Peninsular Malaysia. The main {{ingredient}} of Terengganu Laksa's sauce is ikan kembong or round scad mackerel that are boiled and minced. The <b>minced</b> <b>fish</b> are fried with onions, garlic, ginger, datil pepper, belacan, kantan flower, Vietnamese coriander or daun kesum, lemon grass and dried tamarind slice. Coconut milk will then be added as the final ingredient and stirred until it is all mixed up and becomes thick. Terengganu Laksa is served just like the Italian spaghetti by adding ulam (raw vegetables) and blended chili on the side. Another variable of Terengganu Laksa is Laksam.

40|$|Background Laribacter hongkongensis {{has been}} {{recovered}} from several patients with gastroenteritis. However, the causative role of this organism in human gastroenteritis is still unproven, {{and sources of}} the bacterium are unknown. We undertook a multicentre case-control study to investigate the association of L hongkongensis with gastroenteritis. Methods Faecal samples from patients with community-acquired gastroenteritis and controls were cultured for L hongkongensis. Targeted food surveillance was done to identify potential sources of this bacterium. All isolates of this organism from patients and food items were characterised by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis and ribotyping. Findings During a 4 -month period, L hongkongensis was recovered from 17 of 3788 patients with community-acquired gastroenteritis, but was absent in 1894 controls (p= 0 · 001). Those who were culture-positive for this bacterium had a recent history of travel (ten [59 %] patients vs two [6 %] of 34 matched controls, p< 0 · 0001), of fish consumption (16 [94 %] vs 19 [56 %], p= 0 · 009), and of eating <b>minced</b> freshwater <b>fish</b> meat (five [29 %] vs one [3 %], p= 0 · 012). We recovered 25 L hongkongensis isolates from intestinal samples of freshwater fish and two from <b>minced</b> freshwater <b>fish</b> meat. Bacteria with the same pulsed-field gel electrophoretic pattern and ribotype were recovered from one patient and a sample of <b>minced</b> freshwater <b>fish</b> meat, which was from the same retail market recently visited by the patient. We did not see this particular combination of electrophoretic pattern and ribotype in any other isolates.

Different food additives (25 % mashed potato, 2 % NaCl, 2 % soybean oil, 2 % spices and 0. 6 % sugar) were used to enhance the consumer’s acceptance of the fishery product.

The results were found as follows: color (7. 25 ± 1. 15), flavor (6. 67 ± 1. 17), S/F (8. 47 ± 1. 20) and C/R (7. 83 ± 1. 23). Evaluation of proximate composition showed that the moisture and protein contents in grass carp mince were 79. 15 ± 1. 16 % and 18. 01 ± 0. 44 % respectively which were higher than that of fish burger, 69. 46 ± 0. 89 % and 16. 42 ± 0. 57 %, respectively.
