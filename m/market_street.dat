5|$|In Schenectady County, Schoharie Creek {{breaks from}} NY30A {{and returns to}} the {{vicinity}} of NY30 as it intersects U.S. Route20 (US20) in Esperance. From Esperance northward, the creek becomes roughly equidistant from both NY30 and NY30A as all three entities cross into Montgomery County. Near the northeastern corner of the county, NY30 enters the city of Amsterdam. The route meets the New York State Thruway (I-90) and NY5S via separate interchanges before heading downhill as a four-lane divided highway approaching the Mohawk River (here part of the Erie Canal). Historically, the bridge over the river was a straight line to <b>Market</b> <b>Street,</b> which is visible as one approaches northbound. Segments of downtown <b>Market</b> <b>Street</b> remain in use today. With the 1977 creation of the Amsterdam Mall, NY30, together with NY5 and NY67, were re-routed onto splits. After the splits rejoin, NY30 continues on <b>Market</b> <b>Street</b> and leaves the city and, for all purposes, the county.|$|E

The surface portion of Route 21 in Newark, which follows the Northeast Corridor rail line, was commissioned in 1934 between Routes 25 and 29 and <b>Market</b> <b>Street</b> and the portion through downtown Newark was commissioned in 1936 between <b>Market</b> <b>Street</b> and Clay Street. In 1948, the Route 21 designation was extended north to Paterson.|$|E
5|$|The Murano was {{announced}} in 2005 when Philadelphia, Pennsylvania was experiencing a condominium boom that had begun in the late 1990s; between 1998 and 2004 more than 70 Center City office and manufacturing buildings had been converted into rental and condominium apartments. The project was jointly developed by Thomas Properties Group of Los Angeles and P Associates of Philadelphia. The planned site of the Murano was on West <b>Market</b> <b>Street</b> in Center City, an area which had not had any residential development until 2002 when 2121 <b>Market</b> <b>Street</b> was converted into apartments. Construction began {{around the end of}} 2005.|$|E

5|$|In 1876, Waller ran as a Republican {{candidate}} for US Congress. He lost the election by 8376 votes to Democratic lawyer Francis Dolan Collins. He did, however, win Columbia County in the election. He {{was also the}} proprietor of a furnace on Roaring Creek and built the Bloomsburg Sanitarium {{at the corner of}} Sixth Street and <b>Market</b> <b>Street</b> in Bloomsburg in 1870. Waller was vice president of the State Agricultural Society. He also extended <b>Market</b> <b>Street</b> in Bloomsburg and built many houses along it. Along with John Ramsay, he built First Street in Bloomsburg and sold the lots on it to Welsh immigrants some time before 1847. He also laid out other residential streets in Bloomsburg. He supported moving the county seat of Columbia County from Danville to Bloomsburg, although he was unable to convince Danville's businessmen to move their industries to Bloomsburg. In 1866, he was made one of three trustees of Bloomsburg's Board of Trade.|$|E
5|$|In the 1960s, Wolgin began {{development}} of a two-tower high-rise complex in the West <b>Market</b> <b>Street</b> neighborhood of Philadelphia. Existing structures at the site were demolished in 1969 after the city condemned the structures using eminent domain. With the project over budget, Centre Square was redesigned just before construction was scheduled to begin. Originally intended to be two steel high rises, the redesign used concrete instead. Unlike similar projects in the city, the entire complex was constructed all at once. The US$80-million Centre Square opened in 1973 with First Pennsylvania Bank as the lead tenant. Centre Square is credited with shifting Philadelphia's downtown office district from South Broad Street to West <b>Market</b> <b>Street.</b>|$|E

5|$|Opposite Royton Town Hall is a {{shopping}} precinct containing 23 shop units and a supermarket {{operated by the}} Co-operative Food. The site was opened in 1971 and occupies the town's former <b>market</b> <b>street,</b> which was demolished in 1969. In 2004 a report noted that a weakness of the precinct is that it lacks a variety of shops.|$|E
5|$|Route 6 was redefined in 1929 to use {{none of the}} old road east of Paterson (it had {{formerly}} {{been planned}} to use <b>Market</b> <b>Street</b> west of roughly where Route 17 now crosses it), and Route 5 was cut back to run only east from Ridgefield. The portion of pre-1927 Route 10 that was bypassed by Route 6 was designated Route 10N, but was eventually removed from the state highway system. In addition, Route 6 was redefined to bypass Paterson to the south. The new route would enter Paterson just south of <b>Market</b> <b>Street,</b> but then turn south and southwest before heading back west to rejoin the old route at {{the east end of}} the Little Falls bypass at the Union Boulevard crossing. The old road along Union Boulevard towards Paterson was assigned Route S6, as a spur of Route 6. Route S6 became Route 62 in the 1953 renumbering, and has since been truncated to a short piece between US 46 and I-80 in Totowa.|$|E

5|$|Two subway stations, West Portal Station and Forest Hill Station, {{and five}} of the six light-rail lines, J Church, K Ingleside, L Taraval, M Ocean View, and N Judah, are {{remnants}} of an extensive streetcar system that survived the mass conversion to buses in the 1950s. In 1980, seven subway stations, from Embarcadero Station to Castro Street Station, were opened with the inauguration of the <b>Market</b> <b>Street</b> Subway underneath <b>Market</b> <b>Street,</b> marking the conversion of San Francisco's streetcar system into the Muni Metro. In 1998, four surface stations on The Embarcadero opened, connecting the newly constructed AT Park (then called Pacific Bell Park) and Caltrain to Muni Metro. In 2007, the T Third Street line was started along 18 new surface stations built along new track laid from Caltrain down {{the eastern side of the}} city to the city line.|$|E
