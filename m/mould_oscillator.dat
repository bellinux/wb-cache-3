40|$|We {{construct}} {{electronic oscillator}} from acellular slime mould Physarum polycephalum. The slime <b>mould</b> <b>oscillator</b> {{is made of}} two electrodes connected by a protoplasmic tube of the living slime mould. A protoplasmic tube has an average resistance of 3 ~MOhm. The tube's resistance is changing over time due to peristaltic contractile activity of the tube. The resistance of the protoplasmic tube oscillates with average period of 73 ~sec and average amplitude of 0. 6 ~MOhm. We present experimental laboratory results on dynamics of Physarum oscillator under direct current voltage up to 15 ~V and speculate that slime mould P. polycephalum can be employed as a living electrical oscillator in biological and hybrid circuits...|$|E
