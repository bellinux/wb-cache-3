5000|$|Both {{houses of}} Congress, the House of Representatives and Senate, have {{majority}} and <b>minority</b> <b>whips.</b> They in turn have subordinate [...] "regional" [...] whips. While members of Congress often vote along party lines, {{the influence of}} the whip is weaker than in the UK system. One reason is that a considerable amount of money is raised by individual candidates, and members of Congress, or any other person, cannot be expelled from a political party, which are formed simply by open registration. In addition, because preselection of candidates for office is generally done through a primary election open to a wide number of voters, a candidate who obeys their constituents' rejection of the party line cannot easily be deselected by his party.|$|R
