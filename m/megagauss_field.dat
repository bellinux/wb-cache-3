A normally-incident time-delayed probe pulse reflected from its critical surface undergoes a change in its ellipticity according to the magneto-optic Cotton-Mouton effect due to the azimuthal nature of the ambient self-generated <b>megagauss</b> magnetic <b>fields.</b> The temporal resolution of the magnetic field mapping is {{of the order of}} the pulsewidth, whereas a spatial resolution of a few microns is achieved by this optical technique. In addition, this technique does not suffer from refraction effects due to the steep plasma density gradients owing to the near-normal incidence of the probe pulse and consequently, higher harmonics of the probe can be employed to penetrate deeper into the plasma to even near-solid densities. The spatial and temporal evolution of the <b>megagauss</b> magnetic <b>fields</b> at the target front {{as well as at the}} target rear are presented.

A significant outcome was achieved in transport studies of microfabricated thin-film YBCO structures with the magnetic field in the CuO plane. Using a GHz transmission line technique at an ambient temperature of 1. 6 K, an onset of dissipation was observed at 150 T (a new upper bound for superconductivity in any material), with a saturation of resistivity at 240 T.

40|$|Joy's law (Hale et al. 1919) {{states that}} bipolar {{magnetic}} regions (BMRs) {{are inclined to}} the latitudinal line, with the p-shot (preceding spot) of the BMR closer to the equator and the tilt angle increasing with latitude. It is believed that the solar dynamo operates in the overshoot region just below the convection zone and the BMRs are produced by the flux loops rising from there due to magnetic buoyancy. These rising loops {{are expected to be}} twisted by the Coriolis force so that they eventually emerge on the solar surface with a tilt. The authors extend the numerical calculations of Choudhuri (1989) to study the tilts produced on the rising flux loops by the Coriolis force. They find that the theoretically calculated tilts match the observations only if the magnetic field of the flux loops lies in the range between 60 and 160 kG. For such flux loops, the tilt has the correct magnitude and also varies correctly with the latitude. If the magnetic fields were stronger than 160 kG, then Coriolis force is much weaker than magnetic buoyancy and is only able to produce tilts which are very small in overall magnitude, though they still vary correctly with latitude. On the other hand, if the fields were smaller than 60 kG, then the Coriolis force would have been so overpowering that the flux loops would move parallel to the rotation axis as found earlier (Choudhuri 1989). Such flux loops appear only in high latitudes and do not obey Joy's law. On changing the drag on the flux tube, these conclusions are not changed. If we change the footpoint separation of the flux loop, then we find that magnetic tension may halt the rise of the flux loop if the footpoint separation is below a critical value. However, for flux tubes which are able to reach the surface, the range from 60 to 160 kG for the magnetic field still approximately holds.

It would also be of value in astrophysics work with the magnetic fields of order B(, 0) inferred for the surfaces of neutron stars. ^ A general expression for the Compton cross section for a uniform, constant magnetic field was derived based on the Dirac equation and second order perturbation theory, the electrons represented by single particle wave functions and the photons by plane waves. The solution was carried out as far as practical analytically and was programmed for numerical solution by computer; the results were displayed graphically. ^ The solution possesses the usual energy conservation for the system of the electron plus the photon; in addition, the component along the magnetic field of the linear momentum of the system is conserved in the magnetic Compton effect. There is no general conservation of momentum. These conclusions are from the analytical portion of the work. The numerical portion reveals the existence of the Larmor peak, that is, a resonance in the total cross section when the frequency of the incoming photon is near the electron 2 ̆ 7 s Larmor frequency. At the peak, one photon polarization mode exhibits a severe dip for outgoing photons moving perpendicular to the magnetic field. Moveover, the collision has more likelihood of turning the initial photon around than of letting it pass straight through. ^ Although the analytical development of the cross section was not limited by approximations such as very high or very low energy electrons, magnetic fields weak in comparison to B(, 0), or restricted direction of the incoming photon, some of these limitations were effected in practice by the values of these variables for which the computer program would converge. ...|$|R

The Atlas facility at Los Alamos is the world's first and only laboratory pulsed power system designed specifically to explore this relatively new family of <b>megagauss</b> magnetic <b>field</b> applications. Constructed in 2000 and commissioned in August 2001, Atlas is a 24 -MJ high-performance capacitor bank delivering up to 30 MA with a current risetime of 5 - 6 {micro}sec. The high-precision, cylindrical, imploding liner is the tool most frequently used to convert electrical energy into the hydrodynamic (particle kinetic) energy needed to drive the experiments. For typical liner parameters including initial radius of 5 cm, the peak current of 30 MA delivered by Atlas results in magnetic fields just over 1 MG outside the liner prior to implosion.

40|$|The {{entry of}} fusion as a viable, {{competitive}} {{source of power}} has been stymied by the challenge of finding an economical way {{to provide for the}} confinement and heating of the plasma fuel. The main impediment for current nuclear fusion concepts is the complexity and large mass associated with the confinement systems. To take advantage of the smaller scale, higher density regime of magnetic fusion, an efficient method for achieving the compressional heating required to reach fusion gain conditions must be found. The very compact, high energy density plasmoid commonly referred to as a Field Reversed Configuration (FRC) provides for an ideal target for this purpose. To make fusion with the FRC practical, an efficient method for repetitively compressing the FRC to fusion gain conditions is required. A novel approach to be explored in this endeavor is to remotely launch a converging array of small macro-particles (macrons) that merge and form a more massive liner inside the reactor which then radially compresses and heats the FRC plasmoid to fusion conditions. The closed magnetic field in the target FRC plasmoid suppresses the thermal transport to the confining liner significantly lowering the imploding power needed to compress the target. With the momentum flux being delivered by an assemblage of low mass, but high velocity macrons, many of the difficulties encountered with the liner implosion power technology are eliminated. The undertaking to be described in this proposal is to evaluate the feasibility achieving fusion conditions from this simple and low cost approach to fusion. During phase I the design and testing of the key components for the creation of the macron formed liner have been successfully carried out. Detailed numerical calculations of the merging, formation and radial implosion of the Macron Formed Liner (MFL) were also performed. The phase II effort will focus on an experimental demonstration of the macron launcher at full power, and the demonstration of <b>megagauss</b> magnetic <b>field</b> compression by a small array of full scale macrons. In addition the physics of the compression of an FRC to fusion conditions will be undertaken with a smaller scale MFL. The timescale for testing will be rapidly accelerated by taking advantage of other facilities at MSNW where the target FRC will be created and translated inside the MFL just prior to implosion of the MFL. Experimental success would establish the concept at the Ã¢ÂÂproof of principleÃ¢ÂÂ level and the following phase III effort would focus on the full development of the concept into a fusion gain device. Successful operation would lead to several benefits in various fields.
