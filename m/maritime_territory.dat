500|$|On 21 July 2008, in {{response}} to questions from Singapore Members of Parliament about Pedra Branca, the Senior Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Balaji Sadasivan stated that the <b>maritime</b> <b>territory</b> around the island included a territorial sea of up to [...] and an Exclusive Economic Zone. This was condemned by Malaysia's Foreign Minister Rais Yatim as [...] "against the spirit of Asean and the legal structure" [...] as the claim was [...] "unacceptable and unreasonable and contradicts the principles of international law". In response, a Singapore Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman said that Singapore first stated its claim to a territorial sea and Exclusive Economic Zone on 15 September 1980, and reiterated this claim on 23 May 2008 following the ICJ's judgment. Both statements had made clear that if the limits of Singapore's territorial sea or Exclusive Economic Zone overlapped with the claims of neighbouring countries, Singapore would negotiate with those countries to arrive at agreed delimitations in accordance with international law. In August 2008, Rais said Malaysia took the view that Singapore was not entitled to claim an Exclusive Economic Zone around Pedra Branca as it considered that the maritime feature did not meet internationally recognised criteria for an island, that is, land inhabited by humans that had economic activity.|$|E

Before admission to the Union, Texas, as an independent nation, controlled water within three miles of the coast, the normal limit for nations. Under the equal footing doctrine, however, Texas was found not to have control over the three-mile belt after admission into the Union, because the original states did not at the time of joining the union control such waters. Instead, by entering the Union, Texas was found to have surrendered control over the water and the soil under it to Congress. Under the Submerged Lands Act of 1953, Congress returned <b>maritime</b> <b>territory</b> to some states, but not to others; the Act was sustained by the Supreme Court.|$|E

Expansion of oil and gas drilling to deeper and from shore more remote locations can again raise the question of ownership of these deposits.

On the other hand, there are other areas where states can settle their disputes and cooperate on drilling. The goal {{of this study is to}} determine which factors lead to the fact that particularly in the South China Sea disagreement about the boundaries of <b>maritime</b> <b>territories</b> results in the escalation of disputes in comparison with the regions of the North Sea and the Caribbean Sea, where disputes are solved or minimized. These factors are represented by six variables, which are based on three theories: a realist, idealist and constructivist theory of international relations.

It is followed by a description of three case areas. The second part deals with the theoretical foundations of the examined factors. In [...] ...|$|R
