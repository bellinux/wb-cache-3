US 13 intersects the eastern {{terminus}} of MD 640 (Revells Neck Road), which heads west to serve the Eastern Correctional Institution.

500|$|Following the {{appointment}} of Stoltenberg's Second Cabinet in 2005, the government started working with longer projects and increased funding. The go-ahead for the project was given by Minister of Transport Liv Signe Navarsete on 31 March 2008, with the entire project from Barkåker to Tønsberg estimated to cost 1.37 billion Norwegian krone (NOK). The main civil engineering advisor for the project was Norconsult.

The contract was awarded on 5 March 2009 to Reinertsen/Leonard Nilsen, who had the lowest bid, NOK377.9 million, NOK158 million less than the most expensive, from Mika. The joint venture was structured so Leonard Nilsen built the tunnel and Reinertsen the above-ground section.|$|E

500|$|Passenger {{traffic was}} {{the main source of}} revenue for the GWR when it first opened but goods were also carried in {{separate}} trains. It was not until the coal-mining and industrial districts of Wales and the Midlands were reached that goods traffic became significant; in 1856 the Ruabon Coal Company signed an agreement with the GWR to transport coal to London at special rates which nonetheless was worth at least £40,000 each year to the railway. As locomotives increased in size so did the length of goods trains, from 40 to as many as 100 four-wheeled wagons, although the gradient of the line often limited this. While typical goods wagons could carry 8, 10 or (later) 12 tons, the load placed into a wagon could be as little as 1 ton. The many smaller consignments were sent to a local transhipment centre where they were re-sorted into larger loads for the <b>main</b> <b>segment</b> of their journey. There were more than 550 [...] "station truck" [...] workings running on timetabled goods trains carrying small consignments to and from specified stations, and 200 [...] "pick up" [...] trucks that collected small loads from groups of stations.|$|E

Continuing east, the road reaches a cloverleaf interchange with US 206. After US 206, I-95 comes to a northbound ramp to CR 546 before coming to a partial cloverleaf interchange at Princeton Pike (CR 583).

This road, which is maintained by the New Jersey Turnpike Authority, is not signed as part of I-95 but rather as the New Jersey Turnpike or as I-276 from the mainline New Jersey Turnpike. Continuing east through rural areas into Florence Township, the highway has an interchange serving US 130. [...] This interchange has a toll plaza on the ramp to southbound I-95. After this interchange, the road comes to a toll barrier that {{marks the beginning of}} the turnpike ticket system northbound {{and the end of the}} ticket system southbound.
