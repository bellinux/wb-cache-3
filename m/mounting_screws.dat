50|$|Many chucks have {{removable}} jaws (often the {{top part}} is removable leaving the base or 'master jaw' assembled with the scroll), {{which allows the}} user to replace them with new jaws, specialized jaws, or soft jaws. Soft jaws are made of soft materials such as soft (unhardened) metal, plastic, or wood. They can be machined as needed for particular setups.

5000|$|Many modern tripods are {{constructed}} of aluminum, though wood is still used for legs. The feet are either aluminum tipped with a steel point or steel. The <b>mounting</b> <b>screw</b> is often brass or brass and plastic. The <b>mounting</b> <b>screw</b> is hollow {{to allow the}} optical plumb to be viewed through the screw. The top is typically threaded with a 5/8" [...] x 11 tpi <b>screw</b> thread. The <b>mounting</b> <b>screw</b> is held to {{the underside of the}} tripod head by a movable arm. This permits the screw to be moved anywhere within the head's opening. The legs are attached to the head with adjustable screws that are usually kept tight enough to allow the legs to be moved with a bit of resistance. The legs are two part, with the lower part capable of telescoping to adjust the length of the leg to suit the terrain. Aluminum or steel slip joints with a tightening screw are {{at the bottom of the}} upper leg to hold the bottom part in place and fix the length. A shoulder strap is often affixed to the tripod to allow for ease of carrying the equipment over areas to be surveyed.|$|R
5000|$|An M.2 module is {{installed}} into a mating connector {{provided by the}} host's circuit board, and a single <b>mounting</b> <b>screw</b> secures the module into place. Components may be mounted {{on either side of}} the module, with the actual module type limiting how thick the components can be; the maximum allowable thickness of components is 1.5 mm per side. Different host-side connectors are used for single- and double-sided M.2 modules, providing different amounts of space between the M.2 expansion card and the host's PCB. [...] Circuit boards on the hosts are usually designed to accept multiple lengths of M.2 modules, which means that the sockets capable of accepting longer M.2 modules usually also accept shorter ones by providing different positions for the <b>mounting</b> <b>screw.</b>|$|R

5000|$|In {{addition}} to iron support, {{another problem with}} the Bailey design was that the frog <b>mounting</b> <b>screws</b> were under the iron, so the iron and the cap iron must be removed in order to adjust {{the position of the}} frog. This adjustment is necessary to vary the opening at the [...] "mouth", which refers to the position of the iron in relation {{to the front of the}} slot in the sole, and which is used to control the size of shaving taken by the plane. The Bedrock design incorporated a new adjustment method, in which the entire frog could be wound forward or back, thus adjusting the mouth, without removing the blade.|$|E
50|$|A fixed {{rack mount}} monitor is mounted {{directly}} to the rack with the LCD visible at all times. The height of the unit is measured in rack units (RU) and 8U or 9U are most common to fit 17-inch or 19-inch LCDs. The front sides of the unit are provided with flanges to mount to the rack, providing appropriately spaced holes or slots for the rack <b>mounting</b> <b>screws.</b> A 19-inch diagonal LCD is the largest size that will fit within the rails of a 19-inch rack. Larger LCDs may be accommodated but are 'mount-on-rack' and extend forward of the rack. There are smaller display units, typically used in broadcast environments, which fit multiple smaller LCDs side by side into one rack mount.|$|E

Each Storm also {{includes a}} side rail with two <b>mounting</b> <b>screws,</b> a second can be purchased along with a bottom rail from the manufacturer. The contoured bottom rail is designed to attach under the two side rails. A top rail can also be purchased and installed with a tool {{that comes with the}} carbine.

The correct size drill bit needed for attaching the top rail is not included with the rifle or the top rail kit and has to be purchased separately. A maximum of five Picatinny rails can be utilized using Beretta accessory kits, or the user can use the two present at purchase to attach a number of optics, grips, lights, lasers, bipods etc. This firearm was designed to be very adaptable to customization.|$|E
5000|$|The Telecaster Bass was {{introduced}} in May 1968 being essentially a straight reissue of the original 1951 Precision Bass design (which was in fact influenced by the Telecaster guitar), with a large pickguard, small Telecaster-shaped headstock, single pickup, and separate chrome control plate. Early versions had a two-piece maple-capped neck with no [...] "skunk stripe" [...] {{on the back of}} the neck and some also had the rare paddle-style tuners that were most commonly seen on the Jazz Bass. The pickguard on the 1960s Telecaster Bass was slightly more slender and employed more <b>mounting</b> <b>screws</b> than the originals of the 1950s. There were also three different headstock decals in the early version. The earliest had a regular silver Telecaster guitar logo with the word [...] "bass" [...] added underneath. Only prototypes are known to have this decal. The earliest prototypes were partially constructed from leftover 1952 Precision Bass parts. The second decal was the larger Black (gold outlined) Telecaster Bass logo (bass being in the same style of script as Fender). The third and most commonly used decal had the silver Fender script with the words Telecaster Bass written in a sans-serif type font underneath.|$|E
50|$|Contrary {{to popular}} misconception, {{wobbling}} will not cause a ceiling fan to fall. Ceiling fans are secured by clevis pins locked with either split pins or R-clips, so wobbling won't {{have an effect}} on the fan's security, unless of course, the pins/clips were not secured. To date, there are no reports of a fan wobbling itself off the ceiling and falling. However, a severe wobble can cause light fixture shades or covers to gradually loosen over time and potentially fall, posing a risk of injury to anyone under the fan, and also from any resulting broken glass. It is also worth mentioning that when the MythBusters were designing a fan with the goal of chopping off someone's head, Scottie used an edge finder to find the exact center of their blades with the aim of eliminating potentially very dangerous wobbling of their steel blades. It is important that, when installing the fan, the installer closely follows the manufacturer's instructions with regard to using proper <b>mounting</b> <b>screws.</b> It is also important that all screws (especially the set screws which hold twist-on downrods in place) be tight, and any ceiling fan light fixtures are properly assembled with their shades and covers securely attached.|$|E
