5|$|Different endings are {{possible}} {{based on the}} choice the player makes. The endings all involve a battle with the T. rex and escaping the island via a watercraft or helicopter. Regina survives in all endings but depending on the ending, other characters <b>may</b> <b>die.</b> If Regina chases Kirk, Gail reveals that the whole mission was a front and {{the government did not}} want Kirk, but instead wanted the Third Energy to use in warfare.|$|E
5|$|During Eliza's escape, {{she meets}} {{up with her}} husband George Harris, who had run away previously. They decide to attempt to reach Canada. However, they are tracked by a slave hunter named Tom Loker. Eventually Loker and his men trap Eliza and her family, causing George to shoot him in the side. Worried that Loker <b>may</b> <b>die,</b> Eliza convinces George to bring the slave hunter to a nearby Quaker {{settlement}} for medical treatment.|$|E

5|$|The tree {{may also}} be {{attacked}} by the horse chestnut scale insect (Pulvinaria regalis) which sucks sap from the trunk and branches, but does not cause serious damage to the tree. Sometimes squirrels will strip the bark off branches, girdling the stem; as a result whole branches <b>may</b> <b>die,</b> leaving brown, wilted leaves.|$|E
5|$|Koalas {{may live}} from 13 to 18 {{years in the}} wild. While female koalas usually live this long, males <b>may</b> <b>die</b> sooner because of their more {{hazardous}} lives. Koalas usually survive falls from trees and immediately climb back up, but injuries and deaths from falls do occur, particularly in inexperienced young and fighting males. Around six years of age, the koala's chewing teeth begin to wear down and their chewing efficiency decreases. Eventually, the cusps disappear completely and the animal will die of starvation.|$|E
5|$|The badnjak {{should not}} be jumped over or trodden upon, and blowing on its fire is avoided. It {{should not be}} moved when about to burn through, lest the log break at the place most {{consumed}} by the fire, which is usually strongest {{at the center of}} the fireplace; the separation of the log should be a result of the fire only. None of the family members should fall asleep before the log splits, otherwise some of them <b>may</b> <b>die</b> in the coming year, without warning.|$|E

5|$|The most {{recognized}} {{marker of}} acute Chagas disease is called Romaña's sign, which includes {{swelling of the}} eyelids {{on the side of}} the face near the bite wound or where the bug feces were deposited or accidentally rubbed into the eye. Rarely, young children, or adults <b>may</b> <b>die</b> from the acute disease due to severe inflammation/infection of the heart muscle (myocarditis) or brain (meningoencephalitis). The acute phase also can be severe in people with weakened immune systems.|$|E
5|$|Other than parasites and disease, {{predation}} is {{a threat}} to sheep and the profitability of sheep raising. Sheep have little ability to defend themselves, compared with other species kept as livestock. Even if sheep survive an attack, they <b>may</b> <b>die</b> from their injuries or simply from panic. However, the impact of predation varies dramatically with region. In Africa, Australia, the Americas, and parts of Europe and Asia predators are a serious problem. In the United States, for instance, over one third of sheep deaths in 2004 were caused by predation. In contrast, other nations are virtually devoid of sheep predators, particularly islands known for extensive sheep husbandry. Worldwide, canids—including the domestic dog—are responsible for most sheep deaths. Other animals that occasionally prey on sheep include: felines, bears, birds of prey, ravens and feral hogs.|$|E
5|$|The Pacific swift has a {{very large}} range, {{exceeding}} 10,000,000km2 (3,800,000mi2). Its population is unknown, although it is common throughout its breeding range with {{no evidence of any}} decline. It is therefore classified by the International Union for Conservation of Nature as being of least concern. There appear to be no significant threats to this bird; predation is low, and this swift is not tied to a particular habitat. Some birds <b>may</b> <b>die</b> through misadventure or become exhausted when lost on migration (the first record for the Western Palaearctic was found resting on a North Sea gas platform), but swifts have high survival rates and are generally long-lived. The common swift, a close relative of the Pacific swift, has been recorded as reaching 21years old.|$|E

5|$|There are {{side effects}} and risks {{associated}} with the smallpox vaccine. In the past, about 1 out of 1,000 people vaccinated {{for the first time}} experienced serious, but non-life-threatening, reactions, including toxic or allergic reaction {{at the site of the}} vaccination (erythema multiforme), spread of the vaccinia virus to other parts of the body, and to other individuals. Potentially life-threatening reactions occurred in 14 to 500 people out of every 1 million people vaccinated for the first time. Based on past experience, it is estimated that 1 or 2 people in 1 million (0.000198 percent) who receive the vaccine <b>may</b> <b>die</b> as a result, most often the result of postvaccinial encephalitis or severe necrosis in the area of vaccination (called progressive vaccinia).|$|E
5|$|Truman {{seems to}} recover, {{but the next}} day, the {{producers}} find Truman sleeping in his basement. Marlon is sent to check on Truman, only to find he has disappeared through a makeshift tunnel. Marlon breaks character, and Christof orders the first transmission cut in the show's history while a citywide search for Truman is launched, going to such extreme measures as causing the artificial sun to rise hours ahead of schedule. Audiences {{around the world are}} drawn to this sudden change. Truman is found sailing out of Seahaven, having conquered his fear of water, and Christof resumes the broadcast as he sends a man-made lightning storm to try to capsize the boat. Network executives fear that Truman <b>may</b> <b>die</b> on live television, but Truman manages to persist. Realizing he cannot dissuade Truman any further, Christof ends the storm.|$|E
5|$|The tree {{has survived}} {{for so long}} due to {{vegetative}} cloning. The visible tree is relatively young, but {{it is part of}} an older root system that dates back thousands of years. The trunk of the tree <b>may</b> <b>die</b> and regrow multiple times, but the tree's root system remains intact and in turn sprouts another trunk. The trunk may only live for about 600 years, and when one trunk dies another eventually grows back in its place. Also, each winter, heavy snow may push the tree's low-lying branches to ground level, where they take root and survive to grow again the next year in a process known as layering. Layering occurs when a tree's branch comes in contact with the earth, and new roots sprout from the contact point. Other trees, such as coast redwoods and western redcedars are known to reproduce by layering. The tree's age was determined by carbon-14 dating of the root system, which found roots dating back to 375, 5,660, 9,000, and 9,550 years. Carbon dating is not accurate enough to pin down the exact year the tree sprouted from seed; but, given the estimated age, the tree is supposed to have sprouted around 7550 BC. For comparison, the invention of writing (and thus, the beginning of recorded history) did not occur until around 4000 BC. Researchers have found a cluster of around 20 spruce trees in the same area, all over 8,000 years old.|$|E

5|$|Jacqui meets divorcee Tony and an {{attraction}} igniting, they have sex. Tony goes away on holiday and starts {{a relationship with}} Jacqui on his return. Jacqui violates her prison tag after staying at Tony's house overnight so she is sent back to prison. Sadly, Tony is forced to dump her because he cannot handle the pressure. Jacqui befriends Becca Dean (Ali Bastian) but Becca is killed by another prisoner and Jacqui is devastated. Jacqui decides {{to make something of}} herself, not wanting to waste her life and is reunited with Tony and Davey returns with the favour. He forces Jacqui to marry Aleksander Malota (Jon Lolis). Jacqui and Aleksander manage to convince an immigration officer that their romance is genuine and they are married but Jacqui continues her affair with Tony secretly. The family uncover the truth about the marriage when Carmel and Alek's affair is revealed. Jacqui admits she married Alek to pay off her debt to Davey and is seeing Tony. Myra McQueen (Nicole Barber-Lane) is furious and orders Jacqui, Alek and Carmel to leave the house. Jacqui announces her pregnancy; Tony initially doesn't want the child, fearing that it <b>may</b> <b>die</b> like his previous child and their dreams are shattered when Jacqui miscarries and is left unable to have children of her own. Tony attacks Alek violently as he blames Alek as he cannot grieve for his baby publicly. Tony announces to the people in The Dog that the baby was his, not Alek's and Jacqui asks Alek to return to Albania so she can live her life and he agrees. Carmel is shocked to discover Alek is leaving, leaving Carmel devastated. Depressed, Jacqui returns to her old habit of shop lifting, so Neville Ashworth (Jim Millea) gets her locked up for the night.|$|E
5|$|The white-bellied sea eagle usually chooses {{tall trees}} or {{man-made}} pylons to nest in. Often, locations are sought {{where there is}} a tall dead tree or high branch with good visibility which {{can be used as a}} perch to survey the surrounding area, which is generally a low-lying locale near water with some forest cover. The perch becomes covered in faeces and pellets and animal remains litter the immediate surrounding area. The nest is a large deep bowl constructed of sticks and branches, and lined with such materials as grass or seaweed. Yearly renovations result in nests getting gradually bigger. Nests are generally sited in the forks of large trees overlooking bodies of water. Old nests of wedge-tailed eagles or whistling kites have been renovated and used. Cliffs are also suitable nesting sites, and on islands nests are sometimes built directly on the ground. A breeding pair, with the male being more active, spends three to six weeks building or renovating the nest before laying eggs. Normally a clutch of two dull, white, oval eggs are laid. Measuring 73×55mm, they are incubated over six weeks before hatching. The young are semi-altricial, and covered in white down when they emerge from the egg. Initially, the male brings food and the female feeds the chicks, but both parents feed the chicks as they grow larger. Although two eggs are laid, it is unusual for two young to be reared successfully to fledging (leaving the nest). One egg may be infertile, or the second chick <b>may</b> <b>die</b> in the nest. If the first clutch is lost, the parents may attempt a second brood. Nestlings have been recorded fledging when 70 to 80 days old, and remaining around the parents' territory for up to six months or until the following breeding season.|$|E
