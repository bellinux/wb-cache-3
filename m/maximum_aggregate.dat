This top level surface permitted a smoother shape and protected the larger stones in the road structure from iron wheels and horse hooves. To keep the running surface level with the countryside, this road was put in a trench, which created drainage problems.

In cognitive radio systems, two types of users (SU and PU) and the mutual interference between them should be considered. The use of the power allocation based on conventional waterfilling algorithm is not always efficient. An additional constraint should be introduced due to the interference caused by the sidelobes in different subcarriers. The transmit power of each subcarrier should be adjusted according to the channel status and the location of the subcarrier with respect to the PU spectrum.|$|R

The efficiency of any such meta-heuristic techniques lies with their rate of convergence and execution time.

Repayment of a revolving loan is achieved either by scheduled reductions in {{the total amount of}} the loan over time, or by all outstanding loans being repaid on the date of termination.

50|$|The primary {{difference}} in placing SMA, compared to DGA is in compaction procedures. Multi-tyred rollers {{are not used}} due to the possible working of binder-rich material {{to the surface of}} the asphalt and consequent flushing and pick-up. Trafficking of the newly placed asphalt while still warm may have the same effect and it is generally preferable for surfaces to cool below about 40°C before opening to traffic. The preferred method of compaction is to use heavy, non-vibrating, steel-wheeled rollers. If these are not available, vibrating rollers may be used but vibrationshould be kept to a minimum to avoid fracture of coarse aggregate particles, or drawing of binder {{to the surface of the}} mix. The use of polymer modified binder may decrease mix workability and necessitate increased compactive effort to achieve high standards of compacted density. Achieving high standards of compacted density and low field air voids has been identified as an important factor in the performance of all SMA work. SMA is normally placed with a minimum layer thickness of 2.5 to 3 times the nominal <b>maximum</b> <b>aggregate</b> particle size. Greater layer thicknesses assist in achieving appropriate standards of compacted density.|$|E
50|$|In digital {{wireless}} networks, {{the system}} spectral efficiency or area spectral efficiency is typically measured in (bit/s)/Hz per unit area, in (bit/s)/Hz per cell, or in (bit/s)/Hz per site. It {{is a measure}} of the quantity of users or services that can be simultaneously supported by a limited radio frequency bandwidth in a defined geographic area. It may for example be defined as the <b>maximum</b> <b>aggregated</b> throughput or goodput, i.e. summed over all users in the system, divided by the channel bandwidth. This measure is affected not only by the single user transmission technique, but also by multiple access schemes and radio resource management techniques utilized. It can be substantially improved by dynamic radio resource management. If it is defined as a measure of the maximum goodput, retransmissions due to co-channel interference and collisions are excluded. Higher-layer protocol overhead (above the media access control sublayer) is normally neglected.|$|R
30|$|In this article, we jointly {{consider}} {{the problem of}} efficient power control and coverage (PCC) management over an integrated two-tier macrocell/femtocell network towards maximizing the expected throughput of the system subject to appropriate power constraints, under the existence of both co-tier and cross-tier interferences. Optimal network design amounts to joint optimization of users’ allocated power levels and cell’s <b>maximum</b> <b>aggregated</b> downlink transmitted power, i.e., coverage area management. This problem is inherently difficult because {{it is in fact}} a non-convex optimization problem. A novel approach to address the latter is performed that entails a suitable transformation, which allows the use of convex optimization and also forms the basis for the design of a distributed PCC algorithm via performing two-level primal-dual decomposition. PCC algorithm’s convergence to optimality is established. We demonstrate that for realistic macrocell/femtocell deployment scenarios, overall system throughput increase up to approximately 50 % can be achieved while guaranteeing 70 % of power savings.|$|R

User equipment (UE) may simultaneously receive or transmit data on one or multiple CCs, whereas in the 3 GPP R 8 specifications [4], each UE uses only one CC to communicate at one time.
