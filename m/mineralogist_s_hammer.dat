To an extent, existing business process modeling tools (Spurr et al. 1994) provide features to analyze business processes.

40|$|Adverse {{clinical}} outcomes {{have been associated}} with cumulative anticholinergic burden (to which low-potency as well as high-potency anticholinergic medicines contribute). The clinical indications for which anticholinergic medicines are prescribed (and thus the 'phenotype' of patients with anticholinergic burden) have not been established. We sought to establish the overall prevalence of prescribing of anticholinergic medicines, the prevalence of prescribing of low-, medium- and high-potency anticholinergic medicines, and the clinical indications for which the medicines were prescribed in an older primary care population. This was a cross-sectional analysis of a cohort study of Australian early-career general practitioners' (GPs') clinical consultations - the Registrar Clinical Encounters in Training (ReCEnT) study. In ReCEnT, GPs collect detailed data (including medicines prescribed and their clinical indication) for 60 consecutive patients, on up to three occasions 6 months apart. Anticholinergic medicines were categorized as levels 1 (low-potency) to 3 (high-potency) using the Anticholinergic Drug Scale (ADS). During 2010 - 2014, 879 early-career GPs (across five of Australia's six states) conducted 20 555 consultations with patients aged 65 years or older, representing 35 506 problems/diagnoses. Anticholinergic medicines were prescribed in 10 · 4 % [95 % CIs 9 · 5 - 10 · 5] of consultations. Of the total anticholinergic load of prescribed medicines ('community anticholinergic load') 72 · 7 % [95 % CIs 71 · 0 - 74 · 3] was contributed by Level 1 medicines, 0 · 8 % [95 % CIs 0 · 5 - 1 · 3] by Level 2 medicines and 26 · 5 % [95 % CIs 24 · 8 - 28 · 1] by Level 3 medicines. Cardiac (40 · 0 %), Musculoskeletal (16 · 9 %) and Respiratory (10 · 6 %) were the most common indications associated with Level 1 anticholinergic prescription. For Level 2 and 3 medicines (combined data), Psychological (16 · 1 %), Neurological (16 · 1 %), Musculoskeletal (15 · 7 %) and Urological (11 · 1 %) indications were most common. Anticholinergic medicines are frequently prescribed in Australian general practice, and the majority of the 'community' anticholinergic burden is contributed by 'low'-anticholinergic potency medicines whose anticholinergic effects may be largely 'invisible' to prescribing GPs. Furthermore, the clinical 'phenotype' of the patient with high anticholinergic burden may be very different to common stereotypes (patients with urological, psychological or neurological problems), potentially making recognition of risk of anticholinergic adverse effects additionally problematic for GPs.

Physiological Reports, 4 (7), 1 - 10. doi: 10. 14814 /phy 2. 12748 N-acetylcysteine (NAC; antioxidant and thiol donor) supplementation has improved exercise performance and delayed fatigue, but the underlying mechanisms are unknown. One possibility is NAC supplementation increases limb blood flow during severe-intensity exercise. The purpose {{was to determine if}} NAC supplementation affected exercising arm blood flow and muscle oxygenation characteristics. We hypothesized that NAC would lead to higher limb blood flow and lower muscle deoxygenation characteristics during severe-intensity exercise. Eight healthy nonendurance trained men (21. 8 ± 1. 2 years) were recruited and completed two constant power handgrip exercise tests at 80 % peak power until exhaustion. Subjects orally consumed either placebo (PLA) or NAC (70 mg/kg) 60 min prior to handgrip exercise. Immediately prior to exercise, venous blood samples were collected for determination of plasma redox balance. Brachial artery blood flow (BABF) was measured via Doppler ultrasound and flexor digitorum superficialis oxygenation characteristics were measured via near-infrared spectroscopy. Following NAC supplementaiton, plasma cysteine (NAC: 47. 2 ± 20. 3 ?mol/L vs. PLA: 9. 6 ± 1. 2 ?mol/L; P = 0. 001) and total cysteine (NAC: 156. 2 ± 33. 9 ?mol/L vs. PLA: 132. 2 ± 16. 3 ?mol/L; P = 0. 048) increased. Time to exhaustion was not significantly different (P = 0. 55) between NAC (473. 0 ± 62. 1 sec) and PLA (438. 7 ± 58. 1 sec). Resting BABF was not different (P = 0. 79) with NAC (99. 3 ± 31. 1 mL/min) and PLA (108. 3 ± 46. 0 mL/min). BABF was not different (P = 0. 42) during exercise or at end-exercise (NAC: 413 ± 109 mL/min; PLA: 445 ± 147 mL/min). Deoxy-[hemoglobin+myoglobin] and total-[hemoglobin+myoglobin] were not significantly different (P = 0. 73 and P = 0. 54, respectively) at rest or during exercise between conditions. We conclude that acute NAC supplementation does not alter oxygen delivery during exercise in men. © 2016 Published by the American Physiological Society and The Physiological Society...|$|R

40|$|The {{present study}} is {{concerned}} with placing the American hard-boiled detective hero—and Raymond Chandler 2 ̆ 7 s Philip Marlowe in particular—within a context of a critique of American individualism. Whereas earlier and contemporary hardboiled detectives display the self-sufficient, self-aggrandizing traits of classic rugged American individualism, Marlowe possesses a more socially conscious code of ethics and a quality of reflection geared toward democratic consideration of the thoughts, beliefs, and ethics of the clients, criminals, and cops with whom he identifies. Where rugged individualist private eyes, such as Dashiell Hammett 2 ̆ 7 s Continental Op and Mickey Spillane 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> Mike <b>Hammer,</b> cut themselves off from society and arrogate to themselves the power to judge and condemn others, Marlowe connects members of society that would normally not meet or would be irrevocably antagonistic upon meeting, and prefers negotiation among warring factions over violence. In doing so he reflects the reformation of {{the ideology of the}} autonomous individual insisted upon by John Dewey: Chandler 2 ̆ 7 s hero is a “new” individual inasmuch as he is willing to learn from others, valorizes cooperative action and rigorously monitors and criticizes his own actions. The introduction situates Marlowe historically and generically in the dizzyingly diverse world of crime fiction and, in answer to critics who view him as a socially aloof, quietist, even reactionary figure, emphasizes his liberal credentials. Chapter two defines Marlowe 2 ̆ 7 s role as a peacemaker and negotiator, and traces the history of individualism in the United States in order to understand this hero 2 ̆ 7 s actions. The third chapter focuses on his interactions with duly constituted law enforcement officials, underscoring the value of the private detective as a critic of corrupt law enforcement. In chapter four the focus shifts to Marlowe 2 ̆ 7 s dealings with members of the underworld and it problematizes the accepted (simplistic) definitions of legitimate and illegitimate activity. The conclusion reiterates the emphasis on non-violence and underscores Marlowe 2 ̆ 7 s ability to influence others to perform communal acts. It recognizes the use of the metaphor of social groups as anomic circles and Marlowe 2 ̆ 7 s willingness to work within and across them, Suggesting, in Deweyan fashion, that forging a better society depends on face-to-face association. ...|$|R

It {{has been}} suggested that the ability of prohormones to self associate and form aggregates may be responsible for the sorting process at the trans-Golgi. To examine whether insulin oligomerization is required for proper sorting into regulated storage granules, we have constructed point mutations in human insulin B chain that have been previously shown to prevent formation of insulin hexamers (Brange, J., U.

40|$|Philosophiae Doctor - PhDThe Ruschieae is {{the most}} diverse and speciose tribe within the large {{subfamily}} Ruschioideae (Aizoaceae), with approximately 71 genera and a distribution centred in the arid parts of the Greater Cape Floristic Region (GCFR) of South Africa. Recent phylogenetic analyses provided the first insights into generic relationships within the tribe, {{with a number of}} novel generic relationships discovered. The tribal phylogeny recovered 12 large clades, of which the Conophytum-clade was one the most morphologically diverse based on leaf and capsule characters. The Conophytum-clade is an early-diverging lineage of the Ruschieae and includes the following 10 genera: Cheiridopsis N. E. Br., Conophytum N. E. Br., Enarganthe N. E. Br., Ihlenfeldtia H. E. K. Hartmann, Jensenobotrya A. G. J. Herre, Namaquanthus L. Bolus, Octopoma N. E. Br., Odontophorus N. E. Br., Ruschianthus L. Bolus and Schlechteranthus Schwantes. The present study presents an expanded phylogenetic analysis of the Conophytum-clade, with the sampling of the majority of species in the genera and a representative sampling (56 % of species) of the speciose genus Conophytum. Phylogenetic data for up to nine plastid gene regions (atpB–rbcL, matK, psbJ–petA, rpl 16, rps 16, trnD– trnT, trnL–F, trnQᶷᶷᶢ–rps 16, trnS–trnG) were produced for each of the sampled species. The produced plastid data was analyses using maximum parsimony, maximum likelihood and Bayesian inference. The combined plastid phylogenetic analyses were used in combination with morphological, anatomical and palynological data to assess generic and subgeneric circumscriptions within the clade. Upon assessment of generic circumscriptions in the Conophytum-clade, the number of recognised genera in the clade decreased from ten to seven. Arenifera A. G. J. Herre, which had not been sampled in any phylogeny of the Ruschieae, and Octopoma were recovered as polyphyletic, with species placed in the Conophytum-clade, while the type species was placed in the xeromorphic clade of the tribal phylogeny. The species of Arenifera and Octopoma placed in the Conophytum-clade were subsequently included in Schlechteranthus upon assessment of generic circumscriptions between the taxa. Two morphological groupings were recognised within Schlechteranthus, one including the species of Schlechteranthus and the other including species previously recognised as Arenifera and Octopoma. These two morphological groupings were treated as subgenera, with the erection of the new subgenus Microphyllus R. F. Powell. A detailed taxonomic revision of subgenus Microphyllus is presented with a key to species, descriptions of the species (including a new species: S. parvus R. F. Powell & Klak), known geographical distributions and illustrations of the species. In addition to the changes mentioned above, the expanded sampling and phylogenetic analyses of the Conophytum-clade recovered Ihlenfeldtia and Odontophorus embedded in Cheiridopsis. The species of Ihlenfeldtia were recovered with species of heiridopsis subgenus Aequifoliae H. E. K. Hartmann, while the species of Odontophorus were recovered as polyphyletic within the Cheiridopsis subgenus Odontophoroides H. E. K. Hartmann clade. Cheiridopsis was subsequently expanded to include the species of Ihlenfeldtia and Odontophorus, with these species accommodated in the subgenera of Cheiridopsis. The phylogenetic placement and relationship of these species was supported by the shared capsule morphology. The expanded sampling of the clade did not resolve the phylogenetic relationship of the monotypic genera Enarganthe, Jensenobotrya, Namaquanthus and Ruschianthus, with these genera unresolved in the Conophytum-clade. These genera however, exhibit a unique combination of morphological characters, such as a glabrous leaf epidermis and variation in pollen exine and colpi structure, in contrast to the other genera of the clade. The assessment of the generic circumscription of these genera, based on the molecular, morphological, anatomical and palynological data suggested that the generic statuses of these monotypic genera should be maintained. The expanded phylogenetic sampling of the morphologically diverse and speciose genus Conophytum recovered the genus as monophyletic. This monophyly was supported by the unique floral type in Conophytum, with the fused petaloid staminodes forming a tube. None of the sectional classifications were recovered as monophyletic but the phylogenetic analyses did recover a few clades which more or less corresponded to the current sectional classification of the genus. A number of clades were also recovered which included species from a range of different sections. Diverse leaf and floral traits were shown to have evolved numerous times across the genus. This was particularly interesting with regards to the selected floral traits, as the phylogeny indicated a number of switches in floral morphologies across the genus. The floral diversity was assessed in complex species communities of Conophytum across the GCFR, where up to 11 species of Conophytum are found occurring sympatrically, and floral traits were shown to be different across the species within the communities. Pollination competition and adaptation were suggested as possible drivers of floral diversity in the genus, with differences in phenology, anthesis and floral morphology within the species complex communities. The unique floral type of Conophytum has enabled the species to develop a diverse range of specialised flowers, with a variety of structures, scents and colours, resulting in the diverse floral morphologies found across the genus. The complex Conophytum species communities included both closely as well as distantly related species, suggesting the soft papery capsules of Conophytum are wind dispersed. This adaptation to long distance seed dispersal resulted in a significantly higher phylogenetic diversity in Conophytum when compared to its sister genus, Cheiridopsis. A population genetics study of Conophytum also suggested that the capsules may be wind dispersed, with an indication of genetic connectivity between the geographically isolated populations of C. marginatum Lavis across the Bushmanland Inselberg Region. Although the capsules are dispersed by wind, the seeds are released from the hygrochastic capsules by runoff during rainfall events. The relationship between seed dispersal and runoff is evident from the genetic structure of populations of C. maughanii N. E. Br. and C. ratum <b>S.</b> A. <b>Hammer</b> that occur on the tops and the surrounding bases of the inselbergs, as the drainage pattern was found to directly influence population structure in these species. In addition, the AFLP analyses provided insight into the conservation of the flagship species C. ratum. The summit populations of this species were shown to sustain the populations {{at the base of the}} Gamsberg. This finding is especially important, as the distribution of the species is restricted to the Gamsberg inselberg, where mining has already commenced as of this year.
