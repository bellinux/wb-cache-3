5|$|In 1909 {{part of the}} {{woodland}} was {{donated to}} the National Trust by the tobacco company owner George Alfred Wills. He did this to prevent housing development {{on the western side}} of the gorge as Bristol grew in size and population.

Areas not owned by the National Trust have since been taken over by the Forestry Commission.|$|E

5|$|During the Second World War, Clifton High School was {{relocated}} to the property, and in 1941 the U.S. Army Medical Corps established a facility for wounded soldiers, {{known as the}} 74th General Hospital, in the estate grounds. The construction of this temporary tented village resulted in the US Army Engineers breaching what was then England's longest holly hedge. With many tents later replaced by prefabricated buildings and some nissen huts, {{at one point in}} the war following D-Day it became the largest US Army hospital in Europe. During the hostilities, management of the estate's farmland was assumed by the <b>Ministry</b> <b>of</b> <b>Agriculture</b> (MoA), leaving Lady Wraxall only the Home Farm.|$|E

5|$|Historically, Deir Ghassaneh {{depended}} {{primarily on}} olive cultivation, {{and until the}} present day most of Bani Zeid's cultivable land is covered by olive orchards. The cultivation of other fruit trees is significantly lower, with almonds being a distant second at 240 dunams. Other crops grown include grains which cover 135 dunams and onions, dry legumes and fodder to a lesser degree. Only 1% of the town's residents own livestock {{and according to the}} Palestinian <b>Ministry</b> <b>of</b> <b>Agriculture,</b> there were 1,880 goats, 268 sheep, 12 cows and 281 beehives in Bani Zeid in 2009. Agriculture currently accounts for 10% of labor in the town.|$|E
5|$|In 1996, the Castillonnais {{was officially}} {{recognized}} by the French <b>Ministry</b> <b>of</b> <b>Agriculture,</b> due {{to the efforts of}} a small number of breed enthusiasts, though by that time only 50 purebred mares remained. The breed association's name was changed to L’association Nationale du Cheval Castillonnais d'Ariège Pyrénées (ANCCAP) (National Association of Castillonnais Horses of the Ariège Pyrenees), and is headquartered in Castillon-en-Couserans. Le Conservatoire du Patrimoine Biologique Régional de Midi-Pyrénées (Conservatory of the Biological Heritage of the Midi-Pyrénées Region), an organization that has worked to protect the diversity of animal species in the region since 1980, is also committed to protecting the breed.|$|E
5|$|Richard John Charles Tomlinson {{was born}} in Hamilton, New Zealand, {{and raised in the}} nearby town of Ngaruawahia. He was the middle child in a family of three brothers. His father came from a Lancashire farming family and he worked for the <b>Ministry</b> <b>of</b> <b>Agriculture,</b> and had met his wife whilst {{studying}} agriculture at Newcastle University. The family moved to Cumbria, England in 1968. The young Tomlinson won a scholarship for the independent Barnard Castle School in County Durham, where he was a contemporary of Rory Underwood and Rob Andrew, who went on to become England rugby internationals. He excelled at mathematics and physics, and won a scholarship to Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, in 1981.|$|E

5|$|Rocks mined for {{phosphate}} fertilizers contain varying {{amounts of}} cadmium, {{resulting in a}} cadmium concentration {{of as much as}} 300mg/kg in the fertilizers and a high cadmium content in agricultural soils. Coal can contain significant amounts of cadmium, which ends up mostly in flue dust. Cadmium in soil can be absorbed by crops grown on the land such as in rice. Chinese <b>ministry</b> <b>of</b> <b>agriculture</b> officials have measured in 2002 that 28% of rice it sampled had excess of lead and 10% had an excess of cadmium above limited defined by law. Some plants such as willow trees and poplars have been found to clean both lead and cadmium from soil.|$|E
5|$|The lack {{of numbers}} and {{political}} {{isolation of the}} country at the time caused {{the creation of a new}} breed quite distinct from the former English style toy dog as breeders sought to stabilise the remaining toy sized terriers into a standard breed. The resulting contemporary Russian Toy has most of the features of the classic toy terrier, with the addition of some new characteristics. The head is high but not wide, the cheeks are flat and the eyes are round. By 1960, 76 dogs were entered into an exhibition and the first standard for the two Russian Toy varieties was written in 1966 and authorized by the <b>Ministry</b> <b>of</b> <b>Agriculture.</b>|$|E
5|$|During the 1850s, Inhaúma held {{a series}} of bureaucratic positions. He entered {{politics}} in 1861 {{as a member of the}} Conservative Party. He became a cabinet member and was given the position of navy minister. Inhaúma also became the first person to hold the <b>Ministry</b> <b>of</b> <b>Agriculture</b> portfolio, albeit briefly. The first professional firefighter corps in Brazil was formed during his tenure as agriculture minister. In late 1866, Inhaúma was appointed commander-in-chief of the fleet engaged in the Paraguayan War. During the fighting, he achieved the rank of admiral, the highest in the Brazilian armada. He was also awarded a noble title, eventually being raised from baron to viscount. In 1868, he was elected to the national legislature's lower house, but never assumed office.|$|E
5000|$|Institutional factors: {{typically}} SWAps in {{the agricultural}} sector are managed by Ministries <b>of</b> <b>Agriculture.</b> However, in most countries, the ministries fail to mobilise other actors relevant to the agricultural sector and hence to a sector-wide approach. There is also a tendency for <b>ministries</b> <b>of</b> <b>agriculture</b> to adopt an interventionist approach to policy and resist influence from outside the ministry.|$|R
50|$|In 1953 he was {{appointed}} director <b>of</b> the <b>Ministry</b> <b>of</b> <b>Agriculture's</b> Economic Department. Two years later {{he was elected to}} the Knesset on the Mapai list.

Paton was also the British {{representative}} on the committee of the International Commission on Large Dams between 1966 and 1973. From 1968 to 1970 he was chairman of the National Economic Development Council's working party on large industrial construction sites and from 1969 to 1974 was a member of the Natural Environment Research Council. Paton was vice-chairman of the Council of Engineering Institutions from 1971 to 1972 and chairman for 1972 to 1973. From 1974 to 1979 he was chairman of the <b>Ministry</b> <b>of</b> <b>Agriculture,</b> Fisheries and Food flood protection research committee. Paton was also a member emeritus of the Smeatonian Society of Civil Engineers and served as their president in 1980.|$|E
5|$|In 1947, Vojvodina's <b>Ministry</b> <b>of</b> <b>Agriculture</b> {{complained to}} Serbia's Ministry of Forestry that the {{authorities}} in Vukovar refused to hand over four river islands, and then to Croatia's Ministry of Forestry regarding the same matter, asking for assistance. After Croatia refused the request, the Serbian authorities turned to the federal government. The federal authorities advised resolving the matter through mutual agreement and said that Vojvodina's interpretation of the law on its borders—that the border runs along thalweg of the Danube valley, i.e. along the river's midpoint—is erroneous because {{the law does not}} apply such wording. In a letter dated 18 April 1947, Yugoslav authorities said that the disputed river islands were the territory of Vukovar district and that the territory could not be transferred to Vojvodina before the border was defined otherwise.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the unrest in Sicily, a wave of rioting spread through Italy in August 1893, triggered by {{the killing of a}} number of migrant workers in the salt pans of Aigues Mortes in southern France escalated into a more generalized working-class revolt supported by anarchists and violent riots in Rome and Naples. Italy seemed to be slipping to a revolution. By the time Crispi returned to power in December 1893, Italy appeared to many to be on the brink of collapse. Crispi promised important measures of land reform for the near future. He was not blind to the misery and the need for social reform. Before 1891 he had been the patron of the Sicilian working-class and many of their associations had been named after him. Colajanni, the chief architect of Giolitti’s fall by exposing the Banca Romana scandal, was first offered the <b>Ministry</b> <b>of</b> <b>Agriculture,</b> which he refused, then sent to Sicily on a mission of appeasement.|$|E
