2500|$|Gwynn was {{hard-working}} and {{renowned for}} his work ethic and devotion to extra batting practice. On the road, he stayed in his hotel room, studying video of his at-bats or playing video games. In an era before laptops and tablets, Gwynn bought his own video equipment and lugged it {{from town to town}} along with tapes of his games. His wife traveled with a Betamax video cassette recorder that {{was the size of a}} suitcase to tape his at-bats. Still, the Padres were the last MLB team to hire a video coordinator. Gwynn later invested in close to $100,000 in video equipment that he shared with his teammates. Few hitters were as meticulous as Gwynn with his detailed notebooks and videotape, which he spent hours studying. He studied pitchers, watching them in the bullpen and on television or video, to learn their tendencies on every count. He spent hours watching video and analyzing his swing frame by frame. He had one tape of each team, which included his at-bats against that team in the season. [...] "Tony taught <b>me</b> <b>more</b> <b>about</b> hitting than I ever taught him", said Merv Rettenmund, his hitting coach for nine years with the Padres.|$|E
2500|$|The {{term was}} coined by Angular Records founder Joe Daniel and was {{featured}} on the [...] "An Angular Disco" [...] flyer used to advertise Klaxons's first gig. Klaxons later declared they were not new rave, describing it as a [...] "joke that's got out of hand" [...] and that the term was originally ironic, not serious. In reaction to the media overkill of the [...] "genre", Klaxons banned the use of glowsticks at their gigs in April 2007, saying that [...] "We kept getting asked to explain it. The whole idea of new rave {{was to take the}} piss out of the media by making them talk about something that didn't exist, just for our own amusement. And they'd say, I appreciate that, but can you tell <b>me</b> <b>more</b> <b>about</b> new rave?" [...] Los Angeles Times critic Margaret Wappler comments that the [...] "minimalist dance-punk of LCD Soundsystem, the analog classicism of Simian Mobile Disco, the fanatical electro-thrash of Justice, the international amalgam of M.I.A., the agitated funk of [...] (Chk Chk Chk) and the art-schooled disco-sleaze of Cansei de Ser Sexy" [...] contributed to the thriving 'new rave' dance scene, which led to a rediscovery of indie rockers, and a critical and intellectual revolution in dance music.|$|E
