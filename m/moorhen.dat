5|$|External parasites of the {{mistle thrush}} include the hen flea, the <b>moorhen</b> flea, the {{castor bean tick}} and the brightly {{coloured}} harvest mite. Internally, the thrush may be hosting tapeworms, nematodes, and Syngamus merulae a relative of the gapeworm. Blood parasites include Trypanosoma and Plasmodium species.|$|E
5|$|In autumn and winter, the {{extensive}} flood plain of the Shannon Callows supports {{a large number}} of waders, swans, wildfowl and other bird life. The most obvious of all Shannon birds is the mute swan. Also seen are the coot, <b>moorhen</b> and little grebe (or dabchick). The kingfisher is widespread as are the meadow pipit and pied wagtail. The area has one of the largest concentrations of breeding waders in Ireland including lapwing, redshank, sandpiper and godwit.|$|E
5|$|Predators of {{treecreeper}} nests {{and young}} include the great spotted woodpecker, red squirrel, and small mustelids, and predation {{is about three}} times higher in fragmented landscapes than in solid blocks of woodland (32.4% against 12.0% in less fragmented woodlands). The predation rate increases {{with the amount of}} forest edge close to a nest site, and also the presence of nearby agricultural land, in both cases probably because of a higher degree of mustelid predation. This species is parasitised in the nest by the <b>moorhen</b> flea, Dasypsyllus gallinulae. The juvenile survival rate of this species is unknown, but 47.7% of adults survive each year. The typical lifespan is two years, but the maximum recorded age is eightyears and tenmonths.|$|E
40|$|We {{determined}} which factors {{predict the}} presence and abundance of Dusky <b>Moorhens</b> (Gallinula tenebrosa) at wetlands by surveying the ecological and habitat characteristics of 62 sites across south-east Queensland. <b>Moorhens</b> were observed in 48 of the sites sampled. They {{were more likely to}} be found at sites surrounded by taller terrestrial vegetation and where free-floating and attached aquatic vegetation was more abundant. The number of <b>moorhens</b> found at a site increased in relation to vegetation height, the abundance of attached aquatic vegetation and the number of purple swamphens observed. These results suggest that there are ecological constraints on the distribution of <b>moorhens,</b> and that food abundance and the availability of suitable nesting sites determine the overall distribution and abundance of <b>moorhens</b> in wetlands. Adult <b>moorhens</b> develop brightly coloured fleshy frontal shields, bills and legs when breeding, although in some populations birds maintain year-round colouration. We observed year-round breeding colouration in 23 out of 34 sampling sites that had <b>moorhens</b> and were surveyed in August. Coloured <b>moorhens</b> were found during winter at sites with higher minimum winter temperatures, and more abundant free-floating and submerged leafy vegetation. In addition, higher proportions of <b>moorhens</b> were coloured at sites with higher mean minimum temperatures. The retention of year-round breeding colouration appears to be restricted to areas with warmer winter temperatures and more abundant food. The results suggest that areas not occupied by <b>moorhens</b> are of inadequate quality to support breeding populations. We suggest that ecological constraints on independent breeding in Dusky <b>Moorhens</b> may have favoured the evolution of their unusual cooperative breeding system, which involves frequent mate-sharing by both sexes.

5|$|The {{goldcrest}} is {{a host of}} {{the widespread}} <b>moorhen</b> flea, Dasypsyllus gallinulae, and of the louse Philopterus reguli. The amblycerous mite Ricinus frenatus has been found on the eastern goldcrest subspecies, R. r. japonensis in Japan, and {{at the other end}} of the range in birds of the nominate subspecies on the Faroes and in Spain. These lice move over the host's body, and have strong mouthparts that pierce the host's skin so that they can feed on blood, and sometimes feather material. A number of feather mites have been recorded in the genus Regulus; these mites live on fungi growing on the feathers. The fungi found on the plumage may feed on the keratin of the outer feathers or on feather oil.|$|E
5|$|In {{recognition}} {{of the fact that}} many people use the towpath to exercise their dogs, dog dips have been installed at Allbrook and Shawford. These provide easy access into the water for dogs, and owners are encouraged to only allow dogs to swim at these locations, to conserve the bank in other places. The water vole surveys have followed the best practice described in the Water Vole Conservation Handbook (2006), and have also recorded evidence of otter, brown rat and American mink populations. While carrying out the work, the surveyors have also counted sightings of kingfisher, heron, <b>moorhen</b> and coot. The bat survey recorded common pipistrelle, soprano pipistrelle, Daubenton's, noctule and serotine bats in 2011. Bat boxes have been erected near Allbrook, and there was some evidence that they were being used. The 2009 fisheries survey recorded large numbers of young Atlantic salmon in the lower river, but although fish weirs have been provided, wild parr were not recorded near Winchester. Above there, a large population of brown trout thrives. Eels were monitored {{for the first time in}} 2009, when their distribution was found to be variable.|$|E

40|$|Prey-predator {{communication}} of alertness {{has been reported}} for <b>Moorhens</b> (Gallinula chloropus) and other species of birds. Because ability to flee is probably related to body condition, healthy potential prey may behave more conspicuously to send predators an unambiguous message. <b>Moorhens</b> have a contrasting rump patch that is flashed by rapid tail-flicking. During two winter months, we observed sex-related differences {{in the rate of}} tail-flicking. Females tail-flicked at a faster rate than males, and more vigilant and more symmetrical males tail-flicked faster. The rate of tail-flicking was negatively correlated to the heterophil/lymphocyte ratio in both sexes and positively correlated to hematocrit and albumin/globulin ratio in females. These results suggest that male and female <b>Moorhens</b> in better physical condition tail-flick at a faster rate and support the pursuit deterrent hypothesis, with healthy individuals appearing to inform predators that they would be difficult to capture.
