5|$|Over the Stock Exchange floor, Pflueger {{mounted a}} ceiling {{composed}} of interconnected sheet metal strips above {{which he used}} indirect lighting to soften the edges and reduce shadows made by traders on the floor below. The result was so effective that Pflueger used it on a much larger scale above the audience seating at the Paramount Theatre in Oakland, where it extended from and formed a continuity with the incised art on the proscenium. In Oakland, Pflueger flanked the stage with structures {{that appeared to be}} pillars supporting the proscenium but were instead layered, curved sheets of thin metal behind which lighting instruments cast light indirectly to give the columns a suffused glow. In 1931, he used the same concept to frame the stage at the Bal Tabarin (now Bimbo's 365 Club), and to bring a changing palette of color to the ceiling above the dance floor. Pflueger filed for and, in 1934, received two architectural lighting design patents, one for his ceiling grid with indirect lighting and one for the thin <b>metal</b> <b>panels</b> hiding lighting instruments. He used the patented ceiling grid once more in the Patent Leather Bar, in 1939.|$|E

40|$|AbstractTo achieve {{national}} {{greenhouse gas}} {{reduction in the}} building sector, heating and cooling energy in buildings should be reduced. The government has strengthened regulations on insulation performance for building energy savings. However, the building envelope has various thermal bridges. In particular, a <b>metal</b> <b>panel</b> curtain wall comprises a number of thermal bridges at joints between the panels and the fixing units, thus degrading the overall thermal performance. To reduce building energy, {{it is necessary to}} reduce thermal bridges in building envelopes. This study aims to analyze the energy saving potential achieved by reducing thermal bridges. For this, the insulation performance and building energy needs of the existing and alternative <b>metal</b> <b>panel</b> curtain wall were evaluated. The alternative <b>metal</b> <b>panel</b> curtain wall that uses plastic molds at joints between panels and the thermally-broken brackets was suggested to reduce heat loss through thermal bridges. As results, the effective U-value of the alternative <b>metal</b> <b>panel</b> curtain wall was reduced by 72 % compared with the existing <b>metal</b> <b>panel</b> curtain wall. In addition, annual heating energy needs of the alternative <b>metal</b> <b>panel</b> curtain wall building was reduced by 26 %, and annual total energy needs was reduced by 6 % because annual cooling energy needs of it slightly increased compared with the existing <b>metal</b> <b>panel</b> curtain wall. In conclusion, the alternative <b>metal</b> <b>panel</b> curtain wall considerably influenced the savings in building energy needs by reducing thermal bridges...|$|R

25|$|System cassettes. This is a rigid {{rectangular}} ventilated wall system {{consisting of}} curved or flat <b>metal</b> <b>panels</b> mounted and secured to a supporting structure. All four borders are pre-folded at the factory. Folded edges {{on every side}} allow large sheet metal parts to lie even with the cladding surface. Fixing is usually by riveting, screwing, or by using angle brackets or bolt hooks to fix the cassettes directly to the substrate. System cassettes are pre-profiled to meet specific architectural requirements. Links to representative photographs of cassette cladding are available.|$|E
25|$|The new Nova Bus LFS {{articulated}} buses came factory-equipped with bike racks, {{as do the}} non-articulated LFS buses entering service in 2015. These racks were sealed in October 2014 by order of the Ministry of Labour, due to concerns about bikes on the racks obscuring the drivers' view. In May 2015, the slot closer to the bus was authorised for use. The other is sealed off with <b>metal</b> <b>panels,</b> and the retention hooks have been removed. Once the first slot is full, cyclists may bring their bikes inside the articulated bus during off-peak hours, at the driver's discretion.|$|E

25|$|Though {{faster and}} more {{advanced}} than the RAF's current front line biplane fighters, {{the design of the}} Hurricane's construction was already considered to be somewhat outdated when introduced to service and resembled those used on the earlier biplanes. Hawker had decided to employ its traditional construction techniques instead of radical measures such as the adoption of a stressed-skin metal exterior. The primary structure comprised a Warren truss box-girder that made use of high-tensile steel longerons and duralumin cross-bracing, which were mechanically fastened instead of welded. Over this, a secondary structure composed of wooden formers and stringers gave the fuselage a rounded external shape, which carried a doped linen covering. The majority of the external surfaces were linen, save for a section between the cockpit and the engine cowling that used lightweight <b>metal</b> <b>panels</b> instead.|$|E
25|$|The {{complete}} exterior {{glass facade}} system, all <b>metal</b> <b>panels</b> for the adjacent buildings and all accessory metal cladding was custom designed, detailed and supplied by Overgaard Ltd. Hong Kong to Architectural Wall Systems, the Des Moines, Iowa based glazing contractor who installed the building envelope. In total {{there are approximately}} 13,000 m² (139,932 square feet) of double insulated glass and 5,000 m² (53,820 square feet) painted aluminum curtain wall panels. In addition there are roughly 200 tons of system profiles and accessories. All of the 2,404 individual glass units on the main building were produced sequentially and completely assembled prior to shipping. The 5,000,000lbs of rebar used in construction was detailed, farbricated and supplied by The Carter-Waters Corporation of Kansas City.

25|$|Refurbishment {{projects}} {{were carried out}} on the remaining tower blocks and three-storey blocks of flats. The first of the refurbishments of the two tower blocks commenced in 2002 with Chivenor House. A subtle refurbishment was planned with the entire exterior being covered in an insulated render and painted a cream colour. The ground floor and basement were refurbished providing communal facilities for the local residents including a hairdressing salon, communal lounge, communal kitchen and television room. A concierge was located {{on the ground floor}} to ensure security of access and part of the basement was linked to the school. A crèche was also provided. The stairwells were reglazed with Reglit glazing and new windows were provided in powder-coated aluminium frames, which were of better quality than the previous window frames. The refurbishment was completed in 2006 at a cost of £3 million. The refurbishment of Topcliffe House commenced in November 2003 as the final refurbishment project by the HAT in the area. A design competition was held for a high-profile design for the building with BM3 Architecture, the architects of the Chivenor House refurbishment, winning the competition. Metal balconies and brightly coloured louvers were installed on the building to radically change the exterior. The crown of the building is surrounded by <b>metal</b> <b>panels</b> similar to those used on the balconies with the name 'Topcliffe' etched into it. These panels shield the antennas on the roof from view. The refurbishment was completed in May 2005 at a cost of £2.7 million.|$|E

40|$|The goal of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the vulnerability of roof tile systems and metal shutters to roof tile debris. Three phases addressed the performance of tile roof systems and metal shutters impacted by roof tile debris. The first phase experimentally evaluated the tile fragment size and quantity generated by a tile striking a tile roof system. The second phase experimentally quantified the puncture vulnerability of common <b>metal</b> <b>panel</b> shutter systems as a function of tile fragment impact speed. The third phase provided context for interpretation of the experimental results through the use of a tile trajectory model. The results provide supporting evidence that while <b>metal</b> <b>panel</b> window shutters provide significant protection against a prevalent form of windborne debris, these systems are vulnerable to tile fragment puncture in design level tropical cyclones. These findings correlate with field observations made after Hurricane Charley (2004) ...|$|R
