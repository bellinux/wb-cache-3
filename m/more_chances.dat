5|$|Four county matches {{remained}} {{before the}} Tests, giving the players <b>more</b> <b>chances</b> to press their claims for selection.

The tourists were eventually bowled out for 204. During his innings, Johnston swung lustily and hit three sixes. In reply, Lancashire reached 4/144 before Johnston took five {{of the last six}} wickets to help dismiss the home side for 182, securing a slender lead for the tourists.

5|$|With {{the match}} {{entering}} extra {{time and the}} golden goal rule applying, both sides had chances to score the decisive goal.

Overmars's effort was then blocked by a Galatasaray defender.|$|E

As a result, Galatasaray were awarded a corner. Erdem took it, but failed to trouble the defense, as the ball was easily cleared away. Arsenal responded via Bergkamp, who received the ball from Marc Overmars; Bergkamp attempted to outrun Galatasaray defenders Capone and Gheorghe Popescu and into their area, only to be unable to keep the ball in match play. Arsenal even fashioned <b>more</b> <b>chances,</b> as Overmars won a one-on-one encounter against Capone, trying to reach Bergkamp, but the ball was easily read by Popescu for a corner. The corner was came to nothing, as Patrick Vieira tried to hit the ball, before it landed for an opportunity for Henry, whose shot went over the goal post.

5|$|Before {{the start}} of the match, a minute's silence was held, in memory of Rafa Benítez's father Francesco who died of heart failure on the Wednesday before the final.

São Paulo lined up in a 3–5–2 formation, while Liverpool opted for a 4–4–1–1 formation. Liverpool had the first chance of the match inside the opening 79 seconds.

5|$|Martin Keown {{took care}} of the free-kick which Popescu unsuccessfully {{attempted}} to clear, only to give Overmars a shot on goal, a volley which went over. One minute later, Galatasaray's first opportunity came when Erdem received a straight ball from a Hagi taken free–kick, and took a shot on goal, which goalkeeper David Seaman managed to keep out with his left hand for a corner. The corner was taken, but no Galatasaray player was available to direct the ball towards the goal. Arsenal would create more opportunities into the match, when Sylvinho snatched the ball from Hagi and ran down to Galatasaray's left, before putting in a cross to the running Henry, who was halted by a clearance from Bülent Korkmaz. As Galatasaray grew more into the game minute, Erdem exchanged passes with Şükür, whose bicycle kick went completely off target. Arsenal began creating <b>more</b> <b>chances</b> – in the 35th minute, Overmars made a low powerful shot on goal, forcing Cláudio Taffarel to make a diving save. Overmars then made another run into the area but his attempt went across the goal. Galatasaray nearly took the lead with only two minutes of the first half remaining, when Şükür found Erdem, who beat the offside trap. However, his shot went just wide.|$|E
5|$|The {{first player}} born in Puerto Rico {{who played in}} MLB was Hiram Bithorn, who debuted as a pitcher with the Chicago Cubs on April 15, 1942. This was {{followed}} by the introduction of African American players in Major League Baseball, which allowed <b>more</b> <b>chances</b> to players born in the island. Subsequently, Afro-Puerto Rican players such as Orlando Cepeda and Victor Pellot Power began having solid performances in the league, and were selected to participate in the Major League Baseball All-Star Game. In , Roberto Clemente became the first player from Puerto Rico and first Latin American to be elected {{as a member of the}} National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum. Since then Puerto Rico has kept a stable amount of players in the league. During this timeframe, several players have been selected to participate in the All-Star Game or won awards for their performance, while others imposed records within the league. These include Javy López, who holds the record for most home runs hit by a catcher in a single season. Both Iván Rodríguez and Roberto Alomar hold the record for most Gold Glove Awards in their positions. Recipients of the Most Valuable Player Award include Orlando Cepeda, Juan González and Iván Rodríguez. Roberto Clemente and Mike Lowell also won the World Series MVP Award in their respective divisions. Carlos Delgado is the only Latin to hit 4 homers in a game.|$|E

25|$|When {{the sides}} {{met in the}} 2009–10 season, both clubs were {{suffering}} from a disastrous start to the season. Both games followed similar patterns, with Everton enjoying the greater possession and creating <b>more</b> <b>chances</b> in the games, but it was Liverpool who scored the goals in a 0–2 victory at Goodison Park and 1–0 at Anfield, the latter thanks to a goal from Dirk Kuyt.|$|E

25|$|After two {{losses in}} a week, {{including}} elimination from the League Cup, Southampton returned to St Mary's on 10 November to host Swansea City. In a game which featured the league debut of Luke Shaw, {{as well as}} the first league game of the season for Jack Cork, the Saints dominated possession and goal-scoring chances in the first half but failed to break the deadlock before the break. After half time Southampton continued to play well, with a penalty possibility for Adam Lallana turned down ten minutes after the break, before Morgan Schneiderlin headed in a cross from Rickie Lambert to score his second goal of the season and go 1–0 up against the Welsh side. Despite <b>more</b> <b>chances</b> for the home side, however, former Saints player Nathan Dyer scored to equalise for the visitors following a mistake by goalkeeper Paulo Gazzaniga.
