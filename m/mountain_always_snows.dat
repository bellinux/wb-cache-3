50|$|Pluto {{runs his}} own {{neighborhood}} in Disney's Toontown Online. It's called the Brrrgh and it's <b>always</b> <b>snowing</b> there except during Halloween. During April Toons Week, a weekly event {{that is very}} silly, Pluto switches playgrounds with Minnie (all other characters do this as well). Pluto actually talks in Minnie's Melodyland.|$|R
50|$|It is {{situated}} at 1440 m altitude, being the highest resort in Romania. It {{lies in a}} conifer forest. It is a popular winter destination and in summer it is sought for its peacefulness. There is <b>always</b> <b>snow</b> and skiing lessons for its fresh air and for the easily accessible trekking routes.|$|R
50|$|The Östersund Ski Stadium (Östersunds skidstadion) is a {{cross-country}} skiing, biathlon and ski orienteering facility in Östersund, Sweden. In October 2013 it was appointed national stadium for Swedish biathlon. Since 2007 the stadium has <b>always</b> <b>snow</b> starting on 1 November, using leftover snow gathered by Östersund Municipality over {{the spring and}} summertime season.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Some, naturally. You don't climb <b>mountains</b> <b>always</b> without accidents. There was one {{the first}} time anyone ever made the ascent of the Piz Margatsch. That was fifty years ago. My uncle was killed in it.' ...|$|R
2500|$|Oral {{subjects}} took a practical, not an abstract, {{approach to}} syllogisms. Luria asked them this question. In the far north, {{where there is}} snow, all bears are white. Novaya Zemlya is in the far north and there is <b>always</b> <b>snow</b> there. What colour are the bears? Typical response: [...] "I don't know. I've seen a black bear. I've never seen any others. … Every locality has its own animals." ...|$|R
5000|$|The Western Patagonia {{and more}} {{precisely}} Andean Patagonia, with beautiful landscapes who meet <b>mountains</b> <b>always</b> snowy, ice fields, glaciers, cold forests, large and deep lakes of glacial origin and very running rivers, winter sports centers and beautiful [...] "alpine" [...] aspect towns.|$|R
6000|$|The way {{the snow}} [...] "goes" [...] for that poor woman is most unfair. It <b>always</b> <b>snows</b> much heavier in the {{particular}} spot where she is sitting than it does {{anywhere else in the}} whole street. Why, we have sometimes seen a heroine sitting {{in the midst of a}} blinding snow-storm while the other side of the road was as dry as a bone. And it never seemed to occur to her to cross over.|$|R
5000|$|... "They are {{north from}} the Türks, 14,000 li from the Chinese capital. They follow grass and water, but mostly {{live in the}} mountains. Their {{standing}} army is 30,000 men. There is <b>always</b> <b>snow,</b> and foliage does not fall down. They plough fields with horses. All horses are skewbald colors, therefore the state is also given the same name. They live in the north near a sea. Though they have horses, they do not ride them, but use their milk for food. They are frequently at war with Kirgizes".|$|R
60|$|When the {{governor}} of the castle saw, by the arrangements which Hubbe made in obedience to this order, that this was the course that was to be pursued, he said he was not uneasy, for his magazines were full of provisions, and as to water, the rain which fell very copiously there among the <b>mountains</b> <b>always</b> afforded an abundant supply.|$|R

50|$|The city, {{located in}} west-central Bolivia 68 km {{southeast}} of Lake Titicaca, {{is set in}} a canyon created by the Choqueyapu River. It is located in a bowl-like depression surrounded by the high mountains of the Altiplano. Overlooking the city is the towering, triple-peaked Illimani. Its peaks are <b>always</b> <b>snow</b> covered and can be seen from many parts of the city. At an elevation of roughly 3650 m above sea level, La Paz is the highest capital city in the world. Due to its altitude, La Paz has an unusual subtropical highland climate, with rainy summers and dry winters.|$|R
5000|$|Now six institutes and one {{department}} compile 38 chairs. Students {{are trained}} for Bachelor, Specialist and master's degrees. Multi-disciplinary Osvita College trains junior specialists. Set into operation the Recreation Complex [...] "Petrivs'ka Sloboda" [...] (Mizhgir'ya region, Trans-Carpathians <b>Mountains)</b> <b>always</b> invites {{the students and}} faculty to rest. A modern student dining room was built and is functioning. The campus of the University [...] "Ukraine" [...] is becoming an adornment of {{the western part of}} Kyiv.|$|R
5000|$|The Turkish woman {{doctor says}} {{in the book of}} Aunt Dot, [...] "She is a woman of dreams. Mad dreams, dreams of crazy, {{impossible}} things. And they aren't all of conversion to the Church, oh no. Nor all of the liberation of women, oh no. Her eyes are on far <b>mountains,</b> <b>always</b> some far peak where she will go. She looks so firm and practical, that nice face, so fair and plump and shrewd, but look in her eyes, you will sometimes catch a strange gleam." ...|$|R
60|$|The peasants in Switzerland, {{when they}} meet strangers in {{ascending}} or descending the <b>mountains,</b> <b>always</b> accost them pleasantly and wish them good morning or good evening. In most other countries, strangers meeting {{each other on the}} road pass in silence. Perhaps it is the loneliness and solitude of the country and the sense of danger and awe that the stupendous mountains inspire that incline people to be more pleased {{when they meet}} each other in Switzerland, even if they are strangers, than in the more cheerful and smiling regions of France and England.|$|R
5000|$|As {{with his}} poetry, A Child's Christmas in Wales {{does not have}} a tight {{narrative}} structure, but uses descriptive passages designed to create an emotive sense of the nostalgia Thomas is intending to evoke. The story is told from the viewpoint of the author recounting a festive season as a young boy in a fictionalised autobiographical style. In the first passage, Thomas searches for a nostalgic Western belief in Christmas past with the line, [...] "It was <b>snowing.</b> It was <b>always</b> <b>snowing</b> at Christmas", furthering his idyllic memory of childhood past by describing the snow as being better and more exciting then, than the snow that he experiences as an adult. The prose is comedic, with exaggerated characters used either for comedic effect, or to show how childhood memories are enlarged through youthful interpretation.|$|R
2500|$|The stripe color varies {{due to the}} {{influence}} and interaction of other genes. Another genetic characteristic makes the stripes of the tiger very pale; white tigers of this type are called snow-white or [...] "pure white". White tigers, Siamese cats, and Himalayan rabbits have enzymes in their fur which react to temperature, causing them to grow darker in the cold. A white tiger named Mohini was whiter than her relatives in the Bristol Zoo, who showed more cream tones. This may have been because she spent less time outdoors in the winter. Kailash Sankhala observed that white tigers were always whiter in Rewa State, {{even when they were}} born in New Delhi and returned there. [...] "In spite of living in a dusty courtyard, they were <b>always</b> <b>snow</b> white." [...] A weakened immune system is directly linked to reduced pigmentation in white tigers.|$|R
500|$|In winter, North Carolina is {{somewhat}} {{protected by the}} Appalachian Mountains to the west. Cold fronts from Canada are typically reduced in intensity by the mountains. However, occasionally cold air can move from the north or northeast, east of the Appalachian Mountains, from Arctic high pressure systems that settle over the Northeastern or New England states. Other polar and Arctic outbreaks can cross the mountains and force temperatures to drop to about [...] in central North Carolina. Still, temperatures below zero degrees Fahrenheit are extremely rare outside of the mountains. The coldest ever recorded temperature in North Carolina was [...] on January 21, 1985, at Mount Mitchell. The winter temperatures on the coast are milder due to the warming influence of the Atlantic Ocean and the Gulf Stream. The average ocean temperature in Southport in January is still {{higher than the average}} ocean temperature in Maine during July. Snow is common in the mountains, although many ski resorts use snowmaking equipment to make sure there is <b>always</b> <b>snow</b> on their land. North Carolina's relative humidity is highest in the winter.|$|R
25|$|During the {{dry season}} the <b>mountain</b> almost <b>always</b> follows the same daily weather pattern. Large daily {{temperature}} fluctuations occur which led Hedberg to exclaim winter every night and summer every day. There is variation in minimum and maximum temperatures day to day, but the standard deviation of the mean hourly pattern is small.|$|R
60|$|And {{those who}} {{were waiting for the}} Rajah thought him a long time {{on the top of the}} mountain, and thought the great spirit must have much to say, or might perhaps want to keep him on the <b>mountain</b> <b>always,</b> or perhaps he had missed his way in coming down again. And they were debating whether they should go and search for him, when they saw him coming down with the two boys. And when he met them he looked very grave, but said nothing; and then all descended together, and the {{procession}} returned as it had come; and the Rajah went to his palace and the chiefs to their villages, and the people to their houses, to tell their wives and children all that had happened, and to wonder yet again what would come of it.|$|R
50|$|At {{the age of}} 65 he made a valiant {{effort with}} other clerics to climb Mount Etna in South Italy. Sadly they had to turn back {{as one of the}} party, Cardinal Francis Carberri had {{respiratory}} problems halfway up the <b>mountain.</b> Hinsley <b>always</b> said even on his deathbed that he regretted not climbing up Etna.|$|R
60|$|No, {{it was not}} a river--it was a mere burn; quite {{a little}} burn, but-- what then? Little men are always fussier and noisier than big men; little boys {{invariably}} howl more furiously than big boys. Nature is full of analogies; and little streams, especially <b>mountain</b> streams, <b>always</b> make more ado in finding their level than big rivers.|$|R
50|$|Maekawa's theorem is a theorem in the {{mathematics}} of paper folding named after Jun Maekawa. It relates to flat-foldable origami crease patterns and states that at every vertex, {{the numbers of}} valley and <b>mountain</b> folds <b>always</b> differ by two in either direction. The same result was also discovered by Jacques Justin and, even earlier, by S. Murata.|$|R
50|$|Hunger Mountain {{is named}} for a {{mountain}} in Middlesex, Vermont. According to legend, {{a group of men}} who went hunting on this <b>mountain</b> <b>always</b> returned home hungry, having caught only one quail between them. This mountain can be seen from many vantage points in Montpelier, where Hunger Mountain the magazine is located. The initial goals of the magazine were to call attention to established and emerging writers, while also highlighting local Vermont writers and artists. The journal was founded in 2002 by Caroline Mercurio and was made possible through a generous donation from a Vermont College of Fine Arts MFA in Writing alumnus. The premiere issue, released in the fall of 2002, included work by Wally Lamb, Maxine Kumin, and an interview with Grace Paley. Miciah Bay Gault took over as managing editor in 2009 and Samantha Kolber began her post as managing editor in July 2015.|$|R

5000|$|The <b>mountain</b> {{is almost}} <b>always</b> {{referred}} to as [...] "Mount Baldy" [...] by locals, {{to the point where}} many would not recognize the name [...] "Mount San Antonio".|$|R
5000|$|The {{island has}} an average {{temperature}} of [...] throughout the year, {{with an average}} minimum temperature of [...] and maximum of [...] Daily temperature changes seasonally are quite small in the lowlands and coastal areas. The temperature in the south is usually a few degrees higher than the north and temperatures in the central interior <b>mountains</b> are <b>always</b> cooler than those {{on the rest of}} the island.|$|R
50|$|In nature, water {{cascading}} down a <b>mountain</b> will <b>always</b> {{follow the}} path of least resistance - the easiest route. In thinking, too, our minds tend to take {{the path of}} least resistance - those avenues most familiar to us. So doing, it is difficult to arrive at ideas new to us or to our competitors. SIT encourages an approach to the counter-intuitive path - the path of most resistance.|$|R
50|$|Lone Cone is a {{mountain}} located 6 km north of Tofino and 7 km northwest of Mount Colnett {{on the western}} peninsula of Meares Island, British Columbia, Canada. The <b>mountain</b> has <b>always</b> been a noticeable landmark to all inhabitants with its looming presence on {{the north end of}} Meares Island. The early pioneers believed that if there were clouds blocking the summit then there would be approaching good weather.|$|R
50|$|POWs {{worked in}} the {{surrounding}} area and also were assigned to crop harvest crews in Clearmont, Wheatland, Basin, and Lovell. Others spent time as timber men in nearby Esterbrook and {{as far away as}} Ryan's Park in the Medicine Bow <b>Mountains.</b> Guards <b>always</b> accompanied the internees although security might become lax on the job site as escape attempts appeared to be less of a threat away from the camp.|$|R
5000|$|The {{coat of arms}} is {{an example}} of canting arms, since the name Grünenberg means Green <b>mountain,</b> it <b>always</b> {{included}} green <b>mountains.</b> Normally there were six rounded mountains arraigned in a triangle with one then two then three mountains. As a crest it often had feathers and sometimes a small hut appeared on the mountains. [...] The helmet cover is green on the outside and natural ermine on the interior.|$|R
50|$|Northern: Sierra de la Demanda, Sierra de Neila, Mesa de Cebollera and the Picos de Urbión in the northwest, the Sierra de Alcarama, Sierra de Peñalmonte, Sierra de Moncalvillo and the {{isolated}} Moncayo Massif in the north, <b>always</b> crested with <b>snow</b> in the winter, with its eastern prolongation the Sierra de Nava Alta.|$|R
60|$|The day's adventures {{had made}} our wanderers tired, so the Bumpy Man brought them some {{blankets}} {{in which they}} rolled themselves and then lay down before the fire, which their host kept alive with fuel all through the night. Trot wakened several times and found the <b>Mountain</b> Ear <b>always</b> alert and listening intently for the slightest sound. But the little girl could hear no sound at all except the snores of Cap'n Bill.|$|R
5000|$|On {{the summit}} of the Torhelm is a large summit cross made of wood that was erected in 1978. On a bronze plaque is the {{following}} inscription:"Schlag ein wenn eine Hand sich gibt, denn Vorsicht braucht es nicht. Der Mensch der seine Berge liebt ist immer grad und schlicht" [...] ("Take it when his hand is offered, for you need not be cautious. The man who loves his <b>mountains</b> is <b>always</b> straight and true.") ...|$|R
