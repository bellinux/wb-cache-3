Complementary strand nucleic acids detected in extracts of infected plants were heterogeneous in size, with four discrete bands containing molecules approximately 700, 1050, 1500, and 1800 nucleotides long. Enzymatic studies indicated that these viroid <b>minus</b> <b>strands</b> are composed exclusively of RNA and, as extracted, are present in complexes containing extensive double-stranded regions.

40|$|The {{rates of}} viral RNA and protein syntheses for {{wild-type}} RNA bacteriophages and their nonpolar, coat protein amber mutants were determined in amber suppressor (S 26 R 1 E, Su- 1 and H 12 R 8 a, Su- 3) and nonsuppressor (AB 259, S 26, and Q 13) strains of Escherichia coli {{in the presence}} of rifamycin. It was demonstrated that the rates of synthesis of phage-specific replicase and RNA <b>minus</b> <b>strands</b> drop off concurrently in both wild-type and coat protein mutant-infected Su− and Su+ cells after 10 and 15 min postinfection, respectively. The rate of synthesis of RNA plus strands started to decline 5 to 10 min later in both cases. Excessive synthesis of replicase in the coat protein mutant-infected cells was accompanied by a similar overproduction of RNA <b>minus</b> <b>strands,</b> but not of plus strands. Partial suppression of protein synthesis in wild-type phage-infected cells abolishing coat protein control over replicase accumulation led to prolongation of replicase synthesis. Such an effect was observed also in coat protein mutant-infected cells, indicating that the excess of replicase itself may be capable of suppression of replicase synthesis in the absence of coat protein. The prolongation of replicase synthesis was followed by the prolonged synthesis of RNA <b>minus</b> <b>strands</b> in both cases. Moreover, replicase and <b>minus</b> <b>strands</b> were formed in nearly equal amounts when protein synthesis was partially inhibited. Assuming functional instability of phage RNAs, the observed coupling of replicase and minus-strand RNA synthesis offers a possibility for control of viral RNA replication by means of control of replicase synthesis on the translational level. A hypothesis is put forward to explain the molecular mechanism of such coupling between the syntheses of replicase and RNA <b>minus</b> <b>strands...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{majority}} of porcine transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus plus-strand RNAs (genome and subgenomic mRNAs), {{at the time}} of peak RNA synthesis (5 h postinfection), were not found in membrane-protected complexes in lysates of cells prepared by Dounce homogenization but were found to be susceptible to micrococcal nuclease (85 %) or to sediment to a pellet in a cesium chloride gradient (61 %). They therefore are probably free molecules in solution or components of easily dissociable complexes. By contrast, the {{majority of}} minus-strand RNAs (genome length and subgenomic mRNA length) were found to be resistant to micrococcal nuclease (69 %) or to remain suspended in association with membrane-protected complexes following isopycnic sedimentation in a cesium chloride gradient (85 %). Furthermore, 35 % of the suspended <b>minus</b> <b>strands</b> were in a dense complex (1. 20 to 1. 24 g/ml) that contained an RNA plus-to-minus-strand molar ratio of approximately 8 : 1 and viral structural proteins S, M, and N, and 65 % were in a light complex (1. 15 to 1. 17 g/ml) that contained nearly equimolar amounts of plus- and minus-strand RNAs and only trace amounts of proteins M and N. In no instance during fractionation were genome-length <b>minus</b> <b>strands</b> found segregated from sub-genome-length <b>minus</b> <b>strands.</b> These results indicate that all minus-strand species are components of similarly structured membrane-associated replication complexes and support the concept that all are active in the synthesis of plus-strand RNAs...|$|R

40|$|SIN 2 V is an {{engineered}} mutant Sindbis virus (SIN) that {{is unable}} to process the P 23 cleavage site in polyproteins P 123 and P 1234 that are translated from the genome after its entry into cells. Unlike wild-type (wt) SIN, it caused <b>minus</b> <b>strands</b> to be made continuously and replication-transcription complex (RTC) activity to be unstable (R. Gorchakov, E. Frolova, S. Sawicki, S. Atasheva, D. Sawicki, and I. Frolov, J. Virol. 82 : 6218 - 6231, 2008). We examined further the effects of P 23 on SIN RNA replication and RTC activity. Continuous minus-strand synthesis by SIN 2 V produced 250 % of wt levels of <b>minus</b> <b>strands</b> but accumulated only 110 % of wt levels (0. 39 pg, or 2. 7 × 104 molecules of double-stranded RNA per cell). Because SIN 2 V-infected cells accumulated only 40 % of the <b>minus</b> <b>strands</b> that were made, cells must possess some process to limit RTC accumulation. The loss of activity by SIN 2 V RTC after translation was inhibited was stochastic and not due to their inherent instability, based on finding that activity was lost without the degradation of the minus-strand templates. In addition to their normal functions, P 23 RTCs exhibited the novel phenotype of being unable to switch from making less to making more genomes than subgenomic 26 S mRNA at late times during infections. Our results lend credence to the hypothesis that nsP 2 (and possibly nsP 3) possesses functions other than those needed solely for RTC activity and that it may also act with the host to regulate minus-strand synthesis and {{the stability of the}} RTC...|$|R

40|$|Alphavirus nsP 3 phosphoprotein is {{essential}} for virus replication and functions initially within polyprotein P 123 or P 23 components of the short-lived minus-strand replicase, and upon polyprotein cleavage, mature nsP 3 likely functions also in plus-strand synthesis. We report the identification of a second nsP 3 mutant from among the A complementation group of Sindbis virus (SIN) heat-resistant strain, ts RNA-negative mutants. The ts 138 mutant possessed a change of G 4303 to C, predicting an Ala 68 -to-Gly alteration that altered a conserved His-Ala-Val tripeptide in the ancient (pre-eukaryotic), “X” or histone 2 A phosphoesterase-like macrodomain that in SIN encompasses nsP 3 residues 1 to 161 and whose role is unknown. We undertook comparative analysis of three nsP 3 N-terminal region mutants and observed (i) that nsP 3 and nsP 2 functioned initially as a single unit as deduced from complementation analysis and in agreement with our previous studies, (ii) {{that the degree of}} phosphorylation varied among the nsP 3 mutants, and (iii) that reduced phosphorylation of nsP 3 correlated with reduced minus-strand synthesis. The most striking phenotype was exhibited by ts 4 (Ala 268 to Val), which after shift to 40 °C made significantly underphosphorylated P 23 /nsP 3 and lost selectively the ability to make <b>minus</b> <b>strands.</b> After shift to 40 °C, mutant ts 7 (Phe 312 to Ser) made phosphorylated P 23 /nsP 3 and <b>minus</b> <b>strands</b> but failed to increase plus-strand synthesis.

40|$|A {{recombinant}} plasmid carrying an infectious adeno-associated viral genome was constructed that differs in several key respects from previously described recombinants. First, the vector is pEMBL 8 (+), which allows isolation of viral plus and <b>minus</b> <b>strands.</b> Second, the inserted viral sequences contain two XbaI cleavage sites that flank the viral coding domain. These inserts do not affect replication of the virus, and they allow nonviral sequences {{to be easily}} inserted between the cis-acting terminal repeats of adeno-associated virus. Third, the viral genome is flanked by PvuII cleavage sites that allow the entire, infectious viral chromosome to be excised from plasmid sequences in vitro. Viral DNA was replicated more efficiently within adenovirus-infected 293 cells if it was excised from the vector with PvuII before transfection. Presumably, the increased efficiency reflects bypass of the excision step which must normally precede replication when a {{recombinant plasmid}} enters the nucleus.

The TYMV RdRp activity was template specific in that poly(A) RNA was not copied, and alfalfa mosaic virus (AlMV) RNA, which does not contain a 3 ′-TLS, was a very poor template. However, other viral RNAs with a 3 ′-TLS andin vitrotranscripts of tRNAs were copied to varying degrees. Fully modified tRNAs were either inactive or poorly active templates, and AlMV 3 ′-RNA, even when provided with a 3 ′-terminal -ACCA, was not copied detectably. A potential role of the acceptor stem pseudoknot as a promoter element was assessed with mutations that drastically altered the structure and sequence of the pseudoknot, revealing only a twofold effect in decreasing template activity. The data show that RNAs with both a tRNA-like conformation and a -CCA 3 ′-terminus are potential templates for TYMV RdRp and suggest that promoter elements {{are not limited to}} the acceptor stem pseudoknot...|$|R

40|$|The time {{course of}} {{accumulation}} of viral plus-strand RNAs (genomic RNA and subgenomic mRNA for the coat protein) and minus-strand RNA in tobacco protoplasts synchronously infected with tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) RNA was examined. In protoplasts {{infected with the}} wild-type TMV L RNA, the plus and <b>minus</b> <b>strands</b> accumulated differently not only in quantity {{but also in the}} outline of kinetics. The time courses of accumulation of the genomic RNA and coat protein mRNA were similar: they became detectable at 2 or 4 h postinoculation (p. i.), and their accumulation increased until 14 to 18 h p. i. The accumulation rate reached the maximum at about 4 h p. i. and then gradually decreased. In contrast, accumulation of the minus-strand RNA ceased at 6 to 8 h p. i., at which time the plus-strand accumulation was already about 100 times greater and still continued vigorously. This specific halt of minus-strand accumulation was not caused exclusively by encapsidation of the genomic RNA, because a similar halt was observed upon infection with a deletion mutant that lacks the 30 K and coat protein genes. Upon infection with a mutant that could not produce the 130 K protein (one of the two proteins that are thought to be involved in viral RNA replication), the accumulation levels of both plus and <b>minus</b> <b>strands</b> were lower than that of the parental wild-type virus.
