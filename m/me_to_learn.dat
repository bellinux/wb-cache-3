500|$|For obZen, Haake {{returned}} to the drum kit most notably with his performance on the song [...] "Bleed". In an interview for Gravemusic.com, Haake stated, [...] " [...] was a big effort for <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn,</b> I {{had to find a}} totally new approach to playing the double bass drums {{to be able to do}} that stuff. I had never really done anything like that before like the fast bursts that go all the way through the song basically. So I actually spent as much time practicing that track alone as I did with all of the other tracks combined. It's kind of a big feat to change your approach like that and I'm glad we were able to nail it for the album. For a while though we didn't even know if it was going to make it to the album." [...] Hagström also stated, [...] "obZen is one of the most highly technical offerings the band has ever put to tape". Revolver magazine confirms this statement: [...] "At first listen, obZen seems less challenging to the listener than some of the band's other records, and most of the songs flow smoothly from one syncopated passage to the next. However, careful examination reveals that the material is some of the group's most complicated".|$|E

But, {{my father told}} <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> to fight corruption, make your way." [...] Trivedi shot into prominence when he asked the Supreme Court to make the Vohra report on the criminalization of politics in India public. This petition gave a push to the Right to Information movement.|$|E

It was very interesting to be in that environment; it was such a complete departure from our lives in Uruguay. Essentially, we were in a place where people didn't want you, and didn't understand what you were about", he said.

2500|$|Wade {{was born}} in 1930 in Southend-on-Sea, Essex – his father Leslie was a cellist, and his mother Jessica a harpist. He was an only child. His mother's family was from Cloughjordan, County Tipperary; her uncle was the Irish revolutionary leader Thomas MacDonagh, and her brother the oboist Terence MacDonagh.

After graduating, Wade spent a year at King's College London teaching German.|$|E

2500|$|Meena Kumari {{agreed to}} all terms, but with passing time she kept {{breaking}} them. It is said Kumari felt oppressed by the feudal attitude and high-handed behavior that Kamal Amrohi brought to their relationship. Kamal Amrohi's lavish productions Daera and Pakeezah, and his Kamalistan studios (1958) were mostly financed by Kumari's earnings. Meena Kumari was watched over. Kamal Amrohi had issued strict instructions and had deployed assistant Baqar Ali {{to prevent any}} other man from meeting Meena Kumari on the sets. In 1972 Kamal Amrohi told Vinod Mehta (writer of Meena Kumari - The Classic Biography) [...] "I didn't mean it like that. These were just ground rules. I mean, if she returned home at 7 instead of 6:30 it was acceptable for me. I just wanted her to appreciate that besides having responsibilities to her career, she had responsibilities to her home and husband". Amrohi further {{said that he was}} prepared to overlook Meena bending his conditions, but he would have loved it if she herself confessed when such bendings took place. [...] "It really pained <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> of these incidents from outside sources".|$|E
2500|$|Pisemsky {{spent the}} first ten {{years of his life}} in the small {{regional}} town of Vetluga where his father served as Mayor. Later he moved with his parents to the countryside. Pisemsky described the years he spent there in Chapter 2 of People of the Forties, an autobiographical novel in which he figured under the name of Pasha. Fond of hunting and horseback riding, the boy received scant education: his tutors were a local deacon, a defrocked drunkard, and a strange old man who was known to have toured the area for decades, giving lessons. Aleksey learned reading, writing, arithmetics, Russian and Latin from them. In his autobiography Pisemsky wrote: [...] "Nobody had ever forced <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn,</b> and I wasn't an avid learner, but I read a lot and that was my passion: by 14 I consumed, in translation, of course, most of Walter Scott's novels, Don Quixote, Gil Blas, Faublas, Le Diable boiteux, The Serapion Brethren, a Persian novel called Haggi Baba... As for children's books, I couldn't stand them and, as far as I remember now, considering them very silly." [...] Pisemsky wrote scornfully of his primary education and regretted failing to learn any languages besides Latin. He found in himself, however, a natural predisposition to mathematics, logic and aesthetics.|$|E
