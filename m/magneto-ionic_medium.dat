40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the magnetic field}} power spectrum in the cool core galaxy cluster A 2199 by analyzing the polarized emission of the central radio source 3 C 338. The polarized radiation from the radio emitting plasma is modified by the Faraday rotation as it passes through the <b>magneto-ionic</b> intracluster <b>medium.</b> We use Very Large Array observations between 1665 and 8415 MHz to produce detailed Faraday rotation measure and fractional polarization images of the radio galaxy. We simulate Gaussian random three-dimensional magnetic field models with different power-law power spectra and {{we assume that the}} field strength decreases radially with the thermal gas density as n_e^η. By comparing the synthetic and the observed images with a Bayesian approach, we constrain the strength and structure of the magnetic field associated with the intracluster medium. We find that the Faraday rotation toward 3 C 338 in A 2199 is consistent with a magnetic field power law power spectrum characterized by an index n=(2. 8 ± 1. 3) between a maximum and a minimum scale of fluctuation of Λ_max=(35 ± 28) kpc and Λ_min=(0. 7 ± 0. 1) kpc, respectively.

HI column densities integrated to the Galactic edge are measured immediately surrounding each of nearly 2000 sources in 1 -arcminute 21 cm line data, and are compared to RMs observed from polarized emission of each source. RM data are binned in column-density bins 4 x 10 ^ 20 cm^- 2 wide, and one observes a strong relationship {{between the number of}} hydrogen atoms in a 1 cm^ 2 column through the plane and the mean RM along the same line-of-sight and path length. The relationship is linear over one order of magnitude (from 0. 8 - 14 x 10 ^ 21 atoms cm^- 2) of column densities, with a constant RM/N_HI - 23. 2 +/- 2. 3 rad m^- 2 / 10 ^ 21 atoms cm^- 2, and a positive RM of 45. 0 +/- 13. 8 rad m^- 2 in the presence of no atomic hydrogen.

40|$|We {{present an}} {{analysis}} of the rotation measures (RMs) of polarized extragalactic point sources in the Southern Galactic Plane Survey. This work demonstrates that the statistics of fluctuations in RM differ for the spiral arms and the interarm regions. Structure functions of RM are flat in the spiral arms, while they increase in the interarms. This indicates that there are no correlated RM fluctuations in the magneto-ionized interstellar medium in the spiral arms on scales larger than ~ 0. 5 deg, corresponding to ~ 17 pc in the nearest spiral arm probed. The non-zero slopes in interarm regions imply a much larger scale of RM fluctuations.

40|$|Abstract. A new {{scenario}} is explored {{to understand the}} striking depolarization asymmtery observed between the two lobes of powerful radio sources exhibiting one-sided jets.

40|$|Following the {{detection}} of polarized diffuse Galactic emission in 1962 a number of surveys were undertaken at low frequencies in the following years resulting in important insights on the local magnetic field, polarization of the giant radio loops and other Galactic structures, {{as well as on}} the properties of the diffuse magnetized interstellar medium. This field of research experienced a revival in the eighties and nineties by a number of high resolution observations at low and high frequencies, which showed a large variety of polarization structures having no corresponding signature in the total intensity images. ’Canals ’ and ’Faraday screens ’ were reported, which clearly indicate that Faraday rotation in the <b>magneto-ionic</b> <b>medium</b> may largely vary on small scales. These findings called for a systematic approach and a number of new unbiased polarization surveys were started.

40|$|Wide-band radio {{polarization}} observations {{offer the}} possibility to recover information about the magnetic fields in synchrotron sources, such as details of their three-dimensional configuration, that has previously been inaccessible. The key physical process involved is the Faraday rotation of the polarized emission in the source (and elsewhere along the wave's propagation path to the observer). In order to proceed, reliable methods are required for inverting the signals observed in wavelength space into useful data in Faraday space, with robust estimates of their uncertainty. In this paper, we examine how variations of the intrinsic angle of polarized emission psi(0) with the Faraday depth phi within a source affect the observable quantities. Using simple models for the Faraday dispersion F(phi) and psi(0) (phi), along with the current and planned properties of the main radio interferometers, we demonstrate how degeneracies among the parameters describing the <b>magneto-ionic</b> <b>medium</b> can be minimized by combining observations in different wavebands. We also discuss how depolarization by Faraday dispersion due to a random component of the magnetic field attenuates the variations in the spectral energy distribution of the polarization and shifts its peak towards shorter wavelengths.

40|$|Rotation {{measures}} of pulsars and extragalactic point sources {{have been known}} to reveal large-scale antisymmetries in the Faraday rotation sky with respect to the Galactic plane and halo that have been interpreted as signatures of the mean magnetic field in the Galactic halo. We describe Faraday rotation measurements of the diffuse Galactic polarized radio emission over a large region in the northern Galactic hemisphere. Through application of Rotation Measure Synthesis we achieve sensitive Faraday rotation maps with high angular resolution, capable of revealing fine-scale structures of about 1 deg in the Faraday rotation sky. Our analysis suggests that the observed antisymmetry in the Faraday rotation sky at b > 0 deg is dominated by the magnetic field around a local HI bubble at a distance of approx. 100 pc, and not by the magnetic field of the Galactic halo. We derive physical properties of the magnetic field of this shell, which we find to be 20 - 34 uG strong.

Jansky Very Large Array. By fitting the observed diffuse complex polarization Q+iU as a function of wavelength directly to various depolarization models, we find that polarized emission from M 51 at 1 - 2 GHz originates {{from the top of the}} synchrotron disk and then experiences Faraday rotation in the near-side thermal halo of the galaxy. Thus, the scale height of the thermal gas must exceed that of the synchrotron emitting gas at L band. The observed Faraday depth distribution at L band is consistent with a halo field that comprises of a plane-parallel bisymmetric component and a vertical component which produces a Faraday rotation of ∼ - 9 rad m^- 2. The derived rotation measure structure functions indicate a characteristic scale of rotation measure fluctuations of less than 560 pc in the disk and approximately 1 kpc in the halo.

40|$|We present radio {{continuum}} and polarization {{images of}} the North Polar Spur (NPS) from the Global <b>Magneto-Ionic</b> <b>Medium</b> Survey (GMIMS) conducted with the Dominion Radio Astrophysical Observatory 26 -m Telescope. We fit polarization angle versus wavelength squared over 2048 frequency channels from 1280 to 1750 MHz to obtain a Faraday Rotation Measure (RM) map of the NPS. Combining this RM map with a published Faraday depth map of the entire Galaxy in this direction, we derive the Faraday depth introduced by the NPS and the Galactic interstellar medium (ISM) in front of and behind the NPS. The Faraday depth contributed by the NPS is close to zero, indicating that the NPS is an emitting only feature. The Faraday depth caused by the ISM {{in front of the}} NPS is consistent with zero at b> 50 degree, implying that this part of the NPS is local at a distance of approximately several hundred parsecs. The Faraday depth contributed by the ISM behind the NPS gradually increases with Galactic latitude up to b= 44 degree, and decreases at higher Galactic latitudes. This implies that either the part of the NPS at b 50 degree can be explained by including a coherent vertical magnetic field. Comment: 9 pages, 8 figures, accepted for publication in ApJ.

Our {{analysis}} of a VLBA 12 -hour synthesis observations of the OH masers in W 49 N has provided detailed high angular-resolution images of the maser sources, at 1612, 1665 and 1667 MHz. The images, of several dozens of spots, reveal anisotropic scatter broadening; with typical sizes of a few tens of milli-arc-seconds and axial ratios between 1. 5 to 3. The image position angles oriented perpendicular to the galactic plane are interpreted in terms of elongation of electron-density irregularities parallel to the galactic plane, due to a similarly aligned local magnetic field.

40|$|Narrow de{{polarized}} canals {{are common}} in maps of the polarized synchrotron emission of the Milky Way. Two physical effects that can produce these canals have been identified: the presence of Faraday rotation measure () gradients in a foreground screen and the cumulative cancellation of polarization known as differential Faraday rotation. We show that the behaviour of the Stokes parameters Q and U {{in the vicinity of}} a canal can be used to identify its origin. In the case of canals produced by a Faraday screen we demonstrate that, if the polarization angle changes by 90 across the canal, as is observed in all fields to-date, the gradients in must be discontinuous. Shocks are an obvious source of such discontinuities and we derive a relation of the expected mean separation of canals to the abundance and Mach number of supernova driven shocks, and compare this with recent observations by Haverkorn 03. We also predict the existence of less common canals with polarization angle changes other than 90. Differential Faraday rotation can produce canals in a uniform <b>magneto-ionic</b> <b>medium,</b> but as the emitting layer becomes less uniform the canals will disappear. We show that for moderate differences in emissivity in a two-layer medium, of up to 1 / 2, and for Faraday depth fluctuations of standard deviation ≲ 1 rad, canals produced by differential rotation will still be visible.

First results from a new database of 37543 rotation measures that covers over 80 % of the sky show the potential of an all-sky polarization survey with SKA path finders and the SKA.

This B-field structure can be detected in images of the Faraday rotation measure (RM) —a measure of the change in polarisation angle of an electromagnetic wave as it passes through a <b>magneto-ionic</b> <b>medium.</b> The Faraday rotation measure is directly proportional to the line-of-sight magnetic field; therefore a monotonic gradient in the RM transverse to the jet indicates similar behaviour of the line-of-sight B-field component. This type of analysis has mostly been done on parsec scales using VLBI observations at centimetre wavelengths, while relatively few studies have probed decaparsec to kiloparsec scales. The detection of RM gradients with significances of 3 σ or more on such large scales can demonstrate the presence of a toroidal field component, which may be associated with a helical field that has persisted to these distances from the centre of the AGN. We present the results of new Faraday rotation analyses for 2 AGN on kiloparsec scales based on multiwavelength VLA observations, with robust transverse RM gradients detected in both.

The structure, at l = 91. ◦ 8, b = − 2. ◦ 5, has an extent of ∼ 2 ◦, within which polarization angle varies smoothly over a range of ∼ 100 ◦. Polarized intensity also varies smoothly, showing a central peak within an outer shell. This region is {{in sharp contrast to}} its surroundings, where low-level chaotic polarization structure occurs on arcminute scales. The Faraday-rotation structure has no counterpart in radio total intensity, and is unrelated to known objects along the line of sight, which include a Lynds Bright Nebula, LBN 416, and the star cluster M 39 (NGC 7092). It is interpreted as a smooth enhancement of electron density. The absence of a counterpart, either in optical emission or in total intensity, establishes a lower limit to its distance. An upper limit is determined by the strong beam depolarization in this direction.

The {{aim is to}} constrain both the regular and turbulent magnetic field strengths in the disk and halo, modeled as a two- or three-layer <b>magneto-ionic</b> <b>medium,</b> via differential Faraday rotation and internal Faraday dispersion, along with wavelength-independent depolarization arising from turbulent magnetic fields. A reduced chi-squared analysis {{is used for the}} statistical comparison of predicted to observed polarization maps to determine the best-fit magnetic field configuration at each of four radial rings spanning 2. 4 - 7. 2 kpc in 1. 2 kpc increments. We find that a two-layer modeling approach provides a better fit to the observations than a three-layer model, where the near and far sides of the halo are taken to be identical, although the resulting best-fit magnetic field strengths are comparable. This implies that all of the signal from the far halo is depolarized at these wavelengths. We find a total magnetic field in the disk of approximately 18 μG and a total magnetic field strength in the halo of ∼ 4 - 6 μG. Both turbulent and regular magnetic field strengths in the disk exceed those in the halo by a factor of a few. About half of the turbulent magnetic field in the disk is anisotropic, but in the halo all turbulence is only isotropic.

40|$|Abridged) We use new multi-wavelength radio observations, {{made with}} the VLA and Effelsberg telescopes, to study the {{magnetic}} field of the nearby galaxy M 51 on scales from 200 to several. Interferometric and single dish data are combined to obtain new maps at 36 in total and polarized emission, and earlier 20 data are re-reduced. We compare the spatial distribution of the radio emission with observations of the neutral gas, derive radio spectral index and Faraday depolarization maps, and model the large-scale variation in Faraday rotation in order to deduce {{the structure of the}} regular magnetic field. We find that the 20 emission from the disc is severely depolarized and that a dominating fraction of the observed polarized emission at 6 must be due to anisotropic small-scale magnetic fields. Taking this into account, we derive two components for the regular magnetic field in this galaxy: the disc is dominated by a combination of azimuthal modes, m= 0 + 2, but in the halo only an m= 1 mode is required to fit the observations. We disuss how the observed arm-interarm contrast in radio intensities can be reconciled with evidence for strong gas compression in the spiral shocks. The average arm [...] interam contrast, representative of the radii r> 2 where the spiral arms are broader, is not compatible with straightforward compression: lower arm [...] interarm contrasts than expected may be due to resolution effects and decompression of the magnetic field as it leaves the arms. We suggest a simple method to estimate the turbulent scale in the <b>magneto-ionic</b> <b>medium</b> from the dependence of the standard deviation of the observed Faraday rotation measure on resolution. We thus obtain an estimate of 50 for the size of the turbulent eddies. Comment: 21 pages, 18 figures (some at lower resolution than submitted version), accepted for publication in MNRA...|$|E
40|$|We {{have used}} polarimetric imaging {{to study the}} <b>magneto-ionic</b> <b>medium</b> of the Galaxy, obtaining 1420 MHz images with an angular {{resolution}} of 1 ' over more than 40 square-degrees of sky around the W 3 /W 4 /W 5 /HB 3 HII region/SNR complex in the Perseus Arm. Features detected in polarization angle are imposed on the linearly polarized Galactic synchrotron background emission by Faraday rotation arising in foreground ionized gas having an emission measure as low as 1 cm^{- 6 } pc. Several new remarkable phenomena have been identified, including: mottled polarization arising from random fluctuations in a magneto-ionic screen that we identify with a medium in the Perseus Arm, probably {{in the vicinity of}} the HII regions themselves; depolarization arising from very high rotation measures (several times 10 ^ 3 rad m^{- 2 }) and rotation measure gradients due to the dense, turbulent environs of the HII regions; highly ordered features spanning up to several degrees; and an extended influence of the HII regions beyond the boundaries defined by earlier observations. In particular, the effects of an extended, low-density ionized halo around the HII region W 4 are evident, probably an example of the extended HII envelopes postulated as the origin of weak recombination-line emission detected from the Galactic ridge. Our polarization observations can be understood if the uniform magnetic field component in this envelope scales with the square-root of electron density and is 20 microG at the edge of the depolarized region around W 4, although this is probably an over-estimate since the random field component will have a significant effect.

40|$|Radio {{polarimetry}} at decimetre wavelengths is {{the principal}} source {{of information on the}} Galactic magnetic field. The diffuse polarized emission is strongly influenced by Faraday rotation in the <b>magneto-ionic</b> <b>medium</b> and rotation measure is the prime quantity of interest, implying that all Stokes parameters must be measured over wide frequency bands with many frequency channels. The DRAO 26 -m Telescope has been equipped with a wideband feed, a polarization transducer to deliver both hands of circular polarization, and a receiver, all operating from 1277 to 1762 MHz. Half-power beamwidth is between 40 and 30 arcminutes. A digital FPGA spectrometer, based on commercially available components, produces all Stokes parameters in 2048 frequency channels over a 485 -MHz bandwidth. Signals are digitized to 8 bits and a Fast Fourier Transform is applied to each data stream. Stokes parameters are then generated in each frequency channel. This instrument is in use at DRAO for a Northern sky polarization survey. Observations consist of scans up and down the Meridian at a drive rate of 0. 9 degree per minute to give complete coverage of the sky between declinations - 30 degree and 90 degree. This paper presents a complete description of the receiver and data acquisition system. Only {{a small fraction of the}} frequency band of operation is allocated for radio astronomy, and about 20 percent of the data are lost to interference. The first 8 percent of data from the survey are used for a proof-of-concept study, which has led to the first application of Rotation Measure Synthesis to the diffuse Galactic emission obtained with a single-antenna telescope. We find rotation measure values for the diffuse emission as high as approximately 100 rad per square metre, much higher than recorded in earlier work.

40|$|Context: Observations of {{polarized}} emission are {{a significant}} source of information on the magnetic field that pervades the Interstellar Medium of the Galaxy. Despite the acknowledged importance of the magnetic field in interstellar processes, our knowledge of field configurations on all scales is seriously limited. Aims: This paper describes an extensive survey of polarized Galactic emission at 1. 4 GHz that provides data with arcminute resolution and complete coverage of all structures from the broadest angular scales to the resolution limit, giving information on the <b>magneto-ionic</b> <b>medium</b> over a wide range of interstellar environments. Methods: Data from the DRAO Synthesis Telescope, the Effelsberg 100 -m Telescope, and the DRAO 26 -m Telescope have been combined. Angular resolution is ~ 1 ' and the survey extends from l = 66 deg to l = 175 deg over a range - 3 deg < b < 5 deg along the northern Galactic plane, with a high-latitude extension from l = 101 deg to l = 116 deg up to b = 17. 5 deg. This is the first extensive polarization survey to present aperture-synthesis data combined with data from single antennas, and the techniques developed to achieve this combination are described. Results: The appearance of the extended polarized emission at 1. 4 GHz is dominated by Faraday rotation along the propagation path, and the diffuse polarized sky bears little resemblance to the total-intensity sky. There is extensive depolarization, arising from vector averaging on long lines of sight, from HII regions, and from diffuse ionized gas seen in H-alpha images. Preliminary interpretation is presented of selected polarization features on scales from parsecs (the planetary nebula Sh 2 - 216) to hundreds of parsecs (a supperbubble GSH 166 - 01 - 17) to kiloparsecs (polarized emission in the direction of Cygnus X).

40|$|We {{present the}} {{discovery}} and detailed {{observations of the}} radio galaxy 1243 + 036 (= 4 C 03. 24) at a redshift of z= 3. 57. The radio source was {{selected on the basis}} of its extremely steep radio spectrum, suggesting that it might be very distant. The radio source was identified with a galaxy of R magnitude 22. 5. Subsequent spectroscopy showed strong Lyman α and [O III] emission, indicating that the object is a radio galaxy at z= 3. 57. High resolution (0. 2 ") radio maps show an FRII type radio source with a sharply bent radio structure. Strong depolarization of the radio emission indicates that the source is embedded in a <b>magneto-ionic</b> <b>medium.</b> The most spectacular feature of 1243 + 036 is the presence of a Lyα halo of luminosity ∼ 10 ^ 44. 5 ergs s^- 1 which extends over∼ 20 " (135 kpc). A 0. 6 " resolution Lyα image shows that the emission line gas is aligned with main axis of the radio source and has structure down to the scale of the resolution. High resolution spectra show that the Lyα emitting gas has complex kinematic structure. The gas contained within the radio structure has a relatively high velocity width (∼ 1500 km s^- 1 FWHM). The component of the Lyα emission that coincides with the bend in the radio structure is blueshifted with respect to the peak of the emission by 1100 km s^- 1. There is low surface brightness Lyα emission aligned with, but extending 40 kpc beyond both sides of the radio source. This halo has a narrow velocity width (∼ 250 km s^- 1 FWHM) and a velocity gradient of 450 km s^- 1 over the extent of the emission. The presence of the quiescent Lyα component aligned with the AGN axis, but outside the radio source, is strong evidence that photoionization b...|$|E
40|$|We report VLBA polarimetric {{observations}} of the CSS sources 3 C 119, 3 C 318, and 3 C 343 at 5 and 8. 4 GHz. The CSS source 3 C 119 has source rest-frame RM values up to ~ 10200 rad/m** 2 in a region which coincides with {{a change in the}} direction of the inner jet. This component is located ~ 325 pc from the core, which is variable and has a peaked radio spectrum. In the case of 3 C 318, a rest-frame RM of ~ 3030 rad/m** 2 has been estimated for the brightest component which contributes almost all of the polarised emission. Further, two more extended components have been detected, clearly showing "wiggles" in the jet towards the southern side of the source. The CSS source 3 C 343 contains two peaks of emission and a curved jet embedded in more diffuse emission. It exhibits complex field directions near the emission peaks, which indicate rest-frame RM values in excess of ~ 6000 rad/m** 2. The locations of the cores in 3 C 318 and 3 C 343 are not clear. The available data on mas-scale rest-frame RM estimates for CSS sources show that these have a wide range of values extending up to ~ 40000 rad/m** 2 in the central region of OQ 172, and could be located at projected distances from the core of up to ~ 1600 pc, as in 3 C 43 where this feature has a rest-frame RM of ~ 14000 rad/m** 2. RM estimates for cores in core-dominated radio sources indicate that in addition to responding to an overall density gradient of the <b>magneto-ionic</b> <b>medium,</b> geometry, orientation and modes of fuelling may also play a significant role. In addition to these effects, the high values of RM in CSS sources are possibly due to dense clouds of gas interacting with the radio jets. The observed distortions in the radio structures of many CSS sources are consistent with this interpretation. Comment: 15 pages, 190 figures. Accepted for publication in A&...|$|E
40|$|Our {{analysis}} of a VLBA 12 -hour synthesis observation of the OH masers in a well-known star-forming region W 49 N has yielded valuable data that enables us to probe distributions of magnetic fields in both the maser columns and the intervening interstellar medium (ISM). The data consisting of detailed high angular-resolution images (with beam-width ~ 20 milli-arc-seconds) of several dozen OH maser sources or "spots", at 1612, 1665 and 1667 MHz, reveal anisotropic scatter broadening, with typical sizes of a few tens of milli-arc-seconds and axial ratios between 1. 5 to 3. Such anisotropies have been reported earlier by Desai, Gwinn & Diamond (1994) and interpreted as induced by the local magnetic field parallel to the Galactic plane. However, we find a) the apparent angular sizes on the average a factor of ~ 2. 5 less than those reported by Desai et al. (1994), indicating significantly less scattering than inferred earlier, and b) a significant deviation in the average orientation of the scatter-broadened images (by ~ 10 degrees) from that implied by the magnetic field in the Galactic plane. More intriguingly, for a few Zeeman pairs in our set, significant differences (up to 6 sigma) are apparent in the scatter broadened images for the two hands of circular polarization, even when apparent velocity separation is less than 0. 1 km/s. This may possibly be the first example of a Faraday rotation contribution to the diffractive effects in the ISM. Using the Zeeman pairs, we also study the distribution of magnetic field in the W 49 N complex, finding no significant trend in the spatial structure function. In this paper, we present the details of our observations and analysis leading to these findings, discuss implications of our results for the intervening anisotropic <b>magneto-ionic</b> <b>medium,</b> and suggest the possible implications for the structure of magnetic fields within this star-forming region.
