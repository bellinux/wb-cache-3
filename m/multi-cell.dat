5|$|There {{are four}} types of {{thunderstorms}}: single-cell, <b>multi-cell</b> cluster, <b>multi-cell</b> lines, and supercells. Supercell thunderstorms are the strongest and most severe. Mesoscale convective systems formed by favorable vertical wind shear within the tropics and subtropics can {{be responsible for the}} development of hurricanes. Dry thunderstorms, with no precipitation, can cause the outbreak of wildfires from the heat generated from the cloud-to-ground lightning that accompanies them. Several means are used to study thunderstorms: weather radar, weather stations, and video photography. Past civilizations held various myths concerning thunderstorms and their development as late as the 18th century. Beyond the Earth's atmosphere, thunderstorms have also been observed on the planets of Jupiter, Saturn, Neptune, and, probably, Venus.|$|E
5|$|As supercells and <b>multi-cell</b> {{thunderstorms}} dissipate {{due to a}} weak {{shear force}} or poor lifting mechanisms, (e.g. considerable terrain or lack of daytime heating) the gust front associated with them may outrun the squall line itself and the synoptic scale {{area of low pressure}} may then infill, leading to a weakening of the cold front; essentially, the thunderstorm has exhausted its updrafts, becoming purely a downdraft dominated system. The areas of dissipating squall line thunderstorms may be regions of low CAPE, low humidity, insufficient wind shear, or poor synoptic dynamics (e.g. an upper level low filling) leading to frontolysis.|$|E

In order to highlight the performance of higher order {{sliding mode control}}, it is compared to a simple order of sliding mode control. The results show the higher order sliding mode control is able to eliminate the phenomenon of chattering caused by a simple order of sliding mode control...|$|R
5|$|A back-building thunderstorm, {{commonly}} referred to as a training thunderstorm, is a thunderstorm in which new development takes place on the upwind side (usually the west or southwest side in the Northern Hemisphere), such that the storm seems to remain stationary or propagate in a backward direction. Though the storm often appears stationary on radar, or even moving upwind, this is an illusion. The storm is really a <b>multi-cell</b> storm with new, more vigorous cells that form on the upwind side, replacing older cells that continue to drift downwind. When this happens, catastrophic flooding is possible. In Rapid City, South Dakota, in 1972, an unusual alignment of winds at various levels of the atmosphere combined to produce a continuously training set of cells that dropped an enormous quantity of rain upon the same area, resulting in devastating flash flooding. A similar event occurred in Boscastle, England, on 16 August 2004.|$|E

25|$|A {{squall line}} is an {{organized}} line of thunderstorms. It {{is classified as}} a <b>multi-cell</b> cluster, meaning a thunderstorm complex comprising many individual updrafts. They are also called <b>multi-cell</b> lines. Squalls are sometimes associated with hurricanes or other cyclones, {{but they can also}} occur independently. Most commonly, independent squalls occur along front lines, and may contain heavy precipitation, hail, frequent lightning, dangerous straight line winds, and possibly funnel clouds, tornadoes and waterspouts. Squall lines require significant low-level warmth and humidity, a nearby frontal zone, and vertical wind shear from an angle behind the frontal boundary. The strong winds at the surface are usually a reflection of dry air intruding into the line of storms, which when saturated, falls quickly to ground level due to its much higher density before it spreads out downwind. Significant squall lines with multiple bow echoes are known as derechos.|$|E

2500|$|Theodore Modis and Jonathan Huebner {{argue that}} the rate of {{technological}} innovation has not only ceased to rise, but is actually now declining. Evidence for this decline is that the rise in computer clock rates is slowing, even while Moore's prediction of exponentially increasing circuit density continues to hold. This is due to excessive heat build-up from the chip, which cannot be dissipated quickly enough to prevent the chip from melting when operating at higher speeds. Advancements in speed may be possible in the future by virtue of more power-efficient CPU designs and <b>multi-cell</b> processors. While Kurzweil used Modis' resources, and Modis' work was around accelerating change, Modis distanced himself from Kurzweil's thesis of a [...] "technological singularity", claiming that it lacks scientific rigor.|$|E

Finally, we propose an optimal prioritized channel assignment for <b>multi-cells</b> cellular networks with two classes of voice users...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Waveforms {{measurements}} at internal nodes of MMICs are essentials for {{the analysis}} of both operating conditions and reliability aspects. Currently, the Large Signal Network Analyser (LSNA) is the most suitable time domain measurement setup. We propose, in this paper to associate the LSNA with high impedance probes (HIPs) and to do a new calibration procedure, in order to perform measurements at internals ports of <b>multi-cells</b> power amplifiers. Our novel measurement setup enables an easy and fast way to get corrected time domain waveforms measurements. The HIP calibration and measurement procedures can be easily added to the original LSNA driver software. Indead, the HIPs are considered like a classical test-set through the software and do not modify the traditionnal use of LSNA. This work is applicated here to the caracterisation of a class F amplifier at S band. I...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{trends in}} the {{flexible}} manufacturing systems are morphing cell control for the shop-wide production operation system and providing the integrated operation and execution system together with vendor-specific FMC/FMS platform. In these requirements, the shop-floor level operation system plays a role of coordinating the control activity of each cell, and has to provide flexibility for the complexity of mixed operations of various cells. This paper suggests a system architecture for the mixed environments of <b>multi-cells</b> and job shop, its corresponding enabling technologies based on comparative studies with other related studies and commercialized systems. This approach includes a process definition model considering the integration with upper BOM-BOP and external service modules, and reconfigurable device-level interface which provides dynamic interconnections with machine tools and cell controllers.

30|$|Nowadays, {{multimedia}} services over wireless {{networks are}} increasingly popular. With multicast, many mobile stations {{can join the}} same video group and share the same radio resource to efficiently increase frequency utilization. However, users may be located at different positions, and so suffer different degrees of path loss and interference, and receive a different signal-to-interference and noise ratio (SINR). Users at the cell-edge receiving a lower SINR may degrade the multicast efficiency. In this article, we propose four schemes that consider fractional frequency reuse (FFR) over relay networks in <b>multi-cells.</b> With FFR, users close to a base station (BS) are given more resources to improve the video quality. An efficient resource allocation scheme is also proposed. Compared to the conventional relay scheme, the proposed schemes can provide over 10 % more video layers for all users and give better video quality for users near the BS.|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Load {{balancing}} among <b>multi-cells</b> in 3 GPP Long Term Evolution (LTE) networks with heterogeneous {{services is}} investigated. It is formulated as a multi-objective optimization problem, {{the objectives of}} which are load balancing index of services with QoS requirements and network utility of other services.
