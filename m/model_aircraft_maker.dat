50|$|The {{history of}} AEKKEA (Anonymos Etaireia Kataskevis Kai Ekmetallefseos Aeroplanon - Societe Anonyme Pour la Fabrication et l'Exploitation des Avions Raab), an <b>aircraft</b> <b>maker</b> based in Greece, is {{connected}} {{with the history of}} a talented German aircraft designer, Antonius Raab (his first name alternatively known as Antonios, in Greek, and Antonio, in Spanish after his involvement in Spain).|$|R
50|$|In 1981, in {{recognition}} of the safety issues raised by the operation of <b>model</b> <b>aircraft,</b> the FAA published this brief AC for the purpose of providing guidance to persons interested in flying <b>model</b> <b>aircraft</b> as a hobby or for recreational use. This guidance encourages good judgment on the part of <b>model</b> <b>aircraft</b> operators so that persons on the ground or other aircraft in flight will not be endangered. The AC contains among other things, guidance for site selection. Users are advised to avoid noise sensitive areas such as parks, schools, hospitals, and churches. Hobbyists are advised not to fly in the vicinity of spectators until they are confident that the <b>model</b> <b>aircraft</b> has been flight tested and proven airworthy. <b>Model</b> <b>aircraft</b> should be flown below 400 feet above the surface to avoid other aircraft in flight. The FAA expects that hobbyists will operate these recreational <b>model</b> <b>aircraft</b> within visual line-of-sight.|$|R
50|$|AC 91 - 57 is an FAA Advisory Circular (AC) (Subject: <b>Model</b> <b>Aircraft</b> Operating Standards) that outlines, and {{encourages}} voluntary compliance with, safety standards for <b>model</b> <b>aircraft</b> operators.|$|R
50|$|Companies {{based at}} the {{airfield}} include: Thruster <b>Aircraft,</b> <b>makers</b> of microlights; Fly365 Ltd which offers pleasure flights; and hauliers Rase Distribution. Pilots approaching the airfield have to initially contact the control tower at RAF Waddington. The local company Game Composites Limited uses this aerodrome for flight testing and development. Their aerobatic monoplane undertook its first flight from Wickenby during 2015.|$|R
50|$|In November 2013, the FAA {{informed}} CP Air that {{it would}} be sometime in 2014 before they can complete review of the revised application. CEO John Selvaggio told a reporter that the employees had been furloughed and he was returning to his Florida home. The one aircraft delivered was returned to the <b>aircraft</b> <b>maker</b> to save the reported $200,000 monthly rent.|$|R
50|$|The {{success of}} the parasol winged Fokker D.VIII in 1918 led several German <b>aircraft</b> <b>makers</b> to follow suit. The E.III was Kondor's {{interpretation}} {{of this kind of}} single-seat monoplane (E for Eindekker in this company designation), though it was later given the service designation D.I, a potential source of confusion given the Kondor D.I biplane (company name)) flown the year before.|$|R
5000|$|The [...] "Lycée professionnel régional Maryse Bastié" [...] in Hayange-Marspich, the [...] "Lycée Maryse Bastié" [...] in Limoges, and the [...] "College Maryse Bastié" [...] in Reims {{are named}} in her memory.

50|$|Among <b>model</b> <b>aircraft</b> hobbyists, the {{ducted fan}} is popular with {{builders}} of high-performance radio controlled <b>model</b> <b>aircraft.</b> Internal-combustion glow engines combined with ducted-fan units {{were the first}} achievable means of modeling a scaled-size jet aircraft. Despite the introduction of model-scale turbojet engines, electric-powered ducted fans remain popular on smaller, lower-cost <b>model</b> <b>aircraft.</b> Some electric-powered ducted fan airplanes can reach speeds of more than 320km/h (200mph).|$|R
50|$|The {{relation}} of UAVs to remote controlled <b>model</b> <b>aircraft</b> is unclear. UAVs {{may or may}} not include <b>model</b> <b>aircraft.</b> Some jurisdictions base their definition on size or weight, however, the US Federal Aviation Administration defines any unmanned flying craft as a UAV regardless of size. For recreational uses, a drone (as apposed to a UAV) is a <b>model</b> <b>aircraft</b> that has first person video, autonomous capabilities or both.|$|R
50|$|It is {{most popular}} for <b>model</b> <b>aircraft</b> flying clubs like the Midlands Large <b>Model</b> <b>Aircraft</b> Flying Club to fly their planes at special events here. It {{is one of}} the {{smallest}} aviation hubs in Devon.|$|R
5000|$|... {{held that}} the FAA’s Registration Rule for <b>model</b> <b>aircraft</b> (a/k/a drones) violates Section 336 of the FAA Modernization and Reform Act and vacated the FAA's Registration Rule to the extent it applied to <b>model</b> <b>aircraft.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The FAA Modernization and Reform Act of 2012 established, in Section 336, {{a special}} rule for <b>model</b> <b>aircraft.</b> In Section 336, Congress {{confirmed}} the FAA’s long-standing position that <b>model</b> <b>aircraft</b> are aircraft. Under {{the terms of}} the Act, a <b>model</b> <b>aircraft</b> is defined as [...] "an unmanned aircraft" [...] that is [...] "(1) capable of sustained flight in the atmosphere; (2) flown within visual line of sight of the person operating the aircraft; and (3) flown for hobby or recreational purposes." ...|$|R
50|$|In around 1967 Carpenter {{began work}} at Boeing Computer Services (a part of <b>aircraft</b> <b>maker</b> Boeing) in Seattle, Washington. During his time there Carpenter studied for a B.S. in Mathematics (1974) and an M.S. in Computer Science (1976), {{both from the}} University of Washington. Some of his work {{concerned}} using computer technology to improve Boeing's mechanical design processes, which were still entirely done by hand on paper.|$|R
50|$|Heinkel {{produced}} {{three different}} designs {{of the project}} which were submitted in February 1945. The high-altitude fighter designs brought forward by other German <b>aircraft</b> <b>makers</b> were the Messerschmitt P.1110, Focke-Wulf Ta 183 Huckebein, Blohm & Voss P 212 and the Junkers EF 128, the official winner of the competition. After being subject to severe criticism, the project was cancelled by Heinkel {{at the end of}} February 1945.|$|R
50|$|The {{project would}} be soon dropped {{in favor of}} the more {{conventional}} other two, but in the end the Junkers EF 128 was chosen as the official winner of the competition and none of the Messerschmitt designs reached the prototype stage. The designs brought forward by other German <b>aircraft</b> <b>makers</b> were the Heinkel P.1078, the Focke-Wul f Ta 183 and the Blohm & Voss P 212.|$|R
5000|$|Born in Härnösand, Sweden, he {{received}} a diploma in mechanical engineering from Härnösand Läroverk in 1939. In 1942 he started working for the <b>aircraft</b> <b>maker</b> Saab as an aircraft designer and helped develop ejection seats. In 1958 he joined Volvo as a safety engineer. He is credited with {{the invention of the}} modern 3-point safety belt, now a standard safety feature in all cars.|$|R
50|$|The {{improved}} concepts enable <b>aircraft</b> <b>makers</b> {{to customize}} cockpits {{to a greater}} degree than previously. All of the manufacturers involved have chosen to do so in one way or another—such as using a trackball, thumb pad or joystick as a pilot-input device in a computer-style environment. Many of the modifications offered by the aircraft manufacturers improve situational awareness and customize the human-machine interface to increase safety.|$|R
50|$|At present Essex Skypark {{is home to}} {{a number}} of antique and {{experimental}} amateur built aircraft in addition to more modern <b>aircraft.</b> The Chesapeake <b>Model</b> <b>Aircraft</b> Association members fly their <b>model</b> <b>aircraft</b> from a small runway at the airport.|$|R
