5000|$|Doing {{away with}} the Spanish {{autonomic}} state. UPyD wants Spain to adopt a system of symmetric federalism with broad political centralization as a territorial model, clearly defining in the Constitution which powers are exclusive of the State and which ones are transferable to autonomous communities or municipalities. The party wants to centralize competences that concern citizens' fundamental rights like education, health and justice among others because the State of Autonomies, besides creating nationwide inequalities, {{is considered to be}} [...] "elephantine, politically unviable and economically unsustainable". Another aspect of UPyD's symmetric federalism is the abolition of Navarre's and the Basque Country's chartered regimes, establishing a common system of funding for all autonomous communities. Other noteworthy proposals are municipal mergers so that municipalities have a <b>minimum</b> <b>dimension</b> of 20,000 inhabitants, the suppression of the provincial councils (diputaciones provinciales), chartered councils (diputaciones forales), Basque General Assemblies (Juntas Generales vascas) and district councils (comarcas), and the unicameralism of the Spanish General Courts after eliminating the Senate.|$|E

40|$|AIMS: To {{establish}} the <b>minimum</b> <b>dimensions</b> for a non-precious cast metal occlusal rest by using mathematical analysis. An occlusal {{rest in a}} removable partial denture (RPD) provides vertical support and allows occlusal forces to be transmitted through the long axis of the abutment tooth. METHODS: The stress status of an occlusal rest in a posterior tooth-bounded RPD resembles that of a cantilever beam under a uniformly distributed load. A mathematical model based on a short rectangular cantilever beam was derived by using the yield strengths of a cast cobalt-chromium alloy and a cast titanium alloy (Ti- 6 Al- 4 V), with an applied static occlusal force of 400 N. RESULTS: For the cobalt-chromium alloy, the <b>minimum</b> rectangular <b>dimensions</b> for a 2. 0 mm long occlusal rest are; when the width is 2. 0 mm, the depth or thickness {{should be at least}} 1. 03 mm. For the titanium alloy, the <b>minimum</b> <b>dimensions</b> are; when the width is 2. 0 mm, the depth or thickness should be at least 0. 85 mm. A decrease in the occlusal width will increase the bending stress, requiring a thicker rest for compensation, which may lead to dentin exposure during the rest seat preparation. CONCLUSION: The mathematical analysis found that the traditional spoon-shaped occlusal rest seat dimensions comply with the mechanical requirements for non-precious cast metal occlusal rests in RPDs.

5000|$|He wrote several {{papers on}} {{dimension}} theory (a topic that {{had also been}} of interest to Brouwer). His first work on this subject, in his thesis, concerned the compactness degree of a space: this is a number, defined to be &minus;1 for a compact space, and 1 + x if every point in the space has a neighbourhood the boundary of which has compactness degree x. He made an important conjecture, only solved much later in 1982 by Pol and 1988 by Kimura, that the compactness degree {{was the same as}} the <b>minimum</b> <b>dimension</b> of a set that could be adjoined to the space to compactify it. Thus, for instance the familiar Euclidean space has compactness degree zero; it is not compact itself, but every point has a neighborhood bounded by a compact sphere. This compactness degree, zero, equals the dimension of the single point that may be added to Euclidean space to form its one-point compactification. A detailed review of de Groot's compactness degree problem and its relation to other definitions of dimension for topological spaces is provided by Koetsier and van Mill ...|$|E
