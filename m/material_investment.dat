40|$|Household {{bargaining}} theory {{predicts that}} as a woman’s income increases relative to a man’s, violence against her should decrease. We estimate the impact of women’s relative wage on domestic violence.

We find that as the wage gap decreases, violence against women likewise decreases. The relationship between relative wages and domestic violence provides an alternative explanation for the well-established finding that child health improves when mothers control a greater share of the household resources. While previous work has largely attributed these improvements to women's greater <b>material</b> <b>investments</b> in their children, we provide evidence based on birth outcomes that reductions in violence brought about by an increase in women's relative wages are responsible for a greater share of the improvements in child health than are increases in <b>material</b> <b>investments.</b> This work sheds new light on the health production process as well as observed income gradients in health, suggesting that the higher rates of violence against poor women explains 15 percent of the observed income gradients in health...|$|R

We tested this idea in the praying mantid Tenodera sinensis. Males and females were fed differently radiolabelled crickets and allowed to mate. Half of the pairs progressed to sexual cannibalism and we prevented cannibalism in the other half. We assess the relative allocation of both male-derived somatic materials and ejaculate materials into the eggs and soma of the female.
