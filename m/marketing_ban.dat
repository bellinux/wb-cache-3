5000|$|The National Supervisory Authority of Welfare and Health (Valvira) {{declared}} that the new tobacco <b>marketing</b> <b>ban</b> (effective 1 January 2012) would also cover e-cigarettes, resulting in that Finnish stores or web stores can't advertise e-cigarettes because they might look like regular cigarettes. In theory, e-cigarettes with nicotine-free cartridges may still be sold, {{as long as their}} images and prices are not visible. Ordering from abroad remains allowed. Sale of nicotine cartridges is currently prohibited, as nicotine is considered a prescription drug requiring an authorization that such cartridges do not yet have. However, the Finnish authorities have decided that nicotine cartridges containing less than 10 mg nicotine, and e-liquid containing less than 0.42 g nicotine per bottle, may be legally brought in from other countries for private use. If the nicotine content is higher, a prescription from a Finnish physician is required. From a country within the European Economic Area a maximum of one year's supply may be brought in for private use when returning to Finland, while three months' supply may be brought in from outside the EEA. Mail-order deliveries from EEA countries, for a maximum of three months' supply, are also allowed.|$|E
5000|$|In Case E-3/00 Kellogg’s, the EFTA Court had {{to rule on}} the {{compatibility}} with Article 11 EEA of {{a ban on the}} import and marketing in Norway of Kellogg’s cornflakes fortified with vitamins and iron which have been lawfully manufactured and marketed in other EEA States. It rejected the argument of the Norwegian government that in order to justify a <b>marketing</b> <b>ban</b> on fortified cornflakes produced in Denmark it was sufficient to show the absence of a nutritional need for the fortification with vitamins and iron in the Norwegian population because of the government had already taken care of the problem by giving out certain fortified products to school children on a regular basis. At the same time, the EFTA Court held that in examining whether the marketing of fortified cornflakes that were produced in Denmark may be banned on grounds of the protection of human health, a national government may, in the absence of harmonization, invoke the precautionary principle. According to that principle, it is sufficient to show that there is relevant scientific uncertainty with regard to the risk in question. The Court stated that measures taken must be based on scientific evidence; they must be proportionate, non-discriminatory, transparent, and consistent with similar measures already taken. The conditions to be fulfilled by a proper application of the precautionary principle were, {{in the view of the}} Court, first, an identification of potentially negative health consequences, and secondly, a comprehensive evaluation of the risk to health, which must be based on the most recent scientific information. The EFTA Court added that the precautionary principle can never justify the adoption of arbitrary decisions and can justify the pursuit of the objective of “zero risk” only in the most exceptional circumstances. Since the Norwegian fortification policy did not, at the relevant time, fulfil the requirements of EEA law pertaining to the application of that principle, the Court came to the conclusion that Norway had failed to fulfil its obligations under Article 11 EEA. In particular, the measures taken by Norway were considered inconsistent and not based on a comprehensive risk assessment.|$|E

40|$|The European {{cosmetics}} legislation foresees a review in 2011 and possible postponement of the 2013 <b>marketing</b> <b>ban</b> {{to enforce the}} testing ban for systemic and repeated-dose animal tests. For this purpose, a 119 -page report commissioned by the European Commission was published recently. Here, a group of 17 independent experts from the US, Europe, and Japan was brought together to evaluate the report. The expert panel strongly endorsed the report and its conclusions. A number of important options not considered were identified; these do not, however, affect the overall conclusions regarding the current lack of availability of a full replacement, especially for the areas of repeated dose toxicity, carcinogenicity testing, and reproductive toxicity, though a roadmap for change is emerging. However, some of these options may provide adequate data for replacement of some animal studies {{in the near future}} pending validation. Various recommendations expand the original report. The reviewers agree with the report that there is greater promise in the short term for the areas of sensitization and toxicokinetics. Additional opportunities lie in more global collaborations and the inclusion of other industry sectors...|$|E
40|$|Systemic {{toxicity}} testing {{forms the}} cornerstone {{for the safety}} evaluation of substances. Pressures to move from traditional animal models to novel technologies arise from various concerns, including: the need to evaluate large numbers of previously untested chemicals and new products (such as nanoparticles or cell therapies), the limited predictivity of traditional tests for human health effects, duration and costs of current approaches, and animal welfare considerations. The latter holds especially true {{in the context of}} the scheduled 2013 <b>marketing</b> <b>ban</b> on cosmetic ingredients tested for systemic toxicity. Based on a major analysis of the status of alternative methods (Adler et al., 2011) and its independent review (Hartung et al., 2011), the present report proposes a roadmap for how to overcome the acknowledged scientific gaps for the full replacement of systemic toxicity testing using animals. Five whitepapers were commissioned addressing toxicokinetics, skin sensitization, repeated-dose toxicity, carcinogenicity, and reproductive toxicity testing. An expert workshop of 35 participants from Europe and the US discussed and refined these whitepapers, which were subsequently compiled to form the present report. By prioritizing the many options to move the field forward, the expert group hopes to advance regulatory science...|$|E
40|$|Acute {{systemic}} toxicity {{is one of}} the areas of particular concern due to the 2009 deadline set by the 7 th Amendment of the Cosmetics Directive (76 / 768 /EEC), which introduces a testing and <b>marketing</b> <b>ban</b> of cosmetic products with ingredients tested on animals. The scientific community is putting considerable effort into developing and validating non-animal alternatives in this area. However, it is unlikely that validated and regulatory accepted alternative methods and/or strategies will be available in March 2009. Following the initiatives undertaken in the pharmaceutical industry to waive the acute oral toxicity testing before going to clinical studies by using information from other in vivo studies, we proposed an approach to identify non-toxic compounds (LD 50 > 2000 mg/kg) using information from 28 days repeated dose toxicity studies. Taking into account the high prevalence of non-toxic substances (87 %) in the New Chemicals Database, it was possible to set a NOAEL threshold of P 200 mg/kg that allowed the correct identification of 63 % of non-toxic compounds, while < 1 % of harmful compounds were misclassified as non-toxic. Since repeated dose toxicity studies can be performed in vivo until 2013, the proposed approach could have an immediate impact for the testing of cosmetic ingredients. JRC. DDG.

40|$|Provisions of Regulation No 1223 / 2009 on {{cosmetic}} products require that the European Commission reports on a yearly basis to the European Parliament and Council on the progress made in the development, validation and regulatory acceptance of alternative methods and on the compliance with the deadlines of the animal testing and marketing bans. This EURL ECVAM technical report provides an update since 2010 {{on the state of}} play of alternative methods for all the toxicological areas relevant to the Cosmetics Regulation and supplements the 2013 Commission Communication on the animal testing and <b>marketing</b> <b>ban</b> and on the state of play in relation to alternative methods in the field of cosmetics.

The future is bright however, since considerable advances in new in vitro technologies, systems biology, bioinformatics and computational modelling are driving a paradigm shift in toxicological testing and assessment where non-animal methods will ultimately become the tools of choice.

40|$|ECVAM {{was created}} in 1991 further to Directive 86 / 609 /EEC on the {{protection}} of animals used for experimental and other scientific purposes which prescribes to use alternative methods whenever possible. As a service of the EU Joint Research Centre, ECVAM has pioneered the validation process and became a proactive facilitator for effective animal protection, especially {{in the field of}} regulatory toxicology. The field of alternatives is currently driven by the expectations from both cosmetics and chemicals policies: The 7 th amendment to the Cosmetics Directive published in 2003 foresees to phase out animal experiments completely within 10 years. A timetable for the phasing out of the individual animal tests published by the European Commission in September 2004 had been supported by a taskforce of stakeholders chaired by ECVAM. The legislation is reinforced by an immediate testing ban for finished products and for all the human health effects, for which alternative methods have been validated by ECVAM. Furthermore, a testing ban and a <b>marketing</b> <b>ban,</b> which cannot be postponed, apply in 6 years for topical and acute systemic toxicity, while the animal tests for all the other human health effects should be phased out in 10 years with a possible postponement by codecision procedure. The legislation for chemicals (REACH) is only emerging. It foresees data requirements for more than 30. 000 substances produced at levels above 1 ton per year. Extensive in vivo data requirements are expected for a core of about 6. 000 substances with highest production and concern. Alternative methods shall first be considered throughout the testing and be predominantly used for the largest group of chemicals, namely those produced between 1 - 10 tons per year. A Commission proposal as to the legislation has been handed to the European Parliament and Council, and is currently under consultation. ECVAM has restructured its services directly targeting the animal tests to be replaced by in vitro and in silico approaches. Given the short time-lines to make available and implement validated methods, ECVAM is offering to steer the process of making validated alternatives available by bundling the inputs of stakeholders and by involving regulators in the process at an early stage. Steering groups composed of ECVAM’s senior staff and complemented by external experts carry out the project management, which co-ordinates the various inputs. The collaboration with various stakeholders has also been reinforced. A series of activities including the initiation of three Integrated Projects have put the tailored development and validation of alternative methods on a new scale. JRC.

The desideratum we concentrate on is discriminationfreeness, i. e. one 2 ̆ 019 s access to certain resources is independent of one 2 ̆ 019 s wealth endowment.
