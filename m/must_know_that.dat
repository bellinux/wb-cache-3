5|$|As {{you long}} ago wrote me, {{and told me}} personally, nay predicted, Jackson has thrown me overboard; he is not only unwilling to give me employment, as he promised after I {{declined}} a reelection to Congress, but has in every single instance refused office to my friends, and even respectful consideration to my letters of recommendation to others. Nor does he stop here. I am at this moment enduring the whole weight of the opposition to him, his friends, and the power and patronage of his government to break down myself and my friends in Virginia, and to prevent my reelection to the office I now fill. Without having much reputation for political matters, I have read those folks at Washington thoroughly... I am not of a temper to pocket insult, neglect, or injury. I have, my dear friend, determined on my course. I can be as silent and patient as any of my aboriginal ancestors, and like them I feel that vengeance would be sweet, but when the day of retribution shall come, it will be marked by {{the effects of the}} tomahawk. You <b>must</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> notwithstanding all efforts to prevent it I calculate on a reelection. Then I will begin to formulate a message in which, as you know, my own principles will be maintained.|$|E

25|$|Then the debaters {{return to}} their {{previous}} analysis of Pittacus' and Simonides' poetry. On Socrates' interpretation, Pittacus claims {{that it is difficult}} to be a good man, but presumably possible. Simonides, on the other hand, claims that it is impossible to live without ever being a bad man, and even to be a good man on occasion is difficult (344a45d). Simonides praises those who at least do not do wrong willingly. Socrates' interpretation is that, since Simonides was a wise man, he <b>must</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> no one does any wrong willingly; accordingly, he must mean that he will willingly praise those who do no wrong, not that some do wrong willingly and others unwillingly, only the latter garnering his praise (345d46b). Socrates thus argues that the authority of Simonides does not stand against his understanding of virtue and whether anyone willingly does wrong.|$|E
25|$|Slemmer and Gilman {{stepped aside}} and soon {{returned}} {{to say they}} would reply the next day. Slemmer asked Chase how many men he had, whether he could take the fort by storm and how many men {{he thought he would}} lose. Chase replied that he could take the fort but supposed he might lose half of his force. Slemmer responded that he did not believe Chase was willing to make that sacrifice. Chase said that Slemmer <b>must</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> Florida could not permit the fort to be held and that an attack would start a civil war. Slemmer said he wanted to consult with the captains of two U.S. Navy vessels in the harbor. The next day, as the Navy vessels withdrew, Slemmer refused the demand for surrender of the fort. He refused a similar demand from Chase on January 18, 1861.|$|E

You must have already grasped the stages of Ming Jin and An Jin and {{have a very strong}} foundation in them. You should {{have a lot of experience}} in fighting as you <b>must</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> this stage is 'Sheji Cong Ren' (same as in Taijiquan). Give up yourself and comply with the opponent. Use 'Zhan, Lian, Nian, and Sui' (sticky, link, adhering, and complying). Everywhere you need to be empty and not exerting strength. The whole body must be blending and smooth (hun yuan - smooth roundness) and not starting and stopping. This is the skill of 'The opponent does not know me, I alone know the opponent.' At any time, place, or moment you can emit (fa), but only emitting force at the precise moment. This is the Hua Jing stage.|$|E

500|$|Most of the 1873 {{production}} was exported to China, and in October of that year, the Tongzhi Emperor had an assay test {{conducted on the}} coins.

At the same time rogues, sharpers, and the like, are hereby strictly forbidden to fabricate spurious imitations of this new Eagle Dollar, with a view to their own profit.

Let there be no disobedience! ...|$|E
500|$|Peter Westen and H. L. A. Hart {{argue that}} throffers {{are not always}} coercive, and, when they are, it is {{specifically}} the threat that makes them so. For a throffer to be coercive, they claim, the threat must meet three further conditions; firstly, the person making the throffer [...] "must be intentionally bringing the threat to bear on X in order that X do something, Z1", secondly, the person making the throffer <b>must</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> [...] "X would not otherwise do or wish to be constrained to do" [...] Z1, and, thirdly, the threat part of the throffer must render [...] "X's option of doing Z1 more eligible in X's eyes than it would otherwise be". As such, for the authors, {{there is the possibility}} of non-coercive throffers. The pair present three possible examples. Firstly, when the threat aspect of the throffer is a joke; secondly, when the offer aspect is already so desirable to the subject that the threat does not affect their decision-making; or, thirdly, when the subject mistakenly believes the threat immaterial because of the attractiveness of the offer. Rhodes similarly concludes that if a throffer is coercive, it is because of the threatening aspect. For him, the question is [...] "whether one regards the threat component of a throffer as both a necessary and sufficient condition of the performance of a behaviour". He argues that if the offer without the threat would have been enough for the agent subject to the proposal to act, then the proposal is not coercive. However, if both offer and threat aspects of the throffer are motivating factors, then it is tricky to determine whether the agent subject to the proposal was coerced. He suggests that differentiating between [...] "pure coercion" [...] and [...] "partial coercion" [...] may help solve this problem, and that the question of coercion in these cases is one of degree.|$|E

2500|$|Armstrong {{presents}} {{a response to}} Colin Radford's {{modified version of the}} [...] "unconfident examinee" [...] example. A student is asked when Queen Elizabeth I died, and he hesitatingly answers [...] "1603" [...] and exhibits no confidence in his answer. He has forgotten that at some point previously, he studied English history. Radford presents this as an example of knowledge without belief. But Armstrong differs on this: the unconfident examinee has a belief that Queen Elizabeth I died in 1603, he knows that she died in 1603, but he does not know that he knows. Armstrong rejects the KK Principle—that to know some thing p, one <b>must</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> one knows p.

2500|$|In {{the early}} years of his reign, Edward IV's {{governance}} of England was dependent upon a small circle of supporters, most notably his cousin, Richard Neville, Earl of Warwick. At around the time of Edward IV's secret marriage, Warwick was negotiating an alliance with France in an effort to thwart a similar arrangement being made by his sworn enemy Margaret of Anjou, wife of the deposed Henry VI. The plan was that Edward IV should marry a French princess. When his marriage to Elizabeth Woodville, who was both a commoner and from a family of Lancastrian supporters, became public, Warwick was both embarrassed and offended, and his relationship with Edward IV never recovered. The match was also badly received by the Privy Council, who according to Jean de Waurin told Edward with great frankness that [...] "he <b>must</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> she was no wife for a prince such as himself".|$|E
