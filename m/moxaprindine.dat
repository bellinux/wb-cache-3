40|$|The {{antiarrhythmic}} {{activity of}} intravenous <b>moxaprindine</b> was evaluated in 26 patients with cardiovascular disease; the mean maximum dose was 2. 5 +/- 0. 12 mg/kg. Ventricular extopics were completely abolished in 19 patients and significantly reduced in four patients, {{but were not}} favourably affected in three patients. In one patient with numerous runs of ventricular tachycardia, normal sinus rhythm was restored. Coupled ventricular ectopic activity always completely disappeared. At the maximum dose, the PR-interval (+ 27. 7 +/- 3. 3 %), the QRS-duration (+ 24. 6 +/- 2. 2 %), the QT-interval (+ 17. 0 +/- 1. 5 %) and the QTc-interval (+ 10. 8 +/- 1. 2 %) were significantly prolonged. The QRS morphology essentially remained unchanged. <b>Moxaprindine</b> caused first degree atrioventricular block in eight patients. The sinus rate was slowed at every dosage level. Nevertheless, <b>moxaprindine</b> could safely be administered to patients with dysfunction of the specialized conduction system, or with a damaged myocardium. Serious side effects did not occur. <b>Moxaprindine</b> is a promising new antiarrhythmic drug {{for the treatment of}} ventricular arrhythmias, but its value and safely in the chronic oral treatment of these arrhythmias remain to be established. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Aprindine, {{a potent}} {{anti-arrhythmic}} agent, occasionally seems responsible for agranulocytosis. In order to study its potential haematological toxicity, 3 different in vitro tests were used: (a) {{the capacity of}} human and mice bone marrow to incorporate tritiated thymidine (3 HTdR), (b) the capacity of stimulated human blood lymphocytes to incorporate 3 HTdR and (c) the capacity of human granulocyte-macrophage stem cells to form colonies in agar. For all these tests aprindine {{was found to be}} toxic at concentrations close to the clinical therapeutic serum concentration. <b>Moxaprindine,</b> chemically very close to aprindine exhibits also an anti-arrhythmic activity. It was examined in the same tests in parallel with the study af aprindine. <b>Moxaprindine</b> also exhibited haematological toxicity in the tests but at a significantly higher concentration, approximately twice that of aprindine. Assuming that these in vitro tests are relevant to the in vivo haematological toxicity, <b>moxaprindine</b> could be considered a clinically safer anti-arrhythmic agent than aprindine.

40|$|<b>Moxaprindine,</b> a new {{anti-arrhythmic}} drug, with characteristics {{similar to}} aprindine, {{has been demonstrated}} to be highly effective in suppressing ventricular arrhythmias occurring before, during and after maximal exercise stress testing. This effect was obtained both in subjects with clinically normal hearts and in {{a limited number of}} patients with ischemic heart disease. These findings demonstrate the efficacy and safety of anti-arrhythmic treatment by drugs prolonging ventricular depolarization for ventricular arrhythmias occurring during exercise. status: publishe...|$|E
