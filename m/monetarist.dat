5|$|Monetarism {{attracted}} the attention of policy makers in the late-1970s and 1980s. Friedman and Phelps's version of the Phillips curve performed better during stagflation and gave monetarism a boost in credibility. By the mid-1970s monetarism had become the new orthodoxy in macroeconomics, and by the late-1970s central banks in the United Kingdom and United States had largely adopted a <b>monetarist</b> policy of targeting money supply instead of interest rates when setting policy. However, targeting monetary aggregates proved difficult for central banks because of measurement difficulties. Monetarism faced a major test when Paul Volcker took over the Federal Reserve Chairmanship in 1979. Volcker tightened the money supply and brought inflation down, creating a severe recession in the process. The recession lessened monetarism's popularity but clearly demonstrated the importance of money supply in the economy. Monetarism became less credible when once-stable money velocity defied <b>monetarist</b> predictions and began to move erratically in the United States during the early 1980s. <b>Monetarist</b> methods of single-equation models and non-statistical analysis of plotted data also lost out to the simultaneous-equation modeling favored by Keynesians. Monetarism's policies and method of analysis lost influence among central bankers and academics, but its core tenets of the long-run neutrality of money (increases in money supply cannot have long-term effects on real variables, such as output) and use of monetary policy for stabilization became a part of the macroeconomic mainstream even among Keynesians.|$|E
5|$|Thatcher's {{economic}} policy {{was influenced by}} <b>monetarist</b> thinking and economists such as Milton Friedman and Alan Walters. Together with Chancellor of the Exchequer Geoffrey Howe, she lowered direct taxes on income and increased indirect taxes. She increased interest rates to slow {{the growth of the}} money supply and thereby lower inflation, introduced cash limits on public spending, and reduced expenditure on social services such as education and housing. Cuts to higher education resulted in her becoming the first Oxford-educated post-war Prime Minister without an honorary doctorate from Oxford University, after a 738–319 vote of the governing assembly and a student petition.|$|E
5|$|Thatcher's premiership {{was also}} marked by periods of high {{unemployment}} and social unrest, and many critics {{on the left}} of the political spectrum fault her economic policies for the unemployment level; many of the areas affected by mass unemployment as well as her <b>monetarist</b> economic policies remained blighted for decades, by such social problems as drug abuse and family breakdown. Unemployment did not fall below its 1979 level during her tenure, although in June 1990 the recorded rate (5.4%) was lower than the rate in April 1979 (5.5%). The long-term effects of her policies on manufacturing remain contentious.|$|E
50|$|There was {{debate between}} <b>Monetarists</b> and Keynesians in the 1960s {{over the role}} of {{government}} in stabilizing the economy. Both <b>Monetarists</b> and Keynesians agree that issues such as business cycles, unemployment, and deflation are caused by inadequate demand. However, they had fundamentally different perspectives on the capacity of the economy to find its own equilibrium, and the degree of government intervention that would be appropriate. Keynesians emphasized the use of discretionary fiscal policy and monetary policy, while <b>monetarists</b> argued the primacy of monetary policy, and that it should be rules-based.|$|R
5000|$|Market monetarism is {{a school}} of {{macroeconomic}} thought that advocates that central banks target the level of nominal income instead of inflation, unemployment, or other measures of economic activity, including in times of shocks such as the bursting {{of the real estate}} bubble in 2006, and in the financial crisis that followed. In contrast to traditional <b>monetarists,</b> market <b>monetarists</b> do not believe monetary aggregates or commodity prices such as gold are the optimal guide to intervention. Market <b>monetarists</b> also reject the New Keynesian focus on interest rates as the primary instrument of monetary policy. Market <b>monetarists</b> prefer a nominal income target due to their twin beliefs that rational expectations are crucial to policy, and that markets react instantly to changes in their expectations about future policy, without the [...] "long and variable lags" [...] postulated by Milton Friedman.|$|R
40|$|Market Monetarism is {{the first}} {{economic}} school to be born out of the blogosphere. Market Monetarism shares many of the views of traditional monetarism but unlike traditional monetarism Market Monetarism is sceptical about the usefulness of monetary aggregates as policy instruments and as an indicator for the monetary policy stance. Instead, Market <b>Monetarists</b> recommend using market pricing to evaluate the {{stance of monetary policy}} and as a policy instrument. Contrary to traditional monetarists- who recommend a rule for money supply growth- Market <b>Monetarists</b> recommend targeting the Nominal GDP (NGDP) level. The view of the leading Market <b>Monetarists</b> is that the Great Recession was not caused by a banking crisis but rather by excessively tight monetary policy. This is the so-called Monetary Disorder view of the Great Recession...|$|R
5|$|The global {{financial}} crisis of 2007–08 led to public {{skepticism about the}} free market consensus even from some on the economic right. In March 2008, Martin Wolf, chief economics commentator at the Financial Times, announced {{the death of the}} dream of global free-market capitalism. In the same month macroeconomist James K. Galbraith used the 25th Annual Milton Friedman Distinguished Lecture to launch a sweeping attack against the consensus for <b>monetarist</b> economics and argued that Keynesian economics were far more relevant for tackling the emerging crises.|$|E
5|$|Influenced by Keynes, {{economics}} {{texts in}} the immediate post-war period put a significant emphasis on balance in trade. For example, the second edition of the popular introductory textbook, An Outline of Money, devoted the last three of its ten chapters to questions of foreign exchange management {{and in particular the}} 'problem of balance'. However, in more recent years, {{since the end of the}} Bretton Woods system in 1971, with the increasing influence of <b>Monetarist</b> schools of thought in the 1980s, and particularly in the face of large sustained trade imbalances, these concerns – and particularly concerns about the destabilising effects of large trade surpluses – have largely disappeared from mainstream economics discourse and Keynes' insights have slipped from view. They are receiving some attention again in the wake of the financial crisis of 2007–08.|$|E

5000|$|Market <b>monetarists</b> {{generally}} {{support a}} [...] "rules-based" [...] policy {{that they believe}} would increase economic stability. In particular, they criticize some tools of monetary policy, such as quantitative easing, for being too discretionary. Market <b>monetarists</b> advocate that the central bank clearly express an NGDP target (such as 5-6 percent annual NGDP growth in ordinary times) and for the central bank to use its policy tools to adjust NGDP until NGDP futures markets predict that the target will be achieved.|$|R
2500|$|Theorists of the [...] "Austrian School" [...] {{who wrote}} about the Depression include Austrian {{economist}} Friedrich Hayek and American economist Murray Rothbard, who wrote America's Great Depression (1963). In their view and like the <b>monetarists,</b> the Federal Reserve, which was created in 1913, shoulders much of the blame; but {{in opposition to the}} <b>monetarists,</b> they argue that the key cause of the Depression was the expansion of the money supply in the 1920s that led to an unsustainable credit-driven boom.|$|R
25|$|Monetarism {{succeeded in}} {{bringing}} down inflation, {{but at the}} cost of unemployment rates in excess of 10%, causing the deepest recession seen in the developed countries {{since the end of the}} Great Depression and severe debt crises in the developing world. Contrary to <b>monetarist</b> predictions, the relationship between the money supply and the price level proved unreliable in the short- to medium-term. Another <b>monetarist</b> prediction not borne out in practice was that the velocity of money did not remain constant, in fact it dropped sharply. The US Federal Reserve began increasing the money supply above monetarist-advised thresholds with no effect on inflation, and discarded monetarism in 1984. The Bank of England likewise abandoned its sterling M3 money targeting in October 1985.|$|E
25|$|By {{reducing}} or eliminating decades-long social programs, {{while at}} the same time lowering taxes and marginal tax rates, Reagan's approach to handling the economy marked a significant departure from that of many of his predecessor's Keynesian policies. Milton Friedman, the <b>monetarist</b> economist who was an intellectual architect of free-market policies, was a primary influence on Reagan.|$|E
25|$|The Chicago School of {{economics}} {{is best known}} for its free market advocacy and <b>monetarist</b> ideas.

5|$|New classicals {{broke with}} Keynesian {{economic}} theory completely while <b>monetarists</b> had built on Keynesian ideas.

25|$|Along with these, Reagan reappointed Paul Volcker as Chairman of the Federal Reserve, {{as well as}} the <b>monetarist</b> Alan Greenspan {{to succeed}} him in 1987. He {{preserved}} the core New Deal safeguards, such as the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), the GI Bill and Social Security, while rolling back what he viewed as the excesses of 1960s and 1970s liberal policies.|$|E
25|$|In {{the world}} of {{practical}} policy-making as opposed to economics as an academic discipline, the <b>monetarist</b> experiments in both the US and the UK in the early 1980s were the pinnacle of anti-Keynesian {{and the rise of}} perfect competition influence. The strong form of monetarism being tested at this time asserted that fiscal policy is of no effect, and that monetary policy should only try to target the money supply to control inflation, without attempting to target real interest rates. This was in contrast to the Keynesian view that monetary policy should target interest rates, which it held could influence unemployment.|$|E
25|$|But in January 1958 he resigned, {{along with}} the Chancellor of the Exchequer Peter Thorneycroft and his Treasury {{colleague}} Nigel Birch, in protest at government plans for increased expenditure; he was a staunch advocate of disinflation, or, in modern terms, a <b>monetarist,</b> and a believer in market forces. Powell was {{also a member of}} the Mont Pelerin Society. The by-product of this expenditure was the printing of extra money to pay for it all, which Powell believed to be the cause of inflation, and in effect a form of taxation, as the holders of money find their money is worth less. Inflation rose to 2.5%, a high figure for the era, especially in peacetime.|$|E
50|$|British {{classical}} economists in the 19th {{century had}} a well-developed controversy between theBanking and the Currency School. This parallels recent debates between {{proponents of the}} theory of endogeneous money, such as Nicholas Kaldor, and <b>monetarists,</b> such as Milton Friedman. <b>Monetarists</b> and members of the currency school argued that banks can and should control the supply of money. According to their theories, inflation is caused by banks issuing an excessive supply of money. According to proponents {{of the theory of}} endogenous money, the supply of money automatically adjusts to the demand, and banks can only control the terms (e.g., the rate of interest) on which loans are made.|$|R

25|$|While Liverpool {{through most}} of the 19th and early 20th Century was a {{municipal}} stronghold of Toryism, support for the Conservative Party recently has been among the lowest in any part of Britain, particularly since the <b>monetarist</b> economic policies of prime minister Margaret Thatcher after her 1979 general election victory contributed to high unemployment in the city which did not begin to fall for many years. Liverpool is one of the Labour Party's key strongholds; however the city has seen hard times under Labour governments as well, particularly in the Winter of Discontent (late 1978 and early 1979) when Liverpool suffered public sector strikes {{along with the rest of}} the United Kingdom but also suffered the particularly humiliating misfortune of having grave-diggers going on strike, leaving the dead unburied.|$|E
25|$|The two {{classical}} competing {{theories of}} the Great Depression are the Keynesian (demand-driven) and the <b>monetarist</b> explanation. There are also various heterodox theories that downplay or reject the explanations of the Keynesians and monetarists. The consensus among demand-driven theories is that a large-scale loss of confidence led to a sudden reduction in consumption and investment spending. Once panic and deflation set in, many people believed they could avoid further losses by keeping clear of the markets. Holding money became profitable as prices dropped lower and a given amount of money bought ever more goods, exacerbating the drop in demand. Monetarists believe that the Great Depression started as an ordinary recession, but the shrinking of the money supply greatly exacerbated the economic situation, causing a recession to descend into the Great Depression.|$|E
25|$|Callaghan's time as Prime Minister was {{dominated}} by the troubles in running a Government with a minority in the House of Commons: {{he was forced to}} make deals with minor parties to survive – including the Lib–Lab pact, and he had been forced to accept a referendum on devolution in Scotland as well as one in Wales (the former went in favour but did not reach the required majority, and the latter went heavily against). He also became prime minister at a time when Britain was suffering from double-digit percentage inflation and rising unemployment. He responded to the economic crises by adopting deflationary policies to reduce inflation, and cutting public expenditure – a precursor to the <b>monetarist</b> economic policies that the next government, a Conservative one led by Margaret Thatcher, would pursue to ease the crises.|$|E
