50|$|Sodium chlorite, {{like many}} {{oxidizing}} agents, {{should be protected}} from inadvertent contamination by organic <b>materials</b> <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> {{the formation of an}} explosive mixture. The chemical is highly stable in pure form and does not explode on percussive impact (unless organic contaminants are present, e.g. a greasy hammer striking the chemical on an anvil) and will also ignite if combined with a strong reducing agent.|$|E

50|$|RPMs {{are also}} {{deployed}} at {{civilian and military}} nuclear facilities to prevent theft of radiological materials.

50|$|In {{the late}} 1970s, DARPA began {{investigating}} {{the use of}} newer composite <b>materials</b> <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> the problem of reduced divergence speed through aeroelastic tailoring. Fly-by-wire technology allowed for the design to be dynamically unstable and improved maneuverability. Grumman built two X-29 technology demonstrators, first flying in 1984, with forward swept wings and canards. Maneuverable at high angles of attack, the X-29 remained controllable at 67° angle of attack.|$|E
50|$|A further {{operational}} {{difficulty in}} coal-fired boilers is the binding of the catalyst by fly ash from the fuel combustion. This requires {{the usage of}} sootblowers, sonic horns, and careful design of the ductwork and catalyst <b>materials</b> <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> plugging by the fly ash. SCR catalysts have a typical operational lifetime of about 16,000-40,000 hours in coal-fired power plants, depending on the flue gas composition, and up to 80,000 hours in cleaner gas-fired power plants.|$|E
50|$|Lightweight {{hand-held}} vacuum cleaners, either powered from {{rechargeable batteries}} or mains power, {{are also popular}} for cleaning up smaller spills. Frequently seen examples include the Black & Decker DustBuster, which was introduced in 1979, and numerous handheld models by Dirt Devil, which were first introduced in 1984. Some battery-powered handheld vacuums are wet/dry rated; the appliance must be partially disassembled and cleaned after picking up wet <b>materials,</b> <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> developing unpleasant odors.|$|E
50|$|Several {{methods are}} known for the {{synthesis}} of gadolinium oxide nanoparticles, mostly based on precipitation of the hydroxide by the reaction of gadolinium ions with hydroxide, followed by thermal dehydration to the oxide.

5000|$|USBA/WBA Founder Drew Serrano, {{producer}} of the documentary [...] "Breaking All Records", encourages practitioners to gradually increase the difficulty and amount of a <b>material</b> <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> injury. He suggests that beginners should start with wood boards and increase the amount as technical prowess increases. Once a level of comfort, both physically and mentally, is reached, harder materials such as concrete can be attempted.|$|R
30|$|The {{bottleneck}} walk passes {{along the}} observed flow line and monitors {{the data of}} different processes and inventories as described above. In the authors’ experience, it is sometimes better to walk against the flow of <b>material</b> <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> walking “with” a single part. This, however, is not a fixed requirement for the bottleneck walk. Furthermore, in practice, {{it is helpful to}} select the spots to be observed beforehand.|$|R
50|$|A {{planar array}} with a {{reflecting}} screen {{is related to}} a radar absorber. Both are supposed not to reflect incoming radiation of the desired wavelength. Radar absorbers have the advantage {{that they can use}} magnetic <b>materials</b> <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> reflections at the interface to air at least for some frequencies. For antennas to be broadband, the transition from air (vacuum) to the metal of the screen has to be a gradual one. Radar absorbers have the advantage {{that they do not have}} to collect the received energy. The antenna needs a 3D tree of twin-leads and chokes to connect a single cable to a large number of micro antennas. Micro dipole antennas are only resonant at a single high frequency, to be broadband the arms of adjoining antennas have to be connected.|$|E
5000|$|Archival {{processing}} often includes basic preservation {{practices such}} as removing staples and paperclips, placing materials in acid-free folders and boxes, isolating acidic <b>materials</b> <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> acid migration, photocopying damaged or acidic documents, and unfolding papers. There has been a trend for archives and manuscript repositories {{in the past few}} years to try new ways to reduce backlogs and provide access to materials as quickly as possible, described and encouraged by the 2005 article “More Product, Less Process: Revamping Traditional Archival Processing” by Mark A. Greene and Dennis Meissner. [...] Their method discourages these basic practices in the interest of accelerating processing to provide quicker access to researchers. It is dependent on proper climate control, which would slow the deterioration of acidic paper and reduce the likelihood that metal fasteners will rust.|$|E

5000|$|At {{the end of}} the 1970s the {{building}} was closed, based on safety reasons. The restoration of the structural condition became unavoidable. For financial reasons it was not effected until 2001 {{within the framework of the}} [...] "Euroga".

5000|$|With computer-generated art, the {{distinction}} between layout and comp has become blurred. Since computer-generated art can evolve as one file over time, finely segmented milestones in the development process have less meaning. With computer-generated art, even the sketch stage is often skipped. This {{has led to a}} two-stage process; comp and finish. The definitions of each milestone are roughly the same as with traditional media. Even in the age of rapid desktop publishing software, comps may be developed using hand-rendering techniques and <b>materials</b> <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> investing too much time on the computer before client approval of the idea, depending on the complexity of the production task. If there is any three-dimensionality to the design (for example, the design is of a box or of a two sided piece) a [...] "physical comp" [...] is preferred to a computerized sketch because fundamental physical relationships (for example, position and show-through of die-cuts, or inadvertently designing Möbius strips) can be missed in a two-dimensional sketch. A hand-rendered comp may be useful in helping the client refrain from [...] "nitpicking" [...] the production quality and focus on the design idea.|$|E
50|$|Although an {{international}} toy safety standard exists, nations {{around the world}} still create their own legislation and standards to address the issue.Current toy safety standards focus on design principles and rely on batch testing of samples to assure safety. As has {{been seen in the}} large scale recalls of 2007, sample testing can miss non-conforming product. A design may be conceptually safe, but without control of the production, the design may not be met by the manufacturer. Similarly, the applicable toy safety standards to which a toy is tested by a laboratory may not discover a hazard in a product: in the case of 2007's magnetic toy recalls and the Bindeez recall, the products in question met the requirements laid down in the applicable safety standard, yet were found to present an inherent risk.Proposed process and quality control standards, similar to the ISO 9000 systems, seek to eliminate production errors and control <b>materials</b> <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> deviation from the design.The creation of manufacturing quality standards for toys will help ensure consistency of production. Using a continual improvement model, production can be subject to constant scrutiny, rather than assuming the compliance of all production by testing random samples.In October and November 2007, mandatory third party testing by companies such as LGA, Eurofins, Bureau Veritas or SGS Consumer Testing Services was proposed by regulators in the EU and US, to a (possibly new) international standard, requiring a new safety mark. There is no indication that the proposals will address manufacturing control.|$|E
