The Gemara, however, taught that {{although}} the Sages wanted to recite the Ten Commandments along with the Shema in precincts outside of the Temple, they soon abolished their recitation, because the Sages {{did not want to}} lend credence to the arguments of the heretics (who <b>might</b> <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> Jews honored only the Ten Commandments).|$|E
25|$|A sorites {{is a form}} of {{argument}} in which a series of incomplete syllogisms is so arranged that the predicate of each premise forms the subject of the next until the subject of the first is joined with the predicate of the last in the conclusion. For example, one <b>might</b> <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> all lions are big cats, all big cats are predators, and all predators are carnivores. To conclude that therefore all lions are carnivores is to construct a sorites argument.|$|E

One <b>might</b> <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> God is supremely good and would not lead him to believe falsely all these things. But by this reasoning we should think that God would not deceive him with regard to anything, and yet this is clearly not true. If we suppose there is no God, then there is even greater likelihood of being deceived, since our imperfect senses {{would not have been}} created by a perfect being.|$|E

25|$|While a principle-based {{approach}} might {{claim that}} lying is always morally wrong, the casuist would argue that, {{depending upon the}} details of the case, lying might or might not be illegal or unethical. The casuist might conclude that a person is wrong to lie in legal testimony under oath, but <b>might</b> <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> lying actually is the best moral choice if the lie saves a life. (Thomas Sanchez and others thus theorized a doctrine of mental reservation, which developed into its own branch of casuistry.) For the casuist, the circumstances of a case are essential for evaluating the proper response.|$|E
25|$|There is {{evidence}} {{to believe that}} the development of theory of mind is closely intertwined with language development in humans. One meta-analysis showed a moderate to strong correlation (r = 0.43) between performance on theory of mind and language tasks. One <b>might</b> <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> this relationship is due solely to the fact that both language and theory of mind seem to begin to develop substantially around the same time in children (between ages 2–5). However, many other abilities develop during this same time period as well, and do not produce such high correlations with one another nor with theory of mind. There must be something else going on to explain the relationship between theory of mind and language.|$|E
25|$|This view is {{not shared}} by Andrew Baruch Wachtel (Making a Nation, Breaking a Nation) who sees him as a {{partisan}} of South Slav unity, albeit in a limited sense, in that his linguistic definition emphasized what united South Slavs rather than the religious differences that had earlier divided them. However, one <b>might</b> <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> such a definition is very partisan: Karadžić himself eloquently and explicitly professed that his aim was to unite all native Shtokavian speakers whom he identified as Serbs. Therefore, Vuk Karadžić's central linguistic-political aim was {{the growth of the}} realm of Serbdom according to his ethnic-linguistic ideas and not a unity of any sort between Serbs and the other nations.|$|E

25|$|As {{early as}} the 15th century, it became the {{practice}} that litigants who felt they had been cheated by the common-law system would petition the King in person. For example, they <b>might</b> <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> an award of damages (at common law (as opposed to equity)) was not sufficient redress for a trespasser occupying their land, and instead request that the trespasser be evicted. From this developed the system of equity, administered by the Lord Chancellor, in the courts of chancery. By their nature, equity and law were frequently in conflict and litigation would frequently continue for years as one court countermanded the other, {{even though it was}} established by the 17th century that equity should prevail.|$|E
500|$|Although she is wise {{beyond her}} years, Lisa has typical {{childhood}} issues, sometimes requiring adult intervention. For example, in [...] "Lost Our Lisa" [...] (season nine, 1998), she tricks Homer into {{allowing her to}} ride the bus alone, only to become hopelessly lost {{and in need of}} aid from her father. Chris Turner writes in Planet Simpson that incidents like this illustrate that [...] "Even when Lisa's lecturing like a college professor or mounting yet another protest, she never becomes a full-grown adult trapped in a child's body." [...] In , Aeon J. Skoble states that although Lisa is an intellectual, she is still portrayed as a character who enjoys normal childhood and girl activities, plays with Malibu Stacy dolls, loves ponies, obsesses over teenage heartthrobs such as Corey, and watches The Itchy and Scratchy Show along with Bart. He writes, [...] "One <b>might</b> <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> this is typical childhood behavior, but since in so many cases Lisa is presented not simply as a prodigy but as preternaturally wise, the fondness for Itchy and Scratchy and Corey seem to be highlighted, taking on greater significance. Lisa is portrayed as the avatar of logic and wisdom, but then she also worships Corey so she's 'no better '." [...] When she became depressed over being unable to pursue her dream as a musician due to inheriting her father's fingers and having to spend her time with Marge in being a homemaker, Lisa gives up on school and becomes a juvenile delinquent in Separate Vocations. She is stopped by Bart who encourages her to keep proving the wrong and pursue her dreams as a musician.|$|E

[...] Rajeev Masand of CNN-IBN gave it four out of five stars and states: [...] "Like those good old-fashioned Hrishikesh Mukherjee films, it also reinforces the importance of human goodness and basic niceties. Even if you <b>might</b> <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> some of Gandhi's principles seem outdated today, you cannot help but cheer for Munna and his gang as they achieve the impossible with love and kindness. And that is where this film transcends conventional boundaries. It entertains you, yes, but it also makes you yearn for a perfect world. Judge it by any yardstick that you may, Lage Raho Munnabhai emerges a clear winner. Much of that credit must go to its actors who pull out all stops to make it an enjoyable ride." [...] Poonam Joshi of the BBC gave four out of five stars stating that, [...] "everything about this film works [...] It's rare to see a film that bounces between humour and sentiment so seamlessly. And it is rarer still to see characters become etched in the memory so enduringly that audiences become almost protective of them. It's testimony both {{to the quality of the}} writing and the performances, that Munna and Circuit have taken on a life of their own." [...] Vinayak Chakravorty of The Hindustan Times gave four out of four stars stating that it [...] "cleverly works its way around the obvious hurdle that almost all sequels face: The film recreates an original milieu without a hint of the déjà vu downer. And that precisely ranks Munna Bhai 2 as one of the best entertainers this year."

40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{an issue}} that has received little attention in the literature on health state evaluation: the relevance of the ex ante/ex post distinction in the assessment of quality of life. Ex post evaluations are based on experience of the health state being evaluated. Ex ante evaluations are made in anticipation of actually experiencing the health state, and are able to capture sources of pre-outcome (dis) utility such as anticipatory fear, anxiety, hope and dread. Which perspective should be used for economic evaluation? From the welfarist perspective it <b>might</b> be <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> ex ante evaluations should be used, because all sources of utility are relevant. From the extra-welfarist perspective it <b>might</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> ex post evaluations should be used, because economic evaluation should be based solely on realised outcomes, at least {{in the context of a}} publicly financed health service. We sought the views of the Australian public on this issue. Using social willingness to pay questions, we asked respondents to select between alternative health services which either did, or did not, take pre-outcome sources of utility into account. Respondents were asked whether or not tax payers should pay a higher price for services that increased pre-outcome utility, and for which patients would be prepared to pa...|$|R

2500|$|The phrase [...] "the {{absence of}} {{evidence}} is not the evidence of absence" [...] {{can be used as}} a shorthand rebuttal to the second form of the ignorance fallacy (i.e. P has never been absolutely proved and is therefore certainly false).
