40|$|By {{applying}} three methods, namely, the precipitin {{reaction in}} acid medium with the antigen-antibody reaction, the measuring method of heat-noncoagulant protein in determining the serum mucoid content, and the <b>methylene-blue</b> reduction test using the oxdization phenomenon of sulfide ions, on the cancers occurring {{in the field of}} oto-rhino-laryngology as the follow-up study, the efficacy of these three methods has been evaluated. The following are {{the results of the present}} investigation: In the case of cancer patient before treatment the reliability of the precipitin reaction {{in acid medium}} and the measuring method of heat-noncoagulant protein shows the average rate of 80 per cent in general; and these prove to be useful as auxiliary methods for diagnosis. However, the rate of the reliability of the <b>methylene-blue</b> reduction test is poor and therefore its usefulness in diagnosis is low. It is worthy of attention that all these tests gave relatively high rate of positive reaction even in the subjects with diseases such as pharyngeal tuberculosis, peritonsillar abeess and tumors other than cancer. In applying these tests after the treatment, no significant difference can be recognized in the positive rate of <b>methylene-blue</b> reduction test as compared with that before threatment, but in the other two tests the positive rate has been markedly lowered, namely, cancer reaction tended to be negative. With respect to the course after the treatment likewise the <b>methylene-blue</b> reduction test does not coincide with the course of the progress, and only in the case of pharyngeal cancer the recurrence of the cancer can be observed when pseudo-positive or positive continues. The other two methods usually coincide with the course; and in the majority of recurrence cases either positive reaction precedes the recurrence or it turns positive simultaneously with recurrence. Even in the cases with satisfactory improvement, these two methods generally coincide with the progress of the disease after treatment, but there have been a few cases which were positive yet without recurrence...|$|E

40|$|Objective: Evaluation of the {{efficiency}} of our technique of <b>methylene-blue</b> labelling of pulmonary nodules to facilitate thoracoscopic recognition and excision. Design: Patients with a peripheral pulmonary nodule smaller than 2. 5 cm and not {{in contact with the}} visceral pleura were included. Under tomodensitometric guidance, the nodules were labelled with <b>methylene-blue</b> within hours before thoracoscopic wedge resection. If frozen section revealed a primary bronchial carcinoma, thoracotomy and classical resection were performed during the same anesthesia. Results: Between July 1992 and August 1996, 54 nodules were removed in 51 patients. Labelling was performed between 75 and 270 min before surgery and was complicated in 13 patients (25. 4 %) by a small pneumothorax without any clinical consequence. Labelling allowed successful thoracoscopic recognition of 50 nodules (92 %) and thoracoscopic wedge resection was possible in all but one cases (91 %). Five patients (9 %) required thoracotomy. Histology showed a benign lesion in 22 cases, a primary lung carcinoma in 17 and a metastases in 15. Twenty of the 22 benign nodules (91 %) were removed without thoracotomy. According to the protocol, 13 patients with a primary lung tumour underwent lobectomy during the same session. There was no mortality nor morbidity amongst patients who had thoracoscopy only. Conclusions: Our technique of labelling peripheral pulmonary nodules with <b>methylene-blue</b> is very effective and is not associated with any relevant complication.

The final version is available from Nature Publishing Group via [URL] emitters placed in an optical cavity experience an environment that changes how they are coupled to the surrounding light field. In the weak-coupling regime, the extraction {{of light from the}} emitter is enhanced. But more profound effects emerge when single-emitter strong coupling occurs: mixed states are produced that are part light, part matter forming building blocks for quantum information systems and for ultralow-power switches and lasers. Such cavity quantum electrodynamics has until now been the preserve of low temperatures and complicated fabrication methods, compromising its use. Here, by scaling the cavity volume to less than 40 cubic nanometres and using host–guest chemistry to align one to ten protectively isolated <b>methylene-blue</b> molecules, we reach the strong-coupling regime at room temperature and in ambient conditions. Dispersion curves from more than 50 such plasmonic nanocavities display characteristic light–matter mixing, with Rabi frequencies of 300 millielectronvolts for ten <b>methylene-blue</b> molecules, decreasing to 90 millielectronvolts for single molecules—matching quantitative models. Statistical analysis of vibrational spectroscopy time series and dark-field scattering spectra provides evidence of single-molecule strong coupling.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Traditionally, {{intraperitoneal}} bladder perforations {{caused by}} trauma or iatrogenic interventions {{have been treated}} by open or laparoscopic surgery. Additionally, transvesical access to the peritoneal cavity {{has been reported to}} be feasible and useful for natural orifice translumenal endoscopic surgery (NOTES) but would be enhanced by a reliable method of closing the vesicotomy. OBJECTIVE: To assess the feasibility and safety of an endoscopic closure method for vesical perforations using a flexible, small-diameter endoscopic suturing kit in a survival porcine model. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This pilot study was performed at the University of Minho, Braga, Portugal, using six anesthetized female pigs. INTERVENTIONS: Closure of a full-thickness longitudinal incision in the bladder dome (up to 10 mm in four animals and up to 20 mm in two animals) with the endoscopic suturing kit using one to three absorbable stitches. MEASUREMENTS: The acute quality of sealing was immediately tested by distending the bladder with <b>methylene-blue</b> dye under laparoscopic control (in two animals). Without a bladder catheter, the animals were monitored daily for 2 wk, and a necropsy examination was performed to check for the signs of peritonitis, wound dehiscence, and quality of healing. RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: Endoscopic closure of bladder perforation was carried out easily and quickly in all animals. The laparoscopic view revealed no acute leak of <b>methylene-blue</b> dye after distension of the bladder. After recovery from anaesthesia, the pigs began to void normally, and no adverse event occurred. Postmortem examination revealed complete healing of vesical incision with no signs of infection or adhesions in the peritoneal cavity. No limitations have yet been studied clinically. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates the feasibility and the safety of endoscopic closure of vesical perforations with an endoscopic suturing kit in a survival porcine model. This study provides support for further studies using endoscopic closure of the bladder which may lead to a new era in management of bladder rupture and adoption of the transvesical port in NOTES procedures...|$|E

40|$|The {{oxidation}} {{of solutions}} of glucose with <b>methylene-blue</b> {{as a catalyst}} in basic media can induce hydrodynamic overturning instabilities, termed chemoconvection in recognition of their similarity to convective instabilities. The phenomenon is due to gluconic acid, the marginally dense product of the reaction, which gradually builds an unstable density profile. Experiments indicate that dominant pattern wavenumbers initially increase before gradually decreasing or can even oscillate for long times. Here, we perform a weakly nonlinear analysis for an established model of the system with simple kinetics, and show that the resulting amplitude equation is analogous to that obtained in convection with insulating walls. We show that the amplitude description predicts that dominant pattern wavenumbers should decrease in the long term, but does not reproduce the aforementioned increasing wavenumber behavior {{in the initial stages}} of pattern development.

The photocatalytic behavior was determined on glass samples in UV, using <b>methylene-blue</b> as a pollutant. It was observed that, depending on the deposition process parameters, the samples {{can be divided into}} 4 zones, each with a characteristic structure and subsequent behavior. The samples from zone I {{can be attributed to the}} β-Ta phase, metallic, conductive. The samples from zone II can be attributed to a fcc Ta(O, N) structure, with N/Ta higher than O/Ta, with increasing electrical resistivity. The samples from zone III are oxide-like, amorphous, electrically insulating.

40|$|Obturation {{technique}} {{may have}} an effect on the apical seal following post space preparation. This study aimed to evaluate the apical seal of single cone and cold lateral condensation obturation techniques after post space preparation at two different timing. A total of 120 decoronated, single-rooted human premolars were divided into two groups (n= 50) based on canal preparation and obturation techniques; group A - hand ProTaper/ single cone and group B - modified double-flared/ cold lateral condensation. Each group was then subdivided into two subgroups (n= 25) (subgroup I- post space preparation immediately after obturation; subgroup II- post space preparation 7 days later). The remaining 20 teeth served as positive and negative controls. The external root surface was coated with nail varnish, submerged in 2 % <b>methylene-blue</b> dye and incubated at 37 °C for 72 h. Each tooth was later sectioned apico-coronally at 1 mm interval and evaluated using dissecting microscope. The results revealed that obturation techniques do not affect the apical seal (p> 0. 05). Immediate post preparation groups achieved significantly better seal for both obturation techniques when compared with the delayed groups at the level 3 mm and above from the apex (p< 0. 05). Immediate post space preparation provides better apical seal regardless of obturation techniques used...|$|E
40|$|Chromogenic {{strains of}} the genus Escherichia, {{obtained}} from human feces and from water, have been described briefly in a preliminary report (1937). Except {{for the production of}} a "reddish-orange " pigment, these strains cannot be distinguished from certain well-established non-chromogenic species of Esch-erichia. On the basis of minor differences, they fall into three types. They form gas, produce indol, yield negative Voges-Proskauer reactions, and fail to liquefy gelatin. Thus, they are distinctly different from most of the "yellow " pigment-forming "colon " or "colon-like " organisms which have been isolated from cereals, water, etc. by other workers, and which have been mentioned by Parr (1937), and by Lehmann, Neumann and Breed (1931). On the other hand, the present strains may be identical with some of those encountered previously. This point cannot be settled, because the descriptions which have been recorded in the literature are incomplete, except for those of Parr (1937). Two of the present strains seem to be identical with the culture described by him. The present paper records in detail the characteristics of five strains of chromogenic coliform bacilli and compares them with well-recognized species of Escherichia. MATERIALS AND METHODS Three of the bacterial strains were isolated in 1932 from eosin <b>methylene-blue</b> agar during the course of routine bacteriologica...|$|E
40|$|AIM: Aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} two different luting cements and how their clinical procedures influence the postcementation quality. METHODS: Thirty-six freshly extracted mono-radicular teeth (N. = 18) were treated endodontically and randomly divided into two groups. Posts were cemented respectively with two different self adhesive luting cements: Group A - RelyX Unicem (3 M Espe) and Group B - Multilink Sprint (Ivoclar-Vivadent) following the manufacturers' instructions. Teeth were then thermocycled according to protocol ISO/TR 11405 and were immersed 24 hours in 2 % <b>methylene-blue</b> solution. Each tooth was sectioned by a diamond-coated saw (Isomet-Buhler) from CEJ to apex. Each slice was examined for the presence or absence of gutta-percha remnants, voids, bubbles, dye infiltration degree and polymerization grade of the luting agent. Findings were evidenced by stereoscopic microscopy (30 x) and Micro-Raman spectroscopy. Mann-Whitney and ANOVA statistical analyses were performed for all results. RESULTS: No statistical significances were evidenced for gutta-percha presence, dye infiltration and polymerization degree. Voids were present mostly in Group B and bubbles in Group A. Both differences were statistically significant. CONCLUSION: Materials and protocols for glass fiber posts cementation are fundamental for the clinical success. Self adhesive luting cements, if used correctly, could be an acceptable and quick luting agent for postcementation...|$|E
