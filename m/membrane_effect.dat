5000|$|IPT {{works by}} {{increasing}} the cytotoxicity of chemotherapeutic agents. [...] It has been proposed that insulin potentiates chemotherapeutic drugs in two ways: {{by increasing the}} permeability of tumor cancer cell membranes {{so that they may}} absorb a greater quantity of cytotoxic drugs, and by modifying the metabolic function of cancer cells so as to render them more sensitive to the cytotoxic effects of the drugs. One hypothesis for the mechanism of insulin's <b>membrane</b> <b>effect</b> is that the hormone activates delta- 9 desaturase enzyme activity in cancer cells, altering cellular lipid synthesis so that saturated stearic acid is transformed to the unsaturated compound oleic acid, which increases cell membrane fluidity, and thus, permeability, at physiological temperatures of 20 degrees Celsius. Other hypotheses for insulin's <b>membrane</b> <b>effect</b> propose that drugs are absorbed onto glucose molecules, with transmembrane transport then occurring via the insulin-activated glucose transport protein, or suggest a similar adsorption of drug molecules onto insulin with the resulting chimeric drug-insulin complex being internalized into the cell by a process of receptor-mediated endocytosis.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Side-chain oxysterols, such as 25 -hydroxycho-lesterol (25 -HC), are key {{regulators}} {{of cholesterol}} homeo-stasis. New {{evidence suggests that}} the alteration of membrane structure by 25 -HC contributes to its regulatory effects. We have examined the role of oxysterol <b>membrane</b> <b>effects</b> on cholesterol accessibility within the membrane using perfringo-lysin O (PFO), a cholesterol-dependent cytolysin that selectively binds accessible cholesterol, as a sensor of membrane cholesterol accessibility. We show that 25 -HC increases cholesterol accessibility in a manner dependent on the membrane lipid composition. Structural analysis of molecular dynamics simulations reveals that increased cholesterol accessibility is associated with membrane thinning, and that the effects of 25 -HC on cholesterol accessibility are driven by these changes in membrane thickness. Further, we find that the 25 -HC antagonist LY 295427 (agisterol) abrogates the <b>membrane</b> <b>effects</b> of 25 -HC in a nonenantioselective manner...|$|R
40|$|AbstractMany {{cellular}} {{processes are}} sensitive to levels of cholesterol in specific membranes and show a strongly sigmoidal dependence on membrane composition. The sigmoidal responses of the cholesterol sensors involved in these processes could arise from several mechanisms, including positive cooperativity (protein effects) and limited cholesterol accessibility (<b>membrane</b> <b>effects).</b> Here, we describe a sigmoidal response that arises primarily from <b>membrane</b> <b>effects</b> due to sharp changes in the chemical activity of cholesterol. Our models for eukaryotic membrane-bound cholesterol sensors are soluble bacterial toxins that show an identical switch-like specificity for endoplasmic reticulum membrane cholesterol. We show that truncated versions of these toxins fail to form oligomers but still show sigmoidal binding to cholesterol-containing membranes. The nonlinear response emerges because interactions between bilayer lipids control cholesterol accessibility to toxins in a threshold-like fashion. Around these thresholds, the affinity of toxins for membrane cholesterol varies by > 100 -fold, generating highly cooperative lipid-dependent responses independently of protein-protein interactions. Such lipid-driven cooperativity may control the sensitivity of many cholesterol-dependent processes...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{mechanism}} by which active solute transport causes water transport in isotonic proportions across epithelial membranes has been investigated. The principle of the experiments was to measure the osmolarity of the transported fluid when the osmolarity of the bathing solution was varied over an eightfold range by varying the NaCl concentration or by adding impermeant non-electrolytes. An in vitro preparation of rabbit gall bladder was suspended in moist oxygen without an outer bathing solution, and the pure transported fluid was collected as it dripped off the serosal surface. Under all conditions the transported fluid was found to approximate an NaCl solution isotonic to whatever bathing solution used. This finding means that the mechanism of isotonic water transport in the gall bladder is neither the double <b>membrane</b> <b>effect</b> nor codiffusion but rather local osmosis. In other words, active NaCl transport maintains a locally high concentration of solute in some restricted space {{in the vicinity of}} the cell membrane, and water follows NaCl in response to this local osmotic gradient.

On the other hand, UVB {{directly}} activates death receptors on the cell surface including CD 95, implying that UVB-induced apoptosis can be initiated at the cell membrane through death receptor clustering. This study was performed to measure the relative contribution of nuclear and <b>membrane</b> <b>effects</b> in UVB-induced apoptosis of the human epithelial cell line HeLa. UVB-mediated DNA damage can be reduced by treating cells with liposomes containing the repair enzyme photolyase followed by exposure to photoreactivating light. Addition of photolyase followed by photoreactivation after UVB reduced the apoptosis rate significantly, whereas empty liposomes had no effect. Likewise, photoreactivating treatment did not affect apoptosis induced by the ligand of CD 95, CD 95 L. UVB exposure at 4 °C, which prevents CD 95 clustering, also reduced the apoptosis rate, but to a lesser extent. When cells were exposed to UVB at 4 °C and treated with photolyase plus photoreactivating light, UVB-induced apoptosis was almost completely prevented. Inhibition of caspase- 3, a downstream protease in the CD 95 signaling pathway, blocked both CD 95 L and UVB-induced apoptosis, whereas blockage of caspase- 8, the most proximal caspase, inhibited CD 95 L-mediated apoptosis completely, but UVB-induced apoptosis only partially. Although according to these data nuclear effects seem to be slightly more effective in mediating UVB-induced apoptosis than membrane events, both are necessary for the complete apoptotic response. Thus, this study shows that nuclear and <b>membrane</b> <b>effects</b> {{are not mutually exclusive}} and that both components contribute independently to a complete response to UVB...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} the novel {{antiepileptic}} drug topiramate (TPM) were investigated in rat olfactory cortex neurones in vitro using a current/voltage clamp technique. In 80 % of recorded cells, bath application of TPM (20 μM) reversibly hyperpolarized and inhibited neuronal repetitive firing by inducing a slow outward membrane current, accompanied by a conductance increase. The response was reproducible after washout, and was most likely carried largely by K+ ions, although other ionic conductances may also have contributed. In 90 % of cells, TPM (20 μM) also enhanced and prolonged the slow (Ca 2 +-dependent) poststimulus afterhyperpolarization (sAHP) and underlying slow outward tail current (sIAHP). This effect was due to a selective enhancement/prolongation of an underlying L-type Ca 2 + current that was blocked by nifedipine (20 μM); the TPM response was unlikely to involve an interaction at PKA-dependent phosphorylation sites. The carbonic anhydrase (CA) inhibitor acetazolamide (ACTZ, 20 μM) and the poorly membrane permeant inhibitor benzolamide (BZ, 50 μM) both mimicked the <b>membrane</b> <b>effects</b> of TPM, in generating a slow hyperpolarization (slow outward current under voltage clamp) and sAHP enhancement. ACTZ and BZ occluded the effects of TPM in generating the outward current response, but were additive in producing the sAHP modulatory effect, suggesting different underlying response mechanisms. In bicarbonate/CO 2 -free, HEPES-buffered medium, all the <b>membrane</b> <b>effects</b> of TPM and ACTZ were reproducible, therefore not dependent on CA inhibition.
