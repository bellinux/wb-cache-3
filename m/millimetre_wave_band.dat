30|$|The {{aggregation}} of sub- 6 GHz {{bands and}} millimetre wave bands (E- and V-bands) for the backhaul networks is an appealing solution. In this line, the authors in [29] propose a new distributed resource allocation scheme for backhaul management, which exploits {{the benefits of}} both sub- 6 GHz and <b>millimetre</b> <b>wave</b> <b>band</b> using carrier aggregation. In this approach, small cells are classified according to whether {{they have access to}} fibre backhaul, and then, the wireless backhaul resources are shared among those with no fibre infrastructure for backhaul. Taking into account cost constraints, a technique that transits from the sub- 6 GHz band to <b>millimetre</b> <b>wave</b> <b>band</b> as the backhaul resource demands increase is proposed. Taking into account the very small wavelength at the <b>millimetre</b> <b>wave</b> <b>band,</b> the large scale antenna array systems (LSAS) technology, which will be discussed in Section 6.1, can also be incorporated to boost the performance of backhaul solutions.|$|E

So, an extensive research has started in wireless services such as Local Multipoint Distribution Services (LMDS), Broadband Fixed Wireless Access (BFWA), Backhauls and Next Generation Internet (NGI). Actually the current problem that we’re having with the present architecture is limited bandwidth and as the bandwidth demand is increasing as well for different broadband applications, so for increasing bandwidth requirement, <b>millimetre</b> <b>wave</b> <b>band</b> will be well suited as in <b>millimetre</b> <b>wave</b> <b>band,</b> we have large available bandwidth which can be easily utilized in different broadband application. In addition to this, we also have an advantage of using mm-wave band that the transmitting and receiving antenna sizes are reduced as well as related electronic components.

Out of the mm-wave bands, 40 GHz wireless channel represents an attractive band to be researched and utilized to achieve those requirements of large bandwidth.

To derive those, the method of Inverse Synthetic Aperture Radar (ISAR) is employed. The target under test is positioned on a turntable while the radar is illuminating the target from a tower.

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} work on {{the theoretical}} modelling and experimental measurement of the complex permittivity of dielectrics. The main focus of research has been into the characterisation of permittivity of planar and layered samples within the <b>millimetre</b> <b>wave</b> <b>band.</b> The measurement method {{is based on the}} free-space measurement of the transmission and reflection coefficients of samples. A novel analytical method of determining the transmission and reflection coefficients as functions of frequency arising from a generalised structure of planar dielectric layers is also described and validated. The analytical method is based on signal flow techniques. The measurement and analytical techniques have been applied in two main areas: firstly, the acquisition of new data on human skin in the band 57 to 100 GHz and secondly, the detection and location of defects in composite materials for which a band of 90 to 100 GHz was used. Measurements have been made on the complex permittivity of a single sample of excised human skin fixed in formaldehyde. The experimental results have been corrected to account for the fixing process in formaldehyde and are projected to body temperature. This data is, to the best of the author’s knowledge, {{the first of its kind}} to be published. Predicted skin permittivity based on various relaxation models varies widely and only partially fits the measured data. The experimental results have been used to determine the parameters of a Cole-Cole function which gives the best fit to the measured data. The measured skin data has also been used to calculate power deposition in skin exposed to millimetre wave radiation. This work concludes that a skin surface temperature rise of only 0. 20 C results from a thirty second exposure to signals of 100 W/m 2. Experimental work with fibreglass composite samples has shown that defects such as delaminations, voids, matrix cracks and improper cure result in resolvable differences in the dielectric properties of the samples at 90 – 100 GHz. The measurement technique is particularly sensitive to the detection of cracks and its spatial resolution is 20 mm or better. Whilst confirming the general conclusions of previously published work, the specific findings of this study are novel. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the work of}} this thesis is to design, fabricate, and characterise high performance micromachined antennas with fixed and reconfigurable bandwidth. The developed integrated antennas are suitable for MMICs integration at millimetre wave frequencies (G-band) on MMICs technology substrates (i. e GaAs, Si, InP). This work is done through a review of the scientific literature on the subject, and the design, simulation, fabrication and experimental verification, of various suitable designs of antenna. The novel design of the antennas in this work is based on elevated antenna structures in which the radiator is physically micromachined above the substrate. The antenna design schemes offer a suitable method to integrate an antenna with other MMICs. Further, this method eliminates undesired substrate effects, which degrades the antenna performance drastically. Also in this work we have for the first time realized different micromachined antenna topologies with different novel feeding mechanisms - offering more degrees of freedom for antenna design and enhancing the antenna performance. Experimental and simulation results are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed antenna designs and topologies in this work. A new approach for fabricating printed antennas is introduced in this work to fulfil the fabrication process requirements. It provides a new method for the fabrication of 3 -D multilevel structures with variable heights, without etching the substrate. Further, the height of the elevated structures can be specified in the process and can vary by several microns, regardless of the substrate used. This can be used to further enhance the bandwidth and gain of the antenna - avoiding substrate thinning and via holes, and increasing the fabrication yield. Thus, the elevated antenna can meet different application requirements and can be utilized as a substrate independent solution. In this work we have introduced the concept of reconfigurable antennas at <b>millimetre</b> <b>wave</b> <b>band.</b> Also, we have investigated various aspects associated with lowering the pull-down voltage and overcoming the stiction problem of MEMS switches required for the proposed reconfigurable antennas. This was achieved by developing MEMS technology which can be integrated with MMICs fabrication process. Two novel reconfigurable elevated patch antenna topologies were designed to demonstrate the developed technology and their performances were discussed. The result we obtained from this work demonstrates the feasibility of MEMS reconfigurable printed antennas at G-band frequencies. This will open a new field in MMICs technology and increasing system integration capabilities and functionality. The devolved technology in this thesis could be utilized in many unique applications including short range high data rate communication systems and high-resolution passive and active millimetre-wave imaging.

40|$|Full-duplex (FD) {{transmission}} is a promising technique for fifth generation (5 G) wireless communications, enabling significant spectral efficiency (SE) improvement over existing half-duplex (HD) systems. However, FD transmission consumes higher power than HD transmission, especially for <b>millimetre</b> <b>wave</b> <b>band.</b> Therefore, energy efficiency (EE) for FD systems {{is a critical}} yet inadequately addressed issue. This thesis addresses the critical EE challenges and demonstrates promising solutions for implementing FD systems, as detailed in the following contributions. In the first contribution, a comprehensive EE analysis of the FD and HD amplify-and-forward (AF) relay-assisted 60 GHz dual-hop indoor wireless systems is presented. An opportunistic relay mode selection scheme is developed, where FD relay with different self-interference (SIC) techniques or HD relay is opportunistically selected. Together with transmission power adaptation, EE is maximised with given channel gains. A counter-intuitive finding is shown that, with a relatively loose maximum transmission power constraint, FD relay with two-stage SIC is preferable to both FD relay with one-stage SIC and HD relay, resulting in a higher optimised EE. A full range of power consumption sources are considered to rationalise the analysis. The effects of imperfect SIC at relay, drain efficiency and static circuit power on EE are investigated. Simulation results verify the theoretical analysis. In the second contribution, EE oriented resource allocation for FD decode-of-forward (DF) relay-assisted 60 GHz multiuser systems is investigated. In contrast to the existing SE oriented designs, the proposed scheme maximises EE for FD relay systems under cross-layer constraints, addressing the typical problems at 60 GHz. A low-complexity EE-orientated resource allocation algorithm is proposed, by which the transmission power allocation, subcarrier allocation and throughput assignment are performed jointly across multiple users. Simulation results verify the analytical results and confirm that the FD relay systems with the proposed algorithm achieve a higher EE than the FD relay systems with SE oriented approaches, while offering a comparable SE. In addition, a much lower throughput outage probability is guaranteed by the proposed resource allocation algorithm, showing its robustness against channel estimation errors. In the third contribution, it is noticed that in wireless power transfer (WPT) -aided relay systems, the SE of the source-relay link plays a dominant role in the system SE due to limited transmission power at the WPT-aided relay. A novel asymmetric protocol for WPT-aided FD DF relay systems is proposed in multiuser scenario, where the time slot durations of the two hops {{are designed to be}} uneven, to enhance the degree of freedom and hence the system SE. A corresponding dynamic resource allocation algorithm is developed by jointly optimising the time slot durations, subcarriers and transmission power at the source and the relay. Simulation results con rm that, compared to the symmetric WPT-aided FD relay (Sym-WPT-FR) and the time-switching based WPT-aided FD relay (TS-WPT-FR) systems in the literature, the proposed asymmetric WPT-aided FD relay system achieves up to twice the SE and higher robustness against the relay's location and the number of users. In the final contribution, to strike the balance between high SE and low power consumption, a hybrid duplexing strategy is developed for distributed antennas (DAs) systems, where antennas are capable of working in hybrid FD, HD, and sleeping modes. To maximise the system EE with low complexity, activation/deactivation of transmit/receive chain is first performed, by a proposed channel-gain-based DA clustering algorithm, which highlights the characteristics of distributed deployment of antennas. Based on the DAs' con figuration, a novel distributed hybrid duplexing (D-HD) -based and EE oriented algorithm is proposed to further optimise the downlink beamformer and the uplink transmission power. To rationalise the system model, self-interference at DAs, co-channel interference from uplink users to downlink users, and multiuser interference in both uplink and downlink are taken into account. Simulation results confirm that the proposed system provides significant EE and SE enhancements over the colocated FD MIMO system, showing the advantages in alleviating high path loss as well as in cutting the carbon footprint. Compared to the sole-FD DA system, the proposed system shows much higher EE with marginal loss in SE. Also, the SIC operation in the proposed system is much more simplified compared to the two benchmarks...|$|E

At millimetre wavelengths, the kind of technology used for signal transport and processing is typically either waveguide based or quasi-optically based, or some hybrid of the two.

For example, imagery {{is subject to}} effects such as layover distortions due to the height of buildings and also considerable radar shadowing. In this paper the use of synthetic imagery to capture the key elements of radar imagery is examined. The real-world <b>millimetre</b> <b>wave</b> imagery can then {{be related to the}} physical models from which the synthetic imagery is generated leading to improved scene understanding. This paper describes the modelling process adopted and compares real-world imagery from a 35 GHz <b>millimetre</b> <b>wave</b> radar with the synthetically generated imagery using an example urban area...|$|R
40|$|This paper summarises a {{study of}} <b>millimetre</b> <b>wave</b> {{propagation}} models of precipitation in the atmosphere. Measurements of drop size distributions (DSDs), rain rates and <b>millimetre</b> <b>wave</b> attenuation have formed the key input to the analyses. In addition 20 - 30 years of rainfall from 3 sites in Norway have been investigated. The work includes physical and empirical modelling, and development of a method for administering DSDs, including averaging and statistical analysis of DSDs. Wind has a clear effect on the stability of rain rate measurements, and a method for correcting {{for some of the}} influence of wind is proposed...|$|R
50|$|Extremely high {{frequency}} (EHF) is the International Telecommunications Union (ITU) designation {{for the band}} of radio frequencies in the electromagnetic spectrum from 30 to 300 gigahertz (GHz). It lies between the super {{high frequency}} band, and the far infrared band which is {{also referred to as}} the terahertz gap. Radio <b>waves</b> in this <b>band</b> have wavelengths from ten to one millimetre, giving it the name <b>millimetre</b> <b>band</b> or <b>millimetre</b> <b>wave,</b> sometimes abbreviated MMW or mmW. Millimetre-length electromagnetic waves were first investigated in the 1890s by Bengali-Indian scientist Jagadish Chandra Bose.|$|R
40|$|A {{frequency}} modulated {{continuous wave}} (FMCW) radar sensor whose {{heart is a}} Monolithic <b>Millimetre</b> <b>wave</b> Integrated Circuit (MMIC) working at approx. 94 GHz {{has been used for}} both process control and imaging for different purposes. The radar sensor has been tested in the area of gas-assisted injection moulding processes for production of plastics parts and components. By means of waveguides and a window which is transparent for <b>millimetre</b> <b>waves</b> the waves are guided into the cavity to be filled with liquid plastics. The appearance of a gas bubble changes the wave pattern inside the cavity. Thus, the process sequence can be controlled in a quick and direct way...|$|R
40|$|A soft board-board <b>millimetre</b> <b>wave</b> subarrayed Van Atta antenna {{has been}} {{designed}} fabricated and measured for asset tracking applications at 62 GHz. Soft-board, 254 µm thickness and 2. 19 relative permittivity, single and array patch antennas were designed and characterised. The elements and arrays {{are designed to be}} connected via microstrip to WR- 15 waveguide transitions. Measurements of insertion loss for the transition have been performed and the transition used to allow patch array and subarray absolute gain values to be computed. The performance of the Van Atta Array is also given and peculiarities of its performance at mm-wave frequencies described. The characteristics of a <b>millimetre</b> <b>wave</b> integrated Silicon antenna are discussed also. The frequencies chosen for thi...|$|R
