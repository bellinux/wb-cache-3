These deodorants are claimed to have antibacterial activities. This work was therefore, carried out to determine the antibacterial activities of the deodorants marketed in Owerri municipality. Owerri is the capital of Imo State of Nigeria. To determine this, twenty (20) deodorants from ten (10) different manufacturers made up of fourteen (14) roll-on and six (6) sprays were assessed using punch-hole plate diffusion technique on nutrient agar plates. The deodorants were purchased from Ekeonunwa market, New <b>market,</b> <b>Relief</b> market, and some supper markets, all in Owerri Municipality. These deodorants were tested against Laboratory isolates of Staphylococcus epidermidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli and Proteus mirabilis obtained from Federal Medical Centre (FMC) and Modesty Medical Laboratory Owerri and reconfirmed using morphological and biochemical tests. Out of the twenty (20) deodorants tested, 18 (90 %) were active against the organisms, 17 (85 %) were active against Staphylococcus epidermidis, 15 (75 %) against P. mirabilis, 11 (55 %) against E. coli and 10 (50 %) against P. aeruginosa.

While jobless families now enjoy some stability at the level of basic survival, they experience their condition in isolation, and need to supplement their benefits by precarious employment.

In New York, the eu {{countries}} {{presented their}} timetable for increasing oda 1 to 0. 7 per-cent of gni by 2015 and made concrete pledges to increase it to 0. 56 per-cent by 2010. Other industrialized countries also undertook {{to increase their}} oda. Implementation of these pledges would increase global oda by usd 50 billion to some usd 130 billion by 2010. This gives us the chance to lend massive support to the development efforts of our partner countries in the South. Yet it would be naïve to think that increased financial transfers through more oda will automatically lead to more development. It is an acknowl-edged fact that development occurs when domestic conditions provide a conducive environment. This can, and should, however, be flanked by a positive environment for development at international level. The set of eight goals contained in the Millennium Declaration (mdgs) which was agreed at the 2000 Millennium Summit is therefore right to emphasize open <b>markets,</b> debt <b>relief</b> and more oda. Because development can only be successful when endogenous and exogenous factors positively re-inforce each other, attention was also drawn during {{the run-up to the}} G 8 summit in Gleneagles and the Major Event to the risks of massively in-creased oda.

40|$|Hop, an {{essential}} ingredient in beer, contains different prenylflavonoids, among which 8 -prenylnaringenin (8 -PN) {{would be the}} most potent phytoestrogen currently known. Therefore, hop extracts are now <b>marketed</b> to <b>relief</b> menopausal complaints but efficiency varies greatly among individuals. As variability in biological activity was also noted for other phytoestrogens and related with variable intestinal bacterial metabolism, the goal of this work was to investigate whether intestinal bacteria also determine the final activity of hop phytoestrogens by combining batch incubations with SHIME, rat and human studies. Batch incubations learned that 8 -PN is stable towards microbial degradation but that isoxanthohumol (IX), another hop prenylflavonoid, can be activated into 8 -PN by bacterial O-demethylation. Although IX shows no estrogenic activity, it is present in hop products in 10 - to 30 -fold higher concentrations than 8 -PN, showing that intestinal IX activation may significantly increase 8 -PN exposure. SHIME experiments showed up to 80 % IX conversion, mainly in the distal colon. Experiments with 51 fecal samples indicated significant interindividual variations, with high, moderate and low 8 -PN producers. An experiment with germ-free and human microbiota associated rats and a human intervention trial confirmed the importance of variable intestinal IX activation and provided a definitive explanation for the variable biological activity of hop products. As the final activity of all phytoestrogens depends on variable intestinal metabolism, 100 fecal samples were incubated with precursors from all classes. This learned that the activation of different phytoestrogen classes occurs through separate pathways, with within-class correlations between different metabolites. Moreover, the production of specific metabolites was related to certain intestinal conditions. As variable IX activation implies variable 8 -PN exposure, technological applications were investigated to balance the 8 -PN exposure between individuals. To do this, an efficiently 8 -PN producing Eubacterium limosum strain was selected. Its application as probiotic to increase intestinal 8 -PN production was shown in vitro and in the rat model. In conclusion, it was demonstrated {{for the first time that}} the exposure to the potent phytoestrogen 8 -PN mainly depends on the product IX concentrations and the variable intestinal metabolic potential to activate IX. Moreover, strategies were developed to balance the 8 -PN exposure in all individuals...|$|R
