5|$|Khrushchev founded several {{academic}} towns, such as Akademgorodok. The premier {{believed that}} Western science flourished because <b>many</b> <b>scientists</b> lived in university {{towns such as}} Oxford, isolated from big city distractions, and had pleasant living conditions and good pay. He sought to duplicate those conditions in the Soviet Union. Khrushchev's attempt was generally successful, though his new towns and scientific centers tended to attract younger scientists, with older ones unwilling to leave Moscow or Leningrad.|$|E
5|$|The Operations Research Section (ORS) {{was also}} set up {{in light of the}} success of such {{programs}} in Fighter and Bomber Commands. <b>Many</b> <b>scientists</b> were appointed to the ORS Coastal Command. Some acted as advisors to Air Marshal Bowhill. Four sections were set up; planned flying and maintenance, ASO, A/S, and weather and navigation. Resources were spread evenly. However, A/S received more attention. The rest did not receive close attention until 1943, when the U-boats had been contained and a certain degree of ascendancy achieved.|$|E
5|$|To further {{improve the}} {{function}} of heterodimeric antibodies, <b>many</b> <b>scientists</b> are looking towards artificial constructs. Artificial antibodies are largely diverse protein motifs that use the functional strategy of the antibody molecule, but aren’t limited by the loop and framework structural constraints of the natural antibody. Being {{able to control the}} combinational design of the sequence and three-dimensional space could transcend the natural design and allow for the attachment of different combinations of drugs to the arms.|$|E

5|$|Traditionally, {{living things}} have been divided into five kingdoms: Monera; Protista; Fungi; Plantae; Animalia. However, <b>many</b> <b>scientists</b> now {{consider}} this five-kingdom system outdated. Modern alternative classification systems generally begin with the three-domain system: Archaea (originally Archaebacteria); Bacteria (originally Eubacteria) and Eukaryota (including protists, fungi, plants, and animals) These domains reflect whether the cells have nuclei or not, as well as differences in the chemical composition of key biomolecules such as ribosomes.|$|E
5|$|Aves and {{a sister}} group, the clade Crocodilia, contain the only living representatives of the reptile clade Archosauria. During the late 1990s, Aves was most {{commonly}} defined phylogenetically as all descendants {{of the most recent}} common ancestor of modern birds and Archaeopteryx lithographica. However, an earlier definition proposed by Jacques Gauthier gained wide currency in the 21st century, and is used by <b>many</b> <b>scientists</b> including adherents of the Phylocode system. Gauthier defined Aves to include only the crown group of the set of modern birds. This was done by excluding most groups known only from fossils, and assigning them, instead, to the Avialae, in part to avoid the uncertainties about the placement of Archaeopteryx in relation to animals traditionally thought of as theropod dinosaurs.|$|E
5|$|Heilmann's {{articles}} were later collected and published {{as a book}} in Danish in 1916 with the title as in his series, Vor Nuvaerende Viden om Fuglenes Afstamming ("our present knowledge {{about the origin of}} birds"). This met the same lack of interest and is thought to have been a result of publishing in Danish, as this made it inaccessible to <b>many</b> <b>scientists</b> working in the U.S. and much of Europe. The field of paleontology at the time was dominated by American and English scientists, and the discipline in continental Europe was dominated by Germany and to a lesser degree France.|$|E

5|$|In late 2013, a {{plan was}} {{proposed}} for salvage logging approximately 30,000 acres (120km2) of the Rim Fire. The snag forest habitat of forest-killed trees {{is home to}} a wide variety of wildlife, some of which are management indicator species. <b>Many</b> <b>scientists</b> and conservation groups opposed the logging plan, contending that the removal of trees from this area would harm species such as black-backed woodpeckers and affect other cavity-nesting birds that follow in the wake of the woodpeckers. Other species of wildlife were also considered be at risk from salvage logging, such as frogs that inhabit forested streams and deer. Native plants and basic ecological succession of the forest are also reportedly harmed by salvage logging. However, some environmental groups endorsed the salvage logging plan.|$|E
5|$|Like <b>many</b> <b>scientists</b> {{working on}} the project, Woods {{affected}} a casual attitude towards the danger posed by radiation. After a morning with Willard Libby soldering a canister containing a mixture of radium salt and beryllium metal, Woods absorbed about 200 roentgens, and her {{white blood cell count}} halved. The doctors gave her a lecture on how a woman has only a fixed number of egg cells, a proposition that Woods was skeptical of. She considered that the important thing was that the solder was done correctly. When the team moved to their new home at Argonne, Woods had a dormitory all to herself.|$|E
5|$|Thatcher {{supported}} Lord Rothschild's 1971 {{proposal for}} market forces to affect government funding of research. Although <b>many</b> <b>scientists</b> opposed the proposal, her research background probably made her sceptical of their claim that outsiders should {{not interfere with}} funding. The department evaluated proposals for more local education authorities to close grammar schools and to adopt comprehensive secondary education. Although Thatcher was committed to a tiered secondary modern-grammar school system of education and attempted to preserve grammar schools, during her tenure as Education Secretary she turned down only 326 of 3,612proposals for schools to become comprehensives; the proportion of pupils attending comprehensive schools consequently rose from 32percent to 62percent.|$|E

50|$|The Ganga Action Plan or GAP was {{a program}} {{launched}} by Rajiv Gandhi in April 1986 {{to reduce the}} pollution load on the river. But the efforts to decrease the pollution level in the river became abortive even after spending ₹ 9017.1 million (~190 million USD adjusting to inflation). Therefore, this plan was withdrawn on 31 March 2000. This plan is described as failure by <b>many</b> <b>scientist</b> and NGOs in their studies.|$|R
5|$|The Manhattan Project {{became public}} {{knowledge}} after the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and Oppenheimer {{became a national}} spokesman for science who was emblematic of {{a new type of}} technocratic power. He became a household name and his face appeared on the covers of Life and Time. Nuclear physics became a powerful force as all governments of the world began to realize the strategic and political power that came with nuclear weapons. Like <b>many</b> <b>scientists</b> of his generation, he felt that security from atomic bombs would come only from a transnational organization such as the newly formed United Nations, which could institute a program to stifle a nuclear arms race.|$|E
5|$|The {{biochemical}} {{identity of}} enzymes was still {{unknown in the}} early 1900s. <b>Many</b> <b>scientists</b> observed that enzymatic activity was associated with proteins, but others (such as Nobel laureate Richard Willstätter) argued that proteins were merely carriers for the true enzymes and that proteins per se were incapable of catalysis. In 1926, James B. Sumner showed that the enzyme urease was a pure protein and crystallized it; he did likewise for the enzyme catalase in 1937. The conclusion that pure proteins can be enzymes was definitively demonstrated by John Howard Northrop and Wendell Meredith Stanley, {{who worked on the}} digestive enzymes pepsin (1930), trypsin and chymotrypsin. These three scientists were awarded the 1946 Nobel Prize in Chemistry.|$|E
5|$|The {{facilities}} and patronage {{provided by the}} Ayyubids led to a resurgence in intellectual activity in different branches of knowledge and learning throughout the territories they controlled. They took special interest {{in the fields of}} medicine, pharmacology, and botany. Saladin built and maintained two hospitals in Cairo emulating the well-known Nuri Hospital in Damascus which not only treated patients, but also provided medical schooling. <b>Many</b> <b>scientists</b> and physicians flourished in this period in Egypt, Syria, and Iraq. Among them were Maimonides, Ibn Jami, Abdul Latif al-Baghdadi, al-Dakhwar, Rashidun al-Suri, and Ibn al-Baitar. Some of these scholars served the Ayyubid household directly, becoming the personal physicians of sultans.|$|E

5|$|The type {{species is}} M. carinatus; seven other {{species have been}} named during the past 150years, but only M. kaalae among these is still {{considered}} valid. Early sauropodomorphs systematics have undergone numerous revisions during the last several years, and <b>many</b> <b>scientists</b> disagree where exactly Massospondylus lies on the dinosaur evolutionary tree. The family name Massospondylidae was once coined for the genus, but because knowledge of early sauropodomorph relationships {{is in a state}} of flux, it is unclear which other dinosaurs—if any—belong in a natural grouping of massospondylids; several 2007 papers support the family's validity.|$|E
5|$|Within the Lithostrotia, Opisthocoelicaudia {{has been}} found to be closely related to the genera Alamosaurus, Neuquensaurus, Rocasaurus and Saltasaurus, {{together}} forming the family Saltasauridae. Interrelationships of these genera are contested. <b>Many</b> <b>scientists</b> considered Opisthocoelicaudia to be most closely related to Alamosaurus, with both genera forming a monophyletic group, the Opisthocoelicaudiinae. Other scientists came to the conclusion that the Opisthocoelicaudiinae is paraphyletic (not forming a natural group). Contradicting most other studies, Upchurch and colleagues in 2004 argued that Alamosaurus has to be placed outside the Saltasauridae as a close relative of Pellegrinisaurus, and therefore is not related to Opisthocoelicaudia at al.|$|E
5|$|A few {{theoretical}} physicists {{have argued}} that classical physics is intrinsically incapable of explaining the holistic aspects of consciousness, but that quantum theory may provide the missing ingredients. Several theorists have therefore proposed quantum mind (QM) theories of consciousness. Notable theories falling into this category include the holonomic brain theory of Karl Pribram and David Bohm, and the Orch-OR theory formulated by Stuart Hameroff and Roger Penrose. Some of these QM theories offer descriptions of phenomenal consciousness, as well as QM interpretations of access consciousness. None of the quantum mechanical theories has been confirmed by experiment. Recent publications by G. Guerreshi, J. Cia, S. Popescu, and H. Briegel could falsify proposals {{such as those of}} Hameroff, which rely on quantum entanglement in protein. At the present time <b>many</b> <b>scientists</b> and philosophers consider the arguments for an important role of quantum phenomena to be unconvincing.|$|E
