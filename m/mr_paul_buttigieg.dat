50|$|Every {{house has}} a house master, these are: Aragon - <b>Mr</b> Jean <b>Paul</b> <b>Buttigieg,</b> Castille - <b>Mr</b> James Cuschieri, Provence - Ms Sharon Abela, and Auvergne - Ms Lara Muscat. An elected older student serves as a House Captain for each House. Siblings {{will be in the}} same House as their older siblings. San Andrea Senior School {{students}} are given the right to have their own children keep the same House as they belonged to. If both parents are old students of San Andrea School, the children will have an option to choose their House. The house system in Senior School aims to motivate students into performing well in both academics as well as sports. Students gain points for their house by participating and winning in House tournaments of basketball, volleyball, handball and football. They also gain points for participating and winning in athletics, gymnastics, walkathon and cross-country. Points will be given as the students improve from one assessment to the other. Each mark will be changed to a grade and then the grades are compared. For every grade improvement a student will gain a point. Therefore, if a student moves from C to A he/she will gain 2 points and 1 point is lost if a student moves from B to C. A child who retains his A will gain 2 points. Points are also awarded for showing outstanding performance in improvement, determination, effort and showing kindness to others. The students who gain the most points for their respective House, are awarded a certificate of achievement. This happens every year and the chosen student's name is inscribed in gold on the School Honours Board.|$|R
