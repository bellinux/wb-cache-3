25|$|In typical operation, the base–emitter {{junction}} is forward biased, {{which means}} that the p-doped side of the junction is at a more positive potential than the n-doped side, and the base–collector junction is reverse biased. In an NPN transistor, when positive bias is applied to the base–emitter junction, the equilibrium is disturbed between the thermally generated carriers and the repelling electric field of the n-doped emitter depletion region. This allows thermally excited electrons to inject from the emitter into the base region. These electrons diffuse through the base from the region of high concentration near the emitter towards the region of low concentration near the collector. The electrons in the base are called minority carriers because the base is doped p-type, which makes holes the <b>majority</b> <b>carrier</b> in the base.|$|E
25|$|Schottky diodes are {{constructed}} from a metal to semiconductor contact. They {{have a lower}} forward voltage drop than p–n junction diodes. Their forward voltage drop at forward currents of about 1mA is in the range 0.15V to 0.45V, which makes them useful in voltage clamping applications and prevention of transistor saturation. They {{can also be used}} as low loss rectifiers, although their reverse leakage current is in general higher than that of other diodes. Schottky diodes are <b>majority</b> <b>carrier</b> devices and so do not suffer from minority carrier storage problems that slow down many other diodes—so they have a faster reverse recovery than p–n junction diodes. They also tend to have much lower junction capacitance than p–n diodes, which provides for high switching speeds and their use in high-speed circuitry and RF devices such as switched-mode power supply, mixers, and detectors.|$|E

It is found that apart from the capture rate of the <b>majority</b> <b>carriers</b> into the probed gap states, additional mixed contributions from the recombination processes of the free <b>majority</b> <b>carriers</b> with trapped minority carriers may be important for the Y signal of lower frequencies. The above additional contributions prevent the extraction of a reliable DOS. They become important {{as far as the}} capture coefficient for the <b>majority</b> <b>carriers</b> of the recombination centers where the minority carriers are trapped is comparable or higher than that of the recombination centers were the <b>majority</b> <b>carriers</b> are trapped. In this case, the recombination rate is relatively high and the mixed contributions from the recombination processes can be detectable in the experimental Y signal and may also induce a phase lead. Taking advantage of this behavior it can be experimentally verified when these recombination processes are negligible in order to safely extract the accurate DOS parameters...|$|R

The valence band offset is very large, there is a diffusion of electrons from n-ZnO to p-Si and diffusion of holes from p-Si to n-ZnO because electrons are minority carriers and holes are <b>majority</b> <b>carriers</b> in p-Si and electron are <b>majority</b> <b>carriers</b> and holes are minority carriers in n-ZnO. At low forward voltage, the current increases exponentially. Therefore, the forward I-V characteristics in Fig. 4 d can be explained.|$|R

The forward potential of these diodes depends on the wavelength of the emitted photons: 2.1V corresponds to red, 4.0V to violet.

50|$|The {{materials}} {{chosen as}} suitable dopants {{depend on the}} atomic properties of both the dopant and the material to be doped. In general, dopants that produce the desired controlled changes are classified as either electron acceptors or donors. Semiconductors doped with donor impurities are called n-type, while those doped with acceptor impurities are known as p-type. The n and p type designations indicate which charge carrier acts as the material's <b>majority</b> <b>carrier.</b> The opposite carrier is called the minority carrier, which exists due to thermal excitation {{at a much lower}} concentration compared to the <b>majority</b> <b>carrier.</b>|$|E
50|$|For the Schottky diodes, <b>majority</b> <b>carrier</b> traps are {{observed}} by {{the application of}} a reverse bias pulse, while minority carrier traps can be observed when the reverse bias voltage pulses are replaced with light pulses with the photon energy from the above semiconductor bandgap spectral range. This method is called Minority Carrier Transient Spectroscopy (MCTS). The minority carrier traps can be also observed for the p-n junctions by application of forward bias pulses, which inject minority carriers into the space charge region.

Because this barrier is located in the oppositely doped material, the injected carriers at the barrier position are now minority carriers. As recombination takes hold, the minority carrier densities drop with depth to their equilibrium values for bulk minority carriers, a factor exp(−&phi;B/Vth) smaller than their bulk densities nB, pB as majority carriers before injection. At this point the quasi-Fermi levels rejoin the bulk Fermi level positions.|$|E

30|$|To {{investigate}} {{the change of}} SZO NW resistance, resistances of various SZO NWs are measured using two-probe method with the Ti/Au electrodes {{on both sides of}} the single SZO NW. Linear I-V curves are obtained, indicating ohmic contacts between SZO NW and Ti/Au electrodes. Figure 3 shows tuned resistances of un-doped, 1, 3, and 5 SZO ZnO NWs to be about 54.1, 4.255, 1.34 and 0.304 MΩ, respectively. Based on theory, the role of Ag dopants is to reduce <b>majority</b> <b>carriers</b> (as electrons) in the ZnO matrix, when Ag ion is substitute in Zn site. Therefore, the minority carriers (as holes) of SZO NW are increased because Ag element is I group. So, the resistance of SZO NW is continuously increased as the concentration of Ag element increased. Finally, the resistance of SZO NW is decreased oppositely when the number of the minority carriers (as hole) is higher than the number of <b>majority</b> <b>carriers</b> (as electron). Therefore, SZO NW FETs have to show p-type behavior.|$|R
