The arc temperature was calculated by the ratio of one pair of Agl lines at the thermal equilibrium in the arc column. The temperature is between 3000 oK and 50000 K under ordinary condition, however, it changes with the number of times of the <b>make</b> <b>and</b> <b>break.</b> The change of the arc temperatures have some penodical character and shows the peak value between 15000 and 25000 times for Ag contact, 20000 times for Ag- 5 #CdO contact, 25000 times for Ag- 15 SCdO contact. Considering Ag and Cd atoms in the arc column, the change of Ag atoms are in good agreement with the change of the arc temperature. Bisides, at Ag-CdO contact, it also is confirmed with the spectroscopic that Cd atoms evaporate earlier than Ag atoms...|$|R

"Make <b>and</b> <b>Break</b> Harbour" [...] {{is about}} the dying of fishing traditions and the {{importance}} of the two-stroke [...] one-piston inboard engines (known as the <b>Make</b> <b>and</b> <b>Break</b> engine or the [...] "one-lunger") that Atlantic Canadian fishing communities used. The one-piston style engine was an important piece of technology featured on inboard motors for small fishing vessels that dot the Atlantic Canadian coastline. These engines served {{an important role in the}} history of the Atlantic fisheries. Throughout the song Rogers talks of the dying traditions associated within those small communities. With lines such as [...] "And the young folk don't stay with the fisherman's way/Long ago they all moved to the cities" [...] and [...] "Now I can see the big draggers that stirred up the bay/Leaving lobster traps smashed on the bottom/And they think it don't pay to respect the old ways/That <b>make</b> <b>and</b> <b>break</b> men have not forgotten", Rogers cites some of the reasons for the loss of tradition.|$|R

Nevertheless, this arrangement remained a cheaper option than electromagnetic generators for some time.|$|R
