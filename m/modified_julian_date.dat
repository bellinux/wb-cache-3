5000|$|A split (schism) {{occurred}} within the Church in 1924 when the Holy Synod decided {{to replace the}} Old Calendar (Julian) with a hybrid calendar—the so-called [...] "Revised Julian Calendar"—which maintained a <b>modified</b> <b>Julian</b> <b>dating</b> method for Easter while adopting the Gregorian Calendar date for fixed feasts. Those who refused to adopt this change are known as Old Calendarists (palaioimerologites in Greek) and still follow the old Julian Calendar. They themselves have suffered several schisms, and not all Old Calendarists comprise one Church. They refer to themselves as [...] "Genuine Orthodox Christians", and the largest group associating itself with the Old Calendarists is the Synod of Archbishop Chrysostomos II Kioussis. This Synod has obtained government recognition as a valid Orthodox Church, although this is not in communion with the Church of Greece or the other Eastern Orthodox Churches.|$|R

40|$|We have {{implemented}} a time-dependent photometric calibration of WFPC 2 and WF/PC- 1 within synphot {{based on the}} stellar photometric monitoring data. This provides an empirical correction for the build-up of uniform contaminants on the CCD faceplates of the WFPC 2 and WF/PC- 1. Although the contaminant issue is less severe for WFPC 2, there is more UV science where the effect is still significant. We present the empirical models of the time-variable throughput decline in WFPC 2 and WF/PC- 1.

In contrast, Ohms did not make any mention of time zones or time of day in his paper; the Lilian date is a pure date format.
