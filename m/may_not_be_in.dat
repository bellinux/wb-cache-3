5|$|Bolton is {{a common}} Northern English name derived from the Old English bothl-tun, meaning a {{settlement}} with a dwelling. The first recorded use of the name, in the form Boelton, dates from 1185 to describe Bolton le Moors, though this <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> relation to a dwelling. It was recorded as Bothelton in 1212, Botelton in 1257, Boulton in 1288, and Bolton after 1307.|$|E
5|$|On 3 August the Culture Secretary Jeremy Hunt {{instructed}} Ofcom and the Office of Fair Trading (OFT) {{to examine}} Global Radio's purchase of GMG, which gave Global over 50% of the UK radio market {{because of concerns}} the takeover <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> the public interest. On 11 October, the OFT agreed to fast-track the investigation. Hunt's successor Maria Miller said the deal would not be investigated for media plurality. The OFT concluded that the merger {{could lead to a}} rise in local advertising costs because of the decrease in competitors, and forwarded the matter to the Competition Commission, which oversees business mergers and takeovers. On the same day the Competition Commission announced it would publish its findings into the takeover by 27 March 2013.|$|E

25|$|Furthermore, some {{competing}} elite political players <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> power; {{they would}} remain unincorporated {{into the central}} system. These competing elites can gain access through federal structures and their resources to solidify their political power in the structure. According to V.P. Gagnon {{this was the case}} in the former Yugoslavia and its violent disintegration into its ethno-federal sub-states. Ethnic entrepreneurs were able to take control of the institutionally allocated resources to wage war on other ethnic groups.|$|E
25|$|Pakistan {{has been}} run by {{military}} dictatorships for large periods of time, alternating with limited democracy. These rapid changes in governments led to rapid policy changes and reversals and {{the reduction of}} transparency and accountability in government. The onset of military regimes have contributed to non-transparency in resource allocation.Those who do not constitute the political elite are unable to make political leaders and the Government responsive to their needs or accountable to promises. Development priorities are determined not by potential beneficiaries but by the bureaucracy and a political elite which may or <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> touch {{with the needs of}} the citizens. Political instability and macroeconomic imbalances have been reflected in poor creditworthiness ratings, even compared to other countries of similar income levels, with resulting capital flight and lower foreign direct investment inflows. The current government of Pakistan has professed commitments to reforms in this area.|$|E
25|$|A {{key project}} {{is one that}} could radically {{change the way the}} medical {{profession}} is paid for services under Medicare and Medicaid. The current system, which is also the prime system used by medical insurers is known as fee-for-service because the medical practitioner is paid only for the performance of medical procedures which, it is argued means that doctors have a financial incentive to do more tests (which generates more income) which <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> the patients' best long-term interest. The current system encourages medical interventions such as surgeries and prescribed medicines (all of which carry some risk for the patient but increase revenues for the medical care industry) and does not reward other activities such as encouraging behavioral changes such as modifying dietary habits and quitting smoking, or follow-ups regarding prescribed regimes which could have better outcomes for the patient at a lower cost. The current fee-for-service system also rewards bad hospitals for bad service. Some have noted that the best hospitals have fewer re-admission rates than others, which benefits patients, but some of the worst hospitals have high re-admission rates which is bad for patients but is perversely rewarded under the fee-for-service system.|$|E

500|$|The {{southern}} half of {{the circle}} has been destroyed, likely by clay workings {{that took place in}} the area during the late eighteenth century.

The west side of the site is cut by pools and ditches formed by old clay workings. [...] The surviving stones form an arc that suggests that the circle originally had a diameter of about 26 metres, or 80 feet. If this was the case then it would have been the second largest stone circle in Dorset, after Kingston Russell Stone Circle.|$|E
500|$|In {{defining}} the constellation, Lacaille gave twelve stars Bayer designations of Alpha through to Lambda, with two close stars called Eta (one now {{known by its}} Henry Draper catalogue number), while Lambda was later dropped due to its dimness. The three brightest stars, Alpha, Beta and Gamma, make up the triangle. Readily identified by its orange hue, Alpha Trianguli Australis is a bright giant star of spectral type K2IIb-IIIa with an apparent magnitude of +1.91 that is the 42nd-brightest star in the night sky. It lies [...] away and has an absolute magnitude of −3.68 and is 5,500 times more luminous than our Sun. With a diameter 130 times that of our Sun, it would almost reach the orbit of Venus if placed at {{the centre of the}} Solar System. The proper name Atria is a contraction of its Bayer designation. Beta Trianguli Australis is a double star, the primary being a [...] F-type main-sequence star with a stellar classification of F1V, and an apparent magnitude of 2.85. Lying only [...] away, it has an absolute magnitude of 2.38. Its companion, almost 3 arcminutes away, is a 13th-magnitude star which may or <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> orbit around Beta. The remaining member of the triangle is Gamma Trianguli Australis with an apparent magnitude of 2.87. It is an A-type main sequence star of spectral class A1V, which lies [...] away.|$|E
