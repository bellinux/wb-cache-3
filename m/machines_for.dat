5|$|Anti-malware {{researchers}} also exploited Heartbleed {{to their own}} advantage in order to access secret forums used by cybercriminals. Studies were also conducted by deliberately setting up vulnerable <b>machines.</b> <b>For</b> example, on April 12, 2014, at least two independent researchers were able to steal private keys from an experimental server intentionally set up for that purpose by CloudFlare. Also, on April 15, 2014, J. Alex Halderman, a professor at University of Michigan, reported that his honeypot server, an intentionally vulnerable server designed to attract attacks in order to study them, had received numerous attacks originating from China. Halderman concluded that {{because it was a}} fairly obscure server, these attacks were probably sweeping attacks affecting large areas of the Internet.|$|E
5|$|In 1994, the Delaware General Assembly {{approved}} slot <b>machines</b> <b>for</b> the state's three racetracks, and {{the first}} racino opened in December 1995. This helped the horse racing industry in Delaware, as approximately 10 percent of all gross revenue is used to increase the purses. This drew competition away from Maryland. Rosecroft could not fill up a 12-race card for its opening night during the 1996 season. An estimated $80 million in wagering was lost in 1996 from the effect of Delaware's casinos. Throughout the years, various politicians tried to bring slot machines or table games to Rosecroft, but all were unsuccessful.|$|E

5|$|They {{are named}} after Franz Reuleaux, a 19th-century German {{engineer}} who pioneered {{the study of}} <b>machines</b> <b>for</b> translating one type of motion into another, and who used Reuleaux triangles in his designs. However, these shapes were known before his time, for instance by the designers of Gothic church windows, by Leonardo da Vinci, who used it for a map projection, and by Leonhard Euler {{in his study of}} constant-width shapes. Other applications of the Reuleaux triangle include giving the shape to guitar picks, pencils, and drill bits for drilling square holes, as well as in graphic design in the shapes of some signs and corporate logos.|$|E
5|$|According to {{historian}} L. T. C. Rolt, {{the original}} installation was of <b>machines</b> <b>for</b> wire-braiding crinoline frames, and Charles simultaneously imported metal cutting machine tools to aid his friend Hiram Maxim who was developing a machine gun. This is a moot point: the Maxim gun was not developed {{for a further}} 20 years, and {{it is unlikely that}} Maxim was in England during the 1860s; however, the Gatling gun was patented in 1862. Rolt claimed that Charles Churchill & Co began trading in 1865 as importers of engineering tools and is thought to have imported the first examples of Morse tapered twist drills, self-centring drill chucks (manufactured by Cushman) and hand-held micrometers into the UK. According to Floud, he imported agricultural implements and other non-engineering items at this time. In its early years the company traded from 28 Wilson Street, Finsbury: sales catalogues were published certainly between 1876 and 1882 stating this address.|$|E

5|$|In the sub-basement {{were the}} Sprague screw <b>machines</b> <b>for</b> the {{electric}} elevators, the fire pumps, the house pumps, the ice plant, {{and the six}} Babcock & Wilcox waler tube boilers. The elevator system, which served the house from subbasement to roof, was electric, taking its power from the generating plant within the building. There were 18 elevators. The machinery was located in the sub-basement. The boilers aggregated about 3,000 horse power, the electric generators taking 2,200 horse-power of the total energy. The elevators were run by it, as were the 15,000 incandescent lamps, branching from 7,500 outlets. The system of heating and ventilating the public rooms was that of forced draught by means of powerful blowers situated in the sub-basement that forced the fresh air between steam-coils, where it became moderately heated before entering the ducts that lead it to the various rooms. This heat was further augmented by direct radiators placed behind screens in the recesses of the windows and elsewhere.|$|E
5|$|Sinclair's {{licensing}} agreement with Timex enabled the American company to produce three clones or offshoots of Sinclair <b>machines</b> <b>for</b> the US market. These were the Timex Sinclair 1000, Timex Sinclair 1500 (both variants of the ZX81) and the Timex Sinclair 2068 (a {{variant of the}} ZX Spectrum). The TS1000 was launched in July 1982 and sparked a massive surge of interest; at one point, the Timex phoneline was receiving over 5,000 calls an hour, 50,000 a week, inquiring about the machine or about microcomputers in general. It was virtually identical to the ZX81 save for re-branding {{and the addition of}} an extra 1 KB of memory, making for a grand total of 2 KB. In the five months following the TS1000's launch, the company sold 550,000 machines, earning Sinclair over $1.2 million in royalties.|$|E
5|$|The Downtown Transit Project {{subcommittee}} unanimously approved Metro {{recommendations that}} would {{reduce the number of}} bus tunnel stations from six to five, saving $35 million, as well as opting for tunnel boring <b>machines</b> <b>for</b> the 3rd Avenue segment to minimize surface-level disruptions that would be present from cut-and-cover excavation. Stations would be located at Union Station south of Jackson Street, under 3rd Avenue and James Street, under 3rd Avenue and University Street, at the Westlake Mall and at 9th Avenue and Pine Street near the Washington State Convention Center. The Metro Council approved the station sites and use of tunnel-boring machines in July 1985, proceeding with final design by approving a $25.9 million contract with Parsons Brinckerhoff for engineering work related to the project.|$|E

The battleship departed Norfolk on 1 November 1948 for a second three-week Arctic cold-weather training cruise to the Davis Strait. During the next two years, Missouri participated in Atlantic command exercises from the New England coast to the Caribbean, alternated with two midshipman summer training cruises. She was overhauled at Norfolk Naval Shipyard from 23 September 1949 to 17 January 1950.|$|E
5|$|Turner marketed Real Adventures {{through a}} {{substantial}} diversity of products, considering its Quest campaign {{a role model}} for future shows. Galoob acquired figurine licensing rights in 1995 and created a product line of vehicles, figures, and Micro <b>Machines</b> <b>for</b> fall 1996 release. Turner felt that Galoob's commitment legitimized the Quest marketing plan, and next secured partnership with Pizza Hut and food retailers. Pillsbury included $3mail-in rebates for future Quest videos, display contests, and instant coupon offers on over 20million packages. Campbell Soup Company released six holographic miniature posters on the same number of SpaghettiOs cans; the posters were awarded in Converting in 1997. General Mills outfitted boxes of Honey Nut Cheerios and Cinnamon Toast Crunch with offers for T-shirts and other items. Over five thousand Pizza Hut restaurants held a two-month-long give-away of figurines with meals during the show's launch. Galoob failed to build popularity for its toys outside the United States, and discontinued the line in 1997.|$|E
5|$|After {{years of}} {{persistence}} and attempts at marketing, Evans's designs were finally given a trial on larger scales and adopted elsewhere. A breakthrough came in 1789 when the Ellicotts, a progressively minded Quaker family in Baltimore, invited Evans to refit their mills on the Patapsco River. The refits proved a success, and Evans worked with Jonathan Ellicott {{to develop a}} modified form of Archimedean screw that could act as a horizontal conveyor to work alongside the vertically orientated bucket elevators. He added a rake-drill and conveyor belt to his designs, and now possessed {{a full complement of}} materials handling <b>machines</b> <b>for</b> just about every possible configuration. In 1790, Evans moved from Newport to Wilmington and constructed a working model of his designs in the town. Evans's inventions were given a major boost when leading miller Joseph Tatnall converted his mills to the Evans system, and estimated that in one year the changes saved his operation a small fortune amounting to $37,000. Local millers quickly followed suit, and Brandywine Village was soon a showcase for Evans's milling technology. After almost a decade, the Brandywine millers were finally convinced, and within a short period automated mills began to spread across the eastern seaboard. In 1790, upon introduction of federal patent law, Evans immediately applied for protection for his milling designs and was granted the third US patent, with his application personally examined and approved by Secretary of State Thomas Jefferson, Secretary of War Henry Knox, and Attorney-General Edmund Randolph.|$|E
