The sociologist Gabriel Tarde commented that [...] "Pornography and slander have become the life-blood of the newspaper." [...] French readers were treated to a daily diet of rumour, speculation and character assassination presented as [...] "echos" [...] and [...] "faits divers". The French press became increasingly dominated by sensationalist and even <b>malicious</b> <b>reporting</b> as it abused the freedoms granted by the 1881 law to [...] "slander and incite to violence with almost total impunity." [...] The writer Émile Zola personified the mixed benefits of the freedom granted by the law. It enabled him to publish his famous denunciation J'accuse in the newspaper L'Aurore in 1898, something that would have been forbidden 20 years previously, but the torrent of lurid newspaper accusations against the unjustly imprisoned Alfred Dreyfus led Zola to denounce the press as being ...|$|E

Finally, it proposes a reputation-based filtering solution to detect fake or <b>malicious</b> <b>reports,</b> and a density-based clustering algorithm to find hotspots which can help the prediction of future events.

40|$|To {{detect the}} {{malicious}} meters committing electricity theft {{in a neighborhood}} area smart grid, in this paper, a novel inspection algorithm, termed as the Binary-Coded Grouping-based Inspection (BCGI) algorithm, is proposed. In the proposed algorithm, each meter is identified with a unique binary-coded number. The BCGI algorithm can locate the unique malicious meter (if any) by one inspection step {{under the assumption that}} at most one meter becomes <b>malicious</b> in one <b>reporting</b> period. Furthermore, by controlling the reporting periods of meters, we could make the probability of the event that at most one meter becomes <b>malicious</b> in one <b>reporting</b> period arbitrarily close to 1 under some assumptions. We further extend the algorithm into a Generalized BCGI algorithm (G-BCGI) to deal with the case that there are two or more meters which happen to commit the theft of electricity in one reporting period.

30|$|Secure data {{transfer}} against the malicious attacks {{is an important}} issue in an infrastructure-less independent network called mobile ad-hoc network (MANET). Trust assurance between MANET nodes is the key parameter in the high-security provision under dynamic topology variations and open wireless constraints. But, the malicious behavior of nodes reduces the trust level of the nodes that leads to an insecure data delivery. The increase in malicious attacks causes the excessive energy consumption that leads to a reduction of network lifetime. The lack of positional information update of the nodes in ad-hoc on-demand vector (AODV) protocol during the connection establishment offers less trust level between the nodes. Hence, the trust rate computation using energy and mobility models and its update are the essential tasks for secure data delivery. This paper proposes a trust-aware ad-hoc routing (T 2 AR) protocol to improve the trust level between the nodes in MANET. The proposed method modifies the traditional AODV routing protocol with the constraints of trust rate, energy, mobility based malicious behavior prediction. The packet sequence ID matching from the log reports of neighbor nodes determine the trust rate that avoids the <b>malicious</b> <b>report</b> generation. Besides, the direct and indirect trust observation schemes utilization increases the trust level. Besides, the received signal strength indicator utilization determines the trusted node is within the communication range or not. The comparative analysis between the proposed T 2 AR with the existing methods such as TRUNCMAN, RBT, GR, FBR and DICOTIDS regarding the average end-to-end delay, throughput, false positives, packet delivery ratio shows the effectiveness of T 2 AR in the secure MANET environment design.|$|R

60|$|I {{remember}} {{some months}} ago I was {{at your house}} upon a commission, where I {{am one of the}} governors: But I went thither not so much on account of the commission, as to ask you some questions concerning Mr. Wood's patent to coin halfpence for Ireland; where you very freely told me, in a mixed company, how much you had been always against that wicked project, which raised in me an esteem for you so far, that I went in a few days to make you a visit, after many years' intermission. I am likewise told, that your son wrote two letters from London, (one of which I have seen) empowering those to whom they were directed, to assure his friends, that whereas there was a <b>malicious</b> <b>report</b> spread of his engaging himself to Mr. Walpole for forty thousand pounds of Wood's coin, to be received in Ireland, the said report was false and groundless; and he had never discoursed with that minister on the subject; nor would ever give his consent to have one farthing of the said coin current here. And although it be long since I have given myself the trouble of conversing with people of titles or stations; yet I have been told by those who can take up with such amusements, {{that there is not a}} considerable person of the kingdom, scrupulous in any sort to declare his opinion. But all this is needless to allege, when we consider, that the ruinous consequences of Wood's patent, have been so strongly represented by both Houses of Parliament; by the Privy-council; the Lord Mayor and Aldermen of Dublin; by so many corporations; and the concurrence of the principal gentlemen in most counties, at their quarter-sessions, without any regard to party, religion, or nation.|$|R
40|$|Abstract—In a {{cognitive}} radio network, selfish secondary users may not voluntarily contribute to desired cooperative sensing. We design the first fully distributed scheme to incentivize participa-tion of nodes in cooperative sensing, by connecting sensing and spectrum allocation, and offering incentive from latter to the former. Secondary users {{that are more}} active and report more accurate sensing values will be given higher reputation values, which results in lower prices in the spectrum allocation phase. Theoretical analysis and simulation {{results indicate that the}} proposed method effectively incentivizes sensing participation, and rewards truthful and accurate reporting. Our proposed system is fully distributed and does not rely on a central authority, and so is more applicable in dynamic cognitive radio networks in practice. We also show how to improve the robustness of reputation when <b>malicious</b> nodes <b>report</b> spurious reputation...|$|R

30|$|The {{compromised}} secondary {{users can}} report false sensing {{information to the}} decision center. According {{to the way they}} send false sensing reports, attackers can be classified into two categories: selfish users and malicious users. The selfish users report yes or high energy level when their sensed energy level is low. In this way they intentionally cause false alarm such that they can use the available spectrum and prevent others from using it. The <b>malicious</b> users <b>report</b> no or low signal level when their sensed energy is high. They will reduce the detection rate, which yields more interference to the primary user. When the primary user is not detected, the secondary users may transmit in the occupied spectrum and interfere with the transmission of the primary user. In this paper, we investigate two attack models, False Alarm (FA) Attack and False Alarm & Miss Detection (FAMD) Attack, as presented in [26, 27].|$|R
