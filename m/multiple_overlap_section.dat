The model of <b>overlapping</b> electrical <b>sectioning</b> device is established by using PSCAD software. By comparing the size of overvoltage when locomotive goes through seven and eight-span <b>overlapping</b> electrical <b>sectioning</b> device, and RC protection devices is installed in seven-span <b>overlapping</b> electrical <b>sectioning</b> device. It can be introduced: inhibitory effect is significant by installing RC protection devices in the neutral line for over-voltage.

40|$|Abstract—An {{algorithm}} is proposed for 3 D face recognition {{in the presence of}} varied facial expressions. It is based on combining the match scores from matching <b>multiple</b> <b>overlapping</b> regions around the nose. Experimental results are presented using the largest database employed to date in 3 D face recognition studies, over 4, 000 scans of 449 subjects. Results show substantial improvement over matching the shape of a single larger frontal face region. This is the first approach to use <b>multiple</b> <b>overlapping</b> regions around the nose to handle the problem of expression variation.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Recently, long (> or = 20 mm) {{coronary}} stents {{were introduced}} for clinical use. They are intended {{as an alternative}} to multiple conventional stents to treat extensive dissections or suboptimal results of long lesions after balloon angioplasty. METHODS: In a total of 113 such consecutive vessels in 107 patients, the flexible Freedom stent was implanted. In 60 of these vessels, because of anatomic constraints, <b>multiple</b> <b>overlapping</b> short (16 mm) stents were implanted. The other 53 vessels were treated with a single long (> or = 20 mm) stent. RESULTS: In the single stent group there were four implantation failures (8 %) successfully managed by crossover to <b>multiple</b> <b>overlapping</b> short stents. During early follow-up, in-stent thrombosis was not observed, but three patients with a single long stent and two patients with <b>multiple</b> <b>overlapping</b> stents suffered myocardial infarction as a result of long lasting myocardial ischemia during a difficult angioplasty procedure. At 6 -month follow-up, > or = 50 % restenosis was measured in 29 % and 35 % of the patients with a single long stent and in those with <b>multiple</b> <b>overlapping</b> stents, respectively (not significant). CONCLUSIONS: Compared with the alternative treatment modality (i. e., implantation of multiple short stents), no difference between in-hospital and 6 -month outcome was observed. However, implantation of a single long stent, when technically feasible, reduces catheterization time, dye volume for the patient, and radiation exposure for both patient and operator during these embarrassing angioplasty procedures. status: publishe...|$|R

Such 2 D mosaics {{can be obtained}} by registering the images of a video-sequence acquired during cystoscopic examinations. The scientific challenge in the registration process lies in the strong inter- and intra-patient texture variability of the images, from which primitives cannot be robustly extracted. State-of-the-art registration methods are not at the same time robust and accurate, especially for image pairs {{with a small amount of}} overlap (less than 90 %) or strong perspective transformations. Moreover, no previous contribution to cystoscopy mosaicing presents panoramic images created from <b>multiple</b> <b>overlapping</b> sequences (e. g. "zigzags" or loop trajectories). We show how such <b>overlapping</b> <b>sections</b> can be automatically detected and present a novel registration algorithm that robustly superimposes non-consecutive image pairs, which are related by stronger perspective transformations and share less overlap than consecutive images (less than 50 %). Globally coherent panoramic images are constructed using a non-linear optimization and a novel contrast-enhancing stitching method. Results on both phantom and patient data are obtained using constant algorithm parameters, which demonstrate the robustness of the proposed method. While the methods presented in this contribution are specifically designed for cystoscopy mosaicing, they can also be applied to more general mosaicing problems. We demonstrate this on a traditional stitching application, where a set of pictures of a building are stitched into a seamless, globally coherent panoramic image...|$|R

Our protocols provide two kinds of message delivery ordering - causal ordering and total ordering.

In comparison with previous protocols for these problems, our protocols are cheaper and scale up better.

In particular, a previously investigated method for plotting the stability regions of PIl and PDm controllers is extended to their integer-order approximations. Next, the two stability regions are compared and their <b>overlapping</b> <b>sections,</b> {{referred to as the}} implementable stability region, are derived. In order for the final closed-loop system to be stable, the designer must choose the controller parameters from the <b>overlapping</b> <b>section</b> of the two stability regions. Simulation results for two example systems are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. The authors believe that the devised scheme can facilitate the design procedure for fractional-order PI and PD controllers...|$|R
