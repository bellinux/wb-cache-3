In many aspects, WindowLab has looked to the Amiga's user interface for inspiration without cloning it completely. Its top-level menu bar is accessed by a right click as on the Amiga and it follows Fitts's law of usability in that once the mouse enters the <b>menu</b> <b>area</b> it is constrained there in both the horizontal and vertical directions. Unlike on the Amiga, the menu bar is not controlled by applications; it is a global launcher menu which is populated by a dot file in the user's home directory containing a list of menu titles and commands.|$|E
40|$|Aesthetics {{can have}} {{a pivotal role in}} the success of Web sites [Interacting with Computers 15 (2003) 429], but need to be {{considered}} in conjunction with task performance. Typical Web pages divide the screen into a <b>menu</b> <b>area</b> for navigation and a content area to display information. The Golden Section can be applied to decide on the proportion of these two areas on the screen when designing this type of page. Using a computer-controlled experiment, we examined the role of aesthetics in the use of Web pages. Ninety-eight participants completed an information retrieval task. Analysis of variance showed that the effect of screen ratio (width of <b>menu</b> <b>area</b> to content area) on task performance and subjective outcomes was statistically significant. Application of the Golden Section was found to result in the worst screen ratio. The results are discussed in terms of theories of categorisation and aesthetic behaviour, and design recommendations are given...|$|E

No differences were found between computer and text conditions in total number of correct answers located. Computer groups searched the glossary more often than printed text groups. Possible explanations for these results are discussed and implications for future research are drawn. Researchers of reading recently have become interested in how individual...|$|R

40|$|Selecting {{items in}} {{cascading}} pull-down menus {{is a frequent}} task in most GUIs. These selections involve two major components: steering and selection, with the steering component being the most time-consuming and error-prone. We describe a new technique, called Adaptive Activation-Area Menu (AAMU) that eliminate corner steering. AAMUs contain an enlarged activation area which dynamically resizes itself providing a broader steering path for menu navigation. We also combined AAMUs with Force-field menus, to create Force-AAMUs. We empirically demonstrate that AAMUs and Force-AAMUs outperformed the current default menu. We also compared performances of various other menus including Enlarged activation <b>area</b> <b>menus</b> (EMUs) and Gesture based selection with mouse as an input device. Overall, users show higher satisfaction rates for AAMUs over other menu designs. Author Keywords Cascading pull-down menus, menu navigation, steering...|$|R
40|$|Cascading menus {{are used}} in almost all {{graphical}} user interfaces. Most current cascade widgets implement an explicit delay between the cursor entering/leaving a parent cascade menu item and posting/unposting the associated menu. The delay allows users to make small steering errors while dragging across items, and it allows optimal diagonal paths from parent to cascade items. However, the delay slows the pace of interaction for users who wait for the delay to expire, and it demands jerky discrete movements for experts who wish to pre-empt the delay by clicking. This paper describes Enlarged activation <b>area</b> <b>MenUs</b> (EMUs), which have two features: first, they increase {{the area of the}} parent menu associated with each cascade; second, they eliminate the posting and unposting delay. An evaluation shows that EMUs allow cascade items to be selected up to 29 % faster than traditional menus, without harming top-level item selection times. They also have a positive smoothing effect on menu selections, allowing continuous sweeping selections in contrast to discrete movements that are punctuated with clicks.

5000|$|The Ultima {{series of}} RPGs marks {{one of the}} first uses of an overworld. Many games have {{emulated}} Ultimas overworlds, especially fantasy-based ones. The most prominent example in this category is the Dragon Quest series. In each of this type of overworld game, most of the action (or at least most of the plot-advancing action) takes place in towns, forests, dungeons, caves, castles (and the surrounding area), camps, fortresses, mass transportation systems, celestial bodies (e.g. the moon), and other locations. In the Dragon Quest series, the overworld is used as a [...] "travel map", and changes to a closer perspective for direct gameplay or confrontation. The overworlds featured in most of the 2D adventures of this genre commonly depict the character(s)' proportions as larger than they actually would be in the world being traveled, thus lending necessary visibility to the player. The characters' animation in this type of overworld is often simpler than that found in the game's <b>menus</b> and other <b>areas,</b> while more complicated movement such as combat, climbing or visibly handling objects sometimes happens at closer perspectives, and often involves cutscenes.|$|R

40|$|To {{learn how}} to use rangelands profitably, {{livestock}} farmers must have a clear understanding of how they can influence herd behaviour (using external appetite-stimulating factors) to make the animals consume diets consistent with targeted production objectives with minimum external inputs. The feed value of rangelands results to a large extent from the feeding management which {{can take advantage of the}} heterogeneity of pastoral <b>areas</b> (<b>MENU</b> model), a factor usually considered as a structural constraint. The overall palatability of each intake component may be considered to result from its intrinsic palatability (i. e., mainly related to metabolic regulations linked to the digestion process) and from its circumstantial palatability (derived from previous learning by the animals and from the grazing conditions). This leads to characterising the specific roles assigned to individual paddocks in the daily feeding process and dispensing with the "pastoral potential" concept, of little operational value in our conditions. Taking account of the foraging herd's behavioural responses poses new questions to nutrition scientists about the time dimension involved in the feeding process: the short-term effects of interactions between different feeds, of meal sequences during the day, of feed shifts between the grazing seasons and even the long term effects of behavioural learnin...|$|R
40|$|The {{increasing}} use of 3 D {{user interface}} elements, particularly 3 D menus, demonstrates the need to expand {{research in the field}} of Human Computer Interaction (HCI) as it pertains to 3 D user interfaces. The results of this thesis contribute {{to the understanding of the}} cognitive impacts of using 3 D <b>menus.</b> Multiple application <b>areas</b> for 3 D menus have been identified where memory retention is a critical success factor, but little research has been done in the area of memory retention for 3 D menus. The purpose of this thesis is to investigate if the use of 3 D carousel menus increases retention of information over 2 D menus and if is there a gender effect with these results. A three factor split-plot (one-between subject factor and two-within subject factors) experiment was designed to test if menu dimension, content type, and gender are significant factors in memory retention and to determine if there are any interactions between these factors. The results of the experiment revealed that dimension and gender are not significant factors in the retention of information and none of the interactions of dimension (2 D vs. 3 D), gender, and content were significant. Several subjects’ questionnaire responses demonstrated that the menu dimension they perceived to better aid retention was 3 D; however these results were not statistically significant. While these results showed that within the boundaries chosen the use of a 3 D menu neither promotes nor degrades memory retention, there are still a number of questions that need to be answered regarding the use of 3 D menus and their effect on other cognitive processes...|$|R
