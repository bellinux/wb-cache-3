5000|$|According to Gourdine and Lemmons' study, Perceptions of Misogyny in Hip Hop and Rap: What Do the Youths Think?, {{the youth}} {{population}} is highly affected {{and involved in}} the hip hop and rap music industry. Individuals from ages 18-24 spend a majority of their time listening {{to this type of}} music, so researchers Gourdine and Lemmons conducted this study and found that it was easier to understand youth's perceptions on misogyny by focusing on their listening habits and age. When first conducting this research, it was difficult for youth to express their opinions {{due to the fact that}} they already had a preconceived notion that adults did not support rap music, [...] "the youths expressed concern that there were different genres of hip hop and rap music and that one needed to understand the history of those artists who fell into what they termed conscious and unconscious categorizations" [...] (Gourdine, 2008). The youth admitted that, [...] "Even those youths who embrace the lifestyle agree that the media sensationalizes a way of living that can do harm to their communities" [...] (Brown & Gourdine, 1998, 2001, 2007). After conducting a study amongst 262 individuals in an undergraduate college, the researchers revealed that the youth, [...] "who listened to rap and hip hop music less frequently were more likely to have negative perceptions of and attitudes toward the music, and those who listened more frequently were more likely to have positive perceptions and attitudes…That is, the younger group (18- to 20-year-olds) reported significantly greater scores on the violent-misogyny subscale indicating more positive perceptions and attitudes toward rap and hip hop music than the older group (21- to 23-year-olds)" [...] (Gourdine, 2008). This study came to the conclusion that the younger the individuals listening to this rap and hip hop music, the more likely they did not identify the misogyny that came with this type of music. According to Gourdine and Lemmons, the older the individuals are, the more likely they are mature and disidentify with the harsh words and misogyny against women in rap music. Gourdine and Lemmons suggest that in order to improve the youth's understanding on rap music we must, [...] "monitor the amount of time spent listening to music, which gives youths other alternatives. This study indicates that the younger the youths, the more likely they will listen to rap. This population is college-age, and the <b>maturity</b> <b>factor</b> may have affected the findings in this study. A study looking at younger youths is needed. The opportunity to analyze the music can be useful as well" [...] (Gourdine, 2008).|$|E
40|$|The paper {{deals with}} the {{spawning}} cycle of the hake, Merluccius merluccius hubbsi in the fishing area of the Argentine fleet, SW Atlantic (35 °- 46 ° L. S. : 53 °- 63 ° L. W.; 30 - 160 fathoms depth). It was {{made on the basis}} of the weekly sampling of the commercial catch in the period January 1965 - March 1968. The results have been compared with those of the exploratory surveys made by the United Nations Fisheries Development Program (República Argentina - FAO). The histological study, which was made with 741 specimens, was most intensive in females than in males. The results have been compared with the sexual stage determinations of both sexes in the total samples during the period before mentioned. The conclusions are: 1. The analysis of the ovocytes frequency distributions showed a period of resting or slow recuperation (April - August) with a mode of 120 ~k and one of rapid transformation (October - December) from 120 μ tíll 830 ~k. After December it appears again the mode of 120 ~k which indicated the reserve stock. 2. The <b>maturity</b> <b>factor</b> shows in both sexes a period of low values, 0, 52 to 2 % (April - September) and, another with higher values (October - March). In the first period the values are concentrated, while in the second one a large dispersion is observed produced by the rapidity of the growth process of the gonads. It is more evident between November and December. 3. The liver weight variations, compared with the degree of ingestion and the values of the <b>maturity</b> <b>factor,</b> in time, demonstrated that: a) after two periods of abundant ingestion (March - April and October- November) there are two increases of the liver index; b) the increase of the Iiver index has a direct relation to the maturity factor; c) at the end of the summer season, when the values of the <b>maturity</b> <b>factor</b> decrease, those of the liver index are still high. This demonstrates that the hake does not arrive exhausted at the end of the spawning season and that a rapid recuperation for a new spawning by part of the stock is possible. 4. Females predominate in the samples during most of the year. In the period October - December, when sexual activation occurs, as it is demonstrated by the high values of the <b>maturity</b> <b>factor,</b> proportions are nearly 1 : 1, and males at times are more numerous than females. 5. The analisys of the advaneed maturity stages, in relation to total length shows that in the hake, Iike in other fishes, the largest ones mature first. This applies for both sexes. 6. The study of the <b>maturity</b> <b>factor</b> values and the sexual stages of the samples allows the recognition of two spawning periods, the main one in summer (October - March) and another in winter (June - July). 7. Part of the summer spawners, with a rapid recuperation, should be able to spawn again in winter. This indicates that the hake population, acording to our samples, has two different possibilities of spawning. 8. After analysis of the frequency percentages composition of mature specimens it is concluded that during the summer season, when hake is fished in shallow waters and in a wide area (38 °– 43 ° L. S.) the fleet is fishing on the spawning stocks. Some winter spawners specimens have been found at 37 °- 38 ° L. S. and in waters of more than 100 fathoms depth. 9. A new maturity scale of seven stages is proposed, instead of the one of six stages now in use. The new added stage corresponds to the postspawners during its resting period...|$|E

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} the paper is to {{investigate}} the relationship between supply chain maturity and performance, with specific references both to the business process orientation maturity model and to the supply chain operation reference model. Design/methodology/approach – Quantitative, survey based research was carried out with 478 Brazilian companies. Statistical analysis combined the use of descriptive statistics and structural equation modeling. Findings – Empirical results indicate a strong and positive statistical relationship between supply chain maturity and performance. The results also suggest that the deliver process maturity has a higher impact on overall performance than the other supply chain processes. Research limitations/implications – Quantifying supply chain maturity and performance {{is an opportunity for}} a company to align its performance measurements and process improvement actions with its broader policies and strategies. The use of this approach has been validated in several previous research studies in organizational self-assessment and business management. Practical implications – Maturity models are valuable frameworks for corporate leadership. This study provides solid statistical evidence that a company that has achieved a higher maturity level and implemented the <b>maturity</b> <b>factors</b> also has achieved superior performance. It also validates the application of these specific <b>maturity</b> <b>factors</b> in South America, specifically Brazil. Originality/value – This paper confirms and expands upon earlier research suggesting higher levels of process maturity were related to superior performance. This paper also examines the evolution of performance measurement systems, moving from a traditional approach to a more proces...|$|R
40|$|Maturity is a {{critical}} trait for better adaptation and productivity of sorghum (Sorghum bicolor L. Moench) in stress environments where this crop is usually grown. Despite accrued knowledge of how genotypes with different maturity respond to environments, breeding efficiency is still limited by poor characterization of individual quantitative trait loci (QTL) affecting this trait. The objective {{of this research was}} to identify <b>factors</b> of sorghum <b>maturity</b> through DNA marker association, and to determine their relationships with other important agronomic traits. The 10 % earliest and 10 % latest maturing sorghum lines were identified in FGxM 90812 (Cross 1) and MMxSEPON 72 (Cross 2). Parents and progeny were evaluated at one temperate location in the US and six semi-arid tropical locations in Niger. For each cross, maturity (days to anthesis), plant height, and grain yield data were statistically analyzed considering six alternative groupings of locations. Genetic variability for maturity and plant height was high. For grain yield however there was significant genetic variability only in Cross 2 under rainfed conditions of Niger. Seventy-three random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) and six simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers in Cross 1, and 62 RAPD markers in Cross 2, were used in single marker analyses. In Cross 1, 17 of the 79 markers (22 %) detected maturity loci with stable expression across environments. Most of these markers also identified plant height factors in all environments, but grain yield and maturity were related only when the temperate location was included. In Cross 2 four markers out of 62 (6 %) detected <b>maturity</b> <b>factors</b> in all environmental settings. In this cross, maturity influenced plant height and grain yield especially under rainfed conditions in Niger. A set of 121 recombinant inbred lines (RIL) independently developed from Cross 1 was used to confirm association of six of the above DNA markers with <b>maturity</b> <b>factors.</b> Four RAPD and two SSR collectively explained 47 % of the phenotypic variation for maturity in the RIL.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to observe the {{development}} degree under the morphological aspect at Ardenez horses from Izvin Stud. For this we have observed 8 exterior indicators on horses starting from 0 - 6 months to adult ones. The research was made on strength of 49 horses Ardenez thoroughbred, where absolute growth and the growth coefficients of the main corporal dimensions were calculated for the actual young Ardenez horses, compared with the absolute growth and the growth coefficients of the main corporal dimensions for young Ardenez horses raised in 2002 at Izvin Stud. As a result of the research, we’ve find that the growth of the main corporal dimensions on young horses is influenced by internal and external factors. From the internal factors, the precocity specific for the heavy thoroughbred, has influence upon the growth of the main corporal dimensions, thus at the age of 3, some of this dimensions stop their growth.

40|$|Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) {{is one of}} {{the most}} common {{psychiatric}} disorders of childhood. Despite a long history, widespread clinical acceptance, and extensive research, the diagnosis and treatment are still controversial. The aim of the thesis was to study the hypothesis that some children with ADHD may show these symptoms due to a slow speed of mental maturation with the possibility of a catch-up. · In Study I, the association between ADHD and global maturity was tested using a twin design (incl. 1106 pairs of the 1480 pairs of twins born in Sweden Apr. 1985 - Dec. 1986). The results showed different pathways through which genetic effects may influence the behavior pattern in children with ADHD. Among boys, there are at least two different genetic pathways to explain ADHD, one through predisposition for maturational lag and one specific to ADHD. A different pathway may explain ADHD in girls. · In Study II, the relationship between behavior, ADM symptoms and maturity was studied among 1079 pairs of twins from study I using a questionnaire (a global maturity parent's scale) given to the parents. Relationships were found between the <b>maturity</b> <b>factor</b> and the CBCL grouping of syndromes (internalizing, externalizing, total behavior problems score) as well as between the <b>maturity</b> <b>factor</b> and ADHD. From the parents' point of view the behavior problems in their children may be related to maturity. · In Study III, a computerized tool, the Gordon Diagnostic System (GDS) was used to test concentration and impulse control comparing 71 children with ADHD (61 boys, 10 girls; mean age 10. 5 y) and 98 controls (65 boys, 23 girls; mean age 10. 2 y). Differences were found between ADHD children and age- matched control children in each age group. The GDS scores were highly correlated with age with better a performance among the older children, which could support the relevance of the maturational lag hypothesis. · In Study IV a possible immature brain processing during concentration was studied comparing 36 children with ADHD (31 boys, 5 girls; mean age 10. 5 y) and 63 controls (46 boys, 17 girls; mean age 10. 0 y). QEEG techniques were used when the children performed the Vigilance Task of GDS. Compared to controls children with ADHD displayed specific differences in the pattern of frontal, temporal, and parietal brain activation. They had an enhanced slow cortical activity and decreased fast activity similar to younger children. These findings indicate a different arousal level in children with ADHD, which could be due to a delay in functional cortical maturation. · In Study V, impulsivity, brain processing and possible immaturity were studied. The same children with ADHD and controls as in study IV performed the Delay Task of GDS during registration of QEEG. In similarity to the results of study IV children with ADHD displayed different electrophysiological reactions, which may indicate that they, like younger children, have problems in cerebral processing when performing a mentally demanding task during a restricted time. · In Study VI, the "maturational lag" concept explaining ADHD was discussed over viewing previous and current literature on ADHD. The overview indicates that the DSM criteria of ADHD may be over- inclusive and shows that maturity and developmental aspects are important factors to be included in studies of ADHD. A slow speed in mental development may be of importance for the treatment and prognosis of ADHD. Conclusion. The over all results support the view, that some children with ADHD could represent a continuum of normal childhood behavior with maturational trajectories that are lagging behind and may catch up...|$|E

The understanding of university students was assessed through ex post facto scrutiny of responses to a projectile question set in their mid-year examination. The {{results of this study}} were analyzed through the responses of the learners and university students. The study revealed that the grade 11 learners performed better than their grade 12 counterparts, though the same questionnaire was used for both groups. Such differences may be associated with the fact that projectile motion is taught during the grade 11 year of study. Grade 11 learners may therefore have a better memory recall of the formal teaching of the topic and associated concepts. By contrast, grade 12 learners might have resorted to a “re-understanding” of the various concepts as they have been acquired in their own world: these are what the literature refers to as, inter alia, alternative conceptions or naïve ideas. The performance of university students was also better than that of the grades 11 and 12 learners.

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{model the}} growth of peak aerobic power during {{adolescence}} in both sexes followed longitudinally from 10 to 18 yr. METHODS: Peak aerobic power (peak VO 2) was measured annually during a maximal treadmill test with the Bruce protocol. Height and weight were measured semiannually. The Preece-Baines Model I growth function was used to fit curves to data for individuals with >/= six observations for peak aerobic power to estimate age at peak velocity (PV) for peak VO 2 (age at PVPVO 2), PVPVO 2 (L x min(- 1) x yr(- 1)), and value at PVPVO 2 (L x min(- 1)) for each individual. Curves were successfully fitted for 83 individuals (48 males, 35 females). The model was also fitted to individual data for height and weight to estimate ages at peak height velocity (PHV) and peak weight velocity (PWV). Age at PVPVO 2 was compared with ages at PHV and PWV. Pearson correlation coefficients were calculated between ages at PV and PV for peak VO 2, height, and weight. RESULTS: Mean ages at PVPVO 2 are 12. 3 +/- 1. 2 yr for females and 14. 1 +/- 1. 2 yr for males. Peak VO 2 increases in both sexes throughout adolescence, with males having higher values than females at all ages. Age at PVPVO 2 occurs nearly coincident with PHV and before PWV in both sexes. Correlation coefficients among ages at PHV, PWV, and PVPVO 2 suggest a general <b>maturity</b> <b>factor</b> for body size and aerobic power.

40|$|With {{increasing}} {{economic pressures}} and exponential growth in technological innovations, companies are increasingly relying on digital technologies {{to fulfill their}} innovation and value creation agendas. At the same time, based on the increasing levels of cyber-security breaches, {{it is clear that}} the trustworthiness of many established and new technologies is not yet well addressed or appreciated as a fundamental core value in the new digital economy. Consequently, companies are aggressively pursuing strategies to increase cybersecurity of their existing and new digital assets. Many ClOs are faced with having to deal with both of these priorities simultaneously and find them to be frequently conflicting, and creating tensions. This exploratory study first introduces a framework for evaluating these risk/reward trade-offs. Through a survey and a series of interviews, companies are positioned in different quadrants on a digital innovation and cyber-security maturity matrix. This positioning is then overlaid with the perceptual negative impact of cyber-security controls on the innovative projects. The thesis then analyzes the industry level, firm level, technology management and the technology <b>maturity</b> <b>factors</b> that affect this perception and these trade-offs. Ultimately the thesis provides a set of practical recommendations for any company to evaluate their own positioning on the innovation / cyber-security matrix, understand the underlying factors that affect that position and how to better manage these trade-offs. by Natalia (Natasha) Nelson.

Sheep were fed a pelleted ration throughout the experiment, and BW loss induced by reducing feed intake. Following developmental growth from 30 to 37. 8 kg, Groups B and C lost 21 % BW at 122 and 63 gd- 1, respectively to reach 30. 2 kg BW. Following developmental growth from 30 to 46. 7 kg (Groups D and E), Group D lost 34 % BW at 125 gd- 1 to reach 30. 8. kg BW, while Group E lost 23 % BW at 157 gd- 1 to reach 35. 0 kg. Group A was a control group fed ad libitum throughout the experiment. When ad libitum feeding was resumed compensatory growth occurred in treatment groups for up to 10 kg recovery of BW. Group D showed the most persistent increases in growth rate compared with that of control sheep, however, above 50 kg BW {{there were no significant differences}} between groups in growth rate. Weight loss did not produce a reversal of the compositional changes which occurred with increasing BW during developmental growth, in the whole body, carcass or offal. However, differences in composition between groups at the end of weight loss were not significant. During compensatory growth there were few differences between groups in the relative growth rates of protein, fat, ash or water in the whole body, carcass or offal. There were some differences between groups in weights of components at specific BW, carcass weight (CW) and offal weight WW), most notably fat and ash. However, these differences appeared to be transitory, and reflected the composition of that portion of the animal at the start of realimentation, rather than an effect of weight loss which was maintained during compensatory growth. The body, carcass and offal composition of sheep appeared to be resilient to periods of nutritional stress, and tended to return to the "normal" composition expected at that weight. The effects of up to 18 weeks severe undernutrition, resulting in rapid BW loss, were able to be overcome during compensatory growth when feed was offered ad libitum. Compared with developmental growth, nitrogen retention increased during compensatory growth. However, the efficiency of ME utilization was not different during these two periods of growth, although DE requirements for maintenance were lower during compensatory growth, compared with developmental growth. Dry matter intakes (DMI) of treatment groups required up to 13 weeks to return to the DMI of sheep during developmental growth, once ad libitum feeding was resumed. Over their respective growth paths Groups A, B, C, D and E required the same amount of feed to reach 50 kg BW. Wool growth rate (WGR) responded more slowly than BW to changes in level of nutrition, both during weight loss and during compensatory growth. There was a lag phase of at least 30 days. WGR during compensatory growth was reduced and required up to 14 weeks to return to developmental WGR after ad libitum feeding was resumed. Total body water (TBW), estimated from tritiated water (TOH) space in sheep undergoing compensatory growth, was overestimated by at least 20 %. TOH space was measured without imposing a period of prior starvation on the sheep, and this may have contributed to the large overestimate. Multiple regression equations including TOH space, BW and a <b>maturity</b> <b>factor</b> (M), were able to explain up to 95 % of the variation in chemical composition of the body, but residual standard errors were still high.

40|$|This paper reviews {{experience}} with credit union demutualization {{to date in}} the light of increasing discussion about whether demutualization is a likely (or inevitable) future stage in the evolutionary process. It is argued that the credit union industry faces an inherent demutualization bias which emerges as the sector develops <b>maturity.</b> Contributing <b>factors</b> include the emergence of professional management pursuing personal objectives, together with the economic realities of technological change, financial liberalization, increased competition, and prudential regulation based on minimum capital requirements. Demutualization incentives may partially reflect the unsuitability of the mutual form of governance in larger, more sophisticated financial institutions, {{but there is also a}} significant risk of demutualization based on wealth expropriation motives. Alternative policies and strategies which might avoid this demutualization bias are examined...|$|R

The factors used are the market return of the Mexican Stock Exchange, the return of the S&P 500 index, the US dollar exchange rate, and political risk. Political risk is measured by the interest rate spread on Mexican sovereign debt and a U. S. treasury note of a matching <b>maturity.</b> These <b>factors</b> are assumed to be proxies for exposures to underlying economic risk factors that are priced in the market. The factor model is evaluated in its unconditional and conditional versions.

So this study investigated the relationship between religious orientation and inclination to think critically and Coping with Stress in the Faculty of Humanities graduate students of Yazd University was conducted. Method: statistical community research includes 1617 students graduate from the University of Yazd, which according to Morgan- Krejci Table  the number of 300 students of faculty of humanity for example, chosen with equally classification random sampling method. to measure the research variables we used Allport religious oriented questionnaire, Ricketts questionnaire of disposition critical thinking and the coping Inventory for Stressful Situations of Andler and Parker. Data analysis using Pearson correlation coefficient and multiple regression analysis. Results: first between internal religious orientation and second between external religious orientation with problem focused coping style and also observed a positive and medium correlation between disposition critical thinking and problem-focused coping style in students. Among the factors of disposition critical thinking, there was a significant and positive correlation between innovation and mental <b>maturity</b> <b>factors</b> with problem-focused ciping style, and mental occupation factor first with problem-focused coping style and then with avoidant coping style and in reverse there was a significant negative correlation between mental factor with avoidant and emotional coping styles. among five anticipant variables, respectively, there was a direct relationship between mental occupation, internal and external religious orientations in anticipation of problem-focused coping style, a reverse relationship between internal religious orientations and mental maturity in anticipation of emotional coping style, a direct relationship between external religious orientations and mental occupation in anticipation of avoidant coping style, and finally a reverse relationship between innovation and mental maturity in anticipation of avoidant coping style. Conclusion: with respect to our research findings, it is possible to increase student’s utilization of efficient coping style facing stressful events through education of critical thinking and internalization of religious...|$|R
40|$|In 2010, Gartner {{published}} a research report describing {{the market for}} Policy Administration Systems for the European general insurance market. Many insurance companies are still struggling with inflexible, monolithic and technologically outdated policy administration systems, which are often home-grown and heavily modified. Insurance companies do acknowledge the need to update or replace their systems with modern software solutions that are compliant with the current trends of SOA and software-as-a-service (SaaS) and/or web technologies. For insurance companies, however, it is often unclear what their position is at the moment and how an implementation of a modern IPMS can improve their performance. This work aims {{to bridge the gap}} by providing a maturity model based on process increments and performance indicators. This way, insurance organizations can easily assess their current situation and the desired situation by making use of process descriptions. Performance indicators are used to identify how an organization will benefit from a process increment. Besides assessing the as-is and the to-be situation, a maturity score can be calculated to indicate how maturity increases after implementing one or more process increments. The findings presented in this work are based on an extensive review of management and scientific literature and functional documentation, and expert interviews from both an insurance software provider and three insurance providers. The results show that although process increments are not yet (widely) used in the industry, they do show promise for practical application. Insurance providers do make use of process descriptions, but not for the purpose of process improvement, but rather for risk management. The validation interviews show that process descriptions and process increments combined with <b>maturity</b> <b>factors</b> and a <b>maturity</b> model could simplify IPM implementation project, because they provide a relatively fast and easy way to visualize the as-is and the to-be situation. Maturity models are being used more often, but mostly on an organizational level (e. g. CMM-based models) and not on a process level...|$|R
40|$|The IT {{consultancy}} {{industry is}} characterized by knowledge intensive implementationprojects related to varying levels of standardized information system software. When faced with a large implementation project at a previously unknown customer various assessmentsis usually conducted to identify the level of fit between the software and organizationin order to plan and structure the implementation process. However, there are several aspects of the customer organization that potentially can affect the end result {{as well as the}} implementation process that is unrelated to the fit between the software and the implementation organization as well as the potency of the implementation method. By conducting measurements of these <b>maturity</b> <b>factors</b> within the customer organization the implementing procedure can be modified based on the customer maturity level in order to become more aligned with the capabilities present in the customer organization. Research question: Which aspects need to be covered by a Customer Maturity Analysis Tool (CMAT) in order to evaluate the pre implementation maturity for potential customersof our case company and how should these aspects be organized and measured? The first task of the research process was to create an underlying model of maturity perspectives and aspects to structure the literature review as well as the empirical data collection. It was decided to adhere to a deductive approach where the theoretical model would be validated and if necessary modified in accordance to feedback from potential users of the CMAT within the case company. This procedure was repeated in the creation of measurements and maturity levels for the aspects {{to be used in the}} tool. The research process would therefore transition from a general model based on literature review, through a iterative feedback loop to a final model tailored to the specific requirementsof the case company. The final CMAT ended up containing four main perspectives of customer maturity; ITi nfrastructure, Culture, Process and Business Governance. These four perspectives were in turn divided into subgroups in order to be able to aggregate and compare differentaspects of the perspectives with each other...|$|R

The study was conducted using qualitative approach interviewing 16 retailers in Saudi Arabia. It comes up with 22 factors that are believed the most influencing factors for retailers in Saudi Arabia. Interestingly, there seem to be differences between retailers in companies at different maturity stages in terms of having different attitudes regarding the issues of using e-commerce. The businesses that have reached a high stage of e-commerce maturity provide practical evidence of positive and optimistic attitudes and practices regarding use of e-commerce, whereas the businesses that have not reached higher levels of maturity provide practical evidence of more negative and pessimistic attitudes and practices. The study, therefore, should contribute to efforts leading to greater e-commerce development in Saudi Arabia and other countries with similar context. Full Tex...|$|R

More controllable retting procedures to produce quality fibers from flax are sought by applying chelators at high pH and enzyme chelating formulations at lower pH.

40|$|We {{study the}} problem of {{simultaneous}} and coherent assessment {{the probability of a}} firm's bankruptcy at various time horizons in future. In contrast with usual (one-period) formulations of the problem, such multi-period formulation better matches the nature of bankruptcy process (bankruptcy occurs in time) and allows an easier and more natural incorporation of bankruptcy (default) prognoses in valuation of risky debt and equity, optimization of corporate capital structure etc. The study uses a new mathematical apparatus—multi-alternative decision rules of statistical decision theory. We investigate a new type of predictive variables that can be extracted from the maturity schedule of a firm's long-term debt. The study develops Bayesian-type forecasting rules that use both <b>maturity</b> schedule <b>factors</b> and traditional financial ratios. These rules noticeably enhance bankruptcy prediction (compared with the familiar one-period Z-score rules of Altman) for bankruptcy within the first 1, 2 or 3 years. Predictive factors derived from schedule information enhance bankruptcy prediction at distant time horizons. 32 page(s...|$|R
