25|$|Building {{the camera}} took {{years and was}} delayed several times by NASA. In the spring of 1992, with launch only months away, the camera was {{installed}} on the <b>Mars</b> <b>Observer.</b> The launch was successful and in January 1993 it took some photos but then, the Observer spacecraft ceased operations. Fortunately, MSSS had built a double and so two years later, the double was sent up (in November 1996) and that camera worked flawlessly for the next decade.|$|E
25|$|Following the 1993 {{failure of}} the <b>Mars</b> <b>Observer</b> orbiter, the NASA Mars Global Surveyor {{achieved}} Mars orbit in 1997. This mission was a complete success, having finished its primary mapping mission in early 2001. Contact was lost with the probe in November 2006 during its third extended program, spending exactly 10 operational years in space. The NASA Mars Pathfinder, carrying a robotic exploration vehicle Sojourner, landed in the Ares Vallis on Mars {{in the summer of}} 1997, returning many images.|$|E

2500|$|After the 1992 {{failure of}} NASA's <b>Mars</b> <b>Observer</b> orbiter, NASA {{retooled}} and launched Mars Global Surveyor (MGS). [...] Mars Global Surveyor launched on November 7, 1996, and entered orbit on September 12, 1997. After {{a year and}} a half trimming its orbit from a looping ellipse to a circular track around the planet, the spacecraft began its primary mapping mission in March 1999. It observed the planet from a low-altitude, nearly polar orbit over the course of one complete Martian year, the equivalent of nearly two Earth years. Mars Global Surveyor completed its primary mission on January 31, 2001, and completed several extended mission phases.|$|E

50|$|The Mars Orbiter Camera and <b>Mars</b> <b>Observer</b> Camera (MOC) were {{scientific}} instruments {{on board the}} <b>Mars</b> <b>Observer</b> and Mars Global Surveyor spacecraft. The camera was built by Malin Space Science Systems (MSSS) for NASA {{and the cost of}} the whole MOC scientific investigation project was about US$ 44 million, higher than anticipated in the budget.|$|E
50|$|<b>Mars</b> <b>Observer</b> was an {{unmanned}} spacecraft designed {{to study the}} geoscience and climate of Mars. The first of the proposed Observer series of planetary missions, it was launched by NASA on September 25, 1992. Three days before <b>Mars</b> <b>Observer</b> was scheduled to enter the orbit of Mars, contact with the spacecraft was lost. Attempts to re-establish communication with the spacecraft were unsuccessful.|$|E
5000|$|Only two Transfer Orbit Stages were {{launched}}. The {{first was}} launched on 25 September 1992, aboard a Commercial Titan III with the <b>Mars</b> <b>Observer</b> spacecraft bound for Mars. Despite a successful launch, the <b>Mars</b> <b>Observer</b> spacecraft later malfunctioned. The second {{use of a}} TOS was the deployment of the Advanced Communications Technology Satellite from [...] on mission STS-51. This was also successful.|$|E
50|$|Founded in 1990, {{their first}} mission was the failed 1993 <b>Mars</b> <b>Observer</b> {{for which they}} {{developed}} and operated the <b>Mars</b> <b>Observer</b> Camera Ground Data System. After this mission they were selected to provide the main camera for Mars Global Surveyor. They also developed the cameras that were carried on Mars Polar Lander, Mars Climate Orbiter, 2001 Mars Odyssey, Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter and Phoenix lander.|$|E
50|$|The first Planetary Observer {{spacecraft}} {{to be approved}} was <b>Mars</b> <b>Observer,</b> in 1985. Lunar Observer (LO), proposed for a 1997 launch, would have been sent into a long-term lunar orbit at 60 miles above the Moon's poles. The Mercury Observer (MO) was also proposed for a 1997 launch. However, Congressionally imposed reductions to FY 1992-93 funding requirements forced NASA to terminate the Planetary Observer program, with just <b>Mars</b> <b>Observer</b> funded.|$|E

50|$|After {{the loss}} of <b>Mars</b> <b>Observer</b> and {{the onset of the}} rising costs {{associated}} with the future International Space Station, NASA began seeking less expensive, smaller probes for scientific interplanetary missions. In 1994, the Panel on Small Spacecraft Technology was established to set guidelines for future miniature spacecraft. The panel determined that the new line of miniature spacecraft should be under 1000 kilograms with highly focused instrumentation. In 1995, a new Mars Surveyor program began as a set of missions designed with limited objectives, low costs, and frequent launches. The first mission in the new program was Mars Global Surveyor, launched in 1996 to map Mars and provide geologic data using instruments intended for <b>Mars</b> <b>Observer.</b> Following Mars Global Surveyor, Mars Climate Orbiter carried two instruments, one originally intended for <b>Mars</b> <b>Observer,</b> to study the climate and weather of Mars.|$|E
50|$|The final {{flight of}} the Commercial Titan III {{occurred}} on 25 September 1992, and placed NASA's <b>Mars</b> <b>Observer</b> spacecraft into heliocentric orbit, {{by means of a}} Transfer Orbit Stage.|$|E
50|$|Compton and Ulysses {{were joined}} briefly by <b>Mars</b> <b>Observer</b> in late 1992, before that {{spacecraft}} failed. Some feel that Compton provided sufficient continuity, {{and that the}} distinction between 2nd, 3rd, and subsequent IPNs is semantic.|$|E
50|$|As a {{graduate}} student, Lee participated in several NASA planetary spacecraft missions, including Voyager 2s flyby of Neptune and its large moon Triton, Galileos flyby of asteroids 951 Gaspra and 243 Ida, and <b>Mars</b> <b>Observer.</b>|$|E
50|$|The <b>Mars</b> <b>Observer</b> {{spacecraft}} had {{a mass of}} 1018 kg, its bus measured 1.1 meters tall, 2.2 meters wide, and 1.6 meters deep. The spacecraft {{was based}} on previous satellite designs, originally intended and developed to orbit Earth. The RCA Satcom Ku-band satellite design was used extensively for the spacecraft bus, propulsion, thermal protection, and solar array. RCA TIROS and DMSP Block 50-2 satellite designs were also utilized in the implementing the Attitude and Articulation Control System (AACS), command and data handling subsystem, and power subsystem, into <b>Mars</b> <b>Observer.</b> Other elements such as the bipropellant components and high-gain antenna were designed specifically for the mission.|$|E
5000|$|Originally named <b>Mars</b> <b>Observer</b> Camera, it was {{selected}} by NASA in 1986 for the <b>Mars</b> <b>Observer</b> mission, but it returned only three images of planet Mars before {{the loss of the}} spacecraft in 1993. A second camera of the same specifications, renamed to Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC), was built (with assistance by California Institute of Technology) and launched on board the Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) spacecraft in 1996. The camera returned 243,668 images while in orbit around Mars, before the loss of the MGS spacecraft in 2006. [...] Mars Orbiter Camera was operated by its manufacturer, Malin Space Science Systems, from its facilities in San Diego, California.|$|E

50|$|While a {{graduate}} student at UCLA, Grazier worked at the RAND Corporation in nearby Santa Monica, processing Viking Mars imagery in support of the <b>Mars</b> <b>Observer</b> Mission. When the spacecraft was lost during orbit insertion, support for the work came to an immediate end.|$|E
50|$|The Observer program, {{starting}} with the <b>Mars</b> <b>Observer,</b> was envisioned {{as a series of}} low-cost missions to the inner Solar System, based on commercial Earth satellites, while the Mariner Mark II was to be a series of large spacecraft for the exploration of the outer Solar System.|$|E

50|$|The Planetary Observer {{program is}} a {{cancelled}} space exploration program designed by NASA to provide cheaper planetary orbiters by using Earth-orbiting satellite components and technology, using solar panels for power, and a common spacecraft bus platform for all Planetary Observer-class probes. Only one spacecraft of this class was eventually constructed—the <b>Mars</b> <b>Observer.</b>|$|E

5000|$|On August 24, 1993, <b>Mars</b> <b>Observer</b> {{would turn}} 180-degrees and ignite the {{bipropellant}} thrusters {{to slow the}} spacecraft, entering into a highly elliptical orbit. Over the next three months, subsequent [...] "transfer to lower orbit" [...] (TLO) maneuvers would be performed as the spacecraft reached periapsis, eventually resulting in an approximately circular, 118-minute orbit around Mars.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Mars</b> <b>Observer</b> spacecraft, {{also known}} as the Mars Geoscience/Climatology Orbiter, was a robotic space probe {{launched}} by NASA on September 25, 1992 to study the Martian surface, atmosphere, climate and magnetic field. During the interplanetary cruise phase, communication with the spacecraft was lost on August 21, 1993, 3 days prior to orbital insertion. Attempts to re-establish communication with the spacecraft were unsuccessful.|$|E
50|$|<b>Mars</b> <b>Observer</b> was {{scheduled}} to perform an orbital insertion maneuver on August 24, 1993. However, contact with the spacecraft was lost on August 21, 1993. Likely reason for spacecraft failure was the leakage of fuel and oxidizer vapors through the improperly designed PTFE check valve to the common pressurization system. During interplanetary cruise, the vapor mix had accumulated in feed lines and pressurant lines, resulting in explosion and their rupture after the engine was restarted for routine course correction. A similar problem would later cripple the Akatsuki space probe in 2010. Although none of the primary objectives were achieved, the mission provided interplanetary cruise phase data, collected up to the date of last contact. This data would be useful for subsequent missions to Mars. Science instruments originally developed for <b>Mars</b> <b>Observer</b> were placed on four subsequent spacecraft to complete the mission objectives: Mars Global Surveyor launched in 1996, Mars Climate Orbiter launched in 1998, 2001 Mars Odyssey launched in 2001 and Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter launched in 2005.|$|E
