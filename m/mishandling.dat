5|$|Dromedary {{slaughter}} is {{more difficult}} than the slaughter of other domestic livestock such as cattle, {{because of the size}} of the animal and the significant manual work involved. More males than females are slaughtered. Though less affected by <b>mishandling</b> than other livestock, the pre-slaughter handling of the dromedary plays a crucial role in determining the quality of meat obtained; <b>mishandling</b> can often disfigure the hump. The animal is stunned, seated in a crouching position with the head in a caudal position and slaughtered. The dressing percentage the percentage of the mass of the animal that forms the carcass is 55–70%, more than the 45–50% of cattle. Camel meat is rarely consumed by African camel herders, who use it only during severe food scarcity or for rituals. Camel meat is processed into food items such as burgers, patties, sausages and shawarma. Dromedaries can be slaughtered between four and ten years of age. As the animal ages, the meat grows tougher and deteriorates in taste and quality.|$|E

5|$|His murder {{became a}} {{national}} cause célèbre. Several independent inquiries concluded that local government officials had been involved. However, the Bantul police early on discounted a political motive. Instead, they arrested a local driver named Dwi Sumaji for the murder, alleging a motive of jealousy. Sumaji was later acquitted after the prosecution withdrew its case owing {{to a lack of}} evidence. The police in turn were successfully sued for their <b>mishandling</b> of the case and deliberate destruction of evidence. The murder has never been solved, and is expected to be unprosecutable after 2014 due to Indonesia's 18-year statute of limitations on murder.|$|E
5|$|The United States {{had issued}} {{commemorative}} coins between 1892 and 1954, {{as a means}} for fundraising for organizations deemed worthy of federal support. A sponsoring organization would be designated in the authorizing legislation, and was permitted to buy up the issue at face value, selling it to the public at a premium, and pocketing the difference. Various problems with the issues, including <b>mishandling</b> of distributions and complaints that public coins should not be used for private profit, resulted in firm Treasury Department opposition to such issues, and none were struck after 1954.|$|E

Nevertheless, Albert is frustrated at his initial powerlessness and Queen Adelaide advises Victoria to allow him to take on more duties. He then reorganises the running of the royal household and dismisses Conroy for <b>mishandling</b> funds. As Victoria's primary adviser, he now blocks the influences of Lord Melbourne and King Leopold. However, Victoria quarrels with him fiercely for going over her head with Peel in the matter of her household.|$|E

5|$|Continuing westward, Inez made {{landfall}} {{as a small}} hurricane on the Barahona Peninsula of the Dominican Republic. There, {{the storm}} flooded many rivers and destroyed over 800houses. Nationwide, there were about 100deaths and $12million in damage. After affecting the country, Inez struck southwestern Haiti, where it was considered the worst hurricane since the 1920s. As many as 1,000people were killed, and 60,000people were left homeless. Damage totaled $20.35million in Haiti, prompting the United States government to send aid {{for the first time}} in nearly ten years due to previous <b>mishandling</b> of funds. Inez weakened quickly over Hispaniola, although it reintensified into a major hurricane before striking southeastern Cuba on September30. In the country, 125,000people were forced to evacuate, and there were three deaths and $20million in damage.|$|E
5|$|In the 2016 Austrian presidential election, Freedom Party {{candidate}} Norbert Hofer won {{the first}} round of the election, receiving 35.1% of the vote, making that election the Freedom Party's best ever election result in its history. However, in the second round, Hofer was defeated by Alexander Van der Bellen, who received the support of 50.3% compared to Hofer's 49.7%. On July first the Constitutional Court of Austria voided the results of the second round due to <b>mishandling</b> of postal votes; although the court did not find evidence of deliberate manipulation. The re-vote took place on 4 December 2016 when Van der Bellen won by a significantly larger margin.|$|E
5|$|National policy {{relating}} to the Cold War interested Flanders greatly. He {{was concerned about the}} world-wide encroachment of Communism even without force of arms. He felt that President Truman was generally a good president, but was hampered by the Roosevelt legacy of appeasing the Soviets. He also felt that Truman's commitment to bringing the Nationalist and Communist Chinese factions together into an alliance was mistaken. He endorsed the Marshall Plan as a way to avoid Communist influence in Western Europe. However, he was critical of John Foster Dulles, Secretary of State, for <b>mishandling</b> opportunities to create friendly alignment with Egypt and India, countries which instead sided with the Soviet Union.|$|E

However, because of limitations to DOTs baggage data, an assessment of baggage delaysa subcategory of <b>mishandled</b> baggagecannot be conducted.

5|$|One of {{the major}} sources of income in the {{territory}} during the 1850s was U.S. government annuity payments to the Ojibwe and other tribes required by earlier treaties. These payments amounted to more than $380,000 per year on average ($ in present-day terms) compared to approximately $120,000 per year ($ in present-day terms) given to the territory itself for development. Because of corruption, and <b>mishandling</b> of the payments to the tribes, {{a great deal of}} the money was used directly by U.S. settlers for commercial and community development with questionable benefit to the tribes. At the beginning of the Minnesota Territory, in fact, these payments were the territory's most important source of income since the fur trade was no longer as lucrative as it had once been and other exports were still negligible.|$|E
5|$|Prime Minister Petr Nečas defended Drobil, {{and called}} Michálek untrustworthy despite his public {{reputation}} as a whistleblower. Since the Civic Democrats vowed to fight corruption, losing its first minister to corruption charges was {{a blow to the}} party's standing. The Drobil incident was the first of several high-profile resignations. On December 21, 2010, Czech Police Chief Oldrich Martinu resigned after Interior Minister Radek John's month-long call for his ouster in part due to the Drobil case's <b>mishandling.</b> Michálek returned to the State Environmental Fund as a financial analyst in 2011. The Drobil case is on indefinite hiatus for a lack of evidence as of September 2012. As of February 2013, the case against Knetig is on a similar hiatus for insufficient evidence.|$|E
5|$|As president, Zardari {{remained}} a strong U.S. {{ally in the}} war in Afghanistan, despite prevalent public disapproval of the United States following the Raymond Davis incident and the Nato attack in Salala in 2011. Domestically, Zardari achieved the passage of the Eighteenth Amendment in 2010, which constitutionally reduced his presidential powers. His attempt to prevent the reinstatement of Supreme Court judges failed in the face of massive protests led by his political rival Nawaz Sharif. The restored Supreme Court dismissed the PPP's elected Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gillani for contempt in 2012, after Gillani refused to write to the Government of Switzerland to reopen corruption cases against Zardari. Zardari's tenure was also criticised for <b>mishandling</b> nationwide floods in 2010, and growing terrorist violence. Following multiple bombings of Hazaras in Quetta in early 2013, Zardari dismissed his provincial government in Balochistan.|$|E

5|$|By then, {{there was}} already a {{movement}} within the Army General Staff to have Matsui removed from his post. Reports of the atrocities in Nanking had reached the Japanese government and some within the Army General Staff blamed Matsui for <b>mishandling</b> the crisis and causing Japan international embarrassment. Some even wanted him court-martialed for negligence. Even so, the Japanese government was not planning on dismissing Matsui solely because of the Nanking Massacre. The Foreign Ministry was displeased by anti-Western statements Matsui had made after becoming CCAA commander, including his comment {{that he did not}} recognize the neutrality of foreign concessions in Shanghai, and the Army General Staff was concerned about Matsui's severe personality conflicts with his subordinate commanders, which were interfering with the chain of command. The Army Minister Hajime Sugiyama told General Shunroku Hata that the inability of Matsui and his subordinates to coordinate and cooperate with one another was the reason he was being removed.|$|E
5|$|Tension between {{central and}} local {{government}} heightened in {{the final years of}} the Soviet Union's existence. On May 5, 1990, the New Armenian Army (NAA), a defense force envisioned to serve as a separate entity from the Soviet Union's military, was created. A celebration was planned for May 28, the anniversary of the creation of the first Armenian republic. However, on May 27 hostilities broke out between the NAA and the MVD troops based in Yerevan, resulting in the deaths of five Armenians in a shootout at the railway station. Witnesses claimed that the MVD had used an excessive amount of force in the firefight and insisted that it had instigated the fighting. Further firefights between Armenian militiamen and the MVD in nearby Sovetashen (now Nubarashen) resulted in the deaths of twenty-seven people and an indefinite cancellation of the May28 celebration. Armenia declared its sovereignty over Soviet laws on August 23, 1990. The reason Armenia's decision to break away from the Soviet Union largely stemmed from Moscow's intransigence on Karabakh, <b>mishandling</b> of the earthquake relief effort, and the shortcomings of the Soviet economy.|$|E
5|$|In 324BC Harpalus, to whom Alexander had {{entrusted}} huge treasures, absconded {{and sought}} refuge in Athens. The Assembly had initially {{refused to accept}} him, following Demosthenes's advice, but finally Harpalus entered Athens. He was imprisoned after a proposal of Demosthenes and Phocion, despite the dissent of Hypereides, an anti-Macedonian statesman and former ally of Demosthenes. Additionally, the ecclesia decided {{to take control of}} Harpalus's money, which was entrusted to a committee presided over by Demosthenes. When the committee counted the treasure, they found they only had half the money Harpalus had declared he possessed. Nevertheless, they decided not to disclose the deficit. When Harpalus escaped, the Areopagus conducted an inquiry and charged Demosthenes with <b>mishandling</b> twenty talents. During the trial, Hypereides argued that Demosthenes did not disclose the huge deficit, because he was bribed by Harpalus. Demosthenes was fined and imprisoned, but he soon escaped.* I. Apostolidis, notes 1219, 1226 & 1229 in J. G. Droysen, History of Alexander the Great, 717–726; K. Tsatsos, Demosthenes, 303–309; D. Whitehead, Hypereides, 359–360; I. Worthington, Harpalus Affair, passim. It remains unclear whether the accusations against him were just or not. In any case, the Athenians soon repealed the sentence.* K.

5|$|In both {{of these}} instances, a failed retreat by Hybrida and his cavalry led to his unit being {{absolutely}} defeated and any plunder accrued during the attack was forfeited back to the natives. This lack of success, rather than the extortion of the provincials, drew {{the attention of the}} Senate who threatened to recall and prosecute Hybrida for his mismanagement of the province. In 60 BC, Hybrida was quietly replaced by Gaius Octavius as the Governor of Macedonia and in March of 59 BC, during the consulship of Caesar and Marcus Culpurnius Bibulus, was prosecuted for the <b>mishandling</b> of the governorship by Caesar and Crassus. In the end, Hybrida was tried by Marcus Caelius Rufus for his participation in the Catilinarian conspiracy and by Lucius Caninius Gallus for his crimes in Macedonia. He was defended by Cicero, not out of duty but as a protest against the current state of affairs in Rome. Despite this, Hybrida was found guilty of his crimes, ordered to pay a fine and be banished from Rome to a place of his choosing. Hybrida had settled upon Cephallenia as his residence for the duration of his exile.|$|E
