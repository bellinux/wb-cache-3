25|$|The River Hull valley {{dominates the}} western {{landscape}} of Holderness. The river {{and its associated}} wetland habitats support a diverse range of plants and animals. The upper tributaries of the river originate {{on the edge of}} the Yorkshire Wolds before entering the area of glacial and alluvial deposits of Holderness. The river bed varies in composition reflecting the underlying geology. In the upper reaches of the river water crowfoot, lesser water parsnip, mares tail and spiked water <b>milfoil</b> may be found in the main channel whilst the marginal vegetation is composed of branched bur-reed, common reed and reed sweetgrass.|$|E
25|$|Whangamarino Wetland {{consists}} of a rich and representative variety of wetland ecosystems (peat bog, swamp, mesotrophic lags, open water and river systems); one of the features that lent support to its designation under the Ramsar Convention. 239 species of wetland plants {{are found in the}} Whangamarino, 60 percent of which are indigenous. A number of these are uncommon or extremely rare, including the water <b>milfoil</b> Myriophyllum robustum, the clubmoss Lycopodium serpentinum, and the critically endangered swamp helmet orchid Anzybas carseii, now found nowhere else in the world. Baumea spp., mānuka (Leptospermum scoparium) and wire rush (Empodisma minus) are the dominant vegetation of the peat bogs while greater species diversity is found in the mineralised swamp zones, including introduced species such as grey willow (Salix cinerea) and crack willow (Salix fragilia). Mosses and lichens are also well represented in the wetland.|$|E
50|$|Paratya is {{distinguished}} {{from all other}} decapod shrimps by the specialized form {{of the first two}} pairs of chelipeds, which possess clusters of brushing setae or small hairs to pick up food. This shrimp feeds mainly by scraping detritus from the leaves of aquatic plants (Elodea spp. and <b>milfoils),</b> sometimes with all four chelipeds, bringing the organic material to the mouthparts where larger particles are shredded by the third pair of maxillipeds. It also eats small invertebrates such as midges.|$|R
50|$|Aquatic moncots and dicots both {{occur in}} Australian waters. Australia has about 51,000 square {{kilometres}} of seagrass meadows {{and the most}} diverse group seagrass species in the world. There are 22 species found in temperate waters and 15 in tropical waters out of a known 70 species worldwide. Aquatic dicots include the mangroves; in Australia there are 39 mangrove species that cover 11,500 square kilometres and comprise the third largest area of mangroves in the world. Other native aquatic dicots here include water lilies and water <b>milfoils.</b>|$|R
50|$|Moderate {{levels of}} algae are commons in late summer, principally golden algae and {{carapace}} algae (Ceratium hirudinella), while zooplankton (such as Rotifer and Copepod) are relatively rare). Aquatic plants are relatively few, the lake floor is mostly covered by Charales such as Chara tomentosa (present {{since the mid}} 19th century), accompanied by bladderwort, <b>milfoils,</b> and others. Along the shores are found Carex pseudocyperus, purple loosestrife, milk parsley, and lesser bulrush. Trees around the lake include black alder and grey willow. Bottom specimens taken in July 1996 mostly unveiled larvae of chironomids, Oligochaeta, and empty shells - typical for lakes rich in nutrients but poor in oxygen. Specimens taken along the shores the same year resulted in reports of mayflies, caddisflies, and dragonflies. Fish population has been decimated by low levels of oxygen and is now reduced to Crucian carp.|$|R

2500|$|Oracle bone script (...) was {{the form}} of Chinese {{characters}} used on oracle bones—animal bones or turtle plastrons used in pyromantic divination—in the late 2nd millennium BCE, and is the earliest-known form of Chinese writing. The vast majority were found at the Yinxu site (in modern Anyang, Henan Province). They record pyromantic divinations of the last nine kings of the Shang dynasty, beginning with Wu Ding, whose accession is dated by different scholars at 1250 BCE or 1200 BCE. After the Shang were overthrown by the Zhou dynasty in c. 1046 BCE, divining with <b>milfoil</b> became more common, and very few oracle bone writings date from the early Zhou.|$|E
50|$|Since roughly 2000, hand-harvesting of {{invasive}} <b>milfoils</b> has shown much {{success as a}} management technique. Several organizations in the New England states have undertaken large scale, lake-wide hand-harvesting management programs with extremely successful results. Acknowledgment {{had to be made}} {{that it is impossible to}} completely eradicate the species once it is established. As a result, maintenance must be done once an infestation has been reduced to affordably controlled levels. Well trained divers with proper techniques have been able to effectively control and then maintain many lakes, especially in the Adirondack Park in Northern New York where chemicals, mechanical harvesters, and other disruptive and largely unsuccessful management techniques are banned. After only three years of hand harvesting in Saranac Lake the program was able to reduce the amount harvested from over 18 tons to just 800 pounds per year.|$|R
40|$|Eurasian watermilfoil is a {{feathery}} submerged {{aquatic plant}} {{that was once}} commonly sold as an aquarium plant. It quickly forms thick, damaging mats that are causing harm in shallow areas of rivers and lakes throughout North America. Species Description Eurasian watermilfoil has small (< 2 cm long) feathery leaves that are arranged in whorls of 3 - 6 (four leaves per whorl is common) around slender stems. The plant grows underwater from roots attached firmly in the sediment. Tiny pink flowers grow on shoots that rise above the water’s surface. In Pennsylvania, these plants usually die back to the roots during the winter. Eurasian watermilfoil may be confused with bladderworts, hornworts, mermaid weeds, and other leafy <b>milfoils.</b> Native & Introduced Ranges Eurasian watermilfoil is native to Europe, Asia, and northern Africa. It was first discovered in the eastern United States in the 1940 s, but may have arrived {{as early as the}} late 1800 s. Since its introduction, it has spread across inland lakes and streams, clinging to boats and waterfowl. The history of its spread in the United States is not well documented because it bears such a close resemblance to native species of watermilfoil; however, it is now known to be established in nearly every U. S. state, and at least three Canadian provinces. In Pennsylvania, Eurasian watermilfoil is common in lakes, ponds, and rivers in all regions of the Commonwealth. Biology & Spread Eurasian watermilfoil does not rely on seeds for reproduction because they germinate poorly under natural conditions. Instead, it reproduces by fragmentation, which is when plant fragments break off and float via water currents, allowing it to disperse long distances. It can also cross land to new waters when these fragments, which can stay alive for weeks if kept moist, hitchhike on boats, boat trailers, motors, and fishing equipment...|$|R

6000|$|Templeton and I were {{lounging}} by {{the clear}} limestone stream which crossed his park and wound away round wooded hills toward the distant Severn. A lovelier fishing morning sportsman never saw. A soft gray under-roof of cloud slid on before a soft west wind, and {{here and there}} a stray gleam of sunlight shot into the vale across the purple mountain-tops, and awoke into busy life the denizens of the water, already quickened by the mysterious electric influences of the last night's thunder-shower. The long-winged cinnamon-flies spun and fluttered over the pools; the sand-bees hummed merrily round their burrows in the marly bank; and delicate iridescent ephemerae rose by hundreds from the depths, and, dropping their shells, floated away, each a tiny Venus Anadyomene, down the glassy ripples of the reaches.

60|$|Here; {{look into}} this opening in the <b>milfoil</b> and {{crowfoot}} bed. Do you see a grey film around that sprig? Examine it through the pocket lens. It is a forest of glass bells, on branching stalks. They are Vorticellae; {{and every one of}} those bells, by the ciliary current on its rim, is scavenging the water--till a tadpole comes by and scavenges it. How many millions of living creatures are there on that one sprig? Look here!--a brown polype, with long waving arms--a gigantic monster, actually a full half-inch long. He is Hydra fusca, most famous, and earliest described (I think by Trembley). Ere we go home I may show you perhaps Hydra viridis, with long pea-green arms; and rosea, most beautiful in form and colour of all the strange family. You see that lump, just where his stalk joins his bell-head? That is a budding baby. Ignorant of the joys and cares of wedlock, he increases by gemmation. See! here is another, with a full-sized young one growing on his back. You may tear it off if you will--he cares not. You may cut him into a dozen pieces, they say, and each one will grow, as a potato does. I suppose, however, that he also sends out of his mouth little free ova--medusoids--call them what you will, swimming by ciliae, which afterwards, unless the water beetles stop them on the way, will settle down as stalked polypes, and in their turn practise some mystery of Owenian parthenogenesis, or Steenstruppian alternation of generations, in which all traditional distinctions of plant and animal, male and female, are laughed to scorn by the magnificent fecundity of the Divine imaginations.|$|E

50|$|In 1998 the Department of Natural Resources, State of Vermont, found 70 {{plants of}} Eurasian <b>milfoil</b> {{growing in the}} Round Pond section of the lake.

Since 1999 the Lake Rescue Association (LRA) has hired scuba divers to look for and remove <b>milfoil</b> plants from Lake Rescue, Round Pond and Lake Pauline. The LRA Board at that time acted quickly to employ divers to hand pull the discovered plants and each following year divers have been employed by the association to survey the lake. From 1999 to 2003 paid divers searched and removed about 100 <b>milfoil</b> plants. Lake Rescue was free of <b>milfoil</b> from 2004 until the last several years.

50|$|The {{best way}} to {{identify}} whorled water <b>milfoil</b> (M. verticillatum) is by looking at its {{two different types of}} leaves. The first type is the submersed leave, which looks feathery and contain about 5 to 14 leaflet pairs per leaf. The whorls along the stem contain about 4 to 5 leaves, which are spaced about 1 cm apart. The other type is known as the emergent leaves. These leaves occur on the emergent spike and are pinnately lobed. From June till September whorled water <b>milfoil</b> produces flowers and fruits above or at the water's surface on erect spikes along the emergent leaves. The emergent leaves are typically two or more times longer than the flowers and fruits. Another way to distinguish whorled water <b>milfoil</b> is to look for turions, winter buds that appear toward the end of its growing season. This <b>milfoil</b> is one of a few that produce turions. This characteristic can also rule out other types of water <b>milfoil</b> that lack turions such as Eurasian water <b>milfoil,</b> parrot feather, hybrid water <b>milfoil,</b> and low water <b>milfoil.</b> The turions of this <b>milfoil</b> look like long yellowish-green club-shaped buds with small stiff leaves attached to the submerged stem. In the spring after dormancy the small, thick, dark green turions expand and grow from the stem. As the plant develops roots and continues to grow, the larger green summer leaves are produced {{at the tip of the}} plant. Turion leaves can be seen at the base of the plant sometimes into July. In fall the turions, with some other plant material, often break away from the majority of the rooted plant and float to new areas. Those fragments can be found washing up along shorelines in late fall. The stems of the whorled water <b>milfoil</b> form into mats from branched and unbranched stems that grow to be 20 to 100 inches long.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Milfoil</b> weevils {{occur in}} natural populations {{in much of}} North America on their native host, Northern watermilfoil (Myriophyllum sibiricum). They often reach {{sufficient}} densities to suppress invasive Eurasian watermilfoil (Myriophyllum spicatum) infestations after a prolonged infestation or artificial augmentation. Studies indicate that for effective control a density of about 1 weevil per two stems of <b>milfoil</b> (0.5 weevils per stem) is necessary [...] There are mixed reviews that fish such as bluegills can reduce weevil populations as research has only been conducted in very limited settings. Augmenting native weevil populations as a biological control is effective {{as long as there}} is a small amount of <b>milfoil</b> to sustain the population. <b>Milfoil</b> weevils are commercially available as a management option for Eurasian water <b>milfoil</b> by a firm based in the United States and Canada[...]|$|E
5000|$|Most whorled water <b>milfoil</b> {{occurs in}} semi-shallow ponds, lakes, marshes, ditches and slow running streams of lowland districts [...] <b>Milfoil</b> thrives {{in areas with}} a light sandy bottom and medium loamy soils.
