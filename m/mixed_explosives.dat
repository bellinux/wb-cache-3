40|$|Homemade {{explosive}} (HME) materials commonly {{take the}} form of binary, ammonium nitrate-based explosives, and are a challenge to detect due to the low volatility of ammonium nitrate, the great variation in fuel sources, and the complex environment in which detection takes place. Vapor detection in the form of detector canines overcomes these and other obstacles, and {{has proven to be a}} highly effective mode of detection. Due to inherent safety precautions associated with working with HMEs, experienced detector canines often lack the frequency of training on HME material necessary to remain proficient. For this reason, the Mixed Odor Delivery Device (MODD) was designed allowing canines to train on the odor of <b>mixed</b> <b>explosives</b> while keeping the HME components separate and unmixed, thus alleviating the safety requirements for handling, storing, and transporting explosives. Experiments across multiple investigative strategies were carried out to evaluate and characterize the vapor distribution in the MODD including computational modeling, analytical testing, and field trials. All testing indicated the MODD accurately provides uniformly mixed HME vapor at detectable levels from separated HME components...|$|E

30|$|Besides sensitivity, the {{selectivity}} of the nanosensor {{was also}} discussed in our study. The {{results showed that}} the sensor had significant responses to TNT, low responses to DNT, and no response to 3 -NT and TNP. The nanosensor showed some level of selectivity to TNT versus other chemical molecules that had similar molecular structures. It might be due to the adjacent methyl and nitro groups of molecular structure of TNT and DNT, which had electron interaction with tryptophan and histidine on peptides [39, 40]. Thus, target molecules could be connected to peptides on nanoCA and then elicit resonance wavelength shifts in detections for TNT and DNT, while 3 -NT and TNP had no conjunction with the peptide and did not generate shifts in spectrum. The more groups in TNT molecules gave rise to higher affinity to peptides and more significant response signals of the sensor. Uniformly, the nanosensor also showed more significant responses to the mixture containing TNT than that without TNT in the detection for <b>mixed</b> <b>explosive</b> targets. Although the sensor had responses to DNT alone, DNT only increased the response of the sensor slightly in detection for mixture containing TNT and DNT. Those results indicated that the nanosensor could detect TNT in mixtures and would not be interfered with other compounds, even some very similar molecules.|$|R
40|$|Nuclear {{quadrupole}} resonance (NQR) {{a highly}} promising new technique for bulk explosives detection: relatively inexpensive, more compact than NMR, but with considerable selectivity. Since the NQR frequency is insensitive to long-range variations in composition, <b>mixing</b> <b>explosives</b> with other materials, {{such as the}} plasticizers in plastic explosives, makes no difference. The NQR signal strength varies linearly {{with the amount of}} explosive, and is independent of its distribution within the volume monitored. NQR spots explosive types in configurations missed by the X-ray imaging method. But if NQR is so good, why it is not used everywhere? Its main limitation is the low signal-to-noise ratio, particularly with the radio-frequency interference that exists in a field environment, NQR polarization being much weaker than that from an external magnetic field. The distinctive signatures are there, but are difficult to extract from the noise. In addition, the high selectivity is partly a disadvantage, as it is hard to build a multichannel system necessary to cover a wide range of target substances. Moreover, substances fully screened by metallic enclosures, etc. are difficult to detect. A workshop was held at St Petersburg in July 2008 in an attempt to solve these problems and make NQR the universal technique for the detection of bombs regardless of type.

40|$|This paper aims at {{analysing}} {{how these}} two periods of Somalia’s recent history influenced {{and laid the}} foundations for rivalries between different factions within the country, which eventually exploded in an excruciating conflict. Firstly, {{the aim of this}} paper is to assess how and why the Italian administration of Somalia was overall a failure, and to which extent it was harmful for the future of the country as a whole. Indeed, the targets that the United Nations demanded Italy to achieve within a decade were out of reach for a newborn country that was still struggling with mending the wounds of the Second World War. Hence, there will be in-depth focus on the structural flaws that characterised the establishment of the Italian administration and it mistakes on a social and political level once operational in the country. Secondly, this thesis will analyse the societal structure of Somalia, which is for the vast majority based on clan divisions (Paolo Tripodi 361). The objective of this section to examine how such divisions played a crucial role in combination with the policies implemented by the colonial and post-colonial administrations, which proved to lack any specific knowledge of the “very complex system of clan families” (Richard Dowden 97).
