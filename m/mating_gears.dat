40|$|Detailed {{studies of}} gear transmissions, such as NVH (Noise Vibration and Harshness) or {{durability}} analyses, require an accurate {{description of the}} contact forces, acting on meshing gear teeth. In order to properly model the contact force between two bodies, an accurate prediction of the contact locations and corresponding penetrations is required, before contact loads can be calculated. This paper proposes a numerically efficient and accurate contact model to calculate the contact locations and penetrations between <b>mating</b> <b>gear</b> flanks by making use of the ease-off concept. The proposed approach exploits the fact that <b>mating</b> <b>gear</b> flanks {{are designed to be}} close-to-conjugate and can account for possible micro-modifications and relative motion between the meshing gear flanks. Furthermore, this paper proposes an extension to the ease-off based contact modeling which enables accounting for misalignments without the need to recalculate the ease-off topography for each new misaligned configuration. In a preprocessing step to the actual contact detection algorithm, the surface of roll angles and ease-off topography for a given gear pair under a given kinematic configuration are calculated, starting from a cloud-of-point representation of the different gears. The use of a cloud-of-point representation, combined with the knowledge of the surface normal vectors, allows for the analysis of different types of gears, without the need of a detailed knowledge of the manufacturing process. Therefore, the created algorithm can account for different gear geometries, ranging from cylindrical gears to bevel and hypoid gears. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|Standard 20 Â° {{spur gears}} are {{typically}} generated {{with a whole}} depth of 2. 2 â 2. 25 times the module. At the nominal centre distance, this leaves a radial clearance, which is in itself redundant from a functional point of view. However, the intrinsic geometry of the cutting process always results in a non-involute root profile (the trochoid), which is even more pronounced {{in the case of}} using a rounded cutter tip in order to increase the strength of the cutting edge. Larger tip radii produce stronger tooth fillets, potentially increasing the bending strength, but reducing the involute part of the tooth. Thereby, they increase the risk of interference with <b>mating</b> <b>gears.</b> This paper performs a parametric investigation of the combined effect of the cutter radius and the dedendum on the clearance and the resulting tooth bending strength using analytical calculations, computerised generation and finite element simulations to determine the exact tooth geometry in search of stronger tooth forms.

40|$|In this dissertation, {{the concept}} of {{transmission}} lines for topological synthesis of articulated gear mechanisms is introduced. It is shown that the structure matrix, which related input displacements to the joint angles of a multi-degree-of- freedom articulated gear mechanisms, can be derived using {{the concept of}} transmission lines. Applying {{the characteristics of the}} structure matrix, a new methodology for the topological synthesis of articulated gear mechanisms has been established. All the basic admissible structure matrices of conventional, three-DOF (degree-of-freedom), geared robotic mechanisms have been enumerated. Furthermore, an innovative concept for the control of gear backlash in robotic mechanisms has been conceived. The concept utilizes redundant unidirectional drives to assure positive coupling of gear meshes at all time. It is shown that, through proper arrangement of gear trains, backlash of an N-DOF robotic mechanism can be completely eliminated by a minimum of (N + 1) unidirectional drives. A methodology for the enumeration of admissible RBR (Redundant-drive Backlash-free Robotic) mechanisms has been established. This class of mechanisms also has the fail-safe advantage in that, unless there is loss of backlash control, the mechanisms can continue to function whenever any one of its actuators fails. The actuator sizing has been studied for a general class of N-DOF RBR mechanisms. The actuator torques are given in term of either the joint torques or the end-effector dynamical performance requirement. The methodology for the determination of actuator size can also be applied to tendon-driven robotic mechanisms. Frictional forces in gear-coupled robotic mechanisms can have significant effect on the manipulator dynamics and control and are therefore also included in this study. Gearing efficiency for various gear drives, e. g., two <b>mating</b> <b>gears,</b> N <b>mating</b> <b>gears</b> with a common carrier, and gear trains, has been investigated.

An experiment using a laser tracking system to verify the improvement of repeatability was conducted. In order to compare the performance difference, two control algorithms, one with redundant drives and the other without, were used in this experiment.

Based on {{spiral bevel}} gear NC {{manufacture}} principle and generating motion of the generating gear and the work gear, the NC generation of {{spiral bevel gear}} cutting is realized {{by means of the}} vector transformation. As sophisticated calculation of the transformation is hard to implement in each interpolation cycle of NC machining, the coordinated motion of NC coordinate axes is expressed as quintic parametric spline functions, which use the rotation angle of the work gear as the parameter.

40|$|Gearing {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{effective}} methods for transmitting power and rotary motion from the source to its application with or without change of speed or direction. The bending and surface strength of the gear tooth are considered to be one of the main contributors for the failure of the gear in a gear set. Thus, determination of stresses has become popular as an area of research on gears to minimize or to reduce the failures and for optimal design of gears. This thesis investigates the characteristics of an involute helical gear system mainly focused on bending and contact stresses using analytical and finite element analysis. To estimate the bending stress, three-dimensional solid models for different number of teeth are generated by Pro/Engineer that is a powerful and modern solid modeling software and the numerical solution is done by ANSYS, which is a finite element analysis package. The analytical investigation is based on Lewis stress formula. This thesis also considers the study of contact stresses induced between two gears.
