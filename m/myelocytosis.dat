40|$|Erythrokeratodermias are a {{clinically}} heterogeneous {{group of}} rare autosomal dominant disorders of cornification with overlapping features including hyperkeratosis and erythema. We ascertained five extended pedigrees with different phenotypes for a linkage study. Three families presented with localized erythrokeratodermia variabilis, {{and one with}} erythrokeratodermia and ataxia. Another family had Greither disease associated with variable hyperkeratotic plaques. Despite their phenotypic differences, both erythrokeratodermia variabilis and erythrokeratodermia with ataxia map to a common region in 1 p 34 -p 35. Multipoint linkage and haplotype analyses place erythrokeratodermia variabilis between the marker D 1 S 496 and D 1 S 186 with a maximum LOD score of 12. 88. Our linkage results provide compelling evidence for genetic homogeneity among families of mixed European and French-Canadian origin. In contrast, results excluded Greither's disease from the established erythrokeratodermia variabilis gene region indicating genetic heterogeneity of erythrokeratodermias. Based on recombinations, two genes assigned to 1 p 34 -p 35 were excluded: cartilage matrix protein and avian <b>myelocytosis</b> viral oncogene. Connexin- 37 (GJA 4), {{a member of the}} connexin gene family, maps within the erythrokeratodermia variabilis region and is an attractive candidate gene. Direct sequencing of the coding region of GJA 4 in four patients revealed several variations, including a novel polymorphism within the 5 ' cytoplasmic domain, but no pathogenic mutations were found, thus excluding Connexin- 37 as a candidate. There is evidence, however, that other epidermally expressed connexins cluster in this region, and one may yet be determined {{to play a role in}} the pathogenesis of erythrokeratodermia variabilis...|$|E
