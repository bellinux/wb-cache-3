50|$|The powder used in laser {{cladding}} is normally of a metallic nature, and is {{injected into the}} system by either coaxial or lateral nozzles. The interaction of the metallic powder stream and the laser causes melting to occur, and {{is known as the}} <b>melt</b> <b>pool.</b> This is deposited onto a substrate; moving the substrate allows the <b>melt</b> <b>pool</b> to solidify and thus produces a track of solid metal. This is the most common technique, however some processes involve moving the laser/nozzle assembly over a stationary substrate to produce solidified tracks. The motion of the substrate is guided by a CAD system which interpolates solid objects into a set of tracks, thus producing the desired part {{at the end of the}} trajectory.|$|E

30|$|A {{fundamental}} paradox {{exists in}} employing target property differences {{to explain the}} observed crater density differences between <b>melt</b> <b>pools</b> and normal ejecta. Plescia and Spudis (2014) believed that the irregularly shaped small craters on the <b>melt</b> <b>pools</b> are self-secondaries that were formed on the still-molten <b>melt</b> <b>pools.</b> However, the target property difference scenario regarded <b>melt</b> <b>pools</b> as competent rocks that have much larger cohesion and smaller porosity than normal ejecta (Williams and Pathare 2015; van der Bogert et al. 2017). Nevertheless, even assuming that craters formed on <b>melt</b> <b>pools</b> are 2 times smaller than those on normal ejecta deposits assuming same impactors, the large crater density difference still exists (Xiao 2016; Zanetti et al. 2017).|$|R

Three zones were distinguished across the <b>melting</b> <b>pool</b> of the SLM-processed FVS 0812 alloy: the laser melted zone (LMZ), the <b>melting</b> <b>pool</b> border, and the heat affected zone (HAZ) in the previously deposited area around the <b>melting</b> <b>pool.</b> Inside the LMZ, either an extremely fine cellular-dendritic structure or a mixture zone of the α-Al matrix and nanoscale Al 12 (Fe,V) 3 Si particles appeared. With a decreased laser beam scanning speed, the cellular-dendritic structure zone within the LMZ shrank significantly while the mixture zone expanded. The α-Al and Al 12 (Fe,V) 3 Si mixture zone was also observed in the HAZ, but another phase, submicron θ-Al 13 Fe 4 particles with rectangular or hexagonal shapes, formed along the <b>melting</b> <b>pool</b> border. Microhardness tests indicated that the hardness of the SLM-processed FVS 0812 samples far exceeded that of the as-cast FVS 0812 alloy...|$|R
30|$|Self-secondaries {{formed on}} normal ejecta {{deposits}} have been unambiguously confirmed, but their occurrence on different-sized <b>melt</b> <b>pools</b> {{needs to be}} confirmed. The morphology and geometry of many small craters on the <b>melt</b> <b>pools</b> of Tycho are consistent with being self-secondaries, but this hypothesis needs to be tested by comparing the possible trajectory time of spall fragments, the movement time of melt flows considering the initial outward momentum, and the cooling time of <b>melt</b> <b>pools</b> (Xiao et al. 2016). The occurrence and possible dominance of self-secondaries on <b>melt</b> <b>pools</b> would reveal the emplacement sequence of self-secondaries {{in the frame of}} the formation of continuous ejecta deposits. On the other hand, it has been frequently quoted that self-secondaries that are located at larger distances from the parent crater rim have larger crater densities (Zanetti et al. 2015, 2017). This possible trend is established after studying the whole crater populations on the continuous ejecta deposits of Tycho and Aristarchus. However, {{it should be noted that}} continuous ejecta deposits of complex craters are composed of different ejecta facies, as impact melt flows that postdate the modification stage have altered the local density of self-secondaries to different degrees (e.g., Fig.  3). Therefore, it is necessary to evaluate the local geological context before interpreting the observed crater density differences.|$|R
50|$|Laser {{engineered}} net shaping (LENS) is an {{additive manufacturing}} technique for rapidly fabricating, enhancing and repairing metal components directly from CAD data. The processes use a high power {{solid state laser}} focused onto a metal substrate to create a ~1 mm diameter <b>melt</b> <b>pool.</b> Metal powder is then injected into the <b>melt</b> <b>pool</b> to increase the material volume and build up the component layer by layer. Experimental gas thrusters (build time 8 hours) and automotive brackets have been manufactured in Ti-Grade 5. Selective Laser Sintering (SLS) is similar, except that the laser selectively fuses powdered material by scanning {{on the surface of}} a powder bed. After each cross-section is scanned, the powder bed is lowered by one layer thickness, a new layer of material is applied on top, and the process is repeated until the part is completed.|$|E
50|$|Scarab Bluff is a bluff {{north of}} Giza Peak {{overlooking}} Fossil Bluff hut {{on the east}} coast of Alexander Island, Antarctica.

50|$|The {{temperature}} of the resulting electric arc is very high (tens of thousands of degrees), causing the metal on the contact surfaces to <b>melt,</b> <b>pool</b> and migrate with the current. The high {{temperature of}} the arc cracks the surrounding gas molecules creating ozone, carbon monoxide, and other compounds. The arc energy slowly destroys the contact metal, causing some material to escape into the air as fine particulate matter. This very activity causes the material in the contacts to degrade quickly, resulting in device failure.|$|E

30|$|Small craters on the <b>melt</b> <b>pools</b> {{of impact}} craters such as Giordano Bruno, Tycho, and King have {{different}} morphology with both primaries and typical secondaries (Plescia 2015), {{as they are}} much shallower, with irregularly shaped rims and small central mounds, and absence of well-developed ejecta (e.g., Fig.  4 b). On the contrary, craters that are formed on the normal ejecta deposits do not have such morphological characteristics (e.g., Fig.  3 b). The irregularly shaped craters formed on Tycho’s <b>melt</b> <b>pools</b> have much smaller depth–diameter ratios (~[*] 0.06) than those formed on the normal ejecta deposits (~[*] 0.12), and their interior wall slopes are also much shallower (~[*] 9 ° versus 21 ° on average; Plescia 2015). Plescia and Spudis (2014) interpreted these craters as self-secondaries (termed as palimpsests) that were formed after the emplacement, but before the solidification of the impact melt. This interpretation is supported by laboratory impact experiments into viscos targets (e.g., Bingham fluids such as cone mush), as the simulated craters have shallow depths, low rims, concentric rings, lobate margins, and central highs (Fink et al. 1981; Greely et al. 1980). It {{is also consistent with}} the fact that impact <b>melt</b> <b>pools</b> can have large solidification time {{for tens of thousands of}} years (e.g., Plescia and Spudis 2014). Therefore, it is likely that self-secondaries have been continuously accumulating on the continuous ejecta deposits, even after the <b>melt</b> <b>pools</b> have been ponded.|$|R
30|$|Subsequent to {{the near}} {{simultaneous}} formation of self-secondaries, primaries and possible background secondaries accumulate on the continuous ejecta deposits, enlarging the crater density. After certain time, the low density of self-secondaries would not {{contribute significantly to}} the local crater population, so {{that the effect of}} self-secondaries will gradually diminish with time (Xiao et al. 2016). However, the transition time for the relative abundance of self-secondaries and younger crater populations has not been revealed yet. This problem is especially important for <b>melt</b> <b>pools,</b> because they are regarded to be less affected by self-secondaries. The transition time is intertwined with crater degradation, since saturation equilibrium is approached from small crater diameters. It has been suggested that populations of small craters on the normal ejecta deposits of Tycho, which are dominated by self-secondaries have achieved the equilibrium state at D[*]<[*]~ 15  m in diameter, but crater populations on the <b>melt</b> <b>pools</b> of Tycho have not been in equilibrium at D[*]≥[*] 5  m (Shoemaker et al. 1969; Xiao 2016). Likewise, crater populations on the impact <b>melt</b> <b>pools</b> of the King crater is in equilibrium at D[*]≤[*] 40 – 50  m (Ashley et al. 2012), those on surfaces[*]~[*] 220 Myr old are in equilibrium at D[*]≤[*] 20  m (Hiesinger et al. 2012), and those on <b>melt</b> <b>pools</b> of the Copernicus crater are in equilibrium at D[*]≤[*]~ 100  m (Xiao and Werner 2015). Therefore, both the gradual accumulation of younger crater populations and crater degradation should be considered when studying the evolution of crater populations on continuous ejecta deposits.|$|R

However, whilst these processes were able to improve stability, reproducibility, and accuracy of welding, they share a common limitation - the energy does not fully penetrate the material to be welded, resulting in the formation of a <b>melt</b> <b>pool</b> {{on the surface of the}} material.|$|E
50|$|A {{short circuit}} {{may lead to}} {{formation}} of an electric arc. The arc, a channel of hot ionized plasma, is highly conductive and can persist even after significant amounts of original material from the conductors has evaporated. Surface erosion is a typical sign of electric arc damage. Even short arcs can remove significant amounts of material from the electrodes. The temperature of the resulting electrical arc is very high (tens of thousands of degrees Fahrenheit), causing the metal on the contact surfaces to <b>melt,</b> <b>pool</b> and migrate with the current, {{as well as to}} escape into the air as fine particulate matter.|$|E
50|$|A {{high power}} laser is used to melt metal powder {{supplied}} coaxially to {{the focus of the}} laser beam through a deposition head.

In the Atlantic influenced area gammaproteobacteria were found dominating while in the Pacific influenced area betaproteobacteria or alphaproteobacteria were abundant.

The coating was examined using XRD, SEM and EDS. A good metal matrix composite coating was obtained in a proper laser process. There is a metallurgical interface bonding between the coating and the substrate. During laser melting-solidifying process, high energy of laser melted the pre-placed powders {{and a part of}} Ti- 6 Al- 4 V substrate, which made Ti extend into a <b>melting</b> <b>pool.</b> A reaction between Ti and B 4 C took place in the <b>melting</b> <b>pool,</b> which in-situ synthesized TiB 2 and TiC reinforcements in the coating.

50|$|A {{great deal}} of {{research}} is now being concentrated on developing automatic laser cladding machines. Many of the process parameters must be manually set, such as laser power, laser focal point, substrate velocity, powder injection rate, etc., and thus require {{the attention of a}} specialized technician to ensure proper results. However, many groups are focusing their attention on developing sensors to measure the process online. Such sensors monitor the clad's geometry (height and width of deposited track), metallurgical properties (such as the rate of solidification, and hence the final microstructure), and temperature information of both the immediate <b>melt</b> <b>pool</b> and its surrounding areas. With such sensors, control strategies are being designed such that constant observation from a technician is no longer required to produce a final product. Further research has been directed to forward processing where system parameters are developed around specific metallurgical properties for user defined applications (such as microstructure, internal stresses, dilution zone gradients, and clad contact angle).|$|E
50|$|In powder-fed directed-energy deposition, a {{high-power}} laser {{is used to}} melt {{metal powder}} supplied to {{the focus of the}} laser beam. The laser beam typically travels {{through the center of the}} deposition head and is focused to a small spot by one or more lenses. The build occurs on a X-Y table which is driven by a tool path created from a digital model to fabricate an object layer by layer. The deposition head is moved up vertically as each layer is completed. Metal powder is delivered and distributed around the circumference of the head or can be split by an internal manifold and delivered through nozzles arranged in various configurations around the deposition head. A hermetically sealed chamber filled with inert gas or a local inert shroud gas is often used to shield the <b>melt</b> <b>pool</b> from atmospheric oxygen for better control of material properties. The powder fed directed energy process is similar to Selective Laser Sintering, but the metal powder is applied only where material is being added to the part at that moment. The process supports a wide range of materials including titanium, stainless steel, aluminum, and other specialty materials as well as composites and functionally graded material. The process can not only fully build new metal parts but can also add material to existing parts for example for coatings, repair, and hybrid manufacturing applications. LENS (Laser Engineered Net Shaping), which was developed by Sandia National Labs, is one example of the Powder Fed - Directed Energy Deposition process for 3D printing or restoring metal parts.|$|E
5000|$|Without {{adequate}} contact protection, {{the occurrence}} of electric current arcing causes significant degradation of the contacts, which suffer significant and visible damage. Every time a relay transitions either from a closed to an open state (break arc) or from an open to a closed state (make arc & bounce arc), under load, an electrical arc can occur between the two contact points (electrodes) of the relay. In many situations, the break arc is more energetic and thus more destructive, in particular with resistive-type loads. However, inductive loads can cause more destructive make arcs. For example, with standard electric motors, the start-up (inrush) current tends to be {{much greater than the}} running current. This translates into enormous make arcs. [...] During an arc event, the heat energy contained in the electrical arc is very high (tens of thousands of degrees Fahrenheit), causing the metal on the contact surfaces to <b>melt,</b> <b>pool</b> and migrate with the current. The extremely high temperature of the arc cracks the surrounding gas molecules creating ozone, carbon monoxide, and other compounds. The arc energy slowly destroys the contact metal, causing some material to escape into the air as fine particulate matter. This action causes the material in the contacts to degrade quickly, resulting in device failure. This contact degradation drastically limits the overall life of a relay to a range of about 10,000 to 100,000 operations, a level far below the mechanical life of the same device, which can be in excess of 20 million operations.|$|E

The analysis {{results show that the}} maximum temperature at the <b>melting</b> <b>pool</b> during cladding is directly proportional to the laser power and preheated temperature.

Contemporaneous with the return of the self-secondaries scenario (Plescia et al. 2010), the long-ignored but poorly understood effect of target properties on the SFD of small impact craters were interpreted to be the cause for the larger crater density on normal ejecta deposits than <b>melt</b> <b>pools</b> (e.g., van der Bogert et al. 2010). According to this interpretation, different target properties (e.g., density, cohesion, porosity) can cause up to 2 times differences in crater rim-to-rim diameters for same-energy impactors, so that small craters formed on <b>melt</b> <b>pools</b> and normal ejecta deposits have both different SFD and densities (van der Bogert et al. 2017).|$|R

One such application of natural products is {{use as an}} active ingredient in commercial sunscreens. Ultra-violet (UV) radiation exposure {{can result in a}} range of harmful side effects from a minor burn to the induction of melanoma. Due to the hazards associated with UV exposure, {{there is a need for}} safe and effective natural sunscreens. Microbes are known to produce structurally diverse natural products with greatly varied functions. One potential role of microbial natural products is to act as UV protectants for the producing organism. For this thesis we wanted to describe the cultivable microbial community of sea ice <b>melt</b> <b>pools</b> to determine if microbes in this habitat are resistant to UVB radiation, and if their mechanism of resistance was via the production of UV protectants. Thus, microbes living in high UV intense habitats are of interest for this thesis. One such habitat is sea ice <b>melt</b> <b>pools</b> in Canada’s Arctic. During the early summer months the sea ice begins to <b>melt</b> forming <b>melt</b> <b>pools.</b> Due to the constant sun exposure, coupled with the reflective property of the ice, microbes present in these pools endure extreme levels of UV radiation. Microorganisms have three mechanisms in which they can survive exposure to UV radiation. They can produce spores, have DNA repair mechanisms, or they can produce UV-absorbing metabolites. With this knowledge it was hypothesized that microbes living in these <b>melt</b> <b>pools</b> would be resistant to UV radiation via the production of UV-absorbing metabolites. Water samples were collected from sea ice <b>melt</b> <b>pools</b> in Nunavut and the cultivable microbial community was identified via sequencing of the 16 S rRNA gene (bacteria) and the ITS/ 28 S rRNA genes (fungi). Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the microbes belonged to 26 different species. Of these 26 species two of the organisms, Frigidiomyces aurantiacum and Polaromyces triangulaformis, were discovered in this study and were described during the course of the research. Each of the 26 organism’s temperature growth range, nutrient requirements, ability to survive a freeze thaw cycle, and resistance to UVB radiation were determined. Post exposure to UVB radiation, compounds produced by each organism was extracted to determine if UV-absorbing metabolites were being produced. The crude extracts were then analyzed using HPLCHRMS. Of the 26 organisms, seven were true psychrophiles, 17 could survive with minimal nutrients, all of the organisms tested remained viable after a single freeze-thaw cycle, and 20 were resistant to exposure to UVB radiation. HPLC-HRMS analysis of the crude extracts revealed that four strains produced mycosporines or mycosporine-like amino acids. One bacterium, Rhodococcus sp.

The developing pool is at first axisymmetric {{as are the}} boundary conditions, but flow instabilities arise that lead to 3 D oscillatory flow patterns. At higher laser powers a sign-change in the surface tension temperature coefficient occurs, resulting in a flow reversal in the pool and thus two counter-rotating vortices, which exhibit similar though more complex flow instabilities.

The {{hard particles}} are injected into the <b>melting</b> <b>pool</b> in rofm of a power gas stream which is delivered from a pneumatic powder feeding system. The processing results (dispersed geometry, Microstructure, hardness distribution) are discussed {{as a function of}} different processing parameters (Laser power, beam geometry, feed rate and powder feeding rate) ...|$|R
40|$|Surface {{cladding}} utilizes a {{high energy}} input to deposit a layer on substrate surfaces providing protection against wear and corrosion. In this work, TiC particulates were incorporated by melting single tracks in powder preplaced onto AISI 4340 {{low alloy steel}} surfaces using a Tungsten Inert Gas (TIG) torch {{with a range of}} processing conditions. The effects of energy input and powder content on the melt geometry, microstructure and hardness were investigated. The highest energy input (1680 J/mm) under the TIG torch produced deeper (1. 0 mm) and wider <b>melt</b> <b>pools,</b> associated with increased dilution, compared to that processed at the lowest energy (1008 J/mm). The melt microstructure contained partially melted TiC particulates associated with dendritic, cubic and globular type carbides precipitated upon solidification of TiC dissolved in the melt; TiC accumulated more near to the melt-matrix interface and at the track edges. Addition of 0. 4, 0. 5 and 1. 0 mg/mm 2 TiC gave hardness values in the resolidified <b>melt</b> <b>pools</b> between 750 to over 1100 Hv, against a base hardness of 300 Hv; hardness values are higher in tracks processed with a grcater TiC addition and reduced energy input...|$|R
