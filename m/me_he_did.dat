500|$|In {{later years}} I {{learned that he}} had always liked me and thought I was worth educating, {{and for that reason}} he made an effort on this trip to get to know <b>me.</b> <b>He</b> <b>did</b> it cleverly. He knew that I was bewildered by some of the things {{expected}} of me as a candidate's wife ... Largely because of Louis' early interpretation of the standards and ethics of the newspaper business, I came to look with interest and confidence on the writing fraternity ... I did receive an intensive education on this trip, and Louis Howe played a great part in this education from that time on.|$|E
2500|$|There {{were also}} {{concerns}} regarding the project's potentially high budget. Lucas and Kurtz, in pitching the film, {{said that it}} would be [...] "low-budget, Roger Corman style, and the budget {{was never going to be}} more than—well, originally we had proposed about 8 million, it ended up being about 10. Both of those figures are very low budget by Hollywood standards at the time." [...] After Walt Disney Productions, who later bought Lucasfilm in December 2012, rejected the project, Lucas and Kurtz persisted in securing a studio to support the film because [...] "other people had read it and said, 'Yeah, it could be a good idea... Lucas pursued Alan Ladd, Jr., the head of 20th Century Fox, and in June 1973 completed a deal to write and direct the film. Although Ladd did not grasp the technical side of the project, he believed that Lucas was talented. Lucas later stated that Ladd [...] "invested in <b>me,</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> not invest in the movie." [...] The deal gave Lucas $150,000 to write and direct the film.|$|E

6000|$|... "I don't {{know that}} I have a leader. Mr. Mildmay leads our side; {{and if anybody}} leads <b>me,</b> <b>he</b> <b>does.</b> But I have great faith in Mr. Monk." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But {{what will}} my father think has become of <b>me?</b> <b>He</b> <b>does</b> not {{know in the}} least where I am--he thinks I only went into the garden for a few minutes." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have been}} reading the 'Remains' of Kirke White, and find that you [...] have to answer for {{misleading}} <b>me.</b> <b>He</b> <b>does</b> not, in my opinion, merit [...] the high praise you have bestowed upon him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But {{what was}} the cause of the quarrel? Why should the Duc de Chateaurouge fix a dispute, as you tell <b>me</b> <b>he</b> <b>did,</b> upon this officer of yours?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Come," [...] said she, [...] "I {{will tell}} you something, in return for what you have told <b>me.</b> <b>He</b> <b>did</b> speak yesterday--that is, he wrote, and was refused." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{was sure}} of it," [...] he groaned. [...] "The fellow is {{returning}} to make himself a nuisance to <b>me.</b> <b>He</b> <b>did</b> not tell you his story, then, Mr. Thain?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... (5) When my tailor {{calls with}} his little bill, and I remind Froggy of that £10 <b>he</b> owes <b>me,</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> not grin like a hyæna; [...] pg189 (6) When it is very hot, the {{thermometer}} is high; ...|$|R
6000|$|... "This {{has decided}} me," [...] he said. [...] "I'll have no half-measures. Until <b>he</b> can show <b>me</b> <b>he's</b> <b>done</b> with that woman, until he can prove he's given up this betting, until--until the heaven's fallen, I'll {{have no more}} to do with him!" ...|$|R
6000|$|It {{was a week}} or {{two later}} that the parlour-maid gave notice, having been terrified almost to tears by an {{outbreak}} of sudden temper {{on the part of the}} master anent some underdone cutlets. [...] "'E gnashed 'is teeth at <b>me,</b> <b>'e</b> <b>did</b> reely," [...] she informed a sympathetic kitchen audience.|$|R
60|$|Something {{about this}} boy was {{worrying}} <b>me.</b> <b>He</b> <b>did</b> {{not seem like}} a real farmer's boy. But then nothing seemed quite real this morning. My feeling was to let things go.|$|E
60|$|The {{young man}} from Whiteley's stood beside <b>me.</b> <b>He</b> <b>did</b> not look happy. His {{forehead}} was damp. Somebody seemed to have stepped on his hat, and his coat was smeared with mould.|$|E
6000|$|... "He was drunk," [...] she said. I {{stared at}} her in frightened wonderment. [...] "He was drunk--it is better than if he had cursed <b>me.</b> <b>He</b> <b>did</b> not mention me? Or any one?" ...|$|E
2500|$|... "It's a real {{shame that}} he just couldn't get it {{together}} when the selectors were sitting down," [...] Border said. [...] "To <b>me</b> <b>he's</b> <b>done</b> a fantastic job for us... It was a difficult one, wasn't it? His form was ordinary and we weren't exactly sure {{how he was going}} to come up bowling." ...|$|R
60|$|LARRY [glancing at Nora]. He {{will take}} more than that from <b>me</b> before <b>he's</b> <b>done</b> here.|$|R
6000|$|... "That <b>he</b> half doubts <b>me,</b> and is half {{afraid of}} <b>me.</b> <b>He</b> <b>does</b> not think as <b>he</b> used to <b>do,</b> that I am altogether, heart and soul, on his side. I {{can see it}} in his eye as <b>he</b> watches <b>me.</b> <b>He</b> thinks that I am tired of him,--tired of his sufferings, tired of his poverty, tired of the evil which men say of him. I am not sure but what he thinks that I suspect him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{understand}} you," [...] she answered. [...] "On {{the night}} when Amelius met with <b>me,</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> wrong to take me away with him. He ought to have left me where I was." ...|$|E
60|$|But if {{you tell}} <b>me,</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> not feel my silence. However, he must have done so; and my guilt is {{irreparable}} now. I thank God at least heartily {{that he did not}} resent it.|$|E
6000|$|... "I think so. He always scolded <b>me.</b> <b>He</b> <b>did</b> {{not like}} me. I {{used to think}} that I would go away and leave him. I wish that I had never come to Llanfeare. I do;--I do." ...|$|E
60|$|Jeeves came {{in looking}} {{as fresh as}} a dewy violet. It's a mystery to <b>me</b> how <b>he</b> <b>does</b> it.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Yes,' said Wilmet abstractedly, 'his {{father told}} <b>me</b> <b>he</b> had--what <b>did</b> <b>he</b> call it?--"a fair {{independent}} competence of his own." [...] Oh! {{they are so}} kind!' ...|$|R
60|$|The {{girls were}} flushed and embarrassed at {{greeting}} <b>me,</b> while <b>he</b> <b>did</b> {{not make it}} any the easier for them.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Yes,' says she, 'he {{loved to}} see me do it, and often told <b>me</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> so; and told me, {{that if he were}} dead, he {{believed}} I might carry on the trade as well as he.' ...|$|E
6000|$|Hunsden {{examined}} <b>me.</b> <b>He</b> <b>did</b> not SAY he was surprised, but {{surprised he}} was; {{he had his}} own notions of good breeding. I saw he suspected I was going to take some very rash step; but repressing declamation or remonstrance, he only answered-- ...|$|E
6000|$|It {{was with}} these cruel words that Gavin {{addressed}} <b>me.</b> <b>He</b> <b>did</b> {{not know how}} cruel they were. The Egyptian, I think, must have seen that his suspicions hurt me, for she said, softly, {{with a look of}} appeal in her eyes-- ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, I hate him!" [...] {{repeated}} Hester more bitterly than before. [...] "He betrayed <b>me!</b> <b>He</b> has <b>done</b> <b>me</b> worse wrong than I did him!" ...|$|R
60|$|ROSE. I suppose so, else <b>he</b> wouldn't treat <b>me</b> as <b>he's</b> <b>done.</b> <b>He's</b> after that--that--He didn't {{ought to}} treat me as if I was dead.|$|R
60|$|I had {{but little}} {{difficulty}} {{in finding the}} officer who had sent for <b>me,</b> and <b>he</b> <b>did</b> not keep <b>me</b> in suspense many minutes.|$|R
60|$|And {{here the}} {{conversation}} ended, for Pie-Face Jones, waking crustily from stolen slumber, threatened Morrell and Oppenheimer {{with a report}} next morning that would mean the jacket for them. <b>Me</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> not threaten, for he knew I was doomed for the jacket anyway.|$|E
6000|$|I {{could get}} no further; Major Fitz-David {{deliberately}} stopped <b>me.</b> <b>He</b> <b>did</b> {{it with the}} smoothest politeness, on the surface. But I saw a look in his bright little eyes which said, plainly, [...] "If you will venture on delicate ground, madam, don't ask me to accompany you." ...|$|E
60|$|Doubtless my manner {{showed that}} he was no welcome visitor, but still he lingered. At last my {{housekeeper}} brought me in my afternoon cup of tea and I was compelled to ask him to join <b>me.</b> <b>He</b> <b>did</b> so, drank it thoughtfully, and immediately afterwards rose to go.|$|E
6000|$|But no matter. Nothing {{would have}} come of it, for <b>he</b> <b>does</b> not care for flowers. He called them rubbish, and cannot tell one from another, and thinks it is {{superior}} to feel like that. <b>He</b> <b>does</b> not care for <b>me,</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> not care for flowers, <b>he</b> <b>does</b> not care for the painted sky at eventide--is there anything <b>he</b> <b>does</b> care for, except building shacks to coop himself up in from the good clean rain, and thumping the melons, and sampling the grapes, and fingering the fruit on the trees, to see how those properties are coming along? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It is Mr. Rowan. I did {{walk with}} him along the churchyard path when that {{woman with her}} sharp squinting eyes saw <b>me.</b> <b>He</b> <b>does</b> belong to the brewery. He is related {{in some way to}} the Tappitts, and was a nephew of old Mrs. Bungall's. He is there as a clerk, and they say he is to be a partner,--only I don't think he ever will, for he quarrels with Mr. Tappitt." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He says to <b>me,</b> as <b>he</b> <b>did</b> to you, {{that the}} law must take its course, and will not even do {{anything}} to prevent Bill's arrest." ...|$|R
