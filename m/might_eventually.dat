5|$|Another Royal Cédula of Charles II, {{with two}} others from Philip V, his successor, {{resulted}} in 1733 {{in the creation}} of the Faculties of Civil and Canon Laws. At the same time, the Holy See granted the university faculties to give academic degrees in those two disciplines and in others that <b>might</b> <b>eventually</b> be established.|$|E
5|$|A {{few days}} after the war began, the Chartered Company formed the Rhodesian Reserves, an {{amorphous}} entity intended to accommodate the many white men who were keen to put on uniform, as well as to make a start towards organising what <b>might</b> <b>eventually</b> become an expeditionary force. Eminent citizens and elected leaders formed their own platoons, each bringing 24 volunteers; three or four of these 25-man troops made a company. Units representing the Caledonian Society, the Lancashire and Yorkshire Society, the Legion of Frontiersmen and other local organisations mirrored the Pals battalions in Britain. Volunteers could opt to serve overseas, within Rhodesia or only locally; around 1,000 had volunteered in all by 13 August.|$|E

50|$|Thymelicus is a Palearctic genus in {{the skipper}} {{butterfly}} family, Hesperiidae. It {{is the only}} member of the tribe Thymelini, but many skipper butterflies are yet to be assigned to tribes, so this <b>might</b> change <b>eventually.</b>|$|R
50|$|Stalachtis is a genus of metalmark {{butterflies}} (family Riodinidae). It {{is currently}} {{the only member of}} the tribe Stalachtini, but many metalmark butterflies are yet to be unequivocally assigned to tribes, so this <b>might</b> change <b>eventually.</b>|$|R
50|$|Ampittia is {{the genus}} of bush hoppers in the skipper {{butterfly}} family, Hesperiidae. It {{is the only}} member of the tribe Ampittiini, but many skipper butterflies are yet to be assigned to tribes, so this <b>might</b> change <b>eventually.</b>|$|R
25|$|The church {{supports}} {{the right of}} women {{to have access to}} safe abortions that are covered by provincial health care, but also supports better access to contraception, sexual education, and counselling that <b>might</b> <b>eventually</b> make abortion unnecessary.|$|E
25|$|Besides {{direct effect}} of {{asteroid}} impacts on a planet's surface topography, global climate and life, {{recent studies have}} shown that several consecutive impacts might {{have an effect on the}} dynamo mechanism at a planet's core responsible for maintaining the magnetic field of the planet, and <b>might</b> <b>eventually</b> shut down the planet's magnetic field.|$|E
25|$|Kamaraj, President of the Madras Provincial Congress Committee was of {{the opinion}} that the UDF should be allowed to form the Government as he had {{predicted}} the weak coalition <b>might</b> <b>eventually</b> fall apart. However other leaders such as T. T. Krishnamachari and Ramnath Goenka wanted Rajaji to be nominated to form the Government.|$|E
50|$|The Soviet Union {{had some}} {{intentions}} of occupying Hokkaidō. Had this occurred, there <b>might</b> have <b>eventually</b> been a communist {{state in the}} Soviet zone of occupation. However, unlike the Soviet occupations of East Germany and North Korea, these plans were frustrated by Truman's opposition.|$|R
25|$|While an {{inability}} to rapidly modernise its manufacturing capability <b>might</b> have <b>eventually</b> doomed the company, it was the Asian Economic Crisis of the early 1990s that directly brought about the crisis that engulfed Llama. Spanish banks that had extended bad loans in East Asia tried to cover their losses by restricting credit domestically, including to Llama.|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn this paper, {{we discuss}} the {{elementary}} properties of some simple SI, SR, SIR and SEIR epidemic models whose parameterizing functions (such as per-capita death rate, disease transmission, removal rate etc.) <b>might</b> be <b>eventually</b> time-varying but nonnecessarily time-integrable. Vaccination rules based of feedback, measuring the numbers {{of some of the}} partial populations defining the disease progress, are also discussed...|$|R
25|$|Arguing {{that his}} party {{includes}} people of various ethnic or religious origins like Jean-Pierre Cohen, Farid Smahi or Huguette Fatna, he has attributed some anti-Semitism in France {{to the effects}} of Muslim immigration to Europe and suggested that some part of the Jewish community in France <b>might</b> <b>eventually</b> come to appreciate National Front ideology. Le Pen has made statements denying climate change and linking climate science and communism.|$|E
25|$|A 2014 {{annual survey}} by the Entertainment Software Association showed that nearly as many women played video games (48%) as men, and this broader {{audience}} began to question some assumptions and tropes that had been common in games. Shira Chess and Adrienne Shaw wrote that concern over these changes is integral to Gamergate, especially a fear that sexualized games aimed primarily at young men <b>might</b> <b>eventually</b> be replaced by less sexualized games marketed to broader audiences.|$|E
25|$|After Wetton's death, Downes {{stated that}} the duo {{had been working on}} another Asia album after his death, and stated that it <b>might</b> <b>eventually</b> be {{completed}} and released. It is unclear if Wetton had recorded any parts, or if the album had only been in the songwriting process. In August, Palmer {{stated that the}} future of Asia was unclear, as it was too soon to make any decisions and the band members would be busy on other projects in the meantime.|$|E

5000|$|Brooks was an {{outsider}} {{in more ways}} than his relative inexperience. National Review was a Catholic magazine, and Brooks is not Catholic. Sam Tanenhaus later reported in The New Republic that Buckley <b>might</b> have <b>eventually</b> named Brooks his successor if it hadn't been for his being Jewish. [...] "If true, it would be upsetting," [...] Brooks says.|$|R
60|$|She {{knew from}} their route {{that they must}} have doubled back several times {{although}} she had quite lost all sense of direction; {{but she did not}} know that the prince was as equally confused as she, and that really he was running in an aimless, erratic manner, hoping that he <b>might</b> stumble <b>eventually</b> upon a place of refuge.|$|R
25|$|Ground {{was cleared}} for a {{rudimentary}} aircraft landing area during the mid-1930s, in anticipation that the island <b>might</b> <b>eventually</b> become a stopover for commercial trans-Pacific air routes {{and also to}} further U.S. territorial claims in the region against rival claims from Great Britain. Howland Island was designated as a scheduled refueling stop for American pilot Amelia Earhart and navigator Fred Noonan on their round-the-world flight in 1937. Works Progress Administration (WPA) funds were used by the Bureau of Air Commerce to construct three graded, unpaved runways meant to accommodate Earhart's twin-engined Lockheed Model 10 Electra.|$|E
25|$|There {{was concern}} in Russia, France, and Britain after 1903 as the {{implications}} of the German scheme to construct a great Berlin-Baghdad railway became apparent. A railway that would link Berlin to the Persian Gulf would provide Germany with a connection to its southernmost colonies in Africa, i.e. with German East Africa (present-day Rwanda and Burundi and the mainland part of Tanzania) and German South-West Africa (present-day Namibia, less Walvis Bay). The railway <b>might</b> <b>eventually</b> have strengthened the Ottoman Empire and its ties to Germany and might have shifted {{the balance of power in}} the region.|$|E
25|$|Climate engineering, {{commonly}} referred to as geoengineering, also known as climate intervention, There is substantial agreement among scientists that climate engineering cannot substitute for climate change mitigation. Some approaches might be used as accompanying measures to sharp cuts in greenhouse gas emissions. Given that all types of measures for addressing climate change have economic, political, or physical limitations, some climate engineering approaches <b>might</b> <b>eventually</b> be used as part of an ensemble of measures. Research on costs, benefits, and various types of risks of most climate engineering approaches is at an early stage and their understanding needs to improve to judge their adequacy and feasibility.|$|E
2500|$|If a {{spaceship}} could average 10percent of light speed (and decelerate at the destination, for manned missions), {{this would be}} enough to reach Proxima Centauri in forty years. Several propulsion concepts have been proposed [...] that <b>might</b> be <b>eventually</b> developed to accomplish this (see also the section below on propulsion methods), but none of them are ready for near-term (few decades) development at acceptable cost.|$|R
40|$|AbstractWe draw {{concrete}} and abstract operational semantics towards {{the analysis of}} logic programs with delay declarations. This is the basis to generalize the abstract interpreter GAIA to deal with logic programs employing dynamic scheduling. The {{concrete and}} abstract semantics are introduced explicitly and express both deadlock information and qualified answers. Sure deadlock and sure no deadlock information <b>might</b> be <b>eventually</b> inferred by the resulting analysis...|$|R
50|$|Meng Jiao {{was born}} into {{difficult}} times. His pursuit of poetry and reluctance until late in life to write and pass the imperial examinations (which if taken earlier in life <b>might</b> have <b>eventually</b> lead to a well-paid political career) resulted in his living a life in which necessities were scarce. Nevertheless, his commitment to poetry resulted in him becoming an influential leader in terms of poetic innovation.|$|R
25|$|In {{the theory}} of inflation, the rapid initial {{expansion}} of the universe is caused by a hypothetical particle called the inflaton. The exact properties of this particle are not fixed by the theory but should ultimately be derived from a more fundamental theory such as string theory. Indeed, {{there have been a number}} of attempts to identify an inflaton within the spectrum of particles described by string theory, and to study inflation using string theory. While these approaches <b>might</b> <b>eventually</b> find support in observational data such as measurements of the cosmic microwave background, the application of string theory to cosmology is still in its early stages.|$|E
25|$|The {{main issue}} {{turned out to}} be political, with War Plans {{concerned}} that reconstruction of the Tennessees might disrupt the building of new cruisers and with doubts about whether they would compare to more modern ships, even with their superior tonnage. Costs had escalated to $17 million and it did not seem profitable to modernize ships that would be between 25 and 28 years old once modernization was complete. Also, the Bureau of Ordnance did not consider replacing their guns practical. This meant that, if these ships were kept in service 15 years after modernization, they <b>might</b> <b>eventually</b> face weapons over 40 years more advanced than their own. Despite these developments, detailed studies continued.|$|E
25|$|Here a {{throwing}} motion acts on the sample. The vertical throwing {{motion is}} overlaid {{with a slight}} circular motion which results in distribution of the sample amount over the whole sieving surface. The particles are accelerated in the vertical direction (are thrown upwards). In the air they carry out free rotations and interact with the openings in the mesh of the sieve when they fall back. If the particles are smaller than the openings, they pass through the sieve. If they are larger, they are thrown upwards again. The rotating motion while suspended increases {{the probability that the}} particles present a different orientation to the mesh when they fall back again, and thus <b>might</b> <b>eventually</b> pass through the mesh.|$|E

5000|$|There {{were similar}} {{concerns}} about the allocation of the geostationary orbit (parking spots in space) for satellites. At the time {{only a small number}} of developed countries had satellites and it was not possible for developing countries to be allocated a space that they might need ten years later. This <b>might</b> mean <b>eventually</b> getting a space that was more difficult and more expensive to operate.|$|R
5000|$|Tchaikovsky {{had written}} [...] "End of {{movement}} 1" [...] {{on the last}} page of the Allegro de concert. However, {{when he decided to}} publish only that movement, he apparently omitted to cross this out. This has caused some speculation about his true intentions, for example, whether he <b>might</b> have <b>eventually</b> expanded the concerto to a full three-movement work, or used the other movements in some other form, had he not died.|$|R
25|$|Some time later, Donna (revealed to {{be another}} false name) converses with a fellow police officer, Mike, and the {{audience}} learns that New-Path {{is responsible for the}} manufacture and distribution of Substance D; ironically they use victims of the drug to tend their crops, since (being nearly mindless) they can be trusted not to reveal New-Path's secret. Donna expresses her growing ethical aversion to their police work, in which they deliberately selected Arctor—without his knowledge—to become addicted to Substance D all along; his health was sacrificed so that he <b>might</b> <b>eventually</b> enter a New-Path rehabilitation center unnoticed as a genuine addict and collect incriminating evidence of New-Path's Substance D farms. Donna and Mike debate whether Arctor's mind will recover enough so that he grasps the situation and returns from serving his sentence with substantial evidence to shut down New-Path.|$|E
25|$|While in the Senate, Pepper {{maintained}} a reduced private practice. The cases {{of which he}} was most proud of during that time were Frick v. Pennsylvania, an inheritance tax case, and Myers v. United States, which he argued as amicus curiae at the invitation of the Supreme court, concerning President Wilson's removal of a postmaster. Although the Court decided that the legislative act requiring Senatorial consent to such removal was unconstitutional, it thanked him for his service and he believed the decision vindicated President Andrew Johnson's position with respect to the Tenure of Office Act, and that the powerful dissent by Justices Holmes, McReynolds and Brandeis <b>might</b> <b>eventually</b> receive favorable future reconsideration. Pepper also took pride in his handling of the George Otis Smith case (concerning the Federal Power Commission), where Pepper vindicated Presidential rights against the Senate, having refused a senatorial delegation's offer to represent them but accepting that of Attorney General Mitchell.|$|E
25|$|In January 2014, Geoff Johns {{announced}} that Lex Luthor and Captain Cold would be joining the Justice League. In {{the wake of}} the Crime Syndicate's invasion, public opinion of Lex Luthor was incredibly favorable, and he decided that he liked it. Another reason was he believed the entity that destroyed the Earth from the alternate universe which the Crime Syndicate came from was the larger threat and <b>might</b> <b>eventually</b> become a threat to their universe and wanted the Justice League to be prepared for that possibility beforehand. In an effort to continue being regarded as a hero, he tried to convince the Justice League to recruit him, but was initially unsuccessful. The Justice League eventually talked about how Luthor was going to keep on his crusade with or without the help of the Justice League. They let Luthor join the Justice League knowing he could find out information that could put all of them in danger, but Batman figured at least they could keep a close watch on Luthor and LexCorp, and much to the chagrin of Superman, Luthor secured a place in the Justice League, even building a new Watchtower for them and recruiting Shazam onto the team.|$|E
