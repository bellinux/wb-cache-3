It has been found experimentally that the rotor relative Mach number and incidence angle are parameters important {{to the evolution of}} the MPT sound and the inlet duct length has a significant influence on the MPT sound emission. The experimental results are compared with a previous analysis. From the known blade nonuniformities of the model fan, the MPT distributions are computed.

40|$|Detailed laser Doppler {{velocimeter}} (LDV) {{flow field}} measurements were made upstream of two fans, one forward-swept and one aft-swept, {{in order to}} learn more about the shocks which propagate upstream of these rotors when they are operated at supersonic tip speeds. The blade-to-blade variations in the flows associated with these shocks are thought to be responsible for generating <b>Multiple</b> <b>Pure</b> <b>Tone</b> (MPT) <b>noise.</b> The measured blade-to-blade variations are documented in this report through a series of slideshows which show relative Mach number contours computed from the velocity measurements. Data are presented for the forward-swept fan operating at three speeds (corresponding to tip relative Mach numbers of 0. 817, 1. 074, and 1. 189), and for the aft-swept fan operating at two (tip relative Mach numbers of 1. 074 and 1. 189). These LDV data illustrate how the perturbations in the upstream flow field created by the rotating blades vary with axial position, radial position and rotor speed. As expected, at the highest tested speed the forward-swept fan swallowed the shocks which occur in the tip region, whereas the aftswept fan did not. This resulted in a much smaller flow disturbance just upstream of the tip of the forward-swept fan. Nevertheless, further upstream the two fan flows were much more similar...|$|R

The objective of the Quiet High Speed Fan was a 6 -dB reduction in the Effective Perceived Noise Level relative to the baseline fan at the takeoff condition. The intent of the Quiet High Speed Fan design was to provide both a <b>multiple</b> <b>pure</b> <b>tone</b> <b>noise</b> reduction from the forward sweep of the fan rotor and a rotor-stator interaction blade passing tone noise reduction from a leaned stator. The tunnel noise data indicted that the Quiet High Speed Fan was quieter than the baseline fan for {{a significant portion of}} the operating line and was 6 dB quieter near the takeoff condition. Although reductions in the multiple pure tones were observed, the vast majority of the EPNdB reduction was a result of the reduction in the blade passing tone and its harmonics. Laser Doppler Velocimetry (LDV) and shroud unsteady pressure measurement data were obtained upstream of the QHSF and baseline rotors to improve the understanding of the shocks which propagate upstream of the two fans when they are operated at high speeds.

The stages were tested statically in a 15 -in. -dia model lift fan installed in a wing pod located in the test section of a wind tunnel. Although the fan stages produced essentially the same design pressure ratio, marked differences were observed in the variation of fan noise with fan operating speed. At design speed, the forward-radiated sound power level was approximately {{the same for the}} 750 and 900 fps stages.

The experimental results are presented {{in terms of both}} far-field and duct acoustic data. Front quadrant sound power level reduction in the far field is shown to agree with duct measurements over the range of treatment lengths. Detailed one-third octave and narrow band spectra at the maximum forward noise angle are presented.

40|$|A {{supersonic}} {{tip speed}} {{single stage fan}} was modified {{with the intent of}} reducing <b>multiple</b> <b>pure</b> <b>tone</b> (MPT) or buzz saw noise. There were three modifications to the blades from the original design. The modifications to the blade resulted in an increase in cascade throat area causing the shock to start at a lower corrected fan speed. The acoustic results without acoustically absorbing liners showed substantial reduction in <b>multiple</b> <b>pure</b> <b>tone</b> levels. However, an increase in the blade passing frequency noise at takeoff fan speed accompanied the MPT reduction. The net result however, was a reduction in the maximum 1000 -foot (304. 8 m) altitude level flyover PNL. For the case with acoustic treatment in the inlet outer wall, the takeoff noise increased relative to an acoustically treated baseline. This was largely due to the increased blade passing frequency noise which was not effectively reduced by the liner...|$|R
40|$|One {{source of}} noise in high tip speed {{turbofan}} engines, caused by shocks, is called <b>multiple</b> <b>pure</b> <b>tone</b> <b>noise</b> (MPT's). A new fan, called the Quiet High Speed Fan (QHSF), showed reduced noise over the part speed operating range, which includes MPT's. The QHSF showed improved performance in most respects relative to a baseline fan; however, a partspeed instability discovered during testing reduced the operating range below acceptable limits. The measured QHSF adiabatic efficiency on the fixed nozzle acoustic operating line was 85. 1 percent and the baseline fan 82. 9 percent, a 2. 2 percent improvement. The operating line pressure rise at design point rotational speed and mass flow was 1. 764 and 1. 755 for the QHSF and baseline fan, respectively. Weight flow at design point speed was 98. 28 lbm/sec for the QHSF and 97. 97 lbm/sec for the baseline fan. The operability margin for the QHSF approached 0 percent at the 75 percent speed operating condition. The baseline fan maintained sufficient margin throughout the operating range as expected.

40|$|Embedded {{propulsion}} systems, such as {{for example}} used in advanced hybrid-wing body aircraft, can potentially offer major fuel burn and noise reduction benefits but introduce {{challenges in the}} aerodynamic and acoustic integration of the high-bypass ratio fan system. A novel approach is proposed to quantify the effects of non-uniform flow on the generation and propagation of <b>multiple</b> <b>pure</b> <b>tone</b> <b>noise</b> (MPTs). The new method is validated on a conventional inlet geometry first. The {{ultimate goal is to}} conduct a parametric study of S-duct inlets in order to quantify the effects of inlet design parameters on the acoustic signature. The key challenge is that the mechanism underlying the distortion transfer, noise source generation and propagation through the non-uniform flow field are inherently coupled such that a simultaneous computation of the aerodynamics and acoustics is required. The technical approach is based on a body force description of the fan blade row that is able to capture the distortion transfer and the MPT noise generation mechanisms while greatly reducing computational cost. A single, 3 -D full-wheel unsteady CFD simulation, in which the Euler equations are solved to second-order spatial and temporal accuracy, simultaneously computes the MPT noise generation and its propagation i...|$|E
40|$|The {{tone noise}} levels of a {{supersonic}} throughflow fan were measured at subsonic and supersonic axial duct Mach numbers. The {{noise in the}} inlet plenum showed no blade passing and harmonic tones at subsonic or supersonic axial flow conditions. At subsonic axial flow conditions, the supersonic throughflow fan showed no inlet plenum tones at fan operating conditions where tone noise had been previously measured for a subsonic fan design. This lower inlet-quadrant noise level for the supersonic throughflow fan {{was the result of}} high subsonic inlet velocities acting to reduce the noise propagating out the inlet. The fan noise, which was prevented from propagating upstream by the high subsonic inlet velocities, appeared to increase the noise in the exhaust duct at subsonic throughflow conditions. The exhaust duct noise decreased at supersonic axial throughflow Mach numbers, with the lowest blade passing and harmonic tones levels being observed at the design axial Mach number of 2. 0. <b>Multiple</b> <b>pure</b> <b>tone</b> <b>noise</b> was observed in the inlet duct at subsonic axial flow Mach numbers but was seen only in the exhaust duct at supersonic axial flow conditions...|$|E

40|$|Whereas {{the sound}} {{radiated}} {{from the inlet}} of turbofans is mainly due to rotor-stator interactions in approach flight, the shock waves (or N-waves) emitted by the rotor at transonic rotation speeds can be a dominant noise source during takeoff and climb. The study of N-waves needs {{to take account of}} two main processes: (i) The generation of N-waves for a perfect rotor (where all blades are identical) and for a real rotor (considering small geometrical blade dispersion); (ii) The N-wave propagation through the inlet duct producing the blade passing harmonics for a perfect rotor, and the <b>multiple</b> <b>pure</b> <b>tones</b> (harmonics of the rotation frequency) for a real rotor. Several approaches have been investigated for the past forty years. This paper intends to cross-check the main methods by applying them to two modern turbofan demonstrators. Moreover, a prospective way of N-wave generation based on geometrical considerations is investigated thanks to test data related to pressure signal and blade stagger angle measurements during the engine rotation. This prediction overcomes some drawbacks of other methods. Moreover, it appears to be very efficient to build rotor blade orderings that reduce the sound pressure level of the <b>multiple</b> <b>pure</b> <b>tones...</b>|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a fully numerical method for predicting multiple pure tones, {{also known as}} “Buzzsaw” noise. It consists of three steps that account for noise source generation, nonlinear acoustic propagation with hard as well as lined walls inside the nacelle, and linear acoustic propagation outside the engine. Noise generation is modeled by steady, part-annulus computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations. A linear superposition algorithm is used to construct full-annulus shock/pressure pattern just upstream of the fan from part-annulus CFD results. Nonlinear wave propagation is carried out inside the duct using a pseudo-two-dimensional solution of Burgers׳ equation. Scattering from nacelle lip as well as radiation to farfield is performed using the commercial solver ACTRAN/TM. The proposed prediction process is verified by comparing against full-annulus CFD simulations as well as against static engine test data for a typical high bypass ratio aircraft engine with hardwall as well as lined inlets. Comparisons are drawn against nacelle unsteady pressure transducer measurements at two axial locations as well as against near- and far-field microphone array measurements outside the duct. This is the first fully numerical approach (no experimental or empirical input is required) to predict <b>multiple</b> <b>pure</b> <b>tone</b> <b>noise</b> generation, in-duct propagation and far-field radiation.

A computational fluid dynamic analysis of the NASA QF- 12 Fan rotor, using the DAWES flow simulation program was performed to demonstrate and verify {{the causes of the}} relatively poor aerodynamic performance observed during the fan test. In addition, the rotor flowfield characteristics were qualitatively compared to the acoustic measurements to identify the key acoustic characteristics of the flow. The V 072 turbofan source noise prediction code was used to generate noise predictions for the TFE 731 - 60 fan at three operating conditions and compared to experimental data. V 072 results were also used in the Acoustic Radiation Code to generate far field noise for the TFE 731 - 60 nacelle at three speed points for the blade passage tone. A full 3 -D viscous flow simulation of the current production TFE 731 - 60 fan rotor was performed with the DAWES flow analysis program. The DAWES analysis was used to estimate the onset of <b>multiple</b> <b>pure</b> <b>tone</b> <b>noise,</b> based on predictions of inlet shock position {{as a function of the}} rotor tip speed.

In order to overcome a <b>pure</b> <b>tone</b> <b>noise</b> with a high peak value that is harmful to human hearing, a traditional reactive muffler has been used. However, the traditional method for designing a reactive muffler has proven to be time-consuming and insufficient. In order to efficiently reduce the peak noise level, interest in shape optimization of a Helmholtz muffler is coming to the forefront. Helmholtz mufflers that deal with a <b>pure</b> <b>tone</b> have been adequately researched. However, the shape optimization of multi-chamber Helmholtz mufflers that deal with a broadband noise hybridized with multiple tones within a constrained space has been mostly ignored.

It turns out that only the gasdynamic theory and the infinite degree of resonance theory explain the phenomenon as it is generally encountered. It has been shown that these two theories are essentially isomorphic. However, convention has limited both the theories in their scope.
