40|$|We {{report the}} effect of serum pH on the storage {{stability}} of the human creatine kinase isoenzymes and on the creatine kinase assay lag phase (Szasz et al., C/in. Chem. 22 : 650, 1976). We also investigated {{the effect of}} including mercaptoethanol, N-acetyl-L-cysteine, <b>monothioglycerol,</b> ethylenediaminetetraacetate, or ethylene glycol bis(/ 3 -aminoethyl ether) -N,N,N#{ 231 }N’-tetraacetatet 20, 4, and- 20 #{ 176 }C. Storage stability of the isoenzymes is profoundly af-fected by pH. For patients ’ samples and semi-purified human creatine kinase isoenzymes added to heat-inacti-vated sera, increasing diluent pH above 7. 0 decreases creatine kinase stability. The thiol agents or chelators generally give little or no protection above pH 7. 5; at pH 8. 5 they contribute significantly to isoenzyme instability. Storage at 4 #{ 176 }Cprovides greater stability than storage a...|$|E
40|$|In rats the {{sinusoidal}} glutathione (GSH) carrier transports GSH bidirectionally, and its {{activity is}} influenced by the thiol-disulfide status; the V, of sinusoidal GSH efflux was increased by dithiothreitol (DII) and decreased by cystine. In the present work we examined the specificity and directionality of the thiol effect. Using in situ perfused livers, we found that 1 m DTT and other dithiols, including 1, 2 -ethanedithiol, 1, 3 -propanedithiol, and 1, 4 -butanedithiol, stimulated sinusoidal GSH efflux by 200 - 500 % but dihydrothioctic acid, which is negatively charged, had no effect. Uncharged or positively charged monothiols (2 mM), such as dimercaprol, <b>monothioglycerol,</b> 2 -mercaptoethanol, 3 -mercapto- 2 -butanol, 1 -mercapto- 2 -propanol, and cysteamine, also exerted a stimulatory effect on sinusoidal GSH efflux. In contrast, monothiols containing a negatively charged substituent, such as penicillamine, captopnl, N-acetylcysteine, mercaptopro...|$|E
40|$|Different {{protocols}} incorporating methyl-β-cyclodextrin (MBCD) {{and reduced}} glutathione (GSH) {{have been reported}} to improve IVF recovery of cryopreserved mouse sperm on a C 57 BL/ 6 (J and N) genetic background. However, it is not clear which IVF protocol is most appropriate when using the various methods to cryorecover sperm with different sperm quality and sample volumes. Therefore, in the present study we correlated sperm motility with fertilization rate and compared the efficiency of different IVF methods using various sperm samples so as to establish general guidelines for mouse sperm cryorecovery by IVF. High linear correlation between sperm fertilization rate and progressive motility was found, R(2) was 0. 9623 and 0. 9993 for pre-freezing and post-thaw progressive motility, respectively. High amounts of cryoprotective agent (CPA) were observed to impair both sperm capacitation and fertilization. Moreover, the presence {{of a large number of}} immotile sperm in the sperm-oocyte co-incubation drop was found to reduce IVF success which could be partially reversed by supplementation using <b>monothioglycerol</b> (MTG) during centrifugation. It was concluded that the efficiency of IVF using cryorecovered mouse sperm in media containing MBCD and GSH can be predicted from sperm progressive motility. High concentrations of CPA and immotile sperm should be mitigated prior to IVF. The optimum IVF method should be selected based on sperm sample volume and sperm parameters...|$|E
40|$|Background: Sperm from C 57 BL/ 6 mice are {{difficult}} to cryopreserve and recover. Yet, the majority of genetically modified (GM) lines are maintained on this genetic background. Methodology/Principal Findings: Reported here {{is the development of}} an easily implemented method that consistently yields fertilization rates of 7065 % with this strain. This six-fold increase is achieved by collecting sperm from the vas deferens and epididymis into a cryoprotective medium of 18 % raffinose (w/v), 3 % skim milk (w/v) and 477 mM <b>monothioglycerol.</b> The sperm suspension is loaded into 0. 25 mL French straws and cooled at 3761 uC/min before being plunged and then stored in LN 2. Subsequent to storage, the sperm are warmed at 2, 2326162 uC/min and incubated in in vitro fertilization media for an hour prior to the addition of oocyte cumulus masses from superovulated females. Sperm from 735 GM mouse lines on 12 common genetic backgrounds including C 57 BL/ 6 J, BALB/cJ, 129 S 1 /SvImJ, FVB/NJ and NOD/ ShiLtJ were cryopreserved and recovered. C 57 BL/ 6 J and BALB/cByJ fertilization rates, using frozen sperm, were slightly reduced compared to rates involving fresh sperm; fertilization rates using fresh or frozen sperm were equivalent in all other lines. Developmental capacity of embryos produced using cryopreserved sperm was equivalent, or superior to, cryopreserved IVF-derived embryos. Conclusions/Significance: Combined, these results demonstrate the broad applicability of our approach as an economical and efficient option for archiving and distributing mice...|$|E
40|$|A DOTA-gastrin {{analogue}} (APH 070) which, when labelled with (111) In, {{has high}} {{affinity for the}} gastrin/CCK- 2 receptor (3 nM) and low tumour to kidney ratio in animal models, has been formulated and manufactured for a clinical study. Oxidation of the peptide methionine residue greatly reduces receptor affinity, therefore development work focused on producing a stable intermediate drug product (iDP) whilst ensuring that the formulation, container, closure and manufacturing process did not inhibit the extremely sensitive radiolabelling reaction (itself a source of oxidation). Stress testing revealed that APH 070 was stable at 2 - 8 degrees C at pH 6 - 9. Addition of an antioxidant (<b>monothioglycerol)</b> to the peptide formulation reduced stability when compared to buffer alone. Use of FluroTec (4023 / 50) stoppers (rather than FluroTec Plus (4110 / 40)) increased both the stability and radiolabelling efficiency of APH 070. Long term stability (6 months) of the final formulation (1 mg/ml APH 070 in 0. 01 M pH 7. 2 phosphate buffer) stored at 5 degrees C in type I glass vials with FluroTec (4023 / 50) stoppers was 98. 6 +/- 0. 2 % and 98. 4 +/- 0. 1 % for upright and inverted samples, respectively. Clinical scale radiolabelling of the final formulation routinely achieves the specification of > 85 % (111) In-APH 070 (unoxidised) stable for up to 2 h after dilution with 0. 9 % w/v saline solution. Specific uptake of the radiopharmaceutical in CCK- 2 R-expressing AR 42 J tumours in nude mice has been demonstrated...|$|E
40|$|The {{concentration}} of oestrogen receptors (ER) in {{a breast cancer}} is now well established as an index for predicting the subsequent response of the disease to endocrine therapy (Hawkins et al., 1980). Oestrogen receptor concentration is influenced by menstrual status, tumour cellularity and tumour grade (Steele et al., 1982), and also rises with increasing age (e. g., Clark & McGuire, 1983; Mercer et al., 1983; Daxenbichler et al., 1982). The influence of tissue and plasma levels of oestrogen on ER concentration, however, is as yet less clearly understood: whilst high levels of circulating oestrogen {{have been found to}} be associated with low/absent tumour ER in premenopausal women (Maass et al., 1972; Nagai et al., 1979; Hawkins et al., 1979), less is known about this relationship in postmenopausal women. In the present study, we have examined the quantitative relationship between plasma oestrogens and ER in the tumours from 50 postmenopausal women. Plasma for the assay of oestrone and oestradiol- 17 / 3 and tumour for the assay of ER were obtained from 50 postmenopausal women with primary cancer of the breast. Plasma samples were obtained betweem 9 a. m. and 11 a. m. in the week prior to operation, and at operation, the tumour was placed on ice for immediate transfer to the laboratory. Oestrogen receptor activity was determined by by saturation analysis (Hawkins et al., 1975) with minor modifications. A portion of tumour (300 mg) was homogenised (1 : 10 w/v) in Tris buffer (10 mM Tris, 0. 25 M sucrose, 1 mm ethylene diamine tetracetate, containing 10 % v/v glycerol and 1 % <b>monothioglycerol)</b> and centrifuged at 2040 g for 20 min. Aliquots of the resulting cytosol were incubated overnight at 40 C with 0. 031 nM [2, 3, 6, 7 - 3 H] oestradiol and varying amounts of competin...|$|E
40|$|The enzyme E 1 {{ubiquitin}} ligase was purified from rabbit liver by ubiquitin {{affinity chromatography}} (Haas and Bright, 1988). Cdc 34 (E 2 enzyme) with an N-terminal His-tag was expressed in E. coli in LB medium from a pET 16 -derived plasmid, kindly provided by Dr. Jane Endicott (University of Oxford, United Kingdom). The protein was purified using Ni 2 +-charged chelating sepharose and buffer-exchanged into 50 mM Tris (pH 8. 0), 0. 1 M NaCl. Bovine ubiquitin was purchased from Sigma (St. Louis, Missouri) and used without further purification. To obtain the K 48 -linked ubiquitin chains, the reaction mixture containing 0. 5 mM ubiquitin, 1 µM E 1 enzyme, 30 µM Cdc 34, 2 mM ATP, 5 mM MgSO 4 and 0. 02 % <b>monothioglycerol</b> was incubated in the reaction buffer (50 mM Tris pH 8. 0, 0. 1 M NaCl) at 37 º C for 4 hrs. The reaction product was dialyzed overnight into 20 mM ammonium acetate (pH 4. 5) at 4 º C. The ubiquitin chains were separated on HPLC using a monoS column with KCl gradient followed by size-exclusion chromatography. Crystallization Initial crystallization conditions were screened by hanging drop vapor diffusion using the PACT crystallization suite (QIAGEN). The best crystals of UBAb {{were obtained by}} equilibrating a 0. 6 µL drop of a protein (14 mg/mL) in 20 mM sodium acetate (pH 5. 5), mixed with 0. 6 µL of reservoir solution containing 1. 2 M sodium/potassium phosphate (pH 8. 2) and 12 % (v/v) glycerol and suspended over 1 mL of reservoir solution. Crystals grew in 2 - 4 days at 20 ºC. Crystals of the free UBAb belong to a centered orthorhombic system, space group C 2221 with two molecules in the asymmetric unit (Z= 16) corresponding to Vm = 2. 00 Å 3 Da- 1 and a solvent content of 38. 6 % (Matthews, 1968).
