5|$|A hadron is a {{composite}} particle <b>made</b> <b>of</b> quarks held together by the strong force. Hadrons are categorized into two families: baryons (such as protons and neutrons) <b>made</b> <b>of</b> three quarks, and mesons (such as pions) <b>made</b> <b>of</b> one quark and one antiquark. Of the hadrons, protons are stable, and neutrons bound within atomic nuclei are stable. Other hadrons are unstable under ordinary conditions and are thus insignificant constituents of the modern Universe.|$|E
