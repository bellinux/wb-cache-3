The main peculiarity of the proposed mechanistic criteria is that they are based on the actual geometry of degraded fuel rods and not on a constant, user-defined failure temperature. This allows better modelling concerning the formation of local <b>molten</b> <b>pool(s)</b> in the upper part of bundle and the timing of subsequent materials relocations from the local <b>molten</b> <b>pool(s).</b> In general, the mechanistic criteria developed allow one to reasonably calculate the bundle degradation progression in both tests.

5000|$|The {{operational}} concept of EBF3 {{is to build}} a near-net-shape metal part directly from a computer-aided design (CAD) file. Current computer-aided machining practices start with a CAD model and use a post-processor to write the machining instructions (G-code) defining the cutting tool paths needed to make the part. EBF3 uses a similar process, starting with a CAD model, numerically slicing it into layers, then using a post-processor to write the G-code defining the deposition path and process parameters for the EBF3 equipment. It uses a focused electron beam in a vacuum environment to create a <b>molten</b> <b>pool</b> on a metallic substrate. The beam is translated with respect {{to the surface of the}} substrate while metal wire is fed into the <b>molten</b> <b>pool.</b> The deposit solidifies immediately after the electron beam has passed, having sufficient structural strength to support itself. The sequence is repeated in a layer-additive manner to produce a near-net-shape part needing only finish machining. The EBF3 process is scalable for components from fractions of an inch to tens of feet in size, limited mainly by the size of the vacuum chamber and amount of wire feedstock available.|$|E

Observations revealed that {{the formation of the}} Al/Al{sub 2 } 0 {sub 3 } composites involves three stages. Initially, Al infiltrates into a dense mullite preform through grain boundary diffusion, and reacts with mullite at grain boundaries to form a partial reaction zone.

A simplified numerical model was carried out to predict layer heights together with temperature distributions induced by the (LMD) process on a titanium alloy, and a metal matrix composite. Compared with previously developed models, this simplified approach uses an arbitrary Lagrangian Eulerian free surface motion directly dependent on the powder mass feed rate Dm. Considering thin wall builds of Ti- 6 Al- 4 V titanium alloy, numerical results obtained with comsol 4. 3 Multiphysics software were successfully compared with the experimental data such as geometrical properties of manufactured walls, fast camera <b>molten</b> <b>pools</b> measurements, and thermocouple temperature recordings in the substrate during the manufacturing of up to 10 LMD. Even if the model did not consider coupled hydraulic-thermal aspects, it provides a more realistic local geometrical description of additive layer manufacturing walls than simpler thermal models, with much shorter calculation times than more sophisticated approaches considering thermocapillary fluid flow.

5000|$|Another {{approach}} is to use an electron beam to melt welding wire onto a surface {{to build up a}} part. [...] This is similar to the common 3D printing process of fused deposition modeling, but with metal, rather than plastics. With this process, an electron-beam gun provides the energy source used for melting metallic feedstock, which is typically wire. The electron beam is a highly efficient power source that can be both precisely focused and deflected using electromagnetic coils at rates well into thousands of hertz. Typical electron-beam welding systems have high power availability, with 30- and 42-kilowatt systems being most common. A major advantage of using metallic components with electron beams is that the process is conducted within a high-vacuum environment of 1 Torr or greater, providing a contamination-free work zone that does not require the use of additional inert gases commonly used with laser and arc-based processes. With EBDM, feedstock material is fed into a <b>molten</b> <b>pool</b> created by the electron beam. Through the use of computer numeric controls (CNC), the <b>molten</b> <b>pool</b> is moved about on a substrate plate, adding material just where it is needed to produce the near net shape.

Once the electrodes have reached the heavy melt at the base of the furnace and the arcs are shielded by the scrap, the voltage can be increased and the electrodes raised slightly, lengthening the arcs and increasing power to the melt. This enables a <b>molten</b> <b>pool</b> to form more rapidly, reducing tap-to-tap times.

The new ingot is covered in an engineered slag that is superheated by the electric current. The electrode tip is slowly melted from contact with the slag. These metal droplets travel through the slag to the bottom of the water-cooled mold and slowly freeze as the ingot is directionally solidified upwards from the bottom of the mold. The slag pool floats above the refined alloy, continuously floating upwards as the alloy solidifies. The molten metal is cleaned of impurities that chemically react with the slag or otherwise float to the top of the <b>molten</b> <b>pool</b> as the molten droplets pass through the slag.|$|E
40|$|Pool {{oscillations}} in tungsten {{inert gas}} welding pools have been used in a closed- loop control system for orbital welding of ultra high purity tubing, determining a target level of penetration by altering the welding current in real-time. The technique is ideally suited to this application since it is does not contravene the cleanliness requirements for the inner bore and can be implemented outside the small orbital heads that are commonly used. The results presented in this thesis show how clear pool oscillation signals in extremely small <b>molten</b> <b>pools</b> can be monitored by optimising the welding conditions and signal processing of the arc voltage signal. As an indicator of the likely variation in cast behaviour present particularly in austenitic stainless steels, a 'time-to-penetrate' characterisation was made of the materials, using the time of the transition from the Mode 1 to the Mode 3 oscillation behaviour as the measured variable. By applying the test across a range of welding currents, significant insight was obtained into the cast and associated penetration behaviour. Late transitions indicated casts that exhibited significantly different responses to the more usually applied welding procedures, especially at the lower levels of welding current (highlighting their potentially more problematic penetration behaviour). It was shown that the established theoretical models were difficult to apply with certainty to moving weld pools, and consequently a fuzzy logic model was used in the control strategy. The closed-loop system comprised a user-interface PC, a control rack and commercial welding power source - control signals were applied every 2 to 3 Hz. Mode 3 pool oscillations were found to offer a more than satisfactory sensitivity to the inner bead width created for the various casts of 1. 65 mm wall thickness materials studied...|$|R

5000|$|Cast Iron - {{the product}} {{extracted}} from iron ore. Iron oxide-rich ore is heated to a molten {{state in the}} presence of limestone within a large flask. Oxygen makes a chemical transition from the iron oxides to the calcium forming a [...] "slag" [...] which floats to the top of an increasingly iron-rich <b>molten</b> <b>pool.</b> When done, the bottom of the flask is opened and the iron pours out - historically into sand patterns to produce cast iron stoves and such, or into troughs on the foundry floor to form rough billets. The billets could be re-melted and cast into shapes at other foundries or could be hammered into wrought iron in forges. Good news is cast iron flows easily into molds and can be used to quickly form intricate articles from iron. Bad news is that cast iron is brittle and cracks rather than bends. Brittle because it is not pure iron - impurities are not completely leached from the ore and carbon from the heating fuel is absorbed into the iron pool. Quick cooling of the iron in a mold also increases brittleness - smaller, thinner pieces (like hinges) are usually more brittle than larger, heavier pieces (like machines) that [...] "hold their heat" [...] when poured and thus take longer to cool.|$|E
50|$|Spot welding is a {{resistance}} welding method used to join {{two or more}} overlapping metal sheets, studs, projections, electrical wiring hangers, some heat exchanger fins, and some tubing. Usually power sources and welding equipment are sized to the specific thickness and material being welded together. The thickness {{is limited by the}} output of the welding power source and thus the equipment range due to the current required for each application. Care is taken to eliminate contaminants between the faying surfaces. Usually, two copper electrodes are simultaneously used to clamp the metal sheets together and to pass current through the sheets. When the current is passed through the electrodes to the sheets, heat is generated due to the higher electrical resistance where the surfaces contact each other. As the electrical resistance of the material causes a heat buildup in the work pieces between the copper electrodes, the rising temperature causes a rising resistance, and results in a <b>molten</b> <b>pool</b> contained most of the time between the electrodes. As the heat dissipates throughout the workpiece in less than a second (resistance welding time is generally programmed as a quantity of AC cycles or milliseconds) the molten or plastic state grows to meet the welding tips. When the current is stopped the copper tips cool the spot weld, causing the metal to solidify under pressure. The water cooled copper electrodes remove the surface heat quickly, accelerating the solidification of the metal, since copper is an excellent conductor. Resistance spot welding typically employs electrical power in the form of direct current, alternating current, medium frequency half-wave direct current, or high-frequency half wave direct current.|$|E
