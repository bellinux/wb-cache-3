40|$|The {{development}} of the tetrabenzylglucosyloxycarbonyl (BGloc) -protecting group as an enzymatically removable urethane protecting function for peptide synthesis is described. BGloc-protected amino acids are readily synthesized by conversion of amino <b>acid</b> <b>allyl</b> <b>esters</b> into the respective isocyanates, subsequent treatment with 2, 3, 4, 6 -tetrabenzylglucose and C-terminal <b>allyl</b> <b>ester</b> cleavage. From BGloc masked dipeptide esters, which are accessible by standard methods of peptide chemistry, the N-terminal urethane is selectively cleaved off in high yield via removal of the benzyl ethers by hydrogenation followed by hydrolysis of the urethane by means of alpha- and beta-glucosidase under very mild reaction conditions.

Each organism has its own capacity to degrade both pesticides into various subgroups depending largely upon the main functional group of each individual pesticide.

These radicals were not observed to be formed in significant quantities on the radiolysis of polyacrylonitrile. They are believed to result from a scission of the main chain at methacrylic acid/acrylonitrile diad sequences following loss of the <b>methacrylic</b> <b>acid</b> carboxyl group.

40|$|Two {{polyelectrolytes}} were synthesized with reversible addition-fragmentation {{chain transfer}} (RAFT) polymerization and Grignard metathesis (GRIM) polymerization for the functionalization of carbon nanotubes. The responses of functionalized carbon nanotubes towards different substrates were well studied. A diblock polyelectrolyte with <b>methacrylic</b> <b>acid</b> containing block and pyrene pendant block was synthesized by RAFT polymerization. The pyrene pendant block anchored {{on the surface}} of carbon nanotubes while the <b>methacrylic</b> <b>acid</b> containing block dissolved in methanol to disperse individual carbon nanotubes. The dispersed carbon nanotubes have shown morphological responsive towards substrates with pyridine groups and amino groups on surface. The thickness of functionalized carbon nanotubes on these substrates increased from tens of nanometers to hundreds of nanometers due to the swelling of the <b>methacrylic</b> <b>acid</b> containing block. The <b>methacrylic</b> <b>acid</b> units were deprotonated by pyridine groups and amino groups on the surface so the polymer chains in the <b>methacrylic</b> <b>acid</b> containing block stretched into rigid rod structure leading to the swelling effect. A polythiophene-based conjugated polyelectrolyte with positive quaternary ammonium species on its side chains was synthesized by GRIM polymerization. The self-assembly behaviors of this conjugated polyelectrolyte in solvents with different polarities led to solvatochromism and different efficiencies for dispersion of carbon nanotubes. The efficiency of this conjugated polyelectrolyte for the dispersion of carbon nanotubes was highest when no aggregation was formed. The functionalized carbon nanotubes could be deposited on conductive substrates applied with negative potential due to the positive quaternary ammonium species. The density of carbon nanotubes deposited on the substrate increased with the potential applied. The electro-deposition of this functionalized carbon nanotubes could be applied for large scale fabrication of carbon nanotubes thin film. published_or_final_versionChemistryMasterMaster of Philosoph...|$|R
