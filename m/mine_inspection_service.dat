5000|$|Mine consolidations {{were still}} {{occurring}} and the underground around {{the site of}} the 1777 collapse that had initiated the project had already become a series of stone and masonry inspection passageways that reinforced the streets above. The mine renovation and cemetery closures were both issues within the jurisdiction of the Police Prefect Police Lieutenant-General Alexandre Lenoir, who had been directly involved {{in the creation of a}} <b>mine</b> <b>inspection</b> <b>service.</b> Lenoir endorsed the idea of moving Parisian dead to the subterranean passageways that were renovated during 1782. After deciding to further renovate the [...] "Tombe-Issoire" [...] passageways for their future role as an underground sepulchre, the idea became law during late 1785.|$|E
50|$|The catacombs {{in their}} first years were a disorganised bone repository, but Louis-Étienne Héricart de Thury, {{director}} of the Paris <b>Mine</b> <b>Inspection</b> <b>Service</b> from 1810, had renovations done that would transform the underground caverns into a visitable mausoleum. In addition to directing the stacking of skulls and femurs into the patterns seen in the catacombs today, he used the cemetery decorations he could find (formerly stored on the Tombe-Issoire property, many had disappeared after the 1789 Revolution) to complement the walls of bones. Also created was a room dedicated to the display of the various minerals found under Paris, and another showing various skeletal deformities found during the catacombs' creation and renovation. He also added monumental tablets and archways bearing inscriptions (that some found questionable) that were warnings, descriptions or other comments {{about the nature of}} the ossuary, and, for the safety of eventual visitors, it was walled from the rest of the Paris Left Bank already-extensive underground tunnel network.|$|E

50|$|The {{foundations}} for the <b>inspection</b> <b>services</b> were {{laid in the}} late nineteenth century when a growing demand became apparent for safeguards regarding the quality of propagating material and seed. This need resulted in several inspection initiatives. In 1919 the Central Committee for the Inspection of Plants was established, followed by the Inspection Institute for Seeds and Planting Materials. Both organisations competed in their seed inspection activities. The establishment in 1932 of the Netherlands General <b>Inspection</b> <b>Service</b> for Agricultural Seeds and Seed Potatoes (NAK) signalled the end of the confusion. From then on, the inspection of agricultural crops was centralised. The first merger was between the then Netherlands General <b>Inspection</b> <b>Service</b> for Arboricultural Crops (NAKB) (1941) and the Netherlands General <b>Inspection</b> <b>Service</b> for Floricultural Crops (NAKS) (1947). This resulted in the creation of the NAKB. In 2000 the new NAKB and NAKG (the Netherlands General <b>Inspection</b> <b>Service</b> for Vegetable and Flower Seeds, 1941) merged to form the current Naktuinbouw.|$|R
