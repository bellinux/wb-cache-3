5|$|Leather was not {{infrequently}} used {{even for}} the costly and elaborate chairs of the faldstool form—occasionally sheathed in thin plates of silver—which Venice sent all over Europe. To this day, indeed, leather {{is one of the}} most frequently employed materials for chair covering. The outstanding characteristic of most chairs until the middle of the 17th century was <b>massiveness</b> and solidity. Being usually made of oak, they were of considerable weight, and it was not until the introduction of the handsome Louis XIII chairs with cane backs and seats that either weight or solidity was reduced.|$|E
5|$|Douglas's {{influences}} {{were not}} from England alone. Although he never travelled abroad, he incorporated Gothic styles from continental countries, especially Germany and France. This combination of Gothic styles contributed {{to what has}} come to be known as the High Victorian style. Its features include a sense of <b>massiveness,</b> steep roofs which are frequently hipped, round turrets with conical roofs, pinnacles, heavy corbel tables, and the use of polychromism. Many of Douglas's works, especially his earlier ones, are High Victorian in style, or incorporate High Victorian features. One characteristic feature of Douglas's work is the inclusion of dormer windows rising through the eaves and surmounted by hipped roofs.|$|E
25|$|A Sizang, {{he was a}} very strong, {{tall and}} {{masculine}} individual who possessed an unusual body structure, measuring “9 tuuk” at his chest (54inches diameter and 108inches of the chest circumference). Yet, because of his ability to move quickly, apparent body lightness despite its <b>massiveness,</b> and his athletic skills, the constant admiration was overwhelming. The description of his physical feature seems similar to the figure of Goliath in the Bible, 1 Samuel 17:4-7, Goliath was more than six cubits- about three meters tall, according to the Bible. Pu Tong Seal's dwelling place was Khuasak, Zogam (Chin State), northern Burma. His father-in-law at that time lived in Theizang but owned a plot at Khuakhuan, 'Khuasak'.|$|E
25|$|Something of Hampden's fame {{no doubt}} is {{owing to the}} {{position}} which he took up as the opponent of ship money. But it is hardly possible that even resistance to ship money would have so distinguished him but for the mingled <b>massiveness</b> and modesty of his character, his dislike of all pretences in himself or others, his brave contempt of danger, and his charitable readiness to shield others {{as far as possible}} from the evil consequences of their actions. Nor was he wanting in that skill which enabled him to influence men towards the ends at which he aimed, and which was spoken of as subtlety by those who disliked his ends.|$|E
25|$|The {{black-footed ferret}} {{has a long}} slender body with black {{outlines}} such as the feet, ears, parts of the face and its tail. The forehead is arched and broad, and the muzzle is short. It has few whiskers, and its ears are triangular, short, erect and broad at the base. The neck is long and the legs short and stout. The toes are armed with sharp, very slightly arched claws. The feet on both surfaces are covered in hair, even to the soles, thus concealing the claws. It combines several physical features common in both members of the subgenus Gale (least, short-tailed and long-tailed weasels) and Putorius (European and steppe polecats). Its skull resembles that of polecats in its size, <b>massiveness</b> {{and the development of}} its ridges and depressions, though it is distinguished by the extreme degree of constriction behind the orbits where the width of the cranium is much less than that of the muzzle. Though similar in size to polecats, its attenuate body, long neck, very short legs, slim tail, large orbicular ears and close-set pelage is much closer in conformation to weasels and stoats. The dentition of the black-footed ferret closely resembles that of the European and steppe polecat, though the back lower molar is vestigial, with a hemispherical crown which is too small and weak to develop the little cusps which are more apparent in polecats.|$|E
500|$|As Biel has written, [...] "The [...] committee's Beaux Arts design , {{with its}} <b>massiveness</b> and symmetry, offered monumentality {{with nothing more}} {{particular}} to monumentalize than the aspirations of the modern university"until the Titanic sank and [...] "through delicate negotiation, [...] convinced Eleanor Widener that the most eloquent tribute to Harry would be an entire library rather than a rare book wing." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{inherent}} <b>massiveness</b> of {{the brick}} [...] "plate-wall" [...] {{structure of the}} outer part of the library helps to create the cloistered atmosphere that Kahn felt was appropriate for library carrels. [...] While explaining his proposal for the library at Washington University, Kahn had used {{the example of the}} cloistered carrels at the monastic library at Dunham, England, to explain his [...] "desire to find a space construction system in which the carrels were inherent in the support which harbored them ... Wall-bearing masonry construction with its niches and vaults has the appealing structural order to provide naturally such spaces." ...|$|E
500|$|Hindustan Times writer Robin Bansal was {{impressed}} with the song, and called it [...] "eclectic, peppy, and electrifying from the start... The song explodes after a point in its <b>massiveness</b> and stays in the head. The impeccable notes and pitch makes one wonder if it's really Priyanka." [...] He added that the song had a high tempo and pitch, making it more like a track by The Black Eyed Peas. Chopra refuted the claims that her voice was digitally modulated, and said she has a high range in her voice, and that she always had an accent while speaking English. Perdy Mohindru from The Times of India described the lyrics as simple and beautiful, and complemented Chopra's accent and voice.|$|E
2500|$|Following the {{expiration}} of Dr. Rudolf Diesel's patent in 1912, his engine design was successfully applied to marine propulsion and stationary applications. [...] However, the <b>massiveness</b> and poor power-to-weight ratio {{of these early}} engines made them unsuitable for propelling land-based vehicles. [...] Therefore, the engine's potential as a railroad prime mover was not initially recognized. This changed as development reduced the size and weight of the engine.|$|E
2500|$|Regardless of tempo, Klemperer's {{performances}} often maintain great intensity, and are richly detailed. Eric Grunin, in {{a commentary}} on the [...] "opinions" [...] page of his Eroica Project, notes: [...] "....The <b>massiveness</b> of the first movement of the Eroica is real, but is not its main claim on our attention. That honor goes to its astonishing story (structure), and what is to me most unique about Klemperer is that {{his understanding of the}} structure remains unchanged no matter what his tempo... The German works of Kurt Weill were amongst Klemperer's favorites and he encouraged Weill to compose the orchestral suite Kleine Dreigroschenmusik.|$|E
2500|$|The {{construction}} of the Cardston Alberta Temple (6), on June 27, 1913, started two decades {{after the completion of}} the Salt Lake Temple. The temple at Cardston was the first design to be put out to bid to prominent architects, and the first to be designed without a priesthood assembly hall. This began a transition away from multi-purpose temples. The Cardston temple has [...] of floor space and is described as an [...] "octagonal design with no spire—similar to Maltese cross—it has Grecian <b>massiveness</b> and a Peruvian touch of Aztec influence with pyramid silhouette." [...] It has four ordinance rooms and five sealing rooms.|$|E
2500|$|For the {{secondary}} to be imploded by the hot, radiation-induced plasma surrounding it, it must remain cool {{for the first}} microsecond, i.e., it must be encased in a massive radiation (heat) shield. The shield's <b>massiveness</b> allows it to double as a tamper, adding momentum and duration to the implosion. No material is better suited for both of these jobs than ordinary, cheap uranium-238, which also happens to undergo fission when struck by the neutrons produced by D-T fusion. This casing, called the pusher, thus has three jobs: to keep {{the secondary}} cool; to hold it, inertially, in a highly compressed state; and, finally, {{to serve as the}} chief energy source for the entire bomb. The consumable pusher makes the bomb more a uranium fission bomb than a hydrogen fusion bomb. Insiders never used the term [...] "hydrogen bomb".|$|E
2500|$|Portraits of the Loire Framing Sculptures Que voit-on quand on ne regarde pas ? (What do you {{see when}} you are not looking?) or {{subjects}} more episodical: Memories of a Train Journey, Thelonious Monk Architect, Afternoon in the Louvre or The Carpenters’ Design, Albert’s painting are not limited to a particular style. He likes to cite Chinese masters of the classical period, mentioned by Matisse who taught the student to identify with his subject: to paint the tree in its expansion, the rock in its rugged <b>massiveness</b> and mentions that the precept can be also found in General semantics by Alfred Korzybski: [...] "To be efficient, a language should be similar in its structure to the structure of the event it is supposed to represent". This idea that an artwork should be autonomous — epoch and even author's identity, taking second place — has provoked vigorous discussions with artists friends, notably with painter Joan Mitchell.|$|E
2500|$|By late 1914, {{foundation}} {{tests and}} paving activities were underway for a six-story warehouse {{to be built}} on Municipal Dock No. 1. [...] And in December 1914, the Harbor Commission unveiled the structural plans (pictured to the left) prepared by Chief Harbor Engineer S.A. Jubb for the [...] "mammoth new warehouse." [...] The Los Angeles Times reported at {{the time on the}} proposed design as follows:"The <b>massiveness</b> and character of the structure, of course, preclude the idea of architectural beauty and make any considerable degree of ornamentation undesirable. [...] Both commissions, however, are desirous that the warehouse shall be more than merely a gigantic fireproof box with four walls, a roof and various openings. [...] Considerable study, therefore, has been given to the treatment of cornice and wall panels, to the end that as pleasing and symmetrical an effect may be obtained as is consistent with the purposes and proportions of the building.The warehouse will be of reinforced concrete construction and six stories in height. [...] It will be [...] in length and [...] wide, being the largest structure of its kind ever erected west of Chicago. ... The warehouse is to stand at the seaward end of the city's present great outer harbor dock ..." ...|$|E
60|$|Side by {{side with}} the <b>massiveness</b> of the Roman Past, all matters that we handle or dream of {{nowadays}} look evanescent and visionary alike.|$|E

6000|$|... 'Yes, {{they are}} good at all ages,' replied Loerke. 'A man should be big and powerful--whether he is old or young is of no account, so he has the size, {{something}} of <b>massiveness</b> and--and stupid form.' ...|$|E
60|$|The Samurai had arrived, in thunders and lightnings, {{riding the}} wings of the storm, {{directing}} the gigantic, labouring Elsinore in all her intricate <b>massiveness,</b> commanding the wisps of humans to his will, which was the will of wisdom.|$|E
60|$|Her face relaxed as {{she noticed}} {{the ease with which}} he got the big trunk to his shoulder, and her eyes glowed as they glanced over the graceful <b>massiveness</b> of the man. But Bill did not see that. He was too busy with the trunk.|$|E
60|$|Masterman Throgton, {{the general}} manager of the Planet, was a man in middle life. There was {{something}} in his massive frame which suggested <b>massiveness,</b> and a certain quality in the poise of his great head which indicated a balanced intellect. His face was impenetrable and his expression imponderable.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Farebrother was too keen a man not to {{know the}} meaning of that reply, and there was a certain <b>massiveness</b> in Lydgate's manner and tone, {{corresponding}} with his physique, which if he repelled your advances in the first instance seemed to put persuasive devices out of question.|$|E
6000|$|... "And human {{happiness}} as evanescent too," [...] observed Hilda, sighing; [...] "and beautiful art hardly less so!

60|$|On the bridge, they {{paused and}} {{looked up and down}} the rapids rushing down the slope in all their wild variety, with the white crests of {{breaking}} surf, the dark <b>massiveness</b> of heavy-climbing waves, the fleet, smooth sweep of currents over broad shelves of sunken rock, the dizzy swirl and suck of whirlpools.|$|E
60|$|Clay {{had thrown}} off the {{coverings}} and was {{propped up on}} two large pillows. His silk pajamas showed the <b>massiveness</b> of his short neck and his powerful chest and arms; but his face was pinched and gray except where it was streaked with a faint purple tinge. Jimmy {{could see that the}} man was very ill.|$|E
60|$|Still Portsmouth was not {{the best}} place for him, and we were glad that he was well enough to go up to London in the afternoon; {{intensely}} delighting in the May beauty of the green meadows, and white blossoming hedgerows, and the Church towers, especially the gray <b>massiveness</b> of Winchester Cathedral. 'Christian tokens,' he said, instead of the gay, gilded pagodas and quaint crumpled roofs he had left. The soft haze seemed to be such a rest after the glare of perpetual clearness.|$|E
60|$|They {{seated at}} a table, capable of {{indefinite}} extension, in a long, low dining room that was {{a replica of the}} hacienda dining rooms of the Mexican land-kings of old California. The floor was of large brown tiles, the beamed ceiling and the walls were whitewashed, and the huge, undecorated, cement fireplace was an achievement in <b>massiveness</b> and simplicity. Greenery and blooms nodded from without the deep- embrasured windows, and the room expressed the sense of cleanness, chastity, and coolness.|$|E
6000|$|The brave girl {{whom the}} matron was {{preparing}} to devote to him stood shrinking with a trepidation which she could not conceal at sight of his strange <b>massiveness,</b> with his rust-gold hair coming down toward his thick yellow brows and mocking blue eyes in a dense bang, and his jaw squaring itself under the rather insolent smile of his full mouth. The matron felt that her victim teas perhaps going to fail her, when a voice at her ear said, as if the question were extorted, [...] "Who {{in the world is}} that?" ...|$|E
60|$|The {{difficulty}} did not, however, trouble me {{beyond a}} mere passing thought. In {{the joy of}} the coming meeting and the longing rapture at the mere thought of it, all difficulties disappeared. Love makes its own faith, and I never doubted that my Lady would be waiting for me at the place designated. When I had passed through the little arched passages, and up the doubly-grated stairways contrived in the <b>massiveness</b> of the walls, I let myself out on the leads. It was well that as yet the times were sufficiently peaceful not to necessitate guards or sentries at all such points.|$|E
60|$|This man {{was hunting}} about {{the hotel lobby}} like a starved dog that had {{forgotten}} where he had buried a bone. He had a face of great acreage, red, pulpy, and {{with a kind of}} sleepy <b>massiveness</b> like that of Buddha. He possessed one single virtue--he was very smoothly shaven. The mark of the beast is not indelible upon a man until he goes about with a stubble. I think that if he had not used his razor that day I would have repulsed his advances, and the criminal calendar of the world would have been spared the addition of one murder.|$|E
60|$|At {{his first}} word, she went {{and sat down}} under the porch, at Hollingsworth's feet, entirely {{contented}} and happy. What charm was there in his rude <b>massiveness</b> that so attracted and soothed this shadow-like girl? It appeared to me, who have always been curious in such matters, that Priscilla's vague and seemingly causeless flow of felicitous feeling was that with which love blesses inexperienced hearts, before they begin to suspect {{what is going on}} within them. It transports them to the seventh heaven; and if you ask what brought them thither, they neither can tell nor care to learn, but cherish an ecstatic faith that there they shall abide forever.|$|E
60|$|At {{frequent}} intervals {{along the}} roadside up-rises {{the ruin of}} an ancient tomb. As they stand now, these structures are immensely high and broken mounds of conglomerated brick, stone, pebbles, and earth, all molten by time into a mass as solid and indestructible as if each tomb were composed of a single boulder of granite. When first erected, they were cased externally, no doubt, with slabs of polished marble, artfully wrought bas-reliefs, and all such suitable adornments, and were rendered majestically beautiful by grand architectural designs. This antique splendor has long since been stolen from the dead, to decorate the palaces and churches of the living. Nothing remains to the dishonored sepulchres, except their <b>massiveness.</b>|$|E
60|$|This was {{owing to}} the arrival of the Puritans {{at the bottom of the}} large and wide breach, which had been {{formerly}} made in the wall of the Castle by their victorious cannon. The sight of its gaping heaps of rubbish, and disjointed masses of building, up which slowly winded a narrow and steep path, such as is made amongst ancient ruins by the rare passage of those who occasionally visit them, was calculated, when contrasted with the grey and solid <b>massiveness</b> of the towers and curtains which yet stood uninjured, to remind them of their victory over the stronghold of their enemies, and how they had bound nobles and princes with fetters of iron.|$|E
6000|$|Preoccupied as he was, {{he could}} not help pausing a moment in admiration as he came in front of the workshop. The wide doorway, {{standing}} at the truncated angle of a great block or [...] "isle" [...] of houses, was surmounted by a loggia roofed with fluted tiles, and supported by stone columns with roughly carved capitals. Against the red light framed in by the outline of the fluted tiles and columns stood in black relief the grand figure of Niccolo, with his huge arms in rhythmic rise and fall, first hiding and then disclosing the profile of his firm mouth and powerful brow. Two slighter ebony figures, one at the anvil, the other at the bellows, served to set off his superior <b>massiveness.</b>|$|E
60|$|In {{the course}} of {{about a quarter of}} an hour Mr. Joseph H. Parker reappeared. He came down the room humming a tune and {{apparently}} quite pleased with himself. I took the opportunity of studying his personal appearance a little more closely. He was not tall, but he was distinctly fat. He had a large double chin, but a certain freshness of complexion and <b>massiveness</b> about his forehead relieved his face from any suspicion of grossness. He had a large and humorous mouth, delightful eyes and plentiful eyebrows. His iron-gray hair was brushed carefully back from his forehead. He gave one the idea of strength, notwithstanding the disabilities of his figure. He smiled contentedly as he seated himself once more at my table.|$|E
60|$|A thing must be true, {{or it is}} not {{beautiful}}, {{any more}} than a painted wanton is beautiful, {{any more than a}} sky-scraper is beautiful that is intrinsically and structurally light and that has a false <b>massiveness</b> of pillars plastered on outside. The true sky-scraper is beautiful--and this is the reluctant admission of a man who dislikes humanity-festering cities. The true sky-scraper is beautiful, and it is beautiful in so far as it is true. In its construction it is light and airy, therefore in its appearance it must be light and airy. It dare not, if it wishes to be beautiful, lay claim to what it is not. And it should not bulk on the city-scape like Leviathan; it should rise and soar, light and airy and fairylike.|$|E
60|$|The {{subordinate}} personages, though {{diminished in}} extent and varied in their forms, {{are of a}} similar quality with the hero; a strange mixture of extravagance and true energy. In perusing the work which represents their characters and fates, we are alternately shocked and inspired; there is a perpetual conflict between our understanding and our feelings. Yet the latter on the whole come off victorious. The Robbers is a tragedy that will long find readers to astonish, and, with all its faults, to move. It stands, in our imagination, like some ancient rugged pile of a barbarous age; irregular, fantastic, useless; but grand in its height and <b>massiveness</b> and black frowning strength. It will long remain a singular monument of the early genius and early fortune of its author.|$|E
