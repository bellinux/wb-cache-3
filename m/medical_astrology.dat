25|$|Nicholas Culpeper (probably born at Ockley, Surrey, 18 October 1616 – died at Spitalfields, London, 10 January 1654) was an English botanist, herbalist, physician, and astrologer. His {{published}} books includes The English Physitian (1652), i. e. the Complete Herbal (1653 ff), {{which contains}} a rich store of pharmaceutical and herbal knowledge, and Astrological Judgement of Diseases from the Decumbiture of the Sick (1655), {{which is one}} of the most detailed documents known on the practice of <b>medical</b> <b>astrology</b> in Early Modern Europe.|$|E
25|$|The medieval medical universities' central concept {{concentrated}} on the balance between the humors and “in the substances used for therapeutic purposes”. The curriculum’s secondary concept focused on <b>medical</b> <b>astrology,</b> where celestial events were thought to influence health and disease. The medical curriculum was designed to train practitioners. Teachers of medical students were often successful physicians, practicing in conjunction with teaching. The curriculum of academic medicine was fundamentally based on translated texts and treatises attributed to Hippocrates and Galen as well as Arabic medical texts. The translated works of Hippocrates and Galen were often incomplete, and were mediated with Arabic medical texts for their “independent contributions to treatment and to herbal pharmacology”. Although anatomy was taught in academic medicine through the dissection of cadavers, surgery was largely independent from medical universities. The University of Bologna was the only university to grant degrees in surgery. Academic medicine also focused on actual medical practice where students would study individual cases and observe the professor visiting patients.|$|E
25|$|Mesmer {{was born}} in the village of Iznang, on the shore of Lake Constance in Swabia, Germany, a son of master {{forester}} Anton Mesmer (1701—after 1747) and his wife, Maria/Ursula (née Michel; 1701—1770). After studying at the Jesuit universities of Dillingen and Ingolstadt, he took up the study of medicine at the University of Vienna in 1759. In 1766 he published a doctoral dissertation with the Latin title De planetarum influxu in corpus humanum (On the Influence of the Planets on the Human Body), which discussed the influence of the Moon and the planets on the human body and on disease. This was not <b>medical</b> <b>astrology.</b> Building largely on Isaac Newton's theory of the tides, Mesmer expounded on certain tides in the human body that might be accounted for by the movements of the sun and moon. Evidence assembled by Frank A. Pattie suggests that Mesmer plagiarized a part of his dissertation from a work by Richard Mead, an eminent English physician and Newton's friend. However, in Mesmer's day doctoral theses were not expected to be original.|$|E

Shortly after Witte's death in 1941, Ebertin used Witte's extensive research on astrological midpoints, and a 4th-harmonic [...] "90° dial" [...] developed by the Hamburg School of Astrology as the foundations of his School of Cosmobiology. Ebertin continued to promote astrological research, including <b>medical</b> applications of <b>astrology</b> while non-compliant Hamburg School astrologers were interned by the Third Reich, their books and publications banned.|$|R

5000|$|<b>Medical</b> <b>astrology</b> (traditionally {{known as}} iatromathematics) {{is an ancient}} medical system that {{associates}} {{various parts of the}} body, diseases, and drugs as {{under the influence of the}} sun, moon, and planets, along with the twelve astrological signs. Each of the astrological signs (along with the sun, moon, and planets) is associated with different parts of the human body.|$|E
25|$|During {{the advance}} of Islamic science some of the {{practices}} of astrology were refuted on theological grounds by astronomers such as Al-Farabi (Alpharabius), Ibn al-Haytham (Alhazen) and Avicenna. Their criticisms argued that the methods of astrologers were conjectural rather than empirical, and conflicted with orthodox religious views of Islamic scholars through {{the suggestion that the}} Will of God can be precisely known and predicted in advance. Such refutations mainly concerned 'judicial branches' (such as horary astrology), rather than the more 'natural branches' such as <b>medical</b> and meteorological <b>astrology,</b> these being seen as part of the natural sciences of the time.|$|R

During the reign of Jayaveera Singaiariyan, a writing on <b>medical</b> sciences (Segarajasekaram), <b>astrology</b> (Segarajasekaramalai) and mathematics (Kanakathikaram) were authored by Karivaiya. During the rule of Kunaveera Singaiariyan, a work on medicine known as Pararajasekaram was completed. During Singai Pararasasekaran's rule, an academy for the propagation of Tamil language {{on the model of}} ancient Tamil Sangam's was established in Nallur. This academy performed a useful service in collecting and preserving ancient works in the form of manuscripts in a library called Saraswathy Mahal. Singai Pararasasekaran's cousin Arasakesari is credited with translating the Sanskrit classic Raghuvamsa into Tamil. Among other literary works of historic importance compiled before the arrival of European colonizers, Vaiyapatal, written by Vaiyapuri Aiyar, is well known.|$|R

50|$|The term Cosmobiology as most {{frequently}} used in the English language, refers to the school of astrology founded by Ebertin. The main difference between Witte's Hamburg School and Ebertin's Cosmobiology is that Cosmobiology rejects the hypothetical Trans-Neptunian objects used by the Hamburg School and practitioners of Uranian astrology. Another difference is the significant expansion of Cosmobiology into <b>medical</b> <b>astrology,</b> Dr. Ebertin being a physician.|$|E

5000|$|Judicial astrology {{is the art}} of {{forecasting}} events by {{calculation of}} the planetary and stellar bodies and their relationship to the Earth. The term [...] "judicial astrology" [...] was mainly used in the Middle Ages and early Renaissance to mean the types of astrology that were considered to be heretical by the Catholic church, distinguished from the [...] "natural astrology" [...] such as <b>medical</b> <b>astrology</b> and meteorological astrology, which were seen as acceptable because they were a part of the natural sciences of the time.|$|E

Like Reverchon, Gouchon gravitates around the journal Cahiers Astrologiques (1938-1983) founded by Volguine. We can certainly add the English Francis Rolt-Wheeler (1876-1960), a curious and polyhedral figure, writer and Anglican priest with which Palamidessi held a collaborative relationship.|$|E
5000|$|As {{a source}} of reference, the Tetrabiblos {{is said to have}} [...] "enjoyed almost the {{authority}} of a Bible among the astrological writers of a thousand years or more". It was first translated from Arabic into Latin by Plato of Tivoli (Tiburtinus) in 1138, while he was in Spain. The Tetrabiblos is an extensive and continually reprinted treatise on the ancient principles of horoscopic astrology. That it did not quite attain the unrivaled status of the Almagest was, perhaps, because it did not cover some popular areas of the subject, particularly electional astrology (interpreting astrological charts for a particular moment to determine the outcome of a course of action to be initiated at that time), and <b>medical</b> <b>astrology,</b> which were later adoptions.|$|E
50|$|Jan Franco (active 1586-1611) was a physician, {{mathematician}} and astronomer who compiled almanacs. He {{was born}} in the village of Eersel in the Duchy of Brabant and studied medicine at the University of Leuven. He settled in Brussels to practice medicine and was given the freedom of the city. He was a practicing physician at least until 1594. As he had studied both medicine and mathematics, he was asked to calculate the ephemerides, for purposes of <b>medical</b> <b>astrology.</b> This led to his work as a compiler of almanacs from 1586 to 1611. From 1612 almanacs were printed {{on the basis of his}} drafts but completed for publication by his son, Jan Franco jr., and by Johannes Regius. As late as 1616 almanacs prepared by others were being sold on the strength of his name.|$|E
50|$|In the Middle Ages {{natural astrology}} was mainly {{focused on the}} {{diagnosis}} and the treatment of medical patients. For more information on this, see the article on <b>medical</b> <b>astrology.</b> An additional use {{would have been the}} application of astrology to determine future weather patterns based on the Aristotelian/Ptolemaic rationale that the planets cause change in the sublunary world by producing an efflux of elements and qualities. Every other branch was lumped together into the heading of 'judicial astrology'. These included natal astrology, mundane astrology, horary astrology, and electional astrology. Judicial astrology is an obsolete category, because since the Middle Ages other sciences have arisen, astrology has ceased to be a tool in medicine and meteorology, and scientifically demonstrable parts of natural astrology such as the moon's effect on tides are considered to be physics not astrology.|$|E

50|$|The {{foundations}} of the theoretical structure used in astrology originate with the Babylonians, although widespread usage did not occur till {{the start of the}} Hellenistic period after Alexander the great swept through Greece. It was not known to the Babylonians that the constellations are not on a celestial sphere and are very far apart. The appearance of them being close is illusory. The exact demarcation of what a constellation is, is cultural, and varied between civilisations. Ptolemy's work on astronomy was driven to some extent by the desire, like all astrologers of the time, to easily calculate the planetary movements. Early western astrology operated under the ancient Greek concepts of the Macrocosm and microcosm; and thus <b>medical</b> <b>astrology</b> related what happened to the planets and other objects in the sky to medical operations. This provided a further motivator for the study of astronomy. While still defending the practice of astrology, Ptolemy acknowledged that the predictive power of astronomy for the motion of the planets and other celestial bodies ranked above astrological predictions.|$|E
5000|$|In 1609 Roberti wrote a reply, his Brevis anatome, to a 1608 work of Rudolph Goclenius on <b>medical</b> <b>astrology</b> from a Paracelsian perspective, {{that had}} {{mentioned}} a weapon salve (a type of sympathetic magic). Roberti {{objected to the}} efficacy of the weapon salve being attributed to purely natural causes. He called the explanation of Goclenius necromantic, and a confusion of natural magic with other kinds. Goclenius replied by listing 45 kinds of [...] "evil magic", and 24 effects that had been achieved by a magus, and could not be explained by natural causes. A pamphlet war continued; in 1621 Goclenius died, but Johannes Baptista van Helmont then published the same year his De magnetica vulnerum curatione, a severe attack on Roberti as well as critical of Goclenius who (in his opinion) had a simplistic view. The attacks of Roberti had some effects: van Helmont went through an examination by the Inquisition, and some sideblows against the Rosicrucians he made in 1618 were picked up in 1623 by Marin Mersenne and Jean Boucher.|$|E
40|$|In the Latin Middle Ages, the {{understanding}} of the body was significantly influenced by the theory and practice of astrology. The cycles of the body, from birth to death, from health to illness, were assumed to be governed by the cycles of the cosmos. This paper considers the somewhat inchoate doctrines of late medieval <b>medical</b> <b>astrology</b> and these interlocking cycles of life. Since this is, by any measure, a capacious theme, it is illumined by examples taken largely from one source, namely Cambridge, Trinity College MS O. 5. 26. This manuscript is a large and representative collection of Middle English translations of works on most of the recognised branches of astrology which was probably written some time between 1385 and 1405 that may, one time, have belonged to New College, Oxford. There were two main varieties of <b>medical</b> <b>astrology</b> practiced in the Latin Middle Ages: a lunar medicine which aimed to balance the humours; and a scientific astrological medicine which owed more to the Hellenic and Arabic tradition...|$|E
