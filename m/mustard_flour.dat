In {{spite of the}} advantageous chemical composition and colloid-chemical properties, the use of <b>mustard</b> seed <b>flour</b> is limited in food industry or in animal feeding because of its pungent taste. The pungent taste develops through the action of myrosinase; {{but it could be}} eliminated by heat inactivation of the enzyme. In the course of our preliminary experiments, it was observed that heat inactivation of the myrosinase enzyme depended on mustard variety. The heat stability of myrosinase enzyme prepared from different mustard varieties was examined and compared in our research work. Crude myrosinase was prepared from three mustard genotypes (Budakalászi, Tilney, and LM- 1 (a low erucic acid content cultivar) and the heat stability was determined at 60, 70 or 80 °C for 5, 10, 15, 20 and 30 min. The semi-logarithmic plots of myrosinase activity as a function of time at different temperatures indicated that heat inactivation of crude myrosinase enzyme follows first-order kinetics. Characterising the rate of inactivation by the slope of the curve, significant differences were established in heat stability between genotypes at 60 °C.

40|$|Common bunt (Tilletia caries, Tilletia foetida) is a {{fungal disease}} {{with a large}} ability to spread. Consequences may be {{rejection}} of grains for sale or even a large decrease of yield. Different trials were carried out in organic farming in a research project (funded by the French Ministry of Agriculture between 2008 and 2011) to achieve a better control of common bunt. Results confirm that the resistance of wheat cultivars is a factor to consider. Despite most varieties currently cultivated in organic farming are sensitive to common bunt, some cultivars appeared to be resistant to the races tested. Concerning seed treatment, no product is available for organic farming and 100 % efficient; but several solutions have been identified. Only one product is currently authorized for common bunt control on cereals (cerall), it has a significant but sometimes irregular efficiency. Products with acetic acid (white vinegar) or with a base of <b>mustard</b> <b>flour</b> (Tillecur) have similar results. Copper products at low level (reduced to about 500 g Cu/t) give a very good level of protection.

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{validity}} of the protein digestibility-corrected amino acid score (PDCAAS) method in predicting the quality of fourteen protein products was compared with the commonly used protein quality methods, protein efficiency ratio (RER) and net protein ratio (NPR). A rat growth and balance {{study was conducted to}} determine protein digestibility and quality of the animal and vegetable protein products by the PER and NPR methods. Amino acid compositions of the products were also determined, and PDCAAS were calculated using a rat and a human pattern of amino acid requirements. Compared to the biological methods, the scoring method overestimated protein quality of <b>mustard</b> <b>flour</b> [PDCAAS of 84 – 92 % vs. relative PER (RPER) or relative NPR (RNPR) of 0], raw black beans (PDCAAS of 45 – 72 % vs. RPER or RNPR of 0), alkaline-treated lactalbumin and soybean protein isolate (PDCAAS of 44 – 67 % vs. RPER or RNPR of 0) and heated skim milk (PDCAAS of 29 – 31 % vs. RPER and RNPR of 0 – 5 %). The scoring method also overestimated the protein quality of zein (true protein digestibility of 63 %) supplemented with Lys, Met, Thr and Trp (PDCAAS of 63 – 71 % vs. RPER and RNPR of 3 – 44 %). These data demonstrate that the PDCAAS method is inappropriate for predicting protein quality of those protein sources which may contain naturally occurring growth-depressing factors or antinutritional factors formed during alkaline and/or heat processing.
