40|$|High {{speed is}} always a {{desirable}} feature of public transportation services. Any measure that increases public transport speeds results in benefits to users in tenns of saved travel time, and benefits to the operator in reduced operating costs and in eventual reduction of fleet size. At the same time, {{it is known that}} some major efforts for increasing speeds, often involving considerable cost (such as increasing <b>maximum</b> <b>technical</b> speed of vehicles) result in relatively small increases in average passenger travel speed. This problem is common for a number of different modes of transportation. An excellent example can be found in air transporta­tion; increases of aircraft cruising speed are costly and have relatively little impact on the passenger average travel speeds, particularly for short-and medium-haul trips. The same problem is observed with both rapid and surface transit in urban areas. In order to derive more specific results applicable in practice, this research is limited to the latter transportation systems: public transportation in urban areas...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{provides}} {{an analysis of}} the current energy usage (net energy and final energy by fuels) and associated carbon dioxide (CO 2) emissions of the Swedish residential building stock, which includes single-family dwellings and multi-family dwellings. Twelve energy saving measures (ESMs) are assessed using a bottom–up modeling methodology, in which the Swedish residential stock is represented by a sample of 1400 buildings (based on data from the year 2005). Application of the ESMs studied gives a <b>maximum</b> <b>technical</b> reduction potential in energy demand of 53 %, corresponding to a 63 % reduction in CO 2 emissions. Although application of the investigated ESMs would reduce CO 2 emissions, the measures that reduce electricity consumption for lighting and appliances (LA) will increase CO 2 emissions, since the saved electricity production is less CO 2 -intensive than the fuel mix used for the increased space heating required {{to make up for the}} loss in indirect heating obtained from LA...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an assessment of}} the current biomass energy potential in Colombia including a detailed literature review, a discussion of the assessment methodology, a section of results and an uncertainty analysis. The results of a thorough literature review suggest that despite various assessments being available {{there is a lack of}} studies estimating coherently the entire energy potential of all biomass categories relevant to Colombia, namely agricultural residues, animal waste, forestry and wood industry, biofuels and urban waste. Although similar approaches were used across studies, inconsistencies in methodologies, assumptions and statistics were found. This led to large differences in results. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to present a consistent methodology to estimate the entire energy potential of all biomass categories relevant to Colombia and to harmonize approaches and assumptions to allow a meaningful comparison to existing assessment studies. Additionally, the reliability of the predictions is estimated and the sources of uncertainty are identified. Results predict a theoretical energy potential of 0. 84 EJ and a <b>maximum</b> <b>technical</b> potential of 0. 16 EJ in 2010, which might account for 3. 2 % of the annual primary energy production (4. 93 EJ) ...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Irrigated rice in {{the state}} of Rio Grande do Sul (Brazil) has shown {{significant}} growth in yield in recent years due to improved management practices, especially in regard to fertilizer use. However, the response curves that led to the current fertilizer recommendations do not consider integrated systems prevailing in rice-producing regions that have adopted the practice of integrated crop-livestock systems. The aim {{of the present study was}} to evaluate the effectiveness of current fertilizer recommendations for irrigated rice in lowland soils in Rio Grande do Sul under integrated crop-livestock systems for different periods of time. The experiments were performed in the 2012 / 2013 growing season on four farms {{in the state}} with different forage species under cattle grazing. In these areas, fertilizer recommendations were made based on previous soil analyses, and treatments consisted of fractions of the currently recommended application rates. At the end of the crop cycle, the percentages of <b>maximum</b> <b>technical</b> efficiency (PMTE) and maximum economic efficiency (PMEE) of NPK fertilizers, and increases in yield and net income provided by PMEE were determined.

The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the behavior of two cowpea cultivars fertilized with four doses of Zn (0. 0, 2. 0, 4. 0, and 6. 0 kg of Zn ha- 1) regarding dry grain yield (PGS), in addition to quantifying leaf and grain Zn content and grain crude protein.

The tested cultivars of cowpea showed no great difference regarding Zn demand applied to the soil, ranging from 3. 2 to 3. 4 kg of Zn ha- 1 for BRS Tumucumaque and BRS Guariba, respectively. Concerning Zn use efficiency, BRS Guariba was more responsive than was BRS Tumucumaque, i. e. the same dose of Zn produced 70 kg grain and 2. 1 kg crude protein per hectare...|$|R

40|$|Renewable energy forms {{have been}} widely used in the past decades {{highlighting}} a "green" shift in energy production. An actual reason behind this turn to renewable energy production is EU directives which set the Union's targets for energy production from renewable sources, greenhouse gas emissions and increase in energy efficiency.

Towards the fulfillment of 20 - 20 - 20 EU targets, in Greece a specific strategy which promotes the construction of large scale Renewable Energy Source plants is promoted.

One focal point in current microproduction research and engineering is the design and development of high-precision microassembly and microadjustment equipment capable of operating {{within the framework of}} flexible automated industrial production. As well as these developments, suitable microassembly tools for industrial use also need to be equipped with interfaces for the supply and delivery of microcomponents. The microassembly process necessitates the supply of microparts in a geometrically defined manner.

The Maximum Likelihood Estimate (MLE) of {{the parameters of the}} stochastic frontier production function of sole cowpea farmers revealed that, farm size, family labour and agrochemicals were significant and positively related to cowpea output.
