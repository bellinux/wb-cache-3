The simulation is divided in two; first a large scale {{simulation of}} the main geometry is performed and then a microscale simulation of the structural details using the pressure from the large scale simulation as a boundary condition.

However, the shear thinning within the microfeatures helps replication significantly. The shear stress at the wall is in the lower range of where wall slip has been reported to occur for other polymer melts.

40|$|Abstract—Connectionist natural {{language}} processing models that consider the temporal extension of sentence analysis often make use of local representation, allocating only one unit for each word at the input and output layers of the connectionist architecture. Thus, for increasing the lexicon, it is mandatory to modify the architecture and re-train the network. On the other hand, the proposed system Pred-DR attempts to predict the next word in declarative sentences presented sequentially one word at a time, giving meaning to the units of the connectionist architecture by means of distributed representations based on semantic features. The words are fractionated into their semantic <b>microfeature</b> arrays. Consequently, Pred-DR is able to generalize to new words without {{increasing the number of}} processors in its architecture, provided that their semantic features are supplied. This way, it is achieved a considerable performance on connectionist {{natural language}} processing using the classical semantic <b>microfeature</b> framework. The system learns to relate the input word array to its possible next word, “remembering ” the previous words seen before in a semantically sound sentence.

40|$|Graduation date: 2015 Access {{restricted}} to the OSU Community, at author's request, from Jan. 7, 2015 - Jan. 7, 2016 Two-phase flows in microtechnology based devices are purposefully present in multiphase reactors, phase separators, analytical devices and others. Two-phase flows can also be an undesirable side effect occurring during operation due to phase transitions or, more commonly, introduction of surrounding air through equipment gaps and with process feed. In both cases, the two phases require control to achieve desired system performance. Devices with <b>microfeatures</b> such as posts and pillars represent relatively unexplored design direction {{with the potential for}} successful fulfillment of various multi-phase flows objectives. Efficient design of <b>microfeatured</b> devices requires computational tools. However, the importance of two-phase interface physics imposes high resolution computing, which when combined with usual microtechnology high-aspect ratios results in large computational efforts. Multiscale modeling provides a means for preserving accuracy while lowering computational costs. This thesis proposes a novel multiscale modeling approach for modeling microarchitectures with <b>microfeatures.</b> The main idea of the approach is to enable numerical simulations of two-phase flows in <b>microfeatured</b> architectures without resolving the actual <b>microfeatures.</b> Effect of <b>microfeatures</b> presence is incorporated through a coupling operator, vector, or scalar field. Removal of <b>microfeatures</b> allows for modeling with significantly coarser computational grids with grid size being limited by the smallest droplet sizes. Multiscale modeling approach is accompanied by a piecewise modeling concept in which characterization of the entire microarchitecture is performed with smaller, and hence computationally less intensive, representative domains. Piecewise modeling {{can be used as a}} replacement for full-size architecture simulations in multiscale modeling but can also serve as an independent modeling tool. The basic framework of the proposed approach is developed based on the example of droplet retention times in <b>microfeatured</b> architectures. This approach is successfully incorporated into Shan and Chen Lattice Boltzmann method, validated and applied to three different architectures. Demonstrated are the capabilities and challenges of the proposed multiscale modeling approach. Viability and potential improvements of piecewise modeling are also confirmed...|$|R

40|$|The {{freezing}} {{problem in}} the injection molding filling stage not only deteriorates the quality of molded parts, but also results in difficulty in molding new-generation plastic parts that are rich in extremely thin-wall sections and <b>microfeatures.</b> A rapid thermal response (RTR) molding process was developed to overcome the freezing problem. In RTR molding, the mold surface can be heated from room temperature to over 200 °C in several seconds and cooled to the ejection temperature within the normal cycle time. Although the RTR technology {{can be used in}} numerous applications, the ideas and findings reported in this thesis were collected and organized towards increasing moldability of high-aspect-ratio <b>microfeatures.</b> Changes of molding characteristics as parts become thinner and smaller were studied in both simulations and experiments. In conventional molding, the molding difficulty drastically increases as the thickness reduces. A polymer melt thinner than 0. 25 mm tends to copy the mold temperature in a tenth of a second, thus resulting in premature freezing when molding high-aspect-ratio ultra-thin sections and <b>microfeatures.</b> In contrast, the melt in RTR molding does not freeze, and therefore can fill an extremely long and thin path. A concept of scalable filling under isothermal molding condition was presented to address the benefit of the RTR molding process. Experimental results of high-aspect-ratio micro wells, injection molded with variable RTR heating temperature, were discussed. With the conventional mold temperature, the molded depth is less that 5 % of the to-be-copied one. A sharp increase in the replicated depth was observed near the polymer melting temperature. For high-density polyethylene, complete replication of the micro wells was achieved with a 2 -s heating duration and a total cycle time of 15 seconds. Another area explored in this research is micro filling simulation. The standard simulation scheme was modified to include microscale effects. The simulation results indicate the importance in employing size-dependent viscosity and wall slip to predicate micro filling behaviors. Development of integrated technology for replicating <b>microfeatures</b> with simulation capability will push the current technical envelope of micro injection molding further into those areas that have so far been predominated by etching- and lithography-based fabrications. ...|$|R

Plant organs {{at different stages of}} decomposition and amorphous organic matter were observed by optical microscopy in all samples. SOM <b>microfeature</b> distribution, size of SOM features and the relation with the C-to-N ratio suggested that amorphous features could be the end-products of organ transformation. SEM-EDS elemental analysis showed that amorphous material had higher Si/C, Al/C and Fe/C molar ratios than organs, clearly pointing to interactions with the soil inorganic phases, which contributed to SOM stabilisation. Soil porosity coupled with water stagnation seemed to affect the Fe-SOM interactions as a greater proportion of small water retention pores (10 - 50 μm) was associated with higher abundance of Fe-rich amorphous organic features. The higher chemical stability of amorphous features was confirmed by oxidation. After NaClO treatment, organs were almost totally removed, while amorphous organic material was less affected both morphologically and chemically. Our results demonstrate that in water-affected soils local environment defined by the pore system affects the distribution of SOM microfeatures and that the highest resistance to oxidation of the amorphous features is attributable to the formation of organic-inorganic associations.

This study aims to investigate the effects of variotherm process, cavity evacuation and their interaction on the production of a microfluidic filter for biomedical applications, revealed the importance of these moulding technologies in enhancing part filling and the replication quality for high aspect ratio features...|$|R
40|$|There is {{shift in}} trend towards {{the use of}} high quality {{polymers}} as the base material in manufacturing microfluidic chips. In this paper, an amorphous metallic alloy mold insert was used in a micro injection-molding process to fabricate microfluidic features onto cyclic-olefin-copolymer (COC) material. The insert and fabricated samples were compared {{in terms of the}} geometry and surface roughness attained. Findings indicate that replication, in general, was possible but the <b>microfeatures</b> formed had significant flashing and tearing at the edges. Singapore-MIT Alliance (SMA...|$|R
