500|$|The band {{supplemented}} {{these older}} country standards and Dylan covers {{with a couple}} of contemporary country songs: Merle Haggard's maudlin convict's lament, [...] "Life in Prison"; and Luke McDaniel's [...] "You're Still On My Mind", a sorrowful tale of a heartbroken drunkard failing to find solace {{at the bottom of a}} bottle. [...] Additionally, the Byrds gave William Bell's Stax hit, [...] "You Don't <b>Miss</b> <b>Your</b> Water", a country flavored make-over, highlighted by the band's trademark crystal clear harmonies and contributions from JayDee Maness and Earl P. Ball, on pedal steel guitar and honky-tonk piano respectively. [...] With its fusion of country and soul, [...] "You Don't <b>Miss</b> <b>Your</b> Water" [...] was a perfect example of what Parsons would later define, with his self-coined phrase, as [...] "Cosmic American Music".|$|E
500|$|During the credits, {{there is}} a final cut scene between Amelia and an Old Coot first {{introduced}} earlier in the campaign. At first, his comments regarding how her family must be proud of her seem out of place—then he makes {{a reference to the}} Circle and how she was able to defeat them in only one lifetime, hinting that he is indeed the original Morgan Black. [...] As the Old Coot walks away, his voice grows deeper with a more exaggerated Scottish accent, further supporting this idea. [...] It appears he has lived longer than the average person because he drank from the Fountain of Youth after Act I. Amelia then asks what he just said, he replies with a knowing, [...] "Don't <b>miss</b> <b>your</b> train," [...] and then he walks away.|$|E
500|$|The three {{songs that}} had their lead vocals {{replaced}} by McGuinn were [...] "The Christian Life", [...] "You Don't <b>Miss</b> <b>Your</b> Water", and [...] "One Hundred Years from Now", {{with the last}} featuring McGuinn and Hillman sharing vocals on the final album version. [...] However, Parsons' lead vocals weren't completely eradicated from these songs and can still be faintly heard, despite having either McGuinn or Hillman's voice overdubbed on them. [...] The master recordings of these three songs, with their original Parsons' vocals restored to full prominence, were finally issued as part of The Byrds box set in 1990. [...] These same master recordings, featuring Parsons' lead vocals, [...] were also included as bonus tracks on disc one of the 2003 Legacy Edition of Sweetheart of the Rodeo.|$|E

500|$|Rasputin's {{friendship}} with the imperial children {{was evident in the}} messages he sent to them. [...] "My Dear Pearl M!" [...] Rasputin wrote the nine-year-old Maria in one telegram in 1908. [...] "Tell me how you talked with the sea, with nature! I <b>miss</b> <b>your</b> simple soul. We will see each other soon! A big kiss." [...] In a second telegram, Rasputin told the child, [...] "My Dear M! My Little Friend! May the Lord help you to carry your cross with wisdom and joy in Christ. This world is like the day, look it's already evening. So it is with the cares of the world." [...] In February 1909, Rasputin sent all of the imperial children a telegram, advising them to [...] "Love the whole of God's nature, the whole of His creation in particular this earth. The Mother of God was always occupied with flowers and needlework." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{returning}} to California, the Byrds' released the Sweetheart of the Rodeo album on August 30, 1968, almost eight weeks after Parsons {{had left the}} band. [...] It comprised a mixture of country music standards and contemporary country material, along with a country reworking of William Bell's soul hit [...] "You Don't <b>Miss</b> <b>Your</b> Water". [...] The album also included the Parsons originals [...] "Hickory Wind" [...] and [...] "One Hundred Years from Now", along with the Bob Dylan-penned songs [...] "Nothing Was Delivered" [...] and [...] "You Ain't Goin' Nowhere", the latter {{of which had been}} a moderately successful single. [...] Although it was not the first country rock album, Sweetheart of the Rodeo was the first album widely labeled as country rock to be released by an internationally successful rock act, pre-dating Dylan's Nashville Skyline by over six months. [...] The first bona fide country rock album overall is often cited as being Parsons' earlier Safe at Home, which he recorded with his group the International Submarine Band.|$|E
500|$|Parsons' {{dominance}} {{over the}} band waned still further during post-production for Sweetheart of the Rodeo, when his {{appearance on the}} album was contested by music business impresario Lee Hazlewood, who alleged that the singer was still under contract to his LHI record label, creating legal complications for Columbia Records. [...] As a result of this, McGuinn and Hillman replaced Parsons' lead vocals on the songs [...] "You Don't <b>Miss</b> <b>Your</b> Water", [...] "The Christian Life", and [...] "One Hundred Years from Now" [...] before the legal problems could be resolved. [...] However, album producer Gary Usher would later put a different slant on the events surrounding the removal of Parsons' vocals by telling his biographer Stephen J. McParland that the alterations to the album arose out of creative concerns, not legal ones; Usher and the band were both worried that Parsons' contributions were dominating the record and so, his vocals were excised {{in an attempt to}} increase McGuinn and Hillman's presence on the album. [...] In the album's final running order, Parsons is still featured as lead vocalist on the songs [...] "You're Still on My Mind", [...] "Life in Prison", and [...] "Hickory Wind".|$|E

500|$|The {{love song}} [...] "I've Been Loving You Too Long" [...] was co-written by Redding and The Impressions' lead singer Jerry Butler {{in a hotel}} near the Atlanta airport. Redding's {{rendition}} of Cooke's [...] "Shake" [...] is again more funky. The song is about the club dancing in the so-called discothèques, which debuted in the early 1960s. The song was described as [...] "a hard-swinging, full-throated 2:40 of precision ferocity with a force that would flat-out explode during his live sets." [...] The last five songs are all covers by popular artists: The Temptations' [...] "My Girl", written by Smokey Robinson and Ronald White; Cooke's [...] "Wonderful World"; B.B. King's [...] "Rock Me Baby"; The Rolling Stones' [...] "Satisfaction", on which Redding sings [...] "fashion" [...] instead of [...] "faction"; and William Bell's [...] "You Don't <b>Miss</b> <b>Your</b> Water", which was characterized as [...] "sorrowful country blues", and has [...] "one of the most devastating pleading-man lead vocals in the entire Stax catalog." [...] "Satisfaction" [...] sounded so plausible that a journalist even accused the Stones of stealing the song from Redding, and that they performed it after Redding. Music writer Robert Christgau describes it as an [...] "anarchic reading" [...] of the Stones' original.|$|E
2500|$|On 6 November 1984, they {{recorded}} Field of Glass, a three track 12" [...] EP, mostly live in BBC Studio 5 in London, {{which was}} issued in February 1985. The title track, [...] "Field of Glass", was not released on CD as the master tape {{could not be}} found—it was eventually discovered under David McComb's bed. During the Australian tour in early 1985, the band acquired their final permanent member, Lee, who had performed on the mini-album Lawson Square Infirmary. Together the six-piece—Birt, Casey, Lee, MacDonald, David & Robert McComb—recorded a 12" [...] EP You Don’t <b>Miss</b> <b>Your</b> Water. The A-side is a countrified version of William Bell's [...] "You Don't <b>Miss</b> <b>Your</b> Water", which was released in August by Hot Records, but by then they were already back in London.|$|E
2500|$|Between January 1962 and December 1964, Stax and Volt {{released}} several chart hits each by Otis Redding, Rufus Thomas, and Booker T. and the M.G.'s. However, despite {{dozens of}} other releases, only three other Stax/Volt singles charted during this time, and all just barely: William Bell's [...] "You Don't <b>Miss</b> <b>Your</b> Water" [...] hit #95 in early 1962; the Mar-Keys' [...] "Pop-Eye Stroll" [...] hit #94 in mid-1962 (although {{it was a big}} hit in Canada, hitting #1 on Toronto's CHUM Chart), and Barbara & the Browns' [...] "Big Party" [...] made it to #97 in mid-1964.|$|E
