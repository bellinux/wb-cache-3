50|$|The {{industrial}} {{history of}} the site begins in 1836, when the land and water rights were purchased by Benjamin Carrick, who built a log cabin on the site. Carrick also built a stone dam (portions of which still survive above the wooden dam), and began operating a sawmill and tannery. The site was abandoned sometime after 1850, and was restarted in the early 1870s by Alexander Jack, who built {{the core of the}} current dam and the surviving mill building. Jack operated a variety of industrial businesses, including dying, machining, and blacksmithing on the site. A water turbine was installed on the site in the early 20th century, and was an early provider of electrical power to the village of Barnet. The property was owned by Ben Thresher from 1947 until his death in 1994, and at that time included operational water-powered <b>machine</b> <b>equipment</b> and infrastructure.|$|E
5000|$|Malm {{grew up in}} Cleveland and {{completed}} a degree at Denison University in Mass Media Communications, with a minor in film. During this time, he managed his university radio station. He knew {{at an early age}} that he wanted to work in the music industry. He was inspired to aim towards artist management after meeting Todd Rundgren's manager, Eric Gardner, to organise an interview for his radio station. After graduation, Malm worked in his family's <b>machine</b> <b>equipment</b> business by day and by night was a part-time promoter of local music acts, including the Exotic Birds, Lucky Pierre and System 56. He left the family business to manage the Birds full-time, in which Reznor was a [...] "bit player". Malm quit in 1987 due to differences in artistic direction, and Reznor also quit shortly afterward. He took on Reznor as his client informally, without a written contract, after hearing some of Reznor's demo work that the latter had recorded independently at Right Track Studio.|$|E

50|$|Conceived {{since the}} years 1940s, {{the route of}} Line 4-Yellow was present in all studies for {{deployment}} of the Metro in São Paulo since. This road was consolidated in 1968 when the initial studies {{for the implementation of}} the current subway network, receiving at that time, the name of Southeast-Southwest Line. In parable form, would connect the neighborhoods of Pinheiros and Sacomã, from Jóquei Clube station to Via Anchieta station, through the Downtown, cutting East-West line of the Metro in República and Pedro II stations. Integration platforms came to be built in those two stations, but were not used. The Republic station platforms, built in the 1980s, with a further configuration of line 4, would be demolished for the passage of the tunneling <b>machine,</b> <b>equipment</b> that built the tunnel of Line 4 between Faria Lima and Luz stations, those from Pedro II station became a depôt.

50|$|The boiler and the <b>machine</b> <b>equipment</b> were {{designed}} by Professor Dr. Gustav Bauer. Bremen had four airtight boiler rooms. The combustion air for the oil burners of the boilers was blown into the boiler rooms by eight steam turbine blowers. The resulting positive pressure meant that the boiler rooms were only accessible through airlocks. The steam was generated in 20 oil-fired water tube boilers, eleven double-enders and nine single-enders in four banks fired {{by a total of}} 227 oil burners. The operating pressure was 23 atm = 24 bar with a steam temperature at the superheater discharge of 370 C. The maximum steam generating capacity was 500 tons/h. For harbour operation three boilers with their own blower were available, so that during work periods the main boiler airlocks could remain open. The total heating surface amounted to 17,050 m2, the superheater surface 3,875 m2 and the air preheater surface 8,786 m2. The feed water was preheated to 130 C and the fuel oil consumption was 33 tons/h or 380 g/HP/h or 800 tons/day, fed from oil bunkers with a capacity of 7,552 tons.|$|E
