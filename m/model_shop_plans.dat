40|$|Blended {{commerce}} involves all commerce {{experiences in}} which customers {{make use of}} different channels (online, offline and mobile) for their purchases to take advantages {{with respect to their}} needs and attitudes. This new e-commerce trend is typically characterized by so-called loyalty programmes such as coupons and system points. These mechanisms can be extremely useful for the companies to achieve customer retention and for the customers to obtain discounts. However, loyalty programmes can complicate for customers the evaluation of all offers and the selection of optimal providers (<b>shopping</b> <b>plan)</b> for buying the desired set of products. To face this problem, referred as <b>Shopping</b> <b>Plan</b> Problem, optimization algorithms are emerging as a suitable methodology. This paper is aimed at performing a systematic comparison amongst three bio-inspired optimization approaches, genetic algorithms, memetic ones and ant colony optimization, to detect the best performer for solving the <b>shopping</b> <b>plan</b> problem in a blended shopping scenario. © 2015 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelber...|$|R

40|$|This work {{describes}} {{an approach to}} synergistically exploit ambient intelligence technologies, mobile devices, and evolutionary computation {{in order to support}} blended commerce or ubiquitous commerce scenarios. The work proposes a software architecture consisting of three main components: linked data for e-commerce, cloud-based services, and mobile apps. The three components implement a scenario where a shopping mall is presented as an intelligent environment in which customers use NFC capabilities of their smartphones in order to handle e-coupons produced, suggested, and consumed by the abovesaid environment. The main function of the intelligent environment is to help customers define <b>shopping</b> <b>plans,</b> which minimize the overall shopping cost by looking for best prices, discounts, and coupons. The paper proposes a genetic algorithm to find suboptimal solutions for the <b>shopping</b> <b>plan</b> problem in a highly dynamic context, where the final cost of a product for an individual customer is dependent on his previous purchases. In particular, the work provides details on the <b>Shopping</b> <b>Plan</b> software prototype and some experimentation results showing the overall performance of the genetic algorithm...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine baby boomers' {{shopping}} behaviours and to investigate their relationships with demographics and personal values. A questionnaire concerning shopping behaviours, personal values and demographics was mailed to a random sample of 2975 people aged 40 - 70 years in Victoria, Australia. Usable questionnaires of 1031 were obtained. Structural equation modelling was employed for data analyses. The analyses revealed that demographics and personal values influenced shopping behaviours via different pathways among male and female baby boomers. For example, self-direction positively impacted on <b>shopping</b> <b>planning</b> for men but negatively influenced price minimization for women. Among women only, age was positively related to <b>shopping</b> <b>planning</b> and negatively to price minimization. Thus, both personal values and demographics influenced baby boomers' shopping behaviours. Since values are more likely to be amenable to change than demographics, segmentation of the population via value orientations would facilitate targeted interventions to promote healthy food shopping...|$|R

50|$|In 1968, after Columbia Pictures gave Demy {{a lucrative}} offer to shoot his first film in America, Demy and his wife, the film {{director}} Agnes Varda, moved to Los Angeles {{for a brief}} spell. Demys end product was a naturalistic drama: 1969s <b>Model</b> <b>Shop.</b> Lola (Anouk Aimée) reappears, her dreams shattered, her life having taken {{a turn for the}} worse. Abandoned by her husband Michel for a female gambler named Jackie Demaistre (Jeanne Moreaus character from Bay of Angels), Lola is scrounging to make enough money to return to France and her child, by working as a nudie model in a backdoor model-shop on the Sunset Strip. She runs into an aimless young architect Gary Lockwood, who navigates the streets of Los Angeles; like Lola, he is looking for love and meaning in life. <b>Model</b> <b>Shop</b> is a time capsule of late 1960s Los Angeles, and documents the death of the hippie movement, the Vietnam draft, and the ennui and misery that results from broken relationships. This bleakness and decided lack of whimsy—uncharacteristic for Demy—had a large amount to do with <b>Model</b> <b>Shops</b> critical and commercial failure.|$|R
