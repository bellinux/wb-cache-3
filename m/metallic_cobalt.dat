MethodsA quasi-parallel study was conducted at the dental clinic, Faculty of Dentistry at Al-Azhar University-Assiut Branch in Egypt. Fifty healthy participants with complete dentures {{were enrolled in the}} study. The enrolled patients were grouped into two main batches: three groups in batch one and two groups in batch two. The three groups in the first batch received three different denture base materials (flexible acrylic resin, heat cure acrylic resin, and chrome <b>cobalt</b> <b>metallic</b> base). The two groups in batch two received different types of teeth (acrylic and porcelain teeth). The five groups completed a questionnaire composed of items pertaining to demographic characteristics, and the researcher obtained data about phonetics. ResultsThe sound level was significantly higher in the group of dentures constructed of chrome <b>cobalt</b> <b>metallic</b> base in comparison to the other materials. Additionally, the sound level in porcelain teeth was significantly higher than that in acrylic teeth. The material used to construct teeth was one of the major determinants influencing phonetics.

50|$|Sintered {{tungsten}} carbide cutting tools are very abrasion resistant {{and can also}} withstand higher temperatures than standard high-speed steel tools. Carbide cutting surfaces are often used for machining through materials such as carbon steel or stainless steel, and in situations where other tools would wear away, such as high-quantity production runs. Because carbide tools maintain a sharp cutting edge better than other tools, they generally produce a better finish on parts, and their temperature resistance allows faster machining. The material is usually called cemented carbide, hardmetal or tungsten-carbide cobalt: it is a metal matrix composite, where {{tungsten carbide}} particles are the aggregate, and <b>metallic</b> <b>cobalt</b> serves as the matrix. Manufacturers use tungsten carbide as the main material in some high-speed drill bits, as it can resist high temperatures and is extremely hard.|$|E

50|$|The ores {{are treated}} by a sulfatizing roast in a {{fluidized}} bed furnace to convert copper and cobalt sulfides into soluble oxides and iron into insoluble hematite.

A part of the spent electrolyte enters the cobalt recovery circuit and is purified by the removal of iron, copper, nickel, and zinc prior to the precipitation of cobalt as its hydroxide. This is accomplished by the addition of more lime to raise the pH until the remaining copper precipitates. This copper is sent back to the copper circuit. As more lime is then added, a copper-cobaltite precipitates and is fed back to the leaching process. Sodium hydrosulfide (NaHS) is added (along with some <b>metallic</b> <b>cobalt</b> as a catalyst) to precipitate nickel sulfide (NiS). Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) and sodium carbonate (Na2CO3) are then added to precipitate zinc sulfide (ZnS). Lime is then added to saturation to precipitate cobalt(II) hydroxide (Co(OH)2). In the final stages, this cobalt hydroxide is redissolved and the metal is refined by electrolysis. The resulting cobalt cathodes are crushed and vacuum degassed to obtain a pure cobalt metal.|$|E

These fundamental spectra, which are the isotropic spectrum, spin spectrum, magnetic circular dichroism, spin-orbit spectrum, anisotropic spectrum, and anisotropic spin spectrum give {{the correlation between the}} spin, orbital, and quadrupole momenta in the ground state and spin and orbit of the hole created after photoemission.
