When a counterpart seemed to assume that Adams had some family members in England, Adams replied, [...] "Neither my father or mother, grandfather or grandmother, great grandfather or great grandmother, nor any other relation that I know of, or care a farthing for, has been in England these {{one hundred and fifty}} years; so that you see I have not one drop of blood in <b>my</b> <b>veins</b> but what is American." ...|$|E

Stone was said to have slipped the prisoner the knife so that Garner could kill herself if she was forced to return to slavery. Stone was referred to by the court as [...] "Mrs. Lucy Stone Blackwell" [...] and was asked if she wanted to defend herself; she preferred to address the assembly off the record after adjournment, saying [...] "...With my own teeth I would tear open <b>my</b> <b>veins</b> and let the earth drink my blood, rather than wear the chains of slavery. How then could I blame her for wishing her child to find freedom with God and the angels, where no chains are?" ...|$|E
500|$|Seacole {{was proud}} of both her Jamaican and Scottish ancestry and called herself a Creole, a term that was {{commonly}} used in a racially neutral sense or {{to refer to the}} children of white settlers with indigenous women. In her autobiography, The Wonderful Adventures of Mrs. Seacole, she records her bloodline thus: [...] "I am a Creole, and have good Scots blood coursing through <b>my</b> <b>veins.</b> My father was a soldier of an old Scottish family." [...] Legally, she was classified as a mulatto, a multiracial person with limited political rights; Robinson speculates that she may technically have been a quadroon. Seacole emphasises her personal vigour in her autobiography, distancing herself from the contemporary stereotype of the [...] "lazy Creole", She {{was proud of}} her black ancestry, writing, [...] "I have a few shades of deeper brown upon my skin which shows me related – and I am proud of the relationship – to those poor mortals whom you once held enslaved, and whose bodies America still owns." ...|$|E

5000|$|... "There She Goes" [...] {{has gained}} a {{reputation}} for being about the use of heroin, possibly {{as a result of the}} lines: [...] "There she goes again... racing through my brain... pulsing through <b>my</b> <b>vein...</b> no one else can heal my pain". Several newspapers ran articles about The La's and their apparent ode to heroin. When asked about the rumour in 1995, the group's bassist John Power replied: [...] "I don't know. Truth is, I don't wanna know." [...] However, in the book In Search of The La's: A Secret Liverpool (2003) by MW Macefield, ex-La's guitarist Paul Hemmings denied the rumour and added: [...] "Jeremy Fisher, you don't know what you are talking about." ...|$|R
500|$|... "Circus" [...] is an uptempo electropop and dance-pop song, with a stomp box {{beat and}} {{elements}} of pop rock. [...] The song opens {{with the sound}} of a drum and builds until Spears starts singing, [...] "There's only two types of people in the world/The ones that entertain and the ones that observe". Spears delivers confident and [...] "half-rapped" [...] vocals, with the verses having usage of synthesizers. Lyrically, the song talks about being an entertainer and putting on shows. She explains her emotions while performing in lines such as: [...] "I feel the adrenaline moving through <b>my</b> <b>veins</b> / Spotlight on me and I'm ready to break". The chorus begins with an electronic sound, while she compares herself, as well as performing to being on the center of a circus ring. According to the sheet music published at Musicnotes.com by Alfred Publishing, [...] "Circus" [...] is composed in the key of F# minor with 120 beats per minute, however on the album the song is 115 beats per minute. Spears's vocal range spans from G#2 to D#5. Kelly commented that [...] "Circus" [...] was [...] "a cool way to get people dancing and having fun", but also have a slight message.|$|E

"I {{should call}} myself an Afrikaner, {{were it not}} for the {{tendency}} to confine that term to those whose ancestors landed here before the British occupation, and to such newer arrivals as are animated by the 'South African spirit'. I have neither Voortrekker nor Huguenot blood in <b>my</b> <b>veins,</b> and 'the South African spirit', as understood by those who extol it, implies a view on the native question which I cannot share. But I am proud to be a South African, and I claim to stand on the same national footing as if my forebears had landed with Van Riebeeck or followed Piet Retief over the Drakensberg." ...|$|E
2500|$|Captain William Hamilton of Ardoch or Airdoch in Kilwinning Parish was {{the first}} of the Hamilton's of Ladyland (see {{illustration}} of their Coat of Arms). Lieutenant William Hamilton of Gilbertfield in Lanarkshire still owned Ladyland, but rented Gilbertfield, where he lived, making only the occasional visit to Ladyland. [...] William was a published poet and a friend and correspondent of the poet Allan Ramsay. [...] In 1722, Hamilton published an abridged and modernised version of Blind Harry's Wallace, which, though an artistic failure, aroused Robert Burns's boyhood interest and enthusiasm and, as he recorded in the Autobiographical Letter: 'poured a Scottish prejudice in <b>my</b> <b>veins</b> which will boil along there till the flood gates of life shut in eternal rest.' ...|$|E

Another condition of purchase was to give up her annuities and thus give up her birthright of being Indian. so again she refused. Her remarks made in 1861 were [...] "I am Indian; and the blood of my forefathers runs through <b>my</b> <b>veins</b> and I am not ashamed to own it; for my forefathers were a noble race before the pale-faces came to possess their lands and homes”.

60|$|In the meantime, I do here {{give this}} public notice that my resolutions are to {{circumscribe}} within this discourse the whole stock of matter I {{have been so}} many years providing. Since <b>my</b> <b>vein</b> is once opened, I am content to exhaust it all at a running, for the peculiar advantage of my dear country, and for the universal benefit of mankind. Therefore, hospitably considering the number of my guests, they shall have my whole entertainment at a meal, and I scorn to set up the leavings in the cupboard. What the guests cannot eat may be given to the poor, and the dogs under the table may gnaw the bones {140}.

60|$|I soon {{grew tired}} of this, and relapsed into <b>my</b> <b>vein</b> of mere poetical indulgence. I was charmed with Oxford, for {{it was full of}} poetry to me. I thought I should never grow tired of {{wandering}} about its courts and cloisters; and visiting the different college halls. I used to love to get in places surrounded by the colleges, where all modern buildings were screened from the sight; and to walk about them in twilight, and see the professors and students sweeping along in the dusk in their caps and gowns. There was complete delusion in the scene. It seemed to transport me among the edifices and the people of old times. It was a great luxury, too, for me to attend the evening service in the new college chapel, and to hear the fine organ and the choir swelling an anthem in that solemn building; where painting and music and architecture seem to combine their grandest effects.|$|R

5000|$|Beck did {{considered}} {{herself an}} abstract expressionist, {{and by the}} late 1950s, she had switched to the figurative focus that she would retain {{for the rest of}} her career.

I must have been a secret realist all along because I had never stopped drawing from life.” ...|$|R
60|$|But when I got back, and {{had helped}} {{myself to a}} glass of sherry to steady my nerves, from the little flask on Césarine's dressing-table, I thought to myself, hideous as it all seemed, it was very natural Césarine should wish to see her grandmother.
