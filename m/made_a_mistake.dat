5|$|Despite the {{retirement}} in Australia, the next 5 rounds saw {{a string of}} point-scoring positions, including a 4th at Monaco in the wet, {{one of the few}} finishers not to have <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>mistake</b> and subsequent pit-in, however his performance was overshadowed by Hamilton's win. Until 2009, this was Webber's best start to an F1 season since 2005 with Williams, managing five consecutive points scoring races.|$|E
5|$|Ground {{operations}} in Normandy were controlled by Montgomery at first, but SHAEF Forward headquarters moved to Jullouville in August, and on 1 September Eisenhower assumed control of Bradley's 12th Army Group and Montgomery's 21st Army Group. Smith {{soon realized that}} he had <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>mistake.</b> The forward headquarters was remote and inaccessible, and it lacked the necessary communications equipment.|$|E
5|$|Ric {{is having}} second {{thoughts}} about allowing Maddy to be interviewed. He explains to Michael that he doesn't think that she {{is ready for the}} position. Maria overhears the pair's conversation and chips in saying that she feels that Maddy is perfect. Michael knows Maria is right but Ric thinks he might have <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>mistake</b> and he explains to Maddy that he is withdrawing her interview offer. Maddy is devastated.|$|E

5|$|Ten-year-old Ballabriggs led {{for much}} of the race, and the gelding {{eventually}} saw off a strong run-in challenge from amateur jockey Sam Waley-Cohen on Oscar Time who secured second place. Third was 2010 winner Tony McCoy on Don't Push It, twelve lengths behind the second. 15/2 favourite The Midnight Club <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>mistake</b> at the third fence and finished sixth.|$|E
5|$|The United States District Court for the Central District of California {{agreed that}} the state court rulings were correct, however the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed. The Court of Appeals held that the state court <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>mistake</b> in not {{accounting}} for Alvarado's youth and inexperience when evaluating custody.|$|E

5|$|Magic, {{like many}} other games, {{combines}} chance and skill. One frequent complaint about the game involves {{the notion that there}} is too much luck involved, especially concerning possessing too many or too few lands. Early in the game especially, too many or too few lands could ruin a player's chance at victory without the player having <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>mistake.</b> This in-game statistical variance can be minimized by proper deck construction, as an appropriate land count can reduce mana problems. In Duels of the Planeswalkers 2012, the land count is automatically adjusted to 40% of the total deck size.|$|E
5|$|One month later, former Wisteria Lane {{resident}} Katherine Mayfair (Dana Delany) {{moves back}} to the neighborhood after twelve years of absence with her husband, Adam (Nathan Fillion), and teenage daughter, Dylan (Lyndsy Fonseca). Katherine had known Susan before moving away under mysterious circumstances. Susan's daughter, Julie (Andrea Bowen), is puzzled to learn that Dylan has no recollection of their childhood friendship or of her life on Wisteria Lane. Later, in a cryptic conversation, Adam asks Katherine if they <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>mistake</b> in moving back, and Katherine reminds him {{that they did not}} have a choice.|$|E
5|$|She finally narrates {{the story}} of her {{abandonment}} to Jug, who tells her that she fears abandonment so much that she does not allow herself to commit in relationships, leaving before they can leave her. He convinces her that she does not need to forgive her parents for abandoning her, but she can, as an adult, see them as two regular people who <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>mistake.</b> After this, Kaira makes an effort to reconcile with her parents and also works to finish her short film.|$|E

5|$|The Wii's success caught {{third-party}} developers by surprise, {{leading to}} apologies {{for the quality}} of their early games. In an interview with German news magazine Der Spiegel, Ubisoft's Yves Guillemot and Alain Corre admitted that they <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>mistake</b> in rushing out their launch titles, promising to take future projects more seriously. Take-Two Interactive, which released few games for the Nintendo GameCube, changed its stance towards Nintendo by placing a higher priority on the Wii.|$|E
5|$|The episode {{focuses on}} Grace (played by Debra Messing) impulsively {{accepting}} a marriage proposal from her boyfriend Leo (Harry Connick, Jr.) despite {{that the two}} have only {{known each other for}} a short time. They get married and tell their friends about the news, despite Grace's best friend Will's (Eric McCormack) unease about the whole idea. Grace and Leo decide to host a wedding reception for themselves, but at the festivity, Grace learns unsettling details about Leo, which gives her reason to wonder if she has <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>mistake.</b>|$|E
5|$|According to Meintjes, Kruger {{was still}} not {{particularly}} anti-British; he thought the British had <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>mistake</b> and would rectify the situation if this could be proven to them. After conducting a poll through the former republican infrastructure—587 signed in favour of the annexation, 6,591 against—he organised a second deputation to London, made up of himself and Joubert with Bok again serving as secretary. The envoys met the British High Commissioner in Cape Town, Sir Bartle Frere, and arrived in London on 29 June 1878 to find a censorious letter from Shepstone waiting for them, along with a communication that since Kruger was agitating against the government he had been dismissed from the executive council.|$|E

5|$|As the frontrunners {{set their}} first timed laps in Q3, Hamilton <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>mistake</b> and ran wide {{at the last}} corner, leaving him behind Rosberg and both Ferrari drivers. Hülkenberg, both Williams drivers and Ricciardo were {{eliminated}} without setting another time, while the four fastest cars came out again. Hamilton set the fastest ever lap at the Bahrain Circuit, at 1:29.493, to achieve pole position ahead of Rosberg, who was just 0.077 seconds slower. Half a second behind, Vettel grabbed third place on the grid ahead of teammate Räikkönen. After qualifying, Hamilton's pole was put under threat after the FIA started an investigation after Hamilton reversed in the pit lane to park up. Hamilton was given a reprimand and his pole position stood.|$|E
5|$|From 1994 to 2006, Kahn {{was part}} of the German {{national}} team, in which he played as a starter after the retirement of Andreas Köpke; he was an unused member of the squad that won the 1996 UEFA European Championship. In the 2002 FIFA World Cup, the team reached the final. While Germany was several times derided for their poor performance, Kahn's prowess proved to be the deciding factor in several games until the final, where Germany lost 0–2 to Brazil and Kahn <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>mistake</b> on Brazil's first goal. Nevertheless, he was named the tournament's best player and received the Golden Ball award.|$|E
5|$|Hakim {{screened}} {{her first}} {{work as a}} producer, Daun di Atas Bantal (Leaf on a Pillow) during Un Certain Regard at Cannes ten years later. When producing the film, she chose young director Garin Nugroho, whom she perceived to be highly talented; she also took the leading role. During production, she <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>mistake</b> that required the reshooting of all footage. In an attempt to cut expenses, she had saved all cans of exposed film to send to the developing lab at once; the lab then notified her that a technical fault with the camera had rendered all of it unusable and that the problem could have been detected earlier had she sent each can as it was filmed.|$|E

5|$|In Q3, both Mercedes drivers set two {{consecutive}} fast laps {{at the beginning}} of the session, with Rosberg coming out on top, 0.188 seconds ahead of his teammate. All drivers had problems in improving on their times during the second run of timed laps on fresher tyres. While Hamilton did improve early in the lap, his effort was stopped when he <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>mistake</b> at turn twelve. This meant that he was unable to challenge Rosberg for pole position, who qualified first for the fourth race in a row. The two Mercedes drivers were closely followed by Vettel, ahead of the two Red Bulls of Kvyat and Ricciardo, both Williams cars and Verstappen in eighth. On the fifth row of the grid, local favourite Sergio Pérez edged out teammate Nico Hülkenberg for ninth.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to their disqualification, former presidents Hubert Maga and Sourou-Migan Apithy staged protests while Justin Ahomadégbé-Tomêtin, another ex-president, supported an obscure candidate named Basile Adjou Moumouni. The election was held on May 15, and was Dahomey's first since 1964. Moumouni won the election with 80 percent of the vote, but Alley declared the result void because the protest prevented nearly three-quarters of the electorate from voting. This result sparked further demonstrations, and Maga, Apithy, Ahomadégbé-Tomêtin, and former president Christophe Soglo were forbidden to enter the country, {{in an attempt to}} crack down on dissent. Alley felt he had <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>mistake</b> in disqualifying Maga, Apithy, and Ahomadégbé-Tomêtin, as he believed that only they could bring unity to Dahomey.|$|E
5|$|In the quarter-finals, Tottenham again {{played at}} home, against top-flight Newcastle United. Away goalkeeper Jak Alnwick <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>mistake</b> which allowed Nabil Bentaleb to give Spurs a half-time lead. Nacer Chadli doubled it 36 seconds {{into the second}} half. Kane and his {{replacement}} Soldado also scored in the 4–0 victory. Tottenham's semi-final against League One club Sheffield United started with a 1–0 home win, Andros Townsend converting a penalty won by Jay McEveley's handball. A week later in the second leg at Bramall Lane, Tottenham doubled their aggregate lead with Christian Eriksen's free kick, but {{in the second half}} 18-year-old substitute Che Adams scored twice to equalise the aggregate. With two minutes remaining, Eriksen scored his second to put Tottenham into the final.|$|E
