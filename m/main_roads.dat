5|$|An {{official}} inspection in October 1950 {{reported that it}} would not be difficult to improve the old road into a reasonable track, which would then have a better chance of attracting assistance from <b>Main</b> <b>Roads.</b> The Mandurah Road Board spent £1200 on the road, while the Harvey Road Board requested a £500 grant from <b>Main</b> <b>Roads</b> for their portion of the road. Two years later little progress had been made, and <b>Main</b> <b>Roads</b> therefore refused to fund feeder roads to connect to Old Coast Road. By May 1952, works had halted as <b>Main</b> <b>Roads</b> believed that the existing, winding route around the estuary was too prone to flooding. Settlers in the area recalled it never flooding previously, and the Mandurah Road Board was concerned that should a new road be built, they would still have to maintain the old road for access to properties. The road was inspected by the Premier, Deputy-Commissioner of <b>Main</b> <b>Roads</b> J. D. Leach, and the district engineer H. A. Smith. They indicated that a new road would likely closely follow the old road, but that a detailed survey would be needed. Nearby limestone deposits would be suitable for the road's foundation, with the cost estimated at £11 per chain.|$|E
5|$|During World War II, the <b>Main</b> <b>Roads</b> Department focused its {{activities}} on the war effort. Roads in rural areas deteriorated, especially after the Pearl Harbour attack brought the war to the Pacific, and only the most urgent maintenance works were authorised on roads for civilian purposes. Following the war, <b>Main</b> <b>Roads</b> returned to its usual operations, repairing and maintaining the road network. The rural road network expanded in the 1950s, with <b>Main</b> <b>Roads</b> both repairing the worst segments of its roads, through numerous small jobs, and assisting local governments to seal their roads. Such activity was spurred on by the closure of railway lines {{in addition to the}} establishment of new land settlements.|$|E

5|$|A {{realignment}} of {{the highway}} between Newman and Port Hedland had been proposed since 1976, which would see the road deviate to the west at Newman, and travel via Wittenoom instead of Marble Bar. In the early 1980s, eleven route corridors were investigated by <b>Main</b> <b>Roads.</b> The potential impacts on the natural environment, regional economy, tourism, and resident population were considered, with particular concern for the crossing of the Hamersley Range.|$|E
5|$|Amman has an {{extensive}} road network, although the mountainous terrain {{of the area}} has prevented the connection of some <b>main</b> <b>roads,</b> which are instead connected by bridges and tunnels.

5|$|Between 2014 and 2016, the $1billion Gateway WA Perth Airport and Freight Access Project was {{undertaken}} {{to upgrade the}} road network around Perth Airport. At {{the time it was}} the largest project <b>Main</b> <b>Roads</b> Western Australia has ever undertaken, covering the upgrade of Tonkin and Leach highways, and the construction of four new interchanges. The project was jointly funded by state and federal governments, which are providing $317.5million and $686.4million respectively.|$|E
5|$|Dedicated bus lanes {{have existed}} on the Kwinana Freeway {{since the late}} 1980s, when a project {{was set up to}} {{decrease}} bus commuters' travel times into Perth from suburbs south of the Swan River. In 1987, <b>Main</b> <b>Roads</b> Western Australia and Transperth trialled a contraflow bus lane along the Kwinana Freeway, from the Canning Interchange to the Narrows Interchange. The lane operated between 7:00 am and 9:30 am, the period with the most traffic congestion on the freeway. After two months, the results were examined, and the agencies decided to build an additional bus lane on the northbound carriageway. The construction included bus-only ramps {{at the beginning and end}} of the lane. The works were mainly funded by Transperth, which contributed $8.22 million out of the $10.23 million total cost. The remaining $2.01 million was provided by <b>Main</b> <b>Roads</b> Western Australia. The bus lane opened on 20 November 1989, and received an Institute of Engineers award for engineering excellence.|$|E
5|$|In Roman Britain, {{what is now}} Ashford was {{the meeting}} point of two <b>main</b> <b>roads.</b> One led from London to Lympne (Lemanis), the other from the Weald, through Canterbury (Durovernum) and ending {{at the port of}} Richborough (Rutupiae). Ashford was one of the towns in Kent to become a hub when the roads were turnpiked {{in the second half of}} the 18th century.|$|E

5|$|The rise of {{the motor}} vehicle era in the early 20th century saw the road gain {{prominence}} once more, and by 1939 the whole road had been sealed. Congestion at the Perth end of the road in the 1930s led to parallel roads Berwick Street and Shepparton Road being upgraded to provide bypasses. The entire Perth−Albany road was renamed Albany Highway on 2 October 1940, in recognition of its importance as an arterial traffic route. From the late 1970s, $49 million over ten years was spent on repairing Albany Highway, and the experience saw <b>Main</b> <b>Roads</b> develop a program of interventions to prevent costly road reconstruction. Since the 1990s <b>Main</b> <b>Roads</b> has been upgrading various portions along the length of Albany Highway, including widening sections to dual carriageways in Perth, and the construction of the Kenwick Link bypass.|$|E
5|$|While Old Coast Road's dual {{carriageway}} was advancing north from Bunbury, and Kwinana Freeway was progressively being extended south from Perth, the alignment through Mandurah was constrained by existing development. Keeping the existing alignment {{would result in}} a traffic bottleneck through Mandurah. To overcome this problem, <b>Main</b> <b>Roads</b> began planning for a new route east of the Peel Inlet in the 1980s.|$|E
5|$|Wigan lies on {{the meeting}} point of two primary A roads, the A49 and A577 which link to the M6, M61 {{motorway}} and M58 motorway. Increased traffic in recent years, encouraged by retail development, has resulted in very congested <b>main</b> <b>roads</b> {{for most of the}} day. This situation is linked to the town's geography, with river valleys and railway lines impeding road improvement.|$|E
50|$|Intersections {{that involve}} a minor <b>road</b> {{crossing}} a <b>main</b> <b>road</b> are often made into staggered junctions to prevent traffic going straight across a <b>main</b> <b>road</b> without stopping {{to check for}} oncoming vehicles.|$|R
50|$|During the 1980s, large {{sections}} of East <b>Main</b> <b>Road</b> and West <b>Main</b> <b>Road</b> running through Middletown began to be commercialized, and by the late 1990s, the area had become Aquidneck Island's central business district.|$|R
50|$|In 1770 the <b>main</b> <b>road</b> between Banbury and Chipping Norton, which {{passes through}} Bloxham, {{was made into}} a turnpike.
