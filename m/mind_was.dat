5|$|Clolarion was {{a legendary}} protoss executor, whose deeds {{were taught to}} Templar warriors long after his death. Because of his status, Clolarion was chosen {{to take part in}} the {{purifier}} program. His <b>mind</b> <b>was</b> scanned into a robotic shell, in an attempt to recreate and preserve the greatest warriors of the Templar. The Clolarion purifier was sealed in Cybros along with the rest of the purifiers after their rebellion against the Conclave.|$|E

The band learned their studio output was not as easy to re-create live as it was with previous albums. An example was with the song 'Gloam' as the pedal changes were too rapid for live performances.|$|E

Based on 159 reviews collected by Rotten Tomatoes, 79% of the reviewers enjoyed Confessions of a Dangerous Mind {{with an average}} rating of 7.2/10.

Sam Rockwell won the Silver Bear for Best Actor and George Clooney was nominated the Golden Bear but lost to Michael Winterbottom of In This World.|$|E
5|$|Although Susan Hayward was {{reported}} to be in the running for one of the two female leads, Julie Harris was chosen for the role of Eleanor Lance. Wise had seen Harris on stage, and felt she was right for the part of the psychologically fragile Eleanor. Harris agreed to do the film in part because the role was complex and the idea of the house taking over Eleanor's <b>mind</b> <b>was</b> interesting. But she also chose it because she had a long-standing interest in parapsychology. English actress Claire Bloom was cast as Theo. In part, however, the decision to cast Bloom and Johnson was because of Eady Levy requirements that the cast be partly British. To make Bloom's character appear more bohemian, beatnik clothing designer Mary Quant was hired to design mod clothing specifically for the Theodora character.|$|E
5|$|An {{exception}} {{to all of}} this would be the Primal Zerg, who inhabit the original Zerg homeworld of Zerus (as seen in Heart of the Swarm). The Zerg Hive <b>Mind</b> <b>was</b> created to control the Zerg, and eventually put them {{under the control of the}} main antagonist of the series, the fallen Xel'Naga Amon. Some Zerg, however, managed to avoid being subsumed. These are the Primal Zerg, who have much the same genetic abilities but are not bound to the Overmind. These creatures are each independently sapient, and if they follow a leader it is because they choose to. Their lack of a Hive Mind also shields them from specific psionic attacks engineered to counter the Zerg Hive Mind.|$|E
5000|$|Upeksha {{as a power}} {{includes}} {{freedom from}} all kinds of desires and birth because it has no preference for one thing more than the other. It is opposed to individuality. This power manifests as ten kinds which are - Sadangopeksha (when there is neither pleasure nor displeasure), Brahma-wiharopeksha (when the <b>mind</b> <b>is</b> equally affected towards all beings), Bowdyangopeksha (when the <b>mind</b> <b>is</b> equally affected towards all thoughts), Wiryopeksha (when the <b>mind</b> <b>is</b> equally affected by the same force of determination), Sankharopeksha (when the <b>mind</b> <b>is</b> equally affected towards all kinds of wisdom), Wedanopeksha (when the <b>mind</b> <b>is</b> sensible to neither pleasure nor pain), Widarsanopeksha (when the <b>mind</b> <b>is</b> not affected by what is seen), Tatramadyastopeksha (when all modes of upeksha are applied together), Dhyanopeksha (when the impermanency of sensible-objects is regarded with an even mind)and Parisudi-upeksha (when the <b>mind</b> <b>is</b> equally affected towards all that is necessary to secure freedom from the cleaving to existence). All upekshas may be possessed by one and the same person but the second cannot be possessed without the first.|$|R

5|$|Despite the {{qualified}} {{nature of}} this comment, the operation Beatty had in <b>mind</b> <b>was</b> both important and potentially dangerous. On 6 February 1918, Battleship Division Nine stood out of Scapa Flow to guard the high value Scandinavian Convoy to and from Norway. Twice in the previous year, this convoy—with its essential cargos of iron ore, nitrates, and other chemicals—had been raided by German cruisers and destroyers, {{with the loss of}} 15 allied freighters. To avoid a repeat of these attacks, the British had taken to escorting the convoys with dreadnought squadrons. Still, the possibility existed that the Germans would send out their entire fleet to cut off and annihilate the overmatched battleship squadron, with severe strategic effect.|$|E
5|$|Hsu {{described}} the localization {{work as a}} balancing act, and said that continuity and consistency was very important. To avoid situations where a small detail in one game is changed in localization, and then comes back as a major point in a sequel, Hsu avoided changing things unless necessary, such as when something in the original would not be understood by the target audience. One thing the localization team had to keep in <b>mind</b> <b>was</b> keeping the writing in-character: when substituting a Japanese joke with an English one, they had to consider {{whether it would be}} something that the character would say, and not simply that it was funny. They also worked towards having puns and references be appropriate for the dialogue, so that the dialogue still makes sense to players who do not get the reference or pun.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1980s, Putnam {{abandoned}} his adherence to functionalism and other computational theories of mind. His change of <b>mind</b> <b>was</b> {{primarily due to}} the difficulties that computational theories have in explaining certain intuitions {{with respect to the}} externalism of mental content. This is illustrated by Putnam's own Twin Earth thought experiment (see Philosophy of language). He also developed a separate argument against functionalism in 1988, based on Fodor's generalized version of multiple realizability. Asserting that functionalism is really a watered-down identity theory in which mental kinds are identified with functional kinds, Putnam argued that mental kinds may be multiply realizable over functional kinds. The argument for functionalism is that the same mental state could be implemented by the different states of a universal Turing machine.|$|E

2500|$|<b>Mind,</b> in Buddhism, <b>is</b> also {{described}} as being [...] "space-like" [...] and [...] "illusion-like". <b>Mind</b> <b>is</b> space-like {{in the sense that}} it is not physically obstructive. It has no qualities which would prevent it from existing. In Mahayana Buddhism, <b>mind</b> <b>is</b> illusion-like {{in the sense that it}} is empty of inherent existence. This does not mean it does not exist, it means that it exists in a manner that is counter to our ordinary way of misperceiving how phenomena exist, according to Buddhism. When the <b>mind</b> <b>is</b> itself cognized properly, without misperceiving its mode of existence, it appears to exist like an illusion. There is a big difference however between being [...] "space and illusion" [...] and being [...] "space-like" [...] and [...] "illusion-like". <b>Mind</b> <b>is</b> not composed of space, it just shares some descriptive similarities to space. <b>Mind</b> <b>is</b> not an illusion, it just shares some descriptive qualities with illusions.|$|R

5|$|Stratton wrote Experimental Psychology and its Bearing upon Culture {{to explain}} both typical {{psychological}} experiment methodology {{and how the}} results obtained answered philosophical problems. The book covered experimental results in psychology and how they influenced overall social behavior and the everyday cultural life of people. It did so {{by looking at the}} history of experimental psychology, and then surveying experimental methods covering both their applications and limits. Stratton pointed out how psychological experiments differed from the ones in physiology. The survey of experiments also included studies on mental perception, including among the blind. Stratton noted that the blind did have a sense of space. He also described how measurements of mental phenomena were both possible and being done in practice, though he did believe the results had to be interpreted on a psychic scale different from the usual physical ones used for measures such as lengths and weights. He rejected the argument the <b>mind</b> <b>was</b> unitary and could not be studied by splitting it into parts, by drawing on the analogy of studying a tree by looking at its constituent parts, themselves not functionally trees. He presumed sensations were akin to trees in how they could be split up into parts.|$|E
5|$|The {{interior}} sets of {{the boats}} were not built specifically for the programme, but were pulled together from stock items from various prop warehouses. Cumming had originally hoped to simulate the rocking of the ships by mounting the sets on rollers but the idea was dropped due to costs, with the effect achieved by moving the cameras instead. The photo of Tegan's Aunt Vanessa, one of the items created by Marriner from the contents of her <b>mind,</b> <b>was</b> shot specifically for the filming, requiring Dolore Whiteman (who had played the character in Logopolis) to be contracted for a one-day photoshoot. The models {{of the boats}}, used in the racing sequences, were props sourced by visual effects designer Mike Kelt following extensive research at the National Maritime Museum. The ships were mounted on rods for filming, while the oars were battery operated. The model of Davey's ship remained intact, with explosion being a filmed effect that was edited into the sequence. Kelt {{was shocked by the}} dilapidated state of the TARDIS console prop, and was worried about damaging it while filming the explosion from Part One, and asked producer John Nathan-Turner if he could replace it but was told there was no money available.|$|E
