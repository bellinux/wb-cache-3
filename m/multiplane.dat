5|$|Since Alice Comedies in the 1920s, Walt Disney Animation Studios has {{produced}} a series of prominent short films, including the Mickey Mouse cartoons and the Silly Symphonies series.

25|$|The <b>multiplane</b> {{camera is}} a special motion picture camera used in the {{traditional}} animation process that moves a number of pieces of artwork past the camera at various speeds and at various distances from one another, creating a three-dimensional effect, although not stereoscopic. Various parts of the artwork layers are left transparent, to allow other layers to be seen behind them. The movements are calculated and photographed frame-by-frame, with the result being an illusion of depth by having several layers of artwork moving at different speeds. The further away from the camera, the slower the speed. The <b>multiplane</b> effect is {{sometimes referred to as}} a parallax process. As a former director and animator of Walt Disney Studios, Ub Iwerks in 1933 invented the <b>multiplane</b> camera using four layers of flat artwork before a horizontal camera.|$|E
25|$|The film {{is notable}} for reproductions of 1910-era aircraft, {{including}} a triplane, monoplanes, biplanes and also Horatio Phillips's 20-winged <b>multiplane</b> from 1904. Wheeler insisted on authentic materials but allowed {{the use of}} modern engines and modifications necessary to ensure safety. Of 20 types built in 1964 at £5,000 each, six could fly, flown by six stunt pilots and maintained by 14 mechanics. The race take-off scene where seven aircraft are {{in the air at}} once included a composite addition of one aircraft. Flying conditions were monitored carefully, with aerial scenes filmed before 10am or in early evening when the air was least turbulent, for the replicas, true to the originals, were flimsy, and control, especially in the lateral plane, tended to be marginal. When weather conditions were poor, interiors or other incidental sequences were shot instead. Wheeler eventually served not only as the technical adviser but also as the aerial supervisor throughout the production, and, later wrote a comprehensive background account of the film and the replicas that were constructed to portray period aircraft.|$|E

500|$|The {{underwater}} setting {{required the}} most special effects animation for a Disney animated feature since Fantasia in 1940. Effects animation supervisor Mark Dindal estimated {{that over a}} million bubbles were drawn for this film, {{in addition to the}} use of other processes such as airbrushing, backlighting, superimposition, and some computer animation. The artistic manpower needed for Mermaid required Disney to farm out most of the underwater bubble effects animation in the film to Pacific Rim Productions, a China-based firm with production facilities in Beijing. An attempt to use Disney's famed <b>multiplane</b> camera {{for the first time in}} years for quality [...] "depth" [...] shots failed because the machine was reputedly in dilapidated condition.

500|$|By 1934, Disney {{had become}} {{dissatisfied}} with producing formulaic cartoon shorts, {{and began a}} four-year production of a feature-length cartoon, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, based on the fairy tale. When news leaked out about the project, many in the film industry predicted it would bankrupt the company; industry insiders nicknamed it [...] "Disney's Folly". The film, {{which was the first}} animated feature made in full color and sound, cost $1.5million to producethree times over budget. To ensure the animation was as realistic as possible, Disney sent his animators on courses at the Chouinard Art Institute; he brought animals into the studio and hired actors so that the animators could study realistic movement. To portray the changing perspective of the background as a camera moved through a scene, Disney's animators developed a <b>multiplane</b> camera which allowed drawings on pieces of glass to be set at various distances from the camera, creating an illusion of depth. The glass could be moved to create the impression of a camera passing through the scene. The first work created on the cameraa Silly Symphony called The Old Mill (1937)won the Academy Award for Animated Short Film because of its impressive visual power. Although Snow White had been largely finished by the time the <b>multiplane</b> camera had been completed, Disney ordered some scenes be re-drawn to use the new effects.|$|E
500|$|The Little Mermaid was {{the last}} Disney feature film to use the {{traditional}} hand-painted cel method of animation. Disney's next film, The Rescuers Down Under, used a digital method of coloring and combining scanned drawings developed for Disney by Pixar called [...] CAPS (Computer Animation Production System), which would {{eliminate the need for}} cels, the <b>multiplane</b> camera, and many of the optical effects used for the last time in Mermaid. A CAPS prototype was used experimentally on a few scenes in Mermaid, and one shot produced using CAPS—the penultimate shot in the film, of Ariel and Eric's wedding ship sailing away under a rainbow—appears in the finished film. Computer-generated imagery was used to create some of the wrecked ships in the final battle, a staircase behind a shot of Ariel in Eric's castle, and the carriage Eric and Ariel are riding in when she bounces it over a ravine. These objects were animated using 3D wireframe models, which were plotted as line art to cels and painted traditionally.|$|E

500|$|In 1934, Walt Disney {{gathered}} {{several key}} {{staff members and}} announced his plans to make his first feature animated film.

Considerable training and development went into the production of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, and the studio greatly expanded with established animators, artists from other fields, and recent college graduates joining the studio to work on the film. The training classes, supervised by the head animators such as Les Clark, Norm Ferguson, and Art Babbit and taught by Donald W. Graham, an art teacher from the nearby Chouinard Art Institute, had begun at the studio in 1932 and were greatly expanded into orientation training and continuing education classes. In the course of teaching the classes, Graham and the animators created or formalized many of the techniques and processes that became the key tenets and principles of traditional animation. Silly Symphonies such as The Goddess of Spring (1934) and The Old Mill (1937) served as experimentation grounds for new techniques such as the animation of realistic human figures, special effects animation, the use of the <b>multiplane</b> camera, an invention which split animation artwork layers into several planes, allowing the camera to appear to move dimensionally through an animated scene.|$|E

40|$|We {{describe}} {{a new approach}} for simulating apparent camera motion through a 3 D environment. The approach is motivated by a traditional technique used in 2 D cel animation, in which a single background image, which we call a multiperspective panorama,is used to incorporate multiple views of a 3 D environment as seen from along a given camera path. When viewed through a small moving window, the panorama produces the illusion of 3 D motion. In this paper, we explore how such panoramas can be designed by computer, and we examine their application to cel animation in particular. Multiperspective panoramas should also be useful for any application in which predefined camera moves are applied to 3 D scenes, including virtual reality fly-throughs, computer games, and architectural walk-throughs.

[...] The Flip and Willie cartoons were later distributed on the home-movie market by Official Films in the 1940s. From 1933 to 1936, he produced a series of shorts (independently distributed, not part of the MGM deal) in Cinecolor, named ComiColor Cartoons. The ComiColor series mostly focused on fairy tales with no continuing character or star. Later in the 1940s, this series would receive home-movie distribution by Castle Films. Cinecolor produced the 16 mm prints for Castle Films with red emulsion on one side and blue emulsion on the other. Later in the 1970s Blackhawk Films released these for home use, but this time using conventional Eastmancolor film stock. They are now in the public domain and are available on VHS and DVD.

40|$|Alike {{interconnection}} {{networks for}} parallel systems, Networks-on-chip (NoC) must provide high bandwidth and low latency, {{but they are}} further constrained by their on-chip power budget. Consequently, simple network topologies such as the 2 D Mesh with shallow buffers and simple routing strategies such as dimensional order routing (DOR) {{have been widely used}} in order to achieve this goal. A low number of virtual channels could be used to eliminate head-of-line blocking and increase network throughput. Due to the spare routing area in deep submicron technology, another possibility is to replicate the simple network once or more times.
