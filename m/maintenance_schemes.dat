Failures impact the operational cost of electric utilities as they endanger the accomplishment of power commitments. Power transformer failure rate can be modeled from its health condition, which is determined from different condition parameters. This paper is aimed to compare different <b>maintenance</b> <b>schemes</b> that allow the asset to be available the longest possible time. The power transformer operation is represented considering actual electric load profiles and temperature. Electrical and thermal transformer parameters are taken from manufacturer tests and technical standards. An electrical-thermal model is employed to estimate the life span reduction and temperature changes. From life span and loading, the health condition is determined, so as the effects of different <b>maintenance</b> <b>schemes.</b> The failure rates are calculated for unmaintained conditions and different maintained schemes, allowing to determine their effects on transformer reliability. Optimal <b>maintenance</b> <b>schemes</b> are determined and the expected benefits in failure rate reduction, asset reliability and life span extension are presented. As a result, it was found that certain time-based <b>maintenance</b> <b>schemes</b> provide better transformer reliability performance in comparison to condition based schemes,  allowing to reduce the interruptions and extending the life of the transformer...|$|E

40|$|Materialized view is used {{in large}} data centric {{applications}} to expedite query processing. The efficiency of materialized view depends on degree of result found against the queries over the existing materialized views. Materialized views are constructed following different methodologies. Thus {{the efficacy of the}} materialized views depends on the methodology based on which these are formed. Construction of materialized views are often time consuming and moreover after a certain time the performance of the materialized views degrade when the nature of queries change. In this situation either new materialized views could be constructed from scratch or the existing views could be upgraded. Fresh construction of materialized views has higher time complexity hence the modification of the existing views is a better solution.

40|$|Abstract — Clustering is an {{important}} research area for mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs) as it increases the capacity of network, reduces the routing overhead and makes the network more scalable {{in the presence of}} both high mobility and a large number of mobile nodes. In clustering the clusterhead manage and store recent routing information. However the frequent change of clusterhead leads to loss of routing information stored, changes the route between two nodes, affects the performance of the routing protocol and makes the cluster structure unstable. Communication overhead in terms of exchanging messages is needed to elect a new clusterhead. The goal then would be to keep the clusterhead change as least as possible to make cluster structure more stable, to prevent loss of routing information which in turn improve the performance of routing protocol based on clustering. This can be achieved by an efficient cluster <b>maintenance</b> <b>scheme.</b> In this work, a novel clustering algorithm, namely Incremental <b>Maintenance</b> Clustering <b>Scheme</b> (IMS) is proposed for Mobile Ad Hoc Networks. The goals are yielding low number of clusterhead and clustermember changes, maintaining stable clusters, minimizing the number of clustering overhead. Through simulations the performance of IMS is compared with that of least cluster change (LCC) and <b>maintenance</b> <b>scheme</b> of Cluster Based Routing Protocol (CBRP) {{in terms of the number}} of clusterhead changes, number of cluster-member changes and clustering overhead by varying mobility and speed.

40|$|The {{translational}} axis {{is one of}} {{the most}} important subsystems in modern machine tools, as its degradation may result in the loss of the product qualification and lower the control precision. Condition-based maintenance (CBM) has been considered as one of the advanced <b>maintenance</b> <b>schemes</b> to achieve effective, reliable and cost-effective operation of machine systems, however, current vibration-based <b>maintenance</b> <b>schemes</b> cannot be employed directly in the translational axis system, due to its complex structure and the inefficiency of commonly used condition monitoring features. In this paper, a wavelet bicoherence-based quadratic nonlinearity feature is proposed for translational axis condition monitoring by using the torque signature of the drive servomotor. Firstly, the quadratic nonlinearity of the servomotor torque signature is discussed, and then, a biphase randomization wavelet bicoherence is introduced for its quadratic nonlinear detection. On this basis, a quadratic nonlinearity feature is proposed for condition monitoring of the translational axis. The properties of the proposed quadratic nonlinearity feature are investigated by simulations. Subsequently, this feature is applied to the real-world servomotor torque data collected from the X-axis on a high precision vertical machining centre. All the results show that the performance of the proposed feature is much better than that of original condition monitoring features...|$|E

40|$|Excerpt] In {{this paper}} {{we have set}} down a {{moderately}} rigorous exposition {{of the use of}} conventional economic analysis for the purpose of estimating the work (dis) incentives resulting from the institution of various income <b>maintenance</b> <b>schemes.</b> Most of the analysis is couched in terms of simplified versions of the Family Assistance Plan (FAP), a variant of a negative income tax, and a wage subsidy program. Our intent is to set out the conventional theory of labor supply in an easily understood way, to show how this theory may be helpful in the examination of an issue of importance to public policy, and to survey the available empirical literature for reasonable estimates of the parameters necessary for implementation of the theory. What we will do in the sequel is perfectly conventional. The only wrinkles are that we will try to simplify and verbalize the analysis often, and we will try to integrate various income <b>maintenance</b> <b>schemes</b> into the analysis to see what implications are provided regarding work (dis) incentives from them. There are accordingly three parts to the paper: Part I is a strictly verbal discussion of everything that follows. Part II is a more conventional discussion with some mathematics.
