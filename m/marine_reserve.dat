Nugget Point {{in the northern}} Catlins hosts a particularly rich variety of marine wildlife. The establishment of a <b>marine</b> <b>reserve</b> off the coast here, discussed in 1992, 2004 and 2015, has been controversial. Hector's dolphins can often be seen close to the Catlins coast, especially at Porpoise Bay near Waikawa, which is protected {{as part of the}} Catlins Coast Marine Mammal Sanctuary, established in 2008. Migratory southern right whales and humpback whales can be spotted along the coastline during winter.|$|E

40|$|A key {{objective}} of <b>marine</b> <b>reserves</b> {{is to maintain}} ecological processes important to the functioning of marine ecosystems. Grazing by tropical herbivores contributes to maintaining resilient coral reefs and <b>marine</b> <b>reserves</b> are critical in conserving herbivores and the functional role they provide. Less is known, however, {{about the effects of}} <b>marine</b> <b>reserves</b> on herbivorous fish and their role on temperate reefs. This study evaluated the potential for <b>marine</b> <b>reserves</b> to enhance grazing by herbivores on temperate reefs in Jervis Bay Marine Park, Australia. First, the movement patterns of a dominant grazer, luderick Girella tricuspidata, were determined using acoustic telemetry to assess the potential effects of <b>marine</b> <b>reserves</b> on G. tricuspidata. Second, the size and abundance of G. tricuspidata and other grazers (rock blackfish Girella elevata and silver drummer Kyphosus sydneyanus) was quantified on shallow subtidal reefs inside and outside <b>marine</b> <b>reserves</b> using a diver operated stereo-video system. Finally, grazing rates were quantified inside and outside <b>marine</b> <b>reserves</b> using video cameras. Luderick G. tricuspidata exhibited strong site fidelity on shallow subtidal reefs and was significantly larger and more abundant within <b>marine</b> <b>reserves.</b> Rock blackfish G. elevata was significantly more abundant in one of four <b>marine</b> <b>reserves,</b> although showed no difference in size between zones. Silver drummer K. sydneyanus was significantly larger in <b>marine</b> <b>reserves,</b> although not significantly more abundant.

40|$|Currently the {{principle}} focus in marine conservation planning {{is on the}} conservation of marine biodiversity through the establishment of no-take <b>marine</b> <b>reserves.</b> No-take <b>marine</b> <b>reserves</b> provide permanent closed areas to all forms of fishing and extractive activities. These reserves represent a precautionary ecosystem-based approach to the management of our marine and coastal resources. Whilst {{there is a growing}} body of theoretical information supporting the role of no-take <b>marine</b> <b>reserves</b> in conserving both marine biodiversity and fisheries resources, very few studies, particularly within inshore and coastal environments, have examined their role empirically. This study aims to empirically assess the effectiveness of two existing no-take <b>marine</b> <b>reserves</b> in subtropical Australia. By permanently closing areas to fishing, no-take <b>marine</b> <b>reserves</b> simultaneously protect target species, their habitats, and the ecological processes that underpin fish production. However due to the rarity of no-take <b>marine</b> <b>reserves</b> worldwide, scientists and fisheries managers have limited experience with them and are still unsure of the benefits and costs for fisheries management. This study uses several simple and cost-effective methods to assess the effectiveness of two existing no-take <b>marine</b> <b>reserves</b> within subtropical Australia. The methods, science and preliminary results of this study will be discussed within this paper. 1...|$|R
40|$|<b>Marine</b> <b>reserves</b> {{are viewed}} as {{flagship}} tools to protect exploited species and {{to contribute to the}} effective management of coastal fisheries. Yet, the extent to which <b>marine</b> <b>reserves</b> are globally interconnected and able to effectively seed areas, where fisheries are most critical for food and livelihood security is largely unknown. Using a hydrodynamic model of larval dispersal, we predict that most <b>marine</b> <b>reserves</b> are not interconnected by currents and that their potential benefits to fishing areas are presently limited, since countries with high dependency on coastal fisheries receive very little larval supply from <b>marine</b> <b>reserves.</b> This global mismatch could be reversed, however, by placing new <b>marine</b> <b>reserves</b> in areas sufficiently remote to minimize social and economic costs but sufficiently connected through sea currents to seed the most exploited fisheries and endangered ecosystems...|$|R
40|$|This paper reviews 35 {{years of}} {{experience}} with <b>marine</b> <b>reserves</b> in New Zealand and attempts to distil from this the principles necessary for their successful establishment. Progress in New Zealand was slow but continuous. There are now 16 reserves, many more are planned, and the idea has considerable support with the general public, politicians, scientists, teachers and conservation interests. Plans are being made to create a full system of <b>marine</b> <b>reserves.</b> Experience in New Zealand and some other countries shows that the broad and vague concept of Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) has little practical value for marine planning and management. In contrast, the clear and simple concept of <b>marine</b> <b>reserves</b> Ð areas of the sea free from direct disturbance Ð has proved very useful. The concept of <b>marine</b> <b>reserves</b> is new and different to standard marine management. It is proactive rather than reactive. Its operation is not dependent on detailed information. <b>Marine</b> <b>reserves</b> are additional to detailed and general marine planning and management, which will continue to operate and develop outside the <b>reserves.</b> <b>Marine</b> <b>reserves</b> provide essential support to these management systems...|$|R

40|$|<b>Marine</b> <b>reserves,</b> {{in which}} {{exploitation}} of marine organisms {{and other human}} activities are restricted or prohibited, can be valuable tools for marine conservation and fisheries management. No-take <b>marine</b> <b>reserves</b> support greater density, size, and diversity of fishes than exploited areas, with most benefits accruing to heavily exploited species. Protected areas can also export biomass to sustain or increase the overall yield of adjacent fisheries. These effects can be especially significant for organisms with small home ranges, such as coral reef fish. Although there are many benefits to creating <b>marine</b> <b>reserves</b> they are also costly to manage and can infringe on people’s recreation and livelihoods. For <b>marine</b> <b>reserves</b> {{to be used as}} management tools, a comprehensive knowledge of the ecosystems is needed and reserve impacts should be regularly monitored.

40|$|<b>Marine</b> <b>reserves</b> are {{considered}} to be a central tool for marine ecosystem-based management in tropical inshore fisheries. The arguments supporting <b>marine</b> <b>reserves</b> are often based on both the nonmarket values of ecological amenities <b>marine</b> <b>reserves</b> provide and the pragmatic cost-saving advantages relating to reserve monitoring and enforcement. <b>Marine</b> <b>reserves</b> are, however, only one of a suite of possible policy options that might be used to achieve conservation and fisheries management objectives, and have rarely been the focus of rigorous policy analyses that consider a full range of economic costs and benefits, including the transaction costs of management. If credible analyses are not undertaken, there is a danger that current enthusiasm for <b>marine</b> <b>reserves</b> may wane as economic performance fails to meet presumed potential. Fully accounting for the value of ecological services flowing from <b>marine</b> <b>reserves</b> requires consideration of increased size and abundance of focal species within reserve boundaries, emigration of target species from reserves to adjacent fishing grounds, changes in ecological resilience, and behavioural responses of fishers to spatially explicit closures. Expanding policy assessments beyond standard cost-benefit analysis (CBA) also requires considering the impact of social capital on the costs of managing fisheries. In the short term, the amount of social capital that communities possess and the capacity of the state to support the rights of individuals and communities will affect the relative efficiency of <b>marine</b> <b>reserves.</b> Reserves may be the most efficient policy option when both community and state capacity is high, but may not be when one and/or the other is weak. In the longer term, the level of social capital that a society possesses and the level of uncertainty in ecological and social systems will also impact the appropriate level of devolution or decentralization of fisheries governance. Determining the proper balance {{of the state and the}} community in tropical fisheries governance will require broad comparative studies of <b>marine</b> <b>reserves</b> and alternative policy tools...|$|R
