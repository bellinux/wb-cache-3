2500|$|In 2013, Smith {{introduced}} into the 113th Congress a similar but more expanded bill, H.R. 7, also titled the “No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion Act”, which, beyond its title prohibition, disallows as a medical income tax deduction any personal funds used for an abortion or expenses paid out of tax-exempt [...] "cafeteria" [...] health plans, or personally-funded Archer <b>Medical</b> <b>Savings</b> Accounts (MSAs) or health savings accounts (HSAs). The bill also excludes from {{the definition of a}} “qualified health plan” any insurance coverage that includes abortions, rendering such plans ineligible for a tax credit to individuals or employers. The bill was co-sponsored by 151 Republicans and three Democrats. Supporters claim that H.R. 7 is necessary because of provisions in the Affordable Care Act.|$|E
2500|$|HSAs {{are seen}} by proponents {{as a way}} to make {{healthcare}} more affordable and accessible in the U.S. The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act, which included provisions designed to stimulate the popularity of these plans, was passed by Congress in November 2003 and signed into law by President Bush in December 2003. The law expanded <b>medical</b> <b>savings</b> accounts, renaming them Health Savings Accounts and created tax incentives to encourage adoption of high-deductible health plans. Banks were empowered to create HSAs, which deliver tax-free interest to the holders, who can then withdraw money tax free to pay for qualified expenditures. To qualify for an HSA, the purchaser must also have a qualifying high-deductible health insurance plan. Over time, participants are allowed to contribute more (cumulatively) to the savings account than would be required to fulfill their annual deductible for a given year (although annual limits on pre-tax contributions [...] are well below the annual deductible), and any unused portions of the account accrue without tax penalty so long as the funds are used only for qualified medical expenses.|$|E

Withdrawals from MSA go toward paying the deductible expenses in a given year.
