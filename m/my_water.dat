25|$|Also in 2012, Disney Mobile {{launched}} a mobile game titled Where's My Perry? for iOS and Android. It {{was based on}} Disney's popular Where's <b>My</b> <b>Water?</b> game, using similar physics. In this game, Agent P {{is trying to get}} into O.W.C.A. headquarters but the transport tubes are out, so he needs water for the backup underground hydrogenerators. If you struggle or get stuck, Major Monogram and Carl will offer encouragement while Doofenshmirtz will taunt him. Phineas and Ferb never appear in the game except in the opening splash screen. The game was expanded to include levels featuring Doofenshmirtz and other animal agents. The game has a 4.0 rating on iTunes, but has not been updated in more than a year.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{featured}} a musical number sung by Cartman called [...] "Not <b>My</b> <b>Water</b> Park", {{in which he}} despairs over the number of minorities at the waterpark.

The day after [...] "Pee" [...] was originally broadcast, three different kinds of T-shirts and hooded sweatshirts based on the episode were made available on South Park Studios, the official website of South Park.

The second included Cartman and his quote from the episode, [...] "Your world is cold and void of any humanity".

500|$|Several {{original}} songs {{written by}} Parker and Stone were {{featured in the}} 13th season. The episode [...] "Fatbeard" [...] features a song, [...] "Somalian Pirates, We", in which Cartman and his crew of pirates sing {{in the style of}} the Golden Age of Piracy. In response to fan requests, the full 90-second version of the song was made available for download on South Park Studios the week the episode aired. The season finale, [...] "Pee", features a tune sung by Cartman, [...] "(Too Many Minorities) Not <b>My</b> <b>Water</b> Park", in which he despairs over the large number of African-American, Hispanic-American and Asian-American patrons at his water park. Among other topics, Cartman expresses his anger about long lines full of minorities and park employees speaking Spanish rather than English. The episode [...] "Eat, Pray, Queef" [...] features [...] "Queef Free", a charity single recorded by the men of South Park after they realize women should be free to queef just as men are free to fart. The song has been described as a parody of such celebrities-for-charity songs as [...] "We Are The World".|$|E
