In this research, {{a mixture of}} <b>manure</b> <b>fertilizer</b> and sugarcane bagasse {{is used as a}} biofilter media for an ammonia gas removal application. The aim of this research is to study the ammonia gas removal efficiency of such media. Approach: The experiments were conducted in laboratory-scale biofilters. Two inlet ammonia gas concentrations were used which are 500 and 1, 000 ppm. Three ratios of <b>manure</b> <b>fertilizer</b> and sugarcane bagasse were studied including 1 : 3, 1 : 5 and 1 : 7 by volume. All experiments were conducted for a period of 40 days. Two Empty Bed Retention Time (EBRT) of these experiments were used which is 39 s and 78 s. The moisture content of the biofilter media was maintained at 45 - 60 % by adding water. Results: The maximum ammonia gas removal efficiency at 89. 93 % is observed from the following conditions: 500 ppm of the inlet ammonia gas concentration, the <b>manure</b> <b>fertilizer</b> and sugarcane bagasse mixture ratio of 1 : 5 and the EBRT of 78 s.

40|$|The {{intensely}} weathered {{nature of}} soils used for cocoa production in Ghana, {{and the long}} history of nutrient depletion due to the absence of fertilization in this farming system have resulted in increased incidence of soil nutrient deficiencies in cocoa farms. The paper discusses the use of a soil diagnostic model combined with geographic information systems (GIS) to convert the current blanket fertilizer recommendations (0 N - 165 P. O, - 200 K. O kg ha 1) into a more effective recommendation that accounts for local land resources and the actual nutrient requirements of cocoa trees. A digital map of cocoa nutrient requirements was created based on climatic and soil groups/associations data. The results showed that about 95 % of the areas suitable for cocoa production are developed on only seven soil groups and four sub-groups (FAO classification). As inputs, 201 soil chemical analytic data were linked to land units to compute cocoa <b>fertilizer</b> <b>formulae</b> and doses. The number of <b>fertilizer</b> <b>formulae</b> was reduced to 32 using a fuzzy classification. Six <b>fertilizer</b> <b>formulae</b> would be sufficient to cover fertilizer recommendations for 52 % of the cocoa growing areas, while 16 <b>fertilizer</b> <b>formulae</b> will cover 90 % of the cocoa area. The current blanket <b>fertilizer</b> <b>formula</b> is only suitable for 6 % of the cocoa growing areas in Ghana. In western Ghana, where rainfall is over 1800 mm, the climatic influence is predominant and high leaching of soils is probably responsible for greater needs for P, than for K, Ca, and Mg. In eastern Ghana, where soils have high exchangeable cation levels and base saturation, soil diagnostic method suggested application of N fertilizers.
