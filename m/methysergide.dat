5000|$|Methylergometrine remains {{available}} in the US and is an active metabolite of <b>methysergide.</b> It is thought to carry the same risks and benefits as <b>methysergide</b> but has not been widely studied in migraine.|$|E
50|$|<b>Methysergide</b> is used {{to treat}} {{headaches}} such as migraine and other recurrent throbbing headaches. <b>Methysergide</b> {{is one of the}} most effective medications for the prevention of migraine, but not for the treatment of an acute attack.|$|E

50|$|Lithium, <b>methysergide,</b> and {{topiramate}} {{are recommended}} alternative treatments, {{although there is}} little evidence supporting the use of topiramate or <b>methysergide.</b> This is also true for tianeptine, melatonin and ergotamine. Valproate, sumatriptan and oxygen are not recommended as preventative measures. Botulinum toxin injections have shown limited success. Evidence for baclofen, botulinum toxin, and capsaicin is unclear.|$|E
50|$|<b>Methysergide</b> was {{approved}} by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1962.|$|E
5000|$|Examples include triptans such as {{zolmitriptan}} [...] and ergot alkaloids such as <b>methysergide.</b>|$|E
50|$|These drugs include {{ergotamine}} and <b>methysergide</b> {{and both}} drugs {{can also cause}} cardiac fibrosis.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Methysergide</b> is a 5-HT2A {{antagonist}} and nonselective 5-HT1 receptor blocker. It causes retroperitoneal fibrosis and mediastinal fibrosis.|$|E
5000|$|Methylergometrine is {{sometimes}} used for both prevention [...] and acute treatment of migraine. It {{is an active}} metabolite of <b>methysergide.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Methysergide</b> {{interacts with}} {{serotonin}} (5-HT) receptors. Its therapeutic effect in migraine prophylaxis {{has been associated}} with its antagonism at the 5-HT2B receptor.Furthermore, it is an antagonist at the 5-HT2C receptor, while at the 5-HT1A receptor it serves as a partial agonist. It is known to have partial agonist effects on some of the other 5-HT receptors as well. <b>Methysergide</b> is metabolised into methylergometrine in humans, which is responsible for its psychedelic effects.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Methysergide,</b> a {{congener}} of methylergonovine, used {{in treatment}} of migraine blocks 5-HT2A and 5-HT2C receptors, but sometimes acts as partial agonist, in some preparations.|$|E
50|$|<b>Methysergide</b> (1-methyl-D-lysergic acid butanolamide or UML-491) is a {{prescription}} drug formerly used for prophylaxis of cluster headaches/migraine headaches, but is no longer recommended due to retroperitoneal/retropulmonary fibrosis.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Methysergide</b> was {{withdrawn}} from the US market by Novartis, but is available in Canadian pharmacies. Although highly effective, it has rare but serious side effects, including retroperitoneal fibrosis.|$|E
50|$|Please note, that {{although}} some non-selective serotonin antagonists {{may have an}} particular affinity for a specific 5-HT receptor (and thus may be listed above e.g. <b>methysergide),</b> they still may also possess a generalised non-selective action.|$|E
50|$|Its {{association}} with various immune-related conditions {{and response to}} immunosuppression have led to speculation regarding an autoimmune cause of idiopathic RPF. One-third of the cases are secondary to malignancy, medication (<b>methysergide,</b> hydralazine, beta blockers), aortic aneurysm, or certain infections.|$|E
5000|$|... ==Psychotropic isolates== The {{headache}} medications cafergot, dihydroergotamine, <b>methysergide,</b> methylergometrine, the dementia medications hydergine, nicergoline, the Parkinson's disease medications lisuride, bromocriptine, cabergoline, and pergolide {{were all}} derived from Claviceps isolates. Polyozellus multiplex synthesizes prolyl endopeptidase inhibitors polyozellin, thelephoric acid, and kynapcins. Boletus badius synthesizes L-theanine.|$|E
50|$|Psychotropic {{compounds}} {{created from}} ergot alkaloids also include dihydroergotamine, <b>methysergide,</b> methylergometrine, hydergine, nicergoline, lisuride, bromocriptine, cabergoline, pergolide. Polyozellus multiplex synthesizes prolyl endopeptidase inhibitors polyozellin, thelephoric acid, kynapcins. Neurotrophic fungal isolates include L-theanine, tricholomalides, scabronines, termitomycesphins. Many fungi synthesize the partial, non-selective, serotonin receptor agonist/analog psilocin.|$|E
50|$|Zolmitriptan may {{increase}} blood pressure, {{it should not}} be given to patients with uncontrolled hypertension, should not be used within 24 hours of treatment with another 5-HT1 agonist, or an ergotamine-containing or ergot-type medication like dihydroergotamine or <b>methysergide,</b> and should not be administered to patients with hemiplegic or basilar migraine.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to the naturally occurring ergonovine (used as an oxytocic) and ergotamine (a vasoconstrictor used to control migraine), synthetic derivatives of importance are the oxytocic methergine, the anti-migraine drugs dihydroergotamine and <b>methysergide,</b> hydergine (a mixture of dihydroergotoxine mesylates, INN: ergoline mesylates), and bromocriptine, used for numerous purposes including treatment of Parkinson's disease. Newer synthetic ergolines used for Parkinson's disease include pergolide and lisuride.|$|E
50|$|As {{with other}} triptans, {{almotriptan}} {{should not be}} used in patients with a history, symptoms or signs of ischaemic heart disease (myocardial infarction, angina pectoris, documented silent ischaemia, Prinzmetal’s angina) or severe hypertension and uncontrolled mild or moderate hypertension.Other contraindications are previous cerebrovascular accident (CVA) or transient ischaemic attack (TIA), peripheral vascular disease, severe hepatic impairment, concomitant administration of ergotamine, ergotamine derivatives (including <b>methysergide)</b> and other 5-HT1B/D agonists.|$|E
50|$|While many {{treatments}} for migraines have been attempted, {{it was not}} until 1868 that use of a substance which eventually turned out to be effective began. This substance was the fungus ergot from which ergotamine was isolated in 1918. <b>Methysergide</b> was developed in 1959 and the first triptan, sumatriptan, was developed in 1988. During the 20th century with better study design effective preventative measures were found and confirmed.|$|E
50|$|Some serotonergic agonist drugs cause {{fibrosis}} {{anywhere in}} the body, particularly the syndrome of retroperitoneal fibrosis, as well as cardiac valve fibrosis.In the past, three groups of serotonergic drugs have been epidemiologically linked with these syndromes. These are the serotonergic vasoconstrictive antimigraine drugs (ergotamine and <b>methysergide),</b> the serotonergic appetite suppressant drugs (fenfluramine, chlorphentermine, and aminorex), and certain anti-Parkinsonian dopaminergic agonists, which also stimulate serotonergic 5-HT2B receptors.

50|$|Flumedroxone acetate {{is said to}} have weak or slight progestogenic {{activity}} without other hormonal activity (including estrogenic, antiestrogenic, androgenic, anabolic, or glucocorticoid). It has been assessed in over 1,000 patients for the treatment of migraine, with effectiveness ranging from excellent to less than that of the reference antimigraine drug <b>methysergide.</b> In keeping with its {{progestogenic activity}}, flumedroxone acetate produces menstrual irregularities, namely polymenorrhea, and breast tension as side effects in women. Other progestogens including medroxyprogesterone acetate, lynestrenol, allylestrenol, dydrogesterone, and normethandrone have also been found to be effective for migraine in a high percentage of women.|$|E
50|$|Chronic daily {{administration}} of migraine prophylactic drugs (topiramate, valproate, propranolol, amitriptyline, and <b>methysergide)</b> dose-dependently suppressed frequency of CSD induced by continuous cortical application of 1 M KCl solution. However lamotrigine (a drug with specific anti-aura action, but no efficacy in migraine in general) has a marked suppressive effect which correlates with its rather selective {{action on the}} migraine aura. Valproate and riboflavin were shown to {{have no effect on}} the triggering of cortical spreading depression though they are effective in migraine without aura. Taken together, these results are compatible with a causal role of cortical spreading depression in migraine with aura, but not in migraine without aura.|$|E
5000|$|Scotty Cramp {{occurs in}} puppies and young dogs. Symptoms present after {{exercise}} or excitement and last a few minutes. A goose-stepping gait and arched spine are often seen, {{and the dogs}} may turn somersaults as it runs. The symptoms usually resolve after ten minutes, but they may repeat several times in a day. [...] If the diagnosis is unsure, a dose of <b>methysergide</b> can be given. In affected dogs, this will block serotonin and increase the frequence and severity of the symptoms. [...] Diazepam or acepromazine is used to control the symptoms of Scotty Cramp. Vitamin E may also be of some benefit. [...] Because Scotty Cramp is inherited, affected dogs and their parents and siblings should not be bred.|$|E
50|$|The drug is in {{decreasing}} use, as it {{was reported}} in 2003 to be associated with a form of heart disease called cardiac fibrosis. In 2007, The United States Food and Drug Administration announced a voluntary withdrawal of the drug by manufacturers due to the possibility of heart valve damage. Pergolide is not currently available in the United States for human use. This problem is thought to be due to pergolide's action at the 5-HT2B serotonin receptors of cardiac myocytes, causing proliferative valve disease by the same mechanism as ergotamine, <b>methysergide,</b> fenfluramine, and other serotonin 5-HT2B agonists, including serotonin itself when elevated in the blood in carcinoid syndrome. Pergolide can rarely cause Raynaud's phenomenon. Among similar antiparkinsonian drugs, cabergoline but not lisuride exhibit this same type of serotonin receptor binding. In January, 2007, cabergoline (Dostinex) was reported also to be associated with valvular proliferation heart damage. In March 2007, pergolide was withdrawn from the U.S. market for human use, due to serious valvular damage that was shown in two independent studies.|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} <b>methysergide</b> (1 mg, p. o.), {{clonidine}} (50 micrograms, i. m.) and <b>methysergide</b> plus clonidine on growth hormone (GH) and prolactin (PRL) secretion in 8 normal male volunteers have been studied. Both <b>methysergide</b> and clonidine {{were found to}} enhance GH and to lower PRL plasma levels. The effects of <b>methysergide</b> are explained {{on the basis of}} a preferential action of <b>methysergide</b> metabolites on dopamine receptors, whereas the effects of clonidine are attributed to a stimulatory action on adrenaline receptors. The combined treatment <b>methysergide</b> plus clonidine resulted in a potentiation of the effects caused by the drugs when administered alone...|$|E
40|$|The {{case history}} {{of a young woman}} who {{developed}} severe mitral regurgitation after four years of <b>methysergide</b> therapy is reported. Replacement of the mitral valve was required. A brief review of the toxic effects of <b>methysergide</b> is given and special reference is made to lesions of the heart valves that have occurred during <b>methysergide</b> therapy...|$|E
40|$|<b>Methysergide</b> (Sansert) {{has been}} {{associated}} with numerous fibrotic disorders. In particular, multiple cardiac lesions have been described in cases where <b>methysergide</b> was thought to have played a causative role. A patient is described who presented with cardiac findings suggestive of acute myopericarditis. An inflammatory myocarditis was subsequently excluded by endomyocar- dial biopsy. Hemodynamic findings suggested the presence of constrictive pericarditis or restrictive cardiomyopathy, or both. Radiographic evidence of constrictive pericarditis and biopsy evidence of endocardial fibrosis were documented in this patient with a long history of interrupted <b>methysergide</b> therapy...|$|E
40|$|In this study, flunarizine, a {{selective}} calcium-channel blocker, was {{employed in the}} prophylactic treatment of headache and was compared with <b>methysergide</b> in terms of efficacy. The trial was conducted with 104 patients (53 treated with flunarizine and 51 treated with <b>methysergide)</b> and lasted six months [...] one month of pretreatment and five months of therapy. Patients in both groups experienced a highly significant {{reduction in the number}} and duration of migraine attacks.

40|$|The {{effects of}} the {{selective}} 5 -HT$ sb{ rm 1 A}$ receptor agonist flesinoxan on neuroendocrine function, temperature, and behavior were assessed in healthy male volunteers using a double-blind, placebo-controlled cross over design. Flesinoxan (7 and 14 $ mu$g/kg) administered intravenously in 11 healthy volunteers, elicited a dose-related decrease in body temperature {{and an increase in}} growth hormone, ACTH, cortisol and prolactin plasma levels. In a second independent study, 12 healthy volunteers were pretreated with either the 5 -HT$ sb{ rm 1 A}$ antagonist pindolol (30 mg, p. o.), the non-selective 5 -HT$ sb 1 $- 5 -HT$ sb 2 $ antagonist, <b>methysergide</b> (4 mg, p. o.), or placebo prior to being administered of flesinoxan (1 mg, i. v.). The growth hormone response to flesinoxan was blocked by pindolol but not by <b>methysergide</b> whereas the prolactin response was blocked by <b>methysergide</b> but not by pindolol. The ACTH and cortisol response to flesinoxan were potentiated by <b>methysergide.</b> The flesinoxan-induced hypothermia was attenuated by both <b>methysergide</b> and pindolol, although the latter effect did not reach statistical significance. The present results suggest that the growth hormone response, {{and to a lesser extent}} the hypothermic response to intravenous infusion of flesinoxan may serve as a valid index of 5 -HT$ sb{ rm 1 A}$ receptor function in human...|$|E
40|$|Neuropeptide Y (NPY) is {{a potent}} central {{appetite}} stimulant found in hypothalamic neurons that have close anatomical associations with neurons containing serotonin, a powerful anorectic agent. To determine whether the two neurotransmitters interact functionally, we have studied the effects on regional hypothalamic NPY concentrations of acute and chronic administration of <b>methysergide,</b> a 5 -HT 1 BC/ serotonin receptor antagonist. Chronic <b>methysergide</b> treatment (10 mg/kg/day) was given by subcutaneously implanted osmotic minipumps (n = 8). Acute effects of <b>methysergide</b> were determined 4 h after a single injection (10 mg/kg) in a separate group (n = 8). Controls (n = 8) had implanted minipumps delivering saline, and also received a saline injection 4 h before sacrifice. Food intake was significantly increased (p < 0. 01) by both acute and chronic <b>methysergide</b> treatment. In the chronically treated rats, NPY levels were significantly increased over controls in the arcuate nucleus (ARC; by 41 %, p = 0. 02) and paraventricular nucleus (PVN; by 40 %, p < 0. 01). Acute <b>methysergide</b> treatment also increased NPY concentrations in the ARC (by 81 %, p < 0. 01) and PVN (by 30 %, p < 0. 01). <b>Methysergide</b> administration, which stimulated feeding, therefore raised NPY concentrations in the ARC, where NPY is synthesized, and in the PVN, a major site of NPY release where NPY injection induces hyperphagia. These findings suggest that NPYergic and serotoninergic innervations in the hypothalamus interact to regulate food intake, and raise the possibility that increased NPY release may mediate the hyperphagic effect of serotoninergic 5 -HT 1 BC/ receptor blockade...|$|E
