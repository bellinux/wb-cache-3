40|$|Purpose: To {{establish}} the additional value of 3 D {{magnetic resonance spectroscopy}} (3 D-MRS) imaging to endorectal MR imaging in the diagnosis of prostrate cancer in the peripheral zone. Materials <b>and</b> methods: <b>MR</b> imaging <b>and</b> <b>MRS</b> imaging were performed in 79 patients with suspicion of prostate cancer {{on the basis of}} digital rectal exploration, transrectal ultrasound and PSA level. All the examinations were performed with 1. 5 T MR scan using an endorectal coil (transverse and coronal FSE T 2 -weighted sequences, axial SE T 1 -weighted and PRESS 3 D CSI). MR examinations have been evaluated by two Radiologists blind of the clinical data in a "per patients" analysis. <b>MR</b> imaging <b>and</b> <b>MRS</b> imaging findings were compared with the result of histological data from radical prostatectomy in 53 patients and biopsy in 17 patients. Results: Nine patients (11. 4 %) were excluded because of serious artefacts in the MR spectrum. The reported values of sensitivity, specificity, PPV <b>and</b> NPV for <b>MR</b> imaging alone were respectively 84 %, 50 %, 76 % and 63 % (LR+ 1. 7; LR- 0. 3). Instead the reported values of sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV for the combination of MR imaging to MRS imaging were respectively 89 %, 79 %, 89 % and 79 % (LR+ 4. 28; LR- 0. 14).

40|$|Abstract — Emerging and {{established}} methods, such as optical imaging <b>and</b> <b>MR</b> spectroscopy (<b>MRS),</b> offer {{new opportunities for}} in situ biosensing. The limited tissue penetration of these modalities can be addressed by locally placing the sensor via minimally invasive transneedle or transcatheter access. This work introduces a generic system that mechanically scans an area of interest with a sensor, capable of generating 1 D scans while registering them to a guiding modality. Computer simulations illustrate the operation of this approach for a miniature RF coil as the mechanically scanned biosensor. Experimental studies demonstrated the approach on phantoms, using MRI as the guiding modality, and an MRcompatible manipulator, which carried a miniature RF coil, was used to scan <b>and</b> collect <b>MRS</b> <b>and</b> generated 1 D MRS scans coregistered to the guiding MRI.

40|$|We report {{magnetic}} resonance (MR) imaging findings including diffusion-weighted imaging <b>and</b> proton <b>MR</b> spectroscopy findings {{in a patient}} with infantile Refsum disease.

40|$|Background: Lymphocytic {{vasculitis}} of {{the central}} nervous system is an uncommon subtype of primary angiitis {{of the central}} nervous system (PACNS) - a rare inflammatory disorder affecting parenchymal and leptomeningeal arteries and veins. Case Report: Establishing diagnosis on the basis of neuroimaging only is difficult, as it can mimic a brain tumor. Thus, histological diagnosis is essential for appropriate management. We present a case of biopsy-proven lymphocytic vasculitis mimicking a brain tumor on neuroimaging that was subsequently successfully treated with steroid therapy. We also discuss the findings in perfusion <b>MR</b> (PWI) <b>and</b> <b>MR</b> spectroscopy (<b>MRS).</b> Conclusions: Regional hypoperfusion on PWI and elevation of glutamate and glutamine levels on MRS (without associated typical tumor spectra) are common findings in inflammatory disorders, including PACNS, and can be useful in differential diagnosis with tumors...|$|R
40|$|Background: It is of {{significant}} importance {{to assess the}} extent of hepatic steatosis in living donor liver transplant (LDLT) surgery to ensure optimum graft regeneration as well as donor safety. Aim: To establish the accuracy of non-invasive imaging methods including computed tomography (CT), dual-echo in- and opposed-phase magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), <b>and</b> <b>MR</b> spectroscopy (<b>MRS)</b> for quantification of liver fat content (FC) in prospective LDLT donors with histopathology as reference standard. Settings and Design: This retrospective study was conducted at our institution on LDLT donors being assessed for biliary and vascular anatomy depiction by Magnetic Resonance Cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) and CT scan, respectively, between July 2013 and October 2014. Materials and Methods: Liver FC was measured in 73 donors by dual-echoT 1 MRI <b>and</b> <b>MRS.</b> Of these, CT liver attenuation index (LAI) values were available in 62 patients. Statistical Analysis: CT and MRI FC were correlated with histopathological reference standard using Spearman correlation coefficient. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predicative value, and positive and negative likelihood ratios with 95 % confidence intervals were obtained. Results: CT LAI, dual-echo MRI, <b>and</b> <b>MRS</b> correlated well with the histopathology results (r = 0. 713, 0. 871, and 0. 882, respectively). An accuracy of 95 % and 96 % was obtained for dual-echo MRI <b>and</b> <b>MRS</b> in FC estimation with their sensitivity being 97 % and 94 %, respectively. False-positive rate, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predicative value (NPV) were 0. 08, 0. 92, and 0. 97, respectively, for dual-echo MRI and 0. 03, 0. 97, and 0. 95, respectively, for MRS. CT LAI method of fat estimation has a sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV of 73 %, 77. 7 %, 70. 4 %, and 80 %, respectively. Conclusion: Dual-echo MRI, <b>MRS,</b> <b>and</b> CT LAI are accurate measures to quantify the degree of hepatic steatosis in LDLT donors, thus reducing the need for invasive liver biopsy and its associated complications. Dual-echo MRI <b>and</b> <b>MRS</b> results correlate better with histological results in the study, as compared to CT LAI method for fat quantification...|$|R
