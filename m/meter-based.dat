50|$|There are two taxi {{systems in}} Israel, with one {{operating}} {{as a standard}} taxi service and the other (taxi - sherut) as {{a cross between a}} taxi and a private bus system. The latter tends to run longer journeys or particular routes and is effectively a shared taxi - hence set pick up and set down locations but also potentially picking up or dropping off anywhere en route. Although fares are officially <b>meter-based,</b> it is quite common to agree the fare in advance with the driver. They have a directory guide for prices and will show the estimated alternative to the meter price, either to be accepted, negotiated or rejected by the traveler if the meter is preferred. The wisdom of the choice may be based on time of day and traffic and whether you have bags etc. which could cost more on the meter as each piece adds a set amount. Either way the eventual fare is not usually significantly different so many Israelis choose the meter without a thought. Tipping is not required but rounding up is common.|$|E
40|$|Inside the Juror (Hastie 1994) was, in a sense, a {{point of}} arrival for {{research}} developing formalisms that describe judicial decision making. <b>Meter-based</b> models of various kinds were mature, and even ready for giving way to such models that would concern themselves with the narrative content of the cases at hand, that a court is called to decide upon. Moreover, excessive {{emphasis was placed on}} lay factfinders, i. e. on jurors. It is noticeable that as ‘‘AI & Law’ ’ has become increasingly concerned with evidence in recent years with efforts coordinated by Nissan & Martino, Zeleznikow, and others the baggage of the <b>meter-based</b> models from jury research {{does not appear to be}} exploited. In this article, we try to combine their tradition with a technique of belief revision from artificial intelligence, in an attempt to provide an architectural component that would be complementary to models that apply representations or reasoning to legal narrative content...|$|E
40|$|Three {{experiments}} investigated whether adding metric (higher-order, periodic) {{structure to}} tone sequences stabilizes syncopated finger tapping. Participants tapped in antiphase with metronomic tone sequences in which accents—produced by sounding two tones simultaneously—occurred regularly every two, three, or four tones (metric), occurred unpredictably (irregular), occurred on every tone (heavy beat), or were absent (light beat). Tap timing variability, although commensurate with metric and light beat sequences, was lower with metric than with heavy beat and irregular sequences {{even when the}} instructions specified using metric grouping in all conditions. Higher-order periodic fluctuations (delays) in tap timing—found only in metric conditions—were associated with low overall tap timing variability, suggesting that a regularly applied, <b>meter-based</b> phase-resetting mechanism stabilizes syncopation...|$|E
40|$|The use of {{domestic}} electrical energy monitoring systems {{is becoming more}} common however gas usage has received comparatively little attention. This paper presents a new technique for monitoring gas-powered heating and hot water usage in the home integrated into a prototype energy monitoring platform. Compared to usual <b>meter-based</b> approaches this technique provides finer-grained usage data and uses simple temperature sensors. The main motivation for this work is to provide more meaningful energy information to users for inclusion in novel mobile and embedded applications. This is part of ongoing work which aims to reduce energy use among teenagers in the UK and make lasting attitude changes. The development and findings from a prototype deployed in a typical UK house over 7 days are presented. The findings highlight {{the utility of the}} technique and simplicity of the sensing approach. The novel requirements that inspired the development of this technique are also presented...|$|E
40|$|Work {{stealing}} is {{a promising}} approach to constructing multithreaded program runtimes of parallel programming languages. This paper presents HERMES, an energy-efficient work-stealing language runtime. The key insight is that threads in a work-stealing environment – thieves and victims – have varying {{impacts on the}} overall program running time, and a coordination of their execution “tempo ” can lead to energy efficiency with minimal performance loss. The centerpiece of HERMES is two complementary algorithms to coordinate thread tempo: the workpath-sensitive algorithm determines tempo for each thread based on thief-victim relationships on the execution path, whereas the workload-sensitive algorithm selects appropriate tempo based {{on the size of}} work-stealing deques. We construct HERMES on top of Intel Cilk Plus’s runtime, and implement tempo adjustment through standard Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling (DVFS). Benchmarks running on HERMES demonstrate an average of 11 - 12 % energy savings with an average of 3 - 4 % performance loss through <b>meter-based</b> measurements over commercial CPUs. 1...|$|E
40|$|A new {{three-phase}} (oil/water/gas) {{flow metering}} {{system has been}} developed {{for use in the}} oil and gas industries, based on Coriolis mass flow metering. To obtain certification for use in the Russian oil and gas industries, trials have taken place at the UK and Russian national flow laboratories, NEL in Glasgow and VNIIR in Kazan, respectively. The metrology of three-phase flow is complex, and the uncertainty of each measurement varies dynamically with the operating point, as well as the metering technology, and other aspects. To a limited extent this is reflected in the error limits allowed in national standards, which may vary with operating point. For example, the GOST standard allows errors in the oil flow rate of ± 6 % for water cuts of less than 70 %, which is increased to ± 15 % for water cuts between 70 and 95 %. The provision of online uncertainty for each measurement, for example in accordance with the British Standard BS- 7986, would be highly desirable, allowing the user to observe in real time variations in measurement quality. This paper will discuss how an online uncertainty assessment could be implemented in the Coriolis <b>meter-based</b> system...|$|E
40|$|Objectives: Measurement of mean {{population}} sodium and potassium intake typically using laboratory -based assays which can add significant logistical burden and costs. A valid field-based measurement method {{would be a}} significant advance. In this study, we used 166 24 -hour urine collection samples to compare estimates of sodium, potassium content and sodium/potassium ratio based upon assays done using the field- based Horiba twin meter versus a laboratory-based method. Design: Aliquots of urine were assayed for sodium and potassium using the ion-selective electrode method with the field-based Horiba twin meter and the laboratory-based method. The performance of the Horiba twin meter was determined by comparing field-based estimates of mean sodium and potassium against those obtained using the laboratory- based methods. Setting: 24 -hour urine samples were collected {{as part of an}} ongoing study being done in rural China. Subjects: There were 166 subjects complete 24 -hour urine samples available for estimating 24 -hour urinary sodium and potassium excretion. Results: Mean sodium and potassium excretion were estimated as 170. 4 mol/day and 37. 4 mmol/day using the <b>meter-based</b> assays and 193. 4 mmol/day and 43. 8 mmol/day using the laboratory-based assays. There was excellent relative reliability for both sodium (ICC= 0. 986) and potassium (ICC= 0. 986). Bland-Altman plots showed moderate-to-good agreement between two methods. Conclusions: Sodium and potassium intake estimation was moderately under- estimated using assays based upon the Horiba twin meter. Compared to standard lab-based methods, the portable device was more practical and convenient...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: It has {{recently}} been shown that using battery storage systems (BSSs) to provide reactive power provision in a medium-voltage (MV) active distribution network (ADN) with embedded wind stations (WSs) {{can lead to a}} huge amount of reverse power to an upstream transmission network (TN). However, unity power factors (PFs) of WSs were assumed in those studies to analyze the potential of BSSs. Therefore, in this paper (Part-I), we aim to further explore the pure reactive power potential of WSs (i. e., without BSSs) by investigating the issue of variable reverse power flow under different limits on PFs in an electricity market model. The main contributions of this work are summarized as follows: (1) Introducing the reactive power capability of WSs in the optimization model of the active-reactive optimal power flow (A-R-OPF) and highlighting the benefits/impacts under different limits on PFs. (2) Investigating the impacts of different agreements for variable reverse power flow on the operation of an ADN under different demand scenarios. (3) Derivation of the function of reactive energy losses in the grid with an equivalent-pi circuit and comparing its value with active energy losses. (4) Balancing the energy curtailment of wind generation, active-reactive energy losses in the grid and active-reactive energy import-export by a <b>meter-based</b> method. In Part-II, the potential of the developed model is studied through analyzing an electricity market model and a 41 -bus network with different locations of WSs...|$|E
40|$|The {{main reason}} Lima failed to {{implement}} a concession was geographical: the scarcity of water sources meant high marginal costs, partly for pumping water from deep wells and building adequate storage for dry periods. High extraction costs were compounded by years of neglect; much of the system needed to be replaced. Attracting private investors meant setting prices high enough to recover these high costs and provide a reasonable return on capital. But the government had subsidized costs for years, so a concession would have required a sharp and sudden price increase to cover marginal costs. Moreover, any forward-looking investor would want to slow the pace of future investment by curbing demand through more effective (<b>meter-based)</b> bill collection. And cross-subsidies, which reduce the incentive to conserve water, {{would also have to}} be reduced. The ultimate cause of the concession's failure was geographical but the proximate cause was political. Privatizing a utility is politically tricky if it involves higher prices and the controversial ceding of monopoly powers to private parties, especially foreigners. Private participation in water is further hampered by the social importance of water and by the lack of international experience and the technical difficulties in designing privatization reform in the sector. At the same time, water offers fewer benefits than other utlities [...] few revenues to reward supporters or compensate losers [...] and the price increases likely in Peru would especially hurt the urban poor, who were important to the president's support base. After a favorable start, the political equation shifted against privatization. The concession's failure was costly, in access goals not fully met, in adverse effects on health, and in the failure to curb consumption through metering [...] and hence in continued depletion of the aquifer and its increasing contamination by ocean salt. Peru's institutional weaknesses, especially its lack of an autonomous judiciary, might have limited how much could have been achieved. But considering the net gains from private operation in the much weaker nstitutional settings in Africa, Lima would probably have been better off with a concession.
