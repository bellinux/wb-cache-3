X-ray powder diffraction data and thermal cmwes show clearly the presence of hydrated halloysite, and on closer examination de-hydrated halloysite and {{a small amount of}} montmorillonite can be detected. The presence of allophane as an accessory mineral is suggested in certain specimens. Furthermore the degree of crystallinity of hydrated hanoysite varies slightly from specimen to specimen. The variation of the degree of crystatlinity of the hydrated halloysite and of the kinds and amounts of accessory clay minerals, and the variation of the shapes of the particles observed in the electron micrographs are generally related to each other. Hydrated halloysite of a relatively well ~ sort generally co-exists with halloysite (dehydrated) and consists of elongated crystals having sharp edges; rounded grains are composed entirely of these fibrous crystals. On the other hand, a poorly crystallized sort tends to be associated with allophane and to show extremely fine hairlike, twisted fibers; these are associated with well-defined rounded grains.

Minerals of the clay fractions of soil samples taken from the soil profiles which were shaved from erosion, and mud samples deposited from the flood water have been investigated by the chemical and differential thermal analyses, and the x-ray diffraction and electron <b>micrographic</b> <b>methods.</b> The volcanic ash soil from which the alluvial soils were derived, contains allophane and hydrated halloysite as main clay minerals. In fact, its surface horizon, derived from comparatively fresh ash, contains allophane in general, whereas the lower one, derived from old ash, has some hydrated halloysite in addition to allophane. The former horizon is very porous and permeable, but the latter one shows somewhat poor internal drainage and compactness. As one would expect from these characteristics of the horizons, the erosion was carried out in the surface layers containing chiefly allophane in the clay fraction. The alluvial soils of the river contain allophane with hydrated halloysite, which is seen in more quantities in the soils of the lower reaches than in the upper reaches. The mineralogical composition of the clay separates from horizons of the alluvial profile, is closely similar regardless of their depth. It would be suggested that soil materials of the alluvial soil at a certain site have come from the same location by the similar means in comparatively recent years. It means that the soil erosion, such as that which happened in 1953, has been repeated {{over and over again in}} the basin of the Shira River...|$|R

Since rubber can undergo large deformations the material is modeled using nonlinear viscoelastic techniques. In particular the material has been modeled using Schapery's correspondence principles. This is similar to traditional timetemperature superposition where changes in stress or strain compress or expand the time scale.

The Anderson-Dodds scaling model is applied to quantify the effects of finite size on J contour integral values for structures containing a/W=O. l and a/W= 0. 5 fillet weld toe cracks loaded in bending and in tension. The negligible effect of material mismatch for the aforementioned structures containing 20 % overmatched weldments (weld material stronger than parent material), and 20 % undermatched (parent material stronger than weld material) weldments is also shown via application of the AndersonDodds scaling model.

A method of rapidly identifying linear viscoelastic material properties is Dynamic Mechanical Analysis (DMA). DMA, although proven as a method to quickly and accurately determine linear material properties, has not been extended for use of nonlinear characterizations. Creep and recovery tests have been the most widely used procedures for characterizing nonlinear material properties, however, these tests are time consuming and tedious. An approach is presented here which uses DMA to identify nonlinear material properties. The technique utilizes the speed in which properties are identified using DMA, but, like creep and recovery tests, the data provide more detail and information. The proposed method implements a dynamic or oscillatory input in Schapery's nonlinear viscoelastic model. This oscillatory input is accounted for by using a Taylor series expansion on the mean stress of the nonlinear viscoelastic model. These theoretical developments for nonlinear DMA are correlated to an experimental procedure which is introduced as a tool for nonlinear viscoelastic material characterization. Thin film polyethylene is characterized by the experimental procedure developed herein and is used as a validation of the nonlinear DMA theory...|$|R

These methods are combinations of selected, existing methods for trajectory optimization. The focus of this thesis is to obtain solutions to a class of trajectories that are typical to the Mars Sample Return mission. These involve several natural segments such as escape, heliocentric transfer, and capture. A suitable method or combinations thereof is sought for each segment. Both accuracy and sensitivity are the main criteria used to determine the acceptability of the method chosen. Segments of a trajectory are patched together in the transition regions to satisfy continuity conditions. The optimization process is applied to the complete mission instead of each individual segment. Two classes of trajectories are examined: 1) Transfer from specified states in the heliocentric phase to a desired High-Earth Orbit (HEO) and 2) Transfer from Low-Mars Orbit (LMO) to the Low-Earth Orbit (LEO). The proposed hybrid method for the first class of trajectories is a combination of the Collocation and Control Parameterization approaches. The LMO-LEO trajectories are more difficult to solve. A combination of the Edelbaum approximation, control parameterization, and COV methods is proposed for this class of trajectories. Multiple attracting centers have been considered.

This method, derived from the Capacity Spectrum Method, can be used by practicing engineers in the design of new buildings and in the evaluation of existing buildings and retrofit methods. Capacity curves for the overall structure and for each story level are established from an inelastic pushover analysis. The pushover analysis is based on stiffness dependent story shear demands. Seismic story demand points for a given earthquake are determined for initial elastic response and for various levels of structural ductility using response spectrum analysis and modal superposition. The increase in total equivalent viscous damping during the shaking due to the development of hysteretic damping is reflected in the demand points. These points are then joined to form individual demand curves for each story and for the overall structural response. The demand curves are then superimposed onto the capacity curves. The proposed procedure is applied to a one-third scale, three story reinforced concrete frame model building which was subjected to successive shaking table excitations and to the same building after retrofit subjected to the same shaking table excitations. The predicted response found using this method are compared to experimental measurements obtained in the shaking table tests and to the results from nonlinear dynamic analyses. Various additional earthquakes are then used to excite the buildings in order to demonstrate the predictive use of this method. The predicted analytical response from these additional excitations are compared with results obtained from nonlinear dynamic analyses.

The titanium metal matrix composite, SCS- 6 /Ti[] 21 S [0] 4 was fatigue tested at 482 [] C and 650 [] C. The material was also oxidized at 700 C and then fatigued at 482 [] C to failure. Oxidation studies were performed on Ti-[] 21 S to correlate microstructural changes with a loss in mechanical properties. The research focuses on initial oxygen dissolution and its effect on the life of the material. The life limiting physical mechanisms identified were material inelasticity, surface embrittlement and subsequent surface cracking, fiber/matrix debonding, fiber-bridging, and eventual fiber failure. Material inelasticity was predicted using Bodner's unified viscoplastic model. Crack propagation was modeled via the inclusion of cohesive zone elements. Surface embrittlement was accounted for through a degradation in mechanical properties. Both monotonic and fatigue loadings were modeled at 482 []C and 650 []C for oxidized and unoxidized specimens. Considering monotonic data, surface cracks propagated sooner and farther in an elastic analysis than in a viscoplastic analysis. Considering cyclic fatigue, the effects of matrix viscoplasticity and surface cracking in oxidized specimens shed load to the fiber. The strength of the fiber, and in turn, composite is directly related to a critical fiber stress. Due to the enormous computational time required, only 14 cycles were predicted. However, the fiber stress in the oxidized composite was significantly higher than in the unoxidized composite. This difference apparently leads to the premature failure of the oxidized composite...|$|R

Acoustic sperm whale distributions were determined via a passive towed array along the continental slope of the northwestern and central Gulf of Mexico. Sperm whale distributions were random with respect to season, time of day, contour index, and Beaufort states. However, their distributions were not random across cruises, bottom depths, or dynamic sea height.

The study focuses on establishing where cocoa bean prices are discovered and whether FF cocoa price for Trinidad and Tobago (T&T) is established independently, through interaction, and/or dominated by any of the markets. It also investigates the impact of these prices on exports from Trinidad and Tobago. Four quarterly price series (London and New York futures, and Ecuador and T&T domestic prices) and exports from T&T are used over the period 1973 - 2000 to study possible cointegration or long-run relationships in the cocoa market. A dynamic error-correction model (ECM) using Johansen's procedure is estimated. Analysis of the estimated ECM is offered using directed graphs, impulse response functions and error decomposition analyses. The results of the cointegration analyses showed that except for T&T's price, the London, New York and Ecuador prices and exports from T&T formed two long run equilibrium relationships. Exports from T&T were not weakly exogenous. Error decomposition results indicated that London was exogenous, T&T was moderately exogenous, while New York and Ecuador were endogenous. Price in the New York market had a stronger influence on exports from T&T than did price in the London market. The impulse response functions showed that the London market had a strong influence on the other cocoa markets. Increased exports from T&T had small positive effects on the prices in all other markets. An export strategy for T&T may consider current and past London prices and its domestic prices in forecasting its own future price. The New York market should be considered in the export equation.

The theory behind the convergence rate relationship and storage requirements for the preconditioned conjugate gradient methods using the diagonal scaling, incomplete Cholesky decomposition and SSOR preconditioners is explained in detail in this study. Sparse matrix storage techniques, such as profile, element-by-element, and compact row storage, are described along with the redefined matrix operations for each storage technique which must be used to eliminate the operations on zero elements. A procedure to directly assemble the global stiffness in compact row storage format from element stiffness matrices is introduced. Numerical studies have been performed to compare the storage requirements, the convergence rate, and the solution time for the direct and PCG methods using various storage formats. Effects of different material properties and external loading on the convergence rate and solution time are also analyzed. The test problems for this study are based on the three-dimensional linear elasticity finite element equations. The physical memory of 64 MB of RAM of the IBM RISC/ 6000 Model 355 workstation was the limiting factor for the size of the sparse linear system that could be solved in this study.

This thesis reports results of a study of the cytotoxicity of radiolabeled transferrin in cultured leukemic cells. K- 562 cells, from an erythroleukemic cell line, were grown and growth curves were plotted for characterization. K- 562 cells grew logarithmically from approximately 250, 000 cells mL?? to 700, 000 cells mL?? and display a doubling time of approximately 20 - 21 hours. K- 562 cells were exposed to x rays at an absorbed dose of 0, 1, 2, and 4 gray. Growth curves were plotted to create a dose response curve. Percent-cell survival in this experiment, and all subsequent experiments, was determined based on the extrapolation of the growth curves to time zero, as compared to a control. An absorbed dose of 1, 2, and 4 gray corresponded to a survival of 77 ([] 14) %, 45 ([] 7. 4) % and 20 ([] 2. 4) %, respectively. This cell line is relatively resistant to radiation. K- 562 cells were exposed to a radioactive gallium- 72 /stable gallium nitrate mixture to determine the effect gallium- 72 decay has on cell survival. Simultaneously, K- 562 cells were exposed to a concentration of stable gallium nitrate equivalent to the total gallium concentration, radioactive and stable, of the gallium- 72 /stable gallium mixture. This allowed a comparison of radioactive and chemotoxic effects due to gallium- 72 and stable gallium, respectively. Exposures to gallium- 72, at an activity of 184. 0 kBq mL??, and stable gallium nitrate, at a concentration of 116. 7 []M, resulted in a cell survival of 61 ([] 10. 5) % and 75 ([] 12. 1) %, respectively. The difference is small when error is taken into consideration. Therefore radioactivity had little effect on cell survival at a specific activity of 6. 3 MBq mg??. To properly assess the cytotoxicity of gallium- 72 the specific activity must be increased. To determine the effect of ape-transferrin on the cytotoxicity of gallium nitrate, K- 562 cells were exposed to stable gallium nitrate and increasing amounts of apo-transferrin. Cells exposed to 115. 0 []M gallium nitrate exhibited an 82 ([] 8. 8) % cell survival compared to 54 ([] 6. 9) % following exposure to 115. 0 []M gallium nitrate and 3. 75 []M apo-transferrin. Apo-transferrin presumably increases cellular uptake of gallium nitrate thereby increasing its cyctotoxic effects...|$|R

Issued also on microfiche from Lange <b>Micrographics.</b> Two objective <b>methods</b> to determine texture of corn masa using the TA. XT 2 texture analyzer were developed and compared with subjective evaluations of the texture and machinability of corn masas from nixtarnalized corn flours used for tortillas and tacos. Several methods to form masa in an objective repeatable way were developed during this study. The TPA analysis measurements included hardness, adhesiveness, cohesiveness, springiness, gumminess, and chewiness. The TPA hardness values were the most highly correlated with subjective texture values and had the lowest coefficient of variation. The TPA adhesiveness values were correlated with subjective masa texture measurements; however, the coefficient of variation was high (50 %) which limited its acceptability for measuring masa stickiness. None of the other four TPA measurements were practical measures of masa texture. The adhesiveness force was significantly correlated with subjective evaluations of masa texture but it had a relatively high coefficient of variation (21 %) which limited its effectiveness. Measurements from the adhesiveness test {{did not appear to be}} as good as the hardness values obtained from the TPA technique. The TA. XT 2 texture analyzer was taken to a commercial tortilleria where the TPA and adhesiveness tests were used to determine-nine differences among commercial masas produced in the plant and the changes that occurred. Both methods could be used in the commercial tortilleria to obtain repeatable data. The TPA hardness and adhesiveness values increased and decreased, respectively, as masa was stored up to 24 hrs. No difference among fresh masas for different products were observed but fresh masa mixed with nixtamalized corn flours had significantly higher hardness values which was also noted by subjective observations. TPA hardness successfully detected differences in masas before and after pumping from the grinder to the sheeter. The hardness method is the most useful and reproducible measurement. None of the methods evaluated were effective indicators of masa stickiness although the adhesiveness test might have good potential provided the probe used in this test is redesigned using metal typically used in masa sheeting and pressing...|$|R
