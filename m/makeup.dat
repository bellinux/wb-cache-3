5000|$|... 1972 was {{affected}} by a players' strike over pension and salary arbitration. The strike erased the first {{week and a half}} of the season, and the Leagues decided to just excise the lost portion of the season with no <b>makeups.</b> As a result, an uneven number of games were lost by each team; some as few as six, some as many as nine. The lack of <b>makeups,</b> even when they affected the playoffs, led to the Boston Red Sox losing the American League East by half a game to the Detroit Tigers.|$|R

40|$|One of the {{problems}} encountered in Philosophy of Mind is that cognitive theories have a nontrivial dependence on the context of specific neurological <b>makeups</b> or mechanisms of individuals and species. Due to this context-dependency, for example, regularities or relationships between cognitive states are not considered genuine laws and cannot be directly related to neurological laws. The classical approaches to reduction such as bridge law reduction, functional reduction and interpretation mappings do not explicitly address this context-dependency. In this paper it is shown how these reduction approaches can be refined to incorporate the context-dependency. It is shown how the context-dependent reduction approaches obtained make explicit in which sense laws or regularities in a cognitive theory {{on the one hand}} relate to neurological laws {{and on the other hand}} to specific <b>makeups...</b>|$|R
5|$|Baker created four {{distinct}} {{stages of}} <b>makeup</b> design so that West {{would appear to}} melt gradually as time passed. However, after the film went through two separate stages of editing, these <b>makeup</b> stages were ultimately eliminated from the final cut, and the character looks generally the same throughout the film. Richard Meyers, author of The World of Fantasy Films, said actor Rebar was impatient and uncooperative with the extensive <b>makeup</b> sessions required for the effects, and thus did not wear all of the facial appliances Baker designed. This, Meyers said, {{might have been an}} additional factor in the lack of <b>makeup</b> effect stages in the final film. The version of the film shot by Sachs had not included any scenes with West before he sustained the radiation poisoning that caused his body to melt. Such scenes were, however, re-shot later by the producers without Sachs' participation.|$|E
5|$|Barney Burman {{supervised}} the <b>makeup</b> {{for the other}} aliens: his team had to rush the creation {{of many of the}} aliens, because originally the majority of them were to feature in one scene towards the end of filming. Abrams deemed the scene too similar to the cantina sequence in Star Wars and decided to dot the designs around the film. A tribble was placed in the background of Scotty's introduction. Both digital and physical <b>makeup</b> was used for aliens.|$|E

McConaughey and Leto went on to win their respective categories—only the fifth film in Oscars history to win both awards. Hairstylist Adruitha Lee, and <b>makeup</b> artist Robin Mathews won for Best <b>Makeup</b> and Hairstyling. Mathews' <b>makeup</b> budget for the film was only $250.

5|$|Jackson's Weta Digital {{created the}} visual effects, which {{included}} computer-generated imagery, {{as well as}} scale models (which were necessary to make Wellington look American), prosthetic <b>makeup</b> and practical effects with help from Weta Workshop. Visual effects supervisor Richard Taylor explained that effects work on The Frighteners was complex due to Weta's inexperience with computer technology in the mid-1990s. Prior to this film, Weta worked largely with physical effects. With so many ghosts among its main cast, The Frighteners required more digital effects shots than almost any movie made up till that time. For a special effects company {{that had been in}} existence less than three years, the eighteen-month period for completing The Frighteners was largely stressful. Some shots were handled by a small New Zealand company called Pixel Perfect, many of whose employees would eventually join Weta Digital. Rick Baker was hired to design the prosthetic <b>makeup</b> for The Judge, portrayed by John Astin (the detachable jawbone was later added digitally). However, Baker was not able to apply Astin's five hours of <b>makeup</b> himself due to his commitment on The Nutty Professor. <b>Makeup</b> artist Brian Penikas (Pirates of the Caribbean trilogy, Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull) fulfilled Baker's duties.|$|E

5|$|<b>Makeup</b> artist Baker {{provided}} the special <b>makeup</b> effects for The Incredible Melting Man, {{which included the}} gradual melting of Steve West. Rebar wore facial appliances that simulated melting flesh, and {{his hands and feet}} were fitted with liquid substances that dropped off as he walked, creating the appearance that West's body was falling apart. During one scene, a murdered fisherman's severed head falls down a waterfall and smashes on the rocks below. To create the effect, Baker used a gelatin head with a wax skull and fake blood inside, which burst out upon impact.|$|E
