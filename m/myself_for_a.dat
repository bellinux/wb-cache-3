25|$|I {{know there}} are some who {{disagree}} and I respect their point of view but I believe that life begins at conception. The only exception I have to have an abortion is in that case {{of the life of the}} mother. I just struggled with it <b>myself</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> long time but I came to realize: Life is that gift from God that I think even if life begins in that horrible situation of rape, that it is something that God intended to happen.|$|E
500|$|In 1842, {{after an}} {{endorsement}} from Secretary of State Daniel Webster, President John Tyler appointed Irving as Minister to Spain. Irving {{was surprised and}} honored, writing, [...] "It will be a severe trial to absent <b>myself</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> time from my dear little Sunnyside, but I shall return to it better enabled to carry it on comfortably".|$|E
2500|$|... "It {{takes me}} {{two years to}} [...] "document" [...] <b>myself</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> novel — two years of hard work. That is the trouble with the naturalistic novel — it {{requires}} so much documentary care. I never make, like Zola, {{a plan for a}} book. I know how it will begin and how it will end — that's all. When I finally get to writing it, it goes along rather fast — assez vite." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am entirely at your service, Countess," [...] he {{answered}} promptly. [...] "As {{a matter of}} fact, I have already promised to appear there <b>myself</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> hour." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That I can quite imagine," [...] Isobel said; [...] "the Doctor hates humbug of all sorts, and I don't think I {{should like}} to call him in <b>myself</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> {{imaginary}} ailment." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No! not {{the whole}} night," [...] replied Marguerite. [...] "At any rate, I shall not want any room but this, if I can have it to <b>myself</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> hour or two." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{considered}} with <b>myself</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> minute, and ventured {{on putting}} {{a few more}} questions to Mr. Gootheridge.|$|E
6000|$|... "I suppose there's {{nothing else}} for it," [...] the marquis grumbled. [...] "I must prepare <b>myself</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> {{prolonged}} visit to my country estates." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Fearfully dull," [...] complained his lordship, {{stifling}} a yawn. [...] "What I'm to do {{to amuse}} <b>myself</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> fortnight I'm sure I don't know." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Marquis," [...] he said, [...] "I {{should like}} to know exactly how I stand with you--the 'Double-Four,' that is to say--supposing I range <b>myself</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> hour or so {{on the side of}} the law?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I could not,' she said, {{stifling}} {{her voice}} on the cushion, and averting her head; but {{in a few moments}} she made a great effort, and said, 'You think me unforgiving, mamma. It was not entirely that. It was hating <b>myself</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> old fancy, a mere mistake. I have got over it; and I will not be in error again.' ...|$|R
60|$|Saying this, I {{sat down}} to the {{newspaper}} with which I invariably solaced <b>myself</b> <b>for</b> half <b>an</b> hour after dinner, before going out on my afternoon rounds.|$|R
6000|$|... "'I nerved <b>myself</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> struggle, {{but in that}} moment's pause a thin, white hand {{stole from}} behind the curtain and held mine for a moment.|$|E
6000|$|... "Thanks, Mentor. I've no fear, {{and shall}} merely amuse <b>myself</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> week--they stay no longer." [...] And with a {{careless}} laugh, Sir Jasper strolled away.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] he remarked, [...] "there {{have been}} times when I have cursed <b>myself</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> fool, but, on the whole, {{sentiment}} keeps many fires burning." ...|$|E
25|$|I hereby {{honestly}} and sincerely offer <b>myself</b> <b>for</b> enrollment as <b>a</b> Khudai Khitmatgar.|$|R
6000|$|The {{daylight}} came. I rose at dawn. I busied <b>myself</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> hour or {{two with}} arranging my things in my chamber, drawers, and wardrobe, in the order wherein I should wish to leave them during a brief absence. Meantime, I heard St. John quit his room. He stopped at my door: I feared he would knock--no, but {{a slip of paper}} was passed under the door. I took it up. It bore these words-- ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No marvel, {{sovereign}} lady [9]: in fair field [...] <b>Myself</b> <b>for</b> such <b>a</b> {{face had}} boldly died," [...] [10] [...] I answer'd free; and turning I appeal'd [...] To one [11] that stood beside.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have kept}} <b>myself</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> {{long time in}} {{readiness}} for death. Save yourselves, if you can. It would be hopeless for you to attempt to save my life." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Sir Magnus be blowed! How am I to {{be there}} if I've got a bilious headache? I'm not dressed. I could not have dressed <b>myself</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> five-pound note." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'You can't {{let him in}} for {{a ghastly}} thing like opening a hive. When you {{made me do it}} that time I was picking stings out of <b>myself</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> week.' ...|$|E
6000|$|I {{gathered}} {{myself up}} {{with fear and}} difficulty, threw myself on my horse, and came hither like a fool to get <b>myself</b> hanged <b>for</b> <b>a</b> rogue." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{may well}} ask that, lad. I've {{asked the same}} {{question}} of <b>myself</b> <b>for</b> many <b>a</b> day, but have never bin able to get from myself a satisfactory answer. I'm wery much afeared that we'll never see 'em again." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I didn't {{count on}} bein' {{able to pass}} <b>myself</b> off <b>for</b> <b>a</b> boy, even among blind men," [...] the old soldier said, with a laugh, and I cried, hotly: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You dear, dear girl!" [...] {{he cried}} softly. [...] "Oh, I just wish I had {{you all to}} <b>myself</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> moment!" [...] And {{he gave her a}} look that spoke volumes.|$|E
60|$|Oh, I've {{got them}} all comfortably {{settled in the}} Lancers, and I'm free to rest <b>myself</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> quarter of an hour. You don't know what agonies I've been {{suffering}} the whole evening.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{should have}} no right to marry her in such a condition--with your father's consent or without it. It is a thing which I have never {{proposed}} to <b>myself</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> moment--or to her." ...|$|E
5000|$|... "My {{office was}} in the middle of the building, {{overlooking}} the Old City. When I heard the explosion, I walked across the landing and I couldn't see anything, only dust. I was so angry when I found out what had happened that I went straight to my office and wrote an order to the troops, putting all Jewish establishments out of bounds. It was a rotten letter, written on the spur of the moment. I ought to have restrained <b>myself</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> hour or two before putting pen to paper." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Indeed, sweet one," [...] {{she said}} with a smile, [...] "it is {{delightful}} to have you all to <b>myself,</b> and <b>for</b> <b>a</b> nice whole long day. [...] . You won't be bored?" ...|$|R
60|$|Kate again laughed, {{and told}} me I might make my own {{observations}} on that point, and judge <b>for</b> <b>myself.</b> <b>As</b> <b>for</b> the visit, I had only accidentally favored a project of others. The conversation now changed, and for several miles we rode along, conversing of the scenes of the war, without adverting to the Bayards or to marriages.|$|R
60|$|When you're {{going to}} do a thing, there's nothing like making a quick start. I wrote to Harold {{straight}} away, proposing <b>myself</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> visit. And Harold wrote back telling me to come right along.|$|E
60|$|KNOX. Are {{you sure}} {{you know how to}} behave? If you'd like me to stay and see you don't do the wrong thing I'll chuck my tennis. I'm always ready to {{sacrifice}} <b>myself</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> friend.|$|E
6000|$|... "Where is Dator Yersted?" [...] he asked, and {{my heart}} sank within me, as I cursed <b>myself</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> stupid fool in not having sunk the {{submarine}} to make good the lie that I must tell.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes; an' I'm countin' on carryin' more, if you'll {{take money}} for what I buy. I don't {{want to set}} <b>myself</b> up <b>for</b> <b>a</b> beggar, 'cause I've got the stuff to pay for everything." ...|$|R
500|$|This {{title of}} [...] "Spokesman of a Generation" [...] was viewed by Dylan with disgust in later years. He came {{to feel it}} was a label that the media had pinned on him, and in his autobiography, Chronicles, Dylan wrote: [...] "The press never let up. Once in a while I would have to rise up and offer <b>myself</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> {{interview}} so they wouldn't beat the door down. Later an article would hit the streets with the headline [...] "Spokesman Denies That He's A Spokesman". I felt {{like a piece of}} meat that someone had thrown to the dogs." ...|$|R
60|$|There are already, you see, some quaint {{restrictions}} in that last sentence, whereat sundry {{of our friends}} will start, and others stop. I must stop also, <b>myself,</b> therefore, <b>for</b> <b>a</b> minute or two, to insist on them.|$|R
