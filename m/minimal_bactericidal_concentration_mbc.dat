The susceptibility of 20 clinical isolates of GBS was tested by a broth dilution method to six antibiotics which could conceivably be used in the therapy of GBS pharyngitis.

The MIC 90 and MBC 90 for penicillin were both ~ 0. 06 fJg/ml. The MIC 90 and MBC 90 for rifampin were ~ 0. 25 fJg/ml and> 32. 0 ug/ml, respec-tively. Checkerboard MIC determinations revealed synergy for 46 strains (52070), an additive or indifferent effect for 42 strains (48070), and no antagonism. MBC checker-boards showed antagonism for 62 strains (70 %); in 45 (73 %) of these 62 strains, high concentrations of rifampin increased the MBC of penicillin, whereas low concentra-tions decreased the MBC of penicillin. Time-kill studies performed on selected strains supported the results of <b>MBC</b> checkerboards, although <b>concentrations</b> of antibiotics that were antagonistic in the checkerboards had an indifferent effect in time-kill experi-ments. When concentrations of antibiotics were used that are clinically achievable in cerebrospinal fluid, delayed killing was seen even though synergy had been observe...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background One of {{the most}} {{critical}} problems about antimicrobial therapy is the increasing resistance to antibiotics. Previous studies have shown that there is a direct relation between erroneous prescription, dosage, route, duration of the therapy and the antibiotics resistance. Other important point is the uncertainty {{about the quality of the}} prescribed medicines. Some physicians believe that generic drugs are not as effective as innovator ones, so it is very important to have evidence that shows that all commercialized drugs are suitable for therapeutic use. Methods Microbial assays were used to establish the potency, the Minimal Inhibitory <b>Concentrations</b> (MICs), the <b>Minimal</b> <b>Bactericidal</b> <b>Concentration</b> (<b>MBCs),</b> the critical <b>concentrations,</b> and the production of spontaneous mutants that are resistant to vancomycin. Results The microbial assay was validated in order to determine the Vancomycin potency of the tasted samples. All the products showed that have potency values between 90 - 115 % (USP requirement). The products behave similarly because the MICs, The <b>MBCs,</b> the critical <b>concentrations,</b> the critical concentrations ratios between standard and samples, and the production of spontaneous mutants don't have significant differences. Conclusions All products analyzed by microbiological tests, show that both trademarks and generics do not have statistical variability and the answer of antimicrobial activity Show also that they are pharmaceutical equivalents. </p...|$|R
