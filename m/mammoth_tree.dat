After shearing off the tree, the operator could use his controls to cause the tree to fall either to the right or left. Unlike a harvester, it did not delimb the tree after felling it.|$|E

California notes (1876) is {{a guide for}} travellers, offering details of the state's weather, geology, and vegetation as well as recommended travel routes, historical notes, business statistics, and sightseeing tips for visitors to San Francisco, Stockton, Calaveras County and its <b>mammoth</b> <b>trees</b> and caves, the gold mining district, and the Yosemite Valley.

50|$|In {{addition}} to the ramsons and white, yellow and blue anemones, there are arum and toothworts. On occasion, some orchids can be seen, including the marsh orchid and twayblade. Trees include hornbeam, silver birch, ash, elm and hazel {{as well as several}} varieties of rowan. In 1916, Aksel Jensen, a farmer, cultivated the northeastern side of Døndalen. His interest in trees led him to plant approximately 150 varieties from around the world. They include Chinese cork oak, Californian <b>mammoth</b> <b>trees,</b> Himalayan spruce and also a rare European variety, the chequer tree.|$|R

40|$|The small dendrological {{garden in}} Glinna (about 6 ha) near Szczecin (northwest Poland) {{is one of}} the 16 {{scientific}} places in Poland, which is well-known for growing a lot of unique trees. The local mild microclimate in combination with the Atlantic climate of West Pomerania produce favourable conditions for growing many varieties of trees and shrubs which undergo freezing in central and eastern Poland. The garden's collection amounts up to 632 taxons of trees and shrubs, representatives of 199 genera. What is valuable {{in the collection of the}} arboretum is that the cultural varieties among the gymnospermous plants make only 25 %, whereas among the angiospermous plants - 10 %. The <b>mammoth</b> <b>tree</b> remains the garden's symbol and its speciality consists in species of Chinese origin (180 taxons) and maples (68 taxons) ...|$|E
40|$|Photograph of {{a drawing}} by Edward Vischer {{depicting}} General Andres Pico and two old Indians at the Mission San Fernando looking west, 1865. Pico stands among the aged Indians, Alfonso (130 years old) and Agupito (115 years old) who sit around a campfire {{in the center}} foreground, as he holds the hand of his adopted daughter, Anita Gale. Another small group of Indians sit nearby. In the background, three men are visible on horseback with the mission buildings behind them. The larger building at right has a long exterior corridor whose thatched roof {{is supported by a}} long series of arches. Caption reads: "Chapel and principal buildings of the ex-mission San Fernando", "Gen. D. Andres Pico, with his adoptive daughter, visiting the quarters of the aged San Fernando Indians", "The oldest surviving mission Indians of California, Alifonso, 130 (by computation), Agapito, 115, the first adult gentile baptized here (then a grandfather), their wives also are 100 years [ [...] . ]".; "Vischer, artist and photographer, emigrated to Mexico from his homeland of Germany at the age of nineteen, and was associated with the commercial house of Heinrich Virmond, for whom he was often the supercargo during trading voyages and under whose employ he traveled to California in 1842, where he eventually settled in San Francisco. At the age of fifty, Vischer became intensely interested in sketching and painting. He combined with these interests a skill in photography. It was his practice to make rapid sketches on the spot of scenes which interested him, the big trees, the ruins of Missions, or mining operations, and later to work up these sketches in water colour, pencil, pen or crayon. Subsequently he reproduced his drawing, first by lithography and later by photography. Using these techniques, Vischer published portfolios of drawings: The <b>Mammoth</b> <b>Tree</b> Grove (1862), The Washoe Mining Region (1962), Pictorial of California Landscape (1870), and Missions of Upper California (1872).

Her little ranch was all that she had saved from her husband's estate, and she ever scorned its importance when she told indignantly how her husband's father had once held a splendid principality comprising four thousand acres.|$|R

A grape-vine {{ran along the}} top, trying to hide the sharp spikes; lilacs tossed their purple plumes above it, and several tall {{chestnuts}} rose over all, making green tents with their broad leaves, where spires of blossom began to show like candles on a <b>mammoth</b> Christmas <b>tree.</b> Sparrows were chirping gayly everywhere; the white cat, with a fresh blue bow, basked on the coping of the wall, and {{from the depths of}} the enchanted garden came a sweet voice singing,-- ...|$|R

A diorama of four mammoths in an otherwise uninhabited landscape fills {{the majority of the}} image. Two large mammoths stand in profile, facing each other, on either side of a small pond or tar pit. Another mammoth stands behind the pond, facing the viewer, while the fourth and youngest mammoth pulls itself from the pond {{with the help of the}} rightmost <b>mammoth's</b> trunk. <b>Trees</b> and vegetation sit in the foreground of the diorama, while the background landscape appears to be low grass with hills visible in the distance.

25|$|Despite {{the fact}} {{that much of the}} area has been reduced to a {{patchwork}} of clearings for cattle ranches and peasant communities, the Lacandon contains some of the most extensive and best preserved remnants of lower montane rainforest in Mexico and Central America. The best conserved area is within the Montes Azules Biosphere Reserve, which has about 290,000 hectares of the Reserve in good condition. The Lacandon is the best known of Mexico’s rainforest areas because of the attention it has received in the press and efforts by international organizations to protect what is left of it. The Lacandon {{is one of the most}} biodiverse rainforests in the world, with as much as 25% of Mexico’s total species diversity. The predominant native vegetation is perennial high rainforest with trees that can grow to an average height of thirty meters and often to fifty or sixty including Guatteria anomala, Ceiba pentandra, Swietenia macrophylla, Terminalia amazonia and Ulmus mexicana. <b>Mammoth</b> Guanacaste <b>trees</b> shrouded in vines and bromeliads among clear running streams, enormous firms, palms and wild elephant’s ear plants can still be seen. It has 1,500 tree species, 33% of all Mexican bird species, 25% of all Mexican animal species, 44% of all Mexican diurnal butterflies and 10% of all Mexico's fish species. The jungle contains many endangered species such as the red macaw, the eagle, the tapir, the spider monkey, the howler monkeys, and the swamp crocodile. It is one of the last jungles in North America big enough to support jaguars. Central American jaguars are reported, though rare, in Selva Zoque.|$|R
