5|$|A French {{garrison}} of a {{few hundred}} men took over the fort on 12 June. During the subsequent <b>Maltese</b> uprising and insurrection against the French, <b>Maltese</b> insurgents built Għargħar and Sqaq Cappara batteries to bombard Fort Manoel. The <b>Maltese</b> attacked the fort on a number of occasions, and the French retaliated with their own bombardment at least once. On 12 September 1799, a company of French troops from Fort Manoel attempted to silence an insurgent gun position in San Ġwann, but were repelled by the <b>Maltese</b> insurgents.|$|E
5|$|On Malta, the French had rapidly {{dismantled}} {{the institutions}} of the Knights of St. John, including the Roman Catholic Church. Church property was looted and seized to pay for the expedition to Egypt, an act that generated considerable anger among the deeply religious <b>Maltese</b> population. On 2 September, this anger erupted in a popular uprising during an auction of church property, and within days thousands of <b>Maltese</b> irregulars had driven the French garrison into Valletta. Valletta was surrounded by approximately 10,000 irregular <b>Maltese</b> soldiers led by Emmanuele Vitale and Canon Francesco Saverio Caruana. The <b>Maltese</b> were armed with 23 cannon and a small squadron of coastal gunboats. Although there was intermittent skirmishing between the garrison and the <b>Maltese,</b> the fortress was too strong for the irregulars to assault.|$|E
5|$|Since 2005, stamps {{issued by}} the Sovereign Military Order of Malta have been {{denominated}} in euros, although the Order's official currency remains the <b>Maltese</b> scudo. The <b>Maltese</b> scudo itself is pegged to the euro and is only recognised as legal tender within the Order.|$|E
5|$|Ambulance {{services}} that have historical origins {{such as the}} Order of St John, the Order of Malta Ambulance Corps and Malteser International often use the <b>Maltese</b> cross to identify their ambulances. This is especially important {{in countries such as}} Australia, where St. John Ambulance operate one state and one territory ambulance service, and all of Australia's other ambulance services use variations on a red <b>Maltese</b> cross.|$|E
5|$|Fondazzjoni Wirt Artna also {{restored}} {{a number}} of <b>Maltese</b> fortifications, including the Saluting Battery and Rinella Battery. It is currently restoring Mistra Battery.|$|E
5|$|French forces invaded Malta in June 1798, and the Order capitulated after {{a couple}} of days. The French {{occupied}} the island until September, when the <b>Maltese</b> rebelled and blockaded the French forces in the harbour area with foreign help. The Floriana Lines remained under French control throughout the blockade, and the <b>Maltese</b> built Tas-Samra Battery and a battery on Corradino in order to bombard them.|$|E
5|$|Further westwards, {{the newly}} {{captured}} French island of Malta {{was under a}} much more diligent blockade. The returning convoy from Aboukir Bay under Saumarez reached Malta in September. There he encountered a squadron of four Portuguese ships {{of the line and}} the British ship Lion under the command of Tomás Xavier Teles de Castro da Gama, Marquess de Niza, initially sending them on to Alexandria. While anchored off Malta awaiting favourable winds, a delegation of native <b>Maltese</b> citizens was brought on board Saumarez's ship Orion on 25 September. They announced that the <b>Maltese</b> people, infuriated with French disestablishment of the Roman Catholic Church on Malta, had risen up against the French garrison and were forcing them back towards the fortress of Valletta. Saumarez attempted to negotiate the surrender of the island with Vaubois, but was rebuffed. Unable to delay his passage to Gibraltar any longer, Saumarez gave the <b>Maltese</b> 1,200 muskets and promised to send assistance {{as soon as he was}} able. By 12 October, the French were besieged in Valletta by 10,000 <b>Maltese</b> irregulars. Vaubois had only 3,000 healthy troops, although the arrival of Villeneuve with the ship of the line Guillaume Tell and two frigates did bolster his defences.|$|E
5|$|In 2014 <b>Maltese</b> child singer, Veronica Rotin, {{covered this}} song on her debut album, Veronica Rotin.|$|E
5|$|In {{crafting}} the story, Hergé {{was possibly}} influenced by The <b>Maltese</b> Falcon, {{as there are}} similarities in their plots.|$|E
5|$|Sydney Greenstreet as Signor Ferrari. Another Englishman, Greenstreet had {{previously}} starred with Lorre and Bogart in his film debut in The <b>Maltese</b> Falcon.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} {{students}} travel to school using the nation's bus network, which is free for state school students to use. Schools in Malta generally begin their school day at 8:30am and finish at 2:40pm. Students receive three days of holidays in November 15 days of holidays over Christmas, two days of holidays in March and eight days of holidays in April, in addition to public holidays. <b>Maltese</b> school students receive {{the highest number of}} days off of all school students in Europe, with 90 days during the 2010-11 academic year being non-school days. This is 14 days more than the European average of 76. Virtually all <b>Maltese</b> state schools run tuck shops, while some secondary schools are home to cafeterias.|$|E
5|$|Although Warren {{departed}} {{the region}} soon afterwards {{with most of}} his squadron, Watrin was still unable to make an impression {{on the walls of}} Porto Ferrajo, and Airey held the town against the French for the last few weeks of the war until news arrived of the ceasefire that accompanied the provisional signing of the Treaty of Amiens on 1 October. On 11 October, volunteers from the <b>Maltese</b> Light Infantry arrived to relieve the garrison at Porto Ferrajo. In March 1802 under Article XI of the final terms of the Treaty, the British turned over the entire island to the French and Elba remained in French hands throughout the Napoleonic Wars. The <b>Maltese</b> detachment returned to Malta in April 1802.|$|E
5|$|During Act I, {{the player}} assumes {{command of the}} Knights of St. John, which resembles the Spanish civilization (even though the faction played is {{actually}} <b>Maltese).</b> The Spanish had numerous colonies in the area played throughout the Act.|$|E
5|$|Fire service {{operated}} ambulances may {{display the}} Cross of St. Florian (often incorrectly called a <b>Maltese</b> cross) as this cross is frequently {{used as a}} fire department logo (St. Florian being {{the patron saint of}} firefighters).|$|E
5|$|It {{is common}} for prestigious {{buildings}} in Valletta, such as the Castellania, {{to be used as}} Government Ministries. The Castellania is an iconic building in the <b>Maltese</b> architectural identity.|$|E
5|$|Malta's tourism {{industry}} faces {{a number of}} issues impacting on it now and threatening to impact on it in the future. One of the clearest issues facing Malta's {{tourism industry}} is overcrowding {{as a result of the}} island nation's relatively small size, in terms of both area and population. Malta is a nation of just under 450,000 people, yet its infrastructure is required to support over 1.1 million tourists every year. Malta's water works, roads, waste management systems and beaches are stretched to capacity in the summer months of July and August of every year, when tourism numbers are at their peak. This is a challenge facing <b>Maltese</b> tourism operators as it means that they cannot simply pursue the kinds of 'mass tourism' marketing measures taken by operators in other Mediterranean destinations with more space and resources to pursue them. In addition, <b>Maltese</b> tourism operators must balance increased tourism numbers with the needs of the 'native population', as when resources are stretched thin by tourists during the summer season, there are negative impacts on <b>Maltese</b> residents also.|$|E
5|$|On 1 February 1846 {{education}} became effectively compulsory {{till the}} age of 14. In 1847, elementary schooling was changed to the British model, schools were opened in every village and education was made free of charge. In 1878, the mode of language education delivery changed following the publication of two reports on the matter. Italian language education was replaced by instruction in the English language, {{and the use of}} <b>Maltese</b> was encouraged in the primary years. However, English was the language in which education was delivered at all stages of education following primary school. Debate continued until the 1930s over which language should be used in <b>Maltese</b> education - Italian or English.|$|E
5|$|One year later, the {{commanding}} knight Giuseppe de Langon, surrounded Oran {{and with his}} sole vessel, which harbored a force of 50 cannons, traversed the entire enemy fleet despite the vain efforts of the Algerians to catch him. He was subsequently nominated Lieutenant General of the <b>Maltese</b> fleet.|$|E
5|$|P.fluviatile {{has been}} {{harvested}} for food since classical antiquity, {{and is now}} threatened by overexploitation. Many of the island populations are particularly vulnerable, and the <b>Maltese</b> subspecies has become a conservation icon. A population in Rome may have been brought there before {{the founding of the}} Roman Empire.|$|E
5|$|The Wignacourt Aqueduct was {{constructed}} between 1610 and 1615 to carry water from springs in Dingli and Rabat to the <b>Maltese</b> capital Valletta. It {{was named after}} Alof de Wignacourt, the Grand Master of the Order of St. John, who partially financed its construction.|$|E
5|$|The {{aqueduct}} was {{improved by}} Grand Master Emmanuel de Rohan-Polduc in 1780. On 4 September 1798, {{in the early}} stages of the <b>Maltese</b> uprising against the French, insurgents ambushed French soldiers near the aqueduct at Mrieħel, in the limits of Birkirkara.|$|E
5|$|The climactic scene {{before the}} Great Sept of Baelor {{was shot at}} Fort Manoel, in the <b>Maltese</b> town of Gżira. The filming {{took place in the}} last week of October 2010.|$|E
5|$|The fortifications were {{included}} on the Antiquities List of 1925, and they are now also listed on the National Inventory of the Cultural Property of the <b>Maltese</b> Islands.|$|E
5|$|The {{institution}} of the Castellania {{was replaced by the}} Tribunale Provisorio and the Tribunale Civile di Prim'Instanza. The post of Castellano was abolished, and judges were nominated by the Commission de Gouvernement. During the years of French occupation, the building was known as the Palais de Justice. Not less than three full cases of silver secured at the Castellania, were taken by the French on November 8, 1798, and were melted to create coins to remunerate the Jacobins. It was {{one of a series of}} similar reasons that consequently triggered a <b>Maltese</b> revolt. The French law system did not last enough to influence the <b>Maltese</b> courts at the time.|$|E
5|$|Various {{sections}} of the aqueduct are scheduled by the Malta Environment and Planning Authority (MEPA) as grade 1 national monuments and are listed on the National Inventory of the Cultural Property of the <b>Maltese</b> Islands.|$|E
5|$|A {{couple of}} months after the {{beginning}} of the French occupation, the <b>Maltese</b> people rebelled against the French and blockaded them in the Harbour area with British, Neapolitan and Portuguese support. The French managed to hold out in Valletta until September 1800, when General Vaubois capitulated to the British, who took control of the islands.|$|E
5|$|After a {{successful}} <b>Maltese</b> uprising against French rule, in 1800 Malta became a British protectorate, with the Castellania becoming {{known as the}} Gran Corte della Valletta. It was amongst the first public institutions to be reestablished. In February 1806, Alexander Ball gave instrcutions to presumably guarantee independence of the Judiciary, whereas the Judges could not be removed at a simple request, and legal persons would not be threatened to be jailed if they disagree with signing legal documents.|$|E
5|$|After {{the fort}} was {{handed over to}} the <b>Maltese</b> government, it was {{initially}} abandoned but it later became a container depot for raw material arriving in Malta. In 1976, part of the ditch near the Left Ravelin was filled in, and St. Dominic Demi-Bastion was breached {{to make way for a}} new road.|$|E
5|$|At sea, a {{cargo ship}} {{en route from}} Guam to Yap was {{abandoned}} after it was damaged by high winds. The passengers entered a life raft, and were later found by a Navy search and rescue airplane. They were soon rescued by a <b>Maltese</b> tanker. No one was injured when the accident occurred.|$|E
5|$|Education in Malta is {{compulsory}} through age {{sixteen and}} is offered through three different providers: the state, the church, {{and the private}} sector. The state is responsible for promoting education and instruction and ensuring universal access to education for all <b>Maltese</b> citizens {{the existence of a}} system of schools and institutions accessible to all <b>Maltese</b> citizens. The objectives of education in Malta include intellectual and moral development and the preparation of every citizen to contribute productively to the national economy. Although <b>Maltese</b> citizens had access to education during the Arab occupation of 870 to 1090, the arrival of a number of religious orders in the following four centuries brought religious-based education to the island for wealthy families. The arrival of the Knights Hospitaller saw the establishment of the University of Malta, around which a number of primary, secondary and post-secondary institutions were established. Education in Malta has been universally available at the primary level since the ejection of the Knights Hospitaller by the French in 1798, when state-funded elementary schooling was established. In 1878, English replaced Italian as the primary language of instruction, and education was made compulsory in 1946 in response to a number of children not attending school due to poverty between World Wars One and Two. The age at which education became compulsory was lowered to five years in 1988.|$|E
5|$|Formal end-of-year {{examinations}} commence {{starting in}} Year 4 to dictate class streaming {{arrangements for the}} following year. Students are examined in English, <b>Maltese,</b> mathematics, religion and social studies. Despite the fact that eleven-plus examinations highlight inequality and failures, and are recognized as ineffective educational tools by experts, Malta still implements such exams. In Year 6, when most pupils have turned eleven years of age, an eleven-plus exam is given to students to determine which students attend which secondary schools. Students are tested in English language, <b>Maltese</b> language, mathematics, social studies and religion; the latter is optional for those not adhering to the faith taught in schools. While 73 per cent of eleven-year-old students sat the eleven-plus exam in 2001, only about 54 percent pass it each year. Students achieving success in the eleven-plus exam go on to attend prestigious 'junior lyceums' during their secondary years, whilst {{those who do not}} attend 'area secondary schools'. This is similar to the operation of the Tripartite System in the United Kingdom following World War II.|$|E
5|$|From 1840 to 1844, the Penny Black, {{and other}} stamps issued, were obliterated with the <b>Maltese</b> Cross cancellation. There was no text or numeral to help {{identify}} any of these cancels as Irish, but some <b>Maltese</b> Crosses are uniquely identifiable with certain Irish towns, including Belfast, Eyrecourt, Cork, Hollymount, Limerick and Mullingar. From 1844 on, the cancels used included text or numerals that identified the post town. Cancels of both types are easier to identify if the stamp is still affixed to a cover, since this makes the complete postmark visible, but a stamp no longer affixed to a cover may still permit identification {{of the town of}} use if enough of the postmark can be seen on the stamp itself. Numerals of Irish town cancels were uniquely set in a 4 pointed diamond shape whereas town cancels in England and Wales used an oval shape and Scotland used a rectangular form.|$|E
5|$|From 1921 to 1927, Murray led archaeological {{excavations}} on Malta, {{assisted by}} Edith Guest and Gertrude Caton Thompson. She excavated the Bronze Age megalithic monuments of Santa Sofia, Santa Maria tal-Bakkari, Għar Dalam, and Borġ in-Nadur, {{all of which}} were threatened by {{the construction of a new}} aerodrome. In this she was funded by the Percy Sladen Memorial Fund. Her resulting three-volume excavation report came to be seen as an important publication within the field of <b>Maltese</b> archaeology. During the excavations, she had taken an interest in the island's folklore, resulting in the 1932 publication of her book <b>Maltese</b> Folktales, much of which was a translation of earlier stories collected by Father Magri and her friend Liza Galea. In 1932 Murray returned to Malta to aid in the cataloguing of the Bronze Age pottery collection held in Malta Museum, resulting in another publication, Corpus of the Bronze Age Pottery of Malta.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 15th century, the local militia {{had a number}} of watch posts around the <b>Maltese</b> islands, and in some cases there might have been {{fortified}} coastal watchtowers at these posts. One of these towers is known to have been built at St Elmo Point on the Sciberras Peninsula by the Aragonese in 1488.|$|E
5|$|Major event tourism, {{especially}} events {{centred on}} Catholicism, {{is an important}} segment of the <b>Maltese</b> tourism sector. During Holy Week, processions and religious services dominate the country and food stalls are {{set up in the}} village squares of Malta. Another popular major event is Carnival, a five centuries-old traditional celebration lasting for the five days preceding Ash Wednesday. Celebrations for Carnival involve float-based pageants, street parties and street food stalls. They are mostly Roman Catholic.|$|E
5|$|On 12 October, the British {{ships of}} the line HMS Alexander under Captain Alexander Ball, HMS Culloden under Captain Thomas Troubridge and HMS Colossus under Captain George Murray joined Niza's ships off Malta, marking the formal start of the blockade. On the same day, Vaubois withdrew {{the last of his}} {{soldiers}} into the fortified new city of Valletta, accompanied by approximately 100 <b>Maltese</b> nationals who had joined the French forces. The garrison numbered over 3,000 men and initially at least was well supplied. In the harbour lay the ships {{of the line}} Dégo and Athénien and the frigate Carthaginoise, all of which were former ships of the <b>Maltese</b> Navy, as well as the newly arrived Guillaume Tell and frigates Justice and Diane, survivors of the Battle of the Nile under Rear-Admiral Pierre-Charles Villeneuve, which had reached Malta at the end of September.|$|E
