40|$|Abstract: This work {{presents}} a photocatalysis-based method to treat <b>and</b> <b>purify</b> <b>air</b> {{because of its}} broad applicability to common, oxidizable, air contaminants. The effect of oxygen content, temperature, water vapor, and 2 -propanol concentration on the TiO 2 surface was investigated. The rate of 2 -propanol decomposition increased with increasing the oxygen content, but was reduced at temperatures higher than 100 ◦C. When water vapor concentration was {{in the range of}} 10 – 355 mmolm− 3, the rate of 2 -propanol decomposition was proportional to the water content. However, an opposite result was observed at a higher concentration of water vapor. 2 -Propanol was photooxidized to acetone, and eventually to carbon dioxide and water. The kinetic model of 2 -propanol photooxidation was successfully developed by the competitive Langmuir–Hinshelwood rate form, incorporating the inhibition effect coming from the formation of acetone...|$|R

40|$|AbstractWith the {{increasing}} use of amine solvents for carbon capture, there is a critical need to characterize the potential health effects of these materials and their degradation products formed within the capture system or downwind of release. This study evaluated the acute inhalation health risk of exposure to degraded mixtures of monoethanolamine (MEA), methyldiethanolamine (MDEA), and piperazine (PIP). Degradation was achieved in a heated (150 C) and pressurized (approximately 15 psi) stainless steel vessel by adding NO 2 <b>and</b> <b>purified</b> <b>air</b> over approximately 75 days. Laboratory mice were exposed to the degraded mixture (as well as the neat amines in separate experiments) 6 hrs/day for 7 consecutive days in a whole-body inhalation chamber. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) was carried out 18 to 24 hours post-exposure and inflammatory cells were counted in lavage fluid. Cytokine expression and oxidative stress were measured in lung tissue. We found that exposure to degraded MEA resulted in significant increases in total cells, neutrophils, and lymphocytes, and the strongest cytokine response compared to control mice and compared to MEA-exposed mice. Neither MDEA nor PIP, or their degradant mixtures, caused increased inflammatory cells in BAL fluid. The degraded MEA atmosphere also caused a statistically significant decrease in oxidative stress in mouse lung. The degraded MDEA atmosphere caused the strongest cytokine response of the amines tested, producing statistically significant increases in cytokine growth-related oncogene (GRO-KC), monocyte chemotactic protein - 1 (MCP- 1), and granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GMCSF) expression compared to the control and to MDEA alone. The degraded PIP atmosphere showed a statistically significant increase in GMCSF expression. This investigation represents a hazard evaluation and not a dose-response assessment; however, the results suggest that our approach can be used successfully to screen potential solvents for carbon capture for acute human health impacts...|$|R

The objective of Phase I {{of the project was}} to assess the feasibility of upgrading low-Btu methane streams using ultra-fast thermal swing adsorption (TSA) using Velocys' modular microchannel process technology. The project is on schedule and under budget. For Task 1. 1, the open literature, patent information, and vendor contacts were surveyed to identify adsorbent candidates for experimental validation and subsequent demonstration in an MPT-based ultra-fast TSA separation for methane upgrading. The leading candidates for preferential adsorption of methane over nitrogen are highly microporous carbons. A Molecular Gate{trademark} zeolite from Engelhard Corporation has emerged as a candidate. For Task 1. 2, experimental evaluation of adsorbents was initiated, and data were collected on carbon (MGN- 101) from PICA, Inc. This carbon demonstrated a preferential capacity for methane over nitrogen, as well as a reasonable thermal swing differential capacity for a 90 % <b>methane</b> <b>and</b> 10 % nitrogen mixture.

50|$|An {{important}} aspect of the bunkers of the Siegfried Line was their ability to operate under gas attack. The bunkers could be hermetically sealed <b>and</b> supplied with <b>purified</b> <b>air</b> from outside. Because of their importance, the B-Werke had the most elaborate filter systems designed and built into the facilities. A constant overpressure prevented the penetration of gases in the event of minor leaks and allowed the removal of stale air and exhaust gases from the battle positions. One or more spaces were combined to form gas-tight cells. Pressure relief valves in the rooms or cells regulated the pressure. The air sucked in from outside was passed through a pre-filter, which cleared the air of dust and water vapour. Then it flowed through four, parallel, room filters, which filtered dangerous gasses out using active carbon inserts. If required, the air for heating the bunker could be warmed using a heat exchanger before being blown into the bunker. The capacity of the central fan was 40 m³ / minute. To ensure the ventilation of the plant even in the event of the central fan failing, individual rooms or cells had hand-operated HES ventilators (army unit protection ventilators) with 1.2 m³ or 2.4 m³ capacity per minute. The central fan and its filters was located above the engine room but is no longer in place.|$|R

The secondary organic aerosols (SOA) mass concentrations and yields from toluene in the ambient air matrix, after subtracted ambient air background primary and secondary organic aerosols, were 9. 0 - 34. 0 and 5. 6 - 12. 9 times, respectively, greater than those in <b>purified</b> <b>air</b> matrix.

The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) estimates that about 90% of the carbon stored in land vegetation is locked up in trees and that they sequester about 50% more carbon than is present in the atmosphere. Changes in land use currently contribute about 20% of total global carbon emissions (heavily logged Indonesia and Brazil are a major source of emissions). Climate change can be mitigated by sequestering carbon in reafforestation schemes, plantations and timber products. Also wood biomass can be utilized as a renewable carbon-neutral fuel. The FAO has suggested that, over the period 2005–2050, effective use of tree planting could absorb about 10–20% of man-made emissions – so monitoring the condition of the world's forests must be part of a global strategy to mitigate emissions and protect ecosystem services. However, climate change may pre-empt this FAO scenario as a study by the International Union of Forest Research Organizations in 2009 concluded that the stress of a 2.5C (4.5F) temperature rise above pre-industrial levels could result in the release of vast amounts of carbon so the potential of forests to act as carbon [...] "sinks" [...] is [...] "at risk of being lost entirely".|$|R
