50|$|The <b>upward</b> <b>trajectory</b> of Vanderbilt {{football}} took a {{step back}} in 2009. Despite returning 18 starters from the 2008 bowl-championship season, the Commodores finished a disappointing 2-10. Numerous injuries contributed to the team's troubles, as several starters were lost with season-ending injuries, including Ryan Hamilton (Safety), Jared Hawkins (RB), James Williams (OL), and Larry Smith (QB). In addition, transfer WR and projected starter Terrence Jeffers was not academically eligible to play the entire season.|$|R
5000|$|Tasman's <b>upward</b> <b>trajectory</b> {{continued}} through 2014 {{as they reached}} the Premiership final at the first time of asking before being defeated 36-32 by [...] in the final.

50|$|In 1952/53 Hearts were {{struggling}} but with Bauld's return to full fitness came {{a change in}} fortunes. From {{the bottom half of}} the league they surged up the table to finish in fourth place (as they had the two previous seasons).

40|$|This paper {{develops}} {{a model of}} the housing market that takes account of population density {{to assess the impact of}} population changes on the value and size of the housing stock. The model implies that if population density is on an <b>upward</b> <b>trajectory,</b> rises in population and in incomes increasingly generate price response and diminishing rises in the stock of housing. This has implications for the optimal structure of housing finance. It makes equiy financing of home purchase more desirable. The properties of hybrid debt-equity contracts for financing house purchase are explored...|$|R
50|$|The Times-Picayune {{reported}} in January 2009 that {{the metropolitan area}} had a recent influx of 5,300 households in the later half of 2008, bringing the population to around 469,605 households, or 88.1% of its pre-Katrina levels. While the area's population has been on an <b>upward</b> <b>trajectory</b> since the storm, much of that growth was attributed to residents returning after Katrina. Many observers predicted that growth would taper off, but the data center's analysis suggests that New Orleans and the surrounding parishes are benefiting from an economic migration resulting from the global financial crisis of 2008-2009.|$|R
50|$|While Democrats managed {{only one}} solid two-year {{election}} cycle in the 40s and 50s, a young 2-term House member and Kennedy administration veteran {{with a strong}} understanding of agricultural policy changed their fortunes when he squeaked out a win against incumbent Joe Foss in 1962's Senate election. Vietnam War opponent George McGovern's popularity and profile was on an <b>upward</b> <b>trajectory</b> that would only be shadowed by his presidential run in 1972.

50|$|Traditionally, finger spinners bowled with an {{emphasis}} on side spin. With the advent of covered and better batting pitches the focus changed to bowling with a component of top spin. The top spin provides loop which makes it harder for the batsman to make an early judgement of the length of the delivery. The ball tends to be released with a slightly <b>upward</b> <b>trajectory</b> which raises the ball above the batsman's eye line. The topspin on the ball then causes the ball to dip earlier and bounce higher.|$|R
5000|$|This cycle is, unsurprisingly, depressing. It {{reflects}} Cole's pessimism and {{is often}} seen as a commentary on Andrew Jackson and the Democratic Party. (Note, for instance, the military hero {{at the center of}} [...] "Consummation.") However, some Democrats had a different theory of the course of empire. They saw not a spiral or cycle but a continuing <b>upward</b> <b>trajectory.</b> Levi Woodbury, a Democrat and a justice on the United States Supreme Court, for instance, responded to Cole by saying {{that there would be no}} destruction in the United States.|$|R
30|$|However, {{according}} to our research, {{the effect of the}} retirement delay over closing the pension gap depends on the situation and accumulation of human capital of the insured. Low-skilled workers will find their human capital declining at older ages (Skirbekk 2008), so their contributions in their pension plans will decrease along with the wage rate. Extending their working life will not do anything good to address the pension crisis. For high-skilled workers, the human capitals are on an <b>upward</b> <b>trajectory,</b> so their contributions in their pension plans can increase with the wage rate. Extending their working life will help alleviate the pension crisis.|$|R

This briefing paper summarises research tracing the lives of graduates across the five year period after leaving university, revealing that their migration pathways are often complex, non-linear and precarious. During this prolonged period of instability the parental home (and parental support more generally) provides a crucial safety net, potentially placing additional burden on mid-life parents who may also have care responsibilities to the older parent generation.

To explore the complexity of human cortical miRNA expression in detail, we analyzed RNA from postmortem prefrontal cortex from 97 sub-jects aged 2  months to 78  years using miRNA microar-ray. Global miRNA expression was highest in the early years before declining significantly after adolescence (n =  140 decreased, n  =  32 increased).
