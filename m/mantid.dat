500|$|The black house spider (Badumna insignis), {{the cellar}} spider (Pholcus phalangioides) {{and the giant}} daddy-long-legs spider (Artema atlanta) are known to prey on the redback spider, and redbacks are often absent if these species are present in {{significant}} numbers. [...] Agenioideus nigricornis, a spider wasp, is a parasitoid of the adult redback. Other wasps of the families Eurytomidae and Ichneumonidae parasitise redback eggs, and <b>mantid</b> lacewings (Neuroptera and Mantispidae) prey on redback eggs.|$|E

500|$|The name mantodea {{is formed}} from the Ancient Greek words [...] (mantis) meaning [...] "prophet", and [...] (eidos) meaning [...] "form" [...] or [...] "type". It was coined in 1838 by the German {{entomologist}} Hermann Burmeister. The order is occasionally called the mantes, using a Latinized plural of Greek mantis. The name <b>mantid</b> properly refers only {{to members of}} the family Mantidae, which was, historically, the only family in the order. The other common name, praying mantis, applied to any species in the order, but in Europe mainly to Mantis religiosa, comes from the typical [...] "prayer-like" [...] posture with folded fore limbs. The vernacular plural [...] "mantises" [...] (used in this article) was confined largely to the USA, with [...] "mantids" [...] predominantly used as the plural in the UK and elsewhere in 1996.|$|E

50|$|<b>Mantids</b> stalk {{their prey}} and pounce on it, {{grasping}} {{it with their}} raptorial forelegs. Only living prey is selected and it is consumed directly after the catch. The predator orients itself optically, and therefore only takes notice of moving prey. The maximum size of prey which <b>mantids</b> can overwhelm is species-specific and depends on the prey type. On average <b>mantids</b> eat crickets of 50% their own body weight, while cockroaches can weigh up to 110%.|$|R
40|$|Praying <b>mantids</b> use {{binocular}} cues {{to judge}} whether their prey is in striking distance. When there are several moving targets within their binocular visual field, <b>mantids</b> need to solve the correspondence problem. They must select between the possible pairings of retinal images in the two eyes {{so that they can}} strike at a single real target. In this study, <b>mantids</b> were presented with two targets in various configurations, and the resulting fixating saccades that precede the strike were analyzed. The distributions of saccades show that <b>mantids</b> consistently prefer one out of several possible matches. Selection is in part guided by the position and the spatiotemporal features of the target image in each eye. Selection also depends upon the binocular disparity of the images, suggesting that insects can perform local binocular computations. The pairing rules ensure that <b>mantids</b> tend to aim at real targets and not at “ghost” targets arising from false matches...|$|R

2500|$|Multiple {{methods of}} sexual {{approaches}} have evolved in cannibalistic species {{as a result}} of sexual cannibalism.

The male attempts to avoid detection by approaching the female when the wind impairs her ability to hear him. [...] In the praying <b>mantid</b> species, Pseudomantis albofimbrata, the males approach the female either from a [...] "slow mounting from the rear" [...] or a [...] "slow approach from the front" [...] position to remain undetected. The male alters his approach through the utilization of the surrounding windy conditions, and thus the risk of facing cannibalization is reduced.|$|E

40|$|In {{unpalatable}} prey, long-wavelength colors such as red {{or yellow}} are often {{thought to be}} aposematic (warning) signals, due to their high conspicuousness. However, conspicuousness depends on the visual physiology of the receivers. Tectocoris diophthalmus is a shieldback stinkbug with highly variable coloration; individuals may be all orange or have blue-green iridescent patches of variable size. Prior research has demonstrated the defenses of T. diophthalmus can induce avoidance learning in birds but not praying <b>mantids,</b> and that geographic patterns in variation may relate to the local density of arthropod predators. In this study, we use visual modeling and behavioral assays to test how praying <b>mantids</b> Hierodula majuscula may impose directional selection pressure on the coloration of T. diophthalmus. <b>Mantids</b> have monochromatic vision with peak sensitivity in the “green” region of the spectrum. Using a receptor excitation model, we show that orange bugs are much less conspicuous than iridescent conspecifics and may be inconspicuous against their typical green leaf background. In behavioral assays, <b>mantids</b> detected iridescent bugs from a greater distance on average. In binary choice experiments, <b>mantids</b> showed no color preference at short range, but approached iridescent bugs significantly more often when the choice {{had to be made}} at a greater distance, and could not distinguish between orange bugs and unoccupied leaves at distance. Together, this evidence suggests that H. majuscula should impose strong directional selection against iridescent bugs in nature, and that orange coloration may be performing dual roles of crypsis to <b>mantids</b> but aposematic signaling to birds. 7 page(s...|$|R
