While complimentary of the talents {{of several of the}} rock artists at the festival, he said he was [...] "horrified" [...] to see Jimi Hendrix set fire to his guitar on stage: [...] "That was too <b>much</b> <b>for</b> <b>me.</b> In our culture, we have such respect for musical instruments, they are like part of God." [...] Shankar's [...] peaked at number 43 on Billboards pop LPs chart in the US, which remains the highest placing he achieved on that chart.|$|E
500|$|Yancey {{describes}} {{his friendship with}} Mel White, who was a married pastor and Fuller Theological Seminary lecturer with two children {{when he came out}} as homosexual. White had been a ghostwriter for Christian writers including Francis Schaeffer, Billy Graham and Jerry Falwell, and Yancey was surprised by White's self-disclosure. According to the author, he and White had long discussions on the subject [...] "because he wanted so <b>much</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> to approve. I couldn't approve." [...] Yancey writes that, although he continued to cultivate his friendship with White, many other Christians shunned the pastor. One chapter, [...] "The Lovesick Father", retells the Parable of the Prodigal Son in a modern setting with the spendthrift child, a daughter. Yancey writes that the closest many people get to experiencing pure grace is a romantic relationship, when they believe that [...] "someone at last feels that I — I! — am the most desirable, attractive, companionable creature on the planet".|$|E

500|$|Reviews of {{the episode}} were {{generally}} positive. Ken Tucker from Entertainment Weekly praised guest actor Alan Ruck's [...] "sustained, understated" [...] performance, and also called Olivia being revealed as Bell's vessel [...] "a clever development," [...] especially praising actress Anna Torv's imitation of Nimoy's voice rather than [...] "doing the obvious thing and hav her lip-synch Nimoy reading the lines." [...] The A.V. Club's Todd VanDerWerff graded the episode with a B-, explaining that unlike Tucker, he thought the idea of [...] "soul magnets" [...] was [...] "just so goofy that it's almost too <b>much</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> to handle". VanDerWerff also felt there wasn't much of {{a connection between the}} episode and the ongoing storyline [...] "until the show tries to force one in a way that doesn't feel as elegant as the show usually makes this stuff feel". He did however praise Ruck as [...] "well-cast," [...] and wrote the episode [...] "very nearly managed" [...] to parallel Walter's [...] "desperate measures to the desperate measures of other men also trying to save themselves or their children through science," [...] which the reviewer considers the strongest asset of the show.|$|E
500|$|Bataan {{surrendered}} on 9 April, and Corregidor on 6 May. George Marshall {{decided that}} MacArthur would be awarded the Medal of Honor, a decoration {{for which he}} had twice previously been nominated, [...] "to offset any propaganda by the enemy directed at his leaving his command". [...] Eisenhower pointed out that MacArthur had not actually performed any acts of valor as required by law, but Marshall cited the 1927 award of the medal to Charles Lindbergh as a precedent. Special legislation had been passed to authorize Lindbergh's medal, but while similar legislation was introduced authorizing the medal for MacArthur by Congressmen J. Parnell Thomas and James E. Van Zandt, Marshall felt strongly that a serving general should receive the medal from the President and the War Department. MacArthur chose to accept it on the basis that [...] "this award was intended not so <b>much</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> personally as it is a recognition of the indomitable courage of the gallant army which it was my honor to command." [...] Arthur and Douglas MacArthur thus became the first father and son to be awarded the Medal of Honor. They remained the only pair until 2001, when Theodore Roosevelt was awarded posthumously for his service during the Spanish–American War, Theodore Roosevelt, Jr. having received one posthumously for his service during World War II. MacArthur's citation, written by George Marshall, read: ...|$|E
500|$|In 1993, Brown {{decided to}} quit EastEnders after {{becoming}} [...] "discontented" [...] {{with the way}} Dot was portrayed. In 1997 she revealed to the Daily Mirror: [...] "I always felt Dot {{was one of those}} characters who should stay the same. She's a simple creature. There are some people who the same things happen to them again and again. They never learn [...] When I left, there was all that rubbish about it getting too <b>much</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> [...] I stopped because I wasn't being used very much. I thought, 'It's a part-time job'. It wasn't being written properly. Instead of finding the gossip and passing it on, [...] [...] was living on a reputation. [...] said to me, 'I loved it when [...] had [...] varicose veins.' I thought: 'What?! That was in 1985, it's 1993!'. I was getting so tetchy, so I thought I'd go. I'd had enough. They were a bit shocked, because apparently there were some good stories coming up." [...] Expanding on this in 2008, Brown stated that she [...] "didn’t like what they were doing with Dot– she was meant to spread the gossip. Originally she was a fountain of knowledge then next thing I know, people are telling Dot what had been happening and I thought, ‘No, this just won’t do’. I was very annoyed, I felt like they had completely changed my character." [...] The character departed on-screen in August 1993, when Dot moved away from the soap's setting to live with her son Nick and his family in Gravesend, Kent.|$|E

2500|$|After the {{commercial}} and critical failure of the film, Carpenter became very disillusioned with Hollywood and became an independent filmmaker. He said in an interview, [...] "The experience [...] was the reason I stopped making movies for the Hollywood studios. I won't work for them again.

[...] He added that while it is [...] "creative enough to be worth a recommendation, it lacks the originality of the first flick" [...] and concluded that [...] "The Raid 2 will delight genre fans, but might not impress to many others." ...|$|E

2500|$|Red Sox {{pitching}} coach John Farrell stated that Buchholz {{would most likely}} be in line for 180–190 innings in the 2008 season. On May 15, Buchholz {{was placed on the}} 15-day disabled list {{as the result of a}} torn fingernail. He was optioned to Triple-A Pawtucket following the injury, and remained there for several weeks to work on his fastball. On July 11, he was recalled to Boston and was part of their regular pitching rotation, though he did not record a single win after his return. On August 20, as the Red Sox were trying to sweep the Orioles, the team that Buchholz had no-hit the preceding year, he gave up a 4–0 lead by allowing three runs in the second inning and two more in the third. He was removed after only pitching [...] innings. In his previous start, he had only lasted three innings. In 2008, the Red Sox were 3–12 in Buchholz' fifteen starts. After the game, Buchholz was demoted to Double-A Portland. Buchholz stated [...] "I've never had a streak like this", and [...] "I've never been one to say the pressure was too <b>much</b> <b>for</b> <b>me,</b> but I've felt like I've had a lot of weight on my shoulders just trying to be perfect and trying to do everything as well as I could to help this team win". Following the 2008 season, Buchholz pitched in the Arizona Fall League.|$|E
