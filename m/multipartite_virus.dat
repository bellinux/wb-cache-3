40|$|<b>Multipartite</b> <b>viruses</b> {{have one}} of the most puzzling genetic {{organizations}} found in living organisms. These viruses have several genome segments, each containing only a part of the genetic information, and each individually encapsidated into a separate virus particle. While countless studies on molecular and cellular mechanisms of the infection cycle of <b>multipartite</b> <b>viruses</b> are available, just as for other virus types, very seldom is their lifestyle questioned at the viral system level. Moreover, the rare available "system" studies are purely theoretical, and their predictions on the putative benefit/cost balance of this peculiar genetic organization have not received experimental support. In light of ongoing progresses in general virology, we here challenge the current hypotheses explaining the evolutionary success of <b>multipartite</b> <b>viruses</b> and emphasize their shortcomings. We also discuss alternative ideas and research avenues to be explored in the future in order to solve the long-standing mystery of how viral systems composed of interdependent but physically separated information units can actually be functional...|$|R
40|$|<b>Multipartite</b> <b>viruses</b> {{contain more}} than one {{distinctive}} genome component, and the origin of <b>multipartite</b> <b>viruses</b> has been suggested to evolve from a non-segmented wild-type virus. To explore whether recombination also {{plays a role in}} the evolution of the genomes of <b>multipartite</b> <b>viruses,</b> we developed a systematic approach that employs motif-finding tools to detect conserved motifs from divergent genomic regions and applies statistical approaches to select high-confidence motifs. The information that this approach provides helps us understand the evolution of viruses. In this study, we compared our motif-based strategy with current alignment-based recombination-detecting methods and applied our methods to the analysis of multipartite single-stranded plant DNA viruses, including bipartite begomoviruses, Banana bunchy top virus (BBTV) (consisting of 6 genome components) and Faba bean necrotic yellows virus (FBNYV) (consisting of 8 genome components). Our analysis revealed that recombination occurred between genome components in some begomoviruses, BBTV and FBNYV. Our data also show that several unusual recombination events have contributed to the evolution of BBTV genome components. We believe that similar approaches can be applied to resolve the evolutionary history of other viruses...|$|R
50|$|A <b>multipartite</b> <b>virus</b> is a {{computer}} virus that infects and spreads in multiple ways. The term was coined to describe the first viruses that included DOS executable files and PC BIOS boot sector virus code, where both parts are viral themselves. Prior {{to the discovery of}} the first of these, viruses were categorized as either file infectors or boot infectors. Because of the multiple vectors for the spread of infection, these viruses could spread faster than a boot or file infector alone.|$|E

40|$|Multipartite plant viruses were {{discovered}} because of discrepancies between the observed dose response and {{predictions of the}} independent-action hypothesis (IAH) model. Theory suggests {{that the number of}} genome segments predicts the shape of the dose-response curve, but a rigorous test of this hypothesis has not been reported. Here, Alfalfa mosaic virus (AMV), a tripartite Alfamovirus, and transgenic Nicotiana tabacum plants expressing no (wild type), one (P 2), or two (P 12) viral genome segments were used to test whether the number of genome segments necessary for infection predicts the dose response. The dose-response curve of wild-type plants was steep and congruent with the predicted kinetics of a <b>multipartite</b> <b>virus,</b> confirming previous results. Moreover, for P 12 plants, the data support the IAH model, showing that the expression of virus genome segments by the host plant can modulate the infection kinetics of a tripartite virus to those of a monopartite virus. However, the different types of virus particles occurred at different frequencies, with a ratio of 116 : 45 : 1 (RNA 1 to RNA 2 to RNA 3), which will affect infection kinetics and required analysis with a more comprehensive infection model. This analysis showed that each type of virus particle has a different probability of invading the host plant, at both the primary- and systemic-infection levels. While the number of genome segments affects the dose response, taking into consideration differences in the infection kinetics of the three types of AMV particles results in {{a better understanding of the}} infection process.

50|$|The <b>multipartite</b> <b>viruses</b> {{are often}} tricky {{and hard to}} eliminate. When all {{infected}} files have been cleaned, but the virus remains in the boot sector, files on the system will be infected again.

40|$|BGPI : équipe 2 Nanoviruses are {{characterized}} by a genome composed of 6 to 8 circular ssDNA segments, each encapsidated individually in a distinct virus particle. A classical view in virology assumes that the viral replication cycle occurs within individual cells, where the whole viral genome information is replicated, and is then reiterated in successively infected cells during host invasion. In the context of multipartite viruses and of nanoviruses in particular, this view implies {{that at least one}} copy of each of the genome segments must repeatedly enter together in individual cells for successful infection and maintenance of the integral genome. Because one or more genome segments may be missing in numerous susceptible cells, thus aborting infection, the multipartite viral systems are believed to bear an enormous cost, which drastically increases with the number of segments constituting the viral genome. It has even been concluded that multipartite viruses with an elevated number of segments (typically member species of the family Nanoviridae) appear so costly that they should not have evolved and should thus not exist! To address this paradox, we have experimentally tested the thus far undisputed assumption that the segments of a <b>multipartite</b> <b>virus</b> must be together within individual cells for the system to be functional. For this, we used the nanovirus Faba bean necrotic stunt virus, which genome is composed of 8 segments. Our results indicate that the various segments are not always together within individual cells and yet, that the system scattered over several distinct cells appears functional. This observation has important implications. First, it questions the cost that has always been attributed to multipartite viral systems, where gathering a copy of each segments in single cells was though to be mandatory. Second, it demonstrates that the replication cycle of a virus is not necessarily “cell-autonomous” and that the spatial unit of a virus replication cycle can be, in some cases, an ensemble of interconnected cells within which the various part of viral genetic information are obviously communicating.

40|$|BGPI : équipe 2 The {{invention}} of {{next generation sequencing}} techniques (NGS) marked the coming {{of a new era}} in the detection of genetic diversity of intra-host viral populations. A good understanding of the genetic structure of these populations first requires being able to identify the different isolates or variants, and second to accurately quantify them. However, the initial amplification step of NGS studies can impose potential quantitative biases modifying the variant relative frequencies. In particular, the number of target molecules (NTM) used during the amplification step is vastly overlooked, though of primary importance as it sets the limit of the accuracy and the sensitivity of the sequencing procedure. In the present article, we investigated quantitative biases in the NGS study of populations of a multipartite ssDNA virus at different steps of the procedure. We studied 20 independent populations of the ssDNA Faba Bean Necrotic Stunt Virus (FBNSV) virus in two host plants, Faba bean and Medicago. The FBNSV is a <b>multipartite</b> <b>virus</b> composed of eight genomic segments, whose specific and host-dependent relative frequencies are defined as the "genome formula". Our results show significant distortion of the FBNSV genome formula after the amplification and the sequencing steps. We also quantified the genetic bottleneck occurring at the amplification step by documenting the NTM of two genomic segments of the FBNSV. We argue that the NTM must be documented and carefully considered when interpreting the sensitivity and accuracy of NGS studies. Importance The advent of next generation sequencing techniques (NGS) now enables studying the genetic diversity of viral populations. A good understanding of the genetic structure of these populations first requires being able to identify the different isolates or variants, and second to accurately quantify them. Prior to sequencing, viral genomes need to be amplified, a step that potentially imposes quantitative biases and modifies the viral population structure. In particular, the number of target molecules (NTM) used during the amplification step is of primary importance as it sets the limit of the accuracy and the sensitivity of the sequencing procedure. In this work, we used 20 replicated populations of the multipartite Faba Bean Necrotic Stunt Virus (FBNSV) to estimate the various limitations of ultra deep sequencing studies performed on intra-host viral populations. We report quantitative biases during Rolling Circle Amplification and the NTM of two genomic segments of the FBNSV...|$|E
40|$|Positive sense RNA viruses play {{a central}} role in the field of {{virology}} in general and agriculture in particular. Cucumber mosaic virus (CMV) is a positive sense RNA virus, playing an important role in agriculture because of its broad host range, as it can infect over 1200 species of plants. CMV is sometime accompanied by satellite RNA, a 336 nucleotides long noncoding RNA, which can either ameliorate or intensify symptom expression by the virus. CMV is a <b>multipartite</b> <b>virus,</b> requiring a constellation of three virion particles to initiate a successful infection. Chapter 1 of this dissertation focuses on optimization the Agrobacterium cell concentration of three genomic RNA agroconstructs of Brome mosaic virus (BMV), a widely used model system to study replication, recombination and packaging in positive sense RNA viruses. In this chapter, the focus is made on understanding effect of optical density (O. D 600) of Agrobacterium cell cultures on synchronized infection followed viral gene expression. Chapter 2 is largely focused on understanding the mechanism regulating nuclear import of satellite RNA (satRNA) in the presence and absence of CMV. It was identified that Bromodomain containing RNA binding protein (BRP 1), an ortholog of which has been previously documented to play an important role in the life cycle of Potato Spindle Tuber Viroid (PSTVd), plays a crucial role in the nuclear import of satRNA. Information garnered in this chapter helped bridging the evolutionary gap between satellite RNA and PSTVd. In Chapter 3, an attempt is made to understand the proteome interacting with BRP 1, whose functionality in a plant is yet unknown. By using proteomic approaches, we were able to understand proteome interacting with BRP 1 by itself, or in the presence of CMV or satellite RNA in Nicotiana benthamiana plants. Chapter 4 is an extension of chapter 3, where single gene knockout lines of Arabidopsis thaliana of short listed host proteins from chapter 3 were tested for their role in CMV replication, and specificaly the role of Glyceraldehyde 3 phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) in replicase complex assembly/stability was studied. Understanding the shift in proteome of host in case of a satRNA is a daunting task (due to the inability of satRNA to code for proteins), hence, we employed riboproteomic approach in Chapter 5 to short list host proteins interacting with satellite RNA in plus- or minus- sense, in the presence or absence of CMV. Viral protein-protein interactions play an important role in the replication of positive sense RNA viruses. Chapter 6, and 7 focus on comparative study of protein protein interactions for two important members of Bromoviridae family. In chapter 6, live cell imaging using BiFC analysis helped us visualize protein protein interactions and subcellular localization of BMV proteins [...] Finally, in Chapter 7, we provide an extensive protein-protein interaction study of CMV viral proteins in vivo using Bimolecular Fluorescence complementation (BiFC) assay...|$|E
40|$|The {{multiplicity}} of infection (MOI), i. e., the number of virus genomes that infect a cell, is a key parameter in virus evolution, as it determines processes such as genetic exchange among genomes, selection intensity on viral genes, epistatic interactions, {{and the evolution of}} <b>multipartite</b> <b>viruses.</b> In fact, the MOI level is equivalent to the virus ploidy during genome expression. Nevertheless, there are few experimental estimates of MOI, particularly for viruses with eukaryotic hosts. Here we estimate the MOI of Tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) in its systemic host, Nicotiana benthamiana. The progress of infection of two TMV genotypes, differently tagged with the green or red fluorescent proteins GFP and RFP, was monitored by determining the number of leaf cell protoplasts that showed GFP, RFP, or GFP and RFP fluorescence at different times postinoculation. This approach allowed the quantitative analysis of the kinetics of infection and estimation of the generation time and the number of infection cycles required for leaf colonization. MOI levels were estimated from the frequency of cells infected by only TMV-GFP or TMV-RFP. The MOI was high, but it changed during the infection process, decreasing from an initial level of about 6 to a final one of 1 to 2, with most infection cycles occurring at the higher MOI levels. The decreasing MOI can be explained by mechanisms limiting superinfection and/or by genotype competition within double-infected cells, which was shown to occur in coinfected tobacco protoplasts. To our knowledge, this is the first estimate of MOI during virus colonization of a eukaryotic host...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the {{mathematical}} modeling of evolutionary processes {{that take place in}} heterogeneous populations. Its leitmotif is the response of complex ensembles of replicating entities to multiple (and often opposite) selection pressures. Even though the specific problems addressed in different chapters belong to different organizational levels—genome, population, and community—all of them can be conceptualized as the evolution of a heterogeneous population—let it be a population of genomic elements, viruses, or prokaryotic hosts and phages—facing a complex environment. As a result, the mathematical tools required for their study are quite similar. In contrast, the strategies that each population has discovered to perpetuate vary according to the different evolutionary challenges and environmental constraints that the population experiences. Along this thesis, there has been a special interest on connecting theoretical models with experimental results. To that end, most of the work presented here has been motivated either by laboratory findings or by the bioinformatic analysis of sequenced genomes. We strongly believe that such a multidisciplinary approach is necessary in order to improve our knowledge on how evolution works. Moreover, experiments are a must when it comes to propose antiviral strategies based on theoretical predictions, as we do in Chapter 3. This thesis is structured in two main blocks. The first one focuses on studying instances of viral evolution under the action of mutagenic drugs, paying particular attention to their possible application to the development of novel antiviral therapies. This block comprises chapters 2 and 3; the former dicussing the phenomenon of lethal defection and stochastic viral extinction; the latter dealing with the optimal way to combine mutagens and inhibitors in multidrug antiviral treatments. The second block is devoted {{to the study of the}} evolutionary forces underlying genome structure. In chapter 4, we propose a mechanism through which <b>multipartite</b> <b>viruses</b> could have originated. Interestingly, the pathway leading to genome segmentation shares some steps with lethal defection, but each outcome is reached at specific environmental conditions. Chapter 5 analyses the abundance distributions of transposable elements in prokaryotic genomes, with the aim of determining the key processes involved in their spreading. We explicitly explore the hypothesis that transposable elements follow a neutral dynamics, with a negligible fitness cost for their host genomes. A higher level of organization is studied in Chapter 6, where an agent based coevolutionary model based on Lotka-Volterra interactions is used to investigate the evolutionary dynamics of the prokaryotic antiviral immunity system CRISPR-Cas. This chapter also examines the environmental factors that are responsible for its maintenance or loss. Finally, Chapter 7 summarizes the main results obtained along the thesis and sketches possible lines of work based on them...|$|R
40|$|Sindbis virus, {{the type}} {{member of the}} alpha-viruses, is an enveloped virus {{containing}} a nonsegmented positive-strand RNA genome. We show that the nonstructural and the structural genes can function to produce infectious virus particles when they are expressed on two different RNA segments.

40|$|Fig mosaic virus (FMV) is a <b>multipartite</b> negative-sense RNA <b>virus</b> infecting fig trees worldwide. FMV is {{transmitted}} by vegetative propagation and grafting of plant materials, {{and by the}} eriophyid mite Aceria ficus. In this work, the genetic variation and evolutionary mechanisms shaping FMV populations were characterized. Nucleotide sequences from four genomic regions (each within the genomic RNAs 1, 2, 3, and 4) from FMV isolates from different countries were determined and analyzed. FMV genetic variation was low, as is seen for many other plant viruses. Phylogenetic analysis showed some geographically distant FMV isolates which clustered together, suggesting long-distance migration. The extent of migration was limited, although varied, between countries, such that FMV populations of different countries were genetically differentiated. Analysis using several recombination algorithms suggests that genomes of some FMV isolates originated by reassortment of genomic RNAs from different genetically similar isolates. Comparison between nonsynonymous and synonymous substitutions showed selection acting on some amino acids; however, most evolved neutrally. This and neutrality tests together with the limited gene flow suggest that genetic drift {{plays an important role}} in shaping FMV populations...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Beet Necrotic Yellow Vein virus (BNYVV) is {{a member}} of the genus Benyvirus causing a {{worldwide}} sugar beet disease rhizomania. BNYVV contains four or five plus-sense single stranded RNAs. In altered selective conditions, <b>multipartite</b> RNA <b>viruses</b> of plant are prone to undergoing internal deletions, thus turning into Defective RNAs (D RNAs). Although several D RNAs have been reported in BNYVV infection, the spontaneous internal deletion mutants responsible for severe symptom in systemic host Nicotiana benthamiana (N. benthamiana) are not described so far. Results Systemic host N. benthamiana was inoculated by Chinese BNYVV isolates. RT-PCR and Northern blot showed that the D RNAs forms of BNYVV RNA 3 were present in the systemic infection of the N. benthamiana. Three distinct D-RNA 3 s, named as D-RNA 3 &# 945;, D-RNA 3 &# 946; and D-RNA 3 &# 947;, were made into infectious clones. When inoculated on the N. benthamiana, the in vitro transcripts of D forms exhibited more stable than that of wild-type RNA 3 in systemic movement. Among the detected mutant, the p 25 protein frame-shift mutant (D-RNA 3 &# 945;) induced obvious necrotic lesions on Tetragonia. expansa (T. expansa) and pronounced systemic symptom on the N. benthamiana. The D-RNA 3 &# 945; was further mutated artificially to pre-terminate the downstream N protein, leading to the abolishment of the pathogenicity, indicating the N protein was responsible for the necrotic symptom. Conclusion Our studies demonstrated the internal deletion mutants of BNYVV-RNA 3 were spontaneously generated in the systemic infection on N. benthamiana. The internal deletions didn't affect the efficient replication of D-RNA 3 s, instead by improving the stability and pathogenicity of RNA 3 in the systemic host N. benthamiana. Besides, our results also suggested the downstream N protein of RNA 3, but not the upstream p 25 protein, may play an important role in the systemic infection on N. benthamiana...|$|R
40|$|PCR {{amplicon}} {{next generation}} sequencing (NGS) analysis offers a broadly applicable and targeted approach to detect populations of both high- or low-frequency virus variants {{in one or more}} plant samples. In this study, amplicon NGS was used to explore the diversity of the tripartite genome virus, Prunus necrotic ringspot virus (PNRSV) from 53 PNRSV-infected trees using amplicons from conserved gene regions of each of PNRSV RNA 1, RNA 2 and RNA 3. Sequencing of the amplicons from 53 PNRSV-infected trees revealed differing levels of polymorphism across the three different components of the PNRSV genome with a total number of 5040, 2083 and 5486 sequence variants observed for RNA 1, RNA 2 and RNA 3 respectively. The RNA 2 had the lowest diversity of sequences compared to RNA 1 and RNA 3, reflecting the lack of flexibility tolerated by the replicase gene that is encoded by this RNA component. Distinct PNRSV phylo-groups, consisting of closely related clusters of sequence variants, were observed in each of PNRSV RNA 1, RNA 2 and RNA 3. Most plant samples had a single phylo-group for each RNA component. Haplotype network analysis showed that smaller clusters of PNRSV sequence variants were genetically connected to the largest sequence variant cluster within a phylo-group of each RNA component. Some plant samples had sequence variants occurring in multiple PNRSV phylo-groups in at least one of each RNA and these phylo-groups formed distinct clades that represent PNRSV genetic strains. Variants within the same phylo-group of each Prunus plant sample had ≥ 97 % similarity and phylo-groups within a Prunus plant sample and between samples had less ≤ 97 % similarity. Based on the analysis of diversity, a definition of a PNRSV genetic strain was proposed. The proposed definition was applied to determine the number of PNRSV genetic strains in each of the plant samples and the complexity in defining genetic strains in <b>multipartite</b> genome <b>viruses</b> was explored...|$|R
40|$|BGPI : équipe 2 Nanoviruses are <b>multipartite</b> ssDNA <b>viruses</b> {{transmitted}} by aphid vectors. Their {{mode of transmission}} {{is believed to be}} of the circulative non-propagative type [1, 2], but a recent analysis of the relative frequency of the distinct genome segments in aphids versus in plants indicated a more complex relationship [3]. Previous microscopy studies using immunofluorescence against the coat protein of Banana bunshy top virus (BBTV) confirmed that the virus is detected solely in gut and principal salivary gland cells of its aphid vector Pentalonia nigronervosa [4]. However, the subcellular localization and the cell compartment(s) with which the virus associates during transcytosis could not be determined [5]. Another unresolved question is whether, as demonstrated in monopartite viruses, nanoviruses are submitted to strong bottleneck during aphid transmission (see the abstract by Romain Gallet). In that case, when the virus particles traverse cellular barrier, different particles containing different segments may be separated, increasing the chance of loosing genomic information (loosing segments) and thus aborting transmission. We have revisited the cycle of a nanovirus, the Faba bean necrotic stunt virus, within the body of its aphid vector, Acyrthosiphon pisum, using a combination of FISH (Fluorescent In Situ Hybridization), immunolabelling, confocal and electron microscopy. FISH labeling of viral DNA indicates that the virus massively accumulates in all cells of the midgut but is virtually absent in all other regions of the gut. At the salivary glands, the virus is very much restricted not only to the principal salivary glands but also to a single cell type within these glands. No signal could ever be detected in any other organ. When using DNA-FISH probes specific to distinct segments, we could demonstrate that all segments are always colocalized within the midgut, {{and to a lesser extent}} also within the salivary gland cells. This observation contrasts with the situation in infected plant cells (see abstract from Anne Sicard), and indicate that the size of the viral population traversing cellular barriers within the aphid is often sufficiently large to prevent the loss of rare genome segments. Finally, we have indication that the genome segment N controls internalization of the virus within aphid gut cells. We currently investigate the subcellular compartment with which the virus associates, and the mode of action of the NSP protein (product of gene N...|$|R
40|$|Plant {{virus species}} of the family Nanoviridae have {{segmented}} genomes with the highest known number of segments encapsidated individually. They thus likely represent the most extreme case of the so-called <b>multipartite,</b> or multicomponent, <b>viruses.</b> All {{species of the}} family {{are believed to be}} transmitted in a circulative nonpropagative manner by aphid vectors, meaning that the virus simply crosses cellular barriers within the aphid body, from the gut to the salivary glands, without replicating or even expressing any of its genes. However, this assumption is largely based on analogy with the transmission of other plant viruses, such as geminiviruses or luteoviruses, and the details of the molecular and cellular interactions between aphids and nanoviruses are poorly investigated. When comparing the relative frequencies of the eight genome segments in populations of the species Faba bean necrotic stunt virus (FBNSV) (genus Nanovirus) within host plants and within aphid vectors fed on these plants, we unexpectedly found evidence of reproducible changes in the frequencies of some specific segments. We further show that these changes occur within the gut during early stages of the virus cycle in the aphid and not later, when the virus is translocated into the salivary glands. This peculiar observation, which was similarly confirmed in three aphid vector species, Acyrthosiphon pisum, Aphis craccivora, and Myzus persicae, calls for revisiting of the mechanisms of nanovirus transmission. It reveals an unexpected intimate interaction that may not fit the canonical circulative nonpropagative transmission. IMPORTANCE A specific mode of interaction between viruses and arthropod vectors has been extensively described in plant viruses in the three families Luteoviridae, Geminiviridae, and Nanoviridae, but never in arboviruses of animals. This so-called circulative nonpropagative transmission contrasts with the classical biological transmission of animal arboviruses in that the corresponding viruses are thought to cross the vector cellular barriers, from the gut lumen to the hemolymph and to the salivary glands, without expressing any of their genes and without replicating. By monitoring the genetic composition of viral populations during the life cycle of Faba bean necrotic stunt virus (FBNSV) (genus Nanovirus), we demonstrate reproducible genetic changes during the transit of the virus within the body of the aphid vector. These changes do not fit the view that viruses simply traverse the bodies of their arthropod vectors and suggest more intimate interactions, calling into question the current understanding of circulative nonpropagative transmission...|$|R
