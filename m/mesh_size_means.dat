HavUnders., 16 : 531 - 550. From 6 February to 30 March 1974 during the spawning migration of Arcto-Norwegian cod, a fishing {{experiment with}} gill nets made of continuous multifilament nylon, nylon monofilament and nylon monotwine {{was carried out}} in Lofoten. The different types of nets were combined to make upone gill net setting consisting of 40 to 92 single nets, half of which were multifilament nylon nets and one quarter each monofilament and monotwine nets. The sequence of the single nets was varied during the experiment. The result for the total experiment was that the monofilament nets caught 26 % (in numbers) more cod than the multifilament nylon nets and 38 % more than the monotwine nets. For saithe the monotwine nets were apparently the most and the multifilament nylon nets the least efficient. The average length of the captured fish was slightly higher for the multifilament nylon than for the monofilament nets whereas the fish caught by the monotwine nets were somewhat smaller. Taking the length frequency of cod caught by purse seine in the same area during the experiment as representative for the cod available to the gill nets, a log-normal distribution selection curve was fitted {{for each of the three}} types of gill nets. The <b>mesh</b> <b>size</b> used in the experiment (186 mm) was clearly too small to obtain maximum catches of the available cod. Assuming proportionality between <b>mesh</b> <b>size</b> and <b>mean</b> selection length gave optimum <b>mesh</b> <b>sizes</b> of 224 mm for nylon, 222 mm for monofilament and 234 mm for monotwine. The ratios between the theoretical maximum catches thus obtained were: Monofilament: Nylon = 1. 46; Monotwine: Nylon = 1. 48; Monotwine: Monofilament = 1. 02. Assuming that all length groups are equally numerous among the cod available to the nets, ratios between the catch efficiency of the three nets, which should represent a more general situation, were calculated, giving: Monofilament: Nylon = 1. 23; Monotwine: Nylon = 1. 15; Monofilament: Monotwine = 1. 07.

40|$|The unified gas-kinetic scheme (UGKS) is {{a direct}} {{modeling}} method for multiple scale transports. The modeling scale of the scheme is the <b>mesh</b> <b>size</b> and time step, and the ratios of the <b>mesh</b> <b>size</b> over particle <b>mean</b> free path or the time step over particle collision time determine the local evolution regime of flow physics. For unsteady flow computation, due to the CFL condition the time step in the explicit UGKS {{is limited by the}} smallest cell size in the computational domain. As a result, for a largely stretched non-uniform mesh the global time step becomes very small and the ratio of the time step over local particle collision time may get a very small value. Under such a circumstance, the physics in explicit UGKS may be constrained by the kinetic scale physics only. The multiscale UGKS reduces into a single scale discrete velocity method where the free transport is used for the flux evaluation. In order to keep the advantages of UGKS and improve the efficiency for unsteady flow computation, the restriction from global CFL condition on the time step has to be removed. In this paper, we develop an implicit UGKS (IUGKS) for unsteady flow by alternatively solving the macroscopic and microscopic governing equations within a step iteratively. In order to preserve the coherent flow evolution and multiscale nature, the numerical flux is still evaluated by the explicit UGKS with the local CFL condition. Therefore, the multiscale property of the UGKS modeling is preserved over non-uniform meshes. Many numerical examples are included to validate the scheme for both continuum and rarefied flows.

The main {{purpose of the present}} study was to estimate the selectivity {{parameters of}} monofilament gill nets <b>mesh</b> <b>size</b> of 56, 64 and 72 mm (stretched <b>mesh</b> <b>size)</b> used for European chub (Leuciscus cephalus L. 1758) in Atikhisar Reservoir, Canakkale, Turkey. The indirect method proposed by Holt was used for the estimation of the selectivity parameters. The common selection factors and common standard deviation of monofilament gill nets were determined as 4. 25 and 2. 37, respectively. For sustainable fisheries of european chub, the minimum <b>mesh</b> <b>size</b> of monofilament gill nets must be greater than 47 mm stretched <b>mesh</b> <b>size...</b>|$|R
40|$|Existing {{methods of}} {{determining}} the best <b>mesh</b> <b>size</b> for tropical multispecies trawl fisheries are highly simplistic and do not reliably estimate the <b>mesh</b> <b>size</b> providing maximum yield in weight or value. A method of estimating the <b>mesh</b> <b>size</b> providing greatest yield by weight or value is presented, based on the Beverton and Holt (1957) single-species model. Yield-per-recruit analysis is inapplicable in a multispecies fishery, and calculation of optimal <b>mesh</b> <b>size</b> requires estimates of relative recruit-ment to the populations comprising the fishery. Methods of estimating absolute or relative recruitment from commercial catch and effort time series data, average commercial catch data, and research vessel survey data are given. The methods of estimating optimum <b>mesh</b> <b>size</b> and recruitment are applied to data from the northwest shelf of Australia. The estimates of relative recruitment provided by all methods were consistent. The (stretched) <b>mesh</b> <b>size</b> optimizing total catch for the NW shelf fishery was stable {{over a wide range}} of input parameter values, inclu-ding fishing mortality and recruitment. In principle, total yield can be estimated if estimates of absolute recruitment are available, but sensitivity analysis indicates the precision of yield estimated to be very low...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Inguinal hernia is {{a common}} {{condition}} and its repair (herniorrhaphy) {{is one of the}} most commonly performed procedures in general surgery. The Lichtenstein herniorrhaphy technique is a widely used and effective surgery that uses mesh to reinforce the area of weakness. Although a wide range of <b>mesh</b> <b>sizes</b> are available for use in hernia repair, in low-resource health care settings the provision of multiple products may not be supportable and it may be necessary for the provision and use of a single <b>mesh</b> <b>size.</b> This study aimed to determine whether the recommended 7. 0 cm x 15. 0 cm size is an appropriate single <b>mesh</b> <b>size.</b> Methods In order to determine the optimal <b>mesh</b> <b>size</b> according to recommended surgical practices, in vivo measurements of key dimensions of the inguinal floor were taken in patients undergoing herniorrhaphy. Results Measurements were taken in 43 patients: 40 men and 3 women, mean age 43 years (SD 13. 6); 39 with indirect hernias, 4 with direct. Allowing for recommended mesh overlaps, the optimal <b>mesh</b> <b>size</b> for provision to be appropriate for the majority of patients was determined to be 8. 5 cm x 14. 0 cm, 21 % wider than the <b>mesh</b> <b>size</b> currently recommended for use in Lichtenstein herniorrhaphy. Conclusions An appropriate size for routine provision in low-resource settings, or other settings where the provision of several <b>mesh</b> <b>sizes</b> is not supportable, may be 8. 5 cm x 14. 0 cm. </p...|$|R

40|$|A new <b>mesh</b> <b>size</b> {{field is}} {{presented}} that is {{specifically designed for}} efficient meshing of highly irregular oceanic domains: archipelagos. The new approach {{is based on the}} standard <b>mesh</b> <b>size</b> field that uses the proximity to the nearest coastline. Here, the proximities to the two nearest coastlines are used to calculate the distance between two islands or the width of a strait through an archipelago. The local value of the <b>mesh</b> <b>size</b> field is taken as the width (or distance between two islands) divided by the number of required elements across the strait (or between the islands). This new <b>mesh</b> <b>size</b> fields are illustrated for three examples: (1) the Aegean Sea, (2) the Indonesian Archipelago, and (3) the Canadian Arctic Archipelago.

40|$|Local fishery {{managers}} in Lake Sahajärvi tried to increase pikeperch yields {{by increasing the}} minimum allowed <b>mesh</b> <b>size</b> from 45 to 60 mm and size limit from 37 to 40 cm. However, due to the slow growth of pikeperch these measures may not be reasonable. Here, pikeperch yields were modelled with an age and size-structured yield-per-recruit model {{as a function of}} <b>mesh</b> <b>size.</b> Besides yields, also the proportion of minimum landing size and immature pikeperch caught with a different <b>mesh</b> <b>size</b> were evaluated. The results showed that maximum yields per recruit can be obtained with a 44 mm <b>mesh</b> <b>size</b> corresponding to yields of about 180 kg per 1000 age 2 pikeperch while with 60 mm <b>mesh</b> <b>size</b> the estimated yields are only 46 kg. The share of immature pikeperch is only 0. 4 % in 44 mm <b>mesh</b> <b>size</b> nets due to very small average size at maturity (24. 8 cm TL) of both sexes. Because the observed growth is slow (k =  0. 11 and L∞ =  65. 28 cm TL) and the density of pikeperch (BPUE in NORDIC nettings =  1200 g·net- 1) is high, the most reasonable management measure to improve growth and average size could be to radically decrease population density...|$|R
