50|$|The Amalgamated Association of Operative Cotton Spinners, Self-Actor Minders, Twiners and Rovers of Lancashire and Adjoining Counties {{was formed}} in 1870. The new union grew rapidly and by the late 1880s {{approximately}} 90 percent of cotton spinners were members. The union had 18,000 members {{at the turn of}} the century. By 1910 almost 100% of male <b>mule</b> <b>spinners</b> were members and its membership numbered 22000. The Amalgamation used the high level of union membership amongst <b>mule</b> <b>spinners</b> to restrict the supply of labour to employers, ensuring that their members were able to receive wages and working conditions significantly better than most British industrial employees. This elevated position within the industrial working class led to <b>mule</b> <b>spinners</b> being known as the Barefoot Aristocrats.|$|R
25|$|About 1900 {{there was}} a high {{incidence}} of scrotal cancer detected in former <b>mule</b> <b>spinners.</b> It was limited to cotton <b>mule</b> <b>spinners</b> and did not affect woollen or condenser <b>mule</b> <b>spinners.</b> The cause was attributed to the blend of vegetable and mineral oils used to lubricate the spindles. The spindles when running threw out a mist of oil at crotch height, that was captured by the clothing of anyone piecing an end. In the 1920s much attention was given to this problem. Mules had used this mixture since the 1880s, and cotton mules ran faster and hotter than the other mules, and needed more frequent oiling. The solution was to make it a statutory requirement to only use vegetable oil or white mineral oils, which were believed to be non-carcinogens. By then cotton mules had been superseded by the ring frame and the industry was contracting, so it was never established whether these measures were effective.|$|R
50|$|The CWA {{was more}} {{aggressive}} in its attitude towards negotiating with employers than the other major cotton unions and by the mid-1960s the wages of strippers and grinders equalled those of <b>mule</b> <b>spinners,</b> traditionally the highest-paid textile workers.|$|R

[...] The mine was in {{operation}} from 1920 to 1925, but workings around the mine date back to at least 1740 and some are thought to be medieval, making it of some archeological importance. No reason has been given for the mine's unusual name, but other mines in the area are called <b>Mule</b> <b>Spinner,</b> Frogs Hole, Cackle Mackle and Wanton Legs so this mine's name is not atypical.|$|E
50|$|With the Atoms {{headed to}} the Super Bowl, Spinner and Crankcase steal Gus and replace him with an {{ordinary}} <b>mule.</b> <b>Spinner</b> and Crankcase check into a local hotel and lock up Gus with them and Gus breaks the TV and the hotel room door. At the Super Bowl, Andy quickly realizes the mule he has is not Gus, and he and Cooper leave by helicopter to search for Gus. When the two criminals watch the game on TV, Gus goes wild and escapes. In a long comic sequence, Crankcase and Spinner chase Gus into a local supermarket where they unsuccessfully attempt to recapture the mule. Running from the supermarket, Gus is spotted from the air by Andy and Cooper. They airlift Gus to the Super Bowl and arrive by half-time.|$|E

50|$|Samuel Buckley {{was born}} in 1837 at Hey, Lees, to a <b>mule</b> <b>spinner.</b> He started work in a mill {{at the age of}} six. While working he got an {{education}} and studied engineering. Before he was twenty he had been appointed chief engineer at Castle Mill and Lowerhouse Mill. He had an interest in politics and was Mayor of Oldham on three occasions: 1883/4 1889/90 and 1890/1. James Taylor {{was born in}} 1838 at Shaw, and served an apprenticeship with Woolstenhulmes & Rye. Both men were engineers, though it was Taylor who dealt with the practical details, and Buckley conducted the commercial side of the business. On Taylor's death, Buckley managed the business alone. It was incorporated in 1902; and Taylor's son William took control. It was taken over by the Brightside Foundry, general engineers of Sheffield in 1947, but continued to operate under its own name.|$|E

During the seven years 1962 to 1968 there were 103 cases of scrotal cancer {{reported}} to the Manchester Regional Cancer Registry. It was possible to obtain reasonably full occupational histories concerning 89 of these cases either from the men themselves or from close relatives.

Another 19 men had never been <b>mule</b> <b>spinners</b> but had worked in occupations with a recognized hazard of this condition. Of the remainder, 14 had worked in occupations with a possible risk, although perhaps not generally recognized as such, and in five no clear cause was apparent. Because of the small numbers, {{it was possible to}} compare the observed and expected incidences only in broad occupational groups and these showed a statistically significant excess (P< 0 · 001) only in textile workers and unskilled workers. However, our findings, taken with those of earlier workers, suggest that further attention might be given to four other groups, namely, automatic lathe operators, road workers, dye workers, and chain makers...|$|R

50|$|Doffers in 1887 {{in a large}} mill in Cabarrus County, North Carolina, {{both boys}} and girls, earned 40 cents a day. In New England in the 1890s, the doffers, piecers and back boys had their own union, and were not {{admitted}} to the mule spinners' union, even though they often aspired to become <b>mule</b> <b>spinners.</b> Many left the industry rather than tolerate the conditions. William Madison Wood, the manager at the Washington Mill in Lawrence, Massachusetts instituted a system in 1895 where employees gained bonuses for meeting production quotas, {{as long as they}} missed no more than one day per month. The effect was that weavers drove spinners to produce, spinners drove doffers and so on, and that workers came in even when sick or injured. Wood then used the increased pay to justify running the looms at ever faster speeds.|$|R
40|$|In the Lancashire {{cotton textile}} industry, <b>mule</b> <b>spinners</b> were prone to a chronic and {{sometimes}} fatal skin cancer (often affecting the groin). The disease had reached epidemic proportions by the 1920 s, which necessitated {{action by the}} government, employers, and trade unions. In contrast to previous accounts, {{this article focuses on}} the government's reaction to mule spinners' cancer. Using official records in the National Archives, the slow introduction of health and safety measures by the government is explored in detail. Although obstructionism by the employers played a key role, {{one of the reasons for}} government inaction was the ambiguity of scientific research on engineering oils. On the other hand, prolonged scientific research suited a government policy that was framed around self regulation - a policy that had proved largely ineffective by the 1950 s. epithelioma, industrial cancer, occupational health, self-regulation,...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Were {{ordinary}} {{factory workers}} unskilled and was technology “de-skilling ” during the Industrial Revolution? I measure foregone output {{to estimate the}} human capital investments in <b>mule</b> <b>spinners</b> and power loom tenders in ante-bellum Lowell. These investments rivaled those of craft apprentices. Although factory workers were unskilled in a sense, the implementation of this technology depended {{on the development of}} a labor force with substantial human capital. From 1834 - 55, firms made increasing investments in skill, allowing workers to tend more machines, thus raising labor productivity. This growing investment was motivated partly by changing factor prices and more by a changing labor supply. Calculations show that firm policy and social conditions, including literacy, influenced the investment in factory skills. When skills are considered, technological change at Lowell appears as a broad social process, dependent as much on innovation in institutions as on invention of machines...|$|R

When new premises were required for a Mechanics' Institution, he gave £500 towards that project. He subscribed fifty guineas towards a memorial statue of Samuel Crompton, the inventor, and proposed that something should be given to his descendants, saying: [...] "If Crompton had been a great general and had killed thousands of people, the Government would have provided him with a small county, and given him a peerage; but as he had given livelihood to thousands of <b>mule</b> <b>spinners,</b> it was left to the people to provide for his distressed descendants." [...] The town would have given Thomasson any office in its power, but he refused to be Alderman, Mayor, or Member of Parliament. He declined testimonials or statue.

50|$|The 18th-century woollen {{industry}} of small producers in southern England was {{far different from}} the Yorkshire-based worsted industry where the clothier imported and owned the raw material and sold the cloth. He put out work to small weavers, in effect, employing them. Worsted was more capital intensive. The small weavers banded together to form self-help guilds. When Lancashire adopted cotton, the same process occurred. But in Lancashire cotton mills, spinning became a male occupation, and the tradition of unions passed into the factory. As spinners were 'assisted' by several 'piecers' there was a pool of trained labour to replace any spinner the owner cared to dismiss. The well paid <b>mule</b> <b>spinners</b> were the 'barefoot aristocrats' of labour and became organised in the 19th century. They paid union dues, and were well placed to finance themselves should a strike be needed. The Yorkshire worsted industry, adopted the ring frame which required less skill. Worsted spinning was an occupation for young girls. Unionism did not develop in Yorkshire until 1914. In, 1913 figures show 50% of cotton operatives were unionised while only 10% of wool and worsted workers.|$|R

A one-story section was built in 1900 that housed six pairs of spinning mules In 1904, the second floor over the mule spinning was built and 56 duck C&K looms were added, while the <b>mule</b> <b>spinners</b> were removed and twisters installed. In 1939, a shop addition was built. In 1940, the spinning room was added and the 60” Draper addition was built, also drapery looms were moved from both New York Mills and Brookford. In the 1930s, it became a United Merchants Mill. The plant continued operation until shutting down in 1970. In 1972 Integrated Products bought the plant and operated it until 1989. At that time, the plant was acquired in a leveraged buyout by David Bridges but retained its name. The plant closed its doors on March 31, 1990. In October 1990, Diamond Rug and Carpet, a Dalton Company, purchased the plant and operated it until 1994.

In practice, much younger children were working longer hours at jobs such as doffing.

40|$|Using {{accounting}} records and financial data, a business {{history of the}} Lancashire textile industry from 1870 to 1914 is presented. Issues of technology and industry structure, which have attracted {{a great deal of}} comment are first re-addressed. The discussion is then widened to include other aspects of the industry which have previously been neglected, namely the social processes of capital accumulation with reference to those evolving relationships between managers and shareholders which, in the context of broader economic change, helped forge the special characteristics of Lancashire capitalism. The industry is found to be generally healthy and competitive, although its fortunes were dangerously dependent on the overseas value of the pound. Whilst the original technologies of the industrial revolution were maturing, the alternative twentieth century means of automated throughput had still not been developed. External economies and flexibility associated with vertical specialisation thus continued to outweigh those of integrated throughput production. Meanwhile a transformation of the industry occurred in terms of its ownership, as the previously influential small shareholder was forced to surrender influence to a rising class of promotional and financial capitalists, a trend accentuated by, inter alia, a very serious stock exchange crash in the 1890 s which forced many to sell their holdings. A shift of industry value added from labour to capital and record profits after 1900 are identified. These attracted capital into cotton and reinforced the position of the newer owners of the industry. Important features of their behaviour are examined, primarily their ability to construct impressive business empires through personal shareholdings and interference in day to day management, and their corresponding reluctance to establish professional management hierarchies, which, although increasingly common in other industries, were compromised by preference for individual, and not corporate, accumulation. Characterised as they were by their easy access to financial resources, these new capitalists might well have made sweeping changes to industry structure and technology had they chosen to do so. However, although ring spinning was found to be in general more profitable, the basis of that superiority was an extension of the process of increased specialisation. All specialised companies, whether ring <b>spinners,</b> <b>mule</b> <b>spinners,</b> or weavers, tended to do much better than their vertically integrated counterparts in the period after 1900. Evidence from this period has implications for our understanding of subsequent developments. If the industry could have been restructured before 1914, then so it could have been after the First World War when it arguably became more necessary. Pre 1914 technical constraints are identified and it is also noted that it was in the inter-war period that the means to remove them were fully developed. However, considering technical issues in conjunction with characteristics of capital ownership, it is concluded that, as the industry failed to attract investment when profit signals turned negative, for example in the 1890 s, and attracted a lot of capital in the booms of the early 1900 s, any constraint did exist to prevent restructuring it was financial rather than organisational. The process and character of capital accumulation is therefore advanced as a crucial ingredient of our understanding of business history. In short, the established financial, technical, and organisational structure, when combined with buoyant overseas monetary and trading conditions, is found to have created the synthesis of a profitable industry; when external conditions changed, financial, technical, and organisational constraints became important but in that strict and steeply descending order. Lancashire was highly vulnerable to the world market; that vulnerability was accentuated by the way in which capital was created. It was the social process of capital accumulation which was the principal determinant of the development, and perhaps therefore ultimately the decline, of a once great industry...|$|R
