She had never felt the wind in her face, the whip of a horse's mane, the buoyant, level spring of a tanning gait. It thrilled her, exhilarated her, fired her blood.

30|$|Nonetheless, how <b>to</b> <b>realize</b> an {{efficient}} recognition procedure for radar signals with large parameter variation range {{is still a}} challenging problem. The pseudo-Zernike moments have opened a wider set of applications for radar signal recognition in recent years, because the moments can provide potentially useful invariance properties such as translation, scale, and rotational invariance [20, 21]. In [22], Jarmo Lundén, et al. examined the suitability of pseudo-Zernike moments as features for radar waveform recognition, In [23], a new radar classification algorithm based on STFT and pseudo-Zernike moments features is proposed. Inspired by the aforesaid background, the pseudo-Zernike <b>moments</b> are beneficial <b>to</b> <b>realize</b> intra-pulse modulation recognition in scenarios with large variation in the signal parameters.|$|R

In this paper, we use non-subsampled shearlet {{transform}} (NSST) and Krawtchouk <b>Moment</b> Invariants (KMI) <b>to</b> <b>realize</b> image re-trieval {{based on}} texture and shape features. Shearlet {{is a new}} sparse representation tool of multidimensional function, which provides a sim-ple and efficient mathematical framework. We decompose the images by NSST. The directional subband coefficients are modeled by Generalized Gaussian Distribution (GGD). The distribution parameters are used to build texture feature vectors{{which are measured by}} Kullback–Leibler dis-tance (KLD). Meanwhile, low-order KMI are employed to extract shape features which are measured by Euclidean distance (ED). Finally, the image retrieval is achieved based on weighted distance measurement. Experimental results show the proposed retrieval system can obtain the highest retrieval rate comparing with the methods based on DWT, Con-tourlet, NSCT and DT-CWT. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: In {{order to}} improve the {{automation}} of end-hole drilling process {{in the production of}} suture needles with thread, a high-precision subpixel-based drilling method is proposed. According to the edge detection principle in mathematical morphology, combined with the characteristics of the magnified images of the ends of suture needles to be drilled, the morphological edge detection operators with variable structural elements are constructed to achieve noise suppression and fully extract the detailed information of edges of images of needle end holes to be drilled. Then, the subdivision method of spatial <b>moments</b> is adopted <b>to</b> <b>realize</b> the subpixel positioning of pixel-level edges. Finally, least squares fitting method is used to achieve the high-precision positioning of center of needle end hole to be drilled. The experimental results of the 0. 5 mm needle samples show that, the drilling method proposed in this study has a concentricity error no more than ± 0. 2 µm and an average drilling time of 0. 65 S, boasting good real-time performance and stability and meeting the automated production needs of drilling process of suture needles with thread...|$|R
