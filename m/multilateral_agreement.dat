5|$|In the 1950s and 1960s, the Organization for European Economic Cooperation (now the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development) {{had made}} several {{attempts}} {{to create a}} framework for protecting international investments, but its efforts revealed conflicting views on how to provide compensation for the expropriation of foreign direct investment. In 1961, then-General Counsel of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) Aron Broches developed {{the idea for a}} <b>multilateral</b> <b>agreement</b> on a process for resolving individual investment disputes on a case by case basis as opposed to imposing outcomes based on standards. Broches held conferences to consult legal experts {{from all parts of the}} world, including Europe, Africa, and Asia, to discuss and compose a preliminary agreement. The IBRD staff wrote an official draft of the agreement and consulted with legal representatives of the IBRD's board of directors to finalize the draft and have it approved. The board of directors approved the final draft of the agreement, titled Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States, and the Bank president disseminated the convention to its member states for signature on 18 March 1965. Twenty states immediately ratified the convention. The convention establishing the ICSID entered into force on 14 October 1966.|$|E
5|$|Indonesia is {{the largest}} {{aviation}} market in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). However, Indonesia {{is not yet a}} full member of the ASEAN open sky agreement, which plans to lift regional flying restrictions throughout Southeast Asia on member country airlines by the end of 2015 or early 2016. Indonesia is considering opening up only five of its international airports under this policy; they are Jakarta, Medan, Bali, Surabaya and Makassar. To date, Indonesia has agreed to open access to Jakarta, yet, Indonesia remains opposed to opening up its secondary cities. Currently Indonesia adopt limitations for foreign airlines to operate in Indonesia. This rather protectionist stance was meant to protect Indonesian aviation business against competitors, particularly from Singapore and Malaysia. Basically, this stance is stemmed from a systematic imbalance between ASEAN nations; as a large nation, Indonesia is able to offer hundreds of access points, while other fellow ASEAN members may offer far less points of access. Singapore for example has only one point of access, while Malaysia may offer two or three access points. This systematic imbalance for exchange of traffic rights has led Indonesian carriers to lobby their government to refrain from entering into <b>multilateral</b> <b>agreement</b> on ASEAN Single Aviation Market.|$|E

He expressed similar concerns about the <b>Multilateral</b> <b>Agreement</b> on Investment two years later, arguing that it put the rights of investors ahead of workers, environments, societies, and cultures. He wrote the NDP Minority Report on the MAI, {{which was published in}} Dismantling Democracy (edited by Andrew Jackson and Matthew Sanger).|$|E

Total research spending on cyberdefence in Israel quadrupled between 2010 and 2014 from US$50 million to US$200 million, bringing Israel’s spending to about 15% of global research spending on cyberdefence in 2014.

25|$|Iran and the United States {{have had}} a poor {{relationship}} since the Iranian Revolution and the Iran hostage crisis, and tensions continued during Obama's presidency due to {{issues such as the}} Iranian nuclear program and Iran's alleged sponsorship of terrorism. On taking office, Obama focused on negotiations with Iran over the status of its nuclear program, working with the other P5+1 powers to adopt a <b>multilateral</b> <b>agreement.</b> Obama's stance differed dramatically from the more hawkish position of his predecessor, George W. Bush, as well as the stated positions of most of Obama's rivals in the 2008 presidential campaign. In June 2013, Hasan Rouhani won election as the new President of Iran, and Rouhani called for a continuation of talks on Iran's nuclear program. In November 2013, Iran and the P5 announced an interim agreement, and in April 2015, negotiators announced that a framework agreement had been reached. Congressional Republicans, who along with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had strongly opposed the negotiations, attempted but failed to pass a Congressional resolution rejecting the six-nation accord. Under the agreement, Iran promised to limit its nuclear program and to provide access to International Atomic Energy Agency inspectors, while the U.S. and other countries agreed to reduce sanctions on Iran. The partisan fight over the Iran nuclear deal exemplified a broader ideological disagreement regarding American foreign policy in the Middle East and how to handle adversarial regimes, as many opponents of the deal considered Iran to be an implacably hostile adversary who would inevitably break any agreement.|$|E
2500|$|In his writings, Chomsky {{has drawn}} {{attention}} to globalization resistance movements. He described Zapatista defiance of NAFTA {{in his essay}} [...] "The Zapatista Uprising." [...] He also criticized the <b>Multilateral</b> <b>Agreement</b> on Investment, and reported on the activist efforts that led to its defeat.

2500|$|According to Chomsky, {{a primary}} ploy {{has been the}} co-opting of the global {{economic}} institutions established {{at the end of}} World War II, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank, which have increasingly adhered to the [...] "Washington Consensus", requiring developing countries to adhere to limits on spending and make structural adjustments that often involve cutbacks in social and welfare programs. IMF aid and loans are normally contingent upon such reforms. Chomsky claims that the construction of global institutions and agreements such as the World Trade Organization, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), and the <b>Multilateral</b> <b>Agreement</b> on Investment constitute new ways of securing élite privileges while undermining democracy.|$|E

The relations between these three fields will have to be looked into and subsequently the role of Switzerland will have to be made explicit by examining the positions of its representatives in the international organizations concerned.

Common targets include the World Bank (WB), International Monetary Fund (IMF), the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and the World Trade Organization (WTO) and free trade treaties like the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), Free Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA), the <b>Multilateral</b> <b>Agreement</b> on Investment (MAI) and the General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS).

5000|$|In the past, {{there have}} been several {{initiatives}} {{for the establishment of a}} more multilateral approach to international investment rulemaking. These attempts include the Havana Charter of 1948, the United Nations Draft Code of Conduct on Transnational Corporations in the 1980s, and the <b>Multilateral</b> <b>Agreement</b> on Investment (MAI) of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) in the 1990s. None of these initiatives reached successful conclusion, due to disagreements among countries and, in case of the MAI, also in light of strong opposition by civil society groups. Further attempts of advancing the process towards establishment of a <b>multilateral</b> <b>agreement</b> have since been made within the WTO, but also without success. Concerns have been raised regarding the specific objectives that such a <b>multilateral</b> <b>agreement</b> is meant to accomplish, who would benefit in what way from it, and what impact such a <b>multilateral</b> <b>agreement</b> would have on countries' broader public policies, including those related to environmental, social and other issues. Particularly developing countries may require [...] "policy space" [...] to develop their regulatory frameworks, such as in the area of economic or financial policies, and one major concern was that a <b>multilateral</b> <b>agreement</b> on investment would diminish such policy space. As a result, current international investment rulemaking remains short of having a unified system based on a <b>multilateral</b> <b>agreement.</b> In this respect, investment differs for example from trade and finance, as the WTO fulfills the purpose of creating a more unified global system for trade and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) plays a similar role with respect to the international financial system.|$|E
