5000|$|The Westbay MP {{system is}} a modular {{instrumentation}} system for multilevel groundwater monitoring acquired by Nova Metrix in 2015, the MP system consists of two parts: (1) the casing system and (2) portable probes and tools that provide a compatible data acquisition system. The Westbay casing system is designed to allow the monitoring of multiple discrete levels in a single borehole. The casing comes in two different sizes, the MP38 system (38 mm, 1.5-inch) and MP55 system (55 mm, 2.25-inch). [...] One single string of water-tight Westbay casing sections is installed in the borehole. Each desired <b>monitoring</b> <b>zone</b> has valved couplings and ports to access groundwater outside the casing and instruments inside the casing. Westbay packers or backfilled seals are used to seal the borehole between monitoring zones to prevent the unnatural vertical flow of groundwater in the wellbore and maintain the in situ distribution of fluid pressures and chemistry. The Westbay system can be installed in either open rock boreholes or cased wells with multiple screens. Systems have also been installed in backfilled boreholes. Specialized equipment and probes lowered down the casing to each port are used to monitor and collect samples from Westbay systems. This system can incorporate {{a large number of}} monitoring intervals because the system is entirely modular and does not require multiple tubes extending to the ground surface. Westbay MLS systems have been installed to a maximum depth of 7,128 feet. Additional information about the system is presented by Black et al. (1986) and Einarson (2006). More information is also available on the website.|$|E

40|$|AbstractSince non-negligible leakage {{rates from}} {{injection}} and storage zones are possible along wellbores, {{it is important}} to be able to diagnose whether leakage is occurring. We show that concurrent pressure and temperature measurements are especially valuable because they independently constrain the effective permeability of a leakage path along wellbore. We describe a set of coupled analytical models for identifying the characteristic features of wellbore leakage in above-zone monitoring data. Application to data from an observation well (EGL 7) during two years of steady CO 2 injection in Cranfield (Mississippi, USA) shows that the observed pressure elevation requires an extremely large leakage rate, and that this rate would be large enough to raise the temperature in the <b>monitoring</b> <b>zone</b> significantly.

The present study aimed to: (i) analyse the spatial and temporal dynamics of the olive fruit fly over a large olive growing area (Ormylia, Greece), and (ii) define a methodology to determine <b>monitoring</b> <b>zones</b> to optimize the monitoring effort over space and time in area-wide integrated pest management programmes.

40|$|A {{detailed}} three-dimensional {{numerical simulation}} of ground water {{flow into the}} screen of a monitoring well during ‘‘low-flow’ ’ purging and sampling provides a means to investigate the actual <b>monitoring</b> <b>zone</b> (i. e., ‘‘where the water comes from’’) achieved during these sampling operations. Such a simulation allows for examination {{of the influence of}} several var-iables such as pump placement, well screen and sand-pack configuration, and aquifer heterogeneities on the actual part of the aquifer that is interrogated. In these simulations, ground water was sampled from {{the entire length of the}} well screen, although as could be expected, flux was higher into the well screen from zones of higher permeability, if present. Further-more, at low flow rates, pump position within the screen had little influence on the vertical distribution of flux into the well, and in all cases where a monitoring well partially penetrates an aquifer, the zone monitored extended above and below the well screen. At the low flow rates examined (250 and 500 mL/min), there was no increase in flux (from the aquifer into the well screen) adjacent to the pump intake. The major implications of these findings are that a detection monitoring approach predicated on sampling from the entire well screen is valid when purging at low flow rates (i. e., contaminants are not ‘‘missed’’), or conversely, that discrete vertical sampling may only be accomplished with very short well screens due to potential concentration averaging that would occur along the entire length of a screen. Finally, the simulation results empha-size that aquifer heterogeneities must always be recognized and considered in ground water monitoring design. Aquifer heterogeneities have the most significant influence on the actual <b>monitoring</b> <b>zone</b> (and therefore the potential to ‘‘hit’ ’ or ‘‘miss’ ’ contaminants in a detection program). Pump placement and purging rate have little influence on the vertical interval that is sampled (as compared to screen length and placement) and therefore should be selected only so as to minimize sampling artifacts and promote sampling efficiency...|$|E

50|$|When {{constructing}} nested wells, attention {{must be paid}} {{to ensure}} the proper placement of sand in the screened intervals and bentonite between monitored intervals, by measuring {{the depth of the}} sand or bentonite frequently as the materials are being placed. However, if the seals are placed to the exact depths specified in the well design, riser casings that are touching due to de-centralization in the borehole inhibits seal placement between the risers and can allow for vertical movement of groundwater within the borehole between different <b>monitoring</b> <b>zones.</b> The likelihood of vertical leakage through the bentonite seals of a nested well increases with the number of separate casings within the borehole, or when only a small thickness of annular seal exists between the various <b>monitored</b> <b>zones.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Prior to the 1970s, {{collection}} of discrete groundwater samples from multiple depths in the subsurface required {{the installation of}} well clusters or nested wells [...] Well clusters consist of a closely spaced group of monitoring wells, each well completed to a different depth in individual boreholes. Well clusters were first used in the 1950s at contaminated sites. Because {{there is only one}} well screen in each borehole, there is little risk of vertical connection between zones. The individual wells in the cluster must be installed near one another (e.g., ≤10 ft. apart), so that the head data obtained from them is a result of variations in the vertical head and not horizontal gradients. Also, care must be taken to avoid installing clusters of wells with overlapping screens and sand packs - this may allow vertical movement of contamination between the wells in the presence of vertical hydraulic gradients. Installation of wells clusters can be expensive because of increased drilling costs associated with drilling multiple borings, especially in fractured rock. [...] Nested wells are wells constructed of two or more well screens and casing assemblies of different lengths installed in a single borehole. The key drawback of nested wells is that {{it can be difficult to}} effectively seal the portions of the borehole between the <b>monitored</b> <b>zones.</b> Nested wells were popular in the 1970s but many seal failures occurred. For this reason, nested wells are discouraged or prohibited in many areas. [...] There are typically three separate monitoring intervals in nested wells, although more monitoring intervals have been constructed in very deep monitoring wells. The risk of hydraulically connecting the various <b>monitoring</b> <b>zones</b> is inversely proportional to the thickness of the seals between the monitoring intervals. Thus, shallow nested wells with many <b>monitoring</b> <b>zones</b> are more at risk of hydraulic failure than deep nested wells with fewer <b>monitoring</b> <b>zones.</b>|$|R

40|$|AbstractThere {{are several}} {{monitoring}} challenges to demonstrate safe {{and long term}} storage of the CO 2. In this study a methodology is proposed that uses well known interference well testing for monitoring the Above Zone Monitoring Intervals (AZMI). Advantages of this method are: (1) It helps {{to distinguish between the}} brine and CO 2 leakage; (2) It can be used to detect low rate/ long term leakages that may not have a noticeable pressure signal as leakage starts and (3) It is designed in a time-lapse form so inherently many uncertain reservoir parameters cancel out in the calculations. Proposed methodology works on the premises of the fact that at any given depth brine and CO 2 have different compressibility. This means that in a <b>monitoring</b> <b>zone</b> initially filled with brine any leakage of CO 2 will change the total compressibility of the zone. If we assume that the fluids within the area of investigation have not been changed then calculated transmissibility and storativity should remain reasonably constant in repetitive tests. Results based on synthetic simulation models shows that this method can be used to detect CO 2 leaks successfully. A generalized equation introduced here {{that can be used to}} estimate leak size for any given reservoir. Finally this new method applied to an actual reservoir model and showed that leak size can be determined with ±% 15 error...|$|E

In this context, as key geomorphological agents, riparian trees are particularly important in trapping sediment and constructing distinct landforms, which subsequently evolve to larger ones. The primary objective {{of this paper is}} to experimentally investigate the scour/deposition patterns around different forms of individual vegetation elements. Flume experiments were conducted in which the scour patterns around different representative forms of individual in-stream obstructions (solid cylinder, hexagonal array of circular cylinders, several forms of emergent and submerged vegetation) were monitored by means of a high-resolution laser scanner. The three dimensional scour geometry around the simulated vegetation elements was quantified and discussed based on the introduced dimensionless morphometric characteristics. The findings reveal that the intact vegetation forms generated two elongated scour holes at the downstream with a pronounced ridge. For the impermeable form of the plant, the scour got localized, more deposition was detected within the <b>monitoring</b> <b>zone,</b> and the distance between the obstruction and deposition zone became shorter. It is also shown that with the effect of bending and the subsequent decrease of the projected area of the plant and the increase of bulk volume, the characteristic scour values decrease compared to the intact version, and the scour zone obtains a more elongated form and expands in the downstream direction...|$|E

This article considered Amdo, Baingoin, Coqen, and Zhongba counties in Tibet as the study areas, employed remote-sensing data, and developed Tibetan grassland desertification classification indices based on field surveys. Moreover, this study used spectral mixture analysis (SMA) methods to interpret remote-sensing image data from the study areas during three periods (1990, 2000, and 2009) and considered the bare sand (gravel) area proportion as the main basis {{for the evaluation of}} grassland desertification.

At Site 1173, formation pressures rose by 1.0 – 1.5 kPa {{at the time of the}} largest earthquake (Mw = 7.5), then continued to rise to a total anomaly of 4 kPa during the following 200 – 300 days. These transients are inferred to reflect co-seismic and slow continuing volumetric contraction of the plate by amounts of roughly 0.2 × 10 − 6 and 0.5 × 10 − 6, respectively. The sign of the estimated strain is consistent with that predicted with a seismic-moment-constrained elastic half-space dislocation model, but the amplitude is much larger, by roughly a factor of 6 at the time of the main earthquake, and by nearly a factor of 20 when the total pressure-estimated strain at the end of the post-seismic period is compared to that estimated from the total cumulative seismic moment including aftershocks. The simplest inference that can be drawn is that a large component of aseismic slip occurred in the epicentral area. At Site 808, pressure at the deepest <b>monitoring</b> <b>zone</b> just above the subduction decollement fell at the time of the largest earthquakes. This may reflect shear-induced dilatation which would be consistent with strain-or velocity-hardening behaviour along this seaward-most part of the subduction thrust interface.|$|E

At present, two morphologically-distinguished depressions are observed along the two most dredged areas of this sandbank: one in the central; and one {{in the northern part of}} the bank. In order to limit the impact of sand extraction on the bathymetry, the central depression of the Kwinte Bank was closed for exploitation, in February 2003. An understanding of the morphological evolution of this central depression is based upon data obtained: (a) from November 1999, until the closure for extraction in February 2003; and (b) on the subsequent post-dredging evolution, until June 2005. During this 5 -year period, a total of 17 surveys were carried out with a multibeam echosounder over the area of the central depression (KBMA) and over a reference zone on an adjacent non-exploited sandbank. The resulting time-series of bathymetrical digital terrain models, together with backscatter strength maps, permit a detailed comparison of the bathy-morphological and sedimentary evolution of both of the monitored areas.

We now have greater potential than ever before to introduce disturbance and deplete marine resources. Two of the issues currently under public scrutiny are the exploitation of fish stocks worldwide and levels of anthropogenic noise in the marine environment. The aim of this thesis is to investigate and develop novel analyses and simulations to provide additional insight {{into some of the}} challenges facing the marine ecosystem today. These methodologies will improve the management of these risks to marine ecosystems. This thesis first addresses the issue of competition between humans and grey seals (Halichoerus grypus) for marine resources, providing compelling evidence that a substantial proportion of the sandeels consumed by grey seals in the North Sea are in fact H. lanceolatus, which is not commercially exploited, rather than the commercially important A. marinus. In addition, we present quantitative results regarding sources of bias when estimating the total biomass of sandeels consumed by grey seals. Secondly, we investigate spatially adaptive 2 -dimensional smoothing to improve the prediction of both the presence and density of marine species, information that is often key in the management of marine ecosystems. Particularly, we demonstrate the benefits of such methods in the prediction of sandeel occurrence. Lastly this thesis provides a quantitative assessment of the protocols for real-time monitoring of marine mammal presence, which require that acoustic operations cease when an animal is detected within a certain distance (i. e. the "monitoring zone") of the sound source. We assess monitoring zones of different sizes with regards to their effectiveness in reducing the risks of temporary and permanent damage to the animals' hearing, and demonstrate that a <b>monitoring</b> <b>zone</b> of 2 km is generally recommendable...|$|E
40|$|The {{main goal}} of this thesis is to propose a new {{monitoring}} technique for traditional distribution system with integration of renewable energy source. The traditional distribution network is primarily composed of radial feeders, designed for unidirectional power flow. Therefore, many operation regulation, protection and control system, in distribution network, {{are based on the}} radial distribution systems assumption. The high penetration of the renewable energy sources, will clearly impact the distribution systems operation. Unlike other ways of electricity generation renewable energies initiate some challenges for grid operation. Intermittency of renewable energies sources, power system protection, stability, security, economic dispatch, optimal power flow are critical issues initiated by renewable energies penetration to power systems. In addition, the renewable energy source output may exceed the consumed power during the day. Therefore, the direction of the power flow can be reversed during some periods. The high penetration of decentralized renewable sources will create a multidirectional power flow condition in the distribution grid, which was originally designed for unidirectional power flow only. Following of this reverse power flow, the distribution feeder voltage rises. In this thesis the necessity of online monitoring system for important feeders in distribution system will be shown. It will be shown that the apparent impedance measured on the feeder has great capabilities for on line monitoring of distribution feeder. The thesis establishes the steady-state mathematical model for defining the <b>monitoring</b> <b>zone</b> in R-X plane as the main contribution.

Thus, {{a better understanding of the}} spatial and temporal distribution of water as a consequence of different tillage methods is needed. The distribution of soil water content is basically studied thanks to soil moisture sensors such as time domain reflectometry (TDR) probes. However, this method requires the disturbance of the soil and only provides local information. Comparatively, electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) slightly alters the soil structure. It has been considered as a proxy to assess the spatial and temporal variability of the soil water content. This study aims at assessing whether and to which extent the crop residue management influences soil water dynamics and the water availability for maize. Water content will be monitored from March to October 2014, under three crop residue managements: conventional tillage realized in the end of autumn, conventional tillage realized just before sowing, and strip tillage. A bare soil under conventional tillage will also be monitored so as to better understand the influence of the plant over the growing season. So as to better understand the dynamics of water in the soil-water-continuum, the influence of the crop residue management on the soil structure and the plant development will also be investigated. The soil water pattern will be daily monitored on a surface of two square meters through surface stainless steel electrodes, corresponding to three rows of seven maize plants. Five additional sticks with buried electrodes will be setup to get more detailed information near to the maize row. For each of the monitored zone, two TDR probes will help validating the data.

In addition, the UNSC increased UNPROFOR's authorized strength to <b>monitor</b> weapons exclusion <b>zones,</b> but never actually altered the operation's mandate.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the late}} 1990s, Murray Einarson, working for Precision Sampling, Inc. in California, {{developed}} a continuous multichannel tubing (CMT) system for monitoring {{up to seven}} different zones in the subsurface. Development and testing of the CMT system {{was the focus of}} Einarson's MSc thesis at the University of Waterloo. [...] The CMT system consists a continuous length of polyethylene tubing that has seven internal channels or lumens. Custom-designed <b>monitoring</b> <b>zones</b> are created on site by cutting ports into the various channels at specific depths. The CMT MLS is commercially available from Solinst Canada.|$|R
5000|$|Multi-screen casing completion: the MLS is {{installed}} {{inside of a}} multi-screened steel or PVC well. Each well screen segment has a sand or gravel pack {{between it and the}} borehole wall, and is thus isolated from <b>monitoring</b> <b>zones</b> above and below by a grout or bentonite seal. The MLS is then constructed inside of the multi-screened well. This adds another step to the well installation process (i.e., first installing a multi-screened well), but has several advantages. First, installing conventional steel or PVC wells is straightforward and routine for most drilling contractors. Consequently, it is not necessary that the drilling contractor have expertise in installing multilevel monitoring systems. Once the multi-screened wells have been installed and developed, the drilling contractor's job is done, and the multilevel systems can often be installed by field technicians, often at a lower cost. Second, the various <b>monitoring</b> <b>zones</b> can be developed using standard well development equipment and procedures before the multilevel monitoring systems are installed in the wells. Finally, installing multilevel systems inside multi-screened wells may simplify the task of decommissioning the wells once they are no longer needed. Most of the multilevel systems can be constructed {{so that they can be}} easily removed from the multi-screened wells. Then, the multi-screened wells can be pressure-grouted or drilled out using standard well decommissioning procedures.|$|R
