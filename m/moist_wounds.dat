40|$|The {{effect of}} moist and dry {{conditions}} {{on the process of}} angiogenesis during dermal repair was investigated. The moist conditions were achieved by covering excised wounds on porcine flank skin with the adhesive polyurethane dressing Opsite and dry conditions were achieved by exposure to air through dry gauze dressings. Angiogenesis was assessed during the period from 3 to 60 d after injury. Quantitative studies, using computerized image analysis, were carried out on microfocal x-ray images of skin sections whose blood system had been perfused in vivo with a radio-opaque medium. The analytical technique yielded information with regard to vessel number per wound and also the area occupied by blood vessels per unit wound area. Three regions were assessed in each wound bed: upper zone, just {{below the surface of the}} wound; the lower zone, just above the base of the wound bed; and the middle zone, midway between the other two zones. The results showed that the wounds maintained in a moist environment revascularized at a greater rate than those maintained in a dry environment. This was apparent in all the zones of the wound bed examined. The development of new vessels occurred in a more orderly manner in the <b>moist</b> <b>wounds.</b> There was an early increase in vessel number rising to a peak around days 3 – 5, then a gradual decrease in number starting around day 7. In contrast, in the dry wounds the development of blood vessels was less rapid. Peak vessel number in the upper zone was significantly less than that achieved in the <b>moist</b> <b>wounds,</b> and was not reached until 7 d after injury. The decrease in vessel number from the peak was less rapid in the dry wounds, suggesting that there was a delayed entry into the remodeling phase in comparison with the <b>moist</b> <b>wounds.</b> The results also showed that the total percentage area of the wound bed occupied by blood vessels was greater in the <b>moist</b> <b>wounds</b> than the dry wounds from 3 d after injury until day 7. This level of vascularization was maintained beyond 7 d after injury even when the vessel number in the <b>moist</b> <b>wounds</b> was significantly less than in the dry wounds, suggesting that the vessels in the <b>moist</b> <b>wounds</b> were larger and, presumably, more mature. In general, <b>moist</b> <b>wounds</b> showed a more rapid decline towards uninjured skin levels of vascularization than dry wounds...|$|E

The number of inflammatory phase cells (neutrophils and macrophages) decreased more rapidly under moist conditions than under dry conditions.

Winter formed multiple partial thickness wounds on the backs of pigs, half left open to the air and half covered with a polymer film to keep them hydrated. The latter wounds healed faster, as measured by the migration of new epithelium on the wound bed. This work began the evolution of modern wound dressings that promote <b>moist</b> <b>wound</b> healing.|$|R

40|$|Balancing skin {{hydration}} {{levels is}} important as any disruption in skin integrity {{will result in}} disturbance of the dermal water balance. The discovery that a <b>moist</b> <b>wound</b> healing environment actively supports the healing response when compared to a dry environment {{highlights the importance of}} water and good hydration levels for optimal wound healing. The benefits of “wet” or “hyper-hydrated” wound healing appears to offer benefits that are similar to those offered by <b>moist</b> <b>wound</b> healing over wounds healing in a dry environment. This suggests that the presence of free water itself during wound healing may not be detrimental to healing but that any adverse effects of wound fluid on tissues is more likely related to the biological components contained within chronic wound exudate (e. g. elevated protease levels). Appropriate dressings applied to wounds must be able to absorb not only the exudate but also retain this excess fluid together with its protease solutes while concurrently preventing desiccation. This is particularly important in the case of chronic wounds where peri-wound skin barrier properties are compromised and there is increased permeation across the injured skin barrier.

This article explores the healing properties of sterilised honey in the management of chronic leg ulcers. The anti-inflammatory effects of honey can help to resolve both acute and chronic inflammation often found in static, non-healing wounds. The agent responsible for this is a very weak solution of hydrogen peroxide, designed to protect the honeycomb from decay. Honey also has an anti- inflammatory effect because of its high osmolarity. This causes an outflow of fluid, helping to reduce oedema and pain. This action has the added benefit of creating a <b>moist</b> <b>wound</b> environment.
