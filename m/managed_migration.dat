40|$|Background: In 2008 South Africa (SA) had 1631 {{registered}} advanced {{life support}} (ALS) paramedics to provide pre-hospital advanced life support care to {{a population of}} approximately 50 million. Compared to globally accepted ratios, the number of ALS paramedics in South Africa {{can be considered as}} grossly inadequate. This current shortage may be ascribed to migration. However, the extent and nature of this migration, the factors that have contributed to them leaving the country and the existence or effectiveness of implemented strategies that attempt to <b>manage</b> <b>migration</b> of SA ALS paramedic is not known for sure. Methods: The study consisted of a two-phase mixed method descriptive survey. A subset of SA ALS paramedics made up the study population. Quantitative data (Phase One) was obtained from a web-based survey distributed to the accessible population (N =  97). Thereafter, qualitative data (Phase Two) was gathered through in-depth interviews with selected information rich participants (n =  10) also from within the accessible population. Through methodological triangulation, data from Phase One and Phase Two were integrated to obtain an in-depth understanding of South African ALS paramedic migration. In addition, the study investigated whether strategies that attempted to <b>manage</b> <b>migration</b> of SA ALS paramedics existed, and if they did, how effective have they been. Result: Fifty-one of 97 (53 %) ALS paramedics responded to the questionnaire in Phase One. Of those, 24 (47. 1 %) were found to be working inside South Africa, while 27 (52. 9 %) were working outside South Africa. Working conditions, physical security, and economic considerations were ranked as the top three major factors contributing to the decision or intended decision to migrate. Initiatives to manage the shortage of ALS paramedics in the public sector EMS do exist; however, it appears to be inadequate at its current rate of progress. Conclusion: This study suggests that ALS paramedics in SA are leaving to find work outside the country because of working conditions, physical security, and economic considerations. The current measures to <b>manage</b> <b>migration</b> appear to be ineffective, indicating that new or additional strategies to <b>manage</b> <b>migration</b> of ALS paramedics in SA may be required...|$|R

50|$|In the Western world, the {{employment}} of migrant domestic workers differs from the predominant hiring and recruiting trends in the East. In Europe, migration has followed a pattern from East to West, that is from Eastern Europe to Western, Southern and Northern Europe and from South to North, from Latin America, Asia and Africa to the EU countries. The demand for migrant domestic workers has been credited to the welfare system of these countries. In order to enable female nationals to ‘reconcile’ care work and a working life, some European states have installed a quota system for the recruitment of domestic workers (Spain, Italy, Greece), which allows employers to recruit workers from abroad under specific criteria, or they have opened their borders to these workers (Britain and Ireland with the domestic worker visa). Others, such as Germany, the Nordic States, and the Netherlands, have hardly acknowledged the need for migrant domestic workers, let alone included this need in their <b>managed</b> <b>migration</b> policies. United States and Canada have adopted migrant programs such as Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 IRCA and Live-In Caregiver program, respectively, {{in order to facilitate}} {{the employment}} of migrant domestic workers.|$|E
40|$|The United Kingdom, {{like many}} {{developed}} world economies, has witnessed unprecedented immigration {{since the early}} 1990 s.

In terms of the latter, the paper argues that six policy filters (legal, geographical, credential, transfer-based, monetary, and humanitarian) are commonly used to determine legitimate forms of migration but that one (the geographical filter) has been particularly prominent within the UK's <b>managed</b> <b>migration</b> policy paradigm...|$|E

40|$|Since {{the early}} 1990 s, the Chinese {{government}} replaced strict control over outmigration with measures of ‘infrastructural governance’. Instead of dictating who can and who cannot leave, the state <b>manages</b> <b>migration</b> by influencing the sociotechnical conditions of mobility, for instance by defining what responsibilities commercial intermediaries should shoulder and what training a migrant should receive before departure. This article unpacks infrastructural governance {{by examining the}} working of ‘base’, or jidi in Chinese. A base is a tight cluster {{of public and private}} institutions in a labour source place, designated by the government as an important player in the recruitment of migrant workers. The base <b>manages</b> <b>migration</b> by conditioning the activities that lead to migration, such as how people choose destinations, make payments, and deal with uncertainties in preparing for migration. The base also works on migrants’ relations with family members, village cadres and fellow migrants in order to shape their mobilities. The ethnographic research on the base shows that, infrastructural governance regulates migration effectively, but makes migration more complicated and more costly for the migrants. Infrastructural governance empowers commercial intermediaries and local government, and as such affects broader social relations in the community...|$|R

40|$|What can {{the case}} of {{temporary}} labor migration regulation {{tell us about the}} rule of law and administrative justice from managed to neoliberal capitalism in the United States? This paper demonstrates how the enforcement of temporary migrant labor contracts from state-led economic planning into a market-driven order (1942 - 2011) challenges dominant understandings of economic rights in jurisprudential theory and histories of the American administrative state. Contrary to existing conceptualizations of the managed capitalist state as a rights-abrogator, I show how regulatory agencies created and backed private contracts (1942 - 64). I subsequently trace what happened to this legal form through the roll-back of <b>managed</b> <b>migration</b> in the post- 1964 period. Counterintuitively, from the perspective of temporary labor migration, neoliberalism is not about the strengthening of private contract, but contract's changing form in kind and process. Through the retreat of <b>managed</b> <b>migration,</b> private contracts are deformalized and subsumed to a fragmented, "bottom-up" administrative justice, empowering employers in the legal process...|$|E

40|$|Periods of low {{precipitation}} {{and increasing}} atmospheric temperature are having {{adverse effects on}} tree and forest growth and survival in part via limitations upon photosynthesis. Understanding how different species and plant functional types will physiologically respond to the combination of drought and heat is therefore critical for modeling and predicting the fate of trees and forests under future climate conditions. In addition, climate is changing at a faster pace than the slow natural adjustment rates of most species to their rapidly shifting habitat conditions, especially for long-lived tree species, which poses a major challenge for management, conservation, and preservation strategies and policies. Therefore the current traditional conservation/preservation methods, such as providing migration corridors and increasing suitable habitat at range margins {{will need to be}} supplemented with a more direct, innovative, and adaptive approach. One such approach is that of <b>managed</b> <b>migration,</b> which is the intentional translocation of species outside their current habitat in order to reduce anticipated loss of biodiversity caused by climate change related stress. This dissertation addresses these problems through the experimental examination of heat, drought, and the combination of heat and drought on two conifer species that have differing drought tolerances, which can serve as global models for a range of physiological mechanisms to deal with water and heat stress, as well as a social science investigation into the preservation of an iconic conifer tree, the coast redwood into Oregon via <b>managed</b> <b>migration...</b>|$|E

40|$|In this paper, I explore {{similarities}} and differences between the first major scheme to rely on migrants from Central and Eastern Europe to fill vacancies in key sectors of the British economy - the so-called European Volunteer Worker (EVW) schemes introduced in 1946 - and current economic migration from the same countries of origin, following the expansion of the EU in 2004. The first scheme was in part a response to postwar dislocation in Europe and the huge problem of displaced peoples. However, the recruits were admitted to the UK as economic migrants rather than as refugees and had to accept allocation to particular sectors of employment as a condition of entry. In the period since 2004, large numbers of migrants from similar parts of Europe have been recruited to work in the UK, largely in low-wage sectors, and in the most recent version of New Labour's <b>managed</b> <b>migration</b> policy are seen as replacements for low-skilled migrants from other regions of the world. Both the early and later groups are white, raising interesting questions about the social construction and meaning of 'whiteness' and its status as a marker of privilege in the UK.
