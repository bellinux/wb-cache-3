Recent studies found that the ChemoClave system protects clinicians from exposure to hazardous drugs, increases clinician satisfaction rates, costs less and generates less biohazardous waste than other commercially available CSTDs. In 2012, the company introduced the Diana Hazardous drug compounding system, a user-controlled automated system that helps protect clinicians from exposure to hazardous drugs and accidental needlesticks while protecting the patient preparation from exposure to environmental contaminants.|$|R

25|$|In {{the year}} 1978, the Imperial Cancer Research Fund (ICRF) - a major charity {{supporting}} cancer {{research in the}} United Kingdom at the time, decided to provide an £800,000 endowment to support creation of a Chair of <b>Medical</b> <b>Oncology</b> in the Faculty of Medicine in Edinburgh. Following an open competition, the University of Edinburgh appointed John F. Smyth (at the time a senior lecturer in <b>medical</b> <b>oncology</b> at the Institute of Cancer Research in London) for that position on 1 April 1979. After a short visit to the University of Chicago, professor Smyth assumed his duties in Edinburgh on 1 October 1979 (a date that {{can be considered as}} the beginning of the Centre). Soon afterwards, additional posts were provided by the University and matched by appropriate staff positions by Lothian Health Board (NHS) to create first clinical service for <b>medical</b> <b>oncology</b> in Edinburgh. The service was based in the Western General Hospital where some beds and out-patient facilities were provided. In 1980 it was formally recognized as the Imperial Cancer Research Fund <b>Medical</b> <b>Oncology</b> Unit in Edinburgh with professor John Smyth as its director. This resulted in additional funding that allowed building of a small research laboratory which was commissioned in 1981. The laboratory was located in a portable cabin on the Western General Hospital campus. The main focus of the Unit was the development of more successful drug therapies for all forms of cancer and looking for new ways of reducing the side-effects of anti-cancer drugs. With generous support from Imperial Cancer Research Fund and other organisations, the Unit was steadily growing enabling clinical trials for promising anticancer therapeutics. For example, the Unit was responsible for the very first clinical trial of a 5-HT3 receptor antagonist, heralding in the dramatic changes in emesis control that subsequently followed the development of that class of compounds. In 1984 the Unit moved to a new location at {{the top floor of the}} MRC Human Genetics Unit building which allowed for expansion of laboratory research activities. After a successful ICRF review in 1996, it had been recognized that further extension of scientific activities of the Unit required even more space and prof. Smyth obtained permission to rise funds to create a new purpose designed building. The work started in 2000 and the new £7M building was officially opened in 2002 by The Princess Royal. It provides 3000 square meters of gross internal space and is a current base for majority of ECRC researchers. At that time (in 2002), following reorganisation of faculties into schools within the University of Edinburgh, the name Edinburgh Cancer Research Centre was created and used with reference to the Unit and the new building. In 2004 the successor of ICRF, Cancer Research UK, also started to refer to the Unit as the CRUK Clinical Cancer Centre to emphasize its status as a comprehensive cancer centre. In 2007 ECRC became part of the Institute of Genetics and Molecular Medicine. In 2010, following a successful bid, ECRC has been formally recognized as Cancer Research UK Centre and is known as Edinburgh Cancer Research UK Centre.|$|E

500|$|The role of {{radiotherapy}} as {{an auxiliary}} (adjuvant) treatment after potentially curative surgery has been controversial since the 1980s.

Dr David Grimes, a cancer researcher at Oxford University, told ‘This Morning’: [...] "It’s not just untrue, it’s patronising and victim blaming, cancer is bad luck... the healthiest people in the world get cancer and it’s not because they are negative". Prof. John Gribben, Chair of <b>Medical</b> <b>Oncology</b> at Queen Mary University of London, said: “This is complete gibberish and undermines all the good work everyone does with evidence-based medicine and targeted approaches". Prof. Edzard Ernst, Emeritus Professor at the University Of Exeter said “The reason why most of us put ‘negative energy’ in inverted commas is simple: it is a pure figment of the imagination of fantasists. That would not be so bad except that, as we see, some VIPs seem to take this nonsense seriously. The result might be that some desperate patients believe them, and choose the nonsense over the best that real medicine has to offer. And that could hasten deaths.” ...|$|E
