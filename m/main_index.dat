25|$|On August 2, 2010, the TSE <b>main</b> <b>index</b> (TEPIX) {{reached a}} record level of 16,056 points, despite US-sponsored {{sanctions}} against Iran. Thus, TEDPIX became the world’s second-best performing equity index. Factors {{such as the}} global spike in oil and metal prices, government support for industries and oil sectors {{as well as the}} growth of stock market liquidity flow contributed to the boom. Experts commented that the growth was also partly due to a government decision to sell off 20 percent of its equity in two major automakers. Given the relative low market valuation of TSE stocks in 2010, the upward trend was expected to continue over the long run, rather than being a bubble. TEPIX reached a new record on September 18, 2010, when it hit 18,658, up from 11,295 {{at the start of the}} year. As of December 2010, the TSE index rose about 64 percent since the start of 2010.

6000|$|This is by {{no means}} an {{impossible}} demand. The total population of the world is, on the most generous estimate, not more than 1,500,000,000, and the effectual indexing of this number of people, the record of their movement hither and thither, the entry of various material facts, such as marriage, parentage, criminal convictions and the like, the entry of the new-born and the elimination of the dead, colossal task though it would be, is still not so great as to be immeasurably beyond comparison with the work of the post-offices in the world of to-day, or the cataloguing of such libraries as that of the British Museum, or such collections as that of the insects in Cromwell Road. Such an index could be housed quite comfortably on one side of Northumberland Avenue, for example. It is only a reasonable tribute to the distinctive lucidity of the French mind to suppose the central index housed in a vast series of buildings at or near Paris. The index would be classified primarily by some unchanging physical characteristic, such as we are told the thumb-mark and finger-mark afford, and to these would be added any other physical traits that were of material value. The classification of thumb-marks and of inalterable physical characteristics goes on steadily, and there is every reason for assuming it possible that each human being could be given a distinct formula, a number or [...] "scientific name," [...] under which he or she could be docketed. [Footnote: It is quite possible that the actual thumb-mark may play only a small part in the work of identification, but it is an obvious convenience to our thread of story to assume that it is the one sufficient feature.] About the buildings in which this great <b>main</b> <b>index</b> would be gathered, would be a system of other indices with cross references to the main one, arranged under names, under professional qualifications, under diseases, crimes and the like.|$|E

30|$|In this paper, {{land use}} policy and {{agricultural}} water management were analyzed in Africa {{within the past}} half of century. Number of 18 <b>indices</b> (as the <b>main</b> and sub-main <b>indices)</b> were selected to assess land use policy and agricultural water management based on their importance and other indices were not studied {{due to lack of}} adequate data. The changes of the <b>main</b> <b>indices</b> in 2011 showed that they had similar values in some regions and had very different values in other regions due to nature of the indices and conditions of the countries. In the next step, the land use policy index was estimated using the other <b>main</b> <b>indices.</b> Using the obtained functions, not only the mentioned index in any year (with a relative error < 20  %) was estimated, but also the importance of each index for every region was assessed. In addition, the amount of changes of the land use policy index for increase or decrease of each index in future years was predicted. The prioritization of the <b>main</b> <b>indices</b> showed that permanent crops to cultivated area, HDI, and value added to GDP by agriculture significantly affect the estimation of the land use policy index. The classification of the countries based on the <b>main</b> <b>indices</b> showed that Egypt had a better desirability of condition for land use policy and agricultural water management than the other countries. Evaluation of the trend of the <b>main</b> <b>indices</b> shows that increasing slope of land use policy index (due to decrease of rural development, labour force and value added to GDP by agriculture) was less than increasing slope of HDI and even water deficit (difference between NRI and irrigation water requirement) did not encourage governments and/or farmers for considerable increase in irrigation systems. Study of the sub-main indices showed that although status of pressurized irrigation was increasing, value of conservation agriculture area was not desirable. The results indicated that try and error policies should be avoided and expert comments be applied to the irrigation systems for any crop. The analysis of land use policy and agricultural water management for Africa in the past half of century provided a list of strengths and weaknesses. However, the only way to meet sustainable development is use of the past experiences to view bright horizons for future of land use policy and agricultural water management.|$|R
