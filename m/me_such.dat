25|$|I {{have been}} a Catholic and an infidel; I {{have been a}} Roman priest and a hypocrite; I have been a profligate under a cowl. I am that Father Achilli, who as early as 1826, was {{deprived}} of my faculty to lecture, for an offence which my superiors {{did their best to}} conceal; and who in 1827 had already earned the reputation of a scandalous friar. I am that Achilli, who in the diocese of Viterbo in February, 1831, robbed of her honour a young women of eighteen; who in September 1833, was found guilty of a second such crime, {{in the case of a}} person of twenty-eight; and who perpetrated a third in July, 1834, in the case of another aged twenty-four. I am he, who afterwards was found guilty of sins, similar or worse, in other towns of the neighbourhood. I am that son of St. Dominic who is known to have repeated the offence at Capua, in 1834 or 1835; and at Naples again, in 1840, in the case of a child of fiteen. I am he who chose the sacristy of the church for one of these crimes, and Good Friday for another. Look on me, ye mothers of England, a confessor against Popery, for ye 'ne'er may look upon my like again.' I am that veritable priest, who, after all this, began to speak against, not only the Catholic faith, but the moral law, and perverted others by my teaching. I am the Cavaliere Achilli, who then went to Corfu, made the wife of a tailor faithless to her husband, and lived publicly and travelled about with the wife of a chorus-singer. I am that Professor of the Protestant College at Malta, who with two others was dismissed from my post for offences which the authorities cannot get themselves to describe. And now attend to <b>me,</b> <b>such</b> as I am, and you shall see what you shall see about the barbarity and profligacy of the Inquisitors of Rome.|$|E

500|$|Of Rambles, Mary Shelley {{wrote to}} her friend Leigh Hunt: [...] "It seems to <b>me</b> <b>such</b> a wretched piece of work, written {{much of it in}} a state of pain that makes me look at its pages now as if written in a dream." [...] She disliked the work, {{describing}} it variously as [...] "a poor affair" [...] and [...] "my poor book", and claimed that Gatteschi had written the best parts. There are no statistics on the sales of the book, but it received at least seventeen reviews. In general, the reviews were favourable; as Moskal explains, [...] "with nationalist movements simmering in Europe, to culminate in the revolutions of 1848, reviewers took Rambles seriously as a political as well as a literary endeavour." ...|$|E
500|$|In April 1893 Busoni {{was present}} at the Berlin premiere of Giuseppe Verdi's opera Falstaff. The result was to force on him a re-evaluation of the {{potential}} of Italian musical traditions which he had so far ignored in favour of the German traditions, and in [...] particular the models of Johannes Brahms and the orchestral techniques of Liszt and Richard Wagner. He immediately began to draft an adulatory letter to Verdi (which he never summoned the courage to send), in which he addressed him as [...] "Italy's leading composer" [...] and [...] "one of the noblest persons of our time", and in which he explained that [...] "Falstaff provoked in <b>me</b> <b>such</b> a revolution of spirit that I can... date {{the beginning of a new}} epoch in my artistic life from that time." ...|$|E
500|$|Meanwhile, Kenneth is {{throwing}} his rule-filled [...] "Secret Santa Fun Swap", {{much to the}} writers' chagrin. Frank, Toofer, and Lutz proclaim they are strict adherents of [...] "Verdukianism," [...] a religion they make up on the spot, and have Kenneth give them things they claim to need for [...] "Merlinpeen," [...] the Verdukian Holiday of Mouth Pleasures (such as meat-lover's pizza and having their teeth flossed by a blonde virgin). Their famous holiday song is, [...] "Oh, Meatbowl of Verduke, you bring <b>me</b> <b>such</b> pizza. Meatbowl." [...] When Tracy Jordan (Tracy Morgan) tells Kenneth that they made up their religion, he goes into shock {{at the idea that}} all religions are made up by man. His faith is restored when the three are arrested for the bomb threat Liz called in, using their phone.|$|E

However, the tweet was shortly deleted and replaced with another clarifying that more information will be given on September 13. In an interview with iHeartRadio at their annual music festival in September, Rihanna confirmed [...] "Diamonds" [...] as her new single and {{said that it would}} first be played on American radio beginning September 26. She described it as an easy-going, but optimistic song that is [...] "happy and hippy" [...] rather than dance-oriented and said that the song [...] "gives <b>me</b> <b>such</b> a great feeling when I listen to it. The lyrics are very hopeful and positive, but it's about love." ...|$|E
500|$|After Frittie's death, Alice {{attached}} herself {{more closely}} to her only surviving son, Ernest, and her newborn daughter Marie. In 1875 she resumed her public duties, including fund-raising, medical and social work, which had always held her interest. She maintained active correspondence with the social reformer Octavia Hill. However, in these years, relations with her husband deteriorated. In late 1876, she travelled to England for treatment due to an internal complaint caused by a backward curvature of the womb, and remained at Balmoral while she recovered. From Balmoral, she wrote to her husband criticising the childishness of his letters: [...] "f my children wrote <b>me</b> <b>such</b> childish letters – only short accounts – of where and what they had eaten or {{where they had been}} etc., and no opinions, observations and remarks, I should be surprised – and how much more so when you write like that!" [...] On 3 October 1876, she wrote another despairing letter to Louis: ...|$|E
500|$|At {{the end of}} the Heimskringla saga Hákonar saga góða, {{the poem}} Hákonarmál (by the 10th century skald Eyvindr skáldaspillir) is presented. The saga relates that king Haakon I of Norway died in battle, and yet though he is Christian, he {{requests}} that since he has died [...] "among heathens, then give <b>me</b> <b>such</b> burial place as seems most fitting to you." [...] The saga relates that, shortly after, Haakon died on the same slab of rock that he was born upon, that he was greatly mourned by friend and foe alike, and that his friends moved his body northward to Sæheim in North Hordaland. Haakon was there buried in a large burial mound in full armor and his finest clothing, yet with no other valuables. Further, [...] "words were spoken over his grave according to the custom of heathen men, and they put him on the way to Valhalla." [...] The poem Hákonarmál is then provided.|$|E

500|$|A Sixth Army report {{indicated}} that the raid demonstrated [...] "...what patrols can accomplish in enemy territory by following {{the basic principles of}} scouting and patrolling, 'sneaking and peeping,' [...] use of concealment, reconnaissance of routes from photographs and maps prior to the actual operation, ... and the coordination of all arms in the accomplishment of a mission." [...] MacArthur spoke about his reaction to the raid: [...] "No incident of the campaign in the Pacific has given <b>me</b> <b>such</b> satisfaction as the release of the POWs at Cabanatuan. The mission was brilliantly successful." [...] He presented awards to the soldiers who participated in the raid on March3, 1945. Although Mucci was nominated for the Medal of Honor, he and Prince both received Distinguished Service Crosses. Mucci was promoted to colonel and was given command of the 1st Regiment of the 6th Infantry Division. All other American officers and selected enlisted received Silver Stars. The remaining American enlisted men and the Filipino guerrilla officers were awarded Bronze Stars. Nellist, Rounsaville, and the other twelve Scouts received Presidential Unit Citations.|$|E
500|$|Billingsley's {{generosity}} was {{not confined}} {{to those who were}} always at the club. [...] He received the following letter in 1955: [...] "I am grateful to you for your thoughtful kindness in sending <b>me</b> <b>such</b> a generous selection of attractive neckties. At the same time may I once again thank you for the cigars that you regularly send to the White House." [...] It was signed by Dwight D. Eisenhower. During World War II, three bomber planes were christened with the name of the Stork Club. [...] Billingsley commissioned Tiffany & Co. to produce sterling silver Stork Club logo Victory pins as gifts for their crew members. Patrons were not always on the receiving end; Billingsley's writings claimed that one of his waiters received a $20,000 tip. [...] A bartender received a new Cadillac from a grateful patron, and a headwaiter received a $10,000 tip from tennis star Fred Perry. It was necessary for Billingsley to give the expensive gifts and to provide some or all of a celebrity's Stork Club services for free to bring the stars to the club and keep them coming back. The notables were what brought {{people from all over the}} country in all walks of life to visit the Stork Club.|$|E
500|$|The first {{performances}} {{outside the}} Kingdom of Italy were in Trieste and Vienna, in May 1893. The work {{was given in}} the Americas and across Europe. The Berlin premiere of 1893 so excited Ferruccio Busoni that he drafted a letter to Verdi, in which he addressed him as [...] "Italy's leading composer" [...] and [...] "one of the noblest persons of our time", and in which he explained that [...] "Falstaff provoked in <b>me</b> <b>such</b> a revolution of spirit that I can... date [...] {{the beginning of a}} new epoch in my artistic life." [...] Antonio Scotti played the title role in Buenos Aires in July 1893; Gustav Mahler conducted the opera in Hamburg in January 1894; a Russian translation was presented in St Petersburg in the same month. Paris was regarded by many as the operatic capital of Europe, and for the production there in April 1894 Boito, who was fluent in French, made his own translation with the help of the Parisian poet Paul Solanges. This translation, approved by Verdi, is quite free in its rendering of Boito's original Italian text. Boito was content to delegate the English and German translations to William Beatty Kingston and Max Kalbeck respectively. The London premiere, sung in Italian, was at Covent Garden on 19 May 1894. The conductor was Mancinelli, and Zilli and Pini Corsi repeated their original roles. Falstaff was sung by Arturo Pessina; Maurel played the role at Covent Garden the following season. On 4 February 1895 the work was first presented at the Metropolitan Opera, New York; Mancinelli conducted and the cast included Maurel as Falstaff, Emma Eames as Alice, Zélie de Lussan as Nannetta and Sofia Scalchi as Mistress Quickly.|$|E

2500|$|Philippus Aureolus Paracelsus, (Theophrastus Bombastus von Hohenheim, 1493–1541) cast alchemy {{into a new}} form, rejecting some of Agrippa's occultism {{and moving}} away from chrysopoeia.
