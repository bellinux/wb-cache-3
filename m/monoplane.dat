5|$|Both ships carried one {{aircraft}} catapult {{for a pair}} of Heinkel He 60 biplane reconnaissance float planes. They were {{equipped with}} a crane to retrieve the aircraft after landing. The He 60s were later replaced by the <b>monoplane</b> Arado Ar 196 by 1939. Leipzigs catapult was located between the funnel and the forward superstructure, while Nürnbergs was placed aft of the funnel.|$|E
5|$|North American Aviation's first twin-engined {{military}} aircraft, the NA-21 prototype {{was constructed}} at North American's factory in Inglewood, California, where {{work on the}} aircraft began in early 1936. The NA-21 was a mid-wing <b>monoplane</b> of all-metal construction, powered by two Pratt & Whitney R-2180-A Twin Hornet radial engines, which were fitted with turbosuperchargers for increased high-altitude performance.|$|E

50|$|The two Competition <b>Monoplanes</b> {{were bought}} by the War Office after the Military Aircraft Competition, being used as {{trainers}} for the RFC. However, on 10 September 1912, one of the Competition <b>Monoplanes</b> crashed, killing Lieutenants Edward Hotchkiss and Claude Bettington. While this was traced {{to one of the}} bracing wires becoming detached, it resulted in a five-month ban of flying of all <b>monoplanes</b> by the military wing of the RFC.|$|R
50|$|The MB.210 and MB.211 {{were the}} successors of the French Bloch MB.200 bomber built by Societé des Avions Marcel Bloch in the 1930s and {{differed}} primarily in being low wing <b>monoplanes</b> rather than high wing <b>monoplanes.</b>|$|R
5|$|The Il-32 was an aluminum-bodied, high-wing {{cantilever}} <b>monoplane</b> with a fixed {{tricycle undercarriage}} whose fuselage was square in cross-section to fit as much cargo as possible. The two-spar wings had a moderate aspect ratio. It {{was regarded as}} expendable and was built very simply to facilitate large-scale manufacture. The nose and tail sections swung up to 95° to starboard to facilitate loading.|$|E
5|$|The two Lights {{took off}} out of Kalamazoo in September 1937 in a Bellanca <b>monoplane.</b> Its cabin lacked heat or pressurization. To survive, {{they were forced}} to breathe oxygen from a tank out wooden mouthpieces. Wearing a fur coat and boots, Meader took {{photographs}} out of a window frame.|$|E
5|$|A mid-wing, all-metal, {{cantilever}} <b>monoplane</b> {{with two}} Pratt & Whitney Double Wasp radial engines mounted in streamlined nacelles under the wing, the XTSF-1 {{was intended to}} carry two crew members in tandem seats, and featured an internal bomb bay and a SCR-720 radar set, the radar later being replaced in the design by an AN/APS-3 or AN/APS-4 set. A second seat was added for the radar operator.|$|E
50|$|The Romanian Army took an {{interest}} in aviation from the earliest days, facilitating the construction of the Vlaicu I in 1910. The next year the Army formed the Aviation Group, which {{over the next few years}} constructed Farman biplanes under license and also acquired two Blériot <b>monoplanes,</b> several Bristol-Coandă <b>monoplanes</b> and Two Morane Type F <b>monoplanes.</b> On 20 April 1913 it became the Corp al aernautlior permanenti - the Permanent Corps of Aeronauts. Three months later they engaged in reconnaissance sorties over the Bulgarian border at the start of the Second Balkan War.|$|R

5|$|Designs were {{submitted}} {{in response to}} the Navy's specifications by Vought-Sikorsky and Curtiss-Wright. The Vought design, designated Model 403 by the company, was similar to the company's OS2U Kingfisher, which was then under development to replace the SOC aboard U.S. Navy battleships, but had its <b>monoplane</b> wing moved higher on the fuselage than that of the Kingfisher, and differed in the attachment method used by its single-float landing gear. In addition, the radial engine of the OS2U was replaced by an inline Ranger V-770 in a squared-off cowling.|$|E
5|$|In 1928, Verville left Buhl-Verville to {{establish}} the Verville Aircraft Company, also in Detroit. The company sought to market planes to the wealthy private owner. Verville Aircraft produced the Verville Air Coach, a four-passenger, high-wing <b>monoplane,</b> which made its debut at the 1929 Detroit Air Show and the Verville Sport Trainer, a two-seat tandem biplane. The United States Army Air Corps purchased 4 Sport Trainers under the designation YPT-10. The USAAC tested with 5 different engine versions resulting in YPT-10 thru YPT-10D designations.|$|E
5|$|Retaining his {{interest}} in flying {{after the end of}} his active military career, Hess obtained his private pilot's licence on 4 April 1929. His instructor was World War I flying ace Theodor Croneiss. In 1930 Hess became the owner of a BFW M.23b <b>monoplane</b> sponsored by the party newspaper, the Völkischer Beobachter. He acquired two more Messerschmitt aircraft in the early 1930s, logging many flying hours and becoming proficient in the operation of light single-engine aircraft.|$|E

5000|$|The {{company was}} founded in 1931 by Louis Béchereau {{together}} with the French automobile carriage-builder Georges Kellner. The factory, located at Boulogne-Billancourt, began building light <b>monoplanes.</b> In 1936-37 Avions Kellner-Béchereau built a short series of small <b>monoplanes</b> exploiting one of Louis Béchereau's patents, a full span lateral division of the wing into two sections forming a [...] "double wing".|$|R
5|$|The Airbus A318 {{is a small}} commercial, narrow-body (single-aisle) {{aircraft}} with a retractable tricycle {{landing gear}} and is powered by two wing pylon-mounted turbofan engines. Two suppliers provide turbofan engines for the A318, CFM International with the CFM56-5B engine and Pratt & Whitney with the PW6000 engine. It is a low-wing cantilever <b>monoplane</b> with a conventional tail unit having a single vertical stabilizer and rudder.|$|E
5|$|The Comet was an {{all-metal}} low-wing cantilever <b>monoplane</b> {{powered by}} four jet engines; {{it had a}} four-place cockpit occupied by two pilots, a flight engineer, and a navigator. The clean, low-drag design of the aircraft featured many design elements that were fairly uncommon at the time, including a swept-wing leading edge, integral wing fuel tanks, and four-wheel bogie main undercarriage units designed by de Havilland. Two pairs of turbojet engines (on the Comet 1s, Halford H.2 Ghosts, subsequently known as de Havilland Ghost 50 Mk1s) were buried into the wings.|$|E
5|$|The Ju 87 was a single-engined {{all-metal}} cantilever <b>monoplane.</b> It had a fixed undercarriage {{and could}} carry a two-person crew. The main construction material was duralumin, and the external coverings {{were made of}} Duralumin sheeting. Parts that were required to be of strong construction, such as the wing flaps, were made of Pantal (a German aluminum alloy containing titanium as a hardening element) and its components made of Elektron. Bolts and parts that were required to take heavy stress were made of steel.|$|E

5|$|After {{basic design}} work was {{completed}} on the Tu-4 bomber, Tupolev decided {{to design a}} passenger variant with a pressurized fuselage, given the internal designation of Tu-70. It was intended to use as many Tu-4 components as possible to reduce cost and save development time. It was a low-wing, cantilever <b>monoplane</b> with tricycle landing gear, powered by four Shvetsov ASh-73TK radial engines. Design work on a mockup began in February 1946 and the Council of Ministers confirmed an order for a single prototype the following month. A production decision for the Tu-12, {{as it was to}} be known, would be made after testing.|$|E
5|$|In April 1940, the RAAF {{confirmed}} both Rawlinson's {{appointment as}} a pilot officer and promotion to temporary flying officer as of 22November 1939. Three months later, he posted out to the Middle East with No.3 Squadron, which was to support the 6thDivision in the Western Desert Campaign against Italian forces. Sailing via Bombay, the squadron arrived in Suez, Egypt, on 23August 1940. The next month it was equipped with a flight of Westland Lysander high-wing <b>monoplane</b> reconnaissance aircraft and two flights of Gloster Gladiator biplane fighters, augmented by four Gloster Gauntlet biplanes {{to be used for}} dive bombing; Rawlinson initially trained on the Gauntlet.|$|E
5|$|In the 1930s, {{all three}} members of the class were {{modified}} to carry a pair of float planes for reconnaissance. They were equipped with an aircraft catapult to launch the planes and cranes to recover them after they landed in the water. The ships initially carried two Heinkel He 60 biplane float planes, replaced later in the decade with two Arado Ar 196 <b>monoplane</b> float planes. Only one aircraft could be stored on the catapult at a time; the second plane had to be disassembled and placed in storage, and the ships did not have a hangar to store it in.|$|E

5|$|MiG-3s were {{delivered}} to frontline fighter regiments {{beginning in the}} spring of 1941 and were a handful for pilots accustomed to the lower-performance and docile Polikarpov I-152 and I-153 biplanes and the Polikarpov I-16 <b>monoplane.</b> It remained tricky and demanding to fly even after the extensive improvements made over the MiG-1. Many fighter regiments had not kept pace in training pilots to handle the MiG and the rapid pace of deliveries resulted in many units having more MiGs than trained pilots during the German invasion. By 1 June 1941, 1,029 MIG-3s were on strength, but there were only 494 trained pilots.|$|E
5|$|The Hunter is a {{conventional}} swept wing all-metal <b>monoplane.</b> The fuselage is of monocoque construction, with a removable rear section for engine maintenance. The engine is fed through triangular air intakes in the wing roots {{and has a}} single jetpipe {{in the rear of}} the fuselage. The mid-mounted wings have a leading edge sweep of 35° and slight anhedral, the tailplanes and fin are also swept. The Hunter's aerodynamic qualities were increasingly infringed upon by modifications in later production models, such as the addition of external containers to collect spent gun cartridges, underwing fuel tanks to increase range, leading edge extensions to resolve pitch control difficulties, and a large ventral air brake.|$|E
5|$|The Ikarus IK-2 was a 1930s high-wing, single-seat, <b>monoplane</b> fighter {{aircraft}} of Yugoslav design {{built for}} the Royal Yugoslav Air Force. The IK-2 was designed by French-trained engineers Kosta Sivčev and Ljubomir Ilić, who saw the desirability of a developing a home-grown aircraft industry. A gull-wing design, it was armed with a hub-firing autocannon and fuselage-mounted synchronised machine guns. Just 12 production models were built, as the aircraft was obsolescent {{at the time it}} was brought into service in 1935, and only eight were serviceable at the time of the German-led Axis invasion of Yugoslavia in April 1941. After the defeat of Yugoslavia, the remaining four aircraft were taken onto the strength of the air force of the Axis puppet state, the Independent State of Croatia, but none survived the war.|$|E
