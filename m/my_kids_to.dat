But I’ve had people who are very close to me go through break-ups, and I’ve sort of watched it the whole way through, and it’s been very close to my heart as of late. It’s really occupied my headspace, and my writing space". Sebastian says his family did influence the album however. Missing out of family life because of the damands of work and constant travelling overseas began to frustrate him. Two songs on the album, [...] "Alive" [...] and [...] "Light and Shade", are about making the most of your life and living in the moment, and are reminders to himself {{that there needs to be}} a happy medium between career and family life.

5000|$|In February 2007, a {{group called}} LOVE (the Livingston Organization for Values in Education) {{challenged}} four books in the Howell High School curriculum, including The Bluest Eye. Black Boy by Richard Wright, Slaughterhouse Five by Kurt Vonnegut, and The Freedom Writers Diary were also challenged. Vicki Fyke, the founder of LOVE, challenged the books due to their images of sex, rape, and incest, claiming that inclusion of these books {{in a high school}} curriculum did not comply with federal child pornography and obscenity laws, and was against Michigan's sexual education laws. In addition to Fyke, some members of the school board and parents were against the curriculum, one arguing, [...] "At the end of the day, they're my kids. I don't want <b>my</b> <b>kids</b> <b>to</b> read books. I don't let them eat just anything...I want you to respect that". The school board Vice President also argued that parents should receive warnings of the type of material that is discussed in their children's curricula, and that students should have the option to avoid a particular book based on content. The National Coalition Against Censorship published a letter in response to the criticism, claiming that scenes involving sex [...] "represent small but essential parts of the novels, consistent with the kind of material that high school students frequently read". Their letter also argued that the books in question [...] "are widely recognized as works of significant literary and artistic merit", and [...] "are widely taught in high schools and colleges around the country".|$|E

40|$|Despite the oft-heard {{claims that}} current generations are {{stealing}} from future generations by running fiscal deficits, both theory and evidence {{suggest that this}} is either not true or not knowable. Intergenerational justice is not an appropriate lens through which to analyze fiscal issues, {{because there is no}} obvious starting point from which to build a moral consensus about whether current generations owe anything at all to future generations - and even if we do believe that we owe something to future generations, no one has offered a useful method by which we can determine whether we are doing enough for our progeny. Moreover, if we believe that future generations should be made better off than current generations (2 ̆ 2 I want <b>my</b> <b>kids</b> <b>to</b> be richer than I am. 2 ̆ 2), even pessimistic forecasts indicate that future generations will be much wealthier than current generations, meaning that we are already being quite generous to our children and grandchildren. In addition, the recent significant decline in our economic prospects does not argue for a more contractionary fiscal policy in light of concerns about future generations. In fact, when times are bad, there is no conflict between the interests of current and future generations. Spending by the government helps to improve the economy, which encourages businesses to invest in future productivity. This virtuous cycle is even stronger if the government 2 ̆ 7 s spending is itself used to invest in future productivity...|$|E

40|$|Farming - a way-of-life to {{be proud}} of? CUE: Farmers {{everywhere}} find themselves facing many pressures; they may lack access to inputs, and to markets, and their production can easily be hit by poor rains. For young farmers there {{can also be a}} pressure from their friends. Farming tends to be looked down upon, as an occupation for those who have failed to get a paid job in a more respected area like medicine or engineering. In this report, Daniel Sikazwe talks to two young farmers who have overcome these pressures. Both are members of the Zambia Young Farmers Clubs. He asks them how they feel about being farmers, and whether they have been tempted to look for white collar work. The young people come from Kabwe, a town 135 km from Zambia?s capital Lusaka. Alice is 22 years old and Viache Makunmbe is 23. Daniel?s first question, ?What made you take up farming?? is addressed to Alice. IN:		?I just came to join into ? OUT:		? that will come behind us. ? DUR?N	 4 ? 33 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: Viache Makunmbe who has taken on agriculture as a way of life, despite the temptation of white collar jobs. Transcript Alice	I just came to join into farming through my parents. As I was growing up I just came to get interested in farming, because I?m not educated and I decided to be a farmer, just because I knew I can?t chance a job in Zambia. Sikazwe	And so what kind of farming did you start doing when it became difficult for you to go ahead with your education, or to get a job? Alice	I started growing maize with my parents. Later on my mum she passed away, and even now I?m depending on maize and groundnuts, including beans. Sikazwe	Is that enough to help you earn a living? Alice	Yes, at least it is much better than staying, because I?m getting whatever I want through farming. I can afford to keep <b>my</b> <b>kids,</b> <b>to</b> feed myself, even though selling it is a problem. In Zambia we don?t have a good market, but at least I?m pushing myself up. Sikazwe	What have been some of the major challenges that you have had to contend with as a young person in agriculture? Alice	I face problems with fertilizer at times. So now we are introducing organic for young farmers; I?m even interested in that. I think that at any time or next year, I may change. Sikazwe	OK, let?s hear your story Viache Makunmbe from Kabwe rural, that?s a remote part of Kabwe. Just tell me how you got into agriculture. Makunmbe	My parents and our family, we are all a farming family. Sikazwe	Is that what you had always wanted to do in your life? Makunmbe	Well I had wanted to do other things but after having looked at the economic crisis, and the unemployment rate in Zambia, I just settled for agriculture, which created a vacuum at the moment. Sikazwe	You obviously had friends that you were growing up with, some that you might have shared ambitions of, for instance, becoming a doctor, becoming a pilot, becoming an engineer; how do you relate to them at the moment now that you are in farming, and they are doing probably what they might have set out to do? Makunmbe	Well we relate to each other as we related in our past days, because then as a society we are looking at each others - one has to be a farmer, one has to be a doctor, and the other one has to be doing the other job to make a complete society. Sikazwe	Are there times you feel tempted to abandon farming altogether, and take up the so called ?White Collar? jobs? Makunmbe	There have been several times I have been tempted to leave farming, due to various reasons, one of them being that you come to hit a concrete wall in Zambian farming where you can?t acquire any farming inputs, and farming cannot carry on like that. Sikazwe	So what has kept you going when things were that tough? Makunmbe	Well I have taken farming as a way of living, as a religion. I just believe in it, and I just push, and my heart pushes and I just go ahead. Sikazwe	So apart from just the issue of having problems with farming inputs, {{what are some of the}} challenges as a young person that you have had to contend with in agriculture? Makunmbe	The biggest challenge as you asked me earlier on, is how I relate to others. When they look at a young farmer in Zambia, it is sort of a downgrade of people that have been left that don?t have anything to do. That is what as the Young Farmers Club we are trying to cast out and bring something else. And in relation to others that have got a white collar job, the temptation is always there because they are always getting their salaries at the end of the month, they don?t have any problems with inputs. Come rain, come no rain, for them it?s alright. Sikazwe	So do you consider farming a career, and what would you want to say to young people out there who might still believe that farming cannot be taken upon as a career? Makunmbe	I consider farming as a career, and as a way of life. And I would like to encourage all the young farmers out there to take upon farming as a career and as a way of life, because if we look at life generally, whether we take a white collar job or not, at the end of the day, anyone of us retires to take a small farming life. So I would like to encourage most of my age folk to take up farming, so that even at the time of retirement they are well set, and everything is going on, and that will build up a foundation for all those that will come behind us, and behind those that will come behind us. End of tapeYoung people who decide to pursue a career in farming face many pressures. They may struggle to obtain farm inputs or credit. They may also feel ashamed because they are not working in a ?respectable? white-collar job. This report from Zambia features two young people who describe how they have overcome these difficulties...|$|E
