25|$|Low {{temperature}} ionic liquids (below 130K) {{have been}} proposed as the fluid base for an extremely large diameter spinning liquid <b>mirror</b> <b>telescope</b> {{to be based on}} the Earth's moon. Low temperature is advantageous in imaging long wave infrared light which is the form of light (extremely red-shifted) that arrives from the most distant parts of the visible universe. Such a liquid base would be covered by a thin metallic film that forms the reflective surface. Low volatility is important in lunar vacuum conditions.|$|E
25|$|Although paraboloids are {{difficult}} to make from flat sheets of solid material, they can be made quite simply by rotating open-topped containers which hold liquids. The top surface of a liquid which is being rotated at constant speed around a vertical axis naturally {{takes the form of}} a paraboloid. Centrifugal force causes material to move outward from the axis of rotation until a deep enough depression is formed in the surface for the force to be balanced by the levelling effect of gravity. It turns out that the depression is an exact paraboloid. (See Liquid <b>mirror</b> <b>telescope.)</b> If the material solidifies while it is rotating, the paraboloidal shape is maintained after the rotation stops, and can be used to make a reflector. This rotation technique is sometimes used to make paraboloidal mirrors for astronomical telescopes, and has also been used for solar cookers. Devices for constructing such paraboloids are known as rotating furnaces.|$|E
500|$|The {{optical system}} weighs [...] and is manoeuvred on an alt-azimuth mount, {{with a total}} moving mass of [...] (plus instruments). The BTA-6 and Multi <b>Mirror</b> <b>Telescope</b> had {{demonstrated}} during the 1970s the significant weight (and therefore cost) savings which could be achieved by the alt-azimuth design compared to the traditional equatorial mount for large telescopes. However, the alt-azimuth design requires continuous computer control, compensation for field rotation at each focus, and results in a 0.2 degree radius [...] at zenith where the drive motors cannot keep up with sidereal motion (the drives have a maximum speed of one degree per second in each axis). The mount is so smooth and finely balanced that before the drive motors were installed {{it was possible to}} move the then [...] assembly by hand. During closed loop guiding, the mount is capable of an absolute pointing accuracy of 0.03 arcseconds.|$|E

The Giant Magellan Telescope, uses very large segments and is either grouped with segmented <b>mirrors</b> <b>telescopes</b> or its own category. Planned for completion in 2021. The Thirty meter telescope is being built at the Mauna Kea Observatories in Hawaii (estimated first-light by 2022).

5000|$|With [...] an {{elliptic}} paraboloid is a paraboloid of revolution: {{a surface}} obtained by revolving a parabola around its axis. It is {{the shape of}} the parabolic reflectors used in mirrors, antenna dishes, and the like; and is also {{the shape of the}} surface of a rotating liquid, a principle used in liquid <b>mirror</b> <b>telescopes</b> and in making solid <b>telescope</b> <b>mirrors</b> (see rotating furnace). This shape is also called a circular paraboloid.|$|R
50|$|Fused silica was {{initially}} used in <b>mirrors,</b> <b>telescopes,</b> radar, {{and later in}} spacecraft windows and fiber optics. Corning researchers used this fused silica when they invented optical fiber in 1970, which provided faster transmission speeds than copper wires did. Fused silica has also made the miniaturization of computer chips possible, as it is used in high transmission microlithographic lenses.|$|R
50|$|Regardless of the {{specific}} configuration, such a telescope {{would be similar to}} an earth-based liquid <b>mirror</b> <b>telescope.</b> However, instead of relying on Earth's gravity to maintain the necessary parabolic shape of the rotating mercury mirror, it relies on artificial gravity instead.|$|E

50|$|If {{a liquid}} is {{contained}} in a cylindrical vessel and is rotating around a vertical axis coinciding with the axis of the cylinder, the free surface will assume a parabolic surface of revolution known as a paraboloid. The free surface at each point is at a right angle to the force acting at it, which is the resultant of {{the force of gravity}} and the centrifugal force from the motion of each point in a circle. Since the main <b>mirror</b> in a <b>telescope</b> must be parabolic, this principle is used to create liquid <b>mirror</b> <b>telescopes.</b>|$|R

50|$|Paraboloids {{are also}} {{observed}} in {{the surface of a}} liquid confined to a container and rotated around the central axis.

50|$|Liquid <b>mirror</b> <b>telescopes</b> have {{rotating}} <b>mirrors</b> that {{consist of}} a liquid metal such as mercury or a low-melting alloy of gallium. The mirrors do not solidify, but are used while liquid and rotating. The rotation shapes them into paraboloids that are accurate enough {{to be used as}} primary reflectors in telescopes. No correction of the shape is necessary. Spin-cast glass mirrors need correction because of distortions that arise during and after solidification.|$|R

50|$|Some transit telescopes use a {{basin of}} mercury {{to form a}} flat and {{absolutely}} horizontal mirror, useful in determining an absolute vertical or perpendicular reference.
