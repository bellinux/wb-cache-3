Other uses include floor tiles, bulletin boards, balls, footwear, cigarette tips, packaging, insulation and joints in woodwind instruments.|$|E
5|$|FETA {{began to}} be {{concerned}} over the structural wear of the bridge in the 21st century. The planned theoretical capacity for the bridge (30,000vehicles per day in each direction) was routinely exceeded as traffic levels outstripped predictions. The Scottish Government stated in 2006 that 60,000vehicles travelled on <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>half</b> <b>the</b> days in a year. This raised concerns about the lifespan of the bridge, originally planned at 120 years.|$|E

Migrating birds carry ticks with them on their journeys; a study of migratory birds passing through Egypt found <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>half</b> <b>the</b> bird species examined were carrying ticks. The species of tick often differed between the autumn and spring migrations, probably because of the seasonal periodicities of the different species.|$|E

This collision stripped <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>half</b> <b>the</b> mass from the smaller M32 and created the ring structures in Andromeda.|$|E
5|$|If {{dropping}} {{the requirement for}} {{the uniqueness of the}} solution, 41-clue minimal pseudo-puzzles are known to exist, but they can be completed to more than one solution grid.

5|$|Male elk {{retain their}} antlers for <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>half</b> <b>the</b> year {{and are less}} likely to group with other males when they have antlers. Antlers provide a means of defense, as does a strong front-leg kick, which is {{performed}} by either sex if provoked. Once the antlers have been shed, bulls tend to form bachelor groups which allow them to work cooperatively at fending off predators. Herds tend to employ one or more scouts while the remaining members eat and rest.|$|E

5|$|As {{the matches}} were often played {{consecutively}} without a day between fixtures, Australia employed a rotation policy, {{and as a}} result, Hassett captained the team in nine tour matches while Bradman was rested.

Hassett had two close encounters, both on damp pitches before the First Test. Against Yorkshire, Australia scraped home by four wickets in a low-scoring match with ten men after Sam Loxton succumbed to injury.
