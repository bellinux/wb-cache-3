50|$|An indicium {{is valid}} if an item is posted by midnight {{of the working}} day {{following}} {{the day it was}} emitted. Refunds are available for unused indicia online within 14 calendar days of purchase, so long as the <b>mail</b> <b>item</b> has not been processed by the mail centre. If an indicium fails to print properly, e.g. due to an error or printer problem, a refund must be applied for.|$|E
50|$|The 'M' in EPPML {{stands for}} Model. EPPML {{was defined by}} its authors {{as a model for}} the {{interaction}} between parties that create, publish, consume or deliver postal products. The interactions defined by the model include actions on physical items, information exchanges and financial transactions. The typical action on a physical item is a change of location (e.g. delivery). The information exchanges may use either electronic channels (e.g. web services, email) or physical channels (e.g. bar codes printed on mail items by mailers and read posts). An example of a financial transaction is a refund for late delivery of a <b>mail</b> <b>item.</b>|$|E

50|$|In England {{during the}} latter part of the 17th century several postmarks were devised for use with the London Penny Post, a postal system that {{delivered}} <b>mailed</b> <b>items</b> within the city of London. The postmarks bore the initial of the particular post office or handling house it was sent from along with a separate time stamp. Postage was prepaid and the postmark was applied to the <b>mailed</b> <b>item</b> by means of an inked hand-stamp. Some historians also consider these postmarks to be the world's first postage 'stamps'.|$|R
25|$|In 1680 William Dockwra, an English {{merchant}} in London, and {{his partner}} Robert Murray established the London Penny Post, a mail system that delivered letters and small parcels inside the city of London for the sum of one penny. The postage for the <b>mailed</b> <b>item</b> was prepaid {{by the use of}} a hand-stamp to frank the <b>mailed</b> <b>item,</b> confirming payment of postage. Though this 'stamp' was applied to a letter instead of a separate piece of paper it is considered by many historians as the world's first postage stamp.|$|R
5000|$|Traditionally, mail servers {{could accept}} a <b>mail</b> <b>item,</b> then later send a Non-Delivery Report or [...] "bounce" [...] message if it couldn't be {{delivered}} {{or had been}} quarantined for any reason. These {{would be sent to}} the [...] "MAIL FROM:" [...] aka [...] "Return Path" [...] address. With the massive rise in forged addresses, Best Practice is now to not generate NDRs for detected spam, viruses etc. but to reject the email during the SMTP transaction. When mail administrators fail to take this approach, their systems are guilty of sending [...] "backscatter" [...] emails to innocent parties - in itself a form of spam - or being used to perform [...] "Joe job" [...] attacks.|$|E

40|$|Objective: To {{determine}} the amount, types, and proportion that is read of unsolicited mail received by a general practice registrar. Design, setting and participant: A mixed-methods, prospective, descriptive study of unsolicited mail sent {{directly to a}} general practice registrar in a private general practice located in rural north Queensland, collected between 1 March and 30 September 2010. Main outcome measures: The amount, by number and weight, of unsolicited <b>mail</b> <b>items,</b> {{and the proportion of}} each document read, in total and by category. Results: 196 <b>items</b> of unsolicited <b>mail,</b> weighing 19. 85 kg, were received over a period of 7 months.

50|$|When mail was {{submitted}} for delivery by the Penny Post the postage {{rate of one}} penny was charged and a hand-stamped postmark and time-stamp were applied to the <b>mailed</b> <b>item</b> confirming that its postage had been paid.

50|$|Letters and postcards {{fed into}} an {{automated}} mail processing plant are illuminated with ultraviolet light. The {{reaction of the}} luminescent features of the stamps on this illumination is used to position the <b>mail</b> <b>items</b> such that the stamps can be cancelled, and that the significant parts of the address such as postcodes may be read and the mail be sorted accordingly.|$|R
5000|$|With {{the start}} of {{development}} programs in Bhutan {{and the end of}} its self-imposed isolation in the late 1950s and early 1960s, there was a sizeable increase of correspondence in English and the number of <b>mail</b> <b>items,</b> now also including Indian newspapers and periodicals for the staff managing schools and development projects. The Dzong mail service was not able to cope with the significant increase of <b>mail</b> <b>items</b> and its staff could in general not read English. In the first Five Year Plan launched in 1961 the set-up of a postal service was among the proposed development activities. A Posts & Telegraphs Department was established under the Ministry of Communications and the first regular post office was opened in the border town of Phuentsholing on 10 October 1962, when also the first postage stamps were issued. The decision of the Kingdom to issue postage stamps has been described also as its first assertion of its international personality ...|$|R

25|$|The {{transfer}} of mail between the inter-island steamer ferries and trains {{used to be}} a significant source of traffic for Lyttelton. <b>Mail</b> <b>items</b> were transported in hampers, bags, or crates, and transferred on and off the ship using slings. Local services were used to transport the mail between Christchurch and the port in postal vans. Following the introduction of the rail-air service in the 1960s, use of the ferries to transport the mail between Christchurch and Wellington declined.|$|R
50|$|HTLINGUAL (also HGLINGUAL), {{a secret}} {{project of the}} United States of America's Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) project to {{intercept}} mail destined for the Soviet Union and China, operated from 1952 until 1973. Originally known under the codename SRPOINTER (also SGPOINTER), the project authority was changed in 1955 and renamed.

50|$|The Royal Mail {{operates}} {{a network of}} 38 mail centres. Each mail centre serves a large geographically defined area of the United Kingdom and together they form the backbone network of the mail distribution operation. The number of mail centres has been reducing as the service is modernised and in 2008 there were 69 mail centres. In 2013 and 2014 a further eight are planned to be closed. <b>Mail</b> <b>items</b> are delivered to homes and businesses from 1,356 delivery offices, which are supplied by the mail centres.|$|R
50|$|In China, local provincial governments {{collect and}} supply the postal {{services}} but {{the charges are}} set by the national government. Increasing inflation meant that by 1987 the amount charged for postal services was less {{than the cost of}} providing those services. Local governments therefore requested an increase in postal rates but this was refused by the national government. The local governments were allowed, however, to levy an additional charge on certain outgoing <b>mail</b> <b>items</b> to defray their costs and in January 1987 the first local postal surcharge label was used in Guangdong.|$|R

50|$|SAL, or Surface Air Lifted, is {{a postal}} service used to send {{international}} <b>mail</b> <b>items.</b> Thirty-nine postal authorities provide this service. It is a cost effective international mail. At first SAL mail is processed and transported by surface in the origin country. Then it is transported by air to the destination country and finally processed and delivered as standard-type mail by the destination postal administration. The service is faster than surface mail while the cost is lower than air mail.SAL is more economical for sending heavy items; with light items, it sometimes costs more than air mail.|$|R

50|$|The Post Office {{had little}} {{difficulty}} in getting mass mailers {{to use the}} ZIP Code as it could make its inclusion a condition for receiving preferential mailing rates and soon did.

This was particularly true of older mailers. Mr. ZIP was the Post Office's answer to this, apparently intended to teach small children to always use the ZIP Code as they got older and also to encourage their parents and grandparents to do so.|$|R
