40|$|Contact {{angle of}} {{three-phase}} Abstract. In {{order to develop}} safe and sustainable food and pharmaceutical emulsions, bacterial cellulose (BC) nanofibrils were prepared to stabilize <b>maize</b> oil/water <b>Pickering</b> emulsions. The influence of BC content and pH value on the emulsion stability was explored. Droplet diameters decreased with BC contents in emulsions. At pH 12, the emulsions were most stable among all tested pH values. The transformation of emulsion structure from liquid to gel-like at 8 - 15 °C with BC content higher than 1. 55 g/L is predominantly depended on the viscoelastic entangled BC network. These results can have meaningful inspiration of designing edible food and pharmaceutical emulsions. 1...|$|R
40|$|Background Maize (Zea mays) is a C 4 {{tropical}} {{cereal and}} its adaptation to temperate climates can be problematic due to low soil temperatures at {{early stages of}} establishment. Methods In the current study we have firstly investigated the physiological response of twelve maize varieties, from a chilling condition adapted gene pool, to sub-optimal growth temperature during seedling emergence. To identify transcriptomic markers of cold tolerance in already adapted maize genotypes, temperature conditions were set below the optimal growth range in both control and low temperature groups. The conditions were as follows; control (18  °C for 16 h and 12  °C for 8 h) and low temperature (12  °C for 16 h and 6  °C for 8 h). Four genotypes were identified from the condition adapted gene pool with significant contrasting chilling tolerance. Results Picker and PR 39 B 29 were the more cold-tolerant lines and Fergus and Codisco were the less cold-tolerant lines. These four varieties were subjected to microarray analysis to identify differentially expressed genes under chilling conditions. Exposure to low temperature during establishment in the <b>maize</b> varieties <b>Picker,</b> PR 39 B 29, Fergus and Codisco, was reflected at the transcriptomic level in the varieties Picker and PR 39 B 29. No significant changes in expression were observed in Fergus and Codisco following chilling stress. A total number of 64 genes were differentially expressed in the two chilling tolerant varieties. These two varieties exhibited contrasting transcriptomic profiles, in which only four genes overlapped. Discussion We observed that maize varieties possessing an enhanced root growth ratio under low temperature were more tolerant, which could be an early and inexpensive measure for germplasm screening under controlled conditions. We have identified novel cold inducible genes in an already adapted maize breeding gene pool. This illustrates that further varietal selection for enhanced chilling tolerance is possible in an already preselected gene pool...|$|R
