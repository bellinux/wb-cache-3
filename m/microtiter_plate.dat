40|$|Radioimmunometric and enzyme-immunometric assays were {{developed}} {{for the detection of}} salmonellae in pure and mixed cultures as well as in 59 food samples. The performances of titanous hydroxide suspension and <b>microtiter</b> <b>plates</b> as the solid phase for the immobilization of microorganisms were compared in these immunoassays. Detection of populations of salmonella cells in pure culture, diluted with saline, was 4 - to 10 -fold more sensitive with the <b>microtiter</b> <b>plates.</b> However, with mixed culture of salmonella and other enterobacterial species, the detection sensitivity with titanous hydroxide was 100 - to 160 -fold more sensitive than with <b>microtiter</b> <b>plates.</b> Good correlation existed between results of a standard cultural method for the detection of salmonellae in foods and those obtained from radioimmunometric and enzyme-immunometric assays utilizing titanous hydroxide. However, a high incidence of false-positive and false-negative results with food samples occurred with the enzyme-immunometric assay utilizing <b>microtiter</b> <b>plates.</b> The results provided strong evidence for the merits of substituting titanous hydroxide for <b>microtiter</b> <b>plates</b> as the solid phase for the immobilization of salmonellae for their detection by immunoassays.

40|$|AbstractNew {{insight into}} the {{importance}} of carbohydrates in biological systems underscores the need for rapid synthetic and screening procedures for them. Development of an organic synthesis-compatible linker that would attach saccharides to <b>microtiter</b> <b>plates</b> was therefore undertaken to facilitate research in glycobiology. Galactosyllipids containing small, hydrophobic groups at the anomeric position were screened for noncovalent binding to <b>microtiter</b> <b>plates.</b> When the lipid component was a saturated hydrocarbon between 13 and 15 carbons in length, the monosaccharide showed complete retention after aqueous washing and could be utilized in biological assays. This alkyl chain was also successfully employed with more complex oligosaccharides in biological assays. In light of these findings, this method of attachment of oligosaccharides to <b>microtiter</b> <b>plates</b> should be highly efficacious to high-throughput synthesis and analyses of carbohydrates in biological assays...|$|R
40|$|Botrytis cinerea and Puccinia recondita spores adhere {{strongly}} to polystyrene <b>microtiter</b> <b>plates</b> coincident with germination.

In both organisms, fungicides that inhibited germination strongly inhibited spore adhesion, with 50 % effective concentrations (EC 50 s) comparable to those for inhibition of germination. In contrast, fungicides that acted after germination in B. cinerea inhibited spore adhesion to <b>microtiter</b> <b>plates</b> only at concentrations much higher than their EC 50 s for inhibition of mycelial growth. Similarly, in P. recondita the ergosterol biosynthesis inhibitors myclobutanil and fenbuconazole acted after germination and did not inhibit spore adhesion. The assays provide a rapid, high-throughput alternative to traditional spore germination assays and may be applicable to other fungi...|$|R

40|$|A {{large number}} of <b>microtiter</b> <b>plates</b> are needed for mass testing of {{planting}} material for viruses in seed certification and plant quarantine. In the case of poorly equipped laboratories, problems with availability of <b>microtiter</b> <b>plates</b> have economic implications for the broad acceptance of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for e. g. seed health testing in developing countries. In this experiment the potential of an alternative, cheaper technique was investigated. A conventional indirect ELISA procedure was followed for comparison between the polystyrene solid phases of plastic Petri dishes and <b>microtiter</b> <b>plates</b> for detection of three viruses belonging to the Tobamovirus, Comovirus and Potyvirus genera. A wax pen was used to divide the inner surface of a polystyrene Petri dish into many circles or squares. The hydrophobic boundaries thus provided were effective in separating 50 µl-drops throughout the ELISA procedure. In comparative assays of serial dilutions of the three viruses, the ELISA in Petri dishes resulted in similar or higher A 405 values than the ELISA carried out in <b>microtiter</b> <b>plates,</b> suggesting a similar or better protein binding capacity of Petri dishes. The perspectives of this alternative method are briefly discussed...|$|R

40|$|Glucosinolates are phytochemicals {{with health}} {{promoting}} properties. Determination as desulpho-glucosinolates {{is widely used}} and adesulphation in <b>microtiter</b> <b>plates</b> {{has been applied to}} reach highthroughput. The use of various sulphatase concentrations and volumes throughout literature necessitates the identification of an appropriate desulphation procedure in <b>microtiter</b> <b>plates.</b> High sulphatase concentrations (¿ 15 mg/ml) decreased the concentration of the internal standard glucotropaeolin, whereas the other glucosinolates were less affected. Due to the calculation based on the recovery of glucotropaeolin, this leads to an overestimation of GL concentrations after desulphation with high sulphatase concentrations. A glucosidase side-activity, present in the crude sulphatase powder, is likely causing this phenomenon. At lower sulphatase concentrations (1 mg/ml) glucoiberin and glucoraphanin were insufficiently desulphated. Combining these effects results in a small range of applicable sulphatase concentrations. A purified sulphatase preparation resulted in good recoveries for a diversity of samples and is hence recommended for highthroughputdesulphation in <b>microtiter</b> <b>plates...</b>|$|R

50|$|For the {{detection}} of HIV antibodies, the wells of <b>microtiter</b> <b>plate</b> are coated with the HIV antigen. Two specific antibodies are used, one conjugated with enzyme and the other present in serum (if serum is positive for the antibody). Cumulative competition occurs between the two antibodies for the same antigen, causing a stronger signal to be seen. Sera to be tested are added to these wells and incubated at 37 °C, and then washed. If antibodies are present, the antigen-antibody reaction occurs. No antigen is left for the enzyme-labelled specific HIV antibodies. These antibodies remain free upon addition and are washed off during washing. Substrate is added, {{but there is no}} enzyme to act on it, so a positive result shows no color change.|$|E
