40|$|Cognitive radio {{technology}} allows unlicensed users to utilize licensed wireless spectrum if the wireless spectrum is unused by licensed users. Therefore, spectrum sensing should {{be carried out}} before unlicensed users access the wireless spectrum. Since mobile terminals such as smartphones {{are more and more}} intelligent, they can sense the wireless spectrum. The method that spectrum sensing task is assigned to <b>mobile</b> <b>intelligent</b> <b>terminals</b> is called crowdsourcing. For a large-scale region, we propose the crowdsourcing paradigm to assign mobile users the spectrum sensing task. The sensing task assignment is influenced by some factors including remaining energy, locations, and costs of mobile terminals. Considering these constraints, we design a precise sensing effect function with a local constraint and aim to maximize this sensing effect to address crowdsensing task assignment. The problem of crowdsensing task assignment is difficult to solve since we prove that it is NP-hard. We design an optimal algorithm based on particle swarm optimization to solve this problem. Simulation results show our algorithm achieves higher performance than the other algorithms...|$|R
40|$|Spectrum sensing is an {{important}} issue in cognitive radio networks. The unlicensed users can access the licensed wireless spectrum only when the licensed wireless spectrum is sensed to be idle. Since mobile terminals such as smartphones and tablets are popular among people, spectrum sensing can be assigned to these <b>mobile</b> <b>intelligent</b> <b>terminals,</b> which is called crowdsourcing method. Based on the crowdsourcing method, this paper studies the distributed scheme to assign spectrum sensing task to mobile terminals such as smartphones and tablets. Considering the fact that mobile terminals’ positions may influence the sensing results, a precise sensing effect function is designed for the crowdsourcing-based sensing task assignment. We aim to maximize the sensing effect function and cast this optimization problem to address crowdsensing task assignment in cognitive radio networks. This problem is difficult to be solved because the complexity of this problem increases exponentially with the growth in mobile terminals. To assign crowdsensing task, we propose four distributed algorithms with different transition probabilities and use a Markov chain to analyze the approximation gap of our proposed schemes. Simulation results evaluate the average performance of our proposed algorithms and validate the algorithm’s convergence...|$|R

40|$|Mobile ad hoc network (MANET) {{is a new}} {{opportunity}} for <b>mobile</b> networking using <b>intelligent</b> <b>mobile</b> <b>terminals.</b> However, the widely used shortest path first based routing algorithm leads to various network utilization problems. Mobile terminals have limited power, hence, power saving should be considered when terminals serve as intermediate nodes in MANET. Furthermore, ad hoc routing table calculation is distributed among all network terminals. Therefore, {{we also need to}} construct stable paths with longer lifetime {{in order to reduce the}} communication overhead introduced by route reconstruction. A less evenly distributed traffic exhausts power on the nodes in the center of the network and leads to shorter path lifetime. Such a network deployment is not fair for the internal nodes. The above problems exist for all routing protocols especially proactive routing protocols based on shortest path first algorithm OLSR. In this paper we study the MANET network utilization in term of load distribution and path lifetime. Our careful simulation results demonstrate that the standard shortest path first algorithm leads to worse load balancing and reduced path lifetime compared to our proposal. When the most unstable network topology is considered, our proposal achieves better network utilization by reducing the peak transmission per node by 15 % and the standard deviation of transmission per node by 50 %. The average lifetime for established paths is doubled under the most unstable topology. © 2012 IEEE...|$|R

We first study the SINR association-game: we determine the cells corresponding to each base stations, i. e. the locations at which mobile terminals prefer to connect to a given base station than to other. The Signal to Interference and Noise Ratio (SINR) is used as the quantity that determines the association. We make some surprising observations: (i) displacing a base station a little in one direction may result in a displacement of the boundary of the corresponding cell to the opposite direction; (ii) A cell corresponding to a BS may be the union of disconnected sub-cells. We then study the Stackelberg equilibrium in the combined BS location and mobile association problem: we determine where to locate the BSs so as to maximize the revenues obtained at the induced SINR mobile association game.
