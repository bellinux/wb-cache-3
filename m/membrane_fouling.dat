Fouled seawater reverse osmosis membrane biofilm communities from an array of autopsied membrane samples, following a 7 -year operational life-span in a full-scale desalination plant in Western Australia, were characterised by 16 S rRNA gene metabarcoding using the bacterial primers 515 F and 806 R.

The hollow-fiber <b>membrane</b> exhibited <b>fouling</b> with a cake layer composed of fungi and starch, intensity being proportional to the operating flux (0. 05 – 0. 3 m/d). Conversely, the flat-sheet membrane suffered from immediate internal pore blocking beyond a critical flux of 0. 2 m/d. During the experiment with major constituents of the synthetic wastewater separately, while media containing only starch and only dye induced negligible fouling, flux-dependent pore blocking was evident for both the hollow-fiber (0. 288 m/d) and flat-sheet membranes (1. 3 m/d) for the mixture of starch and dye.

40|$|The {{search for}} new {{renewable}} materials has intensified in recent years. Pulp and paper mill process streams contain a number of potential compounds {{which could be used}} in biofuel production and as raw materials in the chemical, food and pharmaceutical industries. Prior to utilization, these compounds require separation from other compounds present in the process stream. One feasible separation technique is membrane filtration but to some extent, fouling still limits its implementation in pulp and paper mill applications. To mitigate fouling and its effects, foulants and their fouling mechanisms need to be well understood. This thesis evaluates fouling in filtration of pulp and paper mill process streams by means of polysaccharide model substance filtrations and by development of a procedure to analyze and identify potential foulants, i. e. wood extractives and carbohydrates, from <b>fouled</b> <b>membranes.</b> The model solution filtration results demonstrate that each polysaccharide has its own fouling mechanism, which also depends on the membrane characteristics. Polysaccharides may <b>foul</b> the <b>membranes</b> by adsorption and/or by gel/cake layer formation on the membrane surface. Moreover, the polysaccharides interact, which makes fouling evaluation of certain compound groups very challenging. Novel methods to identify wood extractive and polysaccharide foulants are developed in this thesis. The results show {{that it is possible to}} extract and identify wood extractives from <b>membranes</b> <b>fouled</b> in filtration of pulp and paper millstreams. The most effective solvent was found to be acetone:water (9 : 1 v/v) because it extracted both lipophilic extractives and lignans at high amounts from the <b>fouled</b> <b>membranes</b> and it was also non-destructive for the membrane materials. One hour of extraction was enough to extract wood extractives at high amounts for membrane samples with an area of 0. 008 m 2. If only qualitative knowledge of wood extractives is needed a simplified extraction procedure can be used. Adsorption was the main fouling mechanism in extractives-induced fouling and dissolved fatty and resin acids were mostly the reason for the fouling; colloidal fouling was negligible. Both process water and membrane characteristics affected extractives-induced fouling. In general, the more hydrophilic regenerated cellulose (RC) <b>membrane</b> <b>fouled</b> less that the more hydrophobic polyethersulfone (PES) and polyamide (PA) membranes independent of the process water used. Monosaccharide and uronic acid units could also be identified from the <b>fouled</b> synthetic polymeric <b>membranes.</b> It was impossible to analyze all monosaccharide units from the RC membrane because the analysis result obtained contained degraded membrane material. One of the fouling mechanisms of carbohydrates was adsorption.

50|$|Contemporary {{research}} in the area of Nanofiltration (NF) technology is primarily concerned with improving the performance of NF membranes, minimising <b>membrane</b> <b>fouling</b> and reducing energy requirements of already existing processes. One way in which researchers are attempting to improve NF performance - more specifically increase permeate flux and lower membrane resistance - is through experimentation with different membrane materials and configurations. thin film composite membranes (TFC), which consist of a number of extremely thin selective layers interfacially polymerized over a microporous substrate, have had the most commercial success in industrial membrane applications due to the capability of optimizing the selectivity and permeability of each individual layer. Recent research has shown that the addition of nanotechnology materials such as electrospunnanofibrous membrane layers (ENMs) to conventional TFC membranes results in an enhanced permeate flux. This has been attributed to inherent properties of ENMs that favour flux, namely their interconnected pore structure, high porosity and low transmembrane pressure. A recently developed membrane configuration which offers a more energy efficient alternative to the commonly used spiral wound arrangement is the hollow fibre membrane. This format has the advantage of requiring significantly less pre-treatment than spiral wound membranes, as solids introduced in the feed are displaced effectively during backwash or flushing. As a result, <b>membrane</b> <b>fouling</b> and pre-treatment energy costs are reduced. Extensive research has also been conducted on the potential use of Titanium Dioxide (TiO2, titania) nanoparticles for <b>membrane</b> <b>fouling</b> reduction. This method involves applying a nonporous coating of titania onto the membrane surface. Internal fouling/pore blockage of the membrane is resisted due to the nonporosity of the coating, whilst the superhydrophilic nature of titania provides resistance to surface fouling by reducing adhesion of emulsified oil on the membrane surface.|$|E

At low pressure, low feed concentration, and high feed velocity, concentration polarisation effects are minimal and flux is almost proportional to trans-membrane pressure difference. However, in the high pressure range, flux becomes almost independent of applied pressure. Deviation from linear flux-pressure relation is due to concentration polarisation. At low feed flow rate or with high feed concentration, the limiting flux situation is observed even at relatively low pressures.|$|E
50|$|There are {{two main}} flow {{configurations}} of membrane processes: cross-flow (or) tangential flow and dead-end filtrations. In cross-flow filtration the feed flow is tangential {{to the surface of}} membrane, retentate is removed from the same side further downstream, whereas the permeate flow is tracked on the other side. In dead-end filtration the direction of the fluid flow is normal to the membrane surface. Both flow geometries offer some advantages and disadvantages. Generally, dead-end filtration is used for feasibility studies on a laboratory scale. The dead-end membranes are relatively easy to fabricate which reduces the cost of the separation process. The dead-end membrane separation process is easy to implement and the process is usually cheaper than cross-flow membrane filtration. The dead-end filtration process is usually a batch-type process, where the filtering solution is loaded (or slowly fed) into the membrane device, which then allows passage of some particles subject to the driving force. The main disadvantage of a dead end filtration is the extensive <b>membrane</b> <b>fouling</b> and concentration polarization. The fouling is usually induced faster at higher driving forces. <b>Membrane</b> <b>fouling</b> and particle retention in a feed solution also builds up a concentration gradients and particle back flow (concentration polarization). The tangential flow devices are more cost and labor-intensive, but they are less susceptible to fouling due to the sweeping effects and high shear rates of the passing flow. The most commonly used synthetic membrane devices (modules) are flat sheets/plates, spiral wounds, and hollow fibers.|$|E
