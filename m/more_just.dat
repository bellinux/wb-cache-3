5|$|Route434 {{begins at}} an {{intersection}} with Route739 and Pike County Quadrant Route4004 in Lords Valley, {{a community in}} Blooming Grove Township. Route434 heads to the northeast, passing businesses and homes before leaving the community. The highway then gets into a more scenic rural region, with trees surrounding the highway. Route434, which makes several curves {{for the next few}} miles, passes to the south of a lake. The highway continues on for several miles in this way. A short time later, the highway passes a couple homes and crosses Shohola Creek. Just north of the creek, the area becomes somewhat urbanized with homes beginning to surround the road again. However, this does not last long, with forests returning once <b>more.</b> <b>Just</b> north of the community, Route434 intersects U.S. Route6.|$|E
5|$|Airfields, harbors and {{shipping}} {{were also the}} targets on October 12, this time in northern Formosa. These {{would be the first}} strikes Fighting 18 executed in the face of both significant anti-aircraft fire and airborne interception by enemy planes. The first fighter sweep of the day launched into overcast skies at 06:17 and headed for Shinchiku Airfield with VF-18 flying low cover. Unfortunately, the Japanese were alerted to the formation's presence ahead of time, and the morning's protective cloud cover dissipated above Shinchiku. Flak of all calibers was intense as a result. Harris and the other Intrepid fighters led the way in, pushing over in glide bombing attacks on hangars around the strip. After the bombs dropped, the fighters headed north for their next target, Matsuyama Airfield. On the way to Matsuyama the cloud cover thickened once <b>more.</b> <b>Just</b> shy of Taien Airfield, VF-18 pilots spotted six Japanese bombers working their way down through a layer of clouds, seemingly on a landing approach. Intrepids fighters caught and destroyed the whole bomber formation in two minutes. Harris was credited with shooting down two of them.|$|E

25|$|In {{an effort}} to make South African courts <b>more</b> <b>just</b> in their convictions, the concept of extenuating {{circumstances}} came into being. However, no concrete definition of extenuating circumstances was ever made. The South African courts began using the testimony of expert social psychologists to define what extenuating circumstances would mean in the justice system. Examples include: deindividuation, bystander apathy, and conformity. In the case of S. vs. Sibisi and Others (1989) eight members of the South African Railways and Harbours Union were involved in the murder of four workers who chose not to join in the SARHWU strike. Psychologists Scott Fraser and Andrew Colman presented evidence for the defense using research from social psychology. Social anthropologist Boet Kotzé provided evidence for the defense as well. He testified that African cultures are characterized by a collective consciousness. Kotzé testified that the collective conscious contributed to the defendants' willingness to act with the group rather than act as individuals. Fraser and Colman stated that bystander apathy, deindividuation, conformity and group polarization were extenuating factors in the killing of the four strike breakers. They explained that deindividuation may affect group members' ability to realize that they are still accountable for their individual actions even when with a group. They also used research on bystander apathy by Latané and Darley to illustrate why four of the eight defendants watched as the other four defendants killed four men. The testimonies of Fraser and Colman helped four of the defendants escape the death penalty.|$|E

25|$|Yifat finally becomes pregnant. Roi {{has turned}} ultra-orthodox {{and has an}} {{arranged}} marriage. Amir quits {{his job as a}} teacher, finds a new one as Reut's secretary and finally receives a lifelong tuition to study in a seminary. Nati has a new roommate, a poet named Azaria, who was abandoned by his fiancée, Tehila. Nati falls in love with Tehila but cannot convince her to see him for she vowed to remain single until Azaria finds a new partner. Nati encourages Reut to date Azaria, who begins to exploit her for her money. After becoming drunk, he confesses that he does not love her and she abandons him. Tehila starts seeing Nati; he is finally ready to commit and proposes to her, and she seems to accept. Hodaya encounters Avri again. He cancels his own planned wedding and asks her to marry him instead. Hodaya backs off once <b>more,</b> <b>just</b> {{a few days before the}} ceremony, leaving him heartbroken. Amir becomes friends with a boy at his yeshiva and goes to work in a ranch in the Negev with him for a few weeks. Hodaya receives a radio show of her own, becomes stressed and quits. Yifat admonishes her for her constant wavering. Tehila speaks with Azaria, and informs Nati they decided to resume their relationship. Nati sinks into depression. Yifat delivers her baby prematurely; Reut and Hodaya stay with her while Nati drives off to fetch Amir. He must stay in the empty ranch while Amir drives back to Jerusalem. Reut comes to bring him back, and they both reconcile while staying in the desert. Hodaya, who heeded Yifat's words, gets her job back and reunites with Avri. Amir and Yifat prepare to take their newborn son home.|$|E

500|$|Goldman {{viewed the}} state as {{essentially}} and inevitably a tool of control and domination. As a result, Goldman believed that voting was useless at best and dangerous at worst. Voting, she wrote, provided an illusion of participation while masking the true structures of decision-making. Instead, Goldman advocated targeted resistance {{in the form of}} strikes, protests, and [...] "direct action against the invasive, meddlesome authority of our moral code". She maintained an anti-voting position even when many anarcho-syndicalists in 1930s Spain voted for the formation of a liberal republic. Goldman wrote that any power anarchists wielded as a voting bloc should instead be used to strike across the country. She disagreed with the movement for women's suffrage, which demanded the right of women to vote. In her essay [...] "Woman Suffrage", she ridicules the idea that women's involvement would infuse the democratic state with a <b>more</b> <b>just</b> orientation: [...] "As if women have not sold their votes, as if women politicians cannot be bought!" [...] She agreed with the suffragists' assertion that women are equal to men, but disagreed that their participation alone would make the state <b>more</b> <b>just.</b> [...] "To assume, therefore, that she would succeed in purifying something which is not susceptible of purification, is to credit her with supernatural powers." ...|$|E

Wade Keller of the Pro Wrestling Torch Newsletter reviewed the matches involved in the tournament.

500|$|The {{reign of}} Æthelstan has been {{overshadowed by the}} {{achievements}} of his grandfather, Alfred the Great, but he is now {{considered one of the}} greatest kings of the West Saxon dynasty. Modern historians endorse the view of twelfth century chronicler William of Malmesbury that [...] "no one <b>more</b> <b>just</b> or more learned ever governed the kingdom". Frank Stenton and Simon Keynes both describe him as the one Anglo-Saxon king who will bear comparison with Alfred. In Keynes's view he [...] "has long been regarded, with good reason, as a towering figure in the landscape of the tenth century... he has also been hailed as the first king of England, as a statesman of international standing". David Dumville describes Æthelstan as [...] "the father of mediaeval and modern England", while Michael Wood regards Offa, Alfred, and Æthelstan as the three greatest Anglo-Saxon kings, and Æthelstan as [...] "one of the more important lay intellectuals in Anglo-Saxon history".|$|E
500|$|Hand {{has been}} {{called one of the}} United States' most {{significant}} judicial philosophers. A leading advocate of judicial restraint, he took seriously Alexander Hamilton's formulation that [...] "the judiciary ...may truly be said to have neither force nor will, but merely judgement." [...] Any judicial ruling that had the effect of legislating from the bench troubled Hand. In 1908, in his article [...] "Due Process of Law and the Eight-Hour Day", he attacked the 1905 Supreme Court ruling in Lochner v. New York, which had struck down a law prohibiting bakery staff from working more than ten hours a day. The Supreme Court went on to strike down a series of similar worker-protective laws {{on the grounds that they}} restricted freedom of contract. Hand regarded this principle as undemocratic. [...] "For the state to intervene", he argued, [...] "to make <b>more</b> <b>just</b> and equal the relative strategic advantages of the two parties to the contract, of whom one is under the pressure of absolute want, while the other is not, is as proper a legislative function as that it should neutralize the relative advantages arising from fraudulent cunning or from superior force." ...|$|E

[...] He also said that after the match settled into [...] "one-on-one action" [...] it [...] "turned into a pretty good match." [...] The final round was seen by Caldwell as [...] "one of those rinse and repeat spot fest matches until Kaz busted out the big double foot stomp on Daivari that popped the crowd."
