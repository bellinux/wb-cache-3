40|$|From {{standardized}} {{contracts for}} loans, repurchase agreements, and derivatives, to stock exchanges and alternative trading platforms, to benchmark interest and foreign exchange rates, private <b>market</b> <b>structures</b> play {{a number of}} important roles within modern financial <b>markets.</b> These <b>market</b> <b>structures</b> hold out a number of significant benefits. Specifically, by harnessing the powerful incentives of market participants, these <b>market</b> <b>structures</b> can help lower information, agency, coordination, and other transaction costs; enhance the process of price discovery, and promote greater market liquidity. Simultaneously, however, successful <b>market</b> <b>structures</b> are the source of significant and often overlooked market distortions. These distortions – or limits of private ordering – stem from positive network externalities, path dependency, and power imbalances between market participants at the core of these <b>market</b> <b>structures</b> and those at the periphery. Somewhat paradoxically, these limits can erect substantial barriers to entry, insulate incumbents from vigorous competition, and undermine the emergence of new and potentially more desirable substitutes: thus entrenching less efficient <b>market</b> <b>structures.</b> Using the London Interbank Offered Rate (Libor) and the International Swaps and Derivatives Association determination committee (DC) mechanism as case studies, this paper seeks to better understand the limits of private ordering. It also explores how relatively modest changes to the public regulatory regimes governing these <b>market</b> <b>structures</b> could, in some cases, yield significant improvements...|$|R

25|$|The city’s oldest <b>market</b> <b>structure</b> {{still in}} use, Hollins Market {{is part of}} the Baltimore public market system that began in 1763. In 1835, the City granted a {{petition}} of piano manufacturer Joseph Newman and “others” to erect a market house at their own expense. Banker George T. Dunbar donated the land which, at that time, was on the western fringe of the city. The doors opened in September 1836 and the market soon became very successful, but the fragile structure blew down in a windstorm two years later. Newman organized the effort to quickly rebuild and re-open the market by the end of 1839. The market was named for John Smith Hollins (1786–1856), an estate owner in West Baltimore and one-term mayor of the city from 1852 to 1854.|$|E
25|$|There are {{two sources}} of {{inefficiency}} in the MC <b>market</b> <b>structure.</b> First, at its optimum output the firm charges {{a price that}} exceeds marginal costs, The MC firm maximizes profits where marginal revenue = marginal cost. Since the MC firm's demand curve is downward sloping {{this means that the}} firm will be charging a price that exceeds marginal costs. The monopoly power possessed by a MC firm means that at its profit maximizing level of production there will be a net loss of consumer (and producer) surplus. The second source of inefficiency is the fact that MC firms operate with excess capacity. That is, the MC firm's profit maximizing output is less than the output associated with minimum average cost. Both a PC and MC firm will operate at a point where demand or price equals average cost. For a PC firm this equilibrium condition occurs where the perfectly elastic demand curve equals minimum average cost. A MC firm’s demand curve is not flat but is downward sloping. Thus in the long run the demand curve will be tangential to the long run average cost curve at a point to the left of its minimum. The result is excess capacity.|$|E

Leaders are always {{more aggressive than}} the followers, independently from strategic substitutability or complementarity. Under quantity competition, leaders produce more than any follower and I determine the conditions for entry-deterrence (high substitutability and non-increasing marginal costs). Under price competition, leaders set lower prices than the followers (the opposite than with an exogenous number of firms). In contests, leaders invest more than each follower. In all these cases a leadership improves the allocation of resources compared to the Nash equilibrium with endogenous entry.
