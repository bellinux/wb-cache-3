50|$|There is an {{apparent}} distinction between general marketing media buyers and direct response media buyers (DRMB). General market media buyers enact or actualize media plans {{drawn up by}} media planners. They negotiate rates and create media schedules based on a media plan constructed by a <b>media</b> <b>planner.</b> Through the <b>media</b> <b>planner,</b> general market media buyers rely on published cost per point guides. An experienced DRMB knows which stations generate a specific quantity of response and knows within reason, the break even point of the expenditure versus the return. With that information, the DRMB is efficient in negotiating a functional rate and in purchasing media from the appropriate stations. The DRMB attaches unique phone numbers to each station they purchase media from and track the sales, and make adjustments to the media plan and schedule as necessary to optimize results. DRMB can be short-form or long-form, although long-form is becoming increasingly unpopular. With these differing methodologies, direct response marketing {{can be considered a}} specialized arena.|$|E

50|$|With {{respect to}} {{frequency}} objectives, the planner must determine the optimal level of frequency {{in order to}} achieve the desired communications objective. <b>Media</b> <b>planners</b> often work with rules of thumb for setting frequency objectives that are based on an extensive body of evidence drawn from research findings. For example, empirical evidence suggests that the average consumer needs to be exposed to a message at least three times before they become aware of the brand information. This is sometimes known as the 3+ Rule. To this basic benchmark of three exposures, <b>media</b> <b>planners</b> recognise that to achieve higher-level communication goals, such as persuasion and lead generation, higher levels of frequency are required. To achieve simple brand awareness, three exposures may be sufficient, but for consumers to act on that awareness, higher levels of exposure may be required. Some theorists have developed sophisticated decision models to assist with planning optimal frequency levels.|$|R

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to note the {{advertising}} business overspending on advertising messages that is often done with minimal consideration to the impact or effects of many consumer exposures. Design/methodology/approach – The paper notes textbooks statement of advertising budget spending as the money needed to attain pragmatic communications goals and compares this to the ongoing business reality of media planning that mostly devolves into maximization of audience exposures to mass media vehicles carrying the brand or company name. Findings – The pragmatic business need is for more questioning the value of media spending, not as return on investment, but how it contributes to overall communications concerns. The <b>media</b> <b>planners</b> dilemma is the uncertainty of the effects of every additional audience exposure, thus (and too often) they take the easy route and simply resolve to purchase as many target audience impressions as possible for as low a price as can be negotiated. Originality/value – This paper asks an important question that many people in the advertising business try to avoid: “Why is so much money being spent?”. While it is difficult to track the impact of every single vehicle placement, the <b>media</b> <b>planners</b> should at least try to question what is the real strategy behind efforts to maximize target audience exposures to vehicles carrying the company logo...|$|R
50|$|With {{reach and}} {{frequency}} objectives firmly in place, the planner turns to determining the media mix and selecting appropriate media vehicles to carry the message. The <b>media</b> <b>planner</b> must determine {{the way that the}} advertising budget is to be allocated across the relevant media options (e.g. 50% TV; 30% Mags; 15% Digital and 5% Out-of-home). To make these decisions, the planner requires a detailed understanding of the target market and its media usage habits. Accordingly, the design of the media channel strategy requires a rich understanding of the media options and what each type of media can accomplish in terms of audience reach and engagement.|$|E

Depending on product and service, Media Buyers and Media Specialists must do a fair amount of research to determine how best to spend the allotted budget. This includes research on the target audience and what type of medium will work best to reach the largest number of consumers with the most effective method. <b>Media</b> <b>planners</b> and <b>media</b> specialists have a vast array of media outlets at their disposal, both traditional media and new media. Traditional media would include radio, TV, magazines, newspapers, and out of home. New media might include satellite TV, cable TV, satellite radio, and internet. The internet offers a number of online media channels that have surfaced with the improvement of technology and the accessibility of the internet. Online Media can include social media, emails, search engines and referral links, web portals, banners, interactive games, and video clips. <b>Media</b> <b>Planners</b> and Specialists can pick and choose what and/or which combination of media is most appropriate and effective to achieve their goal, whether it is to make a sale, and/or to deliver a message or idea.

5000|$|Rushton is {{co-founder and}} CEO of Telemetry, a London-based {{independent}} digital media forensics company, founded with Irwin and Chesluk in 2009. The company has offices in London and New York. Telemetry works with advertisers and agencies, providing impartial, detailed analytics in real time, tracking {{the efficiency and}} exposure gained by online digital advertising campaigns to ensure accountability: that the ads are properly delivered, are being viewed by the intended audience, alongside the proper content, and that reach and impressions are not being inflated. They have advised caution {{when it comes to}} much of the technology used for programmatic buying, which can, for instance, fail to report when ads intended for pre-roll have been placed into oft-muted banner video ads instead. In conceiving the service, Rushton drew on his prior experience as a <b>media</b> <b>planner,</b> where he observed that advertisers had to rely on partisan analytics from the vendor or traditional ad server statistics, which had not been designed to track online ad campaigns. In 2014, Telemetry investigated Verizon Wireless's online video ad purchases, finding that in excess of $1 million was spent on fake Web views. The company in turn demanded make-good ads. Also that year, Telemetry uncovered an ad fraud operation that had been skimming around $10 million in video ad revenue per month, affecting over 75 advertisers, including McDonald's, Coca-Cola and Ford. Rushton called it the most significant instance of ad fraud Telemetry has seen. Telemetry has publicly called out companies perpetrating such fraud by name. The Wall Street Journal reported in 2014 that approximately 36% of all Web traffic is considered fake, with the corresponding amount of ad views being seen by [...] "bots" [...] rather than people, cheating advertisers who pay {{based on the number of}} Web views. In August 2014, Rushton was interviewed by CNN about online advertising fraud moving away from bot fraud, in which a series of fake computers simulate a sentient being watching ads, to a type of fraud involving a genuine audience watching low-quality impressions, which are converted into premium inventory, with the fraudulent impressions sold to large advertisers. Rushton stated that he feels it is the responsibility of the vendors to ensure that the impressions they are trading are genuine impressions.|$|E

ESPITE AN ABUNDANCE of information little dreamed of a decade ago, the <b>media</b> <b>planner</b> still lacks {{some of the basic}} tools he needs. This is particularly true in the case of audience duplication. When a schedule encompasses both print and broadcast media, assessing the number of different people reached is largely a matter of guesswork. Generally, the net coverage o £ print and broadcast are estimated separately. But when it comes to marrying these two parts together, the amount of duplication is either guessed at or ignored. D Moreover, print coverage, based on average-issue readership, ignores the effect of repeat reading of different issues of the same publication. As early as 1953, Alfred Politz demonstrated that this cumulative readership is far from negligible: whereas an average issue of Life was read by 22. 1 percent of individuals, this figure increased to 50. 6 per cent over six issues. It would not be rash to say that most net coverage estimates bear little resemblance to fact. (Note: the word "readership, " used here in the European sense...|$|E
