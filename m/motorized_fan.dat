5|$|In {{starting}} a motor, a VFD initially applies a low frequency and voltage, thus avoiding high inrush current associated with direct-on-line starting. After {{the start of}} the VFD, the applied frequency and voltage are increased at a controlled rate or ramped up to accelerate the load. This starting method typically allows a motor to develop 150% of its rated torque while the VFD is drawing less than 50% of its rated current from the mains in the low-speed range. A VFD can be adjusted to produce a steady 150% starting torque from standstill right up to full speed. However, motor cooling deteriorates and can result in overheating as speed decreases such that prolonged low-speed operation with significant torque is not usually possible without separately <b>motorized</b> <b>fan</b> ventilation.|$|E
50|$|FFUs are {{typically}} manufactured in 4' x 2', 3' x 2', or 2' x 2' steel housings, {{which can be}} placed in ceiling grid bays of similar dimensions. Units often contain a pre-filter {{as well as a}} HEPA (high-efficiency particulate air), ULPA (ultra-low particulate air) or other MERV (minimum efficiency reporting value) filter. A <b>motorized</b> <b>fan</b> is used to pull air through the filters for distribution to rooms or enclosed work stations such as hoods. Fan speed is typically controlled via a step-wise or rheostat motor adjustment. Desired cleanliness levels determine the filter used: HEPA filters remove particles 0.3 um or larger at 99.99% efficiency, while ULPA filters remove particles 0.12 um or larger at 99.999% efficiency. FFUs are engineered for laminar air flow, as is required in critical environments. Controlled air flowing in a uniform direction and speed (carrying microparticles) is cleaner than turbulent air that flows in multiple directions or at inconsistent speeds. Eddies created by turbulent air cause contaminating microparticles to settle on clean surfaces.|$|E
50|$|A {{condenser}} unit used in central {{air conditioning systems}} typically has a heat exchanger section to cool down and condense incoming refrigerant vapor into liquid, a compressor to raise {{the pressure of the}} refrigerant and move it along, and a fan for blowing outside air through the heat exchanger section to cool the refrigerant inside. A typical configuration of such a {{condenser unit}} is as follows: The heat exchanger section wraps around the sides of the unit with the compressor inside. In this heat exchanger section, the refrigerant goes through multiple tube passes, which are surrounded by heat transfer fins through which cooling air can move from outside to inside the unit. There is a <b>motorized</b> <b>fan</b> inside the condenser unit near the top, which is covered by some grating to keep any objects from accidentally falling inside on the fan. The fan is used to blow the outside cooling air in through the heat exchange section at the sides and out the top through the grating. These condenser units are located {{on the outside of the}} building they are trying to cool, with tubing between the unit and building, one for vapor refrigerant entering and another for liquid refrigerant leaving the unit. Of course, an electric power supply is needed for the compressor and fan inside the unit.|$|E
40|$|Typical home comfort systems utilize only {{rudimentary}} {{forms of}} energy management and conservation. The most sophisticated technology in common use today is an automatic setback thermostat. Tremendous potential remains for improving the e ciency of electric and gas usage. However, home residents who are ignorant of the physics of energy utilization cannot design environmental control strategies, but neither can energy management experts who are ignorant of the behavior patterns of the inhabitants. Adaptive control seems the only alternative. We have begun building an adaptive control system that can infer appropriate rules of operation for home comfort systems based on the lifestyle of the inhabitants and energy conservation goals. Recent research has demonstrated the potential of neural networks for intelligent control. We are constructing a prototype control system in an actual residence using neural network reinforcement learning and prediction techniques. The residence is equipped with sensors {{to provide information about}} environmental conditions (e. g., temperatures, ambient lighting level, sound and motion in each room) and actuators to control the gas furnace, electric space heaters, gas hot water heater, lighting, <b>motorized</b> blinds, ceiling <b>fans,</b> and dampers in the heating ducts. This paper presents an overview of the project as it now stands. ...|$|R
