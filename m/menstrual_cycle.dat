5|$|As {{measured}} on women undergoing in vitro fertilization, a longer <b>menstrual</b> <b>cycle</b> length {{is associated with}} higher pregnancy and delivery rates, even after age adjustment. Delivery rates after IVF have been estimated to be almost doubled for women with a <b>menstrual</b> <b>cycle</b> length of more than 34 days compared with women with a <b>menstrual</b> <b>cycle</b> length shorter than 26 days. A longer <b>menstrual</b> <b>cycle</b> length is also significantly associated with better ovarian response to gonadotropin stimulation and embryo quality.|$|E
5|$|Even {{though the}} average length of the human <b>menstrual</b> <b>cycle</b> {{is similar to that of}} the lunar cycle, in modern humans there is no {{relation}} between the two. The relationship is believed to be a coincidence. Light exposure does not appear to affect the <b>menstrual</b> <b>cycle</b> in humans. A meta-analysis of studies from 1996 showed no correlation between the human <b>menstrual</b> <b>cycle</b> and the lunar cycle.|$|E
5|$|The {{different}} {{phases of}} the <b>menstrual</b> <b>cycle</b> correlate with women’s moods. In some cases, hormones released during the <b>menstrual</b> <b>cycle</b> can cause behavioral changes in females; mild to severe mood changes can occur. The <b>menstrual</b> <b>cycle</b> phase and ovarian hormones may contribute to increased empathy in women. The natural shift of hormone levels during the different {{phases of the}} <b>menstrual</b> <b>cycle</b> has been studied in conjunction with test scores. When completing empathy exercises, women in the follicular stage of their <b>menstrual</b> <b>cycle</b> performed better than women in their midluteal phase. A significant correlation between progesterone levels {{and the ability to}} accurately recognize emotion was found. Performances on emotion recognition tasks were better when women had lower progesterone levels. Women in the follicular stage showed higher emotion recognition accuracy than their midluteal phase counterparts. Women were found to react more to negative stimuli when in midluteal stage over the women in the follicular stage, perhaps indicating more reactivity to social stress during that <b>menstrual</b> <b>cycle</b> phase. Overall, it has been found that women in the follicular phase demonstrated better performance in tasks that contain empathetic traits.|$|E
5000|$|Cutler and Law {{hypothesized}} that menstrual synchrony {{is caused by}} <b>menstrual</b> <b>cycles</b> synchronizing with lunar phases. However, neither of them agree on what phase of the lunar <b>cycle</b> <b>menstrual</b> <b>cycles</b> synchronize with. Cutler hypothesizes the synchronization with the full moon and Law with the new moon. [...] Neither offer hypotheses regarding how lunar phases cause menstrual synchrony and neither are consistent with previous studies that found no relationship between <b>menstrual</b> <b>cycles</b> and lunar cycles. More recently, Strassmann investigated menstrual synchrony among Dogon village women. The women were outdoors most nights {{and did not have}} electrical lighting. She {{hypothesized that}} Dogon women would be ideal for detecting a lunar influence on <b>menstrual</b> <b>cycles,</b> but she found no relationship.|$|R
50|$|Research {{has also}} found that <b>menstrual</b> <b>cycles</b> affect sexual {{behaviour}} frequency in pre-menopausal women. For example, women who had weekly sexual intercourse with men had <b>menstrual</b> <b>cycles</b> with the average duration of 29 days, while women with less frequent sexual interactions tended to have more extreme cycle lengths.|$|R

5|$|The average <b>menstrual</b> <b>cycle</b> lasts 28 days. The {{variability}} of <b>menstrual</b> <b>cycle</b> lengths is highest for women under 25 {{years of age}} and is lowest, that is, most regular, for ages 25 to 39. Subsequently, the variability increases slightly for women aged 40 to 44.|$|E
5|$|Fear {{response}} in women during two {{different points in}} the <b>menstrual</b> <b>cycle</b> has been examined. When estrogen is highest in the preovulatory stage, women are significantly better at identifying expressions of fear than women who were menstruating, which is when estrogen levels are lowest. The women were equally able to identify happy faces, demonstrating that the fear response was a more powerful response. To summarize, <b>menstrual</b> <b>cycle</b> phase and the estrogen levels correlates with women’s fear processing.|$|E
5|$|Females {{have been}} found to {{experience}} different eating habits at different stages of their <b>menstrual</b> <b>cycle,</b> with food intake being higher during the luteal phase than the follicular phase. Food intake increases by approximately 10% during the luteal phase compared to the follicular phase.|$|E

5|$|After {{menstruation}} {{and directly}} {{under the influence of}} estrogen, the cervix undergoes a series of changes in position and texture. During most of the <b>menstrual</b> <b>cycle,</b> the cervix remains firm, and is positioned low and closed. However, as ovulation approaches, the cervix becomes softer and rises to open in response to the higher levels of estrogen present. These changes are also accompanied by changes in cervical mucus, described below.|$|E

5|$|If the TSH {{level is}} normal or low and serum free T4 levels are low, this is suggestive of central {{hypothyroidism}} (not enough TSH or TRH secretion by the pituitary gland or hypothalamus).

There might also be symptoms of a pituitary mass such as headaches and vision changes. Central hypothyroidism should be investigated further to determine the underlying cause.|$|E
5|$|The luteal {{phase of}} the <b>menstrual</b> <b>cycle</b> {{is about the same}} length in most {{individuals}} (mean 14.13 days, SD 1.41 days) whereas the follicular phase tends to show much more variability (log-normally distributed with 95% of individuals having follicular phases between 10.3 and 16.3 days). The follicular phase also seems to get significantly shorter with age (geometric mean 14.2 days in women aged 18–24 vs. 10.4 days in women aged 40–44).|$|E
50|$|Jarett's {{study was}} the third to attempt to {{replicate}} McClintock's original study using college roommates. There were 144 women who attended two colleges. The women were 17 to 22 years old and the procedures followed were similar to McClintock's study except only pairs of roommates were used. She reported that the women did not synchronize. Jarett concluded that whether menstrual synchrony occurs {{in a group of}} women may depend on the variability of their <b>menstrual</b> <b>cycles.</b> She conjectured that the reason the women in her study did not synchronize their <b>menstrual</b> <b>cycles</b> was because they happened to have longer and more irregular <b>menstrual</b> <b>cycles</b> than in McClintock's original study.|$|R

5|$|The <b>menstrual</b> <b>cycle</b> can be {{described}} by the ovarian or uterine cycle. The ovarian cycle describes changes {{that occur in the}} follicles of the ovary whereas the uterine cycle describes changes in the endometrial lining of the uterus. Both cycles can be divided into three phases. The ovarian cycle consists of the follicular phase, ovulation, and the luteal phase whereas the uterine cycle consists of menstruation, proliferative phase, and secretory phase.|$|E

In one study, {{a small group of}} females with apthous stomatitis had fewer occurrences of aphthous ulcers during the luteal phase of the <b>menstrual</b> <b>cycle</b> or with use of the contraceptive pill. This phase is associated with a fall in progestogen levels, mucosal proliferation and keratinization. This subgroup often experiences remission during pregnancy. However, other studies report no correlation between aphthous stomatitis and menstrual period, pregnancy or menopause.|$|E
5|$|Members of {{the faith}} are {{defensive}} {{of the fact that}} some practices seem to restrict women and make gender equality in leadership impossible. They are only permitted to enter special sections of the temple reserved for women or have to go to separate women's temples. As with practices of niddah in Orthodox Judaism, concepts of pollution associated with the <b>menstrual</b> <b>cycle</b> lead to the exclusion of women from the temples and daily worship during the affected time. Swaminarayan also directed male devotees not to listen to religious discourses given by women.|$|E

40|$|Research {{over the}} past 15 years indicates, {{contrary}} to earlier results, that women do not synchronize their <b>menstrual</b> <b>cycles.</b> If women do not synchronize their cycles, this implies there is no mechanism for synchronizing cycles. Since a pheromone mechanism of synchronization is the only plausible mechanism that has been pro-posed, it follows that {{that there are no}} pheromones that modulate the length of men-strual cycles. To test this hypothesis, eight studies were reviewed that reported pheromone effects on <b>menstrual</b> <b>cycles,</b> other behavior, or physiological correlates in women. The prediction was that serious problems would be found in each of these studies. As predicted, serious problems were found in all eight studies. Taken to-gether, these results cast doubt on the existence of pheromones that modulate the length of <b>menstrual</b> <b>cycles.</b> KEY WORDS: Human pheromones; Menstrual cycles; Menstrual synchrony; Sexual behavior Yang and Schank (2006) and Ziomkewicz (2006) in this issue of Human Naturefound that women did not synchronize their <b>menstrual</b> <b>cycles.</b> Both articles attributed non-synchrony to cycle variability.

5|$|The {{different}} levels of ovarian hormones {{at different stages of}} the cycle have been used to explain eating behaviour changes. Progesterone has been shown to promote fat storage, causing a higher intake of fatty foods during the luteal phase when progesterone levels are higher. Additionally, with a high estrogen level dopamine is ineffective in converting to noradrenaline, a hormone which promotes eating, therefore decreasing appetite. In humans, the level of these ovarian hormones during the <b>menstrual</b> <b>cycle</b> have been found to influence binge eating.|$|E
5|$|Various {{studies have}} shown that during the luteal phase woman consume more carbohydrates, {{proteins}} and fats and that 24-hour energy expenditure shows increases between 2.5-11.5%. The increasing intake during the luteal phase may be related to higher preferences for sweet and fatty foods, which occurs naturally and is enhanced during the luteal phases of the <b>menstrual</b> <b>cycle.</b> This is due to the higher metabolic demand during this phase. In particular, women tend to show a cravings for chocolate, with higher cravings during the luteal phase.|$|E
5|$|While {{some forms}} of birth control do not affect the <b>menstrual</b> <b>cycle,</b> {{hormonal}} contraceptives work by disrupting it. Progestogen negative feedback decreases the pulse frequency of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) release by the hypothalamus, which decreases the release of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) by the anterior pituitary. Decreased levels of FSH inhibit follicular development, preventing an increase in estradiol levels. Progestogen negative feedback {{and the lack of}} estrogen positive feedback on LH release prevent a mid-cycle LH surge. Inhibition of follicular development and the absence of a LH surge prevent ovulation.|$|E
