25|$|Both PS and phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) can {{regulate}} membrane <b>mechanical</b> <b>function,</b> due {{to their}} interactions with skeletal proteins such as spectrin and protein 4.1R.

PIP2 enhances the binding of protein band 4.1R to glycophorin C but decreases its interaction with protein band 3, and thereby may modulate the linkage of the bilayer to the membrane skeleton.|$|E
2500|$|Realizing the {{necessity}} of testing and evaluating the B-36 Peacemaker's APG-3 radar tail turret system, Headquarters, United States Air Force, directed the 7th Bomb Wing to undertake testing. The APG-3 was a radar airborne gun sighting system that provided for aircraft detection and automatic fire control of the tail-turret guns, designed to detect and automatically track targets up to 5,000 yards in range on fighter-type aircraft. However, {{it was possible to}} extend that search range temporarily on fighters. After a particular target had been selected by the gunner-radar operator, the system automatically tracked the target within its angular limits in both range and direction. Also, the system automatically directed and pointed the gun turret in the correct firing position. The only <b>mechanical</b> <b>function</b> of the gunner was the activation of the firing mechanism when the target was in effective firing range. One B-36B, 44-92042, of the 26th Bomb Squadron, 11th Bomb Group, was modified for testing as the right gun on the APG-3 was removed and a 35mm Vitarama camera installed in lieu of the turret. The first mission was flown on 25 October 1949, over Eglin AFB Gunnery Range, at [...] Three passes were made on the tail position by two Lockheed F-80 Shooting Stars. Following those passes the APG-3 radar system failed. The malfunction of the radar system was due to low voltage transmitted to the modular and to an antenna tilt motor failure.|$|E

40|$|This book {{describes}} how surface tension {{effects can be}} used by engineers to provide <b>mechanical</b> <b>functions</b> in miniaturized products (< 1 mm). Even if precursors of this field such as Jurin or Laplace already date back to the 18 th century, describing surface tension effects from a mechanical perspective is very recent. The originality of this book is to consider the effects of capillary bridges on solids, including forces and torques exerted both statically and dynamically by the liquid along the 6 degrees-of-freedom. It provides a comprehensive approach to various applications, such as capillary adhesion (axial force), centering force in packaging and micro-assembly (lateral force) and recent developments such as a capillary motor (torque). It devises how surface tension can be used to provide <b>mechanical</b> <b>functions</b> such as actuation (bubble-actuated compliant table), sealing and tightness, energy harvesting, nanodispending. 0 info:eu-repo/semantics/published...|$|R

Methods: Thirty-five non-diabetic, normotensive HD patients and 35 healthy control subjects were enrolled in the study.

Results: Interatrial and left-right intraatrial-EMD intervals and left atrial mechanical volumes were significantly longer in hemodialysis group compared to controls (all pp were independent predictors of interatrial-EMD. Conclusions: The present study confirms negative effects in HD patients of structural remodeling and reveals negative effects of electrical remodeling.

40|$|Background: The close {{subcellular}} {{proximity of}} different actin filament crosslinking proteins {{suggests that these}} proteins may cooperate to organize F-actin structures to drive complex cellular functions during cell adhesion, motility and division. Here we hypothesize that a-actinin and filamin, two major F-actin crosslinking proteins that are both present in the lamella of adherent cells, display synergistic <b>mechanical</b> <b>functions.</b> Methodology/Principal Findings: Using quantitative rheology, we find that combining a-actinin and filamin is much more effective at producing elastic, solid-like actin filament networks than a-actinin and filamin separately. Moreover, F-actin networks assembled {{in the presence of}} a-actinin and filamin strain-harden more readily than networks in the presence of either a-actinin or filamin. Significance: These results suggest that cells combine auxiliary proteins with similar ability to crosslink filaments to generate stiff cytoskeletal structures, which are required for the production of internal propulsive forces for cell migration, and that these proteins do not have redundant <b>mechanical</b> <b>functions...</b>|$|R
