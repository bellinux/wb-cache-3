5|$|Bach {{structured}} the cantata in five movements, {{an instrumental}} sinfonia and two choral movements framing two arias, one for soprano (S), {{the other a}} duet for tenor (T) and bass (B). As in Bach's other early cantatas, there are no recitatives. Besides the three solo voices, Bach scored the work for a four-part choir and a Baroque instrumental ensemble of two violins (Vl), viola (Va), cello (Vc), bass (violone) and continuo, as {{a copy of the}} score from around 1731 by Johann Ludwig Dietel, a student of Bach, shows. The duration has been given as 10 minutes and the <b>main</b> <b>key</b> as C major.|$|E
5|$|Of all {{the strains}} in the piece, the final D strain {{is perhaps the}} most interesting. It is written in B-flat minor. When Joplin used minor keys in the {{previous}} sections, he used the relative key of G minor (i.e., relative to the <b>main</b> <b>key</b> of B-flat major). However, in this fourth section, he instead used the parallel key. This strain also features sections where the right hand and left hand play notes in unison, and in which the standard 2/4 time left-hand beat is noticeably absent.|$|E
5|$|As a junior, Watts {{played in}} the forward line as a strong-marking tall and was an {{accurate}} shot on goal. Regarded as an incredibly quick player for his height, especially over the first twenty metres, his speed and athleticism saw him dominate in the forward line as a junior. After struggling to replicate his form from the juniors in the AFL, he was trialled as a defender in 2011 by then senior-coach, Dean Bailey, playing primarily as the loose man in defence. Bailey intended on using him as both a defender and forward; he recognised Watts {{would not be the}} <b>main</b> <b>key</b> forward at the club, which was intended when he was drafted, but when playing in the forward line, he would instead be used as a floating forward. He played a new role in 2012 under Mark Neeld in defence, where he was highly praised for his ability to read the play and take intercept marks. He played in defence for the duration of Neeld's tenure, until Neeld was sacked and replaced by Neil Craig in the middle of 2013 with Craig electing to return Watts to the forward line. After playing in the forward line and in defence, incoming coach in 2014, Paul Roos, saw an opportunity for Watts to play in the midfield due to his body size and elite kicking, in addition to the club needing an influx of midfielders. After the desperate need for midfielders dissipated, Watts returned to a half-forward role in the middle of 2014; he played as a half-forward throughout Roos' coaching term and was used as a back-up ruckman in 2016.|$|E

5|$|Charles Fisk, also {{a pianist}} and music scholar, has {{described}} another cyclic element in Schubert's last sonatas – a unifying tonal design, which follows a similar, basic dramatic scheme {{in each of}} the three works. According to Fisk, each sonata presents at its very beginning, the generative kernel of a musical conflict from which all the ensuing music will derive. The first movement, beginning and ending in the sonata's home key, confronts this key with a contrasting tonality or tonal stratum. This dichotomous tonal design is also manifested in both third and final movements, whose openings are variants of the first movement's opening. Moreover, the contrasting tonality becomes the <b>main</b> <b>key</b> of the second movement, thus increasing the harmonic tension in the middle of the sonata, while projecting the first movement's tonal design (home key – contrasting tonality – home key) on the sonata as a whole. In the first half of each sonata, the musical material in the contrasting tonality is presented in sharp conflict with the material in the home key – in each appearance boldly detached from its surroundings. However, in the third movements and especially in the finales, this contrasting tonal realm is gradually integrated into its environment, bringing a sense of unity and resolution to the tonal conflict which was presented at the beginning of the sonata. Fisk goes further to interpret the dramatic musical scheme manifested in the tonal design of the sonatas, as the basis of a unique psychological narrative (see below).|$|E

5000|$|The Casio Casiotone MT-40 is an {{electronic}} keyboard, formerly produced by Casio and originally {{developed for the}} consumer market. It has 37 <b>main</b> <b>keys</b> and 15 smaller bass keys, with 9-voice polyphony: eight notes may be played on the <b>main</b> <b>keys,</b> and one note on the bass. The bass section has one timbre, and the main section has 22, assignable to one of four presets.

Gaga stated that the lyrics of [...] "Eh, Eh (Nothing Else I Can Say)" [...] are about love and she explained that [...] "'Eh, Eh' is my simple pop song about finding someone new and breaking up with the old boyfriend." [...] Writer James E.

Although the lyrics explained her former lover that she had found someone new and did not mean to hurt him with the news, the continuous repetition of the phrase [...] "nothing else I can say" [...] solidifies the transient nature of the relationship portrayed. According to the sheet music published at Musicnotes.com by Sony/ATV Music Publishing, the song is set in the time signature of common time with a moderate tempo of 94 beats per minute. Gaga's vocal range spans from B3 to C5 with the <b>main</b> <b>key</b> in which the song is set being E major. The song follows in the chord progression of E–B–Fm–E–B–Fm.

500|$|The two kingdoms {{were based}} upon {{different}} cultures: Hoshido was themed after Japan, while Nohr used a Medieval European setting similar to earlier Fire Emblem games. The kingdoms of Hoshido and Nohr {{were designed to}} contrast {{each other in a}} variety of ways, with the most obvious being its architecture: Hoshido was themed around light and air, while Nohr was themed around darkness and stone. When development first started, the team unanimously decided to ask Kozaki to return as character designer, as he had been for Awakening. The sheer number of characters this approach entailed made the staff worry about whether Kozaki would be willing to return. The Hoshido characters' clothing were influenced by Japanese culture and character designs drew inspiration from well-known people in Japan: a main instance was Ryoma, whose clothing was based on samurai, including historical figures such as Takeda Shingen, along with incorporating animal motifs such as lions. The colors used in their clothing were varied and mainly bright to emphasize the country's focus on light. For Nohr, a [...] "vampire-like taste" [...] equivalent to dark fantasy was used to highlight it as a kingdom where the sun did not shine. Kozaki used black and purple as key colors in character designs to create a cold and unified image. The nobility of Nohr were given similar design elements to represent their familial connections. The first character Kozaki designed was the Avatar. Kozaki did not put much thought into their general appearance, but took care about their clothing so that it was not overtly styled after either Hoshido or Nohr, keeping the neutrality of the player up to the main story decision point. They were given bare feet due to the animalistic impression Kozaki had after hearing of their strong ties to dragons, along with creating a [...] "hook" [...] for players equivalent to other characters in the game. The <b>main</b> <b>key</b> artwork, showing the two families together, was described by Kozaki as [...] "a pain to draw" [...] due to their clashing designs, and was the point of much discussion by staff before it was finalized. Azura was not included in artwork for the two physical editions, but she was more prominently presented in artwork surrounding Revelation as she played a much larger role in the story.|$|E

2500|$|However, this {{campaign}} did no go as expected, the Legal Adviser of the Department of State {{did not support}} the notion that the Commonwealth could be an [...] "inalterable pact" [...] that could only be modified by mutual consent, recognizing the fact that Congress -as the holder of Puerto Rico's sovereignty- was capable of doing so unilaterally. This development triggered a sharp turn in Muñoz's ideology and strategy, which would lead to efforts to ensure that the Commonwealth's development was to be through its full sovereignty. This placed him in the same line of Fernós {{for the first time in}} years. The strategy of both leaders would now be focused on acquiring concrete changes, instead of pushing partial measures. On February 10, 1961, Fernós noted that the Commonwealth, as it stood, had an absence of democracy and shortly afterwards created another plan in line with the Fernós-Murray Project. Despite all if the failed efforts, he still believed that the Commonwealth should mirror the relation of Canada and the United Kingdom and this was the right time to launch a pro-sovereignty campaign. The new plan became known as the Aspinall Project and its <b>main</b> <b>key</b> difference to the Fernós-Murray Project was that in order to be implemented, the Senate was to renounce to all of the Commonwealth's sovereignty, resulting in the momentary creation of a Republic of Puerto Rico, which would then negotiate with Congress directly. This concept, known then as the [...] "culminated" [...] or [...] "perfected Estado Libre Asociado" [...] was consistent with the definition of free association approved by the United Nations on December 14, 1960, through [...] UN General Assembly Resolution 1514 (XV).
