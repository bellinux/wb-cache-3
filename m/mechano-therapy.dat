50|$|The {{first floor}} {{contains}} the marble-walled lobby, flanked by terra cotta fountains, which has stained glass clerestory windows and ceramic tile flooring. In {{the vicinity of}} the lobby desk are a check room, attendant dispatch room, and elevators. The north and central portions of the building house the men's facilities: cooling room, pack room, steam room, hydrotherapy room, and bath hall. The women's facilities, considerably smaller in size, are {{at the south end of}} the building. Originally there was a 30 tub capacity. Although the men's and women's bath halls both have stained glass windows in aquatic motifs, the most impressive stained glass is the massive skylight in the men's area, with the DeSoto fountain centered on the floor directly below it. The second floor originally had dressing rooms, lockers, cooling rooms, and massage and <b>mechano-therapy</b> departments; now it is largely occupied by wood changing stalls, with entry to a centrally located quarry-tile courtyard for sunbathing. The third floor houses a massive ceramic-tiled Hubbard Currence therapeutic tub (a full body immersion whirlpool installed in 1938 when other hydrotherapeutic pools were also added), areas for men' s and women' s parlors, and a wood panelled gymnasium to the rear. The most impressive space on the third floor is the assembly room (now museum) where the segmentally arched vaults of the ceiling are filled in with arched, stained glass skylights. Arched wood-frame doors surrounded by fanlights and sidelights open out to the small balconies of the front elevation. The basement houses various mechanical equipment, a bowling alley (since removed), and the Fordyce spring - a glazed tile room with an arched ceiling and a plate glass window covering over the natural hot spring (spring number 46).|$|E
40|$|Abstract INTRODUCTION: Narrow airway {{dimensions}} due to mandibular deficiency can predispose {{an individual}} to severe respiratory distress. Hence, treatment with mandibular advancement devices {{at an early age}} might help improving the pharyngeal passage and reduce the risk of respiratory difficulties. Therefore, the aim of the current study was to evaluate the mean changes in the pharyngeal dimensions of children with mandibular deficiency treated with Clark 2 ̆ 7 s twin-block appliance (CTB) followed by fixed orthodontic treatment. METHODS: Orthodontic records of 42 children with mandibular deficiency were selected. Records comprised three lateral cephalograms taken at the start of CTB treatment, after CTB removal {{and at the end of}} fixed appliance treatment, and were compared with 32 controls from the Bolton-Brush study. Friedman test was used to compare pre-treatment, mid-treatment and post-treatment pharyngeal dimensions. Wilcoxon signed rank test was used to compare the airway between pre-treatment and post follow-up controls. Mann-Whitney U test was applied to compare the mean changes in pharyngeal dimensions between treatment group and controls from T 2 to T 0. Post-hoc Dunnet T 3 test was used for multiple comparisons of treatment outcomes after CTB and fixed appliances, taking a p-value of ≤ 0. 05 as statistically significant. RESULTS: Superior pharyngeal space (p 3 ̆c 0. 001) and upper airway thickness (p = 0. 035) were significantly increased after CTB, and the change in superior pharyngeal space remained stable after fixed <b>mechano-therapy.</b> CONCLUSION: CTB can have a positive effect in improving pharyngeal space and the resultant increase in airway remains stable on an average of two and a half years...|$|E
30|$|Mechanical {{stimulation}} {{may offer}} {{a simple and}} effective approach to enhance skeletal muscle regeneration. Stretch activation, mechanical conditioning but also massage therapy or physical manipulation of injured skeletal muscles have shown multiple benefit effects on muscle biology and function in vitro and in vivo (Tatsumi et al. 2001);(Best et al. 2012) (Crane et al. 2012; Kumar et al. 2002; Gilbert et al. 2010; Powell et al. 2002). Recently, Cezar and colleagues demonstrates that mechanical forces are as important biological regulators as chemicals and genes, and underlines the immense potential of developing <b>mechano-therapies</b> to treat muscle damage (Cezar et al. 2016). A recent study also demonstrated that a treatment based on ultrasound-guided intra-tissue percutaneous electrolysis (EPI technique) enhances the treatment of muscle injuries (Abat et al. 2015). Altogether, {{these results suggest that}} mechanical stimulation should be considered as a possible therapy to improve muscle regeneration and repair.|$|R
