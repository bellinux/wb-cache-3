40|$|Precise {{dispensing}} of microdroplets is {{an important}} process for droplet-based microfluidics. The dropletformation by shear force between two immiscible fluids depends on their flow rates, the viscosities, and the interfacial tension. In this letter, the authors report the use of integrated microheater and temperature sensor for controlling the dropletformation process. The technique exploits the dependency on temperature of viscosities and interfacial tension. Using a relatively low heating temperature ranging from 25 to 70 °C, the droplet diameter can be adjusted to over two times of its original value. The relatively low temperature range <b>makes</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> concept is applicable for droplets containing biological samples...|$|R

Image deduplication technology is proposed to reduce the storage space and costs. To protect the confidentiality of the image, the notion of convergent encryption has been proposed.

In an interview with Rolling Stone, Shakira said that specifically chose the studio after she learned that it had previously been used for recording sessions by artists like Bob Marley, The Cure, and AC/DC, of whom she is a fan.

50|$|The Figure Geo Warping Grid {{depicts the}} {{solution}} to the problem. The circular radar coverage area is divided into a circular grid. Only the corner points of the grid are geo warped which drastically reduces the computation time. Coordinates within a grid tile are computed by a weighted bilinear interpolation of the grid corner points.As geographical projections are typically non-linear functions this introduces a certain error for the radar video display position. Keeping this error sufficiently below the radar measurement resolution <b>makes</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> is no restriction for the radar video display quality. The grid tile size has to be computed once for a radar position and a given projection. Thus, the grid is typically computed once for a static radar and only more often for moving radars e.g. on ships.|$|R

McClintock and four other senators won in San Juan Superior Court a suit to nullify the sanctions and expulsions that the party leadership has levied against them. The Puerto Rico Supreme Court confirmed the lower court decision by a 5-to-1 vote. As a result, McClintock and his supporters were recognized as NPP members and free to run under the party banner.

Rosselló admitted defeat even before the votes were completely tallied claiming Fortuño as the next candidate of the PNP party. In Rosselló's conceding speech he said [...] "Luis Fortuño has been selected by the people to be the new president of this party and the candidate for governor.

50|$|In {{practice}} {{systems with}} parameter determination require considerable {{time to find}} an optimum tuning, i.e. time necessary for self-tuning in such systems is bounded from below. Self-tuning systems without parameter determination do not have this disadvantage. In such systems, some characteristic of control quality is used (e.g., the first time derivative of a controlled parameter). Automatic tuning <b>makes</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> characteristic is kept within given bounds. Different self-tuning systems without parameter determination exist {{that are based on}} controlling transitional processes, frequency characteristics, etc. All of those are examples of closed-circuit self-tuning systems, whereby parameters are automatically corrected every time the quality characteristic value falls outside the allowable bounds. In contrast, open-circuit self-tuning systems are systems with para-metrical compensation, whereby input signal itself is controlled and system parameters are changed according to a specified procedure. This type of self-tuning can be close to instantaneous. However, in order to realise such self-tuning one needs to control the environment in which the system operates and a good enough understanding of how the environment influences the controlled system is required.|$|R

Three games were analyzed during the tournamentselection for the European Futsal Championship in 2010. Spreadsheets were used as data collection instrument, and the applied method was descriptive observational analysis. The Portuguese team carried out a total of 167 finalizations; 95 finalizations (56. 89 %) were originated from the organized game (OG) actions, 29 finalizations(17. 36 %) were from counterattack actions (CA) and 43 finalizations (25. 75 %) were from Stopped Ball (SB) actions. Analyzing the obtained results in these actions, 13 finalizations (7. 78 %) resulted in scored goals, 4 finalizations (2. 20 %) resulted in balls on crossbar, 55 finalizations (32. 94 %) were defended by the opponent goalkeeper, 56 finalizations (33. 53 %) were intercepted by the opponent player and 39 finalizations (23. 35 %) went outside the sideline.

They have different histories. They have {{given rise to}} different beliefs, cultures and institutions which impart diametrically opposite world-outlooks and missions to their peoples. Their sensibilities differ, so do their views concerning their relationship and encounter with each other in history. To Europe, Africa is a source of ‘raw materials’ and Africans a source of cheap labour for white business enterprises. Part of Europe’s fulfilment and business realizations in Africa, come out of maintaining this master-servant relationship between whites and blacks. Europe <b>makes</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> relationship goes on until it begins to look {{as if it were the}} natural order of things. In order to achieve this impression and conviction in Africans, it is therefore, necessary for Europe to destroy African history, culture, institutions and all traces of evidence which may indicate to Africans that they have not always been slaves of Europeans but masters of their own destiny. That way, the present set-up where the black man is servant of the white man can then continue without challenge, as if ordained. The task before us then, as Africans, is to revisit our history and reconstruct it in order to rediscover the truth it contains about our immense ability to forge ahead as masters of our own lives.
