The hidden danger of coal spontaneous combustion is predicted by observing and analyzing those features, synthesizing its features and the differences at the different stage of development, so that it can provide reliable guidance to prevent underground spontaneous fire. The study of indicator gases to forecast and predict coal spontaneous combustion is more and more important to prevent the spontaneous combustion. For this reason, the paper, according to the indicator gases and critical value, systematically introduces the technology of predicting the hidden danger of underground coal spontaneous combustion such as detecting the carbon monoxide concentration, chromatographing the gas composition, detecting the coal temperature and infrared radiation detection analysis, which provides the guidance for the prediction of the coal spontaneous combustion...|$|E

A low molecular hydrophilic compound, sodium fluorescein (FL) (MW, 376 Da), was used for comparison. FL penetrated the stratum corneum and permeated the viable epidermis of hairless rat skin, whereas less permeation of FL was observed through the cultured skin model, suggesting that the primary permeation pathway for the hydrophilic material may be skin appendages through the rat skin.

Some of polysaccharides have been marketed in China as drugs or healthy products.

40|$|This review {{outlines}} the new developments on chitosan-based bioapplications. Over the last decade, functional biomaterials research has developed new drug delivery systems and improved scaffolds for regenerative medicine {{that is currently}} {{one of the most}} rapidly growing fields in the life sciences. The aim is to restore or replace damaged body parts or lost organs by transplanting supportive scaffolds with appropriate cells that in combination with biomolecules generate new tissue. This is a highly interdisciplinary field that encompasses polymer synthesis and modification, cell culturing, gene therapy, stem cell research, therapeutic cloning and tissue engineering. In this regard, chitosan, as a biopolymer derived <b>macromolecular</b> <b>compound,</b> has a major involvement. Chitosan is a polyelectrolyte with reactive functional groups, gel-forming capability, high adsorption capacity and biodegradability. In addition, it is innately biocompatible and non-toxic to living tissues as well as having antibacterial, antifungal and antitumor activity. These features highlight the suitability and extensive applications that chitosan has in medicine.

Intraperitoneal administration of 0. 4 g/kg Triton WR- 1339 to rats infected with T. brucei {{led to the development}} of a large vacuole in the trypanosomes between nucleus and kinetoplast within 22 h. Higher doses (2 g/kg) led to the disappearance of the trypanosomes from the blood and resulted in permanent cures (greater than 100 days). Lysosomes isolated from the trypanosomes of animals treated with a sub-curative dose showed a decrease in equilibrium density of 0. 03 g/cm 3 in sucrose gradients. These lysosomes were partly damaged as evidenced by a reduction in latency and an increase in the non-sedimentable part of lysosomal enzymes. We conclude that acid proteinase and alpha-mannosidase-containing organelles of T. brucei take up exogenous macromolecules and must therefore be considered as true lysosomes and that Triton WR- 1339 acts in T. brucei as a true lysosomotropic drug. Its trypanocidal action probably results from an interference with lysosomal function...|$|E

To reveal the mechanism of regulation mediated by the cross-bridges, separately from the effect of Ca 2 +, we investigated the force-sarcomere length (SL) relationship in rabbit skeletal myofibrils (a single myofibril or a thin bundle) at SL> 2. 2 μm {{in the absence of}} Ca 2 + at various levels of activation by exogenous MgADP (4 – 20 mM) in the presence of 1 mM MgATP. The individual SLs were measured by phase-contrast microscopy to confirm the homogeneity of the striation pattern of sarcomeres during activation.

40|$|A {{flow-through}} tissue-mimicking phantom {{composed of}} a biocompatible hydro-gel with embedded tumour cells {{was used to assess}} and optimize the role of ultrasound-induced cavitation on the extravasation of a <b>macromolecular</b> <b>compound</b> from a channel mimicking vessel in the gel, namely a non-replicating luciferase-expressing adenovirus (Ad-Luc). Using a 500 KHz therapeutic ultrasound transducer confocally aligned with a focussed passive cavitation detector, different exposure conditions and burst mode timings were selected by performing time and frequency domain analysis of passively recorded acoustic emissions, in the absence and in the presence of ultrasound contrast agents acting as cavitation nuclei. In the presence of Sonovue, maximum ultraharmonic emissions were detected for peak rarefactional pressures of 360 kPa, and maximum broadband emissions occurred at 1250 kPa. The energy of the recorded acoustic emissions was used to optimise the pulse repetition frequency and duty cycle in order to maximize either ultraharmonic or broadband emissions while keeping the acoustic energy delivered to the focus constant. Cell viability measurements indicated that none of the insonation conditions investigated induces cell death {{in the absence of a}} therapeutic agent (i. e. virus). Phase contrast images of the tissue-mimicking phantom showed that short range vessel disruption can occur when ultra-harmonic emissions (nf 0 / 2) are maximised whereas formation of a micro-channel perpendicular to the flow can be obtained in the presence of broadband acoustic emissions. Following Ad-Luc delivery, luciferase expression measurements showed that a 60 -fold increase in its bioavailability can be achieved when broadband noise emissions are present during insonation, even for modest contrast agent concentrations. The findings of the present study suggest that drug delivery systems based on acoustic cavitation may help enhance the extravasation of anticancer agents, thus increasing their penetration distance to hypoxic regions and poorly vascularised tumour regions...|$|E

40|$|Tree shrews (Tupaia belangeri) {{develop a}} bidiscoid endotheliochorial placenta. In addition, histiotrophe {{secreted}} by uterine glands is {{absorbed by the}} paraplacental trophoblast. Histiotrophe which is rich in iron is necessary for erythropoiesis in the young embryo. This report {{is part of a}} study of the accumulation and metabolism of iron in the endometrium of precisely dated pregnant Tupaia belangeri by application of electron spectroscopy and histochemistry. In the endometrium of tree shrews which had been pregnant at least once, iron-laden granules were present in macrophages and secreting cells of uterine glands. Iron accumulated in the endometrium shortly after parturition, when macrophages phagocytosed erythrocytes at small haematomas 0. 2 - 0. 5 mm in diameter. These haematomas arose during parturition after bleeding into the uterine stroma when the placental discs were detached. At 24 h after parturition the following structural consequences of the erythrolysosomal breakdown of phagocytosed erythrocytes could be observed: free cytosolic siderin granules, membrane-bound siderosomes, telolysosomes (some of which contained myelin figures or lipid droplets) and mixed telolysosomes (containing membranous stacks and siderin granules). During the lysosomal degradation of phagocytosed erythrocytes, iron was transferred from haemoglobin into a different <b>macromolecular</b> <b>compound.</b> Electron energy loss spectra detected from inside siderosomes indicated an iron-oxygen compound, and high-power bright field electron micrographs of siderosomes demonstrated the ultrastructural pattern characteristic of ferritin. At about d 12 of a new pregnancy, macrophages containing siderosomes closely approached the bases of secreting cells of endometrial glands. This strongly suggests that iron is transferred from the macrophages to the glandular cells. Within the glandular cells, iron-rich histiotrophe was synthesised and released into the glandular lumen. Within the uterine cavity this histiotrophe was absorbed by the omphalopleure. We suggest that among eutherians, postpartum erythrophagocytosis, the transfer of iron from macrophages to uterine glands, and the paraplacental uptake of iron, represent an ancestral mechanism of iron supply to the embryo...|$|E
