5|$|A {{second draft}} was {{finished}} by September. Captain Blumburtt, Chattar Lal, {{and the boy}} Maharaja originally had <b>more</b> <b>crucial</b> roles. A dogfight was deleted, {{as well as those}} who drank the Kali blood turned into zombies with physical superhuman abilities. During pre-production, the Temple of Death title was replaced with Temple of Doom. From March to April 1983, Huyck and Katz simultaneously performed rewrites for a final shooting script.|$|E

25|$|On 18 June 2015, it was {{reported}} that the FSA and YPG had launched a new offensive on the town of Sarrin. The goal of taking Sarrin became <b>more</b> <b>crucial</b> after the Kobanî massacre at the end of June. On 1 July, YPG-led forces had re-established the sieges of the Sarrin Grain Silos and Khirbat al-Burj, and fully besieged Sarrin itself by 4 July.|$|E
25|$|During the Old Kingdom all the {{way until}} the {{beginning}} of the New Kingdom, the navy and vessels of the ancient Egyptians were almost nonexistent other than to perform communication and transportation duties.

25|$|Doing Business is a {{controversial}} study, with passionate critics and devoted fans. As {{recognized by the}} Independent Evaluation Group of the World Bank, some have questioned the reliability and objectivity of its measurements while others doubt {{the relevance of the}} issues it addresses or fear it may unduly dominate countries reform agendas at the expense of <b>more</b> <b>crucial</b> development objectives.

50|$|The {{impressive}} form of Ibehre {{ensured that}} Morrison only started four more {{games for the}} U's until March, when injury to Freddie Sears created a hole in attack. This was coupled with Ibehre receiving a three-match suspension and Morrison went on to spearhead the U's attack once <b>more,</b> providing <b>crucial</b> experience in Colchester's bid for League One survival. In his fourth successive start, he notched his second U's goal in a 2-1 win away at Bury; a vital match-winning goal in a crunch relegation fixture.|$|R
50|$|Laz {{is divided}} into three dialects: Khopa-Chkhala, Vitze-Arkabe and Atina-Artasheni. Dialectical {{classification}} is mainly conditioned by phonetic characteristics. <b>More</b> specifically, the <b>crucial</b> point is the reflexes of the Kartvelian phoneme , which is maintained only in the Khopa-Chkhala dialect but has different reflections in Vitze-Arkabe and Atina-Artasheni dialects (see below).|$|R
25|$|In Game 4, Sacramento again {{got out to}} a fast {{start with}} a 40-point first quarter and built a 24-point first half lead. However, the Lakers cut the lead to 14 at halftime with a Samaki Walker 3-pointer at the buzzer that should not have counted (replay was not used at the time), and to 7 after three quarters. They whittled it down to 2 on the final {{possession}} {{with a chance to}} tie or win it, but Bryant missed a running layup and Shaq missed a put-back attempt. Divac knocked the ball away from the hoop in an attempt to run out the clock, but instead it wound up going to a wide open Robert Horry at the arc, who hit a 3 over Webber at the buzzer to give the Lakers an improbable victory, which tied the series going back to Sacramento. Horry scored 11 of his 18 points in the 4th quarter, including two <b>more</b> <b>crucial</b> 3-pointers. O'Neal finished with 27 points and 18 rebounds, Bryant with 25. Divac, Webber and Bibby all finished with 20+ points for the Kings.|$|E
25|$|Poverty {{has been}} also {{considered}} a real social phenomenon reflecting more {{the consequences of}} a lack of income than the lack of income per se (Ferragina et al. 2016). According to Townsend: humans are social animals entangled in a web of relationships, which exert complex and changing pressures, as much in their consumption of goods and services as in any other aspect of their behaviour (Townsend 1979). This idea has received theoretical support from scholars and extensive testimony from people experiencing poverty across the globe (Walker 2014). Participation and consumption have become ever <b>more</b> <b>crucial</b> mechanisms through which people establish and communicate their identity and position in society, increasing the premium attached to resources needed to participate (Giddens 1991). In addition, the concept of social exclusion has been added to the lexicon of poverty related terms, describing the process by which people, especially those on low incomes, can become socially and politically detached from mainstream society and its associated resources and opportunities (Cantillon 1997). Equally western society have become more complex with ethnic diversity, multi-culturalism and life-style choices raising the possibility that a single concept of poverty as conceived in the past might no longer apply (Ferragina et al. 2016).|$|E
500|$|James Monroe Taylor, fourth {{president}} of Vassar College {{in the town}} of Poughkeepsie, New York, wrote in 1901 of a dearth of a dedicated social space on campus [...] "not devoted to college work but to college recreation."

500|$|Thomas Holtz Jr. would {{note that}} high depth {{perception}} of Tyrannosaurus {{may have been}} due to the prey it had to hunt; noting that it had to hunt horned dinosaurs such as Triceratops, armored dinosaurs such as Ankylosaurus and the duck-billed dinosaurs may have had complex social behaviors. He would suggest that this made precision <b>more</b> <b>crucial</b> for Tyrannosaurus enabling it to, [...] "get in, get that blow in and take it down." [...] In contrast, Acrocanthosaurus had limited depth perception because they hunted large sauropods, which were relatively rare during the time of Tyrannosaurus.|$|E
500|$|In 1981, the U.S. Air Force {{developed}} {{a requirement for}} an Advanced Tactical Fighter (ATF) as a new air superiority fighter to replace the F-15 Eagle and F-16 Fighting Falcon. This was made <b>more</b> <b>crucial</b> by the emerging worldwide threats, including development and proliferation of Soviet MiG-29 and Su-27 [...] "Flanker"-class fighter aircraft. It would {{take advantage of the}} new technologies in fighter design on the horizon including composite materials, lightweight alloys, advanced flight-control systems, more powerful propulsion systems and stealth technology. [...] In 1985 the Air Force sent out technical requests for proposals to a number of aircraft manufacturing teams. The formal request for proposal (RFP) was issued in July1986, and two contractor teams, Lockheed, Boeing and General Dynamics, along with Northrop and McDonnell Douglas, were selected on 31October1986 to undertake a 50-month demonstration phase, culminating in the flight test of the two teams' prototypes, the YF-22 and the YF-23.|$|E
500|$|One of Jolie's {{requests}} was {{to rework}} the third act, which originally had Salt rescue {{his wife and son}} from a coalition of villains, because she did not believe a mother would neglect her child in this kind of situation. Wimmer decided to then make Salt <b>more</b> <b>crucial</b> to the villain's schemes, and add a sequence where Salt breaks into [...] "a place harder than Fort Knox" [...] – after considering Camp David, Wimmer settled on the White House. When asked if the script written for Cruise was the same for Jolie, he said [...] "I think that it’s just been a continual process, obviously accelerating by changing the central character. But the ideas – the locomotive of ideas that drive the film are the same. An undercover CIA operative is accused of being a Russian mole, and has to go on the run to defend himself. That’s been the same since day one. The tone of the film has changed in this evolution. In the same way, I guess, as – you know – action thrillers have changed {{along the lines of the}} Bond films and the Bourne films".|$|E

500|$|Winthrop gave {{a speech}} to the General Court in July 1645, stating that {{there are two kinds of}} liberty: natural liberty to do as one wished, [...] "evil as well as good," [...] a liberty that he {{believed}} should be restrained; and civil liberty to do good. Winthrop strongly believed that civil liberty was [...] "the proper end and object of authority", meaning that it was the duty of the government to be selfless for the people and promote justice instead of promoting the general welfare. He supported this point of view by his actions, such as when he passed laws requiring the heads of households to make sure that their children and servants received proper education, and for support of teachers from public funds. Winthrop's actions were for the unity of the colony because he believed that nothing was <b>more</b> <b>crucial</b> of a colony than working as a single unit that wouldn't be split by any force, such as with the case of Anne Hutchinson. He was a leader respected by many, even Richard Dummer, a principal Hutchinsonian disarmed for his activities, who gave 100 pounds to him.|$|E

2500|$|One of Kierkegaard's {{recurrent}} themes is {{the importance}} of subjectivity, which {{has to do with the}} way people relate themselves to (objective) truths. In Concluding Unscientific Postscript to Philosophical Fragments, he argues that [...] "subjectivity is truth" [...] and [...] "truth is subjectivity." [...] What he means by this is that most essentially, truth is not just a matter of discovering objective facts. While objective facts are important, there is a second and <b>more</b> <b>crucial</b> element of truth, which involves how one relates oneself to those matters of fact. Since how one acts is, from the ethical perspective, more important than any matter of fact, truth is to be found in subjectivity rather than objectivity.|$|E
