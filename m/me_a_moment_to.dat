60|$|You are startled, {{but give}} <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>to</b> explain. What, {{you would say}} to me, {{do you mean to}} tell us that we deny Christ? we who are {{essentially}} modern in every one of our principles and feelings, and yet all of us professing believers in Christ, and we trust most of us true ones? I answer, So far as we are believers indeed, we are one with the faithful of all times,--one with the classical believer of Athens and Ephesus, and one with the mediæval believer of the banks of the Rhone and the valleys of the Monte Viso. But so far as, in various strange ways, some in great and some in small things, we deny this belief, in so far we are essentially infected with this spirit, which I call Modernism.|$|E
6000|$|Presently we Whitmans all {{moved up}} to Tillary street, near Adams, where my father, who was a carpenter, built a house for himself and us all. It was from here I [...] "assisted" [...] the {{personal}} coming of Lafayette in 1824-'5 to Brooklyn. He came over the Old Ferry, as the now Fulton Ferry (partly navigated quite up to that day by [...] "horse boats," [...] though the first steamer had begun to be used hereabouts) was then call'd, and was receiv'd {{at the foot of}} Fulton street. It was on that occasion that the corner-stone of the Apprentices' Library, at the corner of Cranberry and Henry streets--since pull'd down--was laid by Lafayette's own hands. Numerous children arrived on the grounds, of whom I was one, and were assisted by several gentlemen to safe spots to view the ceremony. Among others, Lafayette, also helping the children, took me up--I was five years old, press'd <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>to</b> his breast--gave me a kiss and set me down in a safe spot. Lafayette was at that time between sixty-five and seventy years of age, with a manly figure and a kind face.|$|E

60|$|Without answering, Agnes {{pointed to}} a chair. She could do this, and, for the time, she could do no more. All that she had read of the hidden and {{sinister}} life in the palace at Venice; all that she had heard of Montbarry's melancholy death and burial in a foreign land; all that she knew {{of the mystery of}} Ferrari's disappearance, rushed into her mind, when the black-robed figure confronted her, standing just inside the door. The strange conduct of Lady Montbarry added a new perplexity to the doubts and misgivings that troubled her. There stood the adventuress whose character had left its mark on society all over Europe--the Fury who had terrified Mrs. Ferrari at the hotel--inconceivably transformed into a timid, shrinking woman! Lady Montbarry had not once ventured to look at Agnes, since she had made her way into the room. Advancing to take the chair that had been pointed out to her, she hesitated, put her hand on the rail to support herself, and still remained standing. 'Please give <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>to</b> compose myself,' she said faintly. Her head sank on her bosom: she stood before Agnes like a conscious culprit before a merciless judge.|$|E

One night, many years later, Bob Dylan said to me: U2! How could they do that to you? How could they take your song like that? It took <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>to</b> know what he was talking about, and a moment more to realise that he was putting me on. But then, U2s Get On Your Boots was probably to Pump It Up what Subterranean Homesick Blues is to Chuck Berrys Too Much Monkey Business.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we develop a {{participatory}} {{model of the}} Christian doctrine of the atonement, according to which the atonement involves participating in the death and resurrection of Christ. In part one we argue that current models of the atonement—exemplary, penal, substitutionary and merit models—are unsatisfactory. The central problem with these models is that they assume a purely deontic conception of sin and, as a result, they fail to address sin as a relational and ontological problem. In part two we argue that a participatory model of the atonement is both exegetically and philosophically plausible, and should be taken seriously within philosophical theology. i What? Humanity sins but it’s God’s Son who pays the price? I tried to imagine Father saying to me, “Piscine, a lion slipped into the llama pen today and killed two llamas. Yesterday another one killed a black buck. Last week two of them ate the camel. The week before it was painted storks and grey herons. And who’s to say for sure who snacked on our golden agouti? The situation has become intolerable. Something must be done. I have decided {{that the only way}} the lions can atone for their sins is if I feed you to them. ” “Yes, Father, that would be the right and logical thing to do.

40|$|I met Larry Tribe in 1997 at {{a dinner}} party in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Tointroduce me to her colleagues, Harvard Professor Martha Minow asked me which of the University 2 ̆ 7 s {{scholars}} I would like to invite to my ideal dinner. As a newly minted professor, it took <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>to</b> realize this was not an interview question, but her characteristically generous attempt to construct a guest list. I asked for Larry Tribe and Helen Vendler. I had been lucky enough to take a seminar on modem poetry with Vendler as an undergraduate at Harvard. But neither Vendler nor I had met Tribe before. At one point in the evening, someone mentioned Vendler 2 ̆ 7 s book on the odes ofJohn Keats. 1 Tribe mused aloud about who John Keats might have grown up to be if he had lived past the age of twenty-six. (This off-hand reference to how old Keats was when he died was my first experience of Tribe 2 ̆ 7 s intellectual range and photographic memory.) 2 ̆ 2 I think he would have grown up to be James Merrill, 2 ̆ 2 Vendler replied. I saw Tribe look up at her as she issued this extraordinary pronouncement. James Merrill, after all, was still alive. I thought each recognized a kindred spirit. She was forging the literary canon as he was forging the legal one. I felt I was in the presence of greatness...|$|E

40|$|One {{consideration}} in designing representations for domain knowledge {{is the ability}} of an automated reasoning system to manipulate, use, and derive consequences within the representation. Work on designing Discovery Systems has uncovered several characteristics of representations which facilitate automated reasoning. I will discuss the Discovery Systems AM and EURISKO by Lenat, CYRANO by Ken Haase, and the related work of Fawcett and Utgoff on automatic feature generation. I will also present the relationship of representation design in Genetic Algorithm systems, as worked on by John Holland and John Koza, to representations for knowledge based systems.

At any rate, if any word is said about it, it should, I think, be said in the other House." ...|$|R
