This study aimed to investigate the effects of fabrics with dynamic moisture transfer properties on breast skin temperature, and the thermal physiological and psychological response of women while wearing the sports bra during exercise and recovery. Ten healthy women exercised in random order with two types of sports bra {{with or without the}} dynamic moisture transfer properties and then performed a 20 -minute short-duration high-intensity exercise and rest to recover under thermoneutral conditions. Heart rate, body core temperature, skin temperature, body mass and thermal psychological subjective sensations were investigated during exercise and recovery. The results indicated that in the running state, the local breast skin temperatures of sports bra <b>made</b> <b>of</b> <b>fabrics</b> with dynamic moisture transfer properties (33. 427 ± 0. 087) are significantly lower than bras without these dynamic moisture transfer properties (33. 964 ± 0. 055) (P< 0. 01).

The dowry system, which is the whole set of rules, legal practices, customs and rituals, is an interdisciplinary subject: focused on the economic and legal impact, the topic has also important social and cultural implications and it is connected with the artistic and literary production. The dowry is also considered by gender history as a key that allows {{an interpretation of the}} roles {{of men and women in}} relation to family and heritage. Through legislative and documentary sources, the research seeks to reconstruct and to reveal some aspects of the dowry system in Este’s city. Thus, the dowry is condensed into a contract draft of a notary, very careful for the correctness of the form not to impair its legal validity, but it is also the fragment of a story that springs from the pen of a chronicler, still thrilled at the sight of a princely trousseau has seen paraded through the streets of the city. There is a dowry crystallized under the headings of city statutes, obligation and right, punishment and compensation, and another one <b>made</b> <b>of</b> <b>fabrics</b> and small objects, clothes and jewelry carefully placed in the trunks that follow the bride in her new home. There are wasted and stolen dowries, not returned or not paid during the long litigations that drag on beyond the death of the first contenders, there are others dowries consisting of a few coins gived to poor unmarried women, given for charity in exchange for a prayer. And again, the dowry earned in the service of a wealthy family and received at the time of dismissal after many years of work is very different from the dowry of a nun, married to a husband whose wife will never be a widow and that will not return it to her. The dowry, indeed indispensable prerequisite for entering marriage, cuts across all social strata. It is part of the negotiation between the powerful, in the correspondence of ambassadors, or delivered with bare hands, as alms on the threshold of a church, trimmed portion on the sidelines of a noble heritage, or accumulated in the sedimentation of business of a merchant. The trousseaux move along short segments that separate the two houses built in the same contrada or long journeys, by land and river, accompanying their wives promised to husbands in distant lands.

This thesis analyses a body of largely unpublished ceramic material from Dakhleh Oasis in the Western Desert of Egypt. The material is primarily from the survey of Dakhleh Oasis and the testing of sites {{by members of the}} Dakhleh Oasis Project and, except for some Phase 4 material recovered from excavations at Ismant el-Kharab, is unstratified. It covers a thousand years of Egyptian pottery-making from the eighth century BC to the late second century AD. [...] A comprehensive survey of published and unpublished material from other sites in Egypt and adjacent regions has been undertaken to acquire comparative material for the pottery from Dakhleh Oasis. In addition, a study of the technical characteristics of the vessels that have remained accessible has been undertaken to describe and explain ancient pottery practices and to build up a framework for comparative purposes. [...] With this body of information, a vessel typology divided into two series, each of which are further divided into two phases, has been devised and the chronology of the vessels determined. This ceramic typology has been used to compare surveyed sites of different utilisation - cemetery, settlement and temple sites - and to establish a dating system for these sites. The resulting chronology will be a guide to the determination of future excavations in the oasis and will assist in the on-going study of the socio-economic development of the oasis. The typology also provides a corpus of pottery for the processing of material from future excavations in Dakhleh Oasis and information for other ceramicists working in Egypt and elsewhere. [...] The comparative survey of ceramic material from other sites demonstrates that Dakhleh Oasis, although a remote region in the Western Desert of Egypt, maintained contact with the Nile Valley and more distant areas. It also shows that, while this interaction influenced local pottery styles, the oasis retained and developed its own pottery traditions. [...] In addition, a preliminary analysis has been <b>made</b> <b>of</b> <b>fabrics</b> and clays for descriptive purposes and to increase knowledge of the ancient ceramics from the oasis. [...] A database has also been built to store and manipulate the information on this extensive body of ceramic material from Dakhleh Oasis. The pottery drawings have been produced in a format readily accessible for electronic transfer to researchers in the field of Egyptian ceramics. Mode of access: World Wide Web. 498, [199] p. ill.

H 577 P ITC 2016 Linxxii, 196 pages :color illustrationsGrowth in {{research}} into fat and muscle metabolisms {{suggests that the}} human body is dependent on them for optimal health. Adipose tissue and skeletal muscles {{play a central role in}} lipid metabolism, which not only used for energy storage and expenditure, but also be regarded as secretary and endocrine organs. Modulation of fat and muscle in physiological condition closely associates with prevention of overweight and obesity. Temperature plays a crucial role to directly or indirectly affect essentially every aspect of an organism's physiology. As the fat and muscle act as an insulating layer beneath the skin, it more likely has close relationships with changes in environmental temperature near the body, which is directly regulated by clothing as an effective intervention to influence body temperature. However, how the effects and underlying mechanisms of temperature on fat and muscle metabolisms and how the clothing act as an intervention to regulate body surface temperature for the purpose of providing the optimal operating thermal environment for fat and muscle cells is indeed still in its infancy. The ultimate purpose of this research is to investigate the effects of body temperature on fat and muscle by clothing, and establish a multi-disciplinary theoretical understanding to provide guidance for novel interventions and therapies development for fat and muscle health management. This study was divided into three phases to investigate the effects and mechanisms from cell models (phase 1), human model of laboratory wear trials (phase 2) and human model of field wear trials (phase 3). In the phase 1, classical 3 T 3 -L 1 adipocytes and C 2 C 12 myotubes were selected as cell models, the underlying mechanisms about effects of temperature on fat and muscle were explored at a cellular level. Palmitate was used as an incentive to provoke differentiated 3 T 3 -L 1 adipocytes and C 2 C 12 myotubes in terms of establishing an obese model as references. Biological methods were employed to clarify the interactions between temperature and cell viability, intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS), lipid peroxidation, lipid droplet size, as well as protein content. Results shown in the 3 T 3 -L 1 adiposity model indicated, although the lipid droplet size was declined by hyperthermia, both hypothermia and hyperthermia could regulate physiological ROS and lipid peroxidation to ultimately maintain viability of 3 T 3 -L 1 adipocytes; whereas, in palmitate mediated 3 T 3 -L 1 adiposity model, excessive ROS and lipid peroxidation has been attenuated by hypothermia, but it still not positively remedies the damage caused by palmitate to cell death. Observations in the C 2 C 12 myotubes revealed that hyperthermia could suppress the intracellular ROS and lipid peroxidation in physiological condition to improve protein synthesis, but not significantly promote cell viability. Moreover, intracellular ROS and lipid peroxidation were significant inhibited through hyperthermia in palmitate treated C 2 C 12 myotubes to prevent palmitate induced proteolysis and final improve the cell proliferation. In the phase 2, influence of clothing on the body temperature distribution by clothing design and the usage of functional fabrics were examined. A parallel, random wear trial was conducted first to investigate the body temperature variation under different activity conditions when wearing designed pants by the usage of functional fabrics with infrared radiation properties. There is no significant difference in core temperature, but the body means skin temperature has drawn a significant higher in pants of functional fabrics with infrared radiation properties. Additionally, functional bra was developed by the usage of fabrics with dynamic moisture transferring properties to further explore its influence on the regional body temperature of the particular adipose tissue model, female breast, which is mostly made up of a collection of fat. Another parallel, random wear trial study revealed that local breast skin temperatures of bra <b>made</b> <b>of</b> <b>fabrics</b> with dynamic moisture transfer properties are significantly lower than bras without these dynamic moisture transfer properties in the running condition, whereas the body mean skin temperature were revealed to undergo greater decreasing effects in bras <b>made</b> <b>of</b> <b>fabrics</b> with dynamic moisture transfer properties than those without the dynamic moisture transfer properties. These findings proved the hypotheses that clothing could be used as an effective means to regulate mean skin temperature and also regional skin surface temperature could be controlled by clothing design and usage of functional fabrics. In the phase 3, the influences of clothing on fat and muscle by clothing design and usage of functional fabrics was examined by conducting field wear trials. Functional pants used in the phase two were optimized to increase the ability for regulating skin surface by designing and welding with heat press sticker. A parallel, randomly crossover designed wear trial study was carried out to explore whether clothing has an influence on body fat, muscle and also lipid profiles under free living conditions. Significant decrease of the body mass index and waist-hip ratio were found when wearing functional clothing to relatively elevate the body surface temperature for four weeks, but indexes, including body fat mass, visceral fat area, truck fat mass, as well as skeletal muscle mass were not being significantly affected. It also found out that there are no significant differences in blood lipid profiles, such as triacylglycerol, total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, LDL cholesterol and total lipid during the experiment period. In summary, the effects and underlying mechanisms of clothing temperature on fat and muscle have been explored. The results obtained cell model experiments demonstrated that temperature has significant influence on the metabolisms of fat and muscle cells, particularly the size of lipid droplets in fat cells. The results from human model laboratory wear trials demonstrated that clothing with different designs and use of different fabrics can be used as an effective means to regulate local skin surface temperature. The results from human model field wear trial studies showed that clothing could have significant influence on body mass index (BMI) and waist-hip ratio (WHR) on human subjects. These findings suggest that clothing design and using functional fabrics had potential to be utilized as novel interventions for fat and muscle health management.
