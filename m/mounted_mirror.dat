50|$|In late 1668 Isaac Newton {{built his}} first {{reflecting}} telescope. He chose an alloy (speculum metal) of tin and copper {{as the most}} suitable material for his objective mirror. He later devised means for shaping and grinding the mirror {{and may have been}} the first to use a pitch lap to polish the optical surface. He chose a spherical shape for his mirror instead of a parabola to simplify construction; even though it would introduce spherical aberration, it would still correct chromatic aberration. He added to his reflector what is the hallmark of the design of a Newtonian telescope, a secondary diagonally <b>mounted</b> <b>mirror</b> near the primary mirror's focus to reflect the image at a 90° angle to an eyepiece mounted {{on the side of the}} telescope. This unique addition allowed the image to be viewed with minimal obstruction of the objective mirror. He also made the tube, mount, and fittings. Newton's first version had a primary mirror diameter of 1.3 in and a focal ratio of f/5. He found that the telescope worked without colour distortion and that he could see the four Galilean moons of Jupiter and the crescent phase of the planet Venus with it. Newton's friend Isaac Barrow showed a second telescope to a small group from the Royal Society of London at the end of 1671. They were so impressed with it that they demonstrated it to Charles II in January 1672. Newton was admitted as a fellow of the society in the same year.|$|E

40|$|A novel, simple, and {{inexpensive}} calibration scheme for a continuous-wave difference frequency spectrometer is presented, {{based on the}} stabilization of an open transfer cavity by locking onto the output of a polarization stabilized HeNe laser. High frequency, acoustic fluctuations of the transfer cavity length are compensated with a piezoelectric transducer <b>mounted</b> <b>mirror,</b> while long term drift in cavity length is controlled by thermal feedback. A single mode Ar+ laser, used with a single mode ring dye laser in the difference frequency generation of 2 – 4 µm light, is then locked onto a suitable fringe of this stable cavity, achieving a very small long term drift and furthermore reducing the free running Ar+ linewidth to about 1 MHz. The dye laser scan provides tunability in the difference frequency mixing process, and is calibrated by marker fringes with the same stable cavity. Due to the absolute stability of the marker cavity, precise frequency determination of near infrared molecular transitions is achieved via interpolation between these marker fringes. It is shown theoretically that the residual error of this scheme due to the dispersion of air in the transfer cavity is quite small, and experimentally that a frequency precision {{on the order of}} 1 MHz per hour is routinely obtained with respect to molecular transitions.

Several other brands followed, initially designed for the bicycle industry then later as an industrial and tactical device. The success of <b>mirrors</b> <b>mounted</b> on bicycle helmets continued for decades, finally being adopted by construction and industrial workers as a safety device, on helmets of snowmobilers (3), and in tactical environments like Airsoft and SWAT applications adding a similar level of safety as mirrors on vehicles.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} {{investigate}} the wake structure and the vortex body frame interaction near the real scale rear view mirror of a passenger car, the velocity vector fields in wake and pressure distribution over the mirror skin have been measured by use of the hot-wire anem-ometry and the pressure scanning system, respectively in the blow down wind tunnel at the Reynolds number of 5105. 2 ×. The boundary layer flow over the mirror housing and the mir-ror surface was visualized by the oil film technology as well. The vertical velocity vector fields to the main stream in the mirror wake showed that within the half distance of the mirror span the recirculation zone appeared and the intrinsic vortex was shed with the frequency of 19. 6 Hz, and also showed that a conical envelop of the vortex sheet was developed with its center trailing towards the body frame. The minimum pressure zone on the mirror surface appeared near the upper tip corner, {{which seemed to be}} the origin of the vortex envelop. The separation focus was found on the upper tip face of the mirror housing and a surface separa-tion line was also distributed over the edge line of the mirror housing in the visualization re-sults.

40|$|Laser axotomy {{followed}} by time-lapse microscopy is a sensitive assay for axon regeneration phenotypes in C. elegans 1. The main difficulty of this assay is the perceived cost ($ 25 - 100 K) and technical expertise required for implementing a laser ablation system 2, 3. However, solid-state pulse lasers of modest costs (<$ 10 K) can provide robust performance for laser ablation in transparent preparations where target axons are "close " to the tissue surface. Construction and alignment {{of a system}} can be accomplished in a day. The optical path provided by light from the focused condenser to the ablation laser provides a convenient alignment guide. An intermediate module with all optics removed can be dedicated to the ablation laser and assures that no optical elements need be moved during a laser ablation session. A dichroic in the intermediate module allows simultaneous imaging and laser ablation. Centering the laser beam to the outgoing beam from the focused microscope condenser lens guides the initial alignment of the system. A variety of lenses are used to condition and expand the laser beam to fill the back aperture of the chosen objective lens. Final alignment and testing is performed with a front surface mirrored glass slide target. Laser power is adjusted to give a minimum size ablation spot (< 1 um).

40|$|Synchro-ballistic use of rotating-mirror streak cameras {{allows for}} {{detailed}} recording of high-speed events of known velocity and direction. After {{an introduction to}} the synchro-ballistic technique, this paper details two diverse applications of the technique as applied in the field of high-explosives research. In the first series of experiments detonation-front shape is recorded as the arriving detonation shock wave tilts an obliquely <b>mounted</b> <b>mirror,</b> causing reflected light to be deflected from the imaging lens. These tests were conducted for the purpose of calibrating and confirming the asymptotic Detonation Shock Dynamics (DSD) theory of Bdzil and Stewart. The phase velocities of the events range from ten to thirty millimeters per microsecond. Optical magnification is set for optimal use of the film`s spatial dimension and the phase velocity is adjusted to provide synchronization at the camera`s maximum writing speed. Initial calibration of the technique is undertaken using a cylindrical HE geometry over a range of charge diameters and of sufficient length-to-diameter ratio to insure a stable detonation wave. The final experiment utilizes an arc-shaped explosive charge, resulting in an asymmetric detonation-front record. The second series of experiments consists of photographing a shaped-charge jet having a velocity range of two to nine millimeters per microsecond. To accommodate the range of velocities it is necessary to fire several tests, each synchronized to a different section of the jet. The experimental apparatus consists of a vacuum chamber to preclude atmospheric ablation of the jet tip with shocked-argon back lighting to produce a shadow-graph image...|$|E

40|$|A cw {{titanium}} sapphire laser pumped by an argon {{ion laser}} {{was used for}} experiments both in second harmonic generation using a non-linear crystal and for sum-frequency generation in an atomic vapour. In addition the laser was stabilised to sub-MHz levels. Using a crystal of potassium niobate (KNbO₃), the Ti:sapphire laser was frequency doubled over the range 860 nm- 905 nm using an intracavity scheme. The crystal was temperature tuned to achieve near non-critical phase-matching and powers of up to 50 mW were obtained, with a constant conversion efficiency per Watt over the doubling range. The thermal properties of potassium niobate in frequency doubling were examined {{and the effect of}} the crystal on the ring cavity during temperature tuning was investigated. The laser cavity was frequency stabilised using a 'side of fringe' locking scheme with a confocal Fabry-Perot etalon as the reference discriminator. The cavity length control elements were two Brewster-angled tilt plates and a piezo <b>mounted</b> <b>mirror.</b> Using this scheme the frequency noise was reduced from tens of MHz to 550 kHz. Methods of obtaining a 30 GHz frequency scan were also evaluated and an experimental 10 GHz scan achieved. It was concluded that only dither and lock schemes are good enough to achieve reliable 30 GHz scans. Using both a Ti:sapphire laser and a dye laser, two contrasting schemes for sum-frequency generation in sodium vapour were investigated, in which a magnetic field was used to break the symmetry of the medium. Using one of these resonantly enhanced routes, powers of 17 μW in the UV were obtained from a classically 'forbidden' quadrupole transition. The effects of phase-matching on each of the transitions was examined in detail, and it was found that in general there are at least six factors which affect the phase-matching behaviour of the frequency mixing scheme. It was also found that on the route which had two sources of dispersion there was a significant distortion of the output line profiles at high temperatures due to a variation in phase-matching across the line profile itself...|$|E
40|$|The Changchun Institute of Optics, Fine Mechanics and Physics (CIOMP) team is {{developing}} the Giant Steerable Science Mirror (GSSM) for Thirty Meter Telescope (TMT) which {{will enter the}} preliminary design phase in 2016. The GSSM is the tertiary mirror of TMT and consists of the world’s largest flat telescope mirror (approximately 3. 4 m X 2. 4 m X 100 mm thick) having an elliptical perimeter positioned with an extremely smooth tracking and pointing mechanism in a gravity-varying environment. In order to prepare for developing this unique mirror system, CIOMP has been developing a 1 / 4 scale, functionally accurate version of the GSSM prototype during the pre-construction phase of GSSM. The prototype will incorporate the same optomechanical system and servo control system as the GSSM. The size of the prototype mirror is 898. 5 mm× 634 mm× 12. 5 mm with an elliptical perimeter. The mirror will be supported axially by an 18 point whiffletree and laterally with a 12 point whiffletree. The main objective of the preconstruction phase includes requirement validation and risk reduction for GSSM and to increase confidence that the challenge of developing the GSSM can be met. The precision mechanism system and the optical mirror polishing and testing have made good progress. CIOMP has completed polishing the mirror, the prototype mechanism is nearly assembled, some testing has been performed, and additional testing is being planned and prepared. A dummy mirror is being integrated into the cell assembly prototype to verify the design, analysis and interface and will be used when testing the prototype positioner tilt and rotation motions. The prototype positioner tilt and rotator structures have been assembled and tested to measure each subsystem’s jitter and dynamic motion. The mirror prototype has been polished and tested to verify the polishing specification requirement and the mirror manufacturing process. The complete assembly, integration and verification of the prototype will be soon finished.

40|$|Spectrally encoded {{confocal}} microscopy (SECM) is {{a technique}} that facilitates the incorporation of confocal microscopy into small, portable clinical instruments. This would allow in vivo evaluation of cellular and sub-cellular features in a non-destructive, minimally invasive manner. Prior studies have demonstrated {{the potential of the}} techniques as well as highlighted the need for faster acquisition rates and higher sensitivity. In this thesis, new laser sources, optical fiber arrangements and probe designs are explored to ultimately evaluate SECM's relevance as a clinical tool. Clinical imaging at cellular scales requires imaging rates on the order of tens of frames per second to reduce motion artifacts from unavoidable patient movements. Rapid SECM imaging was achieved through the development of a novel wavelength swept laser which simultaneously provided high output power (> 10 mrW), narrow linewidth (10 GHz), broad wavelength tuning (80 nm centered at 1310 nm) and fast repetition rates (up to 16, 000 Hz), while being compact and environmentally stable. Imaging with a wavelength swept SECM system was characterized by coupling the laser to a tabletop imaging arm comprising a high density holographic grating, a galvanometer <b>mounted</b> <b>mirror</b> and a 0. 9 NA water immersion microscope objective. (cont.) Rapid SECM imaging is performed at a transverse resolution of 1. 4 microns, axial resolution of 6 microns over a field of view of 440 x 440 microns and allows subcellular imaging ex vivo (excised specimens) and in vivo (human skin). A study on 40 excised head and neck specimens showed that SECM has the potential to perform tissue identification, but also revealed the presence of speckle noise due to the coherent nature of the illumination and collection schemes through a single mode optical fiber. A partially coherent system based on single mode fiber for illumination and multimode fiber for detection was simulated, implemented and tested to find adequate balance between attenuation of speckle noise and conservation of resolution. A coupling of 20 modes was found to reduce speckle by a factor 4. 5 with a minimal sectioning penalty of 0. 25, while allowing a signal increase of 8 dB. This improvement in sensitivity allowed SECM table top system to be used for investigations in developmental biology where Dual clad fibers (DCF) were previously shown to allow partially coherent endoscopic imaging, using the single mode core for illumination and inner clad for multimodal collection. (cont.) Commercially available DCF's which propagate thousands of modes are ill suited for confocal endoscopes as collecting such a number of modes would destroy the axial resolution. Based on results from the previous section and through modal analysis, a DCF was designed, drawn - via a collaboration with Boston University Photonics Center -, and tested for use with SECM. The prototype DCF yielded promising results (3 fold speckle attenuation, optical sectioning degradation of 0. 85), and showed the need for implementation of better coupling mechanisms to take advantage of increased signal collection. Finally, a portable SECM system was built for in vivo evaluation of pediatric vocal fold. A preliminary study on porcine and cadaveric tissue showed that SECM can distinguish between epithelium, superior and intermediate layers of the lamina propria, which could help elucidate the development mechanism of the voice apparatus if performed in vivo. The handheld instrument comprises a custom grating scanner imaging the scanning pivot onto the back pupil of a high NA microscope objective. The imaging tube can easily be interchanged to accommodate geometrical constraints imposed by different age groups. (cont.) The probe, currently under review by the biomedical engineering committee, revealed cellular and sub cellular details of human skin in vivo at depth and acquisition rates sufficient to capture blood cells flowing through capillaries. Through major improvements in acquisition speeds, sensitivity, and speckle appearance, this work established SECM as a potent clinical and biological imaging tool. Ultimate confirmation will be revealed through in vivo studies to come, but limitations are likely to be of engineering nature rather than from physical considerations. Future work should explore the possibility to combine SECM with other contrast mechanisms to provide imaging with increased specificity. by Caroline Boudoux. Thesis (Ph. D.)
