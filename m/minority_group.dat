50|$|One {{theory of}} the cause of {{residential}} segregation is the difference in income between <b>minority</b> <b>groups</b> and their white counterparts. The basis of this theory stems from purchasing power: the higher the income, the more likely <b>minority</b> <b>groups</b> are to move to better neighborhoods which in turn results in more integrated neighborhoods. In other words, {{there seems to be}} an inverse relationship between a <b>minority</b> <b>group's</b> socioeconomic status and the <b>minority</b> <b>group's</b> level of residential segregation. Many argue that residential segregation occurs because <b>minority</b> <b>groups,</b> particularly immigrants, do not have the wealth or income to purchase homes in more affluent and predominantly white neighborhoods. Although there is a definite relationship between socioeconomic status and residential segregation, the effect of this relationship is different among <b>minority</b> <b>groups.</b>|$|R
50|$|Since {{median income}} per capita for <b>minority</b> <b>groups</b> {{is lower than}} that of White Americans, and since <b>minority</b> <b>groups</b> are more likely to occupy less gainful {{employment}} and achieve lower education levels, there is a lowered likelihood of political participation among <b>minority</b> <b>groups.</b> Education attainment has been proven to dictate income and occupation. And there is a proven disparity between educational attainment of White Americans and <b>minority</b> <b>groups,</b> with only 30% of bachelor's degrees awarded in 2009 to <b>minority</b> <b>groups.</b> Thus socioeconomic status—and therefore political participation—is correlated with race. Research has shown that African Americans, Latino Americans, and Asian Americans are less politically active, by varying degrees, than White Americans.|$|R

5|$|Calhoun's basic {{concern for}} {{protecting}} the diversity of minority interests is expressed in his chief contribution to political science—the idea of a concurrent majority across different groups as distinguished from a numerical majority.

50|$|Among all <b>minority</b> <b>groups,</b> {{foreign-born}} immigrants experience greater segregation from whites than native-born groups.

5|$|Stuart Buck, a lawyer, also {{explored}} {{this issue}} in Acting White: The Ironic Legacy of Desegregation (2010). He said that segregated black schools had featured teachers, counselors, and others of the same race as the student population, and the adults often acted as mentors to the students. Integration of many public schools since the mid- to late-20th century may have resulted in schools in which black students perceived they were controlled or dominated by whites. A black student trying to achieve high educational success may then be considered as trying to leave the <b>minority</b> <b>group.</b>|$|E

40|$|What does it {{mean for}} ethnic <b>minority</b> <b>groups</b> to possess ‘ethnic options’? Do ethnic <b>minority</b> <b>groups</b> differ in their {{abilities}} to choose and assert their ethnic identities, and can some groups be said to possess more ethnic options than others? It has been recently suggested by certain analysts that while Asian Ameri-cans can exercise some ethnic options, African Americans possess few, if any, ethnic options. This article critically assesses this view, and puts forward various reasons why such a view is problematic. In particular, it argues for the need to rethink and broaden the conceptualization of ethnicity and the need to re-examine our under-standings of the images and labels applied to various ethnic <b>minority</b> <b>groups.</b> Although the article draws primarily upon studies of Asian Americans and African Americans, it also refers to the experiences of ethnic <b>minority</b> <b>groups</b> in Britain with whom American <b>minority</b> <b>groups</b> share both commonalities and differences...|$|R

5|$|The {{arrival of}} the deputies called months ago {{generated}} disputes about the role they should have.

40|$|Minority rights {{instruments}} {{have been}} traditionally applied to old <b>minority</b> <b>groups.</b> This paper examines {{to what extent}} these same instruments are conceptually meaningful to the integration of new minorities stemming from migration. The conviction that <b>minority</b> <b>groups,</b> irrespective of their being old or new minorities, have some basic common claims that can be subsumed under a common definition {{does not mean that}} all <b>minority</b> <b>groups</b> have all the same rights and legitimate claims: some have only minimum rights, while others have or should be granted more substantial rights; some can legitimately put forward certain claims – not enforceable rights – that need to be negotiated with the majority, while others should not. In order to devise a common but differentiated set of rights and obligations for old and new <b>minority</b> <b>groups,</b> it is essential to analyse the differences and similarities of both categories of minorities, their claims, needs, and priorities; in this way, {{it will be possible to}} delineate a catalogue of rights that can be demanded by and granted to different <b>minority</b> <b>groups.</b> Studying the interaction between traditional minorities and migrants or old and new <b>minority</b> <b>groups</b> is a rather new task because so far these topics have been studied in isolation from each other. It is also an important task for future research in Europe since many states have established systems for the rights of old minorities but have not as yet developed sound policies for the integration of new <b>minority</b> <b>groups</b> stemming from migration...|$|R

It is a long sausage, often well-spiced, composed of beef rather than pork, and barbecued. As Zimbabwe was a British colony, some people there have adopted some colonial-era English eating habits. For example, most people will have porridge in the morning, as well as 10 o'clock tea (midday tea). They will have lunch, often leftovers from the night before, freshly cooked sadza, or sandwiches (which {{is more common in}} the cities). After lunch, there is usually 4 o'clock tea (afternoon tea), which is served before dinner. It is not uncommon for tea to be had after dinner.|$|E
40|$|Mental health among ethnic <b>minority</b> <b>groups</b> {{living with}} {{diabetes}} in the UK {{is an area}} that requires urgent attention from the research communities in UK. Globally diabetes affects more than 422 million people while in the UK more than 4 million people are affected by diabetes. Ethnic <b>minority</b> <b>groups</b> in the UK are at least six times more at risk of developing diabetes than the general population. In similar trend, mental health has been reported to be more prevalent among ethnic minority in the UK. Already ethnic <b>minority</b> <b>groups</b> experience poorer health outcomes from diabetes leading to complications like mental health. This is because diabetes and mental health have two-way relationship. The purpose of this presentation is to highlight the need for ethnic minority specific research into the extent of mental health issues among the growing number of ethnic <b>minority</b> <b>groups</b> living with diabetes in the UK. This therefore requires that research communities focus more on the issue of mental health among ethnic <b>minority</b> <b>groups</b> living with diabetes in the UK. Review of factsheets surrounding Mental health and diabetes among ethnic <b>minority</b> <b>groups</b> has been brought together to point out this area that has witnessed limited research among healthcare researchers. The economic and clinical burden of the issue of mental health has been highlighted to reiterate the need for research and clinical efforts to prevent mental health complications among ethnic <b>minority</b> <b>groups</b> living with diabetes in the UK...|$|R
