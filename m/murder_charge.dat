The following day, the jury convicted Cisneros and Garza of capital murder for arranging Fischer's death. Neither of them showed any emotion when the verdict was given. Cisneros then removed her jewelry and was taken to the Cameron County jail with Garza. The jurors met the following day to discuss the punishment phase of the trial.|$|E

Marsden places Janine at the scene, but she also denies murdering Archie.

She and DC Wayne Hughes (Jamie Treacher) attend Archie's funeral, watching people's reactions {{in the hope of}} a new lead.

Sharon tries to help him, but is arrested for murder after finding Skye in Hawaii (where Skye fell into a volcano). After {{escaping}} and returning (after several months of being thought dead), Sharon is acquitted.

After another nervous breakdown and a diagnosis of bipolar disorder (which made her remarry Victor and take over Newman Enterprises), Sharon is re-hired at Newman as vice president for research and development.

5|$|On June 8, 1993, Garza {{was arrested}} at the Cameron County office in Harlingen having {{surrendered}} after an arrest warrant was issued. He was charged with capital murder and held at a county prison with a US$500,000 bond. Garza {{refused to comment on}} the arrest, and officers stated that they could not release details of his involvement other than that they had evidence he was involved in Fischer's murder. Arrest warrants were issued for Olivarez and Puentes Pizaña the day before. They were believed to be in Mexico, and police said they were working with Mexican officials to arrest the two men. On July 21, 1993, Mexican State Judicial Police arrested Olivarez, and his brother Alonso Bazaldúa Cepeda, in Matamoros on a December 1992 <b>murder</b> <b>charge,</b> and for the unauthorized use of a vehicle. However, both men were released at around 3:00a.m. the next day after Olivarez showed the police a writ of amparo (similar to a writ of habeas corpus), which protected his constitutional civil rights. Following their release, the Brownsville police said there were reports that the two suspects were seen in Matamoros, and in Monterrey, Nuevo León, and that next time they tried to cross the international bridge, U.S. border agents would arrest them. Police records show that Olivarez was once arrested in Brownsville on September 12, 1992, for possession of a criminal instrument, but was released on bond the following day. He wrote on his bond application that he lived in Brownsville, though this information was false.|$|E
