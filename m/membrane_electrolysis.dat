The efficiency of an electrolyser {{is a measure}} of the enthalpy contained in the hydrogen (to undergo combustion with oxygen, or some other later reaction), compared with the input electrical energy. Heat/enthalpy values for hydrogen are well published in science and engineering texts, as 144 MJ/kg. Note that fuel cells (not electrolysers) cannot utilise this full amount of heat/enthalpy, which has led to some confusion when calculating efficiency values for both types of technology. In the reaction, some energy is lost as heat. Some reports quote efficiencies between 50% and 70% for alkaline electrolysers; however, much higher practical efficiencies are available with the use of PEM (Polymer Electrolyte <b>Membrane</b> <b>electrolysis)</b> and catalytic technology, such as 95% efficiency.|$|E

40|$|Background: Volatile {{fatty acids}} (VFA) are {{building}} blocks for the chemical industry. Sustainable, biological production is constrained by production and recovery costs, including the need for intensive pH correction. <b>Membrane</b> <b>electrolysis</b> has been developed as an in situ extraction technology tailored to the direct recovery of VFA from fermentation while stabilizing acidogenesis without caustic addition. A current applied across an anion exchange membrane reduces the fermentation broth (catholyte, water reduction: H 2 O + e- → 12 H 2 + OH-) and drives carboxylate ions into a clean, concentrated VFA stream (anolyte, water oxidation: H 2 O → 2 e- + 2 H+ + O 2). Results: In this study, we fermented thin stillage to generate a mixed VFA extract without chemical pH control. <b>Membrane</b> <b>electrolysis</b> (0. 1 A, 3. 22 ± 0. 60 V) extracted 28 ± 6 % of carboxylates generated per day (on a carbon basis) and completely replaced caustic control of pH, with {{no impact on the}} total carboxylate production amount or rate. Hydrogen generated from the applied current shifted the fermentation outcome from predominantly C 2 and C 3 VFA (64 ± 3 % of the total VFA present in the control) to majority of C 4 to C 6 (70 ± 12 % in the experiment), with identical proportions in the VFA acid extract. A strain related to Megasphaera elsdenii (maximum abundance of 57 %), a bacteria capable of producing mid-chain VFA at a high rate, was enriched by the applied current, alongside a stable community of Lactobacillus spp. (10 %), enabling chain elongation of VFA through lactic acid. A conversion of 30 ± 5 % VFA produced per sCOD fed (60 ± 10 % of the reactive fraction) was achieved, with a 50 ± 6 % reduction in suspended solids likely by electro-coagulation. Conclusions: VFA can be extracted directly from a fermentation broth by <b>membrane</b> <b>electrolysis.</b> The electrolytic water reduction products are utilized in the fermentation: OH- is used for pH control without added chemicals, and H 2 is metabolized by species such as Megasphaera elsdenii to produce greater value, more reduced VFA.
