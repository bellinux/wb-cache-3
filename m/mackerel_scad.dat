25|$|The torpedo scad, Megalaspis cordyla (also {{known as}} the hardtail scad, finny scad, finletted <b>mackerel</b> <b>scad</b> and cordyla scad), is a species of {{moderately}} large marine fish classified in the jack and horse mackerel family, Carangidae. The torpedo scad is distributed throughout the tropical Indo-Pacific region, ranging from South Africa {{in the west to}} Tonga in the east, extending to Japan in the north and Australia in south. It is a schooling pelagic fish which occupies the surface layers of both inshore and offshore oceanic waters. The torpedo scad is easily identified by both its 'torpedo' shaped body and a series of detached finlets at the rear of both the dorsal and anal fins. The largest recorded individual was 80cm long and weighed 4 kg, although it is more common at lengths less than 40cm. It is a predatory species, taking a variety of fish, cephalopods and crustaceans by both active and filter feeding. There is a shift in diet as the species grow; however fish is the dominant prey in all size classes. Torpedo scad reach sexual maturity at 22cm in females and 26.4cm in males, with spawning occurring between March and July in India, where significant research into larval growth and morphometrics has been carried out.|$|E

They are distinguishable by a small, detached fin, located between the dorsal and caudal fins. <b>Mackerel</b> <b>scad</b> have 9 spines and 31-36 rays on their dorsal fins, {{while there are}} seven spines and 27-30 rays on their anal fins.|$|E
25|$|Jacks, amberjacks, pompanos, horse <b>mackerel,</b> <b>scads,</b> leatherjackets and {{trevally}} are fish of {{the family}} Carangidae. Found in most coastal waters, they are fast predatory fishes that hunt in the waters above reefs and in the open sea; some dig in the sea floor for invertebrates (some can also filter feed, such as the white trevally). The largest fish in the family, the giant trevally, grows up to 1.7m in length; most fish in the family reach a maximum length of 25–100cm. The family contains many important commercial and game fish, notably the Pacific jack mackerel and the other jack mackerels in the genus Trachurus. The type species of this genus is the Atlantic horse mackerel. Jack mackerels are an important inshore commercial species.|$|R

The analytical methods that used in this research were estimated dynamic model of Walters and Hilborn (1976) and analysis of bio-economic model. The results showed that actual production of exploitation of pelagic fishery resources in Bali Strait, was lower than the rate of sustainable production especially Indonesian oil sardine and short-bodied mackerel. Production and fishing effort were below the actual optimal value. The management of pelagic fishery resources in Bali Strait did not show a good level of economic efficiency.

In contras, small pelagic fish such as <b>mackerel</b> <b>scads,</b> travellies, sardine, needlefish, Indian mackerel, and flyingfish is less than 40 per cent of the total allowable catch (TAC) exploited. Fishing activities on large pelagic fish by means of pole and line, longline etc. are mainly conducted by fishing industries based in the area of Bitung. This situation may give negative impact on fishing industries due to overexploitation of the large pelagic fish. To maintain the current fishing industries, expansion in fishing fleets for large scale pelagic fisheries should be reviewed. And in another hand, the small pelagic fishing industries should be developing in terms of number of fleets and coverage area.

50|$|Portugal {{has been}} fishing and trading cod since the 15th century, and this cod trade {{accounts}} for its ubiquity in the cuisine. Other popular seafood includes fresh sardines (especially when grilled as sardinhas assadas), octopus, squid, cuttlefish, crabs, shrimp and prawns, lobster, spiny lobster, {{and many other}} crustaceans, such as barnacles and goose barnacles, hake, horse <b>mackerel</b> (<b>scad),</b> lamprey, sea bass, scabbard (especially in Madeira), and {{a great variety of}} other fish and shellfish, as well as molluscs, such as clams, mussels, oysters, periwinkles, and scallops. Caldeirada is a stew consisting of a variety of fish and shellfish with potatoes, tomatoes and onions.Sardines used to be preserved in brine for sale in rural areas. Later, sardine canneries developed all along the Portuguese coast. Ray fish is dried in the sun in Northern Portugal. Canned tuna is widely available in Continental Portugal. Tuna used to be plentiful in the waters of the Algarve. They were trapped in fixed nets when they passed the Portuguese southern coast to spawn in the Mediterranean, and again when they returned to the Atlantic. Portuguese writer Raul Brandão, in his book Os Pescadores, describes how the tuna was hooked from the raised net into the boats, and how the fishermen would amuse themselves riding the larger fish around the net. Fresh tuna, however, is usually eaten in Madeira and the Algarve, where tuna steaks are an important item in local cuisine. Canned sardines or tuna, served with boiled potatoes, black-eyed peas, and hard-boiled eggs, constitute a convenient meal when there is no time to prepare anything more elaborate.|$|E

However, due to blanket enforcement of EU fishing regulations on Irish vessels by the Irish Department of the Marine, starting in 2005, and mackerel shoals remaining longer in Norwegian waters, there has been a downturn in the fishing industry in the town. This has led to redundancies in the fish processing industry, in which the fish factory workers have been the hardest hit.|$|R
40|$|Bottom trap {{have been}} used widely by coastal {{communities}} in North Sulawesi to catch coral fishes, since it simple in design, cheaper and easy to manage with a small boat. Unfortunately, the fishing practice of the traditional trap is usually conducted in destructive way, where fishermen cover the gear with live coral to attract fishing target. Although the gear 2 ̆ 7 s design has evolved over centuries, there is still potential for improving its catching efficiency and selectivity. An attempt to understand the fishing process of bottom trap should therefore be focused on bait and how its chemical composition, visual and physical properties may stimulate target species to attack the bait and captured. Addition of squid liver oil to the bait could increase the fishing power of bottom trap gear. But scientific information 2 ̆ 7 s about its applications are not available yet. Therefore, {{the objective of this}} research was to study the effect of squid liver oil on bait of bottom trap toward the capture of coral fishes.
