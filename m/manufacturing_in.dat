5|$|Cheddar is {{recognised}} as a village. The adjacent {{settlement of}} Axbridge, although {{only about a}} third the population of Cheddar, is a town. This apparently illogical situation is explained by the relative importance of the two places in historic times.

5|$|China's {{economic}} policies laid {{the basis of}} the industrialization drive in export-oriented development, and its reliance on low-wage manufacturing to produce consumer goods for the world market.

Hong Kong and Shenzhen were cities established as centers of export-oriented industrialization, and migrant women workers have made up 70% of Shenzhen's three million people.|$|E

5|$|Conspiracy theorists, such as American writer Jim Marrs, {{claim that}} some ex-Nazis, {{who survived the}} fall of the Greater German Reich, along with sympathizers in the United States and elsewhere, given haven by {{organizations}} like ODESSA and Die Spinne, have been working behind the scenes since the end of World War II to enact at least some principles of Nazism (e.g., militarism, imperialism, widespread spying on citizens, corporatism, the use of propaganda to manufacture a national consensus) into culture, government, and business worldwide, but primarily in the U.S. They cite the influence of ex-Nazi scientists brought in under Operation Paperclip to help advance aerospace <b>manufacturing</b> <b>in</b> the U.S. with technological principles from Nazi UFOs, and the acquisition and creation of conglomerates by ex-Nazis and their sympathizers after the war, in both Europe and the U.S.|$|E

In 1950, during the Korean War, Farrell returned to active duty with the Army once more, and served with the Defense Production Administration. In July 1951, he was transferred to the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC), the successor organization to the Manhattan Project, where he became the Assistant General Manager for <b>Manufacturing.</b> <b>In</b> this role, he oversaw a vast increase in the Commission's production capabilities.

5|$|In 2009, {{the private}} sector was {{estimated}} to constitute 86.4% of the economy, with federal government activity accounting for 4.3% {{and state and local}} government activity (including federal transfers) the remaining 9.3%.

While its economy has reached a postindustrial level of development and its service sector constitutes 67.8% of GDP, the United States remains an industrial power. The leading business field by gross business receipts is wholesale and retail trade; by net income it is <b>manufacturing.</b> <b>In</b> the franchising business model, McDonald's and Subway are the two most recognized brands in the world.

In 1884, John Henry Patterson acquired James Ritty's National Manufacturing Company along with his cash register patents and formed the National Cash Register Company (NCR).

In 1906, Charles F. Kettering, a leading engineer at the company, helped develop the first electric cash register, which propelled NCR into the national spotlight. NCR also helped develop the US Navy Bombe, a code-breaking machine that helped crack the Enigma machine cipher during World War II.|$|E
5|$|Spain {{discouraged}} <b>manufacturing</b> <b>in</b> its {{colonies and}} limited trade to Spanish goods handled by Spanish merchants and carried on Spanish vessels. Most of the ports, including {{all of those}} in Texas, were closed to commercial vessels {{in the hopes of}} dissuading smugglers. By law, all goods bound for Texas had to be shipped to Veracruz and then transported over the mountains to Mexico City before being sent to Texas. This caused the goods to be very expensive in the Texas settlements. Settlers were often forced to turn to the French for supplies, as the fort at Natchitoches was well-stocked and goods did not have to travel as far. Without many goods to trade, however, the remaining Spanish missionaries and colonists had little to offer the Indians, who remained loyal to the French traders.|$|E

5|$|The {{road was}} {{designed}} as part of Pentonville, a new suburb away from the City and became a local hub for <b>manufacturing</b> <b>in</b> the area. There was some debate over the final route of the road; the original plan to run straight through fields owned by the Skinners Company and the New River Company was rejected in favour of the route further north via Battle Bridge. As it was always {{intended to be a}} main road, a coach service began in 1798 between Paddington and Bank but was quickly withdrawn. The road was turnpiked in 1830 and renamed Pentonville Road after landowner Henry Penton in 1857. Until 1882, the upkeep of the road was paid by the local parish, paying a ground rent to Penton's estate for the disused toll house at No.274.|$|E
5|$|The {{second part}} of the book {{presents}} evidence that globalization is creating a new class divide: those who are able to move to a different community to take advantage of opportunity and those who are rooted. This mobile class of people are differentiating urban areas in terms of values, culture, economic specialization, and other factors, and businesses are following the most talented people to these cities despite high land prices and labor costs. Florida also insists that a disproportionate amount of wealth is being generated in those cities which have been successful in attracting the creative class. Finally, globalization has reduced the importance of resource extraction and <b>manufacturing</b> <b>in</b> the economy and increased the importance of fields in which the creative class participate.|$|E
5|$|By 2010, B {{employed}} twelve engineers, twelve draftsmen and two draftswomen. The {{company has}} made other {{contributions to the}} roller coaster industry. The company built the trains for the Psyclone, a now-demolished wooden roller coaster at Six Flags Magic Mountain. The trains were later used on the park's Colossus wooden roller coaster (until it was refurbished by Rocky Mountain Construction), but were only used during October each year. The trains faced backward and usually raced against trains on the second track, which ran forward. In 2013, B supplied new trains for Steel Dragon 2000, built by D. H.
