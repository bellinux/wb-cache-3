5|$|On 5 June 1984, two Saudi Arabian {{fighter pilots}} shot down two Iranian F-4 fighters. The Royal Saudi Air Force pilots were flying American-built F-15s and fired air-to-air {{missiles}} {{to bring down}} the Iranian planes. The Saudi fighter pilots had KC-135 aerial tanker planes and Boeing E-3 Sentry AWACS surveillance planes assist in the encounter. The aerial fight occurred in Saudi airspace over the Gulf near the Saudi island Al Arabiyah, about 60 <b>miles</b> <b>northeast</b> <b>of</b> Jubail.|$|E
5|$|On the {{afternoon}} of 3 February, about 600 <b>miles</b> <b>northeast</b> <b>of</b> Iceland, U-255 fired a salvo of torpedoes at Convoy RA-52, en route from Murmansk to New York, and hit the 7,460 ton American merchant ship Greylock. The ship attempted to evade the attack, but was holed below the waterline, immediately flooded, and began to list to starboard. Within fifteen minutes the crew of 61 and nine passengers abandoned ship in four lifeboats. A British escort then shelled and sank the crippled ship. U-255 then arrived back at Narvik on 9 February.|$|E

5|$|The nomadic Karankawa Indians {{used the}} bay for hunting {{before the arrival}} of Europeans, but no major human {{settlements}} were ever established. The unincorporated community of Lamar on Live Oak Peninsula is the only substantial community that borders the bay. The cities of Rockport and Fulton on the main Aransas Bay are located only a few miles away, and the bay is usually considered a part of the collective Rockport-Fulton area. The bay is roughly 150 miles southeast of San Antonio and about 40 <b>miles</b> <b>northeast</b> <b>of</b> Corpus Christi.|$|E
5|$|Early August 8, 1840, the Comanches {{surrounded}} the small port of Linnville, Texas, {{which was the}} second largest port in the Republic of Texas at the time, and began pillaging the stores and houses. Linnville, which is now a ghost town, was located 3.5 <b>miles</b> <b>northeast</b> <b>of</b> present-day Port Lavaca. The Comanches reportedly killed three whites, including customs officer Hugh Oran Watts, who had delayed his escape to retrieve a gold watch at his home (reportedly a family heirloom). After killing Watts, the Comanche captured his wife of only three weeks, the former Juliet Constance, and a black woman and child.|$|E
5|$|After {{being kept}} in the Forbidden City for 27 days of mourning, on 3 March 1661 the emperor's corpse was transported in a lavish {{procession}} to Jingshan 景山 (a hillock {{just north of the}} Forbidden City), after which a large amount of precious goods were burned as funeral offerings. Only two years later, in 1653, was the body transported to its final resting place. Contrary to Manchu customs at the time, which usually dictated that a deceased person should be cremated, the Shunzhi Emperor was buried. He was interred in what later {{came to be known as}} the Eastern Qing Tombs, 125 kilometers (75 <b>miles)</b> <b>northeast</b> <b>of</b> Beijing, one of two Qing imperial cemeteries. His tomb is part of the Xiaoling (孝陵) mausoleum complex (known in Manchu as the Hiyoošungga Munggan), which was the first mausoleum to be erected on that site.|$|E

5|$|An area of {{cloudiness}} and rainshowers developed {{several hundred}} miles east-southeast of Bermuda on August 25, likely {{in association with}} a low-level disturbance that formed along a cold front. For several days, it moved southwestward, and, while located on the southwestern end of an upper-level trough {{to the north of}} Puerto Rico, deep convection throughout the system increased. The system tracked westward, and initially remained disorganized while surface pressures remained high. The system turned to a northwest drift, and began to slowly organize on August 30 while located a few hundred <b>miles</b> <b>northeast</b> <b>of</b> the Bahamas. A broad low-pressure area developed on August 31 though convection remained disorganized as winds of 20 to 25mph (32 to 40km/h) were reported in squalls. Conditions remained favorable for continued organization, and convection increased and persisted across the system. The system developed into Tropical Depression Five on September 1 after developing a low-level circulation while located about 140miles (225km) east of Daytona Beach, Florida.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Fay was {{the first}} {{hurricane}} to make landfall on Bermuda since Emily in 1987. The sixth named storm and fifth hurricane of the 2014 Atlantic hurricane season, Fay evolved from a broad weather disturbance several hundred <b>miles</b> <b>northeast</b> <b>of</b> the Lesser Antilles on October 10. Initially a subtropical cyclone with an expansive wind field and asymmetrical cloud field, the storm gradually attained tropical characteristics as it turned north, transitioning into a tropical storm early on October11. Despite being plagued by disruptive wind shear {{for most of its}} duration, Tropical Storm Fay steadily intensified. Veering toward the east, Fay briefly achieved Category 1 hurricane status while making landfall on Bermuda early on October12. Wind shear eventually took its toll on Fay, causing the hurricane to weaken to a tropical storm later that day and degenerate into an open trough early on October13.|$|E
5|$|Phước Long was {{the northernmost}} provincial {{capital in the}} III Corps Tactical Zone, {{approximately}} 75 air <b>miles</b> <b>northeast</b> <b>of</b> Saigon. At the end of December, the North Vietnamese CT-7 and 3rd Divisions, an independent infantry regiment, and armored, anti-aircraft, and heavy artillery support moved out of Cambodia to the attack. The province was defended by five Regional Force battalions, 48 Popular Force platoons and four territorial artillery sections. From his headquarters at Biên Hòa, Lieutenant General Du Quoc Dong, the III Corps commander, augmented this force by sending in the 2nd Battalion, 7th Infantry Regiment of the 5th Division, two artillery sections, and three reconnaissance companies. The battle for the province began on 13 December when PAVN forces began to isolate Phước Long City's overland communications and eliminating static outposts. They then began to bombard Phuoc Luong accurately with heavy artillery and launched a concerted armor/infantry ground attack on the 27th.|$|E

5|$|Fort George Island {{is located}} in Duval County, several <b>miles</b> <b>northeast</b> <b>of</b> {{downtown}} Jacksonville. It is a marsh island {{at the mouth of}} the St. Johns River, surrounded by tidal estuaries, Little Talbot Island, and the Nassau River. The north Atlantic coast of Florida had been inhabited for approximately 12,000 years when Spanish explorer Juan Ponce de León landed near Cape Canaveral in 1513. The Spanish met the Saturiwa, a Timucua tribe, who were the largest group of indigenous people in the region, numbering about 14,000. Bands of Timucua extended into central Florida and south Georgia. An estimated 35 chiefdoms existed in the territory, and their societies were complex with large villages sustained by fishing, hunting, and agriculture, but they frequently warred with each other and unrelated groups of Native Americans. The Spanish concentrated their efforts of exploration and settlement on the Gulf Coast of Florida. By 1562, Jean Ribault led French explorers to the mouth of the St. Johns River where they built a garrison in 1564, calling it Fort Caroline. Within 200 years the population of the indigenous people of Florida was decimated by disease and constant fighting. They left behind evidence of their existence in massive middens or shell mounds filled with discarded food byproducts. On Fort George Island, the shells were primarily oysters.|$|E
