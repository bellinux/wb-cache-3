40|$|Operation {{allocation}} {{refers to}} assignment of operations of part types to machines. This planning decision {{should be made}} with consideration given to <b>material</b> <b>handling.</b> Allocation of <b>material</b> <b>handling</b> resources is quite relevant to the operation allocation problem where the requirement of part movement must be expressly addressed. Without such consideration, planning of this task could result in low <b>machine</b> utilization, low <b>material</b> <b>handling</b> utilization and a longer manufacturing cycle. Thus, <b>material</b> <b>handling</b> systems provide a key integrating function within a manufacturing system. This paper proposes a method for simultaneously determining the operation allocation and <b>material</b> <b>handling</b> selection of an FMS with multiple performance objectives. The 0 - 1 integer programming model is developed to select machines, assign operations of part types to the selected <b>machines,</b> and assign <b>material</b> <b>handling</b> equipment to transport the parts from machine to machine, {{as well as to}} handle the part at a given machine. The selection is based on the compatibility between the <b>material</b> <b>handling</b> equipment and the parts. The objective is to minimize the costs of operations, <b>material</b> <b>handling,</b> <b>machine</b> setups, and to maximize the part-equipment compatibility. A mathematical model is developed and tested with the aid of Lingo 7. 0. The solutions show that there is a trade-off between total cost and part-equipment compatibility. The application of a genetic algorithm as an alternative approach to this combinatorial problem is also described. The comparison between branch and bound approach and genetic algorithm approach is carried in terms of objective functions value and computational time. From the comparison, it appears that mathematical programming is preferable {{to be used in the}} unified model of operation allocation and <b>material</b> <b>handling</b> system selection.

5|$|After {{years of}} {{persistence}} and attempts at marketing, Evans's designs were finally given a trial on larger scales and adopted elsewhere. A breakthrough came in 1789 when the Ellicotts, a progressively minded Quaker family in Baltimore, invited Evans to refit their mills on the Patapsco River. The refits proved a success, and Evans worked with Jonathan Ellicott {{to develop a}} modified form of Archimedean screw that could act as a horizontal conveyor to work alongside the vertically orientated bucket elevators. He added a rake-drill and conveyor belt to his designs, and now possessed {{a full complement of}} <b>materials</b> <b>handling</b> <b>machines</b> for just about every possible configuration. In 1790, Evans moved from Newport to Wilmington and constructed a working model of his designs in the town. Evans's inventions were given a major boost when leading miller Joseph Tatnall converted his mills to the Evans system, and estimated that in one year the changes saved his operation a small fortune amounting to $37,000. Local millers quickly followed suit, and Brandywine Village was soon a showcase for Evans's milling technology. After almost a decade, the Brandywine millers were finally convinced, and within a short period automated mills began to spread across the eastern seaboard. In 1790, upon introduction of federal patent law, Evans immediately applied for protection for his milling designs and was granted the third US patent, with his application personally examined and approved by Secretary of State Thomas Jefferson, Secretary of War Henry Knox, and Attorney-General Edmund Randolph.|$|R
40|$|Objective: The role of {{occupational}} hazards in occupational injury may be mediated by individual factors across various age groups. This study assessed the role {{of occupational}} hazards as well as contribution of individual factors to injuries among Indian and French coalminers. Material and Methods: We conducted a case-control study on 245 injured workers and on 330 controls without any injuries from Indian coal mines using face-to-face interviews, and a retrospective study on 516 French coalminers using a self-administered questionnaire including potential occupational and personal factors. Data were analyzed using logistic models. Results: The annual rate of injuries was 5. 5 % for Indian coalminers and 14. 9 % for the French ones. Logistic model including all occupational factors showed that major injury causes were: hand-tools, <b>material</b> <b>handling,</b> <b>machines,</b> and environment/work-geological/strata conditions among Indian miners (adjusted oddsratios 2. 01 to 3. 30) and biomechanical exposure score among French miners (adjusted odds-ratio 3. 01 for score the 1 - 4, 3. 47 for the score 5 - 7, and 7. 26 for score ‚â• 8, vs. score 0). Personal factors among Indian and French coalminers reduced/exacerbated the roles of various occupational hazards to a different extent depending on workers' age.

30|$|According to Bayram and Sahin (2016), and Kia et al.

Construction of part families and machine cells, and assignment of part families to respective machine cells is done by optimizing a selected set of performance measures such as <b>material</b> <b>handling</b> cost, <b>machine</b> setup cost, grouping efficacy and exceptional elements (Deep and Singh 2015; Bagheri and Bashiri 2014; Rafiei and Ghodsi 2013).|$|R

As the war progressed, the use of slave labour increased massively. Prisoners of war and civilian [...] "undesirables" [...] were brought in from occupied territories. Millions of Jews, Slavs and other conquered peoples were used as slave labourers by German corporations, such as Thyssen, Krupp, IG Farben, Bosch, Daimler-Benz, Demag, Henschel, Junkers, Messerschmitt, Siemens, and even Volkswagen, not to mention the German subsidiaries of foreign firms, such as Fordwerke (a subsidiary of the Ford Motor Company) and Adam Opel AG (a subsidiary of General Motors) among others. Once the war had begun, the foreign subsidiaries were seized and nationalized by the Nazi-controlled German state, and work conditions there deteriorated as they did throughout German industry. About 12 million forced labourers, most of whom were Eastern Europeans, were employed in the German war economy inside Nazi Germany throughout the war. The German need for slave labour grew to the point that even children were kidnapped to work in an operation called the Heu-Aktion.More than 2,000 German companies profited from slave labour during the Nazi era, including Deutsche Bank and Siemens.|$|R

They presented a hierarchical genetic algorithm to solve it. Logendran (1993) developed a mathematical programming model to minimize part inter-cell and intra-cell movements and proposed a heuristic algorithm to solve it. Chen (1998) proposed an integer programming model to minimize <b>material</b> <b>handling</b> and <b>machine</b> cost and reconfiguration cost {{to design a}} sustainable cellular manufacturing system in a dynamic environment.

30|$|Consider a {{manufacturing}} system processing P products in T number of equal planning periods where {{the demand for}} the products may vary from period to period deterministically. The system consists of M machines to be distributed over N distinct locations (N= M) and reconfiguration may {{take place at the}} beginning of each planning period. There are a total of R resource elements, and each machine has some of these REs, representing the capabilities it shares with other machines, as well as those that are unique to it. Processing a part requires a set of operations to be performed in a given sequence. A particular operation can be performed using a given resource element, and machines possessing this element are considered as alternative routes for this operation. The processing time for each operation is known. In a given time period, a demand for a part can be satisfied by producing it in-house, subcontracting its production, or using inventory carried over from the previous period. Without loss of generality, we assume a part inventory is zero at the beginning of the first period and at the end of the last period. A production lot of a part may be split into smaller sublots that are to be processed independently. The material flow cost of a part is linearly related to the distance it travels using the <b>material</b> <b>handling</b> system. The cost to relocate a machine is also assumed to be linearly related to the relocation distance. However, we assume that the distance between a pair of locations when moving a part is not the same as the distance between the same pair of locations when relocating a machine. This is because parts are moved using a <b>material</b> <b>handling</b> system (e.g., AGV with a specified path), whereas machines are relocated in a different way. The workload of the system in a given time period is evenly distributed among the machine tools that share the particular resource element being used.

40|$|Among {{many issues}} {{involved}} {{within the field}} of manufacturing systems, the design of facilities layout is an ongoing and interesting research field, where new solutions and approaches are sought to determine the appropriate location and physical organisation of the resources in manufacturing systems. Issues such as space, <b>material</b> <b>handling,</b> <b>machine</b> placement and orientation, utilities location, and environmental factors are important features that may be considered when establishing the requirements of a facility layout design. The facility layout design can be thought of in terms of interconnecting work centres that can be represented by a set of interrelated vertices in a graph. Directed graphs can be used to characterise each product operation sequence, which combined into a single directed graph, be used to represent appropriately a layout design. Doing this together with the <b>material</b> <b>handling</b> system requirements, will allow better facilities planning and may improve process sequences that should be reflected in better designs. The Strong Component Based Methodology proposed here, obtains a graphical structure from the integration of various products and using their operation sequences to produce a relationship diagram. The attributes of the resultant structure are used to create this diagram. The objective is to obtain layouts that minimise <b>material</b> <b>handling,</b> that is, {{as close as possible to}} that which can be obtained with dedicated facilities for each product family but without the capital costs involved in the case of the latter. Encouraging results have been obtained by considering strong components, a feature of directed graphs, because less computational resources than in the case of many previous methods, which use Quadratic Assignment Problem approaches, are required to formulate and produce a relationship diagram. Moreover, this approach produces faster designs than other graph theoretic approaches because it avoids using planar and dual graphs. These characteristics allow the Strong Components approach to address more complex situations and obtain comparable or better solutions than previous approaches. The proposed Strong Component approach is a robust and versatile tool to support layout designs. It is a robust methodology because it provides efficient relationship diagrams even in cases when the resultant structure has relatively few strong component relationships. It is a versatile approach, because it can address various situations and can use different criteria to create layouts. Thus, the proposed approach offers effective-economical relationship diagrams to produce the same set of products as when producing them in dedicated facilities...|$|R

These challenges include investigation of the possibility of combining selected operations, scheduling arrivals to the process from upstream operations, quantity and configuration of machines appropriate to each operation, comparing effectiveness of various line-balancing alternatives, sizes and locations of in-process buffers, choice of material-handling and transport methods, and allocation of manufacturing personnel to various tasks such as <b>material</b> <b>handling</b> and <b>machine</b> repair. We then describe our approach to meeting these challenges via the integration of analytical methods into the traditional methods of manufacturing process design. This approach comprised the gathering and analysis of input data (both qualitative and quantitative), the construction, verification, and validation of a simulation model, the statistical analysis of model results, and the combination of these results with engineering cost analysis and optimization methods to obtain significant improvements to the original process design...|$|R
