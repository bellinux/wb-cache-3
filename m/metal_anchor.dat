The patients were evaluated using the Carter-Rowe score and the Samilson and Prieto classification. The mean age at the time of surgery was 30 years. The mean length of follow-up was 42. 7 months (ranging from 18 to 74). 85 % of the patients were male. Results: The mean Carter-Rowe score was 83 points (ranging from 30 to 100) including 31 excellent results, 7 good, 3 fair and 8 poor. Recurrent dislocation was observed in 16 % (8 patients), and 37. 5 % of them were of traumatic origin. Joint degeneration was present in 32. 5 % of the cases, including 5 cases of grade 1, 6 cases of grade 2 and 2 cases of grade 3. The average loss of external rotation was 12 ° and the loss of anterior elevation was 8 °. There was a statistically significant relationship (p < 0. 05) between arthritis and age at first dislocation, age at surgery and crackling. 92 % of the patients reported high degrees of satisfaction after the procedure.

Suspicious of a metallic allergy, a dermatologist performed a patch testing 6 months after the first surgery.

This technical evolution has allowed for arthroscopic surgery outcomes comparable to those in open surgeries.

40|$|Purpose: Although {{surgical}} arthroscopic {{repair of}} rotator cuff {{has become much}} more common as surgeons have developed proficient techniques, it is still technically difficult. The {{purpose of this study was}} to evaluate the clinical results and the usefulness of mini-open repair in large and massive size tears. Materials & Methods: From January 2000 to December 2004, sixteen patients were treated with mini-open repair. There were 10 male and 6 female patients with the average age of 62. 5 years. The size of tear was massive in 4 cases and large in 12 cases. All tears were repaired with <b>metal</b> <b>anchor</b> sutures. The mean duration of follow-up peri-od was 23 months.

Results: Five patients showed excellent results, five good, and two fair in large tears while one patient showed excellent result, one good, and two fair in massive tears. Poor outcome was not seen during the follow-up period. There was no significant relationship between the patient’s age and the size of tear, and postoperative results.

The primary surgeries intended to treat 20 anterior traumatic instabilities (71. 5 %), one posterior instability (3. 5 %), one slap injury (3. 5 %), six procedures for treating injuries on the rotator cuff (21. 5 %).

All patients were evaluated by the UCLA (University of California at Los Angeles) index criteria. Results: In all patients, arthroscopic reviews were made.
