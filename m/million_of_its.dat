Federal relief programs began contributing funds in May 1933, but St. Louis issued a second bond for relief funds in February 1935 for $3.6 million. Of the $68 million spent on relief in St. Louis from 1932 to 1936, $50 million came from the federal government, $12 million came from the city and local agencies, and only $6 million from the state.|$|E
25|$|On June 16, 2009, Judge Burton Lifland {{approved}} the settlement between Picard and Banco Santander SA's Optimal Investment Services. The Optimal SUS fund, one of Madoff's largest feeder funds, {{agreed to pay}} $235 million, about 85% of the $285 million that the Geneva-based hedge fund group redeemed in the 90 days before Madoff was arrested. As of December 2008, Santander had $3.2 billion of clients' money invested with Madoff, a relationship that started in 1996. The fund continues to have claims against Madoff's estate. The largest Spanish bank earned nearly $100 million in management fees in 2006 and 2007 combined selling the feeder fund. Santander lost €17 million ($23.8 <b>million)</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> own money. 70% of its affected clients are in Latin America. In April, Santander offered its clients compensation for losses from the fraud, and 93% of clients affected by the Madoff fraud had accepted, which it originally valued at €1.38 billion.

25|$|The World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, {{as primary}} holders of {{developing}} countries' debt, attach structural adjustment conditionalities {{in return for}} loans which are generally geared toward loan repayment with austerity measures such as the elimination of state subsidies and the privatization of state services. For example, the World Bank presses poor nations to eliminate subsidies for fertilizer even while many farmers cannot afford them at market prices. In Malawi, almost five <b>million</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> 13 million people used to need emergency food aid but after the government changed policy and subsidies for fertilizer and seed were introduced, farmers produced record-breaking corn harvests in 2006 and 2007 as Malawi became a major food exporter. A major proportion of aid from donor nations is tied, mandating that a receiving nation spend on products and expertise originating only from the donor country. US law requires food aid be spent on buying food at home, instead of where the hungry live, and, as a result, half of what is spent is used on transport.|$|E

25|$|Though {{nothing new}} to the {{economic}} history of Argentina, he is often accused of implementing financial policies that may have allowed Argentina's main private enterprises to transfer their debts to the state, transforming their private debt into public obligations. During 1982 and 1983, more than 200 firms (30 economic groups and 106 transnational enterprises) transferred {{a great part of}} their 17 billion dollar debt to the federal government, thanks to secured exchange rates on loan installments. This fraud took place both before and after his very brief turn at the Central Bank, but not while he was in charge. In a speech in September 1982 he was forced renounce and express his opposition to the transfer of debt to the state. He inherited this practice from Martínez de Hoz himself (whose chief interest, steelmaker Acindar, had unloaded US$700 <b>million</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> debts in this way). Moreover, Cavallo subjected payments covered by these exchange rate guarantees to indexation; this latter stipulation was dropped by his successor, Julio González del Solar. In either case, the mechanism turning private debt into liabilities of the state continued even after the advent of democracy under Raúl Alfonsín (1983–89) and into the economic crisis that surrounded the peso's last sharp devaluation in early 2002.|$|E
25|$|The Jagiellon dynasty {{spanned the}} late Middle Ages and early Modern Era of Polish history. Beginning with the Lithuanian Grand Duke Jogaila (Władysław II Jagiełło), the Jagiellon dynasty (1386–1572) formed the Polish–Lithuanian union. The {{partnership}} brought vast Lithuania-controlled Rus' areas into Poland's {{sphere of influence}} and proved beneficial for the Poles and Lithuanians, who coexisted and cooperated {{in one of the}} largest political entities in Europe for the next four centuries. In the Baltic Sea region Poland's struggle with the Teutonic Knights continued and culminated in the Battle of Grunwald (1410), where a combined Polish-Lithuanian army inflicted a decisive victory against the Teutonic Knights, allowing for territorial expansion of both nations into the far north region of Livonia. In 1466, after the Thirteen Years' War, King Casimir IV Jagiellon gave royal consent to the Peace of Thorn, which created the future Duchy of Prussia, a Polish vassal. The Jagiellon dynasty at one point also established dynastic control over the kingdoms of Bohemia (1471 onwards) and Hungary. In the south, Poland confronted the Ottoman Empire and the Crimean Tatars (by whom they were attacked on 75 separate occasions between 1474 and 1569), and in the east helped Lithuania fight the Grand Duchy of Moscow. Some historians estimate that Crimean Tatar slave-raiding cost Poland-Lithuania one <b>million</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> population between the years of 1494 and 1694.|$|E
25|$|As {{a result}} of the Vietnam (Second Indochina) War (1954–75), Viet Cong and regular People's Army of Vietnam (PAVN) forces of the DRV unified the country under {{communist}} rule. In this conflict, the North and the Viet Cong—with logistical support from the Soviet Union—defeated the Army of the Republic of Vietnam, which sought to maintain South Vietnamese independence {{with the support of the}} U.S. military, whose troop strength peaked at 540,000 during the communist-led Tet Offensive in 1968. The North did not abide by the terms of the 1973 Paris Agreement, which officially settled the war by calling for free elections in the South and peaceful reunification. Two years after the withdrawal of the last U.S. forces in 1973, Saigon, the capital of South Vietnam, fell to the communists, and the South Vietnamese army surrendered in 1975. In 1976, the government of united Vietnam renamed Saigon as Hồ Chí Minh City in honor of Hồ, who died in 1969. The war left Vietnam devastated, with the total death toll standing at between 966,000 and 3.8 million, and many thousands more crippled by weapons and substances such as napalm and Agent Orange. The government of Vietnam says that 4 <b>million</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> citizens were exposed to Agent Orange, and as many as 3 million have suffered illnesses because of it; these figures include the children of people who were exposed. The Red Cross of Vietnam estimates that up to 1 million people are disabled or have health problems due to contaminated Agent Orange.
