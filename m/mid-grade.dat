5|$|None of the Peace dollar mintages are {{particularly}} rare, and A Guide Book of United States Coins (or Red Book) lists low-grade circulated specimens for most years for {{little more than}} the coin's bullion value. Two exceptions are the first year of issue 1921 Peace dollar, minted only at the Philadelphia mint and issued in high relief, and the low-mintage 1928-P Peace dollar. The prices for the 1928-P dollar are much lower than its mintage of 360,649 would suggest, because the U.S. mint announced that limited quantities would be produced and many were saved. In contrast the 1934-S dollar was not saved in great numbers so that prices for circulated specimens are fairly inexpensive but <b>mid-grade</b> uncirculated specimens can cost thousands of dollars.|$|E

25|$|The {{octane rating}} of typical commercially {{available}} gasoline varies by country. In Finland, Sweden, and Norway, 95 RON {{is the standard}} for regular unleaded gasoline and 98 RON is also available as a more expensive option. In the UK, ordinary regular unleaded gasoline is 95 RON (commonly available), premium unleaded gasoline is always 97 RON, and super unleaded is usually 97–98 RON. However, both Shell and BP produce fuel at 102 RON for cars with high-performance engines and in 2006 the supermarket chain Tesco began to sell super unleaded gasoline rated at 99 RON. In the US, octane ratings in unleaded fuels can vary between 85 and 87 AKI (91–92 RON) for regular, through 89–90 AKI (94–95 RON) for <b>mid-grade</b> (equivalent to European regular), up to 90–94 AKI (95–99 RON) for premium (European premium).|$|E
500|$|Selective {{breeding}} {{for speed}} and racing ability led to {{improvements in the}} size of horses and winning times {{by the middle of the}} 19thcentury. Bay Middleton, a winner of the Epsom Derby, stood over 16hands high, a full hand higher than the Darley Arabian. Winning times had improved to such a degree that many felt further improvement by adding additional Arabian bloodlines was impossible. This was borne out in 1885, when a race was held between a Thoroughbred, Iambic, considered a <b>mid-grade</b> runner, and the best Arabian of the time, Asil. The race was over , and although Iambic was handicapped by carrying [...] more than Asil, he still managed to beat Asil by 20lengths.

2500|$|The tornado {{produced}} {{a mixture of}} EF1 and EF2 damage in this densely built-up commercial and industrial area. A casino on the east {{bank of the river}} had roof and siding damage and a tree limb was thrown into one of the walls. Many trees, power poles, and highway signs were downed in the area, a hotel sustained shingle and window damage, and the canopy was damaged at a Mobil gas station. The roof was damaged and windows were broken at an ITT Technical Institute building and a vehicle was flipped in the parking lot. Nearby, large doors were blown in at a warehouse-type building and three delivery trucks were blown over. Trees and power lines were downed and several homes and commercial buildings were damaged at mainly EF1 strength in nearby Bridgeton to the east of SSM DePaul Health Center. One apartment building in Bridgeton sustained EF2 damage, and debris fell onto vehicles and trees fell onto houses in the area as well. The tornado weakened to EF1 strength and maintained this intensity for the remainder of its path. It moved just north of the St. Louis base of the Missouri Air National Guard at Lambert–St. Louis International Airport in Berkeley (which had previously taken a direct hit from an EF4 tornado on April 22, 2011), causing tree and power poles damage. The tornado moved into residential areas on the northern side of Ferguson, [...] downing trees and power poles, a few of which landed on homes and cars. More trees were downed and one home suffered minor roof damage in the Dellwood area. The tornado downed even more trees as it crossed Interstate 270 again east of Florissant. Several trees landed on houses in the area and seven power poles were snapped along the interstate. The tornado moved north of Bellefontaine Neighbors, then northeast of town as it moved along Interstate 270. [...] in diameter trees were downed, one of which fell onto a house. It moved due east, causing widespread tree damage as it moved into the Riverview area in the extreme northeastern sections of the City of St. Louis. The tornado downed many trees {{on the banks of the}} Mississippi River, where it lifted at 8:25p.m. (0125 UTC) just northeast of exit 34 on Interstate 270.

50|$|For home arcade controllers, {{the most}} common {{restrictor}} gate used in modding is the octagonal gate. This is because most <b>mid-grade</b> and higher controllers use Japanese-style sticks with a traditional square gate—which is chosen because it has an equal area of throw for each direction. However, because of the sharp corners, the stick can get stuck in the diagonals if the player is unaccustomed to using a square gate. The octagonal gate allows for continuous motion along the edges using inertia, more similar to the circular motion of American sticks. In a fighting game many 360 degree motion special moves are usually executed easier with an octonal gate while charge characters and characters which utilize many directional based moves will benefit more from a stick with a square gate.|$|E
