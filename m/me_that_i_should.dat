He arranged for his daughter's first job, at the influential Biba boutique, {{when she was}} 15. The next year, she left North London Collegiate and began a training program at Harrods. At her parents' behest, she also took fashion classes at a nearby school. Soon she gave them up, saying, [...] "You either know fashion or you don't." [...] Another older boyfriend, Richard Neville, gave her {{her first experience of}} magazine production at his popular and controversial Oz.|$|E
500|$|Those in the {{lifeboats}} were {{horrified to}} {{hear the sound of}} what Lawrence Beesley called [...] "every possible emotion of human fear, despair, agony, fierce resentment and blind anger mingled– I am certain of those– with notes of infinite surprise, as though each one were saying, 'How is it possible that this awful thing is happening to <b>me?</b> <b>That</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> be caught in this death trap? Jack Thayer compared it to the sound of [...] "locusts on a summer night", while George Rheims, who jumped moments before Titanic sank, described it as [...] "a dismal moaning sound which I won't ever forget; it came from those poor people who were floating around, calling for help. It was horrifying, mysterious, supernatural." ...|$|E
2500|$|Before she {{was three}} years old, her mother began taking Burlingame to the Roger Williams Church; Sunday School and church {{in the morning and}} again to church in the afternoon. When 15, her Sunday school teacher asked her if she wasn't ready to become a Christian. She stated, “The thought at once came {{forcibly}} to <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> never become a Christian in future time, it must be in some present moment.” She made the decision and was baptized in April, 1851, by Rev. Eli Noyes, returned from India, and pastor of the Roger Williams Church. She went on to say that, “The Roger Williams Church opened its doors to advocates of anti-slavery, temperance, and the broader life for women. Few churches of the other denominations did." ...|$|E

60|$|The {{next best}} solution, {{it seemed to}} <b>me,</b> was <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> walk home: and this I at once proposed.|$|R

2500|$|... "Where did {{the name}} of the {{organization}} come from? It was while speaking to a West Indian Negro who was a passenger with me from Southampton, who was returning home to the East Indies from Basutoland with his Basuto wife, I further learned of the horrors of native life in Africa. He related to me in conversation such horrible and pitiable tales that my heart bled within me. Retiring from the conversation to my cabin, all day and the following night I pondered over the subject matter of that conversation, and at midnight, lying flat on my back, the vision and thought came to <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> name the organization the Universal Negro Improvement Association and African Communities (Imperial) League. Such a name I thought would embrace the purpose of all black humanity. Thus to the world a name was born, a movement created, and a man became known." ...|$|E
2500|$|Erickson was an irrepressible {{practical}} joker, {{and it was}} {{not uncommon}} for him to slip indirect suggestions into all kinds of situations, including in his own books, papers, lectures and seminars. For example, a student arrived at one of the five-day intensive seminars he held in his home office {{near the end of his}} life. When Erickson asked why she had come, she replied frankly: [...] "My teacher told <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> come to see you before you died." [...] Erickson smiled and said: [...] "You tell him that dying is the last thing I intend to do." [...] The group laughed at the pun. Then Erickson said, with a twinkle in his eye, [...] "Do you want to know how to avoid dying? Always wake up every morning. And do you want to know how to ensure that you will wake up every morning?", he continued, [...] "Drink lots of liquids before you go to sleep!" ...|$|E
2500|$|A {{contest for}} fans {{to create an}} album cover image for 20 Y.O. was {{announced}} on July 18, 2006, through Yahoo!. Fans were able to create and submit their own album-cover design, with four winners being chosen by Jackson herself. The first million copies of the album would be published with these fan-created covers. The concept of the contest was to create an image that best celebrated Jackson's past twenty years. The singer hand-picked dozens of images that span over twenty years of Jackson's career were made available for download for use in creating the design. [...] "They told <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> pick maybe 20, 30 photos, but I think I went a little crazy. I picked way more than that. I gave them {{some of the new}} stuff I just shot for the album cover shoot. So they have some really recent photos as well as some stuff from 20 years ago", Jackson confessed. For the official artwork for the album, Jackson appears sporting big hair and a wrist full of bracelets.|$|E

I have no doubt I could live here very happily if I had anybody near <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> liked. <b>I</b> <b>should</b> not wish to have to depend altogether on Mr. Possitt for society." ...|$|R

2500|$|In {{the buildup}} to the 2004 presidential election, a dispute {{in the press}} {{occurred}} between O'Keefe and NASA climatologist James Hansen. In 2003, it was claimed, O'Keefe warned Hansen not to discuss humanity's role in global warming. [...] "The administrator [...] interrupted me," [...] Dr. Hansen said in the New York Times, [...] "he told <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> not talk about dangerous anthropogenic interference, {{because we do not}} know enough or have enough evidence for what would constitute dangerous anthropogenic interference." [...] O'Keefe's spokesperson said O'Keefe had not meant to admonish Hansen or suggest that research efforts should be cut. The New York Times reported that [...] "Dr. Franco Einaudi, director of the NASA Earth Sciences Directorate at the Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, and Dr. Hansen's supervisor, said he was at the meeting between Dr. Hansen and Mr. O'Keefe. Dr. Einaudi confirmed that Mr. O'Keefe had interrupted the presentation to say that these were [...] "delicate issues" [...] {{and there was a lot}} of uncertainty about them. But, he added: [...] "Whether it is obvious to take that as an order or not is a question of judgment. Personally, I did not take it as an order." ...|$|E
2500|$|Reading [...] the Midrash {{told that}} the people {{realized}} that they had spoken against Moses and prostrated themselves before him and beseeched him to pray to God on their behalf. The Midrash taught that then [...] immediately reports, “And Moses prayed,” to demonstrate the meekness of Moses, who {{did not hesitate to}} seek mercy for them, and also to show the power of repentance, for as soon as they said, “We have sinned,” Moses was immediately reconciled to them, for one who {{is in a position to}} forgive should not be cruel by refusing to forgive. In the same strain, [...] reports, “And Abraham prayed to God; and God healed” (after Abimelech had wronged Abraham and asked for forgiveness). And similarly, [...] reports, “And the Lord changed the fortune of Job, when he prayed for his friends” (after they had slandered him). The Midrash taught that when one person wrongs another but then says, “I have sinned,” the victim is called a sinner if the victim does not forgive the offender. For in [...] Samuel told the Israelites, “As for me, far be it from <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> sin against the Lord in ceasing to pray for you,” and Samuel told them this after they came and said, “We have sinned,” as [...] indicates when it reports that the people said, “Pray for your servants [...] [...] [...] for we have added to all our sins this evil.” ...|$|E

5000|$|Ibn Mas’ood, one of Muhammad’s companions, said: [...] "That <b>I</b> <b>should</b> {{swear by}} Allah upon a lie is more {{preferable}} to <b>me</b> than <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> swear by another upon the truth." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I cannot," [...] {{said the}} Ram. [...] "The Archer told <b>me</b> <b>that</b> on some day of which I had no knowledge, {{he would send}} a dart through <b>me,</b> and <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> die in very great pain." ...|$|R
6000|$|Vent. Thank your kindness. You said I loved you; and, in recompence, You bid me turn a traitor:--Did I think You {{would have}} used <b>me</b> thus? <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> die With a hard thought of you? ...|$|R
