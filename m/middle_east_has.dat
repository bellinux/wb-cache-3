5|$|The {{aesthetic}} {{value of}} tilings {{has long been}} appreciated, and remains a source of interest in them; here the visual appearance (rather than the formal defining properties) of Penrose tilings has attracted attention. The similarity with some decorative patterns used in the <b>Middle</b> <b>East</b> <b>has</b> been noted; the physicists Peter J. Lu and Paul Steinhardt have presented evidence that a Penrose tiling underlies some examples of medieval Islamic geometric patterns, such as the girih (strapwork) tilings at the Darb-e Imam shrine in Isfahan.|$|E

25|$|The {{dispersal}} of Neolithic culture from the <b>Middle</b> <b>East</b> <b>has</b> recently {{been associated with}} the distribution of human genetic markers. In Europe, the spread of the Neolithic culture has been associated with distribution of the E1b1b lineages and Haplogroup J that are thought to have arrived in Europe from North Africa and the Near East respectively. In Africa, the spread of farming, and notably the Bantu expansion, is associated with the {{dispersal of}} Y-chromosome haplogroup E1b1a from West Africa.|$|E
25|$|The Indian culinary {{scene in}} the <b>Middle</b> <b>East</b> <b>has</b> been {{influenced}} greatly by the large Indian diaspora in these countries. Centuries of trade relations and cultural exchange resulted in a significant influence on each region's cuisines. The use of the tandoor, which originated in northwestern India, is an example. The large influx of Indian expatriates into the Middle Eastern countries during the 1970s and 1980s led to the booming of Indian restaurants to cater to this population and was also widely influenced by the local and international cuisines.|$|E

25|$|Ford's market {{presence}} in the <b>Middle</b> <b>East</b> <b>has</b> traditionally been small, partly due to previous Arab boycotts of companies dealing with Israel. Ford and Lincoln vehicles are currently marketed in ten countries in the region. Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, and the United Arab Emirates are the biggest markets. Ford also established itself in Egypt in 1926 but faced an uphill battle during the 1950s due to the hostile nationalist business environment. Ford's distributor in Saudi Arabia announced in February 2003 that it had sold 100,000 Ford and Lincoln vehicles since commencing sales in November 1986. Half of the Ford and Lincoln vehicles sold in that country were Ford Crown Victorias. In 2004, Ford sold 30,000 units in the region, falling far short of General Motors' 88,852 units and Nissan Motors' 75,000 units.|$|E
25|$|Another {{source of}} dispute {{has been the}} Baghdad stone {{inscription}} in a Turkish script, which some interpret saying Baba Nanak Fakir was there in 1511-1512, other interpret it stating 1521-1522 (and that {{he lived in the}} Middle East for 11 years away from his family), while others particularly Western scholars stating that the stone inscription is from the 19th century and the stone is not a reliable evidence that Guru Nanak visited Baghdad in early 16th century. Further, beyond the stone, no evidence or mention of Guru Nanak's journey in the <b>Middle</b> <b>East</b> <b>has</b> been found in any other Middle Eastern textual or epigraphical records. Claims have been asserted of additional inscriptions, but no one has been able to locate and verify them. The Baghdad inscription remains the basis of writing by Indian scholars that Guru Nanak journeyed in the Middle East, with some claiming he visited Jerusalem, Mecca, Vatican, Azerbaijan and Sudan.|$|E

2500|$|The lira, {{along with}} the related {{currencies}} of Europe and the <b>Middle</b> <b>East,</b> <b>has</b> {{its roots in the}} ancient Roman unit of weight known as the libra which referred to the Troy pound of silver. The Roman libra adoption of the currency spread it throughout Europe and the Near East, where it continued to be used into medieval times. The Turkish lira, the French livre (until 1794), the Italian lira (until 2002), and the British pound (a translated version of the Roman libra; the word [...] "pound" [...] as a unit of weight is still abbreviated as [...] "lb.") are the modern descendants of the ancient currency.|$|E
2500|$|Advice on cousin {{marriage}} in the <b>Middle</b> <b>East</b> <b>has</b> not always been positive, however. Al-Maydani makes the following exhortation: [...] "Marry the distant, but not the near." [...] The reason given for the inadvisability of cousin marriages is most frequently {{the belief that the}} offspring of such marriages will be feeble. An early Arab author, Ibn 'Abd Rabbihi, states in his work Kitab al-'iqd al-farid of a hero that [...] "He is a hero not borne by the cousin (of his father), he is not weakly; for the seed of relations brings forth feeble fruit." [...] Abu Hamid al-Ghazali (1059–1111) in his principal ethical work, the Ihya 'ulum al-din, gives the different reason that [...] "the woman should not be a near relative of the husband, because near relationship diminishes the sensuous desire." [...] Finally the ancient Arabic poet 'Amr b. Kulthum states, [...] "Do not marry in your own family, for domestic enmity arises therefrom." [...] Similar sentiments are expressed by certain Moroccan and Syrian proverbs.|$|E

2500|$|China has officially cited {{resource}} depletion and environmental concerns as {{the reasons for}} a nationwide crackdown on its rare-earth mineral production sector. However, non-environmental motives have also been imputed to China's rare-earth policy. According to The Economist, [...] "Slashing their exports of rare-earth metals… is all about moving Chinese manufacturers up the supply chain, so they can sell valuable finished goods to the world rather than lowly raw materials." [...] Furthermore, China currently has an effective monopoly on the world's REE Value Chain. (all the refineries and processing plants that transform the raw ore into valuable elements). In the words of Deng Xiaoping, a Chinese politician from the late 1970s to the late 1980s, [...] "The <b>Middle</b> <b>East</b> <b>has</b> oil; we have rare earths ... it is of extremely important strategic significance; we must be sure to handle the rare earth issue properly and make the fullest use of our country's advantage in rare earth resources." ...|$|E

When the moderator asked if Paul was suggesting that the US had [...] "invited" [...] the 9/11 attacks, Paul argued with fellow candidate Rudy Giuliani, who responded to Paul's suggestion that the U.S. {{pay attention to the}} underlying causes of terrorism by saying [...] "I don't think I've heard that before, and I've heard some pretty absurd explanations for September 11. And I would ask the congressman to withdraw that comment and tell us that he didn't really mean that."
