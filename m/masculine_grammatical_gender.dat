50|$|Among all Western Iranian {{languages}} only Zaza and Kurmanji {{distinguish between}} <b>masculine</b> and feminine <b>grammatical</b> <b>gender.</b> Each noun belongs {{to one of}} those two genders. In order to correctly decline any noun and any modifier or other type of word affecting that noun, one must identify whether the noun is feminine or masculine. Most nouns have inherent gender. However, some nominal roots have variable gender, i.e. they may function as either masculine or feminine nouns. This distinguishes Zaza from many other Western Iranian languages that have lost this feature over time.|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} two {{attempts}} to replicate a widely-cited but never fully published experiment in which German and Spanish speakers {{were asked to}} associate adjectives with nouns of <b>masculine</b> and feminine <b>grammatical</b> <b>gender</b> (Boroditsky et al. 2003). The researchers claim that speakers associated more stereotypically female adjectives with grammatically feminine nouns and more stereotypically male adjectives with grammatically masculine nouns. We {{were not able to}} replicate the results either in a word association task or in an analogous primed lexical decision task. This suggests that the results of the original experiment were either an artifact of some non-documented aspect of the experimental procedure or a statistical fluke. The question whether speakers assign sex-based interpretations to <b>grammatical</b> <b>gender</b> categories at all cannot be answered definitively, as the results in the published literature vary considerably. However, our experiments show that if such an effect exists, it is not strong enough to be measured indirectly via the priming of adjectives by nouns...|$|R

It is likely that Lango shares many traits common to other languages in the Lotuko cluster and in Eastern Nilotic more generally, such as Verb-Subject-Object word order, two morphological verb classes, <b>masculine</b> and feminine <b>grammatical</b> <b>gender</b> for nouns, and a highly irregular number marking system involving a range of morphemes to mark singular, singulative, and plural. In terms of phonology, Lango is likely to have the Advanced Tongue Root contrast noted for closely related languages, and a consonant inventory including plosives at four or five places of articulation, with a voicing contrast at most of these.|$|R

40|$|It {{has been}} argued that animate {{entities}} are referred to with more attenuated expressions than inanimate entities, because they are more accessible in memory. Two previously untested claims made for Dutch suggest that the situation may be more complex. Firstly, it has been stated that full pronouns can only refer to animate entities, while reduced pronouns can also refer to inanimate entities. This seems to be inconsistent with the accessibility account. Secondly, inanimate entities may be pronominalized less to avoid gender-marked expressions when <b>grammatical</b> <b>gender</b> is unclear. Using a sentence completion task, we tested these claims by investigating the effect of animacy on both the choice of pronouns versus more specific expressions and the choice of reduced versus full pronouns in Dutch. We compared speakers of Netherlandic Dutch, who have generally lost intuitions about <b>masculine</b> and feminine <b>grammatical</b> <b>gender</b> of nouns, with speakers of Belgian Dutch, for whom these intuitions are still relatively intact. Both groups showed an effect of animacy on pronominalization, suggesting that this effect cannot only be explained as a gender avoidance strategy. At the same time, the choice between full and reduced pronouns cannot be explained by accessibility. Implications for theories of reference production are discussed. © 2014 Elsevier B. V.

5000|$|... "Blond", {{with its}} {{continued}} gender-varied usage, {{is one of}} few adjectives in written English to retain separate <b>masculine</b> and feminine <b>grammatical</b> <b>genders.</b> Each of the two forms, however, is pronounced identically. American Heritage's Book of English Usage propounds that, insofar as [...] "a blonde" [...] {{can be used to}} describe a woman but not a man who is merely said to possess blond(e) hair, the term {{is an example of a}} [...] "sexist stereotype whereby women are primarily defined by their physical characteristics." [...] The Oxford English Dictionary (OED) records that the phrase [...] "big blond beast" [...] was used in the 20th century to refer specifically to men [...] "of the Nordic type" [...] (that is to say, blond-haired). The OED also records that blond as an adjective is especially used with reference to women, in which case it is likely to be spelt [...] "blonde", citing three Victorian usages of the term. The masculine version is used in the plural, in [...] "blonds of the European race", in a citation from 1833 Penny cyclopedia, which distinguishes genuine blondness as a Caucasian feature distinct from albinism.|$|R
40|$|It is {{generally}} assumed that speakers of <b>grammatical</b> <b>gender</b> languages consider <b>grammatical</b> <b>gender</b> arbitrary, but this assumption {{has never been}} tested. Research shows that the <b>grammatical</b> <b>gender</b> of nouns can affect perceptions of the masculinity or femininity of the noun's referent in speakers of languages with masculine and feminine noun classes. However, bilingualism facilitates the development of lexical arbitrariness awareness, and could therefore affect awareness of <b>grammatical</b> <b>gender</b> arbitrariness. This study then compared three groups of young adult speakers of a <b>grammatical</b> <b>gender</b> language: monolinguals, early bilinguals, and instructed second language learners. Participants evaluated the gender assignments of 25 nouns of entities (animals, abstract concepts, natural kinds, and artefacts), and answered open and closed questions about <b>grammatical</b> <b>gender.</b> Participants considered <b>grammatical</b> <b>gender</b> as semantically motivated and mostly related gender assignments to perceived masculine or feminine connotations of referents. Knowledge of an additional <b>grammatical</b> <b>gender</b> language was linked to increased awareness of the arbitrariness of first language gender assignments in both early bilinguals and later instructed learners. It is argued that <b>grammatical</b> <b>gender</b> awareness deserves further investigation. Knowing more than one <b>grammatical</b> <b>gender</b> language can increase awareness of <b>grammatical</b> <b>gender</b> arbitrariness.

50|$|In Belarusian {{language}} Chut has <b>masculine</b> <b>grammatical</b> <b>gender</b> - that's why in {{most cases}} Chut {{is described as a}} male. Chut is the polymorphous spirit: he could look like little boy or dwarf; he is also able to take the form of inanimate objects — gnarled piece of wood, old wheel, dry stump and so on. Chut appears in the houses, where perverted daughter of host killed her illegitimate child or tried to raise him or she without baptism. Belarusians believe, that the soul of this child transforms into Chut. Chut saves the childish features of character forever: he is foolish, playful, joking and emotional labile. This spirit likes to make fun of the guests: to hide somebody's hat, to spill the beans and peas (and then gather them again at night).|$|E
40|$|The paper {{focuses on}} new {{expressive}} nouns of the <b>masculine</b> <b>grammatical</b> <b>gender</b> {{used in the}} language of Czech and Bulgarian press over the last twenty years. Based on synchronic contrastive analysis, it deals with the most frequent word-formation models of Czech and Bulgarian expressive words. Attention is also paid to word-formation ways, models and means used at the formation of new expressive neologisms. The expressivity of neologisms is conceived of as a result of word-formation means combinations with different genetic and communication-style features, thus modifications of literary and non-literary word-formation formants are concerned as well as the exercitation of native and taken over (international) word-formation elements within a single word. In the paper, the expressivity of new words is discussed as an indivisible part of their word-formation meaning and, in compliance with the theory of J. Zima, it is termed as inherent expressivity...|$|E

We tested the boundaries of the influence of language on olfaction by focusing on a non-lexical aspect of language (grammatical gender). We manipulated the grammatical gender of fragrance descriptions to test whether the congruence with fragrance gender would affect the way fragrances were perceived and remembered. Native French and German speakers read descriptions of fragrances containing ingredients with feminine or <b>masculine</b> <b>grammatical</b> <b>gender,</b> and then smelled masculine or feminine fragrances and rated them on a number of dimensions (e. g., pleasantness).

40|$|Previous research, {{for example}} in English, French, German, and Spanish, has {{investigated}} the interplay between grammatical gender information and stereotype gender information (e. g. that secretaries are usually female, in many cultures), {{in the interpretation of}} both singular noun phrases (the secretary) and plural nouns phrases, particularly so-called generic masculines – noun that have <b>masculine</b> <b>grammatical</b> <b>gender</b> but that should be able to refer to both groups of men and mixed groups of men and women. Since the studies have been conducted in cultures with broadly similar stereotypes, the effects generally reflect differences in the grammatical systems of the languages. Russian has a more complex grammatical gender system than the languages previously studied, and, unlike those languages frequently presents examples in which grammatical gender is marked on the predicate (in an inflection on the verb). In this study we collected stereotype norms for 160 role names in Russian, providing a useful resource for further work in this language. We also conducted a reading time study examining the interaction of grammatical and stereotype gender information in the interpretation of both Russian singular noun phrases, and plurals that were (potentially) generic masculines. Our results show that, although both types of gender information are used, as available, the effects of grammatical marking on the predicate are not as strong as those...|$|E

40|$|<b>Grammatical</b> <b>gender</b> in French {{language}} {{is one of}} the biggest guessing games for a native English speaker. Why a table is feminine and a book is masculine is a question that plagues those learning French as a second language. In French, all nouns have gender, masculine and feminine. The complication: only a small percentage of the nouns are assigned gender semantically leaving the remaining which are assigned gender seemingly arbitrarily. For English native speakers, the distinction of these basic parts in a foreign {{language is}} not a natural skill. The simple fact that nouns are either feminine or masculine is troubling to students of the French language. This struggle of the English native speaker with French <b>grammatical</b> <b>gender</b> presents a valuable opportunity to study how <b>grammatical</b> <b>gender</b> is acquired. This project is a study of French <b>grammatical</b> <b>gender</b> acquisition of English native speakers. First, it examines the existing methods by which <b>grammatical</b> <b>gender</b> is acquired. The research then contrasts the acquisition of <b>grammatical</b> <b>gender</b> in second language learning to the acquisition for native French speakers. This paper then factors in the different variables that affect how <b>grammatical</b> <b>gender</b> is learned as a second language. These variables include age, level of French, motivation, type and amount of explicit review, and positive and negative feedback. I created a survey of students from high school French levels 2, 3, 4, and 5 asking them to identify the gender of a series of French nouns, some of which can be determined by gender by general rules, some exceptions, and nouns that are typically used within various contexts. This project summarizes the results as well as compares them to the students’ responses to the following: How did you learn to decide between masculine and feminine nouns? How do you feel about how well you can distinguish M/F? and What do you know about masculine and feminine nouns in French? This research summarizes the pedagogy surrounding <b>grammatical</b> <b>gender</b> and its effectiveness. Processing this study thus acts as a chance to improve personal acuity with <b>grammatical</b> <b>gender.</b> Furthermore, it provides a guide for how to communicate <b>grammatical</b> <b>gender</b> in French to students. Along with the research, I provide general curricula of how to communicate <b>grammatical</b> <b>gender</b> in the French foreign language classroom. This is accompanied by complete lesson plans highlighting <b>grammatical</b> <b>gender</b> as either a focus completely on masculine vs feminine nouns, a review or frontloading activity.

Its goal is, through carrying out an experiment on Czech language (that means on a language with <b>grammatical</b> <b>gender)</b> and on Hungarian language (that means on a language without <b>grammatical</b> <b>gender)</b> to verify the assumption, that the Czech native speakers would focus on the <b>grammatical</b> <b>gender</b> while responding, unlike the Hungarian native speakers, whose language does not have <b>grammatical</b> <b>gender.</b> For this purpose, two methods are used. In one of them the respondents have to assign a voice to given inanimate objects (either male or female) or as the case may be, they have to assign a first name. The data was collected through an online questionary. The results of the research verified the previous assumption, that means the influence of <b>grammatical</b> <b>gender</b> on the responses of the Czech native speakers.

However, these anomalist views of <b>grammatical</b> <b>gender</b> assignment offer no explanation for very basic questions about this aspect of language. First, how do native speaking children of languages with <b>grammatical</b> <b>genders</b> learn a system with little or no trouble that via pure memorization would take years of concerted study to master? Second, how can native speakers almost unanimously agree on gender assignment for new loan words coming into the language?The answer to these questions is that there must be some underlying system by which <b>grammatical</b> <b>gender</b> is assigned to nouns in a given language. The present paper uses two principles, gender eclipsis and gender tally, to postulate rules for the assignment of <b>grammatical</b> <b>gender</b> in Modern Swedish. The purpose of the research is to display the systematicity found in the gender system of Swedish and to argue further against the anomalist theory of gender assignment in all languages. 1. 0 An overview of grammatical sender theory and researchGrammatical gender has long been a topic of great speculation in most fields of linguistic studies.
