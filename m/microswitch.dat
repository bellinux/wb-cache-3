40|$|In {{a series}} of three experiments, we {{evaluated}} the use of <b>microswitches</b> as a means for students with profound, multiple handicaps to demonstrate preferences between toys and to make requests for specific activities. In Experiment 1, 5 students learned to demonstrate toy preferences by using <b>microswitches</b> to activate battery-operated toys. Experiment 2 was conducted to evaluate the students' preferences for social attention. <b>Microswitches</b> were used to activate prerecorded messages that signaled the classroom teacher to attend to the students. In Experiment 3, the students used the switches and prerecorded messages to make specific requests of educational staff in school and community settings. Results of these experiments, evaluated within multiple baseline, alternating treatments, and simultaneous treatments designs, indicated that these students could request specific activities. Results are discussed with respect to the continued use of <b>microswitches</b> and to program development...|$|R

50|$|All Matrixes {{dating back}} to the E Matrix have been {{designed}} around a balanced spool valve design. Rather than utilize a hammer that strikes a poppet valve, the bolt functions simultaneously as the valve, alternately opening and closing based on air flow from the solenoid.

50|$|One of {{the major}} {{strengths}} of the TOVA test {{is the use of}} a <b>microswitch</b> to record response time. The <b>microswitch</b> can obtain very accurate response times, as the time measurement error is only ±1 ms. Other tools, such as computer keyboards/mice, can have an error rate of ±28 ms. Five out of the eight determining factors used to assess whether an individual has ADHD are time based (Response time). Therefore, any delay can severely affect the scoring, or whether the patient receives an accurate diagnosis.The TOVA can also correctly predict 87% of individuals without ADHD, 84% of non-hyperactive ADHD, and 90% of the hyperactive ADHD. These results make it one of the many effective tools which should be used when making a diagnosis.The TOVA is also relatively cheap to administer. Physicians may give the test to patients, but assistants and trained individuals can administer the test as well. This cuts the cost by making it possible to take the test without having to visit a doctor.|$|E
50|$|There {{are three}} levels of IGC-approval and at the higher levels a public/private key {{encryption}} system such as RSA or equivalent is used to achieve the validation process above. Recorders at the higher approval levels also have a security device such as a <b>microswitch</b> that operates if the recorder is opened. This enables unauthorised modification to the recorder to be detected and protects the integrity of its output data.|$|E

The article outlines library management of such a program, including funding, acquisitions, classification, and cataloging strategies. A comprehensive library classification scheme for assistive devices is proposed, and schedules are given for <b>microswitches</b> and environmental controls.

40|$|International audienceThis article {{presents}} {{a study of}} <b>microswitches</b> with piezoelectric actuation. With the help of analysis modelling and FEM commercial software (ANSYS), we investigated the potentiality of AlN as piezoelectric actuator. Firstly, we compared AlN with PZT to actuate simple structures by bimorph effect as cantilever or clamped-clamped membrane. After this investigation, we focused on means to improve the deflection and the contact force of structures, by mechanical considerations, {{in case of an}} AlN actuation. This resulted in several designs of <b>microswitches,</b> with two different actuation mechanisms: bending or buckling. To go further, we evaluated some technological aspects as the influence of residual stresses and the shape of membrane on an AlN piezo-actuated structure...|$|R
5000|$|One type of {{float switch}} uses a mercury switch inside a hinged float. Another common type is a float that raises a rod to actuates a <b>microswitch.</b> One pattern uses a reed switch mounted in a tube; a float, {{containing}} a magnet, surrounds {{the tube and}} is guided by it. When the float raises the magnet to the reed switch, it closes. Several reeds can be mounted in the tube for different level indications by one assembly.|$|E
50|$|In {{one type}} of <b>microswitch,</b> {{internally}} there are two conductive springs. A long flat spring is hinged {{at one end of}} the switch (the left, in the photograph) and has electrical contacts on the other. A small curved spring, preloaded (i.e., compressed during assembly) so it attempts to extend itself (at the top, just right of center in the photo), is connected between the flat spring near the contacts and a fulcrum near the midpoint of the flat spring. An actuator nub presses on the flat spring near its hinge point.|$|E
50|$|In 1978, Spectronics was {{acquired}} by Honeywell. From 1978 to 1987, Dr. Biard worked as Chief Scientist of the Honeywell Optoelectronics Division in Richardson, TX.

50|$|Because {{hinge points}} are {{eliminated}} and the motion {{is due to}} stressing of a thin metal strip, <b>microswitches</b> are extremely reliable, operating for millions of cycles without failure. A larger switch constructed of separate springs and levers wears out more quickly, due to the hinge points rubbing together under the high pressure of the tipping point spring.|$|R
50|$|The Arcade is a {{joystick}} that {{was produced by}} Suzo International, usually marked as S.T.C. Rotterdam (Suzo Trading Company), for the European market. It distinguished itself from the competition because of its robust construction as the stick had a reinforced inside made of steel and used <b>microswitches</b> for the controls (but not the fire buttons, which used leaf springs).|$|R
50|$|An AdvancedTCA board (blade) is 280 mm {{deep and}} 322 mm high. The boards have a metal front panel and a metal cover {{on the bottom}} of the printed circuit board to limit {{electromagnetic}} interference and to limit the spread of fire. The locking injector-ejector handle (lever) actuates a <b>microswitch</b> to let the Intelligent Platform Management Controller (IPMC) know that an operator wants to remove a board, or that the board has just been installed, thus activating the hot-swap procedure. AdvancedTCA boards support the use of PCI Mezzanine Card (PMC) or Advanced Mezzanine Card (AMC) expansion mezzanines.|$|E
50|$|Switches can be {{designed}} to respond to any type of mechanical stimulus: for example, vibration (the trembler switch), tilt, air pressure, fluid level (a float switch), the turning of a key (key switch), linear or rotary movement (a limit switch or <b>microswitch),</b> or presence of a magnetic field (the reed switch). Many switches are operated automatically by changes in some environmental condition or by motion of machinery. A limit switch is used, for example, in machine tools to interlock operation with the proper position of tools. In heating or cooling systems a sail switch ensures that air flow is adequate in a duct. Pressure switches respond to fluid pressure.|$|E
5000|$|Sometimes mono {{sound or}} {{monaural}} can simply {{refer to a}} merged pair of stereo channels - also known as [...] "collapsed stereo" [...] or [...] "folded-down stereo". Over time some devices have used mono sound amplification circuitry with two or more speakers since it can cut {{the cost of the}} hardware. Some consumer electronics with stereo RCA outputs have a <b>microswitch</b> in the red RCA output (i.e., the right stereo channel) that disables merging of stereo sound into the white (left stereo channel) RCA output. Common devices with this are VCRs, DVD/Blu-ray players, information appliances, set-top boxes, and the like. Video game consoles sometimes have male RCA ends of cables with a proprietary multi-A/V plug on the other end, which prevents automatic stereo merging unless adapters are used.|$|E
40|$|There are two {{adjacent}} x-ray labs {{in building}} 360, each having two entrance doors. Lab A 240 has two x-ray machines and lab A 248 has one. All machines {{are equipped with}} sliding safety windows and <b>microswitches</b> to monitor {{the state of the}} windows - open or closed. Two modes of operation are possible. (1) Secure Mode in which all safety windows are closed as indicated by the <b>microswitches.</b> This satisfies the interlock system, allowing the high voltage power supply to be turned on. (2) Bypass Mode in which the interlock system is overridden by a key-controlled selector switch and high voltage can be turned on with machine hutch window(s) open. The bypass mode is potentially unsafe because it is possible for an operator to leave a running instrument unattended while the windows are open. Thus, it is possible for someone entering the lab to expose themselves to x-rays...|$|R
