5|$|The {{heritage}} of the region includes numerous landmarks, especially manor houses built by the nobility in largely in the 18th and the 19th centuries. Those include Prandau-Normann and Prandau-Mailath manor houses in Valpovo and Donji Miholjac respectively, manor houses in Baranja—in Bilje, at a former Esterházy estate in Darda, in Tikveš, and in Kneževo. Pejačevićs built several residences, the most representative ones among them being <b>manor</b> <b>house</b> in Virovitica and the Pejačević <b>manor</b> <b>house</b> in Našice. Further east, along the Danube, there are Odescalchi <b>manor</b> <b>house</b> in Ilok, and Eltz <b>manor</b> <b>house</b> in Vukovar—the latter sustained extensive damage during the Battle of Vukovar in 1991, but it was reconstructed by 2011. In the southeast of the region, the most prominent are Kutjevo Jesuit <b>manor</b> <b>house,</b> and Cernik <b>manor</b> <b>house,</b> located in Kutjevo and Cernik respectively. The period also saw construction of Tvrđa and Brod fortifications in Osijek and Slavonski Brod. Older, medieval fortifications are preserved only as ruins—the largest among those being Ružica Castle near Orahovica. Another landmark dating to the 19th century is the Đakovo Cathedral—hailed by the Pope John XXIII as the most beautiful church situated between Venice and Istanbul.|$|E

5|$|After the Norman Conquest of 1066, {{the manor}} of Clevedon was {{granted by the}} King to Matthew de Mortagne, who in turn granted it to his sub-tenant, Hildebert.

Perhaps because of {{the distance to the}} parish church, the <b>manor</b> <b>house</b> included a chapel dedicated, in the 1320s, to Saint Peter. The house has undergone considerable change since it was built, almost every century seeing structural alterations, but it still retains many features of a mediaeval <b>manor</b> <b>house.</b>|$|E

5|$|Cullompton <b>Manor</b> <b>House</b> is a grade II* listed {{building}} with sections built in 1603 (dated panel and initials TT for Thomas Trock {{on the top}} corner of {{the front of the}} house) and 1718 (on a lead cistern head of a drainpipe, are the letters (L) S/WT (R) and the date 1718). It was originally a private residence and now forms part of the <b>Manor</b> <b>House</b> Hotel. It has a jettied half timbered front with four gables and stone end walls with upper windows on carved brackets. It was probably built in the sixteenth century but was refurbished in 1603 for Thomas Trock, a clothier. The original structure consisted only of the front part, in which there were three rooms and a passage on the ground floor, three rooms opening into each other on the floor above, and above again. The front room on the left was the former hall with large oak panels of the Queen Anne period, and a moulded and beamed ceiling. Part of an earlier newel stair which descended to the hall or kitchen survives above a back staircase. The house was remodelled in 1718 for William Sellock. At the front of the building is a hooded shell porch of the early 18th century supported on pilasters and the back of house is also early 18th century of red and blue brick, with windows with thick glazing bars beneath a hipped slate roof with coved eaves. It was given the name of The <b>Manor</b> <b>House</b> in 1850 by J. S. Upcott who owned the property at that time. During World War II it was requisitioned by the army and used to billet officers. The adjacent house, Veryards, was originally a separate residence but was bought by the owners of the <b>Manor</b> <b>House</b> Hotel and incorporated into the hotel in the 1980s.|$|E
50|$|Prior to 1485, many {{wealthy and}} noble landowners lived in homes {{that were not}} {{necessarily}} comfortable but built to withstand sieges, though <b>manor</b> <b>houses</b> that were only lightly fortified, if at all, had been increasingly built.

5|$|Originally, a rectory {{was located}} on the site, which {{provided}} {{a home for the}} rector who officiated in the private chapel of St. Nicholas in the Beauchamp <b>manor</b> <b>house</b> nearby. When the rector, Henry de Wyk, resigned in 1304, the lord of the manor, John de Beauchamp, 1st Baron Beauchamp, established a chantry and founded a college for five chaplains. It is suggested in the English Heritage listing that the rectory was probably already owned by the Beauchamps, but if not they purchased it upon de Wyk's departure. The college was composed of four priests governed by a provost, and was attached to the <b>manor</b> <b>house</b> chapel. A National Trust report referenced in the Historic Environment Record could not determine if the pre-1304 rectory was retained for the college's use, or if a new building was erected instead.|$|E
