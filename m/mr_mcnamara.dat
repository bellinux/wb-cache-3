50|$|Ovilla, on upper Red Oak Creek in {{northern}} Ellis County, {{is the oldest}} town in the county. It began in 1844 as a fortified settlement known as McNamara's to repel Indian incursions. James McNamara arrived in 1843 with his new wife, Joanna (Hale) McNamara as the first Peters Colony settlers of this area for which they received 640 acres {{that made up the}} beginning of the locale that was later to be called 'Shiloh' for a nearby creek and a newly formed church. The McNamaras arrived with other Peters colonists: the Billingsleys; <b>Mrs.</b> <b>McNamara's</b> family, the McCommas's; and James Sterrett(Mrs. McNamara's brother-in-law who established the locale of Sterrett, Texas). The marriage of James Sterrett to Clarinda (Hale) Squires of 7 Jul 1844 was the first marriage to be performed here within the future boundaries of Ellis County which was still within old Robertson County at the time. James McNamara served as sergeant in Smith's Company of Texas Mounted Volunteers during the War with Mexico in 1846-1847 along with his brother-in-law, James Sterrett. The little ville grew as other Peters Colony settlers arrived in the area to attend brush arbor meetings of the Shiloh Cumberland Presbyterian Church, which was started by Rev. Finis E. King in 1847. James McNamara died in New Orleans 5 May 1852, and his widow liquified his assets and left Texas for the gold fields in Tuolumne County, California with all of her remaining maternal family members.|$|R

40|$|Notes {{prepared}} by Sterling Wortman of the Rockefeller Foundation on {{a conference of}} heads of assistance agencies held April 8 - 9, 1970 at the Villa Serbelloni in Bellagio, Italy. The agenda was the recommendations from a conference of agricultural experts (Bellagio II) in February 1970. In the discussion on funding, USAID agreed to cover the $ 225, 000 deficit of the four existing centers for 1970. It was agreed that the World Bank should move forward {{with the formation of}} a consortium, if the Bank's Governors approved, and that an informal meeting should be held in early December to consider funding, and the formation of additional centers. Four centers were discussed: water management, parasitic diseases of animals, dryland farming, and agricultural management and policy. The meeting also considered food legumes, which would be allocated among various institutions. New papers would be prepared on all five subjects by December. The agenda for December would also include the organization and operation of the consortium. <b>Mr.</b> <b>McNamara,</b> President of the World Bank, estimated that annual costs would rise to the order of $ 44 million per year by 1975, including capital costs of $ 10 million for one new center per year. Various participants stressed the importance of the foundations taking the lead on planning, organizing, and arranging for continued good management of the institutes. The foundations would discuss how to handle these responsibilities in late April. The paper lists individual comments by various participants during the meeting. Agencies represented were three foundations: Ford, Rockefeller and IDRC; six multilateral organizations: the Economic Commission for Africa, FAO, the Inter-American Development Bank, OECD, UNDP, and the World Bank; and four bilateral agencies: CIDA, SIDA, the UK Ministry of Overseas Development, and USAID...|$|E
