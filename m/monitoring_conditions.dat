40|$|Head-mounted {{displays}} (HMDs) {{and similar}} display technologies {{are becoming increasingly}} prominent in safety-critical domains such as aviation and medicine. A concern for use, however, is that the HMDs may cause a perceptual phenomenon called Inattentional Blindness (IAB), wherein unexpected visual events can go completely unnoticed by the observer. The current thesis investigated IAB in HMD use with 2 consecutive studies. The first aimed to replicate the findings from Liu et al. (2009) where anesthetists took a significantly longer time to notice an unexpected change in patient vital signs (a change in a sine-wave) on HMDs than when using normal monitors. This was done by using an experimental procedure adapted from Tear et al. (2013) where participants performed an engaging perceptual-motor task (a pellet transfer task) while detecting unexpected changes in visual stimulus (waveform versus numerical) on either a HMD or laptop monitor positioned {{to the right of}} the participant. Participant expectation was manipulated by giving increasingly comprehensive instructions throughout the three experimental blocks. It was predicted that (1) the detection of waveform events would be significantly slower in the HMD condition compared to the <b>monitor</b> <b>condition</b> and (2) the detection of number events would be significantly faster in the HMD condition compared to the <b>monitor</b> <b>condition.</b> The results from Experiment 1 supported the first hypothesis but not the second where the HMD condition detected numbers significantly faster than the <b>monitor</b> <b>condition,</b> but did not detect waveforms significantly slower. This was followed up a second study, which retained the same experimental design, but with two major changes. The first was increasing the visual stimulus event duration from 24 seconds to 40 seconds. The second was to move the placement of the laptop monitor from the participant’s right to directly beside the pellet task monitor. Two competing exploratory hypotheses were proposed (1) there would be no difference in stimulus detection for participants in the <b>monitor</b> <b>condition</b> and (2) the <b>monitor</b> <b>condition</b> would become statistically indistinguishable from the HMD condition due to its position in peripheral view. Results partially supported the second hypothesis, with <b>monitor</b> <b>condition</b> participants in one experimental block detecting waveform events significantly slower than number events. This study has important implications in terms of HMD use, design, and the stimuli they display...|$|R

50|$|Incubators were expensive, so {{the whole}} room was often kept warm instead. Cross-infection between babies was greatly feared. Strict nursing {{routines}} involved staff wearing gowns and masks, constant hand-washing and minimal handling of babies. Parents were sometimes allowed to watch {{through the windows of}} the unit. Much was learned about feeding—frequent, tiny feeds seemed best—and breathing. Oxygen was given freely {{until the end of the}} 1950s, when it was shown that the high concentrations reached inside incubators caused some babies to go blind. <b>Monitoring</b> <b>conditions</b> in the incubator, and the baby itself, was to become a major area of research. Most early units had little equipment, providing only oxygen and warmth, and relied on careful nursing and observation. In later years, further research allowed technology to play a larger role in the decline of infant mortality. The development of pulmonary surfactant, which facilitates the oxygenation and ventilation of underdeveloped lungs, has been the most important development in neonatology to date.|$|E
50|$|Approximately 211 {{million of}} the world’s children, {{between the ages of}} 5 and 14, work at least part-time, {{according}} to the International Labour Organization (ILO), the tripartite body representing governments, labor, and employees. Of these, 120 million children are working full-time to help support their impoverished families. Although child labor is most common in developing countries, it is found throughout the world, including in the United States. Many of these children are forced into the workforce to become beggars, farm hands, and factory workers. They are exposed to conditions extremely harmful to their physical and mental well-being. ILRF has helped develop programs to fight child labor and is involved in <b>monitoring</b> <b>conditions</b> in various regions of the world. ILRF is also currently engaged in two corporate campaigns related to child labor: one targeting the Firestone Tire and Rubber Company for their use of child labor on a rubber plantation in Liberia and the other focusing on the chocolate industry for child labor on cocoa farms in West Africa.|$|E
50|$|A {{non-profit}} {{research and}} testing organization, the Instrumentation Testing Association (ITA) can provide results of field testing online TOC analyzers {{in an industrial}} wastewater application. Gulf Coast Waste Disposal Authority (GCWDA), Bayport Industrial Wastewater Treatment Plant in Pasadena, Texas sponsored and conducted this test in 2011. The GCWDA Bayport facility treats approximately 30 mgd of industrial waste received from approximately 65 customers (primarily petrochemical). Field tests consisted of operating online TOC analyzers at the influent of the Bayport facility in which TOC concentrations can range from 490 to 1020 mg/L {{with an average of}} 870 mg/L. GCWDA conducts approximately 102 TOC analyses in their laboratory per day at their Bayport treatment facility and use TOC measurements for process control and billing purposes. GCWDA plans to use online TOC analyzers for process control, detecting influent slug loads from industries and to potentially use online TOC analyzers to detect and monitor volatiles of the incoming stream. Field tests were conducted for a period of 90-days and used laboratory conformance measurements once per day to compare with analyzer output to demonstrate the instrument's overall accuracy when subjected to many simultaneously changing parameters as experienced in real-time <b>monitoring</b> <b>conditions.</b> Field test results can provide information regarding instrument design, operation and maintenance requirements which influence the performance of the instruments in field applications. The field test report includes evaluations of online TOC analyzers utilizing the following technologies: High Temperature Combustion (HTC), High Temperature Catalytic/Combustion Oxidation (HTCO), Supercritical Water Oxidation (SCWO), and Two-Stage Advanced Oxidation (TSAO).|$|E

System monitoring provides an effective and reliable means for problem detection.

40|$|New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (NJDEP) is in {{the process}} of {{certifying}} removal efficiencies of total suspended solids (TSS) for various manufactured treatment devices (MTDs). Prior to the certification, the removal efficiencies are verified by New Jersey Corporation for Advanced Technology (NJCAT) under some specific laboratory testing and field <b>monitoring</b> <b>conditions.</b> However, the TSS removal performance is expected to vary with operating flow rates, unit sizes, and laboratory or field evaluation techniques. Several technical issues related to the uniform certification have been researched. Among them are difference between TSS and suspended sediment concentration (SSC), extrapolation of operating flow rates, unit size scaling, impacts of particle size and influent concentration, and possibility of bottom sediment re-suspension. NJDEP has made amendments to the TARP field monitoring protocol to further constrain the field <b>monitoring</b> <b>conditions</b> and to additionally require the particle size measurements and the sediment re-suspension tests.

The task of the participants was to make an eye movement towards the colour patch in the same colour as the central arrow, ignoring the patch to which the arrow was pointing. High-proficient bilinguals had overall faster saccade latency on all types of trials as compared to the low proficient bilinguals. The overall saccadic latency for high proficiency bilinguals was similarly affected by the different types of <b>monitoring</b> <b>conditions,</b> whereas conflict resolution advantage was found only for high monitoring demanding condition. The results support a conflict-monitoring account in a novel oculomotor task and also suggest that language proficiency could modulate executive control in bilinguals...|$|E
