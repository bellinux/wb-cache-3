He has suggested that the decreased conception rate is actually due to problems associated with an outer protein covering on the stallion’s sperm cells commonly referred to as the acrosome.

40|$|We {{describe}} herein {{the synthesis}} and characterisation {{of a series}} of asymmetric three arm polystyrene stars via the “macromonomer” approach. The stars have been designed as model polymers to probe branched polymer dynamics and in particular to establish the chain-length of side-arm which precipitates a change in the rheological properties of the resulting polymers from “linear-like” to “star-like”. Thus, a homologous series of three arm stars have been prepared in which the molar mass of two (long) arms are fixed at 90, 000 g mol− 1 and the molar mass of the remaining (short) arm is varied from below the entanglement molecular weight (Me) to above Me. The arms were prepared by living anionic polymerisation, resulting in well-defined chain lengths with narrow molecular weight distribution. In contrast to the usual chlorosilane coupling approach, the macromonomer approach involves the introduction of reactive chain-end functionalities on each of the arms, either {{through the use of a}} functionalised (protected) initiator or a functional end-capping agent, which allows the stars to be constructed by a simple condensation coupling reaction. In this study we will compare the relative efficiency of a Williamson and ‘click’ coupling reaction in producing the stars. Most significantly, although this approach <b>maybe</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>more</b> time-consuming than the more common silane coupling reaction, in the present study the “long” arm may be produced in sufficient quantity such that all of the asymmetric stars are produced with long arms of identical molecular weight – the only remaining variable being the molecular weight of the short arm. This will allow for a far more robust interpretation of the resulting characterisation of the dynamic properties. Temperature gradient interaction chromatography was used alongside size exclusion chromatography to characterise the structural dispersity of the resulting stars and establish the degree of structural homogeneity...|$|E

40|$|Using modern {{information}} and communication technologies Suggested introduction: When did you last use a computer? What were you using it for? Maybe you have never used one and don?t feel you need to. For most people who have started using computers in the last ten years, probably the most popular service that computers offer is email. For sending messages to family, friends and colleagues, email can be the quickest and most reliable method. Computers can also be a valuable source of information, allowing users to search for up-to-date news, weather reports, health or even market information, through the internet. Interestingly however, research suggests that far fewer people use computers as a source of information, certainly compared to the number who use email. The reason? Perhaps the expense of paying for time online, or not knowing how to search for the right information. And many of us are simply unaware of what useful information might be available, and continue to rely on other sources, such as TV, radio, newspapers and friends. Faye Durrant, Professor of Library and Information studies at the University of the West Indies in Jamaica believes strongly that computer-based technologies have a lot to offer, not just to highly skilled professionals, but also to rural people making a living from agriculture and other local industries. At a recent conference in Belize, she, and other participants, discussed the power of these technologies for rural development; afterwards, they spoke to Susanna Thorp about their own experiences. IN:		?Well certainly in terms of the uptake? OUT:	?the information that they require. DUR?N		 5 ? 59 ? Back announcement: Thomas Burton ending that report on the current usage of ICTs - Information and Communication Technologies - for rural development in the Caribbean. Transcript Durrant	Well certainly in terms of the uptake of the Internet that is increasing daily. So I think {{that is one of the}} ways in which we can get a large region like this, one point on the Internet can be accessible to everybody in the whole region. Thorp	But for vulnerable groups this presumably is not something that they necessarily can access particularly on an individual level? Durrant	What has been happening and certainly in Jamaica is the development of tele centres via the public library system where there are public access computers which people can go in and use for this kind of information without having to have their own dedicated computer. Thorp	And what about the introduction of these things, these technologies in schools that the children are learning at the new generation? Durrant	Yes certainly that is where the children are catching on very fast to the whole facility of email and searching for information on the web. What we want to ensure is that when they search they can find a spot where they have reliable information that will give them the basis for long term decision making on their diet and the way in which they develop their own personal nutrition strategies. Thorp	Because there isn?t a lack of information, it is actually people knowing where to go to find it? Durrant	Exactly and even having it in the form because now children want multimedia, they don?t want any ten pages of text telling them something. They want something that jumps out at them and says, ?Look at me!? So it is also the way in which information might be packaged for them at that age and stage. NARR	It is not only in Jamaica that the use of computers is growing. Andrea Robbin, Head of the Nutrition Unit within the Ministry of Health and the Environment told me about the situation in St Vincent and the Grenadines. Robbin	I think that the youth are embracing, for example, computer based technologies and older persons <b>maybe</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>more</b> tentative and sometimes the policymakers are the older persons. But in St Vincent and the Grenadines we have a government Internet, a website and government Intranet as well as government email. So those are opportunities for sharing information that we really want to use and our nutrition unit in the Ministry of Health and Environment is already submitting information to the St Vincent and the Grenadines government website in terms of the newspaper articles and some of the radio scripts that we produce. But I think that there is a need for access for the consumers in terms of Internet access to that website and to maybe other websites related to food and nutrition security. Hardware in terms of actual computers. I think the government has programmes to introduce computers to maybe community resource centres and learning centres, but I do not know in terms of how far it reaches. Thorp	So that people could go to that community resource centre and download information that they needed on recipes or good nutrition or breastfeeding for instance? Robbin	Absolutely or backyard gardening best practices, or other aspects of food and nutrition security whether it is from an agricultural perspective, health perspective, nutrition perspective. NARR	And while the use of computers to access information is starting to grow, they also have other uses. Thomas Burton, from Jamaica?s Rural Agricultural Development Authority, RADA, explains how his organisation is using them to record and analyse information, as well as provide it. Burton	Well at the moment RADA is trying to implement an ICT based information system, which will benefit both the extension officers and the farmers. We are at the moment carrying out a national registration programme for all farmers, so that we can know the numbers with whom we are interacting and can make plans to satisfy their various demands. This information that is garnered will also give the size of the holdings that they are operating, their locations, what they are planting at the various times and what is expected, times of harvesting and output possible. It will also give a possibility on projected price so the farmers will know how much they can expect to earn from a given unit area of production. The extension officer will input this data on his computer system and then farmers can also come to the office and get information from him on what has been required in the different market centres at different times. Thorp	And how do farmers feel, do you think farmers are willing to embrace new technologies in order to get the information that they require? Burton	They are willing to embrace the technology but the older farmers are at a disadvantage in that they have not been trained in how to use these devices. So what we are hoping is that the children who are currently in school and are being afforded the opportunity to learn how to use the computers for example can now pass on information to their parents. The problem also is that many of these resource deficient farmers are not able to buy computer equipment so they will have to probably depend on what is at the library or what is in the community centre and this can slow down the process. So we are hoping that as the price of the equipment gets lower, then more persons will be able to access this. However if they cannot access it in their own homes we have 60 extension offices across the island which are being equipped with computers so the farmers can go to these centres and get the information that they require. End of track. Use of the internet to communicate nutrition information, and overcoming problems of access...|$|E
5000|$|Following {{sessions}} at London's Sphere Studios, they submitted a rough {{mix of the}} album to their record label Sony Music in May 2006, but it was rejected for not having an obvious lead single. According to John, [...] "I guess we'd worked on it for about six months, we got a title Reportage and we kind of had a cover and we presented it to the label. They said they heard the second single and the third single but not the first single, so they suggested could we perhaps go and cut a couple of songs with <b>a</b> producer -- <b>maybe</b> something <b>a</b> <b>little</b> bit <b>more</b> commercial." [...] According to Andy, the band met with producer Youth in June and discussed working with him at his studio in Spain that fall to [...] "work out which bits {{were the most important}} and how to make all the various components work together as a whole." [...] They also made plans to record a few potential singles with Timbaland in October. The band and Timbaland had previously met and expressed their desire to work together.|$|R
5000|$|Interest in {{the band}} {{increased}} sharply in 1984 after James was interviewed by the NME, with several record companies sending representatives to their next performance at the Electric Cinema in London, and they were invited to perform on The Tube. The band were signed by EMI, with the band themselves claiming in the press that they had signed for £1m, though in actual fact revealed to be £350,000. The band's first single, the Giorgio Moroder-produced [...] "Love Missile F1-11", was released in February 1986, and reached number 3 in the UK Singles Chart, number 2 in South Africa and was a major hit in several countries in Europe and Asia. Its popularity was boosted by its inclusion in the John Hughes film Ferris Bueller's Day Off. The samples used in the single had not received copyright clearance, and were replaced in the US version. The follow-up, [...] "21st Century Boy" [...] reached number 20 in the UK and, despite largely negative reviews, the album that followed, Flaunt It, again with Moroder at the controls, went top ten in the UK, and also reached number 96 in the US. The album included paid commercials between tracks, James stated prior to its release that they would sell 20-30 second advertising slots for between $2,500 and $7,000. He explained this by saying [...] "commercialism is rampant in society. <b>Maybe</b> we're <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>more</b> honest than some groups I could mention," [...] and [...] "our records sounded like adverts anyway". [...] Advertisements that did sell (including spots for i-D Magazine and Studio Line from L'Oréal) were complemented by ironic spoof ads including one for the Sputnik corporation itself claiming that [...] "Pleasure is our Business". A subsequent tour was characterised by poor ticket sales and crowd violence.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to study what experiences, value {{creation}} and experience shopping is according to three shop managers and the shoppingcenter manager of Smedjan, which is situated in the centre of Luleå, {{in the north of}} Sweden. The research is qualitative with a hermeneutic rule of conduct and an abductive approach. I’ve had four qualitative interviews to be able to answer my research questions and purpose for this thesis. To understand and interpret the empirical research, I’ve also used a number of literature sources. This research shows that professional customer service but also that something extra, the aspect that customers feel is value creating is also important for the shopmanagers. It can be the exposure of clothes in a new thinking way, a shop assistant who has served a customer with great empathy and understanding, or a surprise moment in the shop that raises enthusiasm from the customer’s perspective. They describe a distinguished experience as something greater, bigger and that customers' get the help they need in the store, experience is something that affects the sensory impressions that the customer is not expected to experience in Smedjan, which is beyond just shopping. Shop experiences mean, according to the informants, the customer getting inspired when for example coming into the store and noticing something unexpected and becoming surprised. In order to create shop experiences, {{you have to be able}} to surprise the customers in different ways and make efforts to stand out from the crowd. But also to make sure that customers get the help they need, want and <b>maybe</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> bit <b>more.</b> The pleasure aspect is in focus in the experience industry which my informants’ also have more or less noticed. Secondly shopping today, is more like an experience than just walking around and having a look in different shops. The conclusion of this thesis is that my informants had more or less realized the relevance of experience shopping and also noticed why the experience perspective is in sharp focus today.
