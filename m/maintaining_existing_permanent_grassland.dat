40|$|A crucial {{element of}} the post- 2013 Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) reform is the ‘greening’ payment. ‘Greening’ is a {{compulsory}} {{part of the new}} direct payment scheme, accounting for 30 per cent of national ceilings. To qualify, farmers must undertake compulsory agricultural practices that are ‘beneficial for the climate and the environment’, comprising crop diversification, maintenance of <b>existing</b> <b>permanent</b> <b>grassland</b> and establishing an ecological focus area or putting in place ‘equivalent measures’. The payment had a controversial legislative passage, with several environmental groups questioning its pro-environmental effects and alleging that it was merely a clever way of disguising product support to European Union (EU) farmers, even before several of the provisions were watered down by the European Parliament. Despite these difficulties, throughout the process all parties assumed the ‘greening’ payment was compatible with the Green Box exemption in the Agreement on Agriculture (AoA) of the World Trade Organization (WTO), so that it would be exempt from the EU’s domestic support reduction commitments in that Agreement. Specifically, it was understood that the payment would be decoupled income support under paragraph 6 of Annex 2 to the AoA and as such the payment had ‘no, or at most minimal trade-distorting effects or effects on production’ under paragraph 1 of the same Annex (the so-called ‘fundamental requirement’) ...|$|R

The vegetation of the <b>permanent</b> <b>grasslands</b> was analysed in 2011, with measurements made in the last decade of April, in the middle of the second decade of June, and in the second decade of September. <b>Permanent</b> <b>grasslands</b> are located in the southern part of the Timis County, following the line of the localities Dudestii Noi – Cenad. Data processing was done based on botanical sampling. Vegetation determination was done with the linear method (quadrant) calculating pastoral value (PV). Alpha-biodiversity was estimated with the Shannon (H') and Simpson (D) indices, while beta-diversity was estimated with the Jaccard index (Pj) and with the Hamming (H) distance.

40|$|Insight {{is needed}} into how {{management}} influences soil biota when sustainable grassland systems are developed. A crop rotation {{of grass and}} maize can be sustainable in terms of efficient nutrient use. However, there is lack {{of information on the}} effect of such a crop rotation on soil biological quality. Earthworms, nematodes, bacteria and fungi were sampled over three years in a 36 years old experiment. Permanent arable land was compared with <b>permanent</b> <b>grassland</b> and with a ley-arable crop rotation. In the rotation, a period of three years of grassland (temporary grassland) was followed by a period of three years of arable land (temporary arable land) and vice versa. In the first year of arable cropping in the rotation, the number of earthworms was already low and not different from continuous cropping. In the three-year grass ley, the abundance of earthworms returned to the level of <b>permanent</b> <b>grassland</b> in the second year. However, the restoration of earthworm biomass took a minimum of three years. Furthermore, the anecic species did not recover the dominance they had in the <b>permanent</b> <b>grassland.</b> The numbers of herbivorous and microbivorous nematodes in the ley-crop rotation reached similar levels to those in the permanent treatments within one to two years. Although the same holds for the nematode genera composition, the Maturity Index and the proportion of omnivorous nematodes in the temporary treatments remained significantly lower than in their permanent counterparts. Differences in recovery were also found among microbial parameters. In the temporary treatments, bacterial growth rate and the capacity to degrade a suite of substrates recovered in the second year. However, the Community-Level Physiological Profiles in the <b>permanent</b> <b>grassland</b> remained different from the other treatments. Our results suggest that many functions of soil biota that are well established in <b>permanent</b> <b>grassland,</b> are restored in a ley-arable crop rotation. However, due to a reduction in certain species, specific functions of these soil biota could be reduced or lost. The ley-arable crop rotations were intermediate to <b>permanent</b> <b>grassland</b> and continuous arable land in terms of functioning of soil biota (e. g., N-mineralization). In terms of the functional aspects of the soil biota, <b>permanent</b> <b>grassland</b> might be preferable wherever possible. For maize cultivation, a ley-arable crop rotation is preferable to continuous arable land. However, a ley-arable crop rotation is only preferable to continuous arable cropping if it is not practised at the expense of <b>permanent</b> <b>grassland</b> at farm level...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe {{key role}} of <b>permanent</b> <b>grasslands</b> for the {{conservation}} of biodiversity, and more generally for the preservation of environment quality, is clearly established. However, the total area covered by grassland is reg- ularly declining in most EU countries.

In this perspective, we studied the links between forage services and biodiversity through the survey of a network of 47 <b>permanent</b> <b>grasslands</b> from Pyrenees, Massif Central, Jura and Vosges. Grasslands were followed during 2 years (2009 - 10) considering the seasonal dynam- ic of forage characteristics and botanical and functional composition.

Four study sites, representative of different stages of agriculture intensification, were selected in eastern France according to landscape composition. The population dynamics of Microtus arvalis, Arvicola terrestris, Clethrionomys glareolus and Apodemus sp. were monitored from 1992 to 1996 by using index methods and trapping. M. arvalis and A. terrestris population biomasses were stable in landscapes with low percentage of <b>permanent</b> <b>grassland.</b> M. arvalis populations displayed greater biomass variations with sharp declines, in the sites where the proportion of <b>permanent</b> <b>grassland</b> to farmland was greater than 50 %. A. terrestris populations were very unstable in one study site where the proportion of <b>permanent</b> <b>grassland</b> to farmland was greater than 85 %. Synchronic patterns between M. arvalis populations and the populations of hedgerow rodents were suspected at sites with large fluctuations of M. arvalis: every decline of the populations of hedgerow rodents was concomitant with the M. arvalis decline. Those results suggest that two kinds of ecological systems in terms of prey-resource variations for mammalian predators can be distinguished: (i) stable in landscapes with lower proportion of <b>permanent</b> <b>grassland,</b> and (ii) unstable, with grassland species crashes and synchronous declines of the rodent community, in landscapes with higher proportion of <b>permanent</b> <b>grassland.</b> Moreover, the population dynamics of small mammals were asynchronous between the four sites situated at relatively short distance (some tens kilometres) ...|$|R
40|$|International audienceTo {{upgrade the}} use of <b>permanent</b> <b>grasslands</b> in {{livestock}} farming systems for their economic and environmental utility, their value needs better assessment {{in terms of both}} quantity (biomass production) and quality (nutritive value: organic matter digestibility (OMD) and crude protein content (CP)). The wide variability in <b>permanent</b> <b>grassland</b> botanical composition makes it important to understand the links between vegetation characteristics and <b>permanent</b> <b>grassland</b> value, and how far environmental factors influence this value. The current work investigated how vegetation characteristics and weather explained the variability of the biomass production and nutritive value of <b>permanent</b> <b>grasslands.</b> Two models were used to determine the best vegetation characteristics for the prediction: (i) plant functional types (PFT), proportions of grasses, legumes and forbs and weather, and (ii) two proxies for PFT (dry matter content (DMC) and phenological development at medium plant stage (MPS)), proportion of grasses, legumes and forbs, and weather. The study was conducted on a set of 190 <b>permanent</b> <b>grasslands</b> distributed over a wide range of soil, climatic and management conditions, and lasted 2 years (2009 / 10). For each of the <b>permanent</b> <b>grasslands,</b> climatic data, values of vegetation characteristics, biomass production and nutritive value were collected {{at the beginning and end}} of spring, and during summer and autumn regrowths. Contribution of weather was important and particularly for regrowths. Composition in terms of botanical families, plant stage and sward DMC was the common variables that explained both biomass production and nutritive value during the growing season. Biomass production was mainly explained by the proportion of legumes and forbs, MPS and DMC considering both models. Grass nutritive value was linked to the same factors, including PFT. However, the contribution of grass PFTs was lower in models. Both models could be used to predict biomass production and nutritive value: R- 2 of the two models are quite similar. Over a wide range of environmental and management conditions, vegetation characteristics and climatic data explained almost half of the variance of forage quality and 20 - 40 % of the variance of biomass production...|$|R

This study explored long term effects of efficient nutrient management on SOM dynamics on an experimental dairy farm with three types of land use: <b>permanent</b> <b>grassland,</b> a 3 year grass- 3 year arable crop rotation (ROTI), and a 3 year grass- 5 year arable crop rotation (ROTII). The arable phase in the crop rotations consisted predominantly of maize. The experimental farm, called 'De Marke', is located on a Spodosol with an Anthropic Epipedon in the Netherlands. The study consisted of: i) trend analyses based on data of measured SOM mass percentage (SOM %) from 1989 - 2010, and ii) simulations of long term (50 years) SOM dynamics for four management alternatives. Three alternatives were related to manure digestion: no digestion; 'mild anaerobic digestion' (degrading 35 % of organic matter) and; 'strong digestion' (degrading 70 % of organic matter). The fourth management alternative was similar to the first (no digestion) but differed in that no catch crop was grown after maize. The trend analyses showed that SOM % of the 0 - 0. 2 m layer was approximately stable under <b>permanent</b> <b>grassland.</b> In ROTI, SOM % decreased on average by 0. 04 y- 1 and in ROTII by 0. 03 y- 1. The decline did not slow down over time. SOM decline was more severe on plots with relatively high initial SOM %. Decomposition was described using a mono-component model with a time dependent relative decomposition rate. Decomposition rates in the rotations with arable crops were not higher than those for <b>permanent</b> <b>grassland</b> indicating that tillage did not affect decomposition rate and that SOM dynamics were dominated by {{the quantity and quality of}} the substrate input. Simulations indicated that in the long term, decline of SOM must be expected both under arable crop-grassland rotations and under <b>permanent</b> <b>grassland,</b> even in the case of <b>permanent</b> <b>grassland</b> receiving undigested manure. Our results further indicate that strong manure digestion puts pressure on future SOM levels suggesting a trade-off with bio-energy production, and that the contribution of a catch crop to long term SOM is marginal...|$|R
