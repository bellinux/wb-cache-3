25|$|The {{bulk of the}} 103,957 acres {{the company}} owned in the {{district}} were undeveloped, and local people wanted access to this land. After the company introduced restrictions {{on the size of}} the gardens that tenants could plant for their own use on company land in 1945, many of them refused to pay any rent. Some 1,250 tenants were threatened with eviction and, although the government limited the actual evictions to 120, those spared eviction still felt resentment towards the company. There was a further crisis in 1952 and 1953 when a collapse in world tea prices put the British Central Africa Company into a financial deficit. Its local General Manager tried to make good the loss of income by increasing tenants’ rents. Until 1952, the <b>maximum</b> <b>rent</b> permitted by the 1928 Natives on Private Estates Ordinance was 20 shillings or £1 but in that year the 1952 Africans on Private Estates Ordinance proposed an increase in the maximum to 52 shillings and sixpence (£2.625) from July 1953. Although most other estate companies agreed not to charge this maximum, the British Central Africa Company demanded the 52 shillings and sixpence maximum from December 1952. A number of tenants resisted the increase, and the company issued eviction notices, which the government was legally obliged to enforce, but was reluctant to do. In June 1953, the company agreed not to enforce either the evictions or the rent increase. However, its tenants had begun to clear land on undeveloped parts of the company's estates and start cultivation. Many local people refused to pay taxes or attend courts, and riots broke out in Cholo in August 1953, leading to eleven dead and seventy-two injured. Following these riots, Governor Colby urged that another 300,000 acres, including much British Central Africa Company land, should be acquired through voluntary purchase, but the Colonial Office did not support this, so little happened. In 1963, the company still retained a 3,500 acre tea plantation and two tea factories.|$|E
500|$|The Housing Trust {{was a key}} plank in Playford's {{campaign}} to keep costs low and promote investment. By providing cheap housing, workers could also be persuaded to accept lower salaries, therefore keeping production costs down. In 1940, Playford introduced the Housing Improvement Act to parliament, having seen {{the benefits of the}} Housing Trust's activities. The main aims of the legislation were [...] "to improve the adverse housing conditions" [...] by replacing [...] "insanitary, old, crowded, or obsolete dwelling houses" [...] with better-quality buildings—at the time many older residences in the city centre were made of corrugated iron and many areas were slum-like. The law forced landlords to provide a minimum standard of housing and enacted rent controls, setting a <b>maximum</b> <b>rent</b> for various houses; at the time many landlords bought large numbers of low-quality dwellings and charged tenants exorbitant prices. It also expanded the role of the Housing Trust, potentially undercutting the rentier class. Labor were taken aback by Playford's move, as this was the start of a trend whereby the nominally conservative government pursued policies that were more left-wing than other Labor governments across the country. After expressing shock at Playford's [...] "loving kindness to the poor and distressed", Labor helped to get the legislation—which threatened the interests of the landlord class that traditionally supported the LCL—passed into law. During one 15-year period, Housing Trust rents were not increased once despite steady inflation.|$|E

40|$|All {{numbers are}} {{preliminary}} Abstract: Using tenant-level data from fifteen states that represent {{more than thirty}} percent of all Low Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC) units, this paper examines tenant incomes, rental assistance and rent burdens {{to shed light on}} key questions about our largest federal supply-side affordable housing program. Specifically, what are the incomes of the tenants, and does this program reach those with extremely low incomes? What rent burdens are experienced, and is economic diversity within developments achieved? We find that more than forty percent of tenants have extremely low incomes, and the overwhelming majority of such tenants also receive some form of rental assistance. Rent burdens are generally higher than for HUD housing programs, but vary greatly by income level and are lowered by the sizable share of owners who charge below <b>maximum</b> <b>rents.</b> Finally, we find evidence of both economically diverse developments and those with concentrations of households with extremely low incomes.

The owners also complained of the significant numbers resident on their estate who paid no rent under non-disturbance clauses. To meet some of the estate owners’ demands but also give some protection to tenants the protectorate government introduced the Natives on Private Estates Ordinance 1928, which abolishing all rights under non-disturbance clauses, but gave tenants tenancies with a five-year term and with <b>maximum</b> <b>rents</b> fixed by District Rent Boards. Rents could be satisfied in cash, by labour or by selling economic crops to the owner. Blantyre and East Africa Ltd accepted tobacco in lieu of cash rents on some estates but others had become crowded and during the 1930s it obtained cash rents from subsistence farmers on these instead. The company ceased direct operations on its estates in Zomba and Chiradzulu districts, and in 1929 there were no Europeans resident on its estates in those districts, only an agent living in Zomba who visited them periodically.|$|R
40|$|Abstract only. Recent work in {{the domain}} of {{fisheries}} ecology has shown that major changes occur in fish communities exploited by commercial fisheries. Selective fishing pressure on the more highly valued components of fish communities is amongst the key factors proposed to explain these changes. Under de facto open access conditions, it is suggested that sequential over harvesting of higher valued fish and/or fish species leads to modifications in the structure of both fish communities, and fisheries landings. This poses the question of the economic drivers of such sequential over-harvesting, and the implications of this process in terms of the total value of landings from a given fish community. The aim {{of this paper is to}} present an analysis of this question using a simple bio-economic model of an open access fishery targeting different species. The model is used to analyze the process by which harvesting of the set of species develops, given differences in the economic and biological characteristics of these species. Sensitivity to these differences of both development paths and steady state equilibrium of the fishery are analyzed. Simulation results show that, where total effort is controlled but its allocation between alternative species may occur freely (a case of regulated open access), there may be significant consequences in terms of the biological status of stocks, and of potential <b>maximum</b> <b>rents...</b>|$|R

5000|$|The Low-Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC - often {{pronounced}} [...] "lie-tech", Housing Credit) is a dollar-for-dollar {{tax credit}} in the United States for affordable housing investments.

LIHTC accounts for the majority (approximately 90%) of all affordable rental housing created in the United States today. [...] As the <b>maximum</b> <b>rent</b> that can be charged is based upon the Area Median Income ("AMI"), LIHTC housing remains unaffordable to many low-income (<30% AMI) renters.

The tax credits are more attractive than tax deductions as the credits provide a dollar-for-dollar reduction in a taxpayer's federal income tax, whereas a tax deduction only provides a reduction in taxable income. The [...] "passive loss rules" [...] and similar tax changes made by TRA86 greatly reduced the value of tax credits and deductions to individual taxpayers.

40|$|The paper {{presents}} a political agency model that observes how budgetary decisions on public good production affect {{the prospects of}} holding office for an incumbent political party. A simple budgetary function is broadened to include other expenditures such as public sector wages and social transfers so as to present a constraint to rent-extraction. Upon this a ratio of public goods to other expenditures is determined, which the party must keep within certain boundaries set by the voters. Rents are extracted from public good expenditures instead of being exogenously given {{as a part of}} a budget, as the party must be able to conceal rent-extraction due to constitutional boundaries. The incumbent’s decision on rents and public good production directly affects the state of the economy upon which the voters decide whether to re-elect the incumbent or not. Incumbents make their decisions based on observing the economic growth shock. For high levels of growth they decide to respect the voter re-election rule, while for low levels they will defect and extract <b>maximum</b> <b>rents.</b> In a repeated game setting an incumbent will always chose the optimal strategy with respect to the observed growth shock. This way, for high enough levels of economic growth an incumbent party may stay in office for an infinite amount of periods and keep maximizing rents with respect to the given constraints, without having to trade-off rents for holding office. The paper presents empirical evidence on United States gubernatorial and state legislature elections from 1992 to 2008 to evaluate the underlining theory. ...|$|R
