25|$|Another device {{which has}} contributed {{significantly}} to <b>milk</b> <b>quality</b> is the plate heat exchanger (PHE). This device utilizes a number of specially designed stainless steel plates with small spaces between them. Milk is passed between every other set of plates with water being passed between {{the balance of the}} plates to remove heat from the milk. This method of cooling can remove large amounts of heat from the milk in a very short time, thus drastically slowing bacteria growth and thereby improving <b>milk</b> <b>quality.</b> Ground water is the most common source of cooling medium for this device. Dairy cows consume approximately 3 gallons of water for every gallon of milk production and prefer to drink slightly warm water as opposed to cold ground water. For this reason, PHE's can result in drastically improved <b>milk</b> <b>quality,</b> reduced operating costs for the dairymen by reducing the refrigeration load on his bulk milk cooler, and increased milk production by supplying the cows with a source of fresh warm water.|$|E

40|$|This study {{deals with}} the {{question}} under which circumstances (concerning milk and CuCl 2 -concentration per picture) and with which variation the method of biocrystallisa-tion is able to distinguish different <b>milk</b> <b>qualities.</b> <b>Milk</b> <b>qualities</b> are UHT- and raw milk as well as milk from the beginning (A-milk) and ending (E-milk) of lactation. A matrix from different mixing ratios showed that <b>milk</b> <b>qualities</b> are best visually differentiated by 350 µL milk and 175 mg CuCl 2 per plate. However there exists a certain variation in repeatedly produced pictures of one quality. Therefore 38 % of the A- and E-milk-pictures were sorted out because of technical errors (unusual morphology). With 42 % of the pictures the two samples were successfully differentiated by describing the morphological features. With the texture analysis program {{a significant difference between}} the samples (p< 0, 05) was found when analysing selected regions of the picture...|$|R
50|$|At {{the same}} time, Thomas Bates of Kirklevington and John Booth of Killesby were {{developing}} the Teeswater cattle.

25|$|As established, these {{measurements}} are taken daily from the milk bulk tank {{and not from}} individual cows. This is because testing of individual animals at each milking would be expensive, {{but it also means}} that milk from a sick cow is diluted and averaged down by the healthy animals. Greater bulk tanks at very great commercial farms are accommodating of more sick animals in the herd, without the sick animals affecting the overall <b>milk</b> <b>quality</b> rating.|$|E
25|$|Digital {{dermatitis}} {{is caused}} by the bacteria from the genus Treponema. It differs from foot rot and can appear under unsanitary conditions such as poor hygiene or inadequate hoof trimming, among other causes. It primarily affects dairy cattle and has been known to lower the quantity of milk produced, however the <b>milk</b> <b>quality</b> remains unaffected. Cattle are also susceptible to ringworm caused by the fungus, Trichophyton verrucosum, a contagious skin disease which may be transferred to humans exposed to infected cows.|$|E
25|$|Every time a cow {{enters the}} parlor several {{things need to}} happen to ensure <b>milk</b> <b>quality</b> and cow health. First, the cow’s udder must be cleaned and {{disinfected}} to prevent both milk contamination and udder infections. Then the milking technician must check each teat for signs of infection by observing the first stream of milk. During this processes, called stripping the teat, the milking technician is looking for any discoloration or chunkiness that would indicate mastitis, an infection in the cow’s mammary gland. Milk from a cow with mastitis cannot enter the human milk supply, thus farmers must be careful that infected milk does not mix with the milk from healthy cows and that the cow gets the necessary treatment. If the cow passes the mastitis inspection, the milking technician will attach the milking cluster. The cluster will run until the cow is fully milked and then drop off. The milk travels immediately through a cooling system and then into a large cooled storage tank, where it will stay until {{picked up by a}} refrigerated milk truck. Before the cow is released from the milking stalls her teats are disinfected one last time to prevent infection.|$|E
50|$|American breeders {{began to}} become {{interested}} in Holstein-Friesian cattle around the 1830s. Black and white cattle were introduced into the US from 1621 to 1664. The eastern part of New Amsterdam (present day New York) was the Dutch colony of New Netherland, where many Dutch farmers settled along the Hudson and Mohawk River valleys. They probably brought cattle with them from their native land and crossed them with cattle purchased in the colony. For many years afterwards, the cattle here were called Dutch cattle and were renowned for their <b>milking</b> <b>qualities.</b>|$|R

5000|$|Lower <b>milk</b> <b>quality</b> - Somatic {{cell count}} (SCC) and Plate loop count (PLC) are, respectively, {{measurements}} of the quantity of white blood cells and total number of bacteria present in a milk sample. A high SCC indicates reduced udder health (as the immune system fights some infection) and implies lower <b>milk</b> <b>quality.</b> AMS herds consistently show higher SCCs than conventionally milked herds. A high PLC indicates bacterial contamination, usually through poor sanitation or cooling and similarly implies low <b>milk</b> <b>quality.</b> High PLC in AMS {{may be attributed to}} the continuous use of milking lines (rather than twice a day in conventional systems), which reduces the time window for cleaning, and the incremental addition of milk to the bulk milk tank which may not cool efficiently at low milk levels.|$|E

30|$|For example, if the {{processing}} sector is not competitive, then, {{all the work}} of USAID and others to expand the supply of milk might be wasted as producers will continue to receive low prices for their milk, the supply of high <b>quality</b> <b>milk</b> will still be insufficient for the population, affluent urban consumers will continue paying high prices for their milk and the informal market will remain. In this context, JICA’s strategy might be appropriate because it will not only ensure {{the expansion of the}} supply of high <b>quality</b> <b>milk</b> but also “discipline” the non-competitive processing sector and force them to expand to compete.|$|R
