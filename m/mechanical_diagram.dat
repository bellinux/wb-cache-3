40|$|Uso di logica lineare per la specifica di linguaggi e ambienti visivi. Like written textual {{languages}} and their spoken equivalents, many {{other types of}} symbolic notations, for example musical scores, {{can be regarded as}} languages. By “languages” we mean that they constitute communication systems based on symbol combinations and that they are, at least in principle, formalizable. Where such systems are visual or graphical in nature, it is thus justified to speak of “visual languages”. However, this term is ambiguous: we often speak of the “visual language” of an artist to describe the artist’s particular way of expressing himself or herself. This almost never means that we could define a formal system of expression that the artist uses and through which we could mechanically derive an “interpretation” of a work. In contrast, the syntax and semantics of more technical visual languages, such as organizational charts, dance notation, electrical circuit diagrams and mathematical notations, can often be formalized rigorously. A whole spectrum of semi-formal visual languages exists between these two extremes, ranging from draft sketches in architectural design over maps to sign languages, such as ASL or Auslan. In general, visual languages do not only differ in {{the degree to which they}} are strict and can be formalized, but also in the degree to which they use distinct symbols as their fundamental means of expression. For example, a valve in a <b>mechanical</b> <b>diagram</b> is clearly a distinct symbol, whereas it is not so clear whether shading in a map can or should always be understood in the same way. For the sake of clarity, we will use the term “diagrammatic languages” for visual languages that are based on individual symbols and form expressions through spatial arrangement of these symbols. As is evident from the examples above, such diagrammatic languages are central in almost all technical domains, and they are also relevant to many aspects of everyday life. The research field of “diagrammatic reasoning” investigates such languages from the perspective of computer science and cognitive science. The central questions for this field are how we understand such {{languages and}} how we employ them as tools in reasoning processes. To investigate these questions in a rigorous way we need formal frameworks that allow us to define diagrammatic languages and to reason about them. From the perspective of computer science, we are particularly interested in how interpretation and reasoning can be performed automatically on the basis of formal specifications of diagrammatic languages. It seems obvious that the treatment of diagrammatic languages should distinguish between syntax and semantics, just as we do for textual languages, and that a general framework needs to bridge between these two aspects. The treatment of diagram syntax has been investigated for close to three decades and is now reasonably well-understood. The vast majority of methods that are employed are essentially generalizations of approaches from computational linguistics for textual languages, mostly grammar frameworks. However, as diagrammatic notations are inherently two- or three-dimensional rather than linear (as textual languages are), these grammar frameworks have to be extended. This has given rise to the field of multi-dimensional grammars. The various forms of multi-dimensional grammars, such as relational grammars, multiset grammars and constraint multiset grammars, are now relatively mature formalisms that are widely used to specify diagram syntax and to build computational tools for diagrammatic languages. The majority of computational methods for the automatic interpretation of diagrams take a syntax-based two-step approach consisting of parsing and interpretation proper, and multi-dimensional grammar frameworks are well-suited to cover the first phase. However, when it comes to the interpretation proper, i. e. the treatment of semantics, they provide little support. Thus, this phase is most often covered by ad-hoc approaches defined on a case-by-case basis for individual diagram languages. Grammar-based methods also have some other shortcomings: Firstly, it is important to acknowledge that diagrams are rarely used in isolation, but rather in combination with textual language. Thus, the interpretation of diagrammatic languages needs to take into account non-diagrammatic contextual information, for example for disambiguation. In a grammatical framework the integration of such contextual information is difficult. Secondly, while multi-dimensional grammars are relatively mature computational tools, their theory is not well developed, meaning that it is difficult, for instance, to prove formal properties, such as the equivalence of grammars. In the light of these shortcomings, logic approaches present themselves as a valuable alternative to grammatical frameworks. Logic approaches, by their very nature, are semantic. A logic calculus for reasoning with and about diagrammatic languages is thus a more adequate approach to treating semantics. Interestingly, the increased power of a logic specification over a grammatical one does not come at a price, as a well-designed logic approach can fully subsume the grammatical approach. The remainder of the chapter will trace out the progress that the last two decades of research have made in this direction. In the next section we will briefly outline the grammatical approach to visual language specification and highlight its shortcomings as a basis for this research plan. We will then revisit the question why do we want reasoning with diagram languages? to motivate an alternative approach. This section will also outline what forms of reasoning will be required. Following this, we will outline the history of logic approaches to diagrammatic languages and detail the comparative advantages and disadvantages of the different types of logic formalization. Based on this, the core of this chapter will develop a new approach, based on linear logic, which avoids most of the shortcomings and completely subsumes the grammatical approach. We will show this subsumption formally. We will then briefly outline existent software systems based on this approach. The concluding section reflects on what has been achieved so far and gives recommendations for future research direction...|$|E

However, eye-tracking has several drawbacks: accurate eye-tracking equipment is expensive, often awkward for participants, requires frequent re-calibration and the data can be diÆcult to interpret. We introduce an alternative tool for diagram research: the Restricted Focus Viewer (RFV). This is a computer program which takes an image, blurs it and displays it on a computer monitor, allowing the participant to see only a small region of the image in focus at any time. The region in focus can be moved using the computer mouse. The RFV records what the participant is focusing on {{at any point in}} time. It is cheap, non-intrusive, does not require calibration and provides accurate data about which region is being focused upon. We describe this tool, and also provide an experimental comparison with eye-tracking. We show that the RFV gives similar results to those obtained by Hegarty (1992) when using eye-tracking equipment to investigate reasoning about <b>mechanical</b> <b>diagrams.</b> ...|$|R

For example, when deciding how to arrange furniture in a new home, one might project the image of an armchair into an empty corner or the image of a painting onto a wall. The experience of noticing a constellation in the sky at night is also perceptual-imaginative amalgam: it involves both seeing the stars in the constellation and imagining the lines that connect them at the same time. I here refer to such hybrid experiences – involving both a bottom-up, externally generated component and a top-down, internally generated component – as make-perceive (Briscoe 2008, 2011). My discussion in this paper has two parts. In the first part, I show that make-perceive enables human beings to solve certain problems and pursue certain projects more effectively than bottom-up perceiving or top-down visualization alone. To this end, the skillful use of projected mental imagery is surveyed in a variety of contexts, including action planning, the interpretation of static <b>mechanical</b> <b>diagrams,</b> and non-instrumental navigation. In the second part, I address the question of whether make-perceive may help to account for the “phenomenal presence” of occluded or otherwise hidden features of perceived objects. I argue that phenomenal presence is not well explained by the hypothesis that hidden features are represented using projected mental images. In defending this position, I point to important phenomenological and functional differences between the way hidden object features are represented respectively in mental imagery and amodal completion...|$|R

We used a conservative reanalysis of an existing morphological dataset to generate a phylogeny that guided our selection of seven short- and long-jawed taxa in which to investigate the functional anatomy {{of the head and}} jaws: Chaetodon xanthurus, Prognathodes falcifer (formerly Chaetodon falcifer), Chelmon rostratus, Heniochus acuminatus, Johnrandallia nigrirostris, Forcipiger flavissimus, and F. longirostris. We used manipulations of fresh, preserved, and cleared and stained specimens to develop <b>mechanical</b> <b>diagrams</b> of how the jaws might be protruded or depressed. Species differed {{based on the number of}} joints within the suspensorium. We used high-speed video analysis of five of the seven species (C. xanthurus, Chel. rostratus, H. acuminatus, F. flavissimus, and F. longirostris) to test our predictions based on the mechanical diagrams: two suspensorial joints should facilitate purely anteriorly directed protrusion of the lower jaw, one joint should allow less anterior protrusion and result in more depression of the lower jaw, and no joints in the suspensorium should constrain the lower jaw to simple ventral rotation around the jaw joint, as seen in generalized perciform fishes. We found that the longest-jawed species, F. longirostris, was able to protrude its jaws in a predominantly anterior direction and further than any other species. This was achieved with little input from cranial elevation, the principal input for other known lower jaw protruders, and is hypothesized to be facilitated by separate modifications to the sternohyoideus mechanism and to the adductor arcus palatini muscle. In F. longirostris the adductor arcus palatini muscle has fibers oriented anteroposteriorly rather than medial-laterally, as seen in most other perciforms and in the other butterflyfish studied. These fibers are oriented such that they could rotate the ventral portion of the quadrate anteriorly, thus projecting the lower jaw anteriorly. The intermediate species lack modification of the adductor arcus palatini and do not protrude their jaws as far (in the case of F. flavissimus) or in a purely anterior fashion (in the case of Chel. rostratus). The short-jawed species both exhibit only ventral rotation of the lower jaw, despite the fact that H. acuminatus is closely related to Forcipiger...|$|R

The vibrational echo is the vibrational analog of the NMR spin echo and selectively eliminates inhomogeneous broadening from the echo spectrum, providing direct information about the timescale of dynamics within a sample. Echo experiments performed by the Fayer group at Stanford University on carbonmonoxy myoglobin discriminate between the dynamic lineshapes of the A states of MbCO. By performing classical molecular dynamics simulations and using nonlinear optical response theory, we have identified the microscopic origins of these states based upon agreement between the experimental vibrational echo decays of the states and echo decays calculated for two distinct structures observed within simulation. We have analysed the properties of the vibrational echo response within the framework of classical mechanics. We have discovered that van Kampen's objection to nonlinear response theory is particularly significant in classical mechanics, where we have shown that the classical echo response function describing the experimental signal diverges in time for a thermal ensemble of noninteracting anharmonic oscillators. We have interpreted the dephasing and rephasing of the vibrational echo experiment in terms of a classical picture which also identifies the classical analogs of quantum <b>mechanical</b> double-sided Feynman <b>diagrams.</b> We have investigated the role of resonant coupling on the quantum mechanical vibrational echo at zero temperature and have analytically taken the classical limit of this expression to investigate the effect of resonance on classical echoes.
