In fractioned radiotherapy (FRT), lesions are irradiated in several sessions so that healthy neighbouring tissues are better preserved than when treatment {{is carried out}} in one fraction. In the case of intracranial tumors, classical methods of patient positioning in the irradiation <b>machine</b> <b>coordinate</b> <b>system</b> are invasive and only allow for CRT in one irradiation session. This contribution presents a noninvasive positioning method representing a first step towards the combination of CRT and FRT. The 3 D data used for the positioning is point clouds spread over the patient's head (CT-data usually acquired during treatment) and points distributed over the patient's face which are acquired with a structured light sensor fixed in the therapy room. The geometrical transformation linking the coordinate systems of the diagnosis device (CT-modality) and the 3 D sensor of the therapy room (visible light modality) is obtained by registering the surfaces represented by the two 3 D point sets. The geometrical relationship between the coordinate systems of the 3 D sensor and the irradiation machine is given by a calibration of the sensor position in the therapy room.

40|$|AbstractThe {{smoothness}} {{tool path}} {{is essential in}} five-axis high speed machining. However, the smoothness of the tool orientation in the part coordinate system cannot assure the smooth motions of the rotary axes of a five-axis machine tool because the conversion of tool posture from the part coordinate system to the <b>machine</b> <b>coordinate</b> <b>system</b> is nonlinear. To generate a tool path with smooth rotary motions of the five-axis machine tool, the tool path in this paper is represented with three spline curves: the cutter location curve and the two trajectory curves of the rotary axes of the machine tool, so that the rotary axes’ motions can be simultaneously smoothed. For a flank milling tool path, the geometric deviations between the envelope surface of the tool movement and the design surface should be respected while smoothing the tool path. The point-to-surface distance is adopted to calculate the geometric deviations, and then a smoothness optimization model is developed to smooth the rotary axes’ motions using the weighted least squares method. A numerical example of five-axis flank milling of a S-shape surface is given to confirm the validity and efficiency of the proposed approach...|$|E

40|$|AbstractScoring of {{the outer}} layers of a {{workpiece}} with small engagement (ae) using circular saws is a well known method to avoid unwanted delamination of these layers, such as coatings of wooden particle boards. In edge milling fibre reinforced plastics (FRP), delamination also occurs in the top or bottom layer of the component and requires time intensive rework or scrapping of material. A combined process of scoring and milling is {{presented in this paper}} as a means to avoid delamination during machining of FRP structures such as aircraft carbon FRP parts. For the scoring process a diamond electroplated circular wheel is used. To guarantee a constant width of the scored slot, a constant depth of engagement is needed due to the shape of the grinding wheel. Therefore the profile of the scoring path on the workpiece surface is measured with respect to the <b>machine</b> <b>coordinate</b> <b>system</b> to correct a variation in the workpiece thickness and to compensate for uneven clamping. Next, the workpiece is scored with constant depth of engagement (ae,s 50 μm) at an increased feed velocity (vf,m = 4. 5 m/min). Without scoring, flawed workpiece edges have been obtained with cutting edge radii beyond rn > 23 μm (progressive uniform wear stage) and a feed velocity of vf,m = 1. 5 m/min.

A complete automation of the procedure appears very promising for a reliable referencing sub micrometric accuracy. This automation process has been estimated to strongly improve present state of the art because the largest influence on the accuracy derives from the manual or semi-automated referencing routines. Compared to state of the art manual work piece referencing where a typical accuracy of about 10 micrometer is obtained, the referencing accuracy could be increased by a factor 100 by the semi-automated referencing process. A complete automation of the procedure appears very promising for a reliable referencing accuracy below 0. 1 micrometer.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a relatively inexpensive, fast, {{and easy to}} execute approach to maping the volumetric errors of a machine tool, coordinate measuring machine, or robot. An error map is used to characterize a machine or to improve its accuracy by compensating for the systematic errors. The method consists of three steps: (1) models the relationship between volumetric error and {{the current state of}} the machine, (2) acquiring error data based on distance measurements throughout the work volume; and (3) fitting the error model using the nonlinear equation for the distance. The error model is formulated from the kinematic relationship among the six degrees of freedom of error an each moving axis. Expressing each parametric error as function of position each is combined to predict the error between the functional point and workpiece, also as a function of position. A series of distances between several fixed base locations and various functional points in the work volume is measured using a Laser Ball Bar (LBB). Each measured distance is a non-linear function dependent on the commanded location of the machine, the machine error, and the location of the base locations. Using the error model, the non-linear equation is solved producing a fit for the error model Also note that, given approximate distances between each pair of base locations, the exact base locations in the <b>machine</b> <b>coordinate</b> <b>system</b> determined during the non-linear filling procedure. Furthermore, with the use of 2048 more than three base locations, bias error in the measuring instrument can be removed The volumetric errors of three-axis commercial machining center have been mapped using this procedure. In this study, only errors associated with the nominal position of the machine were considered Other errors such as thermally induced and load induced errors were not considered although the mathematical model has the ability to account for these errors. Due to the proprietary nature of the projects we are not able to report actual error measurements. instead, we have scaled the work volume to 5 OOx 5 OOx 5 OOmm and proportionally scaled the errors.

40|$|For high {{measurement}} accuracy with X-ray computed tomography (CT), that requires no scale calibration afterwards, due to incorrect assessment of voxel size during a CT scan, object magnification {{needs to be}} precisely calculated {{in order to minimize}} scale error of the reconstructed volume. Magnification, which is given by the z-axis of the <b>machine’s</b> <b>coordinate</b> <b>system,</b> is defined by the ratio between the source-detector (SDD) and source-rotation axis distances (SRD).

The procedure bases itself in the use of radiographs acquired along the magnification axis rather than whole 3 D scans.

A series of test parts were machined with a Haas Vertical Milling Machine (VMM) and a Leica laser tracker as proof of concept and to determine the errors introduced into the machining process by adding the additional metrology system. Monte Carlo simulations confirm that adding the stand-alone metrology system increases the magnitude of errors to approximately {{the accuracy of the}} metrology system itself, about 50 micrometers. The initial set of test parts machined showed errors at a factor of 25 larger than expected.

40|$|By {{changing}} from 3 -axis to 5 -axis machining, cutting efficiency and machining quality could be enhanced a lot. The two more rotary axes make cutting flexible and efficient, {{but they also}} bring some troubles for controlling. More and more complex machining environment and complicated freeform surface challenge users to define more accurate and appropriate tool paths and tool orientations. Traditionally, for the flat-end cutter, due to the intertwined dependence relationship between its axis and reference point, most 5 -axis tool-path generation methods take a decoupled two-stage strategy: first, the so-called cutter contact (CC) curves are placed on the part surface; then, for each CC curve, tool orientations are decided that will accommodate local and/or global constraints such as minimum local gouging and global interference avoidance. For the former stage, usually simplistic “offset” methods are adopted to determine the cutter contact curves, such as the iso-parametric or iso-plane methods; whereas for the latter, the common practice is to assign fixed tilt and yaw angle to the tool axis regardless the local curvature information and, {{in the case of}} considering global interference, the tool orientation is decided solely based on avoiding global collision but ignoring important local machining efficiency issues. This independence between the placement of CC curves and the determination of tool orientations, as well as the rigid way in which the tilt and yaw angles get assigned, incurs many undesired problems, such as the abrupt change of tool orientations, the reduced efficiency in machining, the reduced finishing surface quality, the unnecessary dynamic loading on the machine, etc. In our work, we present a system that aims at alleviating these problems and thus to improve the machining efficiency and accuracy. Iso-conic method and visibility map(VMap) are proposed to support the system. The former is to generate a series of tool paths on which the tool orientations have some special properties to guarantee large machining strip width and smooth changing in part coordinate system and <b>machine</b> <b>coordinate</b> <b>system.</b> And the later, VMap, is to collect all the information about the complex environments, including machining components and machining parts, to help to avoid global interference and guarantee the angular-velocity compliance.

40|$|To {{provide a}} solid base for {{improved}} material exploitation in dimensioning calculations {{it is necessary}} to determine the stress state in the part prior to service loading. In order to achieve higher material strength at elevated temperatures, the surface temperature gradient with respect to time has to be sufﬁciently high during heat treatment. This results in non-negligable residual stresses that can reduce the allowable load level upon which yielding occurs. For titanium alloys there are two common heat treatments, namely solution treatment and mill annealing. The latter one is the method of choice within the presented project. Mill annealing is utilized in order to signiﬁcantly reduce the residual stresses in the parts without loosing much of the improved strength at elevated temperatures. Quantiﬁcation of residual stresses is done by solving an inverse problem. From the measurement of distortion, induced by dividing the investigated part, the residual stress state can be calculated via analytical modeling or correlation with ﬁnite element models. To assure a minimum perturbation of the residual stress state during specimen production, dividing of the part is accomplished by electric discharge machining. The parts of interest are v-shaped prisms with a length of approximatly 450 mm and a thickness in the cross sectional area from about 20 mm to 45 mm. Figure 1 (a) shows the forged part and 1 (b) the dimensions of the cross section in millimeters as well as the material properties considered in the ﬁnite element model. The heat exchange between the part and the environment is modelled as heat transfer by convection superimposed with heat radiation. Since the parts are exposed to air during forging and heat treatment, the surface develops a strongly adhesive oxide layer, the so called alpha-case. After forging the parts are cooled in air and heat treated at a temperature of 720 ° C for a duration of 120 min. Subsequent air cooling and removing the alpha-case by shot peening and chemical treatment in a mixture of nitric and hydroﬂouric acid ﬁnishes the processing. The residual stress state in the parts is quantiﬁed through correlation of results obtained by ﬁnite element simulations and high precision deﬂection experiments. Experimental measuring errors are minimized by using the capability of the wire cutting machine to measure locations on the specimens with respect to the ﬁxed <b>machine</b> <b>coordinate</b> <b>system.</b> A sophisticated design of cutting operations allows an analysis of the part without removing the ﬁxture and hence makes it possible to achieve a very high accuracy of the displacement measurements of about 4 µm. The quality of the obtained results also depends on the ﬁnite element models describing the mechanics of the experimental investigations as precise as possible. Since numerical modeling of shot peening and chemical milling is rather complicated, the whole processing route of the shapes is simpliﬁed assuming that the individual contribution of all process steps to the residual stress state can be described by virtual heat transfer coeﬃcients. The overall virtual heat transfer coeﬃcient for the whole processing route is calculated from the linear superposition of the individual heat transfer coeffcients for each processing step. Detailed analysis of the obtained overall virtual heat transfer coefficients in comparison with experimentally obtained ones shows, that other processing steps besides the heat treatment considerably influence the residual stress state. In order to make the conducted simulation scheme applicable in practise, advanced finite element modeling techniques are developed. The experimentally derived deflection curves are correlated to the finite element results via a least square fit...|$|E
