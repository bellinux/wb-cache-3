5|$|The Madras Presidency annexed {{the kingdom}} of Mysore in 1831 on {{allegations}} of <b>maladministration</b> and restored it to Chamaraja Wodeyar (1881–94), the grandson and heir of the deposed Mummadi Krishnaraja Wodeyar (1799–1868) in 1881. Thanjavur was annexed in 1855, {{following the death of}} Shivaji II (1832–1855) who left no male heir.|$|E
5|$|Beyond {{these initial}} prosecutions, the ecclesia {{attacked}} Pericles himself by {{asking him to}} justify his ostensible profligacy with, and <b>maladministration</b> of, public money. According to Plutarch, Pericles was so afraid of the oncoming trial {{that he did not}} let the Athenians yield to the Lacedaemonians. Beloch also believes that Pericles deliberately brought on the war to protect his political position at home. Thus, {{at the start of the}} Peloponnesian War, Athens found itself in the awkward position of entrusting its future to a leader whose pre-eminence had just been seriously shaken for the first time in over a decade.|$|E
5|$|Jurisdiction over {{charitable}} disputes {{is shared}} equally between the High Court of Justice and the Charity Commission. The Commission, the first port of call, is tasked with regulating and promoting charitable trusts, {{as well as}} providing advice and opinions to trustees on administrative matters. Where the Commission feels there has been mismanagement or <b>maladministration,</b> it can sanction the trustees, removing them, appointing new ones or temporarily taking the trust property itself to prevent harm being done. Where there are flaws with a charity, the High Court can administer schemes directing the function of the charity, or even, under the Cy-près doctrine, change the purpose of the charity or gift altogether.|$|E
5|$|Power was now wielded by {{the senior}} bureaucrats, who {{installed}} {{the weak and}} pliable al-Muqtadir on the throne. Over the next decades, the expenditure of both the court and the army increased, while <b>maladministration</b> and strife between military and bureaucratic factions intensified. By 932, when al-Muqtadir was assassinated, the Caliphate was effectively bankrupt, and authority soon devolved {{on a series of}} military strongmen who competed for control of the caliph and the title of amīr al-umarāʾ. This process culminated in the capture of Baghdad in 946 by the Buyids, who put an end to caliphal independence even in name. Thereafter the caliphs remained as symbolic figureheads, but were divested of any military or political authority or independent financial resources.|$|E
25|$|The {{kingdom of}} Mysore was annexed to the Madras Presidency in 1831 on {{accounts}} of <b>maladministration,</b> but was {{restored to the}} rightful heir in 1881.|$|E
25|$|As {{with all}} public budgets, the EU's budget {{is also at}} risk of <b>maladministration.</b> Every year, the Court of Auditors reports on the {{management}} of the budget. The introduction of transparency and a double-entry book-keeping system is likely to improve budget management.|$|E
25|$|Applegarth lead an {{investigation}} into the Bee-Hive's reporting in 1865, and accused Potter of personal dishonesty and <b>maladministration</b> regarding the journal's coverage of an industrial dispute in North Staffordshire. As a result, the Bee-Hive ceased to be the LTC's official journal and Potter lost his seat on the executive board.|$|E
25|$|The Manly lines, {{which were}} {{administered}} by the Railways, suffered from <b>maladministration</b> (as {{in the case of}} the Castle Hill line), resulting in considerable overcapitalisation of the network, unnecessary re-routing and re-building of the track at Manly terminus. Consequently, the system never made a profit. Re-building the terminal at Manly terminus several times, accompanied by costly property resumption, accounted for huge expenditures with little gain.|$|E
25|$|The <b>maladministration</b> of {{the first}} Audiencia {{continued}} until the return of Cortés in July 1530. The members of the Audiencia intended to depose Cortés, but were prevented {{by the actions of}} Bishop Zumárraga. Shortly thereafter, the members of the second Audiencia arrived, taking power in January 1531. The second Audiencia was much different from the first, honest, capable and dedicated to good government and fair treatment of the Indigenous.|$|E
25|$|The Kingdoms of Naples and Sicily were officially merged in 1816 by Ferdinand I to {{form the}} Kingdom of the Two Sicilies. The {{accession}} of Ferdinand II as king of the Two Sicilies in 1830 was hailed by Sicilians; they dreamed that autonomy would {{be returned to the}} island and the problems of poverty and <b>maladministration</b> of justice would be tackled by the count of Syracuse, the king's brother and lieutenant in Sicily.|$|E
25|$|In 1954, the {{government}} was embarrassed by the Crichel Down affair which focused public fears about <b>maladministration</b> and the abuse of executive authority. The magnitude and complexity of ministerial decisions had caused many such decisions gradually to be delegated to {{a growing number of}} tribunals and in 1955, {{the government}} used the debate created by Crichel Down to order a committee under Sir Oliver Franks to report on administrative tribunals and inquiries, though not ministerial decisions of the kind that Crichel Down had exposed.|$|E
25|$|As {{a reward}} for his loyal services, Gaius Marius ran with Aquillius under a joint ticket for the consulship of 101 BC. After the consulship, with Rome {{struggling}} with famine caused by the slave revolt on Sicily, Aquillius was sent to put it down. Aquilius completely subdued Salvius and his insurgents and got an ovation in Rome in 100 BC. In 98 BC, Aquillius was accused by Lucius Fufius of <b>maladministration</b> in Sicily. In the trial he was defended by Marcus Antonius, Consul in 99 BC, and {{even if there were}} strong proofs of his guilt, he was acquitted because of his bravery in the war.|$|E
25|$|Dana {{made the}} Sun a Democratic newspaper, {{independent}} and outspoken in {{the expression of}} its opinions respecting the affairs of either party. His criticisms of civil <b>maladministration</b> during General Grant's terms as president led to a notable attempt {{on the part of}} that administration, in July 1873, to take him from New York on a charge of libel, to be tried without a jury in a Washington police court. Application was made to the United States District Court in New York for a warrant of removal, but in a memorable decision Judge Blatchford, later a justice of the Supreme Court of the United States, refused the warrant, holding the proposed form of trial to be unconstitutional. Perhaps {{to a greater extent than}} in the case of any other conspicuous journalist, Dana's personality was identified in the public mind with the newspaper that he edited.|$|E
25|$|Ngata {{acted as}} a major force behind the revival of arts such as kapa haka and carving. He also enacted a {{programme}} of land development, which helped many iwi retain and develop their land. Ngata became very close to Te Puea, the Waikato kingite leader, who {{was supported by the}} government in her attempt to improve living conditions for Waikato. Ngata transferred four blocks of land to Te Puea and her husband and arranged extensive government grants and loans. Ngata sacked the pakeha farm development officer and replaced him with Te Puea. He arranged for her to have a car to travel around the various farms. Te Puea's husband was also given a large farm at Tikitere near Rotorua. The public, media and parliament became alarmed at the flow of funds from government to Te Puea during the recession. A Royal Commission was held in 1934 that found Ngata guilty of <b>maladministration</b> and misappropriation of funds to the value of 500,000 pounds. Ngata was forced to resign.|$|E
25|$|The tournament {{featured}} five teams, {{the same}} as at the preceding 2003 edition, and the same format was used, a simple round-robin. The United States finished the tournament undefeated to win its first title, and consequently qualified for the 2006 Under-19 World Cup in Sri Lanka. The team had nearly been barred from playing, as part of proposed International Cricket Council (ICC) sanctions against the United States of America Cricket Association (USACA) for <b>maladministration,</b> but the situation was resolved the month before the tournament. Canada was the runner-up at the championship, with the Cayman Islands placing third, Bermuda fourth, and Argentina placing last, again finishing winless. The tournament was affected by rain, with two matches being abandoned and another shortened. A feature of the championship was its low scoring, with only four innings above 200 being recorded from the ten matches played. The tournament's leading runscorer, Canadian batsman Trevin Bastiampillai, was the only player to record more than 100 runs, while the leading wicket-taker was American bowler Abhimanyu Rajp, who took two five-wicket hauls.|$|E
500|$|In the 9th–11th centuries, the orphanotrophos role {{seems to}} have been limited to the {{imperial}} orphanage in the capital, while the provincial charitable foundations were under the supervision of two other officials, the chartoularios tou sakelliou and the megas kourator. The orphanotrophos was responsible for his wards and steward of their fortune until the age of 20, unless they married earlier; he was forbidden from selling his wards' possessions unless by special authorisation; and in case of <b>maladministration</b> was answerable to the Eparch of the City. According to the 10th-century De ceremoniis, the orphanotrophos had the following subordinate officials: ...|$|E
500|$|Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg concurred in {{the opinion}} of the majority. Ginsburg {{expanded}} on the differences between the lack of liability under Mitchell I and the imposition of damages to compensate [...] "for the harm caused by <b>maladministration</b> of the property." [...] She stated that the opinion of the court was consent with other cases, such as Mitchell II and United States v. Navajo Nation, where the government has exercised control in a [...] "manner irreconcilable with its caretaker obligations". Ginsburg stated that the government had clearly failed its caretaker duties. [...] Ginsburg was joined by Justice Breyer in the concurrence.|$|E
500|$|The case {{began in}} Sydney's District Court on 21 August 1952. Shand's {{examination}} of the various Board members appearing for the defendant revealed the Board's <b>maladministration,</b> pettiness and its acceptance of rumour as fact. No firm reason was put forward for the omission of Barnes and a division within the Board was evident when several of its members spoke highly of him. As Barnes began his testimony {{on the second day}} of proceedings, Raith's counsel announced settlement of the case and commented to the court, [...] "seldom in the history of libel actions has such a plea failed so completely and utterly". Barnes was vindicated with a full public apology.|$|E
500|$|After the English Restoration, those {{judges and}} {{officials}} sacked under Cromwell were reinstated, with little modern progression; as Kerly puts it, [...] "unjust judges presided again, and rank <b>maladministration</b> invaded the offices". The situation was much improved, nonetheless, {{because many of}} the faults were down to the machinery of the court rather than the spirit, which Lord Clarendon soon rectified. Upon appointment as Lord Chancellor he immediately published a new issue of the Orders for the Regulation of the Practice of the Court of Chancery. This was based on the code set by the Cromwellian Commissioners, and limited the fees charged by the court and the amount of time they could take on a case.|$|E
500|$|The {{reign of}} Isaac II, and more so {{that of his}} brother Alexios III, saw the {{collapse}} of {{what remained of the}} centralised machinery of Byzantine government and defence. Although the Normans were driven out of Greece, in 1186 the Vlachs and Bulgars began a rebellion that {{led to the formation of}} the Second Bulgarian Empire. The internal policy of the Angeloi was characterised by the squandering of the public treasure and fiscal <b>maladministration.</b> Imperial authority was severely weakened, and the growing power vacuum at the center of the Empire encouraged fragmentation. There is evidence that some Komnenian heirs had set up a semi-independent state in Trebizond before 1204. According to Alexander Vasiliev, [...] "the dynasty of the Angeloi, Greek in its origin,... accelerated the ruin of the Empire, already weakened without and disunited within." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1919, Darling {{moved from}} Stonehenge to Claremont House, {{around which the}} Hobart suburb of Claremont later formed. He {{was elected to the}} Cambridge {{electorate}} in the Tasmanian Legislative Council in 1921 as an independent. He retained his position in the Parliament until his death in 1946. In Parliament, one of his colleagues was Charles Eady, his teammate from the 1896 tour of England. [...] Darling was recognised by his colleagues as a forceful, no-nonsense speaker. In the 1930s, he won an exemption from land tax for small farmers, and {{toward the end of his}} parliamentary career, a Royal Commission was appointed to investigate charges Darling had made regarding <b>maladministration.</b> The findings of the commission, released after his death, saw a government Minister and two others found guilty of accepting bribes. Darling was made a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 1938 New Year Honours in recognition of his work as a member of the Legislative Assembly.|$|E
500|$|All minorities, [...] or linguistic, can set {{up their}} own {{educational}} institutions to preserve and develop their own culture. In granting aid to institutions, the State cannot discriminate against any institution {{on the basis of the}} fact that it is administered by a minority institution. But the right to administer does not mean that the State cannot interfere in case of <b>maladministration.</b> In a precedent-setting judgement in 1980, the Supreme Court held that the State can certainly take regulatory measures to promote the efficiency and excellence of educational standards. It can also issue guidelines for ensuring the security of the services of the teachers or other employees of the institution. In another landmark judgement delivered on 31 October 2002, the Supreme Court ruled that in case of aided minority institutions offering professional courses, admission could be only through a common entrance test conducted by State or a university. Even an unaided minority institution ought not to ignore the merit of the students for admission.|$|E
500|$|In 1289, grave {{complaints}} arose of the <b>maladministration</b> of {{the entire}} justice system during King Edward I's absence in Gascony. The wide-ranging royal enquiry that followed in 1290 found that Thomas Weyland, Chief Justice of the Common Pleas had, among other offences, erased an entry in the plea rolls and substituted a false one, evidently in collusion with {{a party to the}} case. Weyland's offences were severe enough that he had his goods and chattels confiscated and he was exiled from the realm. Weyland, three of the four other Justices of the Common Pleas (who did not participate in the fraud but were held responsible for not preventing it), and the Master of the Rolls were heavily fined. The three judges of the Court of King's Bench were also dimissed. Beckingham was the only Justice of the Common Pleas acquitted of the charges. He thereby gained a historical record for probity. More recently, {{it has been suggested that}} his escape from censure may simply have been due to his absence from Westminster Hall the previous year whilst on the Dorsetshire eyre, where it is known that fines were levied before him, and the Lyme Regis burgess' pleas to Queen Eleanor heard. He appears to have continued in the discharge of his duties until 1307, for he was regularly summoned to parliament as a justice between 1288 and 1305. From the fact that he was no longer summoned to parliament after the latter date, it may be inferred that he died or retired before the date when parliament next met. His work within the courts seems to have leaned towards the [...] "more routine" [...] procedural aspects of court work.|$|E

2500|$|Although Equitable’s {{management}} initially {{welcomed the}} announcement, [...] {{they were concerned}} that compensation {{would be based on}} Sir John’s report, written on the premise that only five of the Ombudsman’s findings of <b>maladministration</b> were valid. In opposition, Hoban had promised that all ten counts would be considered. Equitable's Chief executive, Chris Wiscarson wrote to Hoban saying that they could not support Chadwick’s recommendations which would only cover about 10% of losses. [...] Compensation should be based on a total figure of £4.8B.|$|E

[...] Little by little he sought to combat the charges of <b>maladministration</b> and corruption, from the Augean stables of the detective department to the chaotic nature of government administration. However, another current was affecting South Africa, one over which Smuts could exercise no control.|$|E
2500|$|State {{finances}} were {{in total}} disarray; {{the government could}} only cover its expenses through the plunder and the tribute of foreign countries. If peace were made, the armies would return home and the directors would {{have to face the}} exasperation of the rank-and-file who had lost their livelihood, as well as the ambition of generals who could, in a moment, brush them aside. Barras and Rewbell were notoriously corrupt themselves and screened corruption in others. The patronage of the directors was ill-bestowed, and the general <b>maladministration</b> heightened their unpopularity.|$|E
2500|$|Churchill {{permanently}} {{broke with}} Stanley Baldwin over Indian independence and never again held any office while Baldwin was prime minister. Some historians see his basic attitude to India as being {{set out in}} his book My Early Life (1930). There has been debate over Churchill's culpability {{in the deaths of}} hundreds of thousands of Indians during the Bengal famine of 1943 where London ate India's bread while India starved, some commentators point to the disruption of the traditional marketing system and <b>maladministration</b> at the provincial level as a cause with Churchill saying that the famine was the Indians own fault for [...] "breeding like rabbits".|$|E
2500|$|In July 2008, the Parliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman {{completed}} a four-year investigation, described by Equitable's chief executive as the [...] "best chance of compensation". Her 2,819-page report accused the regulators, i.e. the DTI, GAD, and FSA, of [...] "comprehensive failure", found the Government guilty of ten counts of maladminstration, {{and called for}} a compensation scheme [...] "to put those people who have suffered a relative loss back into the position that they would have been in, had <b>maladministration</b> not occurred". Equitable's chairman estimated that 30,000 policyholders had already died without receiving compensation. In December, the European Parliament issued a press release describing the regulatory failure as an outrage.|$|E
