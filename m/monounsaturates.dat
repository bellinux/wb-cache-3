This study tested the hypothesis that incremental supplementation of grazing primiparous Holstein-Friesian cows with CDCO will alter milk fatty acid composition towards increased total <b>monounsaturates.</b> Comparisons were made between unsupplemented grazing dairy cows and their peers on dietary supplements containing low (25 ml/Kg DM), medium (35 ml/Kg DM) or high levels (50 ml/kg DM) of CDCO in addition to ad libitum grazing access to pasture. There was no significant effect (p> 0. 05) of CDCO supplementation for eight weeks on the proportions of total polyunsaturated fatty acids (tPUFA), omega- 3 (w- 3) and omega- 6 (w- 6) fatty acids in milk.

The average number of recentlyextruded eggs was lowest in C. antarcticus with 163 eggs, and highest in Nematocarcinus lanceopes with 1, 220 eggs, while Notocrangonantarcticus produced on average 350 eggs. The lipid content (% of dry mass) of the eggs was 18. 8 % for C. antarcticus, 14. 3 % for Notocrangonantarcticus and 18. 1 % for Nematocarcinus lanceopes. Dominant lipid classes in eggs of all species were phospholipids and triacylglycerols. Thestorage lipid, triacylglycerol, was slightly elevated in the eggs of Nematocarcinus lanceopes (mean of 52. 7 %) {{compared to the other}} two species.

40|$|Abstract: The Olive tree (Olea europaea L.), {{a native}} of the Mediterranean basin and parts of Asia, is now widely {{cultivated}} in many {{other parts of the world}} for production of olive oil and table olives. Olive is a rich source of valuable nutrients and bioactives of medicinal and therapeutic interest. Olive fruit contains appreciable concentration, 1 – 3 % of fresh pulp weight, of hydrophilic (phenolic acids, phenolic alchohols, flavonoids and secoiridoids) and lipophilic (cresols) phenolic compounds that are known to possess multiple biological activities such as antioxidant, anticarcinogenic, antiinflammatory, antimicrobial, antihypertensive, antidyslipidemic, cardiotonic, laxative, and antiplatelet. Other important compounds present in olive fruit are pectin, organic acids, and pigments. Virgin olive oil (VOO), extracted mechanically from the fruit, is also very popular for its nutritive and health-promoting potential, especially against cardiovascular disorders due to the presence of high levels of <b>monounsaturates</b> and other valuable minor components such as phenolics, phytosterols, tocopherols, carotenoids, chlorophyll and squalene.

40|$|The {{fatty acid}} {{composition}} of membrane lipids varies systematically among species {{in a manner}} that is consistent with their metabolic rate and longevity. Because the susceptibility of fatty acids to peroxidation relates directly to their extent of unsaturation, it is possible to calculate a peroxidation index (PI) for membranes through characterization of their specific fatty acid composition.

Bird and mammal species with the same maximum life span also have membrane lipids with essentially the same PI. Exceptionally long-living mammals and birds usually have membrane lipids high in <b>monounsaturates,</b> but low in polyunsaturates, with the consequence that the PI of their membrane lipids is as low as expected for their respective longevity. Longevity variation within species (whether due to calorie-restriction, extended longevity associated with specific strains, queen-worker differences in honey bees or inherited longevity differences among humans) is also associated with differences in membrane composition and PI.
