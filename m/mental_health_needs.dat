25|$|Some {{people with}} {{developmental}} disabilities live in residential accommodation (also known as group homes) with other people with similar assessed needs. These homes are usually staffed around the clock, and usually house between 3 and 15 residents. The prevalence {{of this type of}} support is gradually decreasing, however, as residential accommodation is replaced by at-home and community support, which can offer increased choice and self-determination for individuals. Some U.S. states still provide institutional care, such as the Texas State Schools.

Methods: In a randomized controlled trial design, 257 workers of two research institutes participated. The intervention group (n = 129) received a targeted mindfulness-related training, followed by e-coaching. The total duration of the intervention was 6 months. Data on work engagement, <b>mental</b> <b>health,</b> <b>need</b> for recovery and mindfulness were collected using questionnaires at baseline and after 6 and 12 months follow-up. Effects were analyzed using linear mixed effect models. Results: There were no significant differences in work engagement, <b>mental</b> <b>health,</b> <b>need</b> for recovery and mindfulness between the intervention and control group after either 6 - or 12 -months follow-up. Additional analyses in mindfulness-related training compliance subgroups (high and low compliance versus the control group as a reference) and subgroups based on baseline work engagement scores showed no significant differences either.

40|$|As California {{implements}} the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) of 2010, it {{is important}} to examine the various types of insurance coverage and their association with <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> <b>need</b> and service utilization. Using data from the California Health Interview Survey (CHIS) 2011 - 2012, this current study compared the <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> <b>need</b> and service use of California adults with various insurance types. The findings revealed that respondents' various insurance types were differentially associated with their <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> <b>need</b> and service use. In citing reasons for not seeking treatment, the uninsured {{were more likely to be}} concerned about cost, and the Medicare & Others group was less likely to be concerned about cost than those with Privately Purchased insurance. The Employment-Based insurance group was significantly more likely than the Privately Purchased group to be "concerned about what would happen if someone found out". Further, both the uninsured and the Medicare & Others group were more likely to discontinue treatment compared to their Privately Purchased counterparts. The reasons for discontinuing treatment varied among the different insurance groups. The results suggest that the ACA will improve <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> by reducing concerns about cost reported by the uninsured.

The current study aimed to investigate the prevalence and nature of <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> <b>need</b> and associations with offending status {{in a sample of}} 12 - 17 year old community based offenders (N = 87). 	Based on existing research, it was hypothesised that the study sample would present with substantially greater need than has been found in normative samples of same-age young people with females presenting with greater needs than males. Prevalence rates and assessment/interpretive techniques vary greatly within studies. As such the current study aimed {{to assess the impact of}} three different interpretive parameters on calculations of prevalence. 	Information on <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> <b>need</b> was derived from screening data administered at the point of referral to community youth justice services and using a combination of structured tools and clinical judgement. Data was analysed using non-parametric methods through SPSS for Windows (15). 	Findings confirmed greater putative <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> <b>need</b> within the study sample largely characterised by sub-clinical depression. However, prevalence rates varied greatly depending on the interpretive parameter employed. Descriptive data suggested greater need within the female sub-sample although gender differences were not significant.

40|$|Abstract										 Background: This study {{examined}} the prevalence of reported <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> problems in <b>need</b> of treatment among Norwegian medical students. It also tried to identify the possible individual and environmental predictors associated with <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> problems in <b>need</b> of treatment among this group. Methods: Based on a longitudinal, nationwide questionnaire that was sent to all Norwegian medical students (N= 473) entering Norwegian medical schools in 1993 (T 1), and also three years (T 2) and six years (T 3) after enrolling. At each stage {{the number of students}} participating was higher than in the longitudinal sample and these numbers were used when finding the prevalence shown in the tables (cross-sectional sample). Data were analyzed using logistic regression. Results: The lifetime prevalence of <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> problems in <b>need</b> of treatment in the first undergraduate year was reported by 15 % (56). At T 2 33 % (112) reported experiencing <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> problems in <b>need</b> of treatment during their first three undergraduate years. Despite of reporting <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> problems in <b>need</b> of treatment, 54 % (61 / 112) of the third year medical students admitted not seeking professional help during this period of time. At T 3 28 % (105) reported <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> problems in <b>need</b> of treatment, with 16 % (56) experiencing this the preceding year. Adjusted predictors of <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> problems in <b>need</b> of treatment the first three undergraduate years were: Previous <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> problems (OR= 5. 6), negative life events during the last 12 months (OR= 2. 5) and the personality trait of extroversion (OR= 0. 8). Conclusion: This study shows that 1 / 3 of third year medical students reported having <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> problems in <b>need</b> of treatment during their first three undergraduate years, of which 1 / 2 had not sought professional help. Those experiencing <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> problems in <b>need</b> of treatment prior to starting medical school had a five-fold increased risk of developing similar problems during their first three undergraduate years. The impact of negative life events is more important than perceived medical school stress as to whether they experience <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> problems in <b>need</b> of treatment. An extroverted personality seems to be protective against developing <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> problems during the first three undergraduate years...|$|R
40|$|Abstract This {{study is}} the first to address the <b>need</b> for <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> care (MHC) and the {{patterns}} of utilization of MHC services among Unaccompanied Refugee Minors (URM). Information concerning the well being, <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> <b>need,</b> and utilization of services of URM was col-lected from three informants, the minors themselves (n = 920), their legal guardians (n = 557), and their teachers (n = 496). The well-being, need and utilization of MHC services of URM was compared with those of a representative Dutch adolescent sample (n = 1059). The findings of this study indicated that URM that report a <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> care <b>need</b> (57. 8 %) also report higher levels of emotional distress than Dutch adolescents who report a similar need for MHC (8. 2 %). In addition, guardians and teachers detect emotional distress and <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> care <b>needs</b> in only a small percentage (30 %) of URM. The referral of URM to <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> care services {{does not appear to be}} driven by the reported needs of the URM, but by the need and emotional distress as observed and perceived by guardians. This resulted in the fact that 48. 7 % of the URM total sample reported that their <b>need</b> for <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> care was unmet...|$|R

There is, however, limited evidence of <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> implications of working poverty, despite its representing a rapidly expanding segment of impoverished populations in many developed nations. In this study, we examined whether working poverty in Switzerland, a country with substantial recent growth among the working poor, was correlated with two dependent variables of interest: psychological <b>health</b> and unmet <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> <b>need.</b> Methods This cross-sectional study used data drawn from the first 3 waves (1999 – 2001) of the Swiss Household Panel, a nationally representative sample of the permanent resident population of Switzerland. The study sample comprised 5453 subjects aged 20 – 59 years. We used Generalized Estimating Equation models to investigate the {{association between}} working poverty and psychological well-being; we applied logistic regression models to analyze the link between working poverty and unmet <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> <b>need.</b> Working poverty was represented by dummy variables indicating financial deficiency, restricted standard of living, or both conditions.

40|$|Using {{data from}} the Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS) Cycle 1. 2, we examine the nature of unmet <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> care <b>needs</b> in Ontario, Canada and how this is {{associated}} with socio-demographic, social support, <b>health</b> status and <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> service use factors. Unmet <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> care <b>needs</b> result from experiencing barriers to three issues: acceptability, accessibility and availability. Unmet needs due to acceptability issues are the most frequent type; the largest proportion of people within this category report experiencing unmet needs because they "preferred to manage the problem themselves". Unmet needs are greater among the young and among females. Surprisingly, service users report higher rates of unmet needs than non-users. Some social support variables have associations with unmet needs. Based upon these results, unmet needs pose a major challenge {{to the health care}} system since they cannot be resolved solely by enhancing access to and availability of <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> services. Thus, to address unmet <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> care <b>needs,</b> efforts should be focused on the acceptability barriers that women and young people in particular face. Enhancing education and certain social support mechanisms are potential strategies.
