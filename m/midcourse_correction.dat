This was an advanced pulse-Doppler radar system with a maximum range against bomber-sized targets at about 120 mi, {{and was able to}} track eight targets at a time in its track while scan mode at up to 80 mi. The radar also broadcast <b>midcourse</b> <b>corrections</b> to the missiles, and was in charge of calculating their lofted trajectories. The 120 mi range of the AN/APQ-81 meant the Eagle could not be fired at its maximum effective range of 160 mi, but the Eagle also had a home-on-jam capability that allowed it to attack targets at its maximum range, although this was reduced in practice as it did not use <b>midcourse</b> <b>corrections</b> and flew directly at the target at lower altitudes.|$|R

40|$|Most {{quantitative}} {{studies of}} climate-change policy attempt {{to predict the}} greenhouse-gas reduction plan that will have the optimum balance of longterm costs and benefits. We find that the large uncertainties associated with the climate-change problem can make the policy prescriptions of this traditional approach unreliable. In this study, we construct a large uncertainty space that includes the possibility of large and/or abrupt climate changes and/or of technology breakthroughs that radically reduce projected abatement costs. We use computational experiments on a linked system of climate and economic models to compare {{the performance of a}} simple adaptive strategy [...] - one that can make <b>midcourse</b> <b>corrections</b> based on observations of the climate and economic systems [...] - and two commonly advocated best-estimate policies based ondifferent expectations about the long-term consequences of climate change. We find that the Do-a-Little and Emissions-Stabilization best-estimate policies perform well in therespective regions of the uncertainty space where their estimates are valid, but can fail severely in those regions where their estimates are wrong. In contrast, the adaptive strategy can make <b>midcourse</b> <b>corrections</b> and avoid significant errors. While its success is no surprise, the adaptive-strategy approach provides an analytic framework to examine important policy and research issues that will likely arise as society adapts to climate change, and which cannot be easily addressed in studies using best-estimate approaches. 1...|$|R

Both scientists and decision makers benefit from synthesis of this information, especially when coupled with chemical/physical information. Synthesized information is also more easily communicated to the general public, especially if the minutiae so fascinating to specialists are avoided. However, neither integration nor synthesis should be an afterthought, but should be incorporated into the original project design. A continual flow of information should be maintained during the data gathering stage so that <b>midcourse</b> <b>corrections</b> can be made when significant interactions are discovered.

50|$|The program {{performed}} {{several other}} services beyond its {{primary goal of}} demonstrating soft landings. The ability of spacecraft to make <b>midcourse</b> <b>corrections</b> was demonstrated, and the landers carried instruments to help evaluate the suitability of their landing sites for manned Apollo landings. Several Surveyor spacecraft had robotic shovels designed to test lunar soil mechanics. Before the Soviet Luna 9 mission (landing four months before Surveyor 1) and the Surveyor project, it was unknown how deep the dust on the Moon was. If the dust was too deep, then no astronaut could land. The Surveyor program proved that landings were possible. Some of the Surveyors also had alpha scattering instruments and magnets, which helped determine the chemical composition of the soil.|$|R
50|$|The {{fourth day}} saw the fourth planned <b>midcourse</b> <b>correction,</b> {{although}} {{it was only the}} second actually performed on the mission. The burn lasted 0.91 seconds, adding 5.4 ft/s (1.65 m/s) to their speed. The crew then put on their A7L space suits for the jettisoning of the SIM bay door. This door was jettisoned using explosive cord and there was a small risk that it could cause the spacecraft to depressurize. It was possible, in an emergency for the crew to spend the cruise back to Earth in their pressurized space suits.|$|E
50|$|The {{full report}} as {{submitted}} to U.S. Congress came under criticism from several people at NASA, noting that, although the cameras lacked redundancy, {{any one of}} dozens of failure modes in the booster or spacecraft could also result in failure to return any TV images. In regards to the lack of adequate prelaunch testing, they brought up the incident back in 1961 with Ranger 1 deploying its solar panels during a ground test and that ground tests with full 60 W power had been discontinued on the Block II probes for fear of accidentally igniting the <b>midcourse</b> <b>correction</b> engine on the pad and destroying the entire launch vehicle in the process.|$|E

The warmup period for the TV cameras would be performed earlier and made shorter than on Ranger 6. Out of fear of jeopardizing the mission, ground controllers decided that the probe's orientation was acceptable enough and they would not risk maneuvering with the attitude control thrusters to get into a better angle.

40|$|The {{development}} of the Viking 75 Orbiter propulsion subsystem has been completed and qualification is under way. This development required {{an extension of the}} Mariner Mars 1971 propulsion subsystem technology to meet the Viking 75 requirements of three times the burn time and five times the number of burns. Modifications have been incorporated into the rocket engine to increase the cooling margin for the 2700 -second Mars orbit insertion burn. This capability has been demonstrated in both engine firings and subsystem tests. A new surface tension device has been developed to position the propellants (N 2 O 4 and MMH) over the tank outlets during zero-g flight. Extensive scale model testing has been conducted to prove this propellant management concept.

40|$|The {{evaluation}} of systemic educational reforms entails {{a paradigm shift}} among evaluators who must change the lens through which {{they look at the}} reforms.

Systemic reforms include intended and unintended outcomes and the actual outcomes that result. Outcomes of educational reform can also be organized in terms of whether they result from top-down or bottom-up approaches. A research approach to measuring reform outcomes will be more methodologically sound if the variables of interest are measured in multiple ways. By comparing findings using multiple qualitative and quantitative data collection strategies, evaluators can identify trends and lead reformers to <b>midcourse</b> <b>corrections</b> when needed.

40|$|New high-performance, carbon-fiber {{reinforced}} polymer material allows {{additive manufacturing}} to produce pressure vessels capable of high pressures (thousands of {{pounds per square}} inch). This advancement in turn allows integral hybrid propulsion which is revolutionary for both CubeSats and additively-manufactured spacecraft. Hybrid propulsion offers simplicity as compared to bipropellant liquid propulsion, significantly better safety compared to solid or monopropellant hydrazine propulsion, and much better performance than cold-gas or hydrogen peroxide monopropellant propulsion. The safety benefits are especially important for CubeSats because they are generally secondary payloads whose impact on primary payload operations must be minimized. The possibility of safe, highperformance, high thrust propulsion opens up a huge variety of possible mission scenarios previously unavailable to CubeSat spacecraft. In addition, a “printed in” cold gas attitude control system that draws its propellant from the main thruster’s oxidizer tank allows spacecraft pointing, <b>midcourse</b> <b>corrections,</b> and proximity operations with little reduction to the available spacecraft volume.

40|$|A {{letter report}} {{issued by the}} Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "DHS has generally relied on workforce data and has not regularly included employee input from available sources to identify "triggers," the term EEOC uses for indicators of potential barriers. GAO's analysis of DHS's MD- 715 reports showed that DHS generally relied on workforce data to identify 13 of 15 triggers, such as promotion and separation rates. According to EEOC, in addition to workforce data, agencies are to regularly consult a variety of sources, such as exit interviews, employee groups, and employee surveys, to identify triggers. Involving employees helps to incorporate insights about operations from a frontline perspective in determining where potential barriers exist. DHS does not consider employee input from such sources as employee groups, exit interviews, and employee surveys in conducting its MD- 715 analysis. Data from the governmentwide employee survey and DHS's internal employee survey are available, but DHS does not use these data to identify triggers. By not considering employee input on DHS personnel policies and practices, DHS is missing opportunities to identify potential barriers. Once a trigger is revealed, agencies are to investigate and pinpoint actual barriers and their causes. In 2007, through its departmentwide barrier analysis, DHS identified four barriers: (1) overreliance on the Internet to recruit applicants, (2) overreliance on noncompetitive hiring authorities, (3) lack of recruitment initiatives that were directed at Hispanics in several components, and (4) nondiverse interview panels. GAO's analysis of DHS's 2007 and 2008 MD- 715 reports showed that DHS has articulated planned activities to address identified barriers, has modified nearly all of its original target completion dates by a range of 12 to 21 months, and has not completed any planned activities; although officials reported completing other activities in fiscal year 2007 and 2008 associated with its EEO program. Nearly half of the planned activities involve collaboration between the civil rights and human capital offices. DHS said that it modified the dates because of staffing shortages. In {{order to ensure that}} agency programs are effectively and efficiently implemented, it is important for agencies to implement internal control activities, such as establishing and tracking implementation goals with timelines. This allows agencies to pinpoint performance shortfalls and gaps and suggest <b>midcourse</b> <b>corrections.</b> DHS has not developed project plans with milestones beyond what is included in its MD- 715 report and its Human Capital Strategic Plan.

40|$|Urea {{formaldehyde}} {{foam insulation}} in homes has caused increasing {{concerns about the}} adverse health effects associated with residential exposure to formaldehyde emissions. These health effects cover {{a broad spectrum of}} symptoms, including neurophysiological effects, respiratory irritations, and eye and skin irritations. Recent studies have also suggested a possible correlation between exposure to formaldehyde vapors and cancer. In 1979, following hundreds of complaints of adverse health effects from occupants of dwellings insulated with urea formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI), the Massachusetts Department of Public Health issued regulations banning the new installation of UFFI in Massachusetts. New State legislation was adopted in 1986 which reformulated UFFI policy. The law established a minimum concentration of formaldehyde of 0. 1 parts per million (ppm) below which removal of the insulation is not required or encouraged. A trust fund financed by industry was established to pay for air testing and for the removal of UFFI from homes if the formaldehyde level exceeds the statutory minimum of 0. 1 ppm or if an occupant experiences adverse health effects attributable to the insulation. Based on the Massachusetts experience, these requirements have been identified: the need for flexibility and <b>midcourse</b> <b>corrections</b> in the development of health policy to allow for the incorporation of new scientific information or changes in the economic or political environment, the need for close coordination with all affected parties, and the need for scientific and technical policy development to be joined with economic and political perspectives to ensure smooth implementation of health policies...|$|R
