2500|$|One round {{passed between}} Kemp's {{shoulder}} and head upon which Kemp stated he wet himself although {{on another occasion}} he later claimed {{this may have been}} due to a split water pouch. Kemp [...] "went straight down, cutting <b>my</b> <b>face</b> <b>as</b> I hit the ground." [...] The crew were pinned down by accurate fire from AK-47s and rocket-propelled grenades (RPGs), with five to seven RPGs flying over their heads by just a metre and bullets passing inches from their heads and hitting the ground either side of them. It was speculated that a sniper had targeted Kemp possibly because they knew they were journalists, or because their blue protective clothing looked unusual, and the camera may have looked like a weapon. The crew were pinned down for [...] "about seven to ten minutes" [...] with return fire commencing after [...] "three or four minutes" [...] after the soldiers had got into cover. Only after fierce return fire and a delay of three or four minutes could the crew be extracted.|$|E
60|$|He twisted <b>my</b> <b>face</b> <b>as</b> far as {{it would}} go and then stood looking at it.|$|E
60|$|He {{picked the}} masks {{off the floor}} and looked in <b>my</b> <b>face</b> <b>as</b> simply as a child.|$|E
60|$|Benjamin {{looked a}} little sadly at <b>my</b> flushed <b>face</b> <b>as</b> we drove to Major Fitz-David's house.|$|R
60|$|ASHER. Certainly. But {{one thing}} I set <b>my</b> <b>face</b> against <b>as</b> {{a matter of}} principle, I won't {{recognize}} the unions.|$|R
60|$|It was {{a fearful}} cry--doubly fearful {{on a ship}} {{hundreds}} of miles from land--and <b>my</b> <b>face</b> blanched <b>as</b> I sprang to my feet.|$|R
60|$|A tear {{dropped on}} <b>my</b> <b>face</b> <b>as</b> she kissed me. The door closed between us. The dark street {{received}} me.|$|E
60|$|The hysterical passion swelled in her bosom--her quickened convulsive {{breathing}} almost beat on <b>my</b> <b>face,</b> <b>as</b> {{she held}} me {{back at the}} door.|$|E
60|$|I remember, too, that as {{he talked}} I would find my aunt {{watching}} <b>my</b> <b>face</b> <b>as</b> if to check the soundness of his talk by my expression.|$|E
60|$|The {{corners of}} the Sergeant's melancholy mouth curled up, and he looked hard in <b>my</b> <b>face,</b> just <b>as</b> he had looked in the garden.|$|R
60|$|I {{felt that}} <b>my</b> <b>face</b> was <b>as</b> red as scarlet, and I fancied {{everybody}} {{was looking at}} me, while Herman Mordaunt took on himself the office of making a reply.|$|R

6000|$|... "Well, I mean to <b>my</b> <b>face,</b> <b>as</b> you do," [...] {{she went}} on, {{allowing}} {{herself to be}} further lured into a conversation that intention had rigorously forbidden.|$|E
6000|$|Slowly, at last, {{he moved}} his eyes from <b>my</b> <b>face,</b> <b>as</b> if he were waking from a vision, and cast them round the room. Then he said, in a low voice: ...|$|E
6000|$|Her terror still upon her, {{she glanced}} upwards {{to see what}} fresh enemy was this, and then, at sight of <b>my</b> <b>face,</b> <b>as</b> my arms closed about her, and held her safe-- ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I don't like to {{tell you}} his name, for, though 'tis night, that covers all shame-facedness, <b>my</b> <b>face</b> is <b>as</b> hot as a 'Talian iron, I declare! Do you just feel it.' ...|$|R
60|$|He {{even went}} so far as to snatch his holy wig from his head and throw it in <b>my</b> <b>face,</b> so <b>as</b> to blind me for a moment while he thrust at my {{unprotected}} breast.|$|R
60|$|I {{took a step}} forward, {{but before}} I could gain the threshold, the door was slammed in <b>my</b> <b>face,</b> and <b>as</b> I stood there, quivering with anger and disappointment, I heard the bolts being shot within.|$|R
6000|$|... "Stand more {{in front}} of me, Mildred," [...] he answered, angrily. [...] "More before <b>my</b> <b>face,</b> <b>as</b> becomes one who don't know her duty to her parent, and needs be taught it." ...|$|E
60|$|Mrs Fyne was {{disappointed}} by the optimistic turn of my sagacity. She rested her eyes on <b>my</b> <b>face</b> <b>as</b> though in doubt whether I had enough femininity in my composition to understand the case.|$|E
60|$|My {{guardian}} {{had come}} home and was standing thoughtfully by the dark window. When I went in, his face cleared {{and he came to}} his seat, but he caught the light upon <b>my</b> <b>face</b> <b>as</b> I took mine.|$|E
60|$|In {{another moment}} a quick step was {{heard on the}} stair, and a {{stranger}} burst into the room, shut the door in <b>my</b> landlady's <b>face</b> <b>as</b> she followed him, and locked it.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Elfride, we must bid {{good-bye to}} compliment,' said Knight: 'we must do without politeness now. Look in <b>my</b> <b>face,</b> and <b>as</b> {{you believe in}} God above, tell me truly one thing more. Were you away alone with him?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'How can I, with <b>my</b> <b>face</b> swollen <b>as</b> it is now? Besides, {{what would}} be the good? What can I say to her? I know well enough {{what she has to say}} to me, without {{listening}} to it.' ...|$|R
6000|$|She {{held out}} her hand rather coldly, scrutinising <b>my</b> <b>face</b> <b>as</b> she did so. I prepared, with a new-won grace, to walk by her side. [...] "Egbert," [...] she said, {{standing}} still, and thought. Then she looked at me.|$|E
60|$|He {{looked at}} me before he proceeded: indeed, he seemed leisurely to read <b>my</b> <b>face,</b> <b>as</b> if its {{features}} and lines were characters on a page. The conclusions drawn from this scrutiny he partially expressed in his succeeding observations.|$|E
60|$|Presently {{he stopped}} and {{released}} me, standing {{between me and the}} way we had come, looking up into <b>my</b> <b>face</b> <b>as</b> though to ask if I would now follow him voluntarily or if he must still resort to force.|$|E
6000|$|It {{may be the}} {{gathering}} gloom of evening, {{or it may be}} the darker gloom within herself, but a shade is on <b>my</b> Lady's <b>face,</b> <b>as</b> if she thought, [...] "I would he were!" ...|$|R
60|$|The guess came so {{near the}} truth, I could not prevent a suddenly-rising warmth in <b>my</b> <b>face</b> from {{revealing}} <b>as</b> much.|$|R
6000|$|... "I will" [...] (said he) and {{instantly}} fetching a deep sigh, Expired--. Sophia immediately sank again into a swoon--. MY greif was more audible. My Voice faltered, My Eyes assumed a vacant stare, <b>my</b> <b>face</b> became <b>as</b> pale as Death, and my senses were considerably impaired--.|$|R
6000|$|Then I {{turned and}} hid <b>my</b> <b>face,</b> <b>as</b> {{did all the}} white folk. Presently I heard the old man, whom they had saved to the last that he might witness the deaths of his descendants, cry in a loud voice: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Hold," [...] said he, [...] "let {{it go to}} Rome; {{let them}} {{see what kind of}} looking fellow I am. Perhaps the prince and his friends may form as good an opinion of me from <b>my</b> <b>face</b> <b>as</b> you have done." ...|$|E
6000|$|He {{looked up}} the street, and down the street, and rubbed his chin timidly; and then said, glancing in <b>my</b> <b>face</b> <b>as</b> if a light had broken on his mind, yet with a humble appeal to my {{forbearance}} that was perfectly irresistible: ...|$|E
60|$|<b>My</b> <b>face</b> grew cold <b>as</b> I {{felt the}} blood leave it. At that moment mention of George Wright fixed once {{for all my}} hate of him.|$|R
6000|$|Then {{suddenly}} he {{gathered up the}} warm ashes in a double handful and threw them into <b>my</b> <b>face,</b> muttering something <b>as</b> he did so and adding aloud, ...|$|R
