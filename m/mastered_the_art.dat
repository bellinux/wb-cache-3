5|$|The Ottomans {{had great}} {{diplomatic}} skill {{and ability to}} raise vast numbers of troops. Initially, their raiding gave them great support from other Turks near Osman's small domain. In time however, as the Turks began to settle in land poorly defended by the Byzantines, {{they were able to}} exploit the hardships of the peasant classes by recruiting their aid. Those that did not assist the Ottomans were raided themselves. Eventually, the cities in Asia Minor, cut off from the outside surrendered and the Ottomans soon <b>mastered</b> <b>the</b> <b>art</b> of siege warfare.|$|E
5|$|Rimsky-Korsakov {{eventually}} became an excellent {{teacher and a}} fervent believer in academic training. He revised everything he had composed prior to 1874, even acclaimed works such as Sadko and Antar, {{in a search for}} perfection that would remain with him throughout the rest of his life. Assigned to rehearse the Orchestra Class, he <b>mastered</b> <b>the</b> <b>art</b> of conducting. Dealing with orchestral textures as a conductor, and making suitable arrangements of musical works for the Orchestra Class, led to an increased interest in the art of orchestration, an area into which he would further indulge his studies as Inspector of Navy Bands. The score of his Third Symphony, written just after he had completed his three-year program of self-improvement, reflects his hands-on experience with the orchestra.|$|E

25|$|Around 1.8 {{million years}} ago, Homo ergaster first {{appeared}} in the fossil record in Africa. From Homo ergaster, Homo erectus evolved 1.5 million years ago. Some of the earlier representatives of this species were still fairly small-brained and used primitive stone tools, much like H. habilis. The brain later grew in size, and H. erectus eventually developed a more complex stone tool technology called the Acheulean. Possibly the first hunters, H. erectus <b>mastered</b> <b>the</b> <b>art</b> of making fire and was the first hominid to leave Africa, colonizing most of Afro-Eurasia and perhaps later giving rise to Homo floresiensis. Although some recent writers suggest that Homo georgicus was the first and most primitive hominid ever to live outside Africa, many scientists consider H. georgicus to be an early and primitive member of the H. erectus species.|$|E
25|$|In {{contrast}} to the indigenous Indian architecture which was of the trabeate order, i.e. all spaces were spanned by means of horizontal beams, the Islamic architecture was arcuate, i.e. an arch or dome was adopted {{as a method of}} bridging a space. The concept of arch or dome was not invented by the Muslims but was, in fact, borrowed and further perfected by them from the architectural styles of the post-Roman period. Muslims used a cementing agent in the form of mortar {{for the first time in}} the construction of buildings in India. They further put to use certain scientific and mechanical formulae, which were derived by experience of other civilisations, in their constructions in India. Such use of scientific principles helped not only in obtaining greater strength and stability of the construction materials but also provided greater flexibility to the architects and builders. One fact that must be stressed here is that, the Islamic elements of architecture had already passed through different experimental phases in other countries like Egypt, Iran and Iraq before these were introduced in India. Unlike most Islamic monuments in these countries, which were largely constructed in brick, plaster and rubble, the Indo-Islamic monuments were typical mortar-masonry works formed of dressed stones. It must be emphasized that the development of the Indo-Islamic architecture was greatly facilitated by the knowledge and skill possessed by the Indian craftsmen, who had <b>mastered</b> <b>the</b> <b>art</b> of stonework for centuries and used their experience while constructing Islamic monuments in India.|$|E

The war effort and getting supplies to the troops were under the purview of Congress, but Washington pressured the Congress to provide the essentials. In June 1776, Congress' first attempt at running the war effort was established with the committee known as [...] "Board of War and Ordnance", succeeded by the Board of War in July 1777, a committee which eventually included members of the military. The command structure of the armed forces was a hodgepodge of Congressional appointees (and Congress sometimes made those appointments without Washington's input) with state-appointments filling the lower ranks. The results of his general staff were mixed, as some of his favorites (such as John Sullivan) never <b>mastered</b> <b>the</b> <b>art</b> of command.|$|E
500|$|Although this hunter was sharing meat, he was {{not doing}} so in the {{framework}} of reciprocity. The general model of costly signalling is not reciprocal; rather, individuals who share acquire more mates and allies. Costly signalling applies to situations in Kalahari foraging groups where giving often goes to recipients who have little to offer in return. A young hunter is motivated to impress community members with daughters so that he can obtain his first wife. Older hunters may wish to attract women interested in an extramarital relationship, or to be a [...] In these northern Kalahari groups, the killing of a large animal indicates a man who has <b>mastered</b> <b>the</b> <b>art</b> of hunting and can support a family. Generally, many women seek a man who is a good hunter, has an agreeable character, is generous, and has advantageous social ties. Since hunting ability is a prerequisite for marriage, men who are good hunters enter the marriage market earliest. Costly signalling theory explains seemingly wasteful foraging displays.|$|E

Neither incarnation played to Francis’s strengths as an actress." [...] Omar White-Nobles of TVSource wrote: [...] "Genevieve was determined to bring down her crime lord husband Colin (Tristan Rogers) and attempt to reconcile with her son. Unfortunately for Francis, playing a vengeful ice queen turned shrewd businesswoman didn’t work for the audience. Subsequent attempts to soften the character failed as well, leaving aborted pairings with Jack Abbott (Peter Bergman) and Victor Newman (Eric Braeden)." ...|$|E

500|$|According to Brihadaranyaka Upanishad, King Janaka of Videha Kingdom held a Rajasuya Yagna {{and invited}} all the learned sages, kings and princess of India to participate. The yagna lasted for many days. Large {{quantities}} of sandalwood, ghee (clarified butter) and barley (cereal grain) were {{offered to the}} Yagna fire creating an atmosphere of spiritual sanctity and aroma. Janaka himself being a scholar {{was impressed with the}} large gathering of learned sages. He thought of selecting a scholar from the assembled group of elite scholars, the most accomplished of them all who had maximum knowledge about Brahman. For this purpose, he evolved a plan and offered a prize of 1,000 cows with each cow dangled with 10 grams of gold on its horns. The galaxy of scholars, apart from others, included the renowned sage Yajnavalkya and Gargi Vachaknavi. Yajnavalkya, who was aware that he was the most spiritually knowledgeable among the assembled gathering, as he had <b>mastered</b> <b>the</b> <b>art</b> of Kundalini Yoga, ordered his disciple Samsrava to drive away the cow herd to his house.

He hated the characters within the first five minutes of the film and found himself wishing that the film had shown more of the bear just walking in the woods rather than the characters talking with one another between the attacks.

[...] The characters actually asking what a bear was doing in the Canadian wilderness, where bears are plentiful, amused him, though he notes that it was probably not the intended reaction for the scene. His final rating of the film was an [...] "F." [...] DVD Verdict's David Johnson also questioned why the bear and actors are never seen on screen together.

[...] He also wondered at the lack of fake blood or props being used during attacks rather than [...] "ridiculous blood splatter computer graphics tossed on the screen."
