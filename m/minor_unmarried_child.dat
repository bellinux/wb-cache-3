50|$|The {{abolition}} of the National Origins quota system came with the Hart-Celler Act of 1965. This legislation placed a heavy emphasis on family reunification, designating 74% of visas for that purpose. There was no limit on spouses, <b>unmarried</b> <b>minor</b> <b>children,</b> and parents of U.S. citizens. The percentages for family reunification were as follows: <b>Unmarried</b> adult <b>children</b> of U.S. citizens (20%), spouses and <b>unmarried</b> <b>children</b> of permanent residents aliens (20%), married children of U.S. citizens (10%), brothers and sisters of U.S. citizens over age 21 (24%). These new visa preferences created a swell of new chain migration and immigration in general. The Third World began to outpace European immigration to America {{for the first time}} in history, surpassing it by the end of the 1960s and doubling the numbers of European migration by the end of the 1970s.|$|R

[...] It allows permanent residents to achieve family unity with their spouses and children while the immigration process takes its course. [...] It {{was created by the}} Legal Immigration Family Equity Act of 2000. The Act is to relieve those who applied for immigrant visas on or before December 21, 2000. Practically, the V visa is currently not available to spouses and minor children of LPRs who have applied after December 21, 2000.|$|R
25|$|The United States {{immigration}} {{system provides}} channels for legal, permanent economic immigration, especially for high-skilled workers. For low-skilled workers, temporary or seasonal legal immigration {{is easier to}} acquire. The United States immigration system rests on three pillars: family reunification, provision of scarce labor (as in agricultural and specific high-skilled worker sectors), and protecting American workers from competition with foreign workers. The current system sets an overall limit of 675,000 permanent immigrants each year; this limit {{does not apply to}} spouses, <b>unmarried</b> <b>minor</b> <b>children</b> or parents of U.S. citizens. Outside of this number for permanent immigrants, 480,000 visas are allotted for those under the family-preference rules and 140,000 are allocated for employment-related preferences. The current system and low number of visas available make it difficult for low-skilled workers to legally and permanently enter the country to work, so illegal entry becomes the way immigrants respond to the lure of jobs with higher wages than what {{they would be able to}} find in their current country.|$|R

Non-quota status was accorded to: wives and <b>unmarried</b> <b>children</b> under 18 of U.S. citizens; natives of Western Hemisphere countries, with their families; non-immigrants; and certain others. Subsequent amendments eliminated certain elements of this law's inherent discrimination against women.|$|R
