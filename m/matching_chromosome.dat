50|$|Chromosomal {{crossover}} (or crossing over) is {{the exchange}} of genetic material between homologous chromosomes that results in recombinant chromosomes during sexual reproduction. It {{is one of the}} final phases of genetic recombination, which occurs in the pachytene stage of prophase I of meiosis during a process called synapsis.

50|$|Structurally, hepaCAM is a {{glycoprotein}} containing an extracellular domain with 2 Ig-like loops, a transmembrane {{region and}} a cytoplasmic domain. <b>Matched</b> to <b>chromosome</b> 11q24, gene hepaCAM is ubiquitously expressed in normal human tissues, with particularly high expression {{levels in the}} central nervous system (CNS), and is frequently suppressed in a variety of tumour types.

In cell signaling, hepaCAM directly interacts with F-actin and calveolin 1, and is capable of inducing senescence-like growth arrest via a p53/p21-dependent pathway. Moreover, hepaCAM is proteolystically cleaved near the transmemberane region. These findings indicate that the new Ig-like cell adhesion molecule hepaCAM is also a tumour suppressor.|$|R

Almost all human cytogenetic studies involve the examination of dividing bloodcell population by blocking cell division at metaphase with subsequent processing and staining bybanding techniques. The chromosome constitution is described as Karyotype that states the totalnumber of chromosomes and the sex chromosome constitution. Karyotypes are prepared by cuttingup a photograph of the spread metaphase <b>chromosomes,</b> <b>matching</b> up homologous <b>chromosomes</b> andsticking them back down on a card or nowadays more often by getting an image analysis computerto do the job.

40|$|Sexual {{reproduction}} and genetic exchange via meiosis {{are important and}} highly conserved processes in many living organisms. Occasionally, complications occur during meiosis that can result in chromosome abnormalities. In humans, improper chromosome development can cause life altering disorders such as Down Syndrome, Edwards Syndrome, and Patau Syndrome. Unfortunately, despite its importance, gaps remain in our knowledge of how this process works. For instance, {{little is known about}} how homolog identification occurs and what proteins identify <b>matching</b> <b>chromosomes</b> during pairing. This fundamental process occurs early during meiosis and ensures proper development of gametes. Understanding the proteins involved during homolog pairing may be possible by studying a process called meiotic silencing by unpaired DNA (MSUD) in the eukaryotic fungus, Neurospora crassa. During MSUD, unpaired regions (or regions that do not match during homolog identification) are thought to produce special RNA molecules. Discovery of these molecules should help elucidate how unpaired DNA is identified. This is because {{it is possible that the}} proteins involved in identifying unpaired regions in MSUD are the same proteins that identify homologs in meiosis. Furthermore, these proteins could contribute to homology searches required for DNA repair, which could contribute in the development of cancer research. To gain a complete understanding of unpaired DNA detection, the Neurospora crassa transcriptome must be identified. The transcriptome represents all the RNA molecules found within an organism at a certain point in time or stage of development. Knowledge of the transcriptome can be used in efforts towards identifying the theoretical RNA molecules of MSUD. The meiotic transcriptome can be determined by performing an RNA-seq analysis on all the RNA transcripts produced during meiosis. These RNA are then aligned to the N. crassa genome. Then, a special algorithm is used to identify key regions of the genome that may prove particularly useful in MSUD research (i. e. transcriptionally quiescent regions). Given the sheer size of the data sets required for identifying these regions, the algorithm must be time and memory efficient due to computational constraints...|$|R
5000|$|Crossovers {{typically}} {{occur between}} homologous regions of <b>matching</b> <b>chromosomes,</b> but similarities in sequence {{and other factors}} can result in mismatched alignments. Most DNA is composed of base pair sequences repeated very large numbers of times. These repetitious segments, {{often referred to as}} satellites, are fairly homogenous among a species. During DNA replication, each strand of DNA is used as a template for the creation of new strands using a partially-conserved mechanism; proper functioning of this process results in two identical, paired chromosomes, often called sisters. Sister chromatid crossover events are known to occur at a rate of several crossover events per cell per division in eukaryotes. [...] Most of these events involve an exchange of equal amounts of genetic information, but unequal exchanges may occur due to sequence mismatch. These are referred to by a variety of names, including non-homologous crossover, unequal crossover, and unbalanced recombination, and result in an insertion or deletion of genetic information into the chromosome. While rare compared to homologous crossover events, these mutations are drastic, affecting many loci at the same time. They are considered the main driver behind the generation of gene duplications and are a general source of mutation within the genome.The specific causes of non-homologous crossover events are unknown, but several influential factors are known to increase the likelihood of an unequal crossover. One common vector leading to unbalanced recombination is the repair of double-strand breaks (DSBs). DSBs are often repaired using non-homologous end joining, a process which involves invasion of a template strand by the DSB strand (see figure below). Nearby homologous regions of the template strand are often used for repair, which can give rise to either insertions or deletions in the genome if a non-homologous but complementary part of the template strand is used. Sequence similarity is a major player in crossover - crossover events are more likely to occur in long regions of close identity on a gene. This means that any section of the genome with long sections of repetitive DNA is prone to crossover events.|$|R

BCD is a rare monogenic autosomal recessively inherited disorder characterized {{by the presence of}} crystals in the retina and retinal pigment epithelium atrophy. Mutations in the CYP 4 V 2 gene {{have been found to be}} causative for BCD. METHODS: Ophthalmic examinations were carried out in the affected individuals. Peripheral blood samples were collected and genomic DNA was extracted. All exons and flanking intronic regions of the CYP 4 V 2 gene were amplified with polymerase chain reaction and screened for mutations by direct DNA sequencing. One hundred control chromosomes were also screened to exclude nonpathogenic polymorphisms. RESULTS: Fundus examination revealed the presence of tiny yellowish-sparkling crystals at the posterior pole of the fundus and atrophy of the retinal pigment epithelium in all patients. Choroid neovascularization was noted in one patient. Five different CYP 4 V 2 mutations were identified, including two missense mutations (p. F 73 L, p.

A microsatellite scan of the X chromosome established significant linkage to several markers including DXS 993 (Zmax = 3. 16; Î¸ = 0. 05). Extended haplotype analysis refined the linkage region to a 1. 43 -Mb interval flanked by markers DXS 7110 and DXS 8027. Whole exome sequencing identified a missense mutation c. G 473 A (p.

The change localized within the 1. 43 -Mb linkage interval, segregated with the affected phenotype and was excluded in ethnically <b>matched</b> control <b>chromosomes.</b> PDK 3 is one of the four isoenzymes regulating the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC), by reversible phosphorylation, and is a nuclear-coded protein located in the mitochondrial matrix. PDC catalyzes the oxidative decarboxylation of pyruvate to acetyl CoA and is a key enzyme linking glycolysis to the energy-producing Krebs cycle and lipogenic pathways.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this project is to better {{understand}} the influences underlying gender differences in the brain using Four Core Genotype mice. Four Core Genotype mice are transgenic mice in which the SRY gene has been translocated from the Y chromosome to another location. This enables separation of the genetic sex and gonadal sex. For example, there are female mice based on sexual organs but their chromosomes are XY(UY- in mice). This allows us to determine whether sexual differentiation in the brain is due to genes or hormones. In this project, I looked at a sexually dimorphic area of the brain, the Bed Nucleus of the Stria Terminalis (BNST), which is twice as large in males than in females. I hypothesize that both chromosomes and gonadal hormones play a part in sexually differentiating the brain including the BNST and thus I predict that the size of the BNST will be the same in XX males (UUSRY) and XY females (UY-). I measured the BNST from five XX female (UU) and five XY male(UY-SRY) four core genotype mouse brains and confirmed that the BNST is larger in males than in females, as it is in normal mice (p=. 057). I processed and measured the size of the BNST in ten brains of XX males and XY females to see if the size of the BNST <b>matches</b> the <b>chromosomes</b> or the gonads.

The previous studies located the gene Yr 17 on the translocation of 2 NS- 2 AS using the molecular and cytological markers. In the present study, we screened new PCR-based markers {{to map the}} gene Yr 17 region from the investigation of a segregating 120 F 2 population. All markers including four EST-PCR markers, a SCAR (sequence characterized amplified region) and a PLUG (PCR based landmark unique gene) marker specific to Yr 17 gene were mapped on the chromosome 2 AS, and located on the chromosomal deletion bin 2 AS 5 - 0. 8 â€“ 1. 00 region. Based on the wheat-rice collinearity, {{we found that the}} sequences of the Yr 17 gene linked markers were comparatively <b>matched</b> at rice <b>chromosome</b> 4 and chromosome 7. However, the identified closely linked genomic sequence of Yr 17 gene is most likely collinear with genomic region of rice chromosome 4. The newly produced PCR based markers closely linked to Yr 17 gene will be useful for the marker-assisted selection in wheat breeding for rust resistance...|$|R
40|$|In {{an attempt}} to {{investigate}} the X chromosome harboring putative tumor suppressor genes (TSGs) in sporadic breast carcinoma, we performed loss of heterozygosity (LOH) studies on 23 breast carcinomas using 15 polymorphic markers covering the whole X <b>chromosomes.</b> <b>Matched</b> DNA extracted from tumor samples and corresponding normal tissues were analyzed by polymerase chain reactions (PCR) using microsatellite markers. In 10 cases (43. 5 %), LOH was detected for at least 1 of the 15 polymorphic markers of the X chromosome tested. Four cases carried a LOH at Xp, and three cases LOH on Xp and Xq. Three cases carried a LOH Xq. Percentage of LOH was relatively high in DXS 987 (26. 7 %), DXS 999 (30. 0 %), HPRT(21. 4 %), DXS 1062 (23. 1 %) loci. Common regions of deletions were found on Xp 22. 2 -p 22. 13 (30 % of LOH) measuring about 4. 5 Mb and Xq 26. 1 -q 27. 1 (23. 1 % of LOH) measuring 10 Mb. The deleted allele was an active copy of the X chromosome. The results indicate the TSGs on the X chromosome are involved in breast cancer...|$|R
40|$|SummaryChromosome {{segregation}} {{relies on}} the dynamic properties of spindle microtubules (MTs). Poleward MT flux contributes to spindle dynamics through the disassembly of MT minus ends at spindle poles coupled to the continuous poleward transport of spindle MTs [1, 2]. Despite being conserved in metazoan cells, the function of flux remains controversial because flux rates differ widely in different cell types. In meiotic systems, the rate of flux nearly <b>matches</b> that of <b>chromosome</b> movement [3 â€“ 5], but in mitotic systems, flux is significantly slower than chromosome movement [6 â€“ 8]. Here, we show that spindles in human mitotic cells depleted of the kinesin- 13 proteins Kif 2 a and MCAK lack detectable flux and that such cells frequently fail to segregate all chromosomes appropriately at anaphase. Elimination of flux reduces poleward chromosome velocity âˆ¼ 20 %, but does not hinder bipolar spindle assembly, chromosome alignment, or mitotic progression. Thus, mitosis proceeds efficiently in human cells lacking detectable poleward MT flux. These data demonstrate that in human cultured cells, kinetochores are sufficient to effectively power chromosome movement, leading us to speculate that flux is maintained in these cells to fulfill other functional roles such as error correction or kinetochore regulation...|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} {{performed}} to investigate the genetic determinants of autosomal recessive congenital cataracts in large consanguineous families. Affected individuals underwent a detailed ophthalmological examination and slit-lamp photographs of the cataractous lenses were obtained. An aliquot of blood was collected from all participating family members and genomic DNA was extracted from white blood cells. Initially, a genome-wide scan was performed with genomic DNAs of family PKCC 025 followed by exclusion analysis of our familial cohort of congenital cataracts. Protein-coding exons of CRYBB 1, CRYBB 2, CRYBB 3, and CRYBA 4 were sequenced bidirectionally. A haplotype was constructed with SNPs flanking the causal mutation for affected individuals in all four families, while {{the probability that the}} four familial cases have a common founder was estimated using EM and CHM-based algorithms. The expression of Crybb 3 in the developing murine lens was investigated using TaqMan assays. The clinical and ophthalmological examinations suggested that all affected individuals had nuclear cataracts. Genome-wide linkage analysis localized the causal phenotype in family PKCC 025 to chromosome 22 q with statistically significant two-point logarithm of odds (LOD) scores. Subsequently, we localized three additional families, PKCC 063, PKCC 131, and PKCC 168 to chromosome 22 q. Bidirectional Sanger sequencing identified a missense variation: c. 493 G>C (p. Gly 165 Arg) in CRYBB 3 that segregated with the disease phenotype in all four familial cases. This variation was not found in ethnically <b>matched</b> control <b>chromosomes,</b> the NHLBI exome variant server, or the 1000 Genomes or dbSNP databases. Interestingly, all four families harbor a unique disease haplotype that strongly suggests a common founder of the causal mutation (p< 1. 64 E- 10). We observed expression of Crybb 3 in the mouse lens as early as embryonic day 15 (E 15), and expression remained relatively steady throughout development. Here, we report a common ancestral mutation in CRYBB 3 associated with autosomal recessive congenital cataracts identified in four familial cases of Pakistani origin...|$|R
40|$|To {{identify}} the molecular basis of non-syndromic autosomal recessive congenital cataracts (arCC) in a consanguineous family. All family members {{participating in the}} study received a comprehensive ophthalmic examination to determine their ocular phenotype and contributed a blood sample, from which genomic DNA was extracted. Available medical records and interviews with the family were used to compile the medical history of the family. The symptomatic history of the individuals exhibiting cataracts was confirmed by slit-lamp biomicroscopy. A genome-wide linkage analysis was performed to localize the disease interval. The candidate gene, LIM 2 (lens intrinsic membrane protein 2), was sequenced bi-directionally to {{identify the}} disease-causing mutation. The physical changes caused by the mutation were analyzed in silico through homology modeling, mutation and bioinformatic algorithms, and evolutionary conservation databases. The physiological importance of LIM 2 to ocular development was assessed in vivo by real-time expression analysis of Lim 2 in a mouse model. Ophthalmic examination confirmed the diagnosis of nuclear cataracts in the affected members of the family; the inheritance pattern and cataract development in early infancy indicated arCC. Genome-wide linkage analysis localized the critical interval to chromosome 19 q with a two-point logarithm of odds (LOD) score of 3. 25. Bidirectional sequencing identified a novel missense mutation, c. 233 G>A (p. G 78 D) in LIM 2. This mutation segregated with the disease phenotype and was absent in 192 ethnically <b>matched</b> control <b>chromosomes.</b> In silico analysis predicted lower hydropathicity and hydrophobicity but higher polarity of the mutant LIM 2 -encoded protein (MP 19) compared to the wild-type. Moreover, these analyses predicted that the mutation would disrupt the secondary structure of a transmembrane domain of MP 19. The expression of Lim 2, which was detected in the mouse lens as early as embryonic day 15 (E 15) increased after birth to a level that was sustained through the postnatal time points. A novel missense mutation in LIM 2 is responsible for autosomal recessive congenital cataracts...|$|R
40|$|Objective(s) : Hypoxia is {{a serious}} {{challenge}} for treatment of solid tumors. This condition has been manifested to exert significant therapeutic effects on glioblastoma multiform or (WHO) astrocytoma grade IV. Hypoxia contributes numerous changes in cellular mechanisms such as angiogenesis, metastasis and apoptosis evasion. Furthermore, in molecular level, hypoxia can cause induction of DNA breaks in tumor cells. Identification of mechanisms responsible for these effects can lead to designing more efficient therapeutic strategies against tumor progression which results in improvement of patient prognosis. Â  Materials and Methods: In order to identify more hypoxia regulated genes which may {{have a role in}} glioblastoma progression, cDNA-AFLP was optimized as a Differential display method which is able to identify and isolate transcripts with no prior sequence knowledge. Results: Using this method, the current study identified 120 Transcription Derived Fragments (TDFs) which were completely differentially regulated in response to hypoxia. By sequence homology searching, the current study could detect 22 completely differentially regulated known genes and two unknown sequence <b>matching</b> with two <b>chromosome</b> contig and four sequence matches with some Expressed Sequence Tags (ESTs). Conclusion: Further characterizing of these genes may help to achieve better understanding of hypoxia mediated phenotype change in tumor cells...|$|R
