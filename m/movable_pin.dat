50|$|The main {{element in}} the Mordvinian costume was a white canvas shirt, {{decorated}} with embroidery. Erzya shirt is made from two cloths, which beaned in two. In the middle, at the central suture there was a seam left to slit for the collar and the slit on the hem for a step. In the side seams on the top at right angle there were sewed sleeves. Traditional chest fastener in the Erzya costume was «fibula syulgamo». It was an oval buckle made of thick wire with a <b>movable</b> <b>pin</b> which was used for chipping the collar. Rich lower part covered a deep chest slit. In the 19th century, the collar was usually fastened by two fibulas, one of which had no decoration.Complex belt elements played a particular importance in Mordovian women`s costumes.Costume was loincloth- pulay, which was worn over a shirt. As a sign of pubescence, girls begin to wear a pulay since 13-14 years old and then it remained the woman`s costume accessory until her death. Mordvinian woman could not appear in men society without a «pulay». Depending on the place of existence, it had a different form: square, trapeziform or as a belt with magnificent fringe.Holiday « pulay» was decorated with shells, chains, copper buttons, badges, colored beads and along the edge with long, black, red, green or blue wool and with tassels on each side. As a result, the weight of such a «pulaya» was up to 6 kilograms. Waist decoration «pulay» was of two types. The {{right side of the}} cloth was decorated with embroidery. Then, almost to knees there was a fringe from the wool, usually of black, but on holidays it could be of red or green wool. Wool decorated with copper chains and on each side attached tassels of beads.Typical thing for Erzya costume was a canvas over clothes- “rutsya”. It was the clothing accessory of married women and had options for different situations in life and ritual. Over the shirt or rutsya they wore an apron - « ikelga patsya». It was tied low on the abdomen to close the hem of her shirt. In the complex adornments, which included several tiers of necklaces, especially distinguished original round collars on a firm basis covered with a canvas embroidered with rows of beads, buttons and chains. All of them perfectly matched with massive embroidery “rutsi”.The quality of clothing was defined by the type of embroidery. Spruce Erzya shirt was embroidered all along longitudinal stripes. Erzya embroidery was characterized by a beautiful carpet texture, borders and planes distinguished high relief. Although the ornament was pretty simple: rhombus, crosses and polylines. Decorating clothes women choose the best patterns - «sermat». In the old days they were the symbols of family belonging. Erzya woman naturally endowed with a sense of proportion. Intuitively, without the knowledge of designing and modeling clothes, she sewed a masterpiece. Red and black vertical stripes on a white canvas looked noble. A wide belt, «pulay» with long black strands emphasized hips and women looked slimmer. Removable adornments -were an obligatory addition to the clothes. This is a necklace with different lengths and materials, beaded collars, fibula-syulgamo, badges and bells.|$|E
40|$|Abstract—In this paper, the {{influencing}} {{parameters of}} a novel purely mechanical wireless in-mould injection moulding sensor were investigated. The sensor is capable of detecting the melt front at predefined locations inside the mould. The sensor com-prises a <b>movable</b> <b>pin</b> which acts as the sensor element generating structure-borne sound triggered by the passing melt front. Due to the sensor design, melt pressure is the driving force. For pressure level measurement during pin movement a pressure transducer located at {{the same position as}} the <b>movable</b> <b>pin.</b> By deriving a mathematical model for the mechanical movement, dominant process parameters could be investigated towards their impact on the melt front detection characteristic. It was found that the sensor is not affected by the investigated parameters enabling it for reliable melt front detection. In addition, it could be proved that the novel sensor is in comparable range to conventional melt front detection sensors...|$|E

In general, <b>movable</b> <b>pins</b> are suspended within a cooling plenum between an active layer and a second layer of the microelectronic device. In one embodiment, the second layer is another active layer of the microelectronic device. The <b>movable</b> <b>pins</b> are formed of a material that has a surface tension that decreases as temperature increases such that, {{in response to a}} temperature gradient {{on the surface of the}} active layer, the <b>movable</b> <b>pins</b> move by capillary flow in the directions of decreasing temperature.

40|$|Friction StirWelding (FSW) {{has been}} {{researched}} {{for a number of}} years since its inception in 1991. The work thus far has been based on understanding the material and thermal flow using the standard fixed pin tool. The keyhole resulting during tool extraction in a FSW weld, is a disadvantage and a current limiting factor. Eliminating this effect from a weld using a <b>movable</b> <b>pin</b> tools would make FSW more commercially viable. This dissertation focuses on the design of a novel retractable pin tool, and highlights the problems encountered during the welding of Aluminum plates, Al 2024 and Al 5083. Previously studied techniques of material and thermal flow were used, to investigate the effect of the tool during extraction in a FSW weld. A prototype retractable tool was designed using parametric and axiomatic design theory, and implementing a pneumatic muscle actuation system. The resulting problems in the calibration of the retractable pin tool and the resulting welds are presented, these results confirming previous studies. The <b>movable</b> <b>pin</b> produced discrepancies the heat generation around the shoulder during a FSW weld. The failure of this tool to produce a reasonable weld showed that previous ideas into the workings of a retractable pin tool requires further investigation, furthermore a fresh approach to the interpretation and understanding of the FSW weld process needs consideration...|$|E
40|$|Large {{signals of}} charged light mesons are {{observed}} in the laser-induced particle flux from ultra-dense hydrogen H(0) layers. The mesons are formed in such layers on metal surfaces using < 200 mJ laser pulse-energy. The time variation of the signal to metal foil collectors and the magnetic deflection to a <b>movable</b> <b>pin</b> collector are now studied. Relativistic charged particles with velocity up to 500 MeV u- 1 thus 0. 75 c are observed. Characteristic decay time constants for meson decay are observed, for charged and neutral kaons and also for charged pions. Magnetic deflections agree with charged pions and kaons. Theoretical predictions of the decay chains from kaons to muons in the particle beam agree with the results. Muons are detected separately by standard scintillation detectors in laser-induced processes in ultra-dense hydrogen H(0) as published previously. The muons formed do not decay appreciably within the flight distances used here. Most of the laser-ejected particle flux with MeV energy is not deflected by the magnetic fields and is thus neutral, either being neutral kaons or the ultra-dense HN(0) precursor clusters. Photons give only a minor part of the detected signals. PACS: 67. 63. Gh, 14. 40. -n, 79. 20. Ds, 52. 57. -z...|$|E

40|$|In {{the present}} paper, tool wear {{and the rate}} of wear during {{friction}} stir welding (FSW) of Ti- 6 Al- 4 V alloy are investigated. A conical tungsten carbide tool was used to produce butt-type friction stir welded joints in two-millimeter thick Ti- 6 Al- 4 V sheets. An original design of a <b>movable</b> <b>pin</b> allowed for the examination of the tool damage for each process condition. The influence of tool degradation {{on the quality of the}} welded joints and the damage brought to the microstructure are examined and discussed. For this purpose, optical and scanning electron microscopies as well as EDX analyses were used to examine the tool wear and the resulting macrostructures and microstructures. The type and nature of the defects are also analyzed as a function of FSW processing parameters. Important geometry and weight variations were observed on the pin and shoulder for all welding conditions, in particular when low tool rotation and travel speeds were used. Experimental results also show that the radial wear of the pin is not uniform, indicating the presence of important frictional temperature gradients through the thickness of the joint. The maximum wear was measured at a location of about one millimeter from the pin root center. Finally, tool rotation was determined as the most significant process parameter influencing both tool wear and microstructure of the joints...|$|E

Critics were initially concerned that the many individual moving components of the [...] "catcher" [...] would quickly wear. This fear was allayed, however, by a three-year-long trial that began in May 1892. On the contrary, by using a catcher, the transmission of power was improved so that more barges could be hauled in one string. As a consequence all new chain boats built by Kette in Übigau were fitted with catchers.|$|R
40|$|In this paper, a novel {{variable}} stiffness {{mechanism is}} presented, which {{is capable of}} achieving an output stiffness with infinite range and an unlimited output motion, i. e., the mechanism output is completely decoupled from the rotor motion, in the zero stiffness configuration. The mechanism makes use of leaf springs, which are engaged at different positions by means of two movable supports, to realize the variable output stiffness. The Euler–Bernoulli leaf spring model is derived and validated through experimental data. By shaping the leaf springs, it is shown that the stiffness characteristic of the mechanism can be changed to fulfill different application requirements. Alternative designs can achieve the same behavior with only one leaf spring and one <b>movable</b> support <b>pin...</b>|$|R
40|$|We {{report the}} {{advances}} made in electrochemical machining of access holes through sheet metal during FY 2005. The cutting tool underwent a major engineering re-design to accommodate an oblong cut with parallel sides (1. 5 '' spacing) on a surface of arbitrary curvature. The solid cathode {{was replaced by}} an array of separately <b>movable</b> steel <b>pins,</b> allowing the tool {{to conform to the}} surface shape of the work piece prior to beginning cutting. Preliminary cuts through a hardened steel drum (0. 04 inch thickness) were successfully completed at a low current (50 A) but the current efficiency of the cutting process was poor (< 30 %). Efficiency was improved to 75 % and the cutting time reduced to 8 minutes in heated electrolyte at 100 A and 4. 5 V. This work led to improvements in process simplicity and ease of operation: (1) continuous movement of the cathode towards the work piece was eliminated in favor of a fixed cathode; (2) the surfaces of the cutting pins do not require insulation; (3) a spider support for the tool provides for rapid positioning of the cutting tool; (4) negative electrolyte pressure minimized leakage into the drum following breakthrough.
