40|$|OBJECTIVE: <b>Methylphenidate</b> <b>hydrochloride</b> is {{the most}} widely used {{medication}} for treatment and management of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder. However, the chronic effects of <b>methylphenidate</b> <b>hydrochloride</b> on anxiety- and depressive-like rat behaviors remain poorly investigated. In this context, the present study evaluated the effects of treatment with <b>methylphenidate</b> <b>hydrochloride</b> on anxiety- and depressive-like behaviors using young and adult rats during the light and the dark cycle. METHOD: Male Wistar rats (25 or 60 days old) received a once-daily (in either the light or dark cycle) <b>methylphenidate</b> <b>hydrochloride</b> (2 mg/kg) or saline intraperitoneal injection for 28 days. We performed elevated plus maze and forced swimming test two hours after the last injection. RESULTS: The light/dark cycle was a significant factor in the anxiety-like behaviors; however, no significant interaction between all three factors (cycle, age and <b>methylphenidate</b> <b>hydrochloride)</b> was found. Nevertheless, we observed a nominally significant interaction between the light/ dark cycle and age in the forced swimming test. CONCLUSION: Our results have shown that age and the light/dark cycle are more significant modulators of anxiety- and depressive-like behaviors than <b>methylphenidate</b> <b>hydrochloride</b> treatment...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{attempts}} {{to clarify the}} impact of <b>methylphenidate</b> <b>hydrochloride</b> (MPH) on key components involved in energy balance, specifically, resting energy (REE) and postprandial energy expenditure (PEE), substrate oxidation, energy intake and appetite. A double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, cross-over {{study was conducted to}} measure any differences between MPH and placebo treatments. MPH and/or placebo were administered orally (0. 5 mg/kg) to seven healthy males (age: 19 - 37 y, BMI: 19. 8 - 30. 5 kg/m 2, body fat: 8 - 1 - 23. 6 %) and seven healthy females (age: 20 - 26 y, BMI: 20. 6 - 32. 4 kg/m 2, body fat: 18. 8 - 42. 1 %). Indirect calorimetry was used to calculate energy expenditure variables while energy intake variables were measured during an ad libitum buffet-type lunch. Body composition was measured with dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA). The post-prandial energy expenditure (PEE) phase was measured over a 3 -hour period. Vital signs (BP and HR) were assessed pre- and post-administration of MPH or placebo in every session. Results demonstrate that resting energy expenditure (REE) during MPH treatment increased over values obtained during the placebo session (1727. 4 kcal/ 24 h vs. 1612. 3 kcal/ 24 h, p< 0. 001). No changes in fasting respiratory exchange ratio (RER) were noted; however, significant decreases in post-prandial RER were found during the 30 - to 90 -min time interval (p< 0. 01). Although PEE continually decreased with time as expected, MPH treatment resulted in significantly greater PEE values at 90 -min (MPH: 1946. 9 kcal/ 24 h +/- 290. 0 vs. placebo: 1856. 5 kcal/ 24 h +/- 260. 3, p< 0. 005).

30|$|<b>Methylphenidate</b> <b>hydrochloride</b> [(dl-threo-methyl- 2 -phenyl- 2 -(2 -piperidyl) acetate] is {{a central}} nervous system {{stimulant}} derived from piperidine that is structurally similar to amphetamine, and acts as a norepinephrine - dopamine reuptake inhibitor. It increases dopaminergic neurotransmission, particularly at the striatal and frontal levels, by inhibiting presynaptic dopamine transporters. By blocking reuptake of noradrenaline and dopamine {{at the level of}} the presynaptic neuron, it increases the release of these monoamines {{at the level of the}} synaptic cleft. The effect of methyphenidate is mediated by blocking the Dopamine Transporter (DAT), which increases the synaptic concentration of dopamine (Volkow et al. 2002), known to be a key neuromodulating agent. The ultimate result is increased attention, motor function and memory. Despite the extensive literature investigating methylphenidate, its mode of action and its effects, the exact mechanism of its therapeutic action remains unclear.|$|E

This study was designed to evaluate and compare the therapeutic effects of two drugs, that is, omega- 3 and <b>methylphenidate</b> <b>hydrochloride</b> (Ritalin®), used to treat patients with ADHD. Methods: This is a clinical trial using a parallel method performed on 85 children aged 6 - 12 years in Yazd city, Iran. The children were divided into two experimental groups and one control group. Thus, 29 subjects were treated with Ritalin®, 28 subjects received omega- 3, and the remaining 28 received placebo.

There is no standard dose for MPH when used for this indication; recommended doses range from 5 - 20 +mg/d. Method: To identify a dose to test formally in a subsequent n-of- 1 trial of fatigue, we recruited patients with advanced cancer and a fatigue score of 4 or more on a 10 -point scale. Following a 3 -day baseline assessment, each patient titrated MPH at doses ranging from 5 mg/d to 15 mg twice daily at 3 -day intervals. In a daily diary, patients recorded measures of fatigue, depression, toxicity, and symptom control. Results: Ten patients provided consent, 9 completed 8 days and 5 received maximum dose at day 15. Three patients were unwilling to increase the dose to maximum levels as they were satisfied with the response at a lower dose. Across all patients, there was a pattern of rapidly improving fatigue and depression scores to day 9 (5 mg twice daily), with minimal improvement thereafter. Conclusion: The results indicate a dose of 5 mg twice daily for the definitive study. There was little correlation between performance status and maximum tolerated dose.

C. chloropyga larvae were reared on pig liver treated with MPH and exhibited a trend of expedited larval {{development and}} prolonged pupal development. Conservatively, the results suggest that MPH may expedite the larval stage by up to 17 hours and prolong the pupal stage by up to 16 hours. These preliminary findings suggest that, at the concentration investigated, MPH may alter the duration of C. chloropyga developmental stages, and consequently PMI estimates if MPH is not detected or its effects not considered. Furthermore, MPH was detected in both frozen and ethanol preserved specimens. MPH could still be detected from treated larvae, after 3. 5 days incubation at ~ 30 °C. This may suggest an improved stability of MPH in insects. Moreover, detection of MPH from ethanol preserved specimens suggests the qualitative toxicological utility of specimens maintained in this preservation liquid, despite stability and self-extraction concerns.

40|$|Background: <b>Methylphenidate</b> <b>hydrochloride</b> (MPH) {{is used in}} the {{treatment}} of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). The non-medical use of MPH by learners and students has been reported by numerous studies from abroad. The practice stems from beliefs about the benefits of MPH in achieving academic success. Little is known about the use of MPH in South African student populations. Objectives: The study set out to determine (1) the extent and dynamics associated with MPH use and (2) poly-substance use among undergraduate students attending a South African university. Methods: 818 students took part in a written, group-administered survey. Data analysis resulted in descriptive results regarding MPH use and tests of association identified differences in MPH and poly-substance use among respondents. Results: One in six respondents (17. 2 %) has used MPH in the past, although only 2. 9 % have been diagnosed with ADHD. Nearly a third (31. 7 %) of users obtained MPH products illegally. The majority (69. 1 %) used MPH only during periods of academic stress. A significant association (p < 0. 001) was found between MPH use and the frequency of using alcohol, tobacco, cannabis, hard drugs (e. g. cocaine) and prescription medication. Conclusion: MPH use among students appears similar to experiences abroad, especially in the absence of clinical diagnosis for ADHD. Institutions of higher education should inform parents and students about the health risks associated with the illicit use of MPH. Prescribers and dispensers of MPH products should pay close attention to practices of stockpiling medication and poly-substance use among students who use MPH...|$|E
40|$|Background: It is {{estimated}} that 29 % of deaths in Australia are caused by malignant disease each year and {{can be expected to}} increase with population ageing. In advanced cancer, the prevalence of fatigue is high at 70 – 90 %, and can be related to the disease and/or the treatment. The negative impact of fatigue on function (physical, mental, social and spiritual) and quality of life is substantial for many palliative patients as well as their families/carers. Method/design: This paper describes the design of single patient trials (n-of- 1 s or SPTs) of a psychostimulant, <b>methylphenidate</b> <b>hydrochloride</b> (MPH) (5 mg bd), compared to placebo as a treatment for fatigue, with a population estimate of the benefit by the aggregation of multiple SPTs. Forty patients who have advanced cancer will be enrolled through specialist palliative care services in Australia. Patients will complete up to 3 cycles of treatment. Each cycle is 6 days long and has 3 days treatment and 3 days placebo. The order of treatment and placebo is randomly allocated for each cycle. The primary outcome is a reduction in fatigue severity as measured by the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-fatigue subscale (FACIT-F). Secondary outcomes include adverse events, quality of life, additional fatigue assessments, depression and Australian Karnovsky Performance Scale. Discussion: This study will provide high-level evidence using a novel methodological approach about the effectiveness of psychostimulants for cancer-related fatigue. If effective, the findings will guide clinical practice in reducing this prevalent condition to improve function and quality of life. Full Tex...|$|E
40|$|Film forming systems offer {{a number}} of {{advantages}} for topical and transdermal drug delivery, in particular enabling production of a supersaturated state which can greatly improve drug absorption and bioavailability. However the suitability of individual film forming polymers to stabilise the supersaturated state and optimise delivery of drugs is not well understood. This study reports the use of differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) to measure the solubility of methylphenidate both as the free base and as the hydrochloride salt in two polymethacrylate copolymers, Eudragit RS (EuRS) and Eudragit E (EuE) and relates this {{to the ability of}} films formed using these polymers to deliver methylphenidate across a model membrane. EuRS provided greater methylphenidate delivery when the drug was formulated as the free base in comparison EuE because the lower solubility of the drug in EuRS provided a higher degree of drug saturation in the polymeric film. In contrast EuE provided greater delivery of <b>methylphenidate</b> <b>hydrochloride</b> as EuRS could not prevent its crystallisation from a supersaturated state. Methylphenidate flux across the membrane could be directly related to degree of saturation of the drug in the film formulation as estimated by the drug solubility in the individual polymers demonstrating the importance of drug solubility in the polymer included in film forming systems for topical/transdermal drug delivery. In addition DSC has been demonstrated to be a useful tool for determining the solubility of drugs in polymers used in film forming systems and the approaches outlined here are likely to be useful for predicting the suitability of polymers for particular drugs in film forming transdermal drug delivery systems...|$|E

Using available data in healthy adults, a two-input, one-compartment, first-order elimination population pharmacokinetic model was developed using nonlinear mixed-effect modeling. The model was then extended to pediatric subjects, and was found to adequately describe plasma concentration–time data for this population. A pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic model was also developed using change from baseline in the ADHD Rating Scale (ADHD-RS) -IV total scores from a pediatric Phase III trial and simulated plasma concentration–time data. During simulations for each MPH-MLR dose level (10 – 80 mg), increased body weight resulted in decreased maximum concentration. Additionally, as maximum concentration increased, ADHD-RS-IV total score improved (decreased). Knowledge of the relationship between dose, body weight, and clinical response following the administration of MPH-MLR {{in children and adolescents}} may be useful for clinicians selecting initial dosing of MPH-MLR. Additional study is needed to confirm these results. Keywords: population pharmacokinetics, Aptensio XR™, MPH-MLR, methylphenidat...|$|E
40|$|Psychostimulants are the {{recommended}} first-line pharmacological treatment for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Methylphenidate {{is one of}} the most commonly used psychostimulants worldwide. Given that immediate-release and/or tablet/capsule formulations may decrease adherence to methylphenidate treatment, several drug companies have been developing novel long-acting and/or liquid/chewable formulations that may improve adherence as well as (for long-acting formulations) reduce abuse potential, decrease stigma associated with multiple administrations per day, and decrease the potential for adverse effects related to dosage peak. Here, we review the pharmacokinetics, efficacy, and tolerability of novel formulations of methylphenidate that are in development or have been approved by the US FDA or European Medicines Agency (EMA) in the last 5 years. We searched the websites of the FDA, EMA, ClinicalTrials. gov, and the pertinent drug companies. We also searched PubMed, Ovid databases (MEDLINE, PsycINFO, Embase + Embase classic), and ISI Web of Knowledge (Web of Science [Science Citation Index Expanded], Biological Abstracts, Biosis, Food Science and Technology Abstracts) to retrieve any additional pertinent information. We found data from trials for the following compounds: (1) methylphenidate extended-release oral suspension (MEROS; NWP 06, Quillivant™); (2) methylphenidate extended-release chewable capsules (NWP 09, QuilliChew ER™); (3) <b>methylphenidate</b> <b>hydrochloride</b> extended-release capsules (Aptensio XR™); (4) methylphenidate extended-release orally disintegrating tablets (XR-ODT; NT- 0102, Cotempla™); (5) ORADUR technology (once-daily tamper-resistant formulation) methylphenidate sustained release (SR); and (6) methylphenidate modified-release (HLD- 200; Bejorna™).

MethodsAn economic model with Markov processes was developed to {{estimate the}} costs and benefits of atomoxetine versus other current ADHD treatment options. The model evaluated atomoxetine in five patient subgroups according to treatment history and the existence of comorbidities precluding stimulant medication. The incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) was calculated for atomoxetine treatment algorithms compared with comparator algorithms. The Markov process incorporated 18 health states, representing a range of outcomes across all treatment options included in the algorithms. Utility values were derived from a survey of 83 parents of children with ADHD. The effectiveness and safety aspects of the treatment options were based on a thorough review of controlled clinical trials and other clinical literature, and validated by international experts. Costs andoutcomes were estimated using Monte Carlo simulation over a 1 -year duration, with costs estimated from the perspective of the National Health Service in England and Wales. ResultsFor stimulant-naive patients, the incremental cost per QALY gained for the atomoxetine algorithm compared with immediate-release <b>methylphenidate</b> <b>hydrochloride</b> (MPH) was £ 15, 224 (£ 13, 241 compared with extended-release MPH). In the stimulant-exposed populations, the incremental cost per QALY for the atomoxetine algorithm was between £ 14, 169 and £ 15, 878. For patients contraindicated for stimulant therapies, the incremental cost per QALY was £ 11, 523 and £ 12, 370 for stimulant-naive and stimulant-exposed populations, respectively. ConclusionThe economic evaluation showed atomoxetine is an effective alternative across a range of ADHD populations and offers value-for-money in the treatment of ADHD...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND : <b>Methylphenidate</b> <b>hydrochloride</b> (MPH) {{is used in}} the {{treatment}} of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). The non-medical use of MPH by learners and students has been reported by numerous studies from abroad. The practice stems from beliefs about the benefits of MPH in achieving academic success. Little is known about the use of MPH in South African student populations. OBJECTIVES : The study set out to determine (1) the extent and dynamics associated with MPH use and (2) poly-substance use among undergraduate students attending a South African university. METHODS : 818 students took part in a written, group-administered survey. Data analysis resulted in descriptive results regarding MPH use and tests of association identified differences in MPH and poly-substance use among respondents. RESULTS : One in six respondents (17. 2 %) has used MPH in the past, although only 2. 9 % have been diagnosed with ADHD. Nearly a third (31. 7 %) of users obtained MPH products illegally. The majority (69. 1 %) used MPH only during periods of academic stress. A significant association (p < 0. 001) was found between MPH use and the frequency of using alcohol, tobacco, cannabis, hard drugs (e. g. cocaine) and prescription medication. CONCLUSION : MPH use among students appears similar to experiences abroad, especially in the absence of clinical diagnosis for ADHD. Institutions of higher education should inform parents and students about the health risks associated with the illicit use of MPH. Prescribers and dispensers of MPH products should pay close attention to practices of stockpiling medication and poly-substance use among students who use MPH. [URL] Work and Criminolog...|$|E
40|$|Although {{numerous}} children receive <b>methylphenidate</b> <b>hydrochloride</b> for {{the treatment}} of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), little is known about age-dependent and possibly lasting effects of methylphenidate on the human dopaminergic system. To determine whether the effects of methylphenidate on the dopaminergic system are modified by age and to test the hypothesis that methylphenidate treatment of young but not adult patients with ADHD induces lasting effects on the cerebral blood flow response to dopamine challenge, a noninvasive probe for dopamine function. A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial (Effects of Psychotropic Drugs on Developing Brain-Methylphenidate) among ADHD referral centers in the greater Amsterdam area in the Netherlands between June 1, 2011, and June 15, 2015. Additional inclusion criteria were male sex, age 10 to 12 years or 23 to 40 years, and stimulant treatment-naive status. Treatment with either methylphenidate or a matched placebo for 16 weeks. Change in the cerebral blood flow response to an acute challenge with methylphenidate, noninvasively assessed using pharmacological magnetic resonance imaging, between baseline and 1 week after treatment. Data were analyzed using intent-to-treat analyses. Among 131 individuals screened for eligibility, 99 patients met DSM-IV criteria for ADHD, and 50 participants were randomized to receive methylphenidate and 49 to placebo. Sixteen weeks of methylphenidate treatment increased the cerebral blood flow response to methylphenidate within the thalamus (mean difference, 6. 5; 95 % CI, 0. 4 - 12. 6; P[*]=[*]. 04) of children aged 10 to 12 years old but not in adults or in the placebo group. In the striatum, the methylphenidate condition differed significantly from placebo in children but not in adults (mean difference, 7. 7; 95 % CI, 0. 7 - 14. 8; P[*]=[*]. 03). We confirm preclinical data and demonstrate age-dependent effects of methylphenidate treatment on human extracellular dopamine striatal-thalamic circuitry. Given its societal relevance, these data warrant replication in larger groups with longer follow-up. identifier: NL 34509. 000. 10 and trialregister. nl identifier: NTR 310...|$|E

V. Film forming systems offer a number of advantages for topical and transdermal drug delivery, in particular enabling production of a supersaturated state which can greatly improve drug absorption and bioavailability. However the suitability of individual film forming polymers to stabilise the supersaturated state and optimise delivery of drugs is not well understood. This study reports the use of differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) to measure the solubility of methylphenidate both as the free base and as the hydrochloride salt in two polymethacrylate copolymers, Eudragit RS (EuRS) and Eudragit E (EuE) and relates this to the ability of films formed using these polymers to deliver methylphenidate across a model membrane. EuRS provided greater methylphenidate delivery when the drug was formulated as the free base in comparison EuE because the lower solubility of the drug in EuRS provided a higher degree of drug saturation in the polymeric film. In contrast EuE provided greater delivery of <b>methylphenidate</b> <b>hydrochloride</b> as EuRS could not prevent its crystallisation from a supersaturated state. Methylphenidate flux across the membrane could be directly related to degree of saturation of the drug in the film formulation as estimated by the drug solubility in the individual polymers demonstrating the importance of drug solubility in the polymer included in film forming systems for topical/transdermal drug delivery. In addition DSC has been demonstrated to be a useful tool for determining the solubility of drugs in polymers used in film forming systems and the approaches outlined here are likely to be useful for predicting the suitability of polymers for particular drugs in film forming transdermal drug delivery systems...|$|E
