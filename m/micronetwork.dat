40|$|Data {{from three}} <b>micronetworks</b> with eddy {{correlation}} data and three additional <b>micronetworks</b> without eddy correlation data are analyzed {{to study the}} spatial variability of surface air temperature in complex terrain. A simple similarity relationship is constructed to relate the spatial variation of air temperature along the slope to the thermal forcing and mixing. Mixing {{is not included in}} present empirical formulations of the surface air temperature distribution in complex terrain. The development of surface temperature gradients along the slope, resulting from surface heating or cooling, is bounded by a maximum (or saturated) value, where a further increase of temperature gradients is restricted by redistribution of heat by thermally driven slope circulations. Although much of the spatial variation of the surface air temperature is governed by complex three-dimensionality and surface vegetation, a relatively simple relationship is able to account for much of the diurnal and day-to-day variation of the spatial distribution of air temperature. This relationship requires information on the surface heat flux and friction velocity over a reference surface. Required generalizations of the relationship are outlined before it can be applied to an arbitrary site. 1...|$|R
40|$|Background: Collagen, a triple-helical, {{self-organizing}} protein, is {{the predominant}} structural protein in mammals. It {{is found in}} bone, ligament, tendon, cartilage, intervertebral disc, skin, blood vessel, and cornea. We have recently postulated that fibrillar collagens (and their complementary enzymes) comprise {{the basis of a}} smart structural system which appears to support the retention of molecules in fibrils which are under tensile mechanical strain. The theory suggests that the mechanisms which drive the preferential accumulation of collagen in loaded tissue operate at the molecular level and are not solely cell-driven. The concept reduces control of matrix morphology to an interaction between molecules and the most relevant, physical, and persistent signal: mechanical strain. Methodology/Principal Findings: The investigation was carried out in an environmentally-controlled microbioreactor in which reconstituted type I collagen <b>micronetworks</b> were gently strained between micropipettes. The strained <b>micronetworks</b> were exposed to active matrix metalloproteinase 8 (MMP- 8) and relative degradation rates for loaded and unloaded fibrils were tracked simultaneously using label-free differential interference contrast (DIC) imaging. It was found that applied tensile mechanical strain significantly increased degradation time of loaded fibrils compared to unloaded, paired controls. In many cases, strained fibrils were detectable long after unstrained fibrils were degraded.

40|$|The {{present study}} {{analyzes}} the Peruvian Intercultural Birthing policy, {{which sought to}} provide culturally competent care to Andean women by changing health center birth care and incorporating elements of traditional Andean home birth. The proponents and supporters of this policy, assert that it facilitates a dialog of medical traditions on equal terms, promotes respect and cultural dialog, improves quality of care, establishes good relationships with indigenous communities, and ensures better maternal and child health. Furthermore, they contend {{that the use of}} interculturalidad as a framework for health will not only foster cultural competence but also contribute to engage indigenous communities with the state and enable the government to address longstanding inequalities in access to health and education. This study analyzes and evaluates these assertions, and seeks to understand why the policy was created, what factors influenced health providers to implement it, and what impact it had on patients, health providers and the overall goal of promoting Safe Motherhood in Peru. Using a comparative case study design, I contrast two sites of implementation of the Intercultural Birthing policy: the Flores <b>micronetwork</b> and the Kantu <b>micronetwork.</b> Data was collected through formal and informal interviews at national, regional and local levels, and observations of medical visits. The results question the assertion that the intercultural birthing policy is providing improved birth care services for indigenous women. The democratizing ideas of interculturalidad are present only in discourse but not in the coercive and sometimes abusive birth care practice. Additionally, the persistence of a profoundly unequal health system structure penalizes health workers charged with policy implementation, restricting their professional development and marginalizing them because they serve rural communities. I conclude that the framework of interculturalidad in its current iteration does not in fact change the status quo of birthing in the Andes, it does not promote intercultural dialogue, and does little to create culturally appropriate birth care. Rather it is an example of reification and appropriation of the concepts of `culture' and `interculturality' by state structures, which serves to sustain an already existing unequal health system and practice...|$|E

Using this technique, designers can build SoC by integrating dozens of IP cores. As the number of IP cores increases, the on-chip communication and physical interconnections become a bottleneck.

These connections are morphologically similar to "normal" synapses between two different neurons, and thus were long {{thought to have}} similar properties of synaptic transmission. However, {{this has not been}} directly tested. Here, using a micro-island culture assay in which we can define the number of interconnected cells, we directly compared synaptic transmission in excitatory autapses and in two-neuron <b>micronetworks</b> consisting of two excitatory neurons, in which a neuron is connected to one other neuron and to itself. We discovered that autaptic synapses are optimized for maximal transmission, and exhibited enhanced EPSC amplitude, charge, and RRP size compared to interneuronal synapses. However, autapses are deficient in several aspects of synaptic plasticity. Short-term potentiation only became apparent when a neuron was connected to another neuron. This acquisition of plasticity only required reciprocal innervation with one other neuron; <b>micronetworks</b> consisting of just two interconnected neurons exhibited enhanced short-term plasticity in terms of paired pulse ratio (PPR) and release probability (Pr), compared to autapses. Interestingly, when a neuron was connected to another neuron, not only interneuronal synapses, but also the autaptic synapses on itself exhibited a trend toward enhanced short-term plasticity in terms of PPR and Pr. Thus neurons can distinguish whether they are connected via "self" or "non-self" synapses and have the ability to adjust their plasticity parameters when connected to other neurons...|$|R

Pavlovian fear conditioning is a key tool for the study of fundamental aspects of fear learning. Here, we used a selected mouse line of High and Low Pavlovian conditioned fear created from an advanced intercrossed line (AIL) in order to begin to identify the cellular basis of phenotypic divergence in Pavlovian fear conditioning. We investigated whether phosphorylated MAPK (p 44 / 42 ERK/MAPK), a protein kinase required in the amygdala for the acquisition and consolidation of Pavlovian fear memory, is differentially expressed following Pavlovian fear learning in the High and Low fear lines. We found that following Pavlovian auditory fear conditioning, High and Low line mice differ in the number of pMAPK-expressing neurons in the dorsal sub nucleus of the lateral amygdala (LAd). In contrast, this difference was not detected in the ventral medial (LAvm) or ventral lateral (LAvl) amygdala sub nuclei or in control animals. We propose that this apparent increase in plasticity at a known locus of fear memory acquisition and consolidation relates to intrinsic differences between the two fear phenotypes.

Superheated steam drying reduces substantially the linting propensity of TMP paper, by about 30 %- 60 % depending on the criteria used. Improved lignin softening by higher web temperature from the beginning of drying in superheated steam drying is believed an important mechanism in improving bonding of surface fines and short fibre fragments.

A sensitivity test of this geodetic network showed a clear need to extend it to cover the full island for volcano monitoring purposes. This conclusion, together with the detection of two unexpected movements on the island using InSAR that were beyond the scope of the traditional geodetic network, prompted the authors to design and observe a GPS network covering the whole of Tenerife. The network was monitored in August 2000. The results obtained were accurate to 1 cm, and confirm the deformation in the Pinar de Chio zone, but are not definitive enough to confirm the displacements detected to the south of the village of Garachico. Furthermore, new cases of possible subsidence have been detected in areas where InSAR could not be used to measure deformation due to low coherence. Future observations will be necessary for further validation and to study the time evolution of the displacements, and supplementary research must be conducted to determine the possible causes, in particular if they are connected with the water pumping operations performed on the island.

Our understanding of the molecular mecha-nisms of synaptic function, of neurotrans-mitter receptor molecular biology, of modulatory mechanisms, and gap junc-tions has exploded. Further, we now have strong evidence of postnatal and disease-induced neuroplasticity in the mature ret-ina. Some problems persist. We still do not know how horizontal cells (HCs) work; how red/green color coding happens; why we need so many kinds of bipolar cells (BCs) and amacrine cells (ACs); how the retina develops (though great advances have been made); what retinal efferents do; nor the exact details of any ganglion cell (GC) <b>micronetwork.</b> The study of reti-nal structure remains a dynamic, challeng-ing enterprise...|$|E
40|$|Synaptotagmin-I (syt-I) is {{required}} for rapid neurotransmitter release in mouse hippocampal neurons. However, contradictory results have been reported regarding evoked and spontaneous secretion from syt-I knock-out (KO) neurons. Here, we compared synaptic transmission in two different hippocampal neuron preparations: autaptic cultures in which a single isolated cell innervates itself, and dissociated mass cultures in which individual cells are innervated by neighboring cells. In autaptic cultures, the total extent of evoked release, size of readily releasable pool of synaptic vesicles, and release probability were unchanged in syt-I KO neurons. In contrast, in cultures containing multiple interconnected neurons, total evoked release, the number of docked vesicles, and release probability, were significantly reduced in syt-IKOneurons. Usingamicronetwork system inwhichwevaried thenumberof cells onan island,we found that the frequency of spontaneous synaptic vesicle fusion events (minis) was unchanged in syt-I KO neurons when two or fewer cells were present on an island. However, inmicronetworks composed of three ormore neurons,mini frequencywas increased threefold to fivefold in syt-I KO neurons compared with wild type. Moreover, interneuronal synapses exhibited higher rates of spontaneous release than autaptic synapses. This higher rate was attributable {{to an increase in}} release probability because excitatory hippocampal neurons in <b>micronetworks</b> formed a set number of synapses per cell regardless of the number of connected neurons. Thus, aspects of synaptic transmission differ between autaptic and dissociated cultures, and the synaptic transmission phenotype, resulting from loss of syt-I, is dictated by the connectivity of neurons...|$|R
40|$|Between 26 and 29 October 2002, the Mt. Etna {{area was}} struck by a seismic swarm that counted some hundred events some of them well felt by the population. A first group of epicenters is located in the E-NE part of the volcano, {{reaching}} a maximum local magnitude of 4. 6 on October 27 at 02 : 50 UT. A second group, occurring since October 28, is located in the SE flank close to the town of Zafferana Etnea and culminated with the ML 4. 4 earthquake of October 29 at 10 : 02 UT. The seismic swarm was concomitant with the opening of a system of fractures {{in the eastern part of}} the volcano and the reactivation of the eruptive fracture system originated by the 2001 eruption. The most damaging event was the ML 4. 4 earthquake of October 29, which occurred in a densely urbanized territory and attained intensity VIII on the European Macroseismic Scale (EMS). In spite of its small local magnitude, the shock caused significant damage to many buildings including reinforced concrete ones in an area that extends for about 4 km in a NNW-SSE direction and is centered around the villages of S. Venerina and Guardia. A long system of surface fractures originated along the damaged area. Other similar and even stronger events of the 2002 swarm in the northern zone did not cause diffuse damage since they occurred in a not densely urbanized area; however, they were highly destructive for the few sparse buildings close to the epicenters. The sequence was well recorded by the Broad Band Station of Antillo (Mednet Network), the most energetic events also triggered the Strong Motion Stations of Bronte (BRNT) and Catania (CATA). The latest part of the sequence (Dec. 2003 – Jan. 2004) was recorded by the local <b>micronetwork</b> installed in Santa Venerina (SVN). Two of these stations were also operating in Santa Venerina from Nov. 2003 to Aug. 2004. Moreover, data from a broad band station installed in Catania are available from Mar. 2001 to Dec. 2001...|$|E
40|$|Geodetic volcano {{monitoring}} in Tenerife has {{mainly focused}} on the Las Cañadas Caldera, where a geodetic <b>micronetwork</b> and a levelling profile are located. A sensitivity test of this geodetic network showed {{that it should be}} extended to cover the whole island for volcano monitoring purposes. Furthermore, InSAR allowed detecting two unexpected movements that were beyond the scope of the traditional geodetic network. These two facts prompted us to design and observe a GPS network covering the whole of Tenerife that was monitored in August 2000. The results obtained were accurate to one centimetre, and confirm one of the deformations, although they were not definitive enough to confirm the second one. Furthermore, new cases of possible subsidence have been detected in areas where InSAR could not be used to measure deformation due to low coherence. A first modelling attempt has been made using a very simple model and its results seem to indicate that the deformation observed and the groundwater level variation in the island may be related. Future observations will be necessary for further validation and to study the time evolution of the displacements, carry out interpretation work using different types of data (gravity, gases, etc) and develop models that represent the island more closely. The results obtained are important because they might affect the geodetic volcano monitoring on the island, which will only be really useful if it is capable of distinguishing between displacements that might be linked to volcanic activity and those produced by other causes. One important result in this work is that a new geodetic monitoring system based on two complementary techniques, InSAR and GPS, has been set up on Tenerife island. This {{the first time that the}} whole surface of any of the volcanic Canary Islands has been covered with a single network for this purpose. This research has displayed the need for further similar studies in the Canary Islands, at least on the islands which pose a greater risk of volcanic reactivation, such as Lanzarote and La Palma, where InSAR techniques have been used already...|$|E
