The function values and the irrespective derivatives to the attributes feasibility are used to go next level in proper way. This method is very effective at finding optimal {{to a wide variety of}} problems, because it does not impose limitations required by traditional methods such as gradient search, random search etc. It has advantages over traditional non linear solution techniques that cannot always achieve an optimal solution.
