40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to clarify {{variation}} in mopane (Colophospermum mopane) vegetation in northern Namibia, focusing on the differences and commonalities in vegetation structure and tree uses by local people. Four study sites representing different land units classified by landscape, land use patterns, and its use by different ethnic groups were selected. Vegetation surveys at each site found mopane as the dominant species at all sites, although mopane density ranged from 217. 1 to 868. 7 individual trees/ha among the sites/land units. There were four types of <b>mopane</b> <b>tree</b> shape by tree height and stem number. The ratios of other tree species to mopane differed much among land units and sites. Interviews with the local people on mopane utilization found that they were highly dependent on trees as a resource for fuel and building material, and commonly used mopane at all sites. Although the mopane utilization was similar among all four sites, the non-mopane tree utilization depended on the characteristics of the tree species composition at specific sites. Mopane vegetation was naturally characterised by the dominance of mopane, but the sites were heterogeneous in species composition, <b>mopane</b> <b>tree</b> shape, and its use by local people, which were mutually interrelated...|$|E
50|$|There are {{at least}} 24 Acacia species and 8 Commiphora species, amongst others.

40|$|Abstract Background The {{investigation}} {{was conducted in}} a savanna area covered by what was considered an undesirably dense stand of Colophospermum <b>mopane</b> <b>trees,</b> mainly because such a dense stand of trees often results in the suppression of herbaceous plants. The objectives {{of this study were}} to determine the influence of intensity of tree thinning on the dry matter yield of herbaceous plants (notably grasses) and to investigate differences in herbaceous species composition between defined subhabitats (under tree canopies, between tree canopies and where trees have been removed). Seven plots (65 × 180 m) were subjected to different intensities of tree thinning, ranging from a totally cleared plot (0 %) to plots thinned to the equivalent of 10 %, 20 %, 35 %, 50 % and 75 % of the leaf biomass of a control plot (100 %) with a tree density of 2711 plants ha - 1. The establishment of herbaceous plants (grasses and forbs) in response to reduced competition from the woody plants was measured during three full growing seasons following the thinning treatments. Results The grass component reacted positively to the tree thinning in terms of total dry matter (DM) yield, but forbs were negatively influenced. Rainfall interacted with tree density and the differences between grass DM yields in thinned plots during years of below average rainfall were substantially higher than those of the control. At high tree densities, yields differed little between seasons of varying rainfall. The relation between grass DM yield and tree biomass was curvilinear, best described by the exponential regression equation. Subhabitat differentiation by C. <b>mopane</b> <b>trees</b> did provide some qualitative benefits, with certain desirable grass species showing a preference for the subhabitat under tree canopies. Conclusion While it can be concluded from this study that high tree densities suppress herbaceous production, the decision to clear/thin the C. <b>mopane</b> <b>trees</b> should include additional considerations. Thinning of C. mopane with the exclusive objective of increasing productivity of the grass layer would thus invariably involve a compromise situation where some trees should be left {{for the sake of the}} qualitative benefits on the herbaceous layer, soil enrichment, provision of browse and stability of the ecosystem. </p...|$|R
40|$|<b>Mopane</b> (Colophospermum <b>mopane)</b> <b>trees</b> are browsed upon by two key species, namely mopane {{caterpillars}} (Imbrasia belina) and African elephants (Loxodonta africana), {{which each}} inflict {{a different type}} of damage while feeding, namely defoliation (leaf removal) and pruning (branch and/or stem breakage). Damage type can have a significant influence on plant responses, and these induced changes in morphological and chemical characteristics of regrowth can influence the subsequent feeding behaviour by each species. The objective of this study was therefore partly to investigate the differential effect of defoliation by mopane caterpillars and pruning by elephants on <b>mopane</b> <b>trees,</b> and then to investigate whether these two taxonomically different species interact through their shared food resource, by looking specifically at the effect of elephant utilisation of mopane on mopane caterpillar abundance. To determine the comparative effect of each browsing type, <b>mopane</b> <b>trees</b> were subjected to simulated mopane caterpillar or elephant utilisation treatments, at various frequencies and times within the year. Regrowth characteristics were then measured on treatment and control trees, as well as on naturally utilised and unutilised trees. Reproductive investment was also recorded on naturally utilised and unutilised trees. Additionally, the impact of mopane caterpillar defoliation and elephant pruning on plant stress was investigated by measuring the level of fluctuating asymmetry (FA) in leaves. Then, to determine whether there is an interaction between elephants and mopane caterpillars, mopane caterpillar egg mass abundance in areas of high elephant impact was compared to that in areas of low elephant impact. Firstly, however, in areas without elephant damage, those tree characteristics determining host tree preference by ovipositing mopane moths were identified. From this, an understanding of how elephant utilisation may influence mopane caterpillar abundance could therefore be gained. Defoliation and pruning had a significant different effect on mopane regrowth responses. Shoot and leaf length were significantly longer on pruned trees than control trees, for both naturally utilised and simulated elephant treatment trees, while {{there was no difference in}} shoot density. Defoliation, however, resulted in shorter shoots and leaves, particularly on naturally defoliated trees, which also had leaves of a higher nutritional value (tannin:protein ratio and total polyphenolic content) than control trees. A similar increase in leaf nutritional value was recorded in areas of high elephant impact in the Kruger National Park, but not after simulated or natural elephant damage in Venetia, where natural elephant utilization was less intense. Time since damage (i. e. first versus second flush) had a significant influence on regrowth after pruning, as shoot and leaf length were significantly longer on trees flushing for the first time, while within-season timing of damage was important for defoliation, as late-season defoliation had a greater negative impact than mid-season defoliation. Late-season defoliation also had a negative effect on leaf carriage into the dry season, while pruning appeared to aid leaf retention. Reproductive investment was found to be unaffected by mopane caterpillar defoliation or elephant pruning, as mean pod density and pod mass on utilised trees was no different to unutilised trees. Defoliation also had no influence on a plant’s likelihood of flowering that same season, with flowering being determined more by tree height. Unlike pod production, however, mean leaf density was significantly reduced in the regrowth of defoliated trees, presumably due to the use of stored resources for reproduction prior to the onset of regrowth. Neither simulated nor natural defoliation by mopane caterpillars and pruning by elephants was found to affect the level of leaf FA in <b>mopane</b> <b>trees,</b> even though the degree of damage inflicted on trees was considerably higher than in studies on other species where increases in FA were observed. Mopane therefore appears to be extremely tolerant of herbivory in comparison to other species. A positive relationship between leaf nutritional value (higher protein and lower tannin and polyphenolic content) and FA was detected, but only when trees from all study areas (i. e. a wide range of environmental conditions) were considered simultaneously. Environmental conditions, rather than herbivory, therefore appear to have a greater stressing affect on mopane. In the absence of heavy elephant utilisation of <b>mopane</b> <b>trees,</b> tree size, rather than shoot length, leaf length, leaf FA or leaf nutritional value, was found to have the greatest influence on oviposition behaviour of mopane moths. Ovipositing moths showed a preference for the tall riverine habitat over the shorter woodland and scrub mopane. This preference for large trees was, however, not evident at the individual tree level, as even though egg mass number per tree was positively related to tree height, large trees were not utilised more than expected according to the available canopy volume in each size class (resource availability). Heavy elephant utilisation of mopane had a negative impact on the density of tall trees within an area, due to branch and stem breakage while feeding. Unsurprisingly then, mopane caterpillar egg mass abundance was also significantly reduced in these areas, even though the nutritional value of leaves was higher than in non-elephant impacted areas. Elephants therefore appear to have a negative effect on mopane caterpillar abundance, primarily due to their negative impact on the density of tall <b>mopane</b> <b>trees.</b> This megaherbivore and invertebrate do therefore interact through their shared food resource, <b>mopane</b> <b>trees.</b> Thesis (PhD (Zoology)) [...] University of Pretoria, 2007.
