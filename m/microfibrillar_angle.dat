40|$|Abstract – The {{relationship}} {{between the amount of}} growth stress and the degree of artificial inclination was investigated in saplings of two angiosperm species. The tensile growth stresses generated in Prunus spachiana, which forms gelatinous fibers, were larger than those in Liriodendron tulipifera, which does not form gelatinous fibers. In both species, the tensile growth stresses generated in the upper side of inclined stems increased and the cellulose <b>microfibrillar</b> <b>angle</b> decreased proportionally as the inclination changed from 0 ° (vertical) to 20 °. At inclinations over 20 °, the tensile growth stress and cellulose <b>microfibrillar</b> <b>angle</b> did not change further. The thickness of the current growth layer increased linearly with the angle of inclination, but eccentric growth was not the main fac-tor contributing to the upward bending moment to return the axis to the normal vertical position. This paper reveals that the growth stress generated by inclination is limited. That is, growth stress increases with the inclination angle to a point, but then does not increase further...|$|E
40|$|A rapid, {{reliable}} {{method of}} enhancing microfibrillar angles for viewing in wood cell walls, a mod-ification of I. W. Bailey's technique, is reviewed. Dried microtomed sections {{are treated with}} an iodine-potassium iodide solution and nitric acid to produce crystals in cell walls of softwood tracheids or hardwood fibers. The crystals are aligned with the predominant <b>microfibrillar</b> <b>angle</b> and may be easily viewed and measured...|$|E
40|$|Fibres from {{different}} structural {{parts of the}} coconut palm tree (Cocos nucifera, linn.) 13; have been examined for properties such as size, density, electrical resistivity, ultimate fracture mode, <b>microfibrillar</b> <b>angle</b> as well as cellulose and lignin contents of these fibres have been determined. The observed properties have been related to the internal structure and chemical composition of the fibres. Some potential uses of these fibres have been listed...|$|E
40|$|The {{characterization}} of fibers extracted from leaflet, the empty fruit bunches, leaf sheath, and spath of palm tree was performed. The fibers were extracted using three different procedures through chemical and / or enzymatic methods. The raw fibers studied have xylose contents between 13 - 22 % and glucose content between 30 % and 45 %. The <b>microfibrillar</b> <b>angle</b> (MFA) values {{are in the}} order: bunch > spath > leaf sheath >> leaflet. Spath and leaf sheath, which naturally occur in a woven form present poor mechanical strength but could be readily used to produce cheap composites. Leaflet fibers extracted from date palm tree exhibiting a low MFA (16 degrees), a high cellulose content, and cellulose crystallinity present the highest ultimate tensile strengths (approximate to 1250 N. mm(- 2)) ...|$|E
40|$|International audienceAn {{elementary}} plant fiber {{could be}} assimilated to a laminate, mainly constituted of the secondary wall S 2 layer, made of a few non-crystalline polysaccharides reinforced by cellulose fibrils organized in a helix, with a <b>microfibrillar</b> <b>angle</b> (MFA) around 10 ° relative to the longitudinal fiber axis. This paper investigates {{the relationships between the}} MFA, the mechanical properties and the biochemical composition of different varieties of flax. To conduct this study, tensile tests on elementary flax fibers, X-ray diffraction, and solvent extractions have been carried out. Within the different varieties of flax, Young's modulus was found to be negatively correlated with the MFA. The results showed that the ratio between hemicelluloses (matter extracted with alkali) and pectins (hydrolyzed with acids) is highly correlated with the tensile properties; concurrently, we showed the great influence of pectic acids on the fiber' Young's modulus, and on the orientation of the microfibrils...|$|E
40|$|In this work, nanofibrillated {{cellulose}} (NFC) {{has been}} evaluated {{as a potential}} reinforcement for cement mortar composites. Two types of vegetable fibres with different composition and properties (cellulose content and <b>microfibrillar</b> <b>angle),</b> sisal, and cotton linters pulps, were initially characterised {{in order to assess}} their reinforcing capability. Sisal pulp was found to be most suitable as reinforcement for the brittle cementitious matrix. Nanofibrillated cellulose was produced by the application of a high intensity refining process of the sisal pulp. It was found that 6 hours of refining time was required to obtain the desired nanofibrillation of the fibers. Cement mortar composites reinforced with both the sisal fibres and the nanofibrillated cellulose were prepared, and the mechanical properties were determined under flexural tests. The cement mortar composites reinforced with the nanofibrillated cellulose exhibited enhanced flexural properties, but lower values of fracture energy, than the ones reinforced with the conventional sisal fibres...|$|E
40|$|International audienceRaw {{and refined}} flax, hemp, abaca, sisal, jute and ramie fibres are dipped into N-methylmorpholine N-oxide (NMMO) -water with various {{contents}} {{of water and}} into hydroxide sodium (NaOH) -water. The swelling and dissolution mechanisms of these plant fibres {{are similar to those}} observed for cotton and wood fibres. Disintegration into rod-like fragments, ballooning followed or not by dissolution and homogeneous swelling are all observed as for wood and cotton fibres, depending {{on the quality of the}} solvent. Balloons are not typical of wood and cotton and they seem to be present in all plant fibres. Another interesting result is that the helical feature seen on the balloon membrane is not related to the <b>microfibrillar</b> <b>angle.</b> Plant fibres are easier to dissolve than wood and cotton. This is not related to the molar mass of the cellulose chain. Raw plant fibres keeping most its non-cellulosic components do not show the formation of balloons...|$|E
40|$|Fique is a plant {{native of}} Colombia with fibers {{extracted}} from its leaves presenting relevant physical characteristics and mechanical properties for possible engineering applications, such as reinforcement of polymer composites. The main physico-mechanical {{properties of the}} fique fiber have already been investigated for both untreated and mechanically treated fibers. The statistical distribution of the fique fiber diameter was analyzed {{and the effect of}} <b>microfibrillar</b> <b>angle</b> on the tensile strength and elongation was determined. However, the correlation of mechanical properties with the fiber diameter is yet to be determined. Thus, the present work evaluated the tensile elastic modulus dependence of the fique fiber as a function of its diameter. By means of the Weibull statistical analysis, it was found that an inverse correlation adjusted the elastic modulus with the equivalent diameter through a hyperbolic type of mathematical relationship. Similar correlation have been found for several lignocellulosic fibers not only by the research group of the present work but also other international groups The results are compared and discussed...|$|E
30|$|However, {{in recent}} years {{barriers}} to conducting tests at the single-fiber level have been mainly overcome {{with the development of}} a new technique developed by the authors. Using this technique, Yu et al. [11] were able to measure the effect of MC on the mechanical properties of single Moso bamboo fibers of 4.5  years of age. They found that although an anticipated reduction in longitudinal tensile modulus (TE) and ultimate tensile strength (UTS) of bamboo fibers was clearly observed with rising MC, TE showed much less sensitivity to MC than UTS. Despite these initial findings, more experiments are needed to confirm whether this finding is applicable as a general rule. In this paper, we use our newly developed micro-tensile technique to extend studies on the effect of MC on single Moso bamboo fibers for fibers aged 0.5, 1.5 and 2.5  years. The study was conducted for MC ranging from 4.97 to about 26.2  %. Meanwhile, the <b>microfibrillar</b> <b>angle</b> (MFA) of these fibers were also tested and integrated into the discussion of the experimental results.|$|E
