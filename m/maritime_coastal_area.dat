40|$|This paper {{reports the}} {{development}} of the maritime module {{within the framework of the}} Transport and Environment Database System (TRENDS) project. A detailed database has been constructed for the calculation of energy consumption and air pollutant emissions. Based on an in-house database of commercial vessels kept at the Technical University of Denmark, relationships between the fuel consumption and size of different vessels have been developed, taking into account the fleet's age and service speed. The technical assumptions and factors incorporated in the database are presented, including changes from findings reported in Methodologies for Estimating air pollutant Emissions from Transport (MEET). The database operates on statistical data provided by Eurostat, which describe vessel and freight movements from and towards EU 15 major ports. Data are at port to <b>Maritime</b> <b>Coastal</b> <b>Area</b> (MCA) level, so a bottom-up approach is used. A port to MCA distance database has also been constructed for the purpose of the study. This was the first attempt to use Eurostat maritime statistics for emission modelling; and the problems encountered, since the statistical data collection was not undertaken with a view to this purpose, are mentioned. Examples of the results obtained by the database are presented. These include detailed air pollutant emission calculations for bulk carriers entering the port of Helsinki, as an example of the database operation, and aggregate results for different types of movements for France. Overall estimates of SOx and NOx emission caused by shipping traffic between the EU 15 countries are in the area of 1 and 1. 5 million tonnes, respectively...|$|E

40|$|Ship {{detection}} is {{an important}} topic for security and surveillance of <b>maritime</b> and <b>coastal</b> <b>areas.</b> A solution exploiting satellite SAR sensors is particularly interesting, because it offers wide scale surveillance capabilities, which are not reliant on solar illumination and are independent of the weather conditions ([1, 2, 3]). SAR polarimetry has a valuable contribution in improving ship detection capabilities ([2, 4]). The ship detection contribution in PolSAR-Ap aims at demonstrating the benefits of exploiting polarimetry compared to algorithms making use of one single channel. For this reason, several detectors were compared over surveyed data and the probabilities of detection and false alarm were estimated...|$|R
40|$|<b>Maritime</b> and <b>coastal</b> <b>areas</b> play an {{important}} role in the development of human activities and are a substantial influence on the economies of their respective hinterlands. Seas and coasts are among the most complex, vulnerable and sensitive to all natural ecosystems, and their management presents various problems and difficulties especially in our era of climate change in which coastal cities and populations face a range of serious threats (including rising sea levels). The singularity of these areas necessitates an equally singular handling of the issues of their land development and management. At the start of the 21 st century the critical issue of the spatial regulation and organization of the seas and coasts is a key priority for Greece and the Mediterranean in the era of climate change. There can be no doubt that the Mediterranean's <b>coastal</b> and marine <b>areas</b> are facing ever greater risks from natural disasters and human pressures alike. Given the experience of EU and UN programs and projects initiated and run by other international organizations which have shown that implementing sustainable spatial development in the coasts and seas is anything but easy, there is clearly a great need for coordinated action and co-operation at the transnational and international level. During the past decade the EU has adopted a strategy for the maritime environment which was incorporated in an Integrated Maritime Policy (IMP) (a European vision for the seas and the oceans). In the framework of the above policy the Commission launched in 2008 a road map for the Maritime Spatial Planning (MSP) as the basic means for the implementation of the (IMP) and a fundamental tool for the sustainable development of the European seas and coasts. The paper aims to investigate the effectiveness of the planning instruments and policies launched by the EU in relation to <b>maritime</b> and <b>coastal</b> <b>areas</b> and adopted by the competent public agencies and bodies in Greece and Mediterranean. Furthermore, the paper argues for the substantial implementation of the policy documents relating to Integrated Coastal Zone Management (ICZM) and the Spatial Maritime Planning in the framework of EU strategy for the Integrated Maritime Policy. © 2011 WIT Press...|$|R
40|$|Various {{atmospheric}} propagation effects are limiting the long range performance of electro-optical imaging systems. These effects include absorption and scattering by molecules and aerosols, refraction due to vertical temperature gradients and scintillation and blurring due to turbulence. In <b>maritime</b> and <b>coastal</b> <b>areas,</b> ranges up to 25 km are relevant for detection and classification tasks on small targets (missiles, pirates). From November 2009 to October 2010 a measurement campaign was set-up over {{a range of}} more than 15 km in the False Bay in South Africa, where all of the propagation effects could be investigated quantitatively. The results {{have been used to}} provide statistical information on basic parameters as visibility, air-sea temperature difference, absolute humidity and wind speed. In addition various propagation models on aerosol particle size distribution, temperature profile, blur and scintillation under strong turbulence conditions could be validated.

40|$|The growing menace of {{international}} {{terrorism and the}} increasing number of terroristic attacks have drawn attention to new and more complex types of threats. Those must be countered by the development of new imaging technologies for wide area surveillance {{as well as for the}} detection of concealed dangerous objects, in order to protect the human population and sensitive important infrastructures. The observation of a variety of security critical premises, borders, and <b>maritime</b> <b>coastal</b> <b>areas</b> for instance attracts the increasing attention of companies and authorities. Hence there is a strong demand on wide-field-of-view imaging for intruder detection under all adverse ambient conditions. Furthermore the imaging of persons for security purposes is of increasing interest particularly for airline and other transportation services or public events with large crowds. Therefore personnel inspection with respect to weapons and explosives becomes an important mean. Passive microwave remote sensing allows a daytime independent non-destructive observation and examination of the objects of interest under nearly all weather conditions without artificial exposure of persons and observation areas, hence fully avoiding health risks. The penetration capability of microwaves provides the detection of objects through atmospheric obstacles like bad weather, fog or dust, vapour and smoke, as well as through thin non-metallic materials and clothing. For the latter the detection of hidden objects like weapons, explosives, and contraband is possible by monitoring dielectric anomalies. Based on the physical principles of microwave radiometry, images have a quasi-optical appearance simplifying the image interpretation for the operator. In addition, the sensor operation is inherently passive and covert. Over years the DLR Microwaves and Radar Institute developed several problem-orientated radiometer imaging systems covering nearly the whole frequency spectrum between 1 GHz and 100 GHz for a multitude of applications. Mechanical linescanner systems, having a different field of view for far-field or near-field imaging, are used as experimental systems in order to investigate basic key parameters for the specific applications like suitable frequency band, required spatial resolution, and sensitivity. The different types of imaging systems are introduced and some typical measurement results are shown. Besides laboratory results, some measurements are discussed, which were recorded under nearly operational conditions like the surveillance of facilities and the personnel screening at a security checkpoint. ...|$|R
