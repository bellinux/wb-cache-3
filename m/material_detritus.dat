40|$|Abstract. Forests cover 30 % {{of global}} land area and {{maintain}} 73 % of global soil carbon {{which is important}} to the global carbon cycle. In forest ecosystem, climate was expected to affect {{the quality and quantity of}} environmental <b>materials</b> (<b>detritus)</b> inputs to soil and soil chemical and physical processes which then affected carbon storage technically. Thus, altitude provided a wonderful site for this environmental research. We collected five soils along the altitudinal gradient on the Changbai Mountain in the North Temperate Zone to analyze the soil properties and carbon content. The results showed the highest SOC content was observed at lowest altitude for the larger plants residues (environmental materials). Except the lowest altitude, the amount of SOC increased with altitude for the low decomposition under the cold temperature. Multiple environmental factors (such as soil type, topography and vegetation) were thought to regulate SOC technically...|$|R

40|$|The Mngazana and Mngazi {{estuaries}} {{are situated}} {{just south of}} Port St. Johns close to the biogeographical boundary between the warm temperate and subtropical zones along {{the east coast of}} Southern Africa. The Mngazana estuary is a permanently open estuary with three species of mangrove. The Mngazi estuary is a temporarily open/closed system. The ichthyofauna was sampled with seine nets and gillnets during June 2005, August 2005, November 2005, February 2006 and April 2006. The fish community structure was significantly different between the two estuaries with the differences being especially noticeable in the larger fish sampled with gillnets. There were significant differences in the fish community sampled with the seine net on both spatial and temporal scales in both of the estuaries. Certain warm temperate species were less abundant and certain subtropical species were more abundant at the Mngazana estuary than they were during a study conducted in 1975. Stomach content analysis revealed that most species had similar diets in the two estuaries with the only differences occurring among benthic feeding species. The diet of sub-adult piscivores comprised of a large proportion of penaeid prawns while the juveniles feed mainly on mysids. The zooplanktivorous fish feed mainly on copepods and mysids with the proportions varying between the species. Benthic feeding fishes showed the greatest variability in diet with plant <b>material,</b> <b>detritus,</b> crabs and copepods being the main food sources. Stable isotopes revealed that particulate organic matter and microphytobenthos were the most important carbon sources to fish in the Mngazi estuary. In the Mngazana estuary a combination of mangrove <b>material,</b> <b>detritus,</b> particulate organic matter and Zostera material were the most important carbon sources. The importance of each of these sources did, however, vary greatly between the different trophic guilds of the fish in the Mngazana estuary. The distribution of certain fish species was investigated in relation to physical parameters (temperature, salinity, turbidity and depth) and biological parameters (prey and predators) in the environment. It was found that most small fish (< 100 mm SL) were strongly correlated with turbidity where-as they showed weak correlations with their prey. Sub-adult piscivores fell into two groups, i. e. those that could tolerate turbid water and those that were only found in clear water. The group that also occurred in turbid water showed very strong correlations with their prey but the clear water group did not. It would appear that the small and thus vulnerable fish seemed to occur in areas that offered them protection rather than areas where their food supply is most abundant, where-as the piscivores were more influenced by prey distribution, as long as the physical conditions were tolerable to them...|$|E

40|$|This {{paper is}} devoted to the study of food chain models under batch and {{chemostat}} conditions where nutrient recycling is taken into account. The food chain is formed by a nutrient and two populations, prey and predator (producers and consumers). Species at both trophic levels digest their food source only partly. The unusable part of the food is ejected in the reactor as faeces together with metabolic products. The excreted material together with death <b>material,</b> <b>detritus,</b> is decomposed and this gives the recycling of the nutrient. In closed (batch-type environment) systems the elemental matter needed by producers must be provided through recycling where light energy from the environment supplies the necessary energy that fuels the life processes. In open (chemostat-type environment) systems this energy is added to the system via the chemical energy stored in the organic compounds in the inflow. Bifurcation analysis is used to study the effects of material recycling on the long-term dynamic behaviour of these simple food chains. An aggregation method is developed for situations in which each trophic level is characterized by differing time scales. This allows us to reduce the dimension of the model which gives good approximations after the fast transient. We will show that first-order approximations are needed {{in order to get the}} same qualitative long-term dynamics for both the full an...|$|E

The analysis of the stomach contents {{was based on the}} volumetric frequency (VF%) and frequency of occurrence (FO%), combined with the feeding index (FI). Nine different dietary items were identified: detritus, plant fragments, zooplankton, arthropods, chlorophytes, bacillariophytes, cyanobacteria, dinophytes, and unidentified <b>material.</b> <b>Detritus</b> was the principal component of the diet during both seasons, with all the other items representing only complementary or accidental portions of the diets of both species. Niche breadth was low overall, but slightly greater in H. plecostomus in comparison with H. emarginatus.  Niche overlap was accentuated in both seasons, which indicates that seasonality is not a major factor influencing the characteristics of the niches of these species, possibly because of the marked abundance of detritus in the study area, specifically in the impounded sector. The two species can be characterized as detritivores, which share dietary resources with no clear evidence of any negative effects of interspecific competition on the coexistence of the two populations.   Keywords: feeding ecology, niche breadth, Araguarí river, Amazonia.   DOI: [URL]...|$|E
30|$|While {{nutrients}} play {{an important}} role in DIC production and C turnover, hydrologic conditions also play a significant role in the cycling and production of organic C within wetlands. Dissolved organic C was negatively correlated with stage elevation, suggesting a possible dilution of DOC within marshes (Table  4). Lu et al. 2003 observed a similar correlation with DOC in the southern portion of Everglades National Park (ENP), suggesting that rainfall diluted DOC concentrations as water levels increase along flow transects within the Everglades system. This process has also been demonstrated in other forested and wetland ecosystems (Fraser et al. 2001; Kawasaki et al. 2005; Ågren et al. 2007). Some studies have attributed this decrease in DOC being caused by flushing and export of DOC from the system as seen in forested ecosystems (Inamdar et al. 2004). Additionally, Lu et al. 2003 observed that canal inflow water is a major source of dissolved organic matter in wetlands, the majority of which is DOC. As the canal surface water flows penetrated through the marsh, DOC is leached from periphyton, vegetation, senescent plant <b>material,</b> <b>detritus,</b> and soil which increased the marsh DOC concentrations. The strong correlation between DOC and specific conductance provides evidence towards this DOC dynamic (Table  4). Using radioisotopes, Stern et al. 2007 determined that DOC turnover rates are typically longer than the wetland water residence time, suggesting that most of the DOC will persist in the water column as the water flows. Therefore, the temporal and spatial variation in marsh DOC concentrations and to some extent POC concentrations are driven in part by the source of water and factors contributing to the flux of DOC from ecosystem components to the overlying water column.|$|E

40|$|This study takes {{a network}} {{approach}} to understanding complex biological systems. The overall {{objective is to}} explore how the stability and flexibility of biological networks emerge from underlying structural and dynamical characteristics. The thesis is arranged as a journey into the complexity of biological network models. The starting point is qualitative structural network descriptions. The level of detail in the dynamical description of node properties is then gradually increased. Along this journey, new features, both structural and dynamical, are revealed as crucial for the function of biological networks. A set of constructional properties are defined: structural principles, structural complexity, interaction diversity, node diversity and network density. These constructional properties capture {{important aspects of the}} structural organization and dynamic mechanisms in biological networks. A set of functional properties are defined: structural robustness, structural cyclicity, dynamic stability and dynamic flexibility. These functional properties are systemic properties that are all related to the stability of biological networks. These two sets of properties are used to demonstrate how the construction of biological networks is crucial for their function. The general theory is applied to food web and neural network models, where the general network properties are given specific biological meanings. The studies within both fields have their system specific objectives. A simple food web model is developed for explicitly including a compartment for dead organic <b>material</b> (<b>detritus).</b> Several constructional properties are revealed as crucial for the structural robustness, the structural cyclicity and the dynamic stability of food webs. The pathways due to decomposing and recycling of detritus alter the constructional properties, and are crucial for food web function. Computational neural network models are developed for clinical applications. Possible mechanisms behind electroconvulsive treatment (ECT) and anaesthetics are modelled. Clinical observations are qualitatively reproduced. Several aspects of the constructional properties of neural networks are revealed as crucial for optimal stability and flexibility of neurodynamics...|$|E

As amostragens foram {{realizadas}} em dois períodos, 1992 / 1993 e 1994 / 1995, em coletas mensais, e sazonalmente no período 2001 / 2002. As capturas foram efetivadas com redes de espera simples com malhas entre 2 a 12 cm. Foram analisados 993 exemplares. Os itens alimentares identificados foram agrupados em categorias e analisados pelo método da composição percentual. A composição da dieta foi comparada entre os períodos de amostragens e entre trechos, pela análise de similaridade usando o coeficiente de Bray-Curtis. Os resultados indicaram que em todos os períodos e em todos os trechos houve uniformidade no consumo dos tipos de itens alimentares. Os itens encontrados foram agrupados em seis categorias: peixes, camarão, Odonata, Ephemeroptera, outros grupos de insetos e outros (material vegetal, detritos e organismos, raramente encontrados). Em todos os trechos e em todas as épocas analisadas, P. squamosissimus se manteve como carnívora, e no período 2001 / 2002 o item camarão (Macrobrachium amazonicum) foi o de maior participação em sua dieta. Concomitante com o fato de a corvina trocar de alimento substituindo peixes por camarão, mudou o comportamento quanto à freqüência na tomada de alimento e na variedade de tipos de itens consumidos. Quando P. squamosissimus utiliza camarão, maior número de indivíduos são encontrados nos estômagos, na maioria dos casos com apenas este tipo de item. Plagioscion squamosissimus (Heckel, 1840) was {{studied in}} five stretches in Paranapanema and Tibagi rivers {{under the influence}} of the Capivara reservoir. The samplings were made on a monthly basis during the 1992 / 1993 and 1994 / 1995 periods and seasonally during the 2001 / 2002 period. The captures were made with gillnets with meshes varying between 2 and 12 cm. A total of 993 specimens had their stomach analyzed. The identified food items were grouped in trophic categories and analyzed by the percent composition method. The diet composition was compared among sampling periods and among stretches by the similarity analysis using the Bray-Curtis' coefficient. The results indicated that the consumption of food items was uniform in all periods and stretches analysed. The food items found were grouped in six categories: fishes, shrimp, Odonata, Ephemeroptera, other insect groups and "others" (plant <b>material,</b> <b>detritus</b> and rarely-found organisms).

Concomitant with the shift from fish to shrimp, there were also changes in feeding behavior, shown by the changes in feeding frequency in food taking and in the variety of consumed food items. A large number of prey individuals were found in the stomach contents when P. squamosissimus fed on shrimp, with most specimens feeding exclusively on this food item...|$|E
40|$|Dicyandiamide (DCD) is an {{effective}} nitrification inhibitor and can reduce nitrate (NO₃⁻) leaching losses and nitrous oxide (N₂O) gas emissions from soil. In New Zealand DCD was primarily used on dairy farms in the aim of reducing the environmental impact associated with NO₃⁻ leaching from dairy cow urine patches which can load the soil with up to 1000 kg N ha⁻¹. In soil, DCD {{is known to be}} degraded by soil microorganisms, but it also {{has the potential to be}} leached. As no literature exists on the degradation of DCD in waterways the purpose of this research was to investigate DCD degradation in a lowland Canterbury stream, and to identify factors which affect DCD degradation in waterways. This research involved a laboratory based mesocosm experiment comprising of four treatments, with three replicates of each, to simulate different waterway environments. The four treatments were; aerated stream water, aerated stream water with an undisturbed sediment base, aerated stream water containing plant material with an undisturbed sediment base, and anaerobic stream water with an undisturbed sediment base. Water, sediment, and plant material collected from the LII stream near Lincoln, New Zealand, was used for the experiment. Each mesocosm contained a depth of 75 cm of stream water with the concentrations of ammonium (NH₄⁺) and DCD, which were added to each mesocosm at a concentration of 1 mg L⁻¹, being monitored over time. Over the 40 day experiment DCD was not degraded in the aerated stream water treatment. In the three sediment containing treatments DCD was degraded with degradation occurring most rapidly in the aerated stream water with a sediment base treatment in which 25. 8 % of the added DCD being degraded, corresponding to a DCD half-life of 99 days. With the addition of plant material in the aerated stream water containing plant material with a sediment base treatment DCD degradation was slightly lower with 23. 0 % of the added DCD being degraded, corresponding to a DCD half-life of 139 days. This slightly slower degradation rate may be attributed to decomposing plant material providing an alternative, more accessable, source of nitrogen (N) to sediment microbes, or the accumulation of plant <b>material</b> <b>detritus</b> on the sediment surface may have reduced the incidence of DCD contacting sediment micoorganisms. Anaerobic conditions caused DCD degradation to be reduced to 20. 4 % of added DCD over 40 days, corresponding to a DCD half-life of 175 days. However, an artefact occurred in this treatment as anaerobic conditions were not constantly maintained due to ongoing photosynthetic activity in the mesocosms. The temperature (12. 3 - 19. 4 ˚C) and pH (7. 4 - 9. 5) range the treatments were subjected to in this experiment did not affect DCD degradation. In the experiment all of the added NH₄⁺-N was nitrified or removed from the stream water in each treatment within 10 - 25 days of addition. Therefore, it can be concluded that at concentrations of up to 1 mg L⁻¹ DCD does not inhibit nitrification in waterways and will not cause an accumulation of NH₃...|$|E

40|$|High {{resolution}} {{measurements of}} concentration and grain size dependent magnetic parameters along a sedimentary sequence deposited on the Portuguese margin (38 degrees N) {{during the last}} 120 ka allowed the detection of multiple thin layers slightly enriched by a coarse lithogenic fraction. Sizes, mineralogy, shapes and mode of deposition identify the <b>material</b> as ice-rafted <b>detritus</b> (IRD). The four most recent events dated by calibrated radiocarbon ages are contemporaneous with Heinrich events HE 1 -HE 4. Older events can be identified as HE 5, HE 6 or with minor IRD that occurred during stage 5, The resolution and sensitivity obtained with rock magnetic methods enable the detection of multiple secondary events showing that iceberg delivery was a frequent phenomenon directly linked to temperature variations over ice caps; Heinrich events representing the extreme cases.
