2500|$|The [...] "golden century" [...] {{from its}} {{founding}} in 1531 until the early 1600s saw Puebla's agricultural sector flourish, with small-scale Spanish farmers plowing the land for the first time, planting wheat and vaulting Puebla to importance as New Spain's breadbasket, a role assumed by the Bajío (including Querétaro) in the seventeenth century, and Guadalajara in the eighteenth. Puebla's wheat production was the initial element of its prosperity, but it emerged as a manufacturing and commercial center, [...] "serving as the inland port of <b>Mexico's</b> <b>Atlantic</b> trade."

40|$|This {{document}} examines catch rate {{series for}} several groupings/species of sharks from the Commercial Shark Fishery Observer Program (CSFOP) {{for the period}} 1994 - 2004 : all species in the originally defined large coastal shark (LCS) complex (22 species), the LCS complex without prohibited species (11 species), and the LCS complex without prohibited species or blacktip or sandbar sharks (9 species). Additionally, separate analyses were conducted for the sandbar shark and for the blacktip shark (Gulf of <b>Mexico,</b> <b>Atlantic,</b> and the two areas combined). All series were subjected to a Generalized Linear Model (GLM) standardization technique that adjusts for factors that affect relative abundance. The approach used to estimate relative abundance indices is a Generalized Linear Mixed Model that treats separately the proportion of sets with positive catches (i. e., where at least one shark was caught) assuming a binomial error distribution with a logit link function, and the catch rates of sets with positive catches assuming a Poisson error distribution with a log lin...|$|E

40|$|There are 2 {{species of}} spotted dolphin in the Atlantic Ocean, the Atlantic spotted dolphin (Stenella frontalis) and the {{pantropical spotted dolphin}} (S. attenuata) (Perrin et al. 1987). The Atlantic spotted dolphin occurs in 2 forms which may be {{distinct}} sub-species (Perrin et al. 1987, 1994; Rice 1998) : the large, heavily spotted form which inhabits the continental shelf and is usually found inside or near the 200 m isobath; and the smaller, less spotted island and offshore form which occurs in the Atlantic Ocean but is not known {{to occur in the}} Gulf of Mexico (Fulling et al. 2003; Mullin and Fulling 2003; Mullin and Fulling 2004). Where they co-occur, the offshore form of the Atlantic spotted dolphin and the pantropical spotted dolphin can be difficult to differentiate at sea.

40|$|The {{breakup of}} Pangaea and {{formation}} of the Atlantic and Indian Oceans and the marginal seas has an important influence on the global geochemistry of sediments. The initial rifting phases may have resulted in deposition of extensive fresh water lake deposits with high organic carbon contents so that these sediments may contain as much as 1 / 8 of the earth's sedimentary organic carbon. Flooding of the developing rifts by the sea and extensive deposition of evaporites followed. The present estimate {{of a total of}} 10. 5 x 10 super(6) km super(3) of evaporite deposits beneath the floor of the Gulf of <b>Mexico,</b> <b>Atlantic</b> Ocean, Red Sea and Mediterranean Sea has doubled the known quantity of evaporites.
