50|$|<b>Monetary</b> <b>compensatory</b> <b>amounts</b> (MCAs) were border {{measures}} in the EU consisting of taxes and subsidies formerly applicable to intra-EC trade in agricultural and food products for which intervention prices were set. These {{border measures}} were made necessary {{by the fact that}} intervention prices were set in ECUs and converted into national currency terms at green rates, set at levels different from commercial market rates. This gave rise to price differentials between member nations (in market ECUs) that would influence intra-EC trade if not offset by the MCAs. The system worked by subsidizing exports (and taxing imports) from strong-currency countries, and taxing exports (subsidizing imports) from weak- currency countries.|$|E

The model incorporates nonintegrable feed grain demand functions which were estimated using a pseudodata approach based {{on a set of}} representative least-cost LP models of compound feed production in the EC. The price and quantity impacts of three "rebalancing" EC policies are investigated within a comparative statics framework: the abolition of the green rates or <b>Monetary</b> <b>Compensatory</b> <b>Amounts</b> (MCA) system, a 10 % cut in support prices for EC grains, and a 10 % tax on the use of imported cereal substitutes. Both "short-run" (constant livestock output) and "long-run" (variable livestock output) results are reported at the EC level. ...|$|E

Participants were exposed to one of four fictional newspaper reports about a sexual assault in which the victim was described as either: (a) a non-transsexual male, (b) a non-transsexual female, (c) a transsexual female-to-male, or (d) a transsexual male-to-female. Participants were asked to: (1) recommend a prison sentence for the perpetrator (range = 0 – 10 years), and (2) recommend a civil / <b>monetary</b> <b>compensatory</b> award to the victim (range = $ 0 –$ 100, 000). Results showed {{no significant difference in}} prison sentence and victim compensation for transsexual or non-transsexual victims and for male or female victims. However, male participants were found to recommend significantly longer prison sentences for the perpetrator and lower compensation amounts for the victim. Results also indicated that social dominance orientation moderated the sex difference in prison sentences, but not for victim compensation amounts.

40|$|In a model {{where all}} banks are {{initially}} solvent, an exogenous shock affects confidence, causing {{a flight from}} deposits into domestic and foreign currency. Real interest rates increase unexpectedly, affecting firms and raising {{the share of the}} banks’ nonperforming assets. This increase causes genuine solvency problems and accelerates the bank run. Policy simulations show that <b>compensatory</b> <b>monetary</b> policy (increasing currency supply when deposits fall) mitigates the bank run but causes inflation and external imbalances.

A classical game theory approach (fishwar model) is revisited to take into consideration the macroeconomic dependence of developing countries and identify the theoretical conditions (time preferences, compensatory payment level, negotiation leadership) under which the stock can increase and the countries share the resources.

2500|$|A twelve-person jury {{reached its}} verdict on August 18, 1994. [...] Applying the {{principles}} of comparative negligence, the jury found that McDonald's was 80% responsible for the incident and Liebeck was 20% at fault. Though there was a warning on the coffee cup, the jury decided that the warning was neither large enough nor sufficient. They awarded Liebeck $200,000 in compensatory damages, which was then reduced by 20% to $160,000. In addition, they awarded her $2.7 million in punitive damages. The jurors apparently arrived at this figure from Morgan's suggestion to penalize McDonald's {{for one or two}} days' worth of coffee revenues, which were about $1.35 million per day. The judge reduced punitive damages to $480,000, three times the <b>compensatory</b> <b>amount,</b> for a total of $640,000. The decision was appealed by both McDonald's and Liebeck in December 1994, but the parties settled out of court for an undisclosed amount less than $600,000.|$|R

40|$|Towards a new labor {{model in}} Spain The article starts with {{confirming}} the acceleration process in reforms of labor regulations-intensive and extensive-which is faced bySpain that has considered even {{the reform of}} constitutional framework. It {{should be noted that}} measures taken in the Spanish reform are aimed at increasing the employability of workers and with regard to promotion of employment stability; we find the incorporation of a new contractual modality, literally called “employment contract for indefinite time to support entrepreneurs”. Meanwhile, as the most important novelties are located the following: elimination with general character of administrative authorization for collective dismissals, the expansion of the proper reasons of economic dismissals, with the corresponding reduction effect of the judicial control as justification for business measure and the possible reduction in the practice of dismissal cost, the generalization of <b>compensatory</b> <b>amount</b> for unfair dismissal after 33 days of salary per year of seniority with limit of the 24 monthly salary, the complete suppression of processing salaries when the employer chooses indemnified extinction in case of unfair dismissal, among others.

40|$|Plants {{contain a}} nuclear gene family for plastid sigma factors, i. e. {{proteins}} that {{associate with the}} bacterial-type organellar RNA polymerase and confer the ability for correct promoter binding and transcription initiation. Questions that are still unresolved relate to the division of labour {{among members of the}} sigma family, both in terms of their range of target genes and their temporal and spatial activity during development. Clues to the in vivo role of individual sigma genes have mainly come from studies of sigma knockout lines. Despite its obvious strengths, however, this strategy does not necessarily trace-down causal relationships between mutant phenotype and a single sigma gene, if other family members act in a redundant and/or compensatory manner. We made efforts to reduce the complexity by genetic crosses of Arabidopsis single mutants (with focus on a chlorophyll-deficient sig 6 line) to generate double knockout lines. The latter typically had a similar visible phenotype as the parental lines, but tended to be more strongly affected in the transcript patterns of both plastid and sigma genes. Because triple mutants were lethal under our growth conditions, we exploited a strategy of transformation of single and double mutants with RNAi constructs that contained sequences from the unconserved sigma region (UCR). These RNAi/knockout lines phenotypically resembled their parental lines, but were even more strongly affected in their plastid transcript patterns. Expression patterns of sigma genes revealed both similarities and differences compared to the parental lines, with transcripts at reduced or unchanged amounts and others that were found to be present in higher (perhaps <b>compensatory)</b> <b>amounts.</b> Together, our results reveal considerable flexibility of gene activity at the levels of both sigma and plastid gene expression. A (still viable) basal state seems to be reached, if 2 - 3 of the 6 Arabidopsis sigma genes are functionally compromised...|$|R

40|$|In an {{important}} article, Calabresi and Melamed distinguish two different techniques for protecting legal entitlements. One {{they call a}} 2 ̆ 2 property 2 ̆ 2 rule {{and the other a}} 2 ̆ 2 liability 2 ̆ 2 rule. According to Calabresi and Melamed, a right or entitlement is protected by a property rule when it can be appropriated by a non-owner only if he first purchases permission to do so from the owner of the right. When a right is protected by a rule of this sort, one who appropriates it without the owner 2 ̆ 7 s permission will always be subject to a special sanction—typically, a fine or imprisonment. If a right is protected by a liability rule, in contrast, a non-owner who unilaterally appropriates it need only compensate the owner, after the taking, for any loss the owner suffers. The <b>compensatory</b> <b>amount</b> which a nonowner must pay for taking a right protected by a liability rule is set by a representative of the state rather than by the owner of the right in a voluntary transaction between owner and taker. Calabresi and Melamed attempt to explain why some legal entitlements are protected by a property rule and others by a liability rule. They suggest that in certain cases the cost of negotiating the voluntary transfer of a right may be sufficiently high to frustrate the transfer. Where this is so, a property rule, which is intended to encourage transfers of this sort, is likely to promote an inefficient allocation of resources. This point is illustrated by automobile accidents and pollution torts. In both cases, a voluntary transfer of entitlements is almost certain to be prohibitively expensive: {{in the case of an}} automobile accident because of the cost of identifying the victim beforehand, and in the case of pollution torts because of freerider and hold-out complications which are likely to make any negotiated settlement enormously difficult and time-consuming...|$|R

The case was settled for an undisclosed sum while on appeal {{to the supreme court}} of California. In 2016 a UK judge upheld a ruling against the Jehovah's Witnesses for failing to protect a victim of child sexual abuse, and the supreme court rejected an attempt by the Watch Tower Society to block a Charity Commission inquiry into how the organisation's charity handles allegations of abuse.

40|$|This project {{investigates the}} {{relationship}} between guilt and moral compensation, or pursuing morally positive behavior following morally suspect behavior. Additionally, the current research seeks to examine whether interpersonal, relational motives or intrapersonal, self-focused motives drive this relationship. In Study 1, participants recalled a moral transgression or a neutral memory; they then rated their guilt and completed a <b>compensatory</b> <b>monetary</b> donation task (or vice versa). Guilt was lower after the compensatory task, particularly for participants who had recalled a transgression, suggesting that compensatory behavior can mitigate guilt. Pre-compensatory guilt also significantly predicted the decision to donate. Study 2 manipulated the anonymity of both the transgression and the compensatory opportunity in order to probe the interpersonal versus intrapersonal mechanisms of guilt and moral compensation. Guilt and donations were higher for known than unknown transgressions, but were unaffected by compensation anonymity, supporting both interpersonal and intrapersonal mechanisms. The link between transgression anonymity and donations was fully mediated by guilt, indicating that guilt motivates subsequent compensatory behavior. Together, {{the results of these}} studies illustrate that guilt affects and is affected by compensatory behavior. Further research may help clarify the mechanisms behind this relationship...|$|R

Department of Energy (DOE) sites under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA), as amended. DOE is the CERCLA lead response agency for these activities. Section 120 of CERCLA also could subject DOE to liability for natural resource damages resulting from hazardous substance releases at its sites. A Natural Resource Damage Assessment (NRDA) process is used to determine whether natural resources have been injured and to calculate <b>compensatory</b> <b>monetary</b> damages {{to be used to}} restore the natural resources.
