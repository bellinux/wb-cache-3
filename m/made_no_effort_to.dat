5|$|Jacob <b>made</b> <b>no</b> <b>effort</b> <b>to</b> solicit {{members for}} his commune other than through his {{newspapers}} and sometimes rejected applicants {{when he felt}} they were not fit candidates. The commune attracted only about a dozen residents – mostly from outside the Ohio area.|$|E
5|$|The Cheshire police {{response}} to the bank's report began with assessing the situation and setting up a vehicle perimeter, without revealing their presence. The police remained outside {{for more than half}} an hour, taking these preliminary measures, while the assailants were raping and murdering the women inside the house. The police dawdled at the scene, and <b>made</b> <b>no</b> <b>effort</b> <b>to</b> make the assailants aware of their presence.|$|E

50|$|The {{destruction}} of these neighborhoods with little warning or {{effort on the}} part of the city to provide housing assistance was catastrophic for the African American community in Detroit. Families on highway sites received only thirty-day notices to vacate and the commission <b>made</b> <b>no</b> <b>efforts</b> <b>to</b> assist families in relocation.|$|R
5|$|Tiberius {{seems to}} have tired of {{politics}} at this point. In AD22, he shared his tribunician authority with his son Drusus, and began making yearly excursions to Campania that reportedly became longer and longer every year. In AD23, Drusus mysteriously died, and Tiberius {{seems to have}} <b>made</b> <b>no</b> <b>effort</b> <b>to</b> elevate a replacement. Finally, in AD26, Tiberius retired from Rome altogether to the island of Capri.|$|E
5|$|McCracken, {{who came}} to Hollywood after winning acclaim in the 1943 {{production}} of Oklahoma!, was deeply discouraged by her experiences filming the Hollywood Canteen number and did not like working with Prinz. As a choreographer he <b>made</b> <b>no</b> <b>effort</b> <b>to</b> integrate his dances into specific story lines, or to choreograph specific dance steps. This resulted deep disillusionment for McCracken, whose Oklahoma! dances were choreographed by Agnes de Mille, since Prinz {{was not able to}} support or advance McCracken's artistic development. However, he gave her latitude to incorporate ballet in her dance routine, and Prinz did not object to her ideas.|$|E
5|$|Beliefs in {{the divine}} and in the afterlife were {{ingrained}} in ancient Egyptian civilization from its inception; pharaonic rule {{was based on the}} divine right of kings. The Egyptian pantheon was populated by gods who had supernatural powers and were called on for help or protection. However, the gods were not always viewed as benevolent, and Egyptians believed they had to be appeased with offerings and prayers. The structure of this pantheon changed continually as new deities were promoted in the hierarchy, but priests <b>made</b> <b>no</b> <b>effort</b> <b>to</b> organize the diverse and sometimes conflicting myths and stories into a coherent system. These various conceptions of divinity were not considered contradictory but rather layers in the multiple facets of reality.|$|E
50|$|Protestant churches {{also were}} vandalized. On Easter Sunday 2007 several churches in Sarajevo were burglarized and {{documents}} about the congregation, specifically {{the lists of}} those who had been baptized, were stolen. Some churches faced repeated break-ins and complained that the local police <b>made</b> <b>no</b> <b>efforts</b> <b>to</b> find those responsible but instead intimidated church officials by calling them in for lengthy interrogations.|$|R
50|$|The {{third angle}} to the Nepal MP's killing, the {{intelligence}} report states, related to Shafi Mohammad Khan of Krishnanagar who was arrested in a narcotics case by the Nepal Police in Mumbai. Like Babloo Srivastava, he too was of the view that Mirza had <b>made</b> <b>no</b> <b>efforts</b> <b>to</b> secure his release after arrest nor was he extended sufficient help during his trial.|$|R
50|$|Thomas Dewey was {{governor}} of New York when he received the Democratic nomination for President in 1944. He and his running mate Harry S. Truman of Missouri defeat the incumbent Charles W. La Follette. His victory is partially attributed to {{pointing out that the}} CSA was able to regain strength and attack the United States on the watch of three Socialist Presidents (conveniently downplaying Democrat Herbert Hoover, who <b>made</b> <b>no</b> <b>efforts</b> <b>to</b> stop the Confederacy).|$|R
5|$|During World War I, she bombarded German fortifications {{during the}} Siege of Tsingtao. The Japanese {{government}} sold Tango {{back to the}} Russians at their request in 1916. She was renamed Chesma (Чесма) as her former name {{had been given to}} a new ship. En route to the White Sea, she joined an Allied force that persuaded the Greek government to disarm their ships. Her crew declared for the Bolsheviks in October 1917, but <b>made</b> <b>no</b> <b>effort</b> <b>to</b> resist when the British decided to intervene in the Russian Civil War in early 1918. In poor condition, the ship was used as a prison hulk. Abandoned by the British when they withdrew in 1919 and recaptured by the Bolsheviks, she was scrapped in 1924.|$|E
5|$|Even {{though the}} last four decades of PedroII's reign were marked by {{continuous}} internal peace and economic prosperity, he had no desire to see the monarchy survive beyond his lifetime and <b>made</b> <b>no</b> <b>effort</b> <b>to</b> maintain support for the institution. The next in line to the throne was his daughter Isabel, but neither PedroII nor the ruling classes considered a female monarch acceptable. Lacking any viable heir, the Empire's political leaders saw no reason to defend the monarchy. After a 58-year reign, on 15 November 1889 the Emperor was overthrown in a sudden coup d'état led by a clique of military leaders whose goal was the formation of a republic headed by a dictator, forming the First Brazilian Republic.|$|E
5|$|Parma <b>made</b> <b>no</b> <b>effort</b> <b>to</b> {{restrain}} his soldiers. On their rampage {{through the}} city, Italian and Spanish soldiers slaughtered {{the rest of}} the garrison, even the men who tried to surrender. Once their blood-lust was satiated, they began to plunder. Civilians who had taken refuge in the churches were initially ignored, but when the fire started, they were forced into the streets and trapped by the rampaging soldiers. Contemporary accounts refer to children, women, and old men, their clothes smoldering, or in flames, trying to escape the conflagration, only to be trapped by the enraged Spanish; if they escaped the flames and the Spanish, they were cornered by the enraged Italians. Parma wrote to King Philip that over 4000lay dead in the ditches (moats). English observers confirmed this report, and elaborated that only eight buildings remained standing.|$|E
50|$|The Day of the Jackal was {{originally}} {{part of a}} two-picture deal between John Woolf and Fred Zinnemann, the other being an adaptation of the play Abelard and Heloise by Ronald Millar. Although the story takes place in 1962 and 1963, the filmmakers <b>made</b> <b>no</b> <b>efforts</b> <b>to</b> avoid showing car models whose production began later, for example Peugeot 504 (built from 1968), Renault 12 (built from 1969), a Fiat 128 (1969), and an orange Volkswagen Bus, circa 1973.|$|R
50|$|Less {{than a month}} later, however, {{apparently}} Li again {{insisted on}} Wei becoming chancellor again. This time, the task of drafting the edict was assigned to a different imperial scholar, Yao Ji. In contravention to the usual custom of initially declining the commission and then accepting it, Wei <b>made</b> <b>no</b> <b>efforts</b> <b>to</b> decline, and instead immediately submitted a petition thanking the emperor for the commission. He resumed his chancellor office the next day. He died in late 902.|$|R
50|$|The {{military}} government and President Yahya himself <b>made</b> <b>no</b> <b>efforts</b> <b>to</b> frame a constitution, aside from issuing the extrajudicial order in 1970. Across the country, the expectations were that a National Assembly {{would be set}} up by holding a free and fair election. To hold the proposed elections, President Yahya promulgated a Legal Framework Order on 30 March 1970 that also spelled out the fundamental principles of the proposed constitution and the structure and composition of the national and provincial assemblies.|$|R
5|$|The British gunfire became {{increasingly}} accurate, and by 16:00, Scharnhorst {{had begun to}} list badly, while fires raged aboard the ship. Spee ordered Gneisenau to try to disengage while he turned Scharnhorst toward his attackers {{in an attempt to}} launch torpedoes at them. At 16:17, Scharnhorst capsized and sank, taking her entire crew with her, including Spee. The British, still focused on Gneisenau, <b>made</b> <b>no</b> <b>effort</b> <b>to</b> rescue survivors. Gneisenau, Leipzig, and Nürnberg were also sunk. Only Dresden managed to escape, but she was eventually tracked to the Juan Fernández Islands and sunk. The complete destruction of the squadron killed about 2,200 German sailors and officers, including both of Spee's sons; Heinrich died aboard Gneisenau, and Otto was killed aboard Nürnberg.|$|E
5|$|The Dutch were ill-prepared {{to resist}} such an invasion. When Hitler came to power, the Dutch {{had begun to}} re-arm, but more slowly than France or Belgium; only in 1936 did the defence budget start to be {{gradually}} increased. Successive Dutch governments tended to avoid openly identifying Germany as an acute military threat. Partly this {{was caused by a}} wish not to antagonise a vital trade partner, {{even to the point of}} repressing criticism of Nazi policies; partly it was made inevitable by a policy of strict budgetary limits with which the conservative Dutch governments tried in vain to fight the Great Depression, which hit Dutch society particularly hard. Hendrikus Colijn, prime minister between 1933 and 1939, was personally convinced Germany would not violate Dutch neutrality; senior officers <b>made</b> <b>no</b> <b>effort</b> <b>to</b> mobilise public opinion in favour of improving military defence.|$|E
5|$|The {{receiver}} {{offered the}} barn to Hillingdon Council and English Heritage for £1, but both refused the offer. Instead, a Gibraltar-based company calling itself Harmondsworth Barn Ltd bought the barn. The company {{had no other}} assets and {{it was reported that}} it was seeking to speculate on obtaining compensation from a proposed expansion of Heathrow Airport. Such compensation would be paid should the land be required and the property demolished, although the barn fell just slightly outside the area required for a new runway. The new owners <b>made</b> <b>no</b> <b>effort</b> <b>to</b> maintain the barn, which fell into disrepair and was closed to the public apart from an annual one-day opening in conjunction with the Open House Weekend each September.|$|E

25|$|In 1856, the Texas Veterans Association began {{lobbying}} {{the state}} legislature to create a memorial {{to the men who}} died during the Texas Revolution. The legislature <b>made</b> <b>no</b> <b>efforts</b> <b>to</b> commemorate the final battle of the revolution until the 1890s, when funds were finally appropriated to purchase the land where the Battle of San Jacinto took place. After a careful survey to determine the boundaries of the original battle site, land was purchased for a new state park east of Houston, in 1897. This became San Jacinto Battleground State Historic Site.|$|R
5|$|After docking in Kiel, the {{men from}} Asar-i Tevfik were {{transferred}} to İzmir, but with no funds to buy coal, the men were stranded in Germany. Germaniawerft stripped down Asar-i Tevfik, but then halted work to await the first Ottoman payment. By mid-1901, the men had accumulated significant debt and the Ottoman government had <b>made</b> <b>no</b> <b>effort</b> <b>to</b> return them or pay the installments for the modernization program. Even Kaiser Wilhelm II became involved {{in an attempt to}} press the Ottoman government to settle the debts incurred by the sailors. Instead, the Ottomans demanded that Krupp, the owner of the Germaniawerft shipyard, make an advance of 6,000lira so that İzmir could be prepared for the voyage back to Constantinople. The Ottomans were at the time negotiating for a large armament contract with Krupp for the Army, and used this as leverage; by late 1901, Krupp conceded, rather than risk the lucrative contract. The debts in Kiel were paid and İzmir finally departed for home.|$|E
5|$|At {{independence}} on 30 June 1960, {{the army}} {{suffered from a}} dramatic deficit of trained leaders, particularly in the officer corps. This was because the Force Publique had always only been officered by Belgian or other expatriate whites. The Belgian Government <b>made</b> <b>no</b> <b>effort</b> <b>to</b> train Congolese commissioned officers {{until the very end}} of the colonial period, and in 1958, only 23 African cadets had been admitted even to the military secondary school. The highest rank available to Congolese was adjutant, which only four soldiers achieved before independence. Though 14 Congolese cadets were enrolled in the Royal Military Academy in Brussels in May, they were not scheduled to graduate as second lieutenants until 1963. Ill-advised actions by Belgian officers led to an enlisted ranks' rebellion on 5 July 1960, which helped spark the Congo Crisis. Lieutenant General Émile Janssens, the Force Publique commander, wrote during a meeting of soldiers that 'Before independence=After Independence', pouring cold water on the soldiers' desires for an immediate raise in their status.|$|E
5|$|Together {{with the}} Unicorn, she sailed for the Mediterranean on 13 August {{to prepare for}} the {{landings}} at Salerno (Operation Avalanche), reaching Malta a week later. Her air group was reinforced at this time by four more Martlets each for 878 and 890 Squadrons. She was assigned to Force H for the operation which was tasked to protect the amphibious force from attack by the Italian Fleet and provide air cover for the carriers supporting the assault force. The Italians <b>made</b> <b>no</b> <b>effort</b> <b>to</b> attack the Allied forces, and the most noteworthy thing that any of her aircraft did was when one of 890 Squadron's Martlets escorted a surrendering Italian aircraft to Sicily. Before the Illustrious steamed for Malta she transferred six Seafires to the Unicorn to replace some of her aircraft wrecked in deck-landing accidents. Four of these then flew ashore to conduct operations until they rejoined Illustrious on 14 September at Malta.|$|E
50|$|More {{than eight}} hundred false killer whales beached {{themselves}} {{on the shores of}} Mar del Plato, mostly on the Playa Bristol, on the afternoon of 10 October 1946.They came in compact groups, and <b>made</b> <b>no</b> <b>efforts</b> <b>to</b> return to the water.Some people stabbed the animals, shot them or cut off their fins.A police guard was placed to stop this cruelty.When the bodies began to decompose they were towed out to sea for 3 km.The waves returned some bodies to the beach, and two of the skeletons were dissected.|$|R

5|$|Captain Smith was an {{experienced}} seaman {{who had served}} for 40 years at sea, including 27 years in command. This was the first real crisis of his career, and he most certainly {{would have known that}} even if all the boats were fully occupied, more than a thousand people would remain on the ship as she went down with little or no chance of survival. As Smith began to grasp the enormity of what was about to happen, he appears to have become paralysed by indecision. He had ordered passengers and crew to muster, but from that point onward, he failed to order his officers to put the passengers into the lifeboats; he did not adequately organise the crew; he failed to convey crucial information to his officers and crew; he sometimes gave ambiguous or impractical orders and he never gave the command to abandon ship. Even some of his bridge officers were unaware for some time after the collision that the ship was sinking; Fourth Officer Joseph Boxhall did not find out until 01:15, barely an hour before the ship went down, while Quartermaster George Rowe was so unaware of the emergency that after the evacuation had started, he phoned the bridge from his watch station to ask why he had just seen a lifeboat go past. Smith did not inform his officers that the ship did not have enough lifeboats to save everyone. He did not supervise the loading of the lifeboats and seemingly <b>made</b> <b>no</b> <b>effort</b> <b>to</b> find out if his orders were being followed.|$|E
5|$|Desha {{was drawn}} into the Holley {{controversy}} during the 1824 presidential election. When no candidate achieved {{a majority of the}} electoral votes cast, the contest was resolved by the U.S. House of Representatives. Desha and the New Court partisans in the General Assembly instructed the state's congressional delegation to cast their votes for Andrew Jackson, but the delegation, led by House Speaker Henry Clay, defied these instructions and voted instead for John Quincy Adams. Because of this vote, Clay, a trustee for Transylvania and supporter of Holley, became Desha's political enemy. Desha's hostility for Transylvania and Holley worsened when, {{in the aftermath of the}} Isaac Desha trial, a student at Transylvania delivered a speech critical of the governor in the university's chapel. Although Holley was present for the speech, Transylvania historian John D. Wright, Jr. wrote that he did not know the student's topic beforehand and after hearing the speech, <b>made</b> <b>no</b> <b>effort</b> <b>to</b> condone its content. It was Holley's practice, however, to allow students to speak openly about current political matters, regardless of which position they took. Desha maintained that, because Holley had not silenced the student, he was at fault for tacitly condoning disrespectful criticism of the state's chief executive.|$|E
25|$|Similarly, the {{government}} <b>made</b> <b>no</b> <b>effort</b> <b>to</b> {{explain why the}} Citizen's Assembly had been created, how it had conducted its hearings and deliberations or why they had made the recommendations upon which voters were expected to pronounce themselves.|$|E

50|$|His stay in England was {{prolonged}} {{simply because}} he wanted to see how the relationship between Emma and William progressed. Once he found out that Emma was in love with William, he tried to encourage their relationship into something further, but he let go Emma when she said that she would go back to her hometown, and <b>made</b> <b>no</b> <b>efforts</b> <b>to</b> prevent her from leaving. When William finally proposed to Eleanor, Hakim finally said that he would go back home. To him, there was no more excitement seeing William surrender to the pressure of the society.|$|R
50|$|The man born William Vickers {{started out}} as Major Victory, when the group known as the Force of July was founded. There was an {{organization}} called the American Security Agency who found five willing Americans to undergo tests and transformations to become a force for America — the Force of July — and <b>made</b> <b>no</b> <b>efforts</b> <b>to</b> keep this a secret. With apt codenames {{and a lot of}} pomp and circumstance, these patriots held America's flag high as they took on missions that B. Eric Blairman assigned to them {{in the name of the}} President. Major Victory becomes the leader.|$|R
