40|$|Microvibrations are a {{critical}} concern on satellites equipped with instruments with high stability requirements. Amongst many sources of microvibration onboard, reaction wheel and momentum <b>wheel</b> <b>assemblies</b> are often {{considered the most}} significant. This thesis presents the development and validation of microvibration models for a cantilever configured <b>wheel</b> <b>assembly</b> designed with a soft-suspension system. <b>Wheel</b> <b>assembly</b> induced microvibrations under hard-mounted and coupled boundary conditions are studied. In particular, the <b>wheel</b> <b>assembly</b> semi-analytical microvibration model in a hard-mounted boundary condition is developed with harmonic excitations and the traditionally ignored broadband noise excitations are included. Some peculiar dynamics such as nonlinearity in the motor and high damping of the soft-suspension system are observed from the hard-mounted measurements conducted on a bespoke dynamometer. Modeling strategies for these peculiar dynamics are developed and implemented in the <b>wheel</b> <b>assembly</b> microvibration modeling. This includes a systematic approach to extract stiffness and damping values of the suspension system, considering nonlinearity and high damping from measurements. The microvibrations produced by the <b>wheel</b> <b>assembly</b> in a coupled boundary condition are studied using a seismic mass to support the <b>wheel</b> <b>assembly.</b> A coupled microvibration measurement system, which allows the <b>wheel</b> <b>assembly</b> interface loads to be reconstructed by measuring the response accelerations on the seismic mass, is designed, built and validated. In addition, the <b>wheel</b> <b>assembly</b> driving point static and dynamic accelerance are measured and analytical expressions of the driving point dynamic accelerance are derived. The coupled microvibrations are predicted with <b>wheel</b> <b>assembly</b> static accelerance, dynamic accelerance and the standard method (i. e. no wheel accelerance). The predicted results {{have shown that the}} method developed in this thesis which uses the <b>wheel</b> <b>assembly</b> dynamic accelerance accurately simulates the microvibrations observed in practice...|$|R

A reference arm pivotally connects between the <b>wheel</b> <b>assemblies,</b> and there is indicating means for measuring the angle of pivot between the arm {{and each of the}} <b>wheel</b> <b>assemblies.</b> The length of the device is less than the length of a track section, and thus when one of the <b>wheel</b> <b>assemblies</b> is on one track section and one is on an adjoining track section, the sum of the indicated angles will be indicative of the angle between track sections. Thus, from the length of a track section and angle, the departure of each track section from the line may be calculated...|$|R

40|$|A {{terminal}} sliding mode controller with nonlinear {{disturbance observer}} is investigated to control <b>mobile</b> <b>wheeled</b> inverted pendulum system. In order {{to eliminate the}} main drawback of the sliding mode control, “chattering” phenomenon, and for compensation of the model uncertainties and external disturbance, we designed a nonlinear disturbance observer of the <b>mobile</b> <b>wheeled</b> inverted pendulum system. Based on the nonlinear disturbance observer, a terminal sliding mode controller is also proposed. The stability of the closed-loop <b>mobile</b> <b>wheeled</b> inverted pendulum system is proved by Lyapunov theorem.

40|$|Microvibration {{management}} onboard spacecraft {{with high}} stability requirements has drawn increasing interest from engineers and scientists, and this paper discusses a reaction wheel design {{that allows a}} significant reduction of mid- to high-frequency microvibrations {{and that has been}} practically implemented in industry. Disturbances typically induced by mechanical systems onboard a spacecraft (especially rotating devices such as reaction <b>wheel</b> <b>assemblies</b> and momentum <b>wheel</b> <b>assemblies)</b> can severely degrade the performance of sensitive instruments. Traditionally, wheel-induced high-frequency (over 100 - 200 Hz) vibrations, generated by a combination of phenomena from bearing noise to dynamic amplifications due to internal resonances, are especially difficult to control. In this paper, the dynamic behavior of a newly designed <b>wheel</b> <b>assembly,</b> with a cantilevered flywheel configuration supported by a soft-suspension system, is investigated. The <b>wheel</b> <b>assembly's</b> mathematical model is developed and later verified with vibration tests. Wheel-assembly-induced lateral and axial microvibrations are accurately measured using a seismic-mass microvibration measurement system, which represents an alternative to typical microvibration measurement setups. Finally, the performance of this <b>wheel</b> <b>assembly</b> in terms of microvibration emissions is compared with a traditional design (with a rigid suspension) through comparison of frequency spectra, and it is shown that this design produces significantly lower vibrations at high frequency.

40|$|Microvibrations of a {{satellite}} reaction <b>wheel</b> <b>assembly</b> are commonly analysed in either hard-mounted or coupled boundary conditions, though coupled wheel-to-structure disturbance models are {{more representative of}} the real {{environment in which the}} wheel operates. This article investigates the coupled microvibration dynamics of a cantilever configured reaction <b>wheel</b> <b>assembly</b> mounted on either a stiff or flexible platform. Here a method is presented to cope with modern project necessities: (i) need of a model which gives accurate estimates covering a wide frequency range; (ii) reduce the personnel and time costs derived from the test campaign, (iii) reduce the computational effort without affecting the quality of the results. The method involves measurements of the disturbances induced by the reaction <b>wheel</b> <b>assembly</b> in a hard-mounted configuration and of the frequency and speed dependent dynamic mass of the reaction wheel. In addition, it corrects the approximation due to missing speed dependent dynamic mass in conventional reaction <b>wheel</b> <b>assembly</b> microvibration analysis. The former was evaluated experimentally using a previously designed and validated platform. The latter, on the other hand, was estimated analytically using a finite element model of the <b>wheel</b> <b>assembly.</b> Finally, the validation of the coupled wheel-structure disturbance model is presented, giving indication of the level of accuracy that can be achieved with this type of analyses...|$|R

Modelling strategies for the effect of damping are presented. Sine-sweep tests are performed and a method is developed to model harmonic excitations based on the corresponding test results. The often ignored broadband noise is modelled by removing spikes identified in the raw signal including a method of identifying spikes from energy variation and band-stop filter design. The validation of the reaction wheel disturbance model with full excitations (harmonics and broadband noise) is presented and flaws due to missing broadband noise in conventional reaction <b>wheel</b> <b>assembly</b> microvibration analysis are discussed...|$|R

40|$|This {{invention}} {{is directed}} to a method and apparatus for measuring emitted vibrational forces produced by a reaction <b>wheel</b> <b>assembly</b> due to imbalances, misalignment, bearing defects and the like. The apparatus includes a low mass carriage supported on a large mass base.
