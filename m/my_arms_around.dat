500|$|The song {{itself was}} {{recorded}} at Chalice Recording Studios in Los Angeles. In {{an interview with}} Noisey, Oh Land spoke with Kim Taylor Bennett who asked her for further clarification on the lyrics. Bennett interpreted the lyrics as a [...] "girl who is perhaps incapable of love and commitment" [...] {{but by the end}} of the song, it is revealed that [...] "it's the guy who is the asshole", to which Oh Land confirmed and said, [...] "Yeah, so it's like, 'fuck you!'". She also described it as a song that [...] "fast-forwards a bit" [...] and inspires her because she believes that she [...] "will do everything better when [...] get older". Oh Land discusses loving someone to a deeper extent as she ages: [...] "I will wrap <b>my</b> <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> you and keep you from the cold / I will love you better when I'm old". Several music critics described [...] "Love You Better" [...] as a ballad. The Guardians Paul MacInnes called the song an [...] "acoustic ballad", while Leonie Cooper from NME felt it was a [...] "folk ballad".|$|E
500|$|Roosevelt {{also had}} a close {{relationship}} with Associated Press (AP) reporter Lorena Hickok, who covered her during the last months of the presidential campaign and [...] "fell madly in love with her". During this period, Roosevelt wrote daily 10- to 15-page letters to [...] "Hick", who was planning to write a biography of the First Lady. The letters included such endearments as, [...] "I want to put <b>my</b> <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> you & kiss you at the corner of your mouth," [...] and, [...] "I can't kiss you, so I kiss your 'picture' good night and good morning!" [...] At Franklin's 1933 inauguration, Eleanor wore a sapphire ring Hickok had given her. FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover despised Roosevelt's liberalism, her stance regarding civil rights, and her and her husband FDR's criticisms of Hoover's surveillance tactics, and so Hoover maintained a large file on Roosevelt, which the filmmakers of the biopic J. Edgar (2011) indicate included compromising evidence of this relationship, which Hoover intended to blackmail Roosevelt with. Compromised as a reporter, Hickok soon resigned her position with the AP to be closer to Eleanor, who secured her a job as an investigator for a New Deal program.|$|E
500|$|Capper had not died {{immediately}} as her murderers believed, {{and after}} they left she managed to scramble back up the embankment and stagger along the lane for approximately {{a quarter of a}} mile (400 m) to Compstall Road before being found at 06:10 by Barry Sutcliffe and two of his colleagues on their way to work. She told them: [...] "Over there, in the field. They burnt me, they put petrol on me." [...] They immediately took her to a nearby house and roused the residents, Michael and Margaret Coop, to call for an ambulance. Michael Coop said: [...] "Both her hands appeared like ash. Her legs were just like raw meat and her feet appeared to be badly charred. I was struck by how polite the victim was. She was constantly thanking my wife for her assistance." [...] Margaret Coop said: [...] "I instinctively went to put <b>my</b> <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> her but she pulled away because she could not bear to be touched. Her head was shaved and there were recent, not new, cuts to her head. Her face was almost featureless. Her hands were red raw and black at the fingertips. Her legs were red from top to bottom. She couldn't bear anything near her legs." [...] Capper drank six glasses of water, but was unable to hold the glass herself because of the injuries to her hands. Margaret Coop said: [...] "She looked like the victim of an attack in the Vietnam war. But I felt she would survive. I had this theory that, now she had got to somewhere she could be helped, she would live." [...] Capper was rushed to the hospital and was able to give the names of her six assailants and Powell's address before falling into a coma. The extent of her burns was such that her mother and stepfather were unable to recognise her, and she was positively identified by a partial fingerprint from her thumb, the only part of her hands not severely burned. She died on 18 December 1992, without regaining consciousness.|$|E

2500|$|At their reunion shows, the New York Dolls {{performed}} [...] "You Can't Put Your Arms Around a Memory", with member Sylvain Sylvain {{singing the}} lead vocal and sometimes changing the title lyric to [...] "I can't put <b>my</b> <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> you, Johnny." ...|$|E
2500|$|In On a Wing and a Prayer David Campese defended {{himself by}} stating that, [...] "...I did not {{deliberately}} try to {{slap the ball}} down when Winterbottom attempted to pass to Underwood in the second half. I was just worried about stopping Winterbottom and I tried to get man and ball by wrapping <b>my</b> <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> him {{as well as the}} ball." ...|$|E
2500|$|Henry {{became known}} as one of the best punt {{blockers}} in the game while playing for Washington & Jefferson. Years later, he cited a blocked punt in 1916 as his greatest thrill as a player. Taking the ball off the punter's toe and running it back 40 yards for a touchdown, Henry recalled: [...] "The ball plopped right against my stomach and never bounced as I threw <b>my</b> <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, I {{think it}} is," [...] she protested with pathos, and a burlesque of her pathos. [...] "I never think half so well as when I have <b>my</b> <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> you. Then {{it seems as}} if I thought with your mind. I feel so judicial." ...|$|R
2500|$|... "Went to luncheon in {{the ballroom}} in the White House. James Roosevelt took us in to see his father, President Roosevelt. He said, 'It's about time you came. How can I put <b>my</b> <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> all of you? Which is the oldest? You are all so big.'" ...|$|R

2500|$|Years of Refusal was {{released}} worldwide on 16 February 2009 by the Universal Music Group, reaching number 3 in the UK Albums Chart and 11 in the US Billboard 200. The record was widely acclaimed by critics, with comparisons made to Your Arsenal and Vauxhall and I. A review from Pitchfork Media noted that with Years of Refusal, Morrissey [...] "has rediscovered himself, finding new potency in his familiar arsenal. Morrissey's rejuvenation is most {{obvious in the}} renewed strength of his vocals" [...] and called it his [...] "most venomous, score-settling album, and in a perverse way that makes it his most engaging". [...] "I'm Throwing <b>My</b> <b>Arms</b> <b>Around</b> Paris" [...] and [...] "Something Is Squeezing My Skull" [...] were released as the record's singles. The song [...] "Black Cloud" [...] features the guitar playing of Jeff Beck. Throughout 2009 Morrissey toured to promote the album. As part of the extensive Tour of Refusal, Morrissey followed a lengthy US tour with concerts booked in Ireland, Scotland, England, Russia. He had never before performed in Russia.|$|E
2500|$|On January 23, Clinton {{finally gave}} {{more than five}} hours of {{testimony}} on the Benghazi matter before hearings of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and the House Foreign Affairs Committee. She said with a choking voice, [...] "For me, {{this is not just}} a matter of policy, it's personal. I stood next to President Obama as the Marines carried those flag-draped caskets off the plane at Andrews. I put <b>my</b> <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> the mothers and fathers, sisters and brothers, sons and daughters." [...] She again accepted formal responsibility for the departmental security lapses that led to the attack and deaths, but in explanation did not accept personal blame for them. She said, [...] "I feel responsible for the nearly 70,000 people who work for the State Department. But the specific security requests pertaining to Benghazi, you know, were handled by the security professionals in the department. I didn't see those requests. They didn't come to me. I didn't approve them. I didn't deny them." [...] She did acknowledge that she had supported keeping the Benghazi consulate open after an earlier debate about its deteriorating security, but said she had assumed the security personnel involved would address any issues with it.|$|E

6000|$|Then {{came the}} agony of {{apprehension}} and doubt. Should I imprison in my hand that little hand with the dangling, scented gloves which had just tapped my lips? Should I dare to kiss her there and then, or slip <b>my</b> <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> her waist? Or dared I even sit closer? ...|$|R
60|$|The missionary still {{sat with}} his back toward us, and, being so intent upon his book, I found that by keeping my eyes upon him it was {{perfectly}} safe to walk with <b>my</b> <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> Ruth until we had nearly reached him. Then I took her hand in mine, and we {{stepped in front of}} him.|$|R
60|$|I {{could not}} help laughing, and he stood {{looking at me with}} such a {{whimsical}} expression that I rose and flung <b>my</b> <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> him.|$|E
6000|$|... "There {{seems to}} be {{considerable}} hoist in it," [...] he said, directly. And then I put <b>my</b> <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> him, and found that I could raise him from the ground.|$|E
6000|$|I leant {{across and}} put <b>my</b> <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> him; I {{suppose it was}} un-English; {{there are times when}} one forgets these points. [...] "I did not know! I did not know," [...] I cried.|$|E
6000|$|... "Do not {{distress}} yourself," [...] I said, although I was a {{good deal}} disturbed myself. [...] "We shall get home very well. You shall put your hand on my shoulder, while I put <b>my</b> <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> you. Then you can screw up my machine a good deal higher, and it will support us both. In this way I am sure that we shall get on very well." ...|$|R
5000|$|Garneau said: [...] "I {{asked for}} a picture and she said 'no problem', so I just put <b>my</b> <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> her shoulder. In sport, we do that all the time.

60|$|She {{rested her}} hand appealingly on mine, and sent my pulse fluttering. My heart was surely {{in my eyes}} for a moment. The dear and lovely woman! And she was so much the woman, {{clinging}} and appealing, sunshine and dew to my manhood, rooting it deeper and sending through it the sap of a new strength. I was for putting <b>my</b> <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> her, as when {{in the midst of}} the seal herd; but I considered, and refrained.|$|R
60|$|Shall we ever laugh again? If I {{could only}} see a dog that I knew in the old times! and could put <b>my</b> <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> his neck and tell him all, everything, and ease my heart.|$|E
6000|$|... "There--there--let me put <b>my</b> <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> you. Don't cry. There--put your {{cheek to}} mine. Be comforted. I wish to live. I will live if I can. Ah, {{what could she}} do without me!... Does she often speak of me?--but I know she does." ...|$|E
6000|$|I {{struggled}} violently {{to reach}} the dear lad, intent on throwing <b>my</b> <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> him {{in order to show}} how deeply I felt this devotion of his which had brought him back, perhaps, to a terrible death; but Master Sitz and Sergeant Corney remained silent and motionless until Jacob was well within the lodge. Then his father said, conveying reproach even in the whisper: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I shouldn't bother {{about that}} sale, if I were you," [...] Burton whispered hoarsely. [...] "I {{tell you what}} it is, I daren't go on like this any longer.

I shall probably sit here and order more beer and wait till Maud comes; I shall stay to lunch and sit with <b>my</b> <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> her afterwards!

6000|$|... "The {{little man}} can play," [...] he declared. [...] "He has {{it in his}} fingers. We shall hear now the waltzes that I love. Ah, Miss Julia, why is this not Paris! Why can I not get up and put <b>my</b> <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> your waist and whisper in your ear as we float round and round in a waltz? Stupid questions!

"Well," [...] said Gabriel, {{looking up}} at the roof, [...] "wimmen is bashful ez a general thing, and thar's about only one way ez a man can get at 'em, and that ez, by being kinder keerless and bold.

60|$|They all paused. I {{had thrown}} myself beside {{her in an}} agony of {{helpless}} grief, and putting <b>my</b> <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> held her tight. For a few minutes our sorrowful hearts beat together, whilst the friends around us turned away their eyes that ran tears silently. Then Van Helsing turned and said gravely. So gravely that I could not help {{feeling that he was}} in some way inspired, and was stating things outside himself.|$|E
60|$|You {{may well}} fancy that I {{opened the door}} in a twinkling, for it was {{dangerous}} to have him standing there in the broad light of day, and when he was come into the room, having closed and barred the door behind him, I flung <b>my</b> <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> his neck, clinging to him as if he was one lately returned from the very verge of the grave, as indeed I believe to this day was the case.|$|E
60|$|I {{never said}} a word to her at first. I just strode across the cave and grasped her by the wrists, and when she struggled, I put <b>my</b> <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> her so as to pinion her hands to her sides. She fought like a tigress, but I took my free hand and pushed her head back--I imagine that I had {{suddenly}} turned brute, that I had gone back a thousand million years, and was again a veritable cave man taking my mate by force--and then I kissed that beautiful mouth again and again.|$|R
60|$|I {{waited for}} a {{momentary}} lull, and then I {{opened the door and}} slipped out. The first breath of cold strong air was like wine to me after my confinement, but a moment later I felt my breath taken away, and I was lifted almost from my feet by a sudden gust. I linked <b>my</b> <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> the trunk of a swaying pine tree and hung there till the lull came. Up into the darkness from that unseen gulf below came showers of spray, white as snow, falling like rain all about me. It was a night to remember.|$|R
