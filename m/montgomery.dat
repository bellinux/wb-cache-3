5|$|<b>Montgomery</b> Gentry was an American {{country music}} duo {{consisting}} of vocalists Eddie <b>Montgomery</b> and Troy Gentry, both natives of Kentucky. Eddie <b>Montgomery</b> and Troy Gentry began performing in the 1990s {{as part of}} two different bands with Montgomery's brother, John Michael <b>Montgomery.</b> Although Gentry won a talent contest in 1994, he reunited with Eddie <b>Montgomery</b> after Gentry {{was unable to find}} a solo record deal, and <b>Montgomery</b> Gentry was formed in 1999. The duo was known for its Southern rock influences, and collaborated with Charlie Daniels, Toby Keith, Five for Fighting, and members of The Allman Brothers Band.|$|E
5|$|As the {{bombardment}} {{of the city}} proved to be unsuccessful, <b>Montgomery</b> then began to plan for an assault. <b>Montgomery</b> was to assault the Lower Town district, {{the part of the}} city near the river shore, while Arnold was to attack and take the Cape Diamond Bastion, a strong part of the city walls on the highest point of the rocky promontory. <b>Montgomery</b> believed that they should attack during a stormy night, therefore the British {{would not be able to}} see them. On December 27, the weather became stormy, and <b>Montgomery</b> ordered that the men prepare to attack. However, the storm soon subsided and <b>Montgomery</b> called off the attack. As <b>Montgomery</b> waited for a storm, he was forced to revise his plans, because a deserter communicated the original plan to the defenders. In the new plan, <b>Montgomery</b> would attack the Lower Town from the south and Arnold would attack the Lower Town from the north. After breaking through the walls, <b>Montgomery</b> and Arnold would meet up in the city and then attack and take the Upper Town, causing resistance to collapse. To increase their chance of surprise, <b>Montgomery</b> planned two feints. One detachment of troops (the 1st Canadian Regiment under James Livingston) would set fire to one of the gates while another (under the command of Jacob Brown) would engage the guard at Cape Diamond Bastion and fire rockets to signal the start of the attack. While the feints were conducted, artillery would fire into the city. Although <b>Montgomery</b> was reluctant to attack, enlistments for Arnold's men were expiring on January 1, and he was concerned about losing their services.|$|E

5|$|In critic Gary Giddins' view,Kelly {{was never}} able to exploit his gifts when he went out on his own.

5|$|<b>Montgomery</b> and {{his troops}} {{spent the first}} night near the landing area, under light fire from the British guns. The next morning, he ordered Major Timothy Bedel to occupy a {{position}} north of the fort, but when <b>Montgomery</b> saw that his men were apprehensive, he chose to lead the mission himself. As <b>Montgomery</b> led his troops, they came upon a fight between British troops and another American party. <b>Montgomery</b> took command of the skirmish and forced the British party back into the fort. <b>Montgomery</b> sent Bedel with a force to entrench themselves about a mile north of the fort. <b>Montgomery</b> then put other troops around the fort and began a siege.|$|E

5|$|<b>Montgomery</b> {{then turned}} the army toward Montreal. The march was {{difficult}} {{as there was}} snow, water, and ice {{on the ground and}} a winter storm struck several days after their departure. In an attempt to stop an escape of British troops from Montreal to Quebec, <b>Montgomery</b> sent a detachment to Sorel where the force briefly clashed with British troops. The British troops quickly withdrew to their vessels in the St. Lawrence River. When <b>Montgomery</b> and the main army reached the outskirts of the city, <b>Montgomery</b> sent a messenger in demanding the surrender of the city or they would suffer bombardment. While negotiations for the city's surrender took place, Carleton fled down the St. Lawrence River in a small flotilla of ships. The city surrendered on November 13, and <b>Montgomery</b> and his army marched into the city without a shot being fired.|$|E
5|$|On November 28, <b>Montgomery</b> and 300 {{men went}} aboard {{some of the}} {{captured}} ships and began to sail to Quebec City. On December 2, <b>Montgomery</b> joined Benedict Arnold's force at Pointe aux Trembles, 18 miles upriver from Quebec. On his arrival, Arnold turned over command of his forces to <b>Montgomery.</b> On December 3, <b>Montgomery</b> gave Arnold's men, who had marched through the Maine wilderness to Quebec City and suffered much hardship along the way, much-needed supplies, including clothing and other winter supplies taken from the captured British ships. The next day, the army moved toward the city; when they arrived, <b>Montgomery</b> ordered the city to be surrounded. On December 7, <b>Montgomery</b> sent an ultimatum to Carleton, demanding the surrender of the city. Carleton burned the letter. Several days later, <b>Montgomery</b> sent a letter into the city appealing the merchants telling them that {{they had come to}} liberate the civilians of Quebec. However, Carleton discovered the plan and quickly had the messenger arrested. <b>Montgomery,</b> wanting his message to reach the inhabitants of the city, then sent the proclamation over the wall with bows and arrows.|$|E

5000|$|A {{heated debate}} over the {{demolition}} of the <b>Montgomery's</b> home (Briarly) beside <b>Montgomery's</b> Inn in the 1980s led to {{a greater emphasis on}} the historic nature of the area.

5|$|Schuyler's health declined, so <b>Montgomery</b> assumed {{command of}} the daily {{functions}} of the army. On September 10, a larger force of 1,700 men led by <b>Montgomery</b> moved toward the fort. In the swampy area around the fort, it was so dark that two parties of Americans ran into each other; each feared the other to be the British, and both fled. <b>Montgomery</b> ran to intercept them and ended the flight. As they advanced toward the fort, the force came under British grapeshot fire. One party of Americans attacked the British breastworks, inflicting 2 casualties, after which they fell back. The next morning, <b>Montgomery</b> called a council of war, {{in which it was}} agreed to make another attack on the fort. However, word spread that a British warship was advancing up the river, and half the New England troops fled out of fright. <b>Montgomery,</b> believing his force could no longer take the fort, retreated back to Île aux Noix. <b>Montgomery,</b> furious at the flight of the New England troops, asked Schuyler to appoint a court-martial board. Meanwhile, Schuyler's health had not improved. He left for Ticonderoga on the 16th to recover, giving full control of the operation to <b>Montgomery.</b>|$|E
5|$|Unknown to <b>Montgomery,</b> he was {{promoted}} to major general on December 9 for his victories at St. Johns and Montreal. After <b>Montgomery</b> was unable to convince Carleton to surrender, he placed several mortars a few hundred yards outside the walls of the city. The shelling of the city began on December 9, but after several days it had failed to make a serious impact on the walls, the garrison, or the civilian population. With the shelling having little effect, <b>Montgomery</b> ordered the emplacement of another battery closer towards the city walls, on the Plains of Abraham, despite the fact it offered little natural cover from returning fire. On December 15, the new batteries were ready and <b>Montgomery</b> sent a party of men under the flag of truce to ask for the city's surrender. However, they were turned away. <b>Montgomery</b> then resumed firing on the city, but the effect was little better. When the new batteries were hit by more effective fire from the British, <b>Montgomery</b> ordered their evacuation.|$|E
5|$|After Early Tymz disbanded, the <b>Montgomery</b> {{brothers}} and Gentry briefly performed as Young Country, with John Michael as lead vocalist. John Michael {{left for a}} solo career in the early 1990s. Gentry went solo and won the Jim Beam National Talent Contest in 1994, which led to him opening for Patty Loveless and Tracy Byrd. Gentry initially wanted to pursue a solo career, but after {{he was unable to}} find a record deal, he reunited with Eddie <b>Montgomery</b> to form a duo called Deuce, which played at local nightclubs.

5|$|As {{it turned}} out, the {{relationship}} between SHAEF and Field Marshal Sir Bernard Montgomery's 21st Army Group was far from cordial, with the Deputy Supreme Commander, Air Chief Marshal Sir Arthur Tedder, and the Deputy Chief of Staff, Lieutenant General Frederick Morgan, both frequently critical of <b>Montgomery.</b> In September 1944 an intelligence crisis similar to Kasserine arose, when the cryptanalysts at Bletchley Park did not locate the 9th SS Panzer Division Hohenstaufen and 10th SS Panzer Division Frundsberg in the Arnhem area, but information from the Dutch resistance and a consequent photo reconnaissance ordered by Major Brian Urquhart, the Intelligence Officer at I Airborne Corps, confirmed the German presence. Strong and Smith then flew to Brussels to warn <b>Montgomery.</b> However, <b>Montgomery</b> decided to accept the risk rather than alter the plans for Operation Market Garden.|$|E
