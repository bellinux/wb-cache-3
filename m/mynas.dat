5|$|Black drongos {{become active}} very early {{at dawn and}} roost later than many other birds. They feed mainly on insects such as grasshoppers, cicadas, termites, wasps, bees, ants, moths, beetles and dragonflies. They {{sometimes}} fly close to tree branches, attempting to disturb any insects that may be present. They congregate in fields that are being ploughed, picking up exposed caterpillars and beetle grubs. As many as 35 birds have been seen at such congregations. They are also attracted to fires in scrub and grasslands habitats where insects are disturbed. They appear to avoid flies. They associate with common <b>mynas,</b> cattle egrets and other birds that share a similar diet and habitat. Drongos benefit from this association and are more successful in their foraging. There is only partial overlap in the insect prey sought by <b>mynas</b> and drongos although in rare instances the drongos may rob prey from <b>mynas.</b> It is said that they imitate {{the call of the}} Shikra so as to put <b>mynas</b> to flight and then to steal prey. Similar behaviour, using false alarm calls, has been noted in the fork-tailed drongo. There are some cases of the black drongo preying on small birds, reptiles, or maybe even bats. They have also been on occasion seen feeding on fish Flowers of trees such as Erythrina and Bombax may be visited for water and nectar and they are sometimes known to feed on grains. They are only rarely known to take larger arthropods such as scorpions and centipedes. They feed on milkweed butterflies that are often avoided by other predators and are known to feed late in the evening or night, often on insects attracted to artificial lights.|$|E
5|$|Starlings and <b>mynas</b> {{are small}} to {{medium-sized}} Old World passerine birds with strong feet. Their flight {{is strong and}} direct and most are very gregarious. Their preferred habitat is fairly open country, and they eat insects and fruit. The plumage of several species is dark with a metallic sheen.|$|E
5|$|Birds {{have been}} domesticated by humans both as pets and for {{practical}} purposes. Colourful birds, such as parrots and <b>mynas,</b> are bred in captivity or kept as pets, {{a practice that}} has led to the illegal trafficking of some endangered species. Falcons and cormorants have long been used for hunting and fishing, respectively. Messenger pigeons, used since at least 1 AD, remained important as recently as World War II. Today, such activities are more common either as hobbies, for entertainment and tourism, or for sports such as pigeon racing.|$|E

5|$|Fiji's native birdlife {{has been}} badly {{affected}} by agriculture, deforestation and introduced pests like rats and mongooses. Although Important Bird Areas {{have been established}} on Taveuni and the forest east of Vanua Levu, conservation problems persist. The Fiji parrotfinch has adapted well to man-made landscapes; it is neither a ground nor hole nester, so it avoids predation from the mongoose and competition for nest sites with introduced common and jungle <b>mynas.</b> Introduced rodents are able to access the nests and may affect breeding productivity. The potential introduction of other species, such as snakes, or diseases like avian malaria could lead to major losses among bird species.|$|E
5|$|From the Greek {{word for}} pan pipes, σύριγξ, {{it is the}} vocal organ of birds. Located {{at the base of}} a bird's trachea, it {{produces}} sounds without the vocal folds of mammals. The sound is produced by vibrations of some or all of the membrana tympaniformis (the walls of the syrinx) and the pessulus, caused by air flowing through the syrinx. This sets up a self-oscillating system that modulates the airflow creating the sound. The muscles modulate the sound shape by changing the tension of the membranes and the bronchial openings. The syrinx enables some species of birds (such as parrots, crows, and <b>mynas)</b> to mimic human speech. Unlike the larynx of mammals, the syrinx is located where the trachea forks into the lungs. Thus, lateralization of bird song is possible and some songbirds can produce more than one sound at a time.|$|E
5|$|More {{than twenty}} species of hawk, owl and falcon {{are known to}} {{occasionally}} predate feral starlings in North America, though the most regular predators of adults {{are likely to be}} urban-living peregrine falcons or merlins (Falco columbarius). Common <b>mynas</b> (Acridotheres tristis) sometimes evict eggs, nestlings and adult common starlings from their nests, and the lesser honeyguide (Indicator minor), a brood parasite, uses the common starling as a host. Starlings are more commonly the culprits rather than victims of nest eviction however, especially towards other starlings and woodpeckers. Nests can be raided by animals capable of climbing to them, such as stoats (Mustela erminea), raccoons (Procyon lotor) and squirrels (Sciurus spp.), and cats may catch the unwary.|$|E
5000|$|The common hill <b>myna</b> (Gracula religiosa), {{sometimes}} spelled [...] "mynah" [...] and formerly simply {{known as}} hill <b>myna,</b> is the <b>myna</b> most commonly seen in aviculture, {{where it is}} often simply referred to by the latter two names. It {{is a member of}} the starling family (Sturnidae), resident in hill regions of South Asia and Southeast Asia. The Sri Lanka hill <b>myna,</b> a former subspecies of G. religiosa, is now generally accepted as a separate species G. ptilogenys. The Enggano hill <b>myna</b> (G. enganensis) and Nias hill <b>myna</b> (G. robusta) are also widely accepted as specifically distinct, and many authors favor treating the Southern hill <b>myna</b> (G. indica) from the Nilgiris and elsewhere in the Western Ghats of India as a separate species.|$|R

25|$|Naultinus are preyed on by {{a number}} of {{invasive}} mammalian species including cats, rodents (3 species of rat and the house mouse) and mustelids. While the larger predators such as stoats and cats are the normal focus of pest control efforts in New Zealand, it is thought that the effect that smaller predators such as mice and weasels may be just as great or even worse. After the removal of mice from Mana Island in the '90s, lizard numbers increased massively – demonstrating that mouse predation does serious harm to native reptile populations. Mice can squeeze into much smaller hiding places to take lizards as prey and they also forage year round, no matter how cold it gets - this is significant because below 5 degrees Celsius lizards become torpid and can't defend themselves against attack. This would mean that Naultinus sheltering from cold weather on the ground at the base of plants or underneath debris would be particularly vulnerable to mouse predation. In addition to being preyed on by certain species of invasive mammals, Naultinus are also preyed on by introduced bird species - <b>mynas</b> have been observed plucking Naultinus from the forest canopy in parts of Northland and magpies have been observed searching scrub canopies in a similar fashion at known Naultinus sites in the South Island.|$|E
500|$|In 1896, 56 {{species of}} birds were found, {{including}} the crested white-eye. Twelve additional species were found in 1981. Subsequent zoological surveys [...] found other bird species on the mountain. More than 90 bird species have been found on Mount Tambora. Local people hunt Yellow-crested cockatoos, Zoothera thrushes, hill <b>mynas,</b> green junglefowl, and rainbow lorikeets for the cagebird trade. Orange-footed scrubfowl are hunted for food. These exploitations have caused the bird population to decline. The yellow-crested cockatoo is nearing extirpation on Sumbawa island.|$|E

40|$|To {{study the}} speech mimicry in common <b>myna</b> (Acridotheres tristis), {{is one of}} the {{channels}} to understand vocal learning in birds. Common <b>myna</b> has the ability to mimic voices and sounds just like parrots, hill <b>myna,</b> and other talking birds. Although common <b>myna</b> birds have become an invasive species in some countries, they are often chosen as pets for their ability to mimic human speech. This study was carried out in order to document the oratory training procedure of common <b>myna</b> by local trainer, and to understand the speech mimicry of common <b>myna.</b> A sample of common <b>myna</b> owned by a local trainer from Jeli, Kelantan, has been studied by interviewing and documenting the training procedures practiced by the trainer. The results showed that the variation of vocal learning ability is depending on the individual bird. There are several factors that are important when training common <b>myna,</b> these are; the bird's mental and physical health, training of the bird by the age of six month, trainer and bird bonding, location of the bird's holding cage, repetition of vocabularies or sentences, patience, rewards, and proper record keeping book. However, the use of mechanical sound device such as tape recorder is not recommended since it does not help in the mimicry training of the common <b>myna...</b>|$|R
2500|$|Starlings are {{medium-sized}} passerines. The shortest-bodied {{species is}} Kenrick's starling (Poeoptera kenricki), at 15 centimetres (6 in), but the lightest-weight species is Abbott's starling (Poeoptera femoralis), which is 34 grams (1.2 oz). The largest starling, going on standard measurements and perhaps weight, is the Nias hill myna (Gracula robusta). This species can {{measure up to}} [...] and, in domestication they can weigh up to [...] Rivalling the prior species in bulk if not dimensions, the <b>mynas</b> of the genus Mino are also large, especially the yellow-faced (M. dumontii) and long-tailed <b>mynas</b> (M. kreffti).

2500|$|Starlings {{are small}} to {{medium-sized}} passerine {{birds in the}} family Sturnidae. The name [...] "Sturnidae" [...] comes from the Latin word for starling, sturnus. Many Asian species, particularly the larger ones, are called <b>mynas,</b> and many African species are known as glossy starlings because of their iridescent plumage. Starlings are native to Europe, Asia and Africa, as well as northern Australia and the islands of the tropical Pacific. Several European and Asian species have been introduced to these areas as well as North America, Hawaii and New Zealand, where they generally compete for habitats with native birds and {{are considered to be}} invasive species. The starling species familiar to most people in Europe and North America is the common starling, and throughout much of Asia and the Pacific, the common myna is indeed common.|$|E
50|$|Common <b>mynas</b> roost communally {{throughout}} the year, either in pure or mixed flocks with jungle <b>mynas,</b> rosy starlings, house crows, jungle crows, cattle egrets and rose-ringed parakeets and other birds.
