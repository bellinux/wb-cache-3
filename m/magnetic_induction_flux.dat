40|$|Experimental {{validation}} of the Faraday's law of electromagnetic induction (EMI) is performed when an electromotive force is generated in thin copper turns, located inside a large magnetic coil. It has been established that the electromotive force (emf) value should be dependent not only on changes of the <b>magnetic</b> <b>induction</b> <b>flux</b> through a turn and on symmetry of its crossing by magnetic power lines also. The law of EMI is applicable in sufficient approximation in case of the changes of the magnetic field near the turn are symmetrical. Experimental study of the induced emf in arcs and a direct section of the conductor placed into the variable field has been carried out. Linear dependence of the induced emf {{on the length of}} the arc has been ascertained in case of the magnetic field distribution symmetry about it. Influence of the magnetic field symmetry on the induced emf in the arc has been observed. The curve of the induced emf in the direct section over period of current pulse is similar to this one for the turns and arcs. The general law of EMI for a curvilinear conductor has been deduced. Calculation of the induced emf in the turns wrapped over it and comparison with the experimental data has been made. The proportionality factor has been ascertained for the law. Special conditions have been described, when the induced emf may not exist in the presence of inductive current. Theoretical estimation of the inductive current has been made at a induced low voltage in the turn. It has been noted the necessity {{to take into account the}} concentration of current carriers in calculation of the induced emf in semiconductors and ionized conductors. Comment: 18 page...|$|E

40|$|We {{consider}} {{the response of}} a multicomponent body to n fields, such as electric fields, magnetic fields, temperature gradients, concentration gradients, etc., where each component, which is possibly anisotropic, may cross couple the various fields with different fluxes, such as electrical currents, electrical displacement currents, <b>magnetic</b> <b>induction</b> fields, energy <b>fluxes,</b> particle fluxes, etc. We obtain {{the form of the}} perturbation expansions of the fields and response tensor in powers of matrices which measure the difference between each component tensor and a homogeneous reference tensor L_ 0. For the case of a statistically homogeneous or periodic composite the expansion coefficients can be expressed in terms of positive semidefinite normalization matrices alternating with positive semidefinite weight matrices, which at each given level sum to the identity matrix. In an appropriate basis the projection operators onto the relevant subspaces can be expressed in block tridiagonal form, where the blocks are functions of these weight and normalization matrices. This leads to continued fraction expansions for the effective tensor, and by truncating the continued fraction at successive levels one obtains a nested sequence of bounds on the effective tensor incorporating successively more weight and normalization matrices. The weight matrices and normalization matrices can be calculated from the series expansions of the fields which solve the conductivity problem alone, without any couplings to other fields, and then they can be used to obtain the solution for the fields and effective tensor in coupled field problems in composites.

40|$|This {{research}} project successfully presents and discusses {{the design and}} construction of an extremely low frequency (ELF) PEMF device built {{on the basis of}} a Two-Axis (2 -Axis) Helmholtz coil system (HCS) that is capable of producing a uniform time varying magnetic field in the frequency range of 2 - 500 Hz and <b>magnetic</b> <b>induction</b> (<b>magnetic</b> <b>flux</b> density) of 0. 5 mT - 2. 5 mT. A custom software program was written in order to systematically analyze the induced magnetic field distribution and its region of uniformity within 10 %, 1 % and 0. 1 % of the center field, prior to commencing experimentation with the selected biological model systems. The applications of the developed ELF PEMF exposure device have been investigated in terms of the experimental evaluation of ELF PEMF irradiation on protein, i. e. Collagenase enzyme, and gram-positive and gram- negative bacterial cultures of Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) and Escherichia coli (E. coli) respectively. Through this study it was experimentally proved that it is possible to optimize ELF PEMF parameters (frequency, f, and magnetic flux density, B) of the applied irradiation which can modulate (increase or decrease) the biological activity of the studied Collagenase enzyme. Important findings from the conducted experiments showed that the biological activity of Collagenase enzyme is increased by 7 - 15 % and 4 - 15 % upon irradiation at 3 Hz and 8 Hz for the magnetic flux densities of 0. 5 - 2. 5 mT. The effects of the applied ELF PEMF exposure system on growth and proliferation of bacterial culture of S. aureus and E. coli have also been experimentally evaluated. All bacterial cultures exposed to ELF PEMF showed a decrease in their growth rate when compared to control samples. For S. aureus, a specific viability pattern “quadrature polynomial” was observed upon ELF PEMF irradiation. The occurrence of the frequency and magnetic flux density “windows” was observed at the higher end of the studied frequencies range and all magnetic flux densities except 1. 5 mT. Maximum relative decrease of 68. 56 % was observed at the frequency 300 Hz and magnetic flux density 1. 5 mT. For E. coli, the overall observation is that E. coli bacteria were generally more responsive to the applied irradiation treatment, where the exponential relationship between the colony-forming unit (CFU) values (bacterial growth) and applied exposures was observed. The results obtained clearly demonstrate that the effects of irradiation on bacterial growth are frequency and magnetic flux density dependent. In general, the decrease in bacterial cell viability was achieved at all studied range of frequencies (2 - 500 Hz) and every magnetic flux density (0. 5 mT, 1 mT, 1. 5 mT, 1. 5 mT, 2 mT and 2. 5 mT). Minimum and maximum changes in bacterial cells growth for the exposed samples were recorded at 3 Hz and 0. 5 mT, and 500 Hz and 2. 5 mT, respectively. The maximum effect observed at the 500 Hz and 2. 5 mT corresponds to the relative decrease of 77. 26 % in bacterial growth. The outcomes of this {{research project}} provides evidence based support to the hypothesis that optimal ELF PEMF parameters can induce therapeutic effects in proteins and cells and thereby, ELF PEMF therapies have a great potential for possible treatment of wounds and overall wound healing promotion...|$|R
