50|$|The mid-18th century {{gave rise}} to {{industrial}} capitalism, made possible by (1) the accumulation of vast amounts of capital under the merchant phase of capitalism and its investment in machinery, and (2) {{the fact that the}} Enclosures meant that Britain had a large population of people with no access to subsistence agriculture, who needed to buy basic commodities via the market, thus ensuing a <b>mass</b> <b>consumer</b> <b>market.</b> Industrial capitalism, which Marx dated from the last third of the 18th century, marked the development of the factory system of manufacturing, characterized by a complex division of labor between and within work process and the routinization of work tasks; and finally established the global domination of the capitalist mode of production.|$|E

40|$|The {{process of}} “market {{segmentation}} ” is {{a cornerstone of}} modern marketing and an essential task for relatively smaller seller organisations as they address themselves to markets much larger and more diverse than their limited output capacity. In <b>mass</b> <b>consumer</b> <b>markets</b> the process is, arguably, well developed and sophisticated. In industrial markets, it is generally acknowledged that the process is less well understood and even less well practised. The obvious diversity of industrial markets and frequently idiosyncratic buyer-seller relationships explain, in part, this lack of generalisability. This paper proposes a methodology for industrial market segmentation {{which is based on}} the joint consideration, and explicit calculation, of both the value of the customer to the seller, and the value of the seller to the customer. Implicit in the process of measuring value are the central concepts of relationships, and customer loyalty. ...|$|R

40|$|Urbanisation and {{a growing}} middle class with {{changing}} consumption patterns provide an ideal setting for supermarkets to prosper. With South Africa's urban population approaching 60 per cent, supermarket retail chains are now important players in the agro-food sector.

Together with the strict requirements of the retail groups, this makes it difficult for small-scale farmers to supply these retailers. This paper highlights the market changes that could continue to exclude small producers from <b>mass</b> <b>consumer</b> <b>markets.</b> It uses a case study to show how small farmers can be integrated into the urban retail market and, using evidence from this study, proposes a number of strategies to help them participate in the mainstream agro-food supply chains and an innovative model for including them while maintaining profitable business operations. ...|$|R

Through convenience sampling, 511 questionnaires were collected from clothing retail customers in the greater Pretoria metropolitan area. Results indicate that customers’ satisfaction with selected store attributes (namely price, the assortment offered, perceived product quality and employee service), significantly predict clothing retail customers’ cumulative satisfaction. Findings show further that clothing retail customers’ relationship intentions significantly influence their satisfaction with selected store attributes, as well as their cumulative satisfaction. More specifically, customers’ satisfaction increased as their relationship intention levels increased.
