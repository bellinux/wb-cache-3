40|$|Undoubtedly, {{the bill}} of lading has to be {{considered}} {{as the most important}} document used in carriages <b>of</b> <b>goods</b> by sea. Born, most probably, in the Middle Age, {{the bill of}} lading at first developed its role as proof of the contract of carriage and receipt <b>of</b> the <b>goods</b> carried on board.

At present, the bill of lading appears to be extended to the <b>multimodal</b> <b>transports</b> <b>of</b> <b>goods</b> with excellent results and can be used also in electronic applications.

40|$|The {{international}} <b>multimodal</b> <b>transport</b> <b>of</b> hazardous <b>goods</b> {{and waste}} is a sector of remarkable economic importance. This transport activity {{is connected to}} several productive sectors and it can have considerable repercussions {{on the environment and}} health {{as well as on the}} safety of the workers and third parties that study in the same field. A certain part <b>of</b> the <b>transport</b> <b>of</b> hazardous <b>goods</b> and waste is managed by organized criminals who can obtain enormous savings by neglecting the measures necessary to protect the environment and safety. The legitimate economy is thus damaged and, above all, the efforts the International Community has made since the fifties-sixties, concerning the regulation of the complex aspects of this activity, are undermined. Two distinct judicial models exist at an international level concerning hazardous waste and goods: "transboundary movement" and "international transport". The purpose of these models is to regulate a phenomenon which, although very complex and articulated, requires a homogeneous view. The international <b>multimodal</b> <b>transport</b> judicial model is here examined in 3 subsequent stages: (1) the general aspects and the details along the entire chain, starting from the loading operations, then going on to the transport itself and ending up with the unloading at its final destination; (2) the controls on the respect of international legislation on this topic; (3) a study case is conducted pertaining to the extensive PCB category which, from a judicial point of view, in certain cases can be considered hazardous goods and in other cases hazardous waste. The aim of the study is to supply decision makers with indications that can be used to improve the efficacy and the effectiveness of the regulations at a UN level and of the cascading particular agreements for the various means <b>of</b> <b>transport.</b> The international <b>multimodal</b> <b>transport</b> judicial model suffers from the uncertainties that were already encountered for the transborder movement model, with particular reference to the lack of a unique interpretation of what is waste and what are goods at an international, regional and national level. This difficulty, which was already present in the first model, has negative repercussions on the second one and diminishes the efficacy and effectiveness of the interventions put into place to solve the real problems <b>of</b> <b>multimodal</b> <b>transport</b> which, if considered separately, would be valid. Even the controls, which are basically objectively complex and costly, come up against difficulties right from the beginning. Finally, the study case of PCBs also shows that the lack of a solution to the fundamental problem reduces the various operations inherent to transport to almost just a heavy bureaucratic practice, which suffers from practical implications that make it difficult to reach the objectives of protecting the environment and safety that the model has established. The attention of decision makers should be concentrated on two fundamental aspects. The first concerns the fundamental theme of the difference between goods and waste which, being unresolved, weakens many parts of the two models and results in the amplification of the problems on the second model. The second aspect regards the controls that should be conducted. The improvement of the technical-judicial model requires the combined study of experts, from both the judicial and technical field...|$|R
40|$|The United Nations Convention on International <b>Multimodal</b> <b>Transport</b> <b>of</b> <b>Goods</b> of 24 th May 1980 is an {{appropriate}} answer to the legal and political problems raised by through carriage and containerisation. Traditionally, when goods were transferred from one mode to another they were also transferred to a new legal regime. There was no coherent legal regime governing carrier liability for goods moving in multimodal transport. The Convention creates a new liability system and confer international legal sanction on the responsibilities and immunities flowing from the multimodal transport contract. The Convention compromises between the needs of developing countries [...] who called for provisions on regulation and control of multimodal operations at the domestic level [...] {{and the demands of}} developed countries [...] who wanted the convention to deal primarily with private law matters and pointed to the danger of conflicts with modal conventions. The Convention is not yet in force but its provisions are the basis of current through carriage contracts...|$|E
40|$|International {{multimodal}} transport {{continues to grow}} exponentially, while the relevant international legal framework becomes increasingly fragmented and complex. The establishment of a widely acceptable uniform international legal framework for {{multimodal transport}} contracts {{has proven to be}} extremely difficult, in spite of the various attempts initiated by some international organizations. Owing to the increasing use of containers to consolidate cargo, multimodal transport practice has become inevitable in the field of international trade based on its numerous advantages over the traditional unimodal carriage practices. Therefore, the urgent need of an internationally legal instrument to govern liability issues arising from multimodal carriage transactions is highly requested by trading parties. This research, however, present the difficulties involve when trying to establish liability issues arising from multimodal carriage claims and the impact it has on contracting parties who are never certain on which regime their contracts are based, instead depends on already existing unimodal liability regimes to sort out their disputes. The strengths and weaknesses of the two most recent attempts at producing a uniform legal regime for multimodal transport namely: The United Nations Convention on International <b>Multimodal</b> <b>Transport</b> <b>of</b> <b>Goods</b> 1980 (The UN Convention of 1980) and The United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Carriage of Goods Wholly or Partly by Sea (The Rotterdam Rules) are also examined in this research as none of these attempts appears to be a tenable solution. However, {{in the absence of a}} truly accepted international uniform legal regime for multimodal transport contracts, some nations, regional and sub-regional laws and regulations on multimodal transport contracts have been initiated. Despite the recognition of the Rotterdam Rules in certain jurisdictions, it will probably fail to achieve the aim of uniformity as intended because it’s merely a “maritime-plus” Convention. With the continuous development of containerization, there is an imperative need to have a multimodal transport convention which is broad enough in scope to govern the rights and liabilities of all parties in a multimodal carriage contracts, including inland carriers and their contractors or sub-carriers (referred to as performing parties) in the new Convention...|$|E
