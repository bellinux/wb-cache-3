40|$|Introduction A {{revised version}} of this paper has been {{released}} in July 2009. The origins of BIS activities in the field of international financial statistics go back to the mid- 1960 s and the emergence of the so-called eurocurrency markets that had sprung up to circumvent domestic regulations. At that time the key policy concern that gave rise to the joint data collection exercise by the central banks of the G 10 countries {{under the aegis of the}} BIS was the need to monitor the rapid growth of these markets and its possible monetary implications. This led to the introduction of reporting by internationally active banks of their international positions in major individual currencies, with a geographical and partial sectoral breakdown. On the basis of these reports the central banks and the BIS compiled the so-called locational banking statistics for various lending and borrowing countries. In the subsequent years, the issue of recycling the current account surpluses of oil-producing countries shifted the emphasis in favour of a more detailed geographical breakdown and of flow data. In the context of the deregulation of domestic financial systems and capital flows in the 1970 s and 1980 s these concerns abated, but in their place came others, notably the rise in the indebtedness of many developing countries to international banks in the early 1980 s. This build-up was visible in the existing locational banking statistics collected and published by the BIS, but it was not possible to evaluate in a comprehensive way the risk characteristics of the exposures of national banking systems to individual borrowing countries. The need for such information therefore led to the reporting of a second set of international banking data on a fully consolidated basis. A <b>maturity</b> <b>breakdown</b> of the consolidated banking claims was also introduced at that time. In response to calls for more up-to-date information on the international lending activities of banks, the BIS began in the early 1990 s to collect and publish data on signed syndicated credit facilities. More recently, with the objective of enhancing the analysis of country risk exposures, efforts have been made to achieve a more complete and detailed reporting of consolidated banking data on an ultimate risk basis, including off-balance sheet positions relating to bank's derivatives transactions. As a result of the increasing role of the international securities markets in global financial intermediation, the BIS was mandated in the mid- 1980 s to collect and publish statistics on these markets on the basis of data from commercial databases and information available to individual central banks. In the 1990 s the BIS also became increasingly involved in the coordination of joint surveys that central banks carried out on a regular basis to monitor activity in global foreign exchange markets. Moreover, as derivatives markets expanded in the wake of financial innovation, central banks asked the BIS to collect and publish international data on exchange-traded and over-the-counter derivatives transactions. The development of the BIS international financial statistics thus reflects evolving central bank concerns relating to monetary and financial stability in the context of worldwide financial market deregulation, innovation and globalisation. In addition to their use for policy-related monitoring purposes by central banks, the international financial statistics have meanwhile proved to be of interest to private sector market participants. The latter have come to recognise the unique value of the BIS data for tracking the borrowing by emerging market countries from the international banking and securities markets. The BIS data are also used by the IMF in the compilation of its international financial statistics and in its surveillance of individual economies. Moreover, the BIS data have proved to be useful for improving balance of payment statistics and for measuring and monitoring developing countries' foreign debt. With respect to the latter, following the 1997 Asian debt crisis the IMF, OECD, World Bank and BIS pooled their respective statistics to collectively publish data from creditor and market sources on countries' foreign indebtedness. Apart from providing insights into the geographical distributions of international financial flows and external vulnerabilities and risk exposures of debtors and creditors, the international financial statistics collected and disseminated by the BIS contain important information on the structural developments in international financial markets. They can be used, for instance, to analyse the importance of individual financial centres (including so-called offshore centres), the emergence of new relationships between financial and non-financial firms, the level and concentration of activity in financial markets as well as spillovers between different market segments. Much of this is not easily available elsewhere. The statistics become even more valuable when they are combined with other sources covering financial asset prices, market liquidity and trading patterns, external ratings, and the activity of non-bank financial firms and non-financial companies. They then allow market participants and policymakers to make an assessment of credit and liquidity risks in domestic and international financial markets as well as of potential vulnerabilities to systemic disturbances in these markets. The usefulness of the international financial statistics is, of course, potentially affected by the fact that the boundaries between international and domestic markets are becoming more blurred. This could, on the one hand, constitute a weakness of the statistics as it may become increasingly difficult to define and distinguish pure international financial market activity from that in domestic markets. On the other hand, as this guide explains and illustrates, the methodology of the international statistics has tried to keep pace with such developments and to ensure that financial analysts are aware of the limitations of the statistics. Moreover, given that financial innovations have often started in the competitive environment of the international financial markets and that market sentiments are becoming increasingly correlated internationally, the BIS statistics have been and continue to be a very useful tool to capture structural and market developments in global markets at an early stage. The BIS, and the central banking community working through it, have also taken steps to complement the publication of the international financial statistics with a selection of highlights and analyses of major market trends. In the case of the BIS this applies to the press releases accompanying the release of new data; to the BIS Quarterly Review, which contains more in-depth analysis of specific issues, and to its Annual Report, which analyses long-term trends and emerging policy issues. The statistics are also mentioned and explained regularly in presentations by senior BIS officials to central banks, market participants and academics. Other initiatives to promote the use of the statistics include making them available in electronic form on the BIS website and updating the guidelines and methodological notes on a regular basis. Work on collecting, compiling and disseminating the BIS international financial statistics is closely related to, and guided by, the activities of the various Basel-based committees and expert groups as well as those of other international institutions. The Committee on the Global Financial System (CGFS) plays a key role in reaching a consensus on priorities to improve the BIS statistics. With respect to international banking data, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) is consulted on methodological issues to help ensure the collection of adequate statistical information from internationally active banks on risk exposures. The Financial Stability Forum (FSF) has also formulated a number of recommendations to enhance statistics on international financial markets and capital flows that are taken into account by the BIS in its statistical work. As a result of the strong support of these groups it has been possible to improve on the reporting frequency and timeliness of the international financial statistics in recent years. One of the major underlying objectives of the various Basel-based groups is to strengthen financial stability through transparency and market discipline. Increased public disclosure plays a key role in this and should, over time, lead to better quantitative and qualitative information on the activities and risk profiles of individual institutions as well as market infrastructures such as payment, settlement and trading systems. With respect to the functioning of domestic and international financial markets, various proposals have been made to complement the BIS statistics on banking, securities, foreign exchange and derivatives markets over time by improved aggregate information on liquidity, leverage and position-taking in these markets. More recently the IMF has been elaborating a methodology for the collection by individual countries of comprehensive financial soundness indicators, which should complement the BIS statistics. The disclosure framework on the exposures and capital structure of internationally active banks proposed under the New Basel Capital Accord (its so-called Pillar III) should contribute to better balance sheet data of individual internationally active banks. This Guide is structured around the three main areas of the BIS international financial statistics: the international banking statistics (Part II); the securities statistics (Part III); and the derivatives and foreign exchange statistics (Parts IV and V). It also provides a description of the joint BIS-IMF-OECD-World Bank statistics on external debt for which the BIS is a main contributor of data (Part VI). The guide provides a detailed description of the sources, compilation, transformation and publication of the data. Two separate chapters on the quality and the uses of the statistics (Parts VII and VIII) follow the description of the statistics. A more detailed description of the BIS international banking statistics and their underlying methodology is provided in a separate guide. This Guide has been prepared by Paul Van den Bergh, Rainer Widera, Karsten von Kleist, Jesper Wormstrup and others in the Monetary and Economic Department of the BIS. Chapter VIII draws largely on an article by Philip Wooldridge. ...|$|E
40|$|Executive Summary The Asian crisis {{highlighted}} {{deficiencies in}} the availability of information relating to the on and off-balance-sheet foreign currency activities of central banks and other public sector entities. This led the G- 10 Governors to ask the Euro-currency Standing Committee to establish a working group to develop a disclosure framework to address these shortcomings. Specifically, the group was asked to identify the statistical information that would enable markets to better assess the authorities' foreign currency liquidity position. This position comprises the foreign exchange resources {{at the disposal of}} the authorities that are easily mobilisable in times of need and the potential drains on those resources associated with the authorities' short-term foreign currency liabilities. The group was also asked to report on the most suitable framework for public disclosure, the specific form and content of the information to be released and the additional practical steps necessary to implement the chosen strategy. In its deliberations the group recognised that improvements in disclosure practices by G- 10 countries could help to encourage similar behaviour in emerging market countries. The analysis and recommendations of the working group should be assessed in the context of initiatives relating to disclosure currently under way in other forums. These include the work of a working party on transparency and accountability commissioned by a group of finance ministers and central bank governors from 22 economies (the "Willard Group") and planned steps by the IMF Executive Board to strengthen the Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS). In recognition of these initiatives, an IMF representative was {{invited to participate in the}} working group and information on disclosure practices was shared with the Willard Group working party. A representative from the European Central Bank (ECB) was also asked to participate in the group. The working group is of the opinion that a significant move towards enhanced disclosure is justified as regards both the content and the timeliness of the information. This conclusion was reached on the basis of a review of current disclosure practices in relation to the liquidity concept outlined in previous discussions among Governors and a cost/benefit analysis of such a step. Prevailing practices generally fall well short of providing the relevant information, particularly as concerns the potential short-term drains on reserves. As most recently highlighted by the Asian crisis, the failure to disclose the forward book of the monetary authorities is one important example. The main benefits of enhanced disclosure would be to improve the accountability of the authorities and the scope for markets to exercise financial discipline. This, in turn, could help to induce an earlier correction of unsustainable policies and allow market participants to form a more accurate view of the condition of individual countries, thereby also possibly limiting contagion. It was noted that effective market discipline mechanisms also require an appropriate framework for disclosure and reporting by private sector entities. Differing views were expressed in this regard and the group acknowledged that this issue deserved further analysis. The group weighed the possible benefits of greater transparency against some potential costs. These were seen as being primarily associated with reduced operational flexibility to intervene covertly in order to counteract exchange market pressures, with the uncertainties involved in the transition towards a more demanding disclosure standard and with the logistical burdens of implementation. The specific recommendations of the group take the form of: a "disclosure template" outlining the content of the information to be disclosed; prescribed standards of timeliness, including both periodicity and disclosure lags; a timetable for implementation; and a proposal for further work on disclosure standards for private market participants. The disclosure template, summarised below, has three distinguishing features. Firstly, it aims to be as comprehensive as possible with respect to the coverage of both institutions and financial instruments. As regards institutions, conceptually the template is intended to apply to all the public sector entities that would be responsible for, or involved in, counteracting currency crises. In practice, this should at least include the monetary authorities, defined here to include both the central bank and the central government (excluding social security), but depending on institutional arrangements could extend to other public sector entities. As regards financial instruments, the template attempts to cover all the relevant on and off-balance-sheet liquid assets and short-term liabilities. Comprehensiveness is designed to provide a meaningful picture and to limit the scope for shifting components of the liquidity position to undisclosed items. Secondly, the template seeks to be sufficiently detailed to allow market participants to reach informed judgements about both reserves and drains on them. Detail is provided in several respects. These include, inter alia: a sectoral breakdown (notably as between the monetary authorities and other public sector entities); the separate identification of financial instruments that might vary in terms of liquidity (e. g., gold, deposits with banks headquartered in the reporting country) or cash flow characteristics (e. g., contingent vs. predetermined; time profiles, as captured by a residual <b>maturity</b> <b>breakdown</b> of the fixed-term liabilities); and complementary memorandum items (e. g., undrawn unconditional lines of credit, debt indexed to foreign currency). Finally, the template prescribes valuation principles that are consistent with the focus on liquidity. This suggests reporting, as far as possible, mobilisable foreign exchange resources at (approximate) market values and the future profile of drains on these resources in nominal terms (the cash flow value when the drain occurs). The group recommends endorsement of the template. At the same time, it recognises that improvements are possible. A review by technical experts of the details of the presentation would be helpful in identifying improvements in the way some of the information is portrayed and in accomplishing effective implementation. The issues to be addressed include, in particular, the treatment of derivatives positions and the clarification of the relationship between the definitions used in the report and those adopted in the balance-of-payments conventions, which are largely based on the residence criterion. It is recommended that technical experts be asked to report on these issues as soon as possible. The working group devoted much attention to the issue of timeliness, particularly in the light of the substantial element of judgement called for in examining this question. There are two features of information disclosure that affect timeliness: the disclosure lag, which determines how out-of-date the information is when released; and the frequency or periodicity of the disclosure, which determines the extent to which the information ages between releases and affects the incremental "news" content of the release. The group agreed that a common frequency and disclosure lag should apply to all the items of the template (except one memorandum item, viz. the currency composition by group of currencies). To do otherwise could greatly undermine the template's usefulness as it would provide an avenue for concealing changes in liquidity through whatever items are reported in the least timely fashion. The group also agreed that it is technically feasible to set a very high frequency and short lag. At the same time, the concomitant gains in terms of market discipline had to be weighed against the possible need for flexibility in exchange market operations, either for reserve management purposes or for covert intervention. In order to preserve flexibility in reserve management, the group decided to allow for less frequent and less detailed disclosure of the currency composition of the portfolio. Furthermore, forward positions should be reported only insofar as the domestic currency is involved, since only those transactions imply a future change in total official reserves. As concerns covert intervention, views regarding the true extent and value of such flexibility varied somewhat within the group. This reflected several factors, notably differing experiences with exchange rate regimes, institutional settings and opinions about the range and likelihood of circumstances in which it was regarded as useful to retain market uncertainty about the occurrence and/or size of the authorities' operations. Two further considerations argued against a rapid move to the highest feasible frequency and shortest feasible lag: implementation costs (especially in the context of efforts to address the "Year 2000 problem" and the introduction of the euro); and, given the residual uncertainties involved, concerns that such a step, once taken, would be costly to reverse if it proved unwarranted. In the light of these concerns, the group recommends that a first step would be to adopt a standard of a one-month frequency and a disclosure lag certainly not exceeding one month, to be implemented on or before end-June 1999. Since the frequency and disclosure lag would apply to all the categories of the template - except one memorandum item - this would already represent a significant improvement compared with current practices. In addition, the group notes that central banks are not the only holders of foreign currency reserves or liabilities, so that the full implementation of its recommendations would also require endorsement and corresponding action by other public sector entities, in particular finance ministries or treasuries. The group also considered the benefits associated with similar transparency about the risk positions, including foreign currency positions, of all private financial intermediaries. The group was of the opinion that further parallel work is needed in this area. It noted that an initial analysis had been carried out by the Euro-currency Standing Committee in 1994, as published in the report on "public disclosure of market and credit risks by financial intermediaries" (the "Fisher Report"). In connection with the enhanced disclosure proposed for the official sector, the group recommends that the ECSC now revisit the question of the appropriate disclosure standards for all market participants with a view to elaborating a set of good practices. ...|$|E

Dry weight percentage of pericarp tissue near the stem insertion (30 - 35 per cent) compared with that near the proximal end of the seed (15 per cent) reflect in part a marked contrast in oil content of these tissues.
