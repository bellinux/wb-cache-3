40|$|Conventional {{optical memory}} discs store {{information}} {{in the form of}} pits embossed on the disc. The minimum size of the pit marks is limited by the resolution of the optical system used to read the disc. Our investigations, presented in this thesis, are primarily concerned with the question, "Can an optical disc memory be designed so that an optical system can recover information from symbols (pit marks or otherwise) which are normally unresolved?" When an optical system can determine unresolved features of an object, then superresolution has been accomplished. We describe an experiment to recover information about lines with a width one fifth the <b>minimum</b> <b>resolvable</b> <b>feature</b> size. The result uncovers an important difference between an optical memory and a classical optical imaging system: in an optical memory, we can use a priori information about the finite number of possible stored states. The next investigation is for superresolution in depth, rather than for a lateral direction. We select the method of conoscopic holography and demonstrate the ability to measure the depth of a reflecting surface with an accuracy better than one-tenth the depth of focus of the optical system. To allow the design and analysis of a memory format, we formulate an integral method to calculate diffraction for large numerical aperture focused beams on nonperiodic two-dimensional structures. The numerical method is tested for numerical convergence and accuracy, and some comparisons of numerical results and experimental measurements are also shown. We then use the numerical method extensively to analyze a variety of formats and structures...|$|E
40|$|An inverse {{relationship}} exists in optical systems between {{the depth of}} field (DOF) and the <b>minimum</b> <b>resolvable</b> <b>feature</b> size. This trade-off is especially detrimental in high numerical aperture microscopy systems where resolution is pushed to the diffraction limit resulting in a DOF {{on the order of}} 500 nm. Many biological structures and processes of interest span over micron scales resulting in significant blurring during imaging. This thesis explores a two-step computational imaging technique known as hybrid imaging to create extended DOF (EDF) microscopy systems with minimal sacrifice in resolution. In the first step a mask is inserted at the pupil plane of the microscope to create a focus invariant system over 10 times the traditional DOF, albeit with reduced contrast. In the second step the contrast is restored via deconvolution. Several EDF pupil masks from the literature are quantitatively compared in the context of biological microscopy. From this analysis a new mask is proposed, the incoherently partitioned pupil with binary phase modulation (IPP-BPM), that combines the most advantageous properties from the literature. Total variation regularized deconvolution models are derived for the various noise conditions and detectors commonly used in biological microscopy. State of the art algorithms for efficiently solving the deconvolution problem are analyzed for speed, accuracy, and ease of use. The IPP-BPM mask is compared with the literature and shown to have the highest signal-to-noise ratio and lowest mean square error post-processing. A prototype of the IPP-BPM mask is fabricated using a combination of 3 D femtosecond glass etching and standard lithography techniques. The mask is compared against theory and demonstrated in biological imaging applications...|$|E

This thesis characterizes the <b>minimum</b> <b>resolvable</b> <b>feature</b> size and process latitude of Conformable Contact Lithography. Beginning with {{a review of}} current lithographic patterning techniques, choice of Conformable Contract Lithography as an exposure technique is discussed. A design for a trilayer stack that optimizes optical properties is established using experimental and simulated reflectance data to choose appropriate stack film thicknesses. The simulated process latitude is constructed using electromagnetic simulations of grating patterns. Image analysis of experimentally-exposed diffraction grating patterns is described and used to characterize the effect of exposure dose on printed linewidth. The resulting simulated and experimental process latitudes for printed gratings are presented for masks utilizing protruding chrome lines and embedded chrome lines. Experimental and simulated reflectance for single-layer and bilayer film stacks are compared to yield an optimized trilayer stack design of 225 nm of anti-reflection-coating chemically separated from the resist by 70 nm of evaporated silicon oxide. This design results in less than 1. 5 % back-reflection from the oxide into the resist for 10 % film thickness variation. Finite-difference time-domain simulations are optimized by comparing higher variable-resolution, more realistic simulations to more efficient, lower variable-resolution simulations. Building on the trilayer stack and optimal simulation specification, simulated exposures of diffraction gratings are analyzed assuming a clipping model of development. Exposures of dense grating patterns with two geometries are performed on trilayer-stack-coated silicon wafers {{for a range of}} doses. (cont.) Transferred grating patterns are analyzed to establish the effect of exposure dose on printed linewidth. A 5 % experimental process latitude is achieved at a printed linewidth tolerance of ± 15 % for the embedded chrome mask exposures and of 25 % for the protruding chrome mask exposures. Within the resist, contrast is higher at smaller gratings using the embedded mask. by Corey Patrick Fucetola. Thesis (M. Eng.)

40|$|The <b>minimum</b> <b>resolvable</b> {{temperature}} difference (MRTD), the <b>minimum</b> <b>resolvable</b> contrast (MRC), and the triangle orientation discrimination (TOD) are end-to-end EO system performance measures; that is, laboratory measures that characterize EO system performance {{with a human}} observer in the loop. Such system performance measures are used: 1) to verify if a system is working properly; 2) to compare competing sensor systems; or 3) to predict field performance. The MRTD or MRT is defined in NATO STANAG 4349 (NATO Standard Agreement[1]). The primary measure of performance for IR/EO imaging systems is the MRT/MRC. It is a visual acuity test that combines sensitivity and resolution {{in a manner that}} reflects human performance through a sensor. Basically, a standard periodic four-bar pattern on a uniform background (Fig. 1) is presented to an observer using the camera under test. The observer adjusts the lowest contrast at which the four bars can be resolved. The procedure is repeated at several spatial frequencies and yields a relation or threshold curve between spatial frequency and <b>minimum</b> <b>resolvable</b> {{temperature difference}}.

40|$|MRTD (<b>Minimum</b> <b>Resolvable</b> Temperature Difference) The {{characterization}} of electro-optical system performance {{by means of}} the standard <b>minimum</b> <b>resolvable</b> temperature difference (MRTD) or the <b>minimum</b> <b>resolvable</b> contrast (MRC) has a number of serious disadvantages. One of the problems is that they depend on the subjective decision criterion of the observer. We present an improved measurement procedure in which the results are free from observer bias. In an adaptive two-alternative forced-choice (2 AFC) procedure, both the standard four-bar pattern and a five-bar reference pattern of the same size and contrast are presented consecutively in random order. The observer decides which of the two presentations contains the four-bar pattern. Misjudgments are made if the bars cannot be resolved or are distorted by sampling. The procedure converges to the contrast at which 75 % of the observer responses are correct. The reliability of the responses is tested statistically. Curves cut off near the Nyquist frequency, so that {{it is not necessary to}} artificially set a frequency limit for sampling array cameras. The procedure enables better and easier measurement, yields more stable results than the standard procedure, and avoids disputes between different measuring teams. The presented procedure is a 'quick fix' solution for some of the problems with the MRTD and MRC, and is recommended as long as bar patterns are used as the stimulus. A new and fundamentally better method to characterize electro-optical system performance, called the triangle orientation discrimination threshold (TOD) was recently proposed by Bijl and Valeton (1998) ...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{characterization of}} electro-optical sensors {{and that of}} image enhancement techniques {{has always been a}} difficult task. Up to now the sensor is characterized using the <b>minimum</b> <b>resolvable</b> temperature difference (MRTD) or the <b>minimum</b> <b>resolvable</b> contrast (MRC). The performance of image enhancement techniques is done by visual inspection by a human observer. Since in more and more cameras some kind of image processing is applied, a more elaborate test is needed that can measure the performance of the combination of the sensor and the image processing. A good candidate is the TOD (Triangle Orientation Discrimination) method, which is developed as an alternative for MRTD and the MRC methods. We are investigating how the standard TOD-method can be extended to cameras with image processing and whether these measurements can be automated. An algorithm is under development, which is based on the TOD-method and predicts the characterization by human observers of camera-system performances. The algorithm combines the TOD-method, an early-vision model, and an orientation discriminator. The algorithm uses the same images as used in human-observer experiments. After correction for the physical properties of the display and the human eye, the algorithm tries to find the orientation of the stimulus. The algorithm can also predict the performance of only image processing using a simple scene-generator in stead of a camera setup...|$|R
40|$|The <b>minimum</b> <b>resolvable</b> {{temperature}} difference in quantitative thermographic imaging is essentially determined by photo- detector noise processes. In fast scan devices the overall detector noise envelope may be + 0. 5 °C. When imaging quasi- static thermal scenes, inte-gration of successive frames (signal averaging) {{can be used}} to reduce the effect of detector noise. However, many interesting thermal scenes are rapidly changing, such as the thermal pattern resulting from a laser pulse or from radio frequency energy applied to tissues, and frame integration cannot be applied. In the transient temperature measurement case, some smoothing operator must be used to improve the <b>minimum</b> <b>resolvable</b> {{temperature difference}}. Linear smoothing operators, such as averaging and gaussian filters, all have the undesirable side effect of smearing the few edges and other small details in the thermal image. Median filters offer the potential of filtering detector noise while preserving edges and other details. Because the median operator is inherently nonlinear, its effect on the accuracy of measured temperatures cannot be predicted a priori. For the photo- detector studied, photoconductive mercury- cadmium-telluride, the detector noise process was determined to have a symmetrical probability density function. Thus the median filter yielded an excellent estimate of the uncorrupted signal with no degradation of edges or other details. The median filter is compared to a triangular window function...|$|R

In some situations, MEMS micromirrors tend to change their bow during laser irradiation. A test regime including a characterization unit for the in situ analysis of MEMS micromirror topology has been developed to measure the bow change under various irradiation conditions. Experiments in which SLMs were irradiated by a 1 -kHz, 248 -nmpulse laser revealed that mirror bowing can occur in both directions (concave and convex). The bowing direction is dependent upon the applied irradiation parameters such as pulse-energy density, pulse number, and the deposited energy.

3000|$|Because {{the size}} of the {{detector}} is negligible relative to the length scales of a volcano, we use a coordinate system in which each point on a plane is determined by an angle and a distance (the distance between the detector and the object: R). The muon transmission image (muon radiograph) is therefore mapped in the angular coordinate. The angular coordinate (also known as the zenith angle or the azimuth angle and denoted by θ or φ) denotes the positive or anticlockwise angle required to reach the point from the 0 ° ray. The <b>minimum</b> <b>resolvable</b> distance (spatial resolution: ΔX, ΔY) at an object is defined by the <b>minimum</b> <b>resolvable</b> angle of the detector.

Using the data as a function of vertical (θ) and horizontal (φ) angles with an angular resolution of Δθ and Δφ, we can obtain the value of the density length along the muon path as a function of θ or φ with steps of Δθ and Δφ.

The diagnostic was based on the principles of Doppler spectroscopy, namely, that the wavelength of a moving light source is shifted proportional to its velocity and the width of an emission line varies with temperature. The emission line at 229. 7 nm of Carbon III, an impurity ion in the hydrogen plasma, was imaged and its location and width measured. The IDS system being a work in progress, the <b>minimum</b> <b>resolvable</b> linewidth is higher than the linewidth we expect to see based on previous experiments and so detailed temperature and velocity measurements could not be carried out.

Furthermore, the new methodologies reduce the subjectivity of the performance parameters such as the standard <b>minimum</b> <b>resolvable</b> temperature difference (MRTD) and tend to reduce the time (and thus cost) of measurement. The three methods described concern the use of (1) and IR zoom collimator, (2) a test device with line targets, and (3) an extended target combined with a TV camera instead of a human observer and a double-line source, resolving the ambiguity beyond the Ny-quist frequency in staring focal plane array cameras. In the IR zoom collimator a variety of targets are used in four different orientations; the observer has to report not only the recognition, but also the orientation of the target. Instead of variation of the temperature difference of the target, its range is varied by zooming in and out. In the rapid objective MRTD tester, the performance of the eye is simulated with a simple formula. The complete MRTD is obtained in about two minutes.
