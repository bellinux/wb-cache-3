40|$|Abstract Endometrial cancer {{belongs to}} the commonest {{malignancy}} in females. Its development {{may be associated with}} the high exposure of endometrium to exo- and endog-enous estrogens. Estrogens produce DNA bulky adducts and oxidative base damages which are removed in nucleotide excision repair (NER) and base excision repair (BER) path-ways. The reaction of endometrial cells to DNA damage may be crucial for their susceptibility to cancer transforma-tion. This reaction is executed mainly by DNA repair, which can be modulated by the variability in the genes encoding DNA repair proteins. In this report we genotyped 4 poly-morphisms of 3 DNA repair genes in 94 endometrial cancer patients and 114 age-matched cancer-free women using RFLP-PCR. The following polymorphisms were studied: p. Arg 194 Trp, p. Arg 399 Gln of the XRCC 1 gene, p. Ser 326 Cys of the hOGG 1 gene and p. Lys 751 Gln of <b>the</b> <b>ERCC</b> 2 gene. We found an association between <b>the</b> <b>ERCC</b> 2 751 Gln variant and endometrial cancer occurrence (OR 3. 95; 95 % CI 1. 88 – 8. 31). Gene-gene interaction between <b>the</b> <b>ERCC</b> 2 751 Gln and XRCC 1 194 Trp variants also in-creased the risk of endometrial cancer (OR 4. 41; 95 % CI 2. 01 – 9. 67).

40|$|During {{eukaryotic}} Nucleotide Excision Repair, DNA cleavage by XPF requires heterodimer formation with <b>ERCC</b> 1. <b>The</b> aim of {{the current}} thesis was to address the structure-function relationship of <b>the</b> obligate <b>ERCC</b> 1 /XPF heterodimer. In this line, we have determined <b>the</b> structure of <b>ERCC</b> 1 /XPF C-terminal interacting domains by NMR. ERCC 1 and XPF partners share the same fold, the double helix-hairpin-helix motif (HhH 2), and complex in a symmetry related manner. The same dimer interface is observed in the archaeal XPF, which forms homodimers. The archaeal HhH 2 domains bind equally to DNA minor grooves, {{in agreement with the}} substrate specificity of the archaeal XPF nuclease. In contrast, human ERCC 1 /XPF cleaves relevant DNA substrates, which consist of one minor groove. We have shown that exclusively the HhH 2 domain of ERCC 1 mediates minor groove binding. The functional asymmetry in humans is related to the altered second hairpin of XPF, revealed by the structure. Though non-functional this domain acts as scaffold for the folding of <b>the</b> <b>ERCC</b> 1 corresponding domain. We concluded that <b>ERCC</b> 1 possesses <b>the</b> DNA binding activity that serves to localize the XPF nuclease activity to the NER pre-incision complex and allow for damage excision. Next, we determined the structure of <b>the</b> <b>ERCC</b> 1 central domain and investigate its contribution to the heterodimeric function. Although this domain shows structural homology with the catalytically active XPF nuclease domain, it has a distinct function by performing interactions with XPA, another NER protein. This function is crucial as it anchors the XPF nuclease in the pre-incision NER complex and subsequently allows cleavage to occur. Remarkably, the XPA binding by <b>ERCC</b> 1 and <b>the</b> catalytic function of XPF are dependent on structurally homologous regions. Furthermore <b>the</b> <b>ERCC</b> 1 central domain can bind ss-DNA. XPA and DNA interactions can happen simultaneously through distinct surfaces and indicate the significant dual role of <b>the</b> <b>ERCC</b> 1 central domain in targeting the XPF nuclease to the sites of DNA damage. Overall, the structural data from human and archaeal species show that <b>the</b> human <b>ERCC</b> 1 and XPF proteins share the architectural subunits of the archaeal XPF homodimer. The structural similarities provide evidence for the common origin of the human proteins. Based on the functional data we proposed that ERCC 1 and XPF genes evolved by subfunctionalization, which resulted in the partitioning of the original functions after duplication of the ancestral XPF gene.

In fact, <b>the</b> correlation between <b>ERCC</b> 1 expression and the resistance to chemotherapeutic treatments makes ERCC 1 a potential biomarker for the prediction of chemoresistance and patient survival. In the research described in this thesis the heterodimeric complex of the tandem Helix-hirpin-Helix (HhH) 2 domains of ERCC 1 -XPF was studied, as well as its stability and role in DNA recognition. In her thesis, Maryam Faridounnia, has given a detailed look into <b>the</b> interaction between <b>ERCC</b> 1 and XPF in <b>the</b> <b>ERCC</b> 1 -XPF complex. She has analyzed the stability of <b>the</b> <b>ERCC</b> 1 -XPF complex from a thermodynamic and a kinetic perspective and has discussed the factors contributing to the stability of the heterodimeric complex. Furthermore, she presented a model that explains the preferred formation of ERCC 1 -XPF heterodimers. Then, she investigated the effects of the disease-related F 231 L ERCC 1 mutation (F 231 L). F 231 is part of <b>the</b> cavity of <b>ERCC</b> 1, which contains the F 894 anchor of XPF. It is shown that the F 231 L mutation causes a small but significant destabilization of <b>the</b> interaction between <b>ERCC</b> 1 and XPF. Loss of function of ERCC 1 -XPF endonuclease in diverse DNA repair pathways especially ICL repair can in some cases lead to the severe COFS syndrome. In principle, this explains the observed phenotype of the patient for which the F 231 L mutation was established. A functional property of <b>the</b> <b>ERCC</b> 1 -XPF (HhH) 2 domains is its capacity to bind near damaged DNA to the single strand/double strand (ds/ss) DNA junctions. Maryam examined the model for binding of ERCC 1 -XPF at a ds/ssDNA junction. This model was initially based on interactions between XPF (HhH) 2 homodimers and short ssDNA nucleotides. The original model is validated with interaction studies of heterodimeric ERCC 1 -XPF and different DNA substrates, including ds/ssDNA forks. The biochemical and biophysical data show that <b>the</b> <b>ERCC</b> 1 (HhH) 2 domain binds primarily to dsDNA and {{that at the same time}} the XPF (HhH) 2 domain can bind to ssDNA.

40|$|The {{nucleotide}} {{excision repair}} protein complex ERCC 1 -XPF {{is required for}} incision of DNA upstream of DNA damage. Functional studies have provided insights into <b>the</b> binding of <b>ERCC</b> 1 -XPF to various DNA substrates. However, because no structure for <b>the</b> <b>ERCC</b> 1 -XPF-DNA complex has been determined, the mechanism of substrate recognition remains elusive. Here we biochemically characterize the substrate preferences of the helix-hairpin-helix (HhH) domains of XPF and ERCC-XPF and show that the binding to single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) /dsDNA junctions is dependent on joint binding to the DNA binding domain of ERCC 1 and XPF. We reveal that the homodimeric XPF is able to bind various ssDNA sequences but with a clear preference for guanine-containing substrates. NMR titration experiments and in vitro DNA binding assays also show that, within <b>the</b> heterodimeric <b>ERCC</b> 1 -XPF complex, XPF specifically recognizes ssDNA. On the other hand, the HhH domain of ERCC 1 preferentially binds dsDNA through the hairpin region. The two separate non-overlapping DNA binding domains in <b>the</b> <b>ERCC</b> 1 -XPF heterodimer jointly bind to an ssDNA/dsDNA substrate and, thereby, at least partially dictate the incision position during damage removal. Based on structural models, NMR titrations, DNA-binding studies, site-directed mutagenesis, charge distribution, and sequence conservation, we propose that the HhH domain of ERCC 1 binds to dsDNA upstream of the damage, and XPF binds to the non-damaged strand within a repair bubble...|$|R
40|$|High {{mobility}} group A 2 (HMGA 2) chromosomal {{non-histone protein}} and its derivatives {{play an important}} role in development and progression of benign and malignant tumors, obesity and arteriosclerosis, although the underlying mechanisms of these conditions are poorly understood. Therefore, we tried to identify target genes for this transcriptional regulator and to provide insights in the mechanism of interaction to its target. Multiple genes have been identified by microarray experiments as being transcriptionally regulated by HMGA 2. Among these we chose <b>the</b> <b>ERCC</b> 1 gene, encoding a DNA repair protein, for this study. DNA-binding studies were performed using HMGA 2 and C-terminally truncated ΔHMGA 2, a derivative that is frequently observed in a variety of tumors. A unique high affinity HMGA 2 binding site was mapped to a specific AT-rich region located – 323 to – 298 upstream of <b>the</b> <b>ERCC</b> 1 transcription start site, distinguishing it from other potential AT-rich binding sites. The observed 1 : 1 stoichiometry for the binding of wild-type HMGA 2 to this region was altered to 1 : 2 upon binding of truncated ΔHMGA 2, causing DNA bending. Furthermore, the regulatory effect of HMGA 2 was confirmed by luciferase promoter assays showing that ERCC 1 promoter activity is down-regulated by all investigated HMGA 2 forms, with the most striking effect exerted by ΔHMGA 2. Our results provide the first insights into how HMGA 2 and its aberrant forms bind and regulate <b>the</b> <b>ERCC</b> 1 promoter...|$|R

Despite this severe NER defect, both patients display a late onset of neurologic impairment, mild cutaneous symptoms, and a striking absence of skin tumors even at an age of > 40 years.

40|$|Recently, it {{has become}} {{apparent}} that DNA repair mechanisms {{are involved in the}} malignant progression and resistance to therapy of gliomas. Many investigators have shown that increased levels of O 6 -methyl guanine DNA alkyltransferase, a DNA monoalkyl adduct repair enzyme, are correlated with resistance of malignant glioma cell lines to nitrosourea-based chemotherapy. Three important DNA excision repair genes ERCC 1 (excision repair cross complementation group 1), ERCC 2 (excision repair cross complementation group 2), and ERCC 6 (excision repair cross complementation group 6) have been studied in human tumors. Gene copy number variation of ERCC 1 and ERCC 2 has been observed in primary glioma tissues. A number of reports describing a relationship between ERCC 1 gene alterations and resistance to anti-cancer drugs have been also described. <b>The</b> levels of <b>ERCC</b> 1 gene expression, however, have not been correlated with drug resistance in gliomas. <b>The</b> expression of <b>ERCC</b> 6 gene transcribes has been shown to vary with tissue types and to be highest in the brain. There have been no comprehensive studies so far, however, of ERCC 6 gene expression and molecular alterations in malignant glioma. This project examined <b>the</b> <b>ERCC</b> 1 expression levels and correlated them with cisplatin resistance in malignant glioma cell lines. We also examined the molecular alterations of ERCC 6 gene in primary glioma tissues and cells and analyzed whether these alterations are related to tumor progression and chemotherapy resistance. Our results indicate the presence of mutations and/or deletions in exons II and V of <b>the</b> <b>ERCC</b> 6 gene, and these alterations are more frequent in exon II. Furthermore, the mutations and/or deletions in exon II were shown to be associated with increased malignant grade of gliomas.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Excision repair cross {{complementing}} group 5 (ERCC 5 or XPG) {{plays an}} important role in regulating DNA excision repair, removal of bulky lesions caused by environmental chemicals or UV light. Mutations in this gene cause a rare autosomal recessive syndrome, and its functional single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) may alter DNA repair capacity phenotype and cancer risk. However, a series of epidemiological studies on the association between <b>the</b> <b>ERCC</b> 5 Asp 1104 His polymorphism (rs 17655, G>C) and cancer susceptibility generated conflicting results. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: To derive a more precise estimation of the association between <b>the</b> <b>ERCC</b> 5 Asp 1104 His polymorphism and overall cancer risk, we performed a meta-analysis of 44 published case-control studies, in which a total of 23, 490 cases and 27, 168 controls were included. To provide additional biological plausibility, we also assessed the genotype-gene expression correlation from the HapMap phase II release 23 data with 270 individuals from 4 ethnic populations. When all studies were pooled, we found no statistical evidence for a significantly increased cancer risk in the recessive genetic models (His/His vs. Asp/Asp: OR =  0. 99, 95 % CI: 0. 92 - 1. 06, P =  0. 242 for heterogeneity or His/His vs. Asp/His + Asp/Asp: OR =  0. 98, 95 % CI: 0. 93 - 1. 03, P =  0. 260 for heterogeneity), nor in further stratified analyses by cancer type, ethnicity, source of controls and sample size. In the genotype-phenotype correlation analysis from 270 individuals, we consistently found no significant correlation of the Asp 1104 His polymorphism with ERCC 5 mRNA expression.
