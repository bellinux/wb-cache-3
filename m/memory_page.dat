Note a problem exists if the depth exceeds the bit {{size of an}} integer, because then doubling of the directory or splitting of a bucket won't allow entries to be rehashed to different buckets.|$|E

50|$|In pre-copy memory migration, the Hypervisor {{typically}} copies all the <b>memory</b> <b>pages</b> from {{source to}} destination while the VM is still {{running on the}} source. If some <b>memory</b> <b>pages</b> change (become 'dirty') during this process, they will be re-copied until the rate of re-copied pages {{is not less than}} page dirtying rate.|$|R

50|$|Instead of {{an actual}} memory {{location}} the segment information includes the address of a page table for the segment.When a program references a memory location the offset is translated to a memory address using the page table. A segment can be extended simply by allocating another <b>memory</b> <b>page</b> and adding it to the segment's page table.|$|E
5000|$|If an {{appropriate}} traversal order is used (such as cdr-first for list conses), objects {{can be moved}} {{very close to the}} objects they refer to in memory, increasing the chance that they will be located in the same cache line or virtual <b>memory</b> <b>page.</b> This can significantly speed up access to these objects through these references.|$|E
50|$|A page, <b>memory</b> <b>page,</b> or virtual page is a fixed-length {{contiguous}} {{block of}} virtual memory, {{described by a}} single entry in the page table. It is the smallest unit of data for memory management in a virtual memory operating system. Similarly, a page frame is the smallest fixed-length contiguous block of physical memory into which memory pages are mapped by the operating system.|$|E

30|$|In {{order to}} {{overcome}} the overhead of extra <b>memory</b> <b>pages</b> transfer in each iteration of precopy method, designing of such an algorithm is essential which can optimize the migration method at each iteration. This paper proposes a method, named as TPO, which minimizes number of <b>memory</b> <b>pages</b> to be transferred in each iteration of the migration method.|$|R

50|$|Page {{overflows}} {{occur when}} inserting an element into a K-D-B-tree {{results in the}} size of a node exceeding its optimal size. Since the purpose of the K-D-B-tree is to optimize external memory accesses like those from a hard-disk, a page is considered to have overflowed or be overfilled if the size of the node exceeds the external <b>memory</b> <b>page</b> size.|$|E
50|$|The endianness of the 32-bit SPARC V8 {{architecture}} is purely big-endian. The 64-bit SPARC V9 architecture uses big-endian instructions, but can access data in either big-endian or little-endian byte order, chosen {{either at the}} application instruction (load/store) level or at the <b>memory</b> <b>page</b> level (via an MMU setting). The latter is often used for accessing data from inherently little-endian devices, such as those on PCI buses.|$|E
5000|$|The PaX {{implementation}} {{does not}} allow a <b>memory</b> <b>page</b> to have permissions PROT_WRITE and PROT_EXEC both enabled when mprotect (...) restrictions are enabled for the task; any call to mprotect (...) to set both (PROT_WRITE | PROT_EXEC) {{at the same time}} will fail due to EACCESS (Permission Denied). This guarantees that pages will not become both writable and executable, and thus fertile ground for simple code injection attacks.|$|E
50|$|In computing, kernel same-page merging (abbreviated as KSM, {{and also}} known as kernel shared memory and memory merging) is a kernel feature that makes it {{possible}} for a hypervisor system to share identical <b>memory</b> <b>pages</b> amongst different processes or virtualized guests. While not directly linked, Kernel-based Virtual Machine (KVM) can use KSM to merge <b>memory</b> <b>pages</b> occupied by virtual machines.|$|R

50|$|A RISC {{instruction}} set normally has a fixed instruction width (often 4 bytes = 32 bits), whereas a typical CISC {{instruction set}} may have instructions of widely varying length (1 to 15 bytes for x86). Fixed-width instructions are less complicated to handle than variable-width instructions {{for several reasons}} (not having to check whether an instruction straddles a cache line or virtual <b>memory</b> <b>page</b> boundary for instance), and are therefore somewhat easier to optimize for speed.|$|E
50|$|Certain {{efficiencies}} were {{gained by}} careful design, for example, the <b>memory</b> <b>page</b> size, network packet, and disk sector were all 1K byte in size. With this arrangement a page fault {{could take place}} across the network {{as well as on}} the individual computer and Aegis file system was a single system of memory mapped files across the entire network. The name space of the network was self discovering as new nodes (workstations) were added.|$|E
