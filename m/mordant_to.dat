50|$|The term {{may also}} be applied to dyeing {{without the use of}} <b>mordants</b> <b>to</b> fix the dye once it is applied. Mordants were often {{required}} to alter the hue and intensity of natural dyes and improve color fastness. Chromium salts were until recently extensively used in dyeing wool with synthetic mordant dyes. These were used for economical high color fastness dark shades such as black and navy. Environmental concerns have now restricted their use, and they have been replaced with reactive and metal complex dyes that do not require mordant.|$|R

50|$|A dye is {{a colored}} {{substance}} {{that has an}} affinity to some substrate. The dye is applied in an aqueous solution, and needs a <b>mordant</b> <b>to</b> stimulate the fixation of the dye on the textile filament.

50|$|Oldenlandia umbellata (called chay root or choy root, {{from its}} Tamil name, chaaya ver) is a low-growing plant native to India. A {{colour-fast}} red dye can be {{extracted from the}} root bark of (preferably) a two-year-old plant. Chay root dye was once used with a <b>mordant</b> <b>to</b> impart a red colour to fabrics such as calico, wool, and silk.|$|E
5000|$|Dye {{results can}} also {{rely on the}} mordant chosen as the {{introduction}} of the mordant into the dye will have a marked effect on the final color. Each dye can have different reactions to each mordant. For example, cochineal scarlet, or Dutch scarlet as it came to be known, used cochineal along with a tin <b>mordant</b> <b>to</b> create a brilliant orange-hued red.|$|E
30|$|In contrast, {{aluminum}} and tin salts formed weak coordination complexes with the dyes. This tends to form quite strong bonds with the dye molecule {{but not with}} the fiber (Cotton and Wilkinson 1972). Thus, they block the dye and reduce its interaction with the fiber. This is the reason behind the lower K/S values in the case of {{aluminum and}} tin salts than those obtained from ferrous sulfate. Moreover, CT as an assistant increased the color yield from 11.16 to 13.19 when used with tin. CT is chemically potassium hydrogen tartrate which can be used in addition <b>to</b> dyes and <b>mordants</b> <b>to</b> change the pH in order to change colors and to help the absorption of the mordant metal (Mortazavi et al. 2012).|$|R
50|$|These stains are {{commonly}} employed for histological studies. The <b>mordants</b> used <b>to</b> demonstrate nuclear and cytoplasmic structures are alum and iron, forming lakes or coloured complexes (dye-mordant-tissue complexes), the colour {{of which will}} depend on the salt used. Aluminium salt lakes are usually coloured blue-white, whereas ferric salt lakes are coloured blue-black.|$|R
5000|$|Archaeologists {{have found}} {{evidence}} of textile dyeing {{dating back to the}} Neolithic period.

Textile fibre may be dyed before spinning ("dyed in the wool"), but most textiles are [...] "yarn-dyed" [...] or [...] "piece-dyed" [...] after weaving. Many natural dyes require the use of chemicals called <b>mordants</b> <b>to</b> bind the dye to the textile fibres; tannin from oak galls, salt, natural alum, vinegar, and ammonia from stale urine were used by early dyers. Many mordants, and some dyes themselves, produce strong odors, and large-scale dyeworks were often isolated in their own districts.|$|R

2500|$|The three negatives {{were then}} printed to gelatin matrices, which also {{completely}} bleached the image, washing out the silver and {{leaving only the}} gelatin record of the image. A receiver print, consisting of a 50% density print of the black-and-white negative for the green record strip, and including the soundtrack, was struck and treated with dye <b>mordants</b> <b>to</b> aid in the imbibition process (this [...] "black" [...] layer was discontinued in the early 1940s). The matrices for each strip were coated with their complementary dye (yellow, cyan, or magenta), and then each successively brought into high-pressure contact with the receiver, which imbibed and held the dyes, which collectively rendered a wider spectrum of color than previous technologies. The first animation film with the three-color (also called three-strip) system was Walt Disney's Flowers and Trees (1932), the first short live-action film was La Cucaracha (1934), and the first feature was Becky Sharp (1935).|$|R

50|$|Like etching, {{aquatint}} {{uses the}} application of a <b>mordant</b> <b>to</b> etch into the metal plate. Where the engraving technique uses a needle to make lines that print in black (or whatever colour ink is used), aquatint uses powdered rosin to create a tonal effect. The rosin is acid resistant and typically adhered to the plate by controlled heating. The tonal variation is controlled by the level of mordant exposure over large areas, and thus the image is shaped by large sections at a time.|$|E
50|$|Etching is {{the process}} of using strong acid or <b>mordant</b> <b>to</b> cut into the {{unprotected}} parts of a metal surface to create a design in intaglio in the metal. This technique {{is believed to have been}} invented by Daniel Hopfer (c. 1470-1536) of Augsburg, Germany, who decorated armour in this way, and applied the method to printmaking. Etching soon came to challenge engraving as the most popular printmaking medium. Its great advantage was that, unlike engraving which requires special skill in metalworking, etching is relatively easy to learn for an artist trained in drawing.|$|E

40|$|Pigments {{that are}} {{currently}} available in the market usually come from synthetic sources, or, if natural, often need <b>mordants</b> <b>to</b> bind to the target substrate. Recent research on the fungal pigment extracts from Scytalidium cuboideum, Scytalidium ganodermophthorum, Chlorociboria aeruginosa, and Chlorociboria aeruginascens {{have been shown to}} successfully dye materials, like wood, bamboo, and textiles, however, there is no information about their binding mechanisms. Due to this, a microscopic study was performed to provide information to future manufacturers interested in these pigments. The results of this study show that S. ganodermophthorum and C. aeruginosa form an amorphous layer on substrates, while S. cuboideum forms crystal-like structures. The attachment and morphology indicate that there might be different chemical and physical interactions between the extracted pigments and the materials. This possibility can explain the high resistance of the pigments to UV light and color fastness that makes them competitive against synthetic pigments. These properties make these pigments a viable option for an industry that demands natural pigments with the properties of the synthetic ones...|$|R
5000|$|The three negatives {{were printed}} to gelatin matrix films, which were {{processed}} with a selectively hardening developer, treated {{to remove the}} silver, and hot-washed to leave only a gelatin relief of the images. A receiver print, consisting of a 50% density silver print of the black-and-white negative for the green component, and including the soundtrack and frame lines, was made and treated with dye <b>mordants</b> <b>to</b> aid in the imbibition process (the inclusion of a [...] "black" [...] image was discontinued in the early 1940s). The matrix for each color was soaked in its complementary dye (yellow, cyan, or magenta), then each in succession was brought into high-pressure contact with the receiver, which imbibed and held the dyes, thus reproducing a nearly complete spectrum of color, unlike previous two-color processes. The first animation film to use the three-color (also called three-strip) system was Walt Disney's Flowers and Trees (1932), which introduced it to an enthusiastic public.

50|$|Etching is {{traditionally}} {{the process of}} using strong acid or <b>mordant</b> <b>to</b> cut into the unprotected parts of a metal surface to create a design in intaglio (incised) in the metal. In modern manufacturing, other chemicals may be used on other types of material. As a method of printmaking, it is, along with engraving, the most important technique for old master prints, and remains in wide use today. In a number of modern variants such as microfabrication etching and photochemical milling it is a crucial technique in much modern technology, including circuit boards.|$|E
50|$|As {{the history}} goes, Reichenbach applied {{creosote}} {{to the wooden}} posts of his home, in order to drive away dogs who urinated on them. The strategy was ineffectual, however, and {{he noted that the}} dog's urine reacted with creosote to form an intense dark blue deposit. He named the new substance píttacal (from Greek words tar and beautiful). He later was able to produce pure pittacal by treating beechwood tar with barium oxide and using alumina as a <b>mordant</b> <b>to</b> the dye's fabrics. Although sold commercially as a dyestuff, it did not fare well.|$|E
5000|$|Just {{north of}} the village {{are some of the}} highest cliffs in England, at 203 m above sea level. Boulby Cliff was mined for alum and in A Picturesque History of Yorkshire (1901) the face of the {{headland}} is described as being [...] "dotted" [...] with alum-works and miners cottages. This mineral was used as a <b>mordant</b> <b>to</b> improve the strength and permanency of colour when dyeing cloth. This mining was relatively short lived as a cheaper method was developed soon after the boom in alum mining. The ruined remnants of the mines can still be seen from the cliff top when walking the Cleveland Way between Staithes and Skinningrove. To the north-west of the village is Boulby Quarries a Site of Special Scientific Interest designated due to its geological interest.|$|E

500|$|Natural alum (aluminum sulfate) is {{the most}} common {{metallic}} salt mordant, but tin (stannous chloride), copper (cupric sulfate), iron (ferrous sulfate, called copperas) and chrome (potassium dichromate) are also used. [...] Iron mordants [...] "sadden" [...] colors, while tin and chrome mordants brighten colors. [...] The iron <b>mordants</b> contribute <b>to</b> fabric deterioration, referred to as [...] "dye rot". Additional chemicals or alterants may be applied after dying to further alter or reinforce the colors.|$|R
30|$|Different {{types of}} {{metallic}} salts {{were used to}} minimize those problems mostly. Aluminum potassium sulfate, stannous chloride, ferrous sulfate and copper sulfate are commonly used mordants. The metal ions can act as electron donor to form coordination bonds with the dye molecules. <b>Mordants</b> assist <b>to</b> form the chemical bridge between dye and fiber molecules. Thus, improves the dye molecule permanency onto fabric surface, i.e. color fastness properties of natural dye (Vankar 2000).|$|R
