5|$|On 28 January 1908, a fire {{broke out}} in Little Mill, caused by some machinery. The fire lasted for about 12 hours and caused an {{estimated}} £20,000 damage and resulted in 200 employees at the mill losing their jobs. Whilst fighting the fire a fireman was killed when a fire-tender blew over in high winds. The building {{was replaced by a}} new building, New Little Mill, five storeys high, four shorter than its predecessor but occupying a larger area of ground. The new mill had concrete floors and was designed to use <b>mains</b> <b>electricity.</b> The building is the earliest mill in Greater Manchester that was built to use <b>mains</b> <b>electricity.</b>|$|E
5|$|On 28 March 1961 {{the light}} was electrified, with <b>mains</b> <b>electricity</b> as the power source, and an {{intensity}} of 1,000,000cd. The drive was replaced with a 0.3 amp electric motor. At {{the same time the}} staff was cut from three lightkeepers to two.|$|E
5|$|The Sinclair Scientific Programmable was {{introduced}} in 1975, with the same case as the Sinclair Oxford. It was larger than the Scientific, at , and used a larger PP3 battery, but could also be powered by <b>mains</b> <b>electricity.</b>|$|E

50|$|The term band rejection, {{when used}} in {{electronic}} signal processing, refers to the deliberate removal of a known frequency range - for instance, to compensate for a known source of interference (such as noise from <b>mains</b> (household) <b>electricity).</b> A specific frequency is removed using a notch filter.|$|R
50|$|However, {{over the}} years the {{properties}} have been improved, the utility companies subsequently laid on <b>mains</b> drainage, <b>electricity</b> and telephones and the community took on a more permanent feel. Today about half the dwellings are occupied all year round and many of the more temporary structures have been rebuilt as conventional bungalows.|$|R
5|$|All {{houses were}} built with marble-mantelpieced {{fireplaces}} and flues. All houses were supplied with running water supplied from the New River, which flowed through nearby Wood Green. However, not all houses were supplied with gas or <b>mains</b> <b>electricity</b> from the outset, the remainder being lit by candles or oil or paraffin lamps.|$|E
5|$|During the Second World War, gun {{batteries}} {{were built}} on the island. A twin six pounder emplacement at Galtness Battery on the coast at Salt Ness protected the Wide Firth from German torpedo boats. A Castle Battery was operational from 1941–43, as was an anti-aircraft battery. <b>Mains</b> <b>electricity</b> arrived on Shapinsay in the 1970s, when an underwater cable was laid from Kirkwall.|$|E
5|$|<b>Mains</b> <b>electricity</b> was {{introduced}} to Ambrosden in 1935. The Bicester Military Railway between Bicester and Piddington was built through Ambrosden in 1941 and remains in use to this day. In 1951–52 the Ministry of Defence and the Central Ordnance Depot had a new housing estate of some 200 houses built in the village. The Government bought a significant area of land {{from most of the}} farms in the parish. There are three types of house, all designed by the architect R. Potter of Salisbury, all built of brick and roofed with tiles, and many sited around a green.|$|E
50|$|East Dundry Lane in the 1920s was {{the first}} to be tarred into the hamlet. Bristol, with its centre only 6 {{kilometres}} away, had <b>mains</b> water, <b>electricity,</b> gas, dial telephones and mains drainage by the 1930s - but the Second World War and its ten years of ensuing austerity stopped all extension of these facilities to places such as East Dundry.|$|R
50|$|The {{power supply}} unit (PSU) {{converts}} general-purpose <b>mains</b> AC <b>electricity</b> to direct current (DC) for the other components of the computer. The rated output capacity of a PSU should usually be about 40% greater than the calculated system power consumption needs obtained by adding up all the system components. This protects against overloading the supply, and guards against performance degradation.|$|R
50|$|The {{town has}} good {{internal}} architecture such as cement roads, <b>mains</b> water and <b>electricity,</b> mobile communications towers, and a main Post Office. There is a recreation area with nearly 200 trees.|$|R
5|$|A water-powered mill in {{the castle}} grounds was {{probably}} built under Henry de Beaumont, 1stEarl of Warwick. By 1398 the mill had been relocated to just outside the eastern castle walls, {{on the west bank}} of the River Avon. Both mills were subject to flooding. By 1644, an engine house had been added to the mill. The mill was reused as an electricity generating plant after it had stopped being used to grind, but once Warwick Castle was fitted with <b>mains</b> <b>electricity</b> in 1940, the mill was no longer required and was dismantled in 1954. Adjacent to the mill is The Mill Garden which is privately owned but open to the public. Interesting views of the castle can be seen from this garden.|$|E
5|$|As Lennon hated doing {{a second}} take to double his vocals, Ken Townsend, the studio's {{technical}} manager, developed an alternative form of double-tracking called artificial double tracking (ADT) system, taking the {{signal from the}} sync head of one tape machine and delaying it slightly through a second tape machine. The two tape machines used were not driven by <b>mains</b> <b>electricity,</b> but from a separate generator which put out a particular frequency, the same for both, thereby keeping them locked together. By altering the speed and frequencies, he could create various effects, which the Beatles used throughout the recording of Revolver. Lennon's vocal is double-tracked on the first three verses of the song: {{the effect of the}} Leslie cabinet can be heard after the (backwards) guitar solo.|$|E
5|$|In the 1898, A Murray {{became part}} of the Fine Cotton Spinners' and Doublers' Association Limited (FCSDA). The mill complex began to decline in the early 20th century as the canal basin was filled in and Little Mill burnt down. The mill was {{replaced}} with the earliest mill in Greater Manchester that was built to use <b>mains</b> <b>electricity.</b> The mill complex continued producing cotton until the 1950s. The mills were later leased out to other companies and in some cases allowed to fall into disrepair. Between 2000 and 2003, Urban Splash redeveloped Fireproof and Doubling Mill into offices, winning a RIBA Award. The rest of the complex underwent a £17M regeneration between 2004 and 2006 and are proposed to be used as flats and a hotel.|$|E
50|$|From the 1970s, {{with the}} {{population}} increase, the settlement became more modernized and 70% of all properties had <b>mains</b> water and <b>electricity.</b> During {{this time the}} telephone network was also introduced to the area.|$|R
50|$|Cordless scanner (or Wireless scanner): a {{cordless}} {{barcode scanner}} is {{operated by a}} battery fit inside it and is not connected to the <b>electricity</b> <b>mains</b> and transfer data to the connected device like PC.|$|R
50|$|The council {{initiated}} the scheme, with origins evident in {{minutes of the}} 16 December 2002 meeting of the council's Caithness committee. It was planned, originally, as a biomass-fuelled {{combined heat and power}} scheme, producing <b>mains</b> grid <b>electricity</b> as well as heat. The CHaP company was formed on 7 July 2005, as a non-profit company with three directors, representing the council, the Pulteneytown People’s Project charity, and the distillery owners.|$|R
5|$|The first {{community}} hall at Meander {{was built}} in 1914. It was built by local resident Fred Bowman, who maintained it until 1945 when responsibility {{was taken over by}} a local committee. Locals decided, in 1952, to build a new hall. Funding from the hall came from, competitions, dances and the growing of peas for sale. The hall opened 3 December 1954 and was physically joined to the original c.1957. The Road from Deloraine to Meander was sealed in 1964, an event of some note that was celebrated with a gymkhana and fair. <b>Mains</b> <b>electricity</b> reached Meander in 1952 when power, supplied by the Hydro-Electric Commission, was switched on in Meander's township area December 1952. Meander's street lights were first turned on 12 November 1971.|$|E
5|$|Crofting is the {{mainstay}} of island life. Sheep form {{the backbone of the}} agricultural economy but a diversity livestock are kept, including cattle, pigs, goats, chickens, ducks and geese. Vegetable are grown too, often in the shelter of circular walls, such plots being known as 'plantie scrubs'. Fishing is still conducted but on a relatively small scale. There is a post office at the pier, but no shop. <b>Mains</b> <b>electricity</b> only came to the island {{at the close of the}} twentieth century. The Papa Stour Project is a Christian supported housing service offering accommodation to men with drug and alcohol issues. Ferries now sail across the Sound of Papa to West Burrafirth on the Shetland Mainland. The crossing takes 45 minutes, and although the Snolda carries cars, there is only one short road on the island. For visiting yachts the four main voes provide good shelter, but the strong tides in both the Sound of Papa and to the north west require considerable care.|$|E
25|$|In a <b>mains</b> <b>electricity</b> (AC power) wiring installation, {{the term}} ground {{conductor}} typically refers to three different conductors or conductor systems as listed below.|$|E
50|$|Modern chattel houses {{tend to have}} {{a greater}} degree of permanence, as they are often {{connected}} to the <b>electricity</b> <b>mains,</b> and may either have a permanent septic tank or be connected to a public sewer system.|$|R
5000|$|Street {{lighting}} {{was introduced}} in the 1920s, and paraffin was used as there was no <b>mains</b> gas or <b>electricity.</b> Portgordon {{was one of the last}} communities to get electricity in 1937, and the village was nicknamed [...] "Paraffin City".|$|R
40|$|An {{investigation}} into the impacts of There is {{evidence to suggest that}} access to electricity is one of the factors linked to an improved quality of life in developing countries. There is however, limited information on the effect of the type of electricity supply. This study compares the impacts of two types of electricity systems used for rural electrification projects namely photovoltaic and <b>mains</b> grid <b>electricity.</b> Survey work was carried out by means of one-to-one interviews with households in four remote villages in Ghana using a specifically designed questionnaire. The villages supplied by the photovoltaic systems showed evidence of technical problems, payment and supply chain difficulties. In mains grid electrified villages there was evidence of increased appliance ownership, decreased dependency on kerosene fuel and the beginnings of small income generating activities depending on reliability of the supply. Daily routines showed no significant changes and there had been no bill payments in the first six months. The report contributes to the already substantial amount of information on photovoltaic projects as well as providing an insight for future rural electrification projects utilising <b>mains</b> grid <b>electricity.</b> ii Abbreviations and key word...|$|R
25|$|The {{structure}} {{was good and}} it successfully converted to ring spinning in 1920- {{and was the first}} mill to adopt <b>mains</b> <b>electricity</b> as its principal source of power. The mill {{structure was}} classified as a Grade II listed building in June 1994.|$|E
25|$|In 1912 the {{apparatus}} was {{converted to a}} vaporised kerosene mantle, to lower costs. In 1933 the light returned to use electricity, as the tower was connected to <b>mains</b> <b>electricity.</b> The current first order bivalve Fresnel lens was installed at that time.|$|E
25|$|A {{breast pump}} is a {{mechanical}} device that extracts milk from the breasts of a lactating woman. Breast pumps may be manual devices powered by hand or foot movements or electrical devices powered by <b>mains</b> <b>electricity</b> or batteries. The first breast pump was patented by O.H. Needham on June 20, 1854.|$|E
50|$|There {{are many}} causes of power {{failures}} in an electricity network. Examples of these causes include faults at power stations, damage to electric transmission lines, substations or {{other parts of}} the distribution system, a short circuit, or the overloading of <b>electricity</b> <b>mains.</b>|$|R
50|$|The post-war house {{building}} programme put gas at a disadvantage. Whereas electricity had long developed a national distribution grid, which enabled supplies to reach even small new housing developments, gas was still distributed only locally. Many new housing estates were {{beyond the reach}} of the gas main and the stringent Treasury rules about return on investment made extension of <b>mains</b> uneconomic. <b>Electricity</b> made inroads into the home heating market with underfloor heating and night storage heaters using cheap off-peak electricity supplies.|$|R
50|$|Cape Martin Lighthouse is a {{lighthouse}} located on Cape Martin near Beachport {{at the north}} end of Rivoli Bay in South Australia. It was first lit in 1960. It replaced the Penguin Island Lighthouse whose light apparatus was reused in the new tower. The lighthouse was converted to <b>mains</b> power <b>electricity</b> in 1974. The original tower had a height of 4.5 m. However, the gradual build up of sand dunes obscured the light. This problem was rectified in 1980 when the tower was raised to a height of 12 m.|$|R
25|$|There are {{two basic}} {{standards}} for voltage and frequency in the world. One is the European standard of 220–240 volts at 50Hz, {{and the other is}} the North American standard of 120 volts at a frequency of 60 Hz. The differences arose for historical reasons as discussed in the article <b>Mains</b> <b>electricity.</b>|$|E
25|$|Power {{sources of}} calculators are: batteries, solar cells or <b>mains</b> <b>electricity</b> (for old models), turning {{on with a}} switch or button. Some models even have no {{turn-off}} button but they provide some way to put off (for example, leaving no operation for a moment, covering solar cell exposure, or closing their lid). Crank-powered calculators were also common in the early computer era.|$|E
25|$|A parish {{hall was}} built in 1909 by local subscription, and served as an {{auxiliary}} military hospital for twenty convalescents during the First World War. <b>Mains</b> <b>electricity</b> arrived {{in the area in}} 1932. Acton village suffered bombing during the Second World War, particularly during one night in late 1940; there were no fatalities. Refugees, mainly from Liverpool, were housed in Acton, and Dorfold Park was used as a camp for American soldiers from November 1940.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{shows the}} {{possibility}} of electromagnetic compatibility problems when using different equipment and justifies the necessity of usage of power factor correctors to reduce the negative impact on <b>mains</b> by <b>electricity</b> consumers. The basic methods of correcting the power factor are considered. Comparison of the methods of control for high-frequency power factor correction devices is carried out, for each method the functional electrical scheme is shown. The advantages of digital control systems over analog are specified. The forecast of a possible future transition to digital power factor correction systems is made. ? ?????? ?????? ???????? ??????????? ????????????? ??????? ???????????????? ????????????? ??? ?????? ?????????? ???????????? ? ?????????? ????????????? ????????????? ??????????? ???????????? ???????? ??? ?????????? ??????????? ??????? ???????????? ?????????????? ?? ???????? ????. ??????????? ???????? ?????? ????????? ???????????? ????????. ????????? ????????? ??????? ?????????? ???????????????? ???????????? ????????? ???????????? ????????, ??? ??????? ?????? ????????? ?????????????? ????????????? ?????. ??????? ???????????? ???????? ?????? ?????????? ??? ???????????. ?????? ??????? ? ????????? ? ??????? ???????? ? ???????? ???????? ????????? ???????????? ????????...|$|R
