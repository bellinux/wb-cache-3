However, after a long tour, some of the acoustic songs started growing on him, which led to changes. Adams would record for a few hours, until he wheeled the whole recording kit back onstage. [...] "It <b>makes</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> little more interested in going on tour," [...] he said in retrospect. Adams who was never fully committed to the idea of creating a full-fledged acoustic album, decided not to after seeing an acoustic band opening for him during one of his concerts. What he saw made him certain that {{he was not able to}} create such an album.|$|E

500|$|... "Into the Groove" [...] {{was written}} and {{produced}} by Madonna and her then-boyfriend Stephen Bray. The singer had initially written the song for her friend Mark Kamins' protégée, Chyne, and recorded a demo which Kamins intended to modify later. However, Madonna {{believed that the}} song would be more suitable for her film Desperately Seeking Susan, and recorded it with Bray for the film's soundtrack. When Kamins {{found out he was}} furious that Madonna did not inform him that she would use the song for the film. The singer retorted: [...] "I'm tough, I'm ambitious and I know exactly what I want. If that <b>makes</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> bitch, that's okay." [...] "Into the Groove" [...] ultimately did not appear on the soundtrack album of the film, but was released on the 1985 worldwide re-issue of Madonna's second studio album, Like a Virgin. During an interview with Time, Madonna said that she wrote the song while watching a Latin boy across her balcony. Describing the song as [...] "dorky", Madonna further explained: ...|$|E

500|$|The lyrical themes on Dig Me Out {{deal with}} issues of heartbreak and survival. The song [...] "One More Hour" [...] is about the breakup of Tucker and Brownstein's romantic relationship. Before {{the release of the}} album, Spin {{published}} a controversial article discussing Tucker and Brownstein's personal relationship without their permission. Brownstein felt that [...] "it was a complete invasion of privacy. My parents didn't know Corin and I were going out. They didn't know I had ever dated a woman before. It was horrible. I was pissed at Spin, really mad. Luckily my parents are great people, but God forbid I would have some family that would disown me over something like that. And I would have totally held Spin responsible for that." [...] The song features a lot of vocal interplay by Tucker and Brownstein. Chris Nelson of Addicted to Noise noted that [...] "one can almost hear Tucker crying in the studio as she wails, 'I needed it', while behind her Brownstein offers her attempts at consolation". In her 2015 memoir Hunger <b>Makes</b> <b>Me</b> <b>A</b> Modern Girl, Brownstein also states that almost all the songs on Dig Me Out are about either her or Tucker's future husband, Lance Bangs.|$|E

2500|$|During production, {{there was}} {{criticism}} regarding the film's purported downplaying of Turing's homosexuality, particularly condemning {{the portrayal of}} his relationship with close friend and one-time fiancée Joan Clarke. Hodges, author of the book upon which the film was based, described the script as having [...] "built up the relationship with Joan much more than it actually was". Turing's niece Payne thought that Knightley was inappropriately cast, as she described the real Clarke as [...] "rather plain", and said: [...] "I think they might be trying to romanticise it.

[...] Jones also {{went out of his way}} to promote younger country singers that he felt were as passionate about the music as he was. [...] "Everybody knows he's a great singer," [...] Alan Jackson stated in 1995, [...] "but what I like most about George is that when you meet him, he is like some old guy that works down at the gas station...even though he's a legend!" ...|$|E

2500|$|Keynesian {{economic}} theory has {{played an important}} role in the economic philosophy of modern American liberals. Modern American liberals generally believe that national prosperity requires government management of the macroeconomy, in order to keep unemployment low, inflation in check, and growth high. They also value institutions that defend against economic inequality. In The Conscience of a Liberal Paul Krugman writes: [...] "I believe in a relatively equal society, supported by institutions that limit extremes of wealth and poverty. I believe in democracy, civil liberties, and the rule of law. That <b>makes</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> liberal, and I'm proud of it." [...] Liberals often point to the widespread prosperity enjoyed under a mixed economy in the years since World WarII. They believe liberty exists when access to necessities like health care and economic opportunity are available to all, and they champion the protection of the environment.|$|E
2500|$|Reiss {{has contributed}} to {{numerous}} film screenplays. He wrote several jokes for the film Ice Age after The Simpsons colleague David Silverman asked him and Jon Vitti to help out with the film's story issues. He later wrote a number of screenplays including [...] and Horton Hears a Who!. The first live-action film he wrote was 2009's My Life in Ruins, starring Nia Vardalos. Reiss initially wrote the film, {{which was based on}} his experience on holiday bus tours of Mexico and Greece, as a short story. After it was rejected by 37 publishers he rewrote it as a screenplay and sent it to Vardalos who [...] "snatched it right up". The film garnered a negative critical response with Roger Ebert, for example, stating [...] "there is, in short, nothing I liked about My Life in Ruins, except some of the ruins" [...] and calling Reiss' script [...] "lousy". Reiss defended the film: [...] "My Life in Ruins really makes people happy. It's a relentlessly sweet movie about the basic decency of humanity. It's happy ending kicks in around the 30-minute mark and continues for the next hour. I know those [...] were sitting there in that audience.
