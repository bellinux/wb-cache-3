30|$|In {{addition}} to fabric construction, fiber type is also {{critical to the}} attributes of barrier materials. Inherently fire resistant fibers (e.g., fiberglass, aramids, <b>melamines,</b> polybenzimidazole (PBI), novoloids, pre-oxidized polyacrylonitriles and carbon fibers) are char forming fibers with high mechanical strength ([Bourbigot & Flambard 2002]) {{that can be used}} for manufacturing barrier fabrics. Fabrics constructed from these inherently flame retardant fibers are expensive, and they are frequently used in high-performance applications (e.g., aircraft seating, seating in other mass transport vehicles and public buildings). Fire barrier fabrics constructed of fiberglass are very effective at preventing an ignition source from reaching the PUF core, as the fiberglass is a high char-forming fabric with strong structural integrity (US Patent Application 20070161312 - Fiberglass fire barrier for mattresses. Filed on January 11 [2006]). Fiberglass fabrics (woven, knitted or non-woven) are often used as substrates for FR coating or laminating FR layers. The disadvantage associated with fiberglass flame barriers is poor durability (due to glass-to-glass abrasion) and lack of resiliency ([Dry et al. 2006]).|$|R

40|$|The {{desire to}} reduce the load on the {{ecosystem}} has in recent years driven flame retardant research toward halogen-free systems or at least toward combinations that permit a substantial reduction {{in the percentage of}} halogenated substances.

It focuses on a series of different N-alkoxy hindered amines (NOR), azoalkanes (AZO) of the general formula R'-N.

40|$|Dirt {{and grit}} are common {{contaminants}} in recovered wood waste that resist removal by mechanical screening. The persistence {{of dirt and}} grit in wood-waste derived feedstocks tends to cause significant problems for the high value end use markets. For example, the presence of dirt and grit in composite panel board feedstocks causes excessive equipment wear in the manufacturing plant {{as well as for}} the end users of panel board products. For the manufacturing plant, dirt and grit causes refiner plates in the size reduction equipment to wear down at a faster rate than normal. For the end-user, dirt and grit embedded in the panel board causes saw blades to dull more rapidly. Dirt and grit can also reduce the brightness of a panel board which may be a problem for end users who overlay the board with thin <b>melamines</b> or other coatings. Best Practice: This best practice recommends the use of chip washing equipment to remove persistent dirt and grit contaminants from recovered wood waste feedstocks for users of exceptionally clean supplies of wood waste. Mechanical screening for dirt and grit removal is adequate. Chip Washer. A chip washer operates by mixing wood waste feedstocks with water.

40|$|Within {{the scope}} of this thesis, a method for the quick and {{versatile}} functionalization of preformed liposomes was developed. Further investigations demonstrated the applicability of the obtained vesicular sensors in analytics. Chapter I briefly introduces the concept of functionalized vesicles and its use for analytical applications. In this context, some established assay formats for the quantification of receptor–target binding at vesicular membranes are highlighted. Chapter II deals with hydrogen bonding at phospholipid membranes. Those interactions were initially intended to be utilized for the non-covalent attachment of receptors at vesicles surfaces. Studies on basis of melamine–barbiturate pairs demonstrated that the supposed unique physico-chemical properties at the lipid–water interface are not sufficient to result in stable monovalent complexes. However, cooperative hydrogen bonding at vesicular membranes could be achieved by exploiting concentration-dependent phase separation processes in gel phase phospholipid bilayers. The resulting densely packed clusters of membrane-embedded amphiphilic <b>melamines</b> allowed multisite binding to complementary hexavalent thymidine oligonucleotides. Due to the observed inefficiency of hydrogen bonding at liposomal surfaces, the focus of research was shifted towards a covalent modification of phospholipid membranes by employing thiol-based click reactions. Chapters III and IV illustrate the development of that technique. Initial studies in view of utilizing a radical thiol–ene coupling are summarized in Chapter IV. This UV light-induced reaction would provide a possibility to temporally control the functionalization process. It was found that radical thiol–ene additions are not efficient in the micromolar concentration range in aqueous solution and thus, their applicability for the post-functionalization of vesicle surfaces is very limited. The nucleophilic version employing a thiol–maleimide system, however, turned out to fulfill the requirements for the intended strategy. Based on this, surface-reactive luminescent vesicles were prepared by self-assembly of phospholipids, amphiphilic maleimides and fluorophores in aqueous solution (Chapter III). Those preformed liposomes were functionalized with various thiolated receptor units such as a bis-Zn 2 +-cyclen derivative for the detection of phosphate moieties or a DNA aptamer for specific interactions with the antibiotic ampicillin. The obtained receptor-modified vesicles indicated the binding of the targets to their surface by changes of the fluorescence emission properties of the membrane co-embedded carboxyfluorescein dyes. The post-functionalization concept could also be used for molecular imprinting of vesicle surfaces. The template-guided patterning of receptors based on bis-Zn 2 +-cyclen resulted in fluorescent sensors suitable for the specific recognition of a bivalent peptide. In Chapter V, the versatile applicability of the post-functionalization strategy of vesicles is demonstrated by extension to a thrombin-binding aptamer as further recognition element. The resulting aptasensors signaled the high-affinity binding of the analyte to the liposome surface again by dynamic changes of the emission properties of membrane-embedded fluorescent reporter dyes. Here, the sensing of thrombin was achieved within its physiological concentration range. In conclusion, the presented functionalization method of preformed liposomes allows an easy, fast and inexpensive access to various supramolecular sensors. Due to the highly modular approach, a simple variation of the receptor–fluorophore combinations can be accomplished. An extension of that technique to recognition elements such as peptides, other oligonucleotides or complex macromolecules may be envisaged, which could facilitate the development of novel customized devices for bioanalytical applications...|$|R
