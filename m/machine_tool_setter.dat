40|$|The hazard of scrotal cancer from cutting oils {{was first}} {{recognized}} in the 1950 s, and led to various control measures including the introduction of solvent refined oils, use of splash guards, provision of protective clothing and washing facilities and education of workers to encourage early detection and treatment of tumours. To assess how effective these controls have been, we have analyzed occupational mortality from scrotal cancer in England and Wales during 1979 - 80 and 1982 - 90. Over this 11 -year period 85 deaths were attributed to the disease in men aged 20 - 74. This represents a reduction in mortality from the 1960 s. Significantly elevated proportional mortality ratios (PMRs) were found in press and <b>machine</b> <b>tool</b> <b>setters</b> (PMR 1, 678, five deaths), centre lathe turners (PMR 1, 099, three deaths) and <b>machine</b> <b>tool</b> operators (PMR 303, eight deaths), {{but all of the}} metal machinists who died of scrotal cancer had been born before 1930, and could have worked with cutting oils before controls were introduced. These findings are reassuring, but continued monitoring of scrotal cancer incidence and mortality is required...|$|R
40|$|This thesis mainly {{focuses on}} the study and {{application}} of the integration of Computer numerical control (CNC) machining and on-machine cutting tool measurement. According to the industry survey, in current aerospace industry, the usage of off-line <b>tool</b> <b>setters</b> {{is one of the}} most prevailing ways for cutting tools measurement. The following up manual tool data input is required so that the CNC machine will know the tool dimension and finish the assigned <b>machining</b> tasks. Off-line <b>tool</b> <b>setters</b> are often of high accuracy and the measurement results are reliable. However, due to its off-line characteristic, after the tool is used, its current dimension status cannot be known or updated. Thus the quality of the upcoming machined parts cannot be guaranteed. Moreover, the involvement of operatorsâ€™ manual data input in the traditional method inevitably introduces human error to machining from time to time. To improve the process of part machining and eventually achieve produced parts that are within tolerance, a new approach is proposed in this thesis on the integration of <b>machining</b> and on-line <b>tool</b> measurement. The idea is to perform tool measurement without unloading the tool from the CNC machine, and update the tool dimension data in the machine control before the tool is used to machine the part. The key to this approach is the employment of a laser <b>tool</b> <b>setter,</b> an optoelectronic device that has the ability to communicate with the CNC control. Analysis on kinematics of this new type of device is conducted and its method of communication with CNC machine control is described. Special software on CNC machine control level must be utilized to achieve the objective of on-machine measurement. Custom macros features of FANUC controls is used to suit the needs of parametric programming. The discussions on custom macros feature are carried out in this thesis. With the measurement method established, measurement uncertainty of the system will be discussed in depth. Considering the special attributes of the laser <b>tool</b> <b>setter,</b> the <b>tool</b> geometry and the machine control, an optimized measurement strategy is studied and proposed. Finally, experiments are carried out to verify the accuracy and repeatability of the measurement system. Application on rejecting out-of-tolerance tool being used in machining is also discussed. The result of applications shows the measurement system is suitable for industry use. ...|$|R

An active advisory committee stressed the importance of updating the district's <b>machine</b> <b>tool</b> curriculum to meet local manufacturing and technical college standards. To accomplish this goal, the researcher used an interview and survey to determine what <b>machine</b> <b>tools</b> are used in the Sheboygan area, what <b>machine</b> <b>tool</b> careers are readily available in theSheboygan area, what <b>machine</b> <b>tool</b> proficiencies are expected of entry level <b>machine</b> <b>tool</b> employees and technical college students, and what modifications must be made to the current <b>machine</b> <b>tool</b> curriculum to align the curriculum with {{the needs of the}} Sheboygan area manufacturers and post-secondary <b>machine</b> <b>tool</b> programs.
