50|$|The {{trapezoidal}} <b>metric</b> <b>thread</b> form {{is similar}} to the Acme thread form, except the thread angle is 30°. It is codified by DIN 103. Although <b>metric</b> screw <b>threads</b> are generally more prevalent worldwide than imperial threads, the Acme thread is very common worldwide, and may be more widely used than the trapezoidal <b>metric</b> <b>thread.</b> This is not surprising, as manufacturers today are usually capable of making whichever <b>threads</b> (<b>metric</b> or imperial) are best for any given application (based on customer expectations or tooling availability). It may be that the tooling for Acme threads has been so dominant (compared to trapezoidal metric) that customers tend to want Acme threads for power screws regardless of metric standards used elsewhere in the product.|$|R

5000|$|When {{threaded}} {{mounting bolts}} and wingnuts were first introduced, the standard mounting bolt thread was 1/4" [...] BSW, {{similar to a}} light camera case screw, but 6M and 8M <b>metric</b> <b>threads</b> are also now common. At first simple metal wingnuts were used, but specialised cymbal nuts were soon introduced.|$|E
50|$|These were {{standardized}} by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) in 1947. Although <b>metric</b> <b>threads</b> {{were mostly}} unified in 1898 by the International Congress for the standardization of screw threads, separate metric thread standards {{were used in}} France, Germany, and Japan, and the Swiss had a set of threads for watches.|$|E
50|$|They {{are held}} in place by screws, either UTS (now largely obsolete) or metric M3.5×0.6 threads. Early {{versions}} of the standard suggested that metric screws should be blackened to avoid confusion with the incompatible UTS threads. However, by the 1987 revision this was no longer considered necessary because of the prevalence of <b>metric</b> <b>threads.</b>|$|E

While <b>metric</b> screw <b>threads</b> are more prevalent worldwide than imperial threads for triangular thread forms, the imperially sized Acme threads predominate in the trapezoidal thread form. In some cases customers prefer Acme threads for power screws regardless of metric standards used elsewhere in the product.|$|R

50|$|In {{addition}} to coarse and fine threads, {{there is another}} division of extra fine, or “superfine” threads, with a very fine pitch thread. Superfine pitch <b>metric</b> <b>threads</b> are occasionally used in automotive components, such as suspension struts, and are commonly used in the aviation manufacturing industry. This is because extra fine threads are more resistant to coming loose from vibrations.|$|E
50|$|Other {{important}} {{differences between the}} Vortec 8100 and older Big Blocks include a changed firing order (1-8-7-2-6-5-4-3), a new 18-bolt head bolt pattern, longer connecting rods, different symmetrical intake ports, different oil pan rails {{and the use of}} <b>metric</b> <b>threads</b> throughout the engine. The fuel-injection system for the Vortec 8100 is nearly identical to that used on Gen III engines, right down to the fuel and spark tables in the ECU.|$|E
50|$|A {{threaded}} insert, {{also known}} as a threaded bushing, is a fastener element that is inserted into an object to add a threaded hole. They may be used to repair a stripped threaded hole, provide a durable threaded hole in a soft material, place a thread on a material too thin to accept it, mold or cast threads into a workpiece thereby eliminating a machining operation, or simplify changeover from unified to <b>metric</b> <b>threads</b> or vice versa.|$|E

5000|$|British Morris and MG engines from 1923 to 1955 {{were built}} using <b>metric</b> <b>threads</b> but with bolt heads and nuts {{dimensioned}} for Whitworth spanners and sockets. In 1919 Morris Motors {{took over the}} French Hotchkiss engine works which had moved to Coventry during the First World War. The Hotchkiss machine tools were of metric thread but metric spanners were not readily available in Britain at the time, so fasteners were made with metric thread but Whitworth heads.|$|E
5000|$|The design {{principles}} of ISO general-purpose metric screw threads ("M" [...] series threads) are defined in international standard ISO 68-1. Each thread {{is characterized by}} its major diameter, D (Dmaj in the diagram), and its pitch, P. ISO <b>metric</b> <b>threads</b> consist of a symmetric V-shaped thread. In {{the plane of the}} thread axis, the flanks of the V have an angle of 60° to each other. The thread depth is 0.614 × pitch. The outermost [...] and the innermost [...] of the height H of the V-shape are cut off from the profile.|$|E
5000|$|Whereas <b>metric</b> <b>threads</b> {{are usually}} defined by their pitch, that is, how much {{distance}} per thread, inch-based standards usually use the reverse logic, that is, how many threads occur per a given distance. Thus inch-based threads are {{defined in terms}} of threads per inch (TPI). Pitch and TPI describe the same underlying physical property—merely in different terms. When the inch is used as the unit of measurement for pitch, TPI is the reciprocal of pitch and vice versa. For example, a -20 thread has 20 TPI, which means that its pitch is [...] inch (0.050 in).|$|E

50|$|DK Bicycles {{introduced}} the Dual Drive hub {{back in the}} early 2000s which is a BMX Left/Right drive flip flop hub with the smaller sized metric (30 mm x 1 mm) BMX threads for 13T-15T freewheels, but also includes two threaded adapters, one left and one right, threaded inside to match the smaller <b>metric</b> <b>threads</b> and threaded on the outside with standard ISO threads. This allows the hub to use any size or combination of left and right drive freewheels available. Other companies like Wethepeople also made these dual-threaded metric hubs for a short time before cassette hubs enabled the use of much smaller rear cogs.|$|E
50|$|On {{manually}} controlled lathes, {{the thread}} pitches {{that can be}} cut are, in some ways, determined by the pitch of the lead-screw: A lathe with a metric lead-screw will readily cut <b>metric</b> <b>threads</b> (including BA), while one with an imperial lead-screw will readily cut imperial-unit-based threads such as BSW or UTS (UNF, UNC). This limitation is not insurmountable, because a 127-tooth gear, called a transposing gear, is used to translate between metric and inch thread pitches. However, this is optional equipment that many lathe owners do not own. It is also a larger change-wheel than the others, and on some lathes may be larger than the change-wheel mounting banjo is capable of mounting.|$|E
50|$|However, internationally, {{the metric}} system was eclipsing inch-based {{measurement}} units. In 1947, ISO was founded; and in 1960, the metric-based International System of Units (abbreviated SI from the French Système International) was created. With continental Europe {{and much of}} the rest of the world turning to SI and ISO metric screw thread, the UK gradually leaned in the same direction. The ISO metric screw thread is now the standard that has been adopted worldwide and is slowly displacing all former standards, including UTS. In the U.S., where UTS is still prevalent, over 40% of products contain at least some ISO metric screw threads. The UK has completely abandoned its commitment to UTS in favour of ISO <b>metric</b> <b>threads,</b> and Canada is in between. Globalization of industries produces market pressure in favor of phasing out minority standards. A good example is the automotive industry; U.S. auto parts factories long ago developed the ability to conform to the ISO standards, and today very few parts for new cars retain inch-based sizes, regardless of being made in the U.S.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThread milling offers {{interesting}} {{possibilities for}} machining {{internal or external}} threads. This machining technique uses a mill with a triangular profile for <b>metric</b> <b>threads</b> and a helical interpolation strategy. Thus, the uncut chip thickness {{can not be easily}} evaluated from a simplified approach. The present study deals with a model for calculating uncut chip thickness during internal thread milling. This step is needed to understand and model the cutting forces. The model developed uses the geometrical definitions of the mill, and takes into account the milling mode and the cutting conditions. The link with the interferences between the tool and the thread is also established and corroborates a previous study. A full analyticalformulation of the problem is proposed, and results from different milling settings are presented...|$|E

5000|$|During this era, in {{continental}} Europe, the British and American threadforms {{were well}} known, but also various <b>metric</b> <b>thread</b> standards were evolving, which usually employed 60° profiles. Some of these evolved into national or quasi-national standards. They were mostly unified in 1898 by the International Congress for the standardization of screw threads at Zurich, which defined {{the new international}} <b>metric</b> <b>thread</b> standards as having the same profile as the Sellers <b>thread,</b> but with <b>metric</b> sizes. Efforts {{were made in the}} early 20th century to convince the governments of the U.S., UK, and Canada to adopt these international thread standards and the metric system in general, but they were defeated with arguments that the capital cost of the necessary retooling would drive some firms from profit to loss and hamper the economy. (The mixed use of dueling inch and metric standards has since cost much, much more, but the bearing of these costs has been more distributed across national and global economies rather than being borne up front by particular governments or corporations, which helps explain the lobbying efforts.) ...|$|R
