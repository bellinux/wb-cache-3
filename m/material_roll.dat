A linear model is deduced from the nonlinear one around a working point for frequency domain analysis. Thus the effect of some mechanical accumulator parameter variations are analyzed.

40|$|Bimetallic rolls {{are widely}} used in steel rolling {{industries}} because of the excellent hardness, wear resistance and high temperature properties. Controlling the residual stress distribution is necessary since the compressive residual stress at the surface may improve fatigue life though the tensile residual stress at the center may reduce the strength. Therefore, {{it is necessary to}} measure the residual stress distribution from the surface to center correctly to ensure the roll quality. The disk method has been widely used in predicting the roll residual stress by measuring the stress of the thin sliced disk from the roll. In this study, therefore, the relation between the original roll residual stress and the sliced disk residual stress is investigated for the single <b>material</b> <b>roll</b> and bimetallic roll on the basis of thermo-elastic-plastic FEM analysis.

40|$|The {{effects of}} bimodal grain size {{distributions}} on the mechanical properties {{of a newly}} developed TRansformation-TWinning induced plasticity (TRIP/TWIP) steel were investigated. The microstructures with different levels of bimodal grain size distributions were achieved through rolling at 1000, 1100 and 1200 °C where the restoration processes (in particular recrystallization) could be occurred at different rates. The {{results indicated that the}} bimodal distribution parameter was increased by raising the rolling temperature and lowering the thickness reduction. In addition, the room temperature strength and ductility were higher for the <b>materials</b> <b>rolled</b> at higher temperatures, where the level of bimodal grain size distributions (bimodality) was greater. This was justified considering the higher possibility of strain induced transformation and twinning in coarser grains than that of finer ones; this in fact would dictate the material work hardening potential during subsequent tensile deformation. For the <b>material</b> <b>rolled</b> at 1000 °C, where the grain size distributions were more homogeneous and the level of bimodal distributions was low, the austenite to martensite transformation during tensile deformation at room temperature was the prevailing mechanism to induce the plasticity. In contrast, in the <b>materials</b> <b>rolled</b> at 1100 and 1200 °C the mechanical twinning came into action thereby a rapid hardening region was recognized in their work hardening behavior. These effects were correlated to the length of work hardening region (dictated by twinning), and the magnitude of hardening rate (controlled by transformation of austenite to a' martensite).
