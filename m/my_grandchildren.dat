[...] Her last words were: [...] "I miss my {{daughter}} [...] and <b>my</b> <b>grandchildren.</b> I can not embrace {{her for the}} last time. Brazil, beautiful land... To there I can not return". The streets of Porto were crowded with people gathered to witness her funeral procession. By request of her husband, Teresa Cristina's body was carried to the Church of São Vicente de Fora near Lisbon, where it was interred in the Braganza Pantheon. Her remains, along with PedroII's, were later repatriated to Brazil in 1921 with much fanfare and pomp. They were given a final resting place in the Cathedral of Petrópolis in 1939.|$|E
500|$|Civil disobedience as non-violent protest {{or civil}} {{resistance}} are also acts of conscience, but are designed {{by those who}} undertake them chiefly to change, by appealing to the majority and democratic processes, laws or government policies perceived to be incoherent with fundamental social virtues and principles (such as justice, equality or respect for intrinsic human dignity). Civil disobedience, in a properly functioning democracy, allows a minority who feel strongly that a law infringes their sense of justice (but have no capacity to obtain legislative amendments or {{a referendum on the}} issue) to make a potentially apathetic or uninformed majority take account of the intensity of opposing views. A notable example of civil resistance or satyagraha ("satya" [...] in sanskrit means [...] "truth and compassion", [...] "agraha" [...] means [...] "firmness of will") involved Mahatma Gandhi making salt in India when that act was prohibited by a British statute, in order to create moral pressure for law reform. Rosa Parks similarly acted on conscience in 1955 in Montgomery, Alabama refusing a legal order to give up her seat to make room for a white passenger; her action (and the similar earlier act of 15-year-old Claudette Colvin) leading to the Montgomery Bus Boycott. Rachel Corrie was a US citizen allegedly killed by a bulldozer operated by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) while involved in direct action (based on the non-violent principles of Martin Luther King and Mahatma Gandhi) to prevent demolition of the home of local Palestinian pharmacist Samir Nasrallah. Al Gore has argued [...] "If you're a young person looking at the future of this planet and looking at what is being done right now, and not done, I believe we have reached the stage where it is time for civil disobedience to prevent the construction of new coal plants that do not have carbon capture and sequestration." [...] In 2011, NASA climate scientist James E. Hansen, environmental leader Phil Radford and Professor Bill McKibben were arrested for opposing a tar sands oil pipeline and Canadian renewable energy professor Mark Jaccard was arrested for opposing mountain-top coal mining; in his book Storms of <b>my</b> <b>Grandchildren</b> Hansen calls for similar civil resistance on a global scale to help replace the 'business-as-usual' Kyoto Protocol cap and trade system, with a progressive carbon tax at emission source on the oil, gas and coal industries – revenue being paid as dividends to low carbon footprint families.|$|E

2500|$|Several antisemitic {{statements}} by Dönitz are known. When Sweden closed its international waters to Germany, he blamed this action on their fear and dependence on [...] "international Jewish capital".

2500|$|Coal Pollution Mitigation is {{a process}} whereby coal is {{chemically}} washed of minerals and impurities, sometimes gasified, burned and the resulting flue gases treated with steam, {{with the purpose of}} removing sulfur dioxide, and reburned so as to make the carbon dioxide in the flue gas economically recoverable, and storable underground (the latter of which is called [...] "carbon capture and storage"). The coal industry uses the term [...] "clean coal" [...] to describe technologies designed to enhance both the efficiency and the environmental acceptability of coal extraction, preparation and use, but has provided no specific quantitative limits on any emissions, particularly carbon dioxide. Whereas contaminants like sulfur or mercury can be removed from coal, carbon cannot be effectively removed while still leaving a usable fuel, and clean coal plants without carbon sequestration and storage do not significantly reduce carbon dioxide emissions. James Hansen in an open letter to U.S. President Barack Obama has advocated a [...] "moratorium and phase-out of coal plants that do not capture and store CO2". In his book Storms of <b>My</b> <b>Grandchildren,</b> similarly, Hansen discusses his Declaration of Stewardship the first principle of which requires [...] "a moratorium on coal-fired power plants that do not capture and sequester carbon dioxide".|$|E
2500|$|The Transformer {{brothers}} {{also knew}} where he was, but he didn't look and just held his pole steady. The brothers came and landed {{on the side of}} the canoe. They asked the man, [...] "What are you doing?" [...] He responded, [...] "Oh, you are <b>my</b> <b>grandchildren.</b> Oh this here, this is my food that I am going to feed you with." [...] He tells the three men, [...] "I have a house right here, right there in that little bay. You bring your canoe over and come up ashore." [...] He pulled up his pole and had a lot of the moss ready. In the house, he had a big fire ready and a mountain of rock underneath, already hot. He took some sticks and grabbed the hot rocks and put them in a bowl that was filled with water. When the rocks were dropped in, the water began to boil. He took the boiling water and placed the moss inside and then made soup. The tells the men to have a seat on his bench with his big hyu7kem plate. This was the first hyu7kem plate made because he knew these men were coming. It made this plate really fancy, and fed them with three Mountain Goat horn spoons. The three men ate the moss.|$|E
