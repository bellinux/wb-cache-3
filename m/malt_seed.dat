Dry viable bambara seed was stored for five days to malt. The proteins in the dry and <b>malted</b> <b>seed</b> were subsequently extracted in potassium phosphate buffer pH 7. 0 and precipitated with saturated ammonium sulphate. MudPit (multidimensional protein identification technology) and LC-MALDI TOF-TOF (liquid chromatography - matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization tandem time-of-flight) mass spectrometry were thereafter used {{to identify}} {{the different types of}} proteins. A total of ten and twelve different types of proteins present in other legume species were identified in the <b>malted</b> and dry <b>seeds</b> respectively from the 214 peptides isolated after searching 586 proteins of the genus Vigna. Seed storage protein B and vicilin were observed to be the major proteins common to both <b>malted</b> and dry <b>seeds</b> and are similar to Vigna luteola. Some of the other proteins observed showed amino acid sequence homology with Vigna radiata and Vigna unguiculata species.

Dairying has grown strongly in the surrounding areas with high world prices for milk products and the use of irrigation to lift grass growth on dry land. With its higher labour use this has helped stop declines in rural population. Many cropping and sheep farms have been converted to dairying.

40|$|Barley is a cool season grain crop {{used for}} feed, <b>malting</b> and <b>seed.</b> <b>Malting</b> barley {{has a higher}} {{economic}} value than barley grown for feed. Between 80 - 85 % of the barley grown in Colorado is grown in south-central Colorado, in the San Luis Valley. Cropping System Barley should be planted {{as soon as the}} frost is off the ground to permit crop development prior to aphid flights, and to avoid other insects and diseases. In the San Luis Valley, the last frost is usually in June and precipitation starts in April. Barley is planted in the fall from Sept. 1 to Oct. 15 and in the spring from Mar. 15 to Apr. 30. Optimal seed germination temperatures are 55 - 70 F. Barley requires a minimum soil temperature of 40 F, with optimal growth rates occurring at 70 F. Temperatures above 90 F impede barley growth. Barley is planted into a firm seed bed (for consistent drill depths) 0. 5 - 1. 5 " deep with 6 - 10 " row widths. Planting depth for cold, spring soils is 0. 5 - 0. 75 ".

The seeds were then allowed to finish germination in saturated air. It is shown that exposure of germinating barley to PEE affects radicle emergence without significantly affecting the seeds gross metabolic activity, as quantified by isothermal calorimetry. An exploration of protein 2 -DE profiles of both the embryo and the starchy endosperm showed that, at the studied time scale, no significant changes were found in proteins present at concentrations higher than the detection limit. However, western blotting demonstrated that a-amylase concentration decreases in the PEF-treated seeds. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|The {{transition}} from dormancy to germination {{is crucial for}} malt barley in the <b>malt</b> house. <b>Seed</b> dormancy is a quantitative trait and the depths of dormancy controlled by environment/genetics remain unclear. Quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis was conducted to evaluate the number, location and phenotypic variation explained by QTLs from data collected from different years, sites and germination conditions in the Stirling Ã— Harrington population. QTLs on 4 H, 5 H and 6 H could explain 25, 81 and 12 % of phenotypic variations, respectively. Consistent QTLs were detected on 5 HL and other QTLs were subjected to growth or germination conditions. Germination tests under light detected more QTLs than in the dark. The QTL at 5 HL were more important for seed dormancy under the Mediterranean environment and evidence showed at least two genes controlling seed dormancy at 5 HL...|$|R
40|$|Seed {{dormancy}} in barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) {{is one of}} {{the most}} important parameters affecting <b>malting.</b> <b>Seed</b> dormancy is quantitatively inherited and variously influenced by the environment. The objectives of the present study were to determine the genome location and effects of quantitative trait loci (QTLs) involved in the expression of seed dormancy in a barley cross between two varieties derived from different germplasm pools. Using a doubled-haploid population of 107 lines of the cross between the malting types Triumph (two-row, dormant) and Morex (six-row, non-dormant), seed dormancy phenotypic data sets from five environments and a 147 -marker linkage map were developed in order to perform QTL analyses with simple interval mapping and simplified composite interval mapping procedures. Two different types of variables were considered for seed dormancy characterization: (1) level of dormancy induced during seed development, which was indirectly measured as germination percentage at 3 days and 7 days, GP 3 and GP 7 respectively; (2) rate of dormancy release in the course of a period after seed harvest (after-ripening). Different mechanisms of genetic control were detected for these two types of dormancy-related traits. A major and consistent dormancy QTL near the centromere on chromosome 7 (5 H) was associated with the establishment of dormancy during seed development and accounted for 52 % and 33 % of the variability for GP 3 and GP 7, respectively. Two other QTLs located in the vicinity of the vrs 1 locus on chromosome 2 (2 H) and near the long arm telomere on chromosome 7 (5 H) explained 9 % and 19 % of variation, respectively, for the rate of dormancy release during after-ripening. Likewise, seed dormancy was assessed in an F 2 population derived from the cross between two dormant types of distinct germplasm groups, Triumph (European, two-row, malt) and Steptoe (North American, six-row, feed), which showed similar but not identical genetic control for dormancy. Interestingly, there is remarkable dormancy QTL conservation in both regions on chromosome 7 (5 H) identified in this study and among other barley mapping populations. These widely conserved QTLs show potential as targets for selection of a moderate level of seed dormancy in breeding programs. Peer Reviewe...|$|R

30|$|GPS, SRS, and GIS {{techniques}} may not capture some endogenous and exogenous {{shifts in}} the production process and LULC changes (Liniger et al. 2011). Several predictable shifts are also indicators of the dynamics in the smallholder farming system, which permit exploration of the spatial and temporal features of crop-livestock production. Some crop varieties and livestock breeds have shifted to market-demanded activities within the farming system. The evolved highland fruits such as apple and <b>malt</b> barley <b>seed</b> varieties are among the predominant shifts in cropping systems. Although fallowing and intercropping have declined, the uses of compost and Nitrogen-Phosphorus-Sulfur (NPS) fertilize 1 rs have increased over time to improve soil fertility and increase crop productivity. In terms of body size, households have replaced their large livestock with small animals (calves, chickens, sheep, and donkeys). The prevalence of animal diseases has dropped somewhat. Changes from open grazing to stall feeding are important shifts in livestock feeding systems. Industrial feed byproducts and improved forage trees have been introduced to farms and other landscapes. The reduction of springs and river flows has also caused considerable {{shifts in the}} farming systems. Erica arborea, Hagenia abyssinica, Rosa abyssinica, and Juniperus procera are threatened indigenous tree species. Kuria et al. (2014) reported over 20 extinct tree species {{in the study and}} neighboring areas.|$|R
30|$|Remote sensing {{along with}} {{household}} surveys is an innovative approach to assess farm system dynamics. LULC change, grain production pressure, and pressure on feed resources {{are the three}} major indicators that measure land conversion and food and feed balance. Conservation structures, woodlands, water resources, irrigation activities, afro-alpine reserves, access to road and local market, and recently introduced practicesâ€”such as highland fruits, <b>malt</b> barley <b>seeds,</b> tree lucerne seedlings, and improved animal breedsâ€”are important interventions to improve land productivity, economic gains, and food security. Increased numbers of endangered tree species, high grazing pressure, and intensive land conversions are, however, potential threats to enhance the management of improved land resources. Settlement and plantation have increased tremendously, {{in line with the}} increasing human population. The rising population is also causing a concomitant shrinkage in natural vegetation. If the underlying crop-livestock dynamics affecting the system remain unchanged, competition for land resources and environmental damage is certain to accelerate. This situation warrants further investment in sustainable land resource management and efficient institutional arrangements that can preserve the natural landscape and minimize the extent of crop-livestock competition. Promoting multipurpose forage and crop varieties could provide enough biomass {{to meet the needs of}} humans and livestock as well as enhance soil fertility. Increasing crop production alone will not be sufficient to meet the farmersâ€™ animal feed. We conclude that the adoption of improved forages and fodder species and better integrating crop-livestock production can sustainably alleviate human food and animal feed demands in the highlands of Ethiopia.|$|R
40|$|During {{production}} of <b>malt</b> from barley <b>seeds,</b> cell walls and starch granules in the endosperm are degraded. Although this modification process {{is important for}} malt quality, the modification patterns of individual barley seeds {{have yet to be}} reported. The use of destructive microscopy methods have previously limited the investigations to ensemble averages. X-ray dark-field radiography is a recent non-destructive imaging method which is sensitive to microstructural variations. In this study, the method was applied for quantitative in-situ monitoring of barley seeds. Microstructural changes relating to water uptake and modification were monitored over a 43 - 55 h period. Sub-resolution stress cracks as well as a dark-field signal believed to originate from starch granules were detected. The evolution of the dark-field signal followed the known modification pattern in barley seeds. Through image analysis, quantitative parameters describing the movement of the front of the observed pattern were obtained. Based on these findings, X-ray dark-field radiography presents a possible novel approach to monitor the modification of germinating barley seeds. Comment: 5 figures, 2 tables, 16 page...|$|R
40|$|In {{the absence}} of whole genome sequencing, {{molecular}} markers are indispensable tools {{for the study of}} genome evolution, genetic diversity measurements, and genotype identification. We have used sequence-specific amplified polymorphism (S-SAP) markers that were derived from the BARE- 1, an active retrotransposon of barley, to measure the contribution of this element to the evolution of barley genome among 103 cultivars that are commonly grown in Canada and the United States. The results were compared to the genome diversity measures obtained by the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP). The barley populations were divided into groups based on various agronomic traits such as end use, i. e., feed versus <b>malting,</b> and <b>seed</b> morphology, i. e., naked versus covered kernel. Analysis of the genetic structure in the population using analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) for both S-SAP and SNP attributed the largest co-variance component (90 %) to the genetic diversity among cultivars within groups. Co-variance component between groups was about 6 % which indicated that there was no justification for population differentiation along the set based upon agronomic traits. Genetic relationships among cultivars was assessed by cluster analysis with UPGMA and found to vary substantially between S-SAP and SNP datasets. Quantitative analysis of BARE- 1 retrotransposon with real-time PCR in a small group of cultivars showed significant differences in the copy number of the element among cultivars. Most of the BARE- 1 elements were in the form of solo LTRs, indicating a high rate of homologous recombination between retrotransposon copies in the genome. Differences of up to 3000 BARE- 1 copies per haploid genome were found among cultivars that have been developed and registered within the past three decades. Informative SNPs such as those with high polymorphic information content (PIC) values were used to generate identification keys to distinguish barley cultivars which were otherwise indistinguishable at the morphological and biochemical levels...|$|R
40|$|The {{management}} accounts in Farm Account Scheme (FAS) format of two Scottish farms in Organic conversion are examined and compared to Scottish average data. Farm 1 {{is a family}} run mixed farm with cereals, seed potatoes, cattle and sheep. Conversion has been phased with conversion ground in grass and set-aside, while cereals and potatoes have been grown conventionally until they could be grown organically. Cereal area was reduced so that livestock numbers and potato area could be maintained. The phased conversion plus organic aid payments has maintained the above average profitability although good prices for organic <b>malting</b> barley and <b>seed</b> potatoes have helped but these premiums may not be maintained. Farm 2 is an all grass dairy farm with two 150 cow pedigree Holstein herds on a high input high output system now 9 months into conversion. The two herds were reduced and merged on to one site to form one 200 cow herd. This released capital and labour was reduced by one man saving fixed costs, while yield per cow increased with only the grass in conversion. The challenge will be to maintain yield and profitability on organic feeds. The results to date show that with organic aid and careful planning of conversion and structural changes profitability can be maintained. Farm Management,...|$|R
40|$|Several barley (Hordeum vulgare) cultivars {{are used}} in the {{production}} of malt for brewing. The malt quality depends on the cultivar, its growth and storage conditions, and the industrial process. To enhance studies on malt quality, we embarked on a proteome analysis approach for barley <b>seeds</b> and <b>malt.</b> The proteome analysis includes two-dimensional (2 -D) gel electrophoresis, mass spectrometry, and bioinformatics for identification of selected proteins. This project initially focused on proteins in major spots in the neutral isoelectric point range (pI 4 - 7) including selected spots that differ between four barley cultivars. The excellent malting barley cultivar Barke was used as reference. Cultivar differences in the 2 -D gel spot patterns are observed both at the <b>seed</b> and the <b>malt</b> level. In <b>seed</b> extracts one of the proteins causing variations has been identified as an alpha-amylase/trypsin inhibitor. In malt extracts multiple forms of the alpha-amylase isozyme 2 have been identified in varying cultivar characteristic spot patterns. The present identification of proteins in major spots from 2 -D gels includes 27 different proteins from 42 spots from mature seed extract, while only three specific proteins were identified by analysing 13 different spots from the corresponding malt extract. It is suggested that post-translational processing causes the same protein to occur in different spots. Journal ArticleResearch Support, Non-U. S. Gov'tFLWINinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R
30|$|The grain protein {{concentrations}} of malting barley recorded from all treated plots were within the threshold range of grain protein content set by Assela Malt factory for malting purpose, 9.5 â€“ 11 %. Despite {{the fact that}} integrated applications of organic and mineral fertilizers gave optimum values in this study, care need {{to be given to}} timing of N application as it significantly influences the grain protein contents of malting barley. Previous studies including Kara (2010) showed that grain protein content of malting barley increased with late-season N application. Therefore, it should be taken into account that N top-dressing of malting barley at its late stage will increase protein content in grain beyond the upper limit for malting use. The N requirement of the crop at its latest stage is expected to be fulfilled by the mineralization of organic amendments so that growers need to be cautious about top-dressing at booting stage. Though grain protein content of malting barley did not surpass the upper threshold limit during the 2 -year study, there may be a chance of increased mineralization of N at the late stage of the crop development depending on environmental conditions. Therefore, <b>seeding</b> <b>malting</b> barley with low protein content, such as the variety used in this study, lowers the risk of the grain protein content exceeding beyond the threshold limit (Oâ€™Donovan et al. 2015). Besides, monitoring of grain quality on long-term application of organic amendments is required as the buildup and mineralization of N may increase grain protein concentrations.|$|R
40|$|Breeding for malting {{quality is}} an {{important}} goal of malting barley breeding programs. Malting quality is a complex phenotype that combines {{a large number of}} interrelated components, each of which shows complex inheritance. Currently, only a few genes involved in determining malting quality have been characterized. We combined transcript profiling with phenotypic correlations to identify candidate genes for malting quality. The Barley 1 GeneChipÂ® array containing 22, 792 probe sets was used to conduct transcript profiling of genes expressed in several different stages of malting of four malting cultivars. Genes that were differentially expressed in comparisons between different malting stages relative to ungerminated seed, as well as in comparisons between malting cultivars in the same malting stage were identified. Correlation analysis of 723 differentially expressed genes with malting quality phenotypes showed that 11 â€“ 102 of these genes correlated with six malting quality phenotypes. Genes involved in carbohydrate metabolism were among the positively correlated genes. Genes for protein and lipid metabolism, cell wall organization and biogenesis, and genes involved in stress and defense response also correlated with malting quality phenotypes. Expressed sequence tags (ESTs) were generated from a â€˜malting-gene enrichedâ€™ cDNA library made by suppression subtractive hybridization between <b>malted</b> and ungerminated <b>seeds</b> of â€˜Morexâ€™. Eleven percent of the ESTs had no significant homology with sequences in the databases, suggesting that there may be other malting-related genes not represented in the barley gene chip array. The results provide candidate genes for malting quality phenotypes that need to be functionally validated...|$|R

Growth of the organism was not significantly affected by aw, except at the lowest value, but production of SI was significantly enhanced at intermediate aW in the range 0. 990 - 0. 980. For example, at 25 Â°C and 0. 98 aw wheat extract produced a l Ox increase in titre compared to 0. 998 aw at the same temperature. Wheat extract was shown {{to be the best}} substrate for SI production. For example, at 25 Â°C and 0. 98 aW, this substrate produced 2 x, 5 x and 8 x increases in titres compared to oat, <b>malt</b> and oil <b>seed</b> rape extracts respectively. A range of raw and processed agricultural products, including those used as extracts with the Phoma species, as well as maize, rice, soya, wheat flakes, bulgar wheat, couscous and "shredded wheat", were selected as candidate materials for solid substrate fermentation (SSF). Moisture sorption isotherms were prepared for each of these so that aW could be accurately set in experimental work. Small scale fermentations (40 cm 3 wet substrate volume) were carried out with these materials and the fungi Epicoccum nigrum, Sarophorum palmicola, Drechslera dematioidea and Corynespora cassiicola over the aw range 0. 998 - 0. 970. Studies with E. nigrum in particular produced a range of unique metabolites at low aw, and other metabolites where titres were increased by as much as 20 x compared to high aW conditions. The optimum aw level for metabolite production in this fungus appeared to be in the range 0. 990 - 0. 980. Ultimately, E. nigrum was chosen as the model fungus and bulgar wheat as the model substrate, with 3 key target metabolites being followed (metabolites 1, 2 and 3). A series of scale-up studies (40 cm 3 - 3 litres wet volume) were carried out utilising the model system. These studies typically produced reasonable levels of metabolites, but were subject to problematic water and heat accumulation, and bacterial contamination. These were identified as critical parameters. A system was ultimately developed around a Bioengineering AG submerged liquid fermenter, modified for use with solid substrates, and incorporating forced aeration and mechanical agitation. This apparatus gave encouraging levels of metabolites, producing most of these rapidly and uniformly, and showed good critical parameter control. The overall scale-up achieved in the final fermenter studies was 75 x, in terms of wet substrate volume. Increased titres were achieved for all three target metabolites compared to small-scale studies with the same substrate. These increases were approx. 17 x for metabolite 1, approx. 3 x for metabolite 3, while metabolite 2 was absent from small scale studies at the relevant aW level.
