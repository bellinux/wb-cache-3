5|$|The quadrille {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} dance of the Dominican folk tradition, which also includes the lancer and distinctive forms of several dances, many of them derived from European styles. The bidjin (biguine), mereng (<b>méringue),</b> sotis (schottische), polka pil (pure polka), vals o vyenn (Viennese waltz) and mazouk (mazurka) are particularly widespread.|$|E
5|$|Though zouk is {{the most}} {{well-known}} form of modern French Antillean music, the island of Martinique has also produced the chouval bwa and biguine styles, which were especially popular in the early 20th century. Chouval bwa is includes multiple distinctive instruments and internationally famous performers like Claude Germany, Dede Saint-Prix, Pakatak and Tumpak, while biguine has achieved international fame since the 1920s and has since been modernized and adapted for pop audiences, making it {{a major influence on}} zouk. Between the 1930s and 1950s, the dance biguine was popular among the islands' dance orchestras. The biguine uses a cinquillo variant related to that found in other Caribbean genres like <b>méringue</b> and Compas. In the 1940s and 1950s, these dance bands absorbed influences from Cuban, American and Haitian popular music.|$|E

50|$|They are light, airy {{and sweet}} confections. Homemade <b>meringues</b> are often chewy and soft with a crisp exterior, {{although}} a uniform crisp texture may be achieved {{at home by}} baking at a low temperature (180 - 200 F) {{for an extended period}} of up to two hours, whilst many commercial <b>meringues</b> are crisp throughout.|$|R
25|$|Zefir is {{somewhat}} similar in its consistency to marshmallows, Schokokuss or krembo. It {{is derived from}} the traditional Russian pastila but with added egg white foam and a gelling agent. The form typically resembles traditional <b>meringue.</b> However, in contrast to commercial <b>meringue,</b> it is never crisp. It is usually of white or rose color.|$|E

25|$|The pavlova has a {{crisp and}} crunchy outer shell, and a soft, moist marshmallow-like centre, in {{contrast}} to <b>meringue</b> which is usually solid throughout. It has been suggested the addition of cornflour {{is responsible for the}} marshmallow centre, although it has been debated that the cornflour is just another egg white stabiliser in addition to the acid. The consistency also makes the pavlova significantly more fragile than <b>meringue.</b> Because the pavlova is notorious for deflating if exposed to cold air, when cooking is complete it is left in the oven to fully cool down before the oven door is opened.|$|E
25|$|Pavlova is made {{by beating}} egg whites (and {{sometimes}} salt) to a very stiff consistency before folding in caster sugar, vinegar or another acid (e.g. cream of tartar or lemon juice), cornflour, and sometimes vanilla essence, and slow-baking the mixture, similar to <b>meringue.</b>|$|E

5000|$|There are {{two types}} of meringue-based buttercream: Italian and Swiss. The <b>meringues</b> must be cooled to room {{temperature}} in order not to melt the butter (which has a variable melting point below [...] ) as it is subsequently beaten in.|$|R
25|$|Pavlova is {{traditionally}} {{decorated with a}} topping of whipped cream and fresh soft fruit such as kiwifruit, passionfruit, and strawberries. Factory-made pavlovas {{can be purchased at}} supermarkets and decorated as desired. A commercial product is available that includes pre-mixed ingredients for baking the <b>meringue</b> shell, requiring only the addition of water and sugar.|$|E
25|$|Compas (konpa) (also {{known as}} compas direct in French, or konpa dirèk in creole) is a complex, ever-changing music that arose from African rhythms and European ballroom dancing, mixed with Haiti's bourgeois culture. It is a refined music, with <b>méringue</b> as its basic rhythm. Haiti had no {{recorded}} music until 1937 when Jazz Guignard was recorded non-commercially.|$|E
25|$|Copper is {{reactive}} with acidic foods {{which can}} result in corrosion, the byproducts of which can foment copper toxicity. In certain circumstances, however, unlined copper is recommended and safe, for instance {{in the preparation of}} <b>meringue,</b> where copper ions prompt proteins to denature (unfold) and enable stronger protein bonds across the sulfur contained in egg whites. Unlined copper is also used in the making of preserves, jams and jellies. Copper does not store ("bank") heat, and so thermal flows reverse almost immediately upon removal from heat. This allows precise control of consistency and texture while cooking sugar and pectin-thickened preparations. Alone, fruit acid would be sufficient to cause leaching of copper byproducts, but naturally occurring fruit sugars and added preserving sugars buffer copper reactivity. Unlined pans have thereby been used safely in such applications for centuries.|$|E

40|$|The {{field of}} {{molecular}} gastronomy involves interaction between chefs and scientists. On {{the one hand}} it can help to implement new ideas and recipes in restaurants. At the same time, it challenges the scientists to apply their understanding of - in many cases - ideal systems to the non-ideality of everyday life, and it challenges them to expand scientific understanding of many chemical and physical mechanisms in every day life food products. In this communication we give an example on how knowledge acquired on regular <b>meringues</b> and on foams in general {{can be applied to}} give rise to new restaurant based types of <b>meringues</b> (savory based, and milk based, instead of egg-white based) ...|$|R
5000|$|Some {{people with}} this {{condition}} tolerate small quantities of egg whites. [...] They {{are more often}} able to tolerate well-cooked eggs, such as found in cake or dried egg-based pasta, than loosely cooked eggs, such as fried eggs or <b>meringues,</b> or uncooked eggs.|$|R
25|$|In 2011, Momota {{appeared}} in Mika Ninagawa's cosplay photoshoot {{series in the}} fashion magazine Zipper dressed as a bee and a ladybug. She continued to appear as a model in Ninagawa's works in Mgirl magazine from Fall/Winter 2011/2012 {{and again in the}} issue from Spring/Summer 2013. On April 14, 2012, Momota succeeded famous child actress Mana Ashida as subhost of the Nippon Television show <b>Meringue</b> no Kimochi. At that time, neither she nor Momoiro Clover Z was widely known. But when in 2013 it was announced that she would leave the program after almost a year and a half, there were worries that it would affect the popularity of the show. In August 2013, Momota became the first person to appear on both the front and back covers of an issue of QuickJapan magazine, which also published a lengthy interview with her.|$|E
25|$|The {{hotel has}} two {{well-known}} restaurants: the Grill Room (usually {{known as the}} Savoy Grill), {{on the north side}} of the building, with its entrance off the Strand, and the Savoy Restaurant (formerly known as the River Restaurant, now named Kaspars), on the south side, overlooking the River Thames. The latter has long been famous for its inventive chefs, beginning in 1890, with the celebrity chef Auguste Escoffier. Escoffier created many famous dishes at the Savoy. In 1893, he invented the pêche Melba in honour of the Australian singer Nellie Melba, and in 1897, Melba toast. Other Escoffier creations were bombe Néro (a flaming ice), fraises à la Sarah Bernhardt (strawberries with pineapple and Curaçao sorbet), baisers de Vierge (<b>meringue</b> with vanilla cream and crystallised white rose and violet petals) and suprêmes de volailles Jeannette (jellied chicken breasts with foie gras). Another signature dish is the Omelette Arnold Bennett.|$|E

50|$|Cake {{is a form}} {{of sweet}} dessert that is {{typically}} baked. In its oldest forms, cakes were modifications of breads, but cakes now cover a wide range of preparations that can be simple or elaborate, and that share features with other desserts such as pastries, <b>meringues,</b> custards, and pies.|$|R
500|$|The {{names of}} dishes are {{overwhelmingly}} in English, {{even when the}} dish is in fact foreign; thus [...] "To make Cream Cakes" [...] is the heading for the recipe for <b>meringue,</b> beginning [...] "Beat the whites of nine eggs to a stiff froth, then stir it gently with a spoon, for fear the froth should fall".|$|E
500|$|Later, in 1975, Hordern narrated Barry Lyndon, Stanley Kubrick's filmed {{adaptation}} of William Makepeace Thackeray's novel The Luck of Barry Lyndon. The critic John Riley, {{writing for the}} British Film Institute, thought that the actor provided [...] "a witty and ironic foil to the characters' helplessness". [...] The same year Hordern was asked to narrate 30 episodes of the children's animation series Paddington, {{which was based on}} the Paddington Bear book series by Michael Bond. In his 1993 autobiography, Hordern wrote of his enjoyment at working on Paddington and that he could not differentiate between his enjoyment in comedy and drama: [...] "it's a bit like difference between roast beef and <b>meringue,</b> both delicious in their way, but there is nothing more satisfying than a thousand people sharing their laughter with you".|$|E
2500|$|The {{first known}} {{recorded}} recipe named [...] "pavlova" [...] {{was published in}} the fifth Australian edition of Davis Dainty Dishes in 1926. However this [...] "pavlova" [...] recipe was not <b>meringue</b> based, but was instead a multi-coloured gelatine dish.|$|E
50|$|Due to {{its ability}} to mimic {{functional}} properties of egg whites in cooking, aquafaba {{can be used as}} a direct replacement for them in some cases, including <b>meringues</b> and marshmallows. Its composition makes it especially suitable for use by people with dietary, ethical, or religious reasons to avoid eggs.|$|R
6000|$|... "His trouble," [...] said Billy, [...] "was that {{he stood}} in with a {{contractor}} who was putting up a music-hall, and the contractor put it up with material about as strong as a heap of <b>meringues,</b> and it collapsed on the third night and killed half the audience." ...|$|R
