Materials and methods: Urine samples were collected from 123 healthy Italian subjects {{who had not been}} occupationally exposed to n-hexane or <b>methyl-n-butyl</b> <b>ketone</b> (60 men and 63 women; 53 living in urban areas and 70 living in rural areas; 36 smokers and 87 nonsmokers: 65 aged above 35 years and 58 aged below 35 years). The determinations were performed by a gas chromatography method using a flame ionization detector (FID). A quality-control step was realized by analysis of 78 of these samples by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with UV detection. Results and discussion: The distribution of 2, 5 -HD concentration was log-normal and the corresponding centiles at the 95...|$|E
40|$|Background: 2, 5 -hexanedione (2, 5 -HD) is {{the main}} {{neurotoxic}} metabolite of <b>methyl-n-butyl</b> <b>ketone</b> (MBK) and n-hexane, and known to cause polyneuropathy. The aim of our study was to compare the urinary levels of 2, 5 -HD between cases with cryptogenic polyneuropathy and the general Swedish population, and to elucidate the role of certain external factors. Methods: Morning urine samples were collected from 114 cases with cryptogenic polyneuropathy (77 men and 37 women) and 227 referents (110 men and 117 women) randomly selected from the population registry. None had any current occupational exposure to n-hexane or MBK. The urine samples were analysed by a gas chromatographic method based on acidic hydrolysis. Results: Cases had statistically higher urinary levels of 2, 5 -HD (0. 48 mg/L) {{than the general population}} (0. 41 mg/L) and men higher excretion than women (0. 48 mg/L and 0. 38 mg/L, respectively). There was no difference in 2, 5 -HD levels between current smokers and non-smokers. Occupational exposure to xylene, alcohol consumption and ever exposed to general anaesthesia were associated with lower excretion in men while for occupational exposure to nitrous oxide in women higher excretion was seen. Higher excretion of 2, 5 HD was inversely related to increasing age. Conclusions: Significantly higher levels of urinary 2, 5 -HD were seen in men and cryptogenic polyneuropathy cases seemingly unexposed to n-hexane. Hypothetically, this might be due to either differences in metabolic patterns or some concealed exposure. The difference in means between cases and the general population is small and can therefore not allow any firm conclusions of the causality, however...|$|E
