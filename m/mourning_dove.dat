5|$|The <b>mourning</b> <b>dove</b> {{was thought}} to be the {{passenger}} pigeon's closest living relative, based on morphological grounds. The <b>mourning</b> <b>dove</b> was even suggested to belong to the same genus, Ectopistes, and was listed by some authors as E. carolinensis.|$|E
5|$|The <b>mourning</b> <b>dove</b> {{appears as}} the Carolina turtle-dove on plate 286 of Audubon's Birds of America.|$|E
5|$|The {{number of}} {{individual}} mourning doves {{is estimated to}} be approximately 475 million. The large population and its vast range explain why the <b>mourning</b> <b>dove</b> is considered to be of least concern, meaning that the species is not at immediate risk. As a gamebird, the <b>mourning</b> <b>dove</b> is well-managed, with more than 20 million (and up to 40–70 million) shot by hunters each year.|$|E
5|$|Most <b>mourning</b> <b>doves</b> migrate along flyways over land. On rare occasions, <b>mourning</b> <b>doves</b> {{have been}} seen flying over the Gulf of Mexico, but this is exceptional. Spring {{migration}} north runs from March to May. Fall migration south runs from September to November, with immatures moving first, followed by adult females and then by adult males. Migration is usually during the day, in flocks, and at low altitudes. However, not all individuals migrate. Even in Canada some <b>mourning</b> <b>doves</b> remain through winter, sustained {{by the presence of}} bird feeders.|$|R
5|$|<b>Mourning</b> <b>doves</b> eat almost {{exclusively}} seeds, {{which make up}} more than 99% of their diet. Rarely, they will eat snails or insects. <b>Mourning</b> <b>doves</b> generally eat enough to fill their crops and then fly away to digest while resting. They often swallow grit such as fine gravel or sand to assist with digestion. The species usually forages on the ground, walking but not hopping. At bird feeders, <b>mourning</b> <b>doves</b> are attracted to one of the largest ranges of seed types of any North American bird, with a preference for canola, corn, millet, safflower, and sunflower seeds. <b>Mourning</b> <b>doves</b> do not dig or scratch for seeds, though they will push aside ground litter; instead they eat what is readily visible. They will sometimes perch on plants and eat from there.|$|R
5|$|<b>Mourning</b> <b>doves</b> {{are light}} grey and brown and {{generally}} muted in color. Males and females {{are similar in}} appearance. The species is generally monogamous, with two squabs (young) per brood. Both parents incubate {{and care for the}} young. <b>Mourning</b> <b>doves</b> eat almost exclusively seeds, but the young are fed crop milk by their parents.|$|R
5|$|Like other columbids, the <b>mourning</b> <b>dove</b> drinks by suction, without lifting or tilting its head. It often gathers at {{drinking}} spots around {{dawn and}} dusk.|$|E
5|$|The eastern <b>mourning</b> <b>dove</b> (Z. m. carolinensis) is Wisconsin's {{official}} {{symbol of}} peace. The bird is also Michigan's state bird of peace.|$|E
5|$|The <b>mourning</b> <b>dove</b> {{is closely}} related to the eared dove (Zenaida auriculata) and the Socorro dove (Zenaida graysoni). Some {{authorities}} describe them as forming a superspecies and these three birds are sometimes classified in the separate genus Zenaidura, but the current classification has them as separate species in the genus Zenaida. In addition, the Socorro dove has at times been considered conspecific with the <b>mourning</b> <b>dove,</b> although several differences in behavior, call, and appearance justify separation as two different species. While the three species do form a subgroup of Zenaida, using a separate genus would interfere with the monophyly of Zenaida by making it paraphyletic.|$|E

5|$|<b>Mourning</b> <b>doves</b> show a {{preference}} for the seeds of certain species of plant over others. Foods taken in preference to others include pine nuts, sweetgum seeds, and the seeds of pokeberry, amaranth, canary grass, corn, sesame, and wheat. When their favorite foods are absent, <b>mourning</b> <b>doves</b> will eat the seeds of other plants, including buckwheat, rye, goosegrass and smartweed.|$|R

5|$|The <b>mourning</b> <b>dove</b> is monogamous {{and forms}} strong pair bonds. Pairs {{typically}} reconvene {{in the same}} area the following breeding season, and sometimes may remain together throughout the winter. However, lone doves will find new partners if necessary.|$|E
5|$|References to {{mourning}} doves appear {{frequently in}} Native American literature. <b>Mourning</b> <b>dove</b> imagery also turns up in contemporary American and Canadian poetry {{in the work}} of poets as diverse as Robert Bly, Jared Carter, Lorine Niedecker, and Charles Wright.|$|E
5|$|The <b>mourning</b> <b>dove</b> is {{a related}} species to the {{passenger}} pigeon (Ectopistes migratorius), which was hunted to extinction in the early 1900s. For this reason, {{the possibility of using}} mourning doves for cloning the passenger pigeon has been discussed.|$|E

5|$|In 1930, the South Carolina Federated Women's club {{adopted the}} Carolina wren as the {{unofficial}} state bird over the eastern <b>mourning</b> <b>dove</b> and pushed for its official state adoption until 1939, when the South Carolina Legislature named the northern mockingbird {{as the state}} bird. In 1948, the legislature repealed their previous decision, and the wren became the official state bird.|$|E
5|$|Mourning doves can be {{afflicted with}} several {{different}} parasites and diseases, including tapeworms, nematodes, mites, and lice. The mouth-dwelling parasite Trichomonas gallinae is particularly severe. While a <b>mourning</b> <b>dove</b> will sometimes host it without symptoms, it will often cause yellowish {{growth in the}} mouth and esophagus that will eventually starve the host to death. Avian pox is a common, insect-vectored disease.|$|E

5|$|The primary predators of {{this species}} are diurnal birds of prey, such as falcons and hawks. During nesting, corvids, grackles, housecats, or rat snakes will prey on their eggs. Cowbirds rarely parasitize <b>mourning</b> <b>dove</b> nests. Mourning doves reject {{slightly}} under a third of cowbird eggs in such nests, and the mourning dove's vegetarian diet is unsuitable for cowbirds.|$|E
5|$|While some of {{the native}} flora and fauna of the Sonoran Desert can be found within Phoenix city limits, most {{are found in the}} suburbs and the undeveloped desert areas {{surrounding}} the city. Native mammal species include coyote, javelina, bobcat, mountain lion, desert cottontail rabbit, jackrabbit, antelope ground squirrel, mule deer, ringtail, coati, and multiple species of bats, such as the Mexican free-tailed bat and western pipistrelle, that roost in and around the city. There are many species of native birds, including Costa's hummingbird, Anna's hummingbird, Gambel's quail, Gila woodpecker, <b>mourning</b> <b>dove,</b> white-winged dove, the roadrunner, the cactus wren, and many species of raptors, including falcons, hawks, owls, vultures (such as the turkey vulture and black vulture), and eagles, including the golden and the bald eagle.|$|E

5|$|The male then {{leads the}} female to {{potential}} nest sites, {{and the female}} will choose one. The female dove builds the nest. The male will fly about, gather material, {{and bring it to}} her. The male will stand on the female's back and give the material to the female, who then builds it into the nest. The nest is constructed of twigs, conifer needles, or grass blades, and is of flimsy construction. <b>Mourning</b> <b>doves</b> will sometimes requisition the unused nests of other <b>mourning</b> <b>doves,</b> other birds, or arboreal mammals such as squirrels.|$|R

5|$|Of the 127 {{bird species}} found along the Merced River, only 35 occur {{along the entire}} length of the river. Many of these birds are migratory and only pass the area a few times every year, while 109 species of birds are found only in the {{breeding}} season. Birds are more abundant along the slow-moving lower river, which has more suitable riparian habitat compared to the rocky, swift upper river. Common species of bird throughout the basin include ruby-crowned kinglet, cedar waxwing, American robin, yellow-rumped warbler, tree swallow and European starling, and several endangered species, including white-tailed kite and Swainson's hawk. Birds that occur commonly in the middle and upper sections of the Merced River include <b>mourning</b> <b>dove,</b> Cassin's finch, California quail, dark-eyed junco, woodpecker, dipper, great blue heron, scrub jay, red-winged blackbird, red-tailed hawk, turkey vulture, cliff swallow, canyon wren, merganser, and bald eagles. Common insects found along the river include mayflies, stoneflies and caddisflies. The river is impacted by invasive Asiatic clam, Chinese mitten crab, and New Zealand mud snail.|$|E
