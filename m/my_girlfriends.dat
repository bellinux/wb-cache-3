500|$|The {{inspiration}} {{is taken}} from my own life, but also all <b>my</b> <b>girlfriends</b> who are very strong, confident girls {{who want to be}} their best in all levels of life. They’re kind of like overachievers and never seem to be satisfied with how [...] they achieve in life. I can see that with myself as well because you expect so much from yourself. You expect yourself to be the best friend, have a great career, be really talented and be able to cook—you just have to be great at everything. I think genders have been washed out a little bit -- like you have to have masculine qualities as well as feminine. It’s just a song that recognizes {{what it takes to be}} a girl today, and it’s quite a lot.|$|E
500|$|Gaga {{created a}} pair of razor-blade sunglasses—which she {{believed}} portrayed tough female spirit—to wear in the video, explaining [...] "I wanted to design a pair {{for some of the}} toughest chicks and some of <b>my</b> <b>girlfriends</b> ... they used to keep razor blades in the side of their mouths ... That tough female spirit is something that I want to project. It's meant to be, 'This is my shield, this is my weapon, this is my inner sense of fame, this is my monster.' Gaga also said that the video shows [...] "how the entertainment industry can, in a metaphorical way, simulate human trafficking - products being sold, the woman perceived as a commodity." [...] The white latex suits in the video were inspired by the wolf costume from the film Where the Wild Things Are. Gaga also wore designer Alexander McQueen's [...] high shoes and the famous [...] "Alien" [...] shoes.|$|E

500|$|Music critics universally {{criticized the}} video {{because of the}} limited amount of {{clothing}} Hilson wore in it. In an interview with gossip hound Perez Hilton, Hilson defended the clip, calling the video [...] "racy" [...] but {{in line with the}} perspective of her album: [...] "If you put it in context with my album, my album is called No Boys Allowed but really it means no bullshit allowed. In this album, I was screaming in a room — just like I was screaming in the song — I was screaming in a room with all <b>my</b> <b>girlfriends,</b> yelling all the shit we really say." [...] Rebecca Thomas of MTV News wrote: [...] "A platinum-blond Keri gyrates, thrusts, licks and gets (way) low as she laces the song with enough saucy language and expletives to make your favorite rapper blush." [...] while Jocelyn Vena the same news division of MTV commented that even though there are several cameo appearances in the mini-move, it is ultimately Hilson's [...] "scantily clad popping and locking that has everyone buzzing."

5000|$|Well {{honestly}} {{the inspiration}} for that is Bobby Robert Lopez.

I knew I was gonna marry him but he lived with his parents, he didn’t have a job. He was writing this crazy, puppet musical Avenue Q and so the word, fixer-upper, has always been in my lexicon.|$|E
