5|$|In 2014, {{the most}} recent year for which {{statistics}} are available, AirTrain JFK carried 6,487,118 paid passengers, with another 10 million using the service for free on-airport travel. This is a 247% increase over 2004, the first full year of operation, when 2,623,791 riders paid. The 2014 paid ridership is 12% of the 53.2 million passengers that used JFK that year. The ridership of AirTrain JFK has risen each year from 2004 to 2014, which Governor Andrew Cuomo touted in a 2015 announcement in which he also announced the plan for AirTrain LaGuardia, a similar system to be built at LaGuardia Airport. The $5 fare is much cheaper than the $45 one <b>must</b> <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> a taxi between Manhattan and JFK, which may be a factor in the increased ridership.|$|E

25|$|As Singapore is a {{small island}} with a high {{population}} density, the number of private {{cars on the road}} is restricted so as to curb pollution and congestion. Car buyers <b>must</b> <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> duties one-and-a-half times the vehicle's market value, and bid for a Singaporean Certificate of Entitlement (COE), which allows the car to run on the road for a decade. The cost of the Singaporean certificate of entitlement alone would buy a Porsche Boxster in the United States. Car prices are generally significantly higher in Singapore than in other English-speaking countries. As with most Commonwealth countries, vehicles on the road and people walking on the streets keep to the left.|$|E
25|$|Since the Stelo was the {{currency}} of Esperantists, {{a good example of}} its utility was the publication of a monthly magazine and the payment of rents and salaries.

25|$|Domestic {{immersion}} heaters, usually {{rated at}} 3 kilowatts {{and on a}} 1.5-inch British Standard Pipe screwplug in the UK, run on the normal domestic electricity supply, but users may also {{take advantage of a}} cheaper, off-peak electricity tariff such as Economy 7 (in the UK). In a typical off-peak installation, a lower immersion heater is connected to the separately switched off-peak heating circuit and an upper heater is connected to the normal circuit via its own switch. The consumer then has the option to top up the available hot water supply at any time, rather than waiting for the cheaper supply to turn on (typically after midnight). A poorly insulated hot water cylinder will increase running costs because a consumer <b>must</b> <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> electricity used to replace lost heat.|$|E
25|$|One {{approach}} {{considers the}} problem {{from the perspective of}} who benefits most from the public good. This approach is sensitive to the fact that different preferences exist between different income classes. The public good is viewed in a similar way as a private good, where those who use the public good <b>must</b> <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> it. Some people will benefit more from the public good than others, thus creating inequalities in the absence of benefit taxes. A difficulty with public goods is determining who exactly benefits from the public good, although some estimates of the distribution of {{the costs and benefits of}} global warming have been made – see above. Additionally, this approach does not provide guidance as to how the surplus of benefits from climate policy should be shared.|$|E
25|$|Households are {{not allowed}} to produce their own aloalo or coffins or make use of their own tomb {{construction}} materials or ombilahy zebu - all must be purchased or commissioned from a specialized clan that the household has historically relied on to produce these items, and the household <b>must</b> <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> them in zebu and food. Carrying out the various ceremonies and tomb construction can take a year or more, during which time the wife of the deceased must stay with the corpse in the deceased's home. His oldest son is responsible for procuring the vatolahy - upright stone markers up to two meters tall that form part of the tomb structure - while his daughters are responsible for procuring the aloalo and sacrificial zebus; the remaining family members and friends procure the stones required for the construction of the tomb. The tomb's size is consequently dependent {{on the size of the}} family and the deceased's social standing.|$|E

500|$|Rolling Stone writer Caryn Ganz {{disliked the}} two {{original}} ballads, [...] "Christmas Time Is In the Air Again" [...] and [...] "One Child", describing them [...] "both thick with gooey orchestration", but praised [...] "Oh Santa!" [...] and [...] "When Christmas Comes" [...] for their uptempo melodies. However, she was {{confused by the}} re-recording of [...] "All I Want for Christmas Is You", saying that [...] "It's {{hard to figure out}} what's 'extra festive, and quipped that it is [...] "far easier to determine what's wrong with 'Auld Lang Syne' (an awkward dance beat)". Ganz concluded with [...] "the LP's warm heart is in the right place." [...] Eric Henderson of Slant Magazine gave the album {{two and a half stars}} our of five, writing [...] "Everything about Carey’s sequel to 1994’s buoyant, if, in retrospect, safe, Merry Christmas is as desperate and habitual as it is reassuringly predictable." [...] While he continued to label it as an [...] "incredibly adventureless album," [...] he also wrote that it is a [...] "remarkably comforting listen". He felt that Merry Christmas II You was not a sequel, or a remake, but rather an attempt at rewinding time on Carey's part. Rich Juzwiak of The Village Voice was critical of Merry Christmas II You. He described [...] "One Child" [...] as a [...] "needless retelling", [...] "Oh Santa!" [...] as trying too hard and too difficult to sing along to and [...] "All I Want for Christmas Is You (Extra Festive)" [...] as a desperate attempt at Carey canonising herself for re-recording her own song. [...] "The near-crazed desperation to please listeners for her own sake is all over Merry Christmas II You: A [...] "gift" [...] to her fans (or so she claims) that they, of course, <b>must</b> <b>pay</b> <b>for,</b> it's her fascinating, career-long saga of self-obsession in a nutshell." ...|$|E
