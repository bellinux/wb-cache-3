5|$|The county {{colleges of}} New Jersey {{represent}} 56% of all undergraduate {{students in the}} state and offer studies in 1,700 degree and certificate programs. Reflecting long-term trends nationwide, the <b>male-to-female</b> ratio of students in the system is 41% male to 59% female, and 48% of students are over the age of 24. Overall, the system enrolls more than 350,000 students each year on campuses that range in size from 1,300 students at Salem Community College to over 15,000 students at Bergen Community College.|$|E
5|$|The {{incidence}} of AML increases with age; {{the median age}} at diagnosis is 63 years. AML accounts for about 90% of all acute leukemias in adults, but is rare in children. The rate of therapy-related AML (that is, AML caused by previous chemotherapy) is rising; therapy-related disease currently accounts for about 10–20% of all cases of AML. AML is slightly more common in men, with a <b>male-to-female</b> ratio of 1.3:1.|$|E
5|$|This is {{believed}} to be due to the increased exposure of mucosal tissue to potential infection sites. Transmission risk from infected female to male is around 4–5% annually. Suppressive antiviral therapy reduces these risks by 50%. Antivirals also help prevent the development of symptomatic HSV in infection scenarios, meaning the infected partner will be seropositive but symptom-free by about 50%. Condom use also reduces the transmission risk significantly. Condom use is much more effective at preventing <b>male-to-female</b> transmission than vice versa. Previous HSV-1 infection may reduce the risk for acquisition of HSV-2 infection among women by a factor of three, although the one study that states this has a small sample size of 14 transmissions out of 214 couples.|$|E

25|$|In early Medina, gender-variant <b>male-to-female</b> Islamic {{people were}} {{acknowledged}} {{in the form}} of the Mukhannathun. In Ancient Rome, the Gallae were castrated followers of the Phrygian goddess Cybele and can be regarded as transgender in today's terms.|$|E
25|$|In 2001, female {{students}} who had been sexually harassed in school reported <b>male-to-female</b> harassment that was one-on-one while male students who experienced sexual harassment reported either one-to-one harassment by a female, or harassment {{by a group of}} females.|$|E
25|$|Polygyny is more {{widespread}} in Africa {{than in any}} other continent, especially in West Africa, and some scholars see the slave trade's impact on the <b>male-to-female</b> sex ratio as a key factor in the emergence and fortification of polygynous practices in regions of Africa.|$|E
25|$|In sexual {{reassignment}} surgery, in {{the case}} of the <b>male-to-female</b> transgender patient, labiaplasty is usually the second stage of a two-stage vaginoplasty operation, where labiaplastic techniques are applied to create labia minora and a clitoral hood. In this procedure, the labiaplasty is usually performed some months after the first stage of vaginoplasty.|$|E
25|$|The {{voices of}} <b>male-to-female</b> transgender, or transfeminine, individuals, is often {{but not always}} {{affected}} by social and medical transition. Transition for transfeminine individuals can include but {{is not limited to}} voice training, tracheal shaves, and feminizing hormones and/or antiandrogen drugs, all of which can alter the physical and sociolingustic characteristics of speech.|$|E
25|$|Firstly, {{if one is}} to {{decrease}} testosterone in <b>male-to-female</b> gender transition, {{it is likely that}} sexual desire and arousal would be inhibited; alternatively, if high doses of estrogen negatively impact sexual desire, which has been found in some research with cisgender women, it is hypothesized that combining androgens with high levels of estrogen would intensify this outcome. Unfortunately, to date there haven’t been any randomized clinical trials looking at the relationship between type and dose of hormone replacement therapy, so the relationship between them remains unclear. Typically, the estrogens given for <b>male-to-female</b> gender transition are 2-3 times higher than the recommended dose for HRT in postmenopausal women. Pharmokinetic studies indicate taking these increased doses may lead to a higher boost in plasma estradiol levels; however, the long-term side effects haven’t been studied and the safety of this route is unclear.|$|E
25|$|Individuals make {{different}} choices regarding sex reassignment therapy, {{which may}} include female-to-male or <b>male-to-female</b> {{hormone replacement therapy}} (HRT) to modify secondary sex characteristics, sex reassignment surgery (such as orchiectomy) to alter primary sex characteristics, chest surgery such as top surgery or breast augmentation, or, {{in the case of}} trans women, a trachea shave, facial feminization surgery or permanent hair removal.|$|E

25|$|Today, {{polygyny}} is {{more widespread}} in Africa {{than in any}} other continent. Some scholars see the slave trade's impact on the <b>male-to-female</b> sex ratio as a key factor in the emergence and fortification of polygynous practices in regions of Africa. Generally in rural areas with growing populations, the higher the incidence of polygyny, the greater the delay of first marriage for young men. The higher the average polygyny rate, the greater the element of gerontocracy and social stratification.|$|E
25|$|The anal sphincters {{are usually}} tighter than the pelvic {{muscles of the}} vagina, which can enhance the sexual {{pleasure}} for the inserting male during <b>male-to-female</b> anal intercourse because of the pressure applied to the penis. Men may also enjoy the penetrative role during anal sex because of its association with dominance, because it is made more alluring by a female partner or society in general insisting that it is forbidden, or because it presents an additional option for penetration.|$|E
25|$|In the 2001 case Re Kevin – {{validity}} of marriage of transsexual, the Family Court of Australia recognised {{the right of}} transsexual people to marry according to their current gender {{as opposed to the}} gender of their birth; this did not permit same-sex marriage {{from the perspective of the}} genders the couple identifies as, but it did mean that a <b>male-to-female</b> transsexual could legally marry a man, and a female-to-male transsexual could legally marry a woman.|$|E
25|$|As Singaporean gynaecological {{surgeons}} {{became more}} skillful, {{leaders in the}} field like Prof. S Shan Ratnam were authorised to perform Sex reassignment surgery <b>male-to-female</b> (SRS) at Kandang Kerbau Hospital. The first such operation in Asia took place in Singapore in July 1971. However, before patients could go under the knife, they first had to subject themselves to an exhaustive battery of tests and be given a clean psychological bill of health by chief academic psychiatrist Prof. Tsoi Wing Foo.|$|E
25|$|The size, colour, {{and shape}} of labia vary significantly, and may change {{as a result of}} childbirth, aging and other events. Conditions {{addressed}} by labiaplasty include congenital defects and abnormalities such as vaginal atresia (absent vaginal passage), Müllerian agenesis (malformed uterus and fallopian tubes), intersex conditions (male and female sexual characteristics in a person); and tearing and stretching of the labia minora caused by childbirth, accident and age. In a <b>male-to-female</b> sexual reassignment vaginoplasty {{for the creation of a}} neovagina, labiaplasty creates labia where once there were none.|$|E
25|$|Hormone {{replacement}} therapy (HRT) of the female-to-male (FTM) type {{is a form}} of hormone therapy and sex reassignment therapy that is used to change the secondary sexual characteristics of transgender and transsexual people from feminine (or androgynous) to masculine. It is one of two types of HRT for transgender and transsexual people (the other being <b>male-to-female),</b> and is predominantly used to treat transgender men. Some intersex people also receive this form of HRT, either starting in childhood to confirm the assigned sex or later if the assignment proves to be incorrect.|$|E
25|$|The Supreme Court of South Korea {{has ruled}} {{that in order for}} a person to be {{eligible}} for a sex-change operation they must be over 20 years of age, single and without children. In the case of MTF (<b>Male-to-Female)</b> gender reassignment operations, the person must prove issues related to draft resolved by either serving or being exempted. On 22 June 2006, however the Supreme Court ruled that transgender individuals who had undergone successful sex reassignment surgery have the right to declare themselves in their new sex in all legal documents. This includes the right to request a correction of their gender-on-file in all public and government records such as the census registry. On March 2013, the Seoul Western District Court ruled that five female-to-male transgender individuals can be registed as male without sex reassignment surgery.|$|E
25|$|Burou {{reported}} {{all of his}} vaginoplasty {{patients to}} have been prepared, to have undergone psychiatric care, and hormonal therapy. However, patient Jan Morris wrote that Burou did not bother too much with diagnosis or previous treatment. Burou later confirmed {{that he did not}} ask his patients too many questions, but sought to fulfil their wishes, and that he did restrict his services to <b>male-to-female</b> (MTF) transsexuals with a distinct “feminine” appearance or character. He refused his services to minors even if they had parental consent, because he felt “the operation is definitive and irreversible and one… could not risk making a mistake.” His international patients were often admitted the afternoon they arrived at the clinic, and were prepared for surgery as soon as that evening or the next morning.|$|E
25|$|There are {{a variety}} of factors that make <b>male-to-female</b> anal {{intercourse}} riskier for a female than for a male. For example, besides the risk of HIV transmission being higher for anal intercourse than for vaginal intercourse, the risk of injury to the woman during anal intercourse is significantly higher than the risk of injury to her during vaginal intercourse because of the durability of the vaginal tissues compared to the anal tissues. Additionally, if a man moves from anal intercourse immediately to vaginal intercourse without a condom or without changing it, infections can arise in the vagina (or urinary tract) due to bacteria present within the anus; these infections can also result from switching between vaginal sex and anal sex by the use of fingers or sex toys.|$|E
25|$|Children with {{persistent}} GID {{are characterized}} by more extreme gender dysphoria in childhood than children with desisting gender dysphoria. Some (but not all) gender diverse / gender independent / gender fluid youth will want or need to transition, which may involve social transition (changing dress, name, pronoun), and, for older youth and adolescents, medical transition (hormonal and surgical intervention). Treatment may {{take the form of}} puberty blockers such as Lupron Depot or Leuprolide Acetate, or cross-sex hormones (i.e., administering estrogen to an assigned male at birth or testosterone to an assigned female at birth), or surgery (i.e., mastectomies, salphingo-oophorectomies/hysterectomy, the creation of a neophallus in female-to-male transsexuals, orchiectomies, breast augmentation, facial feminization surgery, the creation of a neovagina in <b>male-to-female</b> transsexuals), with the aim of bringing one’s physical body in line with their felt gender. The ability to transition (socially and medically) are sometimes needed in the treatment of gender dysphoria.|$|E
25|$|In the 1940s, <b>male-to-female</b> sex change {{operations}} were becoming more {{widely available in}} Europe, and Breckinridge expressed many times his desire to undergo the procedure. With the nationwide attention given to Christine Jorgensen's sex change in 1952, Breckinridge became more determined than ever to begin transitioning. In 1954, he announced plans to travel to Denmark and undergo the operation so he could marry his male secretary. Though Breckinridge was by this time a grandparent, his granddaughter supported him in his efforts. Shortly thereafter, a San Francisco judge scuttled his Denmark trip by ordering him into court for failing {{to make good on}} an earlier agreement to pay $8,500 a year to support his elderly, blind mother in England. He then made arrangements with a sex-change surgeon in Mexico, but had a serious car accident while traveling there. He gave up his pursuit of the matter afterwards.|$|E
25|$|As Singaporean {{surgeons}} {{became more}} skilful, some like Prof. S Shan Ratnam were authorised to perform <b>male-to-female</b> sex-reassignment surgery at Kandang Kerbau Hospital from 1971 onwards. However, before hopeful transsexuals-to-be could {{go under the}} knife, they first had to subject themselves to a battery of psychological tests by psychiatrist Prof. Tsoi Wing Foo. Later, the more technically demanding female-to-male variety was also offered there and at Alexandra Hospital, performed by gynaecologists such as Dr. Ilancheran. A Gender Identity Clinic and Gender Reassignment Surgery Clinic were set up at the National University Hospital two decades later. In fact, for thirty years, Singapore {{was one of the}} world leaders in gender-reassignment surgery. Bugis Street and Johore Road started to become populated with a range of genders from transvestites to iatrogenic intersex individuals to fully transformed women. Local hospitals and clinics also attracted transgender clients from other countries in the region, especially Malaysia and Thailand.|$|E
25|$|Historically, {{one reason}} some people {{preferred}} transsexual to transgender {{is that the}} medical community in the 1950s through the 1980s encouraged {{a distinction between the}} terms that would only allow the former access to medical treatment. Other self-identified transsexual people state that those who do not seek sex reassignment surgery (SRS) are fundamentally different from those who do, and that the two have different concerns, but this view is controversial, and others argue that merely having some medical procedures does not have such far-reaching consequences as to put those who have them and those who have not (e.g. because they cannot afford them) into such distinctive categories. Another reason for objecting to the term transsexual is the concern that it implies something to do with sexuality, when it is actually about gender identity. For example, Christine Jorgensen, the first person widely known to have sex reassignment surgery (in this case, <b>male-to-female),</b> rejected transsexual and instead identified herself in newsprint as trans-gender, on this basis.|$|E
25|$|While the SAF was {{concerned}} {{of the safety}} of out gay and trans men living and working with straight servicemen it was also reluctant to exempt them from the compulsory National Service that all Singaporean men had to perform. However, post-operative <b>male-to-female</b> transsexuals were exempted from National Service as the Singapore Government recognised their new gender identity as women. It is unknown if post-operative female-to-male transsexuals perform National Service, though {{it is unlikely that}} many of them exist who have undergone their operation by the time of enlistment, around the age of 18. In any case, most homosexuals did (and do) not declare their sexual orientation during this examination and go on to serve in all variety of vocations. Gay men do not come out for many reasons, the most common being that they are not comfortable with declaring their sexuality to a State and organisation that is perceived to be homophobic. Some gay men also refrain from coming out as they wish to perform their duties alongside others, and find the segregation of homosexuals offensive.|$|E
25|$|A few {{species of}} goby, such as blackeye goby and Lythrypnus dalli, can change their sexes. Sex change is {{possible}} in these gobies, since the external genitalia {{for males and females}} do not differ much. Sex changes can take from days to weeks. Most sex changes in gobies are from female to male (protogyny) rather than male to female (protandry). Female-to-male changes are observed not only in gobies but also in wrasses, damselfishes, and sea basses. Female-to-male change usually occurs because the resident male of the group is dead. If there is no male in the group, reproduction will be impossible. Therefore, the dominant female turns into male, allowing mating to happen. <b>Male-to-female</b> change occurs when the females have preference for specific features in males. For example, female gobies prefer large males, and a few large males mate with multiple females, whereas small males lose their chance to mate. Small males either choose to become sneakers (kleptogamy) or choose to transform into females because all females technically have high mating opportunities. By turning into females, males can ensure that they produce many descendants.|$|E
25|$|Most Telugu Christians are Protestant {{belonging}} to major Indian Protestant denominations {{such as the}} predominant Anglican Church of South India, the Andhra Evangelical Lutheran Church, the Samavesam of Telugu Baptist Churches Bible Mission the Salvation Army and several others. There also is {{a significant number of}} Roman Catholics and Evangelicals. Although the Franciscans of the Roman Catholic Church brought Christianity to the Deccan area in 1535, it is only after 1759 AD, when the Northern Circars came under the rule of the East India Company, that the region opened up to greater Christian influence. The first Protestant missionaries in Andhra Pradesh were Rev. Cran and Rev. Des Granges who were sent out by the London Missionary Society. They set up their station at Visakhapatnam in 1805 AD.Regions with significant populations of Telugu Christians include the erstwhile Northern Circars, the coastal belt and the cities of Hyderabad and Secunderabad. The Church in Andhra Pradesh runs thousands of educational institutions and hospitals contributing significantly {{to the development of the}} state. Telugu Christians are found in all walks of life and have contributed much to the development of the state. Telugu Christians have one of the highest literacy, work participation figures and most even <b>male-to-female</b> ratio figures among the various religious communities in the state.|$|E
25|$|In {{spite of}} the {{induction}} of breast development, transwomen who undergo HRT {{do not have an}} increased risk of breast cancer, as cissexual women do. Only a handful of cases of breast cancer have ever been described in transsexual women who have undergone <b>male-to-female</b> HRT. This is in accordance with research in cissexual men in which gynecomastia has been found not to be associated with an increased risk of breast cancer, suggesting a protective role of the male sex-determination chromosome. On the other hand, men with Klinefelter's syndrome (two X chromosomes and one Y chromosome), which causes hypoandrogenism, hyperestrogenism, and a very high incidence of gynecomastia (80%), have a dramatically (20- to 58-fold) increased risk of breast cancer compared to men with one X chromosome, closer to the rate of homogametic females. The incidences of breast cancer in karyotypical men (46,XY karyotype), men with Klinefelter's syndrome (47,XXY karyotype), and karyotypical women (46,XX karyotype) are approximately 0.1%, 3%, and 12.5%, respectively. Individuals with the 46,XY karyotype affected by complete androgen insensitivity syndrome never develop male sex characteristics and have normal and complete female morphology, and accelerated breast growth during puberty, but appear to have little (or possibly even no) incidence of breast cancer. The risk of breast cancer in women with Turner syndrome (45,XO karyotype) also appears to be significantly decreased, though this may be related to ovarian failure/hypogonadism rather necessarily than to genetics.|$|E
500|$|With {{regard to}} {{unprotected}} heterosexual contacts, {{estimates of the}} risk of HIV transmission per sexual act appear to be four to ten times higher in low-income countries than in high-income countries. In low-income countries, the risk of female-to-male transmission is estimated as 0.38% per act, and of <b>male-to-female</b> transmission as 0.30% per act; the equivalent estimates for high-income countries are 0.04% per act for female-to-male transmission, and 0.08% per act for <b>male-to-female</b> transmission. The risk of transmission from anal intercourse is especially high, estimated as 1.41.7% per act in both heterosexual and homosexual contacts. While the risk of transmission from oral sex is relatively low, it is still present. The risk from receiving oral sex has been described as [...] "nearly nil"; however, a few cases have been reported. The per-act risk is estimated at 00.04% for receptive oral intercourse. In settings involving prostitution in low income countries, risk of female-to-male transmission has been estimated as 2.4% per act and <b>male-to-female</b> transmission as 0.05% per act.|$|E
500|$|It is {{no secret}} that cardistry, like magic generally, is {{populated}} mainly by males. [...] Some have observed that the split is roughly 9 to 1, <b>male-to-female.</b> The reasons and remedies, if any, are subject to dispute.|$|E
500|$|The {{average age}} at onset is 50; cases have {{reported}} in people between 15 and 90 years old. Men are affected more commonly than women, with a <b>male-to-female</b> ratio of 1.6.
