5|$|Traffic was {{originally}} {{going to be}} distributed by 20th Century Fox, but it was put into turnaround unless actor Harrison Ford agreed to star. Soderbergh began shopping the film to other studios, but when Ford suddenly showed interest in Traffic, Fox's interest in the film was renewed, and the studio took it out of turnaround. Fox CEO Bill Mechanic championed the film, but he departed from the studio {{by the time the}} first draft was finished. It went back into turnaround. Mechanic had also wanted to <b>make</b> <b>some</b> <b>changes</b> to the script, but Soderbergh disagreed and decided to shop the film to other major studios. They all turned him down because they were not confident in the prospects of a three-hour film about drugs, according to Gaghan. USA Films, however, had wanted to take on the movie from the first time Soderbergh approached them. They provided the filmmakers with a $46 million budget, a considerable increase from the $25 million which Fox offered.|$|E
5|$|In the {{interest}} of time (the striking of the new coin was to begin in January 1964), Roberts modified the existing bust of Kennedy he had created for use on the Kennedy medal in the Mint's Presidential series, while Frank Gasparro began modifications to the reverse he had created for the same medal. Both Roberts' and Gasparro's designs had been approved by Kennedy. Roberts had met with Kennedy in person to show him early models of the design; although the President expressed no opinion regarding the depiction, Roberts decided to <b>make</b> <b>some</b> <b>changes</b> after meeting him. After the Mint produced trial strikes, Jacqueline and Robert Kennedy were invited to view them. Mrs. Kennedy viewed the designs favorably, but suggested that the hair be altered slightly. It was also suggested that a full or half figure of the president be used instead of the profile, but Roberts noted {{that there was not}} enough time to produce an entirely new design because of the project's time constraints, and also that he believed the left profile would give a more attractive appearance.|$|E

500|$|The {{writer of}} Kitchen Princess, Miyuki Kobayashi, is a novelist {{published}} under Kodansha's X Bunko Teen Heart label. When deciding on a story, she first creates the names, then the plot: Najika's name—meaning [...] "seven", [...] "rainbow" [...] and [...] "fragrance"—was {{designed to be}} [...] "ethnically ambiguous" [...] and carry a sense of nature, while Daichi and Sora's names, meaning [...] "earth" [...] and [...] "sky" [...] respectively, were meant [...] "to match hers". Akane's name, which means [...] "deep red," [...] was intended to evoke the evening sun for the reader. Kitchen Princess {{marked the first time}} that manga artist Natsumi Ando illustrated a manga that was not also written by her. Despite this, she did <b>make</b> <b>some</b> <b>changes</b> to the original script; she suggested to Kobayashi that Hagio, the head of the orphanage, be an elderly woman and Fujita, initially an elderly woman, a [...] "rugged man".

A spokeswoman for EastEnders claimed that {{although some of the}} baby-swap scenes had been edited in response to reaction from viewers, none had been removed: [...] "Given the audience response to this storyline, we felt on this occasion that it was appropriate to respond and <b>make</b> <b>some</b> <b>changes.</b> The vast majority of material remains intact and we don't believe that those trims we have made will weaken or detract from the overall storyline for viewers".

[...] Babbington, who played Jodie, revealed in May 2011 that Bright was to reprise her role. Bright made her return on 30 June 2011.|$|E
500|$|In January 2012, as {{the game}} has surpassed 450,000 units sold, McMillen stated that he was {{approached}} by a publisher that had interest in bringing the title to the Nintendo 3DS as a downloadable title through the Nintendo eShop, though McMillen had reservations given Nintendo's reputation for less risque content. In late February, McMillen stated that Nintendo had rejected the game because of [...] "questionable religious content". He believed this stemmed from Germany's classification board rating the existing Windows version of the game as [...] "age 16+" [...] due to potentially blasphemous content, the first such time a game was rated in that manner in the country. McMillen noted that Nintendo executives he spoke to before this decision had noted some blasphemous content would have been acceptable, and were more concerned with overtly religious content. He also noted that he was approached about his willingness to <b>make</b> <b>some</b> <b>changes</b> to the game {{to make it more}} suitable for the 3DS, but never was given a list of specific changes. McMillen speculated that Nintendo was worried about its reputation; because of the game's resemblance to The Legend of Zelda, an unknowing child could potentially have downloaded the title and been shocked by the content, which would have reflected poorly on Nintendo.|$|E

Upon hearing each track, Nomura would <b>make</b> <b>some</b> <b>changes,</b> {{and have the}} composers re-record the piece. The end theme, [...] "Calling", was written and performed by former Boøwy vocalist Kyosuke Himuro. The soundtrack includes both pieces original to the film and arrangements of works from Final Fantasy VII, originally composed by Uematsu. Some of the arrangements, including [...] "Advent: One-Winged Angel", are performed by The Black Mages, a rock band formed by Uematsu, Fukui, and Sekito. Both the pieces original to the film and the film arrangements cover a variety of musical styles, including orchestral, choral, classical piano, and rock music; Variety noted that the styles vary between [...] "sparse piano noodlings, pop metal thrashings and cloying power ballads". The 2005 soundtrack album Final Fantasy VII Advent Children Original Soundtrack collects 26 tracks of music from the film on two discs. It was published by Square Enix on September 28, 2005. In addition to the regular release, a limited edition was produced containing alternative cover art and a booklet of credits and lyrics. The soundtrack album reached position #15 on the Japanese Oricon music charts, and stayed on the charts for 10 weeks.|$|E
500|$|Since around 1968, Presley {{wanted to}} <b>make</b> <b>some</b> <b>changes</b> and hoped to do a world tour, he remarked: [...] "Before too long I'm {{going to make}} some {{personal}} appearance tours. I'll probably start out here in this country and after that, play some concerts abroad, probably starting in Europe. I want to see some places I've never seen before. I miss the personal contact with audiences." [...] However, throughout his entire career, Presley performed in only three venues outside the United States—all of them in Canada (Toronto, Ottawa, and Vancouver), during brief tours there in 1957. Rumors that he would play overseas for the first time were fueled in 1974 by a million-dollar bid for an Australian tour. Parker was uncharacteristically reluctant, prompting those close to Presley to speculate about the manager's past and the reasons for his apparent unwillingness to apply for a passport. The real reason why Presley never toured abroad was probably because Parker feared that if he left the U.S., they would not let him back in again as it was later revealed that Parker was an illegal immigrant born Andreas Cornelis van Kuijk in the Netherlands who left to go to the U.S. at the age of 29. Parker ultimately squelched any notions Presley had of working abroad, claiming that foreign security was poor and the venues unsuitable for a star of his magnitude.|$|E

He saw this as the game's largest improvement upon previous Ace Attorney titles, which he said relied on trial and error; he had considered this the weakest point in the series, and something that needed to be changed. On the other hand, Walker said that the player often can figure out what a contradiction is going to be before the game lets them prove it, and the player might come up with legitimate ideas that the game does not accept. He also wished that the life bar could be filled up in court. Cole criticized how relevant evidence sometimes is not accepted, and how testimony statements sometimes need to be pressed in a certain order, but appreciated the game's larger focus on courtroom sessions over investigations. Thomas and the reviewers at Famitsu criticized the lack of new gameplay features, although the former thought that fans of the series would be fine with it. Scott acknowledged that the gameplay only is what is expected from the series, but did not find a problem with it due to the focus on narrative over gameplay.

He told the idea to Lacusta, who wrote a draft that they then revised together. They presented their script to Al Jean when he and Mike Reiss were show runners on The Simpsons. Though Jean liked the story, he turned it down because the staff was already working on a similar episode where Homer gives up beer—"Duffless" [...] (1993).
