5|$|As part of Sabah area, Kota Kinabalu {{features}} a typical equatorial climate with constant temperature, {{considerable amount of}} rain and high humidity. Two prevailing monsoons characterise the climate {{of this part of}} Sabah are the Northeast <b>Monsoon</b> and the Southwest <b>Monsoon.</b> The Northeast <b>Monsoon</b> occurs between November and March, while the Southwest <b>Monsoon</b> occurs between May and September. There are also two successive inter-monsoons from April to May and from September to October.|$|E
5|$|From October to December each year, a {{very large}} area of south India, {{including}} Tamil Nadu, the coastal regions of Andhra Pradesh and the union territory of Puducherry, receives up to 60 percent of its annual rainfall from the northeast <b>monsoon</b> (or winter <b>monsoon).</b> The northeast <b>monsoon</b> {{is the result of}} the annual gradual retreat of monsoonal rains from northeastern India. Unlike during the regular <b>monsoon,</b> rainfall during the northeast <b>monsoon</b> is sporadic, but typically far exceeds the amount produced by the regular <b>monsoon</b> by up to 90 percent. This excessive rainfall can be exacerbated by an El Nino year, which 2015 was.|$|E
5|$|<b>Monsoon</b> or rainy season, lasting from July to September. The {{season is}} {{dominated}} by the humid southwest summer <b>monsoon,</b> which slowly sweeps across the country beginning in late May or early June. <b>Monsoon</b> rains begin to recede from North India at the beginning of October. South India typically receives more rainfall.|$|E

5|$|A <b>monsoon</b> is a {{seasonal}} prevailing wind which lasts for several months, ushering in a region's rainy season. Regions within North America, South America, Sub-Saharan Africa, Australia and East Asia are <b>monsoon</b> regimes.|$|E
5|$|The city {{receives}} {{an average of}} 1064mm of rainfall annually, 68% of which falls during the northeast <b>monsoon.</b> Most of the precipitation occurs {{in the form of}} cyclonic storms caused by depressions in the Bay of Bengal during the northeast <b>monsoon.</b> The prevailing wind direction is south-westerly in the morning and south-easterly in the evening.|$|E

5|$|The {{northeast}} <b>monsoon,</b> {{which begins}} in September, lasts through the post-monsoon seasons, and only ends in March. It carries winds {{that have already}} lost their moisture out to the ocean (opposite from the summer <b>monsoon).</b> They cross India diagonally from northeast to southwest. However, the large indentation made by the Bay of Bengal into India's eastern coast means that the flows are humidified before reaching Cape Comorin and rest of Tamil Nadu, meaning that the state, and also some parts of Kerala, experience significant precipitation in the post-monsoon and winter periods. However, parts of West Bengal, Orissa, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and Mumbai also receive minor precipitation from the north-east <b>monsoon.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{southwest}} <b>monsoon</b> {{arrives in}} two branches: the Bay of Bengal branch and the Arabian Sea branch. The latter extends towards a low-pressure area over the Thar Desert and is roughly three times {{stronger than the}} Bay of Bengal branch. The <b>monsoon</b> typically breaks over Indian territory by around 25 May, when it lashes the Andaman and Nicobar Islands in the Bay of Bengal. It strikes the Indian mainland around 1 June near the Malabar Coast of Kerala. By 9 June, it reaches Mumbai; it appears over Delhi by 29 June. The Bay of Bengal branch, which initially tracks the Coromandal Coast northeast from Cape Comorin to Orissa, swerves to the northwest towards the Indo-Gangetic Plain. The Arabian Sea branch moves northeast towards the Himalayas. By {{the first week of}} July, the entire country experiences <b>monsoon</b> rain; on average, South India receives more rainfall than North India. However, Northeast India receives the most precipitation. <b>Monsoon</b> clouds begin retreating from North India by the end of August; it withdraws from Mumbai by 5 October. As India further cools during September, the southwest <b>monsoon</b> weakens. By the end of November, it has left the country.|$|E
5|$|The south–west <b>Monsoon</b> from June to September {{accounts}} {{for most of}} the rainfall in the region. The Arabian Sea branch of the south-west <b>monsoon</b> hits the Western Ghats along the coastal state of Kerala and moves northwards along the Konkan coast with precipitation on coastal areas, west of the Western Ghats. The lofty Western Ghats prevent the winds from reaching the Deccan Plateau - hence the leeward region (the region that deprived of winds) receives very little rainfall. The Bay of Bengal branch of south-west <b>monsoon</b> heads toward north east India, picking up moisture from the Bay of Bengal. The Coramandel coast does not receive much rainfall from the south-west <b>monsoon</b> due to the shape of the land. Tamil Nadu and southeast Andhra Pradesh receive rains from the north–east <b>Monsoon.</b> The north-east <b>monsoon</b> take place from November to early March when the surface high-pressure system is strongest. The North Indian Ocean tropical cyclones occur throughout the year in Bay of Bengal and Arabian sea bringing devastating winds and heavy rainfall.|$|E
50|$|The {{peninsula}} lies {{in tropical}} South China. The region {{is under the}} influence of continental northeastern <b>monsoons</b> and maritime southeastern and southwestern <b>monsoons.</b> Typhoons occasionally occur, both from the Pacific Ocean and the South China Sea. Annual precipitation is 1400-1700mm.|$|R

40|$|It is {{well known}} that {{agricultural}} operations on land, food production especially in India, depend on {{the success or failure of}} the <b>monsoons.</b> Russel and Yonge (1947) while discussing seasonal cycle of plankton organisms in the tropical areas, state that "there are dry and rainy periods, the <b>monsoons,</b> and weather conditions that alternate with unfailing regularity during the year and it is more than probable that these secular changes may have their effect upon life in the sea". The effect of the <b>monsoons</b> has also been pointed out by Kow (1953) for the Malay region. In this brief account, it is proposed to show what are the effects of the <b>monsoons</b> on life in the sea and how they influence production therein...|$|R
5|$|Uttar Pradesh has a humid {{subtropical}} climate and experiences four seasons. The winter in January and February {{is followed by}} summer between March and May and the <b>monsoon</b> season between June and September. Summers are extreme with temperatures fluctuating anywhere between 0°C and 50°C {{in parts of the}} state. The Gangetic plain varies from semiarid to sub-humid. The mean annual rainfall ranges from 650mm in the southwest corner of the state to 1000mm in the eastern and southeastern parts of the state. Primarily a summer phenomenon, the Bay of Bengal branch of the Indian <b>monsoon</b> is the major bearer of rain in most parts of state. It is the south-west <b>monsoon</b> which brings most of the rain here, although rain due to the western disturbances and north-east <b>monsoon</b> also contribute small quantities towards the overall precipitation of the state.|$|E
5|$|Westerly <b>monsoon</b> winds lie in its equatorward portion while easterly {{trade winds}} exist poleward of the trough. Right along its axis, heavy rains {{can be found}} which usher in the peak of a location's {{respective}} rainy season. As it passes poleward of a location, hot and dry conditions develop. The <b>monsoon</b> trough {{plays a role in}} creating many of the world's rainforests.|$|E

50|$|<b>Monsoons</b> are {{large-scale}} sea breezes which {{occur when}} the temperature on land is significantly warmer or cooler than {{the temperature of the}} ocean. Most summer <b>monsoons</b> have a dominant westerly component and a strong tendency to ascend and produce copious amounts of rain (because of the condensation of water vapor in the rising air). The intensity and duration, however, are not uniform from year to year. Winter <b>monsoons,</b> by contrast, have a dominant easterly component and a strong tendency to diverge, subside and cause drought.|$|R

5|$|Although Chan-hom did not {{directly}} affect the Philippines, both Chan-hom and Tropical Storm Linfa enhanced the <b>monsoon</b> for several days, which caused severe flooding throughout the country. Heavy rains impacted portions of Luzon and the Western Visayas, with various events resulting in five deaths. Four people also went missing when their boat sank amid strong winds {{off the coast of}} Pangasinan. A brief tornado caused minor damage in Iba, Zambales. Nearly 34,000people were affected by the <b>monsoon</b> event, which killed 16people and caused ₱3.9million (US$86,500) in agricultural losses.|$|E
5|$|As Rammasun {{moved away}} from the Philippines, it {{enhanced}} the <b>monsoon</b> and produced rainfall and flooding. Several landslides were reported, and more than 3,000people had to evacuate. Subsequent storms also enhanced the <b>monsoon,</b> and combined with the effects from Typhoon Chataan, Severe Tropical Storm Nakri, and Typhoon Halong, there were 85deaths, with 45people injured in the Philippines. The combined damage in the country totaled $10.3million (₱522million 2002PHP).|$|E
5|$|During 31 January the Australian Bureau of Meteorology {{started to}} monitor a {{tropical}} low, that had developed within the <b>monsoon</b> trough over the western Cape York Peninsula. Over {{the next day}} the system moved into the southeastern part of the Gulf of Carpentaria, before it moved back over the Cape York Peninsula during 2 February. The system subsequently emerged into the Coral Sea to the north of Cairns later that day, where a strong northwest <b>monsoon</b> flow with gales developed {{to the north of the}} low. The system subsequently moved eastwards and intensified into a category 1 tropical cyclone on the Australian tropical cyclone intensity scale.|$|E

5|$|In {{areas where}} the heavy {{rainfall}} {{is associated with a}} wind shift, the wet season is known as the <b>monsoon.</b> Rainfall in the wet season is mainly due to daytime heating which leads to diurnal thunderstorm activity within a pre-existing moist airmass, so the rain mainly falls in late afternoon and early evening in savannah and <b>monsoon</b> regions. Further, much of the total rainfall each day occurs in the first minutes of the downpour, before the storms mature into their stratiform stage. Most places have only one wet season, but areas of the tropics can have two wet seasons, because the <b>monsoon</b> trough, or Intertropical Convergence Zone, can pass over locations in the tropics twice per year. However, since rain forests have rainfall spread evenly through the year, {{they do not have a}} wet season.|$|E
5|$|In late July, a <b>monsoon</b> {{depression}} {{moved across}} much of India, and another <b>monsoon</b> disturbance persisted {{off the coast of}} Pakistan. The interaction between the two systems resulted in heavy rainfall across the region, flooding dozens of villages. Monsoonal rainfall killed 285people between Pakistan and India in the summer of 2003. In late August, another <b>monsoon</b> depression moved across northeastern India. A depression that struck Andhra Pradesh in India killed 21people in early October. Later that month, a tropical depression crossed Thailand from the western Pacific Ocean, contributing to ongoing flooding that killed 19. Once in the Indian Ocean, this system struck southeastern India without causing much damage. The last system of the year was a cyclonic storm that struck southeastern India in December, killing 81people and causing $28million in damage (2003USD).|$|E
