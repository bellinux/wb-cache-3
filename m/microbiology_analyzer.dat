Methods: Between December 2002 and June 2008, a total of 111 nonduplicate S. aureus isolates were collected from the pus samples of the patients with SSTIs in a teaching hospital in Wenzhou, China.

Multilocus sequence typing (MLST) {{was used to determine}} the sequence types (STs) of the selected isolates. The genotypes of SCCmec were determined by a multiplex PCR in the MRSA isolates. Panton-Valentine leukocidin (PVL) genes and mecA were also determined by another multiplex PCR. Results: Among the 111 S. aureus isolates, 48 and 63 isolates were community-acquired and hospital-acquired respectively. Sixty isolates were confirmed as MRSA harboring mecA detected by PCR.

Panton-Valentine leukocidin (PVL) genes and mec A were also determined by another multiplex PCR. Results Among the 111 S. aureus isolates, 48 and 63 isolates were community-acquired and hospital-acquired respectively. Sixty isolates were confirmed as MRSA harboring mec A detected by PCR. A total of 32 PFGE clonal types were obtained by PFGE, with 10 predominant patterns (types A to J). Twenty-five different STs including ST 398 and three novel STs were found among 51 selected isolates. The main STs were ST 239, ST 1018, ST 59, ST 7 and ST 88. Of 60 MRSA isolates, SCC mec II, III, IV and SCC mec V were found in three, 50, three and two isolates, respectively. The positive rates of PVL genes in overall isolates, HA-isolates, CA-isolates, MRSA isolates and MSSA isolates were 23. 4 % (26 / 111), 20. 6 % (13 / 63), 27. 1 % (13 / 48), 21. 7 % (13 / 60) and 25. 5 % (13 / 51), respectively. Eight (33. 3 %, 8 / 24) of 24 CA-MRSA isolates and 5 (13. 9 %, 5 / 36) of 36 HA-MRSA isolates were positive for PVL genes. ST 239 -MRSA-SCC mec III and ST 1018 -MRSA-SCC mec III clones were found to be main clones and spread between community and hospital. Conclusion S. aureus isolates causing SSTIs showed considerable molecular heterogeneity and harbored high prevalence of PVL genes. Clonal spread was responsible for the dissemination of the isolates of S. aureus associated with SSTIs. </p...|$|E
