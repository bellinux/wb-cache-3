5|$|The active {{constituents}} {{of this species}} are water-soluble, and boiling and then discarding the cooking water at least partly detoxifies A.muscaria. Drying may increase potency, as the process facilitates the conversion of ibotenic acid to the <b>more</b> <b>potent</b> muscimol. According to some sources, once detoxified, the mushroom becomes edible.|$|E

5|$|Like their {{relatives}} in the Elapidae family, {{the majority of the}} Hydrophiinae species are highly venomous; however, when bites occur, venom injection is rare, so envenomation symptoms usually seem nonexistent or trivial. For example, P. platurus has a venom <b>more</b> <b>potent</b> than any terrestrial snake species in Costa Rica based on LD50, but despite its abundance in the waters off its western coast, few human fatalities have been reported. Nevertheless, all sea snakes should be handled with great caution.|$|E
5|$|Rather than {{introducing}} any revolutionary tactical doctrine, crews {{gradually became}} more experienced and increased their effectiveness that way, while specialist training was provided {{when it was}} required.

However, with greater innovations, such as radar, better designed aircraft, and <b>more</b> <b>potent</b> weaponry, the crews built on their experiences and the service became an effective naval air service.|$|E

5|$|To {{make matters}} worse for the government, {{industrial}} unrest was a persisting problem, particularly in the economically key states of New South Wales and Victoria.

5|$|Warfarin {{consists}} of a racemic mixture of two active enantiomers—R- and S- forms—each of which is cleared by different pathways. S-warfarin is 2-5 times <b>more</b> <b>potent</b> than the R-isomer in producing an anticoagulant response. Both the enantiomers of warfarin undergo CYP-mediated metabolism by many different CYPs to form 3',4',6,7,8 and 10-hydroxy warfarin metabolites, major being 7-OH warfarin formed from S-warfarin by CYP2C9 and 10-OH warfarin from R-warfarin by CYP3A4.|$|E

5|$|Xenon has {{a minimum}} {{alveolar}} concentration (MAC) of 72% at age 40, making it 44% <b>more</b> <b>potent</b> than N2O as an anesthetic. Thus, {{it can be}} used with oxygen in concentrations that have a lower risk of hypoxia. Unlike nitrous oxide (N2O), xenon is not a greenhouse gas and is viewed as environmentally friendly. Though recycled in modern systems, xenon vented to the atmosphere is only returning to its original source, without environmental impact.|$|E
5|$|Bupropion is {{also known}} {{to act as a}} non-competitive {{antagonist}} of the α3β2, α3β4, α4β2, and, very weakly, α7 nACh receptors, and these actions appear to be importantly involved in its beneficial properties not only in smoking cessation, but in depression as well. The metabolites of bupropion also act as non-competitive antagonists of these nACh receptors, and hydroxybupropion is even <b>more</b> <b>potent</b> in comparison. At therapeutically-relevant concentrations bupropion and hydroxybupropion act as negative allosteric modulators of the serotonin 5-HT3A receptor. Pharmacological data on bupropion and its metabolites are shown in the table. Bupropion is known to weakly inhibit the α1 adrenergic receptor, with a 14% potency of its dopamine uptake inhibition, and the H1 receptor, with a 9% potency.|$|E

5|$|Joseph Fontenrose wrote Orion : the Myth of the Hunter and the Huntress (1981) to show Orion as {{the type}} {{specimen}} {{of a variety}} of grotesque hero. Fontenrose views him as similar to Cúchulainn, that is, stronger, larger, and <b>more</b> <b>potent</b> than ordinary men and the violent lover of the Divine Huntress; other heroes of the same type are Actaeon, Leucippus (son of Oenomaus), Cephalus, Teiresias, and Zeus as the lover of Callisto. Fontenrose also sees Eastern parallels in the figures of Aqhat, Attis, Dumuzi, Gilgamesh, Dushyanta, and Prajapati (as pursuer of Ushas).|$|E
5|$|Midazolam {{is among}} about 35 benzodiazepines {{currently}} used medically, and was synthesised in 1975 by Walser and Fryer at Hoffmann-LaRoche, Inc in the United States. Owing to its water solubility, {{it was found}} to be less likely to cause thrombophlebitis than similar drugs. The anticonvulsant properties of midazolam were studied in the late 1970s, but not until the 1990s did it emerge as an effective treatment for convulsive status epilepticus. , it is the most commonly used benzodiazepine in anesthetic medicine. In acute medicine, midazolam has become more popular than other benzodiazepines, such as lorazepam and diazepam, because it is shorter lasting, is <b>more</b> <b>potent,</b> and causes less pain at the injection site. Midazolam is also becoming increasingly popular in veterinary medicine due to its water solubility.|$|E
5|$|Prolonged convulsive epileptic {{seizures}} are {{a medical}} emergency that {{can usually be}} dealt with effectively by administering fast-acting benzodiazepines, which are potent anticonvulsants. In a hospital environment, intravenous clonazepam, lorazepam, and diazepam are first-line choices, clonazepam due to its stronger and <b>more</b> <b>potent</b> anticonvulsant action, diazepam due to its faster onset and lorazepam for its longer duration of action. In the community, intravenous administration is not practical and so rectal diazepam or (more recently) buccal midazolam are used, with a preference for midazolam as its administration is easier and more socially acceptable.|$|E

Three distinct approaches to improved MMP inhibition are discussed: (1) the identification and investigation of novel zinc-binding groups (ZBGs), (2) the study of non-zinc-binding MMPi, and (3) mechanism-based MMPi that form covalent adducts with the protein. Each of these strategies is discussed and their respective advantages and remaining challenges are highlighted.

5|$|Some {{noble gases}} have direct {{application}} in medicine. Helium is sometimes {{used to improve}} the ease of breathing of asthma sufferers. Xenon is used as an anesthetic because of its high solubility in lipids, which makes it <b>more</b> <b>potent</b> than the usual nitrous oxide, {{and because it is}} readily eliminated from the body, resulting in faster recovery. Xenon finds application in medical imaging of the lungs through hyperpolarized MRI. Radon, which is highly radioactive and is only available in minute amounts, is used in radiotherapy.|$|E
5|$|The French {{artillery}} {{concealed in}} wooded areas proved <b>more</b> <b>potent</b> than the tanks. The German 1st Panzer Company was {{wiped out by}} French artillery, and pulled back with just one battleworthy tank. The Company retreated {{under the cover of}} part of the ridge, and moved its single tank back and forth, simulating the presence of many German tanks. Diverted from their success at Gaulier, near Sedan, the 2nd Panzer Company was rushed to the spot and managed to delay the French armoured advance. The Großdeutschland Infantry Regiment's late arrival tilted the scales. They managed to eliminate the anti-tank lines and entrenched French infantry.|$|E
5|$|Amanita muscaria {{was widely}} {{used as an}} entheogen {{by many of the}} {{indigenous}} peoples of Siberia. Its use was known among almost all of the Uralic-speaking peoples of western Siberia and the Paleosiberian-speaking peoples of the Russian Far East. There are only isolated reports of A.muscaria use among the Tungusic and Turkic peoples of central Siberia and it is believed that on the whole entheogenic use of A.muscaria was not practised by these peoples. In western Siberia, the use of A.muscaria was restricted to shamans, who used it as an alternative method of achieving a trance state. (Normally, Siberian shamans achieve trance by prolonged drumming and dancing.) In eastern Siberia, A.muscaria was used by both shamans and laypeople alike, and was used recreationally as well as religiously. In eastern Siberia, the shaman would take the mushrooms, and others would drink his urine. This urine, still containing psychoactive elements, may be <b>more</b> <b>potent</b> than the A.muscaria mushrooms with fewer negative effects such as sweating and twitching, suggesting that the initial user may act as a screening filter for other components in the mushroom.|$|E
