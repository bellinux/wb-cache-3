40|$|A {{lubrication}} {{theory that}} includes the effects of electrokinetics and surface microstructure is developed. A porous layer attached to the impermeable substrate is used to model the microstructure on a bearing surface. The Brinkman-extended Darcy equations and Stokes equations are modified by considering the electrical body force and utilized to model the flow in porous media and fluid film, respectively. The stress jump boundary conditions on the porous media/fluid film interface {{and the effects of}} viscous shear and electric double layer (EDL) are also considered when deriving the modified Reynolds equation. Under the usual assumptions of lubrication and Debye–Hückel approximation for low surface potential, the velocity distributions, the apparent viscosity, and the modified Reynolds equation are then derived. The apparent viscosity is expressed explicitly as functions of the Debye length, the electroviscosity, the charge density, the stress jump parameter, and the porous parameters (permeability, porosity, and porous film thickness). The consider-ations of EDL near the interface and the charge density of the flow in the porous media increase the apparent viscosity. The existence of porous film also increases the apparent viscosity as well. Both effects are important for flow within <b>microspacing</b> and lubrication problems. The apparent viscosity and the performance of 1 D slider bearings are analyzed and discussed. The results show that the apparent viscosity and the load capacity in-crease as the permeability decreases, the stress jump parameter decreases, the charge density increases, the inverse Debye length decreases, or the porosity decreases.

40|$|We have {{developed}} a general scenario of prebiotic physicochemical evolution during the Earth's Hadean eon and reviewed the relevant literature. We suggest that prebiotic chemical evolution started in <b>microspaces</b> with membranous walls, where external temperature and osmotic gradients were coupled to free-energy gradients of potential chemical reactions. The key feature of this scenario is the onset of an emergent evolutionary transition within the <b>microspaces</b> that is described by the model of complex vectorial chemistry. This transition occurs at average macromolecular crowding of 20 to 30 % of the cell volume, when the ranges of action of stabilizing colloidal forces (screened electrostatic forces, hydration, and excluded volume forces) become commensurate. Under these conditions, the macromolecules divide the interior of <b>microspaces</b> into dynamically crowded macromolecular regions and topologically complementary electrolyte pools. Small ions and ionic metabolites are transported vectorially between the electrolyte pools and through the (semiconducting) electrolyte pathways of the crowded macromolecular regions from their high electrochemical potential (where they are biochemically produced) to their lower electrochemical potential (where they are consumed). We suggest a sequence of tentative transitions between major evolutionary periods during the Hadean eon as follows: (i) the early water world, (ii) the appearance of land masses, (iii) the pre-RNA world, (iv) the onset of complex vectorial chemistry, and (v) the RNA world and evolution toward Darwinian thresholds.

Focusing on the <b>microspaces</b> of public consultations and advisory panels, it argues that the construction of this statistical object was simultaneously the construction of a knowledge-object for academics and of a policy-object for policy-makers. As such, the statistic drew on and fed into domestic and international networks of statistical, academic and policy usage. The programme was shaped by the needs of these multiple networks, creating an object that they could hold in common but which did not necessarily fully satisfy any of them. Understanding the creation of objects in this way extends understandings around policy transfers and mobilities by showing how policy-objects arise through the transfer and mobility of things which are not policy. Simultaneously, what arises from policy mobility is not simply policy. Instead, what arises is multiple objects, which are the product of the intersection of travelling policy, knowledge and practice and they feed back into existing networks of knowledge, policy and practice. In doing so, the paper shows the inter-relations of knowledge and practice with policy, revealing them to be situated in place, contingent and compromised.

The quantum field equation has also been derived for the bispinor field of a free lepton in this Finslerian <b>microspace</b> through its quantum generalization below a fundamental length-scale. The bispinor can be decomposed as a direct product of two spinsors, one depending on the position coordinates {{and the other on}} the directional arguments of the Finsler space. The former one represents the spinor of the macrospace, an associated Riemannian space-time of the Finsler space, and satisfies the Dirac equation. The directional variable-dependent spinor satisfies a different equation which is solved here. This spinor-part of the bispinor field for a constituent of the hadron can give rise to an additional quantum number for generating the internal symmetry of hadrons.

Although, this part of the particle-mass has no appreciable contribution in the present era it was very significant for the very early period of the universe after its creation.

40|$|A novel {{flexible}} sensor {{was developed for}} the noninvasive oxygen metabolism measurement of cultivated cells and tissues. This device is composed of a transparent double-layered polymer sheet of ethylene-vinyl alcohol (EVOH) and poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) having an array of microhole structures of 90 μm diameter and 50 μm depth on its surface. All the microhole structures were equipped with a 1 -μm-thick optical chemical sensing layer of platinum porphyrin-fluoropolymer on their bottom. The three-dimensional microstructures of the sensor were fabricated by a newly developed simple and low-cost production method named self-aligned hot embossing. The device {{was designed to be}} attached slightly above the cells cultivated on a dish to form a temporarily closed <b>microspace</b> over the target cells during measurement. Since the change in oxygen concentration is relatively fast in the microcompartmentalized culture medium, a rapid evaluation of the oxygen consumption rate is possible by measuring the phosphorescence lifetime of the platinum porphyrin-fluoropolymer. The combined use of the device and an automated optical measurement system enabled the high-throughput sensing of cellular oxygen consumption (100 points/min). We monitored the oxygen metabolism of the human breast cancer cell line MCF 7 on a Petri dish and evaluated the oxygen consumption rate to be 0. 72 ± 0. 12 fmol/min/cell. Furthermore, to demonstrate the utility of the developed sensing system, we demonstrated the mapping of the oxygen consumption rate of rat brain slices and succeeded in visualizing a clear difference among the layer structures of the hippocampus, i. e., the cornu ammonis (CA 1 and CA 3) and dentate gyrus (DG) ...|$|R
