5|$|Kimlinger of Anime News Network {{said that}} while Naruto's initial fight scenes are lacking {{conviction}} when compared to others, his encounter with Gaara {{is one of his}} best moments because its tactics surpassed most shōnen stereotypes. ANN's Theron Martin and Mania Entertainment's Justin Rich made similar comments. The character's final fight against Sasuke at the end of Part I attracted similar responses, due to the fighting styles employed, and the character development resulting from their rivalry. The enormous physical changes caused by the Nine-Tailed Demon Fox have also been the focus of critics, as Naruto's loss of control causes him to become a bigger threat to his loved ones than other series' antagonists. Carlo Santos of ANN commented on the character's growth in Part II, specifically his fight against Pain in which Naruto's comments on peace, and the means by which it is achieved, touch on philosophical themes never seen in a shōnen series. Chris Beveridge of Mania Entertainment noted a change in Naruto's attitude as he acts calmly and <b>more</b> <b>seriously</b> <b>than</b> in previous story arcs. Naruto's new Senjutsu style was praised, as was his careful preparation for the fight against Pain, which resulted in a detailed display of his skills. Allega Frank from Polygon noted that during the start of both the manga and anime Boruto: Naruto Next Generations, multiple fans were worried in regards to a flashforward; in this sequence an older Boruto is facing an enemy named Kawaki who implies Naruto might be dead so his fate left them worried. Singer Diana Garnet expressed her pleasure at recording one of the ending theme songs for the animated series of Naruto Shippuden stating that not only she has been a fan of the series ever since she was younger, but was also motivated by Naruto's character because of his determination not to give up no matter what challenge he faced.|$|E

25|$|Skolt Sami {{is spoken}} by {{approximately}} 400 {{people by the}} government {{as one of the}} official Sami languages used in Lapland and can thus be used by anyone conducting official business in that area. It is an official language in the municipality of Inari, and elementary schools there offer courses in the language, both for native speakers and for students learning it as a foreign language. Only a small number of youths do learn the language and continue to use it actively. Skolt Sami is thus a seriously endangered language, even <b>more</b> <b>seriously</b> <b>than</b> Inari Sami in the same municipality, which has a nearly equal number of speakers.|$|E

He was promoted to Vice Admiral on 29 January 1938 on becoming Commander, Aircraft, Battle Force – at the time {{one of only three}} vice admiral billets in the US Navy. Among his accomplishments was to corroborate Admiral Harry E.

Diane takes the {{relationship}} <b>more</b> <b>seriously</b> <b>than</b> Paul, {{and she is}} devastated when he finishes with her to begin a fling with hairdreser Julie Cooper (Louise Plowright). Paul and Julie do not last, and he immediately returns to Diane. Scorned, Diane cannot forgive Julie for taking Paul, and she plays various vengeful tricks on her as payback, such as sabotaging her salon's opening day and sending her a male escort to make her look desperate. Julie responds by flirting with Paul to infuriate Diane further, and their feud culminates in a showdown in The Queen Vic one night, at which Julie humiliates Diane. Paul quickly loses interest in Diane. Ignoring his reticence, Diane convinces herself that Paul is contemplating proposing marriage to her, so she is broken-hearted when he returns to his hometown in Leeds in December 1989; he leaves without saying goodbye.|$|E
25|$|Current {{predictions}} {{based on}} the International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report 2007 say that Climate Change might impact the countries closer to the equator <b>more</b> <b>seriously</b> <b>than</b> the countries located more in the North or South. Tropical Vietnam {{is assumed to be}} one of the most vulnerable countries in connection with Climate Change. The medium emission level scenario for 2080-2099 predicts a higher annual rainfall which occurs in the already wet months of the year. At the same time, the dry months might become even hotter due to temperature rise and the stress on the crops might increase due to higher evaporation rates and less available water. Like the current climate differs both in time and in space, also the changing climate is predicted to affect rather the North than the South and it might influence rather the winter than the summer months. Beneath rising temperatures and changing precipitation patterns, sea level rise is predicted to affect Vietnam as a country with a coastal line of more than 3,000km especially. The loss of land and soils due to flooding and inundation might lead to a loss of 5% of the total land seriously affecting agriculture, industry, human and natural environment. Salt water intrusion and salinisation of soils and irrigation water (either groundwater or surface water of other water bodies) are predicted to cause serious problems in connection with sea level rise as well.|$|E

500|$|By {{the end of}} {{the thirteenth}} century, several {{offences}} against either one's lord, or one's king, were treasonable. [...] High treason, defined as transgressions against the sovereign, was first codified during King Edward III's reign by the Treason Act 1351. [...] It clarified exactly what crimes constituted treason, following earlier, somewhat [...] "over zealous" [...] interpretations of England's legal codes. [...] For instance, high treason could be committed by anyone found to be compassing the king's death or counterfeiting his coin. [...] High treason remained distinct though, from what became known as petty treason: the killing of a lawful superior, such as a husband by his wife. [...] Though twelfth century contemporary authors made few attempts to differentiate between high treason and petty treason, enhanced punishments may indicate that the latter was treated <b>more</b> <b>seriously</b> <b>than</b> an ordinary felony.|$|E

They realised that the demography of the city had changed within a decade. That is when they {{decided it was time to}} please the North Indians. Uddhav started organising Uttar Bharatiya functions.

500|$|AllMusic writer Stephen Thomas Erlewine {{said that}} their album, Significant Other, {{contains}} [...] "flourishes of neo-psychedelia on pummeling metal numbers" [...] and [...] "swirls of strings, even crooning, at the most unexpected background". The band did not employ solos until Gold Cobra (except for the song [...] "Underneath The Gun" [...] out of Results May Vary), however, during the recording of Significant Other, drummer John Otto performed an extended solo {{in the middle of}} the song [...] "Nobody Like You". Durst's lyrics are often profane, scatological or angry. Much of Durst's lyrical inspiration came from growing up and his personal life. The song [...] "Sour", from the album Three Dollar Bill, Yall, was inspired by Durst's problems with his girlfriend. His breakup with her inspired the Significant Other songs [...] "Nookie" [...] and [...] When describing Limp Bizkit's lyrics, The Michigan Daily said [...] "In a less-serious vein, Limp Bizkit used the nu-metal sound as a way to spin testosterone fueled fantasies into snarky white-boy rap. Oddly, audiences took frontman Fred Durst <b>more</b> <b>seriously</b> <b>than</b> he wanted, failing to see the intentional silliness in many of his songs." [...] Furthermore, Limp Bizkit's lyrics were described as [...] "misogynistic". The Unquestionable Truth (Part 1) focuses on more serious and darker lyrical subject matter, including Catholic sex abuse cases, terrorism and fame.|$|E

Harry writes that In His Own Write (1964) was published after [...] "Some journalist who was hanging around the Beatles {{came to me and}} I ended up showing him the stuff. They said, 'Write a book' and that's how the first one came about". Like the Daily Howl it contained a mix of formats including short stories, poetry, plays and drawings. One story, [...] "Good Dog Nigel", tells the tale of [...] "a happy dog, urinating on a lamp post, barking, wagging his tail—until he suddenly hears a message that he will be killed at three o'clock". The Times Literary Supplement considered the poems and stories [...] "remarkable... also very funny... the nonsense runs on, words and images prompting one another in a chain of pure fantasy". Book Week reported, [...] "This is nonsense writing, but one has only to review the literature of nonsense to see how well Lennon has brought it off. While some of his homonyms are gratuitous word play, many others have not only double meaning but a double edge." [...] Lennon was not only surprised by the positive reception, but that the book was reviewed at all, and suggested that readers [...] "took the book <b>more</b> <b>seriously</b> <b>than</b> I did myself. It just began as a laugh for me".|$|E

At {{the start of the}} campaign Livingstone took Johnson <b>more</b> <b>seriously</b> <b>than</b> many others were doing, referring to him as [...] "the most formidable opponent I will face in my political career." [...] Much of Labour's campaign revolved around criticising Johnson for perceived racist and homophobic comments that he had made in the past, although Johnson strenuously denied that he was bigoted. Livingstone also proposed that if he were to win a third term he would increase the congestion charge fee to £25 for the most polluting vehicles, while removing it for the least, and that he would also introduce a cycling scheme based on the Vélib' system in Paris. As part of his campaign, Livingstone highlighted that by 2008, the Metropolitan Police had 35,000 officers, 10,000 more than it had had in 2000, also highlighting statistics to indicate falling crime rates across the city during his Mayorship. Nevertheless, there had been a recent rise in gang killing among young people, with 27 teenagers having been killed in gang warfare during 2007, a statistic used by Johnson's campaign who emphasised the idea that a Johnson administration would be far tougher on youth crime and anti-social behaviour.|$|E

She played Helen, a model with whom Bale embarks on a [...] "dalliance". She talked about acting without a script: [...] "It {{is definitely a}} bit nerve-racking {{on the first day}} because you don't know where you are going to go. But once you figure that out, then it doesn't really matter. It is actually very relaxing. It is fun and liberating. It is an experience that I completely embrace". Premiering at the competition section of the 65th Berlin International Film Festival, the film received average to mixed reviews from critics. The film was released in the United States in March 2016. She was among the 100 narrators of Unity (2015), a documentary that explores the relationships between Earth's species. Her third release of that year was the Colombian action film Blunt Force Trauma, in which she starred opposite Ryan Kwanten and Mickey Rourke as a woman looking for her brother's murderer.

30|$|The {{perception}} of newcomer integration strategies {{was correlated with}} participants’ individual characteristics. Firstly, a gender specific pattern appeared, such that male players, who made up {{the majority in the}} examined communities, more strongly perceived the newcomer integration strategies, in particular newcomers’ recruitment, negative welcoming, knowledge assessment, and monitoring. This finding is consistent with previous studies that showed the MMORPG player population as being predominantly male (e.g., Chen et al. 2006; Homer et al. 2012; Zhong 2011), and males taking violent computer games <b>more</b> <b>seriously</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> females did (e.g., Williams et al. 2009). Secondly, younger players perceived the newcomer integration strategies to a greater degree than older players. The identified gender and age correlates may be due to status differences (Zhong 2011), or simply to different perceptions of male vs. female and younger vs. older players. Thirdly, community exposure time displayed relatively strong correlations with players’ sense of community, which suggests that this essential component of community output increases over time. The finding is consistent with the mainstream community research (Eberle et al. 2014; Lave and Wenger 1991; Nistor et al. 2015 c).|$|R
