40|$|In {{view of the}} {{increasing}} importance of carbamic acid esters in insect control, the authors have conducted studies on the inheritance of carbamate-resistance in the housefly Resistance to Isolan (1 -isopropyl- 3 -methyl- 5 -pyrazolyl dimethylcarbamate) in carbamate-selected strains is inherited as a partially dominant major single factor, without sex linkage or appreciable cytoplasmic influence. Inclusion of piperonyl butoxide as a synergist with Sevin (1 -naphthyl methylcarbamate), Zectran (4 -dimethylamino- 3, 5 -xylyl methylcarbamate), or m-isopropylphenyl methylcarbamate also produced evidence of <b>monofactorial</b> <b>inheritance...</b>|$|E
40|$|Anopheles stephensi Liston (Diptera: Culicidae) is {{the urban}} vector of malaria in the Indian subcontinent and several {{countries}} of the Middle East. The genetics of propoxur resistance (pr) in An. stephensi larvae was studied to determine its mode of inheritance. A diagnostic dose of 0. 01 [*]mg/L as recommended by WHO was used to establish homozygous resistant and susceptible strains. Reciprocal crosses between the resistant and susceptible strains showed an F 1 generation of incomplete dominance.

40|$|Inheritance {{of eight}} {{morphological}} characters, namely, prostrate growth habit; narrow, bicompound and simple leaves; purple and light green foliage colours; light blue corolla and green seed coat colour, was studied. AU the traits except the light blue corolla showed <b>monofactorial</b> recessive <b>inheritance,</b> while the light blue corolla involved interaction of two recessive factors. Joint segregations of narrow leaf and double-flowered peduncle and simple leaf and light blue corolla were studied, {{and in both}} cases no linkage was detected...|$|R
40|$|Genetic crosses {{between the}} {{dioecious}} Bryonia dioica Jacq. (Cucurbitaceae) and the monoecious B. alba L. in 1903 provided the first clear evidence for Mendelian inheritance of dioecy and made B. dioica the {{classic case of}} XY sex determination in plants. We use chloroplast (cp) and nuclear (nr) DNA sequences from 129 individuals representing all morphological species to study species relationships and distribution, sexual system evolution, and association of ploidy-level with dioecy in Bryonia. Chloroplast and nuclear trees mostly fit morphological species concepts; there are seven dioecious and three monoecious species, together ranging from the Canary Islands to Central Asia. Bryonia verrucosa, the morphologically most differing species from the Canary Islands is sister to all other species. Our data argue {{for the inclusion of}} the narrowly endemic Central Asian species B. lappifolia and B. melanocarpa in B. monoica. Conflicts between cp and nr topologies imply that the dioecious hexaploid B. cretica arose from hybridization(s) involving the diploid species B. dioica, B. syriaca, and/or B. multiflora. The tetraploid B. marmorata likely originated via autopolyploidy. The nr phylogeny implies at least two transitions between dioecy and monoecy, but no correlation between change in sexual system and ploidy level. Fossil-calibrated molecular clocks using family-wide rbcL data with a Bryonia-centered sampling suggest that the deepest divergence in Bryonia occurred ca. ten million years ago and that monoecious and dioecious species crossed in the classic studies are separated by several million years of evolution. Traits, such as annual regrowth from a tuberous rootstock and other adaptations to a seasonal climate, as well as species and haplotype abundance, point to an origin of Bryonia in the Middle East. Species and haplotype poverty north of the Alps together suggest recolonization there after the last glacial maximum. Most species of Bryonia have 10 chromosomes (as confirmed by my own counts), and {{there appears to be no}} morphologically distinct pair that would represent the sex chromosomes. However, we know from the crossings carried out by Correns and others that in B. dioica, sex shows <b>monofactorial</b> dominant <b>inheritance,</b> setting up the hypothesis that B. dioica may have a pair of chromosomes on which key sex-determining gene(s) and sexlinked genes have accumulated. To gain insight into the possible presence of such a pair of sex chromosomes in B. dioica, it is necessary to sequence a fairly long sex-linked region to study its substitution behavior and to eventually visualize its physical placement using FISH. As a first step towards this goal, I developed a sex-linked SCAR marker for B. dioica from AFLP bands and sequenced it for individuals representing the full distribution range of the species from Scotland to North Africa. The region north of the Alps harbours distinct Y and X alleles that differ in a 197 -bp indel, with the Y allele being perfectly linked to the male sex. In southern Europe, however, the XY system appears to break down (to an extent that is not clear), and there are signs of recombination between the Y and X homologues. Population genetic analyses suggest that the sex-linked region I amplified (i. e., the SCAR marker) experienced different evolutionary pressures in northern and southern Europe. These findings fit the evidence from my phylogenetic and phylogeographic analyses that the XY system in Bryonia is evolutionarily labile. Overall, my work suggests that Bryonia may be a good, but very complex, system in which to study the early steps of plant sex chromosome evolution...|$|R
40|$|Studies on {{the mode}} of {{inheritance}} of insecticide resistance have been making rapid progress {{over the last few}} years and now cover some twenty-two species and about seventy different strains. These studies include not only the inheritance of particular forms of resistance but also the genetical aspects of cross-resistance and biochemical properties causing or related to resistance. The author reviews 27 instances of resistance recently subjected to genetic analysis; all but four were considered to be examples of <b>monofactorial</b> <b>inheritance.</b> The use of genetic markers has made it possible in some instances to map the genes responsible for resistance and has proved useful in the study of the genetic mechanisms involved in cross-resistance and multiple resistance. Correlations have been established between resistance, genetic constitution, and the activity of certain enzymes. Experiments are described illustrating the technique of crossing genetically marked resistant strains with susceptible strains in the study of {{the mode of}} inheritance of resistance to DDT and dieldrin...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Insecticide {{resistance}} to the microbial insecticides Bacillus thuringiensis subsp. israelensis (Bti) and Bacillus sphaericus (Bs) represents {{a serious threat to}} their success. Available evidence indicates that the risk for {{resistance to}} Bti is low due to the makeup of its parasporal crystal, which contains Cyt 1 A, Cry 4 A, Cry 4 B, and Cry 11 A toxic proteins. Disrupting the toxin complex in Bti enables resistance to evolve, especially {{in the absence of the}} key factor, the cytolytic toxin, Cyt 1 A. Cross-resistance is widespread among mosquitocidal Bacillus thuringiensis Cry toxins and the mechanisms of Cry resistance in mosquitoes are not known. Bacillus sphaericus (Bs) is at higher risk for resistance due to its single-site action and field cases have been reported from a number of locations worldwide. Cross-resistance is reported among the various Bs isolates, although some isolates produce additional toxic proteins that can reduce cross-resistance and slow resistance evolution. Field and lab evolved resistant populations consistently show recessive and <b>monofactorial</b> <b>inheritance</b> of resistance. Resistant populations, however, have evolved a variety of molecular mechanisms causing that resistance. Traditional resistance management strategies with promise include rotations and mixtures of Bti and Bs, as well as untreated areas that provide natural refuges for susceptible alleles. Promising new strategies include genetic engineering to increase the toxin complexity targeted toward mosquito larvae, to enhance the host range of the mosquito control product, and to avoid the evolution of insecticide resistance. Regardless of the control strategy, a resistance-monitoring program alongside an integrative pest management approach is the best strategy to delay insecticide resistance...|$|E
