40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to identify possible test procedures for the evaluation of the strength of chewable tablets with respect to prevention of damage to teeth or <b>mandibular</b> <b>joints</b> when tablets are consumed. Diametral compression and flexure tests were employed to evaluate the strength of commercial samples from five manufacturers of chewable vitamin C tablets. Weibull analysis was used to assess the brittleness of these tablets. The tablets had a lower tensile strength value when determined by the diametral compression test compared to the flexure test ratio which ranged from 0. 27 to 0. 4. The value for the Weibull modulus ranged from 5 to 16, indicating an appreciable degree of brittleness of the samples. Relating the values for the mechanical strength to suggested practical values for the prevention of damage to the teeth or the <b>mandibular</b> <b>joints</b> indicated that most tablets exceeded these values. The flexure test reflects the practical situation closest, and a limiting tensile strength value of 2 MPa should not be exceeded for chewable tablets. The tablet batches tested were also characterized by a large batch-to-batch variability, suggesting uncontrolled manufacturing procedures. Commercially distributed chewable vitamin C tablets could provide a possible health hazard to teeth and <b>mandibular</b> <b>joints.</b> This hazard could be limited by a mechanical strength test specification...|$|R

40|$|The <b>mandibular</b> <b>joints</b> of ageing male ICR mice {{were studied}} by light and {{electron}} microscopy. A {{high incidence of}} degenerative joint disease was found relatively early in adult life, osteoarthrosis being evident by the seventh month. Initially the pathological changes were those of chondromalacia confined to isolated foci on the articular surface of the condylar cartilage. Later, characteristic signs of osteoarthrosis were noted, namely fibrillation, fibrous ankylosis, lipping and subchondral osteosclerosis. Ultrastructural examination indicated a marked heterogeneity in the articular lesions. Deep fissures and extensive cracks spread to the underlying matrix, and these were associated with severe alterations in its macromolecular structure. It is proposed that ageing chondrocytes produce a matrix which is increasingly incapable of withstanding normal mechanical forces, and {{this leads to the}} morphological changes recognized first as chondromalacia and then as osteoarthrosis...|$|R

40|$|Objectives: This {{study was}} done with the {{objective}} of determining the distance of movement between the maxillary and mandibular midline (DMM) and its relationship with the signs and symptoms of temporomandibular disorders (TMD) in canine-guided occlusion and to compare the obtained values between the right and left sides. Materials and Methods: One hundred females showing canine-guided occlusion and Angle's class I canine and molar relation were chosen for the study. The maxillary midline’s corresponding line was marked on the mandible with a marker pen in the patient's mouth, both during maximum intercuspation and at the edges of maxillary and mandibular canine contact. DMM was considered as the distance between the two lines (measured using a digital caliper). The percentages of signs and symptoms were compared using the chi-square test to determine the differences among the groups for the rates of TMD symp-toms, bruxism, joint sounds and unilateral chewing. Results: The mean value of the DMM for all subjects was found to be 3. 61 mm on the right side and 3. 64 mm on the left side. The values were subjected to a paired t-test, and the P value was statistically insignificant (P> 0. 05). Reported TMJ(temporo <b>mandibular</b> <b>joints)</b> clicking at the start was the only significant predictor (P< 0. 01) for TMD symptoms (pain in jaw), and bruxism was a marginally significant predictor for pain in the jaw (P= 0. 055).

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{intra-articular}} injections of non-radioactive and tritium-labelled glyceryl trioleate into the <b>mandibular</b> and knee <b>joints</b> of adult rabbits {{have been investigated}} using autoradiographic and histochemical techniques and electron microscopy. As observed at the fourth day after operation, fat droplets accumulate in cells of the fibrous, intermediate and cartilaginous layers of mandibular condylar, and in the superficial and upper middle (rather than the deeper) zones of femoral condylar cartilage. Autoradiography of frozen sections shows that numerous silver grains are located over these fat-laden cells following injection of trioleate which has been labelled in the fatty acid moiety of the molecule. In the knee joint the number of grains {{is directly related to}} the amount of lipid in the cell. Following injection of glyceryl-labelled trioleate no such result is obtained; it seems doubtful whether or not there is any uptake of this label. However, synovial membrane from the knee joint appears to take up both kinds of trioleate. Results of histochemical methods of NADH diaphorase, lactic dehydrogenase, acid phosphatase and beta-glucosaminidase are consistent with ultrastructural evidence of degeneration in some chondrocytes and of loss of ground substance from the matrix. A raised level of alpha-glycerophosphate dehydrogenase activity is probably associated with synthesis of endogenous glycerol for re-esterification of absorbed fatty acids, and enhanced activity of UDPglucose dehydrogenase with the chondrocytic reaction to matrix depletion. Apart from the increase in fat content, ultrastructural features in injected knee joints include flattening of cell processes against the chondrocyte surface and more abundant intracytoplasmic filaments. Injected <b>mandibular</b> <b>joints</b> show little evidence of these changes although the number of cells in the cartilage appears to be greatly reduced. No extracellular fat droplets occur in femoral cartilage, but material similar in electron density to intracellular fat is observed at the external aspect of some mandibular chondrocytes. The findings indicate that the fatty acid portion of triglyceride injected intra-articularly is taken up by the chondrocytes and retained until at least the fourth day after injection. It is suggested that prior lipolysis takes place either in the synovial cavity (or membrane) or at the chondrocyte surface, but it is uncertain how or in what form fat traverses the matrix. Lipoarthrosis appears to produce changes in the chondrocytes which are thought to be pathological; a number of cell deaths occur. The possibility that gross degeneration of the articular cartilage may ensue is subject to further investigation...|$|R

Materials and methods. 50 patients 28 - 62 years old, 37 women and 13 men who underwent computed tomography (CT) of TMJ were under observation. The results of observation were analyzed in details. The {{studies were carried out}} using cone-radial computed tomographic scanner «Vatech Pax uni 3 d». CT of TMJ was carried out in habitual occlusion before the start of treatment and after removal of TMJ MJD symptoms and complaints. At the study there were measured the width of joint fissure in front, upper and back segments according to N. A. Rabuhina methodology in N. E. Androsova and so-authors modification. Statistical analysis of the data received was carried out using «Statistics» (Statsoft, Inc) program. Results. The results of TMJ CT in patients before the start of treatment demonstrated that the sizes of TMJ joint fissure were different. The width of the upper segment of TMJ joint fissure in patients before the start of treatment was reliably less (≤ 0, 001) comparing with an analogous parameter in the group of patients after treatment that indicates the upper location of mandibular head in TMJ with reducing the height of the lower segment of face. So the data of study of the joint fissure width received using TMJ CT demonstrate formation of specific outlines of joint fissure at displacement of mandible and consequently joint head.

40|$|Caecilians (Lissamphibia: Gymnophiona) {{are unique}} among {{vertebrates}} in having {{two sets of}} jaw-closing muscles, one {{on either side of}} the jaw joint. Using data from high-resolution X-ray radiation computed tomography scans, we modelled the effect of these two muscle groups (mm. levatores mandibulae and m. interhyoideus posterior) on bite force over a range of gape angles, employing a simplified lever arm mechanism that takes into account muscle cross-sectional area and fibre angle. Measurements of lever arm lengths, muscle fibre orientations and physiological cross-sectional area of cranial muscles were available from three caecilian species: Ichthyophis cf. kohtaoensis; Siphonops annulatus; and Typhlonectes natans. The maximal gape of caecilians is restricted by a critical gape angle above which the mm. levatores mandibulae will open the jaw and destabilize the <b>mandibular</b> <b>joint.</b> The presence of destabilizing forces in the caecilian jaw mechanism may be compensated for by a <b>mandibular</b> <b>joint</b> in that the fossa is wrapped around the condyle to resist dislocation. The caecilian skull is streptostylic; the quadrate-squamosal complex moves with respect to the rest of the skull. This increases the leverage of the jaw-closing muscles. We also demonstrate that the unusual jaw joint requires streptostyly because there is a dorsolateral movement of the quadrate-squamosal complex when the jaw closes. The combination of the two jaw-closing systems results in high bite forces over a wide range of gape angles, an important advantage for generalist feeders such as caecilians. The relative sizes and leverage mechanics of the two closing systems allow one to exert more force when the other has a poor mechanical advantage. This effect is seen in all three species we examined. In the aquatic T. natans, with its less well-roofed skull, there is a larger contribution of the mm. levatores mandibulae to total bite force than in the terrestrial I. cf. kohtaoensis and S. annulatus...|$|E
