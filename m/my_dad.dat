To my dying day, I'll hate Gary for dragging Dad's name through the mud. He wrote Going My Own Way out of greed. He wanted to make money and knew that humiliating our father and blackening his name {{was the only way}} he could do it. He knew it would generate a lot of publicity. That was {{the only way he could}} get his ugly, no-talent face on television and in the newspapers. <b>My</b> <b>dad</b> was my hero. I loved him very much. He loved all of us too, including Gary.

According to Tom Jr.: This anecdote never made it into IBM lore, which is too bad, because it would have helped explain Father to {{the tens of thousands of}} people who had to follow his rules.|$|E

25|$|On October 17, 2017 Frank Ocean's dad, Calvin Cooksey, sued Frank {{on charges}} of {{defamation}} and other damages with restitution payments reaching up to 14.5 million dollars.

The post stated that:'I was six years old when I heard <b>my</b> <b>dad</b> call our transgender waitress a f***** as he dragged me out a neighborhood diner saying we wouldn’t be served because she was dirty. 'That was the last afternoon I saw my father and the first time I heard that word, I think, although it wouldn’t shock me if it wasn’t. Many hate us and wish we didn’t exist.'
