40|$|Blood type {{determination}} is {{an important}} clinical test that should be performed before any blood transfusion. However, in emergency situations, due to the patient’s condition, {{there may not be}} enough time to determine the patient’s blood type. In these cases, the O negative blood type is administered, because it causes less incompatibility risk to the patient. This paper presents a low-cost and portable device for ABO, Rh phenotype, reverse, and Crossmatching human blood typing, based on a spectrophotometric approach of the agglutination detection, with a fast response time (results in < 5 min). These features allow the device operation in <b>mobile</b> <b>emergency</b> <b>units,</b> outside conventional clinical laboratories, and close to the patient. It avoids the risk of incompatibility between the donor’s and receptor’s blood, improving the quality in healthcare services.

40|$|BackgroundThe 2006 French {{recommendations}} concerning acute {{myocardial infarction}} management occurring out of cardiologic unit recommend a close control of glycemia. The aim of our study was to assess spread of these recommendations. MethodsWe conducted in 2008 a national phone survey in coronary care units (CCU) and out-of-hospital <b>mobile</b> <b>emergency</b> <b>units</b> (SMUR). Senior physicians were asked about local hyperglycemia protocol management for patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS). ResultsThe mains answers from the cardiologists and the emergency physicians (EP) {{are listed in the}} table. CCU n= 125 SMUR n= 245 Systematic glycemia dosage in patients with chest pain 55 % 55 %Systematic glycemia dosage in patients with ACS 59 % 63 %Specific insulin protocol in patients with ACS 5514 Same hyperglycemia treatment for diabetic and non diabetic patient 52 % 62 %% of physicians who have already treated hyperglycemia during ACS 98 % 37 %Only 50 percent of the SMUR have insulin for out of hospital treatment. In the CCU the first result of glycemia is a capillary dosage for 64 % and a blood dosage for 36 %. The glycemia threshold for the insulin treatment ranges from 1 to 3 g/l. For 14 % of EP there is no indication of hyperglycemia treatment during the out of hospital management of ACS. For 99 % of cardiologists there is an indication of treatment by insulin for hyperglycemia during the ACS. ConclusionThe early management of hyperglycemia in patients with ACS is more widespread in CCU than in out of hospital emergency context. Recommendations concerning early hyperglycemia management in patients with ACS have to be more spread among emergency physicians...|$|E
40|$|According to the World Health Organization (WHO), {{cardiovascular}} diseases (CVDs) {{are the leading}} causes of death worldwide, with one third of deaths attributed to CVDs in 2012. Pulmonary oedema and pleural effusion are the most apparent symptoms of many diseases categorized under CVDs such as heart failure and lung cancer, at which fluid (mainly with high water content) is accumulated in or around the lungs. Therefore, constant monitoring of fluid levels inside the lungs {{is one of the}} most efficient ways of early detection of CVDs. Chest X-Rays and computational tomography (CT) -scans are the most widely used devices for fluid detection; however, they suffer from lack of sensitivity and ionizing radiation, respectively, that makes them unsuitable for long term monitoring purposes. Currently, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the most reliable device that can be utilized for fluid accumulation detection. However, considering the fact that more than 75 % of the CVDs occur in countries with low or middle income, it is not widely available. Moreover, due to their bulky structures, the abovementioned devices lack the capability of being used in <b>mobile</b> <b>emergency</b> <b>units</b> such as ambulances or clinics at rural areas. To that end, this thesis is dedicated to design and fabrication of a low cost, portable and non-invasive device that can be used as an initial decision making tool for medical staff to pursue further investigations to define the exact cause of the oedema. First chapter of the thesis is allocated to introduction of the {{cardiovascular diseases}} and their effects on the dielectric properties of the tissues inside the lungs. A complete literature review on various alternative methods for replacing the conventional devices is performed. The obtained results by these systems and their advantages as well as their limitations are discussed. Microwave imaging technique is then presented in chapter two as a robust method which can both provide information about the presence and location of the accumulated fluid. This is specifically of great importance for cases where biopsy is required to remove or take sample of the accumulated fluid for saving the life of the patient. Chapter two is also allocated to the introduction of microwave-based medical diagnostic and monitoring systems for different applications such as breast cancer detection and brain imaging. A prospect of the possible realizable systems is investigated and existing scanning approaches are discussed. The main contributions of the thesis that are the design of several complete platforms, design of novel and unidirectional microwave sensors (antennas), promotion of novel scanning and detection methods are clarified in these chapters. In chapter three, firstly the optimum operating frequency for torso imaging is defined. By applying a circuit model that models different layers of torso as circuit elements, it is shown that a wide operating bandwidth at lower ultra-high frequency (UHF) band provides a reasonable compensation between the resolution of the obtained images and signal penetration inside the body. It is explained that due to the limited allowed microwave power for safety considerations unidirectional antennas are required. Then, it is explained that due to the large wavelengths at lower UHF band the sizes of the prospective antennas are expected to be large. To that end, novel miniaturization techniques are proposed to reduce the sizes of the conventional antennas in chapters three and four. These antennas are categorized under three dimensional (3 -D) and planar structure. A folding technique is introduced and used in the proposed 3 -D structures and it is shown that by using this technique both size and directivity/back radiation suppression is improved. 3 -D slot-antenna and cubic monopole-fed antennas are also proposed that wide operating bandwidth is achieved using slot impedance transformer, and multiple resonance-merging techniques, respectively. Regarding the planar structures that are presented in chapter four, it is shown that by combining the loop-dipole modes, both wide-operating bandwidth and directivity enhancement is achievable. Capacitive-loading of a loop antenna is the other proposed technique in which a loop antenna is partially and/or non-uniformly loaded with capacitors in the forms of simple slots and mu-negative (MNG) metamaterial-unitcells that help miniaturizing the size of the antenna by lowering its first resonance frequency. In chapters five and six, several platforms using single and multiple antennas with linear and circular configurations are presented and the utilized imaging technique for data processing is explained. The platforms are presented in a systematic progressive manner in which each system is covering the limitations of its previous prototype. Two final clinical platforms in the shape of clinical bed and doughnut-shaped chamber are proposed and the obtained test results on artificial phantom, animal lungs and human tests are presented. Based on the obtained results on healthy human beings it is shown that the scattered-field from torso of people with different body sizes vary in a reasonably limited range that is a welcoming result for building a global-database to define a threshold for healthy range. Chapter seven concludes the discussions made throughout the thesis and explains future works that can be carried out to further improve the reported systems...|$|E

The main goal {{of this study was}} to analyze assessments of the imminence of these deliveries, by methods such as the Manilas score and the need to push. PATIENTS AND METHODS: All calls made to the Emergency Medical Aid Service in Guadeloupe concerning risks of unplanned delivery between January 1 st and June 30 th 2011 were reviewed retrospectively, and 69 of the 85 cases cared for by the hospital <b>mobile</b> <b>emergency</b> <b>unit</b> were included. RESULTS: Risks of unplanned out-of-hospital deliveries represented 1. 9 % of the calls during the study period. The Malinas score was used for dispatching in only 13 % and was not used for intervention in any case. It was estimated that the need-to-push feeling was used for 58 % (dispatching) and 54. 5 % (intervention) of patients. Its sensitivity, specificity and predictive values were higher than those of the Malinas score in dispatching and substantially higher in intervention. CONCLUSION: These results argue for the development of tools for estimating the imminence of unplanned delivery.

We aimed to determine the proportion of Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest (OHCA) where an AED was applied before arrival of the ambulance, and the proportion of OHCA-cases where an accessible AED was located within 100 m. In addition, we assessed 30 -day survival. MethodsUsing data from the <b>Mobile</b> <b>Emergency</b> Care <b>Unit</b> and the Danish Cardiac Arrest Registry, we identified 521 patients with OHCA between October 1, 2011 and September 31, 2013 in Copenhagen, Denmark. ResultsAn AED was applied in 20 cases (3. 8 %, 95 % CI [2. 4 to 5. 9]). Irrespective of AED accessibility, an AED was located within 100 m of a cardiac arrest in 23. 4 % (n= 102, 95 % CI [19. 5 to 27. 7]) of all OHCAs. However, at the time of OHCA, an AED was located within 100 m and accessible in only 15. 1 % (n= 66, 95 % CI [11. 9 to 18. 9]) of all cases. The 30 -day survival for OHCA with an initial shockable rhythm was 64 % for patients where an AED was applied prior to ambulance arrival and 47 % for patients where an AED was not applied. ConclusionsWe found that 3. 8 % of all OHCAs had an AED applied prior to ambulance arrival, but 15. 1 % of all OHCAs occurred within 100 m of an accessible AED.

Methods The EMS in this part of The Central Region of Denmark is a two tiered system. The second tier comprises physician staffed <b>Mobile</b> <b>Emergency</b> Care <b>Units.</b> The medical directors of the programs supplied system data. A questionnaire addressing airway management experience, training and knowledge was sent to the EMS-physicians. Results There are no specific guidelines, standard operating procedures or standardised program for obtaining and maintaining skills regarding prehospital advanced airway management in the schemes covered by this study. 53 / 67 physicians responded; 98, 1 % were specialists in anesthesiology, with an average of 17, 6 years of experience in anesthesiology, and 7, 2 years experience as EMS-physicians. 84, 9 % reported having attended life support course(s), 64, 2 % an advanced airway management course. 24, 5 % fulfilled the curriculum suggested for Danish EMS physicians. 47, 2 % had encountered a difficult or impossible PHETI, most commonly in a patient in cardiac arrest or a trauma patient.

30|$|Cardiogenic shock which {{corresponds}} to an acute state of circulatory failure due to impairment of myocardial contractility {{is a very}} rare disease in children, even more than in adults. To date, no international recommendations regarding its management in critically ill children are available. An experts’ recommendations in adult population have recently been made (Levy et al. Ann Intensive Care 5 (1): 52, 2015; Levy et al. Ann Intensive Care 5 (1): 26, 2015). We present herein recommendations {{for the management of}} cardiogenic shock in children, developed with the grading of recommendations’ assessment, development, and evaluation system by an expert group of the Groupe Francophone de Réanimation et Urgences Pédiatriques (French Group for Pediatric Intensive Care and Emergencies). The recommendations cover four major fields of application such as: recognition of early signs of shock and the patient pathway, management principles and therapeutic goals, monitoring hemodynamic and biological variables, and circulatory support (indications, techniques, organization, and transfer criteria). Major principle care for children with cardiogenic shock is primarily based on clinical and echocardiographic assessment. There are few drugs reported as effective in childhood in the medical literature. The use of circulatory support should be facilitated in terms of organization and reflected in the centers that support these children. Children with cardiogenic shock are vulnerable and should be followed regularly by intensivist cardiologists and pediatricians. The experts emphasize the multidisciplinary nature of management of children with cardiogenic shock and the importance of effective communication between emergency medical assistance teams (SAMU), <b>mobile</b> pediatric <b>emergency</b> <b>units</b> (SMUR), pediatric <b>emergency</b> departments, pediatric cardiology and cardiac surgery departments, and pediatric intensive care units.|$|R
40|$|SummaryBackgroundCompliance with {{guidelines}} {{for the management of}} ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) may be difficult in hard-to-access areas. AimsTo analyse the characteristics, management and outcome of STEMIs occurring at altitude in the French Alps and managed by <b>mobile</b> medical <b>emergency</b> <b>units.</b> MethodsFrom January 2006 to December 2008, from the prospective RESURCOR registry, 114 patients with a STEMI of less than 12 hours’ duration, occurring in a ski resort or at high altitude and managed by the RESURCOR care system, were identified. Baseline characteristics, treatments and in-hospital outcomes were analysed. ResultsNinety-three per cent of patients were men; the mean age was 57 years. STEMIs occurred during or less than 1 hour after physical activity in 76. 3 % of cases (mainly during or after alpine/cross-country skiing). Killip class greater or equal to 2 and cardiac arrest were observed in 35 % and 7. 9 % of cases, respectively. Fifty-two (45. 6 %) patients underwent thrombolysis and 62 (54. 4 %) had percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Median delays were: first call to treatment, 82 min (17 – 230 min); symptoms to treatment, 165 min (52 – 770 min). All delays were significantly longer for PCI than for thrombolysis. First call to treatment delay was less than 120 min in 98. 1 % of patients who underwent thrombolysis and in 51. 6 % who had PCI (P< 0. 0001). In-hospital survival was 96. 5 %. ConclusionAltitude STEMIs happen mainly during sporting activities. Clinical presentation is often severe, but an emergency coronary care network allows rapid reperfusion.

In conclusion, the incidence of DE in our <b>emergency</b> <b>unit</b> was not common. Nevertheless, recognition of DE is extremely important in order to avoid unnecessary medication in elderly subjects...|$|R
40|$|Background In {{the present}} time, medical records filled by {{healthcare}} officers in many hospitals {{are still in}} a low number, while medical record filling {{is an important part}} of giving a good service towards patient, and the data is needed for the sake of hospital management, patient, and the healthcare officer themselves. On initial survey, there was a difference between medical records in Outpatient <b>Unit</b> and <b>Emergency</b> <b>Unit</b> of RSUP dr. Kariadi Semarang. Aim To understand the differences between medical record comprehensiveness in Surgery Outpatient <b>Unit</b> and Surgery <b>Emergency</b> <b>Unit</b> of RSUP dr. Kariadi Semarang. Method This research was conducted using analytic surveillance with cross sectional study approach. The samples were taken from medical record documents in October 2011, specifically 62 records from Surgery Outpatient Unit and 62 records from Surgery <b>Emergency</b> <b>Unit</b> of RSUP dr. Kariadi Semarang. Results The descriptive analytic study showed the difference between medical records comprehensiveness in Outpatient <b>Unit</b> and <b>Emergency</b> <b>Unit</b> of RSUP dr.

40|$|AIM: Mission and {{organization}} of <b>emergency</b> <b>units</b> were analysed to understand the underlying principles and concepts. METHODS: The recent literature (2000 - 2007) on organizational structures and functional concepts of clinical <b>emergency</b> <b>units</b> was reviewed. An organizational portfolio based on the criteria specialization (presence of medical specialists on the <b>emergency</b> <b>unit)</b> and integration (integration of the <b>emergency</b> <b>unit</b> into the hospital structure) was established. The resulting organizational archetypes were comparatively assessed based on established efficiency criteria (efficiency of resource utilization, process efficiency, market efficiency). RESULTS: Clinical <b>emergency</b> <b>units</b> differ with regard to autonomy (within the hospital structure), range of services and service depth (horizontal and vertical integration). The"specialization"-"integration"-portfolio enabled the definition of typical organizational patterns (so-called archetypes) : profit centres primarily driven by economic objectives, service centres operating {{on the basis of}} agreements with the hospital board, functional clinical units integrated into medical specialty units (e. g., surgery, gynaecology) and modular organizations characterized by small emergency teams that would call specialists immediately after triage and initial diagnostic. CONCLUSIONS: There is no"one fits all" concept for the organization of clinical <b>emergency</b> <b>units.</b> Instead, a number of well characterized organizational concepts are available enabling a rational choice based on a hospital's mission and demand...|$|R
