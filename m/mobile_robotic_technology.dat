The main feature of these applications is that they require low cost robots that involve assisting people in doing their everyday jobs such as providing personal assistance, commercial security, mobile tele-conferencing, tele-presence, home services, entertainment, and elderly care. In this paper we will introduce a low cost and general purpose mobile robotic platform called MILO. It offers unique hardware and software features which make MILO suitable for a wide spectrum of personal robotic applications. MILO possesses PC architecture and runs on Windows XP.

Most of the smart wheelchair work focusing on safety issue and less work considers a socially acceptable issue. Since wheelchairs are normally used in human-shared environment, it is important to ensure the assistive motion generated from the wheelchair is safe and comfortable to the human in the surrounding. Here the framework for catering such an issue is proposed. The system initially infers human's state from head cue information. Next, the information is interpreted for modeling human's comfort zone (CZ) based on rules rooted from Proxemics concept.

40|$|Abstract The central {{idea behind}} this attempt is to merge common objects and {{robotics}} {{to obtain a}} new type of interactive artefact, we call robjects. Robjects provide services to everyday life and can be controlled by the user in a very intuitive way. Robjects take rarely the initiative, have few decisional autonomy. Most of their activity is centered and controlled by the interaction with the user. To test this concept in a concrete experiment we decided to include <b>mobile</b> <b>robotic</b> <b>technology</b> into drinking glasses to improve their service on a table. Making them mobile and interactive brings a new dimension to the table, simplifies service and improves security. The system works in the following manner: when a user starts filling a glass, the other empty glasses come closer to get filled too and then go back to their initial position. Owners of the glasses can refuse to fill their glasses by simply bringing back the glass on its initial position as soon as the glass starts to move. The system has been prototyped and tested. The analysis of the interaction of some users shows strengths in interactivity and weaknesses in the speed of the system and in reliability of the actual prototype...|$|E

40|$|With the {{emergence}} of personal <b>robotics</b> applications, <b>mobile</b> <b>robotics</b> <b>technology</b> has reached beyond the factory floor into unstructured environments {{that have not been}} specifically engineered for robots. In contrast to conventional robots, the workspace of autonomous mobile robots can range from cosy domestic environments to rough factory floors. To feel at home in such unstructured environments, the robots need behaviours that are vastly different from those of factory robots. Therefore, autonomous mobile robots need the ability to move purposefully in real world environments without human intervention. Furthermore, widespread deployment calls for simple and inexpensive means of navigation. Meeting these conflicting requirements has been an elusive goal for <b>mobile</b> <b>robotics</b> researchers. For a mobile robot to reach reasonable autonomy, two basic requirements - collision sensing and reasoning for collision avoidance must be met. The first requirement is met by an onboard sensory system that gathers information from the environment while the second requirement is fulfilled by an algorithm that exploits this information to generate commands that ensure safe navigation of the robot within its working environment. This paper, illustrates how an Infrared sensory system is utilised for collision free navigation of a mobile robot in an unknown stationary environment...|$|R
40|$|All {{over the}} world traffic {{injuries}} and fatality rates are increasing every year. The combination of negligent and imprudent drivers, adverse road and weather conditions produces tragic results with dramatic loss of life. In this scenario, the use of <b>mobile</b> <b>robotics</b> <b>technology</b> onboard vehicles could reduce casualties. Obstacle motion tracking is an essential ability for car-like mobile robots. However, this task is not trivial in urban environments where a great quantity and variety of obstacles may induce the vehicle to take erroneous decisions. Unfortunately, obstacles close to its sensors frequently cause blind zones behind them where other obstacles could be hidden. In this situation, the robot may lose vital information about these obstructed obstacles that can provoke collisions. In order to overcome this problem, an obstacle motion tracking module based only on 2 D laser scan data was developed. Its main parts consist of obstacle detection, obstacle classification, and obstacle tracking algorithms. A motion detection module using scan matching was developed aiming to improve the data quality for navigation purposes; a probabilistic grid representation of the environment was also implemented. The research was initially conducted using a MatLab simulator that reproduces a simple 2 D urban-lik...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{advances}} in <b>mobile</b> <b>robotic</b> <b>technologies</b> have enabled significant progress {{to be made}} in the development of Stair-Climbing Mobility Systems (SCMSs) for people with mobility impairments and limitations. These devices are mainly characterized by their ability to negotiate those architectural barriers associated with climbing stairs (curbs, ramps, etc.). The development of advanced trajectory generators with which to surpass such architectural barriers is one of the most important aspects of SCMSs that has not yet been appropriately exploited. These advanced trajectory generators have a considerable influence on the time invested in the stair climbing process and on passenger comfort and, consequently, provide people with physical disabilities with greater independence and a higher quality of life. In this paper, we propose a new nonlinear trajectory generator for an SCMS. This generator balances the stair-climbing time and the user’s comfort and includes the most important constraints inherent to the system behavior: the geometry of the architectural barrier, the reconfigurable nature of the SCMS (discontinuous states), SCMS state-transition diagrams, comfort restrictions and physical limitations as regards the actuators, speed and acceleration. The SCMS was tested on a real two-step staircase using different time-comfort combinations and different climbing strategies to verify the effectiveness and the robustness of the proposed approach...|$|R

The study of other complex systems has shown that system-level behaviors emerge {{as a result of the}} spatio-temporal dynamics within a system's constituent parts. The design of such systems must therefore account for both the system-level emergent behavior, as well as behaviors of individuals within the system.

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with robotic applications using a ground‐based radar sensor for simultaneous localization and mapping problems. In <b>mobile</b> <b>robotics,</b> radar <b>technology</b> is interesting because of its long range and the robustness of radar waves to atmospheric conditions, making these sensors well‐suited for extended outdoor robotic applications. Two localization and mapping approaches using data obtained from a 360 ° field of view microwave radar sensor are presented and compared. The first method is a trajectory‐ oriented simultaneous localization and mapping technique, which makes no landmark assumptions and avoids the data association problem. The estimation of the ego‐motion makes use of the Fourier‐Mellin transform for registering radar images in a sequence, from which the rotation and translation of the sensor motion can be estimated. The second approach uses the consequence of using a rotating range sensor in high speed robotics. In such a situation, movement combinations create distortions in the collected data. Velocimetry is achieved here by explicitly analysing these measurement distortions. As a result, the trajectory of the vehicle and then the radar map of outdoor environments can be obtained. The evaluation of experimental results obtained by the two methods is presented on real‐world data from a vehicle moving at 30 km/h over a 2. 5 km course...|$|R

This work focuses on the fundamental task of 3 D shape reconstruction and modelling from 3 D point clouds. The novelty lies in the representation of surfaces by algebraic functions having limited support, which enables the extraction of smooth consistent implicit shapes from noisy samples with a heterogeneous density. The minimization of total variation of second differential degree makes it possible to enforce planar surfaces which often occur in man-made environments.

40|$|The {{challenges}} of integrating a <b>mobile</b> <b>robotic</b> system into an application environment are many. Most problems inherent to installing the <b>mobile</b> <b>robotic</b> system fall {{into one of}} three categories: (1) the physical environment - location(s) where, and conditions under which, the <b>mobile</b> <b>robotic</b> system will work; (2) the technological environment - external equipment with which the <b>mobile</b> <b>robotic</b> system will interact; and (3) the human environment - personnel who will operate and interact with the <b>mobile</b> <b>robotic</b> system. The successful integration of a <b>mobile</b> <b>robotic</b> system into these three types of application environment requires more than a good pair of pliers. The tools for this job include: careful planning, accurate measurement data (as-built drawings), complete technical data of systems to be interfaced, sufficient time and attention of key personnel for training on how to operate and program the robot, on-site access during installation, and a thorough understanding and appreciation - by all concerned - of the <b>mobile</b> <b>robotic</b> system's role in the security mission at the site, as well as the machine's capabilities and limitations.
