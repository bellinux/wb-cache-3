These results are obtained using a drop coating deposition Raman (DCDR) method in which the solution of interest is microdeposited (or microprinted) on a compatible substrate, followed by solvent evaporation and backscattering detection. Representative applications include the DCDR detection of insulin derived from an HPLC fraction, nondestructive DCDR followed by MALD 1 -TOF of lysozyme, the DCDR detection of protein spots deposited using an ink-jet <b>microprinter,</b> the identification of spectral differences between glycan isomers of equal mass (such as those derived from post-translationally modified proteins), DCDR detection of spectral differences in insulin variants, DCDR detection of phosphorylation sites in peptides and/or proteins, detection of insulin conformational changes involved in fibrillation, and protein-ligand binding DCDR studies. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{past decade}} has seen revolutionary {{advances}} in three-dimensional (3 D) printing and additive manufacturing. However, a technique to create 3 D material microstructures of arbitrary complexity {{has not yet been}} developed. We present the conceptual design of a 3 D material <b>microprinter</b> as a concrete step toward an eventual 3 D material nanoprinter. Such a device would enable the use of heterogeneous starting materials with printing resolution on the order of tens of nanometers. By combining a pick-and-place particle transfer method with a custom-built laser sintering optical microscope, the core components of the 3 D printer are once again reimagined. This advance moves toward generalized material synthesis as an experimental technique to complement computational materials discovery of materials with unique structures and high interface density, such as 3 D nanocomposites, metamaterials, and photonic structures.

However, a large chunk of society is excluded from this arena of social interaction: for example, in general elderly people face a range of obstacles to the uptake of technology. This paper describes our plans to use methods {{from a wide range of}} disciplines to better understand online social phenomena. This deeper understanding will allow us to provide social functions via novel and accessible communication channels. These might include televisions and telephones, alongside more unusual technologies such as digital photo frames and <b>microprinters.</b> We hope to provide the basis for a social fabric to improve technology access, and help a wider range of people benefit from social technologies...|$|R

These complex patterns arise during development, as cells interact with {{a multitude of}} chemical and mechanical cues in the surrounding extracellular matrix. Tissue engineers have sought for decades to repair or replace damaged tissue, often relying on porous scaffolds as an artificial extracellular matrix to support cell development. However, these grafts are unable to recapitulate {{the complexity of the}} in vivo environment, limiting our ability to regenerate functional tissue. Biomedical engineers have developed several methods for printing two- and three-dimensional patterns of proteins for studying and directing cell development. Of these methods, laser microprinting of proteins has shown the most promise for printing sub-cellular resolution gradients of cues, but the photochemistry remains too slow to enable large-scale applications for screening and therapeutics In this work, we demonstrate a novel high-speed photochemistry based on multi-photon photobleaching of fluorescein, and we build the fastest 2 -D and 3 -D laser <b>microprinter</b> for proteins to date. First, we show that multiphoton photobleaching of a deoxygenated solution of biotin- 4 -fluorescein onto a PEG monolayer with acrylate end-group can enable print speeds of almost 20 million pixels per second at 600 nanometer resolution. We discovered that the mechanism of fluorescein photobleaching evolves from a 2 -photon to 3 - and 4 -photon regime at higher laser intensities, unlocking faster printing kinetics. Using this 2 -D printing system, we develop a novel triangle-ratchet method for directing the polarization of single hippocampal neurons. This ability to determine which neurite becomes an axon, and which neuritis become dendrites is an essential step for developing defined in vitro neural networks. Next, we modify our multiphoton photobleaching system to print in three dimensions. For the first time, we demonstrate 3 -D printing of full length proteins in collagen, fibrin and gelatin methacrylate scaffolds, as well as printing in agarose and agarose methacrylate scaffolds. We also present a novel method for 3 -D printing collagen scaffolds at unprecedented speeds, up to 14 layers per second, generating complex shapes in seconds with sub-micron resolution. Finally, we demonstrate that 3 -D printing of scaffold architecture and protein cues inside the scaffold can be combined, for the first time enabling structures with complex sub-micron architectures and chemical cues for directing development. We believe that the ultra-rapid printing technology presented in this thesis will be a key enabler in the development of complex, artificially engineered tissues and organs. by Mark Andrew Scott.
