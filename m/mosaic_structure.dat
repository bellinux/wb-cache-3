Segments from the Wa virus predominated in these progeny whether they were of parental or reassortant genotype. Neutralization with monoclonal antibodies specific for VP 7 proteins of the coinfecting viruses caused an alteration in genomic distribution favoring the strain heterologous to the neutralizing monoclonal antibody. Because the percentage of change in distribution of segment 9 {{was similar to that}} of the other combined segments, there appeared to be no greater association between VP 7 and segment 9 than with other segments of the homologous virus during encapsulation. From these results, it was calculated that the progeny of coinfection with P segment 9 were 77. 4 % <b>mosaic</b> <b>structures</b> and 14. 8 % pseudotypes; progeny of coinfection with Wa segment 9 were 40. 2 % <b>mosaic</b> <b>structures</b> and 1. 3 % pseudotypes.

40|$|The {{design of}} a family {{shuffling}} strategy (CLERY: Combinatorial Libraries Enhanced by Recombination in Yeast) associating PCR-based and in vivo recombination and expression in yeast is described. This strategy was tested using human cytochrome P 450 CYP 1 A 1 and CYP 1 A 2 as templates, which share 74 % nucleotide sequence identity. Construction of highly shuffled libraries of <b>mosaic</b> <b>structures</b> and reduction of parental gene contamination were two major goals. Library characterization involved multiprobe hybridization on DNA macro-arrays. The statistical analysis of randomly selected clones revealed {{a high proportion of}} chimeric genes (86 %) and a homogeneous representation of the parental contribution among the sequences (55. 8 ± 2. 5 % for parental sequence 1 A 2). A microtiter plate screening system was designed to achieve colorimetric detection of polycyclic hydrocarbon hydroxylation by transformed yeast cells. Full sequences of five randomly picked and five functionally selected clones were analyzed. Results confirmed the shuffling efficiency and allowed calculation of the average length of sequence exchange and mutation rates. The efficient and statistically representative generation of <b>mosaic</b> <b>structures</b> by this type of family shuffling in a yeast expression system constitutes a novel and promising tool for structure–function studies and tuning enzymatic activities of multicomponent eucaryote complexes involving non-soluble enzymes...|$|R

Both the Luban lock and Rubik’s Cube use <b>mosaic</b> <b>structures</b> to achieve overall stability.

40|$|Motivation: As {{a result}} of {{recombination}} or rate variation, a DNA sequence alignment may have a <b>mosaic</b> <b>structure,</b> where different segments correspond to different evolutionary histories. While several methods {{have been developed to}} predict DNA mosaic structures, they do not properly address {{the question of whether the}} predicted segmentation itself is statistically significant, or whether it is significantly better than an alternative <b>mosaic</b> <b>structure</b> predicted with another method. The objective of the present article is to devise an approximate Bayesian hypothesis test to discriminate between alternative candidate mosaic structures. Results: We have applied the proposed discrimination scheme to various synthetic and real-world DNA sequence alignments.

40|$|Genetic {{recombination}} plays two essential biological roles.

40|$|We {{introduce}} {{and develop}} new techniques to quantify DNA patchiness, and to quantify characteristics of its <b>mosaic</b> <b>structure.</b> These techniques, which involve calculating two functions, α(l) and β(l), measure correlations at length scale l and detect distinct characteristic patch sizes embedded in scale-invariant patch size distributions. Using these new methods, we address {{a number of}} issues relating to the <b>mosaic</b> <b>structure</b> of genomic DNA. We find several distinct characteristic patch sizes in certain genomic sequences, and compare, contrast, and quantify the correlation properties of different sequences, including a number of yeast, human, and prokaryotic sequences. We exclude the possibility that the correlation properties and the known <b>mosaic</b> <b>structure</b> of DNA can be explained either by simple Markov processes or by tandem repeats of dinucleotides. We find that the distinct patch sizes in all 16 yeast chromosomes are similar. Furthermore, we test the hypothesis that, for yeast, patchiness is caused by the alternation of coding and noncoding regions, and the hypothesis that in human sequences patchiness is related to repetitive sequences. We find that, by themselves, neither the alternation of coding and noncoding regions, nor repetitive sequences, can fully explain the long-range correlation properties of DNA...|$|E
40|$|In the {{following}} {{a brief summary}} is given {{of some of the}} essentials of the theory of the secondary structure. This structure is very sensitive to external disturbing effects which frequently cause the transition of crystals from thermally stable into thermally pseudostable configurations for which the term <b>mosaic</b> <b>structure</b> is proposed. A discussion of the relation of the <b>mosaic</b> <b>structure</b> to the secondary structure is given. The essentially new points of this paper are brought forth in § 5, where it is shown that several very fundamental causes are operative during the growth of crystals which endanger the formation of thermally stable configurations. The most important of these causes {{is due to the fact}} that on solidification the heat of fusion must be carried away from the growing surface. The resulting temperature gradient very often is great enough to produce plastic deformations in the crystal in status nascendi. Finally a short review is given which intends to show that the adoption of the conception of a secondary structure and the closely related <b>mosaic</b> <b>structure</b> provides an adequate basis for the understanding of the totality of phenomena which is characteristic for the solid state of matter...|$|E

Past forest structural conditions represent an ecological and evolutionary template, in which the ecosystem and its species have developed. To evaluate the current ecological condition of forests, and how it has developed and may develop in the future, it is imperative to understand both past and present forest disturbance regimes, and their impacts on forest ecosystems from local stand to regional scales (Bartemucci et al. 2002; Shorohova et al. 2009; Kneeshaw et al. 2011; Kuuluvainen and Aakala 2011; Bergeron and Fenton 2012).|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Biocosmology {{implies that}} {{the laws of the}} {{microcosm}} (i. e. the laws governing living beings and their minds) mimic the laws of the macrocosm. These laws are based on a <b>mosaic</b> <b>structure</b> and triune organisation, with some roots that may be in the classical dialectical movement. A number of modern stances can be seen in relation to the Biocosmological perspective. The relationship to the <b>mosaic</b> <b>structure</b> may be direct, as with the experimental work of Michod, or indirect, as in theoretical approaches (e. g. Yamawaki) and practical approaches (e. g. Feldenkrais). In contrast, the works of Lupasco and Cherlonneix provide different arguments for a triune basis, while Modell’s analysis can include both mosaic structures and a triune philosophical paradigm...|$|E
40|$|The spatial genetic {{composition}} of hybrid zones exhibits {{a range of}} possible patterns, with many characterized by patchy distributions. While several hypothetical explanations exist {{for the maintenance of}} these "mosaic" hybrid zones, they remain virtually unexplored theoretically. Using computer simulations we investigate the roles of dispersal and assortative mating in the formation and persistence of hybrid zone structure. To quantify <b>mosaic</b> <b>structure</b> we develop a likelihood method, which we apply to simulation and empirical data. We find that long distance dispersal can lead to a patchy distribution that assortative mating can then reinforce, ultimately producing a mosaic capable of persisting over evolutionarily significant periods of time. By reducing the mating success of rare males, assortative mating creates a positive within-patch frequency-dependent selective pressure. Selection against heterozygotes can similarly create a rare-type disadvantage and we show that it can also preserve structure. We find that <b>mosaic</b> <b>structure</b> is maintained across a range of assumptions regarding the form and strength of assortative mating. Interestingly, we find that higher levels of <b>mosaic</b> <b>structure</b> are sometimes observed for intermediate assortment strengths. The high incidence of assortment documented in hybrid zones suggests that it may {{play a key role in}} stabilizing their form and structure. 12 page(s...|$|E

40|$|In recent decades, the {{prevalence}} of Neisseria meningitidis isolates with reduced susceptibility to penicillins has increased. The intermediate resistance to penicillin (Pen(i)) for most strains is due mainly to <b>mosaic</b> <b>structures</b> in the penA gene, encoding penicillin-binding protein 2. In this study, susceptibility to beta-lactam antibiotics was determined for 60 Swedish clinical N. meningitidis isolates and 19 reference strains. The penA gene was sequenced and compared to 237 penA sequences from GenBank in order to explore the total identified variation of penA. The divergent mosaic alleles differed by 3 % to 24 % compared {{to those of the}} designated wild-type penA gene. By studying the final 1, 143 to 1, 149 bp of penA in a sequence alignment, 130 sequence variants were identified. In a 402 -bp alignment of the most variable regions, 84 variants were recognized. Good correlation between elevated MICs and the presence of penA <b>mosaic</b> <b>structures</b> was found especially for penicillin G and ampicillin. The Pen(i) isolates comprised an MIC of > 0. 094 microg/ml for penicillin G and an MIC of > 0. 064 microg/ml for ampicillin. Ampicillin was the best antibiotic for precise categorization as Pen(s) or Pen(i). In comparison with the wild-type penA sequence, two specific Pen(i) sites were altered in all except two mosaic penA sequences, which were published in GenBank and no MICs of the corresponding isolates were described. In conclusion, monitoring the relationship between penA sequences and MICs to penicillins is crucial for developing fast and objective methods for susceptibility determination. By studying the penA gene, genotypical determination of susceptibility in culture-negative cases can also be accomplished...|$|R
