40|$|Achieving single species maximum {{sustainable}} yield (MSY) {{in complex}} and dynamic fisheries targeting multiple species (<b>mixed</b> <b>fisheries)</b> is challenging because achieving the objective for one species may mean missing the objective for another. The North Sea <b>mixed</b> <b>fisheries</b> are a representative example of {{an issue that is}} generic across most demersal fisheries worldwide, with the diversity of species and fisheries inducing numerous biological and technical interactions. Building on a rich knowledge base for the understanding and quantification of these interactions, new approaches have emerged. Recent paths towards operationalizing MSY at the regional scale have suggested the expansion of the concept into a desirable area of "pretty good yield", implemented through a range around FMSY that would allow for more flexibility in management targets. This article investigates the potential of FMSY ranges to combine long-term single-stock targets with flexible, short-term, mixed-fisheries management requirements applied to the main North Sea demersal stocks. It is shown that sustained fishing at the upper bound of the range may lead to unacceptable risks when technical interactions occur. An objective method is suggested that provides an optimal set of fishing mortality within the range, minimizing the risk of total allowable catch mismatches among stocks captured within <b>mixed</b> <b>fisheries,</b> and addressing explicitly the trade-offs between the most and least productive stocks...|$|E

40|$|The ICES Working Group on <b>Mixed</b> <b>Fisheries</b> Advice for the North Sea [WGMIXFISH-NS] (Chair: Paul Dolder (UK)) met at ICES HQ, 26 — 30 May 2014 {{to apply}} mixed fish-eries {{forecasts}} {{to the draft}} North Sea single species advice formed by WGNSSK 2014. The meeting has produced a North Sea <b>Mixed</b> <b>Fisheries</b> Advice sheet and included lines showing <b>mixed</b> <b>fisheries</b> scenario outcomes in the single species advice sheets (for those stocks considered) for consideration by the ACOM advice drafting group. It did not consider ToR c (application of the FCube methodology to the West of Scotland fish-eries) {{due to a lack}} of available expertise in this geographic area or ToR d (application to the Iberian waters) which is deferred to the October meeting when relevant experts will be available. The North Sea <b>mixed</b> <b>fisheries</b> runs followed the approach used by ICES; management plan where it exists and MSY approach otherwise. The species considered here as part of the demersal <b>mixed</b> <b>fisheries</b> of the North Sea are cod, haddock, whiting, saithe, plaice, sole, and Nephrops norvegicus, as well as plaice VIId and soleVIId. The North Sea (ICES area IV) turbot stock was also added to the full scenario calculations this year. All of these are now subject to multi-annual management plans apart from turbot, plaiceVIId, soleVIId and Nephrops. Following the decision to extend the definition of the haddock stock to include the west of Scotland (ICES Subarea VIa), ICES considered the north sea haddock management plan to no longer apply, and the MIXFISH fore-casts similarly follow MSY approach advice for this stock. Five scenarios were consid-ered. 1) max: The underlying assumption was that fishing stops when all quota spe-cies are fully utilized with respect to the upper limit corresponding to single-stock exploitation boundary. 2) min: The underlying assumption was that fishing stops when the catch for the first quota species meets the upper limit corresponding to single-stock exploitation boundary. 3) cod: The underlying assumption was that all fleets set their effort at the level corresponding to their cod quota share, regardless of other stocks. 4) sq_E: The effort was set as equal to the effort in the most recently recorded year for which there are landings and discard data. 5) Ef_Mgt: The effort in métiers that used gear controlled by the EU effort man-agement regime had effort adjusted according to the regime. The max and min scenarios were included to bracket the space of potential catch and SSB outcomes but for most fleets are considered unrealistic scenarios. Of the remaining scenarios none was picked as a preferred scenario. Effort limits under the EU effort management regime were left unchanged in 2013 and 2014 and the WG considered the relationship between F and effort changes under the long term management phase of the cod recovery plan open to interpretation but still included the scenario, having made its own interpretation of the control rule. Exploratory analyses were undertaken to allow consideration of the level of cod avoid-ance required to be consistent with the single-stock exploitation boundaries for the cod stock in the absence of further adjustments to fishing effort ceilings. These are included as a ‘cod catchability reduction’ scenario. 2 ICES WGMIXFISH-NS REPORT 2014 The most limiting stocks (i. e. the stocks which are the first quota reached for most fleets) in the North Sea demersal <b>mixed</b> <b>fisheries</b> in 2015 were cod and Nephrops FU 6 (Farn Deeps). The least limiting stocks (i. e. the stocks which were the last quotas to be fulfilled) were haddock and Nephrops FU 7 (Fladen grounds). The ‘cod catchability re-duction’ analysis indicates cod avoidance at the level of an additional 40 — 50 % of 2013 level would be required in order to meet the cod single-stock target which the current level of fishing effort. The impact of <b>mixed</b> <b>fisheries</b> scenarios on seven further stocks; brill, dab, flounder, hake, lemon sole, red mullet and witch were considered without their incorporation into the <b>mixed</b> <b>fisheries</b> projections. All TACs of these stocks except the North Sea com-ponent of the hake TAC were predicted to be underutilized under assumption of status quo effort, while hake was predicted to be subject to over-quota catches under all sce-narios, including ‘min’. In 2014 data for this WG was requested as part of a joint WGNSSK-WGMIXFISH-WGNEW data call which allows a greater consistency between catch totals supplied to WGMIXFISH, WGNSSK and WGNEW and additional stocks to be included in the mixed fishery forecasts.

The meeting has produced a North Sea <b>Mixed</b> <b>Fisheries</b> Advice sheet and included lines showing <b>mixed</b> <b>fisheries</b> scenario outcomes in the single species advice sheets (for those stocks considered) for consideration by the ACOM advice drafting group. The North Sea <b>Mixed</b> <b>Fisheries</b> Annex is a separate document with minor updates from last year. The <b>mixed</b> <b>fisheries</b> runs followed the approach used by ICES; management plan where it exists and MSY approach otherwise. The species considered here {{as part of the}} demersal <b>mixed</b> <b>fisheries</b> of the North Sea are cod, haddock, whiting, saithe, plaice, sole, and Nephrops norvegicus. The plaiceVIId and soleVIId stocks were added to the full scenario calculations. All of these are now subject to multi-annual man-agement plans apart from plaiceVIId, soleVIId and Nephrops. Five scenarios were considered. 1) max: The underlying assumption was that fishing stops when all quota species are fully utilised with respect to the upper limit corresponding to single stock exploitation boundary. 2) min: The underlying assumption was that fishing stops when the catch for the first quota species meets the upper limit corresponding to single stock exploitation boundary. 3) cod: The underlying assumption was that all fleets set their effort at the level corresponding to their cod quota share, regardless of other stocks. 4) sq_E: The effort was set as equal to the effort in the most recently recorded year for which there are landings and discard data. 5) Ef_Mgt: The effort in métiers that used gear controlled by the EU effort management regime had effort adjusted according to the regime. The max and min scenarios were included to bracket the space of potential catch and SSB outcomes but for most fleets are considered unrealistic scenarios. Of the remain-ing scenarios none was picked as a preferred scenario. Effort limits under the EU ef-fort management regime were left unchanged in 2013 and the WG considered the relationship between F and effort changes under the long term management phase of the cod recovery plan open to interpretation but still included the scenario, having made its own interpretation of the control rule. In a change to previous years, the intermediate year made use of the status quo effort scenario before application of the alternative scenarios in the advice year., (previously each scenario was applied in both intermediate and advice year). The change was considered to better reflect the assumptions on fleet behaviour used in the majority of single species short term forecasts. The impact of <b>mixed</b> <b>fisheries</b> scenarios on two stocks, northern hake and plaice 3 aN were considered without their incorporation into the <b>mixed</b> <b>fisheries</b> projections. The Plaice 3 aN TAC is predicted as underutilised even under assumption of status quo effort. The North Sea quota of Northern Hake is predicted to be underutilised under the min, cod and Ef_Mgt scenarios but assuming status quo effort leads to prediction of over quota landings. As a cross check, the landings by national fleets were summed over nation for each scenario, and the share by country was compared with the initial values input to the model. In general the results indicate that the approach used does not lead to viola-tion of the underlying hypothesis of relative stability in TAC sharing (quotas) across nations. Only minor deviations are observed across scenarios, except for the Ef_Mgt scenario. Here the fact the majority of Scottish vessels come under the scope of the EU effort management regime whereas Norwegian vessels are unaffected by the same regime leads to a shift of landings share from the former to the latter under the as-sumptions of the model. As in 2012 data for this WG was requested as part of a joint WGNSSK-WGMIXFISH data call which allows a greater consistency between catch totals supplied to WGMIXFISH and WGNSSK. As an addition to its terms of reference the group also considered the consistency between the data supplied to this WG and that supplied to STECF for comparable fleet categories.

A linear mixed effects model with random vessel effect was developed as a method of standardising value generating an index of value per unit effort. This identified kilowatt fishing days as the most appropriate effort measure.

Recently, the central North Sea appears less fished by demersal gears. Towed nets including seines and beam trawls equipped with meshes of more than 100 mm resp. more than 80 mm were identified as the main gears effecting the depleted cod and reduced plaice stocks. The saithe sector, using towed nets with meshes of more than 110 mm, longlines, gill nets and others, appears to affect the 7 species to a lesser extend.

40|$|Current {{fisheries}} advice {{requires an}} increased consideration of bioeconomics and {{the interactions of}} fishing fleets with the biological stocks. This is particularly important when evaluating proposed multi-annual management plans. To achieve this, modelling tools {{need to be able}} to consider the dynamics of individual fisheries. This becomes more challenging with <b>mixed</b> <b>fisheries</b> when multiple species are caught by multiple fleets. A suitable balance needs to be found between replicating the details of the complex fishery system and simplifying a model to the level that makes it tractable but still useful. Much of the bioeconomic fisheries modelling work performed at the JRC uses the FLR software framework. The JRC has developed a new FLR package, FLasher, for performing projections and forecasts with multiple individual fisheries and multiple species. This allows the dynamics of <b>mixed</b> <b>fisheries</b> to be more accurately modelled and allows the evaluation of the economic performance of alternative management decisions. This document presents some of the features and capabilites of FLasher using a case study based on a semi-realistic flatfish fishery: two fleets with different selectiviuty patterns, bottom trawl and gillnet, catching two species with different life histories and maximum sizes, European plaice (Pleuronectes platessa) and common sole (Solea solea). FLasher expands the current modelling capabilities of FLR, allowing the impacts of proposed management plans to be evaluated in greater detail by (1) explicitly modelling the dynamics of each individual fleets, which could be affected in different ways by management, (2) forecasting in parallel the full species and fleet assemblage found in <b>mixed</b> <b>fisheries,</b> and (3) employing the latest iteration of the C++ language and a new library for automatic differentation.

Work {{conducted}} {{prior to}} the meeting focused on aspects of the ICES data-limited stocks (DLS) framework; in par-ticular, how robust it is (in terms of delivering more conservative catch advice when less data are available) and whether the performance of some of its age-aggregated methods (e. g. for Category 3) can be improved by including in the Harvest Control Rule (HCR) either a confidence interval for the age-aggregated index used or the average length in the catch relative to some reference level. Indications are that the DLS framework does not always deliver more conservative catch advice when less data are available, and that the performance of HCRs can potentially be improved with additional auxiliary information. The development of generic HCRs, and the use of Fproxy values and targets in HCRs were also considered, and suggestions made for the preparation of survey indices for use in HCRs.

40|$|In {{the context}} of the landing {{obligation}} under the European Common Fisheries Policy, electronic monitoring (EM) is often presented as one of the solutions to fully document catches. EM includes video monitoring to record the catch handling process on board the vessels. This study evaluated the efficacy of EM for cod (Gadus morhua) catches on vessels in a <b>mixed</b> bottom-trawl <b>fishery</b> and tested the hypothesis that cod catches are difficult to detect with video monitoring, specifically in catches with large volumes of bycatch. In 2011, a catch quota pilot study started for cod in the Dutch bottom-trawl fishery in which EM was used as an audit system to review the consistency of reported cod catches. Eleven vessels joined the pilot study on a voluntary basis. Participants received a 30 % increase in individual quota for cod and were compensated with extra effort in days at sea. In return, all cod catches were counted against their cod quota. This <b>mixed</b> bottom-trawl <b>fishery</b> differs from fisheries where EM was proven to be a successful method, e. g. hook and line or single-species fisheries with low bycatch volumes. We conclude that distinguishing small numbers of cod in catches of <b>mixed</b> bottom-trawl <b>fisheries</b> is difficult because there is a low correlation between logbook and video data (Pearson r = 0. 17). We expect similar difficulty in other <b>mixed</b> demersal trawl <b>fisheries</b> with large bycatch volumes, when similar-looking species are targeted. Meanwhile, implementing a landing obligation will pose large challenges for fisheries with large volumes of bycatch. Limitations in the applicability of EM to control {{one of the most common}} types of fisheries in Europe will be a burden on the implementation of the European landing obligation. Improved protocols and technical adaptations may reduce some of the limitations encountered in this study...|$|R
40|$|We {{model the}} {{potential}} {{effects of a}} discard ban on the annual fishing strategy of individual fishers in a <b>mixed</b> <b>fishery</b> under individual quota management. The North Sea beam trawl fishery, which catches large amounts of undersized plaice, {{is used as a}} model system. Under a discard ban, fishing is restricted to the fishing grounds and weeks where the maximum revenue can be realised with other species while catching the quota of the restricted species with a reduced bycatch of undersized fish. Model results suggest that, if properly enforced, a discard ban provides an incentive to implement more selective fishing gears that catch fewer small fish and are more fuel efficient (pulse trawl). If a discard ban is not properly enforced, restrictive quota do not necessarily result in the intended decrease in discarding as the fishery continues to fish while discarding the over-quota catch and least valuable size classes caught. </p...|$|R
40|$|The EWG 11 - 05 met in Ponza Island (Italy), 23 - 27 May 2011 {{to carry}} on STECF’s mandate for {{assessing}} Mediterranean stocks and provide fisheries management. The meeting was chaired by A. Abella and attended by seventeen experts, including four STECF members and two JRC experts. The major ToRs (A-E), the assessment of Mediterranean exploited stocks and fisheries, were addressed by revising assessment results provided by the expert group in 2010 and defining the status of stocks which have not been assessed before. The assessments of recent and historic stock parameters and fisheries as well as management advice provided in the present report is constrained for the Geographical Sub-areas (GSA) off Spain, Italy and Malta since no experts from Cyprus, France, Greece and Slovenia attended the meeting. The EWG 11 - 05 devoted some time to verify the data obtained during the DCF Mediterranean data call in 2010 (ToR F) for completeness and accuracy. The present report contains findings for further consideration by STECF and DG Mare regarding GSAs off Spain, Italy and Malta as well as comments regarding small pelagic and spatial coverage of costal species. ToRs G covered {{the task of the}} development of appropriate biological indicators, and methods for stock assessments in poor data situation were addressed. The EWG 11 - 05 started to discuss and evaluate the <b>mixed</b> <b>fisheries</b> frameworks and computer programs to deliver <b>mixed</b> <b>fisheries</b> management advice under various scenarios (ToR I). As many of the Mediterranean fisheries are classified as <b>mixed</b> <b>fisheries,</b> this specific issue is considered very important and relevant analyses shall be continued during the forth-coming meetings.

40|$|Achieving single species {{objectives}} in complex and dynamic fisheries targeting multiple species (<b>mixed</b> <b>fisheries)</b> is challenging as achieving the objective for one species may mean missing the objective for another. This particularly {{applies to the}} concept of Maximum Sustainable Yield (MSY) in <b>mixed</b> <b>fisheries</b> in the North Sea, where the diversity of species and fisheries induce numerous biological and technical interactions. These interactions are though increasingly well understood and quantified for the most important stocks, allowing for new approaches to emerge. Recent paths towards operationalising MSY at the regional scale have suggested the expansion of the concept into a desirable area of “Pretty Good Yield”, materialised by a range around FMSY that would allow for more flexibility in management targets. This paper investigates the potential of FMSY ranges to combine long-term single-stock targets with flexible short-term mixed-fisheries management requirements, applied to the main North Sea demersal stocks. It is shown that sustained fishing at the upper bound of the range may not be appropriate when technical interactions occur. An objective method is suggested that minimises the risk of mixed-fisheries imbalance, using advantageously the flexibility of the ranges to address explicitly the trade-offs between the most and least productive stocks.

40|$|A {{main issue}} in the {{dynamics}} of <b>mixed</b> <b>fisheries</b> is that of technical interactions, leading to incidental catch and discarding. Technical interactions largely depend on the allocation of fishing effort between metiers and fishing grounds {{which in turn is}} tightly linked to economic conditions and to the expected profitability of alterna-tive options for fishing effort allocation. We developed a bioeconomic fishery model to investigate these issues, and in particular to explore the possibilities of mitigat-ing these interactions through appropriate policy options. The bioeconomic model was developed using and creating FL...|$|E
5000|$|Due to {{the wide}} range in elevation, the Payette River {{has a variety of}} fish and fish habitats. Salmon and steelhead were {{eliminated}} in the drainage by the Black Canyon Diversion Dam, which was first completed in 1924. [...] From its mouth upstream to Black Canyon Dam, the river supports a <b>mixed</b> <b>fishery</b> for coldwater and warmwater species. Mountain whitefish make up the bulk of game fish in this section of river, with smallmouth bass, largemouth bass, channel catfish, black crappie, rainbow trout, and brown trout making significant contributions. Upstream from Black Canyon Dam, the gradient of the river increases with coldwater species increasing in abundance. The South Fork of the Payette River supports excellent populations of wild rainbow trout. The North Fork of the Payette River has been severely altered by railroad and highway construction and provides only a marginal fishery for salmonids. However, in unaltered sections such as the Cabarton reach, the North Fork is very productive for salmonids.|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{examine the}} {{utilization}} of seafood processing wastes for artificial cultivation of medicinal mushroom and composting in laboratory condition. Method: The selected agro-industrial wastes (e. g., coir pith, woodchips, sugarcane bagasse) were <b>mixed</b> with <b>fishery</b> waste in specific ratio (1 : 1). The substrates which are not <b>mixed</b> with <b>fishery</b> waste are regarded as control. All the above materials (1 : 1,control) were allowed to decompose about 15 days. The composted materials were placed in heat resistant transparent polyethylene bags. Each sterile bag was then aseptically inoculated with G. lucidum. The bags were then incubated under ambient temperature and controlled humidity. Results: The maximum biological yield per bed was obtained with sugarcane bagasse control bed 64. 78 g/bed. The lowest yield was observed in woodchips (1 : 1) 4. 6 g/bed. Based on mass obtained of G. lucidum the best substrates were ordered of like woodchips>coir>sugarcane.

40|$|The {{additional}} mortality {{caused by}} discarding may hamper the sustainable use of marine resources, {{especially if it}} is not accounted for in stock assessment and fisheries management. Generally, long and precise time-series on age-structured landings exist, but historical discard estimates are often lacking or imprecise. The flatfish fishery in the North Sea is a <b>mixed</b> <b>fishery</b> targeting mainly sole and plaice. Owing to the gear characteristics and a minimum landing size for these species, considerable discarding occurs, especially for juvenile plaice. Discard samples collected by on-board observers are available since 1999 from a limited number of commercial fishing trips. Here, we develop a statistical catch-at-age model with flexible selectivity functions to reconstruct historical discards and estimate stock abundance. We do not rely on simple predefined selectivity ogives, but use spline smoothers to capture the unknown non-linear selectivity and discard patterns, and allow these to vary in time. The model is fitted to the age-structured landings, discards, and survey data, the most appropriate model is selected, and estimates of uncertainty are obtaine...|$|R
