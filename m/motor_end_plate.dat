5|$|CMAPs show small amplitudes but normal latency and {{conduction}} velocities. If repeated impulses {{are administered}} (2 per second or 2Hz), it is normal for CMAP amplitudes to become smaller as the acetylcholine in the <b>motor</b> <b>end</b> <b>plate</b> is depleted. In LEMS, this decrease {{is larger than}} observed normally. Eventually, stored acetylcholine is made available, and the amplitudes increase again. In LEMS, this remains insufficient to reach a level sufficient for transmission of an impulse from nerve to muscle; all {{can be attributed to}} insufficient calcium in the nerve terminal. A similar pattern is witnessed in myasthenia gravis. In LEMS, in response to exercising the muscle, the CMAP amplitude increases greatly (over 200%, often much more). This also occurs on the administration of a rapid burst of electrical stimuli (20 impulses per second for 10 seconds). This is attributed to the influx of calcium in response to these stimuli. On single-fiber examination, features may include increased jitter (seen in other diseases of neuromuscular transmission) and blocking.|$|E
25|$|The disease {{myasthenia}} gravis, {{characterized by}} muscle weakness and fatigue, {{occurs when the}} body inappropriately produces antibodies against acetylcholine nicotinic receptors, and thus inhibits proper acetylcholine signal transmission. Over time, the <b>motor</b> <b>end</b> <b>plate</b> is destroyed. Drugs that competitively inhibit acetylcholinesterase (e.g., neostigmine, physostigmine, or primarily pyridostigmine) are effective in treating this disorder. They allow endogenously released acetylcholine more time to interact with its respective receptor before being inactivated by acetylcholinesterase in the synaptic cleft (the space between nerve and muscle).|$|E
2500|$|Muscle {{relaxation}} and paralysis can theoretically occur by interrupting function at several sites, including {{the central nervous}} system, myelinated somatic nerves, unmyelinated motor nerve terminals, nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, the <b>motor</b> <b>end</b> <b>plate,</b> and the muscle membrane or contractile apparatus. Most neuromuscular blockers function by blocking transmission at the end plate of the neuromuscular junction. Normally, a nerve impulse arrives at the motor nerve terminal, initiating an influx of calcium ions, which causes the exocytosis of synaptic vesicles containing acetylcholine. Acetylcholine then diffuses across the synaptic cleft. It may be hydrolysed by acetylcholine esterase (AchE) or bind to the nicotinic receptors located on the <b>motor</b> <b>end</b> <b>plate.</b> The binding of two acetylcholine molecules results in a conformational change in the receptor that opens the sodium-potassium channel of the nicotinic receptor. This allows [...] and [...] ions to enter the cell and [...] ions to leave the cell, causing a depolarization of the end plate, resulting in muscle contraction. Following depolarization, the acetylcholine molecules are then removed from the end plate region and enzymatically hydrolysed by acetylcholinesterase.|$|E

There was no significant change in the projection area of the FDL or gastrocnemius <b>motor</b> <b>end</b> <b>plates</b> after tenotomy. After tenotomy the deep (slow) component of the tibialis anterior showed an increase in the mean projection area of its <b>end</b> <b>plates</b> and so approached the faster superficial component in this respect.

5000|$|Excess {{thyroxine}} {{is believed}} {{to bring about the}} onset of thyrotoxic myopathy and eventually cause the degradation of muscle tissue. Thyroxine is a hormone produced in the thyroid gland that regulates the growth metabolism of the nervous system and regulates basal metabolic rate of many cell types. Scientists agree thyroxine brings about the degradation of muscle fibers specifically at the <b>motor</b> <b>end</b> <b>plates</b> of neuromuscular junctions.

2500|$|Although the {{reputation}} of these spiders is notorious and their venom does affect humans, only mature females are capable of envenomation in humans; their chelicerae—the hollow, needle-like mouthparts that inject venom—are, at approximately 1mm., or [...]04 in., long enough to inject venom into humans, unlike those of the much smaller males. The actual amount injected, even by a mature female, is variable. The venom injected by the female black widow is known as alpha-latrotoxin which binds to receptors at the neuromuscular <b>motor</b> <b>end</b> <b>plate</b> of both sympathetic and parasympathetic nerves, resulting in increased synaptic concentration of catecholamines. The symptoms are caused by lymphatic absorption and vascular dissemination of the neurotoxin. The symptoms that result from a black widow spider bite are collectively known as latrodectism. Deaths in healthy adults from Latrodectus bites are exceedingly rare, with no deaths despite two thousand bites yearly. On the other hand, the geographical range of the widow spiders is vast. Epidemics of mostly European Widow spider bites had been recorded from 1850 to 1950, {{and during that time}} period, deaths were reported from 2/1000 to 50/1000 bites. Deaths from the Western Black Widow had been reported as 50/1000 in the 1920s. At that same time, antivenom was introduced. [...] The LD-50 of L. mactans venom has been measured in mice as 1.39mg/kg, and separately as 1.30mg/kg (with a confidence interval of 1.20–2.70). In 1933, Allan Blair famously allowed himself to be bitten by the spider in order to investigate the toxicity of its venom in humans and as a means of convincing skeptics at the time who thought that the spider's venom might not be dangerous to humans.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVES: As {{an initial}} step toward our goal of {{developing}} a completely tissue-engineered larynx, {{the aim of this}} study was to describe and compare three strategies of creating tissue-engineered muscle-polymer constructs for hemilaryngeal reconstruction. METHODS: Cartilage-mimicking polymer was developed from electrospun poly(D,L-lactide-co-ε-caprolactone) (PCL). Primary muscle progenitor cell cultures were derived from syngeneic F 344 rat skeletal muscle biopsies. Twenty F 344 rats underwent resection of the outer hemilaryngeal cartilage with the underlying laryngeal adductor muscle. The defects were repaired with muscle stem cell-derived muscle-PCL constructs (5 animals), myotube-derived muscle-PCL constructs (5 animals), <b>motor</b> <b>end</b> plate-expressing muscle-PCL constructs (5 animals), or PCL alone (controls; 5 animals). The outcome measures at 1 month included animal survival, muscle thickness, and innervation status as determined by electromyography and immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: All of the animals survived the 1 -month implant period and had appropriate weight gain. The group that received <b>motor</b> <b>end</b> plate-expressing muscle-PCL constructs demonstrated the greatest muscle thickness and the strongest innervation, according to electromyographic activity and the percentage of <b>motor</b> <b>end</b> <b>plates</b> that had nerve contact. CONCLUSIONS: Although all of the tissue-engineered constructs provided effective reconstruction, those that expressed <b>motor</b> <b>end</b> <b>plates</b> before implantation yielded muscle that was more strongly innervated and viable.

40|$|SUMMARY This single fibre EMG study {{compares the}} {{standard}} method of neuromuscular jitter measurement in voluntarily activated muscle to that by intramuscular electrical stimulation of motor axons {{in a group}} of normal subjects. The latter method avoids the interdischarge interval-dependent jitter, as well as a possible failure to recognise split muscle fibres. The mean MCD on axonal stimulation was only 5 - 2 ps less than in the voluntary activation study and was thus 8 % more than theoretically expected for single <b>motor</b> <b>end</b> <b>plates.</b> The difference could be due to an axonaljitter and some other factors. Axonal stimulation {{has proved to be a}} relatively easy and reliable method for routine estimation of neuromuscular jitter, provided that the resolution of time mea-surement is better than 2 ps, so that low jitter due to occasional direct muscle fibre stimulation is not mistaken for a normal reading. The upper normal limits for the extensor digitorum communis muscle suggested by the present study are 40 ps (individual muscle fibres) and 25 ps (mean of 30 muscle fibres). In single fibre electromyography, the jitter of the <b>motor</b> <b>end</b> <b>plates</b> is usually measured during slight voluntary contraction of the muscle. This however, is not always practicable, for example in unco-operativ...|$|R
30|$|The AChE enzyme {{occurs in}} {{cholinergic}} synapses and <b>motor</b> <b>end</b> <b>plates,</b> and {{is responsible for}} the hydrolysis of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine into choline and acetic acid.

5000|$|To {{understand}} how {{high levels of}} thyroxine can be toxic and lead to thyrotoxic myopathy physiologically, consider basic neuromuscular junction function. Under normal circumstances, muscle contraction occurs when electrical impulses travel down descending axons from the brain or spinal cord towards the neuromuscular junction. The axon terminal depolarizes and releases Acetylcholine (ACh), a neurotransmitter, which in turn stimulates the <b>motor</b> <b>end</b> <b>plate</b> (MEP) of the muscle fiber the nerve is innervating. When the MEP depolarizes the muscle fiber releases calcium initiating the process of muscle contraction.|$|E
50|$|Action {{potentials}} {{from the}} central nervous system cause end-plate potentials at the NMJ which causes sodium ions to enter and depolarise the muscle cells. This depolarisation propagates to the T-tubules where it triggers the entry of calcium ions via Cav1.1 {{as well as from the}} sarcoplasmic reticulum through the associated ryanodine receptor RyR1. This causes contraction (tensing) of the muscle. Depolarisation of the <b>motor</b> <b>end</b> <b>plate</b> causes potassium ions to leave the muscle cells, repolarising the muscle and closing the calcium channels. Calcium is pumped away from the contractile apparatus and the muscle relaxes.|$|E

50|$|In {{patients}} with mutations in SCN4A, therefore, the channel {{is unable to}} inactivate, sodium conductance is sustained and the muscle remains permanently tense. Since the <b>motor</b> <b>end</b> <b>plate</b> is depolarised, further signals to contract have no effect (paralysis). The condition is hyperkalemic because a high extracellular potassium ion concentration will make it even more unfavourable for potassium to leave the cell to repolarise it to the resting potential. This further prolongs the sodium conductance and keeps the muscle contracted. Hence, the severity would be reduced if extracellular (serum) potassium ion concentrations are kept low.|$|E
50|$|The most {{commonly}} used treatment for spasmodic torticollis {{is the use of}} botulinum toxin injection in the dystonic musculature.

With botulinum toxin injections, patients experience relief from spasmodic torticollis for approximately 12 to 16 weeks.
