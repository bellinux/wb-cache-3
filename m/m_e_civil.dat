40|$|Intracellular {{recordings}} of spontaneous miniature end-plate potentials (<b>m.</b> <b>e.</b> p. p. s) in muscles from adult CBF- 1 mice revealed {{a population of}} muscle fibres in which the amplitude distribution of <b>m.</b> <b>e.</b> p. p. s was bimodal. The large mode <b>m.</b> <b>e.</b> p. p. s {{were similar to those}} from fibres having unimodal amplitude distributions and the small mode <b>m.</b> <b>e.</b> p. p. s were about one-half to one-quarter the amplitude of the large mode. In five diverse muscle groups (extensor digitorum communis, gluteus maximus, diaphragm, extensor digitorum longus, and soleus) from mice 10 - 12 or 31 months of age, bimodal <b>m.</b> <b>e.</b> p. p. amplitude distributions were present in about 20 % of fibres sampled. In the common bimodal distribution (type 1), the rise times of small mode <b>m.</b> <b>e.</b> p. p. s were similar to those of large mode <b>m.</b> <b>e.</b> p. p. s. A rare class of small mode <b>m.</b> <b>e.</b> p. p. s (type 2) having long rise times was also observed. Amplitudes and half-decay times of type 1 small mode <b>m.</b> <b>e.</b> p. p. s increased in the presence of an anticholinesterase (edrophonium). Increasing extracellular potassium concentration led to an increase in large mode <b>m.</b> <b>e.</b> p. p. frequency but had more variable effects on small mode frequency. In the few cases available for study, type 2 small mode <b>m.</b> <b>e.</b> p. p. s disappeared after addition of edrophonium or increased potassium. When the extracellular calcium/magnesium ratio was reduced, large mode but not small mode <b>m.</b> <b>e.</b> p. p. frequency decreased. In almost all muscle fibres in which end-plate potentials (e. p. p. s) were evoked by nerve stimulation at 20 Hz in low calcium/high magnesium solution, small mode e. p. p. s similar to small mode <b>m.</b> <b>e.</b> p. p. s appeared during 'failures' of large mode <b>m.</b> <b>e.</b> p. p. s. Also, in twelve out of fifteen fibres which had unimodal <b>m.</b> <b>e.</b> p. p. amplitude distributions, small mode e. p. p. s appeared which were similar in amplitude to small mode <b>m.</b> <b>e.</b> p. p. s in fibres with type 1 bimodal <b>m.</b> <b>e.</b> p. p. s. Thus, if both spontaneous and evoked potentials are included, small mode <b>m.</b> <b>e.</b> p. p. s are present at most CBF- 1 mouse adult neuromuscular junctions independent of muscle type or animal age. Small and large mode <b>m.</b> <b>e.</b> p. p. s differ in certain responses but both are evoked by nerve stimulation at physiological frequencies and therefore participate in normal neuromuscular synaptic activity.

Normal unpoisoned muscles were examined for comparison. Analysis of <b>m.</b> <b>e.</b> p. p. s in both normal and BoTx-poisoned muscles confirmed {{the presence of}} two populations of potentials. One population, which comprised about 96 % of the <b>m.</b> <b>e.</b> p. p. s recorded at non-poisoned end-plates, was characterized by a uniform time course and a mean time-to-peak of 0. 5 - 0. 7 ms. These potentials had a shape and time-to-peak {{similar to that of}} quantal end-plate potentials (e. p. p. s) evoked by nerve stimuli. These were designated 'fast <b>m.</b> <b>e.</b> p. p. s'. The other population of <b>m.</b> <b>e.</b> p. p. s was characterized by a slower, more variable rise-time, the time-to-peak exceeding 1. 1 ms, and generally a larger amplitude. These were designated 'slow <b>m.</b> <b>e.</b> p. p. s'. In both partial and complete paralysis by BoTx the frequency of fast <b>m.</b> <b>e.</b> p. p. s was reduced by more than 90 % and the reduction lasted several weeks. After 6 - 10 days of poisoning the frequency of slow <b>m.</b> <b>e.</b> p. p. s gradually increased. The highest frequency of slow <b>m.</b> <b>e.</b> p. p. s (0. 4 Hz) was recorded in the partially paralysed soleus muscle, the frequency being about ten times that at unpoisoned end-plates. In both partially paralysed muscles slow <b>m.</b> <b>e.</b> p. p. frequency returned towards normal 28 days after poisoning. A significant correlation (r = 0. 67) was observed between the quantal content of e. p. p. s and the frequency of fast <b>m.</b> <b>e.</b> p. p. s in partially paralysed e. d. l. muscles. No significant correlation was observed between quantal content of e. p. p. s and the frequency of slow <b>m.</b> <b>e.</b> p. p. s. To further study if muscle activity influenced the appearance of slow <b>m.</b> <b>e.</b> p. p. s, partially paralysed soleus muscles were directly stimulated in vivo during the first 11 - 13 days following BoTx poisoning, using a stimulation pattern which inhibits nerve terminal sprouting and the appearance of denervation changes. This procedure did not alter the frequency of slow <b>m.</b> <b>e.</b> p. p. s as compared to unstimulated poisoned controls. It is concluded that enhancement of slow <b>m.</b> <b>e.</b> p. p. frequency in muscles poisoned with BoTx is related to the blockade of evoked Ca 2 +-dependent quantal transmitter release. However, additional factors influence this type of spontaneous and Ca 2 +-insensitive release of acetylcholine since there is a great variability between fibres and a time lag between the disappearance of fast <b>m.</b> <b>e.</b> p. p. s and the activation of slow <b>m.</b> <b>e.</b> p. p. frequency.

40|$|The {{muscle fibre}} {{electrical}} properties, miniature excitatory junctional current (<b>m.</b> <b>e.</b> j. c.) and miniature excitatory junctional potential (<b>m.</b> <b>e.</b> j. p.) were studied during growth of an identified crayfish muscle fibre from {{a diameter of}} 20 to 400 microns. The specific membrane resistance (Rm), and the specific internal resistance (Ri), of the muscle fibre were independent of fibre diameter (d) during growth. The current-voltage relation has a similar shape in large and small fibres, indicating that voltage dependence of Rm does not change during growth. The input resistance (R 0) was approximately proportional to d- 1. 5, as predicted theoretically. The specific membrane capacitance (Cm) and the membrane time constant (Tm) increased linearly with fibre diameter, apparently {{as a result of}} the contribution of the tubular capacitance to Cm. The decrease in R 0 and the increase in Tm should have resulted in a 90 -fold decrease in <b>m.</b> <b>e.</b> j. p. amplitude during growth of the fibre from a diameter of 20 to 240 microns. However, <b>m.</b> <b>e.</b> j. p. amplitude was found to decrease only 21 -fold. This discrepancy was shown to result from an increase in <b>m.</b> <b>e.</b> j. c. amplitude and duration during growth. There was 2. 9 -fold increase in <b>m.</b> <b>e.</b> j. c. amplitude and a 2. 7 -fold increase in <b>m.</b> <b>e.</b> j. c. duration over the range of muscle fibre growth studied. This increase in the <b>m.</b> <b>e.</b> j. c. apparently results from an increase in the magnitude and duration of the synaptic conductance change produced by a quantum of transmitter. Throughout the range of muscle fibre diameters studied, the muscle fibre effective input impedance for the <b>m.</b> <b>e.</b> j. c. was 17 - 19 % of R 0.
