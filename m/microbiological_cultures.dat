2500|$|... 1880: Gamgee Tissue, a {{surgical}} dressing {{with a thick}} layer of absorbent cotton wool between two layers of absorbent gauze, is invented by Joseph Sampson Gamgee. It represents the first use of cotton wool in a medical context, and is a major advancement in the prevention of infection of surgical wounds. It is still the basis for many modern surgical dressings. Gamgee also invents the aseptic technique, a procedure that is performed under sterile conditions. This includes medical and laboratory techniques, such as with <b>microbiological</b> <b>cultures.</b> It includes techniques like flame sterilization. The largest example of aseptic techniques is in hospital operating theatres. J. R. R. Tolkien later bases Lord of the Rings character 'Sam Gamgee' on this character as they live near to Mr Gamgee.|$|E

50|$|Animals and {{microbes}} (fungi, bacteria or viruses) {{are rarely}} {{referred to as}} crops. Animals raised for human or animal consumption {{are referred to as}} livestock and microbes as <b>microbiological</b> <b>cultures.</b> Microbes are not typically grown for food itself, but are rather used to alter food (e.g., producing citric acid, fermenting yogurt, soy sauce, or sauerkraut).|$|E
50|$|In biology, an {{incubator}} is {{a device}} used {{to grow and}} maintain <b>microbiological</b> <b>cultures</b> or cell cultures. The incubator maintains optimal temperature, humidity and other conditions such as the carbon dioxide (CO2) and oxygen content of the atmosphere inside. Incubators are essential {{for a lot of}} experimental work in cell biology, microbiology and molecular biology and are used to culture both bacterial as well as eukaryotic cells.|$|E
50|$|Biomedical waste may be solid or liquid. Examples of {{infectious}} waste include discarded blood, sharps, unwanted <b>microbiological</b> <b>cultures</b> and stocks, identifiable body parts (including those {{as a result}} of amputation), other human or animal tissue, used bandages and dressings, discarded gloves, other medical supplies that may have been in contact with blood and body fluids, and laboratory waste that exhibits the characteristics described above. Waste sharps include potentially contaminated used (and unused discarded) needles, scalpels, lancets and other devices capable of penetrating skin.|$|E

50|$|Female {{genital tract}} infections caused by {{anaerobic}} bacteria are polymicrobial and include: soft-tissue perineal, vulvar and Bartholin gland abscesses; bacterial vaginosis; endometritis; pyometra; salpingitis; adnexal abscess; tubo-ovarian abscesses; intrauterine contraceptive device-associated infection; pelvic inflammatory disease, which may include pelvic cellulitis and abscess; amnionitis; septic pelvic thrombophlebitis; septic abortion; and postsurgical obstetric and gynecologic infections., Getting adequate <b>microbiological</b> <b>cultures</b> is essential. It {{is important to}} avoid contaminating the culture with the normal genital ﬂora. Methods that can ensure adequate cultures are laparoscopy, culdocentesis, or obtaining quantitative endometrial cultures employing a telescoping catheter.|$|E
50|$|Medical-type swabs {{are often}} used to take <b>microbiological</b> <b>cultures.</b> They are swabbed onto or into the {{infected}} area, then wiped across the culture medium, such as an agar plate, where bacteria from the swab may grow. They are also used to take DNA samples, most commonly by scraping cells from the inner cheek {{in the case of}} humans. They can be used to apply medicines to a targeted area, to selectively remove substances from a targeted area, or to apply cleaning substances like Betadine. They are also used as an applicator for various cosmetics, ointments, and other substances.|$|E
50|$|<b>Microbiological</b> <b>cultures</b> can {{be grown}} in petri dishes of differing sizes that have {{a thin layer of}} agar-based growth medium. Once the growth medium in the petri dish is inoculated with the desired bacteria, the plates are {{incubated}} at the optimal temperature for the growing of the selected bacteria (for example, usually at 37 degrees Celsius, or the human body temperature, for cultures from humans or animals, or lower for environmental cultures). After the desired level of growth is achieved, agar plates can be stored upside down in a refrigerator {{for an extended period of}} time to keep bacteria for future experiments.|$|E

5000|$|All Jolly Pumpkin beers are aged in oak. Including wine barrels, former bourbon barrels, {{and large}} foudres. The wood {{contains}} naturally occurring <b>microbiological</b> <b>cultures</b> including brettanomyces. These cultures produce a complex flavor profile in their beers, which includes flavors described as leathery, earthy, wild, funky, or even [...] "sweaty horse hair character", and which may approximate how some beer tasted {{before the advent}} of pasteurization and industrialization. This style of beer has been described as [...] "farmhouse ale" [...] or American wild ale. These beers can age anywhere between 3-18 months to develop the unique flavors and characteristics.|$|E
50|$|The modern streak plate {{method has}} progressed from {{the efforts of}} Robert Koch and other microbiologists to obtain <b>microbiological</b> <b>cultures</b> of {{bacteria}} in order to study them. The dilution or isolation by streaking method was first developed by Loeffler and Gaffky in Koch's laboratory, which involves the dilution of bacteria by systematically streaking them over {{the exterior of the}} agar in a petri dish to obtain isolated colonies which will then grow into quantity of cells, or isolated colonies. If the agar surface grows microorganisms which are all genetically same, the culture is then considered as a microbiological culture.|$|E
5000|$|Even in {{cultures}} {{with long}} cheese traditions, consumers may perceive some cheeses that are especially pungent-smelling, or mold-bearing varieties such as Limburger or Roquefort, as unpalatable. Such cheeses are an acquired taste {{because they are}} processed using molds or <b>microbiological</b> <b>cultures,</b> allowing odor and flavor molecules to resemble those in rotten foods. One author stated: [...] "An aversion to the odor of decay has the obvious biological value of steering us away from possible food poisoning, so {{it is no wonder}} that an animal food that gives off whiffs of shoes and soil and the stable takes some getting used to." ...|$|E

5000|$|Blood {{analysis}} shows leukopenia, thrombocytopenia and moderately elevated liver enzymes. Differential diagnosis {{must be made}} with typhus, typhoid and atypical pneumonia by Mycoplasma, Legionella or Q fever. Exposure history is paramount to diagnosis.Diagnosis involves <b>microbiological</b> <b>cultures</b> from respiratory secretions of patients or serologically with a fourfold or greater increase in antibody titers against C. psittaci in blood samples combined with the probable course of the disease. Typical inclusions called [...] "Leventhal-Cole-Lillie bodies" [...] can be seen within macrophages in BAL (bronchoalveolar lavage) fluid. Culture of C. psittaci is hazardous and should only be carried out in biosafety laboratories.|$|E
50|$|S. maltophilia {{frequently}} colonizes humid surfaces such as {{the tubes}} used in mechanical ventilation and indwelling urinary catheters as well as medical devices such as suction catheters and endoscopes. Infection is usually facilitated {{by the presence of}} prosthetic material (plastic or metal), and the most effective treatment is removal of the prosthetic material (usually a central venous catheter or similar device). The growth of S. maltophilia in <b>microbiological</b> <b>cultures</b> of respiratory or urinary specimens is difficult to interpret due to its low pathogenicity and not a proof of infection. If, however, it is grown from sites which would be normally sterile (e.g., blood), then it usually represents true infection.|$|E
50|$|Streaking is {{rapid and}} ideally a simple process of {{isolation}} dilution. The technique {{is done by}} diluting a comparatively large concentration of bacteria to a smaller concentration. The decrease of bacteria should show that colonies are sufficiently spread apart to effect {{the separation of the}} different types of microbes. Streaking is done using a sterile tool, such as a cotton swab or commonly an inoculation loop. Aseptic techniques are used to maintain <b>microbiological</b> <b>cultures</b> and to prevent contamination of the growth medium.There are many different types of methods used to streak a plate. Picking a technique is a matter of individual preference and can also depend on how large the number of microbes the sample contains.|$|E
