40|$|The {{importance}} of learning innovation particularly in Civic Education by using element of technology {{through the development}} of interactive <b>multimedia</b> learning <b>media,</b> is one of appropriate strategy to enhance students’ interest and learning outcome. By this interactive <b>multimedia</b> learning <b>media,</b> it is hoped that Civic Education subject is become powerful and meaningful subject for students. This research and development is back grounded by students’ learning outcome and interest which is low in Civic Education subject in SMP Pasundan 1 Bandung. This is because teacher and student interaction take advantage less learning media. The aim of this study is generate interactive <b>multimedia</b> learning <b>media</b> to be able to enhance students’ interest and learning outcome in Civic Education lesson of class VII in SMP Pasundan 1 Bandung. To achieve that aim, researcher use research and development (R&D) approach, Borg and Gall. In particular, the aim of this study are: (1) describe Civic Education learning condition in SMP Pasundan 1 Bandung, (2) obtain the description how to develop interactive <b>multimedia</b> learning <b>media</b> conceptually, (3) obtain the description how to implement interactive <b>multimedia</b> learning <b>media</b> conceptually, (4) find out whether there is enhancement of students’ learning interest in Civic Education lesson after the use of interactive <b>multimedia</b> learning <b>media.</b> Result of study show that (1) Civic Education learning in SMP Pasundan 1 Bandung is conservative because teacher still use media of learning which is less varied, (2) development stages of interactive <b>multimedia</b> learning <b>media</b> are needed which consist of pre production, production and post production stages, (3) teacher and student’s computer basic ability in using interactive multimedia learning and interactive <b>multimedia</b> learning <b>media</b> can be used organized with computer laboratory, classically in class, or can be used by students out of school by needing some facility or equipment such as computer and the like, LCD Projector, and some another supporting equipment, (4) there is significant difference between pretest and posttest result in students’ learning interest after using interactive <b>multimedia</b> learning <b>media,</b> (5) there is significant difference between pretest and posttest result in students’ Civic Education learning outcome after using interactive <b>multimedia</b> learning <b>media.</b> Therefore, this result of study recommend that interactive <b>multimedia</b> learning <b>media</b> can be used as one of learning media to enhance students’ learning outcome and interest in Civic Education lesson...|$|R
