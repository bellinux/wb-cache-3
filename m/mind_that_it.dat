500|$|In {{the view}} of Fraser-Sampson: [...] "While Douglas-Home's motives remain obscure, {{it is clear that}} he muddied the waters dreadfully. By {{allowing}} the MCC to believe they could continue happily fudging the issue, and by misleading them as to Vorster's true intentions, he delivered the worst of both worlds." [...] Following Douglas-Home's advice, the MCC let the matter drift throughout the 1968 season. Conscious of D'Oliveira's poor form in the West Indies and continued lack of success during early 1968, the MCC committee kept in <b>mind</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was far from certain that he would even make the team to tour South Africa.|$|E
500|$|In 2004, Hurlbut {{teamed up}} with {{director}} Charles Stone III again {{to work on the}} film Mr. 3000. In a positive review of the film, Harper Barnes of the St. Louis Post-Dispatch highlighted Hurlbut, noting he had previously worked with the film's editor, Bill Pankow, on Drumline. In a review of Mr. 3000 for The Manhattan Mercury, arts critic G.W. Clift specifically highlighted Hurlbut's work on the film, commenting: [...] "Mr. 3000 has several attractions, even unexpected ones like Shane Hurlbut's heart-stopping photography. ... one doesn't <b>mind</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> lingers over scenes, in part because the scenes look so very good." [...] In his review Mr. 3000 for the Intelligencer Journal, Jack Roberts also highlighted Hurlbut's work on the film.|$|E

In , which was released in 1986, the narration opens with the statement, [...] "It is the year 2005." [...] In 1986, that statement was futuristic. During the year 2005, that reference to the year 2005 was factual. Now, The Transformers: The Movie is retro-futuristic. The number 2005 did not change, but {{the object of the}} <b>mind</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> represents did change.|$|E
2500|$|If the defilements are {{considered}} entities, the associated mental processes are craving and clinging (Pali: “upadana”). The subsequent assumption {{on behalf of}} the <b>mind</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> is either identical with its preoccupations, or that its preoccupations belong to it, is part of a process called becoming in Buddhism. Becoming is the process which leads to birth in any given lifetime. The earliest cause for both of these events which is identified in the texts is called avijja (Pali: ignorance, unawareness).|$|E

For Demetrius was so assiduous in keeping hot these hopes and projects in the king's mind, that Philip even dreamed of them in his sleep, and thought of nothing else but this Italian expedition. The motive of Demetrius in so acting was not a consideration for Philip, for he certainly did not rank higher than third in the calculations of Demetrius. A stronger motive than that was his hatred of Rome: but the strongest of all was the consideration of his own prospects. For he had made up his <b>mind</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was only in this way that he could ever recover his principality in Pharos.|$|E
2500|$|In 2009, Plummer said of {{the film}} and his role that he was [...] "...a bit bored with the character. Although we worked hard {{enough to make him}} interesting, it was a bit like {{flogging}} a dead horse. And the subject matter is not mine. I mean, it can't appeal to every person in the world." [...] However, Plummer admits the film itself was well made and, despite his reservations, is proud to be associated with a film with such mass appeal. [...] "The world has seen [...] so many times. And there's a whole new generation every year—poor kids—that have to sit through it [...] But it was a very well-made movie, and it's a family movie and we haven't seen a family movie, I don't think, on that scale for ages.

2500|$|The usual form {{of entry}} is [...] "qui obiit in bello" [...] (who {{died in the}} war), [...] "in campo bellico" [...] (in field of war), or [...] "in campo" [...] (in the field); but the forms also occur [...] "qui obiit sub vixillo regis", (who died under the king's banner), which {{probably}} denotes that the fallen man was killed at Flodden, or [...] "qui obiit in exercitu in Northumberland" [...] (who died in the army in Northumberland), which perhaps indicates that the death occurred elsewhere than at Flodden, or that the place of death was unknown. In the Responde Books the earlier Sasines (property documents) are silent as to the campaign.
