This study is conducted to reveal the kinds and uses of transitional <b>markers</b> <b>signaling</b> reason and conclusion in argumentative compositions. It is qualitative in nature. The writer analyzed 16 argumentative compositions of Writing 3 students of the academic year 2006 / 2007 of the English department of Widya Mandala Catholic University Surabaya. The study reveals that there were 31 (156 frequency of occurrences) transitional <b>markers</b> <b>signaling</b> reason and conclusion found, which consists of 21 (110 frequency of occurrences) markers functioning as reason, and 10 (46 frequency of occurrences) others functioning as conclusion. The forms of transitional <b>markers</b> <b>signaling</b> reason were: word and phrase form. The writer found 7 (83 frequency of occurrences) word and 14 (27 frequency of occurrences) phrase forms of reason transitional markers. She also found 4 (34 frequency of occurrences) word form, 3 (9 frequency of occurrences) phrase form, and 3 (3 frequency of occurrences) clause form of transitional <b>markers</b> <b>signaling</b> conclusion. Among all of those transitional markers, there were 93 times of appropriate and 17 times of inappropriately used transitional <b>markers</b> <b>signaling</b> reason; and 37 times of appropriate and 9 times of inappropriately used transitional <b>markers</b> <b>signaling</b> conclusion. Based on the findings of the analysis above, the writer concludes that the inappropriateness used of the transitional markers found mostly happen in the presence of comma and because of the influence of Bahasa Indonesia. In line with these findings, some suggestions are given: 1. For Reading and Writing teachers. They should teach their students how to use transitional <b>markers</b> <b>signaling</b> reason ad conclusion appropriately. Besides, they are also expected to give their students assignments to read and write argumentative texts. 2.

Fraser (1990), for example, categorized DMs as adverbials (now, then), literally used phrases (to repeat, similarly) idiomatic phrases (all in all, still and all), verbs (look, see), interjections (well), coordinate conjunctions (and, but), subordinate conjunctions (while, however), and {{terms such as}} anyway and OK, which don’t fall {{into any of the}} slots. Fraser (1999) categorized DMs into two major types, including discourse markers which relate messages (contrastive, collateral, inferential, additional markers) and DMs which relate topics (e.g., by the way, back to my point). Similarly, Fraser’s (2005) categorization of DMs involved four types: Contrastive (markers showing relations of opposition); elaborative (<b>markers</b> <b>signaling</b> that the current sentence includes an elaboration or explanation of an earlier utterance); inferential (<b>markers</b> <b>signaling</b> that the current utterance conveys a message that is the outcome of some aspect of the previous utterance); and temporal (<b>markers</b> <b>signaling</b> time relations) discourse markers. Fung and Carter (2007) also categorized a core functional paradigm of DMs, namely interpersonal (markers showing relations between interlocutors), referential (markers showing relations between discourse segments, structural (<b>markers</b> <b>signaling</b> topic shift and development) and cognitive (markers denoting thinking processes) dimensions.|$|R

One of the hypothesized reasons for these complaints is the reported age-related decline in auditory temporal processing (Schneider & Pichora-Fuller, 2001; Schneider, Daneman, & Pichora- Fuller, 2002). The rationale underlying this hypothesis is that the appropriate use of speech cues relies on several types of auditory temporal resolution, which research has shown is age-related (Gordon-Salant, 2005; Pichora-Fuller & Souza, 2003; Schneider & Pichora-Fuller, 2001; Schneider et al., 2002).

40|$|AbstractIn this paper, {{we propose}} a new method for {{monitoring}} {{the position of}} marker coils. The marker coil is used for indicating spatial relationship between subject's body and magnetic sensor arrays in biomagnetic measurements, such as magnetoencephalography (MEG) and magnetocardiography (MCG). We developed a real-time marker coil position monitoring system combined with a conventional MEG system. In order to achieve simultaneous measurement of MEG <b>signals</b> and <b>marker</b> <b>signals,</b> we separated their frequency bands. The frequency bands of flux-locked loop (FLL) circuits were separated into three parts by three integrators; low-band, mid-band, and high-band. The second and third bands were assigned for MEG <b>signals</b> and <b>marker</b> <b>signals,</b> respectively. This method can avoid the crosstalk of the <b>marker</b> <b>signals</b> to MEG signals. Marker signals were generated from five marker coils driven by five independent sinusoidal current generators. These signals were continuously measured by the high-band of FLL, and then the coils were localized by FFT processing and solving inverse problem. We succeeded in displaying the localized coil position on a PC monitor once per second in real-time...|$|R
30|$|Fraser (1996) {{classified}} pragmatic markers in four subtypes: basic <b>markers</b> (<b>markers</b> <b>signaling</b> {{the force}} of the basic message); commentary markers (markers commenting on some aspect of the basic message); parallel <b>markers</b> (<b>markers</b> <b>signaling</b> an entire message in addition to the basic message); discourse markers (expressions marking the relationship between the messages). Then, Fraser (1997) provided a categorization of commentary markers, including assessment, manner of speaking, evidential, perlocutionary, mitigation, and emphasis markers. Erman (2001) recognized three domains for pragmatic markers: Textual-monitors, social monitors, and meta-linguistic monitors. Text-monitors include discourse markers, and editing markers. Editing markers in turn included repair and hesitation markers. Social monitors also involve Interactive markers and comprehension securing markers. Metalinguistic monitors include approximators, hedges, emphasisers.|$|R

40|$|Non-equilibrium {{systems have}} long-ranged spatial {{correlations}} even {{far away from}} critical points. This implies that the likelihoods of spatial steady state profiles of physical observables are nonlocal functionals. In this letter, it is shown that these properties are essential to a successful analysis of a functional level inverse problem, in which a macroscopic non-equilibrium fluctuation field is estimated from limited but spatially scattered information. To exemplify this, we dilute an out-of-equilibrium fluid flowing through random media with a marker, which {{can be observed in}} an experiment. We see that the hidden variables describing the random environment result in spatial long-range correlations in the <b>marker</b> <b>signal.</b> Two types of statistical estimators for the structure of the underlying media are then constructed: a linear estimator provides unbiased and asymptotically precise information on the particle density profiles, but yields negative estimates for the effective resistances of the media in some cases. A nonlinear, maximum likelihood estimator, on the other hand, results in a faithful media structure, but has a small bias. These two approaches complement each other. Finally, estimation of non-equilibrium fluctuation fields evolving in time is discussed. Comment: Minor revisio...|$|E

Consequently, the unavailability of tissue for research limits the statistical power of studies. Pathology archives are possible sources of rare tissue, which, if proven to remain consistent over time, could prove useful to research of rare disease types. We applied immunohistochemistry to investigate whether long term storage caused any changes to antigens used diagnostically for neuroblastoma. We constructed and quantitatively assessed a tissue microarray containing neuroblastoma archival material dating between 1950 and 2007. A total of 119 neuroblastoma tissue cores were included spanning 6 decades. Fourteen antibodies were screened across the tissue microarray (TMA). These included seven positive neuroblastoma diagnosis markers (NB 84, Chromogranin A, NSE, Ki- 67, INI 1, Neurofilament Protein, Synaptophysin), two anticipated to be negative (S 100 A, CD 99), and five research antibodies (IL- 7, IL- 7 R, JAK 1, JAK 3, STAT 5).

40|$|Purpose: The use of time-resolved four-dimensional {{computed}} tomography (4 D-CT) in radiotherapy requires strict quality assurance {{to ensure the}} accuracy of motion management protocols. The aim of this work was to design and test a phantom capable of large amplitude motion for use in 4 D-CT, with particular interest in small lesions typical for stereotactic body radiotherapy. Methods: The phantom of see-saw design is light weight, capable of including various sample materials and compatible with several surrogate <b>marker</b> <b>signal</b> acquisition systems. It is constructed of polymethylmethacrylate (Perspex) and its movement is controlled via a dc motor and drive wheel. It was tested using two CT scanners with different 4 D acquisition methods: the Philips Brilliance Big Bore CT (helical scan, pressure belt) and a General Electric Discovery STE PETCT (axial scan, infrared marker). Amplitudes ranging from 1. 5 to 6. 0 cm and frequencies of up to 40 cycles per minute were used to study the effect of motion on image quality. Maximum intensity projections (MIPs), as well as average intensity projections (AIPs) of moving objects were investigated and their quality dependence {{on the number of}} phase reconstruction bins assessed. Results: CT number discrepancies between moving and stationary objects were found to have no systematic dependence on amplitude, frequency, or specific interphase variability. MIP-delineated amplitudes of motion were found to match physical phantom amplitudes to within 2 mm for all motion scenarios tested. Objects undergoing large amplitude motions (> 3. 0 cm) were shown to cause artefacts in MIP and AIP projections when ten phase bins were assigned. This problem can be mitigated by increasing the number of phase bins in a 4 D-CT scan...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this work was to {{investigate}} the use of an experimental complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) active pixel sensor (APS) for tracking of moving fiducial markers during radiotherapy. Methods: The APS has an active area of 5. 4 5. 4 cm and maximum full frame read-out rate of 20 frame s - 1, with the option to read out a region-of-interest (ROI) at an increased rate. It was coupled to a 4 mm thick ZnWO 4 scintillator which provided a quantum efficiency (QE) of 8 for a 6 MV x-ray treatment beam. The APS was compared with a standard iViewGT flat panel amorphous Silicon (a-Si) electronic portal imaging device (EPID), with a QE of 0. 34 and a frame-rate of 2. 5 frame s - 1. To investigate the ability of the two systems to image markers, four gold cylinders of length 8 mm and diameter 0. 8, 1. 2, 1. 6, and 2 mm were placed on a motion-platform. Images of the stationary markers were acquired using the APS at a frame-rate of 20 frame s - 1, and a dose-rate of 143 MU min - 1 to avoid saturation. EPID images were acquired at the maximum frame-rate of 2. 5 frame s - 1, and a reduced dose-rate of 19 MU min - 1 to provide a similar dose per frame to the APS. Signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the background signal and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) of the <b>marker</b> <b>signal</b> relative to the background were evaluated for both imagers at doses of 0. 125 to 2 MU. Results: Image quality and marker visibility was found to be greater in the APS with SNR â�¼ 5 times greater than in the EPID and CNR up to an order of magnitude greater for all four markers. To investigate the ability to image and track moving markers the motion-platform was moved to simulate a breathing cycle with period 6 s, amplitude 20 mm and maximum speed 13. 2 mm s - 1. At the minimum integration time of 50 ms a tracking algorithm applied to the APS data found all four markers with a success rate of 92 and positional error 90 m. At an integration time of 400 ms the smallest marker became difficult to detect when moving. The detection of moving markers using the a-Si EPID was difficult even at the maximum dose-rate of 592 MU min - 1 due to the lower QE and longer integration time of 400 ms. Conclusions: This work demonstrates that a fast read-out, high QE APS may be useful in the tracking of moving fiducial markers during radiotherapy. Further study is required to investigate the tracking of markers moving in 3 D in a treatment beam attenuated by moving patient anatomy. This will require a larger sensor with ROI read-out to maintain speed and a manageable data-rate. Â© 2011 American Association of Physicists in Medicine...|$|E
