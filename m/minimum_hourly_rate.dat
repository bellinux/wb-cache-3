Park confirmed her stance by answering, “I don’t think it’s the place of politicians to be fighting over whether May 16 incident were a ‘coup d’etat’ or a ‘revolution’”. She furthermore commented that “no one can refute that the events themselves did happen, whether you call them a ‘coup’ or a ‘revolution.’” and that “we need to leave that issue” for history to decide. In addition, during another debate on 8 August 2012, the moderator asked Park the <b>minimum</b> <b>hourly</b> <b>rate</b> for a part-time worker as of 2012.

50|$|On Friday, April 12, 1968, about 2,000 {{students}} {{moved off}} the main quad, declaring {{an end to the}} Silent Vigil. Four days later, the nonacademic employee strike ended when the Board of Trustees announced its intended appointment of the Special Trustee-Administrative Committee, which would be responsible for studying the relationship between the University and its workers and make appropriate policy recommendations. However, the campus movement against university discrimination was far from over; students, faculty, and workers eagerly awaited the decisions of Duke’s administration. Eventually, Duke’s Board of Trustees heeded one of the students’ requests and created the Special Trustee-Administration Committee, which was responsible for surveying the current standing of Local 77 employees and deciding on a proper tactic to address the problems. On April 20, 1968, the committee released a statement saying, “We will be at the $1.60 <b>minimum</b> <b>hourly</b> <b>rate</b> all nonacademic employees by July 1, 1969.” As for President Knight, he did end up resigning from Hope Valley Country Club. In 1992, Hope Valley admitted its first black member. However, Knight did not write the advertisement in the Durham Morning Herald showing condolences for Martin Luther King’s death. As for increased faculty diversity, Duke began hiring more and more black professors within the decade following the Silent Vigil, including professor of psychiatry, James Carter, and professor of pediatrics, Brenda Armstrong.|$|E

40|$|Thirteen {{patients}} in chronic atrial fibrillation {{with a normal}} resting heart rate but with exercise tachycardia and episodes of bradycardia were randomised to treatment periods of two weeks on xamoterol (200 mg twice daily), low dose digoxin, or placebo, in a blind crossover study. The results (mean SEM) of symptom scores, a treadmill exercise test, and 24 hour ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring were obtained. Xamoterol improved symptom scores and controlled exercise heart rate better than digoxin. Xamoterol was better than digoxin or placebo in reducing the heart rate response to exercise and tended to improve exercise duration. Xamoterol, by reducing the daytime maximum <b>hourly</b> heart <b>rate</b> and increasing the night time <b>minimum</b> <b>hourly</b> heart <b>rate,</b> significantly reduced {{the difference between the}} two compared with placebo. In contrast, digoxin tended to reduce both the maximum and <b>minimum</b> <b>hourly</b> heart <b>rates</b> through day and night. Both the frequency and duration of ventricular pauses were reduced by xamoterol but tended to increase with digoxin.

5000|$|One way to {{understand}} the wage curve is as follows. The labour supply of each individual is positively correlated to wages, therefore the higher is the hourly wage offered, the more hours an individual is willing to work. However, {{there is a limit}} to which every person would be willing to sacrifice an hour of leisure or rest, for an hour's worth of wages. Let's say that X is the maximum amount of hours a person can work, and $A is the <b>minimum</b> <b>hourly</b> wage <b>rate</b> he expects in return. Any wage $B, greater than $A, will increase the worker's daily wage without increasing the hours of work. So if you need more hours of work than X, you need to hire more people.|$|R
50|$|The {{minimum wage}} was {{introduced}} in 1998 to combat the problem of in-work poverty and inequality. The act established {{for the first time}} in the UK a <b>minimum</b> <b>hourly</b> <b>rate</b> of pay. In order, to guarantee that workers received the wage an enforcement structure was created using two methods. These were worker-led Industrial Tribunal claims and the minimum wage enforcement teams (Inland Revenue). Few workers have used the employment tribunals to recover money because many victims of breach of minimum wage are vulnerable, for example, ethnic minorities, youth, uneducated and non-unionsed workers. A more likely channel of action is the minimum wage enforcement teams, which are run by the Inland Revenue. These teams have a number of powers including power of entry into workplaces and seizure of employers' records. In order to enforce these regulations through a ‘pyramid of sanctions’, which include: enforcement order, penalty enforcement and prosecution under criminal law. The enforcement order requests the employer to repay the worker any underpayment. If the employer refuses to comply with this requirement, penalty enforcement is issued which orders the firm to not only repay the worker (s), but to also pay a substantial fine. However, if the employer still refuses payment, as a consequence they will face prosecution under criminal law. This action can, however be seen as ineffective as only two companies have ever been prosecuted for such offences. The low rates of enforcement action are demonstrated below.|$|E

40|$|This {{paper was}} {{accepted}} for publication in the journal Critical Social Policy and the definitive published version is available at [URL] success of the contemporary ‘living wage’ movement has been highlighted by the UK government’s decision to increase the statutory minimum wage for over- 25 s sharply, {{in the name of}} improving living standards. This breaks with neoliberal reluctance to intervene in labour markets, yet raises difficult issues centring around whether <b>minimum</b> <b>hourly</b> pay <b>rates</b> are suited to promoting adequate household incomes. At worst, ‘living wages’ could distract from other policies with this objective. This article acknowledges recent critiques of the living wage as an anti-poverty measure, but demonstrates that, in combination with other policies, wage floors can play a crucial role. It shows that low pay and inadequate working incomes overlap substantially. The article argues that governments promising that work will deliver adequate living standards need a clearer narrative in which pay, public transfers/subsidies and sufficient levels of employment combine to deliver minimum acceptable living standards for working families...|$|R

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to explore what has {{happened}} to the notion and reality of equal pay over the past 50 years, a period in which women have become the majority of trade union members in the UK. It does so in the context of record employment levels based upon women’s increased labour market participation albeit reflecting their continued over-representation in part-time employment, locating the narrowed but persistent overall gender pay gap in the broader picture of pay inequality in the UK. Design/methodology/approach – The paper considers voluntary and legal responses to inequality and the move away from voluntary solutions in the changed environment for unions. Following others it discusses the potential for collective bargaining to be harnessed to equality in work, a potential only partially realised by unions in a period in which their capacity to sustain collective bargaining was weakened. It looks at the introduction of a statutory route to collective bargaining in 2000, the National Minimum Wage from 1999 and at the Equality Act 2010 as legislative solutions to inequality and in terms of radical and liberal models of equality. Findings – The paper suggests that fuller employment based upon women’s increased labour market activity have not delivered an upward pressure on wages and has underpinned rather than closed pay gaps and social divisions. Legal measures have been limited in the extent to which they have secured equal pay and wider social equality, whilst state support for collective solutions to equality has waned. Its replacement by a statutory minimum wage initially closed pay gaps, but appears to have run out of steam as employers accommodate <b>minimum</b> <b>hourly</b> <b>rates</b> through the reorganisation of working time. Social implications – The paper suggests that statutory minima or even voluntary campaigns to lift <b>hourly</b> wage <b>rates</b> may cut across and even supersede wider existing collective bargaining agreements and as such they can reinforce the attack on collective bargaining structures, supporting arguments that this can reduce representation over pay, but also over a range of other issues at work (Ewing and Hendy, 2013), including equality. Originality/value – There are then limitations on a liberal model which is confined to promoting equality at an organisational level in a public sector subject to wider market forces. The fragmentation of bargaining and representation that has resulted will continue if the proposed dismantling of public services goes ahead and its impact upon equality is already suggested in the widening of the gender pay gap in the public sector in 2015...|$|R
40|$|Carbon dioxide (CO 2) {{exchange}} between {{the atmosphere and}} grassland ecosystems {{is very important for}} the global carbon balance. To assess the CO 2 flux and its relationship to environmental factors, the eddy covariance method was used to evaluate the diurnal cycle and seasonal pattern of the net ecosystem CO 2 exchange (NEE) of a cultivated pasture in the Three-River Source Region (TRSR) on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau from January 1 to December 31, 2008. The diurnal variations in the NEE and ecosystem respiration (Re) during the growing season exhibited single-peak patterns, the maximum and minimum CO 2 uptake observed during the noon hours and night; and the maximum and minimum Re took place in the afternoon and early morning, respectively. The <b>minimum</b> <b>hourly</b> NEE <b>rate</b> and the maximum <b>hourly</b> Re <b>rate</b> were - 7. 89 and 5. 03 μmol CO 2 m- 2 s- 1, respectively. The NEE and Re showed clear seasonal variations, with lower values in winter and higher values in the peak growth period. The highest daily values for C uptake and Re were observed on August 12 (- 2. 91 g C m- 2 d- 1) and July 28 (5. 04 g C m- 2 day- 1), respectively. The annual total NEE and Re were - 140. 01 and 403. 57 g C m- 2 year- 1, respectively. The apparent quantum yield (α) was - 0. 0275 μmol μmol- 1 for the entire growing period, and the α values for the pasture's light response curve varied with the leaf area index (LAI), air temperature (Ta), soil water content (SWC) and vapor pressure deficit (VPD). Piecewise regression results indicated that the optimum Ta and VPD for the daytime NEE were 14. 1 °C and 0. 65 kPa, respectively. The daytime NEE decreased with increasing SWC, and the temperature sensitivity of respiration (Q 10) was 3. 0 during the growing season, which was controlled by the SWC conditions. Path analysis suggested that the soil temperature at a depth of 5 cm (Tsoil) was the most important environmental factor affecting daily variations in NEE during the growing season, and the photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD) was the major limiting factor for this cultivated pasture...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND [...] Although {{heart rate}} {{variability}} has already been studied in survivors of sudden cardiac death secondary to coronary artery disease, an assessment of {{heart rate variability}} in survivors of sudden cardiac death not associated with coronary artery disease has not been made. METHODS [...] 10 patients with aborted sudden cardiac death not associated with coronary artery disease (seven patients with primary ventricular fibrillation and three with unclassified mild cardiomyopathy) underwent two channel 24 hour Holter monitoring in a drug free state. All subjects were in sinus rhythm and had normal atrioventricular conduction and normal cardiac function. Spectral heart rate variability was analysed on a Holter analysis system and was expressed as total (0. 01 - 1. 00 Hz), low (0. 04 - 0. 15 Hz) and high (0. 15 - 0. 40 Hz) frequency components for each hour. Heart rate variability index was calculated for the 24 hour periods. 10 age and sex matched healthy subjects were taken as a control group. RESULTS [...] The spectral heart rate variability over 24 hours was significantly lower in survivors of sudden cardiac death than in controls (total 38 (15) v 48 (14) ms; low, 25 (11) v 32 (13) ms; and high, 13 (8) v 18 (8) ms; p < 0. 05 for all comparisons). The differences in the ratio of low/high (2. 19 (0. 76) v 1. 98 (0. 50), p = 0. 132), mean heart rate (77 (12) v 69 (12) beats/min, p = 0. 070), and heart rate variability index (38 (12) v 44 (16), p = 0. 287) over 24 hours between survivors of sudden cardiac death and controls did not reach significance. Comparisons of the <b>hourly</b> heart <b>rate</b> variability over the 24 hour period {{between the two groups}} showed that the differences in all components of heart rate variability, low/high ratio and mean heart rate were highly significant. Furthermore, {{there was no significant difference}} in the maximum <b>hourly</b> heart <b>rate</b> variability over the 24 hour period. The <b>minimum</b> <b>hourly</b> heart <b>rate</b> variability was, however, significantly lower in survivors of sudden cardiac death than in controls (total, 20 (8) v 28 (4) ms; low, 12 (6) v 17 (3) ms; high, 6 (2) v 8 (2) ms; p < 0. 05 for all comparisons). CONCLUSIONS [...] These findings suggest that there is abnormal autonomic influence on the heart in patients without coronary artery disease at risk of sudden cardiac death. Hourly analysis of heart rate variability throughout the 24 hour period may provide additional information important in the identification of high risk patients...|$|R
