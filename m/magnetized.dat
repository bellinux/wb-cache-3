40|$|The {{asymmetry}} of DC-biasing <b>magnetizing</b> curves {{leads to}} the discontinuity of magnetic reluctivity in traditional harmonic-balanced finite element method (HBFEM). Based on the B-H-M magnetic constitutive relation, the fixed-point technique divides the magnetic intensity into linear and nonlinear parts and overcomes the computational problem of discontinued magnetic reluctivity. The HBFEM combined with fixed-point technique was applied to calculate the magnetic field {{on the basis of}} DC-biasing <b>magnetizing</b> curve, considering the electromagnetic coupling. The value of fixed-point reluctivity was selected properly in the iterative computation aiming at fast convergence of the harmonic solutions. Finite element analysis of the laminated core model (LCM) was performed based on the DC-biasing <b>magnetizing</b> curve and the counterpart without DC bias respectively.

5|$|One {{important}} {{characteristic of}} the planets is their intrinsic magnetic moments, which in turn give rise to magnetospheres. The presence of a magnetic field indicates that the planet is still geologically alive. In other words, <b>magnetized</b> planets have flows of electrically conducting material in their interiors, which generate their magnetic fields. These fields significantly change {{the interaction of the}} planet and solar wind. A <b>magnetized</b> planet creates a cavity in the solar wind around itself called the magnetosphere, which the wind cannot penetrate. The magnetosphere can be much larger than the planet itself. In contrast, non-magnetized planets have only small magnetospheres induced by interaction of the ionosphere with the solar wind, which cannot effectively protect the planet.|$|E

Induction motor current is composed of two parts, <b>magnetizing</b> current and load current. Load current uses energy what is doing the work. Load current varies with load variance but <b>magnetizing</b> current is constant, regardless of load variation. <b>Magnetizing</b> current needs for establishing the rotating magnetic field of induction motor and lags behind the voltage.

This paleomagnetism of magnetically susceptible minerals is similar to the alternating bands found on Earth's ocean floors. One theory, published in 1999 and re-examined in October 2005 (with the help of the Mars Global Surveyor), is that these bands suggest plate tectonic activity on Mars four billion years ago, before the planetary dynamo ceased to function and the planet's magnetic field faded.|$|E
