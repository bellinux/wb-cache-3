In this {{research}} we present multi-body dynamics analysis {{can be applied}} in product development using {{a case study of}} a <b>Molded</b> <b>Case</b> <b>Circuit</b> <b>Breaker</b> (MCCB) with a spring-actuated linkage, which can save time and cost considerably. In particular, we demonstrate how to evaluate and improve durability of the MCCB based on multi-body dynamics and finite element simulation given SM 45 C steel used for the MCCB links. Toward this goal, a 3 D MCCB dynamic model is first developed and dynamic forces are analyzed by using the multi-body dynamics software, ADAMS. Finite element simulation is then performed to examine maximum principal stresses considering deflections and dynamic loads. Further, mechanical properties of SM 45 C steel are measured experimentally from tensile and fatigue tests. As a result, we verify that stress loads acting on the latch pin of the spring-actuated linkage are critically higher, which ultimately leads to a low-cycle fatigue fracture of the pin. Based on our analytically estimated maximum principal stresses in the MCCB and experimentally measured mechanical properties of SM 45 C steel, we evaluate design durability and improve our design. As a result, using a 4 mm diameter pin and modifying SM 45 C with heat treating that includes quenching and tempering, we successfully achieve a MCCB product development, which provides sufficient strengths to prevent yielding and fatigue failures from repeated dynamic loads...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to analyze the damage pattern when {{overcurrent}} is applied to a thermal magnetic type <b>molded</b> <b>case</b> <b>circuit</b> <b>breaker</b> (MCCB) using a Primary Current Injection Test System (PCITS). When an overcurrent of 150 A was applied to the PCITS for 5 seconds with the trip bar of an MCCB being damaged, it was found that the sur-face of the temperature control device (bimetallic strip) positioned at the right was significantly carbonized. When an overcurrent of 300 A was applied to the PCITS for 5 s under the same conditions, the entire temperature control device was deteriorated, becoming flattened and in close contact with the MCCB. When an overcurrent of 450 A was applied to the PCITS for 5 s, the coil of the temperature control device was melted and disconnected. In addition, it was observed that the contacts, the enclosure and upper cover were deformed and there was a trace of carbonization on them. When approximately 3 s had elapsed after an overcurrent of 600 A was applied, white smoke occurred inside the MCCB and a flame was radiated out, after which the overcurrent supply stopped with “phutt ” (whomp) sound. It was observed that when the same type of MCCB is damaged by a general flame, the surfaces of its handle, terminal, arc divider (extin-guisher) and temperature control device were carbonized uniformly.

As the debate between AC vs. DC protection schemes continue, {{there appear to be}} distinct advantages and disadvantages on each side with respect to reliability, efficiency, security, environmental and economic concerns. In this thesis, a low voltage DC microgrid protection scheme used in a data center is proposed. The final goal of this project is to develop a network and perform a fault analysis study while investigating different aspects of power protection schemes. Research is done on different protection devices which will be used to protect their respective components. Three types of faults will be tested on the system for fault current observation purposes. In order to calculate the theoretical fault current of the battery and converter, Microsoft Excel will be used. ICAPS by Intusoft will be used to simulate three different faults in the network. Fault 1 will be on the positive and negative pole of the converter/battery and the load. Fault 2 is a double line to ground fault located on one of the feeders near the load. Fault 3 is a single line to ground impedance located on one of the positive pole of the feeder with a high impedance.

40|$|Purpose of {{the study}} <b>Circuit</b> <b>breaker</b> is a market {{mechanism}} intended to curb excessive volatility by halting continuous trading after a significant intraday price deviation. Existing literature identifies four key problems with circuit breakers: magnet pull effect, delayed price discovery, trading interference and volatility spillover. The empirical literature on market wide <b>circuit</b> <b>breakers</b> is limited {{due to lack of}} observations. This thesis contributes to existing literature by bridging the gap between empirical research on price limits affecting individual securities and theoretical literature on market wide <b>circuit</b> <b>breakers</b> by being the first to empirically test the four aforementioned hypotheses using the <b>case</b> of China’s <b>circuit</b> <b>breaker</b> implemented between 4. 1. - 7. 1. 2016. Data and methodology The data consists of A shares of Shanghai listed CSI 300 index constituents, and their Hong Kong traded H shares for the dual listed companies. In addition to the event window, the data for control samples extends from 1. 1. 2011 to 31. 3. 2016. The hypotheses are tested by comparing the <b>circuit</b> <b>breaker</b> sample to two control samples: 1) A ”matched” control sample, where an observation with the closest corresponding intraday return is matched with a <b>circuit</b> <b>breaker</b> day observation. 2) Hong Kong control sample, where the dual listed A shares are compared to their corresponding Hong Kong listed H-shares. This approach is novel to this branch of literature, and is more robust in the sense that both A- and H-shares react simultaneously to same information regarding the underlying cash flows. Findings I find, that shares with low market capitalization, high market correlation, high turnover and tight bid-ask spreads perform the worst during the <b>circuit</b> <b>breaker.</b> I also find strong evidence of magnet pull hypothesis in the form of increased selling pressure in the close proximity to the <b>circuit</b> <b>breaker</b> trigger level. I find no significant evidence of delayed price discovery or trading interference. Furthermore, I find evidence of volatility spillover caused by increased uncertainty as proxied by relative bid-ask spread. I show that in anticipation to <b>circuit</b> <b>breaker’s</b> implementation, sophisticated investors prefer to trade in Hong Kong markets that are unaffected by the policy. Furthermore, by analyzing the dual listed shares I show that in a market affected by <b>circuit</b> <b>breaker</b> this ’migration of trading volume’ magnifies the feedback loop behavior that is driving magnet pull, but mitigates the same problems in the absence of one. Findings are mostly consistent with empirical literature on price limits, and differ in ways that would be expected based on theoretical framework.
