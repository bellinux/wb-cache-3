5|$|Rhys treats Susan {{when she}} has an MS relapse and he tries {{to make sure she}} is {{prepared}} in case her condition becomes worse. He later looks after Vanessa Villante (Alin Sumarwata) when she is brought in with severe <b>morning</b> <b>sickness.</b> Vanessa learns Rhys has been talking about her with his friends and she tells him to stay out of her business. Rhys later helps Vanessa carry some boxes and he spends the day baking a cake with her. He buys her a new mixer and Vanessa invites him to dinner. Rhys gives the cake to Elaine and when he tells her about Vanessa, she warns him to think about what he is doing before letting it go any further. Rhys thinks about cancelling on Vanessa, but he later arrives with dessert. Rhys asks Vanessa to bid on him at a charity bachelor auction, so he can raise more money than Karl. Vanessa wins and she chooses a couples massage for them to enjoy together. Rhys learns Susan has befriended Elaine and he angrily tells her to stay away from his mother. Vanessa witnesses the scene and becomes cold towards him. Rhys apologises to Susan and opens up to Vanessa about why he did it.|$|E
5|$|In November 2007, Vincent runs a {{blood test}} on himself after {{experiencing}} {{what appears to be}} symptoms of <b>morning</b> <b>sickness</b> and discovers he is pregnant. Eve inspects Vincent (who is dressed as Valerie) on November 22, 2007 and discovers his pregnancy and his true gender identity as intersex. Vincent torments Eve out of revenge for her failure to prevent his abduction when he was born and to prevent her from telling anyone that he was still alive and pregnant with Julian's child. After his psychopathic accomplice Viki Chatsworth severs Julian's penis, Vincent plies Eve with drugs and alcohol so she botches her attempt to surgically reattach Julian's penis; she reattaches it upside-down, and an erection might kill him. In May 2008, Eve and Julian assist Vincent with the birth of his son on the Russells' kitchen table after Eve explains everything about Vincent and Valerie to Julian. Eve plans to form a relationship again with Vincent (believing that motherhood has mellowed him), and convinces Julian not to turn him in to the police. During the rehearsal dinner for the joint weddings of Luis Lopez-Fitzgerald and Fancy Crane, Noah Bennett and Paloma Lopez-Fitzgerald, Miguel Lopez-Fitzgerald and Kay Bennett, and Edna Wallace and Norma Bates, Vincent and Viki kill all the guests with a poison mushroom sauce, but Tabitha gives up her powers and becomes a born again Christian in order to resurrect everyone. Vincent is last seen being arrested by Chief of Police Sam Bennett. Since T. C. Russell, Whitney, and Simone moved to New Orleans in 2007, Eve and Vincent are the only two members of the Russell family to appear in the series finale.|$|E
40|$|Objectives: This study aims to {{identify}} the clinical predictors of Chemotherapy-Induced Nausea and Vomiting (CINV) in patients undergoing moderately-emetogenic chemotherapy (MEC) through a novel strategy of identifying Principal Variables (PVs) using Principal Components (PCs) analysis. Methods: NV events were collated from 332 cancer patients undergoing AC (doxorubicin 60 mg/m 2 and cyclophosphamide 600 mg/m 2 on day 1, every 14 or 21 days) or XELOX (oxaliplatin 130 mg/m 2 on day 1, every 21 days, and capecitabine 2000 mg/m 2 /day on days 1 – 14). These events were correlated with 16 variables representing various CINV predictors (anxiety, chemotherapy-related, drinking habits, fatigue, gender, labyrinthitis, concurrent radiotherapy, and histories of CINV, motion and <b>morning</b> <b>sicknesses).</b> PC analysis, a mathematical projection technique for explaining causes of variation in datasets, was used for analysis. PVs were extracted based on their highest weights on the PCs. Results: Majority of patients were Chinese and over 50 years old. Higher proportions of patients in both regimens suffered from delayed than acute NV. Common PVs that were observed in patients with both acute and delayed NV included ‘ex-drinkers’ (17. 8 – 21. 4...|$|R

40|$|Chemotherapy-induced {{nausea and}} {{vomiting}} (CINV) are distressing {{side effects of}} chemotherapy. Neurokinin- 1 receptor antagonists (NK 1 -RAs) have been incorporated in the contemporary management of CINV. However, clinical studies on NK 1 -RAs have shown mixed results in reducing CINV risk. Most studies focused {{on the use of}} aprepitant (APR) and casopitant (CAS) in breast cancer patients receiving AC-type (doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide) chemotherapy. In this study, we compared the study design and clinical efficacies of these NK 1 -RAs in reducing CINV risk. Among the selected eight studies, 4 APR Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs), 2 APR Observational Studies (OSs) and 2 CAS RCTs were identified. Patient-related characteristics such as the proportion of females (60. 0 % - 100. 0 %), age (46. 5 - 59. 5 years), histories of motion (5. 6 % - 47. 0 % in NK 1 -RA arms) and <b>morning</b> <b>sicknesses</b> (14. 2 % - 45. 0 % in NK 1 -RA arms) and types of antiemetic regimens; as well as chemotherapy-related characteristics such as the proportion of patients on AC chemotherapy (15. 0 % - 100. 0 %) varied greatly. In terms of efficacies, both APR and CAS improved overall CR and vomiting in majority of the studies. None of the studies, however, demonstrated that NK 1 -RA could provide adequate nausea control. To conclude, NK 1 -RAs are effective in improving vomiting and overall CR, but not useful in controlling nausea or attaining CC, the ideal CINV endpoint. A shift in paradigm is needed for future CINV research. As healthcare providers continue to strive for optimum CINV control in their patients, we hope this review can help them make better informed clinical decisions...|$|R

40|$|Considerable {{progress}} has been made in improving the control of chemotherapy-induced emesis. The impact of available antiemetic options for patients receiving stem cell transplants is unclear, as few prospective data have been collected. We prospectively evaluated antiemetic outcome in patients receiving stem cell transplantation over a 7 -day period following the initiation of chemotherapy. The primary endpoints were the number of emetic episodes and the extent of nausea measured on a four-point scale. Eighty-two patients were evaluated. Ninety-five percent of patients had nausea during the first week of treatment; 80 % had at least one emetic episode. The percentage of patients with emesis was as follows: day 1 : 13 %, day 2 : 21 %, day 3 : 30 %, day 4 : 38 %, day 5 : 44 %, day 6 : 39 %, day 7 : 18 %. In multivariate analysis, gender, emesis with prior chemotherapy, history of <b>morning</b> or motion <b>sickness,</b> type of transplant (auto vs allo), use of total body irradiation, or use of dexamethasone did not effect emesis control. Most patients receiving high-dose chemotherapy experience incompletely controlled emesis. Control of nausea and emesis progressively worsened with each subsequent day following initiation of chemotherapy, reaching a nadir on day 5. New treatment approaches are needed to improve emesis control in this patient population...|$|R

25|$|Several {{countries}} either {{restricted the}} drug's use or never approved it. Ingeborg Eichler, {{a member of}} the Austrian pharmaceutical admission conference, enforced thalidomide (tradename Softenon) being sold under the rules of prescription medication and as a result relatively few affected children were born in Austria and Switzerland. In the United States, pharmacologist Frances Oldham Kelsey M.D. withstood pressure from the Richardson-Merrell company and refused Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval to market thalidomide, saying further studies were needed. This reduced the impact of thalidomide in United States patients. Although thalidomide was never approved for sale in the United States at the time, millions of tablets had been distributed to physicians during a clinical testing program. It was impossible to know how many pregnant women had been given the drug to help alleviate <b>morning</b> <b>sickness</b> or as a sedative.|$|E

500|$|For {{the role}} of Edward Bloom, Burton spoke with Jack Nicholson, Spielberg's initial choice for the role. Burton had {{previously}} worked with Nicholson on Batman (1989) and Mars Attacks! (1996). In order to depict Nicholson as the young Bloom, Burton intended to {{use a combination of}} computer-generated imagery and prosthetic makeup. The director then decided to cast around for the two actors in question. Jinks and Cohen, who were then working with Ewan McGregor on Down with Love (2003), suggested that Burton cast both McGregor and Albert Finney for Edward. Burton later compared McGregor's acting style to regular colleague Johnny Depp. Viewing Finney's performance in Tom Jones (1963), Burton found him similar to McGregor, and coincidentally found a People magazine article comparing the two. McGregor, being Scottish, found it easier performing with a Southern American English accent. [...] "It's a much easier accent to do than a standard American accent because you can really hear it. You can get your teeth into it. Standard American is much harder because it's more lyrical." [...] The same dual casting applied to {{the role of}} Bloom's wife, Sandra, who would be played by Jessica Lange and Alison Lohman. Burton commented that he was impressed with Lohman's performance in White Oleander (2002). Burton's girlfriend, Helena Bonham Carter, was also cast in two roles. Her prosthetic makeup for The Witch took five hours to apply. [...] "I was pregnant throughout filming, so it was weird being a pregnant witch," [...] the actress reflected. [...] "I had <b>morning</b> <b>sickness,</b> so all those fumes and the make-up and the rubber...it was hideous." ...|$|E
2500|$|Nausea and {{vomiting}} of pregnancy (NVP, or <b>morning</b> <b>sickness)</b> {{are associated with}} a decreased risk. [...] Several causes are thought to cause <b>morning</b> <b>sickness</b> but there is still no agreement. NVP is generally interpreted as a defense mechanism which discourages the mother's ingestion of foods that are harmful to the fetus; according to this model, a lower frequency of miscarriage would be an expected consequence of the different food choices made by a women experiencing NVP.|$|E
2500|$|Researchers at Chemie Grünenthal {{also found}} that {{thalidomide}} was a particularly effective antiemetic that had an inhibitory effect on <b>morning</b> <b>sickness.</b> Hence, on October 1, 1957, the company launched thalidomide and began aggressively marketing it under the trade name Contergan.

2500|$|Thalidomide {{was first}} marketed in 1957 in West Germany under the trade-name Contergan. The German drug company Chemie Grünenthal {{developed}} {{and sold the}} drug. Primarily prescribed as a sedative or hypnotic, thalidomide also claimed to cure [...] "anxiety, insomnia, gastritis, and tension". Afterwards, it was used against nausea and to alleviate <b>morning</b> <b>sickness</b> in pregnant women. Thalidomide became an over-the-counter drug in West Germany on October 1, 1957. Shortly after the drug was sold in West Germany, between 5,000 and 7,000 infants were born with phocomelia (malformation of the limbs). Only 40% of these children survived. Throughout the world, about 10,000 cases were reported of infants with phocomelia due to thalidomide; only 50% of the 10,000 survived. Those subjected to thalidomide while in the womb experienced limb deficiencies {{in a way that}} the long limbs either were not developed or presented themselves as stumps. Other effects included deformed eyes and hearts, deformed alimentary and urinary tracts, blindness and deafness. The negative effects of thalidomide led to the development of more structured drug regulations and control over drug use and development.|$|E

2500|$|Torikaebaya {{has been}} {{described}} as a [...] "sensationalist", [...] "sprightly" [...] and entertaining tale, but to Willig and Gatten, it is questionable as to whether the tale is intended as a farce, as during the period such issues were considered very grave and the results of bad karma in a former life. Gatten believes the tale to begin farcically, but says the characters grow out of their initial stereotypes to gain enough [...] "psychological depth" [...] to solve their difficulties, and the tale becomes a [...] "realistic treatment of Heian sexual roles". Rohlich says that Torikaebaya is [...] "clearly not meant to be comic", despite the plot deriving largely from [...] "ironic misunderstandings" [...] about the switch, [...] "all else" [...] in the tale, such as the relationships and the pursuits are [...] "familiar stock-in-trade" [...] from the monogatari genre. The Princeton Companion to Classical Japanese Literature says that Torikaebaya has several [...] "delightful comic touches", such as the Chūnagon being thoroughly surprised when her wife Shi no Kimi becomes pregnant.

Filming in Kununurra was a gruelling experience for the cast and crew with temperatures soaring to [...] which, one day, caused Kidman to faint while on a horse. In addition, she worked 14- and 15-hour days while dealing with <b>morning</b> <b>sickness.</b> While shooting in a remote region of Western Australia, the shoot had to be rescheduled when the Faraway Downs set, the homestead central to the film's story, was reduced to mud from torrential rain – the first in 50 years.

Scenes using Darwin harbour were shot in July 2007, with parts of Stokes Hill Wharf blocked to the public and mini buses used to ferry tourists past the film set. Filming lasted five months, wrapping up at Fox Studios, Sydney, on 19 December 2007. In late April, Luhrmann titled his project Australia. Two other titles that he considered for the film had been Great Southern Land and Faraway Downs.
