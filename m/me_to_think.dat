5|$|It {{was some}} time {{afterward}} when the thought flashed upon {{my mind that}} the disturbances I had observed {{might be due to}} an intelligent control. Although I could not decipher their meaning, it was impossible for <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> of them as having been entirely accidental. The feeling is constantly growing on me that I had been the first to hear the greeting of one planet to another.|$|E
500|$|Corgan insisted {{during this}} period that the band would not reform, {{although}} when Zwan broke up he announced, [...] "I think my heart was in Smashing Pumpkins [...] I think it was naive of <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> that I could find something that would mean as much to me." [...] Corgan said in 2005, [...] "I never wanted to leave the Smashing Pumpkins. That was never the plan." [...] On February 17, 2004, Corgan posted a message on his personal blog calling Wretzky a [...] "mean-spirited drug addict" [...] and blaming Iha for {{the breakup of the}} Smashing Pumpkins. On June 3, 2004, he added that [...] "the depth of my hurt [...] is only matched with the depth of my gratitude". Iha responded to Corgan's claims in 2005, saying, [...] "No, I didn't break up the band. The only person who could have done that is Billy." ...|$|E

500|$|Cele Goldsmith's {{tenure as}} editor {{began with the}} {{opportunity}} to showcase two very well-established writers: E.E. Smith and Isaac Asimov. Smith's The Galaxy Primes began serialization in March 1959. Asimov's first published story, [...] "Marooned off Vesta", had appeared in the March 1939 issue of Amazing, and Goldsmith reprinted it in March 1959 along with a sequel and Asimov's comments on the story. She soon began to publish some of the better new writers. Cordwainer Smith's [...] "Golden the Ship Was—Oh! Oh! Oh!" [...] appeared in April; and {{by the middle of the}} following year she had managed to attract stories from Robert Sheckley, Alan E. Nourse, Fritz Leiber, Gordon R. Dickson, Robert Bloch, and James Blish. The changes she made were enough to bring Robert Heinlein back as a subscriber; Heinlein read a copy of the June 1961 issue, which, he said, [...] "... caused <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> I had been missing something." ...|$|E
500|$|The American poet Ezra Pound was {{introduced}} to the group in April 1909 and found that their ideas were close to his own. In particular, Pound's studies of Romantic literature had led him to an admiration of the condensed, direct expression that he detected in the writings of Arnaut Daniel, Dante, and Guido Cavalcanti, amongst others. For example, in his 1911–12 series of essays I gather the limbs of Osiris, Pound writes of Daniel's line [...] "pensar de lieis m'es repaus" [...] ("it rests <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> of her") (from the canzone En breu brizara'l temps braus): [...] "You cannot get statement simpler than that, or clearer, or less rhetorical". These criteria of directness, clarity and lack of rhetoric were to be amongst the defining qualities of Imagist poetry. Through his friendship with Laurence Binyon, Pound had already developed an interest in Japanese art by examining Nishiki-e prints at the British Museum, and he quickly became absorbed in the study of related Japanese verse forms.|$|E
500|$|Introspection {{was also}} listed {{as one of}} the {{foundational}} themes prevalent on the album, along with [...] "genuine statements of personal and careerist reflection scattered among the posturing of 'Bitch I'm Madonna' and 'Unapologetic Bitch'" [...] according to Slant Magazines Sam C. Mac as well as her [...] "obsessive self-regard". Madonna explained to Jon Pareles of The New York Times that although she has never looked back at her past endeavors, reminiscing about it felt right for Rebel Heart. [...] "And it's bittersweet for <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> about that. It just seemed like a time where I wanted to stop and look back. It's kind of like survivor guilt. How did I make it and they didn't?" [...] During the album's development phase, she became comfortable expressing her ideas in front of a few people, comparing it to: [...] "writing your diary in front of somebody and reading it out loud... It was almost like an acting exercise, you know, just putting myself in a room and letting ideas flow even if I didn't feel so connected to the people".|$|E

2500|$|Dylan {{talked about}} his {{difficulty}} at the recording sessions {{in an interview with}} Guitar World magazine. [...] "I lose my inspiration in the studio real easy, and it's very difficult for <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> that I'm going to eclipse anything I've ever done before. I get bored easily, and my mission, which starts out wide, becomes very dim after a few failed takes and this and that." [...] In the same interview Dylan cited Buddy Holly as an influence during the recording sessions.|$|E
2500|$|... "In 1929 I {{attended}} the Columbia School of Engineering for postgraduate study in electrical engineering. Columbia {{was the first}} institution that encouraged <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> rather than memorize. My teachers were notable in that many had gained practical engineering experience outside the university {{and were able to}} share their experience with their students. I am grateful, among others, to Professors Morecroft, Hehre, and Arendt. Much of what I have subsequently learned and accomplished in engineering is based on the solid foundation of principles I learned from them." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Rev. Moon has a {{very good}} sense of humor. It's hard for <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> of a person as being mean or {{brainwashing}} people with the sense of humor he has. He truly loves people. I mean, he likes being with them. He likes being kidded-he likes being teased. I never saw a mean act on his part. [...] He never asked for special treatment. He mopped floors and cleaned tables, and he helped other people when he was finished with his job.|$|E

2500|$|Cuban is {{an admirer}} of author and philosopher Ayn Rand. About Rand's novel The Fountainhead, he said, [...] " [...] was {{incredibly}} motivating to me. It encouraged <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> as an individual, take risks to reach my goals, and responsibility for my successes and failures. I loved it." [...] His political views have leaned toward libertarianism. He held {{a position on the}} centrist Unity08 political organization's advisory council. [...] While leaning towards libertarianism, Cuban posted an entry on his blog claiming paying more taxes to be the most patriotic thing someone can do.|$|E
2500|$|On June 15, 2008, Edwards {{stepped back}} from his initial {{outright}} denial {{of interest in the}} position of the Vice President, saying, [...] "I'd take anything he asks <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> about seriously, but obviously this is something that I've done and it's not a job I'm seeking." [...] On June 20, 2008, The Associated Press reported that according to a member of the Congressional Black Caucus, the names of Edwards and Sam Nunn were on Obama's vice presidential shortlist. Ultimately, then-Senator Joe Biden of Delaware was tapped to become Obama's running mate.|$|E

2500|$|Churchill {{also wrote}} that {{although}} the Allied offensives up until August 1918 had been [...] "as hopeless as they were disastrous", requiring men of fifty to be called up because of the manpower shortage, [...] "Haig and Foch were vindicated in the end" [...] and that the Hundred Days [...] "will excite the wonder of future generations." [...] Churchill (23 Nov 1926) admitted to Lord Beaverbrook, who thought him too willing to praise Haig that [...] "subsequent study of the war has led <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> a good deal better of Haig than I did at the time. It is absolutely certain {{there was no one}} who could have taken his place." ...|$|E
2500|$|I {{realize that}} I shouldn't be {{surprised}} at God's doing things that I can't explain. [...] I shouldn't doubt His existence just because I find that I sometimes can't understand why or how He has made something. [...] I know that my nature is weak and limited and that God's is limitless, incomprehensible, and infinite, and, from this, I can infer that He can do innumerable things whose reasons are unknown to me. [...] On this ground alone, I regard the common practice of explaining things {{in terms of their}} purposes to be useless in physics: it would be foolhardy of <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> that I can discover God's purposes.

2500|$|On the night, Labour's {{candidate}} Judith Tizard {{came within}} 406 votes {{of winning the}} traditionally National-held seat of Remuera; she had been forecast as the winner by initial vote counting. Tizard's near-win fueled Lange's misgivings about the direction his government was taking. He commented, [...] "That election night was a great revelation for me. That was an apprehension on my part that we had actually abandoned our constituency. And it set <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> what on earth have we done that we come within 400 votes of winning the true-blue seat of Remuera. And that struck me as being a dangerous flirtation, and an act of treachery to the people we were born to represent." ...|$|E

2500|$|Richardson was {{a strong}} {{supporter}} of the Brotherhood of Professional Base-Ball Players, the union that represented the players and organized the Players' League in response to unfair treatment by team owners. In January 1890, he spoke out against players like teammate John Clarkson who had joined the Brotherhood but remained with their old clubs. [...] Richardson said he would remain loyal to the Players' League even if it could only pay him $10 a week and added: [...] "I held up my hand and swore that I would stick to the brotherhood... I respect my word and regard my oath as sacred. [...] You have no idea how hot it makes <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> of the way some of these players have acted." ...|$|E
2500|$|An early (and widely influential) {{statement}} from an Igbo man, Olaudah Equiano, a Christian-educated freed slave, suggested a migratory {{origin of the}} Igbo Jews. He remarked in his autobiography of 1789 on [...] "the strong analogy which... appears to prevail in the manners and customs of my countrymen {{and those of the}} Jews, before they reached the Land of Promise, and particularly the patriarchs while they were yet in that pastoral state which is described in Genesis— an analogy, which alone would induce <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> that the one people had sprung from the other." [...] For authoritative support, he gives reference to [...] "Dr. Gill, who, in his commentary on Genesis, very ably deduces the pedigree of the Africans from Afer and Afra, the descendants of Abraham....|$|E

I want you to know... that the sound of the conga nourishes me, the sound of the frying pans gives me life and the sound of the bocú drives me crazy. [...] Several days prior to the beginning of rehearsals, I went to see a doctor; I felt overwhelmed, sad, pensive. He prescribed and gave me some injections, and I felt absolutely no different, but as soon as I heard the sound of the first bocú, I was completely cured, I felt strong and ready for anything. And I advise those who are unhappy and listless to get an invigorating injection of bocú, conga and frying pans and you’ll be OK in 24 hours.” (Pérez II 1988:22-3) ...|$|E
