In March 2009, it was reported that in 2008, Barclays received billions of dollars from its insurance arrangements with AIG, including US$8.5 billion from funds provided by the United States to bail out AIG.|$|E

The cost of the war still weighed heavily on the Soviet economy. Beria craved the vast financial resources that another (more sustained) relationship with the United States could provide. For example, Beria gave Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania serious prospects of national autonomy, possibly similarly to other Soviet satellite states in Europe.|$|E

25|$|He asked Tubman {{to gather}} former slaves then living in present-day Southern Ontario who <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> join his {{fighting}} force, which she did. Brown arrived in Harpers Ferry on July 3, 1859. A few days later, {{under the name}} Isaac Smith, he rented a farmhouse in nearby Maryland. He awaited the arrival of his recruits. They never materialized in the numbers he expected. In late August he met with Douglass in Chambersburg, Pennsylvania, where he revealed the Harpers Ferry plan. Douglass expressed severe reservations, rebuffing Brown's pleas to join the mission. Douglass had actually known about Brown's plans from early in 1859 and had {{made a number of}} efforts to discourage blacks from enlisting.|$|E
25|$|Note that Game Value is {{dependent}} {{not only on}} the cards held (including the Skat) but also on which game is being declared and the outcome of the play. Each holding can thus be evaluated differently by different players. A risk-taking player <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> declare Hand on a holding on which another player might not — these two players will therefore give different valuations to the same holding. However, after all tricks have been played, it is always possible to determine the exact Game Value by combining the actual holding with the type of game and outcome of the play. Only then it becomes apparent if declarer has won or lost (if he overbid).|$|E
25|$|The Mishnah {{taught that}} if perjurers testified {{that a man}} {{divorced}} his wife and had not paid her ketubah, seeing that her ketubah would ultimately {{have to be paid}} sooner or later, the assessment was made based on the value of the woman's ketubah in the event of her being widowed or divorced or, alternatively, her husband inheriting her after her death. If perjurers testified that a debtor owed a creditor 1,000 zuz due within 30 days, while the debtor says that the debt was due in 10 years, the assessment of the fine is {{made on the basis of}} how much one <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> offer for the difference between holding the sum of 1,000 zuz to be repaid in 30 days or in 10 years.|$|E

25|$|The {{choice of}} {{selection}} criterion for decision analysis is subjective. The choice of criterion is made {{outside of the}} analysis (it is exogenous). One of the influences on this choice on this is attitude to risk. Risk aversion describes how willing or unwilling someone is to take risks. Evidence indicates that most, but not all, individuals prefer certain outcomes to uncertain ones. Risk-averse individuals prefer decision criteria that reduce the chance of the worst possible outcome, while risk-seeking individuals prefer decision criteria that maximize the chance of the best possible outcome. In terms of returns on investment, if {{society as a whole}} is risk-averse, we <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> accept some investments with negative expected returns, e.g., in mitigation. Such investments may help to reduce the possibility of future climate damages or the costs of adaptation.|$|E
25|$|By day 63, Horne was deaf in one ear, {{blind in}} one eye, his liver was failing, {{and he was}} in {{considerable}} pain. A meeting was arranged for day 66 at noon with his supporters to show him the documents that were being faxed through by the Home Office regarding offers the government <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> make. It was agreed that, if there was any substance to them, Horne would call off the strike. Early on the morning of 10 December 1998, the 66th day of his hunger strike, Horne was moved out of hospital and back to Full Sutton Prison. The Home Office said that, because he was refusing treatment, {{there was no need for}} him to be in hospital. By now, Horne was hallucinating and could no longer remember why he was on hunger strike.|$|E
25|$|After the {{collapse}} of the German Sixth Army at Stalingrad, the Soviet counter-offensives, and the Battle of Kursk later in 1943, it became apparent that the tide of war was turning against Germany. Soviet forces were, all along the front, approaching the pre-war border. Partly because of Führer Directive No. 51, which funneled all new men and materials to the Western Front, to meet the expected Allied Invasion, issued on 3 November 1943, Axis forces along the Eastern Front were severely inadequately equipped in comparison to their Soviet opponents, reinforcements were rare, and reserves were stretched thin. Although in this directive Hitler implied that he <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> allow withdraws, trading space for time, this proved to be false. This, combined with Hitler's insistence on holding onto captured territory at all costs, made Soviet victories in 1944 nearly inevitable.|$|E

25|$|In early June 2008, the White House {{signaled}} the president <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> sign {{a modified version}} of the Webb bill, along with the war funding bill, if transferability between spouses and dependents was added onto the new GI Bill. This would make the benefits more valuable to career military personal that would like to pay for their spouse or child's education. On June 19, this provision was added to the war funding bill. With the added transferability provisions for continued military service, McCain said he now supported the bill, because it encouraged additional service beyond three years, mitigating his earlier concerns. McCain, who had not voted in the Senate since April 8, was campaigning in Ohio on June 26 and was not present for the final senate vote on the bill, which passed 92–6 (The only other senator not voting was Ted Kennedy, who was recovering after surgery to remove a brain tumor). Bush signed the war funding bill, along with the veterans education benefits, into law on June 30, 2008.|$|E
500|$|Thus, as {{he began}} {{recruiting}} supporters for an attack on slaveholders, Brown was joined by [...] "General Tubman", as he called her. Her knowledge of support networks and resources in the border states of Pennsylvania, Maryland and Delaware was invaluable to Brown and his planners. Although other abolitionists like Frederick Douglass and William Lloyd Garrison did not endorse his tactics, Brown dreamed of fighting {{to create a new}} state for freed slaves, and made preparations for military action. After he began the first battle, he believed, slaves would rise up and carry out a rebellion across the south. He asked Tubman to gather former slaves then living in present-day Southern Ontario who <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> join his fighting force, which she did.|$|E
500|$|Frederick Treves {{first met}} Merrick that November {{at a private}} viewing, before Norman opened the shop for the day.

[...] The viewing lasted no more than 15 minutes after which Treves returned to work. Later that day, he sent Tuckett back to the shop to ask if Merrick <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> come to the hospital for an examination. Norman and Merrick agreed. To enable him to travel the short distance without drawing undue attention, Merrick wore a costume consisting of an oversized black cloak and a brown cap with a burlap sack that covered his face, and rode in a cab hired by Treves.|$|E

500|$|In Chomsky's view, the {{invasion}} of Iraq by a U.S. and U.K. coalition must {{be seen in the}} wider context of the U.S. government's Imperial Grand Strategy. He claims that the Iraq invasion fits the three criteria that he has highlighted for being classified as a U.S. target for preventative war. Considering the country [...] "virtually defenseless" [...] against the superior might of the western armed forces, he also notes that securing control of the country would be an important move for the U.S. socio-economic elite, gaining unlimited access to the country's lucrative oil resources and asserting their own military might to intimidate other nations into compliance. He also argued that government and media propaganda also set out to forge an erroneous link between Iraq President Saddam Hussein and Al-Qaeda, playing on the American people's horror of the 9/11 attacks. Furthermore, he stated that they also wrongly claimed that the Iraqi government was developing weapons of mass destruction to be used against the U.S. or its allies. Chomsky remarks that the 2003 invasion of Iraq is particularly significant because it signals the [...] "new norm" [...] in international relations, and that in future the U.S. <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> wage a preventative war against [...] "Iran, Syria, the Andean region, and a number of others." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{hearing from}} {{immigrants}} how European strikers had used this tactic during prolonged strikes, Haywood {{decided to take}} the gamble in Lawrence, a first in American Labor history. [...] He and the IWW used announcements in socialist newspapers to solicit host families, then screened strikers to see who <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> send their children into the care of strangers. [...] On February 10, 1912, the first group of [...] "Lawrence Strike Children" [...] bid tearful goodbyes to their parents and, with chaperones to guide them, boarded a train for New York. [...] The children arrived safely in Manhattan that evening where they were taken to a Labor hall. [...] They were soon lavished with food and clothes and would stay in New York another seven weeks. [...] Despite their excellent treatment, officials in Lawrence and elsewhere were shocked by the move. [...] "I could scarcely believe that the strike leaders would do such a thing as this," [...] Lawrence mayor Michael Scanlon said. [...] "Lawrence could have very easily cared for these children." [...] Though also denounced in the press, the children's exodus gained widespread publicity and made the city of Lawrence look bad. [...] While police and the mayor allowed smaller contingents of children to leave on two more occasions, plans were made to crack down).|$|E
500|$|Either way, when Xerxes {{received}} this news, he ordered his fleet {{to go out}} on patrol off the coast Salamis, blocking the southern exit. Then, at dusk, he ordered them to withdraw, possibly in order to tempt the Allies into a hasty evacuation. That evening Themistocles now attempted what {{appears to have been a}} spectacularly successful use of disinformation. He sent a servant, Sicinnus, to Xerxes, with a message proclaiming that Themistocles was [...] "on the king's side and prefers that your affairs prevail, not the Hellenes". [...] Themistocles claimed that the Allied command was in-fighting, that the Peloponnesians were planning to evacuate that very night, and that to gain victory all the Persians need to do was to block the straits. In performing this subterfuge, Themistocles seems to have been trying to bring about exactly the opposite; to lure the Persian fleet into the Straits. This was exactly the kind of news that Xerxes wanted to hear; that the Athenians <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> submit to him, and that he would be able to destroy the rest of the Allied fleet. Xerxes evidently took the bait, and the Persian fleet was sent out that evening to effect this block. Xerxes ordered a throne to be set up on the slopes of Mount Aigaleo (overlooking the straits), in order to watch the battle from a clear vantage point, and so as to record the names of commanders who performed particularly well.|$|E

500|$|In an {{interview}} with The Atlas Society, Ross related that her approach to Eve was inspired by Ayn Rand's objectivist philosophy. She said that Eve was [...] "always willing to make sacrifices, and there's always somebody willing, as Ayn Rand said, to take any sacrifices you <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> make." [...] She compared Eve to Catherine Halsey in Rand's 1943 novel, The Fountainhead, particularly around {{the middle of the}} novel, before Catherine [...] "was completely destroyed". Ross described Eve as [...] "a self-sacrificing animal", and emphasized that her character was distinct from her own self-identification as an individualist. Ross said that her portrayal of Eve was also influenced by Eve White, a character with dissociative identity disorder played by Joanne Woodward in the 1957 film The Three Faces of Eve. The actress researched books on sociopaths and psychopaths to help her approach Eve's desire to hide her past at any cost. During the filming process, she kept a diary to help her better understand how to approach future scenes. Ross also used the 2001 novel [...] to inform her interpretation of Eve's past. She expressed surprise that Eve's relationship with Julian was [...] "a real short courtship" [...] that turned the character from [...] "the innocent girl to the woman on the Studio 54 dance floor having sex". After adjusting her perception of Eve's past, Ross chose to play the character's descent into drugs and prostitution as [...] "more immediate, wild and impulsive" [...] and [...] "very untamed and unrestrained".|$|E
