6000|$|April 2.--Spoke to-day the <b>magnetic</b> <b>cutter</b> {{in charge}} of the middle section of {{floating}} telegraph wires. I learn that when this species of telegraph was first put into operation by Horse, it was considered quite impossible to convey the wires over sea, but now we are at a loss to comprehend where the difficulty lay! So wags the world. Tempora mutantur--excuse me for quoting the Etruscan. What would we do without the Atalantic telegraph? (Pundit says Atlantic was the ancient adjective.) We lay to a few minutes to ask the cutter some questions, and learned, among other glorious news, that civil war is raging in Africa, while the plague is doing its good work beautifully both in Yurope and Ayesher. Is it not truly remarkable that, before the magnificent light shed upon philosophy by Humanity, the world was accustomed to regard War and Pestilence as calamities? Do you know that prayers were actually offered up in the ancient temples to the end that these evils (!) might not be visited upon mankind? Is it not really difficult to comprehend upon what principle of interest our forefathers acted? Were they so blind as not to perceive that the destruction of a myriad of individuals is only so much positive advantage to the mass! ...|$|E

50|$|Gakeen {{became one}} of the many super robot series to appear after the seminal works such as Mazinger and Getter Robo opened the {{floodgates}} to the genre. The robot was notable for its creative weaponry systems such as cutting fists, Gakeen fists, steel claws, bladed foot. Other specialties include magnetic onslaught, <b>magnetic</b> draw, arm <b>cutter,</b> laser beams, atomic hurricane. The show further extended the transformation into very long complex sequences that would become trendy for similar shows to follow.|$|R
2500|$|In 1926 Joseph P. Maxwell and Henry C. Harrison from Bell Telephone Laboratories {{disclosed}} that the recording {{pattern of the}} Western Electric [...] "rubber line" [...] <b>magnetic</b> disc <b>cutter</b> had a constant velocity characteristic. This meant that as frequency increased in the treble, recording amplitude decreased. Conversely, in the bass as frequency decreased, recording amplitude increased. Therefore, {{it was necessary to}} attenuate the bass frequencies below about 250Hz, the bass turnover point, in the amplified microphone signal fed to the recording head. Otherwise, bass modulation became excessive and overcutting took place into the next record groove. When played back electrically with a magnetic pickup having a smooth response in the bass region, a complementary boost in amplitude at the bass turnover point was necessary. G. H. Miller in 1934 reported that when complementary boost at the turnover point was used in radio broadcasts of records, the reproduction was more realistic and many of the musical instruments stood out in their true form.|$|R
