50|$|The X305 was {{equipped}} with an On-Board Diagnostics System. However, it failed to fully meet the OBD-II specifications, which became mandatory for the 1996 model year in the US. With a special dispensation for that model year expired, no 1997 model year X305 models were sold in North America. In 2001, the United States EPA and Jaguar Cars entered into a settlement which extended the emissions warranty on 1995 and 1996 model year XJ12 sedans to 14 years or 150,000 miles, due to their non-compliant NipponDenso Engine Management System, which was unable to provide continuous <b>misfire</b> <b>monitoring,</b> a requirement for OBDII compliance.|$|E

They sold 500,000 {{vehicles}} {{with a combination of}} carburettor and digital ignition that uses different strategies for laboratory or street driving conditions. In 1998, Honda Motor Company had to spend $267 million to correct the disabling of the <b>misfire</b> <b>monitoring</b> device on 1.6 million 1996 and 1997 model year vehicles, and Ford Motor Company paid $7.8 million for programming 60,000 1997 Ford Econoline vans to keep emissions low during the 20-minute EPA test routine, and then disabling the emissions controls during normal highway cruising.|$|E
40|$|EWMA for Mean and Variance EWMA for Mean and Variance. doc 2 06 / 23 / 02 A Bayesian EWMA for Mean and Variance We obtain {{simultaneous}} exponentially weighted moving averages (EWMAs) for {{mean and}} variance as the Bayesian prior {{for the next}} noisy observation of a normal random walk, where the information (reciprocal variance) of migration and noise have a common factor whose reciprocal follows a gamma-beta random walk. This procedure has applications in finance {{as an alternative to}} the popular ARCH / GARCH models, in addition to physical processes such as wear out and automotive <b>misfire</b> <b>monitoring.</b> The procedure is derived by applying Bayesian sequential updating (1. Observation, 2. Transition) ...|$|E
