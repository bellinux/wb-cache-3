On this deployment the 111th Fighter Squadron flew 348 tasked sorties, plus six no-notice Close Air Support (CAS) alert scrambles and four short-notice (less than 30 minute & not on the ATO) pre-planned alert launches. With an average combat sortie lasting almost 4.42 hours, the unit accumulated a total of 1537.1 combat hours. <b>Maintenance</b> <b>delivery</b> effectiveness for this deployment was an astonishing 102% due to the inclusion of the unscheduled CAS scrambles.

Fir tended the lightships at Umatilla Reef off La Push, Washington and Swiftsure Bank at the entrance of the Strait of Juan de Fuca Washington. In addition to servicing aids to navigation (ATON), Fir stood war duties during World War II, performed search and rescue missions, marine environmental protection, and law enforcement. For her last project, Fir was tasked to do what she was originally built for in 1939. In July 1991, Fir renovated and restored the Cape Flattery Lighthouse on Tatoosh Island at the entrance to the Strait of Juan de Fuca.|$|E

40|$|The main {{aim of this}} {{research}} was to inform the development of policy to support implementation of the Water Environment and Water Services (Scotland) Act 2003 and the Flood Risk Management (Scotland) Act (2009). Surface water management in urban areas is increasingly important in policy areas concerned with flooding and pollution, in addition to these policy areas benefits can be realised in health and well-being (through green space provision or improvement), in traffic management, in operation and <b>maintenance</b> <b>delivery</b> (and cost savings) for urban areas, and in biodiversity and climate change planning. Therefore to support guidance on surface water management there is a need to: 1. Develop integrated tools that are relevant to understanding sources, pathways and mitigation of diffuse contaminants. 2. Critically assess which methods best identify sources and pathways for a given urban environment and/or readily available information. 3. Identify mitigation strategies, from source to end-of-pipe that meet the twin challenge of diffuse pollution prevention and multiple benefits in terms of cost, energy and water sustainability. ...|$|E
40|$|While Total Productive Maintenance TPM {{has been}} {{promoted}} for its simplicity and its benefits to the <b>maintenance</b> <b>delivery</b> system, both the academic and practitioner literature has failed to identify the contextual issues that influence TPM adoption. This paper explores the contextual differences of plants to better understand what types of companies have adopted TPM programs. We propose a theoretical framework for understanding the use of TPM and how it depends on managerial... factors such as Just-in-Time JIT, Total Quality Management TQM and Employee Involvement EI as well as environmental and organizational factors such as country, industry and company characteristics. We test this framework using data from 97 plants in three different countries to determine what types of companies {{are most likely to}} aggressively pursue TPM practices. We find that specific contextual variables explain {{a significant portion of the}} variance in the level of TPM implementation. Our results indicate that while environmental contextual factors, such as country, help to explain differences in TPM implementation, managerial contextual factors, which are under the direction of plant management, are more important to the execution of TPM programs.
