50|$|Commercial {{production}} machining {{now makes}} use of increasingly advanced chucks which have not only indexable positioning but also indexable clamping. Both functions are typically hydraulically controlled. The clamping is often done with each pair of jaws consisting of one fixed jaw and one <b>movable</b> <b>jaw</b> (hydraulically actuated), thematically similar to advanced milling vises. This method of clamping brings the high precision and repeatability of such vises to a chucking application. Such chucks offer the centering precision of traditional independent-jaw chucks with the chucking speed and ease of traditional three-jaw self-centering scroll chucks. They have expensive initial cost (compared with traditional chucks), but such initial cost pays for itself and then lowers ongoing marginal costs in commercial production-run environments.|$|E

The animal is 20 to 30 mm (40 mm max) in length and has a head, gills, brain, notochord, well developed musculature, heart and circulatory system. It has a bent caudal projection of the notochord that might be a primitive tail fin. It might have a pair of lateral eyes.

40|$|Introduction: Children {{have been}} known to {{spend most of their time}} at school. They learn their sitting habits in this period of time. Incorrect sitting postures and {{inappropriate}} school furniture can result in abnormalities in the vertebral column, back pain, neck pain, Fatigue and discomfort. Hence, this study was aimed to examine the match between students’ body dimensions and existing benches and desks dimensions in Hamadan female primary schools.. Material and Method: In this study, 624 students of Hamadan female primary schools were investigated and some of their anthropometric dimensions including shoulder height, elbow height, knee height, popliteal height, popliteal-buttock length and hip breadth were measured. In this sense, a chair (with adjustable height, depth and elbow support) and a caliper with <b>movable</b> <b>jaw</b> were used for measurement of anthropometric dimensions. The measurements were performed in a way that thighs were in full contact with the seat, there was a right angle between the thighs and legs, the feet were in full contact with the movable pedal, the trunk was straight and the back and hips were in full contact with the backrest. Following, the match of the dimensions of existing benches and desks with the appropriate dimensions (based on the students’ anthropometric dimensions) were examined.. Result: The results showed that the seat height, seat depth, seat width, back rest height, desk height, underneath desk height were in acceptable rangefor 10. 1 %, 17. 3 %, 5. 6 %, 53. 5 %, 1. 9 % and 31. 1 % of students, respectively..

40|$|Flash {{butt welding}} {{is a well}} {{established}} economical process for solid state butt welding. It consists indirect electrical heating of {{the ends of the}} work pieces to be welded and forging them together. While heating, a thermal distribution characterized by a steep temperature gradient is established along the axial length of the pieces. Flash butt welding is widely used for steel band welding m wheel industry. Major advantages are economical in operation, suitable for mass production and high in joint strength. Loadstar (pvt) Ltd has six flash butt machines in different production lines for rim and band manufacturing. The major problem is considerably high amount of scrap percentage due to welding cracks. This problem severely affects the lines which have severe forming or stretching operations in latter stages. For this investigation the line 05 was selected which has high scrap percentage. The main aim {{of this study is to}} analyze the flash butt welding cracks in rim manufacturing and to find out the main reasons for the defects. The analysis of flash butt welding cracks in nm manufacturing is done m five stages. In the first stage, attention is paid to literature survey, in which the present stage of the researches carried out in the industry regarding the flash butt welding is discussed. Only few literature sources are available although there are many wheel manufacturing companies- [...] in the world. Certainly there might be a lot of researches carried out under this topic in the history,' but due to high competitiveness among the companies the research outcomes might be kept as company secrets. In this project, the analysis of flash butt welding cracks in wheel manufacturing will be discussed in detail. The second stage is process description.. and principles of flash butt welding. Third stage is problem identification and the fourth stage is methodology to solve the problem. In methodology it has stated that the identified process' variables that affect the welding quality and how further testing are carried out.
