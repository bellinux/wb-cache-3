25|$|In 1991, a {{small group}} of OutRage! members covertly formed a {{separate}} group to engage in a campaign of outing public figures who were homophobic in public but gay in private. The group took the name FROCS (Faggots Rooting Out Closeted Sexuality).

25|$|Petraeus had a {{strategy}} to influence military conditions by using the press relations effectively in the theater and in Washington, according to critics of the general's military career after his fall from power. On November 13, 2012, Reagan administration Assistant Secretary of Defense Lawrence Korb, C.I.A. analyst and Veteran Intelligence Professionals for Sanity co-founder Ray McGovern, and investigative journalist Gareth Porter appeared on Al Jazeera English. Together they assessed the general's extensive military-medi{{a strategy}} linking his writings on counterguerrilla operations and subsequent military media efforts, to his downfall with his female biographer. Critics said that the Petraeus media strategy would prove damaging for American policy in the future because of omissions and distorted interpretations that Washington policymakers, other experts, and the American public accepted from Petraeus's <b>media</b> <b>contacts.</b>|$|E
