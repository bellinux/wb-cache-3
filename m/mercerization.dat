50|$|<b>Mercerization</b> is a {{treatment}} for cotton fabric and thread that gives fabric or yarns a lustrous appearance and strengthens them. The process is applied to cellulosic materials like cotton or hemp. A further possibility is mercerizing during which the fabric is treated with sodium hydroxide solution to cause swelling of the fibres. This results in improved lustre, strength and dye affinity. Cotton is mercerized under tension, and all alkali must be washed out before the tension is released or shrinkage will take place. Mercerizing can take place directly on greige cloth, or after bleaching.|$|E
5000|$|Older designs, {{especially}} {{through the}} early 1900s, tend to use fine white or ivory thread (50 to 100 widths to the inch) and intricate designs. Often they were constructed of small pieces 10 cm or less in diameter, which were then tied to each other to form a larger piece — a shawl, veil or umbrella, for example. This thread was either made of silk or a silk blend, to allow for improper stitches to be easily removed. The <b>mercerization</b> process strengthened cotton threads and spread their use in tatting. Newer designs from the 1920s and onward often use thicker thread {{in one or more}} colors, as well as newer joining methods, {{to reduce the number of}} thread ends to be hidden. The best thread for tatting is a [...] "hard" [...] thread that does not untwist readily. Cordonnet thread is a common tatting thread; Perl cotton is an example of a beautiful cord that is nonetheless a bit loose for tatting purposes. Some tatting designs incorporate ribbons and beads.|$|E

30|$|Alkaline {{treatment}} of cellulose, called <b>mercerization,</b> {{is one of}} the well-known treatments that induce the conversion of cellulose I. In the <b>mercerization</b> process, alkaline solution penetrates between cellulose chains to form a complex of cellulose, alkaline ions and water molecules. After washing with water, alkaline ions are washed away, yielding a cellulose hydrate called Na-cellulose IV. On drying, Na-cellulose IV is converted to the final structure of <b>mercerization,</b> cellulose II [6, 7]. Several studies on the hydrolysis efficiency of mercerized cellulose have been reported [8 – 10]. We have recently reported that mercerized cellulose, especially Na-cellulose IV, exhibits much higher degradability than cellulose I [11, 12]. Alkaline treatment, as a useful pre{{treatment of}} lignocellulosic biomass to remove hemicellulose and lignin, has also been studied. Although the concentration of alkaline solution used in these pretreatments is generally too low to induce <b>mercerization,</b> we nonetheless applied the same treatment, but with concentrated alkaline solution that could induce <b>mercerization</b> of cellulose to lignocellulosic biomass, bagasse, as cellulose samples [12]. The results of the study suggested that the alkaline treatment could lead to <b>mercerization</b> of cellulose in bagasse {{at the same time as}} the removal of hemicellulose and lignin, which indicates a significant improvement in enzymatic degradability.|$|E

In this thesis an extended <b>mercerization</b> stage of a spruce ether pulp was investigated where the parameters studied were the ratio of cellulose I and II, concentration of alkali, temperature and retention time. The influence of the <b>mercerization</b> stage conditions on the etherification stage, were evaluated as the degree of substitution (DS) of the resulting CMC and the filterability of CMC dissolved in water at a concentration of 1 %. The DS results suggested that the NaOH concentration in the <b>mercerization</b> stage was the most important of the parameters studied. When the NaOH concentration in the <b>mercerization</b> step was low (9 %), a high cellulose II content in the pulp used was found to have no negative impact on the DS of the resulting CMC compared with pulps with only cellulose I. However, when the NaOH concentration was high (27. 5 %), pulps with high content of cellulose II showed a lower reactivity than those with only cellulose I with respect to the DS of the CMC obtained after a given charge of NaMCA. The results obtained from the filtration ability study of CMC water solutions suggested that both the amount of cellulose II in the original pulp and the temperature had a negative influence on the filtration ability whereas the NaOH concentration in the <b>mercerization</b> stage had a positive influence. The filtration ability was assumed to be influenced highly by the presence of poorly reacted cellulose segments. A retention time between 1 - 48 h in the <b>mercerization</b> stage had no effect on either the DS or the filtration ability of the CMC. Using NIR FT Raman spectroscopy molecular structures of CMC and its gel fraction were analyzed with respect to the conditions used in the extended <b>mercerization</b> stage. Here {{it was found that the}} alkaline concentration had a very strong influence on the following etherification reaction. FT Raman spectra of CMC samples and their gel fractions prepared with low NaOH concentrations (9 %) in the <b>mercerization</b> stage indicated an incomplete transformation of cellulose to Na-cellulose before carboxymethylation to CMC. Low average DS values of the CMC, i. e. between 0. 42 and 0. 50, were yielded. Such CMC dissolved in water caused very thick and semi solid gum-like gels, probably due to an uneven distribution of substituting groups along the cellulose backbone. FT Raman spectra of CMC mercerized with alkaline concentrations at 18. 25 and 27. 5 % in the <b>mercerization</b> stage indicated, however, that all of the cellulose molecules were totally transferred to CMC of high DS, i. e. between 0. 88 and 1. 05.

The irreversible modification studied here was the preparation of carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) using extended <b>mercerization</b> of a spruce dissolving pulp. More specifically the parameters studied were the effect of <b>mercerization</b> at different proportions of cellulose I and II in the dissolving pulp, the concentration of alkali, the temperature and the reaction time. The parameters evaluated were the degree of substitution, the filterability and the amount of gel obtained when the resulting CMC was dissolved in water. Molecular structures of CMC and its gel fractions were analysed by using NIR FT Raman spectroscopy. It was found that the alkali concentration in the <b>mercerization</b> stage had an extensive influence on the subsequent etherification reaction. FT Raman spectra of CMC samples and their gel fractions prepared with low NaOH concentrations (9 %) in the <b>mercerization</b> stage indicated an incomplete transformation of cellulose to Na-cellulose before carboxymethylation to CMC. Low average DS values of the CMC, i. e. between 0. 42 and 0. 50 were obtained. Such CMC dissolved in water resulted in very thick and semi solid gum-like gels, probably due to an uneven distribution of substituents along the cellulose backbone. FT Raman spectra of CMC samples and their gel fractions mercerized at higher alkaline concentration, i. e. 18. 25 and 27. 5 % in the <b>mercerization</b> stage, indicated on the other hand a complete transformation of cellulose to Na-cellulose before carboxymethylation to CMC. Higher average DS values of the CMC, i. e. between 0. 88 and 1. 05 were therefore obtained. When dissolved in water such CMC caused gel formation especially when prepared from dissolving pulp with a high fraction of cellulose II. The reversible modification studied was the dissolution of cellulose in NaOH/ZnO. Here the effect of enzyme pretreatment was investigated by using two mono-component enzymes; namely xylanase and endoglucanase, used in consecutive stages. It was found that although the crystallinity and the specific surface area of the dissolving pulp sustained minimal change during the enzymatic treatment; the solubility of pulp increased in a NaOH/ZnO solution from 29 % for untreated pulp up to 81 % for enzymatic pretreated pulp.

Results showed that ultrasound wave pretreatment was more efficient for the in-situ composition compared to the <b>mercerization</b> pretreatment. The amount of magnetic particles (valued as mass fraction of Fe) for untreated, ultrasound wave treated and <b>mercerization</b> treated cellulose fibers were 6. 70 %, 7. 67 % and 3. 14 %, respectively.

This study aimed to examine the use of sisal pulp in the production of bioethanol, which can potentially be a high efficiency process because of the cellulose content of this fiber. A previous paper addressed the hydrolysis of sisal pulp using sulfuric acid as a catalyst. In the present study, the influence of the <b>mercerization</b> process on the acid hydrolysis of sisal pulp was evaluated. <b>Mercerization</b> was achieved in a 20 % wt NaOH solution, and the cellulosic pulp was suspended and vigorously mixed for 1, 2 and 3 h, at 50 A degrees C. The previously characterized mercerized pulps were hydrolyzed (100 A degrees C, 30 % H 2 SO 4, v/v), and the results are compared with those obtained for unmercerized pulp (described in a companion paper). The starting sample was characterized by viscometry, alpha-cellulose content, crystallinity index and scanning electron microscopy. During the reactions, aliquots were withdrawn, and the liquor was analyzed by HPLC. The residual pulps (non-hydrolyzed) were also characterized by the techniques described for the initial sample. The results revealed that pretreatment decreases the polyoses content as well as causes a decrease of up to 23 % in the crystallinity and up to 21 % in the average molar mass of cellulose after 3 h of <b>mercerization.</b> The <b>mercerization</b> process proved to be very important to achieve the final target.

Textile industry of Pakistan is the major consumer of produced high grade caustic soda; as the presence of any impurities especially dissolved salts and metals is unfavorable for wet processing of cotton. This study investigates the performance of three different local brands of caustic soda intended for use in textile wet processing of cotton fabric specifically for <b>mercerization</b> process. The brands were selected based on their purity grades. The selected caustic soda samples were chemically analyzed for the presence of impurities. Twenty seven cotton fabric samples (nine samples of each brand) were prepared by <b>mercerization</b> in slack state. The cotton fabric samples were tested for changes in surface morphology, tensile strength (warp and weft), tear strength, air permeability and K/S (Colour Strength). The results were analyzed using one-way ANOVA (Analysis of Variance) to ascertain the statistical equivalence within and between the tested brands. The results showed no significant differences across the tested brands at a 95...|$|E
30|$|A 5  N NaOH {{solution}} {{was used to}} convert the crystal structure of native cellulose according to the precious study [12], but NaOH solutions of lower concentrations such as 3  N and 4  N NaOH solutions would also induce <b>mercerization</b> at least partly. In addition, these changes in the chemical composition and the crystal structure also depend on the particle size of the samples, thus the samples with smaller particle sizes such as nano-sized particles may be more affected by the alkaline treatment.|$|E
30|$|Pulverized {{samples of}} wood, cedar and {{eucalyptus}} {{were treated with}} 5  N NaOH solutions at 25 – 150  °C. Hemicellulose and lignin content in the samples decreased with increasing treatment temperatures, while the recovery of glucose was maintained at nearly 90  %. X-ray diffraction analysis showed that {{the content of the}} original cellulose I structure in the samples decreased with increasing temperature, and most of the cellulose in the sample treated at 150  °C was converted to cellulose II by <b>mercerization.</b> Enzymatic hydrolysis of the alkaline-treated samples was carried out at 37  °C using solutions comprising a mixture of cellulase and β-glucosidase. The samples treated at higher temperatures showed better enzymatic degradability. Treatment with an alkaline solution of lower concentration (1  N NaOH) at 150  °C was also used. Despite significant quantities of hemicellulose and lignin being removed, <b>mercerization</b> was not induced. The enzymatic degradability was much lower than that of the sample treated with a 5  N NaOH solution at 150  °C. Thus, treatment with concentrated alkaline solution at high temperature led to not only the removal of hemicellulose and lignin, but also to modification of the cellulose structure, which resulted in high efficiency of enzymatic saccharification of the wood samples.|$|E
40|$|Crystal {{structure}} and mechanical properties of cellulose fibers were studied {{to investigate the}} effect of chemical treatment on the fiber. Pretreatment by acetone extraction, <b>mercerization</b> with 3 - 20 % wt/v sodium hydroxide (NaOH), and acrylonitrile (AN) grafting initiated by azo-bis-isobutylonitrile were performed. From Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and wide-angle X-ray diffraction quantitative measurements, the pretreated fibers showed an induced slight decrease of crystallinity index. The structural transformation of the fibers from cellulose I to cellulose 11 was observed at high NaOH concentration of 10 - 20 % wt/v. The amount of grafting, 1. 56, 2. 94, 6. 04, 8. 34, or 10. 46 %, was dependent upon the initiator concentration and the volume of monomer in the reactor. The AN grafted fibers had no transformation of crystalline structure as observed after <b>mercerization.</b> Only a variation of X-ray crystallinity index with grafting amount was observed. Moisture regain of pretreated and modified fibers depended {{on the structure of}} the fiber and the amount of grafting. The mechanical properties performed by a single fiber test method were strongly influenced by the cellulose structure, lateral index of crystallinity, and fraction of grafting. Scanning electron microscopy was used for analysis of surface morphologies of treated fibers...|$|E
40|$|The present work introduces, for {{the first}} time worldwide, {{molasses}} as an additive in papermaking. The resulting paper composites exhibit greater breaking length and remarkably higher water uptake (WRV) in comparison to paper, which did not involve molasses as an additive. Previous studies, by the author and others, have shown that incorporating the cell wall microstructure of cellulose fibers with sucrose greatly enhanced the breaking length and water uptake of paper. Also, it is well established in the literature that using gums (including starch) as additives in papermaking enhances the strength of paper. Molasses contains both sucrose and gums (including starch). Molasses is a byproduct of sugar industry, which is cheaper than sucrose; and a major part of sucrose lost in sugar industry resides in molasses. Therefore, molasses was chosen as a new additive in this work. The effect of <b>mercerization</b> of pulp fibers before loading them with molasses is, also, studied in this work; and <b>mercerization</b> is shown to greatly enhance the positive effects produced by loading with molasses. Paper composites produced in this work find their use as specialty absorbent paper. The present work shows that the benefits obtained by using molasses are close to the benefits obtained in the case of using the more expensive additive sucrose...|$|E
40|$|Microcrystalline {{cellulose}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} useful fillers for direct compression. Cellulose in general consists of an amorphous part and a crystalline part, which can exist in two polymorphic forms: cellulose I and cellulose II. UICEL (University of Iowa cellulose) is a cellulose II product and can be obtained by <b>mercerization</b> (chemical treatment with sodium hydroxide) from Avicel PH 102 ®, a microcrystalline cellulose, which contains the cellulose I polymorph. X-ray measurements of the two substances confirmed the different polymorphic forms and demonstrated a higher degree of crystallinity for Avicel PH 102 ® (73...|$|E
40|$|Pretreatment of sawdust using a {{combination}} of sodium hydroxide (NaOH) and monochloroacetic acid (MCA) was investigated for the formation of reducing sugars. Optimum conditions for the pretreatment process were determined by the amount of reducing sugars formed during the enzymatic hydrolysis of the pretreated substrate. It was found that <b>mercerization</b> by NaOH {{played an important role in}} increasing the degree of substitution (DS) and that the maximum solubility was achieved during the etherification by MCA. A maximum amount of 34. 2 % lignin was removed in the process. As the DS of the substrate was increased, the efficiency of the hydrolysis process increased, leading to the higher yield of reducing sugars. The optimum operating conditions for the pretreatment process were determined to be 75 oC at 90 rpm for 4 hours (2 hours for <b>mercerization</b> plus 2 hours for etherification). Under these operating conditions, with 1 % (w/v) NaOH and 2 % (w/w) MCA loading, a maximum DS of 0. 2 and a solubility of 10. 3 % was attained. At 75 oC and after 48 hours of the hydrolysis process, cellulases from Aspergillus niger resulted in the production of 2. 88 g/L of glucose with a yield of 62. 72 % reducing sugars. X-ray diffraction (XRD) revealed reduced crystallinity of the sawdust and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) showed distortion of the structure after pretreatment...|$|E
