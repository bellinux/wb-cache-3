2500|$|The U.S. Post Office also {{adopted the}} DH-4 to carry air mail. [...] The Service {{acquired}} 100 {{of them from}} the army in 1918, and retrofitted them to make them safer, denominating them as the DH.4B. [...] In 1919, the DH-4B was standardised by the US Post Office, being modified to be flown from the rear cockpit with a 400lb (180kg) watertight <b>mail</b> <b>compartment</b> replacing the forward cockpit. The airmail DH-4B were later modified with revised landing gear and an enlarged rudder. DH-4s were used to establish a coast-to-coast, transcontinental airmail service, between San Francisco and New York, a distance of 2,680mi (4,310km), involving night flight, the first services starting on 21 August 1924. The DH-4 continued in Post Office service until 1927, when the last airmail routes were passed to private contractors.|$|E

The second car weighed just [...] in total.|$|R
50|$|The Avia 51 was a three-engined high-wing {{cantilever}} monoplane {{designed for}} the Czech national airlines CLS. It was built with a duraluminium monocoque fuselage and a fixed tailwheel landing gear. Powered by three Avia Rk.12 radial engines, two were fitted into the leading edges of the wing and one was nose-mounted. It had a two-man flight deck and an enclosed luxury cabin {{for five or six}} passengers which was not large enough to stand up (5 ft 1in), but did have a separate lavatory compartment, it also had three luggage and <b>mail</b> <b>compartments.</b>|$|R

5000|$|The Contract Air Mail Act of 1925 set out {{the gradual}} {{privatization}} of the Post Office's Air Mail routes. In late 1926, bids were requested for the main transcontinental trunk mail route, {{which was to be}} split into eastern and western sections, with Boeing bidding for the western section. Boeing revived the design for the tender, with the Model 40A replacing the Liberty engine with a [...] air-cooled Pratt & Whitney Wasp radial engine, which was 200 lb lighter than the Liberty, ignoring the weight of the Liberty's radiator and cooling water. The fuselage was redesigned to make more extensive use of welded steel tubing, and an enclosed cabin was fitted between the <b>mail</b> <b>compartments,</b> allowing two passengers to be carried as well as 1200 lb of mail. Boeing's bid of $3 per lb was much less than any of the competing bids, and Boeing was awarded the San Francisco to Chicago contract in January 1927, building 24 Model 40As for the route (with a further aircraft being used as a testbed by Pratt & Whitney).|$|R

5000|$|For {{extraordinary}} achievement while piloting {{air mail}} plane No. NC-13767 {{on a flight}} from Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, to Dallas, Texas, on January 29, 1936. Despite {{the fact that the}} weather reports indicated that the trip could be made, Pilot Kincannon encountered snow and later icing conditions. Ice formation on the carburetor reduced engine efficiency, necessitating a forced landing. Reports of the passengers indicate that under these trying circumstances, Pilot Kincannon did not become excited. He flashed the electric sign warning all passengers to fasten their seat belts and selected the best available place for landing. Most of the reports indicate that Pilot Kincannon deliberately selected a small clump of trees which could be utilized to break the fall, and maneuvered the plane so that the shock of the landing was absorbed by {{the front end of the}} fuselage and the left wing, thus protecting the passengers and <b>mail</b> <b>compartments</b> even though it would endanger him in his location in the front cockpit where the impact would be greatest. None of the five passengers on the plane which was a single-motor type, was injured seriously. Pilot Kincannon, however, was fatally injured.|$|R
50|$|Following the French government's {{acquisition}} of F-ANPY (see above), they ordered a fourth Comet, F-ANPZ, with a <b>mail</b> <b>compartment</b> in the nose. It was later taken on charge by the French Air Force before being destroyed in a hangar fire at Istres in France in June 1940.|$|E

50|$|A {{batch of}} ten ESBV {{carriages}} {{were built in}} 1909-1910, generally to the standard E design but with around half the carriage devoted to mail sorting for use on express trains on runs such as Melbourne to Bendigo, among others. The cars had two seats at one end opposite the male lavatory, one smoking, three standard and one ladies' compartment for a total seating capacity of 41 passengers; the latter compartment had {{direct access to the}} ladies' lavatory from within the compartment at the expense of one seat. The ladies lavatory was directly opposite a staff lavatory which joined onto the staff-only <b>mail</b> sorting <b>compartment,</b> which was a little under 30 feet long. This compartment contained a sorting desk with a pintsch-gas heated wax pot (for letter sealing), a cupboard, four seats and thirty-four pigeon holes on one side, and a framework for storage of sixty mail bags on the other. Besides the inter-carriage diaphragms the <b>mail</b> sorting <b>compartment</b> was only accessible by a sliding door {{on each side of the}} carriage, much like those on DVE vans. ESBV 6 through 10 were slightly different internally compared to ESBV 1 through 5 - if looking from the mail sorting area towards the passenger area the corridor would have been on the right, rather than the left as in the first five cars.|$|R
5000|$|Rail cars {{designed}} to sort and distribute mail while rolling were soon introduced. RMS employees sorted mail [...] "on-the-fly" [...] during the journey, and became {{some of the}} most skilled workers in the postal service. An RMS sorter {{had to be able to}} separate the <b>mail</b> quickly into <b>compartments</b> based on its final destination, before the first destination arrived, and work at the rate of 600 pieces of mail an hour. They were tested regularly for speed and accuracy.|$|R
5000|$|The NiD 740 was {{specifically}} {{designed as a}} postal aircraft for the night mail, though the <b>mail</b> <b>compartment</b> could alternatively accommodate three passengers. It was a three engined, wooden aircraft with a cantilever high wing of high aspect ratio and elliptical plan out to pointed tips. [...] Mounted without dihedral, the plywood skinned wing was structurally and aerodynamically similar to, though larger than, that of the single-engined Nieuport-Delage NiD 640. Long, narrow, uncompensated ailerons filled much of the trailing edges.|$|E
50|$|For {{extraordinary}} achievement while piloting {{air mail}} plane No. C-741 {{on the night}} of March 2, 1931, on a flight from Seattle, Wash. To San Diego, Calif. when about nine miles south of Glide, Oregon, about 11 p.m., Pilot Tyler discovered that smoke was coming from the underside of the plane {{in the vicinity of the}} <b>mail</b> <b>compartment.</b> The smoke was almost immediately followed by flames. The plane at the time was over a mountainous region and the nearest clearing the pilot remembered was in the vicinity of Glide. He returned to it and landed the plane in a clump of small pliant trees. The wings were caught by the trees and were torn from the body of the plane. This served to break the force of the landing so that the passengers were not seriously injured. One passenger received a few cuts about the face and another burned his hands slightly in handling a hot fire extinguisher. Pilot Tyler helped the passengers from the plane and with their assistance removed the mall load of 319 pounds from the plane. The burning pouches were thrown into the swampy ground which extinguished the fire and saved the mail except for charred edges and water damage. The fire in the <b>mail</b> <b>compartment</b> of the plane was then quenched with fire extinguishers and the water in the swampy area in which the plane landed.|$|E
5000|$|The DB-80 {{was aimed}} at the airmail market and was a single engine, high wing {{aircraft}} giving easy access by two port-side doors to a well lit cabin with two passenger seats and to a separate <b>mail</b> <b>compartment</b> behind them. The pilot sat ahead of the passengers under the wing leading edge. Two differently engined versions were built: the DB-80 had a [...] Hispano-Suiza 6P six cylinder, upright water-cooled inline and the DB-81 a [...] Lorraine 5Pc five cylinder radial engine. The latter was mounted on a hinged frame for easy servicing. The Hispano engined had a Lamblin radiator on the fuselage underside.|$|E
25|$|Maximum comfort was {{required}} for passengers and crew: the Kent's passenger cabin was 8ft 6 in (2.59 m) wide and 14ft (4.27 m) long. The seating was arranged in four rows of facing pairs, with a centre aisle, Pullman-style. The steward's pantry, situated {{on the port side}} aft of the passenger cabin, was equipped with twin-burner oil stoves on which stewards (and the valets of valued passengers) could cook meals in flight. The toilet and washroom were opposite the pantry; the <b>mail</b> and freight <b>compartment</b> was further aft.|$|R
5000|$|Traffic {{had started}} with two small steam {{locomotives}} E 2/2 1 and 2 and in 1917 a steam motor coach joined them. This unique FZm 1/2 11 had <b>mail</b> and baggage <b>compartments.</b> 1961-1963 these three vehicles {{reached the end}} of their lives and were replaced by used SBB E 3/3 [...] "Tigerli". The first two of them (3 ex 8477 and 4 ex 8488) had soon to be replaced by two others (5 ex 8479 and 8522). 1960-64 a leased tramway-type ("Glaskasten") Ed 2/2 from VHB was in use. E 3/3 5 and 8522 were kept as replacements for the new diesel.|$|R
2500|$|By policy, the USPS is {{reluctant}} to establish direct to door delivery to new addresses, and now requires special approvals to initiate this service (Postal Operations Manual, Section 631.2) Instead, the USPS has insisted upon centralized mail delivery in virtually all newly constructed residential housing developments, condominiums, and gated communities by requiring or incentivizing the builder or developer to install larger NDCBU (Neighborhood Delivery Collection Box Unit) stations. CBUs and NDCBUs are both commonly known as cluster mailboxes. [...] The NDCBU is a centralized community <b>mail</b> station with <b>compartments</b> for the centralized delivery of mail to multiple recipients at multiple addresses within a single neighborhood development or community.|$|R
50|$|Following a {{requirement}} for a passenger and mail carrier for the Australian company Larkin Aircraft Supply Company Limited an order was placed for a monoplane airliner designed by George H. Handasyde known as the Handasyde H.2. Handasyde, having no factory of their own, contracted Air Navigation and Engineering to build the aircraft on their behalf. Larkin had decided that the H.2 monoplane could not operate {{in the heat of}} Australia, and transferred the contract to supply a new airliner to A.N.E.C. Three ANEC III aircraft were built. The new design was an unequal-span biplane with a Rolls Royce Eagle IX engine. The pilot sat in the open above the <b>mail</b> <b>compartment,</b> with space for six passengers or cargo inside the fuselage.|$|E
50|$|A Seapost was a <b>mail</b> <b>compartment</b> aboard an {{ocean-going vessel}} in which {{international}} exchange mail was distributed. The first USA service {{of this type}} was the U.S.-German Seapost, which began operating in 1891 on the S.S. Havel North German Lloyd Line. This service rapidly expanded with routes to Great Britain, Central America, South America, and Asia. The Seapost service still employed fifty-five clerks in early 1941. The last route of this type (to South America) was terminated October 19, 1941, due to unsafe wartime conditions on the Atlantic Ocean. The few remaining Seapost clerks transferred to other branches of the Railway Mail Service (RMS). Seapost operations for the Post Office Department were supervised from a New York City, New York, office.|$|E
50|$|The United States Post Office {{had been}} running the air mail service since 1918 mainly using {{variants}} of the de Havilland DH.4 biplane. In 1925, it decided to modernize and placed an order with Douglas for a replacement aircraft based on the Douglas O-2 observation biplane. The company modified an O-2 by covering over the forward cockpit to make a <b>mail</b> <b>compartment</b> and moving the pilot into {{what had been the}} observer's cockpit. The aircraft was designated the DAM-1 (Douglas Air-Mail-One) but this was soon shortened to M-1. The M-1 used the same Liberty engine as the DH.4, which was available in large numbers. Small modifications were made to the exhaust system to keep fumes away from the pilot and the design was considered a success, but was not ordered into production.|$|E
5000|$|The U.S. Post Office also {{adopted the}} DH-4 to carry air mail. [...] The Service {{acquired}} 100 {{of them from}} the army in 1918, and retrofitted them to make them safer, denominating them as the DH.4B.

The DH-4 continued in Post Office service until 1927, when the last airmail routes were passed to private contractors.|$|E
5000|$|Its {{one-piece}} fuselage {{was built}} on four spruce longerons interconnected by frames and was plywood covered, giving it flat sides and underside but with curved upper decking. The NiD 740's central [...] Salmson 7Ac seven-cylinder radial engine was uncowled in the nose, though diagrams show it enclosed by a narrow-chord cowling. The outboard pair, also uncowled, were mounted well below the wing on parallel and diagonal struts. [...] The enclosed cockpit was at the wing leading edge; {{in addition to the}} normal forward and side windows there was a window in the port side fuselage, matched by one in the starboard side door, to improve his downwards and rearward view. The navigator, provided with radio equipment, was in a separate compartment with his own port side, windowed door. Behind him was the [...] volume <b>mail</b> <b>compartment</b> with windowed doors on both sides and further lit by two forward windows. In this area the fuselage was double-walled.|$|E
5000|$|For the {{introduction}} of more frequent service (every half an hour) on the [...] "Golden Coast Line" [...] ("Goldküstenlinie") Zürich-Meilen-Rapperswil, 20 electric multiple units RABDe 12/12 were put into service in 1967 {{to be able to}} maintain the tight schedule with the frequent stops. They consist of two second class end cars and a first class car with <b>mail</b> <b>compartment</b> in between. They originally had a claret livery, which was an exception at that time (most other SBB-CFF-FFS vehicles had the same green livery). They got the nickname [...] "Golden Coast Express" [...] ("Goldküstenexpress"), due to their service on the Golden Coast (which is the northern waterside of the lake of Zurich, known for its high land prices, thus attracting mainly wealthy levels of the population). With {{the introduction}} of the new double-decker S-Bahn trains in the 1990s, they lost their prestigious role and were subsequently used on lines with low passenger frequencies. The trains, which were all modernized in the 1990s, remained in S-Bahn service until December 2008. The last trainset has been scrapped in 2010.|$|E
