25|$|The N type {{carriages}} {{were the}} first cars to be built at Newport Workshops in over 20 years. Each carriage took over 20 weeks to construct, with a rolling production line to give one new carriage {{off the assembly line}} every fortnight. Weeks 1 to 7 involved the general structure - welding the shell and the underframe together and attaching the ends. Following that, the electrical fitout took four weeks, and the bogies were fitted after Week 11. A <b>mineral</b> <b>fibre</b> insulation was sprayed on internal surfaces between weeks 12-14, and then the final six weeks the internal fibreglass ceiling and wall sheets were fitted, along with carpet, seats, lighting, doors and other components, with a one-week trial at the end. The cost was roughly $500,000 per carriage. The total build time added to 16,500 man-hours per carriage, against 32,000 for the earlier Z type carriages. Additionally, the carriages are between five and eight tonnes heavier than comparable designs overseas, partially due to their being a compromise between regional and commuter type vehicles. On the other hand, they cost a mere $13,000 per seat, against $47,000 per seat for the XPT carriages being built for New South Wales Railways around the same time.|$|E

Benzo(alpha) pyrene (B(alpha) P), nitrosonornicotine (NNN), and N-acetyl- 2 -aminofluorene (NAAF) were assayed {{in the presence of}} Canadian grade 4 T 30 chrysotile, chrysotile A, amosite, crocidolite, glass microfibres, glasswool, attapulgite, and titanium dioxide. Chrysotile binds significantly more carcinogens than the other <b>mineral</b> <b>fibres.</b> This binding assay is reproducible with coefficients of variation of less than 8 % and 6 % respectively for inter and intra assay. The influence of pH was also studied, and there is good correlation between the carcinogen binding and the charge of the tested <b>mineral</b> <b>fibres.</b> The in vitro cytotoxicity on macrophage like cell line P 388 D 1 and the haemolytic activity of various <b>mineral</b> <b>fibres</b> were also measured; a good correlation was found between the binding capacity and the cytotoxicity of tested <b>mineral</b> <b>fibres</b> on P 388 D 1 cells.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the combined effects of <b>mineral</b> <b>fibres</b> and cigarette smoke on the production of tumour necrosis factor (TNF) by alveolar macrophages. Rats were exposed to cigarette smoke in vivo, and production of TNF by alveolar macrophages was measured in the presence of <b>mineral</b> <b>fibres</b> in vitro. For smoke exposure, rats were divided into two groups. Five were exposed to a daily concentration of 10 mg/m 3 of cigarette smoke for an eight hour period, and five rats (controls) were not exposed to smoke. Bronchoalveolar lavage was performed after exposure to smoke and the recovered alveolar macrophages were incubated with either chrysotile or ceramic fibres on a microplate for 24 hours. Activity of TNF in the supernatant was determined by the L- 929 fibroblast cell bioassay. When alveolar macrophages were not stimulated by <b>mineral</b> <b>fibres,</b> production of TNF by rats exposed to smoke and unexposed rats was essentially the same. When alveolar macrophages were stimulated in vitro by chrysotile or ceramic fibres, production of TNF by alveolar macrophages from rats exposed to smoke was higher than that by alveolar macrophages from unexposed rats.

50|$|The {{deformation}} resistant {{capacity of}} SMA {{stems from a}} coarse stone skeleton providing more stone-on-stone contact than with conventional dense graded asphalt (DGA) mixes (see above picture). Improved binder durability {{is a result of}} higher bitumen content, a thicker bitumen film, and lower air voids content. This high bitumen content also improves flexibility. Addition of a small quantity of cellulose or <b>mineral</b> <b>fibre</b> prevents drainage of bitumen during transport and placement. There are no precise design guidelines for SMA mixes available in Europe. The essential features, which are the coarse aggregate skeleton and mastic composition, and the consequent surface texture and mixture stability, are largely determined by the selection of aggregate grading and the type and proportion of filler and binder. In the US, detailed mix design guidelines have been developed for SMA and published by the US National Asphalt Pavement Association in their Quality Improvement Publication QIP 122 as given in the references.|$|E

40|$|Although {{asbestos}} represents today one of {{the most}} harmful contaminant on Earth, in 72 % of the countries worldwide only amphiboles are banned while controlled use of chrysotile is allowed. Uncertainty on the potential toxicity of chrysotile {{is due to the fact}} that the mechanisms by which <b>mineral</b> <b>fibres</b> induces cyto- and geno-toxic damage are still unclear. We have recently started a long term project aimed at the systematic investigation of the crystal-chemistry, bio-interaction and toxicity of the <b>mineral</b> <b>fibres.</b> This work presents a systematic structural investigation of iron in asbestos and erionite (considered the most relevant <b>mineral</b> <b>fibres</b> of social and/or economic-industrial importance) using synchrotron X-ray absorption and Mössbauer spectroscopy. In all investigated <b>mineral</b> <b>fibres,</b> iron in the bulk structure is found in octahedral sites and can be made available at the surface via fibre dissolution. We postulate that the amount of hydroxyl radicals released by the fibers depends, among other factors, upon their dissolution rate; in relation to this, a ranking of ability of asbestos fibres to generate hydroxyl radicals, resulting from available surface iron, is advanced: amosite> crocidolite≈chrysotile > anthophyllite > tremolite. Erionite, with a fairly high toxicity potential, contains only octahedrally coordinated Fe 3 +. Although it needs further experimental evidence, such available surface iron may be present as oxide nanoparticles coating and can be a direct cause of generation of hydroxyl radicals when such coating dissolves...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVES [...] Mounting {{evidence}} suggests that asbestos fibres can stimulate alveolar macrophages to generate the potent inflammatory and fibrogenic mediator, tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), and that this may play {{an important part in}} the onset and development of airway inflammation and lung fibrosis due to asbestos fibre inhalation. Little is known, however, about the ability of other <b>mineral</b> <b>fibres</b> to initiate formation and release of TNF-alpha by alveolar macrophages. Therefore the effects of different fibres (crocidolite, chrysotile A, chrysotile B, two man made <b>mineral</b> <b>fibres</b> (MMVF 21 and MMVF 22), a ceramic fibre (RCF 1), and a silicon carbide whisker fibre (SiCwh)) on formation and release of TNF-alpha by rat alveolar macrophages were examined. METHODS [...] Cells were isolated and incubated at 37 degrees C with the different fibres, or with culture medium alone (controls), and the amounts of TNF-alpha messenger RNA (mRNA) in the cells and TNF-alpha bioactivity released into the culture medium were measured at different time points. RESULTS [...] Significantly (P < 0. 05 v control) increased amounts of TNF-alpha mRNA were found in cells exposed to crocidolite, chrysotile A, chrysotile B, MMVF 21, RCF 1, or SiCwh for 90 minutes, and significantly (P < 0. 05 v control) increased activities of TNF-alpha were found in the medium of macrophages exposed to crocidolite, chrysotile A, chrysotile B, or MMVF 21 for four hours. CONCLUSION [...] These observations suggest that not only natural <b>mineral</b> <b>fibres</b> but also certain man made <b>mineral</b> <b>fibres</b> are able to induce the formation and release of TNF-alpha by alveolar macrophages in vitro...|$|R

40|$|Lungs {{from seven}} cases of diffuse pleural {{fibrosis}} with known asbestos exposure were studied {{to determine the}} gross and microscopic pathological features and relate these to the analysed <b>mineral</b> <b>fibre</b> content of the lung. All seven individuals had had substantial exposure, ranging from two to 25 years, and chronic chest problems and at necropsy all cases met the criteria for compensatable disease. Macroscopically, all had extensive visceral pleural fibrosis and extensive areas of adhesions, and four also had discrete parietal pleural plaques. The histological features were similar in all the cases [...] most strikingly the basket weave pattern of the thickened pleura and a dense subpleural parenchymal interstitial fibrosis with fine honeycombing, extending up to 1 cm into the underlying lung. The similar histological appearances raise the possibility that diffuse pleural fibrosis and pleural plaques have a similar pathogenesis. Amphibole asbestos (crocidolite and amosite) counts were high in six of the seven cases and chrysotile counts in four; four cases had high mullite counts, but {{the importance of this}} is not known.
