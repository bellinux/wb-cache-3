40|$|Mooring {{systems of}} {{floating}} structures consist of long lengths of chain, rope or wire, {{or a combination}} of these elements. As part of a station-keeping system, the mooring lines have to keep the movements of the structure to a minimum. The mooring lines have to withstand the loads acting on the moored structure in addition to loads acting directly on the mooring components. If a mooring line fails, the floating structure can lose station and cause severe damage to structures and environment as well as economic losses and loss of lives. Awareness of corrosion, wear, fatigue and relevant loading conditions during design will improve the design and extend the service life of the structural components. The overall goal {{of this study is to}} find out how <b>mooring</b> <b>chains</b> work as structural components. The theory part of the report includes a study of offshore loading conditions, different types of mooring systems, causes of mooring line failure, failure detection of mooring lines and fatigue. However, there is a special focus on <b>mooring</b> <b>chains.</b> Offshore standards and recommended practices provide common chain link designs and minimum mechanical properties of links, but in order to study chain links as structural components, the stresses and strains are of importance. Normal stresses in chain links are calculated analytical using classic beam theory and curved beam theory. In addition, three-dimensional elastoplastic finite element models are applied for a more detailed investigation on the stress distribution in chain links. The presented analyses are limited to chains subjected to pure tension, although torsion and bending due to interlink friction may occur. Both stud links and studless links are analyzed in the computer program Abaqus 6. 12. <b>Mooring</b> components as <b>chain</b> links enter in operation with a residual stress field created by the required proof test. However, traditional design of <b>mooring</b> <b>chains</b> does not consider the presence of residual stresses [1 - 3]. This study shows that residual stresses play an important role. When residual stresses are added to the operational stresses, the resulting maximum tensile stress is 3. 65 and 3. 30 times the nominal stress for stud links and studless links respectively. The maximum tensile stress is located at the link surface at the crown section. Such tensile stress concentrations at the surface of a material are unfavorable due to fatigue crack propagation. Both whole links and worn links are modeled with Abaqus 6. 12, using solid elements. The worn links have a reduction of cross-sectional diameter of 2. 6 % to 13. 2 %. Wear will reduce the cross-sectional area and cause some sharp edges, but at the same time increase the contact area. The positive effects of wear seem to surpass the negative effects of wear when the wear is moderate. </p...|$|R

40|$|In 2002, several mooring {{chains of}} Girassol Off-loading buoy which was {{installed}} offshore Angola ruptured just after 8 months of service. A new failure mechanism called out-of plane bending(OPB) fatigue in <b>mooring</b> <b>chain</b> links was identified {{in addition to}} tension induced fatigue {{after a series of}} experiments. Currently, there are no models in literature which can comprehensively explain OPB mechanism in <b>mooring</b> <b>chain</b> links. Models to explain OPB mechanism are required to calculate OPB stresses in chain links for fatigue damage evaluation. These models need to be "simple" and "adequate" {{in the sense that it}} should idealize the complicated geometry of chain links while giving accurate predictions of OPB stresses when subjected to rotation and tension, at a fraction of time used by solid finite element models or full scale experiments. The research carried out in this master's project deals with development of such models to explain OPB mechanism in <b>mooring</b> <b>chain</b> links. In this thesis, a new interlink stiffness model is developed to describe the nonlinear hysteritic relationship between OPB moment and interlink angle. The interlink stiffness model is then applied to a system of chain links using two different methods: a physics based approach and a semi-empirical approach. Each of these methods present a new approach to idealize a system of chain links. Then, a case study is presented in which a methodology to calculate OPB stresses for one sea-state is described. This methodology follows a de-coupled approach in which results of coupled floater-mooring analysis are taken as an input for the simplified models of chain links. To verify this methodology, a comparative study is performed at the end in which coupled floatermooring analysis is carried out with and without including the interlink stiffness of chain links.

40|$|<b>Mooring</b> <b>chain</b> can {{twist in}} {{response}} to torque generated in the adjacent elements of a mooring, or even be inadvertently installed in a twisted condition. This paper explores the effect of initial twist on the static strength and fatigue life of studless chain. It reports test results for 16 mm studless chain (with similar proportions as the much larger chains now employed in hydrocarbon production vessels) with known levels of initial twist subject to axial tensile loading. Twist levels of up to 24 ° per link were examined. The results were generally better than had been expected. There was little scatter in the results, giving confidence in the test procedures. The effect of initial twist on static strength was modest, with a maximum strength loss of about 4 % at 18 ° twist per link. The effects of initial twist on fatigue life were also small. Indeed, some twist seemed to improve fatigue performance, perhaps because the contact between links was displaced from the region of high residual (compressive and tensile) stress resulting from proof loading during manufacture. While {{the results of these}} small scale tests suggest that twist levels up to 24 ° per link were not detrimental, other practical reasons remain for continuing to minimize twist in <b>mooring</b> <b>chain.</b> Furthermore, caution should be applied in extrapolating these results to predict the effect of twist in full scale offshore mooring chains...|$|E
