Results showed that <b>Medicago</b> <b>sativa</b> L. was more tolerant to the azo dyes and more helpful in promoting the azo-dye wastewater bio-decoloration than Sesbania cannabina Pers, but GTY density was higher in the root exudates of Sesbania cannabina Pers than that of <b>Medicago</b> <b>sativa</b> L.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to study the effects of weeds infestation on the growth of lucerne (<b>Medicago</b> <b>sativa</b> sativa) in both summer and winter season as well as the effects of lucerne winter harvesting on the growth and yield of lucerne (<b>Medicago</b> <b>sativa</b> sativa) in spring. This study further evaluated the effects of ensiling lucerne at dry matter content less than 300 g/kg DM using Lactobacillus plantarum MTD- 1 as well as the effects of including lucerne (<b>Medicago</b> <b>sativa</b> sativa) in dairy cows' total mixed ration, on milk production and enteric methane production. The growing of lucerne to feed dairy cows is expected to ease the current and future feed constraints in dairy farming. The universally increasing demand for milk poses great challenges for the development of cheap, nutritious forage feeds in both the developed and the emerging worlds. The shortage of high quality nutritious forage feeds causes food/feed crises in the emerging world due to the high proportion of cereals used in dairy farming. Therefore, research intensification in the growing and use of both high quality and high yeilding forages like lucerne is of paramount importance in dairy farming...|$|R

30|$|There is {{accumulated}} {{evidence that}} the production of fibrolytic enzymes by anaerobic fungus is highly affected by growth conditions (Glass 2016; Solomon et al. 2016). Consistent with this notion, we found that different lignocellulosic materials induced different levels of the fibrolytic enzymes produced by (Piromyces + M. ruminantium) Yak-G 18 co-culture. Among the five assayed substrates, <b>medicago</b> <b>sativa</b> which possesses the least NDF (Table  1) was identified with the highest IVDMD value. In contrast, compared with other substrates, <b>medicago</b> <b>sativa</b> showed least efficacy in inducing xylanase as well as AE activities throughout the incubation period. The induction of FPase by <b>medicago</b> <b>sativa</b> was also lower than other substrates except for Chinese wildrye at late incubation phase. The actual relationship between the fibrolytic enzyme production of (Piromyces + M. ruminantium) Yak-G 18 co-culture and the fiber composition of fermented material requires future investigations.|$|R
40|$|<b>Medicago</b> <b>sativa</b> or Alfalfa is a {{flowering}} plant {{that belongs to}} Pea Family that is widely grown throughout the world as forage for cattle, and is most often harvested as hay. <b>Medicago</b> <b>Sativa</b> usually has the highest nutritive value of all common hay crops. This work aims to highlight a way for direct, non-destructive analysis of crude protein content in <b>Medicago</b> <b>sativa</b> hays. The primary objective was to build a model for crude protein calibration for <b>Medicago</b> <b>sativa</b> based on FT-NIR spectroscopy. The samples for analysis were collected over two experimental years (2008 - 2009) from field trials from the research station– Agricultural Development, Jucu. In order to construct the model, references values are needed; for this reason, crude protein content was determined using the classical Kjeldahl method (Kjeltec Auto Analyser, Tecator). The values for crude protein ranged from 12. 63 % to 19. 12 % on the dry matter basis. The regression models build was based on Partial Least Squares (PLS) calculated with the SIMPLS algorithm, using different pre-processing techniques and leave-one-out cross validation. Calibration of the two years together drove to a coefficient of determination for cross validation,R 2, of 0. 965. The robustness of the model was confirmed by applying it to independent samples (external validation) where the coefficient of determination was R 2 = 0. 977, RMSEP = 0. 8. The results obtained indicated that NIRS {{can be used to}} determine crude protein, which {{could be used as a}} criteria for quality control of <b>Medicago</b> <b>sativa</b> hays.
