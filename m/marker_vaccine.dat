50|$|Vaccination {{is widely}} used both to protect cattle {{clinically}} {{in the case of}} infection and significantly reduce the shedding of the virus. Vaccination provides herd immunity, which lowers the likelihood of an animal coming into contact with an infected animal. Both inactivated and live attenuated vaccines are available. Immunity usually lasts approximately six months to one year. Marker vaccines are also available and recommended. Marker vaccines, also known as DIVA (differentiation of infected from vaccinated animals), have become popular in order to distinguish vaccinated animals from infected animals. A <b>marker</b> <b>vaccine</b> uses either deletion mutants or a virion subunit, such as glycoprotein E. Studies show that vaccinating after an animal has been infected decreases shedding of the disease and reduces reactivation of the latent virus, although not completely. Using a killed gE deleted <b>marker</b> <b>vaccine</b> after infection will reduce viral excretion following reactivation, using a dexamethasone treatment.|$|E
50|$|A <b>marker</b> <b>vaccine</b> {{allows for}} {{immunological}} differentiation (or segregation) of infected from vaccinated animals, {{and is also}} referred to as a DIVA (or SIVA) vaccine (or Segregation) of infected from vaccinated animals in veterinary medicine. In practical terms, this is most often achieved by omitting an immunogenic antigen present in the pathogen being vaccinated against, thus creating a negative marker of vaccination. In contrast, vaccination with traditional vaccines containing the complete pathogen, either attenuated or inactivated, precludes the use of serology (e.g. analysis of specific antibodies in body fluids) in epidemiological surveys in vaccinated populations.|$|E
40|$|This study {{analysed}} {{the effects}} of the use of bovine herpesvirus 1 (BHV 1) <b>marker</b> <b>vaccine</b> on the performance of dairy cattle. In Spring of 1999, vaccination of 12 herds with the BHV 1 <b>marker</b> <b>vaccine</b> resulted in severe animal health problems and mortality. The vaccines used on these farms were all from a batch that appeared to be contaminated with bovine virus diarrhoea virus type 2. This led to a general call to farmers and veterinary practitioners to report side-effects of this vaccine. As a result, more than 7000 farmers reported symptoms. The information was obtained by means of a questionnaire; there was no control group. To determine {{the effects of}} the use of the <b>marker</b> <b>vaccine,</b> it was necessary to perform a study based on objectively acquired information. The information collected by the Royal Dutch Cattle Syndicate and the office of Identification and Registration was complied into herd indices on production, udder health, reproduction, and culling. Two groups of dairy farms that had used the BHV 1 <b>marker</b> <b>vaccine</b> (attenuated and inactivated vaccine) were compared with farms that were certified BHV 1 -free. The analyses were performed based on intra-herd comparisons, meaning that per herd each index calculated over {{a certain period of time}} after the use of the <b>marker</b> <b>vaccine</b> was compared to a similar period of time prior to the use of the <b>marker</b> <b>vaccine.</b> A total of 144 comparisons were made. Seven comparisons were statistically significant. In two comparisons, the results were in favour of the BHV 1 -free farms and in five comparisons, the result were in favour of the vaccinated farms. Thus use of the BHV 1 <b>marker</b> <b>vaccine</b> could not be proven to affect herd performance. The sensitivity of the tests was very high, so with a high level of probability even very small differences in indices between groups would have been detected.

40|$|A <b>marker</b> <b>vaccine</b> elicits an {{antibody}} {{response in}} the host that can be distinguished from the antibody response induced by a wild-type strain. To obtain a bovine herpesvirus 1 (BHV- 1) <b>marker</b> <b>vaccine,</b> we constructed a glycoprotein E (gE) deletion mutant. This was obtained by removing the complete gE coding region from the BHV- 1 genome. To attenuate the gE deletion mutant further, we also introduced a small deletion in the thymidine kinase (TK) gene. We selected three mutants: the gE deletion mutant, a TK deletion mutant and a gE/TK double deletion mutant, and examined their virulence and immunogenicity in calves. After intranasal inoculation, the TK deletion mutant showed some residual virulence, whereas the gE and gE/TK deletion mutants were avirulent. The calves inoculated with the deletion mutants were protected against disease after challenge exposure and shed significantly less virus than control calves. Deleting the gE gene, therefore, has {{little effect on the}} immuno-genicity of BHV- 1, but is sufficient to reduce the virulence of BHV- 1 in calves. These findings led us to conclude that the gE deletion mutant is a good candidate for a modified live BHV- 1 <b>marker</b> <b>vaccine...</b>|$|E
40|$|International audienceFoot-and-mouth disease (FMD) is {{a highly}} {{contagious}} and economically devastating disease of cloven-hoofed animals in the world. The disease can be effectively controlled by vaccination of susceptible animals with the conventional inactivated vaccine. However, one major concern of the inactivated FMD virus (FMDV) vaccine {{is that it does}} not allow serological discrimination between infected and vaccinated animals, and therefore interferes with serologic surveillance and the epidemiology of disease. A <b>marker</b> <b>vaccine</b> has proven to be of great value in disease eradication and control programs. In this study, we constructed a marker FMDV containing a deletion of residues 93 to 143 in the nonstructural protein 3 A using a recently developed FMDV infectious cDNA clone. The marker virus, r-HN/ 3 A 93 – 143, had similar growth kinetics as the wild type virus in culture cell and caused a symptomatic infection in pigs. Pigs immunized with chemically inactivated <b>marker</b> <b>vaccine</b> were fully protected from the wild type virus challenge, and the potency of this <b>marker</b> <b>vaccine</b> was 10 PD 50 (50 % pig protective dose) per dose, indicating it could be an efficacious vaccine against FMDV. In addition, we developed a blocking ELISA targeted to the deleted epitope that could clearly differentiate animals infected with the marker virus from those infected with the wild type virus.

40|$|Chronic wasting' in cattle {{acquired}} a special {{meaning in the}} Netherlands in 1999. It was used to define animal health problems that {{were thought to be}} associated with the use of bovine herpesvirus 1 <b>marker</b> <b>vaccine.</b> Criteria have not been set by which an objectively independent inventory of the problems could be made. The objective of this study was to determine management factors associated with the problem of 'chronic wasting' prior to the use of the BHV 1 <b>marker</b> <b>vaccine.</b> Knowledge about these factors could be helpful for generating additional hypotheses about the aetiology of chronic wasting in cattle. A total of 188 farms participated in the study, of which 94 had severe problems with chronic wasting. The other half consisted of control farms matched with the case farms that did not report problems after the use of the BHV 1 <b>marker</b> <b>vaccine.</b> Data analyses were performed over the period before (and not at the time of) 'chronic wasting' problems. Data were collected from various sources. A questionnaire was used to collect information on farm management practice. In addition, information on laboratory submissions for 1996 to 1998, animal movements in 1998, roughage analyses of 1997 and 1998, expenses for animal health in 1998, and herd performance in 1995 to 1999 was collected. In the analyses, a distinction was made between information obtained objectively and subjectively. Herds with problems of 'chronic wasting' were larger than herds without wasting problems (animals, surface) but not more intensively managed. 'Wasting' herds had a lower performance in terms of fertility and udder health. In addition, these herds had more contact with other herds through the purchase of animals. There were no differences in farm management practices related to disease control and prevention. Additional studies are required with regard to the patho-physiology of chronic wasting cows.

40|$|Within the {{framework}} of developing a <b>marker</b> <b>vaccine</b> against bovine herpesvirus 1 (BHV 1), several mutants with deletions in non-essential glycoprotein genes were constructed. Glycoprotein gC, gG, gI and gE single deletion mutants, a gI/gE double deletion mutant and a gE frame-shift mutant were made. The virulence and immunogenicity of these mutants were evaluated in specific-pathogen-free calves. Except for the gC deletion mutant, all mutants were significantly less virulent than the parental wild-type (wt) BHV 1 strain Lam. The virulence of the gI and the gI-/gE- mutants was almost completely reduced. Upon challenge infection, the calves of the control group became severely ill, whereas all other calves remained healthy. The reduction of the virus shedding after challenge infection {{was related to the}} virulence of the strain of primary inoculation. Virus shedding was almost completely reduced in calves first inoculated with Lam-wt or with gC- and the least reduced in calves inoculated with gI- or gI-/gE-. Six weeks after challenge, all calves were treated with dexamethasone to study whether mutant or challenge virus or both could be reactivated. The gC- and the gG- mutants were reactivated, whereas none of the other mutants were reisolated. Reactivation of challenge virus was reduced in all calves inoculated with mutant viruses. The gC deletion mutant was too virulent and the gI and the gI/gE deletion mutants were the least immunogenic, but based on residual virulence and immunogenicity, both the gG and the gE deletion mutants are candidates for incorporation in live BHV 1 vaccines.

40|$|Due to the {{tremendous}} socio-economic impact of {{classical swine fever}} (CSF) outbreaks, emergency vaccination scenarios are continuously under discussion. Unfortunately, all currently available vaccines show restrictions either in terms of marker capacities or immunogenicity. Recent research efforts were therefore directed at the design of new modified live marker vaccines. Among the most promising candidates the chimeric pestiviruses “CP 7 _E 2 alf” and “flc 11 ” were identified. Within an international research project, these candidates were comparatively tested in challenge experiments after a single oral vaccination. Challenge infection was carried out with highly virulent CSF virus strain “Koslov”, 14 or 21 days post vaccination (dpv), respectively. Safety, efficacy, and marker potential were addressed. All assessments were done {{in comparison with the}} conventional “gold standard” C-strain “Riems” vaccine. In addition to the challenge trials, multiple vaccinations with both candidates were performed to further assess their <b>marker</b> <b>vaccine</b> potential. All vaccines were safe and yielded full protection upon challenge 21 days post vaccination. Neither serological nor virological investigations showed major differences among the three vaccines. Whereas CP 7 _E 2 alf also provided clinical protection upon challenge at 14 days post vaccination, only 50 % of animals vaccinated with flc 11, and 83 % vaccinated with C-strain “Riems” survived challenge at this time point. No marked differences were seen in protected animals. Despite the fact that all multiple-vaccinated animals stayed sero-negative in the accompanying marker test, the discriminatory assay remains a weak point due to delayed or inexistent detection of some of the vaccinated and subsequently infected animals. Nevertheless, the potential as live marker vaccines could be confirmed for both vaccine candidates.

ANIMALS:Approximately 7, 700 cows from 72 farms. PROCEDURES:Farms were assigned to 3 treatment groups (hyperimmunization groups [HIGs] 1 and 2, which were hyperimmunized with glycoprotein E [gE]-deleted <b>marker</b> <b>vaccines,</b> and a nonintervention group [NIG]). Cattle in HIG 1 were initially vaccinated with an attenuated vaccine, whereas cattle in HIG 2 were initially vaccinated with an inactivated-virus vaccine. Cattle in both HIGs received booster inoculations with inactivated-virus vaccines at 6 -month intervals. The risk for gE seroconversion was compared among experimental groups via a shared frailty model with a piecewise constant baseline risk to correct for seasonal and secular effects. RESULTS:Risk for gE seroconversion significantly decreased over time for the HIGs, compared with the NIG. Seasonal changes {{in the risk of}} gE seroconversion were detected, with a higher risk during winter periods, compared with grazing periods. No significant difference was detected between HIGs 1 and 2.

40|$|Detection of {{classical}} swine fever virus (CSFV) {{can be achieved by}} a range of assays of which the most commonly used are: immunohistochemical and virus culture techniques. New developments have enabled the detection of viral proteins by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) and the detection of the viral genome by RT- PCR. So far, laboratory findings show that the latter assays may supplement or replace the conventional techniques in the near future. The detection of serum antibody against structural and non-structural proteins of CSFV has been improved by developments in recombinant DNA techniques and has lead to a range of ELISAs. Although the characteristics of these ELISAs are excellent, positive results still need to be confirmed in the virus neutralization test. The available amount of sequence data enables diagnosticians to type strains of CSFV as different by comparing several parts of the genome. In some cases, this can provide conclusive evidence if a primary or secondary outbreak has been detected. Increased efforts focused on the retrieval of relevant data on the introduction of CSFV in a pig holding and the spread of CSFV in- and between pig holding(s) has generated more insight into the epizootiology of the disease. A successful control and eradication programme for {{classical swine fever}} (CSF) can consist of zoosanitary measures and/or vaccination. The latter can compromise the export of live pigs and pig products considerably unless <b>marker</b> <b>vaccines</b> have been used. Several studies were performed to determine the efficacy of an E 2 subunit vaccine and live recombinant vaccine candidates. Firstly, we determined the 95 % protective dose of an E 2 subunit vaccine at 32 μg E 2 per dosage after a single application. Further studies with a single administration of the subunit vaccine showed that: the vaccine was stable for a prolonged period after production, was able to reduce horizontal and vertical transmission of CSFV among vaccinated pigs, and provided protection for at least 6 months.

Moreover, direct virus differentiation is possible using a real-time RT-PCR system specific for the new C-strain virus escape variants or using differential immunofluorescence staining...|$|E
40|$|Water buffalo (Bubalus bubalis) are {{susceptible}} to bovine herpesvirus type 1 (BoHV- 1) and a species-specific herpesvirus, bubaline herpesvirus type 1 (BuHV- 1). In this study, an attenuated marker BoHV- 1 based vaccine against BuHV- 1 challenge was evaluated {{to determine whether it}} induces protection from viral replication. One group of water buffalo calves was immunized with an attenuated BoHV- 1 <b>marker</b> <b>vaccine.</b> A second group was not vaccinated and used as the control. During the post-vaccination period, we monitored the humoral immune response. The efficacy of the vaccine was tested after intranasal challenge of the calves with a BuHV- 1 strain. The experiment showed that after vaccination, BuHV- 1 replication was significantly reduced by approximately three titer points compared to the controls. The control animals showed high levels of viral shedding and mild signs associated with BuHV- 1 infection. Therefore, our study provides evidence for the existence of cross-protection between BoHV- 1 and BuHV- 1 in buffalo calves...|$|E
40|$|On 23 February 1999, the Dutch Animal Health Service advised all Dutch {{veterinary}} {{practices to}} postpone vaccination against bovine herpesvirus 1 (BHV 1) immediately. The day before severe disease problems were diagnosed on four dairy farms after vaccination {{with the same}} batch of BHV 1 <b>marker</b> <b>vaccine.</b> Using monoclonal antibodies, bovine virus diarrhoea virus (BVDV) type 2 {{was found in the}} vaccine batch. This paper describes an outbreak of BVDV type 2 infection caused by the use of a batch of modified live BHV 1 <b>marker</b> <b>vaccine</b> contaminated with BDVD. Sources of information used were reports of farm visits, minutes of meetings, laboratory results, and oral communications from the people involved. The first symptoms of disease were observed on average six days after vaccination. Morbidity was high on 11 of the 12 farms. On five farms more than 70 % of the animals became ill, while on one farm no symptoms could be detected. During the first week after vaccination, feed intake and milk production decreased. During the second week, some animals became clinically diseased having nasal discharge, fever, and diarrhoea. At {{the end of the second}} week and at the start of the third week, the number of diseased animals increased rapidly, the symptoms became more severe, and some animals died. Mortality varied among herds. Necropsy most often revealed erosions and ulcers of the mucosa of the digestive tract. In addition, degeneration of the liver, hyperaemia of the abomasum, and swollen mesenterial lymph nodes and swollen spleen were found. On 11 of the 12 farms all animals were culled between 32 and 68 days after vaccination after an agreement was reached with the manufacturer of the vaccine. This was the third outbreak of BVD in cattle after administration of a contaminated vaccine in the Netherlands. The possibilities to prevent contamination of a vaccine as a consequence of infection of fetal calf serum with BVDV are discussed. Improvement of controls to prevent contamination before and during vaccine production, and improvement of the monitoring of side-effects is necessary.

40|$|A {{blocking}} {{enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay}} (ELISA) {{was developed}} for detecting antibodies against glycoprotein gE (gE) of bovine herpesvirus 1 (BHV 1). The assay {{is based on the}} use of two monoclonal antibodies directed against different antigenic domains on gE. Sera from uninfected cattle and cattle that had been repeatedly vaccinated with gE-negative <b>marker</b> <b>vaccines</b> scored negative, whereas sera from cattle naturally or experimentally infected with BHV 1 field strains scored positive in the gE-ELISA. Antibodies against gE appeared in the serum around 11 days after infection. Cattle that were first vaccinated and then challenged, thus having less virus replication, also became gE-seropositive. The sensitivity and specificity of the gE-ELISA is high, and therefore the gE-ELISA is suitable for differentiating between infected cattle and vaccinated cattle with a gE-negative vaccine...|$|R
40|$|This brief review {{describes}} {{types and}} quality (efficacy and safety) of {{bovine viral diarrhoea}} virus (BVDV) vaccines {{that are in the}} market or under development. Both conventional live and killed vaccines are available. The primary aim of vaccination is to prevent congenital infection, but the few vaccines tested are not highly efficacious in this respect, as shown in vaccination-challenge experiments. Vaccination to prevent severe postnatal infections may be indicated when virulent BVDV strains are prevalent. Live BVDV vaccines have given rise to safety problems. A complication for the development of BVDV vaccines is the wide antigenic diversity among wild-type BVDV. There is ample room for improvement of both the efficacy and safety of BVDV vaccines, and it may be expected that better <b>vaccines,</b> among which <b>marker</b> <b>vaccines,</b> will be launched in the future...|$|R
40|$|AbstractClassical {{swine fever}} (CSF), a highly {{contagious}} disease of pigs {{caused by the}} classical swine fever virus (CSFV), can lead to important economic losses in the pig industry. Numerous CSFV isolates with various degrees of virulence have been isolated worldwide, ranging from low virulent strains that do not result in any apparent clinical signs to highly virulent strains that cause a severe peracute hemorrhagic fever with nearly 100 % mortality. Knowledge of the molecular determinants of CSFV virulence {{is an important issue}} for effective disease control and development of safe and effective <b>marker</b> <b>vaccines.</b> In this review, the latest studies in the field of CSFV virulence are discussed. The topic of virulence is addressed from different angles; nonconventional approaches like codon pair usage and quasispecies are considered. Future research approaches in the field of CSFV virulence are proposed...|$|R
