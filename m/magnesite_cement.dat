40|$|The main {{constituent}} of the reinforced fiberglass concrete are: the glass fibers, the binder, {{the sand and}} the water. In order to change certain characteristics there can be used different types of additives of fillers. The fiberglass {{is used in the}} shape of beams and cords having the lengths comprised between 12 and 15 mm; the cutting is realized with different devices, which are designed, built and used by variant firms. The reinforced fiberglass concretes use the following binders: hydraulic binders - based on Portland cement, like the normal Portland cement, the Portland cement with additions, the fast - hardening cement (in Romania the RIM), the white and coloured cements; the alumina cements, non-hydraulic binders - the burnt plaster, the <b>magnesite</b> <b>cement,</b> clay...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to apply metakaolin from northeast of Thailand as a binder in the casting process of rice polishing cylinder in replacement of the imported calcined <b>magnesite</b> <b>cement</b> and to reduce the production cost of the cylinder. Metakaolin was obtained from three different regions (Udon Thani, Nakhon Phanom, and Ubon Ratchathani). The design of experiment analysis using the MINITAB Release 14 based on the compressive strength and tensile strength testing was conducted. According to the analysis results, {{it was found that the}} optimal proportions were calcined magnesite cement: metakaolin from Udon Thani, Nakhon Phanom and Ubon Ratchathani equal to 63 : 37, 71 : 29, and 100 : 0, respectively. When used this formula to cast the cylinder and test the rice milling, it was found that the average broken rice percent was 32. 52 and 38. 29 for the cylinder contained the metakaolin from Udon Thani and Nakhon Phanom, respectively, which implied that the cylinder which contained the metakaolin from Udon Thani has higher efficiency than the cylinder which contained the metakaolin from Nakhon Phanom at 0. 05 level of statistical significance. Whereas, the average wear rate of cylinder from both resources were 7. 27 and 6. 53 g/h, respectively...|$|E
40|$|The AMASE project {{studies the}} role of {{biogenic}} processes during precipitation and weathering of carbonates in Mars analog environments on NW Spitsbergen. Carbonate deposits in the Quaternary Bockfjord volcanic complex (Skjelkvale et al., 1987) include calcite deposits (travertine) associated with hot springs, stromatolite textured magnesite in lava conduits, <b>magnesite</b> <b>cemented</b> lava breccias and ubiquitous magnesite-dolomite globules inside lava vesicles. The carbonate globules were first described by Amundsen (1987) and are the only known Terrestrial analog to carbonate globules in the Martian meteorite ALH 84001 (Treiman et al., 2002). AMASE also involves development and testing of instruments aimed at future “Search for Life ” missions to Mars, {{in cooperation with the}} Carnegie Institution of Washington (CIW) and NASA-JPL (Steele et al., 2004). Studies of the travertine deposits involve water- and rock geochemical analyses (Hammer et al., 2004) and microbial studies (Steele et al., 2004) combined with modeling of pattern forming processes. Abundant microbial activity is evident both in the hot spring pools and as endolithic communities within travertine terraces. A direct link between microbial activity and carbonate deposition remains to be established. Studies of the volcano hosted carbonate deposits involv...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Blended {{expansive}} agents {{consisting of}} MgO and CaO were prepared by calcining the mixtures of dolomite and magnesite. The mineral phases and microstructures of expansive agent were examined by XRD and SEM. The expansion properties of cement pastes containing 5 % and 6 % of expansive agent {{as well as}} the microstructure of hydrated expansive agent in cement paste were investigated. Results indicated that the contents of MgO and CaO in the blended expansive agent could be adjusted by changing the mix proportion of dolomite and <b>magnesite.</b> All the <b>cement</b> pastes containing expansive agent produced rapid expansion. At the same addition dosage, irrespective of curing temperature, expansive agent containing higher content of MgO produced greater expansion in cement pastes, particularly at late age, which probably ascribes to the relatively slow hydration of MgO...|$|R
40|$|The Al Shomou Silicilyte Member (Athel Formation) in the South Oman Salt Basin shares {{many of the}} {{characteristics}} of a light, tight-oil (LTO) reservoir: it is a prolifi c source rock mature for light oil, it produces light oil from a very tight matrix and reservoir, and hydraulic fracking technology is required to produce the oil. What is intriguing about the Al Shomou Silicilyte, and different from other LTO reservoirs, is its position related to the Precambrian/Cambrian Boundary (PCB) {{and the fact that it}} is a ‘laminated chert‘ rather than a shale. In an integrated diagenetic study we applied microstructural analyses (SEM, BSE) combined with state-of-the-art stable isotope and trace element analysis of the silicilyte matrix and fractures. Fluid inclusion microthermometry was applied to record the salinity and minimum trapping temperatures. The microstructural investigations reveal a fi ne lamination of the silicilyte matrix with a mean lamina thickness of ca. 20 μm consisting of predominantly organic matter-rich and fi nely crystalline quartz-rich layers, respectively. Authigenic, micron-sized idiomorphic quartz crystals are the main matrix components of the silicilyte. Other diagenetic phases are pyrite, apatite, dolomite, <b>magnesite</b> and barite <b>cements.</b> Porosity values based on neutron density logs and core plug data indicate porosity in the silicilyte ranges from less than 2...|$|R
