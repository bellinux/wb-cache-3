30|$|To address {{multiple}} {{motions and}} deformable objects' motions encountered in existing region-based approaches, an automatic video object (VO) segmentation methodology is proposed {{in this paper}} by exploiting the duality of image segmentation and motion estimation such that spatial and temporal information could assist each other to jointly yield much improved segmentation results. The key novelties of our method are (1) scale-adaptive tensor computation, (2) spatial-constrained motion <b>mask</b> <b>generation</b> without invoking dense motion-field computation, (3) rigidity analysis, (4) motion <b>mask</b> <b>generation</b> and selection, and (5) motion-constrained spatial region merging. Experimental results demonstrate that these novelties jointly contribute much more accurate VO segmentation both in spatial and temporal domains.|$|R

In this paper, a small scale passive electric power <b>generation</b> <b>unit</b> was devised for generating electricity from the heat available in the solar pond. The power <b>generation</b> <b>unit</b> proposed operates {{without the use of}} a pump and involves no moving parts. The design of the power <b>generation</b> <b>unit</b> was finalised after performing a comprehensive theoretical study on the possible geometrical arrangements.

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} automatic {{speech recognition}} (ASR) for robots integrated with sound source separation (SSS) by using leak noise based missing feature <b>mask</b> <b>generation.</b> The missing feature theory (MFT) is a promising approach to improve noise-robustness of ASR. An issue in MFT-based ASR is automatic generation of the missing feature mask. To improve robot audition, we applied this theory to interface ASR and SSS which extracts a sound source originated from a specific direction by multiple microphones. In a robot audition system, it is a promising approach to use SSS as a pre-processor for ASR {{to be able to}} deal with any kind of noises. However, ASR usually assumes clean speech input, while speech extracted by SSS never fails to be distorted. MFT can be applied to cope with distortion in the extracted speech. In this case, we can assume that the noises included in extracted sounds are mainly leakages from other channels. Thus, we introduced leak noise based missing feature <b>mask</b> <b>generation,</b> which can generate a missing feature mask automatically by using information on leak noise obtained from other channels. To assess the effectiveness of the leak noise based missing feature <b>mask</b> <b>generation,</b> we used two methods for SSS: geometric source separation (GSS) and independent component analysis (ICA), and Multiband Julian for MFT based ASR. The two constructed systems, that is, GSS-based and ICA-based robot audition systems, were evaluated through recognition of simultaneous speech uttered by two speakers. As a result, we showed that the proposed leak noise based missing feature <b>mask</b> <b>generation</b> worked well in both systems. 1...|$|R

40|$|Abstract [...] Cascaded on-load {{tap changers}} (OLTC) {{are widely used}} for coarse voltage control in {{electric}} power systems. There could be an interaction between load dynamics and OLTC control under certain system operating conditions which may lead to OLTC limit cycle phenomena thereby resulting into long term voltage oscillations in the system. In the recent years, renewable and non-renewable local <b>generation</b> <b>units</b> have been getting interconnected in modern power systems.

Also, a strategy is proposed for mitigating the power system oscillations which can be induced by OLTC limit cycles, especially with local <b>generation</b> <b>units</b> in the network. The proposed mitigation strategy including detailed investigations and analyses have been verified for a two-bus system, and successfully tested on a multi-bus system with local <b>generation</b> <b>units</b> usin...|$|R
