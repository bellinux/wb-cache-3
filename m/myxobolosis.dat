40|$|Myxobolus dogieli Bykhovskaya-Pavlovskaya & Bykhovski, 1940 is {{regarded}} as a site specific myxosporean, infecting the heart of cyprinid fish. During a survey of the myxosporean fauna of Lake Balaton fish, heart <b>myxobolosis</b> was found in the common bream, Abramis brama, with heavy infection of the ventricle and the bulbus arteriosus in some infected bream. Developing and mature plasmodia were mostly in the connective tissue of the subepicardium and subendocardium. Plasmodia developing in the subendocardium protruded into the lumen of the heart, while plasmodia developing in the subepicardium protruded over the epicardium forming large sausage-like outgrowths. Plasmodia with mature spores were found in the summer. The shape and size of the spores corresponded to those of the original description. Phylogenetic analysis based on the 18 S rDNA sequence of M. dogieli showed that this species fit well in the genus Myxobolus. As no molecular data are available on spores from the type host, common carp, the species studied by us is temporarily designated as Myxobolus s. l. dogieli...|$|E
40|$|Abstract The genus Myxobolus, parasites that infect fishes, {{which cause}} <b>myxobolosis,</b> {{includes}} spore organisms {{belonging to the}} phylum Myxozoa and represents approximately 36 % of all species described for the entire phylum. This study describes lymphocytic meningoencephalomyelitis associated with Myxobolus sp. infection {{in the brain and}} spinal cord (the central nervous system, CNS) of Eigenmannia sp., from the Amazon estuary region, in the Administrative District of Outeiro (DAOUT), Belém, Pará, Brazil. In May and June 2015, 40 Eigenmannia sp. specimens were captured from this region and examined. The fish were anesthetized, slaughtered and dissected for sexing (gonad evaluation) and studying parasites and cysts; after diagnosing the presence of the myxozoans using a light microscope, small fragments of the brain and spinal cord were removed for histological processing and Hematoxylin-Eosin and Ziehl-Neelsen staining. Histopathological analysis of the brain and spinal cord, based on histological sections stained with Hematoxylin-Eosin, pronounced and diffuse edema in these tissues, and congestion, degeneration, and focal necrosis of the cerebral cortex. The present study describes lymphocytic meningoencephalomyelitis associated with infection by Myxobolus sp. in the central nervous system of Eigenmannia sp...|$|E
