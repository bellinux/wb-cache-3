5|$|The Friends of Richmond Park (FRP) {{was founded}} in 1961 to protect the park. In 1960 the speed limit in the park had been raised from 20 to 30 <b>miles</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> and there were {{concerns}} that the roads in the park would be assigned to the main highway system as had recently happened in parts of Hyde Park. In 1969, plans by the then Greater London Council to assign the park's roads to the national highway were revealed by the Friends and subsequently withdrawn. The speed limit was reduced to 20 <b>miles</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> {{in the summer of}} 2004.|$|E
5|$|Myers {{was already}} {{concerned}} in 1891 that Europe {{was much more}} advanced in balloon technology than the United States. He sent a letter of concern to the national newspapers claiming that {{if any of the}} European military powers wanted to they could annihilate New York City or any major city in northeastern United States. Newspapers printed his concerns that the next big war would be fought in the sky. Myers pointed out that Germany, France, England, Spain, the Netherlands, Belgium, Russia, Italy and China all had aeronautical apparatus, schools of practice, and secret experimental construction plants making state-of-the-art propeller power driven airships for war. He pointed out as early as October 1890 Commandant Charles Renard was in possession of a motor that could drive La France dirigible airship twenty-eight <b>miles</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> and such an airship or a war airship twice that size traveling at forty-five <b>miles</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> could totally destroy any major city in America without difficulty because of its speed. He was encouraging the government to recognize this and to prepare properly against this potential threat.|$|E
5|$|After {{their return}} to the U.S., the {{brothers}} and Katharine were invited to the White House where President Taft bestowed awards upon them. Dayton followed up with a lavish two-day homecoming celebration. In July 1909 Orville, with Wilbur assisting, completed the proving flights for the U.S. Army, meeting the requirements of a two-seater able to fly with a passenger for an hour {{at an average of}} speed of 40 <b>miles</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> (64km/h) and land undamaged. They sold the airplane to the Army's Aeronautical Division, U.S. Signal Corps for $30,000 (which included a $5,000 bonus for exceeding the speed specification). Wilbur climaxed an extraordinary year in early October when he flew at New York City's Hudson-Fulton celebrations, circling the Statue of Liberty and making a 33-minute flight up and down the Hudson River alongside Manhattan in view of up to one million New Yorkers. These flights solidly established the fame of the Wright brothers in America.|$|E

25|$|In the 1928 letter, he recounted what {{happened}} during those early attempts: “At the trials it would start to rise off the ground when a speed of twenty <b>miles</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> was attained. This speed was not sufficient to work the rudders, so, on account of its huge size and low speed, it was uncontrollable, and would spin round broadside directly after it left the ground. So I never flew with my first experimental plane, but no-one else did with their first for that matter”.|$|E
25|$|In the {{following}} few Australian seasons, Turner {{continued to do}} well even if too little cricket was played for him to equal his records of the late 1880s. In the relatively dry English summer of 1893, Turner still was Australia's leading bowler with 148 wickets at 13.63, but the absence of Ferris and business commitments were slowly taking their toll on him. During this tour his speed was measured electronically at Woolwich Arsenal and timed at 81 feet per second, or 55 <b>miles</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour.</b>|$|E
25|$|On April 4, 2008, {{while in}} a {{qualifying}} run for the 2008 Samsung 500 at Texas Motor Speedway, Michael McDowell struck the wall outside of Turn 1 head-on at 190 MPH, and proceeded to barrel-roll eight times as fire came from the engine compartment. McDowell emerged from the Toyota unharmed. The car, along with the SAFER barrier on the track wall, was praised for its safety, as the speed upon impact of the crash was about 30 <b>miles</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> more than Dale Earnhardt's fatal accident.|$|E

25|$|On horse-drawn and mule-drawn canals, {{snubbing}} posts {{were used}} to slow or stop a boat in the lock. A 200-ton boat moving at a few <b>miles</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> could destroy the lock gate. To prevent this, a rope was wound around the snubbing post as the boat entered the lock. Pulling on the rope slowed the boat, due to the friction of the rope against the post. A rope 2½ inches (6.3cm) in diameter and about 60 feet (18 meters) long was typically used on the Erie Canal to snub a boat in a lock.|$|E
25|$|Initially, {{mindful of}} the need to {{preserve}} their reputation for safety, the railway company allowed only the overall timings for the run to be put into print; neither The Times report of the following day nor Rous-Marten's article in The Railway Magazine of June 1904 mentioned the maximum speed. However, the morning after the run two local Plymouth newspapers did report that the train had reached a speed between 99 and 100 <b>miles</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> whilst descending Wellington Bank, Somerset. This claim was based on the stopwatch timings of a postal worker, William Kennedy, who was also on the train.|$|E
25|$|Whisner {{returned}} to the U.S. in March 1952. Whisner continued {{his career as a}} fighter pilot. Whisner also competed in air races, and in 1953, while a Major, he won the 1,900-mile Bendix Trophy Race, flying an F-86F Sabre jet from Edwards Air Force Base in California to Dayton, Ohio, in what was then a record time of 3 hours 5 minutes and 45 seconds, for an average speed of 603.5 <b>miles</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour.</b> He served with the 3596th Flying Training Squadron at Nellis Air Force Base until December 1954, when he went to Randolph Air Force Base to serve on the staff of Headquarters Crew Training Air Force.|$|E

25|$|Stein {{published}} {{an article on the}} biomechanics of Pteranodon flight. He crafted model Pteranodon wings and tested them in a wind tunnel. He found that Pteranodon was a capable, maneuverable flyer but was best adapted to long distance flights at low velocities. Stein calculated that a large Pteranodon would have to fly at least 10 <b>miles</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> to stay airborne. He concluded that Pteranodon would have had to land on its hind feet because making the front feet ready for landing would collapse the wings, which would no longer be useful for keeping the pterosaur aloft. Stein's conclusions contradicted the previous findings of Bramwell and Whitfield.|$|E
25|$|The Kenneth Arnold UFO {{sighting}} {{occurred on}} June 24, 1947, when private pilot Kenneth Arnold {{claimed that he}} saw a string of nine, shiny unidentified flying objects flying past Mount Rainier at speeds that Arnold estimated at a minimum of 1,200 <b>miles</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> (1,932km/hr). This was the first post-War sighting in the United States that garnered nationwide news coverage and is credited with being {{the first of the}} modern era of UFO sightings, including numerous reported sightings over the next two to three weeks. Arnold's description of the objects also led to the press quickly coining the terms flying saucer and flying disc as popular descriptive terms for UFOs.|$|E
25|$|Throughout {{this period}} both the US and USSR {{were working on}} anti-ballistic missile systems. Developing an ABM system was largely an {{engineering}} issue, requiring radars with high resolution and targeting computers that could adjust trajectories fast enough given an approach speed in thousands of <b>miles</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour.</b> Even though these items would be expensive, the ABM interceptor itself was likely to cost {{about the same as}} an ICBM (or less), so any increase in the enemy's stockpile could be countered for an additional expenditure of about the same amount. This was a game the US was clearly willing to play, although it would seem the USSR was considerably less capable of doing so given the size of the two countries' respective economies.|$|E

25|$|In 2007 and 2008, Wallenda was a {{featured}} {{performer in}} the Ringling Brothers production Bellobration, performing with Bello Nock on a newly contrived, double {{version of the}} Wheel of Steel. At {{the beginning of the}} act, Wallenda and Nock stood balanced atop twin circles 39feet in the air. To the audience, the circles appeared to be connected until the act started with a burst of fireworks. The wheels then split, sending the performers in opposite directions without safety nets or harnesses. To stay on the device, the duo had to move in unison, running at up to 20 <b>miles</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour.</b> Vibrations were transferred from one wheel to the other, meaning each performer was affected by what the other was doing. At the top of each arc the performers were rendered weightless, while being subjected to several times the force of gravity at the bottom.|$|E
25|$|As of June 2006, fares {{begin at}} $2.50 ($3.00 after 8:00p.m., and $3.50 {{during the peak}} weekday hours of 4:00–8:00p.m.) and {{increase}} based on the distance traveled and time spent in slow traffic (40 cents for each one-fifth of a mile or 60 seconds of no motion or motion under 12 <b>miles</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour).</b> The passenger also has to pay the toll whenever a cab is driven through a toll booth. The taxi must have an E-ZPass tag, and passengers pay the discounted E-ZPass toll rates. According to an April 2011 study by the Chicago Dispatcher, New York City taxis have a relatively low standard fare, charging an estimated $14.10 for a distance of five miles and five minutes wait time (compared to an estimated $18.48 in West Hollywood, CA and $12.87 in Houston, TX). Taxi drivers {{are not permitted to}} use cell phones while transporting passengers, even if they use a hands-free headset.|$|E
25|$|The Decapod {{developed}} mainly under Chief Draughtsman Frederick Vernon Russell was {{an extraordinary}} endeavour to develop a steam locomotive which could perform {{at the level of}} electric traction. It was built in 1902 to forestall an imminent scheme for an electrified railway out of London to suburbs served by the GER. Since the proponents of the scheme had a slogan about electric trains accelerating to thirty <b>miles</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> in thirty seconds, Holden resolved to obtain the same performance with steam traction. A massive boiler with Wootten firebox, three cylinders each with its own blastpipe cone, and ten smallish driving wheels ensured a lively acceleration. On trial it did rather better than 30mi/h (50km/h) in thirty seconds, accelerating at 1.46ft/s² (0.45m/s²): This performance {{put an end to the}} electrification scheme even though (as Holden had known all the time) the regular use of so massive a machine would never have been permitted by the civil engineer.|$|E
60|$|The {{morning of}} the 25th was calm, but the wind returned, a steady, gentle breeze from the south-east, when the day was far advanced, the caravels passing most of the hours of light {{floating}} near {{each other in a}} lazy indolence, or barely stirring the water with their stems, at a rate little, if any, exceeding that of <b>a</b> <b>mile</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour.</b>|$|R
