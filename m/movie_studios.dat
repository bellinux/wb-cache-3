5|$|Rand's work on The Fountainhead was {{repeatedly}} interrupted. In 1937, {{she took a}} break from it to write a novella called Anthem. She also completed a stage adaptation of We the Living that ran briefly in 1940. That same year, she became active in politics. She first worked as a volunteer in Wendell Willkie's presidential campaign, and then attempted to form a group for conservative intellectuals. As her royalties from earlier projects ran out, she began doing freelance work as a script reader for <b>movie</b> <b>studios.</b> When Rand finally found a publisher, the novel was only one-third complete.|$|E

Unlike previous trailers and videos, the shorts {{were the first to}} depict the Halo universe in a live-action setting. The production was a collaboration between Weta Workshop, Neill Blomkamp and Bungie. When asked about the shorts, Neill said that he hoped that it would help to interest <b>movie</b> <b>studios</b> in his currently inactive movie project, since it lost its studio support in October 2006. GameTrailers released a compilation of the three videos edited together, titling it Landfall.|$|E
5|$|A {{disappointed}} Uslan then wrote {{a script}} titled Return of the Batman {{to give the}} film industry {{a better idea of}} his vision for the film. Uslan later compared its dark tone to that of The Dark Knight Returns, which his script pre-dated by six years. In November 1979, producers Jon Peters and Peter Guber joined the project. Melniker and Uslan became executive producers. The four felt it was best to pattern the film's development after that of Superman (1978). Uslan, Melniker and Guber pitched Batman to Universal Pictures, but the studio turned it down. Though no <b>movie</b> <b>studios</b> were yet involved, the project was publicly announced with a budget of $15 million in July 1980 at the Comic Art Convention in New York. Warner Bros., the studio behind the successful Superman film franchise, decided to also accept and produce Batman.|$|E

25|$|Ultimately, {{this issue}} of the studios' {{allegedly}} illegal trade practices led to all the major <b>movie</b> <b>studios</b> being sued in 1938 by the U.S. Department of Justice.
