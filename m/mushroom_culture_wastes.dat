Mycelia ofL. decastes grew in the media containing both the fresh <b>culture</b> <b>waste</b> ofP. nameko and bark compost. However, it did not grow in the medium containing only the fresh <b>culture</b> <b>waste</b> ofP. nameko or in any media containing the fresh <b>culture</b> <b>waste</b> ofP. ostreatus. The mycelial growth inhibition in the fresh <b>culture</b> <b>wastes</b> ofP. ostreatus might be caused by the water-soluble inhibitors present. Mycelia ofL. decastes grew in all the media with aged <b>culture</b> <b>wastes</b> of bothP. ostreatus andP. nameko, which had been left outdoors for 6 months, regardless of whether bark compost was mixed.

According to this purpose, three fungal species from Basidiomycetes, namely Ganoderma lucidum (Curt. :Fr.) P. Karst, Lentinus edodes (Berkeley) Pegler and Pleurotus ostreatus (Jacquin ex Fries) Kummer were tested to determine their biological potential to grow on substrates made of wood wastes (sawdusts as well as shavings) which could be used in this way as main ingredients for preparation of natural culture composts. The experiments were achieved by in vitro growing of all these fungal species in special rooms, where the main culture parameters were kept at optimal levels {{in order to get the}} highest production of mushroom fruit bodies. The effects of culture compost composition (carbon, nitrogen and mineral sources) as well as other physical and chemical factors (such as: temperature, inoculum amount, pH level and incubation time, etc.) on mycelial net formation and especially on fruit body induction, were investigated. From all these fungal species tested in our experiments, P. ostreatus was registered as the fastest <b>mushroom</b> <b>culture,</b> then L. edodes and finally, G. lucidum as the longest <b>mushroom</b> <b>culture.</b> During the experiments, different logs of the same species were used as control samples for each culture compost variants.

40|$|The overall {{production}} of oak mushrooms has steadily increased in Korea, but the mushroom market is plagued {{with a wave}} of falling prices and intensified competition as imports of Chinese oak mushrooms increase. Imported Chinese oak mushrooms are mostly grown on sawdust blocks, which are costly in Korea because of higher labor costs and log prices. Mushroom farmers, therefore, strive to seek ways to compete with Chinese oak mushrooms, and the use of broad-leaved tree species is under consideration to promote sawdust-based mushroom cultivation. Korean oak mushrooms are expected to be more competitive when they are grown on sawdust rather than log while imports of Chinese mushrooms are still limited due to difficulties sustaining freshness. However, there are some obstacles such as the acquisition of superior strains of mushroom to promote sawdust cultivation of oak mushroom. Thus, The study investigated the status of production and sales of oak mushroom and the intent of mushroom farmers toward <b>mushroom</b> <b>culture</b> in wooden trays by conducting a questionnaire survey involving mushroom farmers in the two cities in Gyeonggi Province. Results of the study revealed that there were differences in production volume and revenue per oak log between mushroom farmers in the two areas. Many farmers showed distrustful reactions towards strains distributed because of frequent loss and damages caused by purchased strains. It is, therefore, necessary to encourage farmers to increase productivity by standardizing culture techniques and supplying good strains of mushrooms.

The findings of the study signifies the need for introducing effects of <b>mushroom</b> <b>culture</b> in wooden trays among mushroom farmers, and developing superior strains of mushrooms to promote mushroom growth using wooden trays...|$|R

25|$|Fungi are not plants, {{and require}} {{different}} conditions for optimal growth. Plants develop through photosynthesis, {{a process that}} converts atmospheric carbon dioxide into carbohydrates, especially cellulose. While sunlight provides an energy source for plants, mushrooms derive all of their energy and growth materials from their growth medium, through biochemical decomposition processes. This {{does not mean that}} light is an unnecessary requirement, since some fungi use light as a signal to induce fruiting. However, all the materials for growth must already be present in the growth medium. Instead of seeds, mushrooms reproduce sexually during underground growth, and asexually through spores. Either of these can be contaminated with airborne microorganisms, which will interfere with mushroom growth and prevent a healthy crop. Mycelium, or actively growing <b>mushroom</b> <b>culture,</b> is placed on growth substrate to seed or introduce mushrooms to grow on a substrate.

In nature, this fungus grows on dead wood, {{but it can be}} artificially cultivated on agricultural wastes (coffee husks, eucalyptus sawdust, corncobs and sugar cane bagasse). The degradation of agricultural wastes involves some enzyme complexes made up of oxidative (laccase, manganese peroxidase and lignin peroxidase) and hydrolytic enzymes (cellulases, xylanases and tanases).

The influence of specific pseudomonad populations and volatile organic compounds (VOC) on primordium {{formation of}} A. bisporus was studied in microcosm cultures. VOC produced by A. bisporus mycelium were predominantly C 8 compounds, some of which could inhibit primordium formation, with 1 -octen- 3 -ol being most inhibitory. A VOC produced by the rye grain substrate, 2 -ethyl- 1 -hexanol, on which A. bisporus was grown also inhibited primordium formation. 2 -Ethyl- 1 -hexanol and 1 -octen- 3 -ol were metabolized by pseudomonad populations and adsorbed by activated charcoal, with both modes of removal enabling primordium formation in the casing. Removal of VOC by ventilation also enabled primordium formation to occur under axenic conditions. The presence of 2 -ethyl- 1 -hexanol and 1 -octen- 3 -ol in the microcosms resulted in higher total bacterial and pseudomonad populations in the casing. The stimulatory effects of the casing and its microbiota and air exchange on primordium formation of A. bisporus at least partly are due to the removal of inhibitory C 8 compounds produced by the mycelium and its substrate.
