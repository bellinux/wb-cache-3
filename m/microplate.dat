5|$|The Adriatic Sea {{sits on the}} Apulian or Adriatic <b>Microplate,</b> which {{separated}} from the African Plate in the Mesozoic era. The plate's movement contributed {{to the formation of}} the surrounding mountain chains and Apennine tectonic uplift after its collision with the Eurasian plate. In the Late Oligocene, the Apennine Peninsula first formed, separating the Adriatic Basin {{from the rest of the}} Mediterranean. All types of sediment are found in the Adriatic, with the bulk of the material transported by the Po and other rivers on the western coast. The western coast is alluvial or terraced, while the eastern coast is highly indented with pronounced karstification. There are dozens of marine protected areas in the Adriatic, designed to protect the sea's karst habitats and biodiversity. The sea is abundant in flora and fauna—more than 7,000 species are identified as native to the Adriatic, many of them endemic, rare and threatened ones.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to study the dynamic {{characteristics}} of micromechanical rectangular plates used as sensing elements in a viscous compressible fluid. A novel modelling procedure for the plate- fluid interaction problem is developed on the basis of linearized Navier-Stokes equations and noslip conditions. Analytical expression for the fluidloading impedance is obtained using a double Fourier transform approach. This modelling work provides us an analytical means to study the effects of inertial loading, acoustic radiation and viscous dissipation of the fluid acting on the vibration of <b>microplates.</b> The numerical simulation is conducted on <b>microplates</b> with different boundary conditions and fluids with different viscosities. The simulation results reveal that the acoustic radiation dominates the damping mechanism of the submerged <b>microplates.</b> It is also proved that <b>microplates</b> offer better sensitivities (Q-factors) than the conventional beam type microcantilevers beingmass sensing platforms in a viscous fluid environment. The frequency response features of <b>microplates</b> under highly viscous fluid loading are studied using the present model. The dynamics of the <b>microplates</b> with all edges clamped are less influenced by the highly viscous dissipation of the fluid than the <b>microplates</b> with other types of boundary conditions...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{axisymmetric}} postbuckling of {{functionally graded material}} (FGM) annular <b>microplates</b> based on the modified couple stress theory, Mindlin plate theory and von Kármán geometric nonlinearity. Material properties {{are assumed to be}} graded in the thickness direction according to Mori-Tanaka homogenization method. By using the physical neutral plane, the bending-extension coupling is eliminated in both nonlinear governing equations and boundary conditions of FGM <b>microplates.</b> The differential quadrature (DQ) method is employed to discretise the governing equations, which are then solved to obtain the postbuckling path of FGM <b>microplates</b> with different boundary conditions. Numerical results are presented to highlight the effects of length scale parameter, gradient index, inner-to-outer radius ratio and radius-to-thickness ratio on the postbuckling characteristics of FGM <b>microplates.</b> It is found that FGM <b>microplates</b> do exhibit the bifurcation-type buckling when the applied in-plane compressive load acts along the physical neutral plane. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd...|$|R

25|$|An extinct ridge {{exists in}} western Iceland, {{leading to the}} theory that the plume has shifted east with time. The oldest crust of Iceland is more than 20 million years old and was formed at an old oceanic {{spreading}} center in the western fjord (Vestfirðir) region. The westward movement of the plates and the ridge above the plume and the strong thermal anomaly of the latter caused this old spreading center to cease 15 million years ago and lead to the formation of a new one in the area of today's peninsulas Skagi and Snæfellsnes; in the latter there is still some activity {{in the form of the}} Snæfellsjökull volcano. The spreading center, and hence the main activity, have shifted eastward again 7–9 million years ago and formed the current volcanic zones in the southwest (Reykjanes, Hofsjökull) and northeast (Tjörnes). Presently, a slow decrease of the activity in the northeast takes place, while the volcanic zone in the southeast (Katla, Vatnajökull), which was initiated 3 million years ago, develops. The reorganisation of the plate boundaries in Iceland has also been attributed to <b>microplate</b> tectonics.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{the free}} {{vibration}} behavior of post-buckled functionally graded (FG) Mindlin rectangular <b>microplates</b> are described {{based on the}} modified couple stress theory (MCST). This theory enables the consideration of the size-effect through introducing material length scale parameters. The FG <b>microplates</b> made of a mixture of metal and ceramic are considered whose volume fraction of components is expressed by a power law function. By means of Hamilton's principle, the nonlinear governing equations and associated boundary conditions are derived for FG micro-plates in the postbuckling domain. The governing equations and boundary conditions are then discretized by using the generalized differential quadrature (GDQ) method before solving numerically by the pseudo-arclength continuation technique. In the solution procedure, the postbuckling problem of <b>microplates</b> is investigated first. Afterwards, the free vibration of <b>microplates</b> around the buckled configuration is discussed.

500|$|The {{earthquake}} {{was caused}} by a rupture along the Abiz Fault, part of the Sistan suture zone of eastern Iran. Located northeast of the main collision zone between the Arabian and Eurasian tectonic plates, the Sistan zone marks the eastern boundary of the Iranian <b>microplate</b> where it intersects with the Afghan crustal block. Most of Iran is contained on one <b>microplate,</b> causing seismic activity mainly along its borders. Both the 1968 Dasht-e-Bayez earthquake (magnitude 7.3, resulting in 12,000–20,000deaths) and the Qayen earthquake were the results of strike-slip faults, meaning that the crustal blocks {{on either side of the}} faults shifted against each other horizontally. The Qayen earthquake {{was caused by}} right lateral movement along the Abiz Fault. In addition to the dominant strike-slip displacement, there was also local evidence of reverse faulting. The average displacement of about 2 m indicates a low static stress drop, more consistent with an interplate earthquake than an intraplate event. The maximum horizontal acceleration during the quake was approximately 6.9 meters per second—nearly three-quarters of the acceleration an object would have in free fall—and occurred near the earthquake's epicenter. The crustal layer involved in the rupture was [...] thick. The surface fault that caused the earthquake extended for , which was longer than would be expected given the earthquake's magnitude. There were at least 155aftershocks, reaching a magnitude of up to 5.5 on the Richter magnitude scale. Many of the aftershocks occurred along the rupture up to [...] below the surface.|$|E

The Vrancea zone, which is [...] away from Ciomadul, features ongoing earthquake activity; deep earthquakes suggest that a remnant of a slab exists beneath the Vrancea zone. This tectonic setting may also be responsible for volcanism at Ciomadul and the Persani volcanic field, [...] south of Ciomadul. Other theories on Ciomadul's volcanic activity imply delamination of the lithosphere or roll-back of the subduction zone.|$|E

50|$|Since the {{earliest}} {{surveys of the}} area, theories about {{the movement of the}} JF <b>Microplate</b> have evolved to include compression of the plate through rotational movement and also shear zones between two major plates and the JF <b>Microplate</b> driving this clockwise rotational movement. The Pacific Plate is estimated to have a spreading rate anywhere between 13 and 16 cm/yr in relation to the Juan Fernandez <b>MicroPlate.</b> This spreading ridge supplies magma {{to the west of the}} plate, acting as a lubricant. In the development stages of the <b>microplate,</b> the Pacific Plate also shared a coupled shear section to the south of the <b>microplate</b> and, together with the Nazca Plate, drove fast rotation of the <b>microplate.</b> Approximately 2.5 Ma ago the JF <b>Microplate</b> began decoupling from the Pacific Plate and coupling with the Antarctic Plate. The latter severely braked the rotational movement of the <b>microplate.</b> Now, the Nazca and Antarctica Plates, are the plates that share the current shear zones with transform faulting between them and the JF Plate. The Nazca Plate shears to the east while the Antarctica Plate shears relatively to the west, and this continues to drive the rotation of the <b>microplate</b> clockwise as well as consequential compression however at a much slower rate. Compression has been observed on the Juan Fernandez <b>Microplate</b> at the Pacific-Nazca-JF triple junction and the Nazca-Antarctic-JF triple junction, due to the slightly irregular shape of the plate which does not rotate perfectly about its center.|$|E
