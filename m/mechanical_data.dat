500|$|In 2008 a team {{of seven}} {{researchers}} conducted tests at Rice University, including Peter Weyand, Hugh Herr, Rodger Kram, Matthew Bundle and Alena Grabowski. The team collected metabolic and <b>mechanical</b> <b>data</b> by indirect calorimetry and ground reaction force measurements on Pistorius' performance during constant-speed, level treadmill running, {{and found that the}} energy usage was 3.8 percent lower than average values for elite non-disabled distance runners, 6.7 percent lower than for average distance runners and 17 percent lower than for non-disabled 400m sprint runners. At sprinting speeds of 8.0, 9.0 and 10.0m/s, Pistorius produced longer foot to ground contact times, shorter leg swing times, and lower average vertical forces than able bodied sprinters. The team concluded that running on the blades appears to be physiologically similar but mechanically different from running with biological legs. The study was published several months later in the Journal of Applied Physiology. Kram also stated that Pistorius' [...] "rate of energy consumption was lower than an average person but comparable to other high-caliber athletes." ...|$|E

50|$|The {{concept of}} size {{principle}} {{can be applied}} to therapeutic techniques. It was shown that the use of electrical stimulation of muscles for motor control would stimulate large, fatigable motor unit first. For many years it has been believed that the use of electromyostimulation (EMS) to stimulate muscle contraction creates a reversal of the general size principle recruitment order, due to the larger motor unit axons having a lower resistance to electric current. Recently, however, the results of the studies purporting this theory have come under some minor contention. In an article titled “Recruitment Patterns in Human Skeletal Muscle During Electrical Stimulation”, Professors Chris M. Gregory and C. Scott Bickel propose instead that the muscle fiber recruitment induced by EMS is non-selective pattern that is both spatially fixed and temporally synchronous. They back this claim with physiological data, metabolic data, <b>mechanical</b> <b>data,</b> and even by re-examining the results of other studies which claimed the reverse size principle paradigm.|$|E

40|$|Image {{functional}} modeling (IFM) {{has been introduced}} as a method to simultaneously synthesize imaging and <b>mechanical</b> <b>data</b> with computational models to determine the degree and location of airway constriction in asthma. Using lung imaging provided by hyperpolarized 3 He MRI, we advanced our IFM method to require matching not only to ventilation defect location but to specific ventilation throughout the lung. Imaging and <b>mechanical</b> <b>data</b> were acquired for four healthy and four asthmatic subjects pre- and postbronchial challenge. After provocation, we first identified maximum-size airways leading exclusively to ventilation defects and highly constricted them. Constriction patterns were then found for the remaining airways to match <b>mechanical</b> <b>data.</b> Ventilation images were predicted for each pattern, and visual and statistical comparisons were done with measured data. Results showed that matching of ventilation defects requires severe constriction of small airways. The mean constriction of such airways leading to the ventilation defects needed to be 70 – 80 % rather than fully closed. Also, central airway constriction alone could not account for dysfunction seen in asthma, so small airways must be involved...|$|E

Creep data for some aluminum alloys is presented in (Maljaars et al. 2008; Maljaars et al. 2005; Maljaars et al. 2009 a; Maljaars et al. 2009 b), (Faggiano et al. 2004), and (Mazzolani 1995).

Aluminum alloys contain a wide range of chemical compositions and tempers, even within the same alloy family (e.g., 5 xxx-series wrought aluminum alloys). Thus, the elevated temperature mechanical properties required to analyze and model the structural response must be measured for the specific aluminum alloy of interest. Note, careful consideration of alloy microstructures may allow for extrapolation of existing mechanical properties to other similar aluminum alloys.|$|R
