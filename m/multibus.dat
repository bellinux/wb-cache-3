50|$|The Adept OS at {{that time}} was called V, and it ran on the refrigerator-sized {{controllers}} that were based on the <b>MultiBus</b> technology. Around 1986 the Adept MC controller was introduced; while still based on the <b>MultiBus,</b> it was smaller than the original controller. After the Adept MC controller (around 1990), came the Adept MV controller, which was based on the VME backplane technology. Then around 2000 the SmartController CS/CX controllers were introduced, which are current production as of 2009.|$|E

50|$|The CPU board {{included}} 256 KB {{of memory}} {{which could be}} replaced or augmented with two additional memory cards {{for a total of}} 2 MB. Although the memory cards used the <b>Multibus</b> form factor, they only used the <b>Multibus</b> interface for power; all memory access was via the smaller private P2 bus. This was a synchronous private memory bus which allowed for simultaneous memory input/output transfers. It also allowed for full performance zero wait state operation of the memory. When installing the first 1 MB expansion board either the 256 Kb of memory on the CPU board or the first 256 KB on the expansion board had to be disabled.|$|E
50|$|But the Tiger {{looked more}} like a DEC {{computer}} - it had a (<b>Multibus)</b> backplanethat would hold up to 10 plug-in cards into this mainframe, and was one of if not the first multi-microprocessor based mainframe systems.|$|E
5000|$|... iRMX III on Intel <b>Multibus</b> {{hardware}} {{is used in}} {{the majority}} core systems on CLSCS the London Underground Central line signals control system was supplied by Westinghouse now Invensys and commissioned in the late 1990s. The Central line is an automatic train operation line. Automatic train protection is by trackside and train borne equipment that does not use iRMX. It is the automatic train supervision elements that use a mix of iRMX on <b>Multibus,</b> and Solaris on Sparc computers. 16 iRMX local site computers are distributed along the Central line together with 6 central iRMX computers at the control centre. All 22 iRMX computers are dual redundant. iRMX CLSCS continues in full operation in 2011.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>Multibus</b> {{specification}} {{was important}} {{because it was a}} robust, well-thought out industry standard with a relatively large form factor, so complex devices could be designed on it. Because it was a well-defined and well-documented industry standard, it allowed a Multibus-compatible industry to grow around it, with many companies making card cages and enclosures for it. Many others made CPU, memory, and other peripheral boards. In 1982 there were over 100 <b>Multibus</b> board and systems manufacturers. [...] This allowed complex systems to be built from commercial off-the-shelf hardware, and also allowed companies to innovate by designing a proprietary <b>Multibus</b> board and then integrating it with other vendors' hardware to create a system. A good example of this was Sun Microsystems with their Sun 1 and Sun 2 workstations. Sun built custom-designed CPU, memory, SCSI, and video display boards, and then added 3Com Ethernet networking boards, Xylogics SMD disk controllers, Ciprico Tapemaster 1/2 inch tape controllers, Sky Floating Point Processor, and Systech 16-port Terminal Interfaces in order to configure the system as a workstation or a file server. Other workstation vendors who used Multibus-based designs included HP/Apollo and Silicon Graphics IRIS.|$|E

50|$|Sun {{provided}} 1 Mb <b>Multibus</b> memory {{boards and}} 1 MB and 4 MB VMEbus memory boards but only supported configurations {{with a maximum}} of 4 MB RAM. Companies such as Helios Systems also made 4 MB memory boards that would work in Sun systems.|$|E
50|$|The {{company was}} founded in 2000 as a {{spin-off}} of RadiSys Corporation to exploit the RTOS technology based on the iRMX and INtime for Windows products originally developed by Intel Corporation. RadiSys acquired the iRMX and INtime RTOS technology when they purchased Intel's <b>Multibus</b> division in 1996.|$|E
5000|$|The {{system could}} {{communicate}} image data externally over an 80M per second [...] "Yapbus" [...] or a 2M per second <b>multibus</b> to other hosts, data sources or disks {{and had a}} performance measured equivalent to 200 VUPS, or 200 times {{the speed of a}} VAX 11/780.|$|E
50|$|With Dunn's help, Simmons {{developed}} the VG123 <b>Multibus</b> and Q-bus frame grabber boards. During this development, Paul Bloom {{was killed in}} what was apparently a gangland style murder. The mystery of why this happened has never been solved. Dave Erickson was promoted to engineering manager to replace Bloom.|$|E
5000|$|IEEE-796: Microcomputer System Bus; First {{released}} by Intel in 1974. The cards {{did not use}} front panels, and they used card edge fingers as the connectors (similar to ISA/PC-AT cards).

50|$|After initial success {{building}} a <b>Multibus</b> chassis with a self-contained VT-100-compatible CRT display terminal to OEMs, the company {{designed and built}} desktop workstations named Unistar using the Sun-1 board, {{which was based on}} the Motorola 68000 CPU, and which ran UNIX licensed from AT&T. The manufacturing consisted of building the chassis, power supplies, motherboard, and a few critical <b>Multibus</b> boards such as the CPU, memory, and floppy and hard drive controllers. Other peripheral boards such as an Ethernet controller were purchased from other OEMs. The software development consisted chiefly of writing device drivers for the integrated system, based on the UNIX kernel, and integrating third-party applications for resale to customers. Investment totaled $10 million, raised from the founders and from venture capital. Employment peaked in 1984 at 80 persons.|$|E
