Official figures gave the episode ratings of 8.86million for its original airing and 740,000 for its 10pm repeat on BBC Three. Brown's performance in the episode was praised by Robert Hanks of The Independent who wrote: [...] "I don't ever remember hearing anybody on a soap talk like this before. I <b>mean,</b> <b>like</b> a real person, with real feelings, such as self-pity and a desperate urge for self-preservation. Brown conveyed the seedy gloom of it all beautifully, as well." [...] Nancy Banks-Smith of The Guardian deemed Brown possibly {{the only member of}} the cast, with the exception of Barbara Windsor (Peggy Mitchell), capable of carrying such a monologue, opining that she [...] "carried it off magnificently". She took issue with Dot's characterisation, however, believing that Dot is presented as the serial's [...] "moral compass", and would not leave her husband in a nursing home.|$|E

[...] Conversely, Tim Teeman posed the question in The Times: [...] "I know she’s a national institution and June Brown plays her like a dream, but was last night’s Dot Cotton extravaganza really that great? Or even necessary?" [...] Teeman opined that: [...] "Quite rightly, the producers want to eke as much gold out of the character and actress as possible: both are fantastic. But this was much-loved character overkill." [...] He deemed Dot a [...] "soap icon", however he also assessed that: ...|$|E

I <b>mean,</b> <b>like,</b> bad. But it was too late. It was already public. The album was going out. So I did what I always did: try {{to make the best of}} a situation and start covering up. Put on a good face. And honestly, I'm glad the thing didn't sell, because if it had sold well it would have been really tough. I would look like I was going to walk away from something that I'd just built." ...|$|E

Cobain's request prompted the show's producer to ask him, [...] "You <b>mean</b> <b>like</b> a funeral?", to which the singer replied, [...] "Exactly. Like a funeral." [...] Nirvana was augmented by guitarist Pat Smear and cellist Lori Goldston, who had been touring with the band. Despite the show's premise, Cobain insisted on running his acoustic guitar through his amplifier and effects pedals. Coletti built a fake box {{in front of the}} amplifier to disguise it as a monitor wedge. Coletti said, [...] "It was Kurt's security blanket. He was used to hearing this guitar through his Fender. He wanted those effects. You can hear it on 'The Man Who Sold the World.' It's an acoustic guitar, but he's obviously going through an amp." ...|$|E

In 2015, Stone posed naked for the September issue of Harper's Bazaar magazine, in which she stated: [...] "At a certain point you start asking yourself, 'What really is sexy?'
