5|$|Extirpation {{of prairie}} dogs can also {{contribute}} to regional and local biodiversity loss, increased seed depredation, and the establishment and spread of invasive shrubs. Burrowing rodents may eat the fruiting bodies of fungi and spread spores through their feces, thereby allowing the fungi to disperse and form symbiotic relationships with the roots of plants (which usually cannot thrive without them). As such, these rodents <b>may</b> <b>play</b> <b>a</b> <b>role</b> in maintaining healthy forests.|$|E
5|$|Genetics <b>may</b> <b>play</b> <b>a</b> <b>role</b> in {{the risk}} that a person will develop PTE; people with the ApoE-ε4 allele may be at higher risk for PTE. The {{haptoglobin}} Hp2-2 allele may be another genetic risk factor, possibly because it binds hemoglobin poorly and thus allows more iron to escape and damage tissues. However, most {{studies have found that}} having family members with epilepsy does not significantly increase the risk of PTS, suggesting that genetics are not a strong risk factor.|$|E
5|$|Seasons <b>may</b> <b>play</b> <b>a</b> <b>role</b> in some regions. A {{dramatic}} change in colour and texture is created by seasonal snowy conditions in northern latitudes, necessitating repainting of vehicles and separate snow oversuits. The Eastern and northern European countries have a tradition for separate winter uniforms rather than oversuits. During the Second World War, the Waffen-SS went a step further, developing reversible uniforms with separate schemes for summer and autumn, as well as white winter oversuits.|$|E

5|$|The next ring {{is named}} the Le Verrier ring after Urbain Le Verrier, who {{predicted}} Neptune's position in 1846. With an orbital radius of about 53,200km, it is narrow, with a width of about 113km. Its normal optical depth is 0.0062±0.0015, which corresponds to an equivalent depth of 0.7±0.2km. The dust fraction in the Le Verrier ring ranges from 40% to 70%. The small moon Despina, which orbits just {{inside of it}} at 52,526km, <b>may</b> <b>play</b> <b>a</b> <b>role</b> in the ring's confinement by acting as a shepherd.|$|E
5|$|Numerous other {{abnormalities}} {{have been}} described in hepatic encephalopathy, although their relative contribution to the disease state is uncertain. Loss of glutamate transporter gene expression (especially EAAT 2) {{has been attributed to}} acute liver failure. Benzodiazepine-like compounds have been detected at increased levels as well as abnormalities in the GABA neurotransmission system. An imbalance between aromatic amino acids (phenylalanine, tryptophan and tyrosine) and branched-chain amino acids (leucine, isoleucine and valine) has been described; this would lead to the generation of false neurotransmitters (such octopamine and 2-hydroxyphenethylamine). Dysregulation of the serotonin system, too, has been reported. Depletion of zinc and accumulation of manganese <b>may</b> <b>play</b> <b>a</b> <b>role.</b> Inflammation elsewhere in the body may precipitate encephalopathy through the action of cytokines and bacterial lipopolysaccharide on astrocytes.|$|E
5|$|While the {{domestic}} horse and donkey (along with their feral descendants) exist worldwide, wild equine populations {{are limited to}} Africa and Asia. Wild equine social systems come in two forms; a harem system with tight-knit groups consisting of one adult male or stallion, several females or mares and their young or foals; and a territorial system where males establish territories with resources that attract females, which associate very fluidly. In both systems, females {{take care of their}} offspring but males <b>may</b> <b>play</b> <b>a</b> <b>role</b> as well. Equines communicate with each other both visually and vocally. Human activities have threatened wild equine populations and out of the seven living species, only the plains zebra remains widespread and abundant.|$|E

5|$|Additionally, the {{development}} of Theory of Mind <b>may</b> <b>play</b> <b>a</b> <b>role</b> in emotional development. Theory of Mind {{is the ability to}} know that the experience of knowledge and intention lies behind human actions such as facial expressions. Although it is reported that very young infants have different responses to humans than to non-human objects, Theory of Mind develops relatively gradually and possibly results from predictable interactions with adults. However, some ability of this kind must be in place before mutual communication through gaze or other gesture can occur, as it does by seven to nine months. Some neurodevelopmental disorders, such as autism, have been attributed to the absence of the mental functions that underlie Theory of Mind. It is possible that the congenital absence of this ability, or the lack of experiences with caregivers who communicate in a predictable fashion, could underlie {{the development}} of reactive attachment disorder.|$|E
5|$|Being herbivores, {{blackbuck}} graze on low grasses, occasionally browsing as well. They prefer sedges, fall witchgrass, mesquite, {{and live}} oak. They have occasionally been observed browsing on acacia {{trees in the}} Cholistan Desert. Oats and berseem {{were found to be}} palatable and nutritious to captive populations in a study. A study in the Velavadar Black Buck Sanctuary (Gujarat, India) showed that Dichanthium annulatum comprised 35 percent of their diet. Digestion of nutrients, especially crude proteins, was poor in summer, but more efficient in the rainy and winter seasons. Consequently crude protein intake in summer was very low, even below the recommended value. Blackbuck had a lower food consumption in summer. The fruits of Prosopis juliflora are often eaten, and blackbuck <b>may</b> <b>play</b> <b>a</b> <b>role</b> in their dispersal. Prosopis becomes a significant food item if grasses are scarce. Water is a daily requirement of the blackbuck.|$|E
5|$|Genetics <b>may</b> <b>play</b> <b>a</b> <b>role</b> in a person's {{disposition}} to SAH; risk is increased three- to fivefold in first-degree relatives of people {{having had a}} subarachnoid hemorrhage. However, lifestyle factors are more important in determining overall risk. These risk factors are smoking, hypertension (high blood pressure), and excessive alcohol consumption. Having smoked in the past confers a doubled risk of SAH {{compared to those who}} have never smoked. Some protection of uncertain significance is conferred by caucasian ethnicity, hormone replacement therapy, and diabetes mellitus. There is likely an inverse relationship between total serum cholesterol and the risk of non-traumatic SAH, though confirmation of this association is hindered by a lack of studies. Approximately 4 percent of aneurysmal bleeds occur after sexual intercourse and 10 percent of people with SAH are bending over or lifting heavy objects at the onset of their symptoms.|$|E

5|$|MS is {{more common}} in regions with {{northern}} European populations and the geographic variation may simply reflect the global distribution of these high-risk populations. Decreased sunlight exposure resulting in decreased vitamin D production has also been put forward as an explanation. A relationship between season of birth and MS lends support to this idea, with fewer people born in the northern hemisphere in November as compared to May being affected later in life. Environmental factors <b>may</b> <b>play</b> <b>a</b> <b>role</b> during childhood, with several studies finding that people who move to a different region of the world before the age of 15 acquire the new region's risk to MS. If migration takes place after age 15, however, the person retains the risk of his home country. There is some evidence that the effect of moving may still apply to people older than 15.|$|E
5|$|The {{mechanism}} behind arterial thrombosis, such as {{with heart}} attacks, is more established than {{the steps that}} cause venous thrombosis. With arterial thrombosis, blood vessel wall damage is required, as it initiates coagulation, but clotting in the veins mostly occurs without any such damage. The beginning of venous thrombosis {{is thought to be}} caused by tissue factor, which leads to conversion of prothrombin to thrombin, followed by fibrin deposition. Red blood cells and fibrin are the main components of venous thrombi, and the fibrin appears to attach to the blood vessel wall lining (endothelium), a surface that normally acts to prevent clotting. Platelets and white blood cells are also components. Platelets are not as prominent in venous clots as they are in arterial ones, but they <b>may</b> <b>play</b> <b>a</b> <b>role.</b> Inflammation is associated with VTE, and white blood cells {{play a role in the}} formation and resolution of venous clots.|$|E
5|$|The {{proteasome}} subcomponents {{are often}} referred to by their Svedberg sedimentation coefficient (denoted S). The proteasome most exclusively used in mammals is the cytosolic 26S proteasome, which is about 2000 kilodaltons (kDa) in molecular mass containing one 20S protein subunit and two 19S regulatory cap subunits. The core is hollow and provides an enclosed cavity in which proteins are degraded; openings at the two ends of the core allow the target protein to enter. Each end of the core particle associates with a 19S regulatory subunit that contains multiple ATPase active sites and ubiquitin binding sites; it is this structure that recognizes polyubiquitinated proteins and transfers them to the catalytic core. An alternative form of regulatory subunit called the 11S particle can associate with the core in essentially {{the same manner as}} the 19S particle; the 11S <b>may</b> <b>play</b> <b>a</b> <b>role</b> in degradation of foreign peptides such as those produced after infection by a virus.|$|E
