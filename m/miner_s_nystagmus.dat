40|$|Aeroelastic {{design and}} fatigue {{analysis}} of large utility-scale {{wind turbine blades}} are performed. The applied fatigue model is based on established methods and is incorporated in an iterative numerical design tool for realistic wind turbine blades. All aerodynamic and structural design properties are available in literature. The software tool FAST is used for advanced aero-servo-elastic load calculations and stress-histories are calculated with elementary beam theory. According to wind energy design standards, a turbulent wind load case is implemented. Fatigue loads are estimated based on 100 % availability and a site-specific annual wind distribution. Rainflow cycle counting and <b>Miner</b> <b>s</b> sum for cumulative damage prediction is used together with constant life diagrams tailored to actual material S-N data. Material properties are based on 95 % survival probability, 95 % confidence level, and additional material safety factors to maintain conservative results. Fatigue performance is first evaluated for the baseline blade design of the 10 MW NOWITECH reference wind turbine. Results show that blade damage is dominated by tensile stresses due to poorer tensile fatigue characteristics of the shell glass fiber material. The interaction between turbulent wind and gravitational fluctuations is demonstrated to greatly influence the damage. The need for relevant S-N data to closely predict such blade stress cycle events is investigated to avoid non-conservative conclusions. State-of-art wind turbine blade trends are discussed and different designs of the NOWITECH baseline blade are analyzed in a parametric study focusing on fatigue performance and material costs...|$|R

Empirically, we have determined that after 8 hours at an ambient temperature of 25 C, the average light output of an incandescent cap lamp can decrease to about 69 % of its initial value when powered by a lead-acid battery and it can decrease to about 65 % of its initial value when powered by a nickel-hydride battery. An LED-based cap lamp using a constant current drive circuit can maintain about 96 % of its initial value when powered by a nickel-hydride battery. Real-world tests addressing the effects of ambient temperature and airflow on the light output of an LED and incandescent cap lamp were conducted in the NIOSH Safety Research Coal Mine (SRCM). The LED cap lamp yielded a vertical average illuminance improvement of approximately 9. 5 % and the INC cap lamp yielded a vertical average illuminance degradation o f approximately 4 %. The differences between LED and incandescent cap lamps were further quantified by the calculation of mesopic luminance data that indicated for the same photopic luminance (i. e., as measured using a conventional light meter) the LED cap lamp could be up to 38 % more efficient than the incandescent cap lamp with a lead-acid battery {{at the end of the}} 10 -hour driving cycle.

In contrast, comparatively {{little is known}} about the cortical representation of the human vestibular system. In this study we applied caloric stimulation and fMRI to further characterize human cortical vestibular areas and to test for hemispheric dominance of vestibular information processing. For caloric vestibular stimulation we used cold nitrogen in order to avoid susceptibility artifacts induced by water calorics. Right and left side vestibular stimulation was repetitively performed inducing a nystagmus for at least 90 s after the end of the stimulation in all subjects. Only the first 60 <b>s</b> of this <b>nystagmus</b> period were included for statistical analysis and compared with the baseline condition. Activation maps revealed a cortical network, which in all subjects comprised the temporo-parietal junction extending into the posterior insula, furthermore the anterior insula, pre- and postcentral gyrus, areas in the parietal lobe, the ventrolateral portion of the occipital lobe, and the inferior frontal gyrus extending into the inferior part of the precentral sulcus. These structures represent the major cortical areas involved in vestibular cortical signal processing as identified by animal experiments. Furthermore, this study demonstrated a strong right hemispheric dominance of vestibular cortex areas regardless of the stimulated side, consistent with the current view of a rightward asymmetrical cortical network for spatial orientation. We conclude that caloric stimulation is a suitable method for the investigation of the vestibular system with fMRI...|$|R

40|$|A Paradigm Shift As market economists, mine {{managers}} {{are interested in}} "staying in business" and even "prospering. " Bottom-line results are the "order of the day. " Concern for bottom-line results invokes questions such as: How much was produced? At what cost? And, was anyone injured? While these questions will always carry everyday emphasis at the mine, they are fundamentally lacking in that they often appear, especially to lower levels of management and to the production worker, as preeminent concerns. Driven by market economics, many organizations have decentralized, outsourced, downsized, restructured, and formed new coalitions. Investments in new technology and concentration on productivity have been part and parcel with these changes, contributing to improvements in both safety and efficiency. A reason for (and, perhaps a result of) these improvements has been {{the development of a}} highly experienced and flexible work force. These changes in mining present an interesting opportunity to modify a few paradigms about work life in general, and perhaps a few paradigms about how we invest in the miner, in particular. Studying these issues now might offer some interesting opportunities for the future, as the foundations {{for the next generation of}} mine workers are laid. With the average "experienced" U. <b>S.</b> <b>miner</b> five to fifteen years from retirement, perhaps a key determinant of future success in the world market might be how well we make the transition from today's work force to the work force of tomorrow.

Many miners are also exposed to significant health hazards, including coal and silica dust, diesel exhaust, and noise. More than 1000 U. <b>S.</b> <b>miners</b> die of lung disease each year (NIOSH, 1999). Mine safety and health professionals have long recognized training as a critical element of an effective safety and health program. Federal regulations (30 CFR, Parts 46 and 48) require mine operators to provide initial safety and health training to all new miners, as well as a minimum of 8 hours of refresher training each year. The time and money being spent to train U. <b>S.</b> <b>miners</b> is substantial, and so there is a strong and steady demand for new and better mine training materials and methods. A growing concern among mine safety professionals regards the training of new workers. A major change in the mining workforce is anticipated within the next decade. In major segments of mining, especially coal, relatively few workers have been hired since the 1970 's. Thus, as an entire cohort of miners in the current workforce nears retirement, the replacement of these employees will require an influx of new workers. New miners may be young people who lack the ability to recognize and respond to mining hazards in an appropriate manner. They may also have had different educational experiences than their older counterparts. Many safety professionals believe that these two cohorts require different approaches to training. The papers in this report should help prepare mine trainers for the changes about to occur in the workforce and acquaint them with strategies they can use to enhance the effectiveness of their training. The first three papers present basic principles for teaching adults. The five remaining papers are intended to illustrate how these principles {{can be applied to the}} development and imple 2 of effective training for miners. Below is an overview of these papers. 1. Kowalski and Vaught review the process and principles of adult learning. The learning model they present includes a discussion of goals, content, delivery, assessment, and remediation. Adults are viewed as active learners, experienced-based, expert in their own right in specific areas, independent, real-life centered, task-centered, problem-centered, solution-driven, skill-seeking, self-directing, and internally and externally motivated. Basic aspects of curriculum development are briefly reviewed. For further information about adult learning, see Camm and Cullen's paper. 2. Mallett and Reinke's first paper discusses issues related to training new miners who have recently or will soon be entering the mining workforce. These new generations of miners have different learning style preferences and training needs than Baby Boomers and other older miners.

40|$|Longwall mining {{has gained}} the {{reputation}} {{as being the}} safest extraction method in underground coal mines. However, {{one of the most}} difficult tasks associated with longwall mining is moving the face once a panel is completed. Based on Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) fatality reports since 1996, longwall face recovery operations have claimed the lives of 5 U. <b>S.</b> <b>miners</b> and have resulted in numerous injuries. Recovery operations can be hazardous because they involve moving large pieces of equipment in very confined spaces. They are also conducted in highly stressed ground conditions due to front abutment loads generated by panel extraction. Shield removal is the most hazardous operation during face recovery because miners are constantly exposed to the unpredictable gob edge. To protect the miners, one or more walking shields, cribbing and/or other supplemental roof and standing supports are typically employed as breaker line supports as each shield is removed. At the Harris No. 1 Mine in southern WV, mobile roof supports (MRS 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 122 s) have been used in lieu of traditional walking shields on 17 face moves since 1997. MRS 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 122 s are shield-like support units mounted on crawler tracks and are commonly used during room-and-pillar retreat mining operations. For longwall recovery, the two biggest advantages that MRS 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 122 s have over traditional walking shields are that they are remotely controlled and are highly maneuverable. MRS 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 122 s have contributed to safer shield recovery and shorter move times at the Harris No. 1 Mine. This paper will address both the safety and the operational issues associated with MRS usage during shield recovery.

It is hoped that this publication will give the reader an appreciation for the work of mining health and safety researchers over the past century, and of the miners served by this research. Although not a comprehensive history, this report highlights the key organizational changes made within the Bureau and the federal government that affected mining safety and health research. Some mention is also made of Bureau research not directly related to mining health and safety. Note that the work classified as safety and health research has varied over the last century. For example, before 1970 the Bureau separated mining research and safety and health research. At that time, mining research included ground control and methane drainage because they had direct implications for mine safety. Explosives research was also reported separately from health and safety, even though permissible explosives research was obviously related to safety. Therefore, where budget figures from the Bureau are mentioned in this report, it is often not possible to separate safety and health research from other types of research. This history is generally chronological, with a few exceptions. Because of their prominence and direct links to Bureau research, most of the Public Health Service mining studies completed before 1970, when NIOSH was established, will be discussed in a single section, even though the work spanned many decades. Likewise, for convenience, the brief histories of the Bureau 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 122 s mining research centers are located in one section...|$|R
