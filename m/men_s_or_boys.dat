40|$|I {{study the}} short- to medium-run effects on {{subsequent}} health outcomes {{of starting a}} career on a fixed-term contract. I focus on career start since I expect that temporary contracts and their inherent economic uncertainty imply a path dependence that might have spill-over effects on other domains of life. The empirical analysis is based on rich data from the German Socio-Economic Panel, which provides comprehensive information about individuals labor market history as well as health conditions. My main results are the following. (i) Women react to fixed-term employment {{at the beginning of}} their career by experiencing worse mental health in the short run. This relationship is driven by the subjective perception of stress and pressure in these jobs, fades out over time, and is strongest in the sam-ple of women with secondary education. (ii) Women s physical health is not af-fected at all. (iii) Economic uncertainty due to fixed-term employment has no fu-ture consequences for <b>men</b> <b>s</b> mental <b>or</b> physical health. I argue that these findings are robust to several sensitivity tests as well as to potential endogeneity threats...|$|R

40|$|In this {{dissertation}} we aim {{to present}} different ways of understanding men using the relationship between being and movement in the thought of Aristotle. According to the philosopher, nature is the proper scope to investigate beings that can change. Therefore, first of all we will analyze the importance {{of men in the}} formulation of the definition of movement. With that purpose in mind, we will contrast art and nature. Consequently, {{we will be able to}} investigate the Aristotelian understanding about the best possible realization for <b>men</b> <b>s</b> life, <b>or</b> rather, happiness. We sustain that the notion of happiness is onto-cosmologically grounded on the close relationship between the notion of movement and the first principle that opens the Nicomachean Ethics. At last, we will analyze what it means to guide itself by reason, since we have in view the search for self-fulfillment. In other words, we will investigate how men form a moral virtue by and for a reality in change. Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível SuperiorApresentaremos nesta dissertação algumas maneiras de compreender o homem por meio da relação entre ser e movimento no pensamento de Aristóteles. Para o filósofo, a natureza é o âmbito próprio para se pensar os entes passíveis de mudança. Assim, analisaremos, em primeiro lugar, a importância do humano na formulação da definição de movimento. Para tanto, utilizaremos do contraste entre arte e natureza. Em seguida, estaremos aptos para investigar a compreensão aristotélica sobre a melhor realização possível para uma vida humana, a saber, a felicidade. Veremos como a noção de felicidade está onto-cosmologicamente fundamentada pela imbricação entre a noção de movimento e pelo princípio primeiro que abre a Ética Nicomaquéia. Por fim, analisaremos o que significa orientar-se pela razão, tendo em vista a busca pela plena realização de si. Ou seja, investigaremos como o homem forma uma virtude moral a partir e para a lida com a realidade em mudança...|$|R
40|$|The study {{investigated}} South African <b>men</b> <b>s</b> clothing involvement {{and the possible}} influences of {{various factors such as}} demographic characteristics, expenditure on clothing, the frequency of clothing purchases, store patronage and <b>men</b> <b>s</b> work dress code. A survey was conducted across Gauteng which is the largest retail hub in South Africa with mainly urban areas. Most consumers in Gauteng have access to different clothing retailers. Consulta Research, a professional research company assisted with data collection. Data was collected by means of convenient sampling. Online questionnaires were distributed to their data base and a total of 479 usable questionnaires were completed. Data analysis consisted of descriptive statistics, exploratory factor analysis, ANOVA s, Chi square tests and other post hoc tests. The study confirmed that men clothing involvement is not equally strong for all four dimensions of clothing involvement that are distinguished in literature. Previous studies suggested that involvement should be studied from an age ordering perspective, and therefore respondents demographic characteristics were vital in terms of the analysis of the data. Certain demographic characteristics seemed to be good indicators of <b>men</b> <b>s</b> clothing involvement, namely age and marital status while factors such as work dress code surprisingly {{do not seem to be}} useful to predict <b>men</b> <b>s</b> clothing involvement. The majority of the sample spent less than 5 % of their monthly household income on clothing for themselves and indicated that they purchase clothing sporadically when necessary. Findings nevertheless indicated that expenditure on their clothing and frequency of clothing purchases are useful indicators of <b>men</b> <b>s</b> clothing involvement. Although younger men (generation Y) were more inclined to patronise specialised <b>men</b> <b>s</b> clothing retailers, irrespective of their work dress code, the majority of men patronised general retailers and department stores when purchasing their clothing. Findings confirm that consumption- and purchase involvement are the prevalent forms of clothing involvement that are relevant in terms of <b>men</b> <b>s</b> clothing behaviour. Indications are that <b>men</b> <b>s</b> advertising involvement is not particularly strong, which implies that they gain their product information and fashion information from alternative sources that rather relates to purchase involvement which tested high in most cases. This has implications for retail because <b>men</b> <b>s</b> stronger purchase involvement probably means that the physical retail environment is more important in terms of fashion information and to inspire <b>men</b> <b>s</b> clothing purchases. Therefore retailers should focus more on factors that make in-store decisions easier for males such as displays and placement of clothing. Male apparel is a potentially lucrative and growing market that can be even more profitable. Younger men spend more on their clothing therefore this group should therefore take preference but the older men should not be forgotten. Based on the findings of this study various recommendations are made with a large focus to either expand this study or build onto this existing research. Topics related to male clothing and involvement of clothing can definitely be built on and studied more in the apparel industry to fill a gap on knowledge that is lacking and should be explored further.

40|$|This thesis {{concerns}} Indian {{middle class}} <b>men</b> <b>s</b> fear {{of violence in}} public spaces. It attempts to broaden {{the perspective of the}} implications of fear of violence. Both the public and academic discourses on violence in public spaces in India are centered on the notion of the female victim. In this thesis I argue that we need to open up a strict binary understanding of only women as vulnerable and affected by the fear of crime in public spaces. I discuss the gendered implications of different types of violence, and how different identity categories that cut across gender, have an impact on middle class <b>men</b> <b>s</b> fear. In addition to this I assess how the fear for others safety and the masculine ideal of being a protector has an impact on <b>men</b> <b>s</b> personal fear of violence. Because there is no research on <b>men</b> <b>s</b> fear of crime in an Indian context I have supported my analyses with three theoretical frameworks, all relevant in different ways. This is the research on masculinity in India, the research on men and fear from the West, and the research on middle class women and fear of crime in India. My own research consists of data collected through a survey where 98 men and women participated, and interviews with men who are involved in initiatives for safer cities. To understand how fear of violence in public spaces is affecting lives in India, it is necessary to not restrict ourselves to only women s narratives. This thesis is an attempt at putting <b>men</b> <b>s</b> fear of violence on the agenda, and hopefully it contributes to a widening of the understanding of fear of violence in public spaces...|$|R
