Coupled with this, there has also been an increase in empirical research into whether such <b>pop-up</b> <b>messages</b> are effective, particularly in laboratory settings. However, very few studies have been conducted on the utility of <b>pop-up</b> <b>messages</b> in real-world gambling settings. The present study investigated the effects of normative and self-appraisal feedback in a slot machine <b>pop-up</b> <b>message</b> compared to a simple (non-enhanced) <b>pop-up</b> <b>message.</b> The study was conducted in a real-world gambling environment by comparing the behavioral tracking data of two representative random samples of 800, 000 gambling sessions (i. e., 1. 6 million sessions in total) across two conditions (i. e., simple <b>pop-up</b> <b>message</b> versus an enhanced <b>pop-up</b> <b>message).</b> The results indicated that the additional normative and self-appraisal content doubled the number of gamblers who stopped playing after they received the enhanced <b>pop-up</b> <b>message</b> (1. 39 %) compared to the simple <b>pop-up</b> <b>message</b> (0. 67 %). The data suggest that <b>pop-up</b> <b>messages</b> influence {{only a small number of}} gamblers to cease long playing sessions and that enhanced messages are slightly more effective in helping gamblers to stop playing in-session...|$|R

40|$|Harm-minimization {{strategies}} aim {{to reduce}} gambling-related risks; however, minimal evidence supports {{the effectiveness of}} current strategies involving the placement of warning signs in gambling venues and on electronic gaming machines (EGMs). This qualitative replication study evaluated the differential effect of <b>pop-up</b> <b>messages</b> compared to static signs {{and the content of}} messages on EGMs on recall, thoughts, and behaviors assessed during the session and at 2 -week follow-up. In Study 1, 127 regular EGM gamblers (male = 97, mean age = 20. 3) recruited from a university student population attended a laboratory where they were randomly assigned to play a computer-based simulated EGM analogue displaying signs that differed by (a) mode of presentation (pop-up and static) and (b) message content (informative, self-appraisal, and control/blank). In Study 2, an identical methodology was used but included the use of a simulated EGM within an in vivo gaming setting with 124 regular EGM players (male = 81, mean age = 44. 1). Results from both studies showed that <b>pop-up</b> <b>messages</b> were recalled more effectively than static messages immediately and at 2 -week follow-up. <b>Pop-up</b> <b>messages</b> reportedly had a significantly greater impact on within-session thoughts and behaviors. Messages encouraging self-appraisal resulted in significantly greater effect on self-reported thoughts and behaviors during both the experimental session and in subsequent EGM play.

EGMs are the main source of harmful gambling in New Zealand and all EGMs in New Zealand now include a mandatory <b>pop-up</b> <b>message</b> feature. The present study reports on 48 hours of in-situ observations of EGM gamblers in casino and non-casino (pub) venues in New Zealand and sought to establish whether relatively detailed observations of EGM features and gambler behaviour in venues were possible. <b>Pop-up</b> <b>messages</b> were the EGM feature focused on given their harm-minimisation potential, and the relative ease with which they can be observed. However, other EGM features were also documented along with descriptive accounts of associated gambler behaviour. The results establish that relatively detailed (quantitative or qualitative) observational data can be collected in venues using smart phones. The data showed <b>pop-up</b> <b>messages</b> were generally attended to but had little observable effect on gambler behaviour in venues.

In the time limit pop-up condition, participants were asked (via <b>pop-up</b> <b>message)</b> to consider setting a time limit on play and entering that limit in an available text box prior to commencing play. In the no time limit pop-up condition, participants engaged in play immediately upon accessing the EGM in the VR casino (i. e. they were not exposed to a time limit <b>pop-up</b> <b>message).</b> As predicted, participants who were explicitly asked to consider setting a time limit on their EGM play were signiﬁcantly more likely to do so and spent less time gambling than those who were not given such instructions.

40|$|Given the {{evidence}} for the motivating influence of EGM jackpots on intensifying player behaviour (Rockloff and Hing, 2013), {{there is good reason}} to explore consumer-protection features. Jackpot Expiry is a potential feature of a mandatory pre-commitment system or player identification system (e. g., loyalty program) whereby the availability of jackpots expires after a fixed interval of play. One hundred and thirty volunteers (males = 56, females = 74) played a laptop-simulated EGM with a starting $ 20 real-money stake. In the test condition, players were shown a “relevant” message stating that the promised jackpot had expired and could no longer be won by the participant (after the 20 th trial). In the irrelevant message condition a similar <b>pop-up</b> <b>message</b> simply said to push the button to continue. Lastly, a control condition had no <b>pop-up</b> <b>message</b> about the jackpot expiring. The results showed that betting speeds (one indicator of gambling intensity) were significantly slowed by the relevant ‘expiry’ message. Most importantly, all wagers past the 20 th trial were programmed as losses. Player receiving the ‘expiry’ message for a cash jackpot quit with significantly more money remaining on the machine. Therefore, jackpot expiry was effective in limiting player losses, while there was no evidence that jackpot expiry reduced self-rated player enjoyment of the simulated EGM experience...|$|R

40|$|Interactive {{technology}} has helped online gambling {{to become a}} more popular leisure time activity over the last decade. Alongside this development, new forms of Responsible Gaming tools such as voluntary limit setting and personalized feedback have been introduced. These interventions require a gambling environment with identified play such as online gambling and card-based land-based gambling. This thesis investigates the effects of personalized Responsible Gaming tools on subsequent gambling behaviour and also introduces a novel measure of monetary gambling involvement (i. e., 'theoretical loss'). Following reviews of the relevant literature and methodologies used, Studies 1 and 2 in Chapters 4 and 5 introduce the concept of theoretical loss, a monetary measure of gambling intensity. Study 1 utilised a simulation experiment {{and concluded that the}} theoretical loss is advantageous over bet-size with regard to measuring monetary involvement. Study 2 validated the results of Study 1 based on real-world gambling data from a large sample of 100, 000 online players. Study 3 is also based on a sample of players from a real-world gambling environment and concluded that the setting of voluntary time and money limits lead to positive changes in gambling behaviour. It was also shown that the effect of time and money limits depended upon the types of games played. For instance, slot players benefited from money limits whereas poker players spent less money playing if they set time limits. Studies 4 and 5 investigated the effects of a <b>pop-up</b> <b>message</b> that appeared after 1, 000 consecutive slot games. Both studies showed that only a minority of playing sessions lasted longer than 1, 000 consecutive games. Study 4 compared the number of sessions that lasted 1, 000 games before the pop-up was introduced with the number of sessions that lasted 1, 000 games after the pop-up was introduced. Results demonstrated that the pop-up prompted a small minority of players to cease their playing session. Study 5 investigated a modified <b>pop-up</b> <b>message</b> that was formulated in a motivational way and contained normative information. Almost twice as many players ceased to play {{as a consequence of the}} enhanced <b>pop-up</b> <b>message</b> compared to the previous simple <b>pop-up</b> <b>message.</b> This led to the conclusion that the way a message is formulated is a crucial aspect of behavioural change. The hypothesis that self-appraisal messages and normative feedback have an effect on behavioural change was supported. In Study 6, players of an online gambling website who had voluntarily signed up to a behavioural feedback system (i. e., mentor) where subject to analysis. These players received elaborate visual and numerical information concerning the past six months of their gambling behaviour. The player front-end – which displayed various types of information (losses, types of games played, playing duration, etc.) – was in line with Human-Computer-Interaction (HCI) principles. Results indicated that the personalized feedback system achieved the anticipated effect and that the time and money spent gambling was significantly reduced compared to that of the control group. The main results were also validated by additional analysis showing that the individual players reacted similarly with respect to time and money spent when provided with personalized feedback. The studies in this thesis demonstrate for the first time that voluntary limit setting, interactive <b>pop-up</b> <b>messages,</b> and personalized feedback can affect player behaviour positively in a real-world environment. The studies also demonstrate differences among subpopulations of players. It is almost impossible to uncover such insights in laboratory settings or with self-recollected information because a longer history of playing behaviour is necessary in order to extract player profiles. However, this thesis did not consider cognitive information as it was purely based on behavioural tracking data. Also, the data mostly came from one operator and players were not randomly assigned to experimental conditions. Consequently, future research should try to overcome these limitations and combine cognitive and behavioural data...|$|R

Thirty participants took part in a repeated-measures experiment where they gambled on the outcome of a computer-simulated gambling task. Outcome was manipulated by the experimenter to induce winning and losing streaks. Participants gambled at a significantly faster speed and a higher average stake size, which resulted in a greater betting intensity in the Loss condition compared to the Win condition. Computer generated self-appraisal messaging was then applied during the gambling session, which was able to significantly reduce the average speed of betting in the Loss condition only, demonstrating an interaction effect between computer generated messaging and gambling outcome...|$|R
