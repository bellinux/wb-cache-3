5000|$|The {{coefficient}} of thermal expansion (CTE) of <b>mould</b> and <b>glass</b> should match. High CTE difference means high deviation between the <b>moulded</b> <b>glass</b> and the <b>mould.</b> High CTE <b>glasses</b> are also critical {{in terms of}} non-uniform temperature distribution in the glass. This means that especially fast cooling can not be applied. In addition to this, the temperature difference between the warm lens directly after moulding and the surrounding air can easily cause cracks.|$|R

40|$|Precision <b>glass</b> <b>moulding</b> is {{increasingly}} used as replication technology for high precision Optical parts. The variety of geometries {{that can be}} moulded, as aspherical lenses, lens arrays and freeform lenses, {{as well as the}} reproducible quality of the moulded product have driven the field of application besides mass production towards smaller lot sizes with highest requirements. In the past, research efforts concentrated on modelling and experimental analysis of viscoelastic glass behaviour and optical properties of <b>moulded</b> <b>glass</b> parts [1]. The influence of process parameters on the geometrical accuracy of the component has not been studied so far and is especially important to improve the accuracy of advanced modelling tools. This work assesses main influence factors determined in preliminary studies, to evaluate their influence on the shrinkage of precision <b>moulded</b> <b>glass</b> parts...|$|R

50|$|Sidney Waugh (January 17, 1904 - June 30, 1963) was an American {{sculptor}} {{known for}} his monuments, medals, etched and <b>moulded</b> <b>glass,</b> and architectural sculpture.

50|$|These {{cars had}} many similar {{features}} to the later-built cars, including the one-piece <b>moulded</b> <b>glass</b> reinforced plastic end in royal blue & grey livery (earning them the Blue Goose nickname), semi-automatic doors, electronically controlled brakes and double-glazed windows. They {{had a different}} style of headlight and interior lighting to subsequent builds.|$|R

50|$|Ground <b>glass</b> <b>joints</b> {{are used}} in {{laboratories}} to quickly and easily fit leak-tight apparatus together from commonly available parts. For example, a round bottom flask, Liebig condenser, and oil bubbler with ground <b>glass</b> <b>joints</b> may be rapidly fitted together to reflux a reaction mixture. This is a large improvement compared with older methods of custom-made glassware, which was time-consuming and expensive, {{or the use of}} less chemical resistant and heat resistant corks or rubber bungs and <b>glass</b> tubes as <b>joints,</b> which took time to prepare as well.|$|R
5000|$|Glass {{connectors}} or adapters are {{hollow glassware}} components with ground <b>glass</b> <b>joints</b> open at {{one or both}} ends.|$|R

50|$|In the past, {{scientists}} constructed {{their own}} laboratory apparatus {{prior to the}} ubiquity of interchangeable ground <b>glass</b> <b>joints.</b> Today, commercially available parts connected by ground <b>glass</b> <b>joints</b> are preferred; where specialized glassware are required, they are made to measure using commercially available glass tubes by specialist glassblowers. For example, a Schlenk line is made of two large glass tubes, connected by stopcocks and smaller glass tubes, which are further connected to plastic hoses.|$|R

50|$|Some {{containers}} have a loose lid for a closure. Laboratory glassware {{often has}} ground <b>glass</b> <b>joints</b> {{that allow the}} pieces to be fitted together easily.|$|R
50|$|To {{connect the}} hollow inner {{spaces of the}} {{glassware}} components, ground <b>glass</b> <b>joints</b> are hollow {{on the inside and}} open at the ends, except for stoppers.|$|R
50|$|Two general {{types of}} ground <b>glass</b> <b>joints</b> are fairly {{commonly}} used: joints which are slightly conically tapered and {{ball and socket}} joints (sometimes called spherical joints).|$|R
50|$|Crude {{versions}} of conically tapered ground <b>glass</b> <b>joints</b> {{have been made}} for quite a while, particularly for stoppers for glass bottles and retorts. These days, ground <b>glass</b> <b>joints</b> can be precisely ground to a reproducible taper or shape. They are made to join two glassware pieces together. One of the glassware items to be joined would have an inner (or male) joint with the ground glass surface facing outward and the other would have an outer (or female) joint of a correspondingly fitting taper with the ground glass surface facing inward.|$|R

50|$|In April 2015 the Fraunhofer {{group in}} {{collaboration}} with the high performance polymer division of Sumitomo Bakelite Co announced their development of a single cylinder research engine with a casing made of injection <b>moulded</b> <b>glass</b> fibre reinforced phenolic resin (55/45 respective composition). The engine weighs about 20% less than an equivalent of aluminium. Their design uses metal inserts in places of high thermal and mechanical stress, for example in the cylinder liner.|$|R
50|$|The mast is {{a sealed}} section with a halyard running inside the track {{to help prevent}} {{inversion}} on capsize. The mast has single spreaders and lower shrouds to allow adjustment for different helms and conditions. The forestay is adjustable to allow depowering {{in conjunction with a}} cascade style kicker. A pivoting centreboard and rudder are made of <b>moulded</b> <b>glass</b> fibre construction. The laminate sails are available in two cuts to suit different sailors.|$|R
50|$|Dropping funnels {{are usually}} {{fitted with a}} ground <b>glass</b> <b>joint</b> which allows the funnel to fit snugly onto, e.g. a round bottom flask. This also means it need not be clamped separately.|$|R
