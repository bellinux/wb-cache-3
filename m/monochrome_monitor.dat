2500|$|In 1982, Commodore {{released}} the Commodore MAX Machine in Japan. It {{was called the}} Ultimax in the United States, and VC-10 in Germany. The MAX {{was intended to be}} a game console with limited computing capability, and was based on a very cut-down version of the hardware family later used in the C64. The MAX was discontinued months after its introduction because of poor sales in Japan. 1983 saw Commodore attempt to compete with the AppleII's hold on the US education market with the Educator 64, essentially a C64 and [...] "greenscale" [...] <b>monochrome</b> <b>monitor</b> in a PET case. Schools preferred the all-in-one metal construction of the PET over the standard C64's separate components, which could be easily damaged, vandalized or stolen. Schools did not prefer the Educator 64 to the wide range of software and hardware options the AppleIIe was able to offer, and it was produced in limited quantities.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Monochrome</b> <b>monitor</b> support - CodeView {{supported}} debugging {{on either}} a single color (CGA, EGA or VGA) monitor with page/memory swapping between the user application and the CodeView screen, {{or through a}} feature which utilized a separate <b>monochrome</b> <b>monitor.</b> The <b>monochrome</b> <b>monitor</b> existed in memory address space 0xb0000, while the color monitor existed at 0xb8000 for text and 0xa0000 for graphics. Use of the <b>monochrome</b> <b>monitor</b> with its separate memory address space allowed debugging graphics applications without affecting the display, {{as well as all}} text modes. <b>Monochrome</b> <b>monitor</b> support was limited to 25 lines, whereas color monitors could utilize 25, 43 or 50 line mode, allowing {{for more information on the}} screen at the same time.|$|E
50|$|The ST {{was sold}} with either Atari's color or <b>monochrome</b> <b>monitor.</b> The system's color {{graphics}} modes were only {{available on the}} color monitor, while the highest resolution mode needed the <b>monochrome</b> <b>monitor.</b>|$|E
5000|$|In {{the very}} {{beginning}} (throughout the 1970s), Apple did not manufacture or sell displays of any kind, instead recommending users plug-into their television sets or (then) expensive third party <b>monochrome</b> <b>monitors.</b> However, in order to offer complete systems through its dealers, Apple began to offer various third party manufactured 9" [...] <b>monochrome</b> <b>monitors,</b> re-badged as the Monitor II.|$|R
50|$|Tandy {{also offered}} <b>monochrome</b> <b>monitors</b> that support MDA and Hercules {{standard}} that also work with Tandy 1000.|$|R

50|$|Well-known {{examples}} of early <b>monochrome</b> <b>monitors</b> are the VT100 from Digital Equipment Corporation, released in 1978, and the IBM 5151, which accompanied the IBM PC model 5150 upon its 1981 release.|$|R
50|$|Like the cosmetically similar Rainbow 100 and DECmate II (also {{introduced}} at that time),the PRO series used the LK201 keyboard and 400kB single-sided quad-density floppy disk drives (known as RX50), {{and offered a}} choice of color or <b>monochrome</b> <b>monitors.</b>|$|R

5000|$|Although it cited {{flaws in}} the {{hardware}} and software, BYTE called the Hercules Graphics Card [...] "a fine product" [...] that gave owners of <b>monochrome</b> <b>monitors</b> graphics capability.

50|$|All terrain tiles, some {{landscape}} features, all monsters and objects, {{and some}} spell/effect graphics {{take the form}} of Windows 3.1 icons. Multi-tile graphics, such as ball spells and town buildings, are bitmaps included in the executable file. No graphics use colors other than the Windows-standard 16-color palette, plus transparency. They exist in monochrome versions as well, meaning that the game will display well on <b>monochrome</b> <b>monitors.</b>|$|R
5000|$|In {{the most}} {{commonly}} documented scheme, the ID3 pin was unused and only the 3 remaining pins were defined. The ID0 was pulled to GND by color <b>monitors,</b> while the <b>monochrome</b> <b>monitors</b> pulled ID1 to GND. Finally, the ID2 pulled to GND signaled a monitor capable of 1024×768 resolution, such as IBM 8514. In this scheme, the input states of the ID pins would encode the monitor type as follows: ...|$|R
5000|$|<b>Monochrome</b> <b>monitors</b> are {{particularly}} susceptible to screen burn (hence the advent, and name, of the screensaver), because the phosphors used {{are very high}} intensity. Another effect of the high-intensity phosphors is an effect known as [...] "ghosting", wherein a dim afterglow of the screen's contents is briefly visible after the screen has been blanked. This has a certain place in pop culture, as evidenced in movies such as The Matrix.|$|R
5000|$|A <b>monochrome</b> <b>monitor</b> {{is a type}} of CRT {{computer}} monitor which was very common {{in the early days of}} computing, from the 1960s through the 1980s, before color monitors became popular. They are still widely used in applications such as computerized cash register systems, owing to the age of many registers. Green screen was the common name for a <b>monochrome</b> <b>monitor</b> using a green [...] "P1" [...] phosphor screen.|$|E
5000|$|The IBM 5151 was a 12" [...] transistor-transistor logic (TTL) <b>monochrome</b> <b>monitor,</b> shipped {{with the}} {{original}} IBM Personal Computer.|$|E

50|$|Due to a {{continuous}} single-color phosphor, a digital connection with separate video and sync, and a signal format making no compromises for compatibility with lower resolution (e.g. composite NTSC) displays, <b>monochrome</b> <b>monitors</b> were sharper than CGA color. The MDPA {{also included a}} Centronics compatible parallel port for printers, which the CGA did not. Furthermore, a similar printer port was not originally available from IBM on any other card for the IBM PC.|$|R
5000|$|Unlike color monitors, which {{display text}} and {{graphics}} in multiple colors {{through the use}} of alternating-intensity red, green, and blue phosphors, <b>monochrome</b> <b>monitors</b> have only one color of phosphor (mono means [...] "one", and chrome means [...] "color"). All text and graphics are displayed in that color. Some monitors have the ability to vary the brightness of individual pixels, thereby creating the illusion of depth and color, exactly like a black-and-white television.|$|R
50|$|Software cubes were {{in use in}} the 1980s when <b>monochrome</b> <b>monitors</b> were {{in common}} use. The lack of colour meant a {{different}} way of face identification was required. A program that retained 1980s monochrome capability (using numerals 1 to 6 to identify facelets) for cubes in the size 2 to 11 range was produced in 1991 (together with colour capability in the size 2 to 15 range). More recently developed software cubes use coloured facelets as for hardware cubes.|$|R

5000|$|<b>Monochrome</b> <b>monitors</b> are {{commonly}} available in three colors: if the P1 phosphor is used, {{the screen is}} green monochrome. If the P3 phosphor is used, the screen is amber monochrome. If the P4 phosphor is used, the screen is white monochrome (known as [...] "paper white"); {{this is the same}} phosphor as used in early television sets.An amber screen was claimed to give improved ergonomics, specifically by reducing eye strain; this claim appears to have little scientific basis.|$|R
50|$|The OPD was {{supplied}} {{with either a}} 9-inch <b>monochrome</b> (white) <b>monitor</b> or a 14-inch colour monitor. Both monitors also housed the power supply for the OPD itself.|$|R
40|$|It {{was part}} of a range of {{high-performance}} monitors (computers screens) that were associated with other units such as Philip's video surveillance systems, cameras or transmission and control equipment. Included in this range of Philips monitors are LTC 2009 (like this one), LTC 2012, LTC 2017 and LTC 2020 Series <b>monochrome</b> <b>monitors.</b> They offer high-performance images with a resolution of 900 TVL (TV-Lines), {{or in the case of}} the LTC 2017 monitor, 700 TVL, making them ideal for remote viewing and video applications. The monitor housing consists of a robust rectangular metal case which minimizes interference from external signals and allows “stacking” of monitors when used in large numbers...|$|R
