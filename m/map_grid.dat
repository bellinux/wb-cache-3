2500|$|The {{search for}} the fourth bomb {{was carried out by}} means of a novel {{mathematical}} method, Bayesian search theory, led by Dr. Craven. This method assigns probabilities to individual <b>map</b> <b>grid</b> squares, then updates these as the search progresses. Initial probability input is required for the grid squares, and these probabilities made use of the fact that a local fisherman, Francisco Simó Orts, popularly known since then as [...] ("Bomb Paco" [...] or [...] "Bomb Frankie"), witnessed the bomb entering the water at a certain location. Orts was hired by the U.S. Air Force to assist in the search operation.|$|E

40|$|In 1973, the New Zealand Government {{instituted a}} metric {{measurement}} {{system and the}} New Zealand Department of Lands and Survey (NZLS) implemented a new <b>mapping</b> <b>grid</b> and projection system that permits the accurate representation of the whole country on a uniform basis. These two related decisions required the mapping division of the NZLS to assume responsibility for the conversion of both topographical and cadastral maps in the former imperial <b>mapping</b> <b>grid</b> system to the new metric <b>mapping</b> <b>grid</b> system. This thesis deals with the design of an automated mapping system and identifies the techniques necessary to automate the conversion of cadastral maps from the imperial mapping system to the new metric system. The research undertaken encompasses the following three major areas: (a) the design of an efficient system to automate the conversion from one mapping series to another, (b) the identification and testing of techniques necessary to generate computer produced maps to cartographic standards, (c) to design a data structure for graphical data and its corresponding descriptive data in a format suitable for use by a land information processing system. Although this research deals with a specific problem, the problems discussed in this thesis are of relevance to any general mapping application...|$|R

40|$|Operations in the Arctic seas are {{becoming}} more common as the area contains large amounts of oil and gas. For these operations, control and detection of ice are necessary to avoid interference with the production. The focus of this project was to use the recursive grid-based estimation method, Occupancy <b>Grid</b> <b>Mapping,</b> to locate icebergs using an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV). The Occupancy <b>Grid</b> <b>Mapping</b> is not usually used for iceberg localization from the air. The goal of this project was, therefore, to show how Occupancy <b>Grid</b> <b>Mapping</b> {{can be used for}} iceberg localization with a UAV. The Occupancy <b>Grid</b> <b>Mapping</b> was also implemented and simulated with a path planner to show how Occupancy <b>Grid</b> <b>Mapping</b> can be used with other algorithms. The path planner algorithm and framework used in this project was created by the PhD student Anders Albert. The UAV was simulated to fly over a given area, and the measurements from the UAV was used by the Occupancy <b>Grid</b> <b>Mapping</b> to calculate the probability of occupancy. Grid-based maps of the area were created based on the probability of occupancy calculated by the Occupancy <b>Grid</b> <b>Mapping.</b> These maps showed where icebergs were located and which parts of the area were empty. The accuracy of the Occupancy <b>Grid</b> <b>Mapping</b> estimation was best when the UAV measurement frequency was high. When the Occupancy <b>Grid</b> <b>Mapping</b> was simulated with the path planner, a proposed procedure was used to calculate the optimization variable of the path planner. The optimization variable was based on the probability of occupancy calculated from Occupancy <b>Grid</b> <b>Mapping</b> and time since the observation took place. The simulation results showed that the Occupancy <b>Grid</b> <b>Mapping</b> can be used by a path planner to find the optimal path between the icebergs. This project showed that grid-based maps produced by Occupancy <b>Grid</b> <b>Mapping</b> can be used for iceberg localization. In further work, some adjustments of Occupancy <b>Grid</b> <b>Mapping</b> are proposed for further experimentations...|$|R

They were poor quality, rushed into production for wartime needs, and had been produced by merely photographically reducing six-inch maps.|$|R
