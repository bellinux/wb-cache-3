The German pool list contained almost every song Jackson released in his solo career. Notably expansions on the pool choice included: A larger option of tracks from Thriller 25 and the inclusion of 12 tracks from The Ultimate Collection. There were also 8 tracks included from the singers time in The Jackson 5/Jacksons; slightly <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> versions. The German edition was also released in Switzerland on the same day.|$|E
5|$|Some mammals are omnivores {{and display}} {{varying degrees of}} carnivory and herbivory, {{generally}} leaning in favor of one <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>other.</b> Since plants and meat are digested differently, there is a preference for one over the other, as in bears where some species may be mostly carnivorous and others mostly herbivorous. They are grouped into three categories: mesocarnivory (50-70% meat), hypercarnivory (70% and greater of meat), and hypocarnivory (50% or less of meat). The dentition of hypocarnivores consists of dull, triangular carnassial teeth meant for grinding food. Hypercarnivores, however, have conical teeth and sharp carnassials meant for slashing, {{and in some cases}} strong jaws for bone-crushing, {{as in the case of}} hyenas, allowing them to consume bones; some extinct groups, notably the Machairodontinae, had saber-shaped canines.|$|E

5|$|Superman: Ultimate Flight is a steel flying {{roller coaster}} {{designed}} by Bolliger & Mabillard. Themed {{to the popular}} comic book character, Superman: Ultimate Flight has been installed at three Six Flags theme parks around the United States: Six Flags Over Georgia, Six Flags Great Adventure and Six Flags Great America. The first of these was at Six Flags Over Georgia, which interacts with the terrain much <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> two. Superman: Ultimate Flight simulates flying by positioning its passengers parallel to the track, supported by harnesses and facing the ground {{through most of the}} ride. In the station, riders board the train sitting down. After the train is locked and checked, the trains are raised into the flying position. After the ride, the seats are lowered back into the sitting position for the next round of riders.|$|E
5|$|Much <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> Big Five studios, RKO {{relied on}} B {{pictures}} {{to fill up}} its schedule. Of the thirty-one features released by RKO in 1944, for instance, ten were budgeted below $200,000, twelve were in the $200,000 to $500,000 range, and only nine cost more. In contrast, a clear majority of the features {{put out by the}} other top four studios were budgeted at over a half a million dollars. A focus on B pictures limited the studio's financial risk; while it also limited the potential for reward (Dmytryk's extraordinary coups aside), RKO had a history of making better profits with its run-of-the-mill and low-cost product than with its A movies. The studio's low-budget films offered training opportunities for new directors, as well, among them Jacques Tourneur, Mark Robson, Robert Wise, and Anthony Mann. Robson and Wise received their first directing assignments with producer Val Lewton, whose specialized B horror unit also included the more experienced director Jacques Tourneur. The Lewton unit's moody, atmospheric work—represented by films such as Cat People (1942), I Walked with a Zombie (1943), and The Body Snatcher (1945)—is now highly regarded. Richard Dix concluded his lengthy RKO career with the 1943 Lewton production The Ghost Ship. Tim Holt was RKO's cowboy star of the era, appearing in forty-six B Westerns and more than fifty movies altogether for the studio. In 1940, Chester Lauck and Norris Goff brought their famous comic characters Lum and Abner from radio to RKO for a six-film run. The Falcon detective series began in 1941; the Saint and the Falcon were so similar that Saint creator Leslie Charteris sued RKO. The Falcon was first played by George Sanders, who had appeared five times as the Saint. He bowed out after four Falcon films and was replaced by his brother, Tom Conway. Conway had a nine-film run in the part before the series ended in 1946. Johnny Weissmuller starred in six Tarzan pictures for RKO between 1943 and 1948 before being replaced by Lex Barker.|$|E

25|$|A major {{criticism}} of the Premier League in the mid-2000s was the emergence of gulf between the Premier League and the First Division. Criticism of the gap between clubs has continued, nevertheless, due to some clubs' increasing ability to spend <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> Premier League clubs. For some clubs, including Shamkir, Karvan, Absheron, MKT-Araz who have failed to win immediate promotion {{back to the top}} flight, financial problems, including in some cases administration or even liquidation have followed.|$|E

They formed a coalition with Werner Faymann from the Social Democrats as Chancellor. The Green Party came in third with 11% of the vote. The FPÖ and the deceased Jörg Haider's new party Alliance for the Future of Austria, {{both on the}} political right, were strengthened during the election but taken together received less than 20% of the vote.|$|E
25|$|In First-class cricket (two innings match), {{the team}} that scores more runs, having {{dismissed}} its opponents twice, is the winner. An example would be: Team A scored 240 in their first innings, and Team B made 225 in reply. Team A then made 300 for 7 in their second innings, declaring it closed (they might do this because {{there was not much}} time left in the match and wanted to have time to dismiss team B and win rather than draw the game). Team A would be setting team B a target of 316 to win. If, in the second innings, team B only scored 250 (indeed anything less than 315) then team A would be the winner. If, on the other hand, team B scored 316–9, team B would be the winner. If time or the weather prevents the opposing side's being dismissed twice, the game is a draw, even if one side has scored <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>other.</b> There is no equivalent of Duckworth-Lewis Method in these matches.|$|E

25|$|In circularly {{polarized}} light {{the direction of}} the electric field rotates at the frequency of the light, either clockwise or counter-clockwise. In a material, this electric field causes a force on the charged particles comprising the material (because of their low mass, the electrons are most heavily affected). The motion thus effected will be circular, and circularly moving charges will create their own (magnetic) field in addition to the external magnetic field. There will thus be two different cases: the created field will be parallel to the external field for one (circular) polarization, and in the opposing direction for the other polarization direction – thus the net B field is enhanced in one direction and diminished in the opposite direction. This changes the dynamics of the interaction for each beam and one of the beams will be slowed down <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>other,</b> causing a phase difference between the left- and right-polarized beam. When the two beams are added after this phase shift, the result is again a linearly polarized beam, but with a rotation in the polarization direction.|$|E
25|$|Tristan (2011) by Hogan was a {{follow up}} film to Yajilarra and was {{commissioned}} by Oscar and the Lililwan Project, The George and the University of Sydney Discipline of Paediatrics and Child Health. The documentary {{was part of the}} campaign to support children affected by FASD. When Tristan was released, the Australian government had yet to recognise FASD as a disability. Tristan highlighted the danger in drinking alcohol in pregnancy by portraying the struggle of a 12-year old Aboriginal boy who suffered from severe FASD. The boy lived in Fitzroy Crossing, loved Australian rules football and was much like other boys his age. Hogan’s film told how Tristan struggled <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> children in his family who were less affected by FASD, needed to have regular breaks when focusing on a task, and often needed to have instructions repeated to him. His uncle was worried the police and other authorities could easily misunderstand his inability to communicate, or comprehend the consequences of his actions. But Tristan wanted to become a policeman one day and just wanted to be ‘normal’. Tristan was shown at the 11th session of the United Nations Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues in New York, from 7 to 18 May 2012. The film concluded with a message from Oscar: “The attitude of society towards FASD must change, since the children with the condition can’t”.|$|E

40|$|This paper investigates {{theoretically}} and empirically the endogenous {{investment decision}} of firms conditioning on export decision. It shows that theoretically, whatever {{the form of}} preferences, firms that start exporting invest more and grow <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>others.</b> However, it is shown that when preferences are CES, within each category of firms (domestic and switchers), initial productivity and investment are strategic complements, inducing intra-industrial divergence. On the contrary, when preferences are quadratic, initial productivity and investment are strategic substitutes: less productive firms invest more and grow <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>others,</b> inducing intra-industrial convergence. Empirical results on French data support the predictions of the quadratic preferences model. Export Decision, Investment, Firm Heterogeneity...|$|R
