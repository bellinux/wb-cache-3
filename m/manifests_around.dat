40|$|Hailey-Hailey {{disease is}} a rare chronic skin {{disorder}} that is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. The disease is characterized by development of vesicles and bullae typically in the intertriginous areas. On histology, there is widespread intraepidermal acantholysis causing the “dilapidated brick-wall” appearance. Mutations in the ATP 2 C 1 gene, encoding for P-type Ca 2 + transport ATPase, is {{the primary cause of}} the disease. The disease <b>manifests</b> <b>around</b> puberty and runs a chronic course with remissions and exacerbations. Ultraviolet light exposure, sweating, friction, stress, and cutaneous infections are the known precipitants of the disease. We report a case of a woman with recurrent flare-ups of Hailey-Hailey disease with repeated pregnancies and remission of her disease during non-pregnancy periods. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of Hailey-Hailey disease exacerbated by pregnancy...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Kernel density {{estimation}} (KDE) {{has been}} used in many computational intelligence and computer vision applications. In this paper we propose a Bayesian estimation method for finding the bandwidth in KDE applications. A Gamma density function is fitted to distributions of variances of K-nearest neighbours data populations while uniform distribution priors are assumed for K. A maximum log-likelihood approach is used to estimate the parameters of the Gamma distribution when fitted to the local data variance. The proposed methodology is applied in three different KDE approaches: kernel sum, mean shift and quantum clustering. The third method relies on the Schrödinger partial differential equation and uses the analogy between the potential function that <b>manifests</b> <b>around</b> particles, as defined in quantum physics, and the probability density function corresponding to data. The proposed algorithm is applied to artificial data and to segment terrain images...|$|E

How such diversity <b>manifests</b> <b>around</b> the question of how Biomedicine influences Chinese medicine practitioner’s practice is investigated here. Q methodology, a unique combination of quantitative and qualitative methods (that challenges such divisions) is chosen for its ‘focus on eliciting and describing a wide diversity of different subjective experiences, perspectives, and beliefs, none of which are defined a priori by the researcher’ (Kitzinger 1999). Through capturing the richness and complexity of various points of view it can identify points of conflict and consensus that can offer directions for future action or research. However whilst looking at subjective opinions it is not interested in who said what, but rather what is being said about the topic. For subjectivity is seen to be forged in the social milieu. And in acknowledging that Chinese medicine today is not of course contained within Chinese borders international perspectives are sought. The commonly accepted view that the two systems lead to greater clarity of the whole is challenged on epistemological grounds...|$|E

40|$|Intra-subject {{variation}} in reaction time (ISVRT) is a developmentally-important phenomenon that decreases from childhood through young adulthood {{in parallel with}} the development of executive functions and networks. Prior work has shown a significant association between trial-by-trial variations in reaction time (RT) and trial-by-trial variations in brain activity as measured by the blood-oxygenated level-dependent (BOLD) response in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies. It remains unclear, however, whether such “RT-BOLD” relationships vary with age. Here, we determined whether such trial-by-trial relationships vary with age in a cross-sectional design. We observed an association between age and RT-BOLD relationships in 11 clusters located in visual/occipital regions, frontal and parietal association cortex, precentral/postcentral gyrus, and thalamus. Some of these relationships were negative, reflecting increased BOLD associated with decreased RT, <b>manifesting</b> <b>around</b> the time of stimulus presentation and positive several seconds later. Critically for present purposes, all RT-BOLD relationships increased with age. Thus, RT-BOLD relationships may reflect robust, measurable changes in the brain-behavior relationship across development...|$|R

40|$|Observations {{indicate}} that most massive {{stars in the}} Galaxy appear in groups, called OB associations, where their strong wind activity generates large structures known as superbubbles, inside which the subsequent supernovae (SNe) explode, in tight space and time correlation. Acknowledging this fact, we investigate four main questions: 1) does the clustering of massive stars and SN explosions influence the particle acceleration process usually associated with SNe, and induce collective effects which would not <b>manifest</b> <b>around</b> isolated supernova remnants?; 2) does {{it make a difference}} for the general phenomenology of Galactic Cosmic Rays (GCRs), notably for their energy spectrum and composition?; 3) can this help alleviate some of the problems encountered within the standard GCR source model?; and 4) Is the link between superbubbles and energetic particles supported by observational data, and can it be further tested and constrained? We argue for a positive answer to all these questions. Theoretical, phenomenological and observational aspects are treated in separate papers. Here, we discuss the interaction of massive stellar winds and SN shocks inside superbubbles and indicate how this leads to specific acceleration effects.

Drawing from data gathered between 2014 and 2016 in Jaipur and Kolkata, India, the history, social life, and challenges faced by the slide-guitar community are illuminated with attention to how the instrument has flourished in a climate of modern Hindu nationalism and globalization. Using a theoretical framework that includes ideas about hybridity, nationalism, vernacularization, and cultural capital, the many forms of the slide-guitar in India are analyzed {{in the context of}} the cultural reforms of India’s late British colonial period through the early twenty-first century. The slide-guitar is analyzed in light of the codification of musical systems and cultural norms in India, with special emphasis on gender issues in the performing arts and in nativist symbolism. This study emphasizes the relationship between musicians and instrument makers in the evolution of an instrument that has migrated conceptually and structurally from a foreign to a traditional instrument within Indian music cultures.

40|$|A {{dialogic}} modelfor {{the discussion}} ofissues related to Christian privilege and religious oppression ofminority religious groups and non-believers in the UnitedStates is presented Thegoal ofthe dialogue circles {{is to create}} and maintaina true multicultural community on the university campus. One of our responsibilities {{as members of a}} teacher education faculty is to teach the required multicultural course. Within the discussions in our classrooms we have witnessed various levels of resistance to the concept of "privilege". Part of that resistance is <b>manifested</b> <b>around</b> issues related to Christian privilege. Religious scholar Diana Eck (2001) summarizes the multicultural "dilemma " created by Christian privilege: The new American dilemma is real religious pluralism, and it poses challenges to America's Christian churches that are as difficult and divisive as those of race. Today, the invocation of a Christian America takes on a new set of tensions as our population of Muslim, Hindu, Sikh, and Buddhist neighbors grows. The ideal of a Christian America stands in contradiction to the spirit, if not the letter, of America's foundational principle of religious freedom (p. 46). Based on Peggy McIntosh's (1988) pioneering investigations of White and male privilege, we can, by analogy, understand Christian privilege as constituting a seemingly invisible, unearned, and largely unacknowledged array of benefits afforded to Christians. This system of benefits confers dominance on Christians while subordinating members of other faiths as well as non believers. These systemic inequities are pervasive throughout society.

[...] "Let's take the literal meaning of this song and watch it evolve in front of us ... almost as a memory in your head. And create this world, somewhere you walk in on this desolate desert and you start to sing about all these great memories you have... of everything you love blooming around you, and so we literally grew this garden around her", White said. [...] The world moved from one situation to the next. White decided to annex surreal elements to create a cross between a garden and the heart of the memories. He intertwined Swift's emotions with the growth of the garden. The garden grew when Swift felt happy, but at the sight of pain and negative emotions, clouds appear and the garden dies, which also symbolized Anderson's broken heart.|$|R

This is relevant for furthering the clinical knowledge of men-tal health professionals working with Deaf, deaf, and hard-of-hearing children and adolescents. Tourette’s Disorder Tourette’s Disorder (TD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder that usually first presents in childhood and is influenced by neurological, psychological, and socio-logical factors. TD is a chronic (duration> 1 year) neu-ropsychiatric condition involving tics with childhood onset. It often presents with obsessive-compulsive symptoms, yet these symptoms do not always meet the full criteria for obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD); similarly, it often presents with disturbances of attention that do not always meet the full criteria for attention-deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD; Jankovic, 2001). TD is commonly comorbid with learn-ing difficulties (Leckman, 2002). Recent studies have suggested a familial aggregation and hereditary rela-tionship among the three conditions and the combina-tion of tics, OCD, and ADHD has been termed “the Tourette’s syndrome triad ” (Kurlan, 2010). The disorder is typically first <b>manifested</b> <b>around</b> the age of 5 or 6 years, with peak intensity of tics around 10 – 12 years of age and some lessening in tics by the age of 15 – 17 years (Jetmalani, 2011).
