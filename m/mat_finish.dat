50|$|The trophy {{was made}} of a {{combination}} of silver, gold, copper and brass with a silver <b>finish</b> with <b>mat</b> and gloss <b>finish.</b> It stands to communicate the strength, purity, humility and persistence that not only represents the four metals but also the four participating nations.|$|R
50|$|The 35th {{edition of}} the {{marathon}} in 2011 had its first photo-finish: eventual winner Christopher Kipyego mistook the electronic timing <b>mat</b> for the <b>finish</b> point and prematurely stopped, leading to an impromptu sprint finish against Teklu Deneke. Just two tenths of a second ended up separating the pair.|$|R
5000|$|In an RFF Radio podcast {{interview}} with Wally Bransen, {{he said that}} the Linz's beat them to the <b>finish</b> <b>mat</b> by one or two minutes in the final leg, making it the third closest finish ever. The Weavers finished in third place an [...] "hour or two" [...] later.|$|R
50|$|After {{defeating}} {{three of}} his first four opponents via grand superiority, Nazaryan successfully advanced to the finals at the 2000 Olympics in Sydney, where he faced the larger, taller and reigning World Wrestling Champion, Kim In-Sub. In-Sub scored a stand-up takedown (0-3) in less than thirty seconds into the match. Nazaryan quickly got on top of In-Sub and both men were ordered to get up by the referee. A period of inactivity followed, with both wrestlers struggling to overcome {{the other in the}} clinch. The referee soon ordered for them to go on the mat, with Nazaryan in the top position. After much effort, Nazaryan successfully lifted In-Sub up overhead and scored a full takedown (5-3). Nazaryan then scored another takedown by lifting up In-Sub and turning him over (6-3) and then scored an exposure (9-3) by pinning In-Sub to the <b>mat</b> and <b>finishing</b> him via fall. Nazaryan had now become a two-time Olympic gold medalist.|$|R
50|$|He {{claimed his}} first {{national}} title {{on the track}} at the 40th Ethiopian Athletics Championships, defeating Dino Sefer in the 10,000 metres. He ran at the Marseille-Cassis Classique Internationale and was leading mid-race but stopped short after mistaking a timing <b>mat</b> for the <b>finish</b> line. Upon realising his error, he began running again but the stoppage had allowed Atsede Tsegay {{to take the lead}} and he ended up in second place. At the 2012 RAK Half Marathon he started the race slowly but increased his pace in the second half to finish as runner-up to Denis Kipruto Koech.|$|R
50|$|The layers {{are created}} by {{shredding}} the wood into strips, which are sifted and then oriented on a belt or wire cauls. The mat is made in a forming line. Wood strips on the external layers are aligned to the panel's strength axis, while internal layers are perpendicular. The number of layers placed is determined partly by {{the thickness of the}} panel but is limited by the equipment installed at the manufacturing site. Individual layers can also vary in thickness to give different finished panel thicknesses (typically, a 15 cm layer will produce a 15 mm panel thickness). The mat is placed in a thermal press to compress the flakes and bond them by heat activation and curing of the resin that has been coated on the flakes. Individual panels are then cut from the <b>mats</b> into <b>finished</b> sizes. Most of the world's OSB is made in the United States and Canada in large production facilities. The largest production facilities can make over 1000000 sq ft of OSB per day.|$|R
50|$|This season had two {{different}} penalties {{for coming in}} last on a non-elimination leg. While Edwin & Monica were marked for elimination for coming in last on the first leg, Henry & Terri were stripped of all their money and will begin the next leg with no money after coming in last on the seventh leg. Racers were not told that the original non-elimination penalty was still applicable. This twist led to an argument between Henry and host Allan Wu at the Seoul <b>finish</b> <b>mat,</b> when the former was unwilling {{to give up his}} team's money. In the following leg, the penalty reverted to the 'marked for elimination' penalty after Terri & Henry finished last consecutively.|$|R
60|$|Mat {{appeared}} to receive this speech of Zack's as a well-merited compliment, for he chuckled at young Thorpe and winked grimly at Valentine, {{as he sat}} down bare-armed to his own mess of liver and bacon. It was certainly a rare and even a startling sight to see this singular man eat. Lump by lump, without one intervening morsel of bread, he tossed the meat into his mouth rather than put it there--turned it apparently once round between his teeth--and then voraciously and instantly swallowed it whole. By the time a quarter of Mr. Blyth's plateful of liver and bacon, and half of Zack's had disappeared, <b>Mat</b> had <b>finished</b> his frugal meal; had wiped his mouth {{on the back of}} his hand, and the back of his hand on the leg of his trousers; had mixed two glasses of strong hot rum-and-water for himself and Zack; and had set to work on the composition of a third tumbler, into which sugar, brandy, lemon-juice, rum, and hot water all seemed to drop together in such incessant and confusing little driblets, that it was impossible to tell which ingredient was uppermost in the whole mixture. When the tumbler was full, he set it down on the table, with an indicative bang, close to Valentine's plate.|$|R
50|$|The Response round was {{introduced}} by new producer Geoff Moore for the 1986 and 1987 series. In 1987, the Response round in the initial heats {{was a combination of}} a race between the contestants using double-odometer bicycles, and a video wall which would display random numbers of coloured blocks; the contestants were required to press one of four coloured buttons corresponding to the highest number of blocks of any one colour being displayed. This alternated with a test in which the contestants had to walk a balance beam to the first challenge - placing coloured wooden blocks into frames either side of them, swinging from side to side in doing so (this was known as the Fleischmann Flexibility Tests). They then had to run across a balance beam linked to the Minnesota Manual Dexterity Test, where they had to take a shape and place it into a corresponding space. After a final balance beam, they jump onto their respective <b>mat</b> to <b>finish</b> the race. The 1986 series consisted of the contestants competing in twos to perform first the Minnesota Manual Dexterity test (moving differently coloured cylinders {{from one side to the}} other), then running over to perform the Fleischmann Flexibility Test and then the final test, which involved hitting the relevant button whenever a colour flashed up on the screen (only one colour at a time in this case).|$|R
50|$|Hodgson at {{the time}} vowed never to return to MotoGP, stating that a {{combination}} of his age and nationality was now against him, and he would never be offered the best machinery capable of competing let alone winning. Having shown loyalty to Ducati throughout his motorcycle racing experience, the question now was where to place him. Ducati had a 'works' team focusing on making Régis Laconi the next WSB champion, and Hodgson didn't want to return to the Superbike World Championship in a satellite team, or to British Superbikes. Resultantly, with the stated aim of becoming the first rider to win all three Superbike titles of 'British', 'World' and 'American', he moved to into the less-prestigious American Motorcyclist Association (AMA) championship in the United States for 2005 - he came sixth to <b>Mat</b> Mladin. Hodgson <b>finished</b> the 2006 AMA Superbike Championship in 5th place.|$|R
5000|$|Transponder {{timing is}} {{becoming}} more common. The RFID detection system times the transponder chip, usually located on a runner's shoe {{as opposed to the}} official timing of the torso. Accurate to a full second, this is not significant, but in breaking microscopic ties, the data does not correspond to timing rules. Most road races cannot fit all participants onto the start line. Depending {{on the size of the}} field, some athletes could be several city blocks away from the start line and in the large crowd, could take minutes to get across the line. Results frequently indicate two times, the [...] "gun time" [...] would be the official time from the firing of the starting gun, but the mat time shows the time the shoe crossed a sensing mat at the start line to the time the shoe crossed the sensing <b>mat</b> at the <b>finish</b> line.|$|R
40|$|International audienceIn {{this paper}} {{we present a}} simple and fast {{approach}} for MAT generation in discrete form. It is used for manufacturability analysis in part modelling stage of injected parts. The method is a volume thinning method based on straight skeleton computation, modified and applied in 3 D on B-rep models in STL. The volume thinning of B-rep model is based on its boundary surfaces offset towards model interior. The surfaces' offset is done with an adequately proposed offset distance which makes some of non adjacent offset model surfaces overlap (they “meet” in mid-surface or MAT). Offset surfaces are used to reconstruct the topology of a new B-rep model (offset model). Overlapping surfaces in offset model are detected, separated and aggregated to MAT. For adequate MAT precision and adequate MAT radius function, we propose to treat B-rep model concave edges (vertices) as cylinders (spheres) of zero-radius and offset them in adequate way. On these bases, we present an iterative algorithm in which MAT is being constructed in incremental way by consecutive volume thinning of obtained offset models. <b>MAT</b> construction is <b>finished</b> when an empty offset model is obtained. An algorithm has been created and implemented in Visual C++. Some of obtained results are presented in this paper...|$|R
50|$|In {{his next}} fight at UFC 73 on July 7, 2007, Silva {{successfully}} defended his title against Nate Marquardt, winning by TKO at 4:50 {{in the first}} round. Three months later, on October 20, 2007, at UFC 77, Silva fought a title defense rematch against Rich Franklin, in Franklin's hometown of Cincinnati, Ohio, at the U.S. Bank Arena. Silva defended his belt by defeating Franklin via TKO in the 2nd round. On March 1, 2008, at UFC 82 Silva fought Pride Middleweight champion Dan Henderson, in a title unification bout (UFC and Pride titles on the line). Henderson was believed to have the edge on the ground, having competed in the 1992 and 1996 Summer Olympics in Greco-Roman wrestling. Silva defended his title by defeating Henderson via rear naked choke in the 2nd round. At UFC Fight Night: Silva vs. Irvin on July 19, 2008, Silva made his debut at Light Heavyweight (205 lb) in a bout against James Irvin. Silva won via KO due to strikes in 1:01 {{of the first round}} after catching Irvin's attempted leg kick with his left arm and delivering a straight right that dropped Irvin to the <b>mat,</b> Silva then <b>finished</b> a prone Irvin with a blitz of punches to the head. Irvin later tested positive for methadone and oxymorphone.|$|R
40|$|Felt is {{considered}} mankind 2 ̆ 7 s oldest textile. Created of wool or hair through pressure and shocking, {{and the application}} of heat and cold, felt is a warm, sturdy fabric used for shelter, clothing, carpets, saddles, and bags or container covers. Feltmaking is a world-wide tradition {{in the sense that it}} is practiced in such disparate regions as Mongolia, Central Europe, Central Asia, the Middle East and North Africa. In the souk in Marrakech, Morocco, a two-sided prayer rug is created, one side white and one side grey, using the natural color of the fleece. The process involves the addition of soap which acts as a binding agent during the felting process. Rolling and pressure cause the fibers to bind together forming a flat, <b>finished</b> <b>mat.</b> In Central Asia and the Middle East, the biblical bow and mallet is employed to break up the fiber into a cloud-like mass which is laid on a dampened canvas in a given shape. The feltmakers in this area create inlaid coats and carpets for local consumption. Once a coat has been partially felted, it is folded over, and the softly rolled fleece is applied to the surface in a given design. The laminating process continues in order to felt in the yarn design and to shape the coat. The finished garment has closed sleeves which act like mittens. In Afghanistan, where the carpet designs are very intricate, the dyed fleece is laid in a given pattern on a reed mat and the plain black fleece backing is then laid on top. The entire mass of wool is rolled up in the mat and a canvas and felted through continuous rolling and pressure. In Aqsha, an Afgan town very near the Russian border, a carpet market takes place every week, featuring pile carpets and 2 ̆ 2 namdas 2 ̆ 2 or felt carpets. This is my carpet which took me 7 hours to buy. During the price haggling which is, as you know, a ritual in this part of the world, this is the crowd which gathered on my carpet and this is the gentleman who made off with my SS 2 ̆ 6 D - an issue devoted to American Indian rug design. I wonder how many Hopi and Pueblo 2 ̆ 2 namdas 2 ̆ 2 are being created in Aqsha today?!...|$|R
