25|$|Finally, a {{possible}} fate of negative muons bound to conventional atoms {{is that they}} are captured by the weak-force by protons in nuclei in a sort of electron-capture-like process. When this happens, the proton becomes a neutron and a <b>muon</b> <b>neutrino</b> is emitted.|$|E
25|$|The fermions of the Standard Model are {{classified}} {{according to how}} they interact (or equivalently, by what charges they carry). There are six quarks (up, down, charm, strange, top, bottom), and six leptons (electron, electron neutrino, muon, <b>muon</b> <b>neutrino,</b> tau, tau neutrino). Pairs from each classification are grouped {{together to form a}} generation, with corresponding particles exhibiting similar physical behavior (see table).|$|E
25|$|Standard Model neutrinos are {{fundamental}} point-like particles. An effective size {{can be defined}} using their electroweak cross section (apparent size in electroweak interaction). The average electroweak characteristic size is r2 = n × 10−33cm2 (n × 1nanobarn), where n = 3.2 for electron neutrino, n = 1.7 for <b>muon</b> <b>neutrino</b> and n = 1.0 for tau neutrino; it depends on no other properties than mass. However, this is best understood as being relevant only to probability of scattering. Since the neutrino does not interact electromagnetically, and is defined quantum mechanically by a wavefunction, {{it does not have}} a size in the same sense as everyday objects. Furthermore, processes that produce neutrinos impart such high energies to them that they travel at almost the speed of light. Nevertheless, neutrinos are fermions, and thus obey the Pauli exclusion principle, i.e. that increasing their density forces them into progressively higher momentum states.|$|E

500|$|In a 1959 paper Pontecorvo listed 21 {{interactions}} {{that could not}} occur unless the electron neutrino (...) and the <b>muon</b> <b>neutrino</b> (...) were one and the same. This paper introduced this notation for neutrinos, which we use today, and listed the reasons why he felt that having two types of neutrinos was [...] "attractive {{from the point of}} view of symmetry and the classification of particles". The prediction that neutrinos associated with electrons are different from those associated with muons was confirmed in 1962. In 1988 Jack Steinberger, Leon M.

500|$|There are {{elementary}} {{particles that}} spontaneously decay into less massive particles. An {{example is the}} muon, with a mean lifetime of seconds, which decays into an electron, a <b>muon</b> <b>neutrino</b> and an electron antineutrino.

500|$|After his {{defection}} to the Soviet Union in 1950, {{he worked}} at the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research (JINR) in Dubna. He had proposed using chlorine to detect neutrinos. In a 1959 paper, he argued that the electron neutrino (...) and the <b>muon</b> <b>neutrino</b> (...) were different particles. Solar neutrinos were detected by the Homestake Experiment, but only between one third and one half of the predicted number. In response to this solar neutrino problem, he proposed a phenomenon known as neutrino oscillation, whereby electron neutrinos became muon neutrinos. The existence of the oscillations was finally established by the Super-Kamiokande experiment in 1998. He also predicted in 1958 that supernovae would produce intense bursts of neutrinos, which was confirmed in 1987 when Supernova SN1987A was detected by neutrino detectors.|$|E

These observations only concerned <b>muon</b> <b>neutrinos.</b> No tau neutrinos were observed at Super-Kamiokande. The result made it, however, more plausible that the deficit in the electron-flavor neutrinos observed in the (relatively low-energy) Homestake experiment has also to do with neutrino mass.|$|R

2500|$|To be precise: in the Standard Model with {{neutrino}} mass, a decay like [...] → [...] + [...] {{is technically}} possible, for example by neutrino oscillation of a virtual <b>muon</b> <b>neutrino</b> into an electron neutrino, {{but such a}} decay is astronomically unlikely and therefore should be experimentally unobservable: less than one in 1050 muon decays should produce such a decay.|$|E
2500|$|There are six {{types of}} leptons, known as flavours, forming three {{generation}}s.

[...] Electrons have the least mass of all the charged leptons. The heavier muons and taus will rapidly change into electrons and neutrinos through a process of particle decay: the transformation from a higher mass state to a lower mass state. Thus electrons are stable and the most common charged lepton in the universe, whereas muons and taus can only be produced in high energy collisions (such as those involving cosmic rays and those carried out in particle accelerators).|$|E
2500|$|Nearly 40 {{years after}} the {{discovery}} of the electron, the muon was discovered by Carl D. Anderson in 1936. [...] Due to its mass, it was initially categorized as a meson rather than a lepton. [...] It later became clear that the muon was much more similar to the electron than to mesons, as muons do not undergo the strong interaction, and thus the muon was reclassified: electrons, muons, and the (electron) neutrino were grouped into a new group of particles—the leptons. In 1962, Leon M. Lederman, Melvin Schwartz, and Jack Steinberger showed that more than one type of neutrino exists by first detecting interactions of the <b>muon</b> <b>neutrino,</b> which earned them the 1988 Nobel Prize, although by then the different flavours of neutrino had already been theorized.|$|E

2500|$|There {{are three}} known types (flavors) of neutrinos: {{electron}} neutrino , <b>muon</b> <b>neutrino</b> [...] and tau neutrino , named after their partner leptons in the Standard Model (see table at right). The current best {{measurement of the}} number of neutrino types comes from observing the decay of the Z boson. This particle can decay into any light neutrino and its antineutrino, and the more types of light neutrinos available, the shorter the lifetime of the Z boson. Measurements of the Z lifetime have shown that the number of light neutrino flavors that couple to the Z is 3. The correspondence between the six quarks in the Standard Model and the six leptons, among them the three neutrinos, suggests to physicists' intuition that there should be exactly three types of neutrino. However, actual proof that there are only three kinds of neutrinos remains an elusive goal of particle physics.|$|E
