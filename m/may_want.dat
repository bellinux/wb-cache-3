Sillitoe also offered his deputy, retired MI5 officer John Collard, as liaison for Fleming to interview. During World War II, Collard had assisted in the planning of Operation Overlord as part of MI11 and had joined MI5 under Sillitoe at the war's end. Whilst in MI5 he {{played a major role in}} the capture and conviction of the atomic spy Klaus Fuchs, before Sillitoe had approached him in 1954 to work for the International Diamond Security Organisation.|$|E
5|$|Complaints of {{low back}} pain {{are one of the}} most common reasons people visit doctors. For pain that has lasted only a few weeks, the pain is likely to subside on its own. Thus, if a person's medical history and {{physical}} examination do not suggest a specific disease as the cause, medical societies advise against imaging tests such as X-rays, CT scans, and MRIs. Individuals <b>may</b> <b>want</b> such tests but, unless red flags are present, they are unnecessary health care. Routine imaging increases costs, is associated with higher rates of surgery with no overall benefit, and the radiation used may be harmful to one's health. Fewer than 1% of imaging tests identify the cause of the problem. Imaging may also detect harmless abnormalities, encouraging people to request further unnecessary testing or to worry. Even so, MRI scans of the lumbar region increased by more than 300% among United States Medicare beneficiaries from 1994 to 2006.|$|E
25|$|Examples include when {{a patient}} does not want a {{treatment}} because of, for example, religious or cultural views. In the case of euthanasia, the patient, or relatives of a patient, <b>may</b> <b>want</b> to end {{the life of the}} patient. Also, the patient <b>may</b> <b>want</b> an unnecessary treatment, as can be the case in hypochondria or with cosmetic surgery; here, the practitioner may be required to balance the desires of the patient for medically unnecessary potential risks against the patient's informed autonomy in the issue. A doctor <b>may</b> <b>want</b> to prefer autonomy because refusal to please the patient's self-determination would harm the doctor-patient relationship.|$|E

25|$|The patient <b>may</b> <b>want</b> to {{consider}} some basic preparation before the surgery. The most basic preparation {{is that people}} who have body hair on the chest <b>may</b> <b>want</b> to remove the hair by clipping just prior to surgery or using a depilatory agent (preoperative shaving has been on the decline as it can cause skin breakage and increase infection risk of any surgical procedure) as the surgery will involve bandages and monitoring equipment to be affixed to the body.|$|E
25|$|An artist {{may prefer}} a medium that stays fluid for some time, <b>may</b> <b>want</b> one that dries hard, or <b>may</b> <b>want</b> a medium that remains {{somewhat}} sticky. If the medium dries hard the artist can build up layers of color, which will fuse {{together in a}} single firing. This can create unusual intensity or depth of color. If the medium remains sticky the artist can add to the design by dusting more color onto the surface, or can dust on an overglaze powder to create a high gloss surface.|$|E

50|$|Infrequent voiding {{refers to}} a child's voluntarily holding of urine for {{prolonged}} intervals. For example, a child <b>may</b> not <b>want</b> to use toilets at school or <b>may</b> not <b>want</b> to interrupt enjoyable activities, so he or she ignores the body's signal of a full bladder. In these cases, the bladder can overfill and leak urine. Additionally, these children often develop urinary tract infections (UTIs), leading to an irritable or overactive bladder.|$|R
25|$|The {{separation}} axioms {{are about}} the use of topological means to distinguish disjoint sets and distinct points. It's not enough for elements of a topological space to be distinct (that is, unequal); we <b>may</b> <b>want</b> them to be topologically distinguishable. Similarly, it's not enough for subsets of a topological space to be disjoint; we <b>may</b> <b>want</b> them to be separated (in any of various ways). The separation axioms all say, in one way or another, that points or sets that are distinguishable or separated in some weak sense must also be distinguishable or separated in some stronger sense.|$|E

25|$|The type {{of shell}} also affects {{the sound of}} a drum. Because the {{vibrations}} resonate in the shell of the drum, the shell can be used to increase the volume and to manipulate the type of sound produced. The larger the diameter of the shell, the lower the pitch. The larger the depth of the drum, the louder the volume. Shell thickness also determines the volume of drums. Thicker shells produce louder drums. Mahogany raises the frequency of low pitches and keeps higher frequencies at about the same speed. When choosing a set of shells, a jazz drummer <b>may</b> <b>want</b> smaller maple shells, while a rock drummer <b>may</b> <b>want</b> larger birch shells.
