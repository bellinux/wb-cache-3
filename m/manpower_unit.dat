50|$|On {{the eve of}} World War II, the RAAF {{comprised}} twelve flying squadrons, two aircraft depots and {{a flying}} school, situated at five air bases. An air force of this size did not require large-scale operational formations such as wings, groups, or commands, as all units could be directly administered and controlled by RAAF Headquarters in Melbourne. With the onset of war in September 1939, the Australian Air Board decided to implement a decentralised form of command and control, commensurate with an envisioned increase in <b>manpower</b> and <b>units.</b> The RAAF's initial move in this direction was to create Nos. 1 and 2 Groups in November 1939, the former based in Melbourne to control units in Victoria, and the latter in Sydney to control units in New South Wales.|$|R
