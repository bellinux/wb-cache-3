40|$|Distinct {{forms of}} ribosome-inactivating {{proteins}} were purified from wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) germ and leaves and termed tritin-S and tritin-L, respectively. These differ {{in size and}} charge and are antigenically unrelated. They are both RNA N-glycosidases which act on 26 S rRNA in native yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) ribosomes by the removal of A 3024 located in a universally conserved sequence in domain VII which has previously been identified {{as the site of}} action of ricin A-chain. Tritin-S and tritin-L differ in both their ribosome substrate specificities and cofactor requirements. Tritin-S shows only barely detectable activity on ribosomes from the endosperm, its tissue of synthesis, whereas tritin-L is highly active on leaf ribosomes. Additionally, tritin-S is inactive on wheat germ, tobacco leaf and Escherichia coli ribosomes but active on rabbit reticulocyte and yeast ribosomes.

An in-tank toilet cleaner, intended to compete with 2000 Flushes and Clorox automatic, was introduced under the Vanish brand in 2000. Initial problems with in-tank cleansers damaging toilet flappers, allowing water to leak into the bowl, were addressed by adding new durability and <b>marking</b> <b>requirements</b> for flappers to the ASME A112.19.5 standard in 2005.|$|E

40|$|Electronic devices radiate {{electromagnetic}} signals when operating. Because {{electronic equipment}} {{is sensitive to}} electromagnetic fields, their normal operation can be disrupted by emissions from other devices. For reasons of functionality and safety, international standards have been established to ensure compliance of equipment {{under a variety of}} situations. In 1980 the U. S. Federal Communication Commission imposed regulations on commercial digital products and in 1992 the European Union imposed the CE <b>mark</b> <b>requirement.</b> Amongst others, two very useful books on the subject are [1] and [2]. To be prudent, it is best to design the PCB layout with electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) in mind rather than to be faced with excessive emissions at the prototype stage or – worse still – just prior to production. Unfortunately, too many of the problems are uncovered at the testing stage. Shielding and absorbing materials are then often used to reduce the emissions. A preferred approach is to identify the problems at the board level and to rectify them there. Even then, if particular offending frequencies are identified, engineers are still faced with the nightmare of locating which net segments are the cause of these particular emissions The use of computer simulation prior to prototyping is one methodology {{that can be used to}} hel...|$|R

To illustrate, a customs broker may need to advise an importer on the <b>marking</b> <b>requirements</b> of the country of origin, or complete paperwork for a clothing shipment subject to quotas and visa requirements.

50|$|In October 1993, toilet fixture {{manufacturers}} reported rapid {{degradation of}} flush valve flappers; some new, water-saving toilets (introduced {{to meet a}} 1994 US federal water conservation deadline) were leaking within months of installation. The growing popularity of in-tank drop-in cleaning tablets quickly drew suspicion as many contain chlorine bleach; if a toilet is flushed infrequently, the amount of chlorine in the tank may build to problematic levels. The Metropolitan Water District of Southern California (MWD) began tests of flapper materials in 1994-1997. By 1998, flappers had been redesigned to withstand continuous immersion in 2000 Flushes or Clorox bowl cleaners, then the most popular products. A rival in-tank cleaner introduced by Vanish in 2000 caused problems until new durability and <b>marking</b> <b>requirements</b> for flappers {{were added to the}} ASME A112.19.5 standard in 2005.|$|E
