40|$|BACKGROUND: Respiratory {{conditions}} such as asthma, bronchitis, hypersensitivity pneumonitis and upper airways symptoms have been ascribed to fungal exposures. <b>Mushroom</b> <b>workers</b> {{may be at risk}} of these as a consequence. AIMS: To assess the prevalence of respiratory symptoms in <b>mushroom</b> <b>workers.</b> METHODS: A cross-sectional study assessed 4 weeks of respiratory symptoms among <b>mushroom</b> <b>workers</b> divided into four categories of exposure, using a self-administered respiratory questionnaire and spirometry. RESULTS: The population of 191 subjects was predominantly (66 %) from Eastern Europe; 61 % were women and 39 % were under 30. It included 73 growers, 38 composters, 26 administrators and 52 packers. Among all workers, there was a high prevalence (67 %) of one or more respiratory symptoms which did not appear to vary by age, gender, pack-years of smoking or duration of employment. There was a significant improvement in respiratory symptoms in workers during absence from the workplace (P < 0. 001). Spirometry readings across all groups were within normal values. Symptom profiles suggest that as many as 22 workers had symptoms of airways disease; 18 (82 %) of these were mushroom growers. Growers {{were significantly more likely to}} have symptoms consistent with airways disease than all other workers, odds ratio 9. 2 (95 % CI 3. 0 - 28. 4).

40|$|Purpose of review: To {{discuss the}} {{relationship}} between androgens, cognition and Alzheimer 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>disease.</b> Recent findings: It {{has been found that}} low circulating levels of androgens are a risk factor for Alzheimer 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>disease.</b> Decreased circulating androgens are also associated with declining cognitive performance, particularly in memory-related tasks. Conversely, androgen supplementation to hypogonadal men results in improved memory performance.

40|$|The {{pathological}} {{hallmark of}} Parkinson 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>disease</b> is the degeneration of dopaminergic nigrostriatal neurons, leading to depletion of striatal dopamine. Recent neuroanatomical work has identified pathways for communication across striatal subdivisions, {{suggesting that the}} striatum provides a platform for integration of information across parallel corticostriatal circuits. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate whether dopaminergic dysfunction in Parkinson 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>disease</b> was associated with impairments in functional connectivity across striatal subdivisions, which could potentially reflect reduced integration across corticostriatal circuits. Utilizing resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we analyzed functional connectivity in 39 patients with Parkinson 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>disease,</b> both “on” and “off” their regular dopaminergic medications, along with 40 age-matched healthy controls. Our results demonstrate widespread impairments in connectivity across subdivisions of the striatum in patients with Parkinson 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>disease</b> in the “off” state. The administration of dopaminergic medication significantly improved connectivity across striatal subdivisions in Parkinson 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>disease,</b> implicating dopaminergic deficits in the pathogenesis of impaired striatal interconnectivity. In addition, impaired striatal interconnectivity in the Parkinson 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>disease</b> “off” state was associated with pathological decoupling of the striatum from the thalamic and sensorimotor (SM) networks. Specifically, we found that although the strength of striatal interconnectivity was positively correlated with both (i) the strength of internal thalamic connectivity, and (ii) the strength of internal SM connectivity, in both healthy controls and the Parkinson 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>disease</b> “on” state, these relationships were absent in Parkinson 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>disease</b> when in the “off” state.

Complement (C 5 a) is a potent neutrophils chemoattractant and is known to mediate many types of inflammatory responses. To elucidate the relationship between neutrophils and C 5 a in Behcet 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>disease,</b> the peripheral neutrophils of 31 patients with Behcet 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>disease</b> and of 16 sex-age-matched normal controls were studied. Expression of C 5 a receptor mRNA was detected in Behcet 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>disease</b> but not in the normal controls (p= 0. 045). Chemotaxis (p= 0. 011) and superoxide release (p= 0. 001) by Behcet 2 ̆ 7 s neutrophils was significantly higher than by normal neutrophils, and the intracellular calcium mobilization of Behcet 2 ̆ 7 s neutrophils was more active than that of normal neutrophils (p= 0. 004). Based on these results, we conclude that Beh cet 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>disease</b> is associated with priming of peripheral neutrophils in vivo, suggesting that C 5 a {{may play a role in}} the etiology and pathogenesis of Behcet 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>disease...</b>|$|R
40|$|Lexical-semantic and {{emotional}} processing deficits {{have been associated}} with Parkinson 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>disease.</b> This study investigated automatic and controlled lexical-semantic processing, the automatic activation of emotional evaluations, and the processing of words conveying negative and neutral emotional connotations in a combined affective and semantic priming paradigm. Eighteen participants with Parkinson 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>disease</b> who had undergone surgery for deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) completed a lexical decision task at short and long stimulus onset asynchronies (SOAs), during on and off stimulation conditions. Nineteen non-neurologically impaired participants acted as controls. The results indicated that automatic lexical-semantic {{and emotional}} evaluative processes are unimpaired in Parkinson 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>disease</b> as reflected in the presence of comparable semantic and affective priming effects at the short SOA in on and off stimulation conditions compared with healthy controls. In contrast, participants with Parkinson 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>disease</b> in the off stimulation condition showed a pattern of aberrant controlled lexical-semantic processing as evidenced by a lack of semantic priming effects at the long SOA condition. Controlled semantic priming was present, however, when the participants with Parkinson 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>disease</b> were receiving stimulation of the STN, suggesting that STN stimulation modulates basal ganglia-thalamocortical circuits involved in such processes. Finally, delayed reaction times for negatively valenced targets compared with neutrally valenced targets was evident in participants with Parkinson 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>disease</b> in the on stimulation condition and control participants, but not for participants with Parkinson 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>disease</b> in the off stimulation condition, suggesting that the incidental evaluation of negatively versus neutrally valenced words in Parkinson 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>disease</b> is modulated by basal ganglia-thalamocortical circuits...|$|R
40|$|Alzheimer 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>disease</b> is {{characterized}} by the presence of neurofibrillary tangles and senile plaques. Although much is known about the molecular events leading to the formation of plaques and tangles as well as their relevance in neuronal cell loss associated with Alzheimer 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>disease,</b> the link between these two pathologies is presently unknown. The exact mechanism of neuronal cell death in the Alzheimer 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>disease</b> brain has been a debated issue with both the necrosis and apoptosis pathways having been implicated. The activation of apoptosis in the Alzheimer 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>disease</b> brain has recently gained momentum, namely because of the development of specific markers for caspase activation. These markers consist of antibodies, termed caspase-cleavage site-directed antibodies that are designed to detect either the active enzymatic fragments of caspases following their activation or protein products targeted for caspase cleavage. The use of these markers has demonstrated the widespread activation of caspases in the Alzheimer 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>disease</b> brain. In addition, many of these markers have been co-localized with markers for neurofibrillary tangles, suggesting that caspases {{may play a role in}} the formation of neurofibrillary tangles and, thus, do not simply represent end-stage events associated with Alzheimer 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>disease.</b> In this review, recent studies documenting the role of caspases in the Alzheimer 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>disease</b> brain will be discussed, along with the methodology behind the synthesis of site-directed caspase-cleavage antibodies. A model will be presented whereby caspases serve not simply as end-game players, but may actually serve as a link between senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. In this context, a discussion of the therapeutic value of targeting caspase inhibition in the treatment of Alzheimer 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>disease</b> will be evaluated...|$|R
