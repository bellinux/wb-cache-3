40|$|Purpose - Autonomy is {{a primary}} motive for a large {{majority}} of small business starters. As an explanation of why people want their own (autonomous) business it is tautological. This study sets out to focus on an explanation of the autonomy motive itself: why small business starters want autonomy. Design/methodology/approach - Data were collected using semi-structured interviews with a sample of 167 nascent entrepreneurs. Findings - There are two types of autonomy motives: a proximal motive which is associated with task characteristics of being self-employed (decisional freedom), and distal motives for which autonomy is instrumental (to avoid a boss or restrictions; to act in a self-endorsed and self-congruent manner; and to be in charge). Research limitations/implications - Autonomy measures should either operationalise autonomy only in a proximal sense without regard to underlying <b>motive</b> <b>sources,</b> or take distal motives into account and offer items that reflect these autonomy <b>motive</b> <b>sources.</b> Practical implications - Persons who resist bosses and rules now must be a boss and set rules themselves. People who want to express their personality and creativity in their work might be so busy and occupied that there will be little space left for personality and creativity expression. People who want autonomy because of the power and control it brings them may find that as a small business owner {{they have to deal with}} several types of uncertainty. Practitioners must resolve these tensions. Originality/value - In spite of the intimate relationship between freedom and entrepreneurial motivation, this is perhaps the first paper to focus exclusively on autonomy as a start-up motive. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited...|$|R

In the practical part there were briefly introduced selected institutions kindergarten Nové Domovy and Česká spořitelna, a. s. and after that questionnaires completed by employees were evaluated. In conclusion the results were summarized in forms of tables and there were recommended possible suggestions on the improvement of current system of motivation and remuneration. Based on the survey {{it can be said that}} employees of both institutions are well motivated and overall satisfied in their job, although there are several things whose changes would make employees more satisfied. Namely all staff of both institutions is not satisfied with their salary. This is the reason, why the most of institutions nowadays should focused on non- monetary rewards, such as more responsibility, pleasant working conditions, etc. All companies realize that exact human sources are the most important capital and therefore companies would try to develop and permanently improve the system of motivation and remuneration.

Este aspecto é um dos fatores que mais influencia no seu preço final, levando em consideração toda a complexa cadeia de elementos que fazem com que o robô opere corretamente, desde os motores e componentes mecânicos, passando pela arquitetura e sistemas de controle até o sistema de programação. Tendo isto em vista, este trabalho visa projetar um robô {{industrial}} com preço mais acessível, adequado para o uso em processos industriais que não necessitem altos níveis de precisão. Para a redução de custos de fabricação e de componentes do robô, este trabalho viabiliza o uso de atuadores pneumáticos lineares como fonte motriz, pois os mesmos são relativamente baratos, leves, não poluentes, de fácil montagem e operação, além de apresentarem uma boa relação peso/potência. Para tanto, foi implementado uma estratégia de controle por modos deslizantes com objetivo de superar as dificuldades impostas pelo comportamento não-linear dos componentes pneumáticos. Com relação à redução de custos de programação e operação do robô, desenvolveu-se um ambiente de programação off-line, através de softwares de auxilio à manufatura e de engenharia usualmente encontrados em ambientes industriais. A estratégia fundamental neste trabalho, foi o desenvolvimento de uma metodologia de projeto própria, concebida especificamente para a aplicação em projetos de robôs industriais, com os atributos de facilidade de execução e modularidade das fases envolvidas. A qual, no presente trabalho, apresenta o desenvolvimento de um robô cartesiano com três graus de liberdade acionado por atuadores pneumáticos lineares. The {{great majority}} of industrial robots available in the market have high performance, especially relative to position accuracy. This aspect {{is one of the}} factors that most influence its final price, taking into account all complicated web elements that makes the robot operates in the correct form, since the actuators and the constructive part, passing by the architecture and control systems until the system of programming. According to these, the present work aims to project an industrial robot with more accessible costs, adequate to use in industrial process that not require high level of accuracy. For the reduction of manufacture and components costs of the robot, this work make viable to use of pneumatic actuators like a <b>motive</b> <b>source,</b> because are relatively cheap, light, not pollutants, easy assembly and operation, besides presenting a good relation weight/power. For such purpose, the strategy of control was implemented by sliding mode control for the objective to surpass the difficulties imposed by the non-linear behavior of the pneumatic components. About the reduction of programming and operation costs of the robot, an off-line programming environment was developed through manufacturing aided software and a software of engineering both usually found in industrial environments. The basic strategy in this work, was the development of an own methodology of project, conceived specifically for the application in projects of industrial robots, with the attributes of easiness of execution and modularization of the wrapped phases.

40|$|In this Introduction we {{comment on}} {{issues raised by}} the present {{collection}} of papers as they appear relevant in thinking about the settlement of the Indo-Pacific from the Pleistocene to the late Holocene. Successful maritime migration across this vast region was obviously related to voyaging technology and colonizing behaviors. Here we critique earlier models that indicate simple unidirectional expansion and posit farming, or indeed any other single driver, for maritime expansion in the mid-late Holocene. It now appears that the development of interaction spheres in Wallacea, and perhaps connections with New Guinea, have contributed significantly to late Holocene societies in ISEA and Island Melanesia. Even in Remote Oceania where long-term colonizing success was dependent on a transported tropical horticultural complex, initial settlement strategies are likely to have been highly varied and to have had variable success. Nor is migration restricted to the founding events of island settlement; rather, it continued as a significant component of the formation and re-formation of island cultures up to the historical era and, of course, within the present day. Like the authors represented here we suggest that if we wish to make progress in understanding the <b>motives,</b> <b>sources,</b> mechanisms and results of colonizing migration, there will be greatest reward in exploring the complexity and variability that lie behind it.

40|$|The 2004 Toyota Prius is {{a hybrid}} {{automobile}} {{equipped with a}} gasoline engine and a battery-powered electric motor. Both of these <b>motive</b> power <b>sources</b> are capable of providing mechanical drive power for the vehicle. The engine can deliver a peak power output of 57 kilowatts (kW) at 5000 revolutions per minute (rpm) while the motor can deliver a peak power output of 50 kW at 1300 rpm. Together, this engine-motor combination has a specified peak power output of 82 kW at a vehicle speed of 85 kilometers per hour (km/h). In operation, the 2004 Prius exhibits superior fuel economy compared to conventionally powered automobiles. Laboratory tests were conducted to evaluate the electrical and mechanical performance of the 2004 Toyota Prius and its hybrid electric drive system. As a hybrid vehicle, the 2004 Prius uses both a gasoline-powered internal combustion engine and a battery-powered electric motor as <b>motive</b> power <b>sources.</b> Innovative algorithms for combining these two power sources results in improved fuel efficiency and reduced emissions compared to traditional automobiles.

For firms acquiring small private firms and former subsidiaries—but not public targets—the evidence is consistent with three propositions: (1) A firm's commitment to internal R&D is negatively affected by the decision to acquire; (2) Low R&D productivity increases the likelihood of acquisition; (3) A large knowledge stock predisposes firms to acquire because they perceive they are capable of selecting and absorbing targets. We conclude that acquisitions of small private firms and former subsidiaries are a viable R&D strategy to explore a range of potential future innovation trajectories for large public firms...|$|R

Both boundary layer suction and trailing edge blowing developed from a single supplied <b>motive</b> pressure <b>source</b> are employed on the stator. Massflow removed through boundary layer suction {{is added to the}} motive massflow, and the resulting combined flow is used for trailing edge blowing to reduce the total pressure deficit generated by the stator wake. The effectiveness of the flow control design was investigated experimentally by measuring the reduction in the total pressure loss coefficient. The experiment was conducted in a linear transonic blowdown cascade wind tunnel. The inlet Mach number for all tests was 0. 79, with a Reynolds number based on stator chordlength of 2 ´ 106. A range of inlet cascade angles was tested to identify the useful range of the flow control design. The effect of different supply massflows represented {{as a percentage of the}} passage throughflow was also documented. Significant reductions in the total pressure loss coefficient were accomplished with flow control at low cascade angles.
