I mean, it was like a puddle of sweat around <b>my</b> <b>feet.</b> It was like, 'Oh my God, oh my God, I hope I did the right thing. Oh, that scene is too long. Oh, that's too short. Are they going to get this part? Are they going to like this? Oh, they're going to think it's boring!' Just {{worrying}} the whole way, biting my fingernails off.|$|E

The pain was more pronounced in the middle of the left hand, so much so that I can still feel it. Also under <b>my</b> <b>feet</b> I can feel some pain.|$|E

25|$|Carrfour Supportive Housing, {{a nonprofit}} {{organization}} established in 1993 by the Homeless Committee of the Greater Miami Chamber of Commerce – develops, operates and manages innovative housing communities for individuals and families in need through a unique approach combining affordable housing with comprehensive, on-site supportive services. As the leading not-for-profit provider of supportive housing in Florida, Carrfour has supplied homes for more than 10,000 formerly homeless men, women and children since its founding. In Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, in 2007, a non-profit organization named Back on <b>My</b> <b>Feet</b> was created by runner Anne Mahlum as a running club for homeless {{men and women in}} the area, to help overcome homelessness through a multi-step self-help program centered on running three days a week, plus sponsored running events. Participants, drawn from local homeless shelters partnered with the organization, are assigned to different teams within each chapter and monitored by a nonresident member, and are required to commit to punctuality, endurance, self-optimism, team spirit, and sobriety. The members earn incentives through continued participation and progress, culminating in educational scholarships and assistance in finding permanent housing and employment. Back on <b>My</b> <b>Feet</b> counted a total of 400 homeless runners in nine cities after five years, and by the beginning of 2013 counted 10 different city chapters in the United States, with four more chapters planned by the end of the year.|$|E
25|$|The 1990s saw {{the release}} of many {{compilation}} albums of Shaw's material on various minor labels, as well as reissues of some of her original albums. Shaw's autobiography, The World at <b>My</b> <b>Feet,</b> was published in 1991, and the following year she began studying at Oxford and the University of London and qualified as a psychotherapist in 1994. During that time, she recorded new versions of some of her 1960s songs for the album Nothing Less Than Brilliant, released in 1994. It was also around this time that Shaw divorced Powell and met her third husband, Tony Bedford. Concentrating on a new career as a psychotherapist, Shaw opened the Arts Clinic in 1997 with her husband, to provide psychological healthcare and creative development {{to those in the}} creative industries. The clinic is now styled Barefoot Therapy: The Arts Clinic and continues to provide psychological support for those in the fields of entertainment, media and sports. In 1998 she was invited to join the Royal Society of Musicians as an Honorary Professor of Music.|$|E
25|$|Just as I {{was pushing}} {{one of our}} men back into the ranks I saw him fall at <b>my</b> <b>feet</b> from a sabre slash. I turned round instantly– to see English cavalry forcing their way into our midst and hacking us to pieces. Just as it is difficult, if not impossible, for the best cavalry to break into {{infantry}} who are formed into squares and who defend themselves with coolness and daring, so {{it is true that}} once the ranks have been penetrated, then resistance is useless and nothing remains for the cavalry to do but to slaughter at almost no risk to themselves. This what happened, in vain our poor fellows stood up and stretched out their arms; they could not reach far enough to bayonet these cavalrymen mounted on powerful horses, and the few shots fired in chaotic melee were just as fatal to our own men as to the English. And so we found ourselves defenceless against a relentless enemy who, in the intoxication of battle, sabred even our drummers and fifers without mercy.|$|E

25|$|Arkan {{became an}} {{untouchable}} criminal figure in Belgrade {{and all of}} the former Yugoslavia. He was really so powerful, so strong financially that no one could do anything about him.... In 1993, I learned that Željko Ražnatović, Arkan, had in Belgrade kidnapped and taken to Erdut and there killed Isa Lero... also a man from the criminal underground who had come into conflict with Arkan. I even found a witness to the murder. I publicly accused Arkan. I submitted a report to the police. The police inspectors came to see me. We talked about it. I gave them all the information I had, but then the police inspector told me that they were aware of it but that they were unable to prove it because of the fear among the potential witnesses. So the police were quite well-informed about his criminal activities, but {{it was very hard to}} prove anything or to bring charges because his support network was so widespread, and this can be shown through various newspaper articles and so on. In one television statement, I told him when we were debating on TV, that he had pulled a sock over his head more often than I had pulled one on <b>my</b> <b>feet.</b>|$|E
25|$|Nevertheless, Farmer {{focused the}} efforts of the {{institution}} on Bahá'í themes. In her words in 1902:My joy in the Persian Revelation is not that it reveals one of the streams flowing to the great Ocean of Life, Light and Love, but that it is a perfect mirror of that Ocean. What, in Green Acre, was a vision and a hope becomes, through it a blessed reality now. It has illuminated for me every other expression of Truth which I had hitherto known and place <b>my</b> <b>feet</b> on a Rock from which they cannot be moved. And it is the Manifestation of the Fatherhood - Behá'u'lláh (ed - as it was spelled in those days) - who had taught me to look away from even the Greatest and find within the One 'Powerful, Mighty, and Supreme' who is to be the Redeemer of my life. It is a Revelation of Unity such as I had never before found. By means of its Light, as shown the life of the Master Abbas Abdul Beha, I have entered into a joy greater than any I have hitherto known. Green Acre was established as a means to that end and in proportion as well lay aside all spirit of criticism of others and seek only to live the Unity we find, shall we be able to help others to the same divine realization.|$|E

500|$|The song's {{music video}} was {{originally}} {{scheduled to be}} directed by Brett Ratner, who had shot Carey's previous two videos. However, Jake Nava {{was used as the}} director instead, as Ratner had other obligations regarding one of his films. It was filmed during the end of June 2005. When describing the video's concept to MTV News, Carey said [...] "I actually just got the treatment. We came up with some cool concepts." [...] When asked for a more detailed synopsis, Carey declined and responded [...] "It's [...] "really technical. It's a new approach that I would have to let [...] explain. It's new territory." [...] During a scene in the video in which Carey had to wear very high-heeled pumps, she had the video crew carry her to various sections of the set. When Nava suggested she wear a pair of sensible flat footwear in between shoots, Carey jokingly replied [...] "my feet repel them dahling." [...] When recalling the moment in a later interview, Carey claimed her feet were [...] "in agony" [...] and said [...] "My high heels had left <b>my</b> <b>feet</b> bleeding.

500|$|Lyrically, {{the song}} shows Rihanna sexually seducing her love interest, while {{revealing}} her [...] "nasty secrets". According to Julianne Shepherd of Spin, Rihanna [...] "coyly dares" [...] 'her lover to [...] "sex her up"'. In [...] "Roc Me Out", Rihanna uses her [...] "militaristic alternate persona" [...] and interprets the lyrics [...] "with a command and directness befitting" [...] of it. Rihanna complains to her lover throughout the lines [...] "You’re taking {{too long to}} get {{my head on the}} ground / And <b>my</b> <b>feet</b> in the clouds," [...] before cooing, [...] "I’ve been a bad girl, daddy". She gives him instructions while singing [...] "Get my head on the ground and <b>my</b> <b>feet</b> in the clouds". Priya Elan of NME commented that the song sounds like a [...] "‘Rude Boy’ re-tool from the vocal delivery to her 'Come on boy' line." [...] In the end, Rihanna reveals the [...] "dirtiest secret" [...] through the line [...] "I’ll let you in on a dirty secret, I just want to be loved". David Amidon of PopMatters described the line as the song's [...] "not exactly a dangerous sentiment".|$|E
500|$|The {{risks of}} her {{profession}} were illustrated when on October 1833 she barely avoided {{being killed by}} a landslide that buried her black-and-white terrier, Tray, her constant companion when she went collecting.
