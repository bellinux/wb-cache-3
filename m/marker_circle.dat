We assume that an image captured by an omnidirectional camera system is normalised to a spherical image, the image on the unit sphere. Using this geometrical property of the omnidirectional images, we introduce a method for marker-based positioningand navigation of autonomous mobile robots which mounts a monocular omnidirectional camera system. We first clarify the geometric properties of the spherical image of a <b>circle</b> <b>marker</b> placed on the ground plane, and we show that, {{for the detection of}} a plane from <b>circle</b> <b>markers,</b> we are required to capture at least two coplanar <b>circle</b> <b>markers.</b> We prove that the image of a circle on the spherical image is a fourth-order algebraic curve, which is the intersection of a sphere and an oblique elliptic cone. For the detection of marker images on the spherical images, we introduce a method for transforming the detection of this fourth-order algebraic curve to the detection of a spatial conic, which is quadric. Second, we develop a voting method for the extraction of images of planar <b>circle</b> <b>markers</b> on a spherical image, using the spatial-quadric detection strategy. Finally, using the assumption for the geometrical configuration of the camera system and the <b>circle</b> <b>markers</b> on the plane on which the robot moves, we derive a positioningalgorithm.

The results demonstrated that arrival schedule timelines (least advanced), timelines plus ‘slot marker’ <b>circles,</b> and timelines/slot <b>markers</b> plus speed advisories (most advanced) all enabled controllers to manage arrivals according to the runway schedules and maintain safe separation while keeping aircraft on their assigned routes.

Firstly, a robust ellipse detector is developed to extract ellipses from the image. After the centroids of the ellipses are triangulated into triangle network by Delaunay method to find k annular neighborhood of each ellipse, a cost function is defined to locate orientation ellipses for the homography matrix between the image and the calibration pattern. Then the correspondences between the marker ellipses and the <b>marker</b> <b>circles</b> are established by a homography method followed by a point sets registration strategy.

40|$|Tyt. z nagłówka. Bibliogr. s. 467 - 468. The host {{rocks to}} the Grängesberg apatite-iron oxide ore boudinage show folds with {{opposite}} vergenee {{on either side}} of the boudin and a strong Hneation in the necks (Nilsson et al. 2012). This study aims to, by means of analogue modeling, investigate if the competence contrast between the stiff ore bodies and the host rocks could contribute in creating this deformation pattern. The Grängesberg apatite-iron oxide deposit is located in the Bergslagen province, an area in central Sweden that is known for its numerous mineralisations of various kinds. From the 16 th century up until 1989, when the largest mine in Grängesberg close due to falling metal prices, the Grängesberg ore field produced 150 Mt iron ore, to be compared with the 420 Mt iron ore that the entire Bergslagen province produced up until 1992. The Bergslagen province is located in the south-western part of the Svekokarehan orogen in the Fennoscandian shield. The dominating rocks were formed at ca. 1. 9 Ga in a back-arc setting inboard an active continental margin which were later multiple deformed and metamorphosed (Stephens et al. 2009). The host rocks to the Grängesberg deposit are 1. 90 - 1. 87 Ga regionally metamorphosed and locally hydrothermally altered, manifested as felsic to intermediate volcanic rocks rich in phyllosilicates (Jonsson et al. 2011). The ore bodies occurs as NW-trending sheet like boudins with a moderate to steep easterly dip. Both the ore and the host rock have been affected by at least two fold phases (Fl, F 2) and show well developed L- and S-structures. Locally, the stretching hneation associated with D 2 is strong (Nilsson et al. 2012). The earlier structures have later been refolded by large scale open F 3 buckle folds. Close to the ore bodies, the less competent metavolcanic rocks show F 2 domical folds with opposite vergenee {{on either side of}} the lenses and with a strong hneation at the boudin necks. A granitoid has been thrust over the host rocks near the ore bodies (Nilsson et al. 2012). To investigate if the competence contrast between the ore bodies and the host rock could contribute to the formation of the opposite verging folds and the lineation at the boudin necks seen in Grängesberg, a series of analogue models were run at the Hans Ramberg Tectonic Laboratory at Uppsala University. Analogue modelling is a way to test natural events, but over much shorter time scales. To make analogue models comparable with natural examples, scaling is needed: a faster sequence of events gives room for softer materials to be used as rock analogues. In the Hans Ramberg Tectonic Laboratory, a large centrifuge was used to simulate the force of gravity (Koyi 1997). For this experiment, acrylic glass and modeling clay was used as rock analogues. To mimic the high competence of the ore bodies, a wedge of acrylic glass was used. On the side facing the "host rock" two elongated convex downwards bulges represented the ore bodies. These convex bulges were separated by a narrow neck zone. The wedge was inclined 60 °C to simulate the 50 - 70 °C dip of the ore bodies. As the less competent host rock, plastilina, a soft oil-based clay, was used. Forty 1 mm thick layers of yellow, brown and white plastilina were put together in random order to create a 40 mm thick model. The top most layer was white, and on that a black <b>marker</b> with <b>circles</b> and squares was imprinted. The plastilina was then put in an acrylic glass box with the wedge and run in the centrifuge. During centrifuging, the rigid wedge indented and shortened the plastilina layers. When completed, the model had experienced 800 rpm for a total of 12 minutes, which resulted in 32. 5 % shortening. After shortening, the surface circles closest to the wedge had deformed into ellipses and the surface squares closest to the wedge had become parallelograms. The long axis of the ellipses and parallelograms showed opposite vergence on the sides of the rigid bulges of the wedge. When cutting sections perpendicular to the shortening direction, the model showed patterns between the two boudins resembling those of stretching lineation. Sectioning the model horizontally revealed S- & Z-folds around the indenting boudins. During centrifuging, the wedge indented the plastilina, resembling the possible deformation during thrusting of the deep granite. These results show that the competence of the ore bodies could be sufficient to create opposite verging folds and stretching lineation between the ore bodies. Dostępny również w formie drukowanej.

The efficiency of transfection using calcium-phosphate-precipitated DNA strongly depends on the growth state of recipient cells, concentration of calcium and phosphates, concentration of DNA, pH, temperature, and duration of the precipitation reaction. It is advisable to prepare several buffers with slightly different pH values (see Step 5. iii below) *. - i. Plate CHO DG 44 cells in three 75 -cm 2 flasks the day before transfection. - ii.

Prepare three reaction tubes. In each one, dilute 7 μg of supercoiled plasmid DNA (from Step 4. vii) in 0. 5 mL of CaCl 2 (250 mM), mixed with 0. 5 mL of TR buffer, varying only in its pH value (6. 95, 7. 05, or 7. 10).

Selection is based on binding a fluorescent cell-permeable DHFR inhibitor to the pool of cellular DHFR. Cells with high fluorescence show a high total expression of DHFR, which correlates roughly with copy number (as well as chromosome position effects) *. 6. Select and sort the cells as follows: - i. Grow cells in 25 -cm 2 tissue culture flasks until they are in log phase. - ii. Replace the growth medium with fresh F- 12 (HAM) medium supplemented with FBS (10 %) and FMTX (20 μM). Add glycine (100 μM), hypoxanthine (30 μM), and thymine (30 μM) to the medium to relieve the toxic effects of FMTX. Incubate the cells for 8 h. - iii. Harvest cells by trypsinization, and keep them in sterile PBS on ice. - *Because FMTX is retained in cells at concentrations high enough to cause damage, cells are viable in PBS on ice only for several hours*. - iv. Sort the cells into flasks or 96 -well plates. - v. Grow enough cells for freezing, and freeze them after screening. 7. Prepare a large number of clones for screening or subcloning as follows: - i. Plate cells produced in Step 6 onto a Petri dish at a low density, ideally, 20 - 100 cells per 150 -mm dish. To minimize cross-contamination among neighboring colonies, make sure that the density of plating is low enough and that the colonies are spread out. Use several Petri dishes, titrating the cell concentration by factors of 2 - 3 between dishes, to ensure optimal cell density. - *The action of the trypsin (Step 6. iii) must have progressed enough to ensure the absence of cell clumping and the predominance of single cells in suspension. This is aided by mechanical agitation or by vigorous pipetting of the culture*. - ii. Return the cells to the incubator, and if possible, avoid moving the dishes (particularly after the first few days) for ~ 10 d to allow good-size colonies to form. - *Movement of the dishes will cause cells to dislodge and form satellite colonies and/or a lawn of dispersed cells, increasing cross-contamination*. - iii. Allow the cells to grow until the colonies are well-defined and visible by eye while avoiding overgrowth to minimize colony cross-contamination. Mark individual isolated colonies {{on the bottom of the}} plate with a permanent marker. View the colonies under low magnification to check for the presence of undesirable smaller colonies growing in the vicinity of any colony of interest. 8. If visual screening of the clones is unnecessary, then pick and harvest a large number of colonies from the 150 -mm-diameter Petri dish (from Step 7), using one of the subcloning methods described below. If live visual screening is desired, refer to the Discussion regarding subcloning stable transformants. **Trypsin Method for Picking Colonies** - i. Cut filter paper into small squares, each with an area of ~ 4 mm 2. Use sharp-tipped forceps to place the squares together in a glass Petri dish. Cover them and sterilize by autoclaving. - ii. Aspirate the medium from the Petri dish containing the marked colonies (from Step 7. iii above). - iii. Wash the cells with sterile calcium- and magnesium-free PBS (CMF-PBS), and remove excess liquid. - iv. Dispense trypsin solution into a small sterile Petri dish. Using the sterile forceps, dip a sterile filter paper (from Step 8. i) in trypsin, blot it to remove excess trypsin, and place it over a colony. - v. Repeat Step 8. iv for each of the colonies. Return the Petri dish containing the cells to the incubator for ~ 5 min. - vi. Transfer each filter paper into a separate well of a 96 -well microtiter plate containing 0. 1 mL of tissue culture medium per well. If visual screening will be performed, use a glass-bottom 96 -well plate. Duplicate plating can be accomplished by dipping the filter paper into one well to dislodge some cells, and then dropping the filter paper into a well of a second 96 -well plate. - *The efficiency of colony duplication by this method is close to 100 %. Do not leave the cells without buffer for more than 15 - 20 min or they will dry out. Also, CMF-PBS may induce rounding of cells and/or detachment after prolonged treatment (see Steps 8. x and 8. xi) *. - vii. Grow the collected cells in the 96 -well plates for 1 - 2 d. - viii. Remove the filter paper pieces from the wells, taking care to avoid cross-contamination. One method for doing this is to attach a plastic hose to a vacuum system with an in-line trap. Insert the larger end of a 1 -mL micropipette tip into the hose. Cut the other end of the tip to accommodate a sterile 200 -μL micropipette tip. Next, insert the 200 -μL tip into the bottom of a well. The vacuum will cause the filter paper to adhere to the tip. Withdraw the tip, and discard both the filter paper and the 200 -μL pipette tip. Finally, repeat with the remaining wells, using a fresh sterile 200 -μL tip each time. - ix. Continue to grow the cells until their numbers are sufficient for screening. Screen the cells from each well, and freeze the positive clones. Examine the positive clones by microscopy for the biological activity of interest. **Micropipette Tip Method for Picking Colonies** *This method works well with more densely packed colonies, and it is faster than the trypsin method (Steps 8. i- 8. ix). A few hundred colonies can be easily transferred within a couple of hours. Once this method is optimized, efficiency is near 100 %, although the number of cells transferred per colony into the well may be somewhat lower*. - x. Mark the colonies that are less likely to be cross-contaminated with cells from other colonies. Rinse the cells twice with CMF-PBS (10 mL per 150 -mm dish). Add a small amount of CMF-PBS (~ 4 - 6 mL), just sufficient to cover the surface of the dish, and return the dish to the incubator. - xi. After ~ 5 min, look at the cells under a microscope to see if cells in colonies have rounded. If not, incubate further. Once the cells in the colony have rounded, but are still attached, they can be picked. - xii. Use a permanent <b>marker</b> to <b>circle</b> small groups of colonies on the bottom of the dish. This helps to keep track of which colonies have already been harvested. - xiii. Using a fresh 200 -μL pipette tip per colony, scrape two to three times over the colony while aspirating 10 μL into the pipette tip. Insert the pipette tip into the well of a 96 -well plate, pipetting medium from the well several times into the tip to wash the cells off into the well. - xiv. Grow cells until their numbers are sufficient for screening. Screen the cells from each well, and freeze the positive clones. Examine the positive clones by microscopy for the biological activity of interest. ### DISCUSSION In general, screening of clones uses either a visual, microscope-based screen (if possible) or a molecular or biochemical screen. In some cases, both might be combined, either as two sequential screens or one parallel screen. An example from our work is a screen of a set of 96 subclones transfected with a nonfluorescent VP 16 transcriptional activator fusion protein. A visual immunofluorescence assay was used to test directly for expression of the activator, and a transient transfection expression assay was run to test the capability of each clone to activate a luciferase reporter gene. The intersection of these two screens yielded a clone that induced chromosome repositioning after induction of VP 16 targeting. A starting point for subcloning is to determine roughly what fraction of stable transformants show the desired properties. If this fraction is large, then we typically carry out the initial transformation in a single flask, followed by subsequent subcloning of the mixed stable transformant pool by serial dilution cloning into 96 -well plates. A range of dilutions should be used to ensure success. The advantage of serial dilution is that the investigator can more easily verify whether the cells in a given well actually arise from a single clone. If the fraction of desired cells is small (a few percent or less), and if a visual screen is possible, we prepare a single coverslip from the mixed pool of stable transformants and obtain an initial estimate of exactly how many clones need to be screened. One approach is to initially subclone in pools of clones (e. g., five to 10 per well). In theory, this should allow cloning of even rare transformants through several stages of subcloning. Often, however, the desired subclones are rare because of a selective bias against growth of these clones. In this case, if the pool size is too great, the percentage of desired cells can drop in the culture prior to the next stage of subcloning, producing diminishing returns. A better approach, where possible, is cell sorting with flow cytometry to enrich the cell population with cells containing the desired expression levels (see Step 6 above). When large numbers of clones are required, and if visual screening is unnecessary, we simply pick large numbers of colonies from a 150 -mm-diameter Petri dish, using either small, trypsin-soaked pieces of filter paper (Steps 8. i- 8. ix above) or micropipette tips (Steps 8. x- 8. xiv above). These are used to deposit clonal cells into 96 -well plates. Both methods are very rapid but have a high risk of clone contamination, due to the use of a single Petri dish. Any clones selected, based on a secondary screen, must go through an additiona...|$|R
