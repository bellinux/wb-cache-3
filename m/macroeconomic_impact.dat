He supported H.R. 1874, the Pro-Growth Budgeting Act of 2013, which would have required the Congressional Budget Office to provide a <b>macroeconomic</b> <b>impact</b> analysis for bills that are estimated to have a large budgetary effect. He also supported H.R. 1872, the Budget and Accounting Transparency Act of 2014, which would have modified the budgetary treatment of federal credit programs, including requiring the federal budget to reflect the net impact of programs administered by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, such that the debt of those two programs would be included in the national debt. [...] He also supported H.R. 1871, the Baseline Reform Act of 2013, which would have discontinued the practice of automatic increases for inflation in projecting discretionary appropriations in CBO's baseline budgeting. Arguing in favor of H.R. 1871, Ryan said that [...] "families don't get automatic raises every year. Neither should Washington". He said that these three budget reform bills [...] "are an important step toward restoring fiscal discipline in Washington". Ryan claimed that [...] "by improving the budget process, we can get a better handle on our spending problem".

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to show that <b>macroeconomic</b> <b>impacts</b> might be very {{different}} depending on what strategy developing countries will take. In the first part, we investigate what <b>macroeconomic</b> <b>impacts</b> an increased aversion to liquidity risk can have in a simple open economy model. When the government keeps foreign reserves constant, an increased aversion to liquidity risk reduces liquid debt and increases illiquid debt. However, its <b>macroeconomic</b> <b>impacts</b> are not large, causing only small current account surpluses. In contrast, when the government responds to the shock, the changed aversion increases foreign reserves and may lead to a rise of liquidity debt. In particular, under some reasonable parameter set, it causes large <b>macroeconomic</b> <b>impacts,</b> including significant current account surpluses. In the second part, we provide several empirical supports to the implications. In particular, we explore how foreign debt maturity structures changed in East Asia. We find that many East Asian economies reduced short-term borrowings temporarily after the crisis but increased short-term borrowings in the early 2000 s. We discuss that our results have important implications for the recent deterioration in the U. S. current account. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{assesses the}} <b>macroeconomic</b> <b>impacts</b> {{in terms of}} GDP, trade balance and {{employment}} of large-scale bioenergy production on surplus agricultural land. An input-output model is developed with which the direct, indirect and induced <b>macroeconomic</b> <b>impacts</b> of bioenergy production and agricultural intensification, which is needed to make agricultural land become available for bioenergy production, are assessed following a scenario approach. The methodology is applied to {{a case study of}} Argentina. The results of this study reveal that large-scale pellet production in 2015 would directly increase GDP by 4 %, imports by 10 % and employment by 6 % over the reference situation in 2001. When accounting for indirect and induced impacts, GDP increases by 18 %, imports by 20 % and employment by 26 % compared to 2001. Agricultural intensification reduces but does not negate these positive impacts of bioenergy production. Accounting for agricultural intensification, the increase in GDP as a result of bioenergy production on surplus agricultural land would amount to 16 %, 20 % in imports and 16 % in employment compared to 2001.

40|$|After {{a series}} of crises, many {{developing}} countries came to recognize that reducing liquidity risk is an important self-protection.

Since short-term debt is liquid debt, the instantaneous change after the crisis is consistent with the case where only private agents responded to increased aversion to liquidity risk. However, accompanied by substantial rises in foreign exchange reserves, the change in the early 2000 s is consistent with the case where the government also started to respond. We discuss that our results have important implications for the recent deterioration in the U. S. current account. ...|$|R

Yet, relatively little work has been or is being done by feminist economists on HIV/AIDS. In this paper, the editors briefly survey the recent social science literature on the gendered nature of the epidemic and identify key constructs of feminist economic theory that might be productively applied to understanding HIV/AIDS. For example, an analysis of safe sex within a game-theoretic bargaining framework would highlight the limitations of prevention efforts that focus on changing individual behavior and underscore the impact of gendered institutions on women's likelihood of infection and access to treatment. A gendered analysis of the microeconomic and <b>macroeconomic</b> <b>impacts</b> of HIV/AIDS would contribute to a fuller understanding of the disease's impact on economic well-being.
