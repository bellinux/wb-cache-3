40|$|A {{letter report}} {{issued by the}} General Accounting Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "The Defense Department (DOD) encourages the reuse of excess property, including vehicles, weapons, hand tools, lumber, <b>medical</b> equipment, and <b>furniture.</b> DOD components, civilian federal agencies, and "special programs" have equal priority and first rights to excess property. This report discusses excess property issued to three of 12 special programs [...] the Military Affiliate Radio System, the Civil Air Patrol, and the 12 th Congressional Regional Equipment Center. Between 1995 and 2000, these programs obtained $ 34 million worth of items {{that they were not}} eligible to receive. The three programs were able to obtain the items because the DOD facilities that store the property are not required to verify which items the programs are eligible to receive, and because program officials do not consistently follow applicable guidelines. GAO also noted that the programs' lists of property they are allowed to obtain are not comprehensive because the lists exclude mission-related items similar to those already permitted. Furthermore, these programs did not have reliable records for more than three-quarters of their excess property. Together, the three special programs obtained more than 80, 000 hazardous supplies. In many cases, program officials were unaware that their programs had received such items. GAO found similar problems in other special programs. This lack of accountability increases the risk of mishandling excess property and the potential for waste, fraud, and abuse. ...|$|R
40|$|WO 2006034739 A UPAB: 20060502 NOVELTY - Vacuum {{coating of}} {{at least part of}} a surface with a photo-semiconducting layer (I) {{involves}} adjusting the surface to a predetermined temperature of - 40 to + 250 deg. C; and carrying out reactive pulse magnetron sputtering (PSM) with electrically conductive target(s) containing titanium (Ti) as the main component, in a working gas containing oxygen and an inert gas, to give a mainly Ti oxide coating (I) with a predetermined Ti:O ratio of 1 : 1. 5 - 2. 3. The ratio of ionized and neutral particle rates is such that at least 5 % of the Ti oxide is crystalline; and the PMS parameters are such that the surface is at 300 deg. C or less. USE - The use of the process is claimed for: (1) depositing (I) on at least part of a surface at least partially of temperature-sensitive material, specifically a polymer; (2) forming a super-hydrophilic surface on products such as dust-repellent mirrors or easy-to-clean panes of glass, walls or roofing; (3) forming active self-cleaning articles, such are outdoor tiles or bricks; (4) producing products with antibacterial, virucidal and/or microbe inactivating action, e. g. <b>medical</b> devices or <b>furniture</b> surfaces; (5) producing products for cleaving chemical bonds, e. g. for removing nitrogen or sulfur from gases or cleaving hydrocarbons; or (6) preparing a layer forming part of a multilayer photoelectric system (e. g. a Gratzel cell) or multilayer optical system. ADVANTAGE - Thin (e. g. less than 50 nm) Ti oxide layers with good photocatalytic properties are obtainable at low substrate temperatures...|$|R
40|$|Abstract INTRODUCTION: Acinetobacter baumannii {{is a major}} {{pathogen}} causing {{infections in}} intensive care units (ICUs). In this study, we aimed to evaluate the presence of A. baumannii in an ICU environment and gloves from ICU workers and to characterize the antimicrobial resistance of the isolates in comparison with those isolated from ICU patients at the same hospital. METHODS: ICU samples were collected from March to November 2010. Isolates biochemically characterized as Acinetobacter calcoaceticus-Acinetobacter baumannii complex were evaluated by PCR targeting the 16 S rDNA and bla OXA- 51 genes. Antimicrobial susceptibility was determined using the disk diffusion method, and carbapenem-resistant isolates were also evaluated for the minimum inhibitory concentration of imipenem using broth microdilution. The presence of the bla OXA- 23 gene was evaluated in isolates with reduced susceptibility to carbapenems. RESULTS: A. baumannii was detected in 9. 5 % (84) of the 886 samples collected from the ICU environment, including from <b>furniture,</b> <b>medical</b> devices, and gloves, with bed rails being the most contaminated location (23. 8 %; 20 / 84). Multidrug-resistant (MDR) A. baumannii was found in 98. 8 % (83 / 84) of non-clinical and 97. 8 % (45 / 46) of clinical isolates. Reduced susceptibility to carbapenems was detected in 83. 3 % (70 / 84) of non-clinical and 80. 4 % (37 / 46) of clinical isolates. All isolates resistant to carbapenems harbored bla OXA- 23. CONCLUSIONS: We found a strong similarity between the antimicrobial susceptibility profiles of non-clinical and clinical A. baumannii isolates. Such data highlight the ICU environment as a potential origin for the persistence of MDR A. baumannii, and hence the ICU may {{be a source of}} hospital-acquired infections caused by this microorganism...|$|R
40|$|The modern {{consumer}} {{is exposed to}} a wide variety of plastic and rubber products in his day to day life: at home, work, school, shopping, recreation and play, and transport. A large variety of toxic sequellae have resulted from untoward exposures by many different routes: oral, dermal, inhalation, and parenteral. Toxic change may result from the plastic itself, migration of unbound components and additives, chemical decomposition or toxic pyrolysis products. The type of damage may involve acute poisoning, chronic organ damage, reproductive disorders, and carcinogenic, mutagenic and teratogenic episodes. Typical examples for all routes are cited along with the activities of Canadian regulatory agencies to reduce both the incidence and severity of plastic-induced disease. After the final manufacturing and processing steps, a considerable portion of the plastic industries' products are sold as consumer or household items. Other plastic articles may appear in public places (schools, theaters, stores, transport vehicles), or they could be widely dispersed throughout the work force and thus come into frequent contact with the population. Thus, man in his modern existence is inextricably linked and exposed to the many products of the polymer and rubber industries. One can cite toys, clothing, <b>furniture,</b> <b>medical</b> devices, food containers, paints, sporting equipment, recreational articles, pens, pencils, construction materials such as water pipes, insulation, electrical wiring; the list is endless, but all may incorporate modern plastics. The routes of exposure to polymers include oral ingestion, dermal adsorption, inhalation, and ccntact with skin and eye. We may have exposure to heavy metals, plasticizers, stabilizers, fillers, dyes, residual monomers, antioxidants, fire retardants, and in cases of fire, a large number of thermal decomposition products. Hazards include acute poisoning and chronic toxicity, sensitization and corrosive damage t...|$|R

A. V. Hobbs, medical officer for the army schools, recommended the ban on public gatherings; he said that influenza is crowd disease and that medical care is a poor preventive; he argued that reported cases represent only a third of the cases in the city and the majority are light cases walking around the city infecting other people; he suggested that half of all people are likely immune, but that 15 percent of influenza cases develop into pneumonia which has a 50 % mortality rate• Dr. R. E.
