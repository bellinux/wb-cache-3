40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{findings from}} an exploratory study of sin. Based on nine in-depth interviews with self-identified religious people, we demonstrate that respondents define sin as (1) nonconformity, (2) {{relative to other}} social realities, and (3) taught by <b>moral</b> <b>authorities.</b> In so doing, respondents’ definitions reveal that sin, despite its use to justify all types of social policies, is a social construction that has no established concrete meaning in daily life. In conclusion, we argue that social scientists would benefit greatly from systematic analyses of the meaning (lessness) and significance of sin in people’s lives as well as within existing social scientific literature, and propose avenues for research concerning this term...|$|R
5|$|However, {{in order}} to {{accomplish}} its aims, morality must be legitimate in the eyes of those to whom it speaks. As Durkheim argues, this <b>moral</b> <b>authority</b> is primarily to be located in religion, which is why in any religion one finds a code of morality. For Durkheim, it is only society that has the resources, the respect, and the power to cultivate within an individual both the obligatory and the desirous aspects of morality.|$|E
5|$|In 1957, King, Ralph Abernathy, Fred Shuttlesworth, Joseph Lowery, {{and other}} {{civil rights activists}} founded the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC). The group was created to harness the <b>moral</b> <b>authority</b> and {{organizing}} power of black churches to conduct nonviolent protests {{in the service of}} civil rights reform. One of the group's inspirations was the crusades of evangelist Billy Graham, who befriended King after he attended a Graham crusade in New York City in 1957. King led the SCLC until his death. The SCLC's 1957 Prayer Pilgrimage for Freedom was the first time King addressed a national audience. Other civil rights leaders involved in the SCLC with King included: James Bevel, Allen Johnson, Curtis W. Harris, Walter E. Fauntroy, C. T. Vivian, Andrew Young, The Freedom Singers, Charles Evers, Cleveland Robinson, Randolph Blackwell, Annie Bell Robinson Devine, Charles Kenzie Steele, Alfred Daniel Williams King, Benjamin Hooks, Aaron Henry and Bayard Rustin.|$|E
5|$|Modern historians hold widely varying {{opinions}} of the Crusaders. To some, their conduct was incongruous with the stated aims and implied <b>moral</b> <b>authority</b> of the papacy, {{as evidenced by the}} fact that on occasion the Pope excommunicated Crusaders. Crusaders often pillaged as they travelled, and their leaders generally retained control of captured territory instead of returning it to the Byzantines. During the People's Crusade, thousands of Jews were murdered in what is now called the Rhineland massacres. Constantinople was sacked during the Fourth Crusade. However, the Crusades {{had a profound impact on}} Western civilisation: they reopened the Mediterranean to commerce and travel (enabling Genoa and Venice to flourish); they consolidated the collective identity of the Latin Church under papal leadership; and they constituted a wellspring for accounts of heroism, chivalry, and piety that galvanised medieval romance, philosophy, and literature. The Crusades also reinforced the connection between Western Christendom, feudalism, and militarism.|$|E

5|$|Scottish Protestantism in {{the seventeenth}} century was highly focused on the Bible, which was seen as infallible and the major source of <b>moral</b> <b>authority.</b> In {{the early part of the}} century the Genevan {{translation}} was commonly used.

Books of devotion were distributed to encourage the practice and ministers were encouraged to investigate whether this was being carried out.|$|E
5|$|Singapore's Elected Presidency {{scheme was}} {{created as a}} {{constitutional}} safeguard for the nation's future to prevent irresponsible governance. Being directly elected by the people gives the President legitimacy and <b>moral</b> <b>authority</b> {{to serve as a}} check on the executive's powers. The President's two main responsibilities are the protection of Singapore's past reserves and the preservation of the integrity of the public service. However, the President's role is custodial and ceremonial – he does not exercise executive powers. In fact, the President is generally required to act in accordance with the advice of the Cabinet, or of a Minister acting under the general authority of the Cabinet, in the exercise of his functions under the Constitution or any other written law, unless the contrary is expressly provided for.|$|E

The seventeenth century marked the high-water mark of kirk discipline. Kirk sessions were able to apply religious sanctions, such as excommunication and denial of baptism, to enforce godly behaviour and obedience. In more difficult cases of immoral behaviour they could work with the local magistrate, in a system modelled on that employed in Geneva.|$|E
5000|$|The {{vice-president}} of the Student Council and {{daughter of a}} disgraced former Diet member who unsuccessfully fought against the public morality laws. Ayame secretly acts outside of school as the perverted terrorist [...] "Blue Snow," [...] wearing panties over her face, spreading semi-pornographic leaflets, and shouting dirty jokes {{in defiance of the}} Japanese <b>moral</b> <b>authorities.</b> After kidnapping Tanukichi, she decides to form the group SOX with him and expand her activities to include the school and beyond. Her father taught her a code she can use on her mobile phone that disables the collars and PMs she wears for 3 minutes per day allowing her to freely say or do any lewd things during the time. Later on, it is shown that she might have developed romantic feelings for Tanukichi as she starts to act shy when the two of them are alone.|$|R

50|$|A budding {{scientist}} and classmate of Tanukichi who {{is obsessed with}} solving the mystery behind how babies are truly conceived, as the Japanese <b>moral</b> <b>authorities</b> have censored everything pertaining to sex education beyond vague generalities. She {{even went so far}} as to constantly visit gynecology clinics and hospitals in order to learn more until she was banned from visiting them. Often collects insects to study their reproductive habits. She has a very sharp sense of observation, able to deduce Kosuri's manipulative tactics, tell a fake gun from a real one, and convincing Oboro that her yaoi comics have an educational value through Oboro's restrictive mannerisms. She believes Tanukichi may hold the answers to her questions due to his knowledge of sexual terms and pesters him constantly to reveal what he knows about pregnancy to her. Though not officially a member of SOX, she helps them out from time to time because she is aware (to some degree) of the identities of its members.|$|R

One such example was the Monastery of the Entrance of the Mother of God into the Temple in Kozelsk, which is also known as the Optina Monastery. The pilgrims who travelled to this spiritual centre were not only common people. Russian philosophers and writers were also guests at the monastery on several occasions. The spiritual nourishment which they received from the monks influenced their creativity and life aspirations. The Elders of the Optina Monastery became for them spiritual guides and <b>moral</b> <b>authorities,</b> and even creative inspiration. The creators of Russian culture at that time, who were in contact with the Optina Monastery include, Ivan Kireyevsky, Nikolai Gogol, Fyodor Dostoevsky and Konstantin Leontyev.

40|$|In this {{scientific}} description {{are presented}} results of researches on {{the transmission of}} educational values in families among generations. The first results and opinions from presented sectors of researches let us draw the following conclusions: 1. The familiar transmission of educational values depends on the familiar conditions, such as: living conditions of family, environment, number of children and education, including level of pedagogical knowledge. 2. Stabilisation of familiar educational values is noticeable. The family, in spite of social destabilisation, keeps considerable stabilisation on a scale transmission values especially into closest generations. 3. In transmission of values are preferred methods of positive influence especially paying attention to positive communication among family members, good atmosphere of family nest and family traditions. 4. Negative bearing of intergeneration transmission of educational values {{is a fact that}} other educational environments can’t help family. Lack of <b>moral</b> <b>authorities</b> and endless discussions about the education ideal and even it’s negation is sensible...|$|R
40|$|This article {{seeks to}} dissect, with {{reference}} to Bhutan’s polity, how the Eurocentric, popular wisdom of democracy, privileging liberal democracy, inadvertently enforces closure to other plausible, non-liberalistic interpretations. In Bhutan, the monarchy and Buddhism carry <b>moral</b> <b>authorities</b> constraining the arbitrary use of governmental power, and nurturing associative bonds in society. This “natural democracy ” contravenes the orthodoxy of liberal democracy, according to which the state, as a neutral arbiter, must not accord a special status to any leader or religion. For this reason, political analysts tend to doubt whether Bhutan is a democracy. The circumscribed, liberal-democratic notion emanates from the history in which European universalism has been fabricated as a universal standard to be disseminated throughout the globe. It has thus served to rank different societies in a linear trajectory that positions Europe {{at the pinnacle of}} “progress”. The case of Bhutan potentially helps to rectify the constricted wisdom of democracy, to facilitate more open, thorough deliberations, and to start conceptualizing a multipolar world...|$|R

It is also implied that due to his upbringing, he finds the lewd activities to be quite stimulating to some extent, though he denies it.

40|$|The current {{generation}} of crop-based biofuels is heavily contested for its negative consequences for {{the environment and the}} poor. Hence, the current biofuel system needs to be transformed in the direction of what can be labelled 'fair fuels': (bio) fuels that are environmentally and socially sustainable. Conventional state environmental authorities have limited power and legitimacy to effectively regulate the sustainability of current global biofuels. Hence, we witness the emergence of private market environmental <b>authorities,</b> <b>moral</b> environmental <b>authorities</b> and all kinds of hybrid authorities in biofuel regulation. These new forms of environmental authority should neither be condemned as ineffective and undemocratic nor celebrated as the modern answer to transnational environmental problems that face state failure.

40|$|Violent {{computer}} games are becoming an increasingly common phenomenon of leisure activities among {{children and the}} young. Most researchers and practical educators consider them a dangerous phenomenon that encourages violence in everyday life. A kind of cyclic round goes from children who, {{due to a lack}} of sensitive communication, quickly feel certain tensions and quench them by resorting to media violence where {{computer games}} take the lead in the modern environment. Educators suggest the creation of situations where children and adolescents can speak out and express their pain in different ways. An in-depth expression of children’s and adolescents’ experiences does not only change their feelings, but extends to the changes at the level of neurobiological functioning. Adults, especially parents, help children mostly in overcoming violence if, in sensitive communication, they radiate happiness with their own lives and the ability to solve problems and give signs of unconditional acceptance and love. In such communication, children and young people re-experience their parents and other educators as strong personalities and <b>moral</b> <b>authorities</b> whom they love and respect...|$|R
