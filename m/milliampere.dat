2500|$|One of E-meter's primary {{components}} is a Wheatstone bridge, {{an electrical}} circuit configuration invented in 1833 {{that enables the}} detection of very small differences between two electrical impedances (in this case, resistance). The E-meter is constructed so that one resistance is the subject's body {{and the other is}} a rheostat controlled by the operator. A small voltage from the battery is applied to electrodes held in the subjects hands. As the electrical properties (electrodermal activity) of the subject's body changes during the counseling, the resulting changes in the small electric current are displayed in needle movements on a large analog panel meter. The dial face is without numbers because the absolute resistance in ohms is relatively unimportant, while the operator watches primarily for characteristic needle motions. [...] The voltage applied to the electrodes is less than 1.5V, and the electric current through the subject's body is less than a half a <b>milliampere.</b>|$|E

Introduced by Sylvania in 1939 (and used mostly by Philco), this valve {{was the product}} of adding a suppressor grid to type 7B8, which was the loctal version of type 6A7. Adding the suppressor allowed Sylvania to lower the current of the 6.3-volt heater from 320 <b>milliamperes</b> to 150 <b>milliamperes</b> while maintaining the same conversion transconductance (550 microsiemens).

50|$|Loop {{signaling}} {{was offered}} {{in two different}} configurations for Western Union Telex in the United States. The first option, sometimes called local or loop service, provided a 60 <b>milliampere</b> loop circuit from the exchange to the customer teleprinter. The second option, sometimes called long distance or polar was used when a 60 <b>milliampere</b> connection could not be achieved, provided a ground return polar circuit using 35 milliamperes on separate send and receive wires. By the 1970s, and {{under pressure from the}} Bell operating companies wanting to modernize their cable plant and lower the adjacent circuit noise that these telex circuits sometimes caused, Western Union migrated customers to a third option called F1F2. This F1F2 option replaced the DC voltage of the local and long distance options with modems at the exchange and subscriber ends of the telex circuit.|$|E

50|$|An ammeter (from Ampere Meter) is a {{measuring}} instrument {{used to measure}} the current in a circuit. Electric currents are measured in amperes (A), hence the name. Instruments used to measure smaller currents, in the <b>milliampere</b> or microampere range, are designated as milliammeters or microammeters.

The influence of ECG gating, kilovoltage and <b>milliamperes</b> on image quality was tested using the χ 2 test, Fisher’s exact test and the Kruskal-Wallis test. The correlation between blooming artefacts and kilovoltage and <b>milliamperes</b> was investigated with the Spearman correlation coefficient.

50|$|The {{only way}} to express a nonstandard order of {{magnitude}} as an SI unit is to combine two prefixed SI derived units whose component base units cancel out; for example, units of 105 seconds could be expressed as kilojoules per centiwatt (kJ/cW) or hectocoulombs per <b>milliampere</b> (hC/mA). Such misuse of SI derived units can create a cognitive dissonance; to do so requires the invocation of units {{not directly related to}} the quantity being measured (coulombs and amperes, for example, quantify electricity, making it awkward to combine the two in a way that creates a unit of time with no electrical component).|$|E
50|$|For {{an analog}} meter movement, DC voltage is {{measured}} with a series resistor connected between the meter movement and the circuit under test. A switch (usually rotary) allows greater resistance to be inserted in series with the meter movement to read higher voltages. The product of the basic full-scale deflection current of the movement, and {{the sum of the}} series resistance and the movement's own resistance, gives the full-scale voltage of the range. As an example, a meter movement that required 1 <b>milliampere</b> for full scale deflection, with an internal resistance of 500 ohms, would, on a 10-volt range of the multimeter, have 9,500 ohms of series resistance.|$|E

50|$|One factor {{often not}} taken into {{consideration}} when discussing CDI spark energy is the actual energy provided to the spark gap versus the energy applied to the primary side of the coil. As a simple example, a typical ignition coil may have a secondary winding resistance of 4000 ohms and a secondary current of 400 <b>milliamperes.</b> Once a spark has struck, the voltage across the spark gap in a running engine drops to a relatively low value, {{in the order of}} 1500-2000 volts. This, combined {{with the fact that the}} coil secondary current of 400 <b>milliamperes</b> loses approximately 1600 volts through the 4000 ohm secondary resistance means that fully 50% of the energy is lost in heating the coil secondary. Actual measurements show the real world efficiency to be only 35 to 38% when coil primary winding losses are included.|$|R
50|$|Porcelain {{insulators}} {{may have}} a semi-conductive glaze finish, so that a small current (a few <b>milliamperes)</b> passes through the insulator. This warms the surface slightly and reduces the effect of fog and dirt accumulation.

50|$|II: glow discharge, {{which occurs}} once the {{breakdown}} voltage is reached. The voltage across the electrodes suddenly drops {{and the current}} increases to <b>milliampere</b> range. At lower currents, the voltage across the tube is almost current-independent; this is used in glow discharge voltage stabilizers. At lower currents, {{the area of the}} electrodes covered by the glow discharge is proportional to the current. At higher currents the normal glow turns into abnormal glow, the voltage across the tube gradually increases, and the glow discharge covers {{more and more of the}} surface of the electrodes. Low-power switching (glow-discharge thyratrons), voltage stabilization, and lighting applications (e.g. Nixie tubes, decatrons, neon lamps) operate in this region.|$|E
50|$|Analog {{systems may}} {{communicate}} a single condition, {{such as water}} level in a livestock tank. A transmitter at the tank site continually sends a signal with a constant audio tone. The tone would change in pitch to indicate the tank's water level. A meter at the remote end would vary, corresponding to the tone pitch, to indicate {{the amount of water}} present in the livestock tank. Similar methods can be used to telemeter any analog condition. This type of radio system serves a purpose equivalent to a four-to-twenty <b>milliampere</b> loop. In the US, mid-band 72-76 MHz or UHF 450-470 MHz interstitial channels are often used for these systems. Some systems multiplex telemetry of several analog conditions by limiting each to a separate range of tone pitches, for example.|$|E
50|$|Silicon is an earth {{abundant}} element, and is fairly inexpensive to refine to high purity. When alloyed with lithium {{it has a}} theoretical capacity of ~3,600 <b>milliampere</b> hours per gram (mAh/g), which is nearly 10 times the energy density of graphite electrodes (372 mAh/g). One of silicon's inherent traits, unlike carbon, is {{the expansion of the}} lattice structure by as much as 400% upon full lithiation (charging). For bulk electrodes, this causes great structural stress gradients within the expanding material, inevitably leading to fractures and mechanical failure, which significantly limits the lifetime of the silicon anodes.
