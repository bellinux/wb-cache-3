50|$|An advance {{directive}} {{allows you}} to generally state what treatments you would or would not want in a medical crisis, {{but it is not}} a <b>medical</b> <b>order.</b> POLST provides explicit guidance to health professionals under predictable future circumstances based on your current medical condition. A POLST form turns treatment wishes outlined in an advance directive into medical orders. An individual does not need to have an advance directive to have a POLST form although health care professionals recommend that all competent adults have advance directives in place. If the individual lacks decisional capacity, a surrogate can engage in the conversation and the consent process that forms the basis of the POLST process.|$|E

50|$|Patients {{should also}} include advance health care directives. These three medical orders (DNR, MOST, POLST) must be signed by a {{physician}} and are {{the most frequently used}} medical directives. The DNR (Do Not Resuscitate order) expresses the patient's preference to decline Cardio-Pulmonary-Resuscitation (CPR). The names of the other more comprehensive physician orders (MOST form or POLST form) will vary by your state. In some states - it is called a MOST order form (<b>Medical</b> <b>Order</b> for Scope of Treatment) and in other states this document is called a POLST order form (Physician Order for Life Sustaining Treatment). These medical treatment preference documents are critical - especially for the elderly for whom resuscitation by emergency responders (EMTs) may cause painful and/or life-threatening injuries. Without these documents to guide the emergency responder - patients must understand that EMTs are trained to automatically administer a full range of emergency life saving measures. For many patients such measures may be a wonderful blessing; for others who are elderly or frail or in very poor health - these same measures may be a curse. The patient who wishes to decline automatic EMT measures - should be aware that most jurisdictions will require that the DNR, the MOST, and the POLST documents included in the Vial of Life container be original versions including the physician's signature.|$|E

5000|$|On 13 August 1989, after celebrating his Sunday Mass, he {{was asked}} by the consul of West Germany in Budapest to help {{accommodate}} {{and take care of the}} East German refugees, who were flooding into Hungary and thus, paralysing the embassy’s work. Father Kozma agreed to that without the slightest hesitation. As he said it later: [...] "A medieval interpretation of the church has come to life again: Shelter". Refugees from East Germany were accommodated by the Parish in Zugliget from 14 August. That very evening nearly a thousand people were sheltered but the following months a series of new sanctuaries provided for almost 48 600 people altogether. The consulate of West Germany even moved to the garden of the parish for a time. These events captured the attention of the leadership of East Germany as well; a list of 101 people was compiled of people they were planning to take to the International Court of Justice, with Imre Kozma in the lead, for helping those who violated the laws of [...] "Sovereign East Germany". [...] The Hungarian Charity Service of the Order of Malta was facing another humanitarian crisis in December, at the time of the Romanian revolution; then they gathered twenty-two truckloads of donations and transported them to Transylvania. At the time of the War in Yugoslavia in the 1990s Father Kozma managed to convince the Serbian commander of Vukovar to let those elderly and young, who were trapped in the city, to flee to Hungary. Since then, the Charity service has built a countrywide network and it is one of the biggest charity services of Hungary. Father Kozma has joined the Humanitarian <b>Medical</b> <b>Order</b> of Knight Hospitallers and he took his vow in 1999, later he became the preceptor in Budapest. He arranged the reintroduction of the Order in Hungary and successfully reclaimed their hospitals in Vác and Budapest in 2000.|$|E

40|$|UNLABELLED: The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to assess whether the introduction of a new preformatted <b>medical</b> <b>order</b> sheet coupled with an introductory course affected prescription quality and the frequency of errors during the prescription stage in a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). Two-phase observational study consisting of two consecutive 4 -month phases: pre-intervention (phase 0) and post-intervention (phase I) conducted in an 11 -bed NICU in a Swiss university hospital. Interventions consisted of the introduction of a new preformatted <b>medical</b> <b>order</b> sheet with explicit information supplied, coupled with a staff introductory course on appropriate prescription and medication errors. The main outcomes measured were formal aspects of prescription and frequency and nature of prescription errors. Eighty-three and 81 patients were included in phase 0 and phase I, respectively. A total of 505 handwritten prescriptions in phase 0 and 525 in phase I were analysed. The rate of prescription errors decreased significantly from 28. 9  % in phase 0 to 13. 5  % in phase I (p[*]<[*] 0. 05). Compared with phase 0, dose errors, name confusion and errors in frequency and rate of drug administration decreased in phase I, from 5. 4 to 2. 7  % (p[*]<[*] 0. 05), 5. 9 to 0. 2  % (p[*]<[*] 0. 05), 3. 6 to 0. 2  % (p[*]<[*] 0. 05), and 4. 7 to 2. 1  % (p[*]<[*] 0. 05), respectively. The rate of incomplete and ambiguous prescriptions decreased from 44. 2 to 25. 7 and 8. 5 to 3. 2  % (p[*]<[*] 0. 05), respectively. CONCLUSION: Inexpensive and simple interventions can improve the intelligibility of prescriptions and reduce medication errors. WHAT IS KNOWN: ? Medication errors are frequent in NICUs and prescription is one of the most critical steps. ? CPOE reduce prescription errors, but their implementation is not available everywhere. What is New: ? Preformatted <b>medical</b> <b>order</b> sheet coupled with an introductory course decrease medication errors in a NICU. ?

40|$|Background: To {{evaluate}} off-label and off-NCCN guidelines uses of antineoplastic {{drugs in}} a major Chinese hospital. Methods: Totally 1122 patients were selected from July to December 2011. Then, the off-label and off-NCCN guidelines uses of antineoplastic drugs were analyzed. Results: In 798 of 1122 patients (71. 12 %), drugs were used for off-label. In 317 of 1122 patients (28. 25 %), the drugs were prescribed for off-label and off-NCCN guidelines. 2591 <b>medical</b> <b>orders</b> for 1122 patients, 1051 / 2591 (40. 56 %) <b>medical</b> <b>orders</b> were off-label; 445 / 2591 (17. 17 %) <b>medical</b> <b>orders</b> were off-label and off-NCCN guidelines. In 445 off-label and off-NCCN <b>medical</b> <b>orders,</b> 399 (89. 66 %) were unapproved indications, 38 (8. 54 %) were unapproved drug concentration and 12 (2. 70 %) were unapproved route of administration. Percentage of off-label and off-NCCN guidelines drug uses in male was higher than that in female (21. 92 % vs. 11. 39 %, P< 0. 01). Compared with other lines of treatment, percentage of off-label and off-NCCN guidelines drug uses in postoperative adjuvant was the smallest (P< 0. 01) and percentage in three or multi-line treatments was the highest (P< 0. 01). The pancreatic cancer possessed the highest percentage (38. 74 %) of off-label and off-NCCN guidelines drug uses among all types of cancer (P< 0. 01). Conclusion: Off-label uses of antineoplastic drugs are generally common in China hospitals based on NCCN guidelines. The fact suggests that anti-tumor treatment was relatively standard in China. Off-label and off-NCCN guidelines drug uses were mainly for individual treatment. Doctors should fully consider the adverse drug reaction, contraindication, cautions and increase the drug security monitoring. Uncorrected drug concentration should be avoided for drug ris...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{assess whether}} {{formatting}} the <b>medical</b> <b>order</b> sheet {{has an effect}} on the accuracy and security of antibiotics prescription. DESIGN: Prospective assessment of antibiotics prescription over time, before and after the intervention, in comparison with a control ward. SETTING: The medical and surgical intensive care unit (ICU) of a university hospital. PATIENTS: All patients hospitalized in the medical or surgical ICU between February 1 and April 30, 1997, and July 1 and August 31, 2000, for whom antibiotics were prescribed. INTERVENTION: Formatting of the <b>medical</b> <b>order</b> sheet in the surgical ICU in 1998. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Compliance with the American Society of Hospital Pharmacists' criteria for prescription safety was measured. The proportion of safe orders increased in both units, but the increase was 4. 6 times greater in the surgical ICU (66 % vs. 74 % in the medical ICU and 48 % vs. 74 % in the surgical ICU). For unsafe orders, the proportion of ambiguous orders decreased by half in the medical ICU (9 % vs. 17 %) and nearly disappeared in the surgical ICU (1 % vs. 30 %). The only missing criterion remaining in the surgical ICU was the drug dose unit, which could not be preformatted. The aim of antibiotics prescription (either prophylactic or therapeutic) was indicated only in 51 % of the order sheets. CONCLUSIONS: Formatting of the order sheet markedly increased security of antibiotics prescription. These findings must be confirmed in other settings and with different drug classes. Formatting the <b>medical</b> <b>order</b> sheet decreases the potential for prescribing errors before full computerized prescription is available...|$|E
