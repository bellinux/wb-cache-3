40|$|ABSTRACT. The {{tractive}} {{performance of}} a new tire, a worn tire, and a worn tire with forestry tire chains was measured in four soil types. Two of the soil types simulated forest-floor conditions with one soil type having a surface cover of pine straw and the other having a surface cover of sod. The two remaining soil types were bare. The worn tire with and <b>without</b> <b>chains</b> had higher net traction than the new tire. Tractive efficiency was highest for the worn tire <b>without</b> <b>chains</b> in all soil types...|$|R

50|$|The kinetic {{chain length}} v {{is a measure}} of the average number of monomer units {{reacting}} with an active center during its lifetime and is related to the molecular weight through the mechanism of the termination. <b>Without</b> <b>chain</b> transfer, the kinetic chain length is only a function of propagation rate and initiation rate.|$|R

40|$|The {{effect of}} the {{addition}} of chain stoppers to solutions of hydrogen-bonded reversible supramolecular polymers was studied by vapor pressure osmometry and static and dynamic light scattering. Vapor pressure osmometry showed that {{within the range of}} concentrations studied the average degree of polymerization is independent of the overall monomer concentration and roughly inversely proportional to the mole fraction of chain stoppers, in agreement with theoretical predictions. The correlation length as measured by static light scattering has a maximum at the overlap concentration in solutions <b>without</b> <b>chain</b> stoppers. In the presence of a fixed fraction of chain stoppers, the results coincide with those <b>without</b> <b>chain</b> stoppers at low and high concentrations, but there is a plateau in the correlation length at intermediate concentrations. From the data, information about the association constant and the persistence length of the chains is obtained. The effectiveness of the chain stopper is discussed, and the results from osmometry and static light scattering are compared. Dynamic light scattering was used to measure the time autocorrelation function. From the characteristic decay time, the hydrodynamic correlation length was calculated. For solutions above the overlap concentration, the distribution of decay times showed a second peak at longer times. It is not yet fully understood what the mechanism behind this slow mode i...|$|R

40|$|The motion {{resistance}} ratio, gross traction {{ratio and}} net traction ratio of a wheel cable skidder were determined and mathematical models derived for three tire inflation pressure values with or <b>without</b> tire <b>chains</b> on forest road in mountainous conditions. The motion resistance ratio increases {{with the increase}} of tire inflation pressure. On the contrary, the gross traction ratio increases with the decrease of tire inflation pressure. However, when the tires are equipped with tire chains the skidder motion resistance is higher. The motion resistance ratio with tire chains also increases with the decrease of tire inflation pressure due to windage between the tires and chains, which results in lower tractive performance of tire chains. Therefore, by using tire chains, an increase of gross tractive ratio could be achieved, as well as the increase of motion resistance ratio compared to tires <b>without</b> <b>chains.</b> The results of the study show that it is strongly recommended to use tire chains as tightly as possible...|$|R

We study <b>chains</b> <b>without</b> precompression, <b>chains</b> precompressed by a constant force at the chain ends (constant precompression), and chains precompressed by gravity (variable precompression).

50|$|Synthesis of block {{copolymers}} by sequential monomer addition {{is one of}} {{the most}} important applications of living polymerization as it offers the best control over structure. The nucleophilicity of the resulting carbanion will govern the order of monomer addition, as the monomer forming the less nucleophilic propagating species may inhibit the addition of the more nucleophilic monomer onto the chain.
