50|$|Peucedanum palustre (milk-parsley) is {{an almost}} glabrous {{biennial}} plant in the family Apiaceae. It is so called in English because of the thin, foetid, milky latex found in its young parts and is native to most of Europe, extending eastwards to Central Asia. Another English common name for the plant is <b>marsh</b> <b>hogs</b> fennel (hogs fennel (unqualified) and sea hogs fennel, by contrast, are common names of Peucedanum officinale, a perennial species in the same genus, found in drier habitats, but having similar medicinal properties).|$|R

50|$|Unlike other swallowtails which specialise on Rutaceae, {{this species}} mostly feeds on plants of family Umbelliferae, females laying eggs singly. Milk parsley (also known as <b>marsh</b> <b>hog's</b> fennel) is {{normally}} the only food plant {{used by the}} caterpillars of the British subspecies. The food plants of the swallowtail in Europe, Asia, and North America are more varied than in the UK. It uses {{a wide variety of}} umbellifers including wild carrot (Daucus carota), wild angelica (Angelica sylvestris), fennel (Foeniculum vulgare), and hogweeds (Heracleum). In the Maltese Islands, the caterpillar feeds on plants such as rue (Ruta chalepensis) in addition to Umbelliferae such as fennel.|$|R

Approximate countervailing duty formulae for two alternative objectives are derived, the permissible range of these duties is illustrated, and empirical evidence is provided. To restore equilibrium at the pre-subsidy level in the U. <b>S.</b> <b>hog</b> market, a countervailing duty on hog imports suffices; this duty should be less than the unit hog production subsidy. To restore equilibrium in both the U. <b>S.</b> <b>hog</b> and pork markets, countervailing duties in both hog and pork imports is required. Such duties should be less than the unit subsidy, and the duty on pork should be less than the duty on hogs. ...|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} studies {{environmental regulation}} {{issues in the}} hog production industry as well as forces behind the reorganization of the industry {{during the past two}} decades. Federal and State-level environmental regulations imposed on U. <b>S.</b> <b>hog</b> production during the year 2003 are examined in Chapter 1. Based on the number of regulations passed by the Federal government and states, the 2003 regulatory index is constructed. The regulatory stringency index suggests that state-level regulations vary across states and have increased over the years. In addition, state-level regulations are more stringent than federal regulations. ^ Chapter 2 develops an empirically implementable theoretical model which allows us to investigate the long-run effects of environmental regulations on the U. <b>S.</b> <b>hog</b> industry. Hog feeding operations (HFOs) are divided into large feeding operations (LHFOs) and small feeding operations (SHFOs). The impact of the presence {{of a large number of}} LHFOs on the entry and exit of CHFOs is also examined. Results of this study suggest that: Increased state-level regulation stringency significantly lowers the output of SHFOs; increased state-level regulation stringency significantly lowers the output of LHFOs; increased state-level regulation stringency significantly lowers the number of SHFOs; SHFO output rises significantly in states that have a greater number of LHFOs; LHFO output rises significantly in states that have a greater number of LHFOs; the number of SHFOs significantly increases in states that have a greater numbers of LHFOs; regulation increases the average SHFO size; and regulation decreases the average LHFO size. ^ Chapter 3 examines the importance of input availability, market attractiveness, agglomeration economies and environmental regulations on the reorganization of U. <b>S.</b> <b>hog</b> production for a panel of 22 U. <b>S.</b> <b>hog</b> producing states which include, Northern states, Southern states and Midwest states for the period 1994 - 2006. Results from this study suggest that: Hog production in a state is positively affected by hog production in a nearby state, confirming the presence of agglomeration economies; Environmental regulations and high corn price have negative effects on state-level U. <b>S.</b> <b>hog</b> production; High hog prices, and favorable labor cost, and land values attract hog production; and transportation cost has no effect on hog production. ...|$|R

40|$|Conventional wisdom {{holds that}} a small and {{decreasing}} number of hog slaughter firms are using their "market power" {{to take advantage of}} U. <b>S.</b> <b>hog</b> producers. Existing studies have simply calculated industry concentration ratios and assumed/asserted that the performance of such a concentrated industry must be different from the performance of a perfectly competitive industry. These researchers have rejected without testing the hypothesis that: the observed performance of the U. <b>S.</b> <b>hog</b> slaughter industry is not different from the performance that would be generated by a perfectly competitive industry. This paper derives the theoretical relationships between hog and pork prices, and hence the farm-wholesale price spread, that would exist in a perfectly competitive slaughter hog market. These performance norms are then confronted with observed weekly price/quantity relationships over the 1991 - 2001 period to compare observed market performance with the ideal performance norms derived from the economic theory of a perfectly competitive market. Based on the market performance measures derived from economic theory of a perfectly competitive market, the hypothesis that the U. <b>S.</b> <b>hog</b> slaughter hog market is a perfectly competitive market cannot be rejected. There simply is not any evidence to support allegations of abuse of market power by meat packers. Agribusiness, Industrial Organization, Livestock Production/Industries,...|$|R

40|$|Canadian hog {{producers}} {{are eligible for}} a federal/provincial hog stabilization program which, under certain conditions, makes deficiency payments to producers enrolled in the program. Currently, producers pay premiums of approximately one-third {{of the cost of}} the program, whereas federal and provincial authorities share the remaining two-thirds of the cost. There are no direct subsidies to pork processors. In 1984, U. <b>S.</b> <b>hog</b> producers alleged that the Canadian stabilization program was an unfair production subsidy resulting in larger Canadian hog and pork exports that caused serious economic hardship for U. <b>S.</b> <b>hog</b> producers. The consequent trade actions against Canadian exports have entailed a countervailing duty on hog exports applied sporadically over the same time period. This paper provides a summary of the Canadian hog stabilization program and an overview of the economic and legal arguments made in the U.

40|$|Rapid {{change in}} the size and {{ownership}} structure of U. <b>S.</b> <b>hog</b> production has created new and varied challenges for the industry. This report describes an industry becoming increasingly concentrated among fewer and larger farms, and becoming more economically efficient. These changes have not come without problems. The increasing market control and power concentrated among packers and large hog operations, and the manure management problem posed by an increasing concentration of hog manure on fewer operations, are paramount concerns. Addressing these concerns through regulations would likely impose economic costs that could {{be passed on to}} consumers. In addition, the relative mobility of the hog industry means that regulations could result in significant changes in the location of hog production facilities, with ripple effects in local economies. Balancing environmental and economic interests will challenge policymakers dealing with the implications of structural change in U. <b>S.</b> <b>hog</b> production.

40|$|The U. <b>S</b> <b>hog</b> {{production}} {{industry has}} been continually subjected to rapid structural changes since the early 1990 s.

This study investigates the implications of state-level environmental regulations on the structure of hog farms. The {{results of this study suggest}} that environmental regulations will result in one of three possible scenarios: (1) a more competitive industry in which small hog operations are not adversely affected which will allow more small operations to enter rather than exit the industry; (2) a more concentrated hog production industry in which large operations survive while small operations exit the industry; (3) no change in the structure of the industry where both sizes of operations are not significantly affected by environmental stringency.

40|$|A {{countervailing duty}} (CVD) {{was placed on}} Canadian hog imports into the United States {{beginning}} in 1985. Not sur-prisingly, the CVD reduced Canadian hog prices relative to U. <b>S.</b> <b>hog</b> prices, but the relative impact varied geographically. The CVD created incentives for downstream sub-stitution of Canadian pork products. so relative hog prices were reduced more in Canadian provinces with limited processing capacity. Multivariate time series analysis, including an examination of short-run dynam-ics, reveals differential dynamic impacts of U. S. prices in Canadian sub-markets after introduction of the CVD. The National Pork Producers Council, an organization of U. <b>S.</b> <b>hog</b> producers and packers, filed a petition with the U. S.

40|$|The U. <b>S.</b> <b>hog</b> industry, once {{primarily}} made up {{of small}} owner-operated crop-hog farms, has become dominated by large specialized operations characterized by low costs and improved technologies in livestock management. Such changes have triggered concerns over the dangers large Hog Feeding Operations (HFOs) are likely to pose to the environment. In 2007, the top ten states {{accounted for more than}} 85 percent of total U. <b>S.</b> <b>hog</b> production (Iowa (IA), North Carolina (NC), Minnesota (MN), Illinois (IL), Nebraska (NE), Indiana (IN), Missouri (MO), Oklahoma (OK), Ohio (OH), and Kansas (KS)). With such domination on production, these states are often the subject of environmental debate relating to hog production. When farmers are required to incorporate environmental measures in hog production, their costs of production increase. Metcalfe (2001) found that small HFOs have found it difficult to cope with such costs and many have exited the industry, while large operations have not been affected at the same level. Due to the variation of environmental regulations among states, other operations moved to states with lax regulations (e. g. NC prior to the late 1990 s).
