25|$|On June 12, 1942, as {{district}} court judge Fee began presiding over the trial of Minoru Yasui, a native Oregonian of Japanese descent who was on trial for breaking curfew. The curfew had been imposed by the United States Army's General John L. DeWitt {{under the authority of}} President Franklin Roosevelt’s Executive Order 9066 that began the Japanese American internment after the bombing of Pearl Harbor. The curfew only applied to those of Japanese heritage, with Yasui being the first person to be arrested for violating the curfew. This case would <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> to the United States Supreme Court. The decision to take this trial to the Supreme Court made national news.|$|E
25|$|The Knicks {{were able}} to <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> to the NBA finals during the 1969-70 NBA playoffs thanks to the great play of both Walt Frazier and star {{teammate}} Willis Reed. However, in game 5, Reed got a horrific leg injury, making him unable to walk {{for the next few}} days. With Reed out, chances of the Knicks winning the championship were slim. However, Reed somehow returned to the series, playing the first two minutes of game seven and scores the first two points of the game. Reed was simply in too much pain to continue to play for the last 46 minutes of the game, meaning that it was up to Frazier to lead New York to the victory. Frazier scored 36 points, had 19 assists, 7 rebounds, and 6 steals that game. His astounding performance is arguably the greatest game in NBA playoff history, as it was the only reason why New York was able to defeat the Lakers and win the championship. ESPN {{is one of the many}} websites to call Frazier’s incredible game the greatest game 7 performance ever.|$|E
25|$|The Colts {{once again}} began the 1998–99 season with Bert Templeton behind the bench. Daniel Tkaczuk once again led his team {{on and off}} the ice, Michael Henrich and first-year player Denis Shvidki added some scoring punch. Midway through the season the Colts decided to make some moves and bring in players that would {{hopefully}} put them {{at the top of the}} league. In a trade with the Toronto St. Michael's Majors, the Colts' management brought in one of the league's top scorers in Sheldon Keefe, along with Mike Jefferson, and Ryan Barnes. After that, the Colts had a young group of players that could possibly <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> to the Memorial Cup finals. At the end of the year the Colts had a 49–12–6–1 record for 105 points, and possessed two of the top scorers in the league. After defeating the Kingston Frontenacs 4 games to 1 in the conference quarter-finals, the Colts lost in seven games to the fourth-place Oshawa Generals, who had finished the season twenty points behind the Colts. Barrie goalie Brian Finley won the OHL Goaltender of the Year award as well as the Wayne Gretzky 99 Award as playoff MVP, and high-scoring forward Sheldon Keefe won the Emms Family Award as rookie of the year.|$|E

Benioff concluded, [...] "If you're one of the lords of Westeros or one of her potential opponents in the wars to come and you get word of what happened here in Meereen, you have to be pretty nervous because this is an unprecedented threat. You've got a woman who has somehow formed an alliance where she has a Dothraki horde, a legion of Unsullied, she's got the mercenary army of the Second Sons, and she has three dragons who are now pretty close to full grown.

2500|$|South Florida has a {{tropical}} climate, {{the only major}} metropolitan area in the 48 contiguous states that falls under that category. More specifically, it generally has {{a tropical}} monsoon climate (Köppen climate classification, Am). The South Florida [...] metropolis sees most of its rain in the summer (wet season) and is quite dry in winter (dry season). The wet season, which is hot and humid, lasts from May to October, when daily thunderstorms and passing weak tropical lows bring downpours during the late afternoon. The dry season often starts in late October and runs through late April. During {{the height of the}} dry season from February through April, south Florida is often very dry, and often brush fires and water restrictions are an issue. At times cold fronts can <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> down to south Florida and provide some modest rainfall in the dry season. The hurricane season largely coincides with the wet season.|$|E
