25|$|In {{the case}} of an axially-symmetric magnet {{spinning}} at constant velocity, the distribution of the magnetic field intensity B of the magnet is constant with time, even after accounting for the relativistic corrections to B, and therefore by the Maxwell–Faraday equation the electric field induced by the rotation of the magnet is curl-free, which is caused purely by length contraction of the electric fields of its constituting subatomic particles. This means that in this particular example with a rotating magnetic disk and a stationary conducting disk, the induced electric field cannot be described by the Maxwell–Faraday equation, which describes the curl of the electric field induced by a changing <b>magnetic</b> <b>flux</b> <b>density.</b>|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{calculate}} the static eccentricity (SE) of a double rotor axial flux permanent magnet (AFPM) machine by using a general analytical model. The <b>flux</b> <b>density</b> in the air gap under healthy conditions is calculated firstly, where the axial and circumferential <b>magnetic</b> <b>flux</b> <b>densities</b> are obtained using a coupled solution of Maxwell’s equations and Schwarz-Christoffel (SC) mapping. The <b>magnetic</b> <b>flux</b> <b>densities</b> under SE conditions are calculated afterwards using a novel bilinear mapping. Some important electromagnetic parameters, e. g., back electromotive force (EMF), cogging torque and electromagnetic (EM) torque, are calculated for both SE and healthy conditions, and compared with the finite element (FE) model. As for the double rotor AFPM, SE does not contribute much effect on the back EMF and EM torque, while the cogging torque is increased. At each calculated section, FE models were built to validate the analytical model. The results show that the analytical predictions agree well with the FE results. Finally, the results of analytical model are verified via experimental results...|$|R
