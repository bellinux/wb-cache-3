30|$|The {{demand for}} large antennas in future space {{missions}} has increasingly stimulated {{the development of}} deployable <b>membrane</b> antenna <b>structures</b> owing to their light weight and small stowage volume. However, there is little literature providing a comprehensive review and comparison of different <b>membrane</b> antenna <b>structures.</b> Space-borne <b>membrane</b> antenna <b>structures</b> are mainly classified as either parabolic or planar <b>membrane</b> antenna <b>structures.</b> For parabolic <b>membrane</b> antenna <b>structures,</b> there are five deploying and forming methods, including inflation, inflation-rigidization, elastic ribs driven, Shape Memory Polymer (SMP)-inflation, and electrostatic forming. The development and detailed comparison of these five methods are presented. Then, properties of membrane materials (including polyester film and polyimide film) for parabolic membrane antennas are compared. Additionally, for planar <b>membrane</b> antenna <b>structures,</b> frame shapes have changed from circular to rectangular, and different tensioning systems have emerged successively, including single Miura–Natori, double, and multi-layer tensioning systems. Recent advances in structural configurations, tensioning system design, and dynamic analysis for planar <b>membrane</b> antenna <b>structures</b> are investigated. Finally, future trends for large space <b>membrane</b> antenna <b>structures</b> are pointed out and technical problems are proposed, including design and analysis of <b>membrane</b> <b>structures,</b> materials and processes, membrane packing, surface accuracy stability, and test and verification technology. Through a review of large deployable <b>membrane</b> antenna <b>structures,</b> guidance for space membrane-antenna research and applications is provided.|$|R
25|$|Milk {{often is}} homogenized, a {{treatment}} that prevents a cream layer from separating {{out of the}} milk. The milk is pumped at high pressures through very narrow tubes, breaking up the fat globules through turbulence and cavitation. A greater number of smaller particles possess more total surface area than {{a smaller number of}} larger ones, and the original fat globule membranes cannot completely cover them. Casein micelles are attracted to the newly exposed fat surfaces. Nearly one-third of the micelles in the milk end up participating in this new <b>membrane</b> <b>structure.</b> The casein weighs down the globules and interferes with the clustering that accelerated separation. The exposed fat globules are vulnerable to certain enzymes present in milk, which could break down the fats and produce rancid flavors. To prevent this, the enzymes are inactivated by pasteurizing the milk immediately before or during homogenization.|$|E
2500|$|This same lateral {{fluidity}} {{was first}} demonstrated conclusively {{on the cell}} surface by Frye and Edidin in 1970. They fused two cells labeled with different membrane-bound fluorescent tags {{and watched as the}} two dye populations mixed. The results of this experiment were key {{in the development of the}} [...] "fluid mosaic" [...] model of the cell membrane by Singer and Nicolson in 1972. According to this model, biological membranes are composed largely of bare lipid bilayer with proteins penetrating either half way or all the way through the membrane. These proteins are visualized as freely floating within a completely liquid bilayer. This was not the first proposal of a heterogeneous <b>membrane</b> <b>structure.</b> Indeed, as early as 1904 Nathansohn proposed a “mosaic” of water permeable and impermeable regions. But the fluid mosaic model was the first to correctly incorporate fluidity, membrane channels and multiple modes of protein/bilayer coupling into one theory.|$|E
2500|$|Chang's {{body of work}} in {{mammalian}} fertilisation is {{vast and}} appears in nearly 350 publications. [...] One of his major discoveries was the effect of lowering temperature on sperm. [...] Chang found that at a temperature of 13°C or lower, the <b>membrane</b> <b>structure</b> and function of sperm would disintegrate, thus destroying the fertilising capacity of the sperm. [...] This phenomenon is now commonly known as cold shock. [...] Yet another of Chang's major discoveries was his observation {{on the relationship between}} the number of available sperm and the effective fertilisation of ova by the sperm. [...] It was believed that the fertilisation of the egg was dependent on there being {{a very large number of}} available sperm in the fertilisation process. [...] Chang found that it was actually the physiological structure of the individual sperm that affected the actual fertilisation of the egg, and that having a large number of sperm was not necessary. [...] He then posited that the purpose of having a large number of sperm in the fertilisation process was to allow for greater genetic recombination, in that only the strongest sperm would reach the site of fertilisation through the female reproductive tract. [...] The process of capacitation, the maturation period of sperm that is required in order for them to be able to fertilise ova, was also amongst one of Chang's major discoveries. [...] This observation would lead him further to find that capacitated sperm would lose capacitation if exposed to seminal plasma or blood serum, and that recapacitation could be achieved if the sperm was placed back in the uterus or the fallopian tubes.|$|E

As the interfaces of intracellular systems, <b>membrane</b> <b>structures</b> maintain {{the integrity of}} organelles and serve as carriers of intracellular trafficking to contact different organelles. Therefore the cellular <b>membrane</b> <b>structures</b> are dynamic and closely interrelated. Recent studies have attempted to address how cells regulate membrane systems to transport materials and how these systems are exploited by invading pathogens (Behnia and Munro, 2005). As described above, each step of herpesvirus life cycle is associated with intracellular structures, in particular cellular membranes and the cytoskeleton. There {{are at least two}} budding and fusion events that take place at cellular <b>membrane</b> <b>structures</b> during herpesvirus assembly and egress. In this review, we will describe how herpesviruses exploit and remodel host <b>membrane</b> <b>structures</b> to assemble and escape from the host cell. We will mainly focus on alphaherpesviruses, in particular the human pathogen herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV- 1) and the porcine pathogen pseudorabies virus (PrV), which have been extensively studied and are relatively better understood. Comparison with betaherpesviruses and gammaherpesviruses on certain aspects of virion assembly and egress will also be presented.|$|R
40|$|Since the {{introduction}} of the contemporary tensile structures in the 1950 's, technological advances throughout the decades have lead to dramatic improvements over their early counterparts. <b>Membrane</b> <b>structures</b> are a class of tensile structure that require the entire surface to remain in tension and have opposing radii of curvature in order to maintain stability. Improved membrane strength and corrosion resistance in synthetic fabrics and films have allowed architects and engineers to create permanent and large-scale structures using this technology. However, the non-linearity, complexity in fabrication, and performance characteristics of membranes has limited their application. The affordability and speed of computing power in the 1990 's is changing the way <b>membrane</b> <b>structures</b> are designed and manufactured. The early <b>membrane</b> <b>structures</b> were designed using physical models to explore the curved surfaces inherent in <b>membrane</b> <b>structures.</b> Improved modeling capabilities on computers, along with information obtained from observations of existing membrane systems, are providing architects and engineers with the ability to explore efficient and innovative solutions...|$|R

Besides their low self-weight and high flexibility these structures are known to be 'optimally' constructed, as they are only loaded in tension. It results in shapes adapted to the flow of forces and a minimum of material needed to realise the span. Despite a considerable amount of scientific knowledge exists, only few design codes are available. A common standardised approach as well as a comprehensive European design standard is needed in order to provide verification techniques, a common pool of design approaches and to achieve a harmonized safety level. This background document consists of three major parts: (a) general explanations giving scientific and technical background for the design of <b>membrane</b> <b>structures,</b> (b) state-of-the-art overview on existing national and European rules and recommendations on the design of <b>membrane</b> <b>structures,</b> and (c) proposals for European harmonized design rules, which could be part of the future Eurocode for Tensile <b>Membrane</b> <b>Structures.</b> The final aim is to develop a Eurocode for the Structural Design of Tensile <b>Membrane</b> <b>Structures</b> which will help to design and implement these lightweight structures.

40|$|Most of the {{structural}} forms in which ETFE film is used are the cushion(pneumatic <b>membrane</b> <b>structures)</b> and tension type(tensile <b>membrane</b> <b>structures),</b> which have been generally accepted {{to be the most}} efficient forms. Tensile <b>membrane</b> <b>structures</b> are pulled outward from the exterior to introduce initial stress. And such structures offer the advantage of a natural shape formed by tensile stress and eliminate the need for blast air. Recently, the number of tension type structures is increasing. However, there are problems of creep and relaxation of ETFE films under long-term stresses. In this paper, the stretch fabrication method is proposed for stretching the film into the plastic region during initial tensioning as a way to increase its strength.

Dependence of the external load, prestress and curvature is discussed. It also presents three basic forms of prestressed membranes which are the basis of all other forms. The components and materials of prestressed <b>membrane</b> <b>structures</b> are discussed, with emphasis on the membranes. Manufacturing and mechanical and nonmechanical properties of different membranes are described. It also {{presents the}} methods for determining the mechanical characteristics of composite membranes. Uniaxial tensile testing of different composite membranes of manufacturers Verseidag and Ferrari was carried out (9 different membranes, three specimens in the warp and three in the weft direction for each) where stiffness, irreversible deformation and tensile strength are determined. Furthermore, three major phases {{in the design of}} prestressed <b>membrane</b> <b>structures</b> are discussed - formfinding, statical analysis and cutting pattern; methods and working of Easy software were presented simultaneously.
