25|$|Wii Menu: No {{matter when}} {{the menu is}} accessed, the Wii <b>Menu</b> <b>button</b> will always be present. Selecting this will exit a game or a Wii Menu channel and return the player to the Wii Menu, where users can choose another channel. When playing certain Virtual Console titles, with the {{exception}} of the Nintendo 64 and Neo Geo, this will also create a suspend point.|$|E
25|$|The Clip Sport was {{announced}} on February 10, 2014, with capacities of 4GB, 8GB. It {{is similar to}} previous Clip models, with a larger screen and longer battery life, but with no voice recorder. Later firmware uses the <b>menu</b> <b>button</b> for locking. A microSDHC card slot is provided to increase the storage capacity, {{but it does not}} support slotRadio. This is the first SanDisk mp3 player to not carry the Sansa name.|$|E

One needs only to triple-click the <b>Menu</b> <b>button</b> on the Siri Remote and the Apple TV will guide the user through the complete initial setup, a task that is non-trivial to the visually impaired in most comparable products on the market.|$|E
25|$|At first, Android {{did not use}} a gesture-based lock screen, electing to just {{require the}} user to press the phone's <b>Menu</b> <b>button.</b> On Android 2.0, a new gesture-based lock screen was introduced, {{displaying}} two icons: one for unlocking the phone, and one for setting the volume mode, activated by dragging the relevant icon {{to the center of}} the screen on a curve (similarly to a rotary dial). On Android 2.1, the rotary dial was replaced by two tabs on either end of the screen. Android 3.0 introduced a new design: a ball with a padlock icon is dragged to the outside of a circular area. On 4.0, the option to unlock straight to the camera is provided, while 4.1 adds the ability to unlock into a Google Search screen by dragging up. Android 4.2 makes additional changes to the lock screen, allowing users to add widgets to pages accessible on the lock screen by swiping from the left edge of the screen. The camera is accessed in a similar manner by swiping from the right edge of the screen. Android also allows devices to be locked using a password, passcode, a pattern on a grid of 9 circles, fingerprint sensing, or with facial recognition.|$|E
500|$|Upon its release, the Xbox One {{received}} favorable {{reviews from}} critics and reviewers. In its launch review, Polygon gave the Xbox One an 8/10. Its design {{was described as}} [...] "inoffensive" [...] but its larger size noted, while the console's quieter and cooler operation was praised for indicating a potentially higher reliability than Xbox 360 was on-launch. The controller was praised for its battery life and [...] "premium" [...] design, but {{some members of the}} site's staff felt that its shoulder buttons were stiffer than that of previous designs. The design of Xbox One's interface received mixed reviews: noting that it carried over Windows 8's design language, the interface was disfavored for hiding functions under the controller's <b>menu</b> <b>button</b> and for being awkward to use with a controller or motion gestures, seemingly encouraging users to use voice navigation instead. While praised for having more [...] "robust" [...] voice navigation than Xbox 360, they felt that voice navigation still had a [...] "learning curve in understanding what works and what doesn't." [...] Although its user following, Smart Match, and improved voice chat features were noted, Xbox Live was panned for not offering the option on-launch to add a real name to user profiles. Despite a regression in local and network multimedia functionality in comparison to Xbox 360 and how OneGuide interacted with outside set-top boxes (drawing comparisons to the operations of TiVo DVRs), Polygon felt the Xbox One's overall multimedia experience [...] "feels like a major step forward in set-top boxes and makes the Xbox One the obvious center of any living room that has one." ...|$|E

2500|$|Chromium 13.0 was {{released}} on 26 April 2011, with 13.0.748.0 as the initial version. Early versions of Chromium 13 included a <b>menu</b> <b>button</b> to enable users to switch between multiple Google profiles, multi-selection of tabs and an improved omnibox engine. This version also included several minor GUI changes, including a slightly lightened menu bar. By early May 2011 the results of Google's attempts to reduce the file size of Chromium were already being noted. Much of the early {{work in this area}} concentrated on shrinking the size of WebKit, by removing Wireless Markup Language (WML), the Image Resizer, datagrids and the Android build system. The largest Chromium nightly build was 35.3 MB on 15 April 2011, but this was reduced to 29.9 MB by 20 April 2011. Later builds of Chromium and Chrome in mid-May 2011 introduced the optional [...] "compact navigation view", aimed at mobile device users. This view combined the tab and URL/menu bars into one bar, by making the URL bar hide when not in use, thus saving 30 pixels of vertical space.|$|E

50|$|Newer DVD players (c. late 2010) have, however, been {{designed}} to override the aforementioned counter-countermeasures.

A separate <b>Menu</b> <b>button</b> was positioned below. The price was set at US$29.00.|$|E
40|$|Button {{bars are}} a {{relatively}} new interaction method intended to speed up application use as compared to pull-down menus. This exploratory study compares three command selection methods: pull-down <b>menus,</b> <b>button</b> bars, and user choice of pull-down <b>menus</b> or <b>button</b> bars. Effectiveness was measured in two ways: speed of selection and error rate. 15 participants performed 15 word processor related tasks. Results show that in frequently used functions, such as character attribute selection (bold, italic, u nderline, etc.), button bars are faster. There were {{no statistically significant differences}} in error rates between the three interaction methods. (Also cross-referenced as CAR-TR- 764...|$|R

5000|$|The pointer or {{mouse cursor}} echoes {{movements}} of the pointing device, commonly a mouse, touchpad or trackball.This kind of cursor is used to manipulate elements of graphical user interfaces such as <b>menus,</b> <b>buttons,</b> scrollbars or any other widget.

50|$|Some window {{managers}} {{display a}} small icon in the titlebar that may {{vary according to}} the application on which it appears.
