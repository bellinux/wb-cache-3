50|$|The Brazilian merganser (<b>Mergus</b> <b>octosetaceus)</b> is a duck in {{the typical}} merganser genus.It {{is one of the}} six most {{threatened}} waterfowl in the world with possibly fewer than 250 birds in the wild and currently 4 kept in captivity at 2 different Brazilian locations. The origin of its name is from its long, sharp-edged beak that has a great number of teeth-looking edges.|$|E

5000|$|... 346 {{bird species}} have been recorded, {{although}} some are dubious.Species include bare-faced curassow (Crax fasciolata), blue-winged macaw (Primolius maracana), blue-bellied parrot (Triclaria malachitacea), red-spectacled amazon (Amazona pretrei), purple-winged ground dove (Claravis geoffroyi), Temminck's seedeater (Sporophila falcirostris), Brazilian merganser (<b>Mergus</b> <b>octosetaceus),</b> grey-bellied hawk (Accipiter poliogaster), harpy eagle (Harpia harpyja) and canebrake groundcreeper (Clibanornis dendrocolaptoides).The park is an important site for conserving the black-fronted piping guan (Pipile jacutinga) in Argentina.|$|E
50|$|The food of this {{carnivore}} {{consists of}} mammals, toads, squamates {{and in particular}} {{a wide variety of}} birds. Among the latter, it is known to prefer tree-living species, such as oropendolas, aracaris, tanagers and cotingas. But ground- and waterbirds like tinamous, chachalacas, cormorants and the highly threatened Brazilian merganser (<b>Mergus</b> <b>octosetaceus)</b> have also been recorded as its prey. The black-and-white hawk-eagle has been known to attack small monkeys, though it is not clear with which intent. For as it seems, it has not been recorded to actually kill and eat a monkey.|$|E
40|$|Abstract This {{study shows}} that {{sampling}} maternal DNA from hatched and abandoned eggshells is a viable noninvasive strategy for studying the genetics of rare or endangered tropical birds, as exemplified here by the Brazilian Merganser (<b>Mergus</b> <b>octosetaceus).</b> Eighteen microsatellites were isolated from enriched libraries and nine heterologous loci from related species were tested. Seven loci were amplified successfully, with five of them being polymorphic. These loci exhibited amplicons ranging from 110 to 254 bp for 132 samples, with 60 from eggshells and 72 from blood or muscle samples. The number of alleles for M. octosetaceus ranged from one to six (mean = 3. 71), which is low compared to M. merganser (1 - 15 alleles), a ‘least concern’ species. Genetic diversity {{did not differ significantly}} between noninvasive and invasive samples (Z(u) = 0. 31, p = 0. 37). Thus, noninvasive sampling, as demonstrated here with eggshells, provides an efficient means to assess genetic diversity in tropical birds without the need to capture and handle them...|$|E
