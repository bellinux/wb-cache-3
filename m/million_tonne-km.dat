50|$|The Northwest Railroad concession, {{connecting}} Mexico City and Guadalajara {{with the}} Pacific port of Manzanillo and various crossings along the United States border {{was sold to}} {{a joint venture between}} Grupo Mexico and Union Pacific Railroad in 1998 during the presidency of Dr. Ernesto Zedillo (which later occupied the position of Director of the Board of Union Pacific). The company operates as Ferrocarril Mexicano or Ferromex. Ferromex's freight volumes have increased; it hauled a record 22,365 <b>million</b> <b>tonne-km</b> in the first 6 months of 2010. Also, Ferrosur, the railroad serving Mexico City and cities/ports southeast of Mexico City, hauled their own record 3,565 million tonne-kilometers.|$|E
40|$|Replacing a part {{of energy}} derived from fossil fuels with {{bioenergy}} derived from solid waste streams may be a promising method to tackle the dual crisis of increasing waste pile-up and global climate change. In this study we propose a decentralised sewage sludge and woody biomass co-gasification system for Singapore. We evaluate the greenhouse gas emission of the proposed system and {{compare it to the}} existing system through life cycle assessment. The proposed system is expected to provide a net annual emission reduction of 137. 0 – 164. 1 kilotonnes of CO 2 eq. Increase in electricity recovery, carbon sequestration in the biochar produced and the avoidance of the use of supplementary fuel for sewage sludge incineration are the major contributors for the emission reduction. The proposed system is able to increase the net electricity production from sewage sludge and woody biomass by 3 – 24 %. This could lead to an annual increase in electricity recovery of 12. 1 – 74. 8 GWh. It is estimated that the proposed system can produce 34 kilotonnes of biochar annually. It is found that decentralisation helps to reduce the annual tonne-km driven by 4. 23 <b>million</b> <b>tonne-km</b> which could decrease the number of on-road vehicles required for waste handling...|$|E
