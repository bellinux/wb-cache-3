40|$|We {{describe}} a combined use of experimental and simulation techniques to configure side chains in a coiled coil structure. As already demonstrated {{in a previous}} work, x-ray diffraction patterns from hard alpha-keratin fibers in the 5. 15 A <b>meridian</b> <b>zone</b> reflect the global configuration of the chi(1) dihedral angle of the coiled coil side chains. Molecular simulations, such as energy minimization and molecular dynamics, and rotameric representation in the PDB, are used here on a heterodimeric coiled coil to investigate the dihedral angle distribution along the sequence. Different procedures {{have been used to}} build the structure, the quality assessment was based on the agreement between the simulated diffraction patterns and the experimental ones in the fingerprint region of coiled coils (5. 15 A). The best one for building a realistic coiled coil structure consists of placing the side chains using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, followed by side chain positioning using SMD or SCWRL procedures. The side chains and the backbone are equilibrated during the MD until they reach an equilibrium state for the t/g(+) ratio. Positioning the side chains on the resulting backbone, using the above procedures, gives rise to a well-defined 5. 15 A meridian reflection...|$|E

50|$|The table {{shows the}} dates of {{adoption}} of time zones based on the Greenwich <b>meridian,</b> including half-hour <b>zones.</b>|$|R
50|$|Ideal time zones, such as {{nautical}} time zones, {{are based}} on the mean solar time of a particular meridian located {{in the middle of that}} zone with boundaries located 7.5 degrees east and west of the <b>meridian.</b> In practice, <b>zone</b> boundaries are often drawn much farther to the west with often irregular boundaries, and some locations base their time on meridians located far to the east.|$|R
50|$|Civil time is {{the local}} mean time for a {{meridian}} that often passes {{near the center of}} the time zone, and may possibly be further altered by daylight saving time. When the apparent solar time that corresponds to a given civil time is to be found, the difference in longitude between the site of interest and the time <b>zone</b> <b>meridian,</b> daylight saving time, and the equation of time must all be considered.|$|R
50|$|Standard time {{or civil}} {{time in a}} region {{deviates}} a fixed, round amount, usually a whole number of hours, from some form of Universal Time, now usually UTC. The offset is chosen such that a new day starts approximately while the sun is crossing the nadir <b>meridian.</b> See Time <b>zone.</b> Alternatively the difference is not really fixed, but it changes twice a year a round amount, usually one hour, see Daylight saving time.|$|R
50|$|Although Hawaii {{is further}} away from equator than Fiji, and {{therefore}} there is a slightly greater variation in the daylight length, Hawaii does not observe DST. Most of the inhabited islands are located close to {{the west end of}} the Hawaii-Aleutian time zone, and Oahu, Kauai and Niihau are located more than 7 degrees west of the Hawaii-Aleutian time <b>zone's</b> <b>meridian</b> and should, theoretically, be located in the next time zone to the west. Therefore advancing the clock in Hawaii would make sunrise times close to 7:00 a.m. even in June.|$|R
50|$|For civil purposes, {{a common}} clock time is {{typically}} defined {{for an entire}} region based on the local mean solar time at a central <b>meridian.</b> Such time <b>zones</b> began to be adopted about {{the middle of the}} 19th century when railroads with regularly occurring schedules came into use, with most major countries having adopted them by 1929. As of 2015, throughout the world, 40 such zones are now in use: the central zone, from which all others are defined as offsets, is known as UTC±00, which uses Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).|$|R
50|$|As the {{apparent}} daily {{movement of the}} Sun is one revolution per day, that is 360° every 24 hours, and the Sun itself appears as a disc of about 0.5° in the sky, simple sundials can be read to a maximum accuracy of about one minute. Since the equation of time has a range of about 33 minutes, the difference between sundial time and clock time cannot be ignored. In addition to the equation of time, one also has to apply corrections due to one's distance from the local time <b>zone</b> <b>meridian</b> and summer time, if any.|$|R
5000|$|Because of Hawaii's {{tropical}} latitude, {{there is}} not a large variation in daylight length between winter and summer. Advancing the clock in Hawaii would make sunrise times close to 7:00 a.m. even in June. Most of the inhabited islands are located close to the west end of the Hawaii-Aleutian time zone, but Oahu, Kauai, and Niihau are located more than 7 degrees west of the Hawaii-Aleutian time <b>zone's</b> <b>meridian</b> and should, theoretically, be located in the next time zone to the west. (Until about 1946 Hawaiian standard time was based on longitude 157.5 degrees west rather than 150 degrees.) ...|$|R
50|$|In the Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) system, grid {{reference}} {{is given by}} three numbers: zone, easting and northing. In the UTM system, the earth is divided into 60 zones. Northing values are given by the metres north, or south (in the southern hemisphere) of the equator. Easting values are established as {{the distance from the}} central <b>meridian</b> of a <b>zone.</b> The central <b>meridian</b> is arbitrarily set at 500,000 metres, to avoid negative numbers. A position 100 kilometres west of a central meridian would have an easting of 400,000 metres. Due to its popularity, and worldwide cover, the UTM system is used worldwide by NATO as well as many countries, including Australia and the USA.|$|R
5000|$|Daylight saving time (DST) is {{in effect}} {{in much of the}} Central time zone between mid-March and early November. The {{modified}} time is called Central Daylight Time (CDT) and is UTC−5. In Canada, Saskatchewan does not observe a time change. One reason that Saskatchewan does not take part in a time change is that, geographically, the entire province is closer to the Mountain Time <b>Zone's</b> <b>meridian.</b> The province elected to move onto [...] "permanent" [...] daylight saving by being part of the Central Time Zone. The only exception is the region immediately surrounding the Saskatchewan side of the biprovincial city of Lloydminster, which has chosen to use Mountain Time with DST, synchronizing its clocks with those of Alberta.|$|R
50|$|Standard {{time is the}} {{synchronization}} of clocks {{within a}} geographical area or region to a single time standard, rather than using solar time or a locally chosen meridian (longitude) to establish a local mean time standard. Historically, the concept was established during the 19th century to aid weather forecasting and train travel. Applied globally in the 20th century, the geographical areas became extended around evenly spaced <b>meridians</b> into time <b>zones</b> which (usually) centered on them. The standard time set in each time zone {{has come to be}} defined in terms of offsets from Universal Time. In regions where daylight saving time is used, that time is defined by another offset, from the standard time in its applicable time zones.|$|R
5000|$|A {{position}} on the Earth is given by the UTM zone number and the easting and northing planar coordinate pair in that zone. The point of origin of each UTM zone is {{the intersection of the}} equator and the <b>zone's</b> central <b>meridian.</b> To avoid dealing with negative numbers, the central <b>meridian</b> of each <b>zone</b> is defined to coincide with [...] meters East. In any zone a point that has an easting of [...] meters is about 100 km west of the central meridian. For most such points, the true distance would be slightly more than 100 km as measured {{on the surface of the}} Earth due to the distortion of the projection. UTM eastings range from about [...] meters to [...] meters at the equator.|$|R
40|$|The {{geographical}} {{center of}} one territorial unit is the location point which in theoretical sense is nearest to other points of that territorial unit. There are several methods {{for determining the}} geographical center. Those are 1) method of geographical coordinates of extreme border pont, 2) the method of brunt determinate 3) the method of isofrontiers, 4) the isofrontier-translations method (composite), 5) the method of grid, 6) the integral method of brunt determinate. The integral method of brunt determinate by computer program ArcView a method which provides very precise results was applied. The geographical center is an interesting and important place, which should be marked in an adequate manner. It would be, for example, useful to put the basic geographic orientation sign at a location. It is an object where the name of destination, its latitude (numerical value in degrees, minutes and seconds), longitude and altitude (in meters) and the data about straight liner distance to the destination in the Republic of Serbia (cities, mountains, monasteries, etc) and {{the other parts of}} the world (cities, mountains, and points of the main elements of the Earth - the Equator, the North Pole, the zero <b>meridian</b> and data <b>zone</b> border line) (in kilometers/miles) would be indicated. Geographical centers in Serbia are as follows: The geographical center of the Republic of Serbia is situated in Drača settlement, Kragujevac municipality. The center is located to the west of Kragujevac, about 8 km from the center of the city (rectilinear). The geographical center of Central Serbia is situated in Kaludra settlement Rekovac municipality. The center is located about 10 km to the south of Rekovac. The geographical center of the Autonomus Province of Voivodina is situated in Žabalj settlement, Žabalj municipality. The center is located about 12 km to the northeast of Novi Sad. The geographical center of the Autonomus Province of Kosovo and Metohia is situated in Komorane settlement Glogovac municipality. The center is located about 24 km to the southwest of Priština...|$|R
