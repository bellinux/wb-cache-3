40|$|In this paper, I {{investigate}} the optimal taxation {{of labor and}} capital {{as well as the}} political equilibrium when people are homogeneous and have a preference for fairness. Not surprisingly, the optimal taxation takes a variant Ramsey-Mirrlees formula. I then fully characterize the equilibrium fiscal policy and find conditions under which the <b>maximum</b> <b>capital</b> levy holds. In particular, I show that an additional concern for fairness may enforce or weaken the <b>maximum</b> <b>capital</b> levy result in an intuitive manner. For example, if the degree to which labor income is determined by stochastic shocks with respect to talent and effort is relatively larger than that of <b>capital</b> income, the <b>maximum</b> <b>capital</b> levy and hence no tax on labor is less plausible to obtain on equilibrium.
