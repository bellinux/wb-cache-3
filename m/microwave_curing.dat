Fly ash activated by 8 M NaOH solution at a liquid to solid ratio of 0. 3 was cured by thermal oven at 85 °C and domestic microwave oven, respectively. Apart from compressive strength test, the temperature profiles of AAFA samples were captured by thermal camera. Reaction products of AAFA were characterised with XRD, FTIR and TG/DTG, while the microstructure of AAFA was analysed by MIP and SEM. The {{results showed that}} with much shorter curing duration, the compressive strength of AAFA samples under <b>microwave</b> <b>curing</b> was comparable to those samples under thermal oven curing. The XRD results demonstrated that different reaction products were generated from thermal oven curing (hydroxysodalite) and <b>microwave</b> <b>curing</b> (chabazite-Na) respectively.

40|$|Microwave {{radiation}} at 2. 45 GHz with {{variable power}} input was investigated {{as a tool}} to facilitate the curing reaction of benzoxazine-epoxy-phenolic molding compound i. e., BEP 893. Dielectric filler for microwave coupling was silicon carbide whisker (SiCw).

The SiCw loading of 10 % by weight with the microwave irradiation condition of 300 W for 10 min renders the ultimate curing of the molding compound.

40|$|Abstract: This study {{investigates the}} effects of steam and <b>microwave</b> <b>curing</b> on the {{strength}} de-velopment and permeability of concrete. Two steam curing treatments, four <b>microwave</b> <b>curing</b> times and four types of concrete mix were used in this study.

40|$|Alkali-activated fly ash (AAFA) {{has been}} {{identified}} as a low-carbon alternative to Portland cement (PC). However, conventional thermal oven curing, typically at 85 oC, is commonly required to firstly initiate and then accelerate the chemical reaction, which may result in more energy consumption, offsetting the environmental benefits which could be obtained from AAFA. In this study, the potential of using microwave as an alternative low-energy thermal curing method for manufacturing AAFA has been explored. A <b>microwave</b> <b>curing</b> regime based on a control strategy using temperature feedback data was developed and evaluated in the manufacture of AAFA.

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} effect of <b>microwave</b> <b>curing</b> on the bond {{strength}} of steel reinforcement in concrete repair. Pull-out tests on plain mild steel reinforcement bars embedded in four repair materials in 100 mm cube specimens were performed to determine the interfacial bond strength. The porosity and pore structure of the matrix at the steel interface, which influence the bond strength, were also determined. Test results show that <b>microwave</b> <b>curing</b> significantly reduces the bond strength of plain steel reinforcement. The reduction relative to normally cured (20 °C, 60 % RH) specimens is between 21 and 40 % with low density repair materials and about 10 % for normal density cementitious mortars. The corresponding compressive strength of the matrix also recorded similar reduction and <b>microwave</b> <b>curing</b> resulted in increased porosity at the interface transition zone of the steel reinforcement. A unique relationship exists between bond strength and both compressive strength and porosity of all matrix materials. <b>Microwave</b> <b>curing</b> reduced shrinkage but despite the wide variation in the shrinkage of the repair mortars, {{its effect on the}} bond strength was small. The paper provides clear correlations between the three parameters (compressive strength, bond strength and porosity), which are common to both the microwave and conventionally cured mortars. Therefore, bond-compressive strength relationships used in the design of reinforced concrete structures will be also valid for microwave cured elements...|$|E

The repairs were applied at different ambient temperatures of 20, 10, 2 and − 5 °C. Tensile split tests on repaired cube specimens were performed to determine the interfacial bond strength. The ability of <b>microwave</b> <b>curing</b> to prevent the detrimental effects of freezing at early age on the bond and compressive strength of repair patches is investigated. Experimental results show that <b>microwave</b> <b>curing</b> prevents loss of long term (28 day) repair/substrate bond strength of repair materials applied at freezing temperatures (− 5 °C), relative to the repairs applied at higher temperatures (2 – 20 °C), except one lightweight repair formulation.

The objective {{of this paper is to}} investigate the effect of the <b>microwave</b> <b>curing</b> of epoxies using an Infra-red thermometer as a means of controlling the temperature of the samples during the time when they are subjected to microwave radiation. A precise temperature control strategy is important, as inaccuracy often leads to uncontrolled thermal run-away resulting in the destruction of the material. The proposed control system incorporates a temperature feedback control mechanism to control the temperature and the exposure time of adhesive joints during microwave radiation. Microwave energy at a frequency of 2. 45 GHz was used to cure various engineering thermoplastics bonded together using two-part epoxies.
