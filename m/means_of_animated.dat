40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the design and}} results of a statistical and visual analysis of a dynamic signed network. In addition to prevalent approaches to longitudinal networks, which analyze series of cross-sectional data, this paper focuses on network data measured in continuous {{time in order to}} explain the signs of lines rather than their occurrence. As a consequence, current stochastic actor-oriented models for network change cannot be applied. Instead, multilevel logistic regression analysis is used for uncovering the main statistical regularities of network evolution. Visualization by <b>means</b> <b>of</b> <b>animated</b> Scalable Vector Graphics with several options for interaction allows for in-depth inspection of network evolution and offers detailed information on the people involved in the network. The substantive focus of the paper is on the evaluations and complex labeling process among literary authors and critics illustrating the interplay between identity (literary style) and structure. It is hypothesized that actors do not just evaluate their immediate ego-network; they also try to survey and interpret the overall structure of the network and derive part of their identity from it. The latter, however, is a collective process involving communication, e. g., publicly labeling groups of actors in the network and adapting behavior to labels that have previously been assigned to actors. Including perceptions of overall network structure and classifications in dynamic network models would extend current actor-oriented models...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we present GRACE (graphical {{representation}} and animation for cryptography education), a Java-based educational tool {{that can be}} used to help in teaching and understanding of cryptographic protocols. The tool adopts an active learning model that engages the learner by asking him to describe, in an exemplification of a real-world scenario, cryptographic protocols using simple primitives whose effects are visualized by <b>means</b> <b>of</b> <b>animated</b> sequences. To this end, the GRACE interface offers the learner the choice of several cryptographic and non-cryptographic related operations with their respective visualizations. By executing a series of these operations in the proper order, a teacher is able to provide a visual introductory description of several protocols. Moreover, since some of the cryptographic operations are not just simulated but concretely implemented, it can be used by students to see which elaborations are performed by each operation of a cryptographic protocol, and their effects on the represented scenario. GRACE comes equipped with the implementation of several cryptographic primitives and cryptosystems. Additional primitives and cryptosystems can easily be plugged in the system. Visualizations prepared with GRACE can be edited, navigated and saved in a file for playback. We also present the results of an experimental lesson taught in the Security on Communication Networks undergraduate course at the University of Salerno during the fall 2004 semester using GRACE. A copy of GRACE and some demo lessons featuring the visualization of some cryptographic protocols are available at [URL]...|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} a novel {{semantics}} for an essential aspect of service-oriented computing: the mechanism through which systems evolve through a symbiosis of state transformations and run-time service discovery and binding. The semantics {{is based on a}} new notion of temporal symbolic graph-transformation systems: in temporal symbolic graphs, interfaces can be specified using temporal logic, and service-level agreements can be specified in that logic's propositional fragment. An important advantage of our framework is that it can be supported by tools that implement temporal symbolic graph transformations, which would also provide a <b>means</b> <b>of</b> <b>animating</b> service-oriented systems evolution. We illustrate our semantics with a simple trip-booking service. Preprin...|$|R
5000|$|This kind of {{scrolling}} is called, [...] "coarse scrolling". It {{is achieved}} by moving bytes of memory through a designated screen display area. Moving a kilobyte (or more) of memory is CPU intensive and slower computers {{may not be able}} to accomplish anything else while updating screen data. As a <b>means</b> <b>of</b> <b>animating</b> a display the results can be jerky when the CPU cannot update the screen memory faster than the display hardware reads the memory to generate the video output. Motion fluidity is impaired, since the minimum amount of shifting the display is the size of an entire character. Most computers including the Atari 8-bits accomplish coarse scrolling as described above — common examples are viewing a long BASIC program listing or directory of files.|$|R
2500|$|Catholic spirituality {{includes}} {{the various ways}} in which Catholics live out their Baptismal promise, through prayer and action. The primary prayer of all Catholics is the Eucharistic liturgy in which they celebrate and share their faith together, in accord with Jesus' instruction: [...] "Do this in memory of me." [...] The Catholic bishops at the Second Vatican Council decreed that [...] "devotions should be so drawn up that they harmonize with the liturgical seasons, accord with the sacred liturgy, are in some fashion derived from it, and lead the people to it, since, in fact, the liturgy {{by its very nature}} far surpasses any of them." [...] In accord with this, many additional forms of prayer have developed over the centuries as <b>means</b> <b>of</b> <b>animating</b> one's personal Christian life, at times in gatherings with others. Each of the religious orders and congregations of the Catholic church, as well as lay groupings, has specifics to its own spirituality – its way of approaching God in prayer to foster its way of living out the Gospel.|$|R
40|$|The {{research}} {{explores the}} field of Animation and aims to connect it to the Visual Communication Design’s one, in order to depict the recent contact between the two disciplines due {{to the spread of}} digital media and tools. At first the research presents an interdisciplinary vision of the subject based upon a collection of studies rising from Neuroscience, Psychology, Semiotics and Theory of Cinema. Secondly, the work proceeds by analyzing the methods and the processes of animation-making and it focuses on the interdependences between the techniques employed and the resulting visual language; this part also underlines the digital shift’s consequences occurred to the medium. Given the theoretical-operational framework of the subject, the thesis analyzes the factors that leads the two practices to converge: here, in what we call ‘the animated product’, the overlap between new <b>means</b> <b>of</b> <b>animating</b> and new tools for the communication designers’ becomes clearer. The research completes outlining a specific approach to the moving image domain: by applying the paradigms of visual design, it is possible to draw a conceptual map that emphasizes the ‘functional’ aspects <b>of</b> the various <b>animated</b> formats. Further, this approach leads to the invention of a working visual-database for storing and evaluating the massive material today available: the prototype summarizes many key-aspects discussed across the research and it defines the first stage toward a ‘grammar’ <b>of</b> the <b>animated</b> languages...|$|R
40|$|My {{research}} {{provides a}} <b>means</b> <b>of</b> <b>animating</b> historical costume, bringing movement and narrative to an otherwise static garment form.

In consultation with the Museum of London I produced a 40 -second animation of an 18 th Century, Spitalfields silk, sack-back style dress, based on a real garment in the Museum’s collection. The resulting animation was exhibited with the original dress, Museum of London, February-March 2004. In order to realise this piece, I achieved: successful collision detection of multiple ‘cloth’/undergarment layers linked to digitised body movement; generation of a ‘believable’ CG silk ‘cloth’ aesthetic using 2 D/ 3 D texture mapping procedures; unedited motion capture linked to the complex garment model (40 secs); improved digital cloth, weight and movement dynamics...|$|R

40|$|Background: MRI scans can be {{distressing}} {{for children}} and often require sedation. Educating children about what to expect reduces anxiety and increases likelihood of successful non-sedated MRI scans. Multimedia tools are a popular <b>means</b> <b>of</b> education. <b>Animated</b> video could provide a free, accessible method of preparing children for MRI scans. Objective: To evaluate a new animation video for preparing children for MRI, specifically for decreasing in-scanner motion and examination failure. Materials and methods: We recruited 24 healthy children ages 5 – 11 years. Participants underwent pre- and post-viewing questionnaires and structured interviews. We then compared median Likert scale score changes between pre- and post-animation questions and analyzed the interview framework. Participants were filmed viewing the animation to calculate time spent looking at the screen to assess how well the video retained children’s attention. Results: There were significant improvements in median scores regarding what to expect, checking for metal and keeping still. There were no significant changes in other knowledge-based topics. There were significant improvements in median scores for anxiety-based topics. On average, children watched the screen for 98. 9...|$|R

Product of his environment, he ceases to exist after he loses his car, which symbolizes his way of life and his existence. La genese de Carlos et de sa Cosworth precedes the creative writing part and shows the evolution of the novel. Todorov recognizes two kinds of stories: based on plot or on the character. The critical study explains why La Cosworth is a character novel. It covers the genesis and changes of the characters. It explains the importance of the automobile in the story and the use of music as a <b>means</b> <b>of</b> framing and <b>animating</b> the narration.
