When the multi-disk clutch is in {{disengaged}} operation, {{friction plates}} and <b>mating</b> <b>plates</b> may not separate absolutely, {{in order to}} avoid the slipping friction and reduce the clutch’s overheating, the lubricant pressure between the plates should distribute equably in design. Based on the fluid dynamic theory, the 3 -D fluid models of oil way with different diameters of squirt hole are established, with which the fluid field at different velocities and temperatures of lubricant can be analyzed. The distribution of lubricant pressure in the clearance of plates influenced by the diameter of squirt hole, inlet velocity and lubricant temperature can be studied. The result of the study shows that the bigger the squirt hole, the smaller the inlet flow and the lower the temperature is, the more uniform the lubricant pressure distributes...|$|E

40|$|Referred {{to as the}} "lifeline for any space launch vehicle" by NASA Space Launch Initiative Program Manager Warren Wiley, an {{umbilical}} is a {{large device}} that transports power, communications, instrument readings, and fluids such as propellants, pressurization gases, and coolants from one source to another. Numerous launch vehicles, planetary systems, and rovers require umbilical "mating". This process is a driving factor for dependable and affordable space access. With future-generation space vehicles in mind, NASA recently designed a smart, automated method for quickly and reliably mating and demating electrical and fluid umbilical connectors. The new umbilical concept is expected to replace NASA s traditional umbilical systems that release at vehicle lift-off (T- 0). The idea is to increase safety by automatically performing hazardous tasks, thus reducing potential failure modes and the time and labor hours necessary to prepare for launch. The new system will {{also be used as}} a test bed for quick disconnect development and for advance control and leak detection. It incorporates concepts such as a secondary <b>mate</b> <b>plate,</b> robotic machine vision, and compliant motor motion control, and is destined to advance usage of automated umbilicals in a variety of aerospace and commercial applications...|$|R
40|$|A {{total of}} 68 gram-negative {{freshwater}} bacterial isolates were screened {{for their ability}} to receive and express plasmids from Pseudomonas aeruginosa donors. The <b>plate</b> <b>mating</b> technique identified 26 of the isolates as recipient active for the self-transmissible wide-host-range plasmid R 68; 10 were recipient active by R 68 mobilization for the wide-host-range plasmid cloning vector R 1162. Frequencies of transfer were compared by using three conjugal transfer procedures: broth, <b>plate,</b> and filter <b>mating.</b> For every recipient tested, a solid environment was superior to a liquid environment for transfer. The broth mating technique failed to demonstrate R 68 transfer in 63 % of the recipient-active isolates. Filter mating, in general, yielded the highest transfer frequencies.

5000|$|An {{electromagnetic}} lock, magnetic lock, or maglock is a {{locking device}} {{that consists of}} an electromagnet and an armature plate. There are two main types of electric locking devices. Locking devices can be either [...] "fail safe" [...] or [...] "fail secure". A fail-secure locking device remains locked when power is lost. Fail-safe locking devices are unlocked when de-energized. Direct pull electromagnetic locks are inherently fail-safe. Typically the electromagnet portion of the lock {{is attached to the}} door frame and a <b>mating</b> armature <b>plate</b> is attached to the door. The two components are in contact when the door is closed. When the electromagnet is energized, a current passing through the electromagnet creates a magnetic flux that causes the armature plate to attract to the electromagnet, creating a locking action. Because the mating area of the electromagnet and armature is relatively large, the force created by the magnetic flux is strong enough to keep the door locked even under stress.|$|R

Their comparatively small size, monomeric behavior, high stability, high solubility, and ability to bind epitopes inaccessible to conventional antibodies make them especially suitable for many therapeutic and biotechnological applications. In this paper, for the first time, we created the immunized Camelus Bactrianus VHH yeast two-hybrid (Y 2 H) library according to the Clontech <b>Mate</b> & <b>Plate</b> library construction system. The transformation efficiency and titer of the VHH Y 2 H library were 7. 26 × 10 (6) cfu/ 3 µg and 2 × 10 (9) cfu/ml, which met the demand for Y 2 H library screening. Using as an example the porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV 2) Cap protein as bait, we screened 21 positive Cap-specific VHH sequences. Among these sequences, 7 of 9 randomly selected clones were strongly positive as indicated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, either using PCV 2 viral lysis or purified Cap protein as coated antigen. Additionally, the immunocytochemistry results further indicated that the screened VHHs could specifically detected PCV 2 in the infected cells.

40|$|The smut fungus, Usti/ago maydis is an obligate {{parasite}} on maize plants {{in order to}} complete its sexual life cycle. The haploid form is self-sterile but compatible mated cells undergo a dimorphic switch from yeast like to infectious dikaryotic filaments. Mating types are determined by two unlinked loci, the a locus and the b locus. The a locus is involved in self and non-self cell recognition through production and sensing of pheromone. The b locus of compatible mating types encodes a functional transcription factor that is involved in regulation of expression of genes responsible for filamentation, virulence and pathogenicity. Both loci co-ordinate through a conserved mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway for mating and the protein kinase A (PKA) pathway in response to environmental conditions. If genes contributing to these signaling pathways are altered, some associated phenotypes appear to be either mating type or mating locus specific. Mating locus specific effects were evident in mutants of the p 21 -activated kinase (PAK), Smu 1. Data from charcoal <b>plate</b> <b>mating</b> assays, plant infections and colony morphology in an ammonium deficient environment supports involvement of b locus with function of smu 1. Phenotypes associated with mutants of another PAK like kinase, Cla 4 and over-expression of a vital small GTPase, Rh 01, are dependent upon genetic background of the strain, but independent of the mating loci, as evident from charcoal <b>plate</b> <b>mating</b> assay. In addition, for c/a 4 mutants, cell morphology on rich media and colony morphology under low nitrogen condition were also studied and used to hypothesize that even in haploid cells, homeodomain proteins encoded by the b locus may act as a functional transcription factor that interacts with certain components of signaling pathways so as to control various aspects of cell morphology and mating behavior...|$|R

R 68 and R 91 - 5 have both been shown to mobilize the chromosome with a polarity opposite to that by FP 2 - 2. The locations of the transfer origins of these plasmids are such that it has not been possible to demonstrate chromosomal circularity by means of interrupted mating experiments.

40|$|In the plant, {{filamentous}} {{growth is}} required for pathogenicity of the corn smut pathogen Ustilago maydis. Earlier, we identified a role for the cAMP signal transduction pathway in the switch between budding and filamentous growth for this fungus. A gene designated ubc 1 (for Ustilago bypass of cyclase) {{was found to be}} required for filamentous growth and to encode the regulatory subunit of a cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA). Here, we show that ubc 1 is important for the virulence of the pathogen. Specifically, ubc 1 mutants are able to colonize maize plants and, like the wild-type pathogen, cause localized symptoms in association with the presence of hyphae. However, in contrast to plants infected with wild-type cells that often developed galls from initially chlorotic tissue, plants infected with the ubc 1 mutant did not produce galls. These data suggest that PKA regulation is critical for the transition from saprophytic to pathogenic growth and from vegetative to reproductive development. <b>Plate</b> <b>mating</b> assays in which exogenous cAMP was applied suggested that the cAMP and b mating-type morphogenetic pathways may be coordinated...|$|R

40|$|Matings {{of genetically}} marked {{derivatives}} of Mycoplasma pulmonis {{resulted in the}} exchange of chromosomal DNA {{and the appearance of}} doubly marked transconjugants. Transposons Tn 916 and Tn 4001, and a series of integrative plasmids derived from their cloned antibiotic resistance genes, were used to construct antibiotic-resistant mycoplasmal derivatives to examine this phenomenon at the molecular level. Genetic exchange occurred on agar surfaces at frequencies ranging from 3. 3 X 10 (- 4) to 6. 4 X 10 (- 8) transconjugants per CFU. Examination of chromosomal DNA from transconjugants by hybridization revealed that the transposons or integrated plasmids were in the same chromosomal locations as in the parental strains, indicating that exchange involved the transfer of chromosomal DNA and homologous recombination. Transfer was not affected by DNase, polyethylene glycol, EDTA, or calcium chloride but was affected by treatment of either parent with trypsin. Mixing of <b>mating</b> strains before <b>plating</b> had no effect on mating frequencies, but mating did occur in liquid media. The ability to exchange chromosomal markers was limited to selected strains of M. pulmonis; mating did not occur with Acholeplasma laidlawii or M. gallisepticum.

40|$|Integrative and conjugative {{elements}} (ICEs), {{which are}} chromosomal mobile elements, can conjugatively transfer between bacteria. Recently, we identified a genomic island of Proteus mirabilis, a common agent of catheter-associated {{urinary tract infection}} (UTI), that possesses all the properties consistent with an ICE. This element, designated ICEPm 1, is highly conserved in other causative agents of UTI, suggesting its mobility. We demonstrate that ICEPm 1 can actively excise from the chromosome in a clonal population of bacteria and that this excision is integrase dependent. Although in P. mirabilis HI 4320, ICEPm 1 is annotated as integrated into the phenylalanine tRNA gene pheV, we show that ICEPm 1 can integrate into either pheV or pheU. We determined that ICEPm 1 transfers at a frequency of 1. 35 × 10 − 5 transconjugants/donor to ICEPm 1 -deficient P. mirabilis using <b>plate</b> <b>mating</b> assays with clinical isolates. Insertional inactivation of a putative integrase gene on ICEPm 1 decreased transfer frequencies of ICEPm 1 to below the limit of detection. Mutation of the relaxase of ICEPm 1 also eliminates transfer and demonstrates that this element is indeed self-transmissible and not transferred in trans, as are some mobilizable genomic islands. Together, these findings clearly demonstrate that ICEPm 1 can actively excise from the chromosome in an integrase-dependent manner, dynamically integrate into both phenylalanine tRNA genes, and transfer into clinical strains using its own conjugation machinery...|$|R

40|$|Melinda K. DuncanProx 1 is a {{homeodomain}} {{transcription factor}} {{that is important}} for controlling lens, liver, pancreatic, and lymphatic system development. Prox 1 has also been implicated in the regulation of tumor suppressor genes and the onset of cancer. Despite this wide variety of functions, it is currently unknown as to how Prox 1 is modulated during its role in vertebrate development. Previously, Arid 2 (also called BAF 200 and zipzap) was isolated from a yeast-two-hybrid assay as a potential Prox 1 interacting protein. Arid 2 belongs to the ARID family of proteins that are important for cell development, gene expression, and cell growth regulation. It is also a vital component of SWI/SNF complexes that function in chromatin remodeling. This work seeks {{to test the hypothesis}} that Prox 1 and Arid 2 actually interact and to determine the biological relevance of this interaction. First, a GAL 4 yeast two-hybrid assay was used to confirm the protein interaction by the activation of reporter genes that are transcribed if the two proteins are able to bind. The plasmids Prox 1 -pGBKT 7 and Arid 2 -pACT 2, the yeast two-hybrid shuttle vectors, were transformed into two different yeast strains of two different mating types. These were <b>mated</b> and <b>plated</b> on selectable media lacking nutrients that the reporter genes are responsible for making. Yeast colonies did grow on selectable media, suggesting that Prox 1 and Arid 2 do interact. Furthermore, fluorescent immunohistochemical analysis was performed on four-week C 57 BL/ 6 HAR mouse lens, which showed that Arid 2 and Prox 1 colocalize in the mouse lens fiber cells. After preliminary transfection analyses using the CAT reporter gene, {{it has been shown that}} Arid 2 does not significantly affect Prox 1 - mediated activation of the ??B 1 -crystallin promoter. These findings suggest that although Arid 2 is able to bind Prox 1, the functional consequences of this interaction may be difficult to decipher.

Genes on this plasmid encode mercury resistance and partial 2, 4 -dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2, 4 -D) degradation. The E. coli donor lacks the chromosomal genes necessary for mineralization of 2, 4 -D, and this fact allows presumptive transconjugants obtained in {{gene transfer}} studies {{to be selected}} by plating on media containing 2, 4 -D as the carbon source. Use of this donor counterselection approach enabled detection of plasmid pJP 4 transfer to indigenous populations in soils and under conditions where it had previously not been detected. In Madera Canyon soil, the sizes of the populations of presumptive indigenous transconjugants were 107 and 108 transconjugants g of dry soil− 1 for samples supplemented with 500 and 1, 000 μg of 2, 4 -D g of dry soil− 1, respectively. Enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus PCR analysis of transconjugants resulted in diverse molecular fingerprints.

No mercury-resistant, 2, 4 -D-degrading microorganisms containing large plasmids or the tfdB gene were found in 2, 4 -D-amended uninoculated control microcosms. Thus, all of the 2, 4 -D-degrading isolates that contained a plasmid whose size was similar to the size of pJP 4, contained the tfdB gene, and exhibited mercury resistance were considered transconjugants.

Two consecutive singles would score two further runs, then with runners at the corners, Harry Davis hit a 2-1 pitch into right-center to make it 10-1. Continuing the rally, Jack Barry hit a ground rule double into the right field crowd scoring another run and putting runners at second and third, which finally convinced John McGraw to replace his pitcher, Hooks Wiltse, having given up 7 earned runs over 2 1/3 innings.

Divided into three sections, this research showed that use of microbial inocula harboring self-transmissible plasmids holds promise as an applicable bioremediation approach. In the first study, a pJP 4 donor that could readily be counter-selected {{due to a lack of}} chromosomal genes necessary for 2, 4 -dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2, 4 -D) mineralization was generated to allow detection of transconjugants in soil. Plasmid pJP 4 was introduced into Escherichia coli (ATCC 15224), via <b>plate</b> <b>mating</b> with Ralstonia eutropha JMP 134 to create such a donor (E. coli D 11). Transfer of Plasmid pJP 4 to diverse indigenous populations was detected in soils, and under conditions, where it had not been observed previously. Plexiglass columns were used in the second study to evaluate dissemination of plasmid pJP 4 under unsaturated or saturated flow conditions in a 2, 4 -D contaminated soil. In unsaturated soil, pJP 4 was detected in both culturable donor and transconjugant cells extending to 10. 5 cm from the inoculated layer. In soil subjected to saturated flow conditions, no transconjugants were detected; however, donors were found throughout the entire length of the column (30. 5 cm). Thus, donor transport in conjunction with plasmid transfer to indigenous recipients allowed for significant dissemination of introduced genes through contaminated soil. The last study was conducted using soil contaminated with 2, 4 -D alone or co-contaminated with 2, 4 -D and cadmium (Cd). This study assessed the impact of introduction of the pJP 4 genes via cell bioaugmentation (R. eutropha JMP 134 donor), or via gene augmentation (E. coli D 11 donor). Both introduced donors remained culturable and transferred plasmid pJP 4 to diverse indigenous recipients. Cell bioaugmentation resulted in the most rapid 2, 4 -D degradation; however, upon a second exposure to 2, 4 -D, gene augmentation of indigenous populations was more successful. The presence of Cd (100 μg g dry soil⁻¹) had a minimal impact on 2, 4 -D degradation and transconjugant formation. The establishment of an array of stable indigenous plasmid hosts may be particularly useful in sites with potential for re-exposure or extensive, and thus, long term contamination...|$|R
