40|$|<b>Mercenaries</b> are {{the target}} of moral {{condemnation}} far more often than they are subject of moral concern. One attempt at morally condemning <b>mercenaries</b> proceeds by analogy with prostitutes; <b>mercenaries</b> are ?the whores of war?. This analogy is unconvincing {{as a way of}} condemning <b>mercenaries.</b> However, careful comparison of mercenarism and prostitution suggests that, like many prostitutes, some <b>mercenaries</b> may be vulnerable individuals. If apt, this comparison imposes a consistency requirement: if one thinks certain prostitutes are appropriate subjects of moral concern in light of their vulnerability, then one must think that <b>mercenaries</b> who are likewise vulnerable are also appropriate subjects of moral concern. In this paper I elucidate the relevant, morally significant sense of ?vulnerability?, and present evidence suggesting that at least some <b>mercenaries</b> are vulnerable in this sens...|$|R

The exact amount owed the <b>mercenaries</b> can only be guessed, but given the back pay, ration money and any other rewards promised, it probably was a substantial amount, which the <b>mercenaries</b> inflated after they reached Sicca. When Hanno refused their demands, as Carthage actually hoped to reduce the payment amount, and <b>mercenaries</b> were unsympathetic about the financial difficulties of Carthage, the negotiations broke down and the <b>mercenaries</b> seized Tunis.
