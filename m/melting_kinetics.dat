40|$|This project assesses {{two aspects}} of DNA {{detection}} of Phytophthora species from soil samples. Firstly, a nested PCR protocol was established with both primary and nested PCR specific for P. cinnamomi detection. PCR amplification of P. cinnamomi DNA isolated from soil was optimised {{with the addition of}} bovine serum albumin and formamide. This was found to improve both the specificity and sensitivity of PCR amplification of DNA in the presence of inhibitors co-extracted along with the target DNA from soil samples. The application of diagnostic nested PCR with the addition of BSA and formamide was verified by comparison with routine culture based detection methods. In all cases, nested PCR detection incorporating BSA and formamide was found to be considerably more sensitive than the culture based detection methods. The second component of this thesis investigates the simultaneous detection of multiple species of Phytophthora using microarray analysis.

This could be explained as a changing concentration distribution of the reactive groups in the solid state on SSP. The kinetics of the SSP had more than one region, and the rate of reaction for conversions of over 30 % could be expressed as - dc/dt = k(c/t), where k is a dimensionless constant independent of temperature with a value of 0. 28.

The kinetics of transient non-equilibrium phase transition mechanisms is addressed with a Molecular Dynamics method at atomic level, whereas the laser light absorption, strong generated electron-phonon non-equilibrium, fast diffusion and heat conduction due to photo-excited free carriers are accounted for in the continuum. We give {{a detailed description of}} the model, which is then applied to study the mechanism of short laser pulse melting of free standing Si films. The effect of laser-induced pressure and temperature of the lattice on the <b>melting</b> <b>kinetics</b> is investigated. Two competing melting mechanisms, heterogeneous and homogeneous, were identified. Apart of classical heterogeneous melting mechanism, the nucleation of the liquid phase homogeneously inside the material significantly contributes to the melting process. The simulations showed, that due to the open diamond structure of the crystal, the laser-generated internal compressive stresses reduce the crystal stability against the homogeneous melting. Consequently, the latter can take a massive character within several picoseconds upon the laser heating. Due to negative volume of melting of modeled Si material, - 7. 5 %, the material contracts upon the phase transition, relaxes the compressive stresses and the subsequent melting proceeds heterogeneously until the excess of thermal energy is consumed. The threshold fluence value, at which homogeneous nucleation of liquid starts contributing to the classical heterogeneous propagation of the solid-liquid interface, is found from the series of simulations at different laser input fluences.

In one mechanism, highly ordered crystallites form directly from the fluid phase, as in classical nucleation theory. In the other, a meta- or unstable amorphous cluster is first formed, after which the crystallite nucleates from within. These results are likely to be generally applicable to systems with short-range centro-symmetric attractive interactions.

The transformation was resulted from the loop rearrangement. After screening of a library of diverse G-quadruplex, a sequence exhibiting the best transformation property was found. A pH-driven nanoswitch with three gears was obtained based on this transition cycle. Conclusions Certain G-quadruplex was found to go through conformational change at low pH. Loop was the decisive factor controlling the interconversion upon pH variation. G-Quadruplex with TT central loop could be converted in a much milder condition than the one with TTA loop. It can be used to design pH-driven nanodevices such as a nanoswitch. General significance These results provide more insights into G-quadruplex polymorphism, and also contribute to the design of DNA-based nanomachines and logic gates.

This article provides experimental and 3 D-finite element tools capable of reproducing the major phenomena that occur during an electrofusion process. A specific version of the 3 D- finite element model simulation software Forge® has been developed {{to take into account}} the fitting parameters such as polyethylene thermal properties (i. e., <b>melting</b> and crystallization <b>kinetics,</b> phase transition, and thermal contact resistance) and the electrical and geometrical settings (i. e., welding input parameters). From a numerical point of view, a well refined highly anisotropic mesh adaptation is applied to well capture the contact condition between the heat source and the polyethylene. The computed results (temperature, melted, and cold areas) were compared with experimental data and gave very good agreement in terms of temperature and liquid phase fraction distribution...|$|R
