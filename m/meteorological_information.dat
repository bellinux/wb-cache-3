500|$|SPC {{mesoscale}} discussions (MDs) once covered convection (mesoscale convective discussions [...] ) and precipitation (mesoscale precipitation discussions [...] ); MPDs are now {{issued by}} the Weather Prediction Center (WPC). MCDs generally precede the issuance of a tornado or severe thunderstorm watch, by one to three hours when possible. Mesoscale discussions are designed to give local forecasters an update on a region where a severe weather threat is emerging and an indication of whether a watch is likely and details thereof, as well as situations of isolated severe weather when watches are not necessary. MCDs contain <b>meteorological</b> <b>information</b> on what is happening and what is expected {{to occur in the}} next few hours, and forecast reasoning in regard to weather watches. Mesoscale discussions are often issued to update information on watches already in effect, and sometimes when one is to be canceled. Mesoscale discussions are occasionally used as advance notice of a categorical upgrade of a scheduled convective outlook.|$|E

[...] Within any {{model is a}} set of equations, known as the primitive equations, used to predict the future state of the atmosphere. [...] These equations are initialized from the analysis data and rates of change are determined. [...] These rates of change predict the state of the atmosphere a short time into the future, with each time increment known as a time step. [...] The equations are then applied to this new atmospheric state to find new rates of change, and these new rates of change predict the atmosphere at a yet further time into the future. [...] Time stepping is repeated until the solution reaches the desired forecast time. [...] The length of the time step chosen within the model is related to the distance between the points on the computational grid, and is chosen to maintain numerical stability. [...] Time steps for global models are on the order of tens of minutes, while time steps for regional models are between one and four minutes. [...] The global models are run at varying times into the future. [...] The UKMET Unified model is run six days into the future, the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts model is run out to 10days into the future, while the Global Forecast System model run by the Environmental Modeling Center is run 16days into the future.|$|E
