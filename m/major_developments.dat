5|$|Two <b>major</b> <b>developments</b> in Leeds {{city centre}} were planned for {{completion}} around {{the beginning of}} the new decade, but were put on hold due to the prevailing economic conditions and subsequently cancelled.

5|$|One of the <b>major</b> <b>developments</b> in the {{military}} sphere during the Late Middle Ages was {{the increased use of}} infantry and light cavalry. The English also employed longbowmen, but other countries were unable to create similar forces with the same success. Armour continued to advance, spurred by the increasing power of crossbows, and plate armour was developed to protect soldiers from crossbows as well as the hand-held guns that were developed. Pole arms reached new prominence with the development of the Flemish and Swiss infantry armed with pikes and other long spears.|$|E

5|$|During William John's absence {{the estate}} was managed by his brother, Canon George Bankes, who {{inherited}} {{it on his}} brother's death just a year before his own in 1857. His youngest grandson Walter Ralph inherited the estate in 1869, and later in life married Henrietta, and had a son Henry John Ralph Bankes. After Walter's death in 1902, his widow undertook the last <b>major</b> <b>developments</b> to the estate, including construction of the church (1907), new entrance lodges (1912–13) and numerous estate cottages. In 1923 control passed to Ralph Bankes, the seven times great-grandson of the original creator.

Ralph Bankes died in 1981 and the Kingston Lacy estate, including 12 working farms, and Corfe Castle were bequeathed to the National Trust. The gift was formally accepted on 19 August 1982, the largest bequest that it had ever accepted.|$|E
5|$|<b>Major</b> <b>developments</b> in 19th-century Welsh {{literature}} include Lady Charlotte Guest's {{translation of}} the Mabinogion, {{one of the most}} important medieval Welsh prose tales of Celtic mythology, into English. 1885 saw the publication of Rhys Lewis by Daniel Owen, credited as the first novel written in the Welsh language. The 20th century experienced an important shift away from the stilted and long-winded Victorian Welsh prose, with Thomas Gwynn Jones leading the way with his 1902 work Ymadawiad Arthur. The slaughter in the trenches of the First World War had a profound effect on Welsh literature with a more pessimistic style of prose championed by T. H. Parry-Williams and R. Williams Parry. The industrialisation of south Wales saw a further shift with the likes of Rhydwen Williams who used the poetry and metre of a bygone rural Wales but in the context of an industrial landscape. Though the inter-war period is dominated by Saunders Lewis, for his political and reactionary views as much as his plays, poetry and criticism.|$|E
