2500|$|An axial {{compressor}} is a compressor that can continuously pressurize gases.

The energy level of the fluid increases as it flows through the compressor [...] due to {{the action of the}} rotor blades which exert a torque on the fluid. [...] The stationary blades slow the fluid, converting the circumferential component of flow into pressure. Compressors are typically driven by an electric motor or a steam or a gas turbine.|$|E

50|$|<b>Mixed-flow</b> pumps {{function}} as a compromise between radial and axial-flow pumps. The fluid experiences both radial acceleration and lift and exits the impeller somewhere between 0 and 90 degrees from the axial direction.
