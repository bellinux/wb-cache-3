5|$|Children {{are less}} likely than adults to clear the infection. More than 95% of people who become {{infected}} as adults or older children will stage a full recovery and develop protective immunity to the virus. However, this drops to 30% for younger children, and only 5% of newborns that acquire the infection from their <b>mother</b> <b>at</b> birth will clear the infection. This population has a 40% lifetime risk of death from cirrhosis or hepatocellular carcinoma. Of those infected between the age of one to six, 70% will clear the infection.|$|E
5|$|Farrar {{said that}} {{the day of the}} fire, about a month after Farrar's last release from the hospital, he had taken the day off from work—the first day of what he {{intended}} to be a week-long vacation to recover some strength after restarting his job post-hospital. He had spent the afternoon with Margaret Hacker and then picked up Tim and Kelly for Tim's hockey game. After dropping the children back off with their <b>mother</b> <b>at</b> about 8:45, he had dinner with Hacker, leaving her around 11:15 in the evening.|$|E

40|$|Background: Vitamin A {{deficiency}} is {{a nutritional}} problem in infants since breastmilk insufficiently contains vitamin A. Therefore {{it is necessary}} to study the effect of vitamin A supplementation to <b>mothers</b> <b>at</b> parturition period on growth and morbidities of infants at 0 - 4 months of age. Objective: To identify the effect of vitamin A supplementation to <b>mothers</b> <b>at</b> parturition period on growth and morbidities of infants at 0 - 4 months of age. Method: We conducted a randomized controlled trial from March-July 2009 at Province of Lampung. We recruited 90 mothers that were grouped into vitamin A supplementation group and socialization about vitamin A group during parturition period. The outcomes of this study were growth in WHZ and morbidities of infants at 0 - 4 months of age measured as duration of acute diarrhea and upper respiratory infections. Statistical analysis was performed by using Chi-Square and t-test. Results: The growth of infants of 0 - 4 months from vitamin A supplemented mothers was not significantly different from the socialization group. Duration of diarrhea and acute respiratory tract infection of infants from supplemented <b>mothers</b> <b>at</b> parturition period was significantly shorter than of infants from socialization group. Conclusion: The growth of infant at 0 - 4 months of age from vitamin A supplemented <b>mothers</b> <b>at</b> parturition period were not significantly different from those who were from education group. Duration of diarrhea and acute respiratory tract infection of infants from vitamin A supplemented <b>mothers</b> <b>at</b> parturition period were shorter than those who were from education group...|$|R
40|$|This study {{explores the}} {{relationship}} between child sexual abuse and adolescent motherhood, using a life story inter-view method. The sample consists of 27 mothers participating in a home-visitation parenting program for <b>mothers</b> <b>at</b> risk of child maltreatment. The failure to articulate the violation {{of child sexual abuse}} and to appropriately construct blame resulted in a range of self-destructive behaviors, some of which placed <b>mothers</b> <b>at</b> greater risk of teen preg-nancy. Repressed feelings associated with the trauma often resurfaced with motherhood as victims reexperienced their innocence and vulnerability as children...|$|R

5|$|In 2009, a new Friday the 13th film which {{restarted}} {{the film}} series continuity was released. In this film, after witnessing his mother being beheaded {{at a young}} age, an adult Jason (Derek Mears) follows in her footsteps and kills anyone who comes to Crystal Lake. Jason subsequently kidnaps a young woman, Whitney Miller (Amanda Righetti), who resembles his <b>mother</b> <b>at</b> a young age.

40|$|This Diploma {{thesis is}} based on {{adolescent}} sexual behaviour and the care of underage <b>mothers</b> <b>at</b> the Hodkovicky Diagnostic Centre. It is divided into theoretical and practical parts respectively. The theoretical part concentrates on adolescence and the behavioural risk factors probable at this development stage. Much attention is devoted to underage pregnancy and subsequent child care. Alternative ways and methods of child care are also mentioned. The practical part is a study of adolescent sexuality and describes the care given to underage <b>mothers</b> and infants <b>at</b> the Hodkovicky Diagnostic Centre. Finally, a profound case study has been conducted by interviewing underage <b>mothers</b> <b>at</b> the Diagnostic Centre and the results annexed to the thesis...|$|R

5|$|Very {{little is}} known of Sorabji's biography, {{particularly}} his early life and musical beginnings. He studied music with Charles Arthur Trew from the early 1910s until around 1915, during a private education that {{is thought to have}} ended at about the same time. He reportedly started to learn the piano from his <b>mother</b> <b>at</b> an early age, and he later received help (but no lessons) from his mother's friend Emily Edroff-Smith.|$|E
5|$|When Storm's father died, he {{returned}} from Amsterdam to Liverpool {{to be with his}} <b>mother</b> <b>at</b> Stormsville, at 54 Broad Green Road, Broadgreen, Liverpool. On 27 September 1972, Storm developed a chest infection and could not sleep properly, so he took sleeping pills. The next day Storm and his mother were both found dead. A post mortem determined that Storm had not taken enough pills to kill himself, but it was suspected that, after finding her son's body, his mother had died.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} scenes then follow whose exact {{sequence}} is unclear. Odd goes {{to visit his}} <b>mother</b> <b>at</b> the retirement home, which only makes him more unhappy: his mother is senile and spends her days staring emptily out the window, and the visit reminds him of his own impending old age. While Odd is at a restaurant, police come in and arrest the cook. At the shop where he normally buys his pipe tobacco, he learns that the owner has died. He decides to sell his boat, leading to misadventures when the buyer, who works at an airport, asks Odd to meet him there inside the secure zone. Odd goes to the local swimming pool, but his shoes were removed when the facility closed; as he is leaving, he finds a pair of red high-heeled boots and walks away in them.|$|E

5|$|At State {{funerals}} the heralds {{once again}} {{take their place}} {{at the front of}} the royal procession as it enters the place of worship. Historically during the procession of royal funerals (usually of the Sovereign) the heralds would carry a piece of armour, representing the various marks of chivalry. These included the helm and crest, spurs, gauntlet, target (shield of arms), sword and a literal 'coat of arms' (a heraldic surcoat). This procession of chivalry was an integral part of the heraldic royal funeral. One of the most solemn role for the heralds during a royal funeral is the reading of the full list of the styles and titles of the deceased. On 9 April 2002, Garter King of Arms Peter Gwynn-Jones read out the full styles and 437 titles of Queen Elizabeth, The Queen <b>Mother</b> <b>at</b> the end of her funeral service at Westminster Abbey.|$|E
5|$|Born {{and raised}} in Toowong, Brisbane, Fanning was taught the piano by his <b>mother</b> <b>at</b> an early age. At the age of 12, while {{attending}} St Joseph's College, Gregory Terrace, he began writing music, and upon graduating from St. Joseph's, {{moved on to the}} University of Queensland, where he studied journalism for a short time. He dropped out to pursue a music career, after meeting Ian Haug in an economics class. Fanning joined Haug, John Collins, and Steven Bishop, who had recently formed Powderfinger, and took the role of lead singer. After Bishop left and guitarist Darren Middleton joined, the band released five studio albums in fifteen years and achieved mainstream success in Australia. During Powderfinger's hiatus in 2005, Fanning began his solo music career with the studio album Tea & Sympathy. Powderfinger then reunited in 2007 and released two more albums before disbanding in late 2010.|$|E
