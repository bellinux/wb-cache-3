The <b>macronutrient</b> {{contents of}} N, P, K, S, Ca and Mg were measured in both soil and leaf samples, then <b>macronutrient</b> ratios were calculated from the obtained results. The results showed that younger leaves contained more N and P than older ones. K and Ca contents of leaves decreased until July, then increased slightly, and decreased again. A continuous decrease of the S content of leaves was observed until August. The Mg content of leaves increased until June, then decreased in July and then increased again. <b>Macronutrient</b> values were dependent on cultivar.

40|$|Ghrelin is a {{powerful}} orexigenic gut hormone with growth hormone releasing activity. It plays a pivotal role for long-term energy balance and short-term food intake. It is also recognized as a potent signal for meal initiation. Ghrelin levels rise sharply before feeding onset, and are strongly suppressed by food ingestion. Postprandial ghrelin response is totally <b>macronutrient</b> specific in normal weight subjects, but is rather independent of <b>macronutrient</b> composition in obese. In rodents and lean individuals, isoenergetic meals of different <b>macronutrient</b> content suppress ghrelin to a variable extent. Carbohydrate {{appears to be the}} most effective <b>macronutrient</b> for ghrelin suppression, because of its rapid absorption and insulin-secreting effect. Protein induces prolonged ghrelin suppression and is considered to be the most satiating <b>macronutrient.</b> Fat, on the other hand, exhibits rather weak and insufficient ghrelin-suppressing capacity. The principal mediators involved in meal-induced ghrelin regulation are glucose, insulin, gastrointestinal hormones released in the postabsorptive phase, vagal activity, gastric emptying rate, and postprandial alterations in intestinal osmolarity...|$|R

25|$|When {{the body}} is {{expending}} more energy than it is consuming (e.g. when exercising), the body's cells rely on internally stored energy sources, such as complex carbohydrates and fats, for energy. The first source to which the body turns is glycogen (by glycogenolysis). Glycogen is a complex carbohydrate, 65% of which is stored in skeletal muscles and the remainder in the liver (totaling about 2,000 kcal in the whole body). It is created from the excess of ingested <b>macronutrients,</b> mainly carbohydrates. When glycogen is nearly depleted, the body begins lipolysis, the mobilization and catabolism of fat stores for energy. In this process, fats, obtained from adipose tissue, or fat cells, are broken down into glycerol and fatty acids, {{which can be used}} to generate energy. The primary by-products of metabolism are carbon dioxide and water; carbon dioxide is expelled through the respiratory system.|$|E

25|$|All {{life forms}} require certain core {{chemical}} elements needed for biochemical functioning. These include carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus, and sulfur—the elemental <b>macronutrients</b> for all organisms—often {{represented by the}} acronym CHNOPS. Together these make up nucleic acids, proteins and lipids, the bulk of living matter. Five of these six elements comprise the chemical components of DNA, the exception being sulfur. The latter is {{a component of the}} amino acids cysteine and methionine. The most biologically abundant of these elements is carbon, which has the desirable attribute of forming multiple, stable covalent bonds. This allows carbon-based (organic) molecules to form an immense variety of chemical arrangements.

25|$|Meltwater around Greenland may {{transport}} {{nutrients in}} both dissolved and particulate phases to the ocean. Measurements {{of the amount}} of iron in meltwater from the Greenland ice sheet show that extensive melting of the ice sheet might add an amount of this micronutrient to the Atlantic Ocean equivalent to that added by airborne dust. However much of the particles and iron derived from glaciers around Greenland may be trapped within the extensive fjords that surround the island and, unlike the HNLC Southern ocean where iron is an extensive limiting micronutrient, biological production in the North Atlantic is subject only to very spatially and temporally limited periods of iron limitation. Nonetheless high productivity is observed in the immediate vicinity of major marine terminating glaciers around Greenland and this is attributed to meltwater inputs driving the upwelling of seawater rich in <b>macronutrients.</b>|$|E
25|$|Most recently, MREs {{have been}} {{developed}} using the Dietary Reference Intake, created by the Institute of Medicine (IOM). The IOM indicated servicemembers (who were classified as highly active men {{between the ages of}} 18 and 30) typically burn about 4,200 Calories (kcal) a day, but tended to only consume about 2,400 Calories a day during combat, entering a negative energy balance. This imbalance occurs when servicemembers fail to consume full portions of their rations. Although manipulations to the food items and distribution of <b>macronutrients</b> to help boost the amount of kilocalories per MRE have been made, more studies are showing many servicemembers still do not meet today's standards of daily consumption, often trading and discarding portions of the ration. Researchers continue to study the habits and eating preferences of servicemembers, making constant changes that encourage servicemembers to eat the entire meal and thus get full nutritional value.|$|E

We investigated the effect of <b>macronutrient</b> composition on adipokine levels in 144 obese, diabetic participants who were randomly assigned to a low- carbohydrate (0. 05 for all variables). However, significant changes in leptin and adiponectin occurred over time (P < 0. 001 and P < 0. 012, respectively).

2500|$|Another form of {{chemical}} removal other than herbicides is soil solarization. Soil solarization is a thermal (heat) method that utilizes solar-enhanced heating {{of the soil}} to kill the root system of the plant, thereby avoiding the use of pesticides and other more dangerous (fire-based) means to control the plant. [...] Soil solarization affects the micronutrients and <b>macronutrients</b> in the soil. The most prominent effect of this method of control is the increase in potassium (K). The higher level of K in all soils undergoing solarization demonstrates the successful release of K from decomposing kudzu plant tissues. Such a rise in K levels by solarization is important for soils in the Southeastern United States that tend to be highly weathered and generally have low K contents.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{magnitude}} of the negative energy balance induced by exercise may be reduced due to compensatory increases in energy intake. OBJECTIVE: TO ADDRESS THE QUESTION: Does increased exercise or physical activity alter ad-libitum daily energy intake or <b>macronutrient</b> composition in healthy adults? DATA SOURCES: PubMed and Embase were searched (January 1990 -January 2013) for studies that presented data on energy and/or <b>macronutrient</b> intake by level of exercise, physical activity or change in response to exercise. Ninety-nine articles (103 studies) were included. STUDY ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: Primary source articles published in English in peer-reviewed journals. Articles that presented data on energy and/or <b>macronutrient</b> intake by level of exercise or physical activity or changes in energy or <b>macronutrient</b> intake in response to acute exercise or exercise training in healthy (non-athlete) adults (mean age 18 - 64 years). STUDY APPRAISAL AND SYNTHESIS METHODS: Articles were grouped by study design: cross-sectional, acute/short term, non-randomized, and randomized trials. Considerable heterogeneity existed within study groups for several important study parameters, therefore a meta-analysis was considered inappropriate. Results were synthesized and presented by study design. RESULTS: No effect of physical activity, exercise or exercise training on energy intake was shown in 59 % of cross-sectional studies (n = 17), 69 % of acute (n = 40), 50 % of short-term (n = 10), 92 % of non-randomized (n = 12) and 75 % of randomized trials (n = 24). Ninety-four percent of acute, 57 % of short-term, 100 % of non-randomized and 74 % of randomized trials found no effect of exercise on <b>macronutrient</b> intake.

LIMITATIONS: The literature {{is limited by the}} lack of adequately powered trials of sufficient duration, which have prescribed and measured exercise energy expenditure, or employed adequate assessment methods for energy and <b>macronutrient</b> intake.

2500|$|Since 1961, human diets {{across the}} world have become more diverse in the {{consumption}} of major commodity staple crops, with a corollary decline in consumption of local or regionally important crops, and thus have become more homogeneous globally.
