40|$|Interseeding {{cover crops}} is an {{alternative}} to laborious intertillages and hand weeding followed in organic farming. The objective {{of this study was}} to evaluate the effect of fertilization and interseeding cover crops on the growth of <b>main</b> <b>crops</b> and weeds and the stability of weed suppression over years and <b>main</b> <b>crop</b> species under four-year rotational organic farming. Two cover crops, winter rye (Secale cereale L.) and hairy vetch (Vicia villosa Roth), were interseeded in furrows of potato (Solanum tuberosum L.), soybean (Glycine max Merr.) and maize (Zea mays L.) at 3 - 5 weeks after planting the <b>main</b> <b>crops.</b> The number and dry weight of weeds were measured at the maximum plant height stage of <b>main</b> <b>crops</b> and <b>main</b> <b>crop</b> yields were recorded at their physiological maturity. The light competition between <b>main</b> <b>crops,</b> cover crops and weeds was analyzed by vertical community structure and vegetation cover ratio (VCR) of each crop. Since light competition of <b>main</b> <b>crops</b> with cover crops and weeds was not severe, <b>main</b> <b>crop</b> yields were not suppressed significantly by either cover crops or weeds. Weed growth was suppressed significantly by interseeding cover crops through increasing the VCR of <b>main</b> <b>crops</b> plus cover crops. This weed suppression by interseeding cover crops was stable to the <b>main</b> <b>crop</b> species in rotational cropping systems and to the various environmental conditions, because the cover crops compensated the low VCR of <b>main</b> <b>crops</b> alone at early growth stage especially when <b>main</b> <b>crop</b> growth was depressed by unfavorable environmental conditions. In addition, input of compost and fermented organic fertilizer had positive effects on the <b>main</b> <b>crop</b> yield and weed suppression. It is concluded, therefore, that weeds can be suppressed effectively and stably without yield reductions of <b>main</b> <b>crops</b> by interseeding cover crops with sufficient fertilization in organic farming systems...|$|R
40|$|Weed {{management}} {{is a major}} issue in organic farming systems. Although interseeding cover crops is one alternative to herbicides, cover crops often suppress not only weeds but also <b>main</b> <b>crops.</b> Therefore, using cover crops for weed control without adverse effects on <b>main</b> <b>crop</b> growth is important. To verify the effect of cover crops on competition between <b>main</b> <b>crops,</b> cover crops and weeds in a snowy-cold region, <b>main</b> <b>crops</b> soybean (Glycine max Merr.) in 2005 and maize (Zea mays L.) in 2006 were grown with cover crops winter rye (Secale cereale L.) and hairy vetch (Vicia villosa Roth), respectively. The cover crops were sown on three sowing dates: before <b>main</b> <b>crop</b> planting (Pre-MC), on the same date of <b>main</b> <b>crop</b> planting (Syn-MC) and after <b>main</b> <b>crop</b> planting (Post-MC). A plot without cover crops (Sole-MC) was used as a control. The dry weight (DW), vegetation cover ratio (VCR), vertical community structure and chlorophyll content were measured to estimate the competition between <b>main</b> <b>crops,</b> cover crops and weeds. Weed DW was suppressed significantly by sowing cover crops in both soybean and maize. This weed suppression was associated with the increase of VCR of <b>main</b> <b>crops</b> plus cover crops at the early growth stage of <b>main</b> <b>crops.</b> Soil seed banks of dominant weed also became lower by sowing cover crops, implying the importance of proper weed management for suppressing weeds successively. In addition, the sowing dates of cover crops had large effects on <b>main</b> <b>crops</b> DW especially in maize, i. e., it was significantly lower in Pre-MC and Syn-MC than in Post-MC. Although the cover crop height was markedly shorter than the <b>main</b> <b>crop</b> height, the chlorophyll content of the <b>main</b> <b>crops</b> was significantly lower when cover crops were sown earlier. These results suggest that the growth inhibition of <b>main</b> <b>crops</b> by cover crops was partly caused by competition for nutrients between <b>main</b> <b>crops</b> and cover crops, and this growth inhibition was alleviated when cover crops were sown after the establishment of <b>main</b> <b>crops.</b> Consequently, soybean yield was the highest in Post-MC and decreased by 29 %, 18 % and 7 % in Sole-MC, Pre-MC and Syn-MC, respectively, and maize yield was also the highest in Post-MC and decreased by 68 %, 100 % and 24 % in Sole-MC, Pre-MC and Syn-MC, respectively. It was concluded that weeds could be controlled effectively by sowing cover <b>crops</b> after planting <b>main</b> <b>crops</b> in organic farming systems in a snowy-cold region...|$|R
50|$|Groundcovers are plants which grow {{close to}} the ground, under the <b>main</b> <b>crop,</b> to slow the {{development}} of weeds and provide other benefits of mulch. They are usually fast-growing plants that continue growing with the <b>main</b> <b>crops.</b> By contrast, cover crops are incorporated into the soil or killed with herbicides. However, live mulches also {{may need to be}} mechanically or chemically killed eventually to prevent competition with the <b>main</b> <b>crop.</b>|$|R
40|$|Ratooning {{can be used}} as an {{alternative}} cultivation technique for production of sorghum. This study was aimed to evaluate the growth and production of ratoon following the <b>main</b> <b>crop.</b> The study was conducted during August 2013 until November 2014, at Cikabayan Experimental Station, Bogor Agricultural University. The research was arranged in a randomized complete block design with four replications. The results showed that genotypes was significantly affected the vegetative and reproductive characters, physiologycal characters of the <b>main</b> <b>crop,</b> ratooning ability, and vegetative characters of ratoon crop. Plant height, stem diameter, fresh and dry weight, harvest time, and harvest index of <b>main</b> <b>crops</b> had significant correlation with ratooning ability. Plant height, total chlorophyll, fresh and dry weight, panicle weight, grain weight per panicle, 1, 000 grain weight, harvest index, and transpiration rate of <b>main</b> <b>crops</b> had significant correlation with ratoon growth. Based on path analysis, the <b>main</b> <b>crop</b> growth directly affected ratoon height, and vegetative characters of ratoon directly affected the yield. The ratoon yielded 48. 9 - 65. 7 % of the <b>main</b> <b>crop</b> yield...|$|R
40|$|Trap {{cropping}} is {{the planting}} of a trap crop {{to protect the}} <b>main</b> <b>crop</b> from a pest, by having the trap crop appear more attractive to the pest than the <b>main</b> <b>crop.</b> There are two forms of trap cropping; perimeter trap cropping (PTC), also known as border trap cropping, and row intercropping. Perimeter trap crops completely surround the <b>main</b> <b>crop,</b> preventing an attack from any direction. Row intercrops are planted in alternating rows with the <b>main</b> <b>crop.</b> While PTC and row intercropping can be useful methods in pest control, they may not alleviate a problem completely, but provide a sustainable way to monitor and control target pests...|$|R

40|$|Rice lodge ratooning is the {{production}} of a second rice crop from the lodging stubble left behind after harvesting the <b>main</b> <b>crop.</b> This research aims to find out the suitable harvesting time and method for stubble lock-lodge of the <b>main</b> <b>crop</b> in order to achieveing the highest grain yield of the next ratoon crop. The experiment was carried out in a randomized complete block design, arranged in a split-plot configuration, with four replication. The results was showed that the <b>main</b> <b>crop</b> harvesting time either physiological or harvesting maturity stages had no effect on grain yield. In contrast, the stubble lock-lodge method affacted the grain yield. The rice grown from the stubble of the <b>main</b> <b>crop</b> which lodged by combined harvester tractor yielded statistically significant 19. 4 % higher than the crop grown from the one lodged by the tractor with a set of wheel tires. It was also found that there was a positive correlation between dry matters of the <b>main</b> <b>crop</b> and yield of the lodge ratoon rice, which is opposite to the plant number. Results from this study indicated that, to achieve the maximum yield of organic lodge ratoon rice, the stubble of the <b>main</b> <b>crop</b> should be lodged by combined harvester tractor at any stage of the rice maturity...|$|R
