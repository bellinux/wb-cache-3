60|$|I {{explained}} to Traddles {{that there was}} a difficulty in keeping King Charles the First out of <b>Mr.</b> <b>Dick's</b> manuscripts; <b>Mr.</b> <b>Dick</b> in the meanwhile looking very deferentially and seriously at Traddles, and sucking his thumb.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Oh, certainly,' said <b>Mr.</b> <b>Dick,</b> in a hurry, 'I intend, Trotwood, to {{get that}} done immediately--it really must be done immediately! And then it will go in, you know--and then--' said <b>Mr.</b> <b>Dick,</b> after {{checking}} himself, and pausing a long time, 'there'll be a pretty kettle of fish!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Well,' said <b>Mr.</b> <b>Dick,</b> in answer, 'my {{compliments}} to her, and I--I believe I {{have made}} a start. I think I {{have made a}} start,' said <b>Mr.</b> <b>Dick,</b> passing his hand among his grey hair, and casting anything but a confident look at his manuscript. 'You have been to school?' ...|$|R

60|$|<b>Mr.</b> <b>Dick</b> {{looked hard}} at me, {{as if to}} {{identify}} me in this character.|$|R
6000|$|We {{found him}} {{hard at work}} with his {{inkstand}} and papers, refreshed {{by the sight of}} the flower-pot stand and the little round table {{in a corner of the}} small apartment. He received us cordially, and made friends with <b>Mr.</b> <b>Dick</b> in a moment. <b>Mr.</b> <b>Dick</b> professed an absolute certainty of having seen him before, and we both said, 'Very likely.' ...|$|R
60|$|This veneration <b>Mr.</b> <b>Dick</b> {{extended}} to the Doctor, whom he thought the most subtle and accomplished philosopher of any age. It was long before <b>Mr.</b> <b>Dick</b> ever spoke to him otherwise than bareheaded; and even when he and the Doctor had struck up quite a friendship, and would walk together by the hour, {{on that side of}} the courtyard which was known among us as The Doctor's Walk, <b>Mr.</b> <b>Dick</b> would pull off his hat at intervals to show his respect for wisdom and knowledge. How it ever came about that the Doctor began to read out scraps of the famous Dictionary, in these walks, I never knew; perhaps he felt it all the same, at first, as reading to himself. However, it passed into a custom too; and <b>Mr.</b> <b>Dick,</b> listening with a face shining with pride and pleasure, in his heart of hearts believed the Dictionary to be the most delightful book in the world.|$|R
60|$|I thought <b>Mr.</b> <b>Dick</b> {{would have}} fallen, insensible. My aunt being resolute, I {{went out and}} got the ale myself. As it was growing late, Peggotty and <b>Mr.</b> <b>Dick</b> took that {{opportunity}} of repairing to the chandler's shop together. I parted from him, poor fellow, {{at the corner of the}} street, with his great kite at his back, a very monument of human misery.|$|R
60|$|<b>Mr.</b> <b>Dick</b> {{secretly}} {{shook his}} head at me, as if he thought there was no getting over this.|$|R
60|$|I {{was greatly}} overcome, and could only thank her, again and again, and send my love to <b>Mr.</b> <b>Dick.</b>|$|R
60|$|The heartiness of the {{ejaculation}} startled <b>Mr.</b> <b>Dick</b> exceedingly; and me, too, if I am to {{tell the}} truth.|$|R
60|$|Abowt 12 master had returned, and <b>Mr.</b> <b>Dick</b> Blewitt came stridin up {{the stairs}} with a sollum and {{important}} hair.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Very good,' {{returned}} my aunt, 'that's settled. I {{have been}} thinking, do you know, <b>Mr.</b> <b>Dick,</b> that I might call him Trotwood?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Exactly!' cried <b>Mr.</b> <b>Dick,</b> {{who seemed}} quite enchanted by my reply. 'That is, Trotwood, {{when they took}} some of the trouble out of you-know-who's head, and put it you know where, there was a--' <b>Mr.</b> <b>Dick</b> made his two hands revolve very fast about each other {{a great number of}} times, and then brought them into collision, and rolled them over and over one another, to express confusion. 'There was that sort of thing done to me somehow. Eh?' ...|$|R
60|$|It was {{not until}} after eleven o'clock that the little {{gathering}} broke up, and then <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Dick</b> Rover called her children to her.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ladies and gentlemen, {{the future}} <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Dick</b> Rover!" [...] said Dick, {{just a bit}} awkwardly, while Dora blushed {{the color of a}} peony.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Gentlemen, and madam,' said Mr. Micawber, 'good morning! My dear sir,' to <b>Mr.</b> <b>Dick,</b> who {{shook hands}} with him violently, 'you are {{extremely}} good.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I have {{no doubt}} you have,' said my aunt. 'Janet,' ringing the bell, 'my {{compliments}} to <b>Mr.</b> <b>Dick,</b> and beg him to come down.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'If {{there is}} {{anything}} in the world,' said my aunt, with great decision and force of manner, 'that <b>Mr.</b> <b>Dick</b> is not, it's that.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Trot,' said my aunt one evening, {{when the}} backgammon-board was placed as usual {{for herself and}} <b>Mr.</b> <b>Dick,</b> 'we must not forget your education.' ...|$|R
60|$|Anne smiled, and deduced {{a mental}} picture of <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Dick</b> Moore from Captain Jim's {{way of putting}} it; evidently a second Mrs. Rachel Lynde.|$|R
6000|$|... 'David Copperfield?' said <b>Mr.</b> <b>Dick,</b> who did {{not appear}} to me to {{remember}} much about it. 'David Copperfield? Oh yes, to be sure. David, certainly.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Why, really' said <b>Mr.</b> <b>Dick,</b> 'I don't {{see how it}} {{can have}} been in that year, Trotwood. Did you get that date out of history?' ...|$|R
60|$|<b>Mr.</b> <b>Dick</b> {{took his}} finger {{out of his}} mouth, on this hint, and stood among the group, with a grave and {{attentive}} expression of face.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I suppose,' said my aunt, eyeing me as {{narrowly}} {{as she had}} {{eyed the}} needle in threading it, 'you think <b>Mr.</b> <b>Dick</b> a short name, eh?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But they've {{made some}} terrible enemies," [...] broke in <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Dick</b> Rover. [...] "Just look at Jack's eyes. One fellow tried to throw pepper into them." ...|$|R
60|$|I don't {{know how}} he should have had, for it was new enough to me. I passed that off, and brought <b>Mr.</b> <b>Dick</b> on the carpet.|$|R
6000|$|We {{looked at}} one another, without knowing {{what to make of}} this, and went into the sitting-room. What was my amazement to find, of all people upon earth, my aunt there, and <b>Mr.</b> <b>Dick!</b> My aunt sitting on a {{quantity}} of luggage, with her two birds before her, and her cat on her knee, like a female Robinson Crusoe, drinking tea. <b>Mr.</b> <b>Dick</b> leaning thoughtfully on a great kite, such as we had often been out together to fly, with more luggage piled about him! ...|$|R
