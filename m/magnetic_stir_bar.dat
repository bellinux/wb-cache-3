50|$|Magnetic {{stirrers}} {{are often}} used in chemistry and biology, {{where they can be}} used inside hermetically closed vessels or systems, without the need for complicated rotary seals. They are preferred over gear-driven motorized stirrers because they are quieter, more efficient, and have no moving external parts to break or wear out (other than the simple <b>bar</b> magnet itself). <b>Magnetic</b> <b>stir</b> <b>bars</b> work well in glass vessels commonly used for chemical reactions, as glass does not appreciably affect a magnetic field. The limited size of the bar means that magnetic stirrers can only be used for relatively small experiments, of 4 liters or less. <b>Stir</b> <b>bars</b> also have difficulty in dealing with viscous liquids or thick suspensions. For larger volumes or more viscous liquids, some sort of mechanical stirring is typically needed.|$|R

We monitored temperature selection of individual cornsnakes in a thermal gradient {{in the spring and}} again in the fall when snakes were starved, digesting a meal equivalent to 10 % of its body mass, and digesting a meal equivalent to 25 % of its body mass. We measured the gastric digestion rate by monitoring the passage of <b>magnetic</b> <b>stir</b> <b>bars,</b> placed inside a mouse meal, through the digestive tracts of cornsnakes maintained at 22 °C, 25 °C, 28 °C, and 32 °C.|$|R

50|$|At a {{laboratory}} scale, mixing {{is achieved by}} magnetic stirrers or by simple hand-shaking. Sometimes mixing in laboratory vessels is more thorough and occurs faster than is possible industrially. <b>Magnetic</b> <b>stir</b> <b>bars</b> are radial-flow mixers that induce solid body rotation in the fluid being mixed. This is acceptable on a small scale, since the vessels are small and mixing therefore occurs rapidly (short blend time). A variety of <b>stir</b> <b>bar</b> configurations exist, {{but because of the}} small size and (typically) low viscosity of the fluid, it is possible to use one configuration for nearly all mixing tasks. The cylindrical <b>stir</b> <b>bar</b> can be used for suspension of solids, as seen in iodometry, deagglomeration (useful for preparation of microbiology growth medium from powders), and liquid-liquid blending. Another peculiarity of laboratory mixing is that the mixer rests {{on the bottom of the}} vessel instead of being suspended near the center. Furthermore, the vessels used for laboratory mixing are typically more widely varied than those used for industrial mixing; for instance, Erlenmeyer flasks, or Florence flasks may be used in addition to the more cylindrical beaker.|$|R

30|$|The snake's {{head was}} guided into a clear acrylic tube with a {{diameter}} {{slightly larger than}} the snake's body, and the snake crawled into the tube. Initially, snakes resisted doing this, so we habituated them by repeatedly placing them in the tubes {{over the course of}} the week prior to any data collection. After habituation, the snakes willingly entered the tubes. We placed a foam stopper at the far end of the tube to ensure that the snake did not escape during measurement. Once the snake was in the tube, we passed a compass next to its body beginning at the head and ending at the tail. Once each <b>stir</b> <b>bar</b> was located, we measured the distance from the snout to its location and recorded it. We repeated this with all snakes every 24  h until both <b>magnetic</b> <b>stir</b> <b>bars</b> exited the stomach and entered the small intestine. The gastric digestive rate was measured as the first day each <b>stir</b> <b>bar</b> was no longer in the stomach. Within minutes of feeding, we were able to locate the <b>stir</b> <b>bars</b> within the stomach. Their positions changed very little for several days and then there was a noticeable change in position. In all cases, the two <b>stir</b> <b>bars</b> exited the stomach at different times.|$|R
30|$|It {{should be}} noted that no {{electricity}} at all was used in the synthesis or purification of the biodiesel or glycerol. All heat supplied to synthesize biodiesel and distill methanol/ethanol away from the recovered glycerol was generated through sunlight. Furthermore, it was successfully demonstrated that high speed stirring via a <b>magnetic</b> <b>stir</b> <b>bar</b> is not needed in this synthetic process. It was observed that sufficient mixing is capable of being achieved through reflux solvent mixing, accompanied with occasional, slight rocking of the reflector dish to aide in the mixing process.|$|E

40|$|<b>Magnetic</b> <b>stir</b> <b>bars</b> {{coated with}} {{polydimethylsiloxane}} (PDMS) were applied for sorption of migration-relevant compounds in food packaging contact media. The loaded <b>stir</b> <b>bars</b> were re-extracted with solvents {{as well as}} by thermal desorption. A mix of polar and non-polar compounds relevant for migration testing at concentrations of 1 and 0. 1 ppm respectively were used for method development. The PDMS <b>stir</b> <b>bar</b> extraction method was optimized in terms of sorption time, sample volume, re-extraction conditions and NaCl and ethanol concentration. As a result the recoveries determined for each compound were lower than calculated. The limits of detection were between 1 and 100 ppb and the reproducibility of the method was estimated for the investigated compounds between 3 and 49 %. NaCl or ethanol addition did not increase the recovery rates. In comparison to alternative extraction methods (e. g. LLE or SPE) the SBSE method showed lower recoveries especially for polar compounds. However, the detection limits were sufficient for migration testing. Due to fact that the developed SBSE method is time efficient this method will be interesting for routine migration testing of food packaging materials...|$|R

40|$|For phantom studies {{involving}} 90 Y PET/CT, homogeneous so-lutions of 90 Y, for example, 90 Y citrate, {{are commonly}} used. However, the microsphere biodistribution of a postradioemboli-zation liver is never homogeneous; therefore, such phantoms are physiologically unrealistic for simulating clinical scenarios. The {{aim of this}} work {{was to develop a}} safe and practical phan-tom capable of simulating the heterogeneous microsphere bio-distribution of a postradioembolization liver. Methods: Gelatin (5 %) was used to suspend 90 Y resin microspheres, poured into plastic containers to simulate a liver with 2 tumors. Micro-spheres were added while the gelatin was maintained in a liquid state on a hot plate and continuously <b>stirred</b> with <b>magnetic</b> <b>stir</b> <b>bars.</b> The liquid microsphere mixture was then rapidly cooled in an ice bath while being stirred, resulting in a hetero-geneous suspension of microspheres. The completed phantom was serially scanned by 90 Y PET/CT over 2 wk. Results: All scans demonstrated a heterogeneous microsphere distribution throughout the liver and tumor inserts. Serendipitously, mag-netic <b>stir</b> <b>bars</b> left inside the phantom produced CT artifacts similar to those caused by embolization coils, whereas pockets of air trapped within the gelatin during its preparation mimicked gas within hollow viscus. The microspheres and tumor inserts remained fixed and suspended within the gelatin, with no evi-dence of breakdown or leakage. Conclusion: A gelatin phan-tom realistically simulating the physiologic microsphere biodistribution of a postradioembolization liver is feasible to construct in a radiopharmacy.

40|$|This work {{investigates the}} fluid flow in a {{cylindrical}} millilitre vial <b>stirred</b> by a <b>magnetic</b> <b>stirred</b> <b>bar</b> using Computational Fluid Dynamic (CFD). Stirred millilitre vials {{are used to}} study nucleation phenomena and crystallization as an outline of literature study of nucleation and crystallization phenomena {{and the role of}} stirring in this process. The baffle free vial was meshed with around 500, 000 cells. To simulate the stirring a rotary frame and moving walls were used. Stirring speeds were between 100 and 1000 rpm where considered, correspondently to a stirrer Reynolds number between 260 and 2600. For stirring speeds bellow 500 rpm, simulations by both the both laminar flow model and the k-ε model where run, while above 500 rpm only k-ε was used. Results of the two models were very similar indicative the adequacy of k-ε to simulate the flow even at low Reynolds. The flow shows expected circulation pattern with upwards pumping close to side walls and downwards pumping in the centre of cylindrical vial. At 1000 rpm circulation patterns expands {{up to the top of}} the vial while at 300 rpm and lower the upper half of the vial is poorly mixed.

40|$|The {{influence}} of agitation and fluid shear on nucleation of m-hydroxybenzoic acid polymorphs from 1 -propanol solution {{has been investigated}} through 1160 cooling crystallization experiments. The induction time has been measured at different supersaturations and temperatures in two different crystallizer setups: small vials agitated by <b>magnetic</b> <b>stir</b> <b>bars,</b> for which experiments were repeated 4080 times, and a rotating cylinder apparatus, for which each experiment was repeated five times. The nucleating polymorph has in each case been identified by FTIR spectroscopy. At high thermodynamic driving force for nucleation, only the metastable polymorph (form II) was obtained, while at low driving force both polymorphs were obtained. At equal driving force, a higher temperature resulted in {{a larger proportion of}} form I nucleations. The fluid dynamic conditions influence the induction time, as well as the polymorphic outcome. Experiments in small vials show that the agitation rate has a stronger influence on the induction time of form II compared to form I. The fraction of form I nucleations is significantly lower at intermediate agitation rates, coinciding with a reduced induction time of form II. In experiments in the rotating cylinder apparatus, the induction time is found to be inversely correlated to the shear rate. The difference in polymorphic outcome at different driving force is examined in terms of the ratio of the nucleation rates of the two polymorphs, calculated by classical nucleation theory using determined values of the pre-exponential factor and interfacial energy for each polymorph. A possible mechanism explaining the difference in the {{influence of}} fluid dynamics on the nucleation of the two polymorphs is based on differences between the two crystal structures. It is hypothesized that the layered structure of form II is comparatively more sensitive to changes in shear flow conditions than the more isotropic form I structure. ACCEPTEDpeer-reviewe...|$|R

Each diffusion cell was dismantled to analyze the amount of test compound in the different compartments: to determine the remained amount of test compound on the skin surface, the skin was washed by alternately pipetting 1  mL of the corresponding solvent of the test substance {{up and down on}} the skin surface and wiping the skin with cotton swabs dampened into the solvent. This procedure was repeated two times, followed by wiping the skin surface with one dry cotton swab. All cotton swabs, pipettes, and pipetted solvents of one diffusion cell were collected in one vessel and extracted in the corresponding extraction fluid (water for the extraction of caffeine and 100  % ethanol for the extraction of testosterone). This step represented the first skin wash.

40|$|The {{cell culture}} unit (CCU) is being {{designed}} to support cell growth for long-duration life science experiments on the International Space Station (ISS). The CCU is a perfused loop system {{that provides a}} fluid environment for controlled cell growth experiments within cell specimen chambers (CSCs), and is intended to accommodate diverse cell specimen types. Many of the functional requirements depend on the fluid flow field within the CSC (e. g., feeding and gas management). A design goal of the CCU is to match, within experimental limits, all environmental conditions, other than the effects of gravity on the cells, whether the hardware is in microgravity (micro g), normal Earth gravity, or up to 2 g on the ISS centrifuge. In order to achieve this goal, two steps are being taken. The {{first step is to}} characterize the environmental conditions of current 1 g cell biology experiments being performed in laboratories using ground-based hardware. The second step is to ensure that the design of the CCU allows the fluid flow conditions found in 1 g to be replicated from microgravity up to 2 g. The techniques that are being used to take these steps include flow visualization, particle image velocimetry (PIV), and computational fluid dynamics (CFD). Flow visualization using the injection of dye has been used to gain a global perspective of the characteristics of the CSC flow field. To characterize laboratory cell culture conditions, PIV is being used to determine the flow field parameters of cell suspension cultures grown in Erlenmeyer flasks on orbital shakers. These measured parameters will be compared to PIV measurements in the CSCs to ensure that the flow field that cells encounter in CSCs is within the bounds determined for typical laboratory experiments. Using CFD, a detailed simulation is being developed to predict the flow field within the CSC {{for a wide variety of}} flow conditions, including microgravity environments.

Routine metabolic rate increased from 4. 8 ± 1. 3 (0 d postfertilization) to 174. 0 ± 7. 8 mg O 2 ·kg- 1 ·h- 1 (5 d postfertilization). The limiting oxygen concentration increased similarly up to 87. 0 % ± 2. 7 % (maximum individual value = 95. 9 %) air saturation by 5 d postfertilization. The respirometer described could not be used for sac fry, but it proved effective with clumped channel catfish eggs. Preliminary channel catfish hatchery management recommendations are to maintain DO concentrations in hatchery troughs at air saturation at least during the last day of egg development...|$|E

50|$|They are bar {{shaped and}} often {{octagonal}} in cross-section (sometimes circular), although {{a variety of}} special shapes exist for more efficient stirring. Most <b>stir</b> <b>bars</b> have a ridge around the center (called a pivot ring) on which they rotate. The smallest {{are only a few}} millimeters long and the largest a few centimeters. A <b>stir</b> <b>bar</b> retriever is a separate magnet {{on the end of a}} long stick (usually coated with teflon) which can be used to remove <b>stir</b> <b>bars</b> from a vessel.|$|R
40|$|<b>Stir</b> <b>bar</b> sorptive {{extraction}} is {{a powerful}} technique for the extraction and analysis of organic compounds in aqueous matrices. Carbonyl compounds are ubiquitous components in rainwater, however, {{it is a major}} challenge to accurately identify and sensitively quantify carbonyls from rainwater due to the complex matrix. A <b>stir</b> <b>bar</b> sorptive extraction technique was developed to efficiently extract carbonyls from aqueous samples following chemical derivatization by O-(2, 3, 4, 5, 6 -pentafluorobenzyl) hydroxylamine hydrochloride. Several commercial <b>stir</b> <b>bars</b> in two sizes were used to simultaneously measure 29 carbonyls in aqueous samples with detection by gas chromatography with mass spectrometry. A 100 mL aqueous sample was extracted by <b>stir</b> <b>bars</b> and the analytes on stir barswere desorbed into a 2 mLsolvent solution in an ultrasonic bath. The preconcentration Coefficient for different carbonyls varied between 30 and 45 times. The limits of detection of <b>stir</b> <b>bar</b> sorptive extraction with gas chromatography mass spectrometry for carbonyls (1030 ng/L) were improved by ten times compared with other methods such as gas chromatography with electron capture detection and <b>stir</b> <b>bar</b> sorptive extraction with high-performance liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry. The technique was used to determine carbonyls in rainwater samples collected in York, UK, and 20 carbonyl species were quantified including glyoxal, methylglyoxal, isobutenal, 2 -hydroxy ethanal...|$|R
