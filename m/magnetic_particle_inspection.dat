5|$|Originally {{developed}} as a method to detect flaws or irregularities in magnetic materials, <b>magnetic</b> <b>particle</b> <b>inspection</b> {{can be used on}} firearms to visualize the serial number underneath the obliterated area. When performing this technique, examiners place the weapon in a magnetic field. The irregularities in the metal, in this case the serial number, cause the field to deform. When a solution of ferrous particles is added to the weapon's magnetized surface they will be attracted to the area where the magnetic field has deformed and will build up in the area. If fluorescent particles are added to the ferrous solution, ultraviolet light {{can be used to make}} it easier to visualize any recovered serial number.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: Assessment of loss in {{life time}} of the 14 MoV 6 - 3 steel primary steam {{pipeline}} material after long-term service under creep conditions. Design/methodology/approach: For material of the pipeline after long-term service the microstructure investigations in a scanning electron microscope, phase composition analysis of precipitations, hardness measurement {{at the point where}} structure was observed and mechanical testing at room temperature were carried out. In addition, the <b>magnetic</b> <b>particle</b> <b>inspections</b> and ultrasonic testing were carried out over the entire volume of the pipeline sample. Findings: The life exhaustion extent of the investigated steel 14 MoV 6 - 3 estimated based on the metallographic tests is much higher than the expected one for the investigated steel at the current working parameters of the pipeline. Correct evaluation of the pipeline material condition during the periodic diagnostic testing, including but not limited to that performed by the matrix replica method, allows the excessive loss in life {{time of the}} material to be revealed and the reason for premature destruction of the pipeline components to be diagnosed and removed early enough. Practical implications: The presented method can be used for evaluation and qualification of structural changes in power station boiler components operating under creep conditions. Originality/value: The presented results of changes in the mechanical properties, structure and in the precipitation processes are applied to evaluate the condition of the elements in further industrial service...|$|R
