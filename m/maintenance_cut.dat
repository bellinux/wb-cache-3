The first serious examination of the long term viability of the railway came with the Howden Report in 1949, which recommended {{the closure of the}} Ramsey line, which was already losing money; the eventual closure of the Peel line, which was breaking even in the late 1940s; and the retention of the then profitable Port Erin line. Howden also reported that the existing equipment of the railway had an economic life of 10-25 years. Economies were made throughout the 1950s and early 1960s. These included the ending of evening and Sunday services, the deferral of track <b>maintenance,</b> and <b>cuts</b> to train mileage as locomotives became unserviceable. To further reduce expenses, there were winter closures of the Peel line (1960-61 only) and the Ramsey line after September 1961, but A. M.

The goal {{of this research is}} to suggest how process participants can best be induced to start and complete cost-effective sourcing studies that will help the Air Force reduce the cost of support activities without reducing military capability or quality of life. The most effective financial incentive to undertake sourcing studies that we have identified is the operations and <b>maintenance</b> (O&M) <b>cuts</b> that have been allocated to the Air Force's major commands (MAJCOMs). Such cuts provide strong incentives for commands to reduce support costs either by conducting sourcing studies or by using methods such as process improvement. The Air Staff faces an important challenge, however, to determine the least-harmful allocation of O&M cuts across its commands. The MAJCOMs must also delegate incentives to their wing commanders and functional personnel, who play important roles both in identifying activities to be competed and in conducting sourcing studies. These incentives can include performance evaluations, sharing in savings from sourcing studies, budget or personnel cuts, assistance with conducting sourcing studies, and greater competition among installations to provide services.

40|$|In renal transplantation, organic injury {{begins with}} the {{physiological}} changes characteristic of brain death or cardiac arrest and continues at the implant. After being removed from the donor, the organ is maintained {{for a short period}} in non-physiological conditions before being definitively reperfused at the time of transplantation. During this time, a storm of pathophysiological processes occurs, beginning with altered perfusion and ischemia associated with donor <b>maintenance,</b> circulatory <b>cut</b> and preservation of the organ and then continuing with damage after reperfusion by generation of a pro-inflammatory organ -specific. This complex of processes is called ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) and manifests clinically with delayed graft function (DGF) or primary graft failure (PGF) after transplantation. In this review, we will initially define DGF with its adverse consequences describing different diagnostic methods. We will then discuss the mechanisms involved in the pathophysiology of the first stage of the IRI complex, the ischemic injury, generated during the donation process. Of course, a division can not always be made because we understand that in the same process of donation and transplantation, the injury due to ischemia and reperfusion is generated in its continuity. The work will focus specifically on the factors that occur around the immediate pre-transplant times which may specifically influence the ischemia of the sought kidneys...|$|R

In this work, Mobile LiDAR systems (aerial and terrestrial) are combined for surveying roads and their surroundings in order to provide complete point cloud. As the precision of the point clouds obtained from these mobile systems is influenced by GNSS outages, Gaussian noise with different standard deviation values is introduced in the point cloud in order to determine its influence in the evaluation of water runoff direction.

This thesis project {{analyzes}} how {{the principles}} and methods of service design, design thinking, and human-centered design research can be utilized to re-imagine a county-level parks department, specifically Allegheny County Parks. Allegheny County Parks is a system of nine parks that have suffered for 30 + years from deferred <b>maintenance,</b> funding <b>cuts,</b> and other shortages. Boyce Park, one of the nine County parks, includes {{a broad range of}} prototypical park activities. My previous employment and established relationships made Boyce Park an excellent service design case study. To begin the project, I employed exploratory research methods (e. g., literature reviews, observations, participation in services, surveys, and interviews) to understand the design space. Then, generative research methods (e. g., affinity diagrams, personas, stakeholder maps, and service blueprints) led to the identification of key service improvement areas: organizational structure, increase revenue, infrastructure, user-centered park policies and communications. The area of communications was chosen for further exploration, due to its potential as a first step in transforming the parks and affecting the other service improvement areas. Another round of communications-centered exploratory and generative research (e. g., benchmarking and speed dating) was completed, resulting in a new service ecology and communications system proposal for Allegheny County Parks. A portion of the new communications system, specifically a responsive website design for mobile, tablet and desktop platforms, was prototyped.

50|$|Francesco de' Medici's heir, {{his brother}} Ferdinando, was persuaded {{to part with}} the Francini {{brothers}} in 1597 by his niece Maria, married to Henri IV of France. Their first project, begun in 1598, was to provide fountains, grottoes, waterworks and, above all, water-driven automata for the series of garden terraces at Saint-Germain-en-Laye. The main feature {{there was a great}} fountain, from which water was channeled and conducted in siphon tubes to the reservoir in the vaulted area that supported the terrace. From there, through a series of secondary tubes, the water had sufficient head to operate grotto fountains and animate the elaborate automata that were a prized feature of Francini jeux d'eau. The upper grottoes on the third terrace opened from a Doric gallery and featured a dragon, a water organ and Neptune; on the next level, the Grotto of Hercules was flanked by two further grottoes; that on one side was devoted to Perseus and Andromeda, in which the delicately counterbalanced hero was made to descend from the ceiling by the hidden weight of water and slay a dragon that arose from the basin, and on the other a Grotto of Orpheus. The only trace of these features, whose high <b>maintenance</b> requirements <b>cut</b> their careers short when the court moved permanently to Fontainebleau, are in some engravings by Abraham Bosse, apparently derived from Francini drawings. The waterworks and automata at Saint-Germain-en-Laye were the most elaborate such things that had been seen in France up to that time, and Alexandre Francini's engravings of the brothers' works served to mark a distinct stage in the importation and transformation of Italian features {{in the creation of the}} French formal garden (Adams 1979:46) and far beyond: cast-iron versions of Francini's two-basin Fontaine rustique, dripping with stony icicles, were familiar features again in Victorian gardens.|$|R
