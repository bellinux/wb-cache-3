5|$|The Battle of Schellenberg {{was part}} of the Grand Alliance's {{campaign}} of 1704 to prevent the Franco-Bavarian army from threatening Vienna, the capital of Habsburg Austria. The campaign began in earnest on 19 May when the Duke of Marlborough began his 250-mile (400km) <b>march</b> <b>from</b> Bedburg near Cologne towards the Elector of Bavaria's and Marshal Marsin's Franco-Bavarian army on the Danube. Marlborough had initially deceived the French commanders– Marshal Villeroi in the Spanish Netherlands and Marshal Tallard along the Rhine– into thinking his target was Alsace or the Moselle farther to the north. However, when the Elector was notified on 5 June of Marlborough's <b>march</b> <b>from</b> the Low Countries, he had correctly predicted that it was his principality of Bavaria that was the Allies' real target.|$|E

5|$|Acting on James Bevel's {{call for}} a <b>march</b> <b>from</b> Selma to Montgomery, King, Bevel, and the SCLC, in partial {{collaboration}} with SNCC, attempted to organize the march to the state's capital. The first attempt to march on March 7, 1965, was aborted because of mob and police violence against the demonstrators. This day {{has become known as}} Bloody Sunday and was a major turning point in the effort to gain public support for the Civil Rights Movement. It was the clearest demonstration up to that time of the dramatic potential of King's nonviolence strategy. King, however, was not present.|$|E
5|$|Carey also {{requested}} that the Sounders have their own marching band, {{the first of its}} kind in MLS. This led to the creation of the Sound Wave, a 53-member marching band consisting of brass and marching percussion. The band plays music from multiple genres, such as Latin, rock and pop, and sits on the north end of CenturyLink Field. The March to the Match, in which fans <b>march</b> <b>from</b> Occidental Park to CenturyLink Field before each home match, has been accompanied by the Sound Wave.|$|E

5|$|In January 2010, Metacritic editor Jason Dietz {{undertook}} a {{statistical analysis of}} whether films released in that month were, as perceived, inferior. He compared the site's aggregate scores, based on critical and audience consensus, for films released in January, February, and <b>March</b> <b>from</b> 2000 to 2009. January averaged the fewest releases of the three, and the lowest average scores. Of the 88 films released {{in the first month}} of the year during that decade, only six earned above a 61 average on the site's scale of 0 to 100, the lowest of any of the three winter months, even accounting for the increase in releases as the spring becomes closer.|$|E

The organist at the funeral was Louis Lefébure-Wély. The funeral procession to Père Lachaise Cemetery, which included Chopin's sister Ludwika, was led by the aged Prince Adam Czartoryski. The pallbearers included Delacroix, Franchomme, and Camille Pleyel. At the graveside, the Funeral <b>March</b> <b>from</b> Chopin's Piano Sonata No. 2 was played, in Reber's instrumentation.|$|E

5|$|On August 23, von Steuben arrested Hazen for halting his brigade on a march without permission.

Hazen was acquitted of the charges, and promptly countercharged von Steuben with conduct unbecoming an officer over the incident; von Steuben apologized.|$|E
5|$|Pierce {{was finally}} {{allowed to return}} to Concord in late December 1847. He was given a hero's welcome in his home state and issued his {{resignation}} from the Army, which was approved on March 20, 1848. His military exploits elevated his popularity in New Hampshire, but his injuries and subsequent troubles in battle led to accusations of cowardice which would long follow him. He had demonstrated competence as a general, especially in the initial <b>march</b> <b>from</b> Vera Cruz, but his short tenure and his injury left little for historians to judge his ability as a military commander.|$|E

The divisional cavalry battalion did not receive sufficient horses, and had to deploy on foot as infantry.

5|$|A second division, the 21st Panzer, {{moved into}} the area in May 1944. One of its regiments, the 125th Panzergrenadier, {{commanded}} by Colonel Hans von Luck, was billeted at Vimont just east of Caen. There was also a battalion of the 192nd Panzergrenadier Regiment based at Cairon {{to the west of}} the bridges. Colonel von Luck trained his regiment in anti-invasion operations. He also identified likely incursion points and marked out forward routes, rest and refuelling areas and anti-aircraft gun positions. The 21st Panzer Division was a new formation based on the former Afrika Korps unit, which had been destroyed in North Africa. Although equipped with an assortment of older tanks and other armoured vehicles, the division's officers were veterans and 2,000 men from the old division filled its ranks. Further afield were the 12th SS Panzer Division at Lisieux and the Panzer Lehr Division at Chartres, both less than a day's <b>march</b> <b>from</b> the area.|$|E
