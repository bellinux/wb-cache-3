5|$|McLeod {{syndrome}} is very rare. There are approximately 150 cases of McLeod syndrome worldwide. Because of its X-linked mode of inheritance, {{it is much}} <b>more</b> <b>prevalent</b> in males.|$|E
5|$|This {{practice}} {{of using a}} variety of clarinets to achieve coloristic variety was common in 20th-century classical music and continues today. However, many clarinetists and conductors prefer to play parts originally written for obscure instruments on B or E clarinets, which are often of better quality and <b>more</b> <b>prevalent</b> and accessible.|$|E
5|$|A {{well-documented}} {{example is}} found in the Amish migration to Pennsylvania in 1744. Two members of the new colony shared the recessive allele for Ellis–van Creveld syndrome. Members of the colony and their descendants tend to be religious isolates and remain relatively insular. As a result of many generations of inbreeding, Ellis-van Creveld syndrome is now much <b>more</b> <b>prevalent</b> among the Amish than in the general population.|$|E
5000|$|Over half of {{his film}} {{appearances}} were uncredited and, consistent with casting <b>mores</b> <b>prevalent</b> during the era, his roles consisted of shoeshine men, servants, porters, janitors, stablehands and slaves. He was, however, continually employed, averaging from six to eleven films per year. A story in a 1933 issue of the Los Angeles-based African American newspaper, California Eagle, stated that he [...] "is reported to be the highest paid Negro actor in Hollywood".|$|R
5000|$|However, Lorenz {{does not}} state that {{aggressive}} behaviors are {{in any way}} <b>more</b> powerful, <b>prevalent,</b> or intense than more peaceful behaviors such as mating rituals. Rather, he negates the categorization of aggression as [...] "contrary" [...] to [...] "positive" [...] instincts like love, depicting it as a founding basis of other instincts {{and its role in}} animal communication.|$|R
50|$|Sri Lankans in the United Kingdom {{predominantly}} {{come from}} Tamil heritage, {{which has led}} to a situation where Christianity is <b>more</b> statistically <b>prevalent</b> among the community than Buddhism, but the unique manner in how Christians kept traditional Hindu Sri Lankan Tamil culture and simply imposed the laws of the Christian Bible has meant that religious divisions between Hindus and Christians are not stark.|$|R
5|$|Agaricus hondensis {{mushrooms}} are toxic, and consuming the fruit bodies causes gastroenteritis. Some fruit bodies smell of creosote, an odor that becomes even <b>more</b> <b>prevalent</b> if the {{mushrooms are}} cooked. Cooking also introduces an unpleasant soapy-metallic flavor. The fruit bodies {{are used as}} food by the vagrant shrew (Sorex vagrans) and the American shrew mole (Neurotrichus gibbsii). Relatively high levels of the chemical hydroquinone are present in fruit bodies.|$|E
5|$|As Yelp {{became more}} influential, the {{practice}} of fake reviews written by competitors or business owners became <b>more</b> <b>prevalent.</b> A study from Harvard professor Michael Luca analyzed 316,415 reviews in Boston and found that fake reviews rose from 6% of the site's reviews in 2006 to 20% in 2014. Yelp's own review filter identifies 25% of reviews as suspicious.|$|E
5|$|Behavioural and neuropsychiatric changes become <b>more</b> <b>prevalent.</b> Common manifestations are wandering, {{irritability}} and labile affect, {{leading to}} crying, outbursts of unpremeditated aggression, or resistance to caregiving. Sundowning can also appear. Approximately 30% {{of people with}} AD develop illusionary misidentifications and other delusional symptoms. Subjects also lose insight of their disease process and limitations (anosognosia). Urinary incontinence can develop. These symptoms create stress for relatives and carers, which can be reduced by moving the person from home care to other long-term care facilities.|$|E
5000|$|Inadequate {{funding of}} honors colleges and {{programs}} {{can lead to}} a system of borrowing faculty members from elsewhere within an institution, which, on one level, has the effect of [...] undergraduates who are not in the program. Notwithstanding concerns over funding, honors programs, initially (in the early 1960s), served as less costly alternatives to scholarships when competing for exceptional students. However, as programs have evolved, scholarships have become <b>more</b> universally <b>prevalent.</b>|$|R

50|$|The {{diagnosis}} is clinically {{made on the}} basis of the history of typical attacks, especially in patients from the ethnic groups in which FMF is <b>more</b> highly <b>prevalent.</b> An acute phase response is present during attacks, with high C-reactive protein levels, an elevated white blood cell count and other markers of inflammation. In patients with a long history of attacks, monitoring the kidney function is of importance in predicting chronic kidney failure.|$|R
5|$|Melbourne is {{the second}} busiest airport in Australia. The airport is curfew-free and {{operates}} 24 hours a day, although between 2am and 4am, freight aircraft are <b>more</b> <b>prevalent</b> than passenger flights. In 2004, the environmental management systems were accredited ISO 14001, the world's best practice standard, making it the first airport in Australia to receive such accreditation.|$|E
5|$|The {{district}} is largely Christian at 56.5%, {{with no other}} religion reaching more than 0.7%. These figures generally compare with the national averages, though the non-religious, at 32.7%, are significantly <b>more</b> <b>prevalent</b> than the national 25.67%. 83.9% of residents rated their health as good or very good, {{higher than the national}} level (81.40%); nationally, 18% of people describe themselves as having a long-term illness; in Bath it is 16.10%.|$|E
5|$|The small {{water courses}} that flow {{radially}} {{from the northern}} direction into the lake, which are seasonal streams, abound in lichens. Mosses are found but are <b>more</b> <b>prevalent</b> on {{the northern end of}} Poseidon Lake. In the region as a whole, 23 species of lichens and six moss species have been recorded.|$|E
50|$|In the 1930s, Battaglia {{worked in}} a flowing, deco-influenced, organic style {{informed}} by classic European illustration.

30|$|By {{examining}} {{the sources of}} wage growth in Indonesia, {{we have found that}} they are quite different from the sources of wage growth in developed countries. Additional research is required to determine whether this pattern is specific to Indonesia or is <b>more</b> generally <b>prevalent</b> across other developing countries. Future research should also investigate the reasons why sources of wage growth in developing countries such as Indonesia differ from sources of wage growth in developed countries. Such an investigation is fundamental to further our understanding of income growth in developing countries.|$|R
5|$|This {{species is}} found in the Pacific Northwest region of North America where it grows on large (at least 1m diameter) {{specimens}} of noble fir (Abies procera), Pacific silver fir (Abies amabilis), or western hemlock (Tsuga heterophylla). Bridgeoporus nobilissimus causes a brown rot in its tree hosts. Genetic analysis shows that the fungus is <b>more</b> <b>prevalent</b> than fruit body distribution indicates.|$|E
5|$|While {{the period}} when the name Cabernet Sauvignon became <b>more</b> <b>prevalent</b> over Petite Vidure is not certain, records {{indicate}} that the grape was a popular Bordeaux planting in the 18th century Médoc region. The first estates known to have actively grown the variety (and the likely source of Cabernet vines for other estates) were Château Mouton and Château d'Armailhac in Pauillac.|$|E
5|$|A {{total of}} 51 species of {{parasitic}} worm {{have been recovered}} from the American white ibis, predominantly from the gastrointestinal system and particularly the small intestine. These include Cestoda (tapeworms), Acanthocephala (thorny headed worms), Nematoda (roundworms), Digenea and Spirurida. Several roundworm and spirurid species {{have been found in}} the lining of the gizzard. Nematodes are <b>more</b> <b>prevalent</b> in American white ibis from freshwater habitats, and cestodes more frequent in those from saltwater areas. One nematode found in adult birds, Skrjabinoclavia thapari, is borne in the fiddler crab as an intermediate host, while the thorny headed worm species Southwellina dimorpha is carried in crayfish and infests both adult and juvenile ibis.|$|E

50|$|In {{cases where}} a {{large-scale}} audience is unknowingly {{witness to a}} miscarriage of justice, the news-consuming public may develop false beliefs {{about the nature of}} crime itself. It may also cause the public to falsely believe that certain types of crime exist, or that certain types of people tend to commit these crimes, or that certain crimes are <b>more</b> commonly <b>prevalent</b> than they actually are. Thus, wrongful convictions can ultimately mold a society's popular beliefs about crime. Because our understanding of crime is socially constructed, it has been shaped by many factors other than its actual occurrence.|$|R
25|$|One of {{the most}} debated issues {{relating}} to ethnic conflict is whether it has become <b>more</b> or less <b>prevalent</b> in the post–Cold War period. At {{the end of the}} Cold War, academics including Samuel P. Huntington and Robert D. Kaplan predicted a proliferation of conflicts fueled by civilisational clashes, Tribalism, resource scarcity and overpopulation.|$|R
5|$|Cardiovascular {{diseases}}, {{which include}} {{diseases of the}} heart, are {{the leading cause of}} death worldwide. The majority of cardiovascular disease is noncommunicable and related to lifestyle and other factors, becoming <b>more</b> <b>prevalent</b> with ageing. Heart disease is a major cause of death, accounting for an average of 30% of all deaths in 2008, globally. This rate varies from a lower 28% to a high 40% in high-income countries. Doctors that specialise in the heart are called cardiologists. Many other medical professionals are involved in treating diseases of the heart, including doctors such as general practitioners, cardiothoracic surgeons and intensivists, and allied health practitioners including physiotherapists and dieticians.|$|E
5|$|Contamination {{by water}} during filling {{may be due}} to two causes. Inadequate {{filtration}} and drying of the compressed air can introduce small quantities of fresh water condensate, or an emulsion of water and compressor lubricant, and failing to clear the cylinder valve orifice of water which may have dripped from wet dive gear, which can allow contamination by fresh or seawater. Both cause corrosion, but seawater contamination can cause a cylinder to corrode rapidly {{to the extent that it}} may be unsafe or condemned after even a fairly short period. This problem is exacerbated in hot climates, where chemical reactions are faster, and is <b>more</b> <b>prevalent</b> where filling staff are badly trained or overworked.|$|E
5|$|Heart {{disease is}} listed by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services {{as the number}} one {{cause of death for}} all women. Factors that add to risk of heart disease include obesity and smoking, both of which are <b>more</b> <b>prevalent</b> in lesbians. Studies show that lesbians have a higher body mass and are {{generally}} less concerned about weight issues than heterosexual women, and lesbians consider women with higher body masses to be more attractive than heterosexual women do. Lesbians are more likely to exercise regularly than heterosexual women, and lesbians do not generally exercise for aesthetic reasons, although heterosexual women do. Research is needed to determine specific causes of obesity in lesbians.|$|E

5|$|Hospices: While late {{referral}} to hospice {{is a much}} <b>more</b> <b>prevalent</b> problem than early referral, some hospice providers will hesitate to admit patients to hospice (or they may de-certify them from hospice too early) due to scrutiny from Medicare for patients deemed to be on hospice too long. After a patient has been on hospice for six months, Medicare is more aggressive in auditing the hospice for inappropriate payment of services. For some hospices this is simply not worth the trouble, and patients are screened very carefully prior to admission.|$|E
5|$|In Canada, {{there was}} little {{emphasis}} on football, much to the disappointment of Rex. By the time Rex was a teenager, Doris realized he and his brothers were too much to handle for a single mother trying to advance her career. She decided {{it was in the}} best interest of the brothers to send them to live with their father, who was the defensive line coach for the Minnesota Vikings at the time. The reasons behind this were to keep them out of trouble and to help them expand their knowledge of the game of football where it was <b>more</b> <b>prevalent.</b>|$|E
5|$|Layers {{deposited}} {{during the}} Pleistocene epoch, starting around two million years ago, cover most of eastern South Dakota. These are the youngest rock and sediment layers in the state, {{and are the}} product of several successive periods of glaciation which deposited a large amount of rocks and soil, known as till, over the area. The thickness of the glacial till layer ranges between 100 and 900 feet (30 and 270 m). This till is also what makes agriculture <b>more</b> <b>prevalent</b> in eastern South Dakota as it is extremely fertile.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: As {{computers}} become <b>more</b> {{powerful and}} <b>prevalent,</b> <b>more</b> researchers are exploring computer tools to help novices gain an understanding into new work domains. The development of such tools involves {{what has been}} termed a “learner-centered design ” process. But while there is an intuitive notion of {{what is meant by}} learner-centered design, there is no formal definition. Here we present our definition of learner-centered design, a definition formed by extending the definition for the traditional “user-centered design ” approach. Specifically, we define “learnercentered design ” in terms of its target audience, the problems it addresses, and the underlying approach for addressing those problems. From a software development viewpoint, by presenting a more formal definition, we hope to not only better describe what we mean by learner-centered software, but also provide a base by which we can explore more structured design methods for developing and implementing effective learner-centered software...|$|R
