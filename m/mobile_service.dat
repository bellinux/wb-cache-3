Later that month, TNA began to promote a 10 knockout gauntlet match to be held on October 14, 2007 at TNA's Bound for Glory PPV event to crown the first-ever TNA Women's Champion. At the event, Gail Kim defeated Ms. Brooks, Christy Hemme, Awesome Kong, Roxxi Laveaux, Talia Madison, Shelly Martinez, Jackie Moore, ODB, and Angel Williams {{to become the first}} champion.

5|$|Concepts {{for a third}} {{installment}} in the Parasite Eve {{video game}} series had been around for some time. As work was being finished on , Nomura voiced his wish {{to create a new}} game for the character Aya Brea, and this time it was taken up. Despite the story of Parasite Eve II not leaving many avenues for a sequel, the development team wanted to take advantage of advancing gaming technology and popularity by creating a mature gaming experience that would re-introduce Aya to players around the world. The main staff consisted of director Hajime Tabata, producer Yoshinori Kitase, creative producer and character designer Tetsuya Nomura, art director Isamu Kamikokuryo, scenario director Motomu Toriyama, and main writer Toshimitsu Takeuchi. Nomura requested Tabata as the two had worked well together on previous projects, and Nomura was busy with other projects despite his strong interest. The 3rd Birthday was originally announced in May 2007 as an episodic mobile game developed by Square Enix for Japan's FOMA <b>mobile</b> <b>service.</b> In 2008, during a special Square Enix event, the game was announced to have changed to a game for the PlayStation Portable. Part of the reason, as stated by Nomura, was that the desired level of realism was not possible on mobile phones. The game became exclusive to PSP as Tabata wanted to make full usage of the platform's hardware capabilities, along with it being a gaming platform available worldwide. Tabata and his team worked on The 3rd Birthday {{at the same time as}} fellow mobile-turned-PSP title Final Fantasy Type-0. Square Enix requested Tabata to concentrate on finishing The 3rd Birthday, leading to Type-0 almost being cancelled.|$|E

A second objective is to investigate the reasons for using/not using <b>mobile</b> <b>services.</b> In-depth focus group interviews and secondary empirical data provide the main data. Concerning the youth’s general knowledge of and interest in <b>mobile</b> <b>services,</b> the results point to six things: young people show a low demand for many <b>mobile</b> <b>services,</b> there is a demand for extended, established <b>mobile</b> <b>services,</b> like SMS, the interest in the new services vary, there is low interest in active information search, there is little knowledge of the enabling technology, and the understanding of the pricing is generally low. As concerns reasons for and against usage of <b>mobile</b> <b>services,</b> results point to four central aspects: many individuals could present clearly defined needs for certain services, many indicated an interest in "community usage" of <b>mobile</b> <b>services,</b> they experienced the prices of <b>mobile</b> <b>services</b> to be a hinder for usage, and technology placed limitations on the usage.

They are also different from traditional interpersonal services that are delivered face-to-face, or from other types of e-services, such as wireless online services, where the service delivery is linked to a specific fixed local area network or specific location. Although an increasing number of academic studies are starting to focus on <b>mobile</b> <b>services</b> from a service management perspective, rather than a technology perspective, formal classifications or categorizations of <b>mobile</b> <b>services</b> are still scarce. The aim of the paper is to develop a conceptual classification for <b>mobile</b> <b>services</b> that depicts the special nature of <b>mobile</b> <b>services</b> and gives indications how to categorize services from a customer centric perspective.

40|$|Abstract — To date, <b>mobile</b> <b>services</b> {{have failed}} to match the {{explosive}} growth of the Web. This, we argue, is because current <b>mobile</b> <b>services</b> are difficult to find, to use, to trust, to design and deploy. The IST SMS (Simple <b>Mobile</b> <b>Services)</b> project takes up the challenge of creating innovative tools addressing {{the specific needs of}} mobile users and making it easier for individuals and small businesses to become providers of Simple <b>Mobile</b> <b>Services.</b> We hope that, thanks to SMS, a large base of people can create Simple <b>Mobile</b> <b>Services,</b> like it happened for the Web, where creating a web page is within the reach of non-expert users. In this paper, we first focus on one of the facets of SMS: service authoring tools. We highlight the importance of powerful authoring tools, to speed up and reduce the cost of service development.

40|$|<b>Mobile</b> <b>services</b> are a {{relatively}} new phenomenon and provide {{a great opportunity to}} the tourism industry. The information technology within the tourism industry is under constant development and self-service technologies (SST) such as the Internet are widely used.
