5|$|Ship {{camouflage}} {{was used}} in earnest by the British Admiralty in the First World War. The marine artist Norman Wilkinson led research into dazzle camouflage, resulting in the painting of thousands of British and later American ships in dazzle patterns. He intended it not to make ships invisible, nor even to cause the enemy to <b>miss</b> <b>his</b> shot, but to deceive him into taking up a poor firing position. In the Second World War, dazzle was revisited by the Royal Navy and the United States Navy, and applied to a limited extent by other navies.|$|E
5|$|He {{began to}} feel pain in his lower back shortly {{after the end of}} his junior season. In May 2011, while {{attending}} a basketball camp at the Deron Williams Academy in Chicago, Arcidiacono complained of poor mobility and soreness. He was diagnosed with a herniated disk in his back, forcing him to <b>miss</b> <b>his</b> senior season. Arcidiacono had surgery to repair the disk on December 21, and he could not leave his house for two weeks thereafter. Arcidiacono finished his career at Neshaminy High School as the program's all-time leading scorer. He tallied 1,498 points, 449 rebounds, 378 assists, 178 steals, and 160 three-pointers. Despite missing the season, ESPNU ranked him among the top 50 seniors in the country.|$|E

5|$|A month {{into the}} 2008–09 season, Luongo began a shutout streak that lasted three {{games against the}} Nashville Predators, Phoenix Coyotes, and the Minnesota Wild, akin to the feat he {{accomplished}} in the same month of November the previous year. His overall shutout streak was snapped at 242:36 minutes, in a 2–1 shootout loss against the Colorado Avalanche, surpassing the Canucks record he set the previous season. Later that month, on November 22, Luongo left a game versus the Pittsburgh Penguins after suffering an adductor strain in his groin. Initially listed as week-to-week, he attempted what was considered an early comeback within {{two weeks of the}} injury, but suffered a setback during a team practice on December 10, leaving early in discomfort. After missing 24 games, Luongo made his return on January 15, 2009, in a 4–1 loss to the Phoenix Coyotes. While injured, Luongo was chosen for the fourth time to the NHL All-Star Game in 2009 as the lone Canucks representative. Despite speculation he would have to <b>miss</b> <b>his</b> second straight All-Star Game, Luongo recovered in time and took part in a 12–11 shootout loss to the Eastern Conference. He finished the season with back-to-back shutouts in the final two games against the Los Angeles Kings and Colorado Avalanche to establish a new career-high of nine shutouts on the season, breaking Dan Cloutier's previous franchise single-season shutout record of seven, set in 2001–02.|$|E

5|$|Capel {{enrolled}} at the University of Texas in 1981, but did not play baseball, as stretched ligaments in his elbow forced him to <b>miss</b> <b>his</b> freshman season. Capel pitched sidearmed {{for the remainder of}} his collegiate career to compensate for a loss in the velocity of his fastball. In 1982, he was named to the All-Southwest Conference team and pitched to a 9–0 win–loss record with a 3.68 ERA, as the Longhorns finished 59–6. His 1982 winning percentage of 1.000 ties him with 10 others for the best single-season winning percentage in Longhorns history (with a minimum of nine decisions). At the 1982 College World Series, Texas defeated the Oklahoma State Cowboys and the Stanford Cardinal, but losses to the Miami Hurricanes and the Wichita State Shockers eliminated them from play per the tournament's double-elimination format. Capel played on the United States team in the 1982 Amateur World Series overseen by the International Baseball Federation. Starting against Australia, he pitched a 14–4 complete game victory, as the match ended after seven innings per the championship's ten-run rule. The United States eventually placed third in the competition.|$|E
5|$|Manager Johnny Duncan {{identified}} Revie as {{the player}} {{to build his}} team around for the 1947–48 and 1948–49 seasons, and though the Foxes fared poorly in the league they managed to reach the 1949 FA Cup Final. Revie scored the opening goal of the semi-final victory over First Division champions Portsmouth, having being told pre-match that opposition goalkeeper Ernest Butler tended to palm the ball over the attacker's head before reclaiming possession Revie positioned himself {{to take advantage of}} the situation when teammate Jack Lee challenged Butler for the ball, leaving Revie with a simple conversion. However Revie suffered a nasal haemorrhage caused by a burst vein one week before the final, and the condition became so severe it would threaten his life and see him <b>miss</b> <b>his</b> first chance to play at Wembley. He could only listen on the radio as Leicester lost 3–1 to Wolverhampton Wanderers in the final. Revie decided to leave Leicester after Duncan left the club, having already been dissatisfied with the club's lack of progress in the league.|$|E

25|$|Driving to Champion Stadium for {{the first}} day of {{workouts}} for pitchers and catchers, Braves starter Tommy Hanson was involved in a one-car accident that caused him to bump his head around seven in the morning on February 20, 2012. After arriving at the stadium, Hanson informed the medical staff of the incident, stating that he was feeling abnormal. Seeking medical attention, Hanson was diagnosed with a Grade 1 concussion, providing a delay in his Spring workouts. The Braves medical staff performed several concussion impact tests on Hanson to gauge when a return to normal workouts would be appropriate. Hanson did not expect to <b>miss</b> <b>his</b> first start of the regular season. After a full recovery and ample time for preparation during Spring training, Hanson was assigned as the Opening Day starter, making his first start against the New York Mets on April 5.|$|E

25|$|After an {{inconclusive}} year in pinstripes, New York fans {{hoped that}} Johnson {{would return to}} his dominant style in his second Yankee season. Johnson began 2006 well, but then he struggled to find form. In between some impressive performances, he allowed 5 or more runs in 7 of his first 18 starts for the season. Johnson was more effective in the second half. Johnson finished {{the season with a}} 17–11 record, a subpar 5.00 ERA with 172 strikeouts. It had been revealed {{at the end of the}} 2006 season that a herniated disc in Johnson's back had been stiffening him and it was only in his second to last start of the season that he decided to get it checked. This exposure had caused him to <b>miss</b> <b>his</b> last start of 2006. After being given epidural anesthesia and a few bullpen sessions he was cleared to start in game 3 of the ALDS, however he gave up 5 runs in 5 innings.|$|E
25|$|Samonas's own downfall, however, {{would come}} soon after. In 907, {{in a bid}} to ingratiate himself with Leo's fourth wife, Zoe Karbonopsina, he {{presented}} her with a gift in the person of his own eunuch servant, Constantine Barbaros. As the imperial couple took an increased liking to Constantine, however, Samonas began to fear for his own influence and position. He first claimed that Constantine and the empress were having an affair. Leo initially believed the accusations, and had Constantine banished to a monastery. Soon, however, Leo began to <b>miss</b> <b>his</b> new favourite, and had him restored to his service in the palace. Samonas then resorted to another scheme: with his secretary, he produced a pamphlet, supposedly written by Constantine, which insulted the emperor, and arranged for Leo to read it. His machinations, however, were betrayed by one of his fellow conspirators, and Samonas was dismissed, tonsured, and banished to the monastery of Martinakios in summer of 908. Constantine succeeded him as imperial parakoimomenos. Nothing further is known of him.|$|E
25|$|Schumacher and Benetton, {{along with}} three other drivers, were summoned to a FIA World Motor Sport Council meeting on July 26 to discuss his black flag at the British Grand Prix. It was {{announced}} at the meeting that Schumacher was disqualified from the race, thus losing his six points he earned from finishing second in the race, and in addition he was handed a two race ban. This meant Schumacher would <b>miss</b> <b>his</b> home race, the German Grand Prix, along with the Hungarian Grand Prix, unless he chose to appeal the decision. In addition to the punishment handed to Schumacher, Benetton were fined a total of $600,000—$500,000 for not listening to the Stewards' at the British race, and $100,000 for not sending copies of their engine management system when immediately requested. At the council meeting, the governing body also announced that no evidence had been found to suggest Benetton were using illegal electronic systems, but did say that an illegal system did exist, which could be activated at any time. Benetton and Schumacher appealed the decision made by the FIA, allowing the German to race at his home Grand Prix.|$|E
