25|$|The {{advantages}} of <b>manure</b> <b>treatment</b> are {{a reduction in}} the amount of manure that needs to be transported and applied to crops, as well as reduced soil compaction. Nutrients are reduced as well, meaning that less cropland is needed for manure to be spread upon. <b>Manure</b> <b>treatment</b> can also reduce the risk of human health and biosecurity risks by reducing the amount of pathogens present in manure. Undiluted animal manure or slurry is one hundred times more concentrated than domestic sewage, and can carry an intestinal parasite, Cryptosporidium, which is difficult to detect but can be passed to humans. Silage liquor (from fermented wet grass) is even stronger than slurry, with a low pH and very high biological oxygen demand. With a low pH, silage liquor can be highly corrosive; it can attack synthetic materials, causing damage to storage equipment, and leading to accidental spillage. All of these advantages can be optimized by using the right manure management system on the right farm based on the resources that are available.|$|E

40|$|On 1 January 2014 {{a system}} of {{compulsory}} <b>manure</b> <b>treatment</b> {{was introduced in the}} Netherlands. All livestock farmers with a manure surplus (expressed in kg phosphate) are required to have part of this manure surplus treated.

This report presents the results of the analysis of the calculated <b>manure</b> <b>treatment</b> percentages per region for 2018, under different assumptions. These percentages are based on an empirical analysis of the manure production per region in 2016 and an analysis of the maximum permitted manure allocation (in kg phosphate) and expected actual manure input per region in 2017. The analyses take account of the effects of redistribution of manure between farms within and between regions, and of exemptions from the compulsory <b>manure</b> <b>treatment</b> regulation. The total amount of manure to be treated in 2018 is 45 ± 5 kg phosphate. The <b>manure</b> <b>treatment</b> percentages in the ‘baseline’ variant are 10 % for the region ‘Other’ (minimum <b>manure</b> <b>treatment</b> percentage), 55 % for the region ‘East’, 62 % the region ‘South’, and 47 % for the whole of the Netherlands.

This analysis used data from a survey of various stakeholders engaged in <b>manure</b> <b>treatment</b> in four European countries (Denmark, Italy, the Netherlands and Spain) that have large areas of high animal density, but diverse socio-economic, political and environmental conditions.

Processing manure to produce bioenergy was considered important in Denmark and Italy, but less important in Spain and the Netherlands. The major barriers to technology adoption were related to economic factors -lack of investment capital (60 % of respondents), high processing cost (52 %) and a long payback period (45 %), while there was relatively little concern regarding transport and noise burden and health risks. Slurry separation and anaerobic digestion were perceived to have the greatest potential for a common adoption.

Firstly, root and/or stem nodulation, nitrogen fixation (acetylene-reducing activity), growth and N accumulation of S. rostrata as affected by inoculation site were studied in a pot experiment. The growth and N accumulation of S. rostrata in stem inoculation treatment was the highest.

The greatest NEE was observed on urea treatments (with a CO 2 uptake of − 4. 4 g CO 2 m− 2 h− 1). Total C and DOC were significantly greater in <b>manure</b> <b>treatments</b> in the soil surface (0 – 10 cm). Of the C added in the manures, 27...|$|R

The {{success of a}} phytoextraction process depends on adequate plant yield (aerial parts) and high metal concentrations in plant shoots. A pot experiment was conducted to investigate the combination effects of plants [sunflower (Helianthus annuus) and canola (Brassica napus) ] with soil <b>treatments</b> (<b>manure,</b> sulfuric acid and DTPA). Treatments, including two plants and seven soil treatments, which applied according to completely randomized factorial design with three replications. The largest shoot dry weight biomass production occurred in <b>manure</b> <b>treatments</b> for both plants. The maximum shoot concentrations of Pb and Zn were 234. 6 and 1364. 4 mg kg− 1 respectively in three mmoles DTPA kg− 1 treatment of sunflower.

40|$|This study {{aimed to}} analyze the effect of Tithonia diversifolia green manure and cow manure on soil quality and yield of cauliflower. A field {{experiment}} was conducted {{in the village of}} Tegalgondo, Karangploso District of Malang Regency. Eight treatments tested were control (no added manures), T. diversifolia 8. 15 t/ha, cow manure 25. 85 t/ha, NPK fertilizer 1. 35 t/ha, T. diversifolia 4. 08 t/ha + cow manure 12. 93 t/ha, T. diversifolia 4. 08 t/ha + NPK fertilizer 676 kg/ha, cow manure 12. 93 t/ha + NPK 676 kg/ha and T. diversifolia 2. 69 t/ha + cow manure 8. 53 t/ha + NPK fertilizer 446 kg/ha. Soil quality was monitored at top soil (0 - 20 cm) at planting time and 30 days after planting. Soil samples were collected and analyzed for chemical and physical properties. Yield of cauliflower was observed at the time of harvest or 44 days after planting. The results showed that application of green manure could significantly change the physical and chemical properties of the soil. The decrease of bulk density of about 27. 47 %, increase of organic carbon of about 12. 60 %, increase of total N of about 53. 87 %, increase of available P of about 64. 24 mg/kg, and exchangeable K of about 8. 34 cmol/kg were observed in T. diversifolia treatment. The increase of pH of about 1. 75 %, and total porosity of about 17. 73 % was found in cow <b>manure</b> <b>treatments.</b> The increased water holding capacity of about 10. 70 % was found in T. diversifolia + cow <b>manure</b> <b>treatments</b> and increased stability aggregate about 23. 54 % was found in T. diversifolia + cow <b>manure</b> + NPK <b>treatments.</b> There was a significant increase of fresh weight of flower about 666. 67 g/plant in T. diversifolia + NPK treatment...|$|R
