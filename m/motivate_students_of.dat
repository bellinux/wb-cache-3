40|$|Introduction: {{the article}} {{describes}} the development of educational institutions {{for the needs of}} the regional economy in Russia. The focus is on students’ understanding of their careers, early identification of their professional trajectory and intensive development of future professional competencies for local labor market. This process underscores the diversification of the universities’ educational space, the integration of general, higher and further education programmes. The purpose of the article is to model the integrative pre-university educational space based on the synthesis of form al, informal and informational education. Materials and Methods: the integrative approach as a theoretical and methodological strategy allows exploring the various structures of pre-university education and improving the quality of schooling in conjunction with the system, activity, competence, and synergetic approaches. The author reviewed the scholarly and methodological literature on the topic, compared, summarised, structured and modeled the data. In addition, they studied leading pedagogical experience and used the expert assessment method. Results: the developed University lyceum model as a fundamental structure of continuous formation integrating resources and scientific and educational potential of the general, professional and additional education of the region is presented. The organization of network partnership as a method of an integration interaction contributes to the inclusion in the educational process of various actors of continuing education. It ensures the effectiveness of the conscious professional self-determination and self-development of the student’s personality. Discussion and Conclusions: the author expects the proposed model of the pre-university educational institution will allow to <b>motivate</b> <b>students</b> <b>of</b> the lyceum to enter the university. This will contribute to the establishment of the university as a structure-forming component of continuing education in the region.

Curs: 2013 / 2014 This didactic {{unit has}} been {{designed}} {{as an alternative to}} certain tasks that may be found in the traditional didactic units and it contains activities based on poetry. The main objectives are to <b>motivate</b> <b>students</b> <b>of</b> 1 st of Bachillerato to read, write and speak in English through a variety of tasks based on poetry, and encourage teachers to use different teaching methods and techniques. In addition, the purpose of the activities is to enrich students’ curriculum and to reinforce some of their book exercises in order to avoid monotony and loss of interest. For this reason, those teachers who would like to implement the poetry based activities that I have designed may choose those they are most interested in and do not have to follow a specific sequence. Therefore, the teacher decides when to implement a particular activity. The reason why I suggest poetry is because poems are very entertaining to deal with while students constantly work on all skills simultaneously, even though they are not conscious about it sometimes. Poems’ structure makes them easy to read while its rhyme makes them extremely memorable. On top of that poems provoke people to express their personal opinion which is great for working on speaking. Finally, poems are authentic material that due to their appealing structure, rhythm and sound suggest a quick and enjoyable way of learning new vocabulary, revising grammar, improving pronunciation and promoting creativity. Poetry also gives teachers the opportunity to teach emotional intelligence, that is, to discriminate and label different emotions. All that being said, poetry should be given the same chance as other forms of literature...|$|E
