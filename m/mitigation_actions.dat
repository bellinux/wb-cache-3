40|$|Developing model-based {{narratives}} of society’s response {{to climate change}} is challenged by two factors. First, society’s response to possible future climate change is subject to many uncertainties. Second, we argue that society’s <b>mitigation</b> <b>action</b> emerge out of the actions and interactions of the many actors in society. Together, these two factors imply that the overarching dynamics of society’s response to climate change are unpredictable. In contrast to conventional processes of developing scenarios, in this study the emergence of climate change <b>mitigation</b> <b>action</b> by society has been represented in an agent-based model with which we developed two {{narratives of}} the emergence of climate change <b>mitigation</b> <b>action</b> by applying exploratory modelling and analysis. The agent-based model represents a two-level game involving governments and citizens changing their emission behaviour in the face of climate change through <b>mitigation</b> <b>action.</b> Insights gained from the exploration on uncertainties pertaining to the system have been used to construct two internally consistent and plausible narratives on the pathways {{of the emergence of}} <b>mitigation</b> <b>action,</b> which, as we argue, are a reasonable summary of the uncertainty space. The first narrative highlights how and when strong <b>mitigation</b> <b>action</b> emerges while the second narrative highlights how and when weak <b>mitigation</b> <b>action</b> emerges. In contrast to a conventional scenario development process, these two scenarios have been discovered bottom up rather than being defined top down. They succinctly capture the possible outcomes of the emergence of climate change mitigation by society across a large range of uncertain factors. The narratives therefore help in conveying the consequences of the various uncertainties influencing the emergence of climate change <b>mitigation</b> <b>action</b> by society. </p...|$|R

40|$|During {{the past}} two decades, {{community-based}} hazard mitigation (CBHM) has been newly proposed and implemented as an alternative conceptual model for emergency management to deal with disasters comprehensively in order to curtail skyrocketing disaster losses. Local community members have been growingly required to share information and responsibilities for reducing community vulnerabilities to natural and technological hazards and building a safer community. Consequently they are encouraged to join local mitigation programs and volunteer for collective <b>mitigation</b> <b>action,</b> but their contributions vary. This research examined factors associated with Tulsa Project Impact partners?? contributions to collective <b>mitigation</b> <b>action.</b> In the literature review, self-interest and social norms were identified and briefly discussed as two determinants to guide partners?? behavior by reviewing game theoretic frameworks and individual decision-making models. Partners?? collective interest in building a safer community and feelings of obligation to participate in collective <b>mitigation</b> <b>action</b> were also considered for this study. Thus, the major factors considered are: (1) collective interests, (2) selective benefits, (3) participation costs, (4) norms of cooperation, and (5) internalized norms of participation.

It compares energy-system changes and mitigation costs from a global and two national energy-system models under two global emission pathways with medium likelihood of meeting the 2 °C target: a least-cost pathway and a pathway that postpones ambitious <b>mitigation</b> <b>action,</b> starting from the Copenhagen Accord pledges. Both pathways have similar 2010 – 2050 cumulative greenhouse gas emissions. The analysis shows that postponing <b>mitigation</b> <b>action</b> increases the lock-in in less energy efficient technologies and results in much higher cumulative mitigation costs. The models agree that {{carbon capture and storage}} (CCS) and nuclear energy are important mitigation technologies, while the shares of biofuels and other renewables vary largely over the models. Differences between India and China with respect to the timing of emission reductions and the choice of mitigation measures relate to differences in projections of rapid economic change, capital stock turnover and technological development. Furthermore, depending on the way it is implemented, climate policy could increase indoor air pollution, but it is likely to provide synergies for energy security.

Therefore, fast track method has been widely applied in project management as happened in Qunci Villas Project at Lombok and Putri Naga Komodo Project at Loh Liang of Komodo Island. Fast track construction method has potential risks that can interfere {{the success of the}} project. This study aims to identify the risks, especially the mayor risk, to formulate the <b>mitigation</b> <b>action,</b> and to determine the risk ownership. This study was conducted using qualitative descriptive method by identifying the risks arising during the implementation of the fast track method on Qunci Villas and Putri Naga Komodo Projects through the study of literature, brainstorming, interview using questionnaires to those who knew or were involved in the project. So the frequency and magnitude of the consequences of each risk can be known. Then the risk assessment can be conducted to determine the mayor risk and the minor risk. Then determining <b>mitigation</b> <b>action</b> for the mayor risk to reduce the negative impact that may arise. Then allocating the risk ownership in other to the <b>mitigation</b> <b>action</b> can be handled properly. The risk identified totaled 25 risks consisting of : 1 risk (4 %) which was medium risk rating,  6 risks (24 %) which were high risk rating, and 18 risks (72 %) which were extreme risk rating. The mayor risk amounted to 24 risks (96 %). The mayor risk which were high risk rating consisting of : 1 planning risk, 3 technical risks, 1 project risk and 1 criminal risk. While mayor risk which were extreme risk rating consisting of : 5 technical risks, 10 project risks, 2 financial risks, and 1 human risk. <b>Mitigation</b> <b>action</b> were handled by reducing likelihood and consequence.

While an expansion of mitigation responsibility to Non-Annex I countries has been strongly opposed by overarching groups such as the G 77, we find countries such as South Africa and Indonesia that have clearly supported binding commitments.
