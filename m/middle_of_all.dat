5|$|The Russians did {{not believe}} that super firing turrets offered any {{advantage}} as they discounted the value of axial fire, believed that broadside fire was much more important and also believed that super firing turrets could not fire while over the lower turret because of muzzle blast interfering with the open sighting hoods in the lower turret's roof. They therefore designed the ships with a 'linear' arrangement (lineinoe raspolozhenie) of turrets distributed over the length of the ship. This arrangement had several advantages because it reduced the stress on the ends of the ship since the turrets were not concentrated {{at the end of the}} ship, increased stability because the lack of elevated turrets and their barbettes, improved the survivability of the ship because the magazines were separated from each other and gave a lower silhouette. Disadvantages were that the magazines had to be put in the <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> the machinery, which required steam pipes to be run through or around them and the lack of deck space free from blast. This greatly complicated the placement of the anti-torpedo boat guns which ultimately had to be mounted in the hull, closer to the water than was desirable.|$|E

Starting from 1951, pre-1949 Chinese films and Hollywood and Hong Kong productions were banned as the Communist Party of China sought to tighten control over mass media, producing instead movies centering on peasants, soldiers and workers, such as Bridge (1949) and The White Haired Girl (1950).

25|$|After Mickey dies in 2010, Maggie {{begins a}} new {{friendship}} with Victor Kiriakis. The two grow closer, despite Victor's marriage to Vivian Alamain. The vengeful Vivian plots to have Maggie entombed in a crypt in the Kiriakis mausoleum, but as fate has it, ends up there herself. When Vivian is freed, {{she manages to}} entrap Maggie, and for days, her relatives are worried about her absence. Eventually, Victor finds her and she is rushed to the hospital. Maggie is stunned when she discovers that Victor knew Vivian was entrapped and did nothing about it. After Victor demands a divorce from Vivian, he begins to court Maggie. She struggles to accept Victor and his criminal past, but is able to build a relationship with him. Maggie and Victor begin to date and Victor proposes to Maggie in September 2011. During their engagement, Hope comes across a letter from Alice to Maggie, written the day before Alice died. Alice reminds Maggie about an experimental program she and Mickey entered into over thirty years prior, Maggie had attempted to harvest some of her eggs. Eventually she and Mickey abandoned the project, though the eggs were preserved. It was revealed that Daniel Jonas was her biological son, a product of these missing eggs. This also makes Melanie Layton her granddaughter. On November 8, 2011, Victor and Maggie get married. That Christmas Julie tells Maggie that she {{will always be a}} member of the Horton family, and extends an ornament to Victor, Daniel, and Melanie, despite their not being biological Hortons. In 2012, Maggie and Victor experience brief marital trouble when it is revealed that Victor knew about Maggie's missing eggs all those years. Maggie was eventually able to forgive him although she continues to keep him in line when his ruthless ways get the better of him. Maggie also said goodbye to Melanie, who left town. Additionally, Maggie opened her home to her nephew, Nick Fallon, Marie's grandson, who was recently paroled. Though Maggie has a new husband, son, granddaughter, and home, she is considered to be the matriarch of the Horton Family and still maintains a relationship with the members of the Horton family.In February 2016 her son Daniel Jonas was injured in a car accident that also injured Eric Brady, Brady Black and Jennifer Horton. He eventually dies from his injuries and Maggie makes the decision to take Daniel off Life Support and donate his heart to her Step-Grandson Brady. Maggie's life began to get more complicated when a young woman named Summer showed up in Salem and informed her that she was the child Maggie had when she was only 17 and had believed to be stillborn. In the <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> of this, Victor's estranged brother, Deimos, showed up, vowing revenge against Victor. He poisoned Maggie with pills that caused her to have dizzy spells. After one serious dizzy spell, Maggie fell down the stairs in the Kiriakis mansion, was rushed to the hospital, where Victor was informed that not only had she broken her back, but that her legs were once again paralyzed, like they had been when she had first met Mickey. Victor learned that Deimos had poisoned her and had an antidote which he would give Maggie on the condition that Victor turn all his assets over to him. Determined to save Maggie from instant death, Victor agreed. Maggie's recovery seemed more psychological than physical, but with support from her husband and the Horton's, Maggie became encouraged to fight to walk once again, and Victor declared his determination to stand by her in her time of need, even deciding to retire from Titan to devote all of his time to her.|$|E

Henson met David Bowie in the summer of 1983 to seek his involvement, as Bowie was in the U.S. for his Serious Moonlight Tour at the time. Henson continued to pursue Bowie for the role of Jareth, and sent him each revised draft of the film's script for his comments. During a meeting that took place on June 18, 1984, Henson showed Bowie The Dark Crystal and a selection of Brian Froud's concept drawings to pique his interest in the project. Bowie formally agreed to take part on February 15, 1985, several months before filming began. Discussing why he chose {{to be involved in the}} film, Bowie explained, [...] "I'd always wanted to be involved in the music-writing aspect of a movie that would appeal to children of all ages, as well as everyone else, and I must say that Jim gave me a completely free hand with it. The script itself was terribly amusing without being vicious or spiteful or bloody, and it had a lot more heart in it than many other special effects movies. So I was pretty hooked from the beginning." ...|$|E

Like {{a majority in}} the state, he was strongly sympathetic towards the South, and a strong opponent of abolition, but he opposed Delaware’s possible secession. A delegation led by Mississippi Judge Henry Dickinson came from the Confederacy to attempt to persuade the General Assembly to enact secession, but the suggestion was rejected, and Delaware remained firmly in the Union. Meanwhile factions of armed supporters of both sides gathered arms and trained. Burton asked the groups favoring the South to disarm, but later withdrew the request. At the same time he appointed adjutant general and DuPont company president, Henry du Pont, to lead the state militia. du Pont was more decisive, and saw that when additional arms were secured from the federal government, they were directed toward loyal militia, and that the all-important powder mills of his company were properly protected. Du Pont would end up supplying over half the gunpowder used by the Union armies. When the call came for soldiers for the federal army, Burton again compromised by refusing to turn over the Delaware militia, or to pay for bounties, but did encourage enlistment. In fact, support for the Union was so strong that Delaware had a larger number of soldiers per size of population than any other state. This fact prompted U.S. President Abraham Lincoln to remark that “South of the Mason-Dixon line, noble little Delaware led off right from the first.” ...|$|E

2500|$|American {{crocodiles}} {{are dangerous}} to humans; attacks in Mexico, Costa Rica, and Panama are not unprecedented. These attacks rarely make international news, so this species {{is not as}} well-documented as a man-eater, as are its relatives. The species is often reportedly timid, and seemingly lacks the propensity to attack people as regularly as Old World crocodiles do. Crocodiles are, as a general rule, more aggressive than alligators, at least towards humans. The American crocodile rates, temperamentally somewhere in the <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> crocodilians. A study by the IUCN found that the American crocodile has the highest incidence of reported attacks on humans {{of any of the}} crocodilians from the Americas, but fatalities were rare. The estimated number of attacks is considerably smaller than those by the saltwater and Nile crocodiles (C. niloticus). The saltwater and Nile crocodiles are considered to be the most aggressive and dangerous species towards humans, with their large sizes and aggressive behavior combined with low-income socio-economic situations of local people in Africa and Asia resulting in frequent unsafe encounters and high numbers of fatal attacks that may annually range into the hundreds. Reportedly, the Cuban crocodile (C. rhombifer) is rather more aggressive in interspecies interactions than the American crocodile and apparently attacks and displaces American crocodiles when they are kept in mixed species enclosures at zoos or at crocodile farms together, even though it is smaller than the American species. However, attacks on humans are rarely reportedly in Cuban crocodiles, undoubtedly due its much more limited habitat and range. In May 2007, two instances occurred within one week of children being attacked and killed by this species—one in Mexico just south of Puerto Vallarta and one in Costa Rica. On August 24, 2014, {{a man and a woman}} were swimming in a canal in Gables by the Sea, a community in Coral Gables, Florida, at 2:00 AM, in a canal where crocodiles were known to occur, when they were bitten in the shoulder and the hand by an American crocodile. Although the crocodile was 12' 1" [...] in length, and weighed an estimated 550 lbs, it did not press the attack, but released and moved away from its victims. (Florida Fish & Wildlife Conservation Commission, Crocodile Response Program) This was the first documented wild crocodile attack on humans in Florida since records of human-crocodile conflict have been kept. On May 19, 2015, a seven-year-old boy was attacked and killed by an American Crocodile in the Barra Santa Ana estuary near the city of Lazaro Cardenas, Mexico. This was reportedly the eighth crocodile attack in the Barra Santa Ana estuary in the last two years. There have reportedly been 36 American crocodile attacks on humans [...] from 1995 to 2017 in the Cancun area of southeastern Mexico.|$|E
