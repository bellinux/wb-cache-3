25|$|Fullerenes are {{sparingly}} soluble in aromatic solvents such as toluene and carbon disulfide, but insoluble in water. Solutions of pure C60 {{have a deep}} purple color which leaves a brown residue upon evaporation. The reason for this color change is the relatively narrow energy width of the band of <b>molecular</b> <b>levels</b> responsible for green light absorption by individual C60 molecules. Thus individual molecules transmit some blue and red light resulting in a purple color. Upon drying, intermolecular interaction results in the overlap and broadening of the energy bands, thereby eliminating the blue light transmittance and causing the purple to brown color change.|$|E

25|$|Because {{many of its}} {{genes are}} {{homologous}} to human genes, yet its lifecycle is simple, D. discoideum is commonly used as a model organism. It can be observed at organismic, cellular, and <b>molecular</b> <b>levels</b> primarily because of their restricted number of cell types and behaviors, and their rapid growth. It is used to study cell differentiation, chemotaxis, and programmed cell death, which are all normal cellular processes. It {{is also used to}} study other aspects of development, including cell sorting, pattern formation, phagocytosis, motility, and signal transduction. These processes and aspects of development are either absent or too difficult to view in other model organisms. D. discoideum is closely related to higher metazoans. It carries similar genes and pathways, making it a good candidate for gene knockout.|$|E
