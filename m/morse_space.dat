40|$|We {{prove that}} in CAT(0) spaces a quasi-geodesic is Morse if {{and only if}} it is contracting. Specifically, in our main theorem we prove that for γ a quasi-geodesic in a CAT(0) space X, the {{following}} four statements are equivalent: (i) γ is Morse, (ii) γ is (b,c) [...] contracting, (iii), γ is strongly contracting, and (iv) in every asymptotic cone X_ω, any two distinct points in the ultralimit γ_ω are separated by a cutpoint. As a corollary, we provide a converse to the usual Morse stability lemma in the CAT(0) setting. In addition, as a warm up we include an alternative proof of the fact that in CAT(0) <b>spaces</b> <b>Morse</b> quasi-geodesics have at least quadratic divergence, originally proven by Behrstock-Drutu.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{describes the}} space of heteroclinic orbits for a class of semilinear parabolic equations, focusing primarily on the case where the nonlinearity is a second degree polynomial with variable coefficients. Along the way, a new and elementary proof of existence and uniqueness of solutions is given. Heteroclinic orbits are shown to be characterized by a particular functional being finite. A novel asymptotic-numeric matching scheme is used to uncover delicate bifurcation behavior in the equilibria. The exact nature of this bifurcation behavior leads to a demonstration that the equilibria are degenerate critical points {{in the sense of}} <b>Morse.</b> Finally, the <b>space</b> of heteroclinic orbits is shown to have a cell complex structure, which is finite dimensional when the number of equilibria is finite.

40|$|Abstract. The {{critical}} {{points of}} the length function on the free loop space Λ(M) of a compact Riemannian manifold M are the closed geodesics on M. The length function gives a filtration of the homology of Λ(M) and we show that the Chas-Sullivan product Hi(Λ) × Hj(Λ) ∗ ✲ Hi+j−n(Λ) is compatible with this filtration. We obtain a very simple expression for the associated graded homology ring GrH∗(Λ(M)) when all geodesics are closed, or when all geodesics are nondegenerate. We also interpret Sullivan’s coproduct ∨ [Su 1, Su 2] on C∗(Λ) as a product in cohomology H i (Λ, Λ 0) × H j (Λ, Λ 0) ⊛ ✲ H i+j+n− 1 (Λ, Λ 0) (where Λ 0 = M is the constant loops). We show that ⊛ is also compatible with the length filtration, and we obtain a similar expression for the ring GrH ∗ (Λ, Λ 0). The non-vanishing of products σ ∗n and τ ⊛n is shown {{to be determined by}} {{the rate at which the}} Morse index grows when a geodesic is iterated. We determine the full ring structure (H ∗ (Λ, Λ 0), ⊛) for spheres M = S n, n ≥ 3. Key words and phrases.

40|$|Co{{homology}} and homology modulo 2 {{helps the}} reader grasp more readily {{the basics of}} a major tool in algebraic topology. Compared to a more general approach to (co) homology this refreshing approach has many pedagogical advantages: It leads more quickly to the essentials of the subject, An absence of signs and orientation considerations simplifies the theory, Computations and advanced applications can be presented at an earlier stage, Simple geometrical interpretations of (co) chains. Mod 2 (co) homology {{was developed in the}} first quarter of the twentieth century as an alternative to integral homology, before both became particular cases of (co) homology with arbitrary coefficients. The first chapters of this book may serve as a basis for a graduate-level introductory course to (co) homology. Simplicial and singular mod 2 (co) homology are introduced, with their products and Steenrod squares, as well as equivariant cohomology. Classical applications include Brouwer's fixed point theorem, Poincaré duality, Borsuk-Ulam theorem, Hopf invariant, Smith theory, Kervaire invariant, etc. The cohomology of flag manifolds is treated in detail (without spectral sequences), including the relationship between Stiefel-Whitney classes and Schubert calculus. More recent developments are also covered, including topological complexity, face <b>spaces,</b> equivariant <b>Morse</b> theory, conjugation <b>spaces,</b> polygon spaces, amongst others.

40|$|Beginning from 1981 one of {{the present}} authors (S. Novikov) {{published}} a series of papers, (some of them in collaboration with I. Schmelzer and I. Taimanov) dedicated {{to the development of}} the analog of Morse theory for the closed 1 -forms [...] multivalued functions and functionals [...] on the finite - and infinite-dimensional manifolds (Morse-Novikov Theory). The notion of "Multivalued action" was understood and "Topological quantization of the coupling constant" for them was formulated by Novikov in 1981 as a Corollary from the requirement, that the Feinmann Amplitude should be one-valued on the space of fields-maps. Very beautiful analog of this theory appeared also in the late 80 -ies in the Symplectic Geometry and Topology, when the so-called Floer Homology Theory was discovered. A very first topological idea of this theory, formulated in early 80 -ies, was the so-called "Principle of the Overthrowing of the Cycles". It led to the results which were not proved rigorously until now. Our goal is to prove some of them. We study the motion of a classical charged particle on the Euclidean plane in a magnetic field orthogonal to this field. The trajectories of this motion can be characterized as extremals of the "Maupertui [...] Fermat" functional. We show that for any smooth everyvhere positive double periodic magnetic field for any fixed energy there exist at least two different periodic convex extremals, such that the value of the Maupertui-Fermat functional is positive for them. If all such extremals are nondegenerate in the sense of <b>Morse</b> in the <b>space</b> of nonparameterized curves then for any energy there exist at least 4 periodic convex extremals with the Morse indices (1, 2, 2, 3).

40|$|Normal shock {{problems}} in high enthalpy flows are {{of special interests}} to aerodynamicists and fluid dynamicists. When the shock Mach number become hypersonic and increasing further, the gas passing through the shock is compressed resulting in increase in temperature and pressure. As the Mach number increases the internal degrees of freedom of the diatomic molecules are activated to an increasing extent when it crosses the shock resulting dissociation especially for high enthalpy flows. Hence dissociation of diatomic molecules {{must be taken into}} account in the determination of some of the aerodynamic parameters. This thermal and chemical process can be divided into three types such as nearly frozen, non-equilibrium and nearly non-equilibrium depending on the rates of reaction and excitation. For typical re-entry conditions of spacecrafts into a planets atmosphere, dissociation reactions of the molecules is dominant in the stagnation flow. Further in the stagnation region of the flow field one of the most important parameter that characterizes the flow field is the shock stand-off distance. This parameter is often employed for validation purposes of numerical methods as well as for non-reactive and reactive gases. For high Mach number flows the shock is very close to the body hence experimental determination of shock stand-off distance is very difficult and there would be relatively large errors. Therefore the theoretical determination of this parameter is of great significance in the discussion of this physical phenomenon. There are some works which presents how the dissociation behind shock affects the shock stand-off distance. Thus the dissociation behind the shock is a very important process which has great impact in aerodynamic flight and design. In this present work we studied how dissociation of diatoms occur behind a normal shock. Treanor and Marrone (1962) proposed CVD(coupled vibration-dissociation) model for diatoms by assuming diatom as a harmonic oscillator with a cut-off level. But actually diatoms are not harmonic oscillator, because spectroscopic data of energy level spacing is not like harmonic oscillator. For this reason, Treanor, Rich, and Rehm(1968) used anharmonic oscillator model for diatoms to study vibrational relaxation. Taking the anharmonicity of diatom, Philip Morse(1929) gave a formula for potential energy levels for diatoms, which is known to express the experimental values quite accurately. Unlike the energy levels of the harmonic oscillator potential, which are evenly <b>spaced,</b> the <b>Morse</b> potential level <b>spacing</b> decreases as the energy approaches the dissociation energy and then it is continuous. So it is quite accurate to take Morse oscillator theory for diatomic dissociation instead of harmonic oscillator with a cut-off level. We have used Morse oscillator theory to derive a dissociation-recombination reaction rate equation for diatom. To derive the rate equation we have used the transition probability between different vibrational energy levels. The rate equation is numerically solved to get the different flow variables behind the shock. The result of the present work has been compared with some of the previous work. Some of the flow variables are well matching with the previous work and some has discrepancy near the shock but well matching after few distance from the shock. We have also studied under what conditions the post shock flow shows self-similar behavior in its scaling relations. It is shown that as far as there is no dissociation, we could expect to obtain self-similar solutions. However, when there is dissociation, the non-equillibrium nature of the phenomenon disrupts the self-similar nature of the flow...|$|R
