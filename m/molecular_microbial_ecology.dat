50|$|Originally {{working in}} {{cooperation}} with Dr. David Stahl, Rittmann introduced the powerful tools of molecular biology to environmental engineering, helping create the exciting field known today as Environmental Biotechnology, in which {{the goal is to}} manage microbial communities so that they provide services to society.

They make it possible to determine what types of microorganisms are present in the complex communities of environmental biotechnologies, what reactions those microorganisms can carry out, what reactions they are carrying out, and how they interact with each other and their environment.

50|$|Dr. Sogin’s {{molecular}} phylogeny from ribosomal RNA sequences provided {{a framework for}} reconstructing the evolution of microbial eukaryotes. He documented early diverging eukaryotic lineages, giving the earliest evidence of a link between animals and fungi, {{to the exclusion of}} all other eukaryotes. His work demonstrated that the AIDS-related pathogen Pneumocystis shares a recent common ancestor with fungi instead of with the parasitic protozoa that cause malaria. He also discovered the “rare biosphere” which represents most of Earth’s microbial diversity. Sogin was the first to use PCR to amplify and sequence ribosomal RNA genes and to use next generation DNA sequencing to characterize complex microbial communities, which now dominates the field of <b>molecular</b> <b>microbial</b> <b>ecology,</b> including efforts underway within the Human Microbiome Project. He has contributed to analytical strategies to determine the taxonomic identity of marker gene surveys and with David Mark Welch of the Josephine Bay Paul Center has established the Visualization of Microbial Population Structures (VAMPS) website, which offers tools for comparing microbial community populations. As part of the Census of Marine Life, Sogin formed and led the International Census of Marine Microbes. His group currently collaborates on studies of human microbiome dynamics with Dr. Eugene Chang of the University of Chicago. They study pouchitis, a model for ulcerative colitis.

Currently, modern techniques, represented by meta-omics and single cell observations, are revealing the incredible complexity of microbial ecosystems and the large degree of phenotypic variation.

This minireview introduces the application of advanced mathematical approaches in combination with microbiological experiments to microbial ecological studies.

40|$|The premiere two-volume {{reference}} on revelations {{from studying}} complex microbial communities in many distinct habitats Metagenomics is an emerging field {{that has changed}} the way microbiologists study microorganisms. It involves the genomic analysis of microorganisms by extraction and cloning of DNA {{from a group of}} microorganisms, or the direct use of the purified DNA or RNA for sequencing, which allows scientists to bypass the usual protocol of isolating and culturing individual microbial species. This method is now used in laboratories across the globe to study microorganism diversity and for isolating novel medical and industrial compounds. Handbook of <b>Molecular</b> <b>Microbial</b> <b>Ecology</b> is the first comprehensive two-volume reference to cover unculturable microorganisms in a large variety of habitats, which could not previously have been analyzed without metagenomic methodology. It features review articles as well as a large number of case studies, based largely on original publications and written by international experts. This second volume, Metagenomics in Different Habitats, covers such topics as: •Viral genomes •Metagenomics studies in a variety of habitats, including marine environments and lakes, soil, and human and animal digestive tracts •Other habitats, including those involving microbiome diversity in human saliva and functional intestinal metagenomics; diversity of archaea in terrestrial hot springs; and microbial communities living at the surface of building stones •Biodegradation •Biocatalysts and natural products A special feature of this book is the highlighting of the databases and computer programs used in each study; they are listed along with their sites in order to facilitate the computer-assisted analysis of the vast amount of data generated by metagenomic studies. Such studies in a variety of habitats are described here, which present a large number of different system-dependent approaches in greatly differing habitats.

Physiological characterization revealed strains that are more or less adapted to deep-sea conditions. Those results suggest the presence of true marine organisms and other more ubiquitous.

There are no comparable reports of culture-independent surveys of eukaryotic life in warm, anoxic marine sediments.

Many sequences from these anoxic sediments and the overlaying seawater represent previously uncharacterized protists, including early branching eukaryotic lineages or extended diversity within described taxa. At least two mechanisms, with overlapping consequences, {{account for the}} eukaryotic community structure of this environment. The adaptation to anoxic environments is evidenced by specific affinity of environmental sequences to aerotolerant anaerobic species in molecular trees. This pattern is superimposed {{against a background of}} widely distributed aerophilic and aerotolerant protists, some of which may migrate into and survive in the sediment whereas others (e. g., phototrophs) are simply deposited by sedimentary processes.

40|$|Society׳s {{reliance}} upon chemicals {{over the}} last few decades has led to their increased production, application and release into the environment. Determination of chemical persistence is crucial for risk assessment and management of chemicals. Current established OECD biodegradation guidelines enable testing of chemicals under laboratory conditions but with an incomplete consideration of factors that can impact on chemical persistence in the environment. The suite of OECD biodegradation tests do not characterise microbial inoculum and often provide little insight into pathways of degradation.

40|$|The {{advent of}} <b>molecular</b> tools in <b>microbial</b> <b>ecology</b> {{paved the way}} to exploit the {{diversity}} of microbes in extreme environments. Here, we review these tools as applied {{in one of the}} most polyextreme habitats known on our planet, namely, deep hypersaline anoxic basins (DHABs), located at ca. 3000 – 3500 [*]m depth in the Eastern Mediterranean Sea. Molecular gene signatures amplified from environmental DHAB samples identified a high degree of genetic novelty, as well as distinct communities in the DHABs. Canonical correspondence analyses provided strong evidence that salinity, ion composition, and anoxia were the strongest selection factors shaping protistan community structures, largely preventing cross-colonization among the individual basins. Thus, each investigated basin represents a unique habitat (“isolated islands of evolution”), making DHABs ideal model sites to test evolutionary hypotheses. Fluorescence in situ hybridization assays using specifically designed probes revealed that the obtained genetic signatures indeed originated from indigenous polyextremophiles. Electron microscopy imaging revealed unknown ciliates densely covered with prokaryote ectosymbionts, which may enable adaptations of eukaryotes to DHAB conditions. The research reviewed here significantly advanced our knowledge on polyextremophile eukaryotes, which are excellent models for a number of biological research areas, including ecology, diversity, biotechnology, evolutionary research, physiology, and astrobiology...|$|R

40|$|The recent {{application}} of <b>molecular</b> <b>microbial</b> <b>ecology</b> tools to sponge-microbe associations has revealed {{a glimpse into}} the biodiversity of these microbial communities, that is considered just ‘the tip of the iceberg’. This chapter provides an overview over these new findings with regard to identity, diversity and distribution patterns of sponge-associated microbial consortia. The sponges Aplysina aerophoba (Verongida), Rhopaloeides odorabile (Dicytoceratida) and Theonella swinhoei (Lithistida) were chosen as model systems for this review because they have been subject to both, cultivation-dependent and cultivation-independent approaches. A discussion of the microbial assemblages of Halichondria panicea is presented in the accompanying chapter by Imhoff and Stöhr. Considering that a large fraction of sponge-associated microbes is not yet amenable to cultivation, an emphasis has been placed on the techniques centering around the 16 S rRNA gene.
