25|$|NSB first {{considered}} a stone bridge, {{but found that}} the bedrock on the Hafslund side was not stable enough. They therefore opted for a steel truss bridge situated on upstream of the original bridge. The bridge was designed by Hans Tønnesen. It received a deck which supported a single track, but the foundations were built to support double track. The plans were approved in December 1929. Work on the foundations started immediately and by November 1930 the first bridge elements were being installed. These were designed by Erik Ruuds Mekaniske Verksted. The <b>main</b> <b>truss</b> {{had to be put}} together on side and then lifted up from the waterfalls, and event that took place on 17 March 1931. The bridge was finished in 1 May 1931 and the first train ran across it on 9 May. The new railway bridge cost 716,000 kroner.|$|E
5|$|The bridge's {{fourteen}} spans extended 1,907feet (580m) long. The {{three main}} spans were of deck truss construction while {{all but two}} of the eleven approach spans were steel multi-girder construction, the two exceptions being concrete slab construction. The piers were not built in the navigation channel; instead, the center span of the bridge consisted of a single 458-foot (140m) steel arched truss over the 390-foot (119m) channel. The two support piers for the <b>main</b> <b>trusses,</b> each with two load-bearing concrete pylons at either side of the center main span, were located on opposite banks of the river. The center span was connected to the north and south approaches by shorter spans formed by the same <b>main</b> <b>trusses.</b> Each was 266feet (81m) in length, and was connected to the approach spans by a 38foot (11.6m) cantilever. The two <b>main</b> <b>trusses,</b> one on either side, ranged in depth from 60feet (18.3m) above their pier and concrete pylon supports, to 36feet (11m) at midspan on the central span and 30feet (9m) deep at the outer ends of the adjoining spans. At the top of the <b>main</b> <b>trusses</b> were the deck trusses, 12feet (3.6m) in depth and integral with the <b>main</b> <b>trusses.</b> The transverse deck beams, part of the deck truss, rested on top of the <b>main</b> <b>trusses.</b> These deck beams supported longitudinal deck stringers 27inches (69cm) in depth, and reinforced-concrete pavement. The deck was 113ft 4in (34.5m) in breadth and was split longitudinally. It had transverse expansion joints at the centers and ends of each of the three main spans. The roadway deck was approximately 115feet (35m) above the water level.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Historical timber {{roof trusses}} are {{illustration}} of carpentry skills {{of an old}} era. Complexity of created structures is problem even in nowadays full usage of computer aided design. Especially in area of modeling joints and interaction of structural elements are ambiguities and inaccurate interpretations. The above issue is illustrated on 300 years old timber roof truss in Želiv monastery. The structure is Queen post shape with <b>main</b> <b>trusses</b> and secondary trusses. Especially static modeling of <b>main</b> <b>trusses</b> is problematic and difficult with utilization of beam or truss elements. Complex static model shows stiffness properties of joints as well as resistance of the whole truss structure against to climate loads and loads from rehabilitation intervention like replacement of roofing...|$|R
2500|$|The landward piers on the Cornish side of {{the river}} were {{completed}} in 1854 and the girders for these spans were hoisted up to their correct positions. Next to be built was the <b>main</b> <b>truss</b> for the Cornwall {{side of the}} river. The lower ties of the trusses formed of chains made from [...] links. Many were obtained from the suspended works for Brunel's Clifton Suspension Bridge and others rolled new for Saltash. The Cornwall span was floated into position on 1 September 1857 and jacked up to full height in [...] stages as the piers were built up beneath it, the central pier using cast iron octagonal columns; the landward one using ordinary masonry.|$|E
2500|$|The {{structure}} {{was the third}} {{in a series of}} three large wrought iron bridges built {{in the middle of the}} nineteenth century and was influenced by the preceding two, both of which had been designed by Robert Stephenson. The two central sections of Brunel's bridge are novel adaptations of the design Stephenson employed for the High Level Bridge across the River Tyne in Newcastle Upon Tyne in 1849. Brunel was present when Stephenson raised the girders of his Britannia Bridge across the Menai Strait in the same year. From 1849 to 1853 Brunel was erecting an iron bridge of his own; the Chepstow Bridge carried the South Wales Railway across the River Wye and featured a <b>main</b> <b>truss</b> of [...] with a curving tubular main member and three conventional plate-girder approach spans of , a similar solution to that adopted for crossing the River Tamar at Saltash.|$|E
2500|$|The Integrated Truss Structure {{serves as}} a base for the station's primary remote {{manipulator}} system, called the Mobile Servicing System (MSS), which is composed of three main components. Canadarm2, the largest robotic arm on the ISS, has a mass of [...] and is used to dock and manipulate spacecraft and modules on the USOS, hold crew members and equipment in place during EVAs and move Dextre around to perform tasks. Dextre is a [...] robotic manipulator with two arms, a rotating torso and has power tools, lights and video for replacing orbital replacement units (ORUs) and performing other tasks requiring fine control. The Mobile Base System (MBS) is a platform which rides on rails {{along the length of the}} station's <b>main</b> <b>truss.</b> It {{serves as a}} mobile base for Canadarm2 and Dextre, allowing the robotic arms to reach all parts of the USOS. To gain access to the Russian Segment a grapple fixture was added to Zarya on STS-134, so that Canadarm2 can inchworm itself onto the ROS. Also installed during STS-134 was the [...] Orbiter Boom Sensor System (OBSS), which had been used to inspect heat shield tiles on Space Shuttle missions and can be used on station to increase the reach of the MSS. Staff on Earth or the station can operate the MSS components via remote control, performing work outside the station without space walks.|$|E

Taking Jinan Yellow River Bridge as an example, using 3 D {{finite element}} method, {{displacement}} {{and behavior of}} four-line high-speed railway bridge with two <b>main</b> <b>trusses,</b> K-shaped brace and middle suspender is studied. The results show that transversal wave of displacement of floor system is significant, and the difference of the displacement in transversal direction reaches 6 mm. The causes includes: large distance between two <b>main</b> <b>trusses,</b> large stiffness of stringers, longitudinal stiffeners and crossbeams, weak transversal stiffeners which do not connect to lower chords. About 90 % of the loads are transferred to the crossbeam through path 1 and about 60 % to 80 % of these loads through K-shaped braces. Less than 10 % of the loads transferred to lower chords through path 2...|$|R

50|$|The double {{railroad}} {{is carried}} by four longitudinal steel trough girders, with {{the sides of}} the troughs acting as guards against derailment. These are supported by massive cross-girders riveted to the underneath of the vertical struts and lower booms of the <b>main</b> <b>trusses,</b> at 5.2 metre intervals.

The <b>main</b> <b>trusses</b> are double Town lattice and are continuous over a central pier to form two spans of approximately 71 ft each.

This is because the bridge spans the river on a bias.|$|R

50|$|Designing the bridge, Proskouriakov {{proposed}} a new constructive solution — an original trussed girder.

The engineer also utilized the theory of influence lines for truss analysis that enabled more accurate calculation of internal forces in every member in a truss due to moving loads.
