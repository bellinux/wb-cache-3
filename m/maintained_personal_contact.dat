One aspect of this support may involve producing written guidelines for schools; however such guidelines have received almost no attention in the research literature. An exploratory study was undertaken, in two phases, to explore current practice in the production and use of CI guidelines. Phase 1 involved the collection and content analysis of guidelines from {{a random sample of}} educational psychology services (EPSs) in England and Wales. Phase 2 involved semi-structured interviews with professionals, predominantly EPs; transcripts were analysed using thematic analysis. In phase 1, 97 % of the sample stated that their EPS offered CI support to schools and 83 % stated that they had produced written guidelines to support schools. Analysis found that the most frequently occurring content covered: how to initiate support (95 %); recommended actions for CI preparation (68 %) and CI response (95 %); website addresses (68 %) and booklists (50 %); psycho-education about grief and trauma (64 %) and examples of scripts and templates (55 %). Recommendations and information were largely consistent with evidence in the academic literature.

40|$|The {{governance}} {{of sport and}} physical activity {{can be considered a}} ‘wicked problem’ because of its high interdependency of factor and actors, its social complexity and the absence of a single solution to deal with it. One possible way to cope with wicked problems is the network approach. Notwithstanding large amounts of research on interorganizational networks, some research topics only generated disagreement among researchers and still some blind spots remain. In sport and physical activity literature, research on collaborative networks and on how governments administer manage and govern sport and physical activity is very rare. Therefore, {{there is a need to}} strengthen the network collaboration orientation in health promotion and sport research. This research aims to contribute to the existing body of empirical research on whole network effectiveness by elaborating the relative importance of antecedents and processes on network effectiveness, studying the equifinality of network effectiveness, and analysing the effects of underlying processes of power and dependency on network governance. Results of the first study of thirteen networks showed that the most successful networks possessed formal agreements, did not have a metropolis in their operation area, experienced positive effects of the reorganization, included partners with political and exposure motives, showed high levels of commitment, could count on a high quality staff that <b>maintained</b> <b>personal</b> <b>contact</b> with others in the network and that were tightly governed by the network administrative organization. Further study of these networks, using configurational comparative methods, revealed that determinants of network collaboration for sport and PA are interrelated. This implies, for instance, that environmental challenges can be addressed by certain structural network features and network governance. It was also shown that as long as network governance is tailored to the network structure, which in turn fits with the environment, network effectiveness can be reached in different ways. Network governance is thus an essential element in achieving network effectiveness. The third study, which dugs deeper into the characteristics and processes of network governance, demonstrates that network decision-making and coordination is influenced by power imbalances and dependencies. The results showed a dominance of a lead organization. Although collaborating in networks with power imbalances and dependencies entails some risks and challenges, such as power abuse, obstruction of decision-making or exclusion of potential network partners, the network can still be governed effectively. This study showed that when the powerful organizations are committed to the collaboration and enjoy proper levels of trust of the other network partners the collaboration can succeed. Four strategies were distinguished that helped the lead organization to build legitimacy and trust in the network; leveraging expertise and knowledge; engaging in collaborative goal setting; establishing a task force; and engaging in co-optation tactics. Overall this research has attributed to the public network literature and to the knowledge of collaborative networks for sport and PA policy. The take-away message for network managers is that collaborative networks for sport and PA policy implementation seem to benefit from a centralized governance. To obtain network success, a clear goal-setting, partners’ motivations and general commitment to the network are crucial. Finally, it is important that network partners and representatives feel at ease in the collaboration despite power imbalances and dependencies...|$|E

40|$|Online social {{networks}} {{are a source}} of sharing information and <b>maintaining</b> <b>personal</b> <b>contacts</b> with other people through social interactions and thus forming virtual communities online. Social networks are crowded with positive and negative relations. Positive relations are formed by support, endorsement and friendship and thus, create a network of well-connected users whereas negative relations are a result of opposition, distrust and avoidance creating disconnected networks. Due to increase in illegal activities such as masquerading, conspiring and creating fake profiles on online {{social networks}}, exploring and analyzing these negative activities becomes the need of hour. Usually negative ties are treated in same way as positive ties in many theories such as balance theory and blockmodeling analysis. But the standard concepts of social network analysis do not yield same results in respect of each tie. This paper presents a survey on analyzing negative ties in social networks through various types of network analysis techniques that are used for examining ties such as status, centrality and power measures. Due to the difference in characteristics of flow in positive and negative tie networks some of these measures are not applicable on negative ties. This paper also discusses new methods that have been developed specifically for analyzing negative ties such as negative degree, and h∗ measure along with the measures based on mixture of positive and negative ties. The different types of social network analysis approaches have been reviewed and compared to determine the best approach that can appropriately identify the negative ties in online networks. It has been analyzed that only few measures such as Degree and PN centrality are applicable for identifying outsiders in network. For applicability in online networks, the performance of PN measure needs to be verified and further, new measures should be developed based upon negative clique concept...|$|R

The {{aim was to}} determine if and how the introduction of electronic feedback changes the way students interact and learn from feedback. This study was undertaken with the participants from four student c ohorts from the same Master’s degree programme. An electronic survey questionnaire with primarily open -ended questions was utilised to collect qualitative data about their learning exper ience and the proposed changes. Data was analysed for thematic content using the principles of grounded theory. Responses were analysed manually for key words or sentences, phrases and themes. Codes were applied and then sorted into category schemes. Responses were received from 28 students. Data analysis of the questionnaire responses identified 22 codes. The codes were further analysed to identify simple category schemes, these were identified as relating to convenience, timing, the student’s processing of feedback, contact with the tutor or about the actual comments given in the feedback. 10 of the responders had received electronic feedback via the student online learning environment (SOLE) system via one of the trial modules. 17 responders had not received electronic feedback via the SOLE system. Results highlight the importance of timely feedback within modular postgraduate study and the importance of regular access to face-to-face tutorial contact with academic staff. Electronic feedback has the potential to allow students more time to review and engage with feedback and to deliver many benefits that are perceived as convenient and timely, however it is still perceived by some as impersonal and offering no added benefits when compared to handwritten feedback. The main recommendations are to use e -feedback on all modules within the postgraduate programme whilst formalising the offer of face to face or telephone feedback tutorials to <b>maintain</b> <b>personal</b> <b>contact.</b> Formative feedback sessions within modules should continue to be developed, building reflective skills of learners en couraging both self and peer assessment...|$|R

In an era of open borders, free movement of goods and persons, it is a very difficult task to prevent illegal importation and the majority of heroin finding its way onto a Dublin street has its origin in Asia. There is ongoing cooperation between An Garda Siochana, the Defense Forces (particularly the Naval Service) and the Customs authorities. Hard drugs did not materialise as a problem until the late 1970 s. Between 1970 and 1977 seizures were small in number and very few seizures were related to opiate possession or use. Heroin appeared on the street in a significant way between 1980 and 1986. The Gardai have been active throughout the community particularly in schools via the schools and juvenile diversions programme. The underlying philosophy underpinning Operation "Dochas" was that close contact and co-operation with the Community was essential to a successful handling of this serious issue of drug abuse and related problems.

40|$|Sociality is {{not just}} a {{cultural}} phenomenon but is embedded in our genes as eusocial creatures (E. O. Wilson 2012). Learning is an innately social activity, and the processes of teaching, the passing of knowledge {{from one generation to the}} next, are well-adapted to our eusociality. The size and nature of the groups we have evolved to form has, so far, been codetermined by exigencies of our situated existence as, initially, bands of hunter-gatherers, evolving into agricultural thenindustrial societies. Dunbar (1996) suggests the size of such groups is naturally limited. Though his research has been challenged on multiple fronts (Russell, Shelley, and Killworth 1987; de Ruiter,Weston, and Lyon 2011), the vast majority of close social ties for any single individual are limited to a relatively small number of other individuals, and our learning generally occurs in relatively small groups.

40|$|Skripsie (MEd) [...] PU vir CHO, 1989 The new {{structuring}} of {{posts in}} the Transvaal Education Department that came into effect in October 1984, has brought about changes in the managerial posts of the larger secondary schools. The managerial posts have been extended to include a senior deputy headmaster. A complex school may now have the services of two deputy headmaster and one senior deputy headmaster. This extension has been made necessary by {{the large number of}} teachers and pupils in a complex school, as well as the variety of subject packages offered. The headmaster should <b>maintain</b> <b>personal</b> <b>contact</b> with all members of his staff, and in a complex school, this contact suffers. The senior deputy headmaster must therefore adopt this extremely important task, that of building relationships and opening lines of communication, as his own responsibility. The school as an organization, functions mainly through personal interactions that are accomplished by effective communication. Where the workload on the headmaster makes communication and the building of relationships difficult, the senior deputy headmaster should be delegated this task. To see the building of relationships and the opening of lines of communication in their correct perspective, they should be regarded on a religious basis. The Christian educator accepts the Word of God as instructional and governing in all he does. To build meaningful relationships and good communications are God-given instructions. The directions given to man at the creation, ie. to order and rule, are only possible through successful and effective communication, within a framework of good relationships. The characteristics of relationship and communication building are dealt with in Chapter two. Research has ascertained that the tasks of the headmaster cover too wide a field to be dealt with by only one person. He should have some support and assistance. Time to establish <b>personal</b> <b>contact</b> with his staff, and to build healthy relationships is limited, and this gap should be filled by the senior deputy headmaster. Chapter three therefore deals with the building of meaningful relationships. Attention is paid to the nature and meaning of personal relationships. The characteristics and skills vitally necessary in a senior deputy headmaster, to assist him in building successful relationships are also indicated. No management is possible without communication. The senior deputy headmaster is co-manager of the school, and therefore, establishing good communication is an important task of his. Chapter four deals with communication as the administrative task of the senior deputy head; and also highlights the characteristics and fundamentals of communication. The concept of communication is described by several definitions and the importance of effective communication is stressed. The steps in building communication are discussed, and factors weakening or strengthening communication are focused upon. A resume, findings, conclusions and recommendations, follow in Chapter five.

The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine what specific components are needed to administer a successful internship program in a college of business environment. An internship experience is a common part of a college education for a business student. Many corporate recruiters also prefer to hire business students who have participated in an internship experience. As this type of career-related work experience is becoming a more integral part of a college of business education, a better understanding of why successful internship programs are successful would be useful information to internship coordinators, business educators, and site sponsors. Three research questions and eight hypotheses were investigated. The independent variable was internship components, which had five levels. Those levels were goals, preparation of the intern, internship site certification, intern evaluation, and program evaluation. The dependent variable was success of the internship program. Logistic regression, chi-square analysis, and t tests were used to determine which of the internship components were necessary in a successful internship program. A survey was sent to all AACSB-accredited and candidate college of business deans for distribution to internship coordinators within the college. Data were gathered on each of the internship components as well as on how interns were placed and on skills and abilities of the prospective interns. The coordinators were also asked to rate the success of their program and to provide demographic data on themselves and their programs. Although all of the five internship components were significantly related to the success of an internship program, only goals and program evaluation were predictors of success. Recommendations for practitioners are (a) to set goals and objectives responsive to the needs of students, the school, and site sponsors that include criteria for evaluation of those goals; (b) to include in the program a format for preparing prospective interns for the internship experience; (c) to verify that all site sponsors will provide the appropriate environment, supervision, orientation, and support of the interns; (d) to <b>maintain</b> <b>personal</b> <b>contact</b> with all interns during the internship experience; (e) to require interns to write a self-assessment of their experience; (f) to require all interns to be evaluated in writing by their supervisor; and (g) to create a process to evaluate the overall internship program, including feedback from all parties [...] -students, the school, and site sponsors...|$|R
