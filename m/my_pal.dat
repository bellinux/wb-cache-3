25|$|The Kanins wrote <b>My</b> <b>Pal</b> Gus (1952) {{in which}} Richard Widmark becomes {{a good father}} and {{falls in love with}} Joanne Dru, the Elizabeth Taylor film Rhapsody (1954) and The Opposite Sex (1956), a musical remake of The Women. But it was the Oscar-nominated script for Teacher's Pet (1958) for which they are best remembered, a film about a self-made {{newspaper}} editor Clark Gable who has a love-hate relationship with journalism teacher Doris Day. The film almost did not get made since the Kanins were not under any studio contract, and having shopped the script around without attracting any interest, it was only after a rewrite inspired by Garson Kanin's Born Yesterday that producer Bill Perlberg and director George Seaton purchased it.|$|E

Following this, {{he flew to}} the U.S. in summer 1968 with fellow artist Steve Parkhouse for meetings at Marvel in New York. [...] "I sent material first, and based solely upon a pleasant return note from Stan 's assistant Linda Fite, <b>my</b> <b>pal</b> and me were at Marvel's doorstep {{in the blink of}} an eye." [...] Largely due to his Jack Kirbyesque style, Marvel Comics Editor Stan Lee gave him the job of drawing both the cover and story of [...] X-Men No. 53 (cover-dated Feb. 1969), credited to Barry Smith as he was then known. He drew Marvel's Daredevil #50–52 (March–May 1969), a Western short story, [...] "Half Breed" [...] (probably the story [...] "Outcast" [...] eventually published in Western Gunfighters No. 4, Feb. 1971), and issue #12 of Nick Fury, Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.

60|$|We were halted in {{the first}} hall, waiting for some guard to unlock a door.

He {{was standing on the}} gallery and leaning forward, his arms resting on the railing, himself apparently oblivious of our presence. He seemed staring into vacancy. <b>My</b> <b>pal</b> made a slight hissing noise. The convict glanced down. Motioned signals passed between them. Then through the air soared the handkerchief bundle of <b>my</b> <b>pal.</b> The convict caught it, and like a flash it was out of sight in his shirt and he was staring into vacancy. <b>My</b> <b>pal</b> had told me to follow his lead.

6000|$|And all {{the time}} I was in the Pen I was making myself solid with <b>my</b> <b>pal.</b> He had done much for me, and in return he {{expected}} me {{to do as much}} for him. When we got out, we were to travel together, and, it goes without saying, pull off [...] "jobs" [...] together. For <b>my</b> <b>pal</b> was a criminal--oh, not a jewel of the first water, merely a petty criminal who would steal and rob, commit burglary, and, if cornered, not stop short of murder. Many a quiet hour we sat and talked together. He had two or three jobs in view for the immediate future, in which my work was cut out for me, and in which I joined in planning the details. I had been with and seen much of criminals, and <b>my</b> <b>pal</b> never dreamed that I was only fooling him, giving him a string thirty days long. He thought I was the real goods, liked me because I was not stupid, and liked me a bit, too, I think, for myself. Of course I had not the slightest intention of joining him in a life of sordid, petty crime; but I'd have been an idiot to throw away all the good things his friendship made possible. When one is on the hot lava of hell, he cannot pick and choose his path, and so it was with me in the Erie County Pen. I had to stay in with the [...] "push," [...] or do hard labor on bread and water; and to stay in with the push I had to make good with <b>my</b> <b>pal.</b>|$|E
