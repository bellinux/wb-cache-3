25|$|A modern HDD records data by <b>magnetizing</b> a {{thin film}} of {{ferromagnetic}} material on a disk. Sequential changes {{in the direction of}} magnetization represent binary data bits. The data is read from the disk by detecting the transitions in magnetization.

25|$|The {{distance}} between the rotor and stator is called the air gap. The air gap has important effects, and is generally as small as possible, as a large gap has a strong {{negative effect on the}} performance of an electric motor. It is the main source of the low power factor at which motors operate. The air gap increases the <b>magnetizing</b> current needed. For this reason, the air gap should be minimal. Very small gaps may pose mechanical problems in addition to noise and losses.|$|E
40|$|Numerical {{simulations}} of weakly <b>magnetized</b> and strongly <b>magnetized</b> relativistic jets {{embedded in a}} weakly <b>magnetized</b> and strongly <b>magnetized</b> stationary or weakly relativistic (v = c/ 2) sheath have been performed. A magnetic field parallel to the flow is used in these simulations performed by the new GRMHD numerical code RAISHIN used in its RMHD configuration. In the numerical simulations the Lorentz factor $\gamma = 2. 5 $ jet is precessed to break the initial equilibrium configuration. In the simulations sound speeds are $\lesssim c/\sqrt 3 $ in the weakly <b>magnetized</b> simulations and $\lesssim 0. 3 c$ in the strongly <b>magnetized</b> simulations. The Alfven wave speed is $\lesssim 0. 07 c$ in the weakly <b>magnetized</b> simulations and $\lesssim 0. 56 c$ in the strongly <b>magnetized</b> simulations. The results of the numerical simulations are compared to theoretical predictions from a normal mode analysis of the linearized relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (RMHD) equations capable of describing a uniform axially <b>magnetized</b> cylindrical relativistic jet embedded in a uniform axially <b>magnetized</b> relativistically moving sheath. The theoretical dispersion relation allows investigation of effects associated with maximum possible sound speeds, Alfven wave speeds near light speed and relativistic sheath speeds. The prediction of increased stability of the weakly <b>magnetized</b> system resulting from c/ 2 sheath speeds and the stabilization of the strongly <b>magnetized</b> system resulting from c/ 2 sheath speeds is verified by the numerical simulation results.

The influences of the <b>magnetized</b> field, the angle between the test particle velocity and <b>magnetized</b> field, and certain plasma densities and temperatures on the stopping power are studied.

Magnetostrictive speaker drivers have some special advantages: {{they can provide}} greater force (with smaller excursions) than other technologies; low excursion can avoid distortions from large excursion as in other designs; the <b>magnetizing</b> coil is stationary and therefore more easily cooled; they are robust because delicate suspensions and voice coils are not required. Magnetostrictive speaker modules have been produced by Fostex and FeONIC and subwoofer drivers have also been produced.|$|E
25|$|Power {{capacitors}} can be {{used for}} a wide variety of applications, even where extremely non-sinusoidal voltages and pulsed currents are present. Both AC and DC capacitors are available. AC capacitors serve as damping or snubbing capacitors when connected in series with a resistor, and are also specified for the damping of undesirable voltage spikes caused by the so-called charge carrier storage effect during switching of power semiconductors. In addition, AC capacitors are used in low-detuned or close-tuned filter circuits for filtering or absorbing harmonics. As pulse discharge capacitors, they are useful in applications with reversing voltages, such as in <b>magnetizing</b> equipment.|$|E
