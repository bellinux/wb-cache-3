50|$|<b>Electric</b> <b>griddles</b> are {{typically}} {{made of a}} thinner plate material than a similar gas griddle to improve the heat transfer between the bottom-mounted elements and the cooking surface. Elements used to heat the griddle {{are typically}} 4-5 kilowatt (kW) per linear foot, and made from round rod sheathed incoloy material whose geometry is designed to optimize temperature distribution across the plate. The round elements have a tangential point of contact with the griddle plate and are commonly {{held in place by}} a clamping bracket or plate. More than one element per linear foot is common, and an array of these elements is required to heat a griddle plate of any given width. <b>Electric</b> <b>griddles</b> tend to be less expensive than a gas unit of similar size, due largely to the reduced plate thickness, but also the generally lower cost of construction and reduced sophistication of most <b>electric</b> <b>griddle</b> control systems.|$|R

50|$|Depending on the {{application}} a griddle may have either manual gas control or one of several types of thermostat in both gas and <b>electric</b> <b>griddles.</b> These control types have different performance characteristics based on the heat source, mounting, plate material and material thickness, and cannot be considered in isolation when making performance decisions.|$|R
5000|$|Piadina [...] or Piada [...] {{is a thin}} Italian flatbread, {{typically}} {{prepared in}} the Romagna region (Forlì, Cesena, Ravenna and Rimini). It is usually made with white flour, lard or olive oil, salt and water. The dough was traditionally cooked on a terracotta dish (called teggia in the Romagnol), although nowadays flat pans or <b>electric</b> <b>griddles</b> are commonly used.|$|R
40|$|To {{investigate}} the structural and qualitative variations induced by two cooking procedures (<b>electric</b> <b>griddle</b> and microwave oven) 6 buffalo males of 17 {{months of age}} were slaughtered. On Caput longum tricipitis brachii (CLoTB), Gluteobiceps (Gb), Longissimus dorsi (LD), Semimembranosus (Sm) and Semitendinosus (St) muscles morphometric characteristics of FG, FOG and SO fiber types and some quality indicators (rheological and colour characteristics) were measured. The results showed that Semitendinosus has {{a higher percentage of}} FG and FOG fibers, CLoTB has an even distribution of the three fibre types, whereas the LD has a high percentage of FG. With both cooking procedure the cross sectional area (CSA) value of CLoTB, LD and Sm decreases by about 60 % whereas cooking on <b>electric</b> <b>griddle</b> causes a decrease in CSA value of St and Gb muscles of an additional 10 and 6 % respectively, compared to microwave cooking. Cooking determined a levelling {{of the value of the}} qualitative characteristics of the meat: the significant differences found for the raw meat as regards toughness, shear force and chewiness become not significant with both cooking procedure...|$|R
5000|$|Griddles with manual {{controls}} require constant {{attention by}} an operator {{to control the}} temperature of the griddle plate. Without food products to remove the heat from a griddle surface, the unregulated heat source can cause the plate surface temperature to rise continuously until it levels out at temperatures well beyond those normally used for cooking (over [...] ). At these temperatures the griddle plate material may take on a bluish tint as the surface of the carbon steel plate oxidizes. Manual controls are not typically used on <b>electric</b> <b>griddles.</b>|$|R
50|$|The vast {{majority}} of commercial grade griddles are made from A36 steel from 3/8 to 1 in thick, though some are composed of stainless steel or even composites of aluminum and stainless steel of varying thicknesses. Griddle plate depth (front-to-back) is typically 24-inches (610mm), though compact units may be as shallow as 18 in, and deep units can be up to 30 in in depth. Typical commercial gas griddles have plates between 3/4 and 1-inch thick (19 to 25mm). <b>Electric</b> <b>griddle</b> plates are typically thinner, from 3/8 to 1/2 in thick, to reduce the response lag between the control and plate surface common in such designs (less material improves heat transfer time).|$|R
50|$|Though {{they tend}} to lag their gas {{counterparts}} in productive capacity, an advantage to <b>electric</b> <b>griddle</b> construction is the relative simplicity {{of the system that}} tends to limit failure modes and can result in long life expectancy for these products. The lack of hot effluent gases can significantly reduce kitchen heat loads, and reduce overall kitchen system costs by exchanging a major gas heat source for an appliance with lower hood requirements. Rates for gas and electric utilities can be used to balance the cost of ownership decision in an appliance purchase, as some geographic areas have a combination of higher natural gas prices and lower electric prices that may make electrical appliances a more effective choice.|$|R

50|$|Shortly after {{manufacturing}} for a friend, a first experimental cast-iron <b>electric</b> crepe <b>griddle</b> in 1945, electrician Jean-Marie Bosser {{decided to}} launch his own crepe maker manufacturing company.

40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} reduce loader engine {{installed}} power and save energy, we designed the driving scheme of power system for parallel hybrid loader by Analysis of different way of connection between diesel engine and electric motor. We chose ISG power <b>electric</b> <b>multifunction</b> and super capacitor as the core component to design the Loader auxiliary power system and movable arm cylinder gravitational potential energy recovery system. We established ADVISOR software model of hybrid power Loader, and the simulation results show that diesel engine installed power of the hybrid power Loader is reduced by 21 %; fuel consumption is reduced by 9. 2 %. Through optimize control strategy, the diesel engine can always working in high efficient area or idle area. Practical application shows that this design scheme has the potential economic and environmental benefits...|$|R
40|$|Objectives. To {{determine}} {{the effect of}} oral administration of a purified lipidic extract from Lepidium meyenii (MacaPure M- 01 and M- 02) on the number of complete intromissions and mating in normal mice, and on the latent period of erection (LPE) in rats with erectile dysfunction. Methods. Mice and rats were randomly divided into several experimental and control groups. A 10 % ethanol suspension of M- 01 and M- 02 was orally administered for 22 days to the experimental groups according to the dosage specified by the experimental design. On day 22, 30 minutes after the dose was administered to the male mice, 2 virgin female mice were placed with 1 male mouse. The number of complete intromissions of each male mouse in 3 hours was recorded. In an assessment of 1 day of mating, each male mouse was cohabited with 5 estrous female mice overnight. The number of sperm-positive females was recorded. The LPE was measured to assess the sexual function in rats with erectile dysfunction. By using a YSD- 4 G <b>multifunction</b> instrument, an <b>electric</b> pulse at 20 V was applied to stimulate the rat’s penis, and the duration {{from the start of the}} stimulus to full erection was measured in seconds as the LPE. Results. In the normal male mice, the number of complete intromissions during the 3 -hour period was 16. 33 � 1. 78, 46. 67 � 2. 39, and 67. 01 � 2. 55 for the control group, M- 01 group, and M- 02 group, respectively. In the assessment of mating, the number of sperm-positive females increased from 0. 6 � 0. 7 in the control group to 1. 5 � 0. 5 in the M- 01 experimental group. The LPE of male rats with erectile dysfunction was 112 � 13 seconds with a regular diet (control group). The oral administration of M- 01 at...|$|R
