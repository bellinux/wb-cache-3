Instead of a drastic change in MY 1987 {{models for the}} above MK1b upgrades, some MK1a parts continued on in early MY 1987 cars while some MK1b parts came on MY 1986 cars as options. An example is that some MY 1987 cars still retained the old [...] "flat" [...] front bumper despite having MK1b upgrades everywhere else on the car.

Some MY 1986 cars have a rear sway bar, while the <b>mounting</b> <b>tabs</b> on the strut housing were either there for both sides, only one side, {{or none at all}} depending on when Toyota ran out of the older rear struts with <b>mounting</b> <b>tabs</b> as production used up parts.|$|E
40|$|A titanium-alloy mirror-holding fixture {{called a}} strong back allows the {{temporary}} and permanent bonding of a 50 degree D 263 glass x-ray mirror (IXO here stands for International X-ray Observatory). The strong back {{is used to}} hold and position a mirror segment so that <b>mounting</b> <b>tabs</b> may be bonded to the mirror with ultra-low distortion of the optical surface. Ti- 15 %Mo alloy was the material of choice for the strong back and tabs because the {{coefficient of thermal expansion}} closely matches that of the D 263 glass and the material is relatively easy to machine. This invention has the ability to transfer bonded mounting points from a temporary location on the strong back to a permanent location on the strong back with minimal distortion. Secondly, it converts a single mirror segment into a rigid body with an acceptable amount of distortion of the mirror, and then maneuvers that rigid body into optical alignment such that the mirror segment can be bonded into a housing simulator or mirror module. Key problems are that the mirrors are 0. 4 -mm thick and have a very low coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE). Because the mirrors are so thin, they are very flexible and are easily distorted. When permanently bonding the mirror, the goal is to achieve a less than 1 -micron distortion. Temperature deviations in the lab, which have been measured to be around 1 C, have caused significant distortions in the mirror segment...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: One of {{the limits}} to {{characterization}} of tissues at the microscopic level is the substantial {{costs associated with the}} instrumentation required for such investigations. The use of strain gages for displacement or force measurements can be adapted to this microscopic scale provided the gages are incorporated into a transducer consisting of a curved geometry. Materials and Methods: Uniaxial strain gages 13 mm (L) × 6 mm (W) were secured to 0. 2 -mm thick brass shim stock fabricated to yield a 12. 5 -mm diameter semicircle with <b>mounting</b> <b>tabs</b> on either end. The terminal ends of the strain gage mounting pads were connected to an adjustable strain gage amplifier with adjustable gain and offset. For displacement calibration, the transducer was secured to the jaws of a digital caliper. Caliper displacement was set to ± 0. 25 mm increments from 0 to a maximum of ± 1. 5 mm. In this configuration, positive represents tension. Amplifier Gains were set to 500, 1000, and 5000 to observe nonlinearity. For each of three displacement calibration runs, output voltage from the transducer was recorded at each distance with the mean output at absolute distances averaged across each of three runs for each of six transducers. Using the same transducers, a mass balance was used to identify the unique individual mass associated with a total of 10 masses to within ± 10 μg. The masses were sequentially secured to the transducer and the respective output voltage recorded. Amplifier Gains were set to 500, 1000 and 5000. For each of three force calibration runs, output voltage from the transducer was recorded with respect to the force generated by the suspended masses. The mean output across each of three runs for each of six transducers was subjected to linear regression. Results and Discussion: All transducers displayed good linearity when calibrated for displacement with regression R 2 values of 0. 9994, 0. 9967, and 0. 9941 for amplifier gains of 500, 1000, and 5000, respectively. Further, in displacement mode, the transducers provided a mean output of 0. 66, 1. 01, and 3. 86 V/mm at amplifier gains of 500, 1000, and 5000, respectively. In force mode, regression R 2 in excess of 0. 9995 were observed over all amplifier gain settings examined. When employed as force transducers, the devices provided mean outputs of 0. 60, 1. 15, and 5. 85 V/N at amplifier gains of 500, 1000, and 5000, respectively. The response of these devices to either applied displacement or force permits the use of a single device type to be used as either a displacement or force transducer. The electrical output in either mode at modest amplification gains of 5000 combined with excellent linearity affords the use of these devices for studies where characterization of tissues requires mN and μm level resolution. Conclusions: A transducer employing a strain gage had been configured so as to function as either a displacement or force measuring instrument. The resulting device displays high linearity and electrical output even at modest amplifier gains...|$|E

40|$|Lightweight, {{flexible}} probes {{have been}} developed for measuring temperatures at multiple locations in tanks that contain possibly pressurized cryogenic fluids. If the fluid in a given tank is subcritical (that is, if it consists of a liquid and its vapor), then in one of two modes of operation, the temperature measurements made by a probe of this type can be used to deduce the approximate level of the liquid. The temperature sensors are silicon diodes located at intervals along a probe. If the probe is to be used to measure a temperature gradient along a given axis in the tank, then the probe must be mounted along that axis. In the non-liquid-level-sensing temperature-measurement mode, a constant small electric current is applied to each diode and the voltage across the diode. a known function of the current and temperature. is measured as an indication of its temperature. For the purpose of this measurement, "small electric current" signifies a current that is not large enough to cause {{a significant increase in the}} measured temperature. More specifically, the probe design calls for a current of 10 A, which, in the cryogenic temperature range of interest, generates heat at a rate of only about 0. 01 mW per diode. In the liquid-level-sensing mode, one applies a larger current (30 mA) to each diode so as to heat each diode appreciably (with a power of about 36 mW in the temperature range of interest). Because the liquid cools the diode faster than does the vapor, the temperature of the diode is less when diode is immersed in the liquid than when it is above the surface of the liquid. Thus, the temperature (voltage) reading from each diode can be used to determine whether the liquid level is above or below the diode, and one can deduce that the liquid level lies between two adjacent diodes, the lower one of which reads a significantly lower temperature. The aforementioned techniques for measuring temperature and deducing liquid level are not new. What is new here are the designs of the probes and of associated external electronic circuitry. In each probe, the diodes and the lead wires are embedded in a strong, lightweight, flexible polyimide strip. Each probe is constructed as an integral unit that includes a multipin input/output plug or socket for solderless connection of the lead wires to the external circuitry. The polyimide strip includes <b>mounting</b> <b>tabs</b> with holes that can accommodate rivets, screws, or other fasteners. Alternatively, a probe can be mounted by use of an epoxy. A probe can be manufactured to almost any length or width, and the diodes can be embedded at almost any desired locations along and across the polyimide strip. In designing a probe for a specific application, one seeks a compromise between (1) minimizing the number of diodes in order to minimize the complexity of input/output connections and external electronic circuitry while (2) using enough diodes to obtain the required precision. Optionally, to minimize spurious heating of the cryogenic fluid, the external circuitry can be designed to apply power to the probe only during brief measurement intervals. Assuming that the external circuitry is maintained at a steady temperature, a power-on interval of only a few seconds is sufficient to obtain accurate data on temperatures and/or the height of the liquid/vapor interface...|$|E

40|$|For universities, {{solar panels}} can {{be some of}} the highest {{expenditures}} of CubeSat development. In response, groups often opt to purchase solar panels from commercial providers to avoid in-house production complications; unfortunately, this option greatly restricts subsystem customizability and design flexibility. For those groups that choose to build, test and integrate solar panels internally, the process can turn into a monumental effort {{due to the lack of}} readily-available validated procedures outside of industry. In addition to being labor and cost intensive, traditional methods of solar panel fabrication contain intrinsic inefficiencies that compromise the subsystem’s overall reliability and reproducibility. Using techniques developed by University of Colorado Boulder and previously validated by University of Michigan, that paradigm is being shifted. The procedure uses a double-sided adhesive tape along with surface <b>mounted</b> <b>tabs</b> as a simplified method for mounting; it can be adapted to purely use silver epoxy if additional tabs cannot be procured. The solar panel fabrication techniques and testing results from the MinXSS and QB 50 -Challenger satellite will be presented, demonstrating substantial improvements to subsystem reliability, performance, and manufacturability. These results will be affirmed by the highly promising on-orbit results from MinXSS. Two procedures will be outlined, both of which can be readily adapted for a variety of solar cells and panel configurations. Overall, these procedures empower cost and time-constrained groups to fabricate solar panels to their unique system specifications, providing the option of high-performance panel production in a single day...|$|R

40|$|Vertical axis {{cross flow}} tidal and current flow {{turbines}} are proposed to generate electrical {{energy from the}} ocean's kinetic energy, however little is known of their performance and loading characteristics. In this work, fixed pitch straight and helical-bladed vertical axis turbines were investigated using numerical simulation models to perform examinations {{of the influence of}} geometrical layout and rotational rate on power output, torque fluctuations, mounting forces, structural stress, and deflection magnitudes. These studies were conducted to establish the relative merits of various turbine configurations, including variations in strut section, strut-blade <b>mounting</b> <b>tab</b> design, strut location, as well as varying degrees of blade helicity and section angle inclination. To establish performance and loading parameters, transient Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) and Double Multiple Streamtube (DMS) hydrodynamic simulation models were developed, which were then coupled with structural models using beam theory and Finite Element Analysis (FEA) techniques. Extensive verification and validation of the hydrodynamic results against Experimental Fluid Dynamics (EFD) results from literature for turbines of differing geometrical layouts was performed to ensure simulation accuracy. Simulation results show that numerical models can accurately simulate performance when compared to EFD results if suitable modelling techniques are utilised. The results show that significant differences in performance characteristics such as power output and mount- ing force magnitudes occur for turbines with differing geometrical layouts. Straight-bladed turbines were found to generate higher power output, torque fluctuation levels, mounting forces, structural stress, and defection magnitudes than helical turbines of the same frontal area, {{as a result of the}} blade inclination of the helical turbine to the inflow. The influence of strut design on power output was also significant, with low-drag struts located at the blade tips generating the highest power output when compared to turbines with high-drag struts located at the quarter-span location. For both straight and helical turbines the highest stress magnitudes were found at the blade-strut joints. Overall these results demonstrate that straight-bladed turbines are better suited for harnessing tidal and current flow ocean energy than helical-bladed turbines, as they generate higher power outputs whilst not incurring any significantly adverse structural penalties. These results are significant as previous numerical simulation and EFD works have concentrated on each configuration individually, with little known of their respective merits. The numerical models developed as part of this work are capable of accurately capturing the complex behaviour of vertical axis turbines for differing geometrical layouts, allowing for future design investigations to be conducted without the need for EFD. The development of these models, and the inclusion of suggested simulation guidelines in this work, has created a useful design toolbox for future use that is suitable for turbine optimisation studies as well as coupling with fatigue evaluations to ensure turbine longevity...|$|R

40|$|The Boeing Company has {{evaluated}} {{the use of}} Tape Automated Bonding (<b>TAB)</b> and Surface <b>Mount</b> Technology (SMT) for a highly reliable, low cost interconnect for concentrator solar cell arrays. TAB and SMT are currently used in the electronics industry for chip interconnects and printed circuit board assembly. TAB tape consists of sixty-four 3 -mil/ 1 -oz tin-plated copper leads on 8 -mil centers. The leads are thermocompression gang bonded to GaAs concentrator solar cell with silver contacts. This bond, known as an Inner Lead Bond (ILB), allows for pretesting and sorting capability via nondestruct wire bond pull and flash testing. Destructive wire pull tests resulted in preferred mid-span failures. Improvements in fill factor were attributed to decreased contact resistance on TAB bonded cells. Preliminary thermal cycling and aging tests were shown excellent bond strength and metallurgical results. Auger scans of bond sites reveals an Ag-Cu-Tin composition. Improper bonds are identified through flash testing as a performance degradation. On going testing of cells are underway at Lewis Research Center. SMT techniques are utilized to excise and form TAB leads post ILB.

40|$|Abstract: The {{problems}} associatedwith {{the use of}} flow conditioners usually {{relate to}} their ability to remove swirl and produce a fully developed mean velocity and turbulence profiles.

Furthermore, the flow conditioner produces good quality results in conjunction with an orifice plate meter.

5000|$|The {{fuselage}} of the Commuter 110 was a semi-monocoque structure, flat-sided and tapering upwards markedly aft of {{the wing}} roots to the tail. The pilot sat in an enclosed cockpit long enough to contain a second seat in tandem, the canopy merging into the upper fuselage at its rear. One source describes the Commuter as a single seat aircraft, another as a one or two seater. The Commuter's empennage was conventional, with straight edged, square-tipped horizontal surfaces and a straight edged rudder with a trim <b>tab</b> <b>mounted</b> on a narrow fin with a fillet to the fuselage. There was a [...] Lycoming O-320 air-cooled flat-four engine in the nose, driving a two-blade propeller. It had a fixed conventional undercarriage with cantilever main legs mounted on the lower fuselage and a short-legged tailwheel on the sloping underside, about halfway between {{the edges of the}} root fairings and the extreme tail. The mainwheels had brakes and the tailwheel was steerable. The Commuter made its first flight in 1958. Described as an STOL aircraft, it had respectable takeoff and landing characteristics, though no records comparing performance with open and closed Vacua-cells seems to have survived. A more recent study suggests the known figures were not exceptional given its thick wing, weight and power. Perhaps more significantly, the authors' computed aerodynamic investigations of open or slatted upper wing surfaces, though made at very low Reynolds numbers, show no evidence that Vacua-cells enhanced wing performance.|$|R
50|$|The Góbé is of predominately {{aluminium}} monocoque construction. The wings have a metal D-box {{ahead of}} a single main spar, covered in corrugated metal, aft of the spar they are covered in doped fabric. The wing has a modified a Goettingen 549 airfoil; the perforated Schempp-Hirth air brakes extend from {{the upper and lower}} wing surface. The slatted Frise ailerons are covered in doped fabric. The stiffness of the corrugated metal leading edge provides high structural strength for the wings, enabling Rubik to omit extra ribs and rivets. This resulted in lower production costs and lower empty weight compared to other two-seater gliders typical of that era. The landing gear consists of a fixed monowheel and a tail skid. The V-tail of the first prototype was judged unsuitable for training and was replaced on the second prototype and production aircraft by a conventional unit. All the leading edges on the empennage are made of corrugated metal, the control surfaces are covered in doped fabric. The rudder is notably large and effective, its upper part serves as an aerodynamic servo, reducing the necessary operating force. The control force is transferred to the control surfaces via pushrods, except for the trim <b>tab</b> (<b>mounted</b> on the right elevator), which uses bowden cables. The instructor seat is not equipped with instruments; the rear seat is raised in order to give the instructor a view on the instruments mounted in front of the student.

40|$|An {{experimental}} and computational {{investigation of the}} effect of lift enhancing tabs on a two-element airfoil was conducted. The objective {{of the study was to}} develop an understanding of the flow physics associated with lift enhancing tabs on a multi-element airfoil. A NACA 63 (sub 2) - 215 ModB airfoil with a 30 percent chord Fowler flap was tested in the NASA Ames 7 by 10 foot wind tunnel. Lift enhancing tabs of various heights were tested on both the main element and the flap for a variety of flap riggings. Computations of the flow over the two-element airfoil were performed using the two-dimensional incompressible Navier-Stokes code INS 2 D-UP. The computer results predict all of the trends in the experimental data quite well. When the flow over the flap upper surface is attached, <b>tabs</b> <b>mounted</b> at the main element trailing edge (cove tabs) produce very little change in lift. At high flap deflections. however, the flow over the flap is separated and cove tabs produce large increases in lift and corresponding reductions in drag by eliminating the separated flow. Cove tabs permit high flap deflection angles to be achieved and reduce the sensitivity of the airfoil lift to the size of the flap gap. Tabs attached to the flap training edge (flap tabs) are effective at increasing lift without significantly increasing drag. A combination of a cove tab and a flap tab increased the airfoil lift coefficient by 11 percent relative to the highest lift tab coefficient achieved by any baseline configuration at an angle of attack of zero percent and the maximum lift coefficient was increased by more than 3 percent. A simple analytic model based on potential flow was developed to provide a more detailed understanding of how lift enhancing tabs work. The tabs were modeled by a point vortex at the training edge. Sensitivity relationships were derived which provide a mathematical basis for explaining the effects of lift enhancing tabs on a multi-element airfoil. Results of the modeling effort indicate that the dominant effects of the tabs on the pressure distribution of each element of the airfoil can be captured with a potential flow model for cases with no flow separation...|$|R
5000|$|Power-saving {{processor}}s. While laptops in 1991 {{were limited}} to the 80286 processor because of the energy demands of the more powerful 80386, {{the introduction of the}} Intel 386SL processor, designed for the specific power needs of laptops, marked the point at which laptop needs were included in CPU design. The 386SL integrated a 386SX core with a memory controller and this was paired with an I/O chip to create the SL chipset. It was more integrated than any previous solution although its cost was higher. It was heavily adopted by the major notebook brands of the time. Intel followed this with the 486SL chipset which used the same architecture. However, Intel had to abandon this design approach as it introduced its Pentium series. Early versions of the mobile Pentium required <b>TAB</b> <b>mounting</b> (also used in LCD manufacturing) and this initially limited the number of companies capable of supplying notebooks. However, Intel did eventually migrate to more standard chip packaging. One limitation of notebooks has always been the difficulty in upgrading the processor which is a common attribute of desktops. Intel did try to solve this problem with the introduction of the MMC for mobile computing. The MMC was a standard module upon which the CPU and external cache memory could sit. It gave the notebook buyer the potential to upgrade his CPU at a later date, eased the manufacturing process somewhat, and was also used in some cases to skirt U.S. import duties as the CPU could be added to the chassis after it arrived in the U.S. Intel stuck with MMC for a few generations but ultimately could not maintain the appropriate speed and data integrity to the memory subsystem through the MMC connector. A more specialized power saving CPU variant for laptops is the PowerPC 603 family. [...] Derived from IBM's 601 series for laptops (while the 604 branch was for desktops), it found itself used on many low end Apple desktops before it was wildly used in laptops, starting with PowerBook models 5300, 2400, 500 upgrades. Ironically, what started out as a laptop processor was eventually used across all platforms in its follow up PPC 750.|$|R
