After Dostana release, she regretted the decision. Saif Ali Khan refused the role of Kunal because he was uncomfortable with a husband and wife (Bachchan and Rai) playing the other two leads. In early April 2008, Shilpa Shetty was signed for a special appearance in one of the film's songs.|$|E

He tells Liz that {{the anniversary of}} his father, Jimmy Donaghy, abandoning their family is coming up and he is afraid of the effect it will have on Colleen. When Jack arrives at Colleen's hotel room {{to take her to}} dinner, however, he discovers she is staying with a man, Paul. Jack, worried she has been taken in by a con <b>man</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> time of grief, asks his private investigator Lenny Wosniak (Steve Buscemi) to look into Paul. Wosniak cannot find anything distasteful in Paul's background, but tells Jack that he is married. Jack reveals this to his mother, but she says she knew and did not care. Colleen is also surprised that Jack thought the anniversary of Jimmy leaving would hurt her, noting that he had once left from the spring of 1957 until he came back and invited her to see Some Like It Hot. Jack talks this over with Liz and comes to realize that as Some Like It Hot was released in 1959, Jimmy Donaghy cannot have been his biological father because Jack was conceived in 1958, during the period Jimmy had been absent.|$|E

Fanny then, however, warns Lenina away from a new lover whom she considers undeserving, yet she is ultimately supportive of the young woman's attraction to the savage John.|$|E

Bligh's letters home emphasised how fit and well he and his crew were, by comparison with other vessels, and expressed hope that he would receive credit for this. At one stage during the sojourn, Bligh lent Christian money, a gesture that the historian Greg Dening suggests might have sullied their relationship by becoming a source of anxiety and even resentment to the younger <b>man.</b> <b>In</b> <b>her</b> account of the voyage, Caroline Alexander describes the loan as [...] "a significant act of friendship", but one which Bligh ensured Christian did not forget.|$|E
500|$|For film studies scholar Jean Bruce, the {{ambiguity}} of the kiss is foreshadowed in an early scene revolving around a magic trick. On the one hand, the magic trick produces a [...] "pleasurable surprise", while, on the other, this mirrors the deception necessary, due to Trill norms, in the reacquaintance of the characters. At the same time, the juxtaposition of very different shots serves to [...] "convey physical distance {{and the desire to}} bridge it", which mirrors the fact that the Trills' love for one another transcends gender, identity and death. Though the kiss is [...] "informed by the fact that Dax was a <b>man</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> past life", once it occurs, it can [...] "never be taken back", and remains the queer image of two women kissing.|$|E

500|$|Benny Benke, {{writing for}} the Semarang-based Suara Merdeka, drew a {{parallel}} between The Mirror Never Lies and Samuel Beckett's play Waiting for Godot. He suggests that they both have the same message: that awaiting somebody who never comes is ultimately futile. Benke further suggests that the film is centred around {{the conflict between the}} [...] "utopian" [...] Pakis and her [...] "realistic" [...] mother. Meanwhile, Maggie Lee, reviewing in The Hollywood Reporter, considered the film more of a coming-of-age story, with Pakis [...] "discovering her womanhood just when the most significant <b>man</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> life is gone". Lee also noted Pakis' burgeoning sensuality and [...] "nascent physical stirrings" [...] for her friend Tudo. Ultimately, Lee suggested that Andini was expressing her desire to [...] "break away from her father' artistic influence and swim alone" [...] through the film.|$|E

It's a triangle that's developed, but {{to try and}} give a rational explanation to it is next to impossible." [...] Smith thought Daphne was ideal for Shane {{and that she had}} a great deal of love for him. On the other hand, Daphne also loved Des, who she trusted and had become good friends with. O'Brien stated that as far as Shane was concerned, Daphne was the only woman he ever loved and thought that he was more suited to her than Des. Keane commented that despite being engaged five times and stood up once by Daphne, Des had always loved her. He added [...] "It was love at first sight for Des." ...|$|E

Coach is shocked with disbelief and tells her that she's [...] "beautiful", but Lisa objects and begs him for one moment to analyze her physical appearance, which she is insecure about. Coach then realizes that Lisa resembles her mother, and says so. Lisa agrees and tries to continue on that her mother was not beautiful either, but finds herself unable to say it. Coach tells Lisa that she is more beautiful every day, regardless of her appearance, just as her mother was more beautiful every day. Finally, Lisa feels self-confident and thanks her father for his comments.|$|E

500|$|A second {{important}} {{event in the}} development of hip-hop was the start of hip-hop dance instruction. Buddha Stretch was a pioneer in this field. He started teaching formal hip-hop dance classes in 1989 at Broadway Dance Center in New York City. Around the same time, hip-hop party dancing started to appear in music videos and on television—this was another important point in the development and commercialization of hip-hop. An early example of this is when Janet Jackson performed the Running <b>Man</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> 1989 music video for the song [...] "Rhythm Nation" [...] which was choreographed by street dancer Anthony Thomas. The dance was so popular during this time it was also performed by 1990s rappers MC Hammer and Vanilla Ice in their choreographed routines. Michael Jackson also used hip-hop in his 1992 music video [...] "Remember The Time" [...] which was choreographed by a then 21-year-old Fatima Robinson. At the time, Robinson was a street dancer with no formal training and [...] "Remember the Time" [...] was her first music video job. According to MTV.com, [...] "Dances have always been a part of hip-hop culture — from the running man to the Soulja Boy dance..." [...] and this era was the start of commercial hip-hop choreography as it looks today: dance routines are not specific to one genre (strictly popping, strictly locking, or strictly breaking) but rather an [...] of urban party dancing with studio technique added to it.|$|E

2500|$|Lyrically, {{the song}} is a midtempo pop number about {{restoring}} someone's faith in love and family relationships.

2500|$|By the {{syndicated}} run, the storylines had clearly started to mature. Many more of Punky and Cherie's friends were seen (although most only made {{a handful of}} guest appearances each), with Margaux becoming their comic foil and source of friction. Early in the third season, Allen moved away to Kansas with his mother, following his parents' divorce. As Punky herself embarked on junior high, her avant-garde day-glo and multicolored attire, along with her pigtails, segued into more traditional teenage styles, and her declaration of, and reliance on [...] "Punky Power!" [...] {{gave way to the}} realization that intelligence, common sense and a strong will can get one out of any problem. More of her dalliances with boys entered the stories, with the ones she chased and those that tried to pursue her.

They were far from the madding crowd whether they liked it or not, and got tangled in each other's problems because there was nowhere else to turn.
