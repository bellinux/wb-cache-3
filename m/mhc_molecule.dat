5|$|After the {{processed}} antigen (peptide) is complexed to the <b>MHC</b> <b>molecule,</b> {{they both}} migrate together {{to the cell}} membrane, where they are exhibited (elaborated) as a complex that can be recognized by the CD 4+ (T helper cell)– a type of white blood cell. This is known as antigen presentation. However, the epitopes (conformational epitopes) that are recognized by the B cell prior to their digestion {{may not be the}} same as that presented to the T helper cell. Additionally, a B cell may present different peptides complexed to different MHC-II molecules.|$|E
25|$|Tissue allorecognition: MHC {{molecules}} in complex with peptide epitopes are essentially ligands for TCR. T cells become activated by binding to the peptide-binding grooves of any <b>MHC</b> <b>molecule</b> that T cells were not trained to recognize during thymus positive selection.|$|E

This polyclonal T-cell population causes a cytokine storm, followed by a multisystem disease. The toxin in S. aureus infections is TSS Toxin-1, or TSST-1. The TSST-1 is secreted as a single polypeptide chain.|$|E
40|$|Major {{histocompatibility}} complex (<b>MHC)</b> <b>molecules</b> or human leukocyte antigens (HLA) are the cell surface molecules responsible from antigen presentation and activation of T cells. At {{the same time}} <b>MHC</b> <b>molecules</b> determine direction of T cell response. Unlike T cells, antigen specificity of <b>MHC</b> <b>molecules</b> is not high {{and they can not}} differenciate self and non-self antigens from each other. <b>MHC</b> <b>molecules</b> are classified as MHC I (HLA- A, B, C) and MHC II (HLA-DP, DR, DQ) molecules which are structurally similar. <b>MHC</b> I <b>molecules</b> present intracellular antigens such as viruses and tumor antigens to CD 8 + cytotoxic T cells and <b>MHC</b> II <b>molecules</b> present endocytosed bacterial antigens to CD 4 + helper T cells. <b>MHC</b> <b>molecules</b> are encoded by the highly polymorphic genes in a giant locus called MHC. In addition to high polymorphism in MHC genes, they are also charactized by having continuous mutations and codominant expression pattern to increase the diversity among individuals. In evolutionary context, immunologic diversity is important for an uninterrupted life on the Earth. However this diversity causes vast differances among the people in terms of their responses to infections and tendency to have autoimmune and allergic diseases. In this article, structural and functional features of <b>MHC</b> <b>molecules</b> and their common roles in disease formation are discussed. ...|$|R

25|$|The MHC {{gene family}} {{is divided into}} three subgroups: class I, class II, and class III. Class I <b>MHC</b> <b>molecules</b> have β2 {{subunits}} so can only be recognised by CD8 co-receptors. Class II <b>MHC</b> <b>molecules</b> have β1 and β2 subunits and can be recognised by CD4 co-receptors. In this way <b>MHC</b> <b>molecules</b> chaperone which type of lymphocytes may bind to the given antigen with high affinity, since different lymphocytes express different T-Cell Receptor (TCR) co-receptors.|$|R
25|$|In a cell, protein {{molecules}} of the host's own phenotype or of other biologic entities are continually synthesized and degraded. Each <b>MHC</b> <b>molecule</b> {{on the cell}} surface displays a molecular fraction of a protein, called an epitope. The presented antigen can be either self or non-self, thus preventing an organism's immune system targeting its own cells. In its entirety, the MHC population is like a meter indicating the balance of proteins within the cell.|$|E
25|$|On {{the other}} hand, inside a population, the {{presence}} of many different alleles ensures {{there will always be}} an individual with a specific <b>MHC</b> <b>molecule</b> able to load the correct peptide to recognize a specific microbe. The evolution of the MHC polymorphism ensures that a population will not succumb to a new pathogen or a mutated one, because at least some individuals will be able to develop an adequate immune response to win over the pathogen. The variations in the MHC molecules (responsible for the polymorphism) are the result of the inheritance of different MHC molecules, and they are not induced by recombination, as it is the case for the antigen receptors.|$|E
25|$|When a Th cell {{encounters}} and recognises the antigen on an APC, the TCR-CD3 complex binds {{strongly to}} the peptide-MHC complex {{present on the}} surface of professional APCs. CD4, a co-receptor of the TCR complex, also binds to a different section of the <b>MHC</b> <b>molecule.</b> These interactions bring these proteins closer together, allowing the intracellular kinases present on the TCR, CD3 and CD4 proteins to activate each other via phosphorylation. With the assistance of a phosphatase present on the intracellular section of CD45 (common leukocyte antigen), these molecules activate major Th cell intracellular pathways. These active pathways are known as Signal 1 of T cell activation, as it is the first and primary pro-activation signal in a Th cell. Upon subsequent encounters with a given antigen, memory T cells are re-activated using the same TCR pathways.|$|E

40|$|Identification of {{peptides}} {{that can}} bind to major histocompatibility complex (<b>MHC)</b> <b>molecules</b> is important for anticipation of T-cell epitopes and {{for the design of}} epitope-based vaccines. Population coverage of epitope vaccines is, however, compromised by the extreme polymorphism of <b>MHC</b> <b>molecules,</b> which is in fact the basis for their differential peptide binding. Therefore, grouping of <b>MHC</b> <b>molecules</b> into supertypes according to peptide-binding specificity is relevant for optimizing the composition of epitope-based vaccines. Despite the fact that the peptide-binding specificity of <b>MHC</b> <b>molecules</b> is linked to their specific amino acid sequences, it is unclear how amino sequence differences correlate with peptide-binding specificities. In this chapter, we detail a method for defining MHC supertypes based on the analysis and subsequent clustering of their peptide-binding repertoires...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} {{determine}} how T cell-presented peptides associate with the antigen binding sites (desetopes) of class I major histocompatibility complex (<b>MHC)</b> <b>molecules</b> and how they might be scavenged from an endogenous processing pathway for transfer to those molecules, we characterized the binding of two synthetic peptides restricted by HLA-B 37 or HLA-A 2 to class I <b>MHC</b> <b>molecules</b> and to cellular proteins of histotyped cell lines, by gel filtration and photo-affinity labeling techniques. In gel filtration binding studies, each peptide associated with immunopurified class I <b>MHC</b> <b>molecules</b> from cells with its restricting, histotype, but little was bound to class I <b>MHC</b> <b>molecules</b> from cells without the restricting histotype and none was bound to bovine serum albumin. After crosslinkage of a radioiodinated photoreactive derivative of influenza virus nucleoprotein peptide NP(336 - 355 Y) and immunoprecipitations with antibodies to class I <b>MHC</b> <b>molecules,</b> that peptide was found to bind to immunopurified class I <b>MHC</b> <b>molecules</b> from HLA-B 37 + but not HLA-B 37 - cells.

40|$|It is well {{established}} that the activation of various types ofTlymphocytes requires recognition by TCRs in association with <b>MHC</b> <b>molecules</b> {{on the surface of}} APC or target cells. Class II <b>MHC</b> <b>molecules</b> regulate the recognition of antigens by Th cells. It has been suggested that the antigens presented by class II molecules are preferentially ingested or internalized exogenous proteins (1) and that these proteins are presented in a degraded or a denatured form, rather than in the native form (2, 3). Several studies have shown that short peptides, corresponding to mapped antigenic sites of proteins, indeed have the same stimulatory capacity as the intact protein (4). The proteins used for these studies are derived from viruses or bacteria and, thus, foreign proteins. An interesting question that arises from these findings is whether peptides derived from selfproteins like <b>MHC</b> <b>molecules</b> are also presented to Th cells. Kourilsky et al. (5) have postulated that self, as well as nonself, proteins can yield peptides presented by the MHC and that alloreactivity could result from <b>MHC</b> <b>molecules</b> presenting different sets of selfpeptides, including peptides derived from <b>MHC</b> <b>molecules</b> themselves.

2500|$|Like the T cell, B cells {{express a}} unique B cell {{receptor}} (BCR), in this case, a membrane-bound antibody molecule. All the BCR {{of any one}} clone of B cells recognizes and binds to only one particular antigen. A critical difference between B cells and T cells is how each cell [...] "sees" [...] an antigen. T cells recognize their cognate antigen in a processed form – as a peptide {{in the context of}} an <b>MHC</b> <b>molecule,</b> whereas B cells recognize antigens in their native form. Once a B cell encounters its cognate (or specific) antigen (and receives additional signals from a helper T cell (predominately Th2 type)), it further differentiates into an effector cell, known as a plasma cell.|$|E
2500|$|Antigen-naïve T cells {{expand and}} {{differentiate}} into memory and effector T cells after they encounter their cognate antigen {{within the context}} of an <b>MHC</b> <b>molecule</b> on the surface of a professional antigen presenting cell (e.g. a dendritic cell). Appropriate co-stimulation must be present at the time of antigen encounter for this process to occur. [...] Historically, memory T cells were thought to belong to either the effector or central memory subtypes, each with their own distinguishing set of cell surface markers (see below). Subsequently, numerous new populations of memory T cells were discovered including tissue-resident memory T (Trm) cells, stem memory TSCM cells, and virtual memory T cells. [...] The single unifying theme for all memory T cell subtypes is that they are long-lived and can quickly expand to large numbers of effector T cells upon re-exposure to their cognate antigen. By this mechanism they provide the immune system with [...] "memory" [...] against previously encountered pathogens. Memory T cells may be either CD4+ or CD8+ and usually express CD45RO.|$|E

40|$|Antigens {{presented}} by class I {{major histocompatibility complex}} (<b>MHC)</b> <b>molecules</b> for recognition by cytotoxic T lymphocytes consist of 8 – 10 -amino-acid-long cytosolic peptides. It is not known whether posttranslationally modified peptides are also {{presented by}} class I <b>MHC</b> <b>molecules</b> in vivo. Many different posttranslational modifications occur on cytoplasmic proteins, including a cytosolic O-�-linked glycosylation of serine and threonine residues with N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc). Using synthetic glycopeptides carrying the monosaccharide O-�-GlcNAc substitution on serine residues, we have shown that glycopeptides bind efficiently to class I <b>MHC</b> <b>molecules</b> and elicit a glycopeptide-specific cytotoxic T lymphocyte response in mice. In this study, we provide evidence that peptides presented by human class I <b>MHC</b> <b>molecules</b> in vivo encompass a small, significant amount of glycopeptides, constituting up to 0. 1 % of total peptide. Furthermore, we find that carbohydrate structures present on glycopeptides isolated from class I <b>MHC</b> <b>molecules</b> are dominated by the cytosolic O-�-GlcNAc substitution, and synthetic peptides carrying this substitution are efficiently transported by TAP (transporter associated with antigen presentation) into the endoplasmic reticulum.
