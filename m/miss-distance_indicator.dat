5|$|A key {{development}} of the testing program was a <b>miss-distance</b> <b>indicator</b> system, which independently measured {{the distance between the}} Zeus and the target at the instant the computers initiated the detonation of the warhead. There were concerns that if the Zeus' own radars were used for this ranging measure, any systematic error in ranging would also be present in the test data, and thus would be hidden. The solution was the use of a separate UHF-frequency transmitter in the warhead reentry vehicle, and a receiver in the Zeus. The received signal was retransmitted to the ground, where its Doppler shift was examined to extract the range information. These instruments eventually demonstrated that the Zeus' own tracking information was accurate. For visual tracking, a small conventional warhead was used, which provided a flash that could be seen on long exposure photographs of the interceptions.|$|E
50|$|The {{fuselage}} for the Abhyas {{was designed}} by adopting the DRDO Lakshya tow body (not the main fuselage).The fuselage consists of five sections, namely the nose cone, equipment bay, fuel tank bay, air intake bay and tail cone.The material for the nose and tail cones {{are made up of}} composite material (GFRP), whereas the material of the equipment bay, air intake bay and fuel tank are made up of an aluminum steel alloy.The wings and tail plane of the Abhyas have been derived from the Lakshya by downsizing them, however the wings of the Abhyas are positioned on the upper-side of the body whereas the Lakshya has under-body wings.For propulsion it is fitted with a gas-turbine engine, having a thrust of 25 kg, with an endurance of 30-45 minutes.Abhyas is GPS-enabled, has an on-board flight control computer and a <b>miss-distance</b> <b>indicator.</b> It is also designed for autonomous flight {{with the help of an}} autopilot.|$|E
