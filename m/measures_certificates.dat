SPS and quality measures do not so much act as barriers to trade for NMSs agro-food exports in the period immediately before joining the single market (year 2003), and their diminishing role, confirmed by the use of gravity modelling technique rather reflects the progress made in implementing the acquis communautaire. In contrast, import certificates still act as a barrier to trade, for reasons relating to the transaction costs involved.

However, their diffusion is impaired {{by the lack}} of efficient revocation techniques. Traditional credential revocation <b>measures</b> based on <b>certificate</b> revocation lists or online certification authorities do not provide privacy and cannot be used in privacy-sensitive contexts. Existing revocation techniques specifically geared towards anonymous credential systems are more involved – for the credential issuer, users, as wells as credential consumers – as users have to prove that their credential is still valid, e. g., not included in a revocation list. We introduce a novel, non-interactive technique to update issuer-controlled attributes of anonymous credentials. Revocation is implemented by encoding the validity time of a credential into one of these attributes. With the proposed protocol, credential issuers can periodically update valid credentials off-line and publish a small per-credential update value on a public bulletin-board. Users can later download their values and re-validate their credentials to prove possession of a valid credential for the current time period. Our solution outperforms all prior solutions for credential revocation in terms of communication and computational costs for the users and credentials consumers and the issuer’s effort is comparable to the best prior proposals. ...|$|R

40|$|Background: Most UK {{medical schools}} use {{aptitude}} tests during student selection, but large-scale studies of predictive validity are rare. This study assesses the United Kingdom Clinical Aptitude Test (UKCAT), and its four sub-scales, along with measures of educational attainment, individual and contextual socio-economic background factors, {{as predictors of}} performance {{in the first year}} of medical school training. Methods: A prospective study of 4, 811 students in 12 UK medical schools taking the UKCAT from 2006 to 2008 as a part of the medical school application, for whom first year medical school examination results were available in 2008 to 2010. Results: UKCAT scores and educational attainment <b>measures</b> (General <b>Certificate</b> of Education (GCE) : A-levels, and so on; or Scottish Qualifications Authority (SQA) : Scottish Highers, and so on) were significant predictors of outcome. UKCAT predicted outcome better in female students than male students, and better in mature than non-mature students. Incremental validity of UKCAT taking educational attainment into account was significant, but small. Medical school performance was also affected by sex (male students performing less well), ethnicity (non-White students performing less well), and a contextual measure of secondary schooling, students from secondary schools with greater average attainment at A-level (irrespective of public or private sector) performing less well. Multilevel modeling showed no differences between medical schools in predictive ability of the various measures. UKCAT sub-scales predicted similarly, except that Verbal Reasoning correlated positively with performance on Theory examinations, but negatively with Skills assessments. Conclusions: This collaborative study in 12 medical schools shows the power of large-scale studies of medical education for answering previously unanswerable but important questions about medical student selection, education and training. UKCAT has predictive validity as a predictor of medical school outcome, particularly in mature applicants to medical school. UKCAT offers small but significant incremental validity which is operationally valuable where medical schools are making selection decisions based on incomplete measures of educational attainment. The study confirms the validity of using all the existing measures of educational attainment in full at the time of selection decision-making. Contextual measures provide little additional predictive value, except that students from high attaining secondary schools perform less well, an effect previously shown for UK universities in general...|$|R

40|$|Recent {{advances}} in information and communications technology {{have opened up}} new possibilities for improving energy efficiency and increasing utilization of renewable energy sources (RES). Use of technological resources such as the internet and smart metering can permit real-time trading of “green ” energy certificates, which guarantee that a specific percentage of power is generated from RES, and could also permit simultaneous trading in green energy certificates and certificates for the amounts of electricity saved by demand-side energy-efficiency <b>measures.</b> Tradable green <b>certificate</b> (TGC) schemes have been developed and tested in several European countries to foster market-driven penetration of renewables. This paper reviews current renewable TGC schemes in Europe, describes the possibilities for combining them with demand-side management strategies in an internet-based system, and assesses the potential for new policy measures in restructured European electricity markets. In the proposed combined tradable certificate scheme, both renewable energy sources and demand-side energy-efficiency measures could be bid in real time through the internet to meet a defined level of power demand. The savings from the demand-side measures would count {{in place of a}} percentage of green electricity production.

In particular, the status of the electricity generation capacity as well as the RES mixture in the Member States is described. Moreover, the different support schemes such as, investment support, feed-in tariffs (FiTs), tradable green certificates, and fiscal and financial measures which the Member States have adopted for the promotion of RES technologies are discussed in detail. Some Member States are implementing a single support scheme for the promotion of RES for power generation (RES-E), e. g., seven Member States use FiTs, or implement a hybrid support scheme by combining all or some of the four categories of the RES-E supporting schemes. Although, these support schemes have increased the penetration of the RES-E technologies in the Member States, still there is a long way in order to achieve the 2020 target. The reason for this may be that the way these schemes have been used so far, i. e., either as single support schemes or in combination of FiTs or tradable green certificates with investment support and fiscal and financial measures, has been ineffective. A more effective combination could be a hybrid scheme consisting of FiTs with tradable green <b>certificates</b> <b>measures,</b> {{as in the case of}} Italy and United Kingdom, that will increase the RES-E penetration and eliminate the possible technical problems which will arise from this increased penetration and have an effect in the stability of the power system...|$|R

METHODS: We performed a cross-sectional study of 103 consecutive adults attending a JIA continuity clinic, and patients who consented completed questionnaires relating to educational achievement, employment status, and functional disability (the Health Assessment Questionnaire disability index [HAQ DI]), and, for those who were employed, the rheumatoid arthritis Work Instability Scale. We used the structural equation modeling technique to study key patient and disease variables for employment in adults with JIA. RESULTS: The median age of patients was 24 years (range 17 - 71 years) with median disease duration of 19 years (range 7 - 67 years). Functional disability (the mean HAQ DI score) was significantly lower in patients who were employed (P = 0. 03) and in those with oligoarticular JIA (t = 2. 29, P = 0. 02). Educational achievement was not influenced by JIA subtype (F = 1. 18, P = 0. 33). Educational achievement <b>measured</b> by General <b>Certificate</b> of Secondary Education (GCSE) grades had a positive effect on the type of job achieved in later life (F = 11. 63, P = 0. 001), with greater success leading to more professional or managerial posts. In the complex structural equation model, job stability was influenced positively by educational achievement measured by GCSE grades and negatively by the HAQ DI score (t = 10. 94, P = 6. 36 × 10 (- 16)). CONCLUSION: Educational attainment is key to successful employability and is influenced by functional disability rather than by JIA subtype. These findings have implications for choice of occupation and delivery of career advice to aid decision making by young people with JIA...|$|R
