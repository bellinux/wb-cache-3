5|$|The San Diego Chargers got 16 first downs, {{compared}} to 5 for the Buccaneers. Chargers {{players and coaches}} praised the Buccaneers’ defense, who held them to 9 points until the final three minutes of the game, saying that they played the equivalent of five quarters. Three Tampa Bay quarterbacks completed a combined 3 of 8 passes for −4 yards. Buccaneers receiver Bob <b>Moore</b> <b>said,</b> “We’re at rock bottom now...but if we start pointing a finger, we’ll go 0–14”. The Chargers finished with 325 yards of offense to the Buccaneers’ 125. Inconsistent blocking was blamed for the offensive problems, a situation that was not helped by the injury to tackle Dave Reavis. Mercury Morris, who had been picked up on waivers by the Chargers from the Miami Dolphins after the Buccaneers’ preseason game against the Dolphins, commented that the difference in Buccaneers’ offensive line protection between the two games was like watching two different teams. The Buccaneers’ lack of speed was also noticeable. The loss {{marked the first time}} since 1961 that a professional football team was shut out {{in the first two games}} of the season, when the Oakland Raiders were shut out by the same two teams in the same order.|$|E
25|$|Architect Arthur Cotton <b>Moore</b> <b>said</b> that massed, block-long {{building}} {{lines were}} necessary {{due to the}} need to use as much space as possible. To break up the monolithic, wall-like effect of this massing, each long facade was broken in multiple smaller facades and different architectural styles used to make the buildings visually interesting. <b>Moore</b> <b>said</b> he designed the walkways so that pedestrians see only one facade at a time, so consistency in architectural vision is maintained.|$|E

25|$|In October 2017, <b>Moore</b> <b>said</b> that NFL {{players who}} protested police {{violence}} by kneeling during the playing {{of the national}} anthem were violating federal law.

25|$|Immediately {{following}} the segment, Moore was interviewed live on CNN by Wolf Blitzer. <b>Moore</b> <b>said</b> that Gupta's report was inaccurate and biased, and Moore later posted a detailed response on his website.

When Moores sacked Souness in January 1994, {{it was the first}} time a Liverpool manager had been sacked since 1956. <b>Moores</b> <b>said</b> at the time that the decision to sack Souness was made because [...] "the results have been well below what is expected by the club and its supporters." ...|$|R

25|$|The Chessie System and Western Development hired GMR Limited, an {{architectural}} firm located in Rockville, Maryland, to design Washington Harbour. The company submitted its proposed design to the Commission of Fine Arts {{in the fall}} of 1979. This design was a six-story, squat, heavily massed set of buildings (connected by bridges on the upper level) which utilized as much of the development area as possible. The CFA voiced concern about the massing of the complex, and GMR Limited lowered its height to just three stories. The changes were not enough, however, and the CFA rejected the proposed design in December. A month later, Western Development hired nationally known architect Arthur Cotton Moore to redesign Washington Harbour. Taking up the suggestions of the CFA, <b>Moore</b> <b>said</b> he would use a variety of colors for the project and possibly design smaller buildings with more space between them. Meanwhile, city officials backed off their unequivocal support for the project. In addition, the NCPC ordered that an environmental impact statement (EIS) be drawn up for the various development and park proposals, a study which would take at least six months to complete. With the redesign and EIS requirements, Western Development officials said the start date for their project was being pushed from fall 1980 to March 1981. The company also gave a name to its partnership with the Chessie System: Washington Harbour Associates.|$|E
25|$|In early 1955, Parker {{became aware}} of a young singer named Elvis Presley. Presley had a singing style {{different}} from the current trend, and Parker was immediately interested {{in the future of}} this musical style. Presley’s first manager was Scotty Moore, the guitarist in his band, who was encouraged by Sun Records owner Sam Phillips to become his manager to protect Elvis from unscrupulous music promoters. In the beginning, Presley, Moore, and the bassist Bill Black were a trio, the Blue Moon Boys. However, when Presley signed a recording contract with Phillips, Moore and Black were excluded from the contract. Phillips told them to make a separate deal with Elvis. According to Moore, Presley agreed to take 50 percent, and Moore and Black would split the other 50 percent. Moore’s one-year management contract with Presley provided him with a 10-percent commission, which <b>Moore</b> <b>said</b> he never took. The contract, dated July 12, 1954, eight days after their first recording session, was signed by Presley and his parents. When the contract expired, the Memphis radio personality Bob Neal stepped in and made a deal with Phillips to become Presley’s manager. At that point, Moore and Black had no contractual ties to either Phillips or Presley. Neal was struggling at the time to accommodate his new client's success, and in February 1955, following a meeting with Parker, Presley agreed to let Parker take some control of future bookings and promotions.|$|E

500|$|Moore and Gibbons {{designed}} Watchmen {{to showcase}} the unique {{qualities of the}} comics medium and to highlight its particular strengths. In a 1986 interview, <b>Moore</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "What I'd like to explore is the areas that comics succeed in where no other media is capable of operating", and emphasized this by stressing the differences between comics and film. <b>Moore</b> <b>said</b> that Watchmen {{was designed to be}} read [...] "four or five times", with some links and allusions only becoming apparent to the reader after several readings. Dave Gibbons notes that, [...] "s it progressed, Watchmen became much more about the telling than the tale itself. The main thrust of the story essentially hinges on what is called a macguffin, a gimmick [...] So really the plot itself is of no great consequence [...] it just really isn't the most interesting thing about Watchmen. As we actually came to tell the tale, that's where the real creativity came in." ...|$|E

500|$|Walter Joseph Kovacs / Rorschach: A vigilante {{who wears}} a white mask that {{contains}} a symmetrical but constantly shifting ink blot pattern, he continues to fight crime {{in spite of his}} outlaw status. <b>Moore</b> <b>said</b> he was trying to [...] "come up with this quintessential Steve Ditko character—someone who's got a funny name, whose surname begins with a 'K,' who's got an oddly designed mask". Moore based Rorschach on Ditko's creation Mr. A; Ditko's Charlton character The Question also served as a template for creating Rorschach. Comics historian Bradford W. Wright described the character's world view [...] "a set of black-and-white values that take many shapes but never mix into shades of gray, similar to the ink blot tests of his namesake". Rorschach sees existence as random and, according to Wright, this viewpoint leaves the character [...] "free to 'scrawl [...] own design' on a 'morally blank world. <b>Moore</b> <b>said</b> he did not foresee the death of Rorschach until the fourth issue when he realized that his refusal to compromise would result in him not surviving the story.|$|E

With several months on the sidelines, Keedy's absence gave the opportunity to young spinners Kerrigan and Stephen Parry to play first team cricket. Lancashire coach Peter <b>Moores</b> <b>said</b> [...] "We're lucky in some ways in that we’ve got Stephen Parry, who played quite a lot of first-team cricket last season, but we’ve also got Simon Kerrigan, who bowled beautifully to take six wickets in the pre-season game against Yorkshire in Barbados and we could also use Steven Crofty's off-spin".|$|R
