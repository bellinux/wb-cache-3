The 2-axis tilt sensor technology enables simultaneous 2D (X-Y plane) tilt angles measurement which traditional single-axis tilt sensors are unable to offer. Often, precision industry applications in particular, levelling, angle measurement/ alignment and surface flatness profiling tasks essentially involve 2-dimensional planes rather than single-axis.|$|E

Analogue methods like time interval stretching or double conversion as well as digital methods like tapped delay lines and the Vernier method are under examination. Though the analogue methods still obtain better accuracies, digital time interval measurement is often preferred due to its flexibility in integrated circuit technology and its robustness against external perturbations like temperature changes.|$|E
50|$|A dial test {{indicator}}, {{also known}} as a lever arm test indicator or finger indicator, has a smaller <b>measuring</b> <b>range</b> than a standard dial indicator. A test indicator measures the deflection of the arm, the probe does not retract but swings in an arc around its hinge point. The lever may be interchanged for length or ball diameter, and permits measurements to be taken in narrow grooves and small bores where the body of a probe type may not reach. The model shown is bidirectional, some types may have to be switched via a side lever to be able to measure in the opposite direction.|$|E

50|$|Compact {{surveillance}} radar emits microwaves from a transmitter and detects any reflected microwaves. They {{are similar to}} microwave detectors but can detect the precise location of intruders in areas extending over hundreds of acres. With the capability of <b>measuring</b> <b>range,</b> angle, velocity, direction {{and size of the}} target, a CSR is able to pinpoint a precise GPS coordinate of an intruder. This target information is typically displayed on a map, user interface or situational awareness software that defines geographical alert zones or geofences with different types of actions initiated depending on time of day and other factors. CSR is commonly used to protect outside the fenceline of critical facilities such as electrical substations, power plants, dams, and bridges.|$|E
50|$|Advantages of the allergy {{blood test}} range from: {{excellent}} reproducibility across the full <b>measuring</b> <b>range</b> of the calibration curve, it has very high specificity as it binds to allergen specific IgE, and extremely sensitive too, {{when compared with}} skin prick testing. In general, this method of blood testing (in-vitro, out of body) vs skin-prick testing (in-vivo, in body) has a major advantage: {{it is not always}} necessary to remove the patient from an anthihistamine medication regimen, and if the skin conditions (such as eczema) are so widespread that allergy skin testing cannot be done. Allergy blood tests, such as ImmunoCAP, are performed without procedure variations, and the results are of excellent standardization.|$|E
50|$|KF {{has a high}} {{accuracy}} and precision, typically within 1% of available water, e.g. 3.00% appears as 2.97 - 3.03%. Although KF is a destructive analysis, the sample quantity is small and is typically limited by the accuracy of weighing. For example, {{in order to obtain}} an accuracy of 1% using a scale with the typical accuracy of 0.2 mg, the sample must contain 20 mg water, which is e.g. 200 mg for a sample with 10% water. For coulometers, the <b>measuring</b> <b>range</b> is from 1-5 ppm to ca. 5%. Volumetric KF readily measures samples up to 100%, but requires impractically large amounts of sample for analytes with less than 0.05% water. The KF response is linear. Therefore, single-point calibration using a calibrated 1% water standard is sufficient and no calibration curves are necessary.|$|E

An anem. ometer described here has two fine resistance wires and two manganin 	wires and they are connected to a wheatstone bridge. One resistance wire of 	the above brige is loner than the other， and the longer wire is consisted of 	many same wires arranged in parallel. These two resistance wires is set in a 	probe and the probe is exposed in the air. In such a way，the effect of the air 	temperature is taken off. 	Moreover，t his anemometer has as many as five <b>measuring</b> <b>ranges.</b> The <b>measuring</b> 	<b>ranges</b> are changed by step-up or step-down of the input current of the 	bridge. 80 its sensitivity does not decrease for all over the <b>measuring</b> <b>ranges.</b> 	 8 ince this anemometer has a simple circuit， it may be useful as a portable 	in under grounds or bui 1 dings etc. ...|$|R
5000|$|The camera {{had to be}} {{converted}} to use parts from Rollei's suppliers, as Rollei did not maintain business relations with Metrawatt and Steinheil. A high-quality Tessar lens was made by Zeiss. Rollei's light meter supplier was Gossen. Whether to use either a photovoltaic selenium sensor or a CdS photoresistor, was finally decided in August in favour of the CdS. Gossen named the same <b>measuring</b> <b>range</b> for both solutions. A selenium-cell powered light meter was cheaper in production and did not need a battery. However, the much smaller CdS-photoresistor improved the stylish look of the camera, the battery powered light-meter was more shock-resistant, and the [...] "CdS technology" [...] {{could be used as}} a selling point in advertising.The housing needed to be changed just slightly, since Waaske unknowingly had adopted the appearance of Rollei's twin-lens reflex cameras, by placing the exposure time and aperture controls to the right and to the left side of the lens. Nevertheless, Rollei's designer Ernst Moeckl revised the housing, and by changing the edge radius made the camera body even smaller.|$|E
5000|$|The outer {{cylinder}} of the Stabinger Viscometer™ is a sample-filled {{tube that}} rotates at constant speed in a temperature-controlled copper housing. The hollow internal cylinder - shaped as a conical rotor - is centered within the sample by hydrodynamic lubrication effects and centrifugal forces. In this way all bearing friction, an inevitable factor in most rotational devices, is fully avoided. The rotating fluid's shear forces drive the rotor, while a magnet inside the rotor forms an {{eddy current brake}} with the surrounding copper housing. An equilibrium rotor speed is established between driving and retarding forces, which is an unambiguous measure of the dynamic viscosity. The speed and torque measurement is implemented without direct contact by a Hall effect sensor counting {{the frequency of the}} rotating magnetic field. This allows for a highly precise torque resolution of 50 pN·m and a wide <b>measuring</b> <b>range</b> from 0.2 to 30,000 mPa·s with a single measuring system. A built-in density measurement based on the oscillating U-tube principle allows the determination of kinematic viscosity from the measured dynamic viscosity employing the relation ...|$|E
5000|$|Piezoelectric {{load cells}} {{work on the}} same {{principle}} of deformation as the strain gauge load cells, but a voltage output is generated by the basic piezoelectric material - proportional to the deformation of load cell. Useful for dynamic/frequent measurements of force. Most applications for piezo-based load cells are in the dynamic loading conditions, where strain gauge load cells can fail with high dynamic loading cycles.It must be remembered that the piezoelectric effect is dynamic, that is, the electrical output of a gauge is an impulse function and is not static. The voltage output is only useful when the strain is changing and does not measure static values.However, depending on conditioning system used, [...] "quasi static" [...] operation can be done.Using a so-called [...] "Charge amplifier [...] " [...] with [...] "Long" [...] time constant allow accurate measurement lasting many hours for large loads to many minutes for small loads.Another advantage of Piezoelectric load cell, conditioned with a Charge amplifier, is the wide <b>measuring</b> <b>range</b> that can be achieved.Users can choose a load cell {{with a range of}} hundred of kN and use it for measuring few N of forces with the same Signal/Noise ratio, again this is possible only {{with the use of a}} [...] "Charge amplifier" [...] conditioning.|$|E
