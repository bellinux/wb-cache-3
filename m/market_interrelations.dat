40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{stock market}} linkages {{of a group}} of Pacific-Basin countries with U. S. and Japan by estimating the multivariate cointegration model in both the autoregressive and moving average forms over the period 1980 - 1998. Recursive estimation helped identify the evolution of the linkages. The results for the 1980 s indicate that the relaxation of foreign ownership restrictions was not sufficient to attract foreign investors' attention and that other factors must have affected the portfolio diversification decision. The results of the 1990 s suggest that the relaxation of the restrictions might have strengthened international <b>market</b> <b>interrelations.</b> Country Funds have provided access to highly regulated capital markets...|$|E
30|$|Eun and Shim (1989) {{investigate}} the international transmission mechanism by estimating a nine-market vector autoregression (VAR) system {{and find a}} substantial degree of multilateral interaction among the stock markets. Innovations in the U.S. market are rapidly transmitted to other markets, where as no single foreign market can significantly explain the U.S. market’s movements. Phylaktis and Ravazzolo (2002) measure financial linkages by analyzing the covariance of excess returns on the national stock markets of emerging economies. Kasa (1992) examines the existence of common stochastic trends as a driver of cointegration by applying multivariate cointegration to five well-established financial markets. In a similar vein, the long-run co-movements between markets are studied by Chung and Lin (1994) in Japan, the U.S., Taiwan, HongKong, and Singapore over the period 1985 – 92, finding weak financial linkages. Corhay et al. (1995) undertook a similar analysis for Australia, HongKong, Japan, Singapore, and New Zealand over the period 1972 – 92; as did Masih and Masih (1999) for the U.S., Japan, the U.K., Germany, Singapore, Malaysia, Hong Kong, and Thailand over the period 1992 – 97. Samitas and Kenourgios (2011) investigate stock market integration {{in a number of}} Balkan countries and compare it with the level of integration among several developed markets (the U.S., Britain, and Germany) in 2000 – 2006. Using several cointegration tests, the results support the existence of long-term relationships among Balkan stock markets and developed markets. Phylaktis and Ravazzolo (2005) examine the stock market linkages of a group of Pacific-Basin countries with the U.S. and Japan by estimating ARMA over the period 1980 – 1998 and find that the relaxation of restrictions may have strengthened international <b>market</b> <b>interrelations</b> and that country funds have provided access to highly regulated capital markets.|$|E
40|$|Private {{mortgage}} insurance (2 ̆ 2 PMI 2 ̆ 2) {{is an important}} segment of the home mortgage market {{and has been a}} significant contributing factor to the high and growing incidence of occupant home ownership in this country, including particularly occupant home ownership by low- and moderate-income families. PMI is written by private PMI companies that are extensively regulated by state laws that in important respects vary from state to state. But the market role of the PMI companies is also heavily influenced by federal laws that have created and regulated both major competitors of PMI companies and major sources of these companies 2 ̆ 7 business. The competitors are two federal agencies, the Federal Housing Administration (2 ̆ 2 FHA 2 ̆ 2) and the Veterans Administration (2 ̆ 72 ̆ 7 VA 2 ̆ 72 ̆ 7), each of which insures a large volume of home mortgage loans. The sources of business are two mammoth private companies, the Federal National Mortgage Association (2 ̆ 2 Fannie Mae 2 ̆ 2) and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (2 ̆ 2 Freddie Mac 2 ̆ 2), each of which was created and is heavily subsidized by the federal government and each of which purchases a high percentage of the mortgages insured by PMI companies. The extensive array of federal laws that has established the <b>market</b> <b>interrelations</b> among these various market participants is a subtle product of political and financial pressures. Many of these laws have changed over time and are vulnerable to further change. This Article considers the nature of the PMI market and the principal participants in or affecting that market, with emphasis on the laws regulating the participants and the market. Coverage sequentially is as follows: Section I, The Market for Private Mortgage Insurance; Section II, Private Mortgage Insurance Companies and Their Operations; Section III, Government Regulation (reviewing both state and federal laws of relevance to PMI); Section IV, Possible Legal Changes (stressing proposals for change in federal law of relevance to PMI); and Section V, Conclusions (including some observations as to how the PMI market and market participants may change in the future) ...|$|E

The aim of research is to perform investigation of separate countries and economic branches' factors in order to estimate prices change tendency of particular securities markets. Also, developing and developed securities markets' interrelation is relevant, because small-scale emerging financial markets are dependent on other markets' external effects. When economic relations between countries strengthen, private capital flows to developing countries or in particular sectors increase, they grow together and these countries or sectors securities markets integrate into the global financial market.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} and analyses international solid biofuel trade and concludes upon interactions with bioenergy policies and market factors. It shows that trade {{has grown from}} about 56 to 300 PJ between 2000 and 2010. Wood pellets grew strongest, i. e. from 8. 5 to 120 PJ. Other relevant streams by 2010 included wood waste (77 PJ), fuelwood (76 PJ), wood chips (17 PJ), residues (9 PJ), and roundwood (2. 4 PJ). Intra-EU trade covered two thirds of global trade by 2010. Underlying markets are highly heterogeneous; generally though trade evolved whenever supply side market factors coincided with existing/emerging demand patterns. Market factors and policies both defined trade volumes; though policy changes did not have as prominent effects on trade developments as in the liquid biofuel sector. Economic viability is the key limiting factor. Main exporting countries have low feedstock costs and already existing wood processing industries. Trade-relevant aspects are the commodity’s monetary value; determined by its homogeneity, heating value, and bulk density. Consumer markets are diverse: in residential heating, demand/trade patterns {{have been influenced by}} local biofuel availability and short-term price signals, i. e. mainly price competitiveness and investment support for boilers/stoves. Commodities are mainly sourced regionally, but price differences have triggered a growing trade. The industrial segment is greatly influenced by policy frameworks but more mature (e. g. established routes). Trade is strictly linked to margins (defined mainly by policies) and combustion technologies. Uncertainties in the analysis are due to data gaps across and within databases regarding import/export declarations. To estimate bioenergy related trade, anecdotal data was indispensable. We believe datasets should be streamlined across international institutions to eventually enable reporting of global trade beyond digit- 6 -level. Research is needed to provide further insights into informal <b>markets.</b> <b>Interrelations</b> between trade factors are particularly relevant when mapping future trade streams under different policy/trade regime scenario...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} level of {{relationship}} of the SEE stock markets in three analyzed periods: the pre-crisis, mid-crisis, and post-crisis period. We found that the relationships of the SEE markets with the benchmark developed markets, and among them, are not stable in the long-run. Using the VAR model, Granger cause causality, impulse response and variance decomposition, {{we came to the}} conclusion that while in the crisis period the SEE stock <b>markets</b> shows high <b>interrelations</b> among them and with the developed markets, the inter-linkages diminished after the crisis period. In the pre-and post-crisis period SEE markets have on average zero correlations, modest lead-lag interactions, small responses to other market shocks, and most of the variance is explained by their own shock. The opposite is true for the crisis period, when SEE markets have a significant adjusted effect, and each market responds to the impulses coming from most of the other markets. This suggests that in the period of instability and uncertainty SEE markets follow a common path, and in the calm periods with optimism and positive expectations the lead-lag relations of the SEE markets with the developed stock markets diminish...|$|R
40|$|The {{article is}} {{dedicated}} to determining the role of infrastructure potential of the financial market in ensuring its security and flexibility. The aim of the article is to assess the role of infrastructure potential of the financial market in ensuring its flexibility and security. Threats to the financial market security are systematized by sources of formation, scale, duration and nature of influence. The essence of security and flexibility of the financial market is defined. There systematized indicators of security and flexibility of the financial <b>market</b> in <b>interrelation</b> with the components of infrastructure potential of the financial market. The methodology for determining the level of economic safety and flexibility of the financial market is substantiated, the corresponding calculations are made. Also the methodology for calculating the normalized index of the infrastructure potential of the financial market is developed. The correlation-regression analysis {{of the connection between}} development of the infrastructure potential of the financial market, its security and flexibility is carried out. The results of the calculations showed that the degree of implementation of the financial market infrastructure potential at the current stage of development of the Ukrainian economy is insufficient. It does not contribute to achieving the necessary level of flexibility and security of the financial market. Each of the components of infrastructure potential requires changing approaches to regulation aimed at ensuring the systematic development of the financial market. Most of the identified problems are mainly related to dysfunctionality of the technological and information components of the infrastructural potential of the financial market. This is manifested in the low level of confidence in it from the part of the household sector {{as well as in the}} poor efficiency of regulation of certain segments of the financial market. That is why the prospects for further research are to identify areas for increasing the role of technological and information components of the infrastructure potential of the financial market...|$|R
40|$|Using firm-level data, {{we examine}} stock <b>market</b> {{correlations}} and <b>interrelations</b> for the G 7 {{over the period}} 2000 – 2013. An examination using aggregate market data supports the view that correlations have risen and particularly so during crisis periods. Using firm-level data, which is tradeable, we establish sector portfolios. We consider three regression approaches. The results support, first, that correlations using firm data are lower than those observed using aggregate market index data. Second, the most important driver for home sector returns is the home market followed by the corresponding US sector. Third, correlations rose during the crisis but have stabilised and even fallen since. This supports the view that markets fall together but rise apart. Fourth, {{there is evidence that}} most sector correlations follow a market-wide component, but some sector correlations follow their own component. Subsequently, we examine the key drivers of time-varying correlations. We find that the market-wide component of correlations increases in a US bear market as well as with higher US market volatility and lower US interest rates. However, on a sector basis, there are notable exceptions with some correlations falling in a bear market. Together, these results support the view that diversification benefits remain across market sectors...|$|R
40|$|This study {{concentrates}} on interactions, price convergence and co-movements among the organized (and parallel) {{markets in the}} Czech Republic. Significant and lasting price differences between the individual trading channels available to the investor are documented and they are attributed to the (inefficient) institutional structure of the Czech capital markets as these characteristics are not sensitive to the firms' characteristics. The central markets of the Prague Stock Exchange (PSE) and the RMS (over-the-counter system) represent the two most closely linked <b>market</b> channels. The <b>interrelations</b> between these <b>markets</b> are studied to identify the leaders and followers in the information transmission process. The analysis shows the leading position in actively traded stocks to be held by the PSE main market, but RMS dominates in segments with lower liquidity. The analysis of the intramarket relations also confirms that liquid segments play {{a leading role in}} both the PSE and RMS. Given the unpleasant evolution of the Czech capital markets and contrary to the theory, these links actually weaken over time as a smaller fraction of total trade is being transacted on these price-forming markets. Thus, we conclude that the PSE and the RMS do not behave as a fully integrated and efficient market. Major institutional changes are identified as the only mitigating force which has led to the deteriorating position and reputation of the Czech capital markets and the Prague Stock Exchange in particular. ...|$|R
40|$|The thesis {{examines}} {{the stock and}} foreign exchange markets {{of a group of}} Pacific Basin countries. The main purpose is to investigate the role of foreign ownership restrictions and taxes on potential linkages between these <b>markets,</b> and their <b>interrelations</b> {{with the rest of the}} world. The overall analysis highlights the presence of substantial financial links at the regional and global level. In particular, it shows close financial links even for markets with extensive capital controls. It also finds linkages between their stock and foreign exchange markets and that foreign currency risk is a significant component of domestic stock returns. When examining for potential sources of these close financial links, the research indicates that Country Funds have provided indirect ways of foreign participation in the local stock markets and contributed to these financial links. Furthermore, the thesis also emphasised the role of economic integration. of the Pacific Basin countries for their financial integration. The study found that the Asian financial crisis of mid 1997 had some effects on the financial links of the Pacific Basin Rim at the regional and global level. In addition, while the turmoil has increased the economic integration at the regional level, it has reduced economic integration with the U. S. However, the thesis shows that neither Japan, nor the U. S., dominates the Pacific Basin Rim. Some countries, such as Thailand, present closer links with the U. S., and others, such as Korea and Taiwan, with Japan. The evidence provided in the thesis has implications for international portfolio diversification and for the use of foreign exchange restrictions to isolate local capital markets from world market influences...|$|R
40|$|According to the European Commission (2012), RPAS {{constitute}} a very promising new {{sector in the}} aerospace field in Europe. The emerging technology of RPAS and the variety of their civil applications (corporate, governmental, commercial, non-military) that make them useful for the military {{as well as the}} civil sector are related to monitoring tasks for a long period or flights with high risk through which RPAS can be beneficial for the citizens. However, there are some barriers that prevent the smooth and fast implementation of the wide civil utilization of RPAS. The dilemmas are among others {{the extent to which the}} European citizens accept the civil use of RPAS. Privacy issues and safety for example, are considered to be a constraint for the social acceptance of RPAS operations in civilian airspace and may influence the public perception regarding the development of the civil RPAS market. In this research the complex challenges related to SA of RPAS are studied through the identification of shared beliefs and perceptions among the citizens and through the understanding of their characteristics. A literature review as well as a critical reflection on it provides a definition of social acceptance of technological project that scientifically supports this research. Further literature review is used to address the problem, presenting the two polarized opinions; the supporters of the development of the civil RPAS market and the opponents. Moreover, a theoretical study of subjectivity related to risk perception merges the safety characteristics of RPAS with the issue of social acceptance. Q methodology is the quantitative and qualitative tool that is used in this research to study human subjectivity and answer how and why people have a specific opinion about RPAS. Through focus groups, the participants provided a list with statements regarding civil RPAS and their applications, which give a first indication on the issues at stake regarding this emerging market according to the public. These statements are ranked by the participants in this study in order to identify the underlying values that drive their perception. The quantitative analysis showed three factors that share common perspectives, attributing high significance to the possibility of an infringement of privacy as well as improving the current technical safety level of RPAS. Other conditions under which the public is willing to accept the wide utilization of civil RPAS are identified and interpreted combined with the theoretical underlying values that may influence human subjectivity. The analysis provides RPAS community insights on the shared perspectives of the public as well as a first comparison between the experts’ and laypeople viewpoints and areas of consensus and disagreement among them. A constructive dialogue among the policy makers, RPAS managers and the public can be structured having certain reference or starting points. The outcome of the research can be utilized while developing the regulation regime of the civil RPAS market in Europe, during which opposing public opinions may appear. The results that this research has provided can be utilized as a basis for further studies in the field of SA of civil RPAS in order to further identify the <b>market</b> characteristics, their <b>interrelations</b> and the influence they have on social acceptance of civil RPAS.
