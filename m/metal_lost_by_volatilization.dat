Precise {{measurement of the}} actual concentrations {{was considered to be}} of minor importance in these series of increasing concentrations. In addition, the half-lives of flubendiamide (20.2  days; Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority 2009) and spirotetramat (8.6 – 47.6  days; PRD 2008; U.S. EPA 2008) in neutral and acidic environments are greater than the water-renewal times applied in the present experiment. Furthermore, the active components are not highly volatile (vapor pressures: flubendiamide < 10 − 4 Pa; spirotetramat 5.6  ×  10 − 9 Pa). Endosulfan is stable at ambient temperature (CCME 2010). Although its vapor pressure (0.83  mPa at 20  °C) indicates that it is semi-volatile (Tomlin 2000), its half-life of 4 – 7  days in natural water is greater than the water-renewal time used here. We therefore did not expect a significant quantity of these compounds to be <b>lost</b> <b>by</b> <b>volatilization</b> during the study.|$|R

Com o propósito de avaliar a eficiência do gesso agrícola e do superfosfato simples em controlar as perdas de amônia por volatilização durante o processo de compostagem de estéreos, foi conduzido um experimento em frascos de vidro fechados de 1, 6 litro de capacidade, nos quais diferentes quantidades (50, 100, 150 e 200 kg. t- 1) daqueles materiais foram misturadas com um substrato composto de uma mistura de partes iguais (em massa) de estéreos frescos de galinha e de bovino.

Initial experiments showed that HgCl 2 added to growth mediun. at I mgg -I r did not markedly affect the growth of non-immobilized Chiorella at io cell ml. Batch culture experiments using 203 Hg showed that whilst mercury was removed from medium and accumulated by alginate-immobilized and non-immobilized Clzlorella, a considerable amount of mercury was <b>lost</b> <b>by</b> <b>volatilization.</b> Inunobilized cells accumulated significantly more mercury than non-immobilized cells at higher inoculum densities, probably due to greater growth of immobilized cells.

Calcium alginate caused mercury volatilization, probably due to a chemical factor capable of transforming mercury to a more volatile form. Continuous-flow studies using packed-bed reactors showed that unstocked agarose exhibited less mercury volatitlization than alginate.

The effect of palmarosa oil in causing K+ leakage from yeast cells was attributed mainly to geraniol. Some leakage of magnesium ions was also observed.

40|$|Shallow, mixed raceway ponds {{can be used}} to grow microalgae for {{the dual}} {{purposes}} of wastewater treatment and biofuel feedstock production. To improve the environmental sustainability of microalgae biofuels and to alleviate resource limitations, nutrients remaining after biofuel production should be recycled for additional cultivation. This thesis considers three topics: wastewater treatment by algae, nitrogen and phosphorus assimilation by algae, and algae cell disruption to facilitate nutrient recovery. The main experimental work was done in pilot raceway ponds growing polycultures of microalgae on clarified municipal wastewater. In addition, two lab-scale pretreatment technologies were tested for their ability to disrupt cells, as indicated by subsequent biomass organic nitrogen and particulate phosphorus degradation during sequential anaerobic and aerobic digestion. The two pretreatment technologies were sonication and high-pressure homogenization. The raceway pond research was conducted at the City of San Luis Obispo Water Resource Recovery Facility (WRRF). Nine 30 -m 2, 0. 3 -m deep raceway ponds were operated continuously from March 1, 2013 to August 31, 2014. The ponds were arranged in three sets of triplicates. One set was operated at a 2 -day hydraulic residence time (HRT) on clarified wastewater throughout the study. A second set (“Round 1 ” of ponds-in-series) was operated at a 3 -day HRT, also on clarified wastewater. Its effluent was clarified and then discharged into the third set (“Round 2 ” of ponds-in-series), which initially operated at a 4 -day HRT but then later a 3 -day HRT. The nutrient removal and assimilation data were compared seasonally—summer (March–October) and winter (November–February). The triplicate raceways operating at a 2 -day HRT achieved average total ammonia nitrogen (TAN) removal efficiencies of 11 % in the winter and 71 % in the summer, while dissolved reactive phosphorus (DRP) removal remained similar throughout seasonality. In the first ponds-in-series experiment (3 -day HRT followed by 4 -day), average summer TAN removal efficiencies for Round 1 and 2 were 88 % and nearly 100 %, respectively. Round 1 and 2 average summer DRP removal efficiencies were 29 % and 67 %, respectively. The first ponds-in-series experiment was not conducted in the winter. In the second experiment, the Round 2 HRT was changed to 3 days. Average TAN removal efficiencies for Round 2 in the winter and summer were 88 % and 100 %, respectively. DRP removal for Round 2 increased from 38 % in the winter to 66 % in the summer. Total nitrogen (TN) mass balances on the raceway pond experiments were useful to illustrate the fate of influent nitrogen, including losses. In the first ponds-in-series experiment, 76 % of the influent soluble nitrogen was converted to organic nitrogen by assimilation, while 6 % of the influent ammonia was <b>lost</b> <b>by</b> <b>volatilization.</b> In the second ponds-in-series experiment, 81 % of the influent soluble nitrogen was converted to organic nitrogen by assimilation and only 1 % of the influent ammonia was <b>lost</b> <b>by</b> <b>volatilization.</b> The 2 -day HRT raceway experiment achieved 41 % conversion of influent soluble nitrogen to organic nitrogen by assimilation, with influent ammonia losses of 3 % <b>by</b> <b>volatilization.</b> In addition to these pilot-scale raceway pond experiments, laboratory experiments were conducted on re-solubilization of algae biomass nutrients to support additional algae growth. Algae harvested from the pilot ponds was pre-treated with either sonication or high-pressure homogenization. The pretreated biomass was then subjected to anaerobic digestion and then aerobic digestion to increased nitrogen and phosphorus solubilization. The laboratory anaerobic digestion simulated pilot digestion, also conducted at the pilot facility, and the aerobic digestion was meant to simulate further re-solubilization that would occur when algae digestate was returned to the aerobic raceway ponds to promote further algae growth. Neither pre-treatment technologies {{had a significant impact on}} degradation of biomass organic nitrogen and particulate phosphorus compared to controls. It was found that simple anaerobic digestion followed by aerobic digestion resolubilized 90 % of organic nitrogen and 50 % of particulate phosphorus...|$|R
40|$|Energetic {{feedback}} from Supernovae and stellar winds can drive galactic winds. Dwarf galaxies, {{due to their}} shallower potential wells, {{are assumed to be}} more vulnerable to this phenomenon. Metal loss through galactic winds is also commonly invoked to explain the low metal content of dwarf galaxies. Our main aim in this paper is to show that galactic mass cannot be the only parameter determining the fraction of <b>metals</b> <b>lost</b> <b>by</b> a galaxy. In particular, the distribution of gas must play an equally important role. We perform 2 -D chemo-dynamical simulations of galaxies characterized by different gas distributions, masses and gas fractions. The gas distribution can change the fraction of <b>lost</b> <b>metals</b> through galactic winds by up to one order of magnitude. In particular, disk-like galaxies tend to loose metals more easily than roundish ones. Consequently, also the final metallicities attained by models with the same mass but with different gas distributions can vary by up to one dex. Confirming previous studies, we also show that the fate of gas and freshly produced metals strongly depends on the mass of the galaxy. Smaller galaxies (with shallower potential wells) more easily develop large-scale outflows, therefore the fraction of <b>lost</b> <b>metals</b> tends to be higher.

40|$|Swine manure {{subjected}} to in-storage psychrophilic anaerobic digestion (ISPAD) undergoes proteins degradation but limited NH 3 volatilization, producing an effluent rich in plant-available nitrogen. Accordingly, ISPAD effluent {{can offer a}} higher fertilizer value during land application, as compared to manure of similar age stored in an open tank. However, this additional nitrogen can also be <b>lost</b> <b>by</b> <b>volatilization</b> during land application. The objective {{of this study was}} therefore to measure NH 3 volatilization from both ISPAD and open tank swine manures when applied to 5 different soils, namely, washed sand, a Ste Rosalie clay, an Upland sandy loam, a St Bernard loam, and an Ormstown loam. This research was conducted using laboratory wind tunnels simulating land application. The five experimental soils offered similar pH values but different water holding capacity, cation exchange capacity, cation saturation, and organic matter. After 47 [*]h of wind tunnel monitoring, the % of total available nitrogen (TAN or NH 4 [*]+ and NH 3) volatilized varied with both manure and soil type. For all soil types, the ISPAD manure consistently lost less NH 3 as compared to the open tank manure, averaging 53 % less. Lower volatile solids content improving manure infiltration into the soil and a more complex ionic solution explain the effect of the ISPAD manure advantages. This was reinforced by the St Bernard sandy loam losing the same nitrogen mass for both manures, because of its higher pH and buffer pH coupled with an intermediate CEC resulting in more soil solution NH 3. Within each manure type, % TAN volatilized was highest for washed sand and lowest for the clay soil. As a result, ISPAD manure can offer up to 21 % more plant-available nitrogen fertilizer especially when the manure is not incorporated into the soil following its application...|$|R
40|$|Nitrogen cycling in the soil-plant-atmosphere {{has been}} a topic of {{considerable}} interest over the years. Nitrogen balance studies showed {{that not all of}} the soil and fertilizer N could be accounted for {{at the end of the}} growing season. In addition to losses by drainage, run-off and erosion, gaseous losses are at least partly responsible for the discrepancy between input and output of nitrogen. Gaseous losses occur <b>by</b> NH 3 <b>volatilization</b> from fertilizers, NOx, N 2 O and N- 2 losses by denitrification and nitrification and from NH 3 losses from crops. Ammonia <b>volatilization</b> is governed <b>by</b> the chemical characteristics of the soil (pH, CaCO 3 content, CEC), by climatological conditions (temperature and moisture content) and by agricultural practices. Urea hydrolysis causes a pH increase and thus NH 3 volatilization, even in soils with a low pH. Without precautions, more than 50 % of the total NH 4 +-N content in slurry and more than 30 % of the N-content in urea and NH 4 +-containing fertilizers can be <b>lost</b> <b>by</b> <b>volatilization</b> of NH 3. Low temperatures, high moisture contents and/or the quick incorporation of applied fertilizers (organic or inorganic) will reduce these losses. Although abiotic production of NO and N 2 O is possible, the main processes responsible for the formation of these products are denitrification or as a side product of the nitrification process. Total losses, including N- 2 production, can be of the order of 20 - 30 kg N ha(- 1). Available nitrate and organic matter, low oxygen contents as well as some management practices and environmental factors are responsible for high losses by denitrification. Irrigation, common in vegetable cropping systems, can result in higher losses compared to arable crops. Ammonia losses from or absorption by crops depends on the ammonia compensation point. Although there is clear evidence that NH 3 losses from crops occur, further research is needed to quantify the net losses more exactly...|$|R

Here are presented results regarding the fate of the fertilizer nitrogen (N) applied to a coffee plantation related to the prevailing soil water conditions. Soil water balances are discussed, which allowed evaluation of the root distribution, determinations of the crop coefficient and of the soil water conditions during the development of the crop. Approximately, 60 % of the root system was distributed in the 0 - 0. 3 m soil layer and the average crop coefficient was 1. 1 for 3 to 5 year old plants. Using an N label, the 15 N, it was possible to study the distribution of N in the plant and in the soil and establishes general N balances, which also include losses like leaching and volatilization. After two years of ammonium sulfate application, at rates of 280 (1 st year) and 350 (2 nd year) kg. ha- 1 of N, in four equal application performed during the period of positive growth rate, the recuperation of fertilizer N were 19. 1 % by the aerial plant part and 9. 4 % by the roots, 12. 6 % remained in the soil and 11. 2 % in the litter; 0. 9 % was <b>lost</b> <b>by</b> <b>volatilization</b> and 2. 3 % by leaching; 26. 3 % was exported through harvesting and 18. 2 % remained in non evaluated compartments.

40|$|Low {{availability}} of nitrogen (N) {{is a factor}} that limits forage production. Pastures are mostly formed of grasses, which need large N amounts to sustain high yields. Additionally, the {{availability of}} this nutrient affects the persistence {{and quality of the}} forage produced. However, when applying fertilizers containing nitrogen up to 50 % can be lost, making their use costly for farmers. N is a highly volatile gas, and urea, widely used in agriculture, contains 46 % N. When urea comes in contact with moisture in the soil, hydrolysis occurs due to the precipitation of the enzyme urease, accelerating the transformation of urea into ammonia, which can be <b>lost</b> <b>by</b> <b>volatilization.</b> One of the techniques to increase the efficiency of using urea is application of nitrogen fertilizers along with urease inhibitors, to retard the breakdown of urea so that it becomes incorporated in the soil slowly. One of the inhibitors used is N-(n-butyl) phosphate triamide (NBPT). This study aimed to assess the effect of nitrogen sources and doses on some productive characteristics of Áries grass (Panicum maximum, Jacq) to find ways to improve the effectiveness of nitrogen application. The tests were performed at Centro Nutrição Animal e Pastagens – Instituto de Zootecnia in Nova Odessa, São Paulo, from March to August 2012. The experimental design was randomized blocks, with five replications in 2 x 3 factorial setup, where we studied the use of urea and urea containing urease inhibitor (NPBT), in pottery vessels (3. 34 dm 3).

Both sampling and the sample preparation are crucial stages for any trace analysis. Knowledge of numerous factors and strict adherance to all the requirements is unavoidable, if results are to be reliable. Sampling of biological material involves some fundamental aspects such as representative mean composition, representative variance, accuracy and efficiency of sampling. The general sampling methods used may be random, systematic or of differentiated types. Various parameters such as size of the totality of material, number {{and size of the}} particles, distribution of trace elements between different types of particles influence the optimal size of the sample. There are some basic hazards in trace element analysis, which arise from contamination of the sample by the elements, lass of trace elements and change in mean composition with respect to the elements to be analysed. Contamination of the sample may occur fromthe environment, the sampling operation itself and the operating personnel. Trace elements may be <b>lost</b> <b>by</b> <b>volatilization</b> during drying and ashing, adsorption on container walls and handling tools, overlooked differences in the chemical state of the element and also bysputtering and spraying in case of liquids. The changes in the mean trace element composition of the sample may result from the physical or chemical changes and by redistribution of the elements. The main sampling operations for solid tissues include the selection of an optimal sampling method, the sampling site and the preparation of the sampling equipment.

Sample preparation of biological material is necessary in order to prepare the samples for obtaining the analytical signal.

We find that potassium shows a remarkable isotopic homogeneity in various solar system bodies, {{even though there}} are chemical depletions of a factor of about 30, between Cl chondrites and eucrites and lunar samples. Theories that propose the evaporation of volatile elements from initially condensed (Cl chondrite) material to account for such chemical depletions, necessarily imply the existence of large isotopic mass fractionations, e. g., about + 40 % 0 for Earth, + 90 % 0 for eucrites and lunar rocks.

40|$|Foliar urea {{was applied}} {{as a source}} of late-N between flag leaf {{emergence}} and anthesis to winter wheat crops that had received varying rates of basal-N fertilizer in the spring in order to produce crops with differently sized GAI). The crops grown were: no N fertilizer applied (NO), conventionally fertilized (Net), a Canopy Managed crop grown to a GAI 5 (GAI 5), at IACR-Rothamsted in 1995, {{with the addition of a}} GAI 3 crop (GAI 3) at IACR-Rothamsted in 1994 and at Sutton Bonington in 1995. Each of the applications of late-N as foliar urea resulted in the prolongation of GAI of Canopy Managed crops, irrespective of the timing, amount of N applied, or whether adjuvants were used. The date of complete death of canopy green area was similar for all foliar urea treatments due to the sunny, warm, dry weather at the end of July in both 1994 and 1995, at both sites. The duration of canopy green area was associated with its N content at anthesis, as well as with water availability and the prevailing weather conditions, such that Ncf crops, containing significantly more N than GAI 5 crops at anthesis, retained green area for a longer period than the GAI 5 crops. The application of foliar urea did not always result in an increase in grain yield or quality and the partitioning of biomass and N to the grain was also seemingly unaffected by the application of foliar urea. However, yields from GAI 5 crops receiving late-N as foliar urea, irrespective of the method of application, were not significantly different to those obtained from Ncf crops. The amount of N deposited and the pattern of deposition were affected by canopy size. Applications made prior to ear emergence penetrated more deeply into the canopy. The top half of the canopy, flag leaf to flag- 1 and the ear when present, was the most important site for both N interception and uptake. A maximum of 60 % of the applied N was intercepted by the GAI 5 crops and 10 % remained on the surface of the crop 96 hours later. 35 % of the N 'lost' from the crop surface was taken up over 96 hours. Of the remaining 40 % of the applied N, an estimated 10 % was <b>lost</b> <b>by</b> <b>volatilization,</b> 5 % <b>by</b> drift and 25 % penetrated to the soil surface. N uptake from the leaf surface probably followed an exponential pattern through time. The time for half of the N present initially to be lost (t 0. 5), was unaffected by the side of the leaf to which N was applied, the age of the leaf growth stage of the plant or the amount of N applied. t 0. 5 was improved only by the addition of a spreader or a penetrant. By harvest up to 64 % of the fertilizer N applied was recovered by the GAI 5 crop of which 87 % was present in the grain.

The gross recovery rate of applied nitrogen from surface application of LPD was less than that from incorporation of LPD and chemical fertilizer.

In {{the first part of}} this thesis I demonstrate the ubiquitous presence of extended low ionisation emission-line regions (LIERs) in both late- and early-type galaxies. By studying the Hα equivalent width and diagnostic line ratios radial profiles, together with tracers of the underlying stellar popula- tion, I show that LIERs are not due to a central point source but to hot evolved (post-asymptotic giant branch) stars. In light of this, I suggest a new classification scheme for galaxies based on their line emission. By analysing the colours, star formation rates, morphologies, gas and stellar kinematics and environmental properties of galaxies with substantial LIER emission, I identify two distinct popula- tions. Galaxies where the central regions are LIER-like, but show star formation at larger radii are late types in which star formation is slowly quenched inside-out. This transformation is associated with massive bulges. Galaxies dominated by LIER emission at all radii, on the other hand, are red-sequence galaxies harbouring a residual cold gas component, acquired mostly via external accretion. Quiescent galaxies devoid of line emission reside in denser environments, which suggests environmental effects as a likely cause for the existence of line-less galaxies on the red sequence. In the second part of this dissertation I focus on the study of resolved chemical abundances by characterising the gas phase oxygen and nitrogen abundance gradients in a large sample of star forming galaxies. I analyse the deviations from an exponential profile at small and large radii and the dependence of the gradients on stellar mass. These findings are interpreted in the context of the inside-out paradigm of disc growth. I then demonstrate the necessity of gas flows, which are responsible for the observed flattening of the metallicity and N/O ratio gradients at large radii. Finally, I present a case study based on one nearby galaxy (NGC 628), in which I combine IFS and cold gas data to derive a spatially resolved metal budget and estimate the mass of <b>metals</b> <b>lost</b> <b>by</b> the galaxy throughout its life- time. By using simple physically-motivated models of chemical evolution I infer the average outflow loading factor to be of order unity. STF...|$|R

The objective of thi s study was to evaluate doses, sources and times of nitrogen appli cation in rice of high lands cropped in no till sys tem. The work was conducted in Selvíria, State of Mato Gross o do Sul, Brazil, in a soil originally under Cerrad o vegeta- tion. A randomized blocks design, with the treatmen ts disposed in a factorial scheme 5 x 3 x 2 was used. T he treatments were constituted by five nitrogen doses (0, 50, 100, 150 and 200 kg ha - 1), three nitrogen sources (urea; ammonium sulfonitrate plus nitrification inh itor and ammonium sulfate) and two application time s (at sowing or at flower bud differentiation), with four repetitions. The sources of nitrogen, as well as t he applica- tion times had similar effects for most of evaluati ons. The N doses influenced linearly or with quadra tic adjust- ment the plant height, N leaf content and grains yi eld, in the two growing seasons. The chlorophyll co ntent and the number of ears m - 2 were affected only, in the first year. The highest yield in the growing season of 2007 / 08 was obtained with the dose of 149 kg ha - 1 of N.

40|$|In plant {{nitrogen}} metabolism, {{a significant}} role is played {{not only by the}} uptake of nitrogen compounds but also by their release into the environment. One {{of the ways in which}} plant nitrogen is released is the volatilization of reduced and oxidized nitrogen forms through the above-ground plant organs. During the growing season, depending on plant species, genotype and environmental conditions, plants may release <b>by</b> <b>volatilization</b> a significant portion of their nitrogen uptake and up to 80 kg of ammonia per hectare. Besides releasing ammonia into the atmosphere, plants also take it up from the atmosphere and thus partially compensate for their ammonia losses <b>by</b> <b>volatilization.</b> These losses can be reduced by plant breeding by developing genotypes with reduced ammonia releases and a more effective reassimilation of the ammonia quantities released. Attempts have been made to reduce the volatilization of nitrogen compounds from the above-ground plant parts by applying physiologically active substances...|$|R
40|$|Nitrogen {{fertilization}} is a {{major component}} of the cost of agricultural production, due to the high cost and low efficiency of fertilizers. In the case of urea, the low efficiency is mainly due to losses <b>by</b> <b>volatilization,</b> which are more pronounced in cultivation systems in which plant residues are left on the soil. The objective of this work was to compare the influence of urea coated with sulfur or boric acid and copper sulfate with conventional N fertilizers on N volatilization losses in sugar cane harvested after stubble burning. The sources urea, sulfur-coated urea, urea coated with boric acid and copper sulfate, as well as nitrate and ammonium sulfate, were tested at amounts containing N rates of 120 kg ha- 1 N. The integration of new technologies in urea fertilization can reduce N losses <b>by</b> <b>volatilization.</b> These losses were most reduced when using nitrate and ammonium sulfate.

40|$|Prior {{studies at}} Iowa State University tend to {{indicate}} that petroleum products such as gasoline, diesel fuel, and crude oil can be removed from soil by bioremediation. These studies also indicate that gasoline would largely be removed <b>by</b> <b>volatilization</b> and that diesel fuel would not. The purpose of my research was to investigate volatilization as a competing process {{for the removal of}} fuels with bioremediation. If the rate of removal <b>by</b> <b>volatilization</b> is fast enough, biological processes might only make a small contribution to the overall removal that is observed. If the rate of removal <b>by</b> <b>volatilization</b> is slow enough, biological processes would make the major contribution to the overall process;In my research, several factors were investigated for their effect on volatilization in order to develop the mathematical model and predict the fate of petroleum products in sand. These effects include particle size, initial concentration of petroleum products, moisture content, and organic matter used for bioremediation agents. Results indicate that these factors did not {{play a significant role in}} volatilization of petroleum products in sand;These results also provided a basis for modeling the volatilization process. One of the models was a material balance model developed as a part of this study. The other was a published model based on a heat transfer analogy. The model based on the heat transfer analogy did a very poor job of fitting the data whereas the material balance model fit the data better. In addition to having value in predicting rates of volatilization, the material balance model explains why the rate of volatilization for gasoline is so much higher than it is for diesel fuel. Both models recognize that <b>volatilization</b> is driven <b>by</b> the vapor gradient that is developed in the pore space. The material balance model also accounts for the volatility of the fuel and the part it plays in establishing the vapor gradient that drives volatilization...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT High {{nitrogen}} losses <b>by</b> ammonia <b>volatilization</b> {{are expected}} when urea {{is used as}} the source of N. The use of controlled-release urea and urease inhibitors are possible strategies to reduce such losses and increase nitrogen use efficiency. This study aimed to evaluate nitrogen losses <b>by</b> ammonia <b>volatilization</b> from stabilized, slow and controlled release urea and its absorption by maize grown under no-till in an improved Cerrado soil. Four N sources were used: conventional urea, urea + N-(n-butyl) thiophosphoric triamide (NBPT), urea + Cu and B and urea coated by sulfur + polymers. These N sources were surface applied along the rows using three N doses of 100, 150 and 200 kg ha- 1. No N was added to the control. Data were collected regarding N losses <b>by</b> <b>volatilization,</b> the N contents accumulated in the stubble and grains, and the yields of the stubble and grains. Stabilized urea and slow release urea were efficient for postponing the ammonia volatilization peaks. The urease inhibitors postponed the peaks for up to two days, reducing the accumulated <b>volatilization</b> <b>by</b> 18 % when compared with common urea. Polymer sulfur coated urea resulted in a 37 % reduction in ammonia volatilization. Increasing the N application rate to 200 kg ha- 1 resulted in 16 % greater yields and 37 % greater N accumulation in the plants relative to the control. However, the stabilized and slow-release urea did not improve the N accumulation or yield. Consequently, the nitrogen use efficiency of maize was not improved relative to the use of conventional urea...|$|R

This work aimed at quantifying ammonia volatilization (N-NH 3) losses from N-sources to be used in coffee plantations fertilization in Brazil. The experiment was conducted in the field on a dystrophic red latosol (Ferralsol in FAO's classification) at the Coffee Research Sector, University of Lavras, MG, Brazil. The experimental design was of complete randomized blocks with three repetitions of the following treatments: conventional urea, ammonium nitrate and urea + 0. 15 % Cu and 0. 4 % B, urea + anionic polymers, urea + elementary sulfur (S 0) + polymers, and urea + plastic resin. These N sources were split into three doses of 150 kg ha- 1 and band applied. The N-NH 3 losses <b>by</b> <b>volatilization</b> and variations of pH (H 2 O) were measured, before and after N application. The N-sources contributed to reduce the soil pH, measured after the third nitrogen fertilization. The N-NH 3 losses <b>by</b> <b>volatilization</b> (average from three applications) was as follows: urea + anionic polymers (35. 8 %) > conventional urea (31. 2 %) = urea + S 0 + polymers (31. 0 %) > urea + 0. 15 % Cu + 0. 4 % B (25. 6 %) > urea + plastic resin (8. 6 %) = ammonium nitrate (1. 0 %) ...|$|R
