40|$|Energy {{efficiency}} {{is a national}} priority for China as rapid energy consumption growth aggravates its greenhouse gas emissions, local air pollution and energy scarcity. In the 1990 s, {{a large number of}} voluntary agreements emerged in industrialised countries in order to improve industrial energy efficiency. These experiences are now taken into account in China. This article analyses the drivers for voluntary agreements on industrial energy efficiency in China, based on a case study of three enterprises in Nanjing, Jiangsu Province. Furthermore, the article reviews the institutional set-up of energy policy and investigates the pertaining policy culture. From the findings, conclusions are drawn on the role of voluntary agreements within China's larger policy context. We conclude that opposed to avoiding stricter regulation, voluntary agreements in Nanjing are reinterpreted in view of <b>more</b> <b>stringent</b> national <b>provisions</b> on energy efficiency in the 11 th Five Year Plan. Hence, agreements have evolved into an implementation tool of national policy at the local level. For industry, another major driver for participation was identified as improving its relations with local authorities. Voluntary agreements showed to have the potential to overcome traditional constraints of implementing top-down policies at the local level in China.

40|$|By pushing debtors {{into the}} <b>more</b> <b>stringent</b> <b>provisions</b> of Chapter 13, the Bank-ruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act passed in 2005 aimed to dis-courage debtors from taking {{advantage}} of U. S. Personal Bankruptcy Law. Despite a growing literature on consumer bankruptcy, however, there exists virtually no empir-ical evidence {{on the performance of}} Chapter 13. In this paper, we construct a novel dataset based on information obtained from court docket records 8 ̆ 5 led between 2001 and 2002 in the state of Delaware. We present three main 8 ̆ 5 ndings. First, our data indicate that the median creditor recovery rate is actually zero under Chapter 13 both for secured and unsecured debt. Second, close to twenty percent of 8 ̆ 5 lers are dismissed without ever obtaining con 8 ̆ 5 rmation of even one plan. Third, less than forty percent of debtors actually receive a 8 ̆ 5 nancial fresh start by having their debts discharged. To account for these stylized facts, we then build and estimate a structural model of bankruptcy under Chapter 13. The analysis reveals statistically signi 8 ̆ 5 cant trade o¤s between proposing a long-term plan versus a short-term plan. A longer plan is costly in that debtors make larger overall payments, but it {{is more likely to be}} con 8 ̆ 5 rmed by the court.

40|$|The Parental Leave Directive 96 / 34 /EC is {{the only}} EU {{directive}} which was adopted with the specific aim of enabling working parents to reconcile work and family responsibilities thorough the use of parental leave and leave for urgent family reasons. This thesis consists of an exploration of this Directive {{in terms of how}} it shapes law at national level in the UK and Poland with references to,;;' selected Member States. The legal analysis undertaken in this thesis is informed by socio-Iegal methodologies and feminist perspectives. It aims to explore the legislative contribution of the EU to addressing the complex and diverse issues surrounding the interaction between work and caring responsibilities for children and adult dependants. At the core of this thesis is the concept of choice {{and the extent to which}} the Directive has assisted working parents in making genuine reconciliation choices. As this Directive was the first reconciliation measure to be based on a framework agreement concluded by Social Partners, the legal basis for their involvement in the EU decision making process is explored and analysed. The thesis considers whether the change in the legislative process in favour of the involvement of Social Partners, has resulted in the adoption of the Directive on parental leave containing <b>more</b> <b>stringent</b> <b>provisions</b> than those envisaged in the Commission proposals for a Directive on parental leave blocked by the Council in the 1980 s. It argues that the Directive has failed to provide workers with the effective rights to parental leave and leave for urgent family reasons which could enable them to make genuine reconciliation choices. This failure has been further reinforced by national legislators to the detriment of workers with caring responsibilities for children and adult dependants in the UK and Poland. The thesis uses a comparative legal approach in order explore the way forward for further development of the EU law by considering the approaches, rules and standards that should be adopted or reinforced in law in order to ensure that the discussed leave entitlements become more effective reconciliation tools.
