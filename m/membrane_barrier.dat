40|$|Guided bone {{regeneration}} (GBR) can {{be described}} as the use of a <b>barrier</b> <b>membrane</b> to provide a space available for new bone formation in a bony defect. The <b>barrier</b> <b>membrane</b> protects the defect from in-growth of soft tissue cells and allows bone progenitor cells to develop bone within a blood clot that is formed beneath the <b>barrier</b> <b>membrane.</b> Furthermore, the membrane excludes inhibiting factors from outside the defect and preserves bone growth factors inside. GBR was developed in the 1950 s and 1960 s and has been applied in trauma and reconstructive surgery. In the 1980 s, clinicians started to use <b>barrier</b> <b>membranes</b> in implant dentistry. The membranes were applied to reconstruct small bony defects prior to implantation or to cover dehiscences or fenestrations around dental implants. In large defects a bone graft is frequently necessary. The bone graft serves as a scaffold and carrier for living cells. However, bone grafting is not always successful because of graft resorption or insufficient graft incorporation. To enhance the predictability of bone augmentation procedures, in the mid 1990 s grafts were covered with <b>barrier</b> <b>membranes</b> in an attempt to prevent bone graft resorption. A <b>barrier</b> <b>membrane</b> would prevent graft resorption and possibly would enhance graft incorporation by keeping the osteoinductive substances in place and secluding the grafted area from inhibiting factors and connective tissue cells. The overlying <b>barrier</b> <b>membrane</b> would maintain space in remaining crevices for bone regeneration. Although most studies have been uncontrolled, the application of <b>barrier</b> <b>membranes</b> to cover bone grafts is now widespread among clinicians because the reported results were promising. However, in maxillofacial surgery and implant dentistry a continuing debate exists as to whether a <b>barrier</b> <b>membrane</b> should be applied to cover autologous onlay bone block grafts when augmenting the jaw. It is desirable that this question is answered because the use of <b>barrier</b> <b>membrane</b> may have adverse effects and is rather expensive. Numerous membranes have been developed throughout the years. Although the standard reference materials, i. e., a porcine bilayer collagen membrane for biodegradable membranes and a synthetic expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE) membrane for non-degradable membranes, have been established as being successful in covering defects, there are some disadvantages to their application. Collagen has poor space making properties in wet conditions and its composition of animal derived collagen may possibly lead to disease transmission from animal to people, at least theoretically. The ePTFE is non-degradable and therefore must be removed in an additional surgical procedure. Furthermore, the membrane has to be removed when exposed to the oral cavity to resolve an inflammatory reaction that occurs. The 'ideal' <b>barrier</b> <b>membrane</b> for alveolar ridge augmentation is thus not yet applied in clinical practice. The 'ideal' membrane should be both biodegradable and synthetic.

The release of prolyl hydroxylase inhibi-tors was assessed by colorimetric and spectroscopic methods. Their ability to induce a cellular response was assessed in bioassays with gingival and periodontal ligament fibroblasts based on vascular endothelial growth factor production, proliferation, and metabolic activity of the cells. We found that loading of collagen <b>barrier</b> <b>membranes</b> with prolyl hydroxylase inhibitors did not change the overall membrane morphology. Assessment of the release kinetics by direct measurements and based on vascular endothelial growth factor production showed that supernatants obtained from the collagen <b>barrier</b> <b>membranes</b> in the first 6 hours had a sufficient level of prolyl hydroxylase inhibitors to induce vascular endothelial growth factor production. A similar kinetic was found when cell proliferation was assessed. Changes in metabolic activity did not reach the level of significance in the MTTassay.

Simian Virus 40 (SV 40) pirates the endocytic pathway of the host cell for transport from the cell surface until it reaches the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Within the ER lumen the capsid {{is thought to be}} disassembled releasing the viral genome which then must be transported across the ER and nuclear <b>membrane</b> <b>barriers</b> to initiate viral replication. Following replication the SV 40 viral progeny must cross the nuclear plasma membrane without becoming membrane encapsulated. To overcome these obstacles during release, viruses such as SV 40 utilize a lytic infectious cycle that results in the permeabilization of the host cell membranes through an unknown mechanism. ^ The research presented here utilized numerous techniques to investigate the roles of the minor structural proteins in the SV 40 life cycle. VP 2 and VP 3 were both shown to perform essential functions with VP 2 contributing to cell binding while VP 3 functioned downstream of this event. Both VP 3 and VP 2 showed the ability to post-translationally integrate into the ER membrane where VP 3 attained a multi-membrane spanning topology. These findings combined with the propensity of VP 2 and VP 3 to oligomerize and permeabilize bacterial membranes provide the premise for the following hypothesis. We propose that upon disassembly in the ER lumen these minor structural oligomerize and integrate into the ER membrane where they act as a viroporin to aid in the transfer of the viral genome across the ER membrane. ^ The SV 40 mutant lacking both the VP 2 and VP 3 initiation codons revealed that in addition to VP 3, another viral protein was synthesized from the VP 2 reading frame. This protein we termed VP 4 is expressed at the onset of lysis, it is not sequestered by VP 1 and its removal inhibited the lytic property of VP 3 towards E. coli and caused a significant 2 day delay in cell lysis during infection.

We used the Caco- 2 cell line grown in control (C), zinc-deficient, or zinc-replete medium until differentiation. Zinc deprivation induced a decrease of transepithelial electrical resistance and alterations to tight and adherens junctions, with delocalization of zonula occludens (ZO- 1), occludin, beta-catenin, and E-cadherin. Disorganization of F-actin and beta-tubulin was also found in zinc deficiency. These changes were associated with a loss of the amounts of ZO- 1, occluding, and beta-tubulin. In addition, zinc deficiency caused a dephosphorylation of occludin and hyperphosphorylation of beta-catenin and ZO- 1.

In contrast to fructans, dextran did not increase the lamellar repeat distance and it even promoted Lβ phase formation.
