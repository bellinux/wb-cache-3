For that, recent economic theory views rivalry as a continuum, not as a binary category, where many goods are somewhere between the two extremes of completely rival and completely non-rival. A perfectly non-rival good can be consumed simultaneously by an unlimited number of consumers.|$|E

5000|$|Exploits are digital products, {{which means}} that they are {{information}} goods with near-zero <b>marginal</b> <b>production</b> costs. However, they are atypical information goods. Unlike e-books or digital videos, they do not lose their value because they are easy to replicate but {{due to the fact that}} once they are exposed, the original developer will [...] "patch" [...] the vulnerability, decreasing the value of the commodity. The value will not go to zero for two reasons: (1) the distribution of the patch is asymmetric and (2) developers could use the original bug to create a variant at a decreased cost. They are also atypical because they are time-sensitive commodities. Companies are updating their software on a regular basis and a patch is only useful during the lapse between versions; sometimes a vulnerability can be corrected without any external report. Third, even in confidential transactions, the use of the exploit itself can create a dysfunction on the user end, exposing the vulnerability and leading to its lost of value. In this sense, exploits are non-excludable but they can or can not be non-rivalrous.|$|E

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{national}} energy policies {{on a local}} Swedish district heating (DH) system has been studied, regarding the profitability of new investments {{and the potential for}} climate change mitigation. The DH system has been optimised regarding three investments: biomass-fuelled CHP (bio CHP), natural gas-fuelled combined cycle CHP (NGCC CHP) and biomass-fuelled heat-only boiler (bio HOB) in two scenarios (with or without national taxes and policy instruments). In both scenarios EU's tradable CO 2 emission permits are included. Results from the study show that when national policies are included, the most cost-effective investment option is the bio CHP technology. However, when national taxes and policy instruments are excluded, the DH system containing the NGCC CHP plant has 30 % lower system cost than the bio CHP system. Regardless of the scenario and when coal condensing is considered as <b>marginal</b> electricity <b>production,</b> the NGCC CHP has the largest global CO 2 reduction potential, about 300 Â ktonne CO 2. However, the CO 2 reduction potential is highly dependent on the <b>marginal</b> electricity <b>production.</b> Demonstrated here is that national policies such as tradable green certificates can, when applied to DH systems, contribute to investments that will not fully utilise the DH systems' potential for global CO 2 emissions reductions.

While our findings go against the work of previous researchers, {{we are confident that}} our approach, which uses empirical data via ARDL regression, is more accurate. We are also confident that this approach {{is the best way to}} address the problems in Cote d’Ivoire’s cocoa industry. A massive increase in population can decreases production. Mankiw (2003) explains how population, as one of the essential factors in production, can affect production through its <b>marginal</b> <b>production.</b> The production per worker without technology can be the cause of this decline. According to Mankiw, population growth has a negative impact on income. <b>Marginal</b> <b>production</b> of labour allows researchers to measure the surplus production added to the previous production. So in a sense, it gives the difference between productions with total labour in year n[*]+[*] 1 and n (Mankiw). Once the output becomes stagnant, the production per worker stops increasing. We noticed that the <b>marginal</b> <b>production</b> of labour in Cote d’Ivoire does not appear efficient therefore it is not contributed.|$|E
40|$|Experts may {{disagree}} on when world oil production will peak, {{but there is}} general agreement that marginal fields will contribute {{a greater percentage of}} world supply in the future. As fields mature and operations transition into the later stages of their production cycle, decreasing revenue streams, higher operating costs, and fewer upside opportunities lead to declining profitability. Eventually, all properties are abandoned when cost exceeds the revenue of production. In this two-part paper on <b>marginal</b> <b>production</b> in the Gulf of Mexico, the number of marginal structures in the gulf and their expected contribution to future production is forecast using established economic models. In Part 1, a historical perspective on producing assets is provided and the inventory of committed assets is modeled and categorized.

40|$|More {{and more}} cities reduce CO 2 {{emissions}} by making {{investments in the}} local energy system, such as solar power production and energy efficiency measures. One important step for decision makers considering such investments is to assess the impacts concerning CO 2 emissions. The common methods used are average electricity <b>production</b> method and <b>marginal</b> electricity <b>production</b> method, which both have the drawback {{that they are not}} affected by the investment and do not consider power transfer limitations in the power system. Thus, the aim of the thesis is to estimate how investments in the local energy system will affect national CO 2 emissions. In the thesis a dispatch model of the Swedish power system is presented, {{as an alternative to the}} two aforementioned methods used for assessing the CO 2 emissions from an investment. The three methods are then employed in a case study where an investment is made in the heating sector of Gothenburg which results in a change in the production pattern from CHP district heating units. The result demonstrates that, for the case study, the changes in CO 2 emissions using the three methods differ. More specifically, the dispatch model, average electricity <b>production</b> method and <b>marginal</b> electricity <b>production</b> method show approximately + 16, - 27 and + 89 kton CO 2 change respectively, for the Swedish power system as a whole. In the dispatch model, the investment has negligible effects on the electricity generation in Sweden. Instead, it leads to a change in import and export. The increased import mainly comes from Norway and Denmark, while the increased export mostly goes to Finland. Denmark is responsible for most of the increased CO 2 imported to Sweden. In the average electricity production method, the investment is replaced by the Swedish average electricity generation, which has less CO 2 emissions. In the <b>marginal</b> electricity <b>production</b> method, the investment causes a response by coal condensing power plants, which has much higher CO 2 emissions. Hence, the dispatch model results in CO 2 emissions between these two extremes. Furthermore, increasing the level of the investment, i. e. reducing the electricity contribution coming from CHP district heating units further, shows that both the average electricity production method and the <b>marginal</b> electricity <b>production</b> method have a linear trend in the changed CO 2 emissions. However, the dispatch model indicates some fluctuations in the changed CO 2. This is due to the fluctuations in the net import from Denmark and Finland. The change in electricity mainly comes from net imports from Norway, Denmark and Finland. Moreover, electricity generation from condensing power plants displays a continuous increase in electricity generation, and hence, the CO 2 emissions from this technology increase...|$|R
