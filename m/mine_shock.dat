About the usefulness of tanks decide the main battle features, which will include fire power, protection and mobility. The fire power is a feature that describes the quantity, quality and efficiency {{in terms of the}} main weapons system. Mobility of tanks reflects the dynamics of motion and manoeuvrability. On the mobility a large impact has: engine, transmission and tracked drive system. Protections (armour, together with additional systems) decide on the resistance to the enemy fire and the survival ability of the vehicle, crew and internal equipment. This paper presents the impact loads on a load-bearing structures of combat vehicle. Load is generated by the anti-tank <b>mine</b> <b>shock</b> wave. Models of objects were worked out using a method of the finite element, assuming the linear characteristics of elements.

The representative time histories of accelerations registered in three directions were used as ground motion data in calculations of the dynamic response of the structure. Two variants of a numerical model were applied: the model including only structural elements {{of the building and}} the model including both structural and non-structural elements (i. e. partition walls and ventilation ducts made of brick). It turned out that non-structural elements of multi-storey RC buildings have a small impact of about 10 % on natural frequencies of these structures.

40|$|Abstract—In {{the paper}} a {{detailed}} analysis of the dynamic response of a cooling tower shell to mining tremors originated from two main regions of mining activity in Poland (Upper Silesian Coal Basin and Legnica-Glogow Copper District) was presented. The representative time histories registered in the both regions were used as ground motion data in calculations of the dynamic response of the structure. It was proved that the dynamic response of the shell is strongly dependent not only on the level of vibration amplitudes but on the dominant frequency range of the <b>mining</b> <b>shock</b> typical for the mining region as well. Also a vertical component of vibrations occurred to have considerable influence on the total dynamic response of the shell.

The paper {{indicates}} {{the role of}} 3 D modeling of concrete gravity dams in evaluation of dynamic response of dams to mining tremors which occur in mining activity regions. 2 D and 3 D models of a concrete gravity dam were prepared in order to compare two- and three-dimensional analysis of the dynamic response of dam to <b>mining</b> <b>shock.</b> Firstly, values of natural frequencies obtained for 2 D and 3 D models occurred to be very similar, but only the 3 D model allowed to predict the dam behaviour under longitudinal kinematic excitation. Secondly, the comparison of the maximal principal stresses obtained for 2 D and 3 D models indicates that the simplified 2 D analysis underestimates the values of dynamic response on about 20 %.

Analysis of cyclical similarity is frequently carried out at the overall industry level, then interpreted with reference to regional industrial structures. By contrast, this paper explicitly incorporates regional industry structure into an examination of Australasian cycles. Since 1991, NZ and Australasian cycles have been highly correlated, {{but there is little}} evidence that the NZ cycle has been "caused" by Australian regional or industry cycles. We test whether the NZDAUD exchange rate has insulated NZ from Australian shocks, but find it has not played a major buffering role in response to Australian industry <b>shocks</b> (including <b>mining</b> <b>shocks).</b> Instead, the strongest impacts on the NZDAUD stem from the NZ cycle. An important loss of monetary sovereignty under currency union may therefore arise in response to NZ-specific shocks. ...|$|R

40|$|As {{a result}} of Zambia's {{dependence}} on copper mining, both the falling world copper price and the possible withdrawal of investment from the mining sector might seriously threaten economic growth and stability. Accordingly, {{the impact of a}} 20 percent reduction in world copper prices and a complete collapse of the copper mining sector are modeled using a 1995 computable general equilibrium model for Zambia. Results indicate that the fall in world copper prices will place significant pressure on non-mining exports, with much of the burden of raising foreign exchange falling on the food, beverages and tobacco, and textiles and garment sectors. However, the agricultural and agro-related industries are the most export-responsive (albeit from initially low levels) to the forced depreciation of the currency. The complete collapse of copper mining in Zambia is shown to have a substantial and negative impact on the economy. The fall in production and exports for this important sector leads to a considerable depreciation of the currency in order to fill the resulting gap in foreign earnings. In the short-run, real GDP is reduced by as much as 16 percent. Although the largest increase in exports arises within the food, beverages and tobacco sector, the agricultural and agro-related sectors show considerable potential as sources of foreign exchange earnings. It is found that both the fall in world prices and the reduction in mining output lead to a fall in total real household consumption. However, given that rural households derive a relatively high share of their income from tradable sectors that benefit from the depreciation, the shocks lead to a progressive redistribution of household incomes and consumption. The impact of providing an injection of foreign exchange into the country is found to involve a trade-off between alleviating the negative welfare effects of the copper <b>mining</b> <b>shocks</b> and the provision of incentives for structural adjustment. Furthermore, targeted capital investment in highly export-responsive sectors reduces the necessary depreciation of the real exchange rate, and the need for structural adjustment {{in other areas of the}} economy.

These vehicles {{are subjected to}} lethal attacks from projectiles and land <b>mines.</b> The <b>shocks</b> from these attacks may risk {{the safety of the}} occupants and damage the electronic instruments within the vehicle. Extensive research on the analysis and reduction of shocks on civilian vehicles has been performed. Fewer researchers addressed these problems in the case of military vehicles. Space frames are usually used to enhance structural strength of the vehicle while reducing its overall weight. These frames comprise of beams connected together at joints. Recently, space frames were incorporated in military vehicles. In this dissertation, a finite element model of a military vehicle with an internal space frame is developed. The space frame is composed of hollow square cross-section bars and angle sections. These frame members are bolted to the joints. The space frame is enclosed by uniform-thickness armor, except at the turret. The vehicle is subjected to high impact load that simulates a projectile hit. The vehicle design is optimized to reduce the overall mass, and shock at critical locations of the space frame.

40|$|This paper investigates China's {{capability}} to exert power on Rare Earth markets until 2020. A dynamic partial equilibrium model {{allowing for a}} disaggregated representation of the mining sector and endogenous investment in capacities is developed. The model is calibrated on a novel dataset on Rare Earth mines. Simulations show that Chinese market power is a transitory phenomenon. In 2014 and 2015, Light Rare Earth prices increase by 21 per cent and Heavy Rare Earth prices more than double compared to free trade, if assuming export restrictions to remain unchanged. Market power on Light Rare Earths vanishes almost completely by 2017 due to the entry of new suppliers, while it persists until 2019 for Heavy Rare Earths. Export restrictions imply a loss of Marshallian welfare of US 1. 96 billion outside China. In the short run, even moderate cuts in export quotas can increase exerted market power substantially. Altering tariffs induces smaller but more persistent effects. Sensitivity checks indicate that the results are robust, but delayed opening of new <b>mines</b> and demand <b>shocks</b> can be important for China's {{capability to}} exert market power. ...|$|R

She kindled a domestic fire within my heart and took up her dwelling there, even in that chill and lonesome cavern hung round with glittering icicles of fancy.

I taught her to love the moonlight hour, when the expanse of the encircled bay was smooth as a great mirror and slept in a transparent shadow, while beyond Nahant the wind rippled the dim ocean into a dreamy brightness which grew faint afar off without becoming gloomier.

40|$|Currently, {{the world}} {{economic}} activity is increasingly linked and dependent on each other. Almost all states interact {{with the outside world}} (Husnan 2001). It {{can be seen from the}} incident of monetary crisis that hit Asia in 1997. The post-crisis had created many agreements and efforts that led to the establishment of the institution on multilateral cooperation in the field of economy which was expected to improve understanding on the impact of regional economic integration formed through the combination of East Asia Summit (ASEAN, the People's Republic of China, Japan, Republic of Korea, Australia, India, and New Zealand) or better known as ASEAN+ 6. The effect of Indonesia economic relations with other countries renders Indonesia capital market integrated. Consequently, the effect can be positive or negative. The correlation of long term composite stock price index in the capital market among countries is used to determine the level and the development of capital market integration. Composite Stock Price Index (IHSG) is an important variable in the financial sector whose fluctuation is worth to note from time to time. This index includes the movement of the composite index of all shares listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange (BEI). Sectoral Indonesia Stock Exchange (BEI) index is a sub index of the Composite Stock Price Index (IHSG), in which the volatile movement of the sectoral stock price index determines the movement of Composite Stock Price Index (IHSG). This research aims to analyze the relation between long-term integration and the impact of ASEAN+ 6 stock market shock on Indonesia Composite Stock Price Index (IHSG) and to identify the industrial sector that has the most influence on the movement of the Indonesia Composite Stock Price Index (IHSG) as well as the effect of industrial shock, and to provide input regarding managerial implication that can be taken by the investors. The scope of this study includes the ASEAN+ 6 countries, namely Indonesia (JKSE), Malaysia (KLSE), Singapore (STI), Thailand (SET), Philippines (PSEi), Australia (AORD), the People's Republic of China (SSE), Japan (Nikkei 225), Republic of Korea (Kospi), India (BSESN), and New Zealand (NZX 50). Sectoral stock price indices used include agriculture (JKAGRI), mining (JKMING), chemical and basic industries (JKBIND), various industries (JKMISC), consumer goods (JKCONS), property and real estate (JKPROP), transportation and infrastructure (JKINFA), finance (JKFINA), trade, services, investment (JKTRADE) and manufacturing (JKMNFG). The method used in this study is VAR / VECM. The result shows that stock price index Philippines, Republic of Korea and India positively related to Composite Stock Price Index (IHSG) Indonesia, while Singapore, New Zealand, and Republic of China negatively related to the Composite Stock Price Index (IHSG) Indonesia. Malaysia stock price index, Japan, Singapura and Australia has no influence on Composite Stock Price Index (IHSG). The shocks on stock price indices of Philippines, Republic of Korea, and India lead to the rise of JKSE in the long term, while the shocks on stock price indices of SET, NZXX 50 and SSE impact to the decline of JKSE in the long term, while the shocks on stock price indices of Thailand, New Zealand, and Republic of China impact to the decline of Composite Stock Price Index (IHSG) in the long term. The most affecting Industrial sectors to the movement of the Indonesia Composite Stock Price Index (IHSG) are the transportation and infrastructure, financial, basic industries and chemical, manufacturing sector, the sector of various industries, consumer goods industry and the <b>mining</b> sector. The <b>shocks</b> on basic and chemical industries as well as various industries lead to the increase of Indonesia Composite Stock Price Index (IHSG) in the long term, while the shocks on financial sector, manufacturing, consumer goods industry, transportation, infrastructure, and the mining sector impact to decline of Indonesia Composite Stock Price Index (IHSG) in the long term. It is suggested for the investors who invest in the Stock Exchange (BEI) to observe the movement of the stock price index of Philippines (PSEit), the stock price index of Republic of Korea (Kospi) and stock price indices of India (BSESN) as references or considerations for investment decisions because the research results suggest that the composite stock price index of those countries positively correlate with IHSG. The industrial sectors which can be served as stock investment alternatives are manufacturing, transportation, infrastructure, and mining industries because these sectors have positive influences on the movement of the Indonesia Composite Stock Price Index (IHSG). This indicates that at the time the Composite Stock Price Index (IHSG) rises, investors can sell the shares of manufacturing, transportation, infrastructure and mining sectors. In the other hand, during the Composite Stock Price Index (IHSG) rises, financial sector, basic industry and chemicals, various industries and consumer goods industries can serve as alternatives for stock purchase as the result of this research suggests those sectoral price indices negatively correlate with Composite Stock Price Index (IHSG). 	Investors from Indonesia may invest in Malaysia, Japan, Singapore and Australia as the results using VECM test display zero influence on Stock Price Index (IHSG) Indonesia which indicates that the degree of those countries stock index integration with the Indonesia Composite Stock Price Index (IHSG) is low. A low degree of integration provides potential an opportunity benefit of international portfolio diversification. Market players must also consider the implications of the stock market integration which will affect the prospects of investment especially the domestic. The Indonesian government can take some steps to further develop the industrial sector such as manufacturing, transportation, infrastructure and mining because these sectors have positive influences on the movement of the Composite Stock Price Index (IHSG) as well as to pay attention to the stock price shocks on the financial, manufacturing, consumer goods industry, transportation, infrastructure, and mining sectors as they impact to decline of Indonesia Composite Stock Price Index (IHSG) in the long term...|$|R
