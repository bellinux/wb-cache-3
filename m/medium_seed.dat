40|$|Studies on the {{importance}} of seed arrival for community richness and composition have not considered the number of seeds arriving and its effect on species richness and composition of natural communities is thus unknown. A series of experimental dry grassland communities were established.

The results showed that seed density had an effect on species richness only {{at the beginning of the}} experiment. In contrast, the effects on species composition persisted across the entire study period. The results do not support the prediction that due to higher competition for light in nutrient-rich soil, species richness will be the highest in the treatment with the lowest seed density. However, the prevalence of small plants in the lowest seed density supported the expectation that low seed density guarantees low competition under high soil nutrients.

Two {{greenhouse}} experiments (one in summer and one in winter) and one field experiment were conducted to investigate the effects of drought pre-conditioning on seed yield, size, quality, accumulation of dehydrin-like proteins and soluble sugars in relation to seed quality, and seed mineral nutrients. In summer, soybean (Glycine max L.) plants were exposed at beginning seed fill (R 5) to well-watered (WW), sudden stress (SS) (without drought pre-conditioning), and three drought pre-conditioning treatments: one-day stress (ODS), two periods of one-day stress (TDS), and gradual stress (GS) imposed prior to severe drought stress. Three treatments were imposed in winter (WW, SS, and GS). In the field experiment, irrigated and non-irrigated conditions were imposed at R 5. Yield and yield components declined in drought-stressed plants regardless of the drought patterns compared with WW plants. In the greenhouse experiments, drought stress increased production of small and <b>medium</b> sized <b>seeds,</b> which also had lower germination. Large seeds from well-watered and gradual-stressed plants had better seed vigor (AA-germination) than seeds from suddenly stressed plants, indicating gradual stress was less harmful to seed vigor than sudden stress. In winter, all drought stress treatments induced dehydrin-like proteins at mid-seed development and reduced the level of soluble sugars in the mature seeds. The reduction in soluble sugars in seeds from drought stressed plants coincided with the reduction in AA-germination. In winter and field experiments, drought stress treatments increased the concentration of P, K, Ca, Mo, Mn, and Cu in seed similar in size and weight to seeds from well-watered plants; but, the concentrations varied between the two experiments. Drought-stress treatments reduced seed size in the winter experiment, but not in field experiment. <b>Medium</b> <b>seeds</b> had lower nutrient content than large seeds. In conclusion, all drought stress treatments reduced yield, yield components, increased production of small and <b>medium</b> <b>seeds,</b> and induced expression of dehydrins at mid-seed development.

In the startup period, high pH values up to 10 was observed due to alkaline nature of TEA and inadequate formation of biofilm and low overall biodegradation. Steady increase of organic-N concentration along with gradual upward trend of pressure drop indicated sound establishment of microbial population. Operational parameters studied included loading rate (6 - 116 g m- 3 h- 1), hydraulic detention times (40 - 60 s), temperature (30 ± 1 °C), and humidity (50 - 55 %). Results indicated effluent ammonia concentrations meeting standards of 25 ppm can be obtained after 2. 5 months of operation. Optimal organic loading rates (OLRs) of 90 ± 14 g m- 3 h- 1 for Hydraulic Retention Time (HRT) value of 48 s was suggested. Under these conditions, elimination capacity of 71 ± 3 g m- 3 h- 1 and removal efficiency 81 ± 14 % were achieved. Mass balance was performed on different forms of nitrogen products for a constant inlet concentration of 180 ppm TEA with a relatively stable removal efficiency of about 90 % maintained for over a month. Both liquid (leachate) and gas (different sections, inlet, and outlet) phase measurements were made for the purpose of performing calculations. Ammonium-N and Nitrate-N were dominant in the first and third sections of the reactor, respectively. Cumulative TEA-N mass balance over a 2 -month period indicated an equal proportion breakdown into ammonia-N, nitrate-N, and ammonium & organic-N. The fact that up to 30 % of TEA-N could not be accounted for in the leachate and gas measurements can be attributed to incorporation into the cellular constituents...|$|E

The initiation time of germination ranged between 9 to 12 d after sowing.   Gliricidia maculata seed has the shortest period to germinate (12 - 16 d after sowing), meanwhile Leucaena leucocephala cv. Tarramba appear to be the longest (9 - 17 d after sowing). The highest seed viability was 60 % in Leucaena leucocephala, cv Gump while the lowest was found in Gliricidia maculata (29 %). In addition, both Leucaena pallida and Leucaena leucocephala cv Tarramba had <b>medium</b> <b>seed</b> germination (40 % and 53 % respectively).

40|$|To satisfy {{farmer and}} {{consumer}} preferences, breeding {{efforts to increase}} yield potential in common bean {{must take into account}} the interrelated effects of growth habit, seed size, maturity, and gene pool on yield expression in segregating populations. To examine the relationships among these traits, a genetic study was conducted to determine the effect of growth habit on yield and seed size in crosses among five bean lines from diverse gene pools. Two parental bean lines had determinate, type I growth habits and large seed size typical of the Neuva Granada-Andean gene pool. Two other lines were tropical Mesoamerican types with type II growth habits and small seed size; and the fifth line, G 13625, a landrace of the Jalisco gene pool from the Mexican highlands, had a type IV climbing growth habit and <b>medium</b> <b>seed</b> size. Individual F 2 plants from each cross and parental lines were evaluated for growth habit and yield component traits under high input field conditions. The following season, the evaluations were repeated on random F 3 plants. Of the five parental lines, only G 13625 showed significant GCA effects for yield in both the F 2 and F 3 generations. Improved yielding ability of G 13625 progeny was associated with an increased expression of climbing bean growth habit traits: guide length, climbing ability, node number on main stem, and plant height. Crosses between Andean x Mesoamerican and Andean x Jalisco genotypes, as well between growth habit type I (Andean x Andean) and between type II (Mesoamerican x Mesoamerican) had very low parent-offspring heritability values for yield. Yield heritability was only significant for crosses between Mesomerican x Jalisco gene pools. An apparent simple genetic control of growth habit modification towards semi-climbing and climbing types is proposed as the major reason for increased yields in these crosses. No genetic linkage between genes controlling growth habit and seed size was detected which might restrict the development of high yielding large-seeded type II lines. Peer-reviewe...|$|E
30|$|Three {{inoculation}} {{methods were}} performed in this study, including liquid <b>seed</b> <b>medium</b> inoculation, spore suspension inoculation and mycelium inoculation via solid-state fermentation. Liquid <b>seed</b> <b>medium</b> inoculation was performed using conventional liquid <b>seed</b> <b>medium</b> preparation procedure. A seed culture was initiated by adding l mL of the thawed cell suspension to a 250 -mL Erlenmeyer flask containing 100  mL of <b>seed</b> <b>medium</b> (4  g/L dextrose, 4  g/L yeast extract, 10  g/L malt extract) {{at the initial}} pH 7.3 for 48  h (Yen and Hsiao 2013). A defined inoculation ratio of 2, 5 and 10  % (v/v) of <b>seed</b> <b>medium</b> was then inoculated into a 15 -L agitation fermentor. The spore suspension was prepared in the petri-dishes containing the solid <b>seed</b> <b>medium,</b> as described above. After 20 – 25  days of cultivation, the black spores were observed {{on the surface of}} agar plate. Sterile water was used to collect the spores from the surface for the preparation of spore suspension. After the spore suspension was collected, it was inoculated into the 15 -L fermentor directly, without the <b>seed</b> <b>medium</b> stage. Two concentrations of spore suspension were examined in this study, 1 × 1010 /mL (denoted as the low SS batch) and 2 × 1010 /mL (denoted as the high SS batch). The batch with mycelium inoculation of cereals cultured by solid-state fermentation (SSF) was performed as following: a seed culture was initiated by adding l mL of the thawed cell suspension to a 250 -mL Erlenmeyer flask containing 100  mL of <b>seed</b> <b>medium</b> (4  g/L dextrose, 4  g/L yeast extract, 10  g/L malt extract) (Yen and Hsiao 2013) at the initial pH 7.3 for 48  h. A 1  mL aliquot of the seed culture was then transferred into a solid medium containing 10  g of cereal or bean and 10  mL of water, incubated at 28  °C for 10  days. Eight crops that often be investigated as substrates for solid fermentation, namely barley, buckwheat, brown rice, polished rice, red beans, soybean and green beans (mung bean) were examined in this study (Yang et al. 2013). After 10  days of cultivation, the white mycelium covered the cereals, and the whole 10 g of each crops along with the mycelium was liquefied with some sterile water using a homogenizer. The homogenized mycelium solution (with the cereals or beans) was then inoculated into the 15 -L fermentor.|$|R
