From 1841 to 1951, {{the working class}} population of Trafford {{and across the country}} was in decline, falling steadily from 43% to 18% (36% to 29% nationally). It has since increased slightly, up to 27% (26% nationwide). The rest of the {{population was}} made up of clerical workers and skilled <b>manual</b> <b>workers.</b> In the 2008/2009 financial year, the crime rates in Trafford for violence against a person and sexual offences were below the national averages. However, the rate of robberies and burglaries were above the national average.|$|E

By 1971 this gap had increased to 28.8per cent compared to 24per cent nationally, while the town's working class population had declined, from 30.3per cent in 1931 (36per cent in England and Wales) to 18.6per cent (26per cent nationwide).

50|$|The initial {{foundation}} for the knowledge economy was introduced in 1966 in the book The Effective Executive by Peter Drucker. In this book, Drucker described {{the difference between the}} <b>manual</b> <b>worker</b> (page 2) and the knowledge <b>worker.</b> The <b>manual</b> <b>worker,</b> according to him, works with his or her hands and produces goods or services. In contrast, a knowledge worker (page 3) works with his or her head, not hands, and produces ideas, knowledge, and information.|$|R

5|$|In 1931, 9.4% of Wigan's {{population}} was middle class compared with 14% in England and Wales, and by 1971, this had increased to 12.4% compared with 24% nationally. Parallel to this {{slight increase in}} the middle classes of Wigan was {{the decline of the}} working class population. In 1931, 38.7% were working class compared with 36% in England and Wales; by 1971, this had decreased to 33.5% in Wigan and 26% nationwide. The rest of the {{population was}} made up of clerical workers and skilled <b>manual</b> <b>workers</b> or other miscellaneous. The slow decrease in the working class goes against the trend for a steeper national decline, reinforcing the perception of Wigan as a working-class town.|$|E
5|$|Since {{the very}} beginning, Danes have argued about the precise place of {{photography}} in society. In 1839, Crown Prince Frederik deposited Falbe's daguerreotypes with Ørsted, {{the secretary of}} the Royal Danish Academy of Sciences and Letters, despite the fact that Daguerre, the inventor, was an artist. In 1842, the artist Johan Frederik Møller was refused a grant from the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts for studying photography in France {{on the grounds that it}} was not an art. Photographers came within neither the scope of the Academy of Sciences nor that of the Academy of Fine Arts but were regarded as <b>manual</b> <b>workers.</b>|$|E

Over the course of several months, a large-scale emergency excavation by over 60 paleontologists and 100 <b>manual</b> <b>workers</b> allowed thousands of specimens of plants, invertebrates, and vertebrates of late Campanian-early Maastrichtian age to be saved, including A. sp.|$|E
40|$|Purpose: Type of work {{might be}} related to insulin {{resistance}} and the metabolic syndrome (MetS). However, scant data are available. We performed this study to investigate whether the prevalence of MetS and insulin resistance differed according to occupation in middle-aged men. Materials and Methods: In all, 2, 348 men in their 40 s∼ 50 s who had participated in the Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey IV were included and were classified into two groups according to the type of work (<b>manual</b> <b>worker</b> vs. non-manual worker). Diagnosis of MetS required satisfying three or more of the National Cholesterol Education Program-Adult Treatment Panel III criteria. Fasting insulin, the glucose/insulin ratio (G/I ratio), and the homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) were used to estimate the insulin resistance. We used the Mann-Whitney test, χ 2 tests, multiple linear regression test, and logistic regression analyses to examine the relationships. Results: Age was significantly higher in the <b>manual</b> <b>worker</b> group. Body mass index was significantly lower in the <b>manual</b> <b>worker</b> group. Rates of current smoking and frequent drinking were higher in the <b>manual</b> <b>worker</b> group. In terms of surrogate marker...|$|R

5|$|Originally {{a working}} class town, {{there was an}} influx of middle class people in the mid-19th century when {{businessmen}} began using Sale as a commuter town. Since then, Sale has had {{a greater proportion of}} middle class residents than the national average. In 1931, 22.7% of Sale's population was middle class compared with 14% in England and Wales, and by 1971, this had increased to 36.3% compared with 24% nationally. Parallel to this increase in the middle classes of Sale was the decline of the working class population. In 1931, 20.3% were working class compared with 36% in England and Wales; by 1971, this had decreased to 15.4% in Sale and 26% nationwide. The rest of the population was made up of clerical workers and skilled <b>manual</b> <b>workers.</b> The change in social structure in the town was at a similar rate to that {{of the rest of the}} nation but was biased towards the middle classes, transforming Sale into the middle class town it is today.• Retrieved on 1 August 2008.• Retrieved on 1 August 2008.|$|E
5|$|From 1848, the {{national}} {{consciousness of the}} local people grew and from 1848 {{to the end of}} the 19th century local Poles and Czechs co-operated, uniting against the Germanizing tendencies of the Austrian Empire, and later of Austria-Hungary. Various Polish clubs were founded. Most schools were Polish, followed by German and Czech. At the end of the century, ethnic tensions appeared as the area's economic significance grew. This growth caused a wave of immigration from Galicia, when about 60,000 people arrived and settled between 1880 and 1910. They settled mainly in the Ostrau region, but also in Zaolzie. The new immigrants were Polish and poor, about half of them being illiterate, and worked mostly in coal mining and metallurgy. For these people, the most important factor was material well-being; they cared little about the homeland from which they had fled, more readily assimilating into the Czech population which was demographically dominant in the Ostrava region in the heart of Czech Silesia. The social structure of the territory was generally divided along ethnic lines. Germans were economically strongest, mostly owners, Czechs were mostly clerks and other officials, and Poles were mostly <b>manual</b> <b>workers,</b> miners, and metallurgists. This structure had changed over time but in 1921 it was still very similar, with 61.5% of Poles working as labourers.|$|E

30|$|The {{temporal}} perspective {{draws attention}} to the importance of sequence in a career. At the very least, the duration and order of career experiences {{must be taken into account}} when evaluating career success. If one were to examine the career track of two otherwise similar persons with identical building blocks in their careers, for example a)  vocational training, b)  first job as trained <b>manual</b> <b>worker,</b> c)  first-line supervisor and d)  middle manager, the duration of each of these career segments is crucial for evaluating each person's current career success. Sequence A with three years vocational training, two years as <b>manual</b> <b>worker,</b> two years as first-level supervisor and ten years as middle manager tells a different story from sequence  B with three years vocational training, five years <b>manual</b> <b>worker,</b> eight years of first-level supervisor and one year as middle manager. Sequence  A suggests normal vocational training, rapid promotion in the two subsequent hierarchical levels and current establishment in middle management. Sequence B, however, implies normal vocational training, a delay in getting promotion to higher levels, and finally just making it into middle management where it remains to be seen whether this will work out or not.|$|R
