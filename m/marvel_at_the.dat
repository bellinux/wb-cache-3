5|$|A team of {{researchers}} discover remains of a crashed spaceship in the Arctic Circle, finding several humanoids with cybernetic implants frozen in the wreckage. Two bodies are taken to a nearby compound to be studied. The scientists <b>marvel</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> nanoprobes that begin to repair the long dead aliens. Suddenly one of the seemingly dead subjects attacks the scientists, assimilating them. Using scavenged wreckage to enhance the transport, they then escape into space, upgrading it with a faster than standard warp drive and weapons.|$|E
5|$|The {{war effort}} had brought about {{significant}} diversification in the area's industrial base. This diversity facilitated the area's {{transition to a}} peacetime economy though the petroleum industry again became a major focus. In 1952 the Gulf Freeway, then part of U.S. Route 75, was completed providing a fast automobile link between Houston and Galveston. The new freeway, considered an engineering <b>marvel</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> time, greatly encouraged new development in the western region of the bay.|$|E

They are granted an audience with the Wiz (Richard Pryor), who lives {{at the very top of}} the Towers. He appears to them as a giant fire-breathing metallic head. He will only grant their wishes if they kill the sister of the Wicked Witch of the East, Evillene (Mabel King), the Wicked Witch of the West, who runs a sweatshop in the underground sewers of Oz. Before they can reach her domain, Evillene learns of their quest to kill her and sends out the Flying Monkeys (a motorcycle gang) to kidnap them.|$|E

5|$|In 1741, the Chamouny {{valley and}} its glaciers {{on the north}} side of the massif were {{discovered}} and written about by two aristocratic travelling Englishmen, named William Windham and Richard Pococke. The descriptions of their exploits were published across Europe, bringing the mountains of the Mont Blanc range to the attention of a wide audience for the first time. In 1760, Horace-Bénédict de Saussure offered a large financial prize to the first people who successfully ascended Mont Blanc. The summit was finally attained on 8 August 1786 by two Chamonix men, the guide Jacques Balmat and Dr. Michel Paccard. The decades that followed saw the gradual opening up of Chamonix to the world, as well as the rest of the Mont Blanc massif. The many published accounts of climbs and impressive sights amongst or around the mountain range attracted numerous wealthy and notable visitors, for whom a visit to <b>marvel</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Sea of Ice (the Mer de Glace) became a fashionable thing to experience.|$|E

25|$|A {{railway station}} was opened in 1903 {{a few hundred}} yards west of its current {{position}} and railway companies often ran excursions to the town, bringing people to <b>marvel</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> social experiment and sometimes to mock it: Letchworth's founding citizens, attracted by the promise of a better life, were often caricatured by outsiders as idealistic and otherworldly. John Betjeman in his poems Group Life: Letchworth and Huxley Hall painted Letchworth people as earnest health freaks.|$|E

25|$|The 1999 North American {{premiere of}} The Fountain of Bakhchisarai by the Kirov Ballet in New York was an {{outstanding}} success, for example.

When watching restored old footage, one can only <b>marvel</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> talent of their prima ballerinas such as Galina Ulanova, Natalya Dudinskaya and Maya Plisetskaya and choreographers such as Pyotr Gusev.|$|E

Remembering his unsatisfaction as a God, Doom decides that it was his role to help heal the world. Inspired by Stark, and informing his A.I. duplicate that he intends to establish Stark's legacy, Doom fights for his unique brand of justice as the third Iron Man, and later comes into conflict with Mephisto disguised The Maker, the evil Ultimate Universe version of Reed Richards. Doom goes on to join the Avengers, and later conceives a child with Dr. Amara Perera.|$|E
25|$|Father Walke was a High Churchman and {{the changes}} in {{services}} which he introduced were strange {{to the members of}} the congregation. Many came in the early days to <b>marvel</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> curious goings on in a communion service unlike the morning prayer to which they were accustomed. However this did not persist and many became hostile and stayed away while others remained faithful worshippers. The open air services he held late on Sundays on the Downs were however popular. W. H. Frere, Bishop of Truro, 1923–35, approved of many aspects of Walke's ministry but their views differed on reservation of the blessed sacrament: the bishop held that it was within his authority while Walke maintained it was inherent in that of a parish priest.|$|E

500|$|Veerapandiya Kattabomman {{received}} positive reviews upon release. Ananda Vikatan, in {{its original}} review dated 24 May 1959, praised the performance of Sivaji Ganesan, and said the film would make any Tamil proud. Baradwaj Rangan praised Ganesan's performance, stating that: [...] "To watch Veerapandiya Kattabomman is to <b>marvel</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> shades and nuances an actor can infuse into oratory." [...] Arun Ram and Riju Mehta of India Today stated in 2001, [...] "One doesn't have to be well-versed in Tamil to feel the fire in Veerapandiya Kattabomman." ...|$|E

500|$|A {{malfunctioning}} {{air compressor}} was repaired on 17 March. [...] The repair required the complete re-wiring of the compressor's armature, a task ordinarily done aboard a submarine tender or in a shipyard. Captain Beach was deeply impressed by [...] "this spirit and outlook [...] permeated our crew." [...] He was also [...] "astonished" [...] by two different makeshift fathometer sound transmitters {{created by the}} electronics and engineering crewmen. One {{was based on a}} general announcing speaker, while the other used a stainless steel cooking pot from the galley, with stainless steel rods and copper wiring. Beach noted in the ship's log: [...] "I could only <b>marvel</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> ingenuity of the American sailor." ...|$|E

500|$|Following his retirement, {{head coach}} of the US men's {{swimming}} team Bob Bowman—who also mentors Michael Phelps—called Thorpe [...] "the greatest middle-distance swimmer of all time and...the greatest relay swimmer I have seen". Bowman further cited Thorpe's ability to raise the profile and popularity of swimming, noting that Phelps' public image was modelled on that of the Australian. Australian Olympic Committee President John Coates stated that [...] "In 50 years from now Australians will still <b>marvel</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> feats of Ian Thorpe". Dawn Fraser, the first of only two swimmers to win the same Olympic event three times, said that Thorpe was the [...] "greatest [...] swimmer in the world", and lamented {{that he would not be}} attempting a hat-trick of 400m titles.|$|E
500|$|Elite Forces {{attention}} to immersing the player within the Star Trek universe was praised {{as one of}} the stronger points of the game; GamePro suggested that even people who were not fans of the franchise [...] "will <b>marvel</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> amount of detail in the ships and characters", further praising the game's [...] "faithful" [...] recreation of key sets of the USS Voyager in the TV series. Many reviewers were positive towards the game's story, GameSpy suggesting that the plot [...] "really draws you in", while IGN praised the story as one in stark contrast to many of the poorly produced storylines used in the TV series. However, many reviewers felt that the game's single-player campaign was too short, while others felt the game's closing levels were disappointing.|$|E
500|$|Reviews were {{initially}} mixed, but have since {{become much more}} positive. At first Rolling Stone called the songs [...] "swell, but... entirely mannered and derivative" [...] and noted that the arrangements [...] "aren't bad", although the musicians were commended. The review ended with the assertion that the [...] "principals have some growing to do." [...] Modern reviews are more positive, however. Allmusic declares [...] "this is Grand Guignol pop—epic, gothic, operatic, and silly, and it's appealing because of all of this." [...] They acknowledge that Steinman is [...] "a composer without peer, simply because nobody else wanted to make mini-epics like this." [...] Rundgren's production is applauded, as is the wit in the music and lyrics. [...] "It may elevate adolescent passion to operatic dimensions, and that's certainly silly, but it's hard not to <b>marvel</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> skill behind this grandly silly, irresistible album." ...|$|E

500|$|Hearing of its release, {{neighbors of}} Geisel's in Springfield were at first worried the book {{would be an}} exposé of the people there. [...] Sales were lackluster, but early reviews were glowing. [...] Clifton Fadiman wrote a one-sentence review in The New Yorker, which Geisel could still quote {{near the end of}} his life: [...] "They say it's for children, but better get a copy for {{yourself}} and <b>marvel</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> good Dr. Seuss' impossible pictures and the moral tale of the little boy who exaggerated not wisely but too well." [...] The New York Times wrote, [...] "Highly original and entertaining, Dr Seuss' picture book partakes of the better qualities of those peculiarly America institutions, the funny papers and the tall tale. It is a masterly interpretation of the mind of a child in the act of creating one of those stories with which children often amuse themselves and bolster up their self-respect." ...|$|E
500|$|Maulbetsch's {{style was}} {{described}} as [...] "line-plunging."

[...] Those who have seen Maulbetsch in action <b>marvel</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> great momentum he can get up {{in two or three}} steps." [...] Noted football writer Walter Eckersall said: [...] "Mauly is a little fellow, being built close to the ground. [...] They say that when he plunges at the line his head is almost on a level with his shoe tops – that he hits so low that it's well nigh impossible to stop him." [...] An Iowa newspaper wondered how it was possible [...] "for a man to smash into a line of human bodies with the force that Maulbetsch does and come out of the game without a broken neck." ...|$|E
