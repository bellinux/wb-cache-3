40|$|Background: The {{digitalization}} of {{the automotive}} industry demands automotive MNCs to expand their portfolio of software competencies. The improved global competition of talent has increased the importance of GTM, and the ability for HR practitioners to identify and select international and adequate software competencies. Purpose: The purpose of the thesis is to investigate how HR practitioners of automotive MNCs identify and select international software talents to maintain an adequate competence basis. Research: Question How does HR practitioners of automotive MNCs identify and select international software talent to maintain an adequate competence basis required to manage the digitalization of {{the automotive industry}}? Methodology: The research design of this thesis {{is based on a}} qualitative case study where the specific case represents an automotive MNC operating globally. In order to answer the research question and to fulfil the purpose of the thesis, the empirical data have been collected by semistructured interviews with relevant staff and managers employed at the Product & Quality unit by the MNC of study. An abductive research process was chosen due to its ability of collecting and reviewing theories and empirical data mutually alongside the undertaken research. Conclusion A well-reasoned strategy for identifying and selecting international software talents has revealed absent by the R&D departments of study. Besides, a <b>mutual</b> <b>undertaking</b> of GTM is lacking as part of these processes in order for the automotive MNC to maintain an adequate competence basis resulting from the ongoing digitalization of the automotive industry. Recommendations: The R&D departments of study need to seek an equal understanding and definition of GTM between recruiting managers and their supporting instances. HRBPs should further be provided increased authority in the talent identification and selection among international software candidates, thus extending their operational support to become more strategically. In addition, a more Agile mindset need to be fostered in order for recruiting managers to act more flexible and effective in their identification and selection of international software competencies.

40|$|From the introduction]. Although the European Union has not {{formally}} been assigned welfare policy competence, {{it has for}} decades regulated social benefits between the member states. The social rights and obligations of the European migrant have for long been safeguarded by the EU, and the <b>mutual</b> welfare responsibility <b>undertaken</b> by the member states of the Union constitutes an extraordinary piece of social Europe. The focus {{of this paper is}} the long run welfare integration which has taken place in the European Community and has been expanded in the European Union through the coordination scheme of Community Regulation 1408 / 711. The regulation has recently been substantially reformed with the adoption of Regulation 883 / 20042, but has furthermore in key parts unfolded through issue linkages to Union citizenship and internal market principles.

The Chamber also forced Daladier, whom Reynaud held personally responsible for France's weakness, to be Reynaud's Minister of National Defense and War. One of Reynaud's first acts was {{at a meeting of the}} Anglo-French Supreme War Council held in London on 28 March 1940, whose main outcome was the signing of a declaration with British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain that neither of the two countries would sign a separate peace.

40|$|In {{the process}} of — widely {{understood}} — using would market pirices {{for the needs of}} the CMEA, several stages can be distinguished. Effectiveness of the whole process is determined by realization of those stages. Following stages should be marked off: (1) approval — by the CMEA countries — of using world market prices in definite spheres of mutual co-operation; (2) choice of organizational forms of forecasting world market prices within the CMEA; (3) selection of methods and techniques of foreassting, adequate for a given commodity and for certain sphere of co-operation; (4) realization of the foreassting process and forecasts verification; (5) introduction of forecasts to <b>mutual</b> enterprises <b>undertaken</b> by the CMEA-countries in the sphere of production and trade. The author occupies himself with methodical aspects of forecasting world markest prices. There fundamental groups can be distinguished among method, of world market prices forecasting. Econometric methods consist in broad utilizetion of mathematical, statistical and econometric techniques in price models construction. A world price forecast can also be obtained owing to non-econometric methods. Those ones are based on knowledge of experts and its using for forecasting purposes. The usability, however, of the mixed method of forecasting. should be seen in analytic activities concerning world prices. The method in question should combine both non-econometric methods and technique and econometric ones. Utilization of a mixed methodical variant enables a more comprehensive reflection and analysis of factors influencing the prices as well as the most precise reflection of that influence. Furthermore, the influence of verification procedures on prices accepted within the CMEA is discussed as well as instruments of verifications of forecasts results are analyzed. The problem can be of some importance in case of forecasts utilization within the CMEA. In its final part the article contains considerations on problems of forecasts horizon and data modernization. It is analyzed in connection with the problem of reliability of forecasts results used within the grouping.

The memorandum to the Amendment Bill cites Gory v Kolver as authority, but {{it has been suggested that}} the situation which prevailed at the time that this case was heard no longer exists, due to the advent of the Civil Union Act. The decision in Gory v Kolver case was predicated on the fact that the parties were not able to formalise their relationship in any way. On the evidence, the parties had <b>undertaken</b> <b>mutual</b> duties of support. Had it been possible for them to do so, they would almost certainly have formaised their relationship. Were the parties in that situation presently, they would have the option of formalising their relationship under the Civil Union Act. The survivor would be considered a [...] "spouse" [...] for the purposes of the Intestate Succession Act. The net effect of the proposed amendment, it has been argued, is that it elevates same-sex partnerships to a level superior to that of heterosexual life partnerships.|$|R

[...] The British were firmly opposed to French plans to bomb Russian oil fields in the Caucasus in order to deprive Germany of Soviet oil supplies. The French agreed to what later became known as Operation Royal Marine, the floating of mines up the Rhine to damage bridges and disrupt barge traffic. However, Reynaud was unable to obtain the approval of his cabinet for such a mining of the Rhine; accordingly, the British refused {{to go along with the}} plan to mine the waters off the Norwegian coast at Narvik.

There are two objectives of this research: (i) to examine the commitment level of volunteer residents participation in neighborhood watch organization and (ii) to identify attitudinal and motivational factors that influence their level of commitment. Approach: The study was carried out on a neighborhood watch organization called Rukun Tetangga (RT) Taman Sri Jelok, a suburban neighborhood in Kajang, located in the central part of Peninsular Malaysia. Data is collected via questionnaire administered through a census survey of 200 volunteer residents from the neighborhood watch organization. Data is analyzed using descriptive statistics and correlation techniques. Results: The research reveals high commitment level shown by volunteer residents in carrying out community activities, especially in <b>undertaking</b> <b>mutual</b> cooperation activities such as gotong royong. The attitudinal and motivational factors were found to contribute greatly towards the volunteers commitment in RT activities. Political interest does not influence volunteers commitment. Conclusion/Recommendation: The members commitment in RT activities increases when they perceive that the instrumental values of RT are positive, find the activities in RT attractive, adopt a positive attitude towards RT activities and poses internal altruistic motivation. Research indicates {{there is a need to}} create neighborhood watch activities that are beneficial and attractive to ensure commitment from volunteers. Future studies can examine other organizational aspects of neighborhood watch such as administration, management, infrastructure and linkages with other related organization...|$|R
40|$|The article {{deals with}} the problem of the played by {{university}} extra-mural courses in social mobility processes. A starting point for the completed researches was a recognition that extra -mural courses represent an institutional channel of social mobility, which enables inidividuals coming from different social classes and strata to move up to higher socio-professional positions in the hierarchy. In the first stage the research project encompassed 760 persons, which over they ears 1960 / 1961 — 1969 / 1970 were attending extra -mural courses in the Faculty of Polish Philology, University of Łódź. On the basis of the documentation available at the University there was prepared a general socio-demographic descrption of this aggregation. The second stage of the research project consisted of questionnaire surveys, which comprised 252 persons. The research findings point at extra -mural courses as an important channel of social mobility. The inter-generation promotion encompassed 80 per cent of the population sample under survey. Improvement in the educational level in the course of professional engagement was also stimulating socio-professional mobility processes. From among the examined graduates ca. 65 percent were promoted on completing their academic courses. This promotion concerned professions, posts, and place of work. Completion of academic courses was also a ccompanied by expansion of social contacts and establishment of new social ties. There was also observed a fact of considerable educational mobility of marriage partners of the examined persons and connected with it — <b>mutual</b> motivating for <b>undertaking</b> extra -mural courses.

40|$|Following privatisations in the 1980 's, the UK {{financial}} industry {{embarked on a}} series of demutualisations, which developed into a global trend in the late 1990 's. This structural shift has generated numerous debates in academic circles concerning various managerial issues of mutual versus stock owned companies. Informed by agency theory, this thesis contributes to this debate by exploring the link between ultimate organisational form and the behaviour of companies in the UK unit trust industry. The UK unit trust fund industry provides an excellent environment to explore this line of research because ultimate organisational form varies, and because the intra-industry variations are far smaller than those of other industries in term of regulations, income structure, and the use of information technology. For the purpose of analysis, the thesis compares unit trust management companies belonging to mutual and stock owned groups along three dimensions: (i) risk-taking and (ii) efficiency at the corporate level, and (iii) quality of their products, e. g. risk and fee adjusted performance of unit trusts that the companies offer. To this end, a number of quantitative analyses are undertaken, including Tobit regression and Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA), using data from a sample of 130 unit trust management companies for the financial year 1999 - 2000. The results support the agency theory hypothesis, revealing that at the corporate level, stock owned companies show higher managerial efficiency than the <b>mutual</b> counterparts whilst <b>undertaking</b> higher risk activities than the comparable mutual companies. Nonetheless, at the product level, no difference is found by ultimate ownership type with regard to risk-fee-adjusted performance of unit trusts. The latter indicates that competitive product markets remove the performance distinctions between mutuals and proprietary companies. Overall, these findings suggest that mutual organisations exhibit weaker cost control in conducting unit trust business via their affiliated companies.

40|$|This thesis {{looks at}} ways to improve either the {{reliability}} or {{the rate at which}} we can successfully transmit information over Rayleigh-fading wireless communication channels. We study four wireless schemes, the first in the low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime, the remaining three at high SNR. The analysis provides insights that apply to more general SNRs. Firstly we investigate a point-to-point multiple antenna link at low SNR. At low SNR channel estimates can be unreliable, and therefore we assume the channel is unknown to both transmitter and receiver. Adopting a block-fading model we find the mutual information between transmitter and receiver up to second order in the SNR. The expression is valid for input distributions with regular behavior of fourth- and sixth-order moments, in particular most practical schemes. Subject to input-signal constraints, we determine the optimal signaling to maximize this <b>mutual</b> information. We <b>undertake</b> high SNR analysis by finding the diversity-multiplexing gain trade-off of three further wireless systems with fading. Using techniques from existing works we find the optimal diversity-multiplexing gain trade-off for an M by N multiple antenna system with R single antenna relays. This uses a two-stage protocol in which the source first transmits to relays, then the relays multiply their received signal by a unitary matrix, before forwarding the result to the receiver. The trade-off is found to be equal to that of a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) link with R transmit and min{M,N} receive antennas. Next we consider a network with two source-destination pairs (an interference channel) and establish relationships between the rate and diversity achievable by certain schemes. We show through two more schemes how cooperation amongst the nodes achieves a higher diversity, but with a reduced rate of the system. These schemes can easily be generalized from two to m source-destination pairs. A final scheme is considered where n relay nodes are added to the m source-destination pairs, which act to cancel interference in an aim to increase diversity. The outage behavior of this scheme is analyzed and it is shown that for sufficiently many relay nodes, a diversity linear in n can be obtained...|$|R
