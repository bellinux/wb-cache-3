5|$|Dox wrote prolifically {{over the}} course of his career, {{yielding}} nine poem anthologies, numerous books in prose, and sixteen plays along Biblical themes or <b>Malagasy</b> history and folk tales. In addition, he wrote a number of plays on commission for various clients, with many commissioned by Boy Scout troupes, although these have since been lost. His translation from French to <b>Malagasy</b> of three major Western novels was significant because they enriched <b>Malagasy</b> literature by introducing elements of the novel form that had never before been attempted in <b>Malagasy</b> language. These efforts demonstrated to other <b>Malagasy</b> language writers the versatility of the language and the possibility that it could be used for any literary form.|$|E
5|$|Following the French colonization, the {{language}} of instruction and media changed from <b>Malagasy</b> to almost exclusively French. Moreover, the first French governor-general, Gallieni, also encouraged the French officials to learn <b>Malagasy</b> as well. After {{the advent of the}} <b>Malagasy</b> independence, the Madagascans tried to reinstate <b>Malagasy</b> as a language of instruction especially in secondary schools. However, {{the language}} policy was inadequately planned and <b>Malagasy</b> was struggling to surpass French as {{the language of}} instruction.|$|E
5|$|He was {{included}} in the seminal volume of poetry of the Négritude movement, Léopold Senghor's Anthologie de la nouvelle poesie negre et malgache ("Anthology of New Black and <b>Malagasy</b> Poetry"), published in 1948. He has inspired many <b>Malagasy</b> writers and poets after him, including Elie Rajaonarison, an exemplar of the new wave of <b>Malagasy</b> poetry.|$|E
5|$|Three {{species of}} <b>Malagasy</b> {{hippopotamus}} became extinct during the Holocene on Madagascar, {{one of them}} within the past 1,000 years. The <b>Malagasy</b> hippos were smaller than the modern hippopotamus, likely {{through the process of}} insular dwarfism. Fossil evidence indicates many <b>Malagasy</b> hippos were hunted by humans, a likely factor in their eventual extinction. Isolated members of <b>Malagasy</b> hippopotamus may have survived in remote pockets; in 1976, villagers described a living animal called the kilopilopitsofy, which may have been a <b>Malagasy</b> hippopotamus.|$|E

5|$|Consequently, {{under the}} socialist Second Republic, French {{instructors}} and other nationals were expelled, <b>Malagasy</b> was declared {{the language of}} instruction and a large cadre of young <b>Malagasy</b> were rapidly trained to teach at remote rural schools under the mandatory two-year national service policy.|$|E
5|$|Dox {{was named}} President of the Komitin'ny Artista <b>Malagasy</b> Mitambatra (K.A.MA.MI., Committee of United <b>Malagasy</b> Artists) and Vice President of the Andrianampoinimerina Academy, then became {{member of the}} Académie Malgache on 28 August 1975.|$|E
5|$|Like {{the modern}} pygmy hippopotamus, the <b>Malagasy</b> pygmy hippo has {{eyes on the}} side of its head rather than high orbits and teeth {{similar to those of the}} pygmy hippopotamus. The <b>Malagasy</b> pygmy hippo is {{similarly}} less aquatic, with many of its fossils found in the forested highlands of Madagascar.|$|E
5|$|On {{the third}} day the crew trapped in the gunroom created a small {{explosion}} just outside it, using gunpowder, in which Gulik was injured again. Their hope was to frighten the <b>Malagasy</b> into submission, and a female <b>Malagasy</b> who had been held in the gunroom was instructed to tell the other <b>Malagasy</b> that, {{if they did not}} surrender, the crew would blow up the ship. The <b>Malagasy</b> responded by saying that they had seen the fearful effect that the explosion also had on the crew, and refused to surrender, again demanding that they be returned to Madagascar. Olof Leij agreed, but Captain Muller ordered the crew to sail the ship towards Cape Agulhas, the southernmost point of Africa. Muller's assessment was that the <b>Malagasy</b> had little skill in seafaring and navigation and therefore would be unlikely to notice the deception, which proved to be the case. After three or four days' sailing they sighted land, the VOC settlement of Struisbaai.|$|E
5|$|Several {{species of}} <b>Malagasy</b> {{hippopotamus}} (also known as <b>Malagasy</b> dwarf hippopotamus or <b>Malagasy</b> pygmy hippopotamus or Madagascan instead of <b>Malagasy)</b> {{lived on the}} island of Madagascar but are now believed to be extinct. The animals were very similar to the extant hippopotamus and pygmy hippopotamus. The fossil record suggests that at least one species of hippopotamus lived until about 1,000 years ago, and other evidence suggests that the species may have survived until much more recently. The taxonomy of these animals is not resolved and not widely studied. The various species are believed to have survived into the Holocene era.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Malagasy</b> on the ship, {{seeing the}} signal fires, cut the anchor cable, {{allowing}} Meermin to drift shorewards, where she grounded on a sandbank. Crew member Rijk Meyer, who had earlier been thrown overboard and swum around {{the ship to}} the safety of the gunroom, now swam from the ship to the shore and was brought to Le Sueur. He informed Le Sueur that the <b>Malagasy</b> on the ship had told him to find out whether the earlier landing party was there, but that he had secretly arranged with the other crew members that, if help was available on shore, he would signal back to the ship by waving a handkerchief above his head. Six <b>Malagasy</b> and another crew member also left Meermin in a canoe, but a unit of the militia immediately surrounded the party when they landed. One <b>Malagasy</b> was shot dead and three others taken prisoner; the dead <b>Malagasy</b> was later identified by one of the ship's crew as the mutiny's overall ringleader, but his name was not recorded. Of the remaining two, one swam away and the other was believed either to have swum back to the ship or drowned in the attempt. Enraged by the crew's deception, the <b>Malagasy</b> still on Meermin launched an attack on the crew which lasted for three hours, but the crew were able to defend themselves.|$|E
5|$|The {{eruption}} {{of the conflict}} provided the pretext for violence between highland Merina and coastal <b>Malagasy</b> of other ethnic groups. An estimated 1,900 to 5,000 <b>Malagasy</b> PADESM supporters were killed by their pro-MDRM nationalist countrymen during the conflict.|$|E
5|$|The queen's foreign contemporaries {{strongly}} condemned her {{policies and}} viewed {{them as the}} actions of a tyrant or even a madwoman, a characterization that persisted in Western historical literature until the 1970s. Although Ranavalona has traditionally been depicted as a cruel and xenophobic tyrant, in more recent historical analyses she is commonly viewed as an astute politician who effectively protected the political and cultural sovereignty of her nation from European encroachment. In Madagascar today, the <b>Malagasy</b> of the central highlands hold complex and diverse views ranging across this spectrum. Most condemn her reign, in line with negative depictions of Ranavalona in current <b>Malagasy</b> history textbooks; this view is most common among <b>Malagasy</b> Christians. Others admire her effort to preserve <b>Malagasy</b> traditions and independence. The majority, regardless of their feelings toward her domestic policies, consider her a remarkable figure in <b>Malagasy</b> history and commend her strength as a ruler in a period of tension with European powers.|$|E
5|$|Today, Madagascar has two {{official}} languages: <b>Malagasy</b> and French. Madagascar {{managed to}} maintain the indigenous language, <b>Malagasy,</b> in society and in schools despite the colonizing power. <b>Malagasy</b> and French are both the language of instruction in primary and secondary schools in Madagascar. The inclusion of the African {{language as a medium}} of instruction is usually uncommon in other colonized African countries.|$|E
5|$|Although no fossil {{evidence}} has been dated within the last 1,000 years, the hippopotamus has been surprisingly common in the oral legends of the <b>Malagasy.</b> In 1648, Étienne de Flacourt became the French governor of Madagascar and {{he wrote in his}} Histoire de la grande isle de Madagascar about hearing stories from the <b>Malagasy</b> about an animal called the mangarsahoc which closely resembled the hippopotamus. In different regions of Madagascar, stories were recorded of the tsy-aomby-aomby, the omby-rano, and the laloumena, all animals that resembled hippopotami, but few other animals on the island. In 1902, a colonial administrator named Raybaud asserted that stories he heard in the highlands could only be about <b>Malagasy</b> hippos still living as late as 1878. The strength of these oral traditions led the IUCN to classify the <b>Malagasy</b> hippopotami as recent extinctions.|$|E
5|$|At {{its height}} {{during the period}} of Ravalomanana's presidency, Tiko {{provided}} direct salaried employment to between 1,000 and 3,000 staff and indirect employment to over 10,000. The group was the largest dairy producer in the country and a leader in the national agribusiness sector. The success of his enterprises made Ravalomanana a wealthy man. In the mandatory self-disclosure of wealth submitted to the High Constitutional Court in 2000 by all presidential candidates, Ravalomanana declared ownership of 27 properties valued at over two billion <b>Malagasy</b> francs. He owned 90 per cent of Tiko Inc., 80 per cent of Tiko Agri and 50 per cent of Tiko Oil Products, a portfolio worth 13.1 billion <b>Malagasy</b> francs, and declared 77 million <b>Malagasy</b> francs in annual revenues. Vivier (2007) demonstrates that the valuation of Ravalomanana's holdings and his annual revenue in particular were significantly underestimated.|$|E
5|$|Following a {{visit by}} Radama I to Madagascar's first formal school, {{established}} in Toamasina in 1818 {{by members of the}} London Missionary Society (LMS), the king invited the first Christian artisan missionaries to the capital city to share their knowledge. Beginning in December 1820, LMS missionaries established workshops in Antananarivo to teach brick-making, European carpentry and other practical skills, and developed a network of public schools where numeracy and English were taught alongside literacy using portions of the <b>Malagasy</b> language Bible. Despite high attendance at the schools, the LMS were initially unsuccessful in converting pupils to Christianity. Near the end of Radama's reign, the king came to regard the few <b>Malagasy</b> who had been converted as irreverent toward royal authority. He forbade <b>Malagasy</b> people from being baptized or attending Christian services.|$|E
5|$|Fossils of {{both the}} <b>Malagasy</b> pygmy {{hippopotamus}} and H. lemerlei show a cursorial adaptation, distinct from the hippos on the African continent, {{and they would have}} been much better runners. This common trait is a possible indicator that both species of <b>Malagasy</b> hippo descended from a common ancestor, and that the similarities to the modern hippopotamus and pygmy hippopotamus are a case of parallel evolution.|$|E
5|$|In 1993, Géraldine Veron and François Catzeflis {{published}} a DNA hybridization study {{suggesting that the}} fossa was {{more closely related to}} mongooses (family Herpestidae) than to cats or civets. However, in 1995, Veron's morphological study once again grouped it with Felidae. In 2003, molecular phylogenetic studies using nuclear and mitochondrial genes by Anne Yoder and colleagues showed that all native <b>Malagasy</b> carnivorans share a common ancestry that excludes other carnivores (meaning they form a clade, making them monophyletic) and are most closely related to Asian and African Herpestidae. To reflect these relationships, all <b>Malagasy</b> carnivorans are now placed in a single family, Eupleridae. Within Eupleridae, the fossa is placed in the subfamily Euplerinae along with the falanouc (Eupleres goudoti) and <b>Malagasy</b> civet, but its exact relationships are poorly resolved.|$|E
5|$|In early 1947 the French {{administration}} {{instituted a}} new rule that increased {{the weight of}} the French vote over the <b>Malagasy</b> vote in selection of candidates, and three PADESM candidates favored by French conservatives were successfully elected to the Conseil de la Republique. The results of the election and popular discontent with French interference served to intensify widespread frustration against the colonial authority and desire for <b>Malagasy</b> self-governance across the island. These factors finally erupted in a nationalist uprising that began on the evening of 29 March 1947 with attacks against a police camp and several French plantations in the eastern rainforest carried out by militant <b>Malagasy</b> nationalists, chief among them the members of the nationalist secret societies Vy Vato Sakelika (VVS) and Jiny.|$|E
5|$|In the Constitution of 2007, <b>Malagasy</b> {{remained}} the national language while official languages were reintroduced: <b>Malagasy,</b> French, and English. English was removed {{as an official}} language from the constitution approved by voters in the November 2010 referendum. The outcome of the referendum, and its consequences for official and national language policy, are not recognized by the political opposition, who cite lack of transparency and inclusiveness {{in the way the}} election was organized by the High Transitional Authority.|$|E
5|$|Mahaleo is a folk-pop {{band from}} Madagascar that is {{widely viewed as}} the most popular <b>Malagasy</b> group of all time. The band was founded by Dama (Rasolofondraosolo Zafimahaleo) with six of his classmates after first {{performing}} together during the rotaka student protests at their high school on 13 May 1972. Mahaleo's lyrics draw upon the indirect language of traditional hainteny and ohabolana (<b>Malagasy</b> poetry and proverbs) to expose contemporary political and social issues and invite listeners to identify their own solutions.|$|E
5|$|Meermin {{set sail}} from Madagascar on 20 January 1766, {{heading to the}} Cape Colony. Two days into the trip, Johann Godfried Krause, the ship's chief merchant, persuaded the captain, Gerrit Cristoffel Muller, to release the <b>Malagasy</b> slaves from their {{shackles}} and thus avoid attrition by death and disease in their overcrowded living conditions. The <b>Malagasy</b> were put to working the ship and entertaining the crew. In mid-February, Krause ordered the <b>Malagasy</b> to clean some Madagascan weapons, which they subsequently used to seize the ship {{in an attempt to}} regain their freedom; Krause was among the first of the crew to be killed, and Muller was stabbed three times but survived.|$|E
5|$|On , the ship's {{supercargo}} ordered some assegais, or African spears, {{and some}} swords, {{to be brought}} on deck for the <b>Malagasy</b> to clean. When the weapons were clean and the <b>Malagasy</b> were ordered to return them, they attacked the ship's crew, and {{took control of the}} ship. A truce ensued, the terms of which were that if the <b>Malagasy</b> would spare the lives of the remaining crew the ship would be sailed back to Madagascar, but taking advantage of the Malagasy's lack of navigational skills, the crew instead set sail for the coast of southern Africa.|$|E
5|$|On {{sighting}} land, {{the crew}} persuaded the <b>Malagasy</b> {{that what they}} saw {{was a part of}} Madagascar the mutineers were unfamiliar with: after further subterfuge by the crew, the <b>Malagasy</b> set Meermin to drift towards the shore at Struisbaai. But the sea was rough, and one of the ship's masts was cut down to improve her balance. Meermin eventually grounded on a sandbank, by which time a militia consisting of local farmers and burghers had been formed onshore, who had observed that the ship was flying no flags, which they recognised as a distress signal. The militia killed or captured those of the <b>Malagasy</b> who ventured ashore, and then organised the removal into custody of all <b>Malagasy</b> remaining on the ship, under the command of a magistrate from Stellenbosch. Meermin was assessed as beyond recovery, and left to break up where she grounded.|$|E
5|$|On {{the evening}} of 29 March 1947, coordinated {{surprise}} attacks were launched by <b>Malagasy</b> nationalists, armed mainly with spears, against military bases and French-owned plantations {{in the eastern part}} of the island concentrated around Moramanga and Manakara. The nationalist cause was rapidly adopted in the south and spread to the central highlands and the capital of Antananarivo by the following month, with the number of <b>Malagasy</b> nationalist fighters estimated at over one million.|$|E
5|$|Over the years, Madagascar has had {{different}} language policies under different influences of authority. The indigenous language of Madagascar, <b>Malagasy,</b> was the predominant language {{on the island}} until the French colonization in 1897. <b>Malagasy</b> has developed throughout the decades from an oral language to a language that has a written system (Latin orthography), a change that was enforced by King Radama I, in 1823.|$|E
5|$|Ravalomanana owns {{media group}} <b>Malagasy</b> Broadcasting System (MBS), which {{operates}} {{radio and television}} stations.|$|E
5|$|Since Madagascar gained {{independence}} from French colonial rule in 1960, <b>Malagasy</b> cuisine has reflected the island's diverse cultures and historic influences. Throughout the country, rice {{is considered the}} preeminent food and constitutes the main staple of the diet {{in all but the}} most arid regions of the south and west. Accompanying dishes served with rice vary regionally according to availability of ingredients and local cultural norms. Outside the home, <b>Malagasy</b> cuisine is served at simple roadside stalls (gargottes) or sit-down eateries (hotely). Snacks and rice-based meals may also be purchased from ambulatory street vendors. Upscale restaurants offer a wider variety of foreign cuisine and <b>Malagasy</b> dishes bearing French and other outside influences in preparation technique, ingredients and presentation alike.|$|E
5|$|The Antemoro soon {{developed}} a reputation as powerful sorcerers and astrologers, in large part owing to their monopoly on knowledge of writing, termed sorabe, which uses the Arabic script to transcribe the <b>Malagasy</b> language. Antemoro ombiasy (astrologer sages) migrated throughout the island, where they practiced their arts for local communities, served as advisers to kings, and even founded new principalities. This Antemoro mobility and their creation {{of a network of}} powerful spiritual advisers across the island is credited with forcing an awareness among <b>Malagasy</b> of communities beyond their own and sparking a sense of a common <b>Malagasy</b> identity. The Antemoro kingdom was disbanded in the late 19th century following an uprising of the Antemoro commoners against the noble class.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Malagasy</b> {{ethnic group}} forms over 90percent of Madagascar's {{population}} and is typically divided into eighteen ethnic sub-groups. Recent DNA research {{revealed that the}} genetic makeup of the average <b>Malagasy</b> person constitutes an approximately equal blend of Southeast Asian and East African genes, although the genetics of some communities show a predominance of Southeast Asian or East African origins or some Arab, Indian or European ancestry.|$|E
5|$|The Uprising and its {{repression}} caused {{trauma that}} continues to manifest in the <b>Malagasy</b> population. Many <b>Malagasy</b> nationals fought each other and struggle to reconcile themselves to the remorse and guilt. Healing {{at the national level}} is further {{complicated by the fact that}} the same leaders who proclaimed Madagascar's independence in 1960 were those who had been major players in the PADESM political party, which had been favored by the colonial administration after the crushing of the revolt.|$|E
5|$|The crew {{negotiated}} a truce, {{under the terms}} of which the <b>Malagasy</b> undertook to spare the lives of the surviving crew members. In exchange it was agreed that Meermin would return to Madagascar, where the <b>Malagasy</b> would be released. But gambling on the Malagasy's ignorance of navigation, the wounded Muller instead ordered his crew to head for the coast of southern Africa. After making landfall at Struisbaai, in the Cape Colony, which the <b>Malagasy</b> were assured was their homeland, 50–70 of them went ashore. Their intention was to signal to the others still on board Meermin if it was safe for them to follow, but the shore party soon found themselves confronted by a militia of farmers formed in response to Meermins arrival; the farmers had understood that as the ship was flying no flags, it was in distress.|$|E
5|$|The {{estimated}} number of <b>Malagasy</b> casualties varies {{from a low}} of 11,000 to a high of over 100,000. The nationalists killed approximately 550 French nationals, as well as 1,900 supporters of PADESM, a pro-France <b>Malagasy</b> political party created with support from the colonial authorities to compete with MDRM. By August 1948, the majority of the nationalist leaders were killed or captured, and the Uprising was effectively put down by December 1948.|$|E
5|$|The {{range of}} dishes eaten in Madagascar {{in the 21st century}} offers {{insight into the}} island's unique history and the {{diversity}} of the peoples who inhabit it today. The complexity of <b>Malagasy</b> meals can range from the simple, traditional preparations introduced by the earliest settlers, to the refined festival dishes prepared for the island's 19th-century monarchs. Although the classic <b>Malagasy</b> meal of rice and its accompaniment remains predominant, over the past 100 years other food types and combinations have been popularized by French colonists and immigrants from China and India. Consequently, <b>Malagasy</b> cuisine is traditional while also assimilating newly emergent cultural influences.|$|E
5|$|The {{weather had}} begun to deteriorate, and {{it was decided that}} the schuit was not strong enough to bring the {{remaining}} <b>Malagasy</b> ashore. One end of a rope was anchored to the shore, and at low tide volunteers from the Dutch group on shore swam out to Meermin, bringing {{the other end of the}} rope with them and handing it up to the crew on the ship. The crew then helped the remaining fifty-three <b>Malagasy</b> climb down to the Dutch volunteers, who helped them to shore, some carrying children on their backs. The Dutch built a fire to warm the <b>Malagasy</b> after their immersion in the water, and fed them; three wagons took them to Cape Town on 12March. Of the 140 or so <b>Malagasy</b> who had been shipped, 112 reached the Cape Colony as slaves.|$|E
