5|$|While {{there was}} initial {{speculation}} that Mustaine and Ellefson <b>might</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> reunite the Rust in Peace-era lineup, there was initially no {{statement from the}} band on the matter. It later came to light that the band had in fact been in discussions with former members Nick Menza (drums) and Marty Friedman (guitar), but were unable to reach an agreement. The opportunity would not arise again, as Menza {{died of a heart}} attack in May 2016.|$|E
5|$|In the past, the standard-bearer of the Mrkojevići clan, a Muslim, walked next to {{the cross}} with a flag in his left and a knife in his right hand, ready to use it if anyone {{attempted}} to take the cross. The clan especially feared that the participants from Krajina <b>might</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> recover the sacred object. At the end of 19th century the number of Muslims in the procession dropped as their religious and political leaders disapproved of their participation in it. After World War II, Yugoslavia's socialist government discouraged public religious celebrations, and the procession was not held between 1959 and 1984.|$|E
5|$|After the Klondike Gold Rush, {{the mounted}} police {{continued}} to spread their network of posts across the far north. In 1903, a small team of police under Inspector Charles Constantine {{were sent to}} Herschel Island to investigate the alleged sexual mistreatment of Inuit women by the transient whaling community there; the decision was also driven by fears that the United States <b>might</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> assert sovereignty over the wider Mackenzie Delta. The police {{found no evidence of}} sexual abuse, but took the opportunity to collect customs duties and to attempt to clamp down on liquor sales to the indigenous community. The same year, a well-publicised Canadian expedition was sent to Hudson Bay on the schooner SS Neptune, including Superintendent John Moodie and a small team of mounted police.|$|E

5|$|An extra in the film, Tyler Nelson, {{violated}} his nondisclosure {{agreement in}} an interview with The Edmond Sun on September 17, 2007, which was then picked up by the mainstream media. It is unknown if he remained in the final cut. At Nelson's request, The Edmond Sun subsequently pulled the story from its website. On October 2, 2007, a Superior Court order was filed finding that Nelson knowingly violated the agreement. The terms of the settlement were not disclosed. A number of production photos and sensitive documents pertaining to the film's production budget were also stolen from Spielberg's production office. The Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department set up a sting operation after being alerted by a webmaster that the thief <b>might</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> sell the photos. On October 4, 2007, the seller, 37-year-old Roderick Eric Davis, was arrested. He pleaded guilty to two felony counts and was sentenced to two years and four months in prison.|$|E
5|$|As the SAS {{operation}} concluded, the Chinooks ferried {{prisoners and}} bodies from Gberi Bana to the Jordanian battalion of UNAMSIL. From there, the bodies would {{be identified and}} buried, and those prisoners identified as West Side Boys would be {{handed over to the}} Sierra Leonean Police. Operation Barras also freed 22 Sierra Leonean civilians who had been held captive by the West Side Boys—the men were used as servants and put through crude military training by the West Side Boys, possibly with the intention of forcing them to fight in the future, while the women were used as sex slaves. Planners had been concerned that West Side Boys <b>might</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> conceal themselves among the civilians and so the civilians were also restrained and taken to the Jordanian peacekeepers' base to be identified. A 23rd civilian was caught in the crossfire and killed during the assault.|$|E
5|$|Up {{until the}} 1890s, the {{government}} had no presence in the far north-west of Canada. In 1894, the rise of gold mining and a growing population led to calls for Ottawa to intervene, both to control whiskey trading {{and to protect the}} local First Nations. In response, the mounted police carried out a survey along the Yukon River and gathered customs duties. Fears grew that the United States <b>might</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> seize the mineral-rich region, and a twenty-man police team was established at Forty Mile in 1895. Although there was very little actual crime, frictions soon rose between the police and the Miners' Committees, which had been created to provide informal justice during the previous few years. The police brought the issue to a head in June 1896, sending a team into one of the mining camps to overturn the decisions of the local committee.|$|E

5|$|Bonaparte {{knew that}} Ott {{had no way}} out from Alessandria, {{but he had no}} idea of Melas's position. Following his meeting with the spy and fearing that the Austrian general <b>might</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> escape, Bonaparte spread his army out in a wide net by sending Louis Desaix with Divisional General Jean Boudet's {{division}} (6,000 men) south to Novi Ligure and Divisional General Jean François Cornu de La Poype (3,500 men) north on the other bank of the Po. Further north, from Vercelli to Lake Maggiore, were stationed the divisions of Antoine de Béthencourt and Joseph Chabran and, further to the rear, north of Piacenza, Jean Thomas Guillaume Lorge's division. Bonaparte's view was confirmed when General Claude Victor-Perrin, supported by Divisional General Joachim Murat’s cavalry, swiftly evicted FML Andreas O'Reilly von Ballinlough’s Austrian brigade from Marengo village that afternoon. Victor then deployed divisional generals Gaspard Amédée Gardanne and Jacques-Antoine de Chambarlhac de Laubespin's divisions along the Fontanone stream. Austrian headquarters debated building a bridge to the north to outflank the French, but the lack of pontoons and time forced the Austrians to cross the river Bormida and then launch a single, direct assault across the Fontanone bridge.|$|E
5|$|Solis's {{confirmation}} hearings were held on January 9, 2009, before the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee. Committee chair Ted Kennedy repeatedly praised her, while, despite examination by Republican members, Solis {{declined to discuss}} specific policy issues, including the Employee Free Choice Act. Several days later, Senate Republicans said they <b>might</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> put a procedural hold on her nomination because of her unwillingness to answer questions in detail in the hearings. By January 23, a secret hold {{was placed on the}} nomination by an anonymous Republican. A series of written questions and responses between Republican members and Solis followed, during which she was more forthcoming. Republican Mike Enzi pressed her on whether her unpaid high-level positions at American Rights at Work constituted prohibited lobbying activity; Solis denied violation of rules of conduct and stated she had not helped lobbying. Solis did acknowledge that she had failed to report those positions on her annual House financial disclosure forms at the time, which a White House spokesperson argued was an unintentional oversight. On February 2, Obama appointed veteran Labor Department official Edward C. Hugler as Acting Secretary. The prolonged process was considered by some Republican aides to be a preview of future battles on labor issues between the Obama administration and Republicans in Congress.|$|E
5|$|The retiarius was {{routinely}} {{pitted against}} a heavily armed secutor. The net-fighter {{made up for}} his lack of protective gear by using his speed and agility to avoid his opponent's attacks {{and waiting for the}} opportunity to strike. He first tried to throw his net over his rival. If this succeeded, he attacked with his trident while his adversary was entangled. Another tactic was to ensnare his enemy's weapon in the net and pull it out of his grasp, leaving the opponent defenseless. Should the net miss or the secutor grab hold of it, the retiarius likely discarded the weapon, although he <b>might</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> collect it back for a second cast. Usually, the retiarius had to rely on his trident and dagger to finish the fight. The trident, as tall as a human being, permitted the gladiator to jab quickly and keep his distance. It was a strong weapon, capable of inflicting piercing wounds on an unprotected skull or limb. The dagger was the retiariuss final backup should the trident be lost. It was reserved for when close combat or a straight wrestling match had to settle the bout. In some battles, a single retiarius faced two secutores simultaneously. For these situations, the lightly armoured gladiator was placed on a raised platform and given a supply of stones with which to repel his pursuers.|$|E
