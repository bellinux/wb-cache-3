50|$|A <b>membrane</b> <b>switch</b> is an {{electrical}} switch for turning a circuit on and off. It differs from a mechanical switch, {{which is usually}} made of copper and plastic parts: a <b>membrane</b> <b>switch</b> is a circuit printed on PET or ITO. The ink used for screen printing is usually copper / silver / graphite filled and therefore conductive.|$|E

50|$|A <b>membrane</b> <b>switch</b> {{typically}} has 4 or more layers. The {{top layer}} of a <b>membrane</b> <b>switch</b> is the graphic interface between the user and the machine. The another critical layer is a printed circuit. This {{can also be a}} flex circuit made of copper and polyimide material. The layers are normally assembled using pressure-sensitive adhesives although inexpensive designs can be held together by other mechanical means such as a keyboard housing. Contact between two traces can be made through a printed shorting pad or through a metal dome that stands on legs.|$|E

5000|$|Many typists prefer {{buckling}} spring keyboards. [...] The buckling {{spring mechanism}} (expired [...] ) atop the switch {{is responsible for}} the tactile and aural response of the keyboard. This mechanism controls a small hammer that strikes a capacitive or <b>membrane</b> <b>switch.</b>|$|E
5000|$|A unique {{feature of}} the Chroma is that, when you operate a <b>membrane</b> <b>switch,</b> a [...] "tapper" [...] bumps the {{underside}} of the control panel, so as to mimic the tactile feedback of operating a conventional mechanical switch.

40|$|The {{fabrication}} {{and operation}} of membrane switches are discussed. The <b>membrane</b> <b>switch</b> functions as a normally open, momentary contact, low-voltage pressure-sensitive device. Its design is a three-layer sandwich usually constructed of polyester film. Conductive patterns are deposited onto the inner side of top and bottom sheets by silk screening. The center spacer is then placed between the two circuit layers to form a sandwich, generally held together by an adhesive. When pressure {{is applied to the}} top layer, it flexes through the punched openings of the spacer to establish electrical contact between conductive pads of the upper and lower sheets, momentarily closing the circuit. Upon release of force the top sheet springs back to its normal open position. The membrane touch switch is being used in a rapidly expanding range of applications, including instrumentation, appliances, electronic games and keyboards. Its board acceptance results from its low cost, durability, ease of manufacture, cosmetic appeal and design flexibility. The principal electronic components in the <b>membrane</b> <b>switch</b> are the conductor and dielectric...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: This paper overviews the {{application}} of RF MEMS switches in tunable filters as well as circuit developments for bandpass filters covering 110 MHz to 2. 8 GHz. RF MEMS have several desirable features, including small size, low power requirements, and low loss. The basic operation of Raytheon’s RF MEMS capacitive <b>membrane</b> <b>switch</b> is described. An overview of the technique used to integrate the switch into a variable capacitor structure with sixteen capacitance states is provided. Variable capacitor structures are used to construct multipole lumped bandpass filter designs, each with sixteen states. Finally, measured data from two representative five- and six-pole bandpass filters are presented. Characterization data demonstrates that the insertion loss for the five-pole filter using on-chip inductors was between 6. 6 and 7. 3 dB, and between 3. 7 and 4. 2 dB for the six-pole filter using off-chi...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{introduce}} the results of children's and teacher's experiences and feedback on DIY push-button workshops. The implementation of the workshops was based on the ideas of participatory design. An objective of the workshop was to make a working biased <b>membrane</b> <b>switch</b> from cheap and easily modifiable common materials. Participants of the pilot workshop were 11 children with special needs. The participants of the actual workshop were 69 children and 6 teachers. The data were collected by using videotaping, observations, and questionnaires. The results indicate that children can and like to participate in design and manufacturing of technology if they have an opportunity to do so. In addition the design of the push-buttons varied a great deal and the children's creativity in design of technology could be utilized more for making more adaptable and user-friendly technology. A special attention should be placed on the working arrangements, materials used, and guidance given to children when designing and manufacturing push-buttons with children with special needs. From the teacher's point of view making a push-button at school after the workshop would be very easy, interesting and likely since the materials were so easy to get...|$|E
40|$|Supplementation of {{the growth}} medium with high {{concentrations}} of sugars or low-molecular-weight dextrans results in a drastic change in the ratio of outer membrane proteins O- 8 and O- 9, due to induction of O- 8 synthesis and suppression of O- 9 synthesis. Sugars and dextrans of molecular weights greater than 600 to 700 switched the synthesis of O- 9 to that of O- 8 more effectively than those of lower molecular weight, although the effect was almost the same {{within each of the}} two groups irrespective of the differences in molecular weight within the group. Proteins O- 8 or O- 9, or both, are responsible for the formation of pores that allow the passive diffusion of hydrophilic molecules whose molecular weights are smaller than about 600 (T. Nakae, Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 71 : 877 - 884, 1976). The results indicate that substances that cannot pass through the outer <b>membrane</b> <b>switch</b> the synthesis of O- 9 to that of O- 8 more effectively than those that can penetrate this membrane with the aid of O- 8, O- 9, or both. It is suggested that the osmotic pressure exerted on the outer membrane {{plays an important role in}} the regulation of synthesis of the two proteins...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{documents}} the successful development {{and evaluation of}} a novel <b>membrane</b> <b>switch.</b> The process results in lower environmental burdens and manufacturing costs than current screen-printed polyester solutions. Detailed is the evaluation of offset lithographically printed conductive tracks on paper substrates for application in computer keyboard assemblies. Offset lithographic printing of conductive tracks is an emerging fabrication technique finding application in lowcost, high volume, flexible circuitry applications. The primary advantages of this process are reduced ink volumes, reduced substrate costs and high production speeds, resulting in lower overheadhnit burdens. The use ofpaper as a substrate material has advantages of lower environmental impact, and lower unit costs than polyester or polycarbonate substrate materials. The selection of a suitable paper {{is crucial to the}} conductivity of the printed conductor and lifetime of the switch membrane. Parameters governing the successful application of new materials to switchpad circuits include track resistance, migration resistance and switch contact resistances. These have been characterised and are reported. Lifetime tests have been conducted and the printed films exposed to a regime of standard 85 RH/ 85 "C and corrosive atmosphere tests. The lifetime of the switches has been investigated, and exceeds the normal industry specification. Several fully featured demonstration keyboards and switch membranes have been constructed and tested. These are currently in use in o&e environments and will be presented...|$|E

40|$|Inflammatory bowel {{diseases}} {{are associated with}} increased risk of developing colitis-associated colorectal cancer (CAC). Epidemiological data show that the consumption of ¿- 3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (¿- 3 PUFAs) decreases the risk of sporadic colorectal cancer (CRC). Importantly, recent data have shown that eicosapentaenoic acid-free fatty acid (EPA-FFA) reduces polyp formation and growth in models of familial adenomatous polyposis. However, the effects of dietary EPA-FFA are unknown in CAC. We tested the effectiveness of substituting EPA-FFA, for other dietary fats, in preventing inflammation and cancer in the AOM-DSS model of CAC. The AOM-DSS protocols were designed to evaluate the effect of EPA-FFA on both initiation and promotion of carcinogenesis. We found that EPA-FFA diet strongly decreased tumor multiplicity, incidence and maximum tumor size in the promotion and initiation arms. Moreover EPA–FFA, in particular in the initiation arm, led to reduced cell proliferation and nuclear ß-catenin expression, whilst it increased apoptosis. In both arms, EPA-FFA treatment led to increased <b>membrane</b> <b>switch</b> from ¿- 6 to ¿- 3 PUFAs and a concomitant reduction in PGE 2 production. We observed no significant changes in intestinal inflammation between EPA-FFA treated arms and AOM-DSS controls. Importantly, we found that EPA-FFA treatment restored the loss of Notch signaling found in the AOM-DSS control and resulted in the enrichment of Lactobacillus species in the gut microbiota. Taken together, our data suggest that EPA-FFA is an excellent candidate for CRC chemoprevention in CAC...|$|E
40|$|Functional {{electrical}} stimulation (FES) {{has been developed}} in order to restore paralyzed motor functions of patients who have injured their upper motor neurons. Use of tongue movement was proposed as a control command for an FES system, because even quadriplegic patients can move their tongue voluntarily and generate much information easily. In this paper, we investigated the tongue movement by using a simple measurement system that simulated an input part of control commands in an FES system. The measurement system consisted of a 16 -key <b>membrane</b> <b>switch</b> array, and a personal computer. The switch array detected the tongue movement as shift of touching area of the buccal region. We measured and discussed recognition rates by which the measurement system could recognize direction of tongue movement correctly. In this discussion, we assumed the following command-rules; transverse and longitudinal direction were accepted as a command, and reentry was required if oblique direction or undetected condition occurred. Five healthy subjects operated the system by their tongue in experiments, and the recognition rates were calculated. The rates within three entries were more than 85 % even by less-experienced subjects; more than 95 % by some subjects. The results of experiments during 5 days indicated that the repeatability of {{the recognition of the}} tongue movement was high. It implied that a precise calibration of a relative position between the system and a subject was not necessary. The results of this paper verified the fundamental feasibility of the use of tongue movement as a control command for an FES syste...|$|E
