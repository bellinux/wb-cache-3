5|$|The character's {{death was}} and {{continues}} to be ranked in public polls of various opinions. It was voted Best Drama <b>Moment</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> BBC's annual TV Moments broadcast in 2004. The same year, a poll conducted for National Pub Week ranked the scene where a barman scoops some of Rachel's ashes into a bucket the fifth best of various pub-related television scenes. In 2008, the death was ranked at number three in Sky One's 50 Greatest TV Endings programme. In a 2010 public poll to promote Freeview HD, Rachel's death was ranked as the seventh most emotional TV moment. In 2011, Rachel's wedding to Adam was placed at number nine in Channel 5's Greatest TV Weddings programme. Colin McAllister opined that every woman's heart broke when they married.|$|E
5|$|When any {{aircraft}} {{passes the}} critical mach {{of that particular}} airframe, the centre of pressure shifts rearwards. This causes a pitch down <b>moment</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> aircraft if the centre of gravity remains where it was. The engineers designed the wings in a specific manner to reduce this shift, {{but there was still}} a shift of about 2metres. This could have been countered by the use of trim controls, but at such high speeds this would have dramatically increased drag. Instead, the distribution of fuel along the aircraft was shifted during acceleration and deceleration to move the centre of gravity, effectively acting as an auxiliary trim control.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{his absence}} from Constantinople {{at the time}} of Phocas's takeover, and because he {{retained}} a large measure of support within the soldiery, Priscus {{was the only one of}} Maurice's senior generals who was retained by the new regime, whereas Comentiolus and Peter were executed and Philippicus was banished to a monastery. A possible explanation for this comes from the later historian Paul the Deacon, who records, possibly based on early 7th-century sources, that Phocas had once served as an equerry under Priscus. At any rate, Priscus was soon counted among the main supporters of the new regime. In the winter of 602/603, he was made comes excubitorum, commander of the imperial bodyguard. In 606 or 607, he also married Phocas's daughter, Domentzia, becoming the effective heir-apparent to the sonless ruler. In the games celebrated at the Hippodrome to honor the event, however, Phocas reacted violently when he saw portraits of Priscus and Domentzia carried alongside his by the citizens. From this <b>moment</b> <b>on,</b> <b>the</b> chroniclers report, Priscus turned against Phocas.|$|E

25|$|The Taipings beat a hasty retreat, {{rather than}} lay siege {{to such a}} hornet's nest.

25|$|On 8 May 1926, {{there was}} a {{dramatic}} <b>moment</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> London Docks. Lorries were protected by the army. They broke the picket line and transported food to Hyde Park.

Churchill had wanted, in a move that could have proved unnecessarily antagonistic to the strikers, to arm the soldiers. Baldwin, however, had insisted otherwise.|$|E

500|$|... "You Lost Me" [...] {{was written}} by Aguilera, Furler and its producer, Samuel Dixon. The song is a ballad lasts for a {{duration}} of [...] (four minutes and 17 seconds). Written in the key of A minor, [...] "You Lost Me" [...] has a tempo of 50 beats per minute. Aguilera's vocal range spans from E♭3 to E5. The verses are sung by Aguilera using melisma. The song's instrumentation comes from piano and strings. Hinshaw Drew of The Village Voice labelled it the [...] "un-bionic <b>moment</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> record".|$|E

500|$|Since airing, {{the episode}} has {{received}} positive reviews from critics. The {{authors of the}} book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, thought well of the episode, saying, [...] "A fun episode, where you root for Bart and, unusually, Nelson - all the way through. Homer is just too stupid for words, but that's excusable because we finally see Ned Flanders lose it, big time!" [...] In 2011, Keith Plocek of LA Weeklys Squid Ink blog named the scene in which Homer tries to purchase [...] "beer that has candy floating in it" [...] (which Homer calls skittlebrau) at the Kwik-E-Mart as the fourth best food <b>moment</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> show.|$|E
500|$|During the {{production}} in Toronto, many black community {{leaders and their}} supporters expressed opposition to the show, protesting {{in front of the}} theatre, [...] "shouting insults and waving placards reading SHOW BOAT SPREADS LIES AND HATE and SHOW BOAT = CULTURAL GENOCIDE". Various theatre critics in New York, however, commented that Prince highlighted racial inequality in his production as to show its injustice, as well as to show the historical suffering of blacks. A critic noted that he included [...] "an absolutely beautiful piece of music cut from the original production and from the movie ... a haunting gospel melody sung by the black chorus. The addition of this number is so successful because it salutes the dignity and the pure talent of the black workers and allows them to shine for a brief <b>moment</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> center stage of the showboat".|$|E

500|$|Evan Sawdey of PopMatters said, [...] "Of all the ballads, though, {{the quiet}} piano closer 'Glitter in the Air' takes the cake, never once overplaying its hand, {{remaining}} sweet without once ever succumbing to saccharine niceties (think of a Jason Robert Brown song without the vocal showboating). It's the sweetest <b>moment</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> entire disc, {{but it only}} succeeds because it's also the least complex song here". Craig Emonds of The South End stated that while [...] "every song has potential to do well and is quite likable, [...] Pink's vocals are strong and shine particularly in the ballad 'Glitter In The Air'." [...] Nekesa Mumbi Moodoy of the Associated Press said that [...] "What makes the song so moving is that despite all of the heartache, she doesn't appear gun-shy about taking the leap again".|$|E
500|$|Erik Adams of The A.V. Club {{gave the}} episode a [...] "B+".

He wrote {{that there were many}} tender moments in the episode, such as Dwight and Jim's confrontation, Pam and Jim's reaffirmation of love, and Dwight's proposal to Angela. He concluded that [...] "It's that blend of new beginnings and closing circles that makes 'AARM' an effective second-to-last chapter of The Office". Dan Forcella of TV Fanatic awarded the episode four-and-a-half stars out of five, and wrote that the episode [...] "didn't disappoint". He called [...] "the scene in which Pam was watching the docu-created montage just as Jim was giving Dwight love advice" [...] the [...] "most emotionally rewarding <b>moment</b> <b>on</b> <b>The</b> Office since Michael Scott's goodbye." ...|$|E

It’s this 'oh shit... maybe this isn’t what God wants'. I think it’s the darkest <b>moment</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> record." [...] Spearman called the inclusion of loaded, political lyrics on otherwise upbeat songs [...] "the Trojan Horse approach ... get your interesting lyrical idea into something that {{on the face of it}} is just there to be enjoyed". Higgs told NME that Kanye West's 2013 album Yeezus had a major impact on his writing, encouraging him to present himself more confidently, while Nick Cave provided inspiration to be more impulsive with his writing.|$|E
