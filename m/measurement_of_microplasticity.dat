40|$|The {{literature}} on the internal friction of martensite, the theory <b>of</b> <b>microplasticity,</b> and the <b>microplasticity</b> <b>of</b> iron-based alloys is reviewed. Low-frequency internal friction, strain relaxation and microplasticity tests were conducted on a 0. 4 % carbon martensite. Modifications to the Ke pendulum made strain relaxation and microplasticity tests possible. Amplitude-dependent damping at temperatures of 20 to 130 °C was explained by coherent precipitation of ? -carbide. Koster type experiments at temperatures of 125 - 188 °C support the pinning model of Beaulieu. The peak in the temperature range 210 - 250 °C at a frequency of 1 Hz observed in bainite was shown to be analogous to the 200 - 250 °C peak present in martensite. The background damping is discussed, a method for its removal presented and {{the width of the}} isolated peaks analysed to determine their width parameter B. The separate effect of initial stress and testing temperature on the strain relaxation at constant stress for 0. 4 % carbon martensite at temperatures up to 255 °C are interpretted by thermally activated unpinning of dislocations. Curves at 110 and 137 °C were used to determine the parameter B, and these values in conjunction with those obtained from the peak width suggest that the distribution in the relaxation time is in ?. The internal friction of martensite was analysed in terms of the current theories for the cold-worked peak and it was found to be consistent with the theories proposed by Schoeck, and Ino and Sugeno. Microplasticity tests on martensite between 20 and 387 °C show that, depending upon testing conditions, reversible and irreversible bowing of dislocations can occur. Attempts were made to explain this bowing, and hence the internal friction of martensite, in terms of the double kink mechanism <b>of</b> <b>microplasticity.</b> An unidentified peak at 300 °C for 1 Hz was discovered in an Fe - 28 % Cr. alloy quenched from 1100 °C...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe nanoindentation test of {{a single}} crystal of {{tungsten}} is simulated by a multiscale model based on a nonlinear elastic finite element analysis coupled with both ab initio calculations of the ideal shear strength and crystallographic considerations. The onset <b>of</b> <b>microplasticity,</b> associated with the pop-in effect identified in experimental nanoindentation tests (creation of first dislocations), {{is assumed to be}} related to the moment of achieving the value of the ideal shear strength for the copper crystal under a superimposed hydrostatic stress. The calculated value of the critical indentation depth is in a very good correspondence with that of the experimentally observed pop-in on the load-displacement curve. The value of the Young modulus of tungsten received from the reduced modulus of elasticity of the original Hertz's model is also in an excellent agreement with experimental data. This offers us a possibility to assess the concentration of alloying and impurity elements in the surface and sub-surface layers...|$|R
40|$|WOSInternational audienceDifferent {{approaches}} {{have been proposed}} to link high cycle fatigue properties to thermal measurements under cyclic loadings, usually referred to as “self-heating tests. ” This paper focuses on two models whose parameters are tuned by resorting to self-heating tests and then used to predict high cycle fatigue properties. The first model is based upon a yield surface approach to account for stress multiaxiality at a microscopic scale, whereas the second one relies on a probabilistic modelling <b>of</b> <b>microplasticity</b> at the scale of slip-planes. Both model identifications are cost effective, relying mainly on quickly-obtained temperature data in self-heating tests. They both describe {{the influence of the}} stress heterogeneity, the volume effect and the hydrostatic stress on fatigue limits. The thermal effects and mean fatigue limit predictions are in good agreement with experimental results for in and out-of phase tension-torsion loadings. In the case of fatigue under non-proportional loading paths, the mean fatigue limit prediction error of the critical shear stress approach is three times less than with the yield surface approach...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} the {{evolution}} of the Young’s Modulus (E) during unloading with plastic deformation has been studied for different Dual-Phase AHSS from DP 780 to DP 1400. During unloading, all the DP steels studied showed the presence <b>of</b> <b>microplasticity</b> so an Apparent Young’s Modulus (EA) has been defined. Although that in all cases EA decreased with a non-linear behavior as the plastic strain was increased, it has been observed that the final percentage of decrease seems {{to be related to the}} microstructure of DP steels. As the ferrite content increased as in the lower strength DP steels, the reduction of EA is larger, reaching a 21 %. The introduction of the variation of the elastic response during unloading in the simulation of a bending operation has allowed obtaining an improvement of the accuracy in springback prediction in all the DP steels studied. For the low strength DP steels the final shape obtained by simulation is in fact the same than the real one. As the strength of steel is increased, the accuracy is less, especially in the DP 1400 steel, in which differences in bending angle higher than a 15 % are still found...|$|R
40|$|A 36 {{steel is}} a {{commonly}} used material in civil engineering structures where fatigue damage {{can lead to}} catastrophic failure. In this research, nonlinear Rayleigh surface waves are used to characterize damage in A 36 steel specimens caused by monotonic tension and low cycle fatigue. Fatigue damage produces the increased acoustic nonlinearity {{that leads to the}} generation of measurable higher harmonics in an initially monochromatic Rayleigh wave signal. One specimen is subjected to static tension and four specimens are used for low cycle fatigue tests in the tension-tension mode with a constant stress amplitude. The fatigue tests are interrupted at different numbers of cycles for the nonlinear ultrasonic measurements. Tone burst Rayleigh wave signals are generated and detected using a pair of oil coupled wedge transducers. The amplitudes of the first and second harmonic are measured at varying propagation distances to obtain the nonlinearity parameter for a given damage state. The experimental results show an increase of acoustic nonlinearity {{in the early stages of}} fatigue life. Furthermore, a close relationship between plastic deformation and the acoustic nonlinearity is found, which indicates that the acoustic nonlinearity is indeed a measure <b>of</b> <b>microplasticity</b> in this material.

40|$|Neutron {{irradiation}} {{and thermal}} ageing {{are known to}} cause embrittlement of pressure vessel steels, but the underlying microstructural processes are not well known. In order to acquire {{a better understanding of}} embrittlement, we investigate pressure vessel steels in unirradiated, thermally aged and neutron irradiated conditions, using an inverted torsion pendulum. Our studies have revealed a marked effect on the damping due to neutron irradiation, which, according to previous work, is related to interactions between dislocations and neutron induced defects. We also found that the magnitude of this effect depends on the steel type (JRQ, Doel, [...] .). Thermal ageing shows similar effects of hardening. A difference in the damping can also be observed between base and weld metal, giving an indication {{of the importance of the}} chemical composition. At a critical amplitude the behaviour of the damping with vibration amplitude changes considerably. This can be related to the onset <b>of</b> <b>microplasticity.</b> Our <b>measurements</b> have shown that the critical amplitude is higher for thermally aged steel than for unirradiated specimens, indicating an increase in microyield due to thermal ageing. However, such an effect has not yet been established beyond doubt for irradiated steel specimens. A comparison of these results with tensile test results will be presented...|$|R

The kinematic measurements were performed by the so called grid method. In order to produce the gratings, direct interferential photolithography was used. The gratings were digitized through the use of a white-light interferometric microscope. An adapted image stitching algorithm, applied to the phase maps, has been developed and implemented in order to extend the size of the region of interest. With this method, and by paying a particular attention to the conduct of the mechanical tests, the strain resolution obtained ranges from 1 to 2 * 10 ^- 3 for a spatial resolution of about 20 µm. In this paper, the method was applied to the study of the onset of local elasto-plastic strains in a ferritic steel coupon.

This paper is a discussion of these different aspects for three types of ceramics : silica glasses, glassceramics and sintered alumina. For glasses, the influence of silica's permanent densification on the material's rigidity and on its spall strength is discussed. For glass-ceramics, we show the existence of a microcraking of the material for a stress lower than their Hugoniot elastic limit.
