5|$|The premaxillary bones {{each house}} a single incisor, {{which is located}} at the front tip. They end in a V shape at the front margin and in a narrow point at the back margin. Inside each premaxilla is a large opening, the {{anterior}} palatal foramen. The <b>maxillary</b> <b>bone</b> contains the other upper teeth. The mandible ranges from thin to robust and houses the lower teeth.|$|E
5|$|Oryzomys {{species have}} a large skull with a short rostrum and high braincase. The interorbital region, located between the eyes, is narrowest {{to the front and}} is flanked by {{well-developed}} beads at its margins. The zygomatic plate is broad and has a well-developed zygomatic notch at its front. The zygomatic arch is robust and contains a small but distinct jugal bone. The interparietal bone, part of the roof of the braincase, is narrow and short; its narrowness is a synapomorphy for O.couesi plus the marsh rice rat according to Weksler's analysis. The incisive foramina are long, with their back margin {{at the front of the}} first molars or further back. The palate is also long, extending beyond the back margin of the <b>maxillary</b> <b>bone,</b> and is perforated near the third molars by well-developed posterolateral palatal pits. There is no alisphenoid strut, an extension of the alisphenoid bone that in some other oryzomyines separates two foramina in the skull. The auditory bullae are large. The condition of the arteries in the head is highly derived. In the mandible (lower jaw), the coronoid process, a process at the back, is well developed and the capsular process, a raising of the mandibular bone housing the root of the lower incisor, is conspicuous.|$|E

5000|$|The maxilla (plural: maxillae [...] ) {{in animals}} is the upper jawbone formed from {{the fusion of}} two <b>maxillary</b> <b>bones.</b> The upper jaw {{includes}} the frontal portion of the palate of the mouth. The two <b>maxillary</b> <b>bones</b> are fused at the intermaxillary suture. This {{is similar to the}} mandible (lower jaw), which is also a fusion of two mandibular bones at the mandibular symphysis.|$|R
50|$|Maxillary {{hypoplasia}} is a underdevelopment of the <b>maxillary</b> <b>bones,</b> {{which produces}} midfacial retrusion and creates {{the illusion of}} protuberance of the lower jaw. It is associated with Crouzon syndrome, as well as fetal alcohol syndrome.|$|R
5000|$|The maxillary sinuses, {{the largest}} of the {{paranasal}} sinuses, are under the eyes, in the <b>maxillary</b> <b>bones</b> (open {{in the back of the}} semilunar hiatus of the nose). They are innervated by the trigeminal nerve.|$|R
25|$|In the vipers, {{which have}} the most highly {{developed}} venom delivery apparatus, the venom gland is very large and is surrounded by the masseter or temporal muscle, which consists of two bands, the superior arising from behind the eye, the inferior extending from the gland to the mandible. A duct carries venom from the gland to the fang. In vipers and elapids, this groove is completely closed, forming a hypodermic needle-like tube. In other species, the grooves are not covered, or only partially covered. From the anterior extremity of the gland, the duct passes below the eye and above the <b>maxillary</b> <b>bone,</b> to the basal orifice of the venom fang, which is ensheathed in a thick fold of mucous membrane. By means of the movable <b>maxillary</b> <b>bone</b> hinged to the prefrontal bone and connected with the transverse bone which is pushed forward by muscles set in action by {{the opening of the}} mouth, the fang is erected and the venom discharged through the distal orifice. When the snake bites, the jaws close and the muscles surrounding the gland contract, causing venom to be ejected via the fangs.|$|E
25|$|The {{definitive}} {{symptom of}} ONJ is {{the exposure of}} mandibular or <b>maxillary</b> <b>bone</b> through lesions in the gingiva that do not heal. Pain, inflammation of the surrounding soft tissue, secondary infection or drainage {{may or may not}} be present. The development of lesions is most frequent after invasive dental procedures, such as extractions, and is also known to occur spontaneously. There may be no symptoms for weeks or months, until lesions with exposed bone appear. Lesions are more common on the mandible than the maxilla.|$|E
25|$|The fangs, {{which are}} {{enlarged}} and hollow, {{are the first}} two teeth on each <b>maxillary</b> <b>bone.</b> Usually only one fang is in place on each side at any time. The maxilla is intermediate in both length and mobility between typical colubrids (long, less mobile) and viperids (very short, highly mobile). When the mouth is closed, the fangs fit into grooved slots in the buccal floor and usually below {{the front edge of}} the eye and are angled backwards; some elapids (Acanthophis, taipan, mamba, and king cobra) have long fangs on quite mobile maxillae and can make fast strikes.|$|E
3000|$|PASW Statistics 18 for Windows (SPSS Inc., Tokyo, Japan) {{was used}} for {{statistical}} processing. Student’s t-test {{was used to test}} for comparison between dentulous and edentulous <b>maxillary</b> <b>bones.</b> The p value was set to < 0.05.|$|R
30|$|A {{total of}} 40 <b>maxillary</b> <b>bones</b> {{comprising}} 20 dentulous maxillae and 20 edentulous maxillae were imaged by micro-CT for 3 D observation and {{measurement of the}} IC and alveolar bone in the anterior region of the IC.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to horns, Tetraceratops {{also had an}} impressive set of teeth. The second pair of teeth on the <b>maxillary</b> <b>bones</b> were large and fang-like. Likewise the first teeth in the upper jaw were long and dagger-like.|$|R
25|$|The {{ability and}} degree of {{regeneration}} in reptiles differs among the various species, but the most notable and well-studied occurrence is tail-regeneration in lizards. In addition to lizards, regeneration has been observed in the tails and <b>maxillary</b> <b>bone</b> of crocodiles and adult neurogenesis has also been noted. Tail regeneration has never been observed in snakes. Lizards possess the highest regenerative capacity as a group. Following autonomous tail loss, epimorphic regeneration of a new tail proceeds through a blastema-mediated process that results in a functionally and morphologically similar structure. Tail regeneration in lizards presents an interesting case study {{for the evolution of}} regenerative abilities as regenerative ability among the 3,300 extant species varies greatly among them.|$|E
25|$|Six tombs {{were built}} on a {{perfectly}} outlined patio, one of them unfinished; there is another one associated to this group with the same characteristics; the walls are made with stone blocks perfectly cut and jointed with mortar; the floor is compacted earth; the tombs are covered by large stone slabs, some with worked edges. The location dimensions of six of them is very interesting as they were constructed symmetrically; in {{the central part of}} the group, the slab forming the roof of tomb number 2 serves as weight to number 4, that is oriented perpendicularly, with a cruciform aspect although in fact they are two rectangles. Each grave contained remains of an adult primary burial accompanied by rich and numerous offerings consisting of pottery, shell objects, bone and stone tools. A three by eighteen ditch was excavated, in which sixty three primary and secondary burials were found with numerous fragments clearly identified as decapitations or mutilations, that is to say, skulls with the atlas and <b>maxillary</b> <b>bone</b> in place or the bones of an arm with hand but without the rest of the body.|$|E
25|$|All viperids have {{a pair of}} {{relatively}} long solenoglyphous (hollow) fangs {{that are used to}} inject venom from glands located towards the rear of the upper jaws, just behind the eyes. Each of the two fangs is {{at the front of the}} mouth on a short <b>maxillary</b> <b>bone</b> that can rotate back and forth. When not in use, the fangs fold back against the roof of the mouth and are enclosed in a membranous sheath. The left and right fangs can be rotated together or independently. During a strike, the mouth can open nearly 180° and the maxilla rotates forward, erecting the fangs as late as possible so that the fangs do not become damaged, as they are brittle. The jaws close upon impact and the muscular sheaths encapsulating the venom glands contract, injecting the venom as the fangs penetrate the target. This action is very fast; in defensive strikes, it will be more a stab than a bite. Viperids use this mechanism primarily for immobilization and digestion of prey. Secondarily, it is used for self-defence, though in cases with nonprey, such as humans, they may give a dry bite (not inject any venom). A dry bite allows the snake to conserve their precious reserve of venom, because once it has been depleted, it takes time to replenish, leaving the snake vulnerable.|$|E

500|$|The eastern {{green mamba}} is a large, with a {{slightly}} compressed, and very slender bodied snake with a medium to moderately long tapering tail. Adult males average around [...] in total length, while females average [...] in total length. This species rarely exceeds lengths of [...] In general, the total length is 4-4.3 times {{the length of the}} tail. The head is narrow, elongate, and coffin-shaped with a distinct canthus and slightly distinct from the neck. When threatened or otherwise aroused in some way, this species is capable of flattening its neck area, though no real hood formed. The eastern green mamba has relatively long front fangs located at proscenium end of the <b>maxillary</b> <b>bone</b> at the very front of the maxilla, which can rotate at its axis with the prefrontal bone, giving this species more control of the movements of their fangs, unlike other elapids. The <b>maxillary</b> <b>bone</b> has no other solid teeth. However, a pair of long, recurved, fang-like solid teeth, followed behind by a distinct interspace and numerous small teeth are {{on the front of the}} lower jaw. Their eyes are medium in size with round pupils.|$|E
500|$|The incisive foramina, {{perforations}} of {{the palate}} between the incisors and the molars, are short, not extending between the molars. The {{condition of the}} posterolateral palatal pits is variable, with some individuals having small pits and others having larger pits that may be recessed into a [...] (depression). The palate is moderately long, extending beyond the molars but not beyond the posterior margins of the <b>maxillary</b> <b>bone.</b> In most specimens, {{the roof of the}} mesopterygoid fossa, the gap behind the back of the palate, is not perforated by sphenopalatine vacuities and thus it is fully ossified; if present, these vacuities are small. Mindomys lacks an alisphenoid strut; in some other oryzomyines, this extension of the alisphenoid bone separates two openings (foramina) in the skull, the masticatory–buccinator foramen and the foramen ovale accessorium. There are no openings in the mastoid bone. The squamosal bone lacks a suspensory process that contacts the tegmen tympani, the roof of the tympanic cavity, a defining character of oryzomyines.|$|E
2500|$|The {{teeth of}} Coelophysis were typical of predatory dinosaurs, blade-like, recurved, sharp and jagged with fine {{serrations}} {{on both the}} anterior and posterior edges. Its dentition shows that it was carnivorous, probably preying on the small, lizard-like animals that were discovered with it. It may also have hunted in packs to tackle larger prey.Coelophysis bauri has approximately 26 teeth on the <b>maxillary</b> <b>bone</b> of the upper jaw and 27 teeth on the dentary bone of the lower jaw. Carpenter (2002) examined the bio-mechanics of theropods forelimbs and attempted to evaluate their usefulness in predation. He concluded that the forelimb of Coelophysis was flexible and had a good range of motion, but its bone structure suggested that it was comparatively weak.

40|$|There {{is often}} a disharmony of maxillary and mandibular widths when {{preoperative}} orth-odontic treatment is completed before sur-gery. If the mandibular width {{is larger than the}} maxillary width, then maxillary width expansion or mandibular width constriction is necessary; however, in general, the majority of cases opt for orthodontic maxillary arch width expansion. Cases involving the maxillary expansion include the expansion of the dental alveolus and the ex-pansion of the <b>maxillary</b> <b>bones.</b> The expansion of the dental alveolus is difficult to perform once the growth period is complete, and only a limited amount of expansion can be achieved.
