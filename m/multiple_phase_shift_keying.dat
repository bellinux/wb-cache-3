40|$|Compressive sensing {{theory can}} be applied to {{reconstruct}} the signal with far fewer measurements than what is usually considered necessary, while in many scenarios, such as spectrum detection and modulation recognition, we only expect to acquire useful characteristics rather than the original signals, where selecting the feature with sparsity becomes the main challenge. With the aim of digital modulation recognition, the paper mainly constructs two features which can be recovered directly from compressive samples. The two features are the spectrum of received data and its nonlinear transformation and the compositional feature of multiple high-order moments of the received data; both of them have desired sparsity required for reconstruction from subsamples. Recognition of multiple frequency shift keying, <b>multiple</b> <b>phase</b> <b>shift</b> <b>keying,</b> and multiple quadrature amplitude modulation are considered in our paper and implemented in a unified procedure.

40|$|A <b>multiple</b> <b>phase</b> <b>shift</b> <b>keying</b> (MPSK) spread {{spectrum}} communications receiver uses weighted correlation techniques for carrier recovery and tracking. The receiver includes three subsystems: a synchronization system, a carrier tracking system, and a data demodulation system. To demodulate the received signal, the receiver requires a carrier frequency {{that matches the}} frequency of an associated transmitter {{as well as the}} sampling (or chip) and symbol clocks that are synchronized with those of the transmitter. In the disclosed receiver, the carrier tracking subsystem continually tracks the carrier frequency of the received signal using a tracking scheme that uses weighted correlation techniques. The weighted correlation technique combines signals from two correlator modules, an R-correlator module and a W-correlator module, to generate the correlation output.; The R-correlator is similar to conventional correlators. The W-correlator, however, is unlike conventional correlators. Each product term of the correlation is weighted by a sampling index within a symbol period and then summed to obtain a weighted correlation value. The receiver has a tracking range that is twice the symbol rate and the tracking range is independent of the number of keying phases M. published_or_final_versio...|$|E

The conventional RBF uses basis functions which rely on distance measures such as Gaussian kernel of Euclidean distance (ED) between feature vector and neuron’s center, and so forth. In this work, we introduce a novel RBF artificial neural network (ANN) where the basis function utilizes a linear combination of ED based Gaussian kernel and a cosine kernel where the cosine kernel computes the angle between feature and center vectors. Novelty of the proposed work relies {{on the fact that}} we have shown that there may be scenarios where the two feature vectors (FV) are more prominently distinguishable via the proposed cosine measure as compared to the conventional ED measure. We discuss adaptive symbol detection for <b>multiple</b> <b>phase</b> <b>shift</b> <b>keying</b> (MPSK) signals as a practical example to show where the angle information can be pivotal which in turn justifies our proposed RBF kernel.
