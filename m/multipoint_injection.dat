The exterior design {{is based on the}} Lucciola, a 1993 Fiat Cinquecento concept by Italdesign Giugiaro which had been rejected by Fiat. The 0.8-litre gasoline engine and the transmission were carryovers from the Daewoo Tico, but it was now using a <b>multipoint</b> <b>injection</b> fuel system.

40|$|Abstract. The <b>multipoint</b> steam <b>injection</b> {{string of}} the {{horizontal}} well is a commonly used downhole component for high efficiency steam injection of the thermal recovery horizontal well. A reasonable {{layout of the}} valves to ensure an even steam output of each point is still not well designed. At present, a general design method which is urgently necessary isn’t applied by each factory. According to the balance relationship of the momentum, the energy and {{the mass of the}} fluid flowing in the string, the pressure distribution equation of the fluid flowing in the <b>multipoint</b> steam <b>injection</b> string is built. On the basis of this equation, the design calculation method of the <b>multipoint</b> steam <b>injection</b> string is come up with. A specific example is given in the paper. Study shows that, with the equation built in this paper, the string can be designed with each axial valve having the same output, so that the technical demand of an even steam injection of the horizontal well section can be met...|$|R

Early in the design process Ferrari engineers assisted {{in the development of the}} engine. MV (Cagiva at the time) quickly deviated from the Ferrari design, but they kept one important feature, the radial valves. The F4 engine is unique in the sense that it is the only radial valved motorcycle engine currently in production.|$|E
50|$|In 1989, Renault {{launched}} the sports {{version of the}} Renault 19, replacing the Renault 9 Turbo and Renault 11 Turbo. Renault abandons its legendary 1.4 Cléon-Fonte turbo carburetor {{in favor of a}} multi-valve engine and <b>multipoint</b> <b>injection,</b> it will be an evolution of the engine of 1721 cm³ F2N, the race remains the same, but the bore is increased, giving a displacement of 1764 cm³, topped by a 16-valve cylinder head that will equip the R19 16S. This engine F7P 140 bhp also equip the Clio 16S in February 1991, replacing the Super 5 GT Turbo. In July 1992, the Clio 16S and 16S R19 are fitted as standard with a catalytic converter, in order to comply with pollution standards applicable to 1 January 1993, which makes them lose 3 c.|$|E
50|$|Thereafter, the F8M {{was also}} used in the Renault 5 Express (Rapid / Extra), and the Volvo 300 series. The F2N was {{installed}} in the Renault 21, Renault 5, Renault 19, Renault Clio, Volvo 340/360 and also the Volvo 400 series (designated B18KP by Volvo). A version with a single-barrel carburetor was installed in some early Renault Trafic models and some R21, called the F1N. The 1721 cc petrol version was also built with <b>multipoint</b> <b>injection</b> as the F3N. This was fitted to the U.S. versions of the Renault 9 and Renault 11 (Renault Alliance and Encore), {{as well as to}} GTE models of the Renault 5 and 11 sold in some countries such as Switzerland and Germany - as the old carburetted Cleon-Fonté turbo engines no longer met the pollution standards in these countries.|$|E

5000|$|For 1997, new {{standards}} pollution should be applied. Renault {{could have kept}} his Cléon-Fonte 1.2 on the Twingo and its Energy engine 1.2 on the Clio, applying changes to its engines, including equipping each <b>multipoint</b> <b>injections,</b> but rather than investing fees studies on two different engines and before the unexpected success of Twingo, it is preferable to opt for a new engine that could both be mounted on the Twingo as the Clio, hence {{the birth of the}} [...] "D Engine". This new engine will be produced D7F1 kind Douvrin by the [...] "Société Française de Mécanique".|$|R

5000|$|The straight-six's biggest {{limitation}} {{through the}} years was poor distribution of air-fuel mixture to the cylinders due to a sub-optimal intake manifold design. Cylinders one and six (on {{the ends of the}} engine), received the lowest ratio, with a higher percentage of air in the mixture, while the central ones tended to get a richer mixture, unbalancing the engine's stoichiometric efficiency. Basically, in order to ensure the outer cylinders received a high enough air/fuel ratio to avoid detonation, the carburetor had to be set to run overly rich, which wasted fuel) [...] This design flaw could easily be solved by installing a race intake manifold that sported two or three two-barrel carburetors, as in stock car racing. Only in 1994, with thearrival of <b>multipoint</b> <b>injection</b> in the Omega, was the engine's problem finally solved.|$|E
50|$|This {{uses the}} {{injection}} of gas into the fluid stream which reduces the fluid density and lowers the bottom hole pressure. As the gas rises the bubbles help {{to push the}} oil ahead. The degree of the effect depends on continuous or intermittent flow of the gas. The gas can be injected at a single point below the fluid or may be supplemented by <b>multipoint</b> <b>injection.</b> An intermitter at the surface controls {{the timing of the}} gas injection. The mechanisms are either pressure or fluid operated. They may be throttling valves or casing pressure operated valve.Fluid operated valves require a rise in tubing pressure to open and drop to close.A throttling pressure valve is opened by casing pressure build up and closed by casing pressure drop.Conventional gas lift valves are attached to gas lift mandrels and wire line retrievable gas lift valves which are set in side pocket mandrels.|$|E
5000|$|The first {{generation}} Picanto was revealed at the 2003 Frankfurt Motor Show.

40|$|International audienceStaged multi-injection combustors seem good {{candidates}} to face flame stabilization problems (combustion instabilities, flashback, flame extinction), encountered in lean premixed prevaporized (LPP) burners. Staging procedures enable fuel distribution control while <b>multipoint</b> <b>injection</b> {{can lead to}} a fast and efficient mixing. In the present study, a laboratory-scale staged multipoint combustor is characterized using High Speed Particle Image Velocimetry and Planar Laser Induced Fluorescence measurements. It is shown that the fuel distribution strongly affects the flame stabilization processes, modifying the thermo-acoustic coupling. Furthermore, results reveal the presence of a precessing vortex core (PVC), that {{can lead to a}} better flame stabilization in particular cases...|$|E
40|$|This article {{presents}} an {{experimental study of}} self-sustained instabilities of an ensemble of premixed flames anchored on perforated plates. A theoretical analysis based on experimental results is developed in order to model the acoustic-flame coupling. In the unconfined configuration envisaged in this study, the coupling occurs with the upstream cavity. Experiments carried out on this <b>multipoint</b> <b>injection</b> configuration concern the acoustic response {{of the system and}} the influence of the perforated plate impedance, the emission of sound by the flames and the combustion transfer function. The thickness of the perforated plate is an important parameter that modifies the resonant frequencies and the ranges of instability. Instability bands determined by the model are in good agreement with experimental data, providing a suitable explanation of the mode hopping process characterizing such configurations.
