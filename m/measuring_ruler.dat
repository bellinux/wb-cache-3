The idea was dismissed when the source for the storyline changed, and Disney {{did not want to}} make a sequel out of an otherwise unrelated film. Cruella returned in 101 Dalmatians II: Patch's London Adventure once again as the main antagonist, where she was voiced by Susanne Blakeslee. Blakeslee also voiced Cruella in Disney's House of Mouse, which featured a running gag in which she inspects dogs from other Disney films with a <b>measuring</b> <b>ruler.</b> She also appeared in Mickey's House of Villains.

40|$|Abstract—In {{this paper}} an {{automated}} snow-cover measuring system is developed, which analyzes the visual image of drifted snow and measures {{the height of}} snow-cover. The system consists of a <b>measuring</b> <b>ruler,</b> a CCD camera (including infra-red module), and a PC which executes image processing, logs data and transfer the information to remotely located users via internet. The snow-depth is estimated based on {{the position of the}} lowest uncovered marker on the ruler which is estimated from the captured image. The distortion in the captured image is calibrated by an expansive coefficient curve and the calibrated image is compared to a virtual measuring scale (VMS) for the accurate measurement. To detect the boundary of the snow-cover the seed region growing (SRG) algorithm is used. To enhance the visual measurement process, the captured images are pre-processed and the camera is calibrated for various weather conditions. The measurement system can also transfer the raw images as well as the estimated snow-depth in real-time to a remotely located client through internet. Experimental results show that the system improves the reliability and the accuracy in measurement as well as the convenience.

The {{purpose of this paper}} is to investigate the laser’s potential to combine the advantages of lidar and FMCW radar for autonomous systems. Linewidth measurements were done by using a Mach-Zehnder interferometer to set up a delayed self-homodyne measurement. The laser was set to output at a fixed wavelength across a range of 1523 to 1566 nm in 1 nm increments, and linewidth was captured each of these increments. For each of the linewidths, coherence time and length along with laser currents were associated. The minimum linewidth found in this test was found to be 50 MHz, leading to a maximum coherence time of 6. 366 ns and a maximum coherence length of 129. 92 cm. There was a somewhat linear, albeit low correlation, area of low linewidths depending on the front mirror and back mirror currents across the wavelength range. Initial ranging experiments were performed using interference fringes caused by variable stationary path length differences introduced into a homemade Mach-Zehnder interferometer around the coherence lengths found in the linewidth test. The experimental path length differences indicated by the interference fringes seem to be accurate at very small <b>ruler</b> <b>measured</b> path length differences, but starts to stray away from the <b>ruler</b> <b>measured</b> as the path length differences get larger. Data taken suggests that there is a mathematical relationship in the error between the <b>ruler</b> <b>measured</b> and experimental path length differences leading to the belief that this error can be compensated for.
