5|$|Hygrophoropsis aurantiaca {{has been}} {{confused}} with the true chanterelles (genus Cantharellus) because of overall similarities in appearance. However, the forked gills, frequently off-centre stipe placement, and dextrinoid spores of H.aurantiaca suggested a relationship with Paxillus, prompting Rolf Singer to classify the genus Hygrophoropsis in the family Paxillaceae in 1946. Several pigments have been identified from the fungus, including the orange variegatic acid, <b>methyl</b> variegate, the <b>red</b> variegatorubin, and several derivatives of pulvinic acid. The presence of these pigments suggests a chemotaxic relationship with the Boletaceae, Coniophoraceae, and Paxillaceae—families of Boletales with members that have similar compounds. Molecular phylogenetic analysis confirmed its affinity lay in the order Boletales in 1997, though later research showed it is not closely related to Paxillus or other gilled members of the order.|$|R

30|$|In this study, Pt 3 Ni {{microspheres}} {{consisted of}} nanoparticles were synthesized without addition of surfactants via the solvothermal route. The obtained sample {{was characterized by}} X-ray diffraction (XRD), inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectrometer (ICP-AES), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM). Furthermore, the catalytic performance of as-synthesized Pt 3 Ni microspheres was evaluated {{on the degradation of}} different organic dyes (methylene blue, <b>methyl</b> orange, Congo <b>red,</b> and rhodamine B). The results show that different dyes were rapidly decomposed by Pt 3 Ni microspheres in different pathways. Among different dyes, the formation and further degradation of the intermediates was observed during the degradation of methylene blue and methyl orange, suggesting the indirect degradation process of these dyes. This study provides not only a promising catalyst for the removal of organic contaminants for environment remediation, but also new insights for Pt 3 Ni alloy as a high-performance catalyst in organic synthesis.|$|R

30|$|The {{fermentation}} {{system of}} mixed ruminal bacteria {{is capable of}} generating large amounts of short-chain volatile fatty acids (VFA) via the carboxylate platform in vitro. These VFAs are subject to elongation to larger, more energy-dense products through reverse β-oxidation, and the resulting products are useful as precursors for liquid fuels production. This study examined the effect of several redox mediators (neutral <b>red,</b> <b>methyl</b> viologen, safranin O, tannic acid) as alternative electron carriers for mixed ruminal bacteria during the fermentation of biomass (ground switchgrass not subjected to other pretreatments) and their potential to enhance elongation of end-products to medium-chain VFAs with no additional run-time. Neutral red (1  mM) in particular facilitated chain elongation, increasing average VFA chain length from 2.42 to 2.97 carbon atoms per molecule, while simultaneously inhibiting methane accumulation by over half yet maintaining total C in end products. The ability of redox dyes to act as alternative electron carriers suggests that ruminal fermentation is inherently manipulable toward retaining a higher fraction of substrate {{energy in the form}} of VFA.|$|R

And it is found that these LPT hierarchical microspheres have a certain extent of absorption in the visible region, showing a yellow colour. The changes of such special LPT nanostructures in interlayer spacing and colour should be attributed to the intercalation of NH 4 + or other amino-derivatives generated by the decomposition of HMTA.
