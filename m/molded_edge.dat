40|$|Owing {{to their}} {{extraordinary}} ability to interacting with external stimuli {{as well as}} their versatile functionalities hardly observed in bulk systems, micro- and nano-scale materials, structures, and phenomena {{have been the subject of}} increasing interest from both academia and industry. Many diverse fields including optoelectronics, photonics, bioengineering, and energy conversion have all shown significant increases in utilization of, and need for, micro/nano-scale features. To meet this demand scalable, practical, and efficient methodologies for small-scale manufacturing are called for. This thesis work addresses these issues while focusing on three main topics: (1) how micro/nano-scale structures and materials can be integrated into hybrid assemblies that can combine their complementary functionalities and extend applicability; (2) how these functional nanoarchitectures can be engineered in a continuous and scalable manner to increase the manufacturing throughput; and (3) how those two approaches can be coupled to the scalable buildups of functioncal nanoarchitectures to facilitate practical applications ranging from energy converters to optoelectronics/photonics. More specifically, a 3 D-hierarchical hybrid assembly of functional zinc oxide nanowires (ZNWs) and electrically addressable carbon nanotubes (CNTs) is developed and its application to photoelectric energy conversion is investigated. A series of continuous and scalable nanomanufacturing technologies follow, realizing high-speed (up to 1 m/min) patterning of small-scale features down to sub- 100 nm resolution; Roll-to-Roll (R 2 R) process enables the continuous fabrication of large-area replica of desired pattern by continuously rolling the flexible master mold containing the counter-profiled pattern; NanoChannel-guided Lithography (NCL) can continuously create seamless and high aspect-ratio nanogratings by dynamically inscribing the cleaved grating <b>mold</b> <b>edge</b> at a tilted angle over the liquid resist-coated surface; finally, Vibrational Indentation-driven Patterning (VIP) accomplishes a template-free fabrication of micro/nano-scale gratings via the high-frequency periodic indenting of a ‘flat’ tool edge. The integrative scaling-up of functional nanodevices is then further implemented in two ways; first, the ZNW/CNT hybrids are processed into scalable thin film photodetectors via roll-processing, achieving rapid photoresponse (35 %); second, Photo Roll Lithography (PRL) is developed by combining conventional photolithography and continuous rolling, which realizes high-throughput fabrication of geometrically-tunable sub-micron patterns for transparent electrodes and plasmonic IR filters...|$|R
50|$|Oliver began {{experimenting with}} {{improved}} field plow. Farm plows {{of the time}} were pulled by a draft animal as the farmer walked behind. There were many common problems with the plows: muddy ground could cause soil to become stuck on the upper edges of plow requiring the farmer to stop and clean the plow before continuing. When large stones were hit a certain speed, they could cause the plows to break or dent them enough to make them unusable. Oliver's designs sought to resolve both of these issues. He created a <b>molded</b> top <b>edge</b> for the plows allowing it to more easily shed mud away and preventing it from lodging in harness. He also developed a method of casting the plows in a sand mold which rapidly cooled the outer surface of the metal, causing it to be more significantly hardened, while allowing the center to cool slowly, preventing the plow from becoming brittle. The resulting plow was significantly stronger, retained its cutting edge much longer, and required less cleaning during plowing.|$|R

40|$|A {{conventional}} replication master made of photoresist for microchannel fabrication {{does not}} have reproducibility for the repeated replica molding, high temperature and high pressure processes. This paper presents how to fabricate cylindrical microfluidic channels easily, cheaply, and endurably by electroplating process. A hemispherical surface, instead of a rectangular surface, is achieved on an extremely thin metal seed layer by moldless electroplating. Without <b>mold,</b> exposed <b>edges</b> have abnormal growth rate and bad adhesion caused by high current density. However, with reduced thickness of the seed layer, the edge effect, converging electric field at the edge point, becomes negligible. A 5 -μm wide gold strip was patterned on a glass wafer as seed layers. After the copper electroplating, a long and semicircular pole grew on the wafer. This copper protrusion played a role for the channel when poly(dimethylsiloxane) was poured. A depressed piece and a flat one built up a semicircular channel. Simulation {{results show that the}} tendency for metal to be semi-circle strongly depends on the aspect ratio of seed layers. Reversed connections to the power supply resolved copper into ions, which resulted in a dwindling of the radius of the copper pole when electroplating. Based on this fact, various diameters of channels were made by an electroplated replication master on a single wafer. clos...|$|R

50|$|In 1962,Tony Sr.'s son, Tony Jr., {{joined the}} company. Coming {{out of the}} Aircraft {{industry}} and familiar with industrial plastics, he pioneered the use {{of some of the}} plastics still used in modern picks. A Dupont acetal polymer, Delrin was introduced as the D'Andrea Delrex line. A colorful sheet plastic, it had some of the tonal qualities of celluloid, excellent endurance, but could not be colored in shell patterns. As a sheet plastic however, it could easily be produced in many shapes. Today, D'Andrea offers it in seven shapes and six gauges. The same material is also able to be molded. So Tony Jr. developed uniquely designed molds to accommodate the needs of the faster paced music of the Rock revolution. His molds had innovative sharply beveled edges to provide fast release with clearer tone. Those molds are used to produce the three Delrin lines: Jetex with a multi-leveled gripping surface, and the Brites and Pro-Grip Brites lines with Fluorescent pigmented colors. A new stronger Nylon formula was also developed and used in these sharp <b>edged</b> <b>molds.</b>|$|R

25|$|The communion {{table is}} the oldest {{in the state and}} is of {{undoubtedly}} an original feature of this church. It is a walnut table with dimension of 65 inches × 30”. It has baluster-like, robust legs and a bottom rail on all four sides. The <b>molding</b> of the <b>edge</b> of the upper rail is a reversed S (cyma reversa). Reportedly it was used as a chopping block by an American patrol during the War of 1812, and it shows a documented disregard of the sacerdotal nature of communion tables in early American churches cited by Upton as including: use as a desk for in-church schools, use as a hat table, instances of their being “pushed around carelessly,” going so far that stray dogs stole the communion bread and even urinated on the table legs. Hence, regulations were passed that the table in each church must be located on the east wall and that a protective rail be erected around it. The use of any church as a school, in particular, is puzzling because most colonial vestries scrupulously avoided using the church even for parish business, meeting in a separate vestry house close by a church or in the room formed by bell towers such as at St. Peter’s, New Kent County. The vestry house for this church remained as a ruin just outside the west wall until 1820.|$|R
40|$|The use {{of active}} flow control (AFC) on civil {{transport}} aircraft flaps can delay stall at low aircraft speeds. This {{can lead to}} reducing the size of flaps or removing them from aircraft, which can reduce the part count, weight, and manufacturing cost of the aircraft. In addition to these changes, the cruise drag can also be reduced, which leads to lower fuel burn, hence lower costs and emissions. This technology works by energizing the boundary layer using an AFC device, a fluidic oscillator (FO) in this thesis, to prevent flow separation. However, the effects of material, manufacturing process, and dimensional variation on these parts is not entirely known. In this work, the key performance characteristics, {{also referred to as}} the functional requirements of the FO, were identified to be the coefficient of momentum and the oscillation frequency. The operational requirements of the FO were identified to be the fluidic power requirement and the ability to withstand pressure, significant temperature variations, and fluctuations in humidity. The materials that are explored include aluminum and carbon fiber PEKK. The manufacturing processes that were explored include machining, selective laser sintering (SLS), stereolithography (SLA), and injection molding. Variations in the dimensions were explored: nozzle width, nozzle length, nozzle radius, nozzle symmetry, nozzle curvature, and interaction chamber width. These were tested using a bench test setup. It was concluded that material had no impact on the performance of the FO, given stiff enough materials and those that can be manufactured to the required tolerances. The manufacturing process did affect the performance of the FO as it caused changes in the geometry of the FO. The changes included the inability of SLS, SLA, and injection <b>molding</b> to produces <b>edges</b> as sharp as can be produced by machining. As a result, the devices had lower pressure drops and higher oscillation frequencies, which are beneficial. It was also identified that nozzle width, shoulder width, and nozzle radius affected the oscillation frequency and that the nozzle width and nozzle radius affected the pressure drop. Nozzle symmetry and nozzle length did not affect the oscillation frequency and pressure drop; however, they did affect the jet profile. Lastly, the nozzle curvature did not have any effect on the performance of the FO. Additionally, {{the point at which the}} performance of the FO deviates from the model was identified, which corresponds to where the oscillation frequency is no longer dependent on the flow rate. Using this information, a dimensionless model was developed that can be used by FO designers to predict the pressure drop and oscillation frequency of the FO based on the dimensions of the FO. M.

40|$|Local Name: YeşilköyLocal Informant: Osman YusmakLocal Information: Preservation: While nothing {{remains of}} the bridge on the north (right) bank of the gorge except {{weathered}} mortared rubble and scattered facing blocks, the remains on the south (left) bank are better preserved. These include {{a portion of the}} arch of the lower tier of the bridge, {{remains of the}} upper tier and buttress, and traces of the conduit. The downstream (west) side of the bridge is better preserved than the upstream side. Fallen voussoirs and large masses of masonry litter the streambed below. ** Construction: The bridge is constructed of mortared rubble faced with petit appareil masonry. The facing blocks and the upper voussoirs of the arch are fashioned from sandy conglomerate rock, while the lower voussoirs are carved from marble. The facing blocks are approximately 0. 5 m long and 0. 3 m high, while the voussoirs are 0. 50 m long, 0. 30 m wide, and 0. 40 – 1 m deep. Three types of mortar are visible. Ubiquitous is a white lime mortar with stone inclusions no larger than 0. 005 m. Also visible around the crumbling mass of the upper north pier is a light gray lime mortar with larger stone inclusions up to 0. 01 m in size. A third type of lime mortar {{can be found on the}} buttressed middle mass on the south bank; it has a very loose, pinkish tan matrix with stone inclusions as large as 0. 02 m. ** Description: The remains of the bridge suggest that it was originally two-tiered, with a lower arch spanning 13 m and supporting possibly four arches above, each spanning 5. 7 m, topped by the conduit. The bridge is preserved to a height of 17 m, a width of 3 m, and a length of 65 m. Traces of the conduit indicate that it was originally 65 m long and 27 m high. The single arch of the lower tier springs from the bedrock of the steep south (left) bank of the gorge at a height of 10 m above the bottom of the gorge. The tier is preserved to a height of 5. 5 m. The arch is constructed of two layers of voussoirs. The fallen marble blocks used as voussoirs are variously dressed with anathyrosis, clamp cuttings, lifting bosses, and moldings. The second tier of the bridge begins approximately 4. 5 m above the remains of the lower tier. A buttressing structure joins the downstream (west) side of the second tier in a clear seam. Approximately 1 m above the upper tier, the side walls of the conduit are visible. Latitude: 37. 36. 46. 285 Longitude: 28. 51. 02. 578 Elevation: 831 Axis: N-SDimensions: p. H: 17 m ** p.

W (south pier buttress) : 1. 5 mDescription: The remains of the aqueduct bridge indicate that the structure was constructed in two stories of arches in order to maintain the channel elevation across a deep gorge below. On the south bank of the gorge, one segment of the arch (5. 5 m. high) springs from the bedrock of the steep hillside, 10 m. above the bottom of the gorge. Only a mortared rubble mass remains of the corresponding pier on the north bank, with no trace of the arch. Approximately 4. 5 m. above the arched pier segment on the north bank, another mortared rubble mass is built into the hillside and suggests the use of a second story of arches, none of which now remain. A corresponding section of mortared rubble lies on the north bank. Some kind of buttress or support is built against the west (downstream) side of the remains of the higher story, with a clear seam delineating the two masonry structures. The east (upstream) side of both remaining segments of on the south bank is heavily eroded with lots of missing material and no preserved facing blocks. The buttress on the downstream side must have been built in consideration of the forces such as wind that could potentially jeopardize the stability of the tall structure. The side walls of the aqueduct channel are preserved on the south bank, approximately 1 m. above the preserved level of the second story. The top of the rubble mass on the north bank is at roughly the same elevation as the channel on the south bank, but no traces of the channel are visible here, perhaps due to the construction of a road in this area. ** The few facing blocks of the bridge that remain in situ are located on the west side of the south pier. The blocks are approximately 0. 5 m. long and 0. 3 m. high and face a mortared rubble core of unworked stones 0. 10 -. 50 m. long. The facing stones appear to be worked from the conglomeratic sandstone bedrock on site, while the rubble core includes stones of various types locally available. Three kinds of mortar are visible in the remaining sections of the structure. Most ubiquitous is a white lime-based mortar with stone inclusions not larger than 5 mm. Also visible around the crumbling mass of the upper north pier is a light gray lime-based mortar with larger stone inclusions, up to 10 mm. A third type of mortar can be found on the buttressed middle mass on the south bank: a very loose pinkish tan matrix with stone inclusions as large as 20 mm. ** The arch is constructed of two levels of voussoirs, the top level carved from the conglomeratic sandstone bedrock and the bottom of marble. Of the nine remaining courses of the lower level of voussoirs, only seven have preserved facing blocks. Three to four voussoirs are preserved in each course, and each is missing at least one more. The voussoir blocks are 0. 50 m. long, 0. 30 m. wide, and 0. 40 - 1 m. deep. The voussoir blocks seem to be the same width at the extrados and intrados, suggesting that the arch had a considerable span of c. 13 m. A large chunk of mortared rubble, 2. 40 m. by 2. 70 m., and many single marble blocks litter the stream bed below the structure and for at least 20 m. downstream along the gorge. Many of these fallen marble blocks, which were likely used as voussoirs, are worked in ways that suggest they were originally intended for another purpose. One block, located on the gorge bottom only about a meter downstream from the bridge, is dressed with anathyrosis on one side, two holes on an adjacent side, and a cutting for a butterfly clamp in a recessed corner. Another marble block has a lifting boss and <b>molding</b> along its <b>edges.</b> ** Based on these standing remains, the bridge has been theoretically reconstructed with a lower arch spanning the gorge across 13 m., topped by a second story of four arches, centered on the lower arch and each spanning 5. 75 m. Attempt has not been made to reconstruct the buttressing structure on the downstream (west) side of the bridge...|$|R
