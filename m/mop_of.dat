5|$|The eponymous {{protagonist of}} the series is Septimus Heap. As the seventh son of a seventh son, the aptly named Septimus has {{exceptional}} magical powers. He shares his birthday with Jenna, his adoptive sister, but is presumed dead at birth by his family. For most of the first novel he appears as Boy 412, a child from the Young Army, where he has spent the first ten {{years of his life}} after DomDaniel attempted to abduct him. Thereafter he is apprentice to the ExtraOrdinary Wizard Marcia Overstrand. He has a <b>mop</b> <b>of</b> curly hair, wears green apprentice robes and has a Dragon Ring on his right hand. In the second novel, he acquires a dragon called Spit Fyre as a pet. According to a review in the Manila Standard Today, the contrast between the caution he has learned from an early age and his longing for the love and affection of a family makes him an intriguing character.|$|E
25|$|North Carolina {{was playing}} looking for its 4th National Championship while Illinois {{was playing in}} its first National Championship. It was a tight contest {{for much of the}} first half before an 8-0 run by North Carolina allowed them to take a 35-25 lead. Eventually they would take a 40-27 lead into halftime. North Carolina {{increased}} its lead to 15 {{at one point in the}} second half. But Illinois began a furious charge. At one point, they would hit seven consecutive shots from the floor to turn a fifteen-point lead back to four. Unfazed, North Carolina would push the lead back up to ten before a 10-0 run by the Illini tied the game at 65-65. Illinois would tie the game at 70-70 on a three by Luther Head. But North Carolina would fight back as freshman Marvin Williams tapped back a Rashad McCants missed shot to put North Carolina back in front. Illinois would get several cracks to take the lead but were unable to convert. Eventually, Raymond Felton was able to steal the ball from Head forcing Deron Williams to foul. However, Felton converted on 1 of 2 free throws giving Illinois one last chance. But Luther Head's three pointer bounced high and out. Eventually it went into the hands of Felton who this time connected on both free throws to give North Carolina a 75-70 victory. For North Carolina head coach Roy Williams, it was his first national championship. Illinois was denied a chance to set the NCAA record for most wins in a season, instead tying it at 37. Sean May scored 26 points as he took the <b>MOP</b> <b>of</b> the Final Four.|$|E

Fleming named the character after two of his American friends: [...] "Felix" [...] was Ivar Bryce's middle name, whilst Tommy Leiter was a mutual friend. Academic Kerstin Jütting describes Leiter as [...] "a cool and quiet no-nonsense character who knows 007's strengths and weaknesses well".

500|$|Miller's {{later life}} {{was plagued by}} ill health. In November 1991, he was hospitalised with a stroke, and soon after fell over and broke his hip, necessitating two further operations. He had skin cancer, caused by his insistence on always {{displaying}} his <b>mop</b> <b>of</b> hair and not wearing a hat. He accepted these vicissitudes equably. [...] "Some grieved to see him reduced, but not him; these were life's deliveries. He knew only that one would get him out eventually." [...] He had an earlobe removed. The cancer also attacked his legs, and coupled with his hip injury, severely curtailed his mobility, forcing him to use walking frames and wheelchairs. Asked at 75 about death, he said: [...] "Never think about it. No regrets. I've had {{a hell of a}} good life. Been damned lucky." ...|$|E
500|$|... "(Anesthesia) - Pulling Teeth" [...] is a bass solo by Burton, {{accompanied}} on drums by Ulrich. A {{staple of}} Burton's live performances since {{his high school}} days in the band Agents of Misfortune, the instrumental track featured Burton's distinctive [...] "lead-bass" [...] style of playing, incorporating heavy distortion, use of wah-wah pedal and tapping. Bubacz introduces the track as [...] "Bass solo, take one", informing listeners that the song was recorded in one take. [...] "(Anesthesia) - Pulling Teeth" [...] was the bass solo that Burton was playing when Hetfield and Ulrich first saw him at a gig. Hetfield stated: [...] "We heard this wild solo going on and thought, 'I don't see any guitar player up there.' We were both counting the strings and I finally turned to Lars and said, 'Dude, that's a bass!' Cliff was up there on stage with his band Trauma with a wah-wah pedal and his huge <b>mop</b> <b>of</b> red hair. He didn't care whether people were there. He was {{looking down at his}} bass, playing." [...] "Whiplash" [...] was the album's first single, issued on August 8, 1983. It features a swift rhythm line of straight 16th notes played at about 200 beats per minute. Hetfield and Burton performed with palm muted technique and precise metronomic control. The lyrics celebrate crowd energy and headbanging. Rock journalist Mick Wall wrote that [...] "Whiplash" [...] signified the birth of thrash metal, stating: [...] "If one wishes to identify the very moment thrash metal arrived spitting and snarling into the world, 'Whiplash' is indisputably it." ...|$|E

40|$|AbstractWe discuss {{two issues}} in using {{mixtures}} <b>of</b> polynomials (<b>MOPs)</b> for inference in hybrid Bayesian networks. MOPs were proposed by Shenoy and West for mitigating {{the problem of}} integration in inference in hybrid Bayesian networks. First, in defining MOP for multi-dimensional functions, one requirement is that the pieces where the polynomials are defined are hypercubes. In this paper, we discuss relaxing this condition so that each piece is defined on regions called hyper-rhombuses. This relaxation means that MOPs are closed under transformations required for multi-dimensional linear deterministic conditionals, such as Z=X+Y, etc. Also, this relaxation allows us to construct <b>MOP</b> approximations <b>of</b> the probability density functions (PDFs) of the multi-dimensional conditional linear Gaussian distributions using a <b>MOP</b> approximation <b>of</b> the PDF of the univariate standard normal distribution. Second, Shenoy and West suggest using the Taylor series expansion of differentiable functions for finding <b>MOP</b> approximations <b>of</b> PDFs. In this paper, we describe a new method for finding MOP approximations based on Lagrange interpolating polynomials (LIP) with Chebyshev points. We describe how the LIP method {{can be used to}} find efficient <b>MOP</b> approximations <b>of</b> PDFs. We illustrate our methods using conditional linear Gaussian PDFs in one, two, and three dimensions, and conditional log-normal PDFs in one and two dimensions. We compare the efficiencies of the hyper-rhombus condition with the hypercube condition. Also, we compare the LIP method with the Taylor series method...|$|R
