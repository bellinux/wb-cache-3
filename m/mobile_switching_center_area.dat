50|$|A {{public land}} mobile network {{may be defined}} as a number of <b>mobile</b> {{services}} <b>switching</b> <b>center</b> <b>areas</b> within a common numbering plan and a common routing plan. With respect to their functions, the PLMNs may be regarded as independent communications entities, even though different PLMNs may be interconnected through the PSTN/ISDN for the forwarding of calls or network information. The MSCs of a PLMN can be interconnected similarly to allow interaction. A PLMN may have several interfaces with the fixed network (e.g., one for each MSC). Inter-working between two PLMNs may be performed via an international <b>switching</b> <b>center.</b> The PLMN is connected via an NCP to the PSTN/ISDN. If there are two mobile service suppliers in the same country, they can be connected through the same PSTN/ISDN.|$|R

40|$|In {{the world}} of {{cellular}} telephony there is a hierarchy of controlling devices. Cellular telephones communicate with Base Transceiver Satations (BTS) or transceivers, which is turn are assigned to Base Station Controllers (BSC) or controllers. All controllers are connected to a <b>Mobile</b> <b>Switching</b> <b>Centers</b> (MSC). As a user of a cellular telephone moves around, the call must be transfered from transceiver to transceiver, and sometimes from controller to controller. We {{are interested in the}} problem of minimizing the cost of these transfers from controller to controller. In the above hierarchy, we consider a subtree emanating from one <b>Mobile</b> <b>Switching</b> <b>Center.</b> The two sets corresponding to the subtree are I, the set of transceivers, and J, the set of controllers.

40|$|Sponsoring {{organization}} Title and subtitle Sequential Paging for Moving Mobile Users. In this thesis, some {{methods for}} efficient paging for mobile {{systems have been}} investigated. Compared to the conventional method, the methods proposed here increase the mobile stations discovery rate while decreasing the signaling load between the <b>mobile</b> <b>switching</b> <b>centers</b> and the <b>mobile</b> stations. As the cell sizes shrinks, {{the probability that the}} mobile stations moves between the cells during the paging process gets higher. These methods takes this probability into consideration and are based on the case when the movement between the cells are described as a Markov model. One of the algorithms is called the pqup-algorithm. This method works well under both heavy traffic and light traffic. The main method is the POMDP-algorithm. A POMDP is a generalisation of a Markov decision process that allows for incomplete information regarding the state of the system. The POMDP-algorithm does not quite work yet and the method is going to be investigated further. The results so far is presented in this thesis. The methods are fully compatible with current cellular networks and requires small amount of computational power in the <b>mobile</b> <b>switching</b> <b>centers.</b> Keywords Classification system and/or index terms (if any) Supplementary bibliographical information ISSN and key titl...|$|R

Furthermore, our results show that priority assignment schemes may significantly affect the operator’s revenue. Index Terms—Prepaid call, priority call, service node. I...|$|R
