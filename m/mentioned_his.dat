5|$|During Milhail Kogălniceanu's lifetime, {{there was}} {{confusion}} regarding his exact birth year, with several sources erroneously indicating it as 1806; {{in his speech}} to the Romanian Academy, he acknowledged this, and gave his exact birth date as present in a register kept by his father. It was also then that he <b>mentioned</b> <b>his</b> godmother was Marghioala Calimach, a Callimachi boyaress who married into the Sturdza family, and {{was the mother of}} Mihail Sturdza (Kogălniceanu's would-be protector and foe).|$|E

5|$|McGovern's wartime {{story was}} at the center of Ambrose's 2001 best-selling profile of the men who flew B‑24s over Germany in World WarII, The Wild Blue. It was the first time much of the public became {{familiar}} with that part of his life; throughout his political career, McGovern had rarely <b>mentioned</b> <b>his</b> war service or the medals he had won.|$|E
5|$|During {{his watch}} one night while the crew were camped on the ice, {{a small part}} of the ice floe broke away and he was only rescued due to the quick {{intervention}} of the men of the next watch who threw him a line allowing him to jump back to safety. Shackleton reported that McNish calmly <b>mentioned</b> <b>his</b> narrow escape the next day after further cracks appeared in the ice. Mrs. Chippy, the cat McNish had brought on board, had to be shot after the loss of the Endurance, as it was obvious he would not survive the harsh conditions. McNish apparently never forgave Shackleton for giving the order.|$|E
5|$|During {{the night}} of 26 September 2016, Pascu's wife called the {{emergency}} number (112) twice. The first time the artist complained about a panic attack and a 3 days lasting insomnia. The ambulance doctor reported that the patient didn't mention previous illness history (namely his previous stroke), he only <b>mentioned</b> <b>his</b> diabetes and his knee pain that prevented him from sleep. Pascu refused hospitalization. His only request was to be administrated something {{in order to get}} some sleep, and the doctor gave him Diazepam. A second call followed a couple of hours later; this time Pascu was unconscious. Doctors tried to resuscitate, but to no avail. It was determined that Pascu died due to a heart attack.|$|E

"Rudradama's inscription, {{written in}} Brahmi script, was the {{earliest}} record ever written in perfect Sanskrit....As mentioned before, Rudradama did not <b>mention</b> <b>his</b> religious {{affiliation with the}} Buddhist Sangha, perhaps because the House of Chastana had been affiliated with the Jaina religion for generations.

5|$|Knox's {{death was}} barely noticed at the time. Although his funeral was {{attended}} by the nobles of Scotland, no major politician or diplomat <b>mentioned</b> <b>his</b> death in their letters that survive. Mary, Queen of Scots made only two brief references to him in her letters. However, what the rulers feared were Knox's ideas more than Knox himself. He was a ruthless and successful revolutionary {{and it was this}} revolutionary philosophy that had a great impact on the English Puritans. Despite his strictness and dogmatism, he has also been described by partisans as contributing to the struggle for genuine human freedom, by teaching a duty to oppose unjust government in order to bring about moral and spiritual change.|$|E
5|$|Döblin {{completed}} work on November 1918 in {{the spring}} of 1943, but was unable to find a publisher. The only work of his that was published in German during his American exile was a private printing of 250 copies of the Nocturno episode from November 1918. Döblin was embittered by his isolation and setbacks in exile, drawing a strong distinction between his own situation and that of more successful writers less oppressed by material concerns, such as Lion Feuchtwanger and Thomas Mann. In honor of his 65th birthday, Helene Weigel organized a party on 14 August 1943 in Santa Monica. In attendance were Thomas Mann, Franz Werfel, Lion Feuchtwanger, and Bertolt Brecht, among others. Heinrich Mann gave a speech, Fritz Kortner, Peter Lorre, and Alexander Granach read aloud from Döblin's works, and he was presented with notes of congratulation and praise from Brecht, Max Horkheimer, and Alfred Polgar, among others. Compositions by Hanns Eisler were performed, and Blandine Ebinger sang Berlin chansons. Yet the festivities were dampened when Döblin gave a speech in which he <b>mentioned</b> <b>his</b> conversion to Catholicism; the religious, moral tone proved alienating, and fell on unsympathetic ears.|$|E
5|$|On June 9, Spivey {{was arrested}} in New York, and was {{released}} pending a trial, which started in January 1953. Hirsch testified that Spivey asked to be included as a point shaver, and was upset that the payment {{for his role in}} shaving during the 1950 Sugar Bowl game was less than he anticipated. This, however, contradicted his original grand jury testimony, which had no mention of Spivey's involvement. Hirsch also told the grand jury that Spivey and West, the ringleader, had not met. West declined to testify, leading to criminal contempt charges against him. Spivey again denied taking part in the scandal, stating that he had turned down a different gambler on two occasions. According to him, ex-teammate Jim Line <b>mentioned</b> <b>his</b> name to the grand jury; Spivey said he learned this from Line. The trial lasted for 13days before the case went to a jury. By a 9–3 margin, the majority of jurors supported acquittal for Spivey, and the hung jury caused a mistrial. The grand jury eventually dropped the charges against Spivey.|$|E
