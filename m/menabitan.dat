50|$|<b>Menabitan</b> (INN; SP-204), or <b>menabitan</b> {{hydrochloride}} (USAN), is {{a synthetic}} drug which {{acts as a}} potent cannabinoid receptor agonist. It {{is closely related to}} natural cannabinoids of the tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) group, differing mainly by its longer and branched side chain, and the replacement of the 9-position carbon with a nitrogen. It was studied as an analgesic in the 1970s and was found to possess antinociceptive effects in both humans and animals but was never marketed.|$|E
