40|$|AbstractMagainins {{and other}} {{antimicrobial}} peptides increase ion flux across the membrane. They may {{do this by}} forming some type of pore or by perturbing lipid organization due to peptide lying on the bilayer surface. In order to determine if <b>magainins</b> perturb the lipid sufficiently to permeabilize the bilayer, their effect on the motion of fatty acid and lipid spin labels in phosphatidylcholine/phosphatidylglycerol (PC/PG) lipid vesicles was determined. Their effect was compared to two synthetic peptides, 18 L and Ac- 18 A-NH 2, designed to mimic the naturally occurring classes of lytic (class L) and apolipoprotein (class A) amphipathic helices, respectively. We show that although <b>magainins</b> and 18 L both had significant effects on lipid chain order, much greater than Ac- 18 A-NH 2, there was no correlation between these effects and the relative ability of these three peptide classes to permeabilize PC/PG vesicles in the order magainins=Ac- 18 A-NH 2 ≫ 18 L. This suggests that the perturbing effects of <b>magainins</b> on lipid chain order at permeabilizing concentrations are not directly responsible for the increased leakage of vesicle contents. The greater ability of the <b>magainins</b> to permeabilize PC/PG vesicles relative to 18 L is thus more likely due to formation of some type of pore by <b>magainins.</b> The greater ability of Ac- 18 A-NH 2 relative to 18 L to permeabilize PC/PG vesicles despite its lack of disordering effect must be due to its ability to cause membrane fragmentation. Effects of these peptides on other lipids indicated that the mechanism by which they permeabilize lipid bilayers depends both on the peptide and on the lipid composition of the vesicles...|$|R

40|$|AbstractAnimals {{as well as}} plants defend {{themselves}} against invading pathogenic microorganisms utilizing cationic antimicrobial peptides, which rapidly kill various microbes without exerting toxicity against the host. Physicochemical peptide–lipid interactions provide attractive mechanisms for innate immunity. Many of these peptides form cationic amphipathic secondary structures, typically α-helices and β-sheets, which can selectively interact with anionic bacterial membranes by the aid of electrostatic interactions. Rapid, peptide-induced membrane permeabilization is an effective mechanism of antimicrobial action. This review article summarizes interactions with lipid bilayers of <b>magainins</b> (α-helix) and tachyplesins (β-sheet) discovered in frog skin and horseshoe crab hemolymph, respectively, as archetypes, emphasizing that the mode of interaction {{is strongly dependent on}} the physicochemical properties not only of the peptide, but also of the target membrane...|$|R

40|$|The world-wide transdermal drug {{delivery}} market is quite large, {{but only a}} small number of agents have FDA approval. The primary reason for such limited development is the difficulty in permeating the stratum corneum layer of human skin. In our study, we developed a novel percutaneous delivery enhancing approach. <b>Magainin</b> peptide was previously shown to disrupt vesicles from stratum corneum lipid components and this ability of <b>magainin</b> allows us to propose that <b>magainin</b> can increase skin permeability. Therefore, we tested the hypothesis that <b>magainin,</b> a pore-forming peptide, can increase skin permeability by disrupting stratum corneum lipid structure and that magainin¡¯s enhancement requires co-administration of a surfactant chemical enhancer to increase <b>magainin</b> penetration into the skin. In support of these hypotheses, synergistic enhancement of transdermal permeation can be observed with <b>magainin</b> peptide in combination of N-lauroyl sarcosine (NLS) in 50 % ethanol-PBS solution. The exposure to NLS in 50 % ethanol solution increased in vitro skin permeability to fluorescein 15 fold and the addition of <b>magainin</b> synergistically increased skin permeability 47 fold. In contrast, skin permeability was unaffected by exposure to <b>magainin</b> without co-enhancement by NLS-ethanol. To elucidate the mechanism of this synergistic effect, several characterization methods such as differential scanning calorimetry, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and X-ray diffraction were applied. These analyses showed that NLS-ethanol disrupted stratum corneum lipid structure and that the combination of <b>magainin</b> and NLS-ethanol disrupted stratum corneum lipids even further. Furthermore, confocal microscopy showed that <b>magainin</b> in the presence of NLS-ethanol penetrated deeply and extensively into stratum corneum, whereas <b>magainin</b> alone penetrated poorly into the skin. Together, these data suggest that NLS-ethanol increased <b>magainin</b> penetration into stratum corneum, which further increased stratum corneum lipid disruption and skin permeability. Finally, skin permeability was enhanced by changing the charge of <b>magainin</b> peptide via pH change. We modulated pH from 5 to 11 to change the <b>magainin</b> charge from positive to neutral, which decreased skin permeability to a negatively charged fluorescein and increased skin permeability to a positively charged granisetron. This suggests that an attractive interaction between the drug and <b>magainin</b> peptide improves transdermal flux. Ph. D. Committee Chair: Mark R. Prausnitz; Committee Co-Chair: Peter J.

40|$|<b>Magainin</b> 2, a polycationic peptide, {{displays}} bactericidal and tumoricidal activity, presumably {{interacting with}} negatively charged phospholipids in the membrane hosts. In this work, we investigate {{the role played}} by the lipid head-group in the interactions and selfassociation of <b>magainin</b> 2 during pore formation in lipid bilayers. Two methods are used: single-channel and macroscopic incorporation into planar lipid membranes. Single-channel incorporation showed that <b>magainin</b> 2 did not interact with zwitterionic membranes, while the addition of negatively charged dioleoylphosphatidylglycerol to the membrane leads to channel formation. On the other hand, <b>magainin</b> 2 did not form channels in membranes made up of dioleoylphosphatidylserine (DOPS), although the addition of ergosterol to DOPS membranes leads to channel formation. This finding could indicate that ergosterol may be a possible target of <b>magainin</b> 2 in fungal membranes. Further support for this hypothesis comes from experiments in which the addition of ergosterol to palmitoyloleoylphosphatidylcholine membranes induced channel formation. Besides the role of negatively charged membranes, this study has shown that <b>magainin</b> 2 also forms channels in membranes lacking heads, such as monoolein and oxidized cholesterol, indicating an interaction of <b>magainin</b> 2 with acyl chains and cholesterol, respectively.
