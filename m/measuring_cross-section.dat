Although many experiments {{have been carried out}} especially in circular pipes, those in a noncircular duct are very limited. To {{contribute to the development of}} gas–liquid bubbly flow model for a noncircular duct, detail measurements for the air–water bubbly flow in a square duct (side length: 0. 136 m) were carried out by an X-type hot-film anemometry and a multi-sensor optical probe. Local flow parameters of the void fraction, bubble diameter, bubble frequency, axial liquid velocity and turbulent kinetic energy were measured in 11 two-phase flow conditions. These flow conditions covered bubbly flow with the area-averaged void fraction ranging from 0. 069 to 0. 172. A pronounced corner peak of the void fraction was observed in a quarter square area of a <b>measuring</b> <b>cross-section.</b> Due to a high bubble concentration in the corner, the maximum values of both axial liquid velocity and turbulent kinetic energy intensity were located in the corner region.

40|$|An {{important}} {{starting point}} for designing management improvements, particularly in irrigation areas, is to record the baseline state of the water resources, including the amount of discharge from canals. In this respect discharge measurements {{by means of the}} salt dilution method is a traditional and well-documented technique. However, this methodology can be strongly influenced by the natural streaming characteristics of the canal (e. g. laminar vs. turbulent flow) and accurate precautions must be considered in the choice of both the measuring section and the length of the measuring reach of the canal which can affect the plume shape. The knowledge of plume distribution in the <b>measuring</b> <b>cross-section</b> is of primary importance for a correct location of sampling points aimed in obtaining a reliable measurement. To obtain this, geophysical imaging of an NaCl plume from a slug-injection salt dilution test has been performed within this paper by means of cross-flow fast electric resistivity tomography (FERT) in a real case history. Direct sampling of the same plume has been also performed with a multisampling optimization technique to obtain an average value over the measuring section by means of contemporarily sampling water in nine points. Results show that a correct visualization of the passage of the salt plume is possible by means of geophysical controls and that this can potentially help in the correct location of sampling points...|$|E
40|$|Technical {{problems}} arise during {{measurement of the}} volume rates of flow in district heating systems when the desired measurement uncertainty is less than one percent. Solid-state laser Doppler velocimeters are able to assess the errors of measurement in conventional, built-in devices for measurement of volume rates of flow (working standard). The measuring system under review {{is based on a}} modified commercial solid-state laser Doppler velocimeter. The system is investigated and is optimized for minimum measuring uncertainties. The laser beams are injected into the fluid by means of a fit component with four large apertures for variable assembly which is mounted {{directly in front of the}} volumetric device in the pipe section. The suitability of the measuring system for precise measurement of the volume rates of flow under stationary flow conditions is determined in a hot-water test stand. Network measurements are made to assess the flow characteristics in the <b>measuring</b> <b>cross-section,</b> and systematic analyses are made to determine the measuring accuracies which can be achieved applying the conventional methods for measurement of volumetric flow in the case of little asymmetrical velocity distributions. Practical tests of the measuring techniques and measuring regimes are made under nonstationary flow conditions in the recirculation system of a district heating substation owned by Berliner Kraft- und Licht-Aktiengesellschaft. The deviations in the volume rates of flow determined by use of the solid-state laser Doppler velocimeter relative to the measured values obtained using a conventional measuring instrument are below the desired 1. 0 % uncertaintyAvailable from TIB Hannover: F 93 B 1308 / FIZ - Fachinformationszzentrum Karlsruhe / TIB - Technische InformationsbibliothekSIGLEBundesministerium fuer Forschung und Technologie (BMFT), Bonn (Germany) DEGerman...|$|E
40|$|The {{results of}} {{experimental}} studies of local hydrodynamics and mass exchange of coolant flow behind spacer and mixing grids of different structural versions that were developed for fuel assemblies of domestic and foreign nuclear reactors are presented in the article. In order {{to carry out the}} study the models of the following fuel assemblies have been fabricated: FA for VVER and VBER, FA-KVADRAT for PWR-reactor and FA for KLT- 40 C reactor. All the models have been fabricated with a full geometrical similarity with full-scale fuel assemblies. The study was carried out by simulating the flow of coolant in a core by air on an aerodynamic test rig. In order to measure local hydrodynamic characteristics of coolant flow five-channel Pitot probes were used that enable to measure the velocity vector in a point by its three components. The tracerpropane method was used for studying mass transfer processes. Flow hydrodynamics was studied by <b>measuring</b> <b>cross-section</b> velocities of coolant flow and coolant rates according to the model cells. The investigation of mass exchange processes consisted of a study of concentration distribution for tracer in experimental model, in determination of attenuation lengths of mass transfer processes behind mixing grids, in calculating of inter-cellar mass exchange coefficient. The database on coolant flow in fuel assemblies for different types of reactors had been accumulated that formed the basis of the engineering substantiation of reactor cores designs. The recommendations on choice of optimal versions of mixing grids have been taken into consideration by implementers of the JSC “OKBM Afrikantov” when creating commissioned fuel assemblies. The results of the study are used for verification of CFD-codes and CFD programs of detailed cell-by-cell calculation of reactor cores in order to decrease conservatism for substantiation of thermal-mechanical reliability. </p...|$|E
