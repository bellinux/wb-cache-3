40|$|The {{object of}} this study is {{determination}} of the relationship between airborne methylene diphenyl diisocyanate (MDI) and selective psychrometric variables. The production of MDI factories were polyurethane adhesives, paints and varnishes and the workers were exposed to MDI in the indoor air. The air samples were collected by <b>midget</b> <b>impinger</b> and multiple regressions model was used to determine the relationship between variables. All of the samplers (<b>midget</b> <b>impinger)</b> were connected to mini personal sampler pump fixed toworkstations near the source of pollution based on NIOSH method 5522. The first step in the analysis of a solution is derivatization of isocyanates for the separation through HPLC, for their qualitative as well as quantitative analysis. Air sampling and analysis was performed according to (NIOSH) method 5522 for diisocyanate in air. The results revealed that a correlation between MDI concentration and relative humidity, dry bulb temperature, altitude and dimension of polyurethane factories. Dimension of factories yields reasonable negative relationship, the MDI concentration was ranged from 93. 8 to 99 (μg/m 3) and statistically significant at 0. 0001 level and the relative humidity was ranged from 42. 6 to 45 % and dry bulb temperatureranged from 28 to 29 °C were statistically significant at 0. 035 and 0. 0001 level, respectively. A statistical predictive model was obtained from multiple regression modeling for MDI and psychrometric parameters. The result of the current study may be useful for the prediction of diisocyanate pollution for polyurethane factoriesin the same psychrometric condition. This indicates that the MDI concentration is attributed to psychrometric parameters...|$|E
40|$|Background: Diisocyanates {{are widely}} used in surface coatings, {{polyurethane}} (PUR) foams, adhesives, resins, elastomers, binders, and sealants. Isocyanate exposure is irritative to the skin, mucous membranes, eyes, and respiratory tract. The most common adverse health outcome associated with isocyanate exposure is asthma due to sensitization. Objective: The goal {{of this study is}} to find statistical predictive model to determine the relationship between airborne hexamethylene diisocyanate (HDI) and selective psychrometric variables. Materials and Methods: All air samplers (by <b>midget</b> <b>impinger)</b> were collected by mini personal sampler pump fixed to work stations near the source of pollution. The air samples and psychrometric parameters were separately collected and determined in a working shift for three periods of 2 h, each at a flow rate of 2 l/min in an impinger containing a solution of reagent of dimethyl sulfoxide in tryptamine [US National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), 1994]. Results: There was a significant correlation between HDI concentration and relative humidity and dry bulb temperature (P 0. 05). Conclusions: The finding of the study may be a useful initial tool in estimating possible HDI pollution situation in the PUR workplaces, based on simple psychrometric factors (indoor air temperature and relative humidity) ...|$|E
40|$|Diisocyanates {{are used}} as a initial {{chemical}} material in different factories such as surface coatings, polyurethane foams, adhesives, resins, elastomers, binders and sealants. In the polyurethane workplace there are aerosols of diisocyanates which has important to effect on workers. They can also be exposed to partial reaction of isocyanate-containing intermediates formed during polyurethane production. The main objective of this study pointed on assessment of exposure risk factors with MDI in the workplace, determination of MDI concentration and biomonitoring of MDA in polyurethane industries. NISOH (National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health) 5522 sampling and analysis method was used by <b>midget</b> <b>impinger</b> contained dimethyl sulfoxide with tryptamine. HPLC (High Performance Liquid Chromatography) was employed for air sampling analysis and GC (Gas Chromatography) for urine analysis. Getting personality data {{was carried out by}} Health Surveillance Questionnaire and multiple linear regression models with ANOVA test was used for the statistical analysis. The result of study showed that there was a diisocyanate pollution (MDI > 96. 6 μg/m³) and it have seen in the workers' urine. A new approach to assess isocyanate pollution in the workplace is risk factor assessment simultaneously with indoor air pollution and biological monitoring...|$|E
40|$|A {{gas sample}} is {{extracted}} from the sampling point in the stack. The sulfuric acid mist (including sulfur trioxide) and the sulfur dioxide (SO 2) are separated. The SO 2 fraction {{is measured by the}} barium-thorin titration method. 1. 2 Applicability This method is applicable for the determination of SO 2 emissions from stationary sources. The minimum detectable limit of the method has been determined to be 3. 4 milligrams (mg) of SO 2 /m 3 (2. 12 x 10 - 7 lb/ft 3). Although no upper limit has been established, tests have shown that concentrations as high as 80, 000 mg/m 3 of SO 2 can be collected efficiently in two <b>midget</b> <b>impingers,</b> each containing 15 milliliters of 3 percent hydrogen peroxide, at a rate of 1. 0 liter/min for 20 minutes. Based on theoretical calculations, the upper concentration limit in a 20 -liter sample is about 93, 300 mg/m 3. Possible interferents are free ammonia, water-soluble cations, and fluorides. The cations and fluorides are removed by glass wool filters and an isopropanol bubbler, and hence do not affect the SO 2 analysis. When samples are being taken from a gas stream with high concentrations of very fine metallic fumes (such as found in inlets to control devices), a high-efficiency glass-fiber filter must be used in place of the glass wool plug (i. e., the one in the probe) to remove the cation interferents. Free ammonia interferes by reacting with SO 2 to form particulate sulfite and by reacting with the indicator. If free ammonia is present (this can be determined by knowledge of the process and noticing white particulate matter in the probe and isopropanol bubbler), alternative methods subject to the approval of the Executive Officer, are required. Any modification of this method beyond those expressly permitted shall be considered a major modification subject to the approval of the Executive Officer. The term Executive Officer as used in this document shall mean the Executive Officer of the Air Resources Board (ARB), or his or her authorized representative...|$|R
40|$|Today many raw {{materials}} used in factories may have a dangerous effect on the physiological system of workers. One of them, which is widely used in the polyurethane factories, is diisocyanates. These compounds are widely used in surface coatings, polyurethane foams, adhesives, resins, elastomers, binders, and sealants. Exposure to diisocyanates causes irritation to the skin, mucous membranes, eyes, and respiratory tract. Methylene dianiline (MDA) is a metabolite of methylene diphenyle diisocyanate (MDI), an excretory material of worker&#x 2032;s urine who are exposed to MDI. Around 100 air samples were collected among five factories by the <b>Midget</b> <b>Impinger,</b> which contained DMSO absorbent as a solvent and Tryptamine as a reagent. Samples were analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography with an ECUV detector using the NIOSH 5522 method of sampling and analysis. Also, fifty urine samples were collected from workers by using William&#x 2032;s biological analysis method. The concentration of MDI in all air samples was more than 88 &#x 00 B 5;g/m&#x 00 B 3;, showing {{a high concentration of}} the pollutant in the workplaces in comparison with the NIOSH standard, and all the worker&#x 2032;s urine was contaminated by MDA. The correlation and regression tests were used to obtain statistical model for MDI and MDA that is useful for prediction of diisocyanates pollution situation in the polyurethane factories...|$|E
40|$|Isocyanates {{are used}} in the {{production}} of polyurethane (PUR). Exposure to isocyanates is associated with respiratory disorders and may occur during production or processing of PUR. During thermal degradation of PUR, amines and aminoisocyanates are formed in addition to isocyanates. Some isocyanates and several aromatic amines are sensitizers and listed as carcinogens. A liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS) method for simultaneous determination of isocyanates, aminoisocyanates and amines in gas and particle phase was developed. Air samples were collected in <b>midget</b> <b>impinger</b> flasks, containing di-n-butylamine (DBA) in toluene, and glass fibre filters in series to form specific DBA-isocyanate derivatives. Amines were derivatized with ethyl chloroformate. Derivatives were characterized using both LC-MS and LC-chemiluminescent nitrogen detection. Gas chromatography with MS and thermionic specific detection was also used. LC-MS detection resulted in a highly sensitive measurement of isocyanates equivalent to 1 / 2000 of the Swedish threshold limit value (for TDI in a 5 L air sample). In air samples from spray painting operations, aliphatic isocyanates that have not been reported previously were revealed. In car repair shops, during work operations such as welding in PUR-coated metal sheets, isocyanates, aminoisocyanates and amines were observed at high concentrations in both gas and particle phase. Compounds with high volatility were efficiently collected in the impinger flask, whereas compounds with low volatility were mainly found on the filter. Isocyanic acid (ICA) and methyl isocyanate (MIC) were among the most dominating compounds present. ICA and MIC could also be observed when urea-based resins were thermally degraded...|$|E
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 36 - 38) Limits on {{exposure to}} various airborne nonfibrous mineral dusts are given as Threshold Limit Values (TLVs) (ACGIH, 1976). The TLVs {{for some of}} these dusts are given in terms of millions of particles per cubic foot of air (mppcf) as collected by <b>midget</b> <b>impinger</b> and counted by microscope using light field technics. The American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (1976) has recently proposed a means of converting this concentration to an equivalent concentration stated in terms of milligrams per cubic meter of air (mg/m 3) for the respirable portion of the dust sampled. This conversion would allow the use of respirable mass sampling devices such as the 10 mm nylon cyclone in determining whether the level of exposure is exceeding the TLV. Respirable dust sampling is now widely accepted as the best estimate of the health hazard due to inhalation of insoluble particles. The proposed conversion, 6 mppcf = l mg/m 3 of respirable mass (ACGIH, 1976), is based largely on one study (Jacobson and Tomb, 1967), mostly of coal dust, in which an empirical relationship of 5. 6 mppcf = 1 mg/m 3 of respirable mass was derived. The present experiment centered on evaluating if the relationship found mostly with coal dust particles, which are closely spherical, is the same for non-asbestiform talc dust particles, which are platelet in shape. Using a dust generator, mixing chamber, and sampling trains with midget impingers and cyclones, pairs of dust samples were collected under two sets of conditions. (See more in text. ...|$|E
40|$|Due to the {{character}} of the original source materials and the nature of batch digitization, quality control issues may be present in this document. Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references. When sampling for isocyanates, the two currently recommended methods (OSHA 42 and NIOSH 5521) have limitations that cause under estimation of the isocyanate concentration reported. During spray painting operations, isocyanate is present in both aerosol and vapor forms. When the NIOSH method is used the <b>midget</b> <b>impinger</b> inlet and outlet nozzles tend to plug as paint particles collect there during sampling. As the outlet nozzle opening becomes smaller, the velocity of the sampling stream increases causing particles to pass through the derivatizing agent without capture. Both phenomena result in underestimation of aerosol content of the sampled air. In the OSHA method, particles adhere {{to the surface of the}} glass fiber filter as seen in Scanning Electron Microscope photographs. The presence of these particles reduce the effectiveness of solid sampling media such as glass fiber filters in sampling for aerosol isocyanates since only limited contact between the derivatizing agent and the aerosol particles collected on the filter surface occurs. Once the outer surface of the isocyanate particle is polymerized, the derivatizing agent cannot break the bonds in order to form urea. When sampling for vapors, the OSHA and NIOSH methods are equally effective. Using a Fourier Transform Infrared Spectrometer reaction rates between isocyanates and the derivatizing agent for the OSHA method were studied. Although usually considered instantaneous, this study showed that these reactions took as long as several hours to go to completion. During this time isocyanate evaporation into the air flow is occurring. In both methods, as much as five percent of the isocyanates are lost due to slow reactions and/or sampling media break through...|$|E

This study aims to analyze the level of indoor air contamination honai based on the SO 2 parameters, measuring the level of contamination and inhalation lung vital capacity of honai dwellers. Samples were collected from 30 Honai house before and after modification by measuring the concentration of SO 2 levels. Similarly, 30 respondents occupants of Honai house measured for their lung vital capacity and the level of their air inhalation. SO 2 samples were collected using <b>midget</b> <b>impinger</b> technique and concentration were measured using Pararosaniline - spectrophotometry. In addition, lung vital capacity was measured using spirometry while personal inhalation measured by the Personal inhalation tool.

40|$|The {{emission}} {{rates of}} N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF), formamide (FAd), and certain hazardous {{volatile organic compounds}} (VOCs) were measured from seventeen mattress textile samples with four different raw material types: polyurethane (PU: n= 3), polyester/polyethylene (PE: n= 7), ethylene vinyl acetate (EV: n= 3), and polyvinyl chloride (PC: n= 4). To simulate the emissions in a heated room during winter season, measurements were made under temperature-controlled conditions, i. e., 50 degrees C by using a mini-chamber system made of a <b>midget</b> <b>impinger.</b> Comparison of the data indicates that the patterns were greatly distinguished between DMF and FAd. PU products yielded the highest mean emission rates of DMF (2940 mu g m(- 2) h(- 1) : n= 3) followed by PE (325 mu g m(- 2) h(- 1) : n- 7) although its emission was not seen from other materials (EV and PC). In contrast, the pattern of FAd emission was moderately reversed from that of DMF: EV ? PC ? PE ? PU. The results of our analysis confirm that most materials used for mattress production have the strong potential to emit either DMF or FAd in relatively large quantities while in use in children&# 39;s care facilities, especially in winter months. Moreover, it was also observed that an increase in temperature (25 degrees C to 50 degrees C) {{had a significant impact}} on the emission rate of FAd and other hazardous VOCs. In addition to the aforementioned amides, the study revealed significant emissions of a number of hazardous VOCs, such as aromatic and carbonyl compounds. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

40|$|Many {{sources of}} {{airborne}} contaminants {{have always been}} present in various work environments. With the development of thermosetting plastic systems, the use of reactive chemical compounds was greatly increased and thus also the risk of exposure to reactive and potentially hazardous compounds. Exposure can occur in many situations, {{not only at the}} workplace where the raw materials are handled. The finished products may emit unreacted or excess compounds, like in furniture made of particleboard with phenol-formaldehyde resin that may emit formaldehyde for a long time. Another emission source can arise when some thermosetting plastics like polyurethane and phenol-formaldehyde-urea resins are heated, intentionally or by accident. Many different types of isocyanates in a complex mixture are released at such occasions. In an effort to characterise those emissions in more detail, a new analytical method for the derivatisation and analysis of isocyanates was developed. The new derivatisation reagent, di-n-butylamine, was found to be suitable for the determination of many types of isocyanates even when complicated mixtures of air pollutants were present in the work environment. However, {{it was found that the}} used standard sampler, the <b>midget</b> <b>impinger,</b> had almost negligible collection efficiency for particles with an aerodynamic diameter smaller than 1. 5 µm. In the work operations where polyurethane products were heated and decomposed, leading to the emission of isocyanate-containing aerosols, the particles were found to be mainly in the sub-micron range and thus not collected by the impinger sampler. In car repair shops, very high concentrations of airborne isocyanates found to be emitted at common work operations as welding and cutting in polyurethane painted vehicles. As an initial solution, a glass-fibre filter was connected in series after the impinger to collect the particles that otherwise would have escaped sampling. The relatively volatile reagent dibutylamine proved to be well suited for this sampling technique as the reagent evaporates from the sampling liquid and impregnates particles collected on the filter. In air samples taken with this method in car repair shops, very high concentrations of isocyanates were found to be emitted during operations such as welding and cutting in vehicles. In order to avoid undesirable reactions that can take place between the studied compound and other compounds present in the work environment, it is desirable to supply the reagent at the earliest possible moment in the sampling process. The ideal might be to supply the reagent to the sample even before collection. Using the aerosol particles as condensation nuclei for a condensing reagent vapour, this can be done. A new method to supply a large excess of liquid reagent to particles in an aerosol before collection of the particles was presented. This new type of sampler may become useful in the investigation of the actual chemical composition of reactive air contaminants at workplaces...|$|E
