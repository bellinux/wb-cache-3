Evaluating alternative methods for <b>manure</b> <b>removal</b> at Otterbein is essential for both economic and green energy initiatives. Two companies who manufacture waste to energy systems, SEaB Energy and Bioferm Energy Systems, were contacted regarding the feasibility for the small-scale anaerobic digesters that they currently market (the Muckbuster and EUCOlino, respectively). Quasar Energy Corporation was also contacted as a possible off-site manure disposal option at their Zanesville large-scale dry digestion facility. Both the Muckbuster and EUCOlino options were determined to be economically infeasible for Otterbein University based on analysis on economic investment versus economic return. The Quasar Energy Corporation option could be economically feasible if Otterbein can provide storage for its manure for three-week intervals and invests in a front-end loader. Implications for this project are that Otterbein could potentially reduce its <b>manure</b> <b>removal</b> costs while supporting a green energy initiative, and that the Austin E.

Of particular interest is why after 3 or 4 years the soil test K (STK) levels are less than or greater than expected based on prior STK levels and nutrient budgets for K additions (fertilizer and/or <b>manure)</b> and <b>removals</b> (crop removal of K). It must be remembered that K availability is assessed by chemical extractions (soil tests).

This paper will highlight factors that affect exchangeable K and subsequently STK levels. Drying/Wetting Exchangeable K can either increase or decrease upon drying and is dependent upon the clay minerals present. Potassium fixation (K becomes non-exchangeable) can occur from drying soils with high exchangeable K or recent K fertilizer applications. Fixation is a result of K becoming trapped within clay sheets as they dry and collapse. While K release (K becomes exchangeable) can occur when soils low in exchangeable K are dried because the clay sheets roll back and release K (McLean and Watson, 1985). The net effect is dependent upon whether fixation or release dominates and is dependent upon the types of clays and the amount o...|$|R

40|$|Random {{samples were}} taken for 3 yr from five sample areas in cattle feedlot pens. The {{goal was to}} {{determine}} where, when, and under what conditions occurred the development of immature stages of the stable fly, Stomoxys calcitrans (L.), and the house fly, Musca domestica L., (Diptera: Muscidae). Feedlots practiced either minimum (possible annual <b>manure</b> <b>removal),</b> intermediate (annual <b>manure</b> <b>removal</b> and possible insecticide use), or intense (<b>manure</b> <b>removal</b> and insecticide use scheduled several times annually) management to control fly pests 2 ̆ 7 populations. Immature stable flies were affected by feedlot management: managements ranked (highest to lowest numbers of flies) were minimum, intermediate, and intense. Numbers of immature house flies were not affected by feedlot management. The feed apron sample area consistently yielded the highest numbers of both pests. Immature stable flies were found predominantly in the early (cool) season; immature house flies were found predominantly in the later (warm) season. The number of stable fly immatures correlated strongly to adults in 1986 and 1987. At least 47 spp. of associated arthropods were found coinhabiting with these pests. The predominant predator (≈ 17 spp. total) species was Platystethus cornutus Grav. (Coleoptera: Staphylinidae) while the predominant potential competitor (≈ 30 spp. total) species was Coproica sp. (probably vagans) (Diptera: Sphaeroceridae). Predators were found in about equal numbers between feedlot managements and sample areas in all 3 yr. Potential competitors were found in about equal numbers between feedlot managements; along the feed apron was the predominant sample area in all 3 yr. The high percentage of organic matter at the feed apron was the major contributing factor to successful development of pests and competitors. Regression analysis showed potential for predicting numbers of immature stable flies. Immature stages of the stable fly appeared more sensitive {{to changes in the}} microhabitat than immature house flies.

40|$|Within manure {{management}} strategies, treatment facilities aiming at reducing the nitrogen content of effluent to be spread on fields {{do not have}} to become a source of pollution themselves through transferring the problem from soil and water to the atmosphere. In this context, an interesting solution for the treatment of slurry that meets both requirements is the nitrification-denitrification (DN-N) process. The biological reactions that occur in a DN-N plant remove nitrogen as N 2, an inert gas in the atmosphere, thus reducing further fermentation and the consequent emission of nitrogen from the following storage and land spreading operations. Nitrification is positively affected by temperature. According to Monod kinetic, a nitrogen removal rate at 30 °C is three times greater than the amount that can be processed at 20 °C. This has been verified through an experimental test using a DN-N pilot plant operating with swine liquid <b>manure.</b> The nitrogen <b>removal</b> rate increased from 1. 5 gN-NH 4 /d to more than 8 g N-NH 4 /d. At a farm-scale, to warm the nitrification reactor, the heat generated by the CHP unit of a biogas plant can be used.

The study also examined whether any pavement construction gave acceptable sealing to the underlying soil surface. Three different combinations of non-woven and woven geotextile together with two gravel fractions of 200 mm were exposed to 50 mm precipitation for 30 minutes and 15 kg of cattle manure under two manure regimes (<b>manure</b> <b>removal</b> and manure accumulation). Runoff, drainage effluent and leachate were flow measured and sampled in buckets as they exited their respective pipes for both regimes.

40|$|Abstract. Research was {{conducted}} to develop process applications for anaerobic ammonium oxidation (anammox) bacteria acclimated to animal wastewater conditions using microbial immobilization techniques. In the anammox reaction, under anaerobic and autotrophic conditions, ammonium (NH 4 +) serves as the electron donor using nitrite (NO 2 -) as the electron acceptor resulting in production of harmless di-nitrogen (N 2) gas. Compared to conventional nitrification-denitrification, this combined pathway saves more than 50 % of the oxygen supply for nitrification and 100 % of the external organic source for denitrification. This leads to {{a significant reduction in}} energy needs of treatment, and a decrease in operational costs. In addition, by-products do not include greenhouse gases. The isolation of anammox adapted to animal wastewater environments can be of significant importance to farming systems because excess ammonia in modern, industrial-type livestock production is a global problem and the use of conventional biological N removal methods is usually hindered by cost. Thus, we think that the more economical anammox based treatment can greatly facilitate adoption of advanced wastewater treatment technologies by farmers. The anammox cultures were successfully established using continuous-flow unit processes and biomass carriers seeded with sludges of <b>manure</b> origin. Anammox <b>removal</b> rates obtained were in the range of industrial N removal applications. These findings overall may lead to development o...|$|R

A sampling of liquid pig manure was taken to assess the presence of 26 pathogens {{at the beginning of the}} study and another one at the end of the process in manure tanks and biodigesters. For the manure tank, a 250 liters tank was filled with fresh pig manure and was analyzed after three days of storage. The biodigesters were of continuous flow and its effluents were analyzed, according to the specific hydraulic retention times. The diagnostic techniques were those recommended specifically for each microorganism and were carried out in certified labs by the Colombian Animal Health authority. Results.

40|$|In {{this study}} {{the degree of}} {{leaching}} of the nitrogen surplus to groundwater and surface waters is calculated per soil type for arable land and grassland. Leaching differs between soil types and forms of land use. For arable land on well drained sandy soils about 90 % of the nitrogen surplus leaches from the root zone. For grassland on peat soils this is only 5 %. A nitrogen surplus is the remainder of nitrogen supply, for example via artificial fertiliser and <b>manure,</b> and nitrogen <b>removal,</b> for example via harvest of crops. Of the three soil types considered leaching of nitrogen decreases in the order: sand - clay - peat. For sandy soils leaching is largest for well drained soils with relatively deep groundwater levels and smallest for poor drained soils with shallow groundwater. In addition leaching is larger for arable land than for grassland. This data is of importance to prevent too much leaching of nitrogen to groundwater and surface waters due to fertilisation. The Nitrates Directive obliges all Member States to prevent this. The Netherlands have developed a system of nitrogen use standards that limits both total nitrogen use and nitrogen use via animal manure. For arable and horticultural crops grown on sandy soils or loess nitrogen use standards are not yet available for 2008 and 2009.

In a simulated rainfall (SR) study, the test areas were also exposed to 50 mm precipitation for 30 min and 15 kg of horse manure under the two manure regimes.

The geotextile-gravel construction reduced runoff and drained the test area throughout the two-year period, confirming construction stability and a dry walking surface area at a mean drain flow of 3. 65 L m- 2 h- 1. The concentrations of total N, total phosphorus (TP), chemical oxygen demand (COD) and total solids (TS) in fluids leaving the test areas in winter were lower than in previous studies, due to lower horse density.

An on-farm instrumentation shelter houses the equipment for measuring pollutant concentrations at representative barn air inlets and outlets, barn airflows, operational processes and environmental variables. Sampling began in July 2007 with data logged every 15 s and 60 s; sampling will continue for 24 months in total.

One site (Stein) is a new meadow bird reserve and is managed predominantly by mowing in June and August. The second site (Oukoop) is an intensive dairy farm. Maximum photosynthetic uptake of the grass sward (range 2 to 34 ?mol CO 2 m ? 2 s ? 1) showed a close and similar linear relationship with Leaf Area Index (LAI; range 1 to 5) except in maturing hay meadows, where maximum photosynthetic uptake did not increase further. Apparent quantum yield varied between 0. 02 and 0. 08 (mean 0. 045) ?mol CO 2 ?mol ? 1 photons at both sites and was significantly correlated with LAI during the growth season.

The N, P, and K {{value of the}} manure generated annually by a 100 -sow farrow-to-finish operation can be worth over $ 8, 000 {{at the time it}} is hauled to the field.

A 50 bu/acre soybean crop removes approximately $ 40 of P and K per acre. Because manure contains more P and K relative to N based on corn crop <b>removal,</b> <b>manure</b> applied to corn based on crop N needs generally contains enough P and K to fertilize a second crop with both nutrients. Therefore, in a two-year corn-soybean rotation, the manure applied to a corn crop can easily be worth $ 140 /acre by eliminating the need for commercial N, P, and K for both the corn and soybean crops. Ideally, you should apply manure based on its plant-available N (PAN) content and place it on fields that test low for P and K so that crop production fields can benefit from the added P and K. To maximize manure nutrient value, you need three things: a manure nutrient analysis, application equipment that can apply manure at the desired PAN rate, and soil test reports to determine which fields will benefit most from the P and K present in the manure.

40|$|The {{production}} {{level in}} Swedish pig production is high, but {{their ability to}} compete in comparison with other countries is weak, because the Swedish production costs are high. Particularly poor is the competitiveness of Swedish piglet production, whereas growing-finishing pig production generally manages better. Those production costs which are especially high in Sweden are for buildings and labour. In this report, the results of work studies carried out in piglet producing herds with farrowing pens constructed after 2000, are reported. The herds were chosen in consultation with Swedish Meats/Scan AB. The aim of the studies was {{to focus on the}} farrowing pen, and how its’ design affected the time necessary for <b>manure</b> <b>removal</b> and management of the piglets. The work studies were thus divided into two separate work operations: work operation 1) the removal of manure and checking/monitoring the piglets, and work operation 2) managing/handling the piglets. In each herd, the work operations have been carried out continually within a number of farrowing pens per farrowing unit. The time for the different activities (transport outside the pen, transport inside the pen, work with gates, work with boards, work with doors/hatches, dunging out and the monitoring and management of the piglets) has been noted using a hand-held computer (PSION). All the practical work with <b>manure</b> <b>removal</b> and animal management has been done by the same individual in all the herds (Person 1). Similarly, all the notations with the computer have been carried out by the same observer in all the herds (Person 2). A total of 16 herds have been visited 1 - 2 times each. At the visit, besides the work studies, the owner/stock person has been interviewed with respect to herd management, farrowing pen design and cleaning, routines and management of the piglets, etc. In addition, the farrowing pens in every herd have been measured and photo-documented in detail. The farrowing pens in the 16 herds have been divided into two different types: pens without a protective bar system (Pen A) and pens with a protective bar system which can be used to limit the sow’s movements, if necessary (Pen B). In Figures 1 - 7, the plans and photographs of all the Pen A farrowing pens are shown, whereas similar documentation for Pen B is given in Figures 8 - 16. All the pens without a protective bar system (Pen A) were also used for rearing the pigs during the first weeks after weaning (the so-called not-moved system), while the piglets in the farrowing pens with a protective bar system (Pen B) were moved at weaning (the so-called moved system). The pens in the moved system were somewhat smaller, had a higher proportion of slatted floors, and had the dung removed more often using vacuum <b>manure</b> <b>removal</b> than did the pens in the not moved system (Table 1). The hygiene scores for the solid floors were, however, on average, the same for both pen systems (0. 44 and 0. 43, respectively) (Table 1) : Besides having two pen types A or B, the pens were also classified according to the proportion of slatted flooring (45 % of the total pen area having slatted floors). They were also classified according to the orientation of the pen to the inspection alley (front, back or side oriented). The results of the time studies of work operation 1 (<b>manure</b> <b>removal</b> and piglet monitoring) are shown in in diagram form per herd Figure 17 [...] It {{can be seen from the}} Figure that there is a large variation between the herds and that the time spent for dunging out sometimes was nearly half of the entire work operation. On average, it was observed that the work operation for dunging out in total required 0. 84 min per pen and occasion, while just scraping out the dung required on average circa 0. 44 min per pen. The remainder of the time was spent opening gates, hatches, transport between pens, etc. In general, there was a significant correlation between the hygiene score for the solid areas of the pen and the time spent on <b>manure</b> <b>removal</b> and the entire work operation, respectively (Table 2). Irrespective of pen type, it was also clear that having a good pen hygiene reduced the work related to <b>manure</b> <b>removal.</b> The total time for work operation 1 was also significantly affected by the proportion of slatted floors in the pen, being faster if the proportion was greater. Since Pen A on average had somewhat less slatted areas, a rather longer time for this work operation was noted for this pen type in comparison with that for Pen B. In the statistical analyses, where consideration was also given to the proportion of slatted floors in the model, it was found, however, that this difference was not significant. Within pen type A, the variation in time spent in work operation 1 was also especially great between the different herds (Figure 17), and it should be noted that the shortest time for the activity “manure removal” was noted for a type A farrowing pen. A statistically significant difference between Pens A and B, to the detriment of Pen A, was, however, noted for the activity “management of gates”. This was mainly due to the necessity of entering the pen for <b>manure</b> <b>removal,</b> because Pen A had about 35 % greater solid floor area than pen B. In Pen B, at least in some pen design variations, it was possible to reach the whole solid area from the inspection path outside the pen. This greatly reduced the time spent handling gates. For the forward oriented pen, a significantly shorter time for monitoring the piglets as well as a tendency for spending a shorter amount of time for gate management was noted (Table 4). The shorter time for gate management was due to the routine for dunging out the forward oriented pens completely from outside the pens (Figure 18), which was used in many herds. With respect to work operation 2 (piglet management) a tendency towards a negative relationship between the time required for this work operation and work operation 1 could be shown. That is, in the pens where the <b>manure</b> <b>removal</b> was quickly and efficiently performed, it took, instead, somewhat longer time to manage/handle the piglets (Table 5). On average, the work operation “handling piglets” took 2. 47 min per pen (when standardised to 11 pigs per pen). That is, nearly 3 times as long as time required for <b>manure</b> <b>removal.</b> Collecting and management the piglet in this way, however, was carried out significantly less often than the manure operation; often only on 1 - 2 occasions per litter in connection with castration, iron treatment and teeth filing. The entire work operation 2, management of animals, was carried out significantly faster in Pen A (without a protective bar system). This could possibly be explained by the tendency to use more time for managing gates, because sometimes the protective bar system had to be opened or moved in order to get the piglets (Table 6), as noted for the pens with the protective bar system. The proportion of slatted floors in the pens had no significant influence on how quickly the management of the piglets was carried out (Table 6). Nor did the factor “orientation of pen in relation to the inspection alley” appear to have any significant influence on the time required to manage the pigs (work operation 2) (Table 7). On the other hand, there was a tendency that the piglet management was carried out somewhat faster in the side oriented pens (Table 7). How then can we summarise what we have learned in the present study about the optimal design of a farrowing pen? As in many other situations it can be concluded that there are many conflicts between the different aims which one wants to achieve! It is clear that an increase in the proportion of slatted flooring in the pen will reduce the time for removing the dung. However, a increase in slatted floor area, leads to a corresponding reduction in the amount of bedding material used. On the other hand, no significant difference in the time required for <b>manure</b> <b>removal</b> between the pens where the sow was always free to move around (not moved system, Pen A), and where the pens had a protective bar system to be used at farrowing (moved system, Type B) can be determined. The piglets are, however, managed significantly faster in Pen A due to a better gate system for locking the piglets in their creep area. The orientation of the pen also appears to have some influence on the dung removal activity (work operation 1). In the side oriented pens, this activity appears to be somewhat more difficult in comparison with the front or the back oriented pens. The significantly higher hygiene score in the side oriented pens may explain this observation. The interpretation is unclear, but it may be that it is more difficult to have optimal ventilation in the side oriented pens. The length of the alleys in a farrowing unit with side oriented pens is also longer, since it is necessary to go past the long side of the pen and not the short side when transporting past the pens, as for the other orientations. In some of the newer front oriented pens, shorter times for the removal of dung (work operation 1) have been observed. This depends on, among other things, being able to scrape the solid area from outside the pen, which greatly reduced the time required for managing the gates. It should, however, be noted that even if the pen normally can be scraped from outside, sometimes it is necessary to enter the pen to do it more carefully, or in order to manage the piglets. Where there was no flexibility in the form of having gates in the dung alley was considered to be irritating, “cheap” and clearly a working environment shortcoming by many of the stockpersons in the study. The greater proportion of slatted floors in the farrowing pen permitted according to the Animal Welfare Regulations of 2006 (DFS 2006 : 4), clearly appeared to reduce the amount of work in connection with <b>manure</b> <b>removal</b> in these piglet herds. A good pen hygiene also reduced the time for dung removal work. A general effort to maintain good hygiene in the pen, irrespective of pen type, could therefore be another important measure of importance for dung removal work. In some of the visited herds they had distinct management instructions for how to keep a good pen hygiene. Such instructions could be, for example, to always clean up wet solid areas in the pen and and to help this areas to dry by putting on materials such as wood shavings or Stalosan. It should also be considered that the <b>manure</b> <b>removal</b> itself only constitutes about half of the time required for the entire work operation. Therefore, reducing the time for handling gates and hatches in the dung alley, etc. would be other important measures for reducing the work effort in connection with pen cleaning. This did not mean, however, that the pens should be designed without gates! A lack of gates when the stockperson really needs to come into the pen to treat ill animals, etc., is experienced by the stockperson as being a great disadvantage. The consequences could therefore be instead that the stockperson avoided entering the pen when necessary to maintain a good animal care. This could, besides being poor husbandry, lead to undesirable negative effects on production. The study presented here indicates a number of details in the farrowing pen which are of importance for <b>manure</b> <b>removal</b> work and for work with the management of the piglets. In the discussion, several factors have been taken up which must be considered when deciding which farrowing pen-/not moved pen should be chosen (see Discussion). The final choice is made by the piglet producer. Our hope is, however, that the presented study can help the individual piglet producer to make this decision...|$|E

Gaseous (NH 3 and CO 2) concentrations of incoming and exhaust air streams were measured using custom-designed portable monitoring units that shared similar performance to EPA-approved measurement apparatus. Building ventilation rates were determined by calibrated CO 2 mass balance using the latest metabolic rate data for modern laying hens. The field monitoring involved a total of 386 and 164 house-day measurements or 18, 528 and 7, 872 30 -min emission data points for the HR houses and the MB houses, respectively. The ER showed considerable diurnal and seasonal variations. The annual mean ERs (g NH 3 hen- 1 d- 1) and standard errors were 0. 90 ± 0. 027 for IA-HR houses with standard diet, 0. 81 ± 0. 02 for IA-HR houses with a nutritionally balanced 1 % lower crude protein diet, 0. 83 ± 0. 070 for PA-HR houses with standard diet, 0. 054 ± 0. 0035 for IA-MB houses with daily <b>manure</b> <b>removal,</b> and 0. 094 ± 0. 006 for PA-MB houses with twice a week <b>manure</b> <b>removal.</b> Mass balance of nitrogen (N) intake and output performed for IA-HR houses revealed a total N intake recovery of 94 % to 101 %, further verifying the certainty of the NH 3 ER measurements.

40|$|Ammonia {{emissions}} from {{both traditional and}} new welfare-based housing systems for laying hens must be reduced to prevent {{detrimental effects on the}} environment. In a comparative study, the effect of manure handling (variation in drying and removal frequency) in a battery cage and the effect of manure handling (as in battery cage system) and litter treatment (removal of litter) in a Tiered Wire Floor (TWF) aviary system on the emission of ammonia were investigated. Each system housed 6480 hens, treatments were varied in time, and effects were analysed by means of time-series analysis. The hens in the TWF system dropped 22. 5 % of their excreta in the litter and the remaining part, like all manure in the battery cage system, was dropped on the manure belts. The estimated emission from the manure on the belts in both systems was 18. 8 g/h (daily mean, <b>manure</b> <b>removal</b> twice a day), whereas the emission from the litter in the TWF system amounted to 62. 5 g/h. Emission from the belt manure on a typical day increased by 14, 39, 109 and 177 % from the 1 st until the 4 th day after <b>manure</b> <b>removal.</b> The effect of increasing temperature and water vapour pressure difference on emission was 17 % and - 22 % per degree and per kPa, respectively. Drying of manure on the belts increased the dry matter content of the manure and showed a tendency towards lower emissions. The dry matter content of the litter varied between 780 and 840 g/kg, the mean total nitrogen content was 3. 3 % of the dry matter, and the layer thickness varied between 2 and 9 cm. Both the ammonia content, which ranged between 20 and 190 mg/kg, and the layer thickness of the litter influenced the emission from the litter positively...|$|E

Maximum photosynthetic uptake of the grass sward (range 2 to 34 mu mol CO 2 m(- 2) s(- 1)) showed a close and similar linear relationship with Leaf Area Index (LAI; range 1 to 5) except in maturing hay meadows, where maximum photosynthetic uptake did not increase further. Apparent quantum yield varied between 0. 02 and 0. 08 (mean 0. 045) mu mol CO 2 mu mol(- 1) photons at both sites and was significantly correlated with LAI during the growth season. Ecosystem Respiration at 10 degrees C (R- 10) calculated from the year round data set was 3. 35 mu mol CO 2 m(- 2) s(- 1) at Stein and 3. 69 mu mol CO 2 m(- 2) s(- 1) at Oukoop.

40|$|Pest and {{diseases}} in agricultural systems reduce the yield {{and quality of}} available food and feed worldwide. To meet the global growing demand for these products, losses should be reduced, preferably in a sustainable way. Integrated Pest Management (IPM) is a sustainable method that aims to minimize economic losses due to pests {{and diseases}}. IPM is generally based on eight steps: 1) prevention, 2) monitoring, 3) Decision‐making based on monitoring and thresholds, 4) use of non‐chemical methods, 5) pesticide selection, 6) reduced pesticide use, 7) anti‐resistance strategies, and 8) evaluation. With these steps, {{it is possible to}} prevent and control pests and diseases whilst deploying pesticides only as a last resort, thus reducing issues with pesticide contamination and resistance. Implementation of IPM by farmers increases when it is clear that it is compatible with existing farm processes and that it results in benefits for them. Successful IPM is most commonly applied against pests and diseases in crop production. When comparing the number of research articles on IPM in crop production with the number of research articles on IPM in animal production, it becomes clear that a paucity of scientific papers have been published on the latter. In laying hen facilities, for example, the application of all but basic IPM is still rare, even though the benefits of IPM have been described for poultry pests and disease vectors. In laying hen facilities Dermanyssus gallinae (PRM=poultry red mite), an hematophagous parasite, is common {{in many parts of the}} world. This mite is hard to control and negatively affects hen health, ‐welfare and farm economics, with estimated costs of infestation reaching 130 million euro per year in Europe. Currently, implementation of IPM for D. gallinae in laying hen facilities is limited to some combination of cleaning between flocks, limited preventive measures, and application of chemically or physically acting products. Implementation of more advanced IPM programmes for D. gallinae should therefore be considered to improve control prospects for this pest in laying hen facilities.   This thesis focuses on the knowledge necessary for advancing IPM for D. gallinae in laying hen facilities. More specifically it focuses on prevention, monitoring and population modelling of this significant pest, with preventive measures and monitoring being key in advancing IPM per se. Knowledge assessment. To develop IPM for D. gallinae in laying hen facilities, biological and ecological knowledge of D. gallinae and knowledge of the effects of biotic and a‐biotic factors on this pests’ population development are required (Chapter 2). Therefore, a seminar was organized with eighteen D. gallinae researchers, from eight different European countries, with the aim of amassing existing expertise. This seminar gave insight into the current knowledge and knowledge gaps, regarding D. gallinae, also informing future perspectives and required developments for improving control of D. gallinae in laying hen facilities. During four sessions, the researchers present discussed lifecycle issues, effects of D. gallinae on hen and egg production, monitoring methods for D. gallinae infestations in laying hen facilities and control methods for D. gallinae in laying hen facilities. It was concluded that, where the D. gallinae lifecycle is concerned, a lot is still unknown about the mites feeding behaviour and preferences, mating behaviour, survival and conditions required for reproduction, host finding, aggregation cues, and attractant and repellent substances. When focusing on the effects of D. gallinae on the hen and on egg production it was agreed that a D. gallinae infestation is likely to result in higher water intake, lower egg production, lower feed conversion, increase of the immune response and reduced feather quality. It was also suggested that these effects may be hen genotype dependent, and further noted that effects are rarely quantified and need further investigation. Though monitoring was considered to be most important to improve control of D. gallinae, it was concluded that the available monitoring methods only indicate trends and a robust monitoring plan is lacking. The participants considered heating the hen house combined with a chemical treatment to be the most promising control method. Future promising developments for control of D. gallinae were considered to be use of vaccination, predatory mites and entomopathogenic fungi. The effects of D. gallinae on human health were not extensively discussed, but it was concluded that D. gallinae can be of medical significance, either directly via reaction to mite bites, or indirectly via human exposure to the chemicals used to control D. gallinae. Prevention. To acquire knowledge on the routes of introduction and spread of D. gallinae in laying hens facilities, the Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points (HACCP) system was used (Chapter 3). The structure of this system allows the user to identify the risk factors and the critical control points for the introduction and spread of pathogens and parasites. This method was further used to identify preventive and corrective actions against D. gallinae. Four experts identified 41 hazards for introduction and spread of D. gallinae in laying hen facilities. To prevent these hazards, these experts made several suggestions for corrective actions. The risks of 41 hazards were calculated by multiplying the likelihood (1 = occurring seldomly/theoretically; 2 = occurring approximately once a year; 3 = occurring repeatedly/more than once a year) by the severity (1 = low / single place in the facility becomes infested with D. gallinae; 2 = moderate/ facility becomes infested at more than one location; 3 = high/ D. gallinae infestation occurs at almost all places within the laying hen facility) of infestation. Hazards with a risk above 3, or with a severity of 3, were regarded as Critical Control Points (CCP’s). The CCP’s with the highest risks (risk of 6 and higher) for introduction of D. gallinae in laying hen facilities were: introduction of new flocks, containers and crates, the farmer and their employees. The CCP’s with the highest risks (risk of 6 and higher) for spread of D. gallinae between laying hen facilities were mice, rats and flies, wild birds, the feeding system, shared material and equipment, the egg conveyer belt, <b>manure</b> aeration pipes, <b>removal</b> of cadavers, visitors and external personnel, the farmer and their employees. The critical limits, a procedure step of the HACCP system which will be followed by a corrective action when the limit is exceeded, could not be determined as a result of lack of knowledge about thresholds. Subsequently,  suggestions  were made  for monitoring the mite population and for documentation and validation. A checklist was devised using the corrective action from the CCP’s with the highest risks. This management tool for layer farmers was evaluated by UK and Dutch layer farmers as feasible and useful. Monitoring. The approach of Reflexive Interactive Design (RIO) was used to design an automated monitoring tool for D. gallinae, including an automated mite detection sensor (Chapter 6). The approach generated effective and technically feasible solutions for the key functions of the automated mite detection sensor, these being 1) the assessment of the D. gallinae population, 2) localizing the location and assessing the time of detection and 3) removal of mites from the detection area. Three different design concepts were designed using these solutions. As an additional, albeit proven essential step to the RIO approach, the main solutions were tested with live mites ensuring the alignment of solutions with the biology and behaviour of D. gallinae in vivo. A combination of the best solutions were developed in two different prototypes. These prototypes were subsequently tested in the laboratory and on farm. The prototype situated under the perch,  with a through beam sensor and a pump to remove mites from the sensor after recording, was the most successful model. The designed automated mite detection sensor, or automated mite counter, for D. gallinae was subsequently validated in experimental laying hen cages with live birds and a growing population of D. gallinae (Chapter 5). The study resulted in 17 data points, each being a combination of ‘number of mites counted’ by the automated mite counter and the ‘number of mites present’ in the experimental laying hen cages. The regression line between the ‘number of mites counted’ and the ‘number of mites present’ demonstrated that the automated mite counter was able to track the D. gallinae population effectively. Population modelling. Step 2 of IPM describes not only pest monitoring in the field, but also ‘scientifically sound warning, forecasting and early diagnosis systems, where feasible, as well as the use of advice from professionally qualified advisors’. To advance this step for D. gallinae  we  developed  and  demonstrated  an  operational  model,  forecasting  the  mite population dynamics and evaluating and forecasting the effect of a treatment application for D. gallinae in laying hen facilities. For IPM this model and the required inputs need to be 1) labour‐extensive with minimal staff input, preferably automatically implementing “real time” measurement   data   into   models;    2)    operational,   providing   easily   interpretable  data, forecasting pest population dynamics and the moment a threshold will be exceeded; 3) able to  compensate  for  different  locations  and  time‐specific‐interactions  and  variables (e. g. management and temperature), enabling the handling of variability of the parameters of interest; 4) able to identify pest hotspots; 5) able to estimate and forecast treatment efficacy; and   6)  applicable  for  different  monitoring  methods  and  therefore  able  to  correct  for monitoring  measurement  errors.  Prior  to  the  development  of  the  population  dynamics model a high variation in population growth was found which could be only partly explained by temperature, flock age, treatment, and compartment/laying hen facility. A substantial part of the total variation remained unexplained, or was found to be temporal. As a result of this   partly  temporal  variation,   a  dynamic  approach  was   suggested  to   improve   the forecasting quality of a population dynamics model. With the input of population monitoring data,   temperature   data   and   information   of   the   dates   of   any   D.  gallinae   treatment interventions, the developed model was able to forecast the population dynamics of D. gallinae post treatment and without treatment while compensating for location and time specific interactions, handling the variability of the parameters. Moreover, this population dynamics model was able to forecast the D. gallinae population using data from different monitoring methods. Together with the models compatibility with different housing systems and its ability to forecast the mite population dynamics (requiring only three relative easy obtainable parameters), this model is an improvement over existing approaches for forecasting D. gallinae that could contribute to steps 2 and 8 of IPM for D. gallinae in laying hen facilities. The results from this study directly facilitate advanced IPM programmes for D. gallinae in laying facilities. The new ‘products’ developed are tools for prevention, monitoring, forecasting population dynamics and evaluating treatment effects, representing the requirements of IPM steps 1, 2, and 8. Indirectly the results may accelerate the development of new control measures, with knowledge acquired through use of the developed products it also is likely to contribute to IPM steps 3, 4, 6 and 8 in the future; e. g. the determination of an action threshold, and a tool advising farmers on the most effective and economic time for applying a corrective action or hotspot treatment for D. gallinae.   With the obtained knowledge and new products implemented to control D. gallinae in laying hen farms, major advances can be made in IPM for this pest. More specifically, as a result of this work IPM for D. gallinae in laying hen facilities can be advanced by the identification of preventative control measures, the development of an automated monitoring tool and a model forecasting mite population dynamics and evaluating applied treatments. Consequently, the results of this study can be expected to improve hen health, welfare and farm economics for the egg production industry. In the future, advances in other IPM programmes can be expected when the obtained knowledge, tools and methods are transferred to other pest species in multiple sectors...|$|R

Odors from swine facilities comprise hundreds of chemicals, including volatile organic compounds (VOC), ammonia (NH₃), and hydrogen sulfide (H₂S). The medians of emission rates from swine houses in literature are 5 OU/s/pig for odor, and 0. 4, 2. 8, and 0. 1 kg/yr/pig for VOC, NH₃, and H₂S respectively. The medians of emission rates from swine manure storage facilities in literature are 5 OU/s/m 2 for odor, and 1. 4, 2. 1, and 0. 2 kg/yr/pig for VOC, NH₃, and H₂S, respectively. Facility maintenance and management practices to reduce impact of odor are reviewed in regard to regular cleaning of facilities, ventilation, floor design, drainage and <b>manure</b> <b>removal</b> systems, frequent <b>manure</b> <b>removal,</b> manure storage, and odor separation distances. Approaches to control odor and air pollution can be classified into three categories: ration/diet modification, manure treatment, capture/treatment of emitted gases and enhanced dispersion. Each of these mitigation approaches includes several specific technologies, which are summarized in tables with an evaluation of overall cost and brief comments on advantages or limitations of each technology. Diet modification strategies have been shown to reduce NH₃ emissions effectively with low cost and should be considered as a best management practices, although their effectiveness in reducing odor is still uncertain. Permeable covers and biofilters seem to have great potential to be the most promising and cost effective technologies for manure storage facilities and swine houses respectively. However, both of the technologies need careful maintenance to perform effectively. Care must be taken to select technologies that are compatible with the management capabilities of the operation to prevent potential failure due to mismanagement...|$|E
