2500|$|While Zen and the Art of <b>Motorcycle</b> <b>Maintenance,</b> by Robert M. Pirsig, was a 1974 bestseller, it in {{fact has}} little to do with Zen as a {{religious}} practice, nor with <b>motorcycle</b> <b>maintenance</b> for that matter. Rather it deals with the notion of the metaphysics of [...] "quality" [...] from the point of view of the main character. Pirsig was attending the Minnesota Zen Center at the time of writing the book. He has stated that, despite its title, the book [...] "should in no way be associated with that great body of factual information relating to orthodox Zen Buddhist practice". Though it may not deal with orthodox Zen Buddhist practice, Pirsig's book in fact deals with many of the more subtle facets of Zen living and Zen mentality without drawing attention to any religion or religious organization.|$|R

40|$|An {{adequate}} {{supply of}} {{safe drinking water}} is one of major ways to obtain healthy life. Water filter system {{is one way to}} improve the water quality. However, to maintain the performance of the system, it need to undergo the <b>maintenance</b> <b>service.</b> This study evaluate the requirement of <b>maintenance</b> <b>service</b> in water filter system. Water quality was measured before and after <b>maintenance</b> <b>service.</b> Parameters measured were pH, turbidity, residual chlorine, nitrate and heavy metals and these parameters were compared with National Drinking Water Quality Standards. Collection of data were involved three housing areas in Johor. The quality of drinking water from water filter system were analysed using pH meter, turbidity meter, DR 6000 and Inductively Coupled Plasma-Mass Spectrometer. pH value was increased from 16. 4 % for before <b>maintenance</b> <b>services</b> to 30. 7 % for after <b>maintenance</b> <b>service.</b> Increment of removal percentage for turbidity, residual chlorine and nitrate after maintenance were 21. 5, 13. 6 and 26. 7, respectively. This result shows that <b>maintenance</b> <b>service</b> enhance the performance of the system. However, less significant of <b>maintenance</b> <b>service</b> for enhance the removal of heavy metals which the increment of removal percentage in range 0. 3 to 9. 8.

40|$|The {{field of}} {{industrial}} maintenance management is evolving constantly, as {{the trend of}} servitization and outsourcing of support <b>services</b> affect <b>maintenance</b> operations. In-house maintenance organizations have moved at least partly towards inter-organizational relationships in different company networks (consisting of customer companies, service providers and equipment providers). Hand in hand with structural change, new valuecreating opportunities have emerged. Equipment providers enter the service market {{more and more often}} to level out cyclical changes in equipment sales. In addition, an increasing number of companies that focus primarily on <b>maintenance</b> <b>services</b> have entered the market (often as a result of outsourced in-house operations). The purpose of this thesis is to clarify the nature of <b>maintenance</b> <b>service</b> value and capture the different value creation strategies in service networks. First, the study identifies what the value creating elements and features in industrial <b>maintenance</b> <b>services</b> are. Second, the study explores how <b>maintenance</b> <b>service</b> operations are currently managed. Thirdly, the thesis studies what the prerequisites for successful <b>maintenance</b> <b>service</b> networks are. The thesis employs the mixed methods approach where both quantitative and qualitative methods are used in the empirical part of the research. The survey method is utilized for quantitative data collection in order to decipher the complex nature of <b>maintenance</b> <b>service</b> value. After quantitative analysis, a qualitative case study is used to explain the identified value creation strategies and the role of networks in value creation further. The findings of this thesis indicate that successful <b>maintenance</b> <b>service</b> networks are created stagewise by utilizing comprehensive value creation capabilities. The thesis offers three main contributions to the field. First, it presents a framework for successful <b>maintenance</b> <b>service</b> networks where different value creation strategies at different relationship and offering levels in <b>maintenance</b> <b>service</b> networks are identified. Second, it provides a multidimensional value construct where the comprehensive value of <b>maintenance</b> <b>services</b> is presented. Thirdly, the findings highlight that non-financial value elements become critical when aiming at more collaborative <b>maintenance</b> <b>service</b> networks...|$|R

5000|$|In 1974, Pirsig {{was awarded}} a Guggenheim Fellowship {{to allow him to}} write a follow-up, Lila: An Inquiry into Morals (1991), in which he {{developed}} a value-based metaphysics, Metaphysics of Quality, that challenges our subject-object view of reality.

5000|$|It {{has been}} noted that Pirsig’s Romantic/Classical {{dichotomy}} resembles Nietzsche’s Dionysian/Apollonian dichotomy as described in The Birth of Tragedy. For example, in his book The Person of the Therapist, Edward Smith writes, “In his popular novel, Zen and the Art of <b>Motorcycle</b> <b>Maintenance,</b> Robert Pirsig (1974) also addressed the Apollonian and Dionysian worldviews, naming them respectively classical understanding and romantic understanding.” ...|$|R

50|$|Historically, <b>motorcycle</b> <b>maintenance</b> was a {{necessary}} skill for riders, since the materials and technology used in motorcycles often meant that repairs {{had to be done}} on the road-side miles from home.
