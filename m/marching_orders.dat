25|$|Archduke Charles {{hoped that}} 19 April {{would bring a}} great success. His orders for that morning were for {{the center of his}} army to attack Davout in an effort to trap the French III Corps against the Danube. By a stroke of luck Charles {{obtained}} a copy of Davout's <b>marching</b> <b>orders</b> for the 19th. By 5:00 AM, the Austrian commander issued the <b>marching</b> <b>orders</b> for the day from his headquarters in Rohr in Niederbayern. Charles directed three major columns to intercept the French. He sent the right and center columns northeast toward Langquaid. From there, the right column would pass near Eckmühl (Eggmühl) and turn north for Regensburg where it would rendezvous with General-Major Peter von Vécsey's II Armeekorps brigade. The center column would guide left in the direction of Dünzling. Charles instructed the left column to march via Bachel, Hausen, Teugn, and Bad Abbach.|$|E

This match was {{second only to}} the encounter between the Netherlands and Portugal (which had four, as well as 16 yellows). A Croatian player was also sent off after having (mistakenly) been given three yellow cards by referee Graham Poll.|$|E

During the campaign, Hill became involved in several minor disputes with Jackson concerning Jackson's <b>marching</b> <b>orders</b> to Hill.|$|E

25|$|The {{regiment}} {{was organized}} at Centralia, Illinois, and mustered in for one-hundred day service on June 1, 1864. In early June, they received <b>marching</b> <b>orders</b> to proceed by rail to Cairo, Illinois, {{from where they}} sailed with Fort Pillow as the boat's destination. On the regiment's arrival at Columbus, Kentucky, information that General Nathan Bedford Forrest would attack Fort Pillow {{was found to be}} incorrect. General Forrest's target was Columbus, an attack which didn't eventuate. The regiment remained there and performed garrison duty until September 26.|$|E

On 13 September he put the visiting team ahead at Real Madrid after heading home a corner kick from Koke, in an eventual 2–1 win. In the reverse fixture on 7 February 2015, he opened the scoring in a 4–0 success; 18 days later, he received his <b>marching</b> <b>orders</b> in the 0–1 away loss to Bayer 04 Leverkusen in {{the first leg of}} the last-16 of the Champions League.|$|E
25|$|In {{the summer}} of 1805, the Grande Armée lay in its camps on the English Channel. Napoleon planned for the Grande Armée to march to the Rhine, then execute a vast right wheel from the Rhine to the Danube, picking up his 25,000 Bavarian allies on the way. Meanwhile, Marshal André Masséna with 50,000 troops would hold Archduke Charles in {{northern}} Italy, assisted by 20,000 reinforcements from central Italy led by General of Division Laurent Gouvion Saint-Cyr. Marshal Guillaume Marie Anne Brune would remain on the northern coast of France with 30,000 soldiers. Napoleon issued his <b>marching</b> <b>orders</b> on 26 August.|$|E

If this is the case, both orders exceed the recommended load limit set by the US Army Field Manual.|$|R
50|$|Orders are {{executed}} {{in a specific}} order, with each player alternating executing an order of a particular type. The order of play follows the order of House marks on the Iron Throne Influence track. First, players alternate executing any Raid orders in play, and then players alternate executing <b>March</b> <b>orders.</b> If a player uses a <b>March</b> <b>order</b> to move units into a region occupied by another player's units, a battle is initiated.|$|R
25|$|There {{was also}} a desire {{on the part of}} Soviet {{officials}} to forestall any evacuations until it was absolutely necessary, the <b>marching</b> <b>orders</b> were often to continue factory production until the eve of occupation before hurriedly dismantling and transporting factory equipment, and destroying what couldn't be moved in time. As a result of the delay in evacuations, they were often carried out under German aerial bombardment, which led to additional confusion among the frightened citizenry. Historian Rebecca Manley describes these early evacuations as being charactered by “three phenomena: the 'flight' of officials, the flight of the population, and 'panic'”.|$|E
25|$|About 1978, Cursor went in a {{different}} direction. First, models of contemporary trucks, mostly Mercedes-Benzes, started to appear. Secondly, these were now often diecast in zamac. Then, similar to NZG Models and Conrad Models three or four Mercedes-Benz sedans (the 230, 200, and 190) and the Gelandewagen SUV were introduced in 1:35 scale (Force 1990, 124-127; Gardiner and O'Neill 1996, p. 76). This marked Cursor's main focus on the production of miniatures mainly for promotional purposes. Apparently all three companies were taking similar <b>marching</b> <b>orders</b> from Mercedes-Benz on how the company wanted its promotional models standardized. A BMW 3 series coupe also was made by Cursor in the 1:35 scale. As was typical models usually had opening doors with tilting seats and realistic rubber tires (Gardiner and O'Neill 1996, p. 76).|$|E
25|$|It {{was under}} Ince that Blackpool made their best-ever start to a League season. Their victory at Bournemouth on 14 September 2013 gave them sixteen points {{out of a}} {{possible}} eighteen. The sequence of results was two wins, a draw, and three wins. This was countered by a run of nine defeats in ten games, which resulted in Ince being sacked on 21 January 2014, eleven months into his tenure. Assistant managers Alex Rae and Steve Thompson were also given their <b>marching</b> <b>orders.</b> Then-club captain Barry Ferguson was appointed caretaker-manager {{until the end of the}} campaign, but the club could muster only three further victories in the remaining twenty games. They finished 20th, avoiding relegation by two points. Tom Ince remained the club's top goalscorer, with seven goals, despite having gone on loan to Crystal Palace after his father's dismissal just over three months earlier.|$|E

25|$|Cole {{signed with}} LA Galaxy of Major League Soccer on 27 January 2016. On 24 February, {{he made his}} debut in a goalless home draw against Santos Laguna in the CONCACAF Champions League; on 6 March, he made his league debut {{in the first game}} of the 2016 season, playing the full 90 minutes of a 4–1 win over D.C. United at the StubHub Center. Manager Bruce Arena praised Cole and fellow veteran new signing Nigel de Jong after the result. On 1 May, he was sent off for a second booking in a 1–1 draw at Sporting Kansas City. Cole was ejected {{following}} a clumsy tackle on Benny Feilhaber after being cautioned just 32 seconds earlier. He received his second dismissal of the season on 25 June in the match against San Jose Earthquakes. Cole had been booked for a reckless tackle and as emotions were high, a melee ensued. The referee deemed Cole's reaction worthy of another booking and as a result he received his <b>marching</b> <b>orders</b> for the second time in eight league games.|$|E
25|$|Amelia's father, John Sedley, becomes bankrupt. George's rich father forbids George {{to marry}} Amelia, {{who is now}} poor. Dobbin persuades George to marry Amelia, and George is {{consequently}} disinherited. News arrives that Napoleon has escaped from Elba, so George Osborne, William Dobbin and Rawdon Crawley are deployed to Brussels, accompanied by Amelia and Becky, and Amelia's brother, Jos. George is embarrassed by the vulgarity of Mrs. Major O'Dowd, {{the wife of the}} head of the regiment. Already, the newly wedded Osborne is growing tired of Amelia, and he becomes increasingly attracted to Becky, which makes Amelia jealous and unhappy. He is also losing money to Rawdon at cards and billiards. At a ball in Brussels, George gives Becky a note inviting her to run away with him. But then the army have <b>marching</b> <b>orders</b> to the Battle of Waterloo, and George spends a tender night with Amelia and leaves. The noise of battle horrifies Amelia, and she is comforted by the brisk but kind Mrs. O'Dowd. Becky is indifferent and makes plans for whatever the outcome (if Napoleon wins, she would aim to become the mistress of one of his Marshals...). She also makes a profit selling her carriage and horses at inflated prices to Jos, seeking to flee Brussels.|$|E
25|$|The {{fate of the}} semi finalists {{rested on}} the return leg {{encounter}} in Goa. The match started off with nerves on both sides forcing rookie mistakes in both camps. It was however the visitors Aizawl, who drew first blood, all thanks to their wonderman Joel Sunday who put them ahead in the 37th minute. The 1–0 lead meant Aizawl had an away goal advantage and Sporting Goa would have to score two to progress into the final. The Goans however got their rescue act in place, seconds away from the lemon break whistle. A Sumit Passi header found {{the back of the}} net to draw Sporting Clube de Goa to level terms. The visitors however made the Goan recovery more difficult after the referee awarded a penalty to the highlanders as their captain David Lalrinmuana was tripped in the box by a Sporting Goa defender. Lalchawnkima made no mistake in finding the net from the penalty spot to give Aizawl a 2–1 lead. In the 80th minute however, a butter finger moment from Aizawl goalkeeper Soram Poirei saw him push an easy shot right onto Glan Martins' boots. The forward made no mistake in scoring from close range to draw the Goans 2–2. Sporting Goa however needed another goal to advance to the final. They had their best chance in injury time, but Sumit Passi failed to tap in an easy ball into an open net. The ending however was not very happy for the visitors. Aizawl captain David Lalrinmuana was given the <b>marching</b> <b>orders</b> by the referee when he tried to delay a free-kick from being taken. This made the vital midfielder unavailable for the all important final encounter. The match finished 2–2 on the night and the same on aggregate seeing Aizawl go through to the final having two more away goals than their opponents.|$|E

[...] Webb felt that unlike the scientifically inclined Peter, Uncle Ben represented the blue-collar working man, a gap that could create a dynamic between the characters.|$|E
500|$|During the American Civil War, {{music played}} a {{prominent}} role {{on both sides of}} the conflict: Union and Confederate. On the American Civil War battlefield, different instruments including bugles, drums, and fifes were played to issue <b>marching</b> <b>orders</b> or sometimes simply to boost the morale of one's fellow soldiers. Singing was also employed as a recreational activity but as a release from the inevitable tensions that come with fighting in a war, particularly a war in which the issue of freedom of a race is to be decided. In camp, music was a diversion away from the bloodshed, helping the soldiers deal with homesickness and boredom. [...] Soldiers of both sides often engaged in recreation with musical instruments, and when the opposing armies were near each other, sometimes the bands from both sides of the conflict played against each other on the night before a battle.|$|E

500|$|The whole {{song was}} written without that main sample; {{it was a}} last-minute thing. The song had kind {{of a lot of}} R music in it. And Kanye gave <b>marching</b> <b>orders</b> of [...] "Take out {{anything}} you want, but don't add. Just take away." [...] Like, [...] "OK." [...] And before that, we listened to the sample together and thought, [...] "Hmm, maybe there's a way to integrate this into the song." [...] So we started by getting the sample to work in the song, and then taking out as much stuff as we could, and then in the chorus reducing what was this whole musical thing, just this sort of one ugly, distorted bass note. I was thinking like Alan Vega and Suicide, that kind of noise-synth minimal vibe. So that was the idea behind the chorus: Take it from this sort of R thing and turn it into this kind of post-punk, edge thing. And the lyrics he wrote were so good and funny. It just turned into a really good record. The sample is so good.|$|E
