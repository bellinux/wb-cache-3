50|$|The <b>Mucambo</b> <b>virus</b> (subtype III) {{appears to}} have evolved ~1807 AD (95% {{credible}} interval: 1559-1944). In Venezuela the Mucambo subtype was identified in 1975 by Jose Esparza and J. Sánchez using cultured mosquito cells.|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn the 1950 s and 1960 s, alphaviruses in the Venezuelan equine {{encephalitis}} (VEE) antigenic complex {{were the most}} frequently isolated arboviruses in Trinidad. Since then, there has been very little research performed with these viruses. Herein, {{we report on the}} isolation, sequencing, and phylogenetic analyses of <b>Mucambo</b> <b>virus</b> (MUCV; VEE complex subtype IIIA), including 6 recently isolated from Culex (Melanoconion) portesi mosquitoes and 11 previously isolated in Trinidad and Brazil. Results show that nucleotide and amino acid identities across the complete structural polyprotein for the MUCV isolates were 96. 6 – 100 % and 98. 7 – 100 %, respectively, and the phylogenetic tree inferred for MUCV was highly geographically- and temporally-structured. Bayesian analyses suggest that the sampled MUCV lineages have a recent common ancestry of approximately 198  years (with a 95 % highest posterior density (HPD) interval of 63 – 448  years) prior to 2007, and an overall rate of evolution of 1. 28 × 10 − 4 substitutions/site/yr...|$|E
40|$|AbstractMembers of {{the genus}} Alphavirus are {{a diverse group of}} principally mosquito-borne RNA viruses. There are at least 29 species and many more subtypes of alphaviruses and some are {{considered}} potential bioweapons. We have developed a multi-locus RT-PCR followed by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (RT-PCR/ESI-MS) assay that uses the amplicon base compositions to detect and identify alphaviruses. A small set of primer pairs targeting conserved sites in the alphavirus RNA genome were used to amplify a panel of 36 virus isolates representing characterized Old World and New World alphaviruses. Base compositions from the resulting amplicons could be used to unambiguously determine the species or subtype of 35 of the 36 isolates. The assay detected, without culture, Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV), Eastern equine encephalitis virus (EEEV), and mixtures of both in pools consisting of laboratory-infected and -uninfected mosquitoes. Further, the assay was used to detect alphaviruses in naturally occurring mosquito vectors collected from locations in South America and Asia. Mosquito pools collected near Iquitos, Peru, were found to contain an alphavirus with a very distinct signature. Subsequent sequence analysis confirmed that the virus {{was a member of the}} <b>Mucambo</b> <b>virus</b> species (subtype IIID in the VEEV complex). The assay we have developed provides a rapid, accurate, and high-throughput assay for surveillance of alphaviruses...|$|E
40|$|Specific and {{sensitive}} reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) assays were {{developed for the}} detection of eastern, western, and Venezuelan equine encephalitis viruses (EEE, WEE, and VEE, respectively). Tests for specificity included all known alphavirus species. The EEE-specific RT-PCR amplified a 464 -bp region of the E 2 gene exclusively from 10 different EEE strains from South and North America with a sensitivity of about 3, 000 RNA molecules. In a subsequent nested PCR, the specificity was confirmed by the amplification of a 262 -bp fragment, increasing the sensitivity of this assay to approximately 30 RNA molecules. The RT-PCR for WEE amplified a fragment of 354 bp from as few as 2, 000 RNA molecules. Babanki virus, as well as <b>Mucambo</b> and Pixuna <b>viruses</b> (VEE subtypes IIIA and IV), were also amplified. However, the latter viruses showed slightly smaller fragments of about 290 and 310 bp, respectively. A subsequent seminested PCR amplified a 195 -bp fragment only from the 10 tested strains of WEE from North and South America, rendering this assay virus specific and increasing its sensitivity to approximately 20 RNA molecules. Because the 12 VEE subtypes showed too much divergence in their 26 S RNA nucleotide sequences to detect all of them by the use of nondegenerate primers, this assay was confined to the medically important and closely related VEE subtypes IAB, IC, ID, IE, and II. The RT-PCR–seminested PCR combination specifically amplified 342 - and 194 -bp fragments of the region covering the 6 K gene in VEE. The sensitivity was 20 RNA molecules for subtype IAB virus and 70 RNA molecules for subtype IE virus. In addition to the subtypes mentioned above, three of the enzootic VEE (subtypes IIIB, IIIC, and IV) showed the specific amplicon in the seminested PCR. The practicability of the latter assay was tested with human sera gathered as part of the febrile illness surveillance in the Amazon River Basin of Peru near the city of Iquitos. All of the nine tested VEE-positive sera showed the expected 194 -bp amplicon of the VEE-specific RT-PCR–seminested PCR...|$|R
40|$|The blood {{feeding of}} a {{population}} of Cx. nigripalpus from Parque Ecológico do Tietê (PET) was investigated using an indirect ELISA protocol. Mosquitoes were captured outside houses. Five hundred sixteen engorged females collected in a reforested area and 25 in an open area were tested. Rodents and dogs were the most common blood sources, accounting for approximately 65. 3 % of blood meals. Human blood was detected in 10. 9 %, dog blood in 26. 1 %, chicken blood in 2. 4 %, and rodent blood in 39. 2 % of the 541 insects tested. ELISA failed in identifying the blood sources of 233 engorged females, indicating that the mosquitoes may have fed on a host which was not tested. One hundred six individuals were positive {{for more than one}} host. The unweighted human blood index was 0. 14 and the rodent/human, human/chicken, and dog/rodent feeding index values were 2. 70, 1. 51, and 1. 33, respectively. Furthermore, rodents are defensive hosts for this haematophagous insect which looks for another host to complete blood-feeding. Considering that rodents are potential reservoirs for <b>Mucambo</b> <b>virus</b> and Saint Louis encephalitis virus and that Cx. nigripalpus feed on the blood of those mammals, we hypothesize that mosquito population in PET could participate in the transmission cycle of those arboviruses. Additionally, this species might be involved in the transmission of Dirofilaria immitis to dogs at this area...|$|E

O hábito alimentar da população de Cx. nigripalpus do Parque Ecológico do Tietê (PET) foi investigado usando um protocolo de ELISA indireto. Foram testadas 516 e 25 fêmeas ingurgitadas e capturadas, respectivamente, em áreas reflorestadas e abertas. Roedores e canídeos foram fontes alimentares mais freqüentes, em aproximadamente 65. 3 % dos repastos sangüíneos. De um total de 541 fêmeas ingurgitadas, foram detectadas freqüências de repastos sangüíneos em humanos (10. 9 %), canídeos (26. 1 %), galinídeos (2. 4 %) e roedores (39. 2 %). As fontes alimentares de 233 fêmeas ingurgitadas (43. 1 %) não foram identificadas, indicando que essas fêmeas se alimentaram possivelmente de outros hospedeiros não testados. Ainda, houve 106 indivíduos (34. 4 %) que fizeram múltiplos repastos sangüíneos. O valor do índice de repastos sangüíneos em humanos foi 0. 14 e as razões alimentares foram roedor/humano = 2. 70, humano/galinídeo = 1. 51 e canídeo/roedor = 1. 33. Os roedores são hospedeiros defensivos para esse inseto hematófago o qual não persiste nestes hospedeiros e procura outro para completar o repasto sangüíneo. Considerando que os roedores são reservatórios potenciais de arbovírus Mucambo e São Luís e que Cx. nigripalpus realiza repastos sanguíneos nesses mamíferos, propõe-se a hipótese de que a população deste moquito poderia participar do ciclo de transmissão desses arbovírus no PET. Adicionalmente, esta espécie poderá se envolver na transmissão de Dirofilaria immitis para canídeos neste parque...|$|E
