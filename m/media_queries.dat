The HTML4 Recommendation from 1997 shows an example of how <b>Media</b> <b>Queries</b> could be added in the future. In 2000, W3C started work on <b>Media</b> <b>Queries</b> and also on another scheme for supporting various devices: CC/PP. The two address the same problem, but CC/PP is server-centric, while <b>Media</b> <b>Queries</b> are browser-centric.

40|$|The paper {{discusses}} {{the design and}} prototype implementation of a QoS aware multimedia database system. Recent research in multimedia databases has devoted {{little attention to the}} aspect of the integration of QoS support at the user level. One common scenario which we are concerned with connects a user through a visual interface to a multitude of media object stores. The user demands satisfiability of a set of quality parameter bounds specified at query time or before (via user profile mappings). The user is not aware of detailed low-level QoS parameters but rather specifies high-level, qualitative attributes on the <b>media</b> <b>query.</b> Our proposed architecture to enable end-to-end QoS control, the QoS-Aware Query Processor (QuaSAQ), is motivated by query processing and optimization techniques in traditional database management systems. The proposed solution relies on mediation through several components (two of which are the QoP Browser and Quality Manager) that enable searching, locating, composing and presenting of multimedia objects with associated QoS constraints. In addition to an overview of key research issues, this paper also presents some of the proposed design solutions. One focus problem is how to evaluate the alternative plans for serving QoS-enhanced queries. We propose a novel cost model that explicitly takes the resource utilization of plans and the current system contention level into account. Experiments run on the QuaSAQ prototype show significantly improved QoS and throughput in <b>media</b> <b>query</b> processing...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} a visual <b>media</b> <b>querying</b> scheme {{referred to as}} Transform-Based Layered Query (TLQ) Scheme. The TLQ scheme mainly aims at decreasing retrieval processing time and run-time memory consumption without degrading layers in indexing and retrieval phases, where each indexing layer corresponds to a retrieval layer. The layers are constructed based on transformations for reducing visual frame and feature data dimensions. The proposed TLQ scheme also involves an unsupervised method for eliminating irrelevant media items between the retrieval layers. A two-layer TLQ system is implemented and integrated into MUVIS content-based multimedia indexing and retrieval framework, and its theoretical advantages are verified with dedicated experiments on image and video databases. The experiments reveal that 75 % retrieval performance improvement in terms of process time can be achieved depending on transformation parameters. Keywords—content-based indexing and retrieval; retrieval optimization; query system. I...|$|R
