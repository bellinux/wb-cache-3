40|$|This paper {{presents}} description, classification, and geological {{setting of}} impact glasses, which are {{formed as a}} result of meteorite impacts with the planetary surface, and discusses the impact-glass formation process in the context of cratering mechanics. Impact glasses can be classified as belonging to two major groups: (1) <b>mineral</b> <b>glasses,</b> which are identical in composition to a mineral, and (2) rock glasses, which have the composition of a rock or a mixture of various rocks. Rock glasses may be (1) melt ejecta, (2) parts of a coherent melt layer inside the crater cavity, or (3) dikes or veins. The composition of rock glasses at a particular crater can be matched by that of the target. In nonporous rocks, the formation of rock glasses requires peak pressures in excess of 60 - 80 GPa, while <b>mineral</b> <b>glasses</b> are formed in the pressure range of about 25 to 55 GPa; in porous rocks, interstitial glass forms at pressures as low as 5 GPa...|$|R

In 1969, it produced the Speedmaster Professional Mk II, with shrouded lugs and a flat, anti-reflective <b>mineral</b> <b>glass</b> crystal. In 1970, Omega launched the Alaska Project under Pierre Chopard, which changed the dial of the original Speedmaster Professional from black to white and created a removable anodized aluminum housing to shield the watch from {{a wider range of}} temperatures. In 1971 and 1973, Omega turned to automatic mechanisms on the Speedmaster Automatic MkIII and MkIV models alongside Speedsonic Electronic Chronometer Chronograph (marketing as a Speedmaster) other non-Speedmaster Chronographs such as the Omega Bullhead. However none of these proved as popular or long-lasting as the basic Speedmaster Professional [...] "Moon watch". A variety of other types of watches have used the Speedmaster brand, including many different automatic day and day-date models, the tuning fork movement Speedsonic line, and the digital LCD Speedmaster Quartz (the Speedsonic and LCD Speedmaster where also prototyped in ten examples each under the Alaska project but not taken up by NASA).

40|$|The carbon {{contents}} of various lunar soil particle types and sieve fractions of Apollo 15 and 16 samples have been {{determined by the}} pyrolysis method. The <b>mineral,</b> <b>glass,</b> and high-grade breccia fragments in the soils examined contain relatively low amounts of carbon (approximately 8, 25, and 25 microg C/g sample respectively in 149 - 250 micron grains).

The distribution of carbon with respect to particle size in mature soils generally reveals a minimum in carbon content at about 100 micron particle diameter. At smaller particle diameters, carbon content is directly proportional to particle surface area and therefore increases with the ratio (surface area) /(particle mass).

40|$|International audienceThe Alban Hills {{volcanic}} region (20 km {{south of}} Rome, in the Roman Province) emitted a {{large volume of}} potassic magmas (> 280 km 3) during the Quaternary. Chemical interactions between ascending magmas and the ~ 7000 - 8000 -m-thick sedimentary carbonate basement are documented by abundant high temperature skarn xenoliths in the eruptive products and have been frequently corroborated by geochemical surveys. In this paper we characterize the effect of carbonate assimilation on phase relationships at 200 MPa and 1150 - 1050 °C by experimental petrology. Calcite and dolomite addition promotes the crystallization of Ca-rich pyroxene and Mg-rich olivine respectively, and addition of both carbonates results in the desilication of the melt. Furthermore, carbonate assimilation liberates a large quantity of CO 2 -rich fluid. A comparison of experimental versus natural <b>mineral,</b> <b>glass</b> and bulk rock compositions suggests large variations {{in the degree of}} carbonate assimilation for the different Alban Hills eruptions. A maximum of 15 wt% assimilation is suggested by some melt inclusion and clinopyroxene compositions; however, most of the natural data indicate assimilation of between 3 and 12 wt% carbonate. Current high CO 2 emissions in this area most likely indicate that such an assimilation process still occurs at depth. We calculate that a magma intruding into the carbonate basement with a rate of ~ 1 - 2 • 106 m 3 /year, estimated by geophysical studies, and assimilating 3 - 12 wt% of host rocks would release an amount of CO 2 matching the current yearly emissions at the Alban Hills. Our results strongly suggest that present CO 2 emissions in this region are the shallow manifestation of hot mafic magma intrusion in the carbonate-hosted reservoir at 5 - 6 km depth, with important consequences for the present-day volcanic hazard evaluation in this densely populated and historical area...|$|E
40|$|Magmas {{erupted in}} intracontinental rifts {{typically}} form from melting of variable proportions of asthenospheric or lithospheric mantle sources and ascend through thick continental lithosphere. This ascent of magma {{is accompanied by}} differentiation and assimilation processes. Understanding the composition of rift-related intracontinental volcanism is important, particularly in densely populated active rift zones such as the Ohře (Eger) Rift in Central Europe. We have sampled and analysed nephelinites from Železná hůrka (Eisenbühl), the youngest (< 300 ka) Quaternary volcano related to the Ohře Rift where frequent earthquake swarms indicate continuing magmatic activity in the crust. This nephelinite volcano {{is part of a}} larger eruptive centre (Mýtina Maar) representing a single locality of recurrent volcanism in the Ohře Rift. We present a detailed petrographic, mineralogical and geochemical study (major and trace elements and Sr–Nd–Hf–O isotopes) of Železná hůrka to further resolve the magmatic history and mantle source of the erupted melt. We find evidence for a highly complex evolution of the nephelinitic melts during their ascent to the surface. Most importantly, mixing of melts derived from different sources and of strong chemical contrast controls the composition of the erupted volcanic products. These diverse parental melts originate from a highly metasomatized subcontinental lithospheric mantle (SCLM) source. We use a combined approach based on <b>mineral,</b> <b>glass</b> and whole-rock compositions to show that the mantle underneath the western Ohře Rift is metasomatized dominantly by carbonatitic melts. The nephelinites of Železná hůrka formed by interaction between a carbonatitic melt and residual mantle peridotite, partial crystallization in the lithospheric mantle and minor assimilation of upper continental crust. Thermobarometric estimates indicate that the stagnation levels of the youngest volcanism in this part of the Ohře Rift were deeper than the focal depths of recent earthquake swarms, indicating that those are not directly linked to magma ascent. Furthermore, close mineralogical and geochemical similarities between the Železná hůrka nephelinite and fresh kimberlites may point towards a genetic link between kimberlites, melilitites and nephelinites. 32 page(s...|$|E

40|$|Bentonites {{are used}} for various {{industrial}} applications. Their physicochemical properties depend on the mineralogical and chemical composition, the type of smectite, the grain size distribution, the cation exchange capacity (CEC), the dominant interlayer cation (Na+, Ca 2 +, Mg 2 +), and the layer charge density. All these parameters can be measured with acceptable precision. Nevertheless, {{the performance of a}} bentonite in a given application is often unpredictable. An additional relevant parameter is the "microfabric" describing the arrangement of minerals and/or the intergrowth of the <b>minerals</b> with <b>glass.</b> The microfabric is supposed to affect different bentonite properties such as swelling capacity and rheology. The present study focuses on the influence of different microfabrics on the abrasivity by bentonite dispersions. The abrasivity of bentonite dispersions mainly depended on two factors: 1) on the amount of hard and sharp accessory <b>minerals</b> and volcanic <b>glass</b> and 2) the grain size distribution, which was produced by different grinding techniques. The abrasivity increased with decreasing grain size, which was caused by breaking the hard components (<b>minerals</b> and <b>glass)</b> leading to an increased number of sharp edges. In addition, there was evidence for a subordinate influence of the type of exchangeable cations. This influence is explained by the different relative arrangements of smectite particles towards the surfaces of hard and sharp <b>minerals.</b> Na+ exchanged <b>glass</b> rich samples showed higher abrasion values than the Ca 2 + exchanged samples.
