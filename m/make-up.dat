5|$|The guest cast {{required}} {{a variety of}} levels of <b>make-up</b> to portray their alien characters. Combs' <b>make-up</b> took around {{three and a half}} hours each day, as did the Tellarite prosthetics. The Andorian female cast members took around four and a half hour each day to get into <b>make-up</b> and costume, but on the first day Brink required further <b>make-up</b> time as that day's shoot required her to appear in-character in her underwear. This meant that after the normal <b>make-up</b> schedule, she was sprayed blue from head to toe. At the end of that day's filming, the shower facilities at the studio's executive gym was used to remove the paint. Meanwhile, the Romulan <b>make-up</b> took three hours to apply, with all the relevant scenes completed in a single day.|$|E

5|$|Allen {{recalled}} The Original Series, {{and said}} that she was pleased to be remembered as an Orion slave girl. However, she was not pleased with the <b>make-up</b> process which took between four and five hours to apply, and required each actress to be sprayed with green <b>make-up</b> over their whole body. Removal of the makeup was via the showers in the Paramount lot's executive gym. The <b>make-up</b> team also needed to apply fake sweat and bruises to other members of the cast to represent the results of the increased aggression shown by them in the episode's plot.|$|E
5|$|I {{actually}} wrote a {{song about}} it on my album, it's called 'GUY' and it stands for 'Go Under You'. So wearing <b>make-up,</b> smelling delicious and having suckable, kissable, edible things between your limbs is something I find strengthening because I know that when I pick the right guy, I can let him have it. Some women feel oppressed by <b>make-up</b> and clothing, and here’s to them, they {{have every right to}} feel that way as well.|$|E
5|$|<b>Make-up</b> {{supervisor}} Michael Westmore {{created the}} look of the Bynars, who were four women in extensive <b>make-up.</b> The musical score was scored by Ron Jones.

500|$|The <b>Make-Up's</b> first {{release in}} 1995 was [...] "Blue is Beautiful", a 7-inch single {{released}} on the band's own Black Gemini Records–a label which only released {{a handful of}} the <b>Make-Up's</b> releases, many of which used a characteristically simple single-color album sleeve. Their second and third releases were also 7-inch singles: a split with the Meta-Matics, again on Black Gemini, and another split with Slant 6 on Time Bomb Records.|$|R
5|$|Makeup artist Jack Pierce {{and special}} effects {{supervisor}} John P. Fulton worked together closely, especially on Holden's <b>make-up</b> design. They combined special lighting with a greyish-green <b>make-up</b> for Holden's final scenes, creating a pallor that {{contrasted with the}} more normally flesh-toned make-ups of {{the others in the}} scene. Heinz Roemheld composed the score and Albert S. D'Agostino redressed Charles D. Hall's set of Dracula's castle and created new sets including a London bridge, the moor where Dracula's body is burned and Countess Zaleska's apartment.|$|E
5|$|Runnels was {{originally}} a <b>make-up</b> artist for CNN from 1985 to 1991, {{where she worked}} on Larry King's <b>make-up.</b> On the weekends, she did makeup for the wrestlers of Jim Crockett Promotions (JCP). When the company was purchased by Ted Turner in 1988 and renamed World Championship Wrestling (WCW), she moved to Atlanta and continued doing <b>make-up</b> {{for some of the}} wrestlers. Booker Ole Anderson eventually asked her {{to become part of the}} roster as a manager. Runnels debuted in 1990 as Alexandra York, a laptop-carrying accountant who led an alliance known as the York Foundation, a group of wrestlers with finance-themed gimmicks. The York character was created over a lunch with Tony Schiavone, one of WCW's announcers. She worked at WCW for two years.|$|E
5|$|The <b>make-up</b> for Citizen Kane {{was created}} and applied by Maurice Seiderman (1907–1989), a junior {{member of the}} RKO <b>make-up</b> department. Seiderman's family came to the United States from Russia in 1920, {{escaping}} persecution. As a child Seiderman had won a drawing competition and received an apprenticeship at the Moscow Art Theatre, where {{his father was a}} wigmaker and <b>make-up</b> artist. In New York his uncle was a theatrical scenic painter, and he helped Seiderman get into the union. He worked on Max Reinhardt's 1924 production of The Miracle and with the Yiddish Art Theatre, and he studied the human figure at the Art Students League of New York. After he moved to Los Angeles he was hired first by Max Factor and then by RKO. Seiderman had not been accepted into the union, which recognized him as only an apprentice, but RKO nevertheless used him to make up principal actors.|$|E

40|$|Archaeological cosmetics, {{as well as}} {{revealing}} ancient knowledge, {{contain a}} complex mixture of very different organic and inorganic components with diverse properties. Most information on the preparation of ancient cosmetics comes from classical texts. However, although analysis of products contained in archaeological objects has recently identified some ingredients, there is still little known about how the cosmetics were prepared. Using a multi-analytical approach, we studied the chemical composition of two Roman pink <b>make-ups</b> that were preserved {{on the surface of}} a Roman bronze cosmetic tool and in a glass unguentarium. The results revealed that both <b>make-ups</b> were colored by madder lake but prepared in two different ways and with two completely different matrices (i. e. scented oils in the first case and gypsum in the second) highlighting that the <b>make-ups</b> had been prepared thoroughly, the ingredients carefully selected and their properties and possibilities for good cosmetic use had been understood...|$|R

5|$|Cheri Montesanto-Medcalf and Matthew Mungle, the show's <b>make-up</b> effect producers, used several unorthodox {{ingredients}} {{to create the}} effect of melted flesh; {{in addition to the}} use of normal prosthetic <b>make-up,</b> the two also used a combination of figs and Fruit Roll-Ups. Several of the characters in the episode were named after real-life individuals. The characters of Hellura Lyle and Kai Bowe were named after two Writers Guild trainees on The X-Files staff who served during {{the first part of the}} eighth season. Furthermore, the character Steven Melnick is named after the Vice President of Media Relations for 20th Century Fox Television. Melnick had formerly served as the publicist for the series.|$|E

5|$|Effects artist Scott Stoddard {{described}} his look for Jason's face {{as a combination}} of Carl Fullerton's design for Friday the 13th Part 2 and Tom Savini's design for Friday the 13th: The Final Chapter. Stoddard's vision of Jason included hair loss, skin rashes, and the traditional deformities in his face. Stoddard tried to craft Jason's look so it would allow more human side of the character to be seen. Mears was required to wear full body <b>make-up</b> from the chest upwards while performing as Jason. The actor wore a chest plate with fake skin that would adjust to his muscle movements. He wore a hump on his back {{to give the impression}} that Jason had scoliosis. A prosthetic eye was glued to Mears' face to show realistic eye movements. Stoddard initially spent three-and-a-half hours applying the <b>make-up</b> to Mears' head and torso. He was eventually able to reduce the required time to just over an hour for scenes in which Mears wore the hockey mask. For scenes in which Jason's face is revealed, it took approximately four hours to apply the <b>make-up.</b>|$|E
5|$|Eventually she {{expanded}} beyond <b>make-up</b> artistry to {{body painting}} {{to express her}} own artistic vision. In August 1991, Demi Moore caused international artistic commotion by appearing {{on the cover of}} Vanity Fair seven months pregnant with her daughter Scout LaRue in the photo More Demi Moore, with Gair as the <b>make-up</b> artist and Annie Leibovitz as the photographer. Exactly one year later, she returned to the cover of the same magazine nude as a product of Gair and Leibovitz in a nearly equally as shocking body painting, Demi's Birthday Suit (pictured right). Gair was the primary body painter of this art and the magazine cover art propelled Gair to fame. Fifteen years later, it continues to be considered the most well-known example of modern body painting. The 1992 cover that entailed a thirteen-hour sitting for Gair and her team of <b>make-up</b> artists was a commemoration of the August 1991 photo. The shooting was storied because photographer Annie Leibovitz could not decide where to shoot and reserved two mobile homes, four hotel rooms and five houses. The pop culture attention given to Gair and her body painting led Absolut Vodka to consider an Absolut Gair body painting promotion in 1993.|$|E

5|$|Following {{issues with}} his <b>make-up</b> {{throughout}} the first season, Michael Dorn's Klingon prosthetics were modified.
