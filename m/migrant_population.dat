500|$|Dunstan was {{nominated}} as the Labor {{candidate for the}} electoral district of Norwood at the 1953 election.

It condemned the violence that resulted after the arrest that forced thousands of migrant workers to uproot themselves from various parts of Maharashtra. Loksatta criticised the television channels for their relentless replay of just two instances to portray the violent impact of his arrest. The edit blamed Hindi channels for making Mumbai look like Gujarat during the 2002 Gujarat riots. Another editor in the same daily also wrote that the [...] "Marathi andolan" [...] (Marathi demonstration) will not benefit any party, as the Marathi vote would be divided between the Shiv Sena and MNS.

2500|$|Language {{rights in}} the United States are usually derived from the Fourteenth Amendment, with its Equal Protection and Due Process Clauses, because they forbid racial and ethnic discrimination, {{allowing}} language minorities to use this Amendment to claim their language rights. One example of use of the Due Process Clauses is the Meyer v. Nebraska case which held that a 1919 Nebraska law restricting foreign-language education violated the Due Process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Two other cases of major importance to linguistic rights were the Yu Cong Eng v. Trinidad case, which overturned a language-restrictive legislation in the Philippines, declaring that piece of legislation to be [...] "violative of the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses of the Philippine Autonomy Act of Congress", {{as well as the}} Farrington v.

40|$|Migrants {{have been}} {{identified}} as being at greater risk for late HIV testing and diagnosis. Late diagnosis is of concern because timely diagnosis and initiation of treatment can both optimise health outcomes and reduce transmission. We reviewed and evaluated interventions that aimed to increase HIV testing uptake in <b>migrant</b> <b>populations.</b> Of 6511 papers retrieved, 10 met the inclusion criteria and were included in the review. Three types of interventions were identified (exposure to HIV prevention messages, HIV education programs, and direct offer of testing). All interventions were based on individual models of behaviour change targeting migrants or GPs. While important, interventions that also address broader health system and structural factors that contribute to late HIV-diagnosis in at-risk members of <b>migrant</b> <b>populations</b> are needed. Integrating PITC into existing primary healthcare settings shows promise of creating an enabling environment within patient-doctor relationships that can encourage HIV testing uptake among <b>migrant</b> <b>populations...</b>|$|R

Though {{there has been}} a decline in the dominance of Christianity through increased secularisation and the growing presence of an increasingly diverse <b>migrant</b> <b>population,</b> Sydney's two outspoken Archbishops, George Pell (Catholic) and Peter Jensen (Anglican) remain vocal in national debates and the hosting of Catholic World Youth Day 2008, led by Pope Benedict XVI, drew huge crowds of worshipers to the city.

2500|$|One {{group of}} special concern are work migrants, most often poor men, who leave the {{countryside}} to join the wage economy in towns and cities all over China. Some come from areas such as Henan Province where huge numbers of peasants were infected with HIV from scandalous plasma-donor practices in the 1990s. Many male migrants {{are at risk of}} unprotected sex when away from home. And men are also at higher risk of tuberculosis than women in China because the male-to-female ratio of adults with pulmonary tuberculosis is about 2:1 or more, reflecting a real risk excess rather than differential detection or notification. So several factors converge in young male migrant workers to put them at risk of both HIV and tuberculosis, and this convergence has been of great concern. With this [...] "floating" [...] <b>migrant</b> <b>population</b> making up 10% of the total being poorer and having more tuberculosis than average, China has far {{more than its share of}} tuberculosis (disease burden) in the world. This problem is compounded because China's internal work migrants often live and work in circumstances that promote transmission of tuberculosis and impede its diagnosis and treatment. They are usually so poor that the cost of adequate diagnosis and treatment is prohibitively expensive. Indeed, they may not be able to get treated at all unless they return to their home village in the poor interior, because subsidized management of tuberculosis (and other social welfare) is only available through facilities in the area where they were registered at birth. Those born in rural zones are not allowed to switch registration to become urban residents. They have been allowed to leave their area (temporarily) or work since 1992 and now number more than 100 million. China's rapid economic growth depends on them, but if they get tuberculosis, they have to return home for treatment.|$|E

40|$|Aims: Progress towards {{meeting the}} goal of measles {{elimination}} in the EU and the European Economic Area (EEA) by 2015 is being obstructed, as some children are either not immunized on time or never immunized. One group thought to be at increased risk of measles is migrants; however, {{the extent to which}} this is the case is poorly understood, {{due to a lack of}} data. This paper addresses this evidence gap by providing an overview of the burden of measles in <b>migrant</b> <b>populations</b> in the EU/EEA. Methods: Data were collected through a comprehensive literature review, a country survey of EU/EEA member states and information from measles experts gathered at an infectious disease workshop. Results: Our results showed incomplete data on measles in <b>migrant</b> <b>populations,</b> as national surveillance systems do not systematically record migration-specific information; however, evidence from the literature review and country survey suggested that some measles outbreaks in the EU/EEA were due to sub-optimal vaccination coverage in <b>migrant</b> <b>populations.</b> Conclusions: We conclude that it is essential that routine surveillance of measles cases and measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccination coverage become strengthened, to capture migrant-specific data. These data can help to inform the provision of preventive services, which may need to reach out to vulnerable <b>migrant</b> <b>populations</b> that currently face barriers in accessing routine immunization and health services...|$|R
