50|$|Pyrokinesis and thermokinesis - Unique to the 2013 movie, Carrie {{could also}} pyrokinetically, thermokinetically ignite objects. She {{initially}} displayed this ability by fusing the slide {{lock on the}} door to keep her mother locked in the prayer closet and also blowing cars up with her mind. While fire and explosions are seen in the book, Carrie only opens gasoline pumps and ruptures natural gas lines; the ignition source in every case is a cigarette carelessly discarded by another person. The 2002 movie hints at this ability but shows most fires started by sparking electrical equipment rather than pyrokinesis. This ability can be known as telekinetic destruction, <b>molecular</b> <b>manipulation,</b> spontaneous combustion, or telekinetic explosion.|$|E

40|$|Neurotransmitter {{release is}} {{modulated}} by many drugs and <b>molecular</b> <b>manipulations.</b> We present an active CMOS-based electrochemical biosensor array with high throughput capability (100 electrodes) for on-chip amperometric measurement of neurotransmitter release. The high-throughput of the biosensor array will accelerate {{the data collection}} needed to determine statistical significance of changes produced under varying conditions, from several weeks to a few hours. The biosensor is designed and fabricated {{using a combination of}} CMOS integrated circuit (IC) technology and a photolithography process to incorporate platinum working electrodes on-chip. We demonstrate the operation of an electrode array with integrated high-gain potentiostats and output time-division multiplexing with minimum dead time for readout. The on-chip working electrodes are patterned by conformal deposition of Pt and lift-off photolithography. The conformal deposition method protects the underlying electronic circuits from contact with the electrolyte that covers the electrode array during measurement. The biosensor was validated by simultaneous measurement of amperometric currents from 100 electrodes in response to dopamine injection, which revealed the time course of dopamine diffusion along the surface of the biosensor array. The biosensor simultaneously recorded neurotransmitter release successfully from multiple individual living chromaffin cells. The biosensor was capable of resolving small and fast amperometric spikes reporting release from individual vesicle secretions. We anticipate that this device will accelerate the characterization of the modulation of neurotransmitter secretion from neuronal and endocrine cells by pharmacological and <b>molecular</b> <b>manipulations</b> of the cells...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe proper {{intracellular}} {{distribution of}} mitochondria {{is assumed to}} be critical for normal physiology of neuronal cells, but direct evidence for this idea is lacking. Extension or movement of mitochondria into dendritic protrusions correlates with the development and morphological plasticity of spines. <b>Molecular</b> <b>manipulations</b> of dynamin-like GTPases Drp 1 and OPA 1 that reduce dendritic mitochondria content lead to loss of synapses and dendritic spines, whereas increasing dendritic mitochondrial content or mitochondrial activity enhances the number and plasticity of spines and synapses. Thus, the dendritic distribution of mitochondria is essential and limiting for the support of synapses. Reciprocally, synaptic activity modulates the motility and fusion/fission balance of mitochondria and controls mitochondrial distribution in dendrites...|$|R

5000|$|The {{development}} of new molecular tools including GFP, and major advances in imaging technology including fluorescence microscopy, have made possible the mapping of the cell lineage of Caenorhabditis elegans including its embryo. [...] This technique of fate mapping is used to study cells as they differentiate into their final cell fates. Merely observing a cell as it becomes differentiated during embryogenesis provides no indication of the mechanisms that drive the specification. Therefore, the addition of <b>molecular</b> <b>manipulation</b> techniques, including gene and protein knock downs, knock outs and overexpression, along with live cell imaging techniques has been transformational in understanding what mechanisms are involved with cell fate determination. [...] Transplantation experiments are commonly {{used in conjunction with}} the genetic manipulation and lineage tracing.

50|$|In {{addition}} to reality and <b>molecular</b> <b>manipulation,</b> Franklin has vast psionic powers that have manifested as telepathy, telekinesis, energy blasts of concussive force, precognition, and astral projection. Being a child, Franklin's abilities {{are restricted to}} an extent by his limited control. Moreover, it remains unclear what power levels Franklin will ultimately achieve as an adult, as several future incarnations from alternate realities {{as well as the}} mainstream Marvel universe have been shown to vary in power. One such manifestation of Franklin in adult form was able to destroy two Celestials from Earth-4280 during physical combat; in the aftermath of their defeat, Franklin's immortality was strongly implied.

5000|$|In season one, Michael has {{the same}} <b>{{molecular}}</b> <b>manipulation</b> and telekinetic skills {{as the rest of}} the hybrids, but openly states he cannot control them as well as Max and Isabel can. He tends to make things explode when he loses control or gets angry; this could be seen as a form of molecular combustion, and occasionally is seen to cause irritation to certain other people, causing them to itch. In the first season finale, he is taught to change his fingerprints into that of a dead agent and is shown firing energy blasts from his hands. This leads to friction with Max, as Michael sees himself as the [...] "bad guy" [...] and Max as the [...] "good guy". He has displayed some potential for superhuman strength, as shown in the episode [...] "285 South" [...] when he throws Kyle across the room but, it is possible that he simply manipulated his musculature or enhanced his attack with telekinesis.|$|E

40|$|Neural crest cells (NCCs) are a remarkable, dynamic {{group of}} cells that travel long {{distances}} in the embryo {{to reach their}} target sites.

Live imaging of NCCs as they traverse the embryo has been critical to increasing our knowledge of their biology. NCCs exhibit multiple behaviors and communicate with each other and their environment along each step of their journey.

40|$|Caenorhabditis elegans has a {{complete}} annotated genome sequence that is augmented by increasing quantities {{of data from}} high-throughput postgenomic analyses. This {{has led to an}} increasing need to identify the biological functions of specific genes using reverse genetics, i. e., moving from gene to phenotype. Fundamental to this aim is the ability to alter the structure of particular genes by means that are not accessible to classical genetic strategies. Thus, one dream of C. elegans researchers is to establish a toolkit for the controlled manipulation of any loci within the genome. Although C. elegans is amenable {{to a wide variety of}} genetic and <b>molecular</b> <b>manipulations,</b> controlled manipulation of endogenous genes by, for example, gene targeting has proved elusive until relatively recently. In this review, we describe and discuss the different methods available for the inactivation and modification of endogenous loci with a focus on strategies that permit some measure of control in this process. We describe methods that use random mutagenesis to isolate mutations in specific genes. We then focus on techniques that allow controlled manipulation of the genome: gene modification by transposon mobilisation, gene knock-out mediated by zinc-finger nucleases, and gene targeting by biolistic transformation...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe asymmetries of {{internal}} organs are consistently oriented along the left-right axis in all vertebrates, and perturbations of left-right orientation lead to significant congenital disease. We propose {{a model in}} which a “left-right coordinator” interacts with the Spemann organizer to coordinate the evolutionarily conserved three-dimensional asymmetries in the embryo. The Vg 1 cell-signaling pathway plays {{a central role in}} left-right coordinator function. Antagonists of Vg 1 alter left-right development; antagonists of other members of the TGFβ family do not. Cell-lineage directed expression of Vg 1 protein can fully invert the left-right axis (situs inversus), can randomize left-right asymmetries, or can “rescue” a perturbed left-right axis in conjoined twins to normal orientation (situs solitus), indicating that Vg 1 can mimic left-right coordinator activity.

5000|$|The Uni-Power is an extra-dimensional {{force that}} {{possesses}} an individual {{in a time}} of crisis, transforming that person into Captain Universe. Spider-Man became Captain Universe for a short while beginning in The Spectacular Spider-Man #158, during the [...] "Acts of Vengeance" [...] storyline. The Uni-Power grants him cosmic-level abilities and awareness and as a result, all of his natural spider-powers are greatly enhanced. For example, Spider-Man's strength was amplified {{to the point of being}} able to punch the Hulk into orbit. The efficiency of his spider-sense is also enhanced to such a degree that the tingling becomes painful and responds to nearly everything, no matter how minor. He also gains telescopic vision, <b>molecular</b> <b>manipulation</b> capabilities, a high degree of resistance to physical injury, flight, and the power to manipulate great amounts of energy for a variety of purposes. With the Uni-Power at his command, Spider-Man is able to defeat the likes of Magneto and Graviton. Spider-Man, however, does not become aware of the actual 'possession' until much later on because of the powers being partially suppressed by a machine devised by one of Parker's teachers at Empire State University. In the aftermath of the Acts of Vengeance, the suppression is removed in time to battle and defeat the Tri-Sentinel. Both Spider-Man's costume and the traditional Captain Universe attire are merged into a single uniform after Spider-Man gained awareness. Once the Tri-Sentinel is destroyed, Spider-Man loses the Captain Universe powers.|$|E
