No. 0807101020003 The Correlation Between <b>Mother</b> <b>Ability</b> To Taking Care Of Baby With Health Problem Of Baby At Puskesmas Montasik Working Territory In Aceh Besar 2012 ABSTRACTBaby ideal {{nursing treatment}} {{was a problem}} that often happened for almost mother who has a baby. Taking care of baby was a responsibillity for every parents especially for mother. <b>Mother</b> with less <b>ability</b> {{to take care of}} baby could increase the morbidity rate and even could cause death to the baby. <b>Mother</b> <b>ability</b> of taking care baby can observed from health conditon of the baby. The purpose of this research was to find out the correlation between <b>mother</b> <b>ability</b> to taking care of baby with health problem of baby at Puskesmas Montasik working territory in Aceh Besar. The methode of this research was describtive correlational with cross sectional research design. The sample of this research were 79 responden, selected by using purposive sampling technique using Slovin formula. Data were collected on September 13, 2012 using a quetioner, whose form is Likert and Check list scale for independent variable, and dichotomoise choice scale for dependent variabel. The data were analized univariate and bivariate using chi square test. The result of research showed that there were correlation between <b>mother</b> <b>ability</b> to taking care of the baby, such as from baby skin care aspec(p-value = 0, 002), baby bath care aspect (p-value = 0, 004), baby nutrition care aspect (p-value = 0, 007), baby fullfilment imunization schedule aspect (p-value = 0, 002), taking care of baby sleep behavior (p-value = 0, 009) and taking care of baby safety (p-value = 0, 005). Based on the statistic test result, p-value (0, 001) is less or equal to ? (0, 05), therefor Ho is rejected. Meaning that there was significant correlation between <b>mother</b> <b>ability</b> to take care of baby with health problem of the baby. Its recommended for Health provider to give more attention to increase <b>ability</b> of a <b>mother</b> to take care of baby by giving information or literature in any type to mothers who has baby in rural environtment.

50|$|In {{contrast}} to the multitude of breeds & types used in smaller operations, breeds such as the New Zealand and Californian, as well as hybrids of these breeds, are most frequently utilized for meat in commercial rabbitries. The primary qualities of good meat rabbit breeding stock are growth rate and <b>mothering</b> <b>ability.</b> Uniform growth rates & size at slaughter are also considered important factors. Specific lines of commercial breeds have been developed that maximize these qualities - rabbits may be slaughtered as early as seven weeks and does of these strains routinely raise litters of 8 to 12 kits. Other breeds of rabbit developed for commercial meat production include the Florida White and the Altex.|$|E

It is white, and is scantily clad with short hairs. The snout is long, and the large ears droop forwards. It has a long back and deep flanks and lacks the {{wrinkles}} and excess fat found in some other breeds. However the Swedish Landrace is not such an extreme bacon-pig, and breeders have concentrated on the soundness of the legs and feet, {{the strength of the}} back and the animal's constitution. They have also sought to retain the fecundity, prolificacy, <b>mothering</b> <b>ability</b> and rate of weight gain of the Danish Landrace.|$|E
5000|$|Monkey {{was born}} in 1920, a son of Vinotero, one of the bulls {{purchased}} in 1918. This bull became the foundation sire for the breed. With the birth of Monkey and a decision to line-breed came a very uniform and very hearty breed of beef cattle. These cattle are red in color, display a blend of Bos indicus and Bos taurus attributes, and may be polled or horned. Other characteristics include good milking ability, good beef production, excellent <b>mothering</b> <b>ability,</b> ease of calving, high heat tolerance and parasite resistance, {{and an ability to}} market or harvest a steer at just about any age. The steers also show good weights for their age, as well as good weight gains whether on pasture or in a feedlot.|$|E

50|$|It is {{used for}} a range of products; meat, milk and wool. However, this breed is raised {{primarily}} for milk. They have unique physiological characteristics such as resistance to many diseases and parasites, walk long distances over pastures for grazing, tolerating extreme temperatures and enduring adverse feeding conditions. It easily adapts to different environments and performs as well as in its native habitat. Awassi sheep are well-adapted to the poor Mediterranean pasture and can compensate for under-nutrition during the dry season by using the stored energy reserves in the fat tail. It has a high <b>mothering</b> <b>ability.</b> Due to its high milk producing potential under harsh conditions, the Awassi breed {{can be used as a}} sire breed in improving milk production of many indigenous Asiatic and African breeds. The Awassi breed is known to be the highest milking breed after the East Friesian breed.|$|E
50|$|Division of Animal Genetics and Breeding {{was started}} in 1966 under the name Sheep Genetic Section with a mandate to conduct {{research}} on improvement of indigenous breeds of sheep for wool and meat. It was renamed as Division of Animal Genetics and Breeding in 1975. Animal Genetics and Breeding Division carried out pioneer {{work in the field}} of crossbreeding for improving the production of mutton, carpet wool, apparel wool and pelt. Various crosses like Avikalin, Bharat Merino, Avimaans, Indian Karakul, Awassi X Malpura and Avivastra were developed at this division. Research was also carried out with indigenous goats (Marwari, Sirohi and Kutchi) to evolve milk and meat producing goats. The biochemical polymorphic studies were undertaken to study the inheritance of various blood constituents and to determine the possible association of these biochemical parameters with economic traits. Cytogenetic studies were initiated in 1982. In 1997, Garole, a prolific microsheep of West Bengal was introduced for increasing prolificacy of Malpura sheep. Marker Assisted Selection (MAS) for prolificacy has been practically used in the routine breeding programme. In 2008, Patanwadi inheritance was introduced into prolificacy project to improve the milk yield and <b>mothering</b> <b>ability.</b> Three breed prolific cross was produced in 2009 and strengthening of prolific flock is in progress. Recently study on understanding the genetic basis of immune response variability in sheep has been initiated. Stalwarts like Dr. M V Krishna Rao, Dr. O N Singh, Dr. R M Acharya, Dr. R Nagercenkar, Dr. A L Chaudhary, Dr. R N Singh, Dr. C L Arora, Dr. S D J Bohra, Dr. B U Khan, Dr. V K Singh and Dr. A L Arora had shaped the development and progress of this division.
