40|$|In <b>recalling</b> a <b>memory,</b> two {{perspectives}} are possible. In {{any given}} scene, {{we may see}} ourselves from our own perspective (internal viewpoint) or from another's perspective (external viewpoint). This study investigated perspectives in early and associated memories. One hundred and sixteen students participated individually. They were asked to fill in a questionnaire and post it in a box. The results showed that early memories {{were more likely to}} be recalled from an external viewpoint; <b>memories</b> <b>recalled</b> from external viewpoints were highly objective and pleasurable, while <b>memories</b> <b>recalled</b> from internal viewpoints were vivid, frightening, and unpleasant. For associated memories, more events were recalled from internal viewpoints. Moreover, there was a pattern with respect to association. Early <b>memories</b> <b>recalled</b> from external viewpoints {{were more likely to be}} associated with <b>memories</b> <b>recalled</b> from external viewpoints, while early <b>memories</b> <b>recalled</b> from internal viewpoints were more likely to be associated with <b>memories</b> <b>recalled</b> from internal viewpoints. The former pattern was more likely to involve early events, while the latter pattern more often involved recalled events from the primary school period...|$|R

25|$|The {{effect of}} {{attention}} on <b>memory</b> <b>recall</b> has surprising results. It {{seems that the}} only time attention largely affects memory is during the encoding phase.

40|$|AUTOBIOGRAPHICAL MEMORIES IN BILINGUAL SINGAPOREANS Children {{start to}} form autobiographical {{memories}} (i. e., personal experiences and {{ideas about the}} self) early on and this {{plays a key role}} in one's identity and psychological well-being. Previous research has shown that language plays an important role in forming autobiographical memories. Conversations about experiences and reminiscing about the past have been shown to play a critical role in the development of autobiographical memory. In this study, English-Mandarin bilingual participants (N = 22) <b>recalled</b> autobiographical <b>memories</b> in response to six cue words in the first target language (English or Mandarin), and in the second language a week later (English or Mandarin). Results revealed no significant difference in the age of <b>memories</b> <b>recalled</b> in one's first learned language (English) than <b>memories</b> <b>recalled</b> one's second learned language (Mandarin).

25|$|Organizational memory {{can only}} be applied {{if it can be}} accessed. To make use of it, {{organizations}} must have effective retrieval systems for their archives and good <b>memory</b> <b>recall</b> among the individuals that make up the organization. Its importance to an organization depends upon how well individuals can apply it, a discipline known as experiential learning or evidence-based practice. In the case of individuals' memories, organizational memory's veracity is invariably compromised by the inherent limitations of human memory. Individuals' reluctance to admit to mistakes and difficulties compounds the problem. The actively encouraged flexible labor market has imposed an Alzheimer's-like corporate amnesia on organizations that creates an inability to benefit from hindsight.|$|E
25|$|Researchers Campbell and Hawley (1982) {{provided}} {{evidence of the}} regulation of arousal differences between introverts and extroverts. They found that when studying in a library, extroverts {{were more likely to}} choose to work in areas with bustle and activity, while introverts were more likely to choose a quiet, secluded area. Accordingly, Adrian Furnham and Anna Bradley discovered that introverts presented with music at the time of two cognitive tasks (prose recall and reading comprehension) performed significantly worse on a test of <b>memory</b> <b>recall</b> than extroverts who were also presented with music {{at the time of the}} tasks. However, if music was not present at the time of the tasks, introverts and extroverts performed at the same level.|$|E
25|$|The {{influence}} of generation identity on the reminiscence bump {{can be attributed}} to the idea that all members of the subgroup are likely to have memories of similar types of experiences. Evidence attesting to the {{influence of}} generation identity on the reminiscence bump has been witnessed in populations that have experience with traumatic events. In 1999, researchers compared younger and older groups of Bangladeshis. The younger group (ages 20–42) showed the usual increase in memories during the reminiscence bump while the older group (ages 46–86) showed a second increase in memories between the ages of 35 and 55. The second bump experienced by the older group corresponded to the period of the Bangladesh Liberation War. The two generations showed similar patterns and timing of <b>memory</b> <b>recall</b> within their own subgroup, suggesting that they did have similar experiences, either living or not living through the war. This finding may suggests that each generation remember personal events and generational events.|$|E

Despite this, subjects do not mix fantasy up with reality.|$|R
25|$|Caffeine {{can have}} {{multiple}} effects at the cellular level but is primarily notable for the alertness effect {{that it has}} on people. Research has been performed involving phonological priming and TOTs in which participants took either 200mg of caffeine or a placebo. The participants answered 100 general knowledge questions, each with one correct answer. For each question, participants read 10 priming words that were displayed on a monitor {{for a short period}} of time. Each list of 10 priming words had between two and eight words that were phonologically related to the correct answer of the question, with the remaining words being unrelated. Caffeinated participants had fewer TOT experiences than the placebo group, suggesting better <b>memory</b> <b>recall.</b> However, in the unrelated condition, the caffeinated group did not do as well as the placebo group in their ability to retrieve words. The results suggest that this dose of caffeine (equivalent to two cups of coffee) can temporarily hinder a person’s short-term recall of certain words. Moreover, the general advantageous effect of caffeine on attention can be ruled out.|$|E

2500|$|The levels-of-processing effect, {{identified}} by Fergus I. M. Craik and Robert S.

[...] Deeper levels of analysis produce more elaborate, longer-lasting, and stronger memory traces than shallow levels of analysis. Depth of processing falls on a shallow to deep continuum. Shallow processing (e.g., processing based on phonemic and orthographic components) leads to a fragile memory trace that is susceptible to rapid decay. Conversely, deep processing (e.g., semantic processing) results in a more durable memory trace.|$|E
2500|$|The Face Advantage allows {{information}} and memories to be recalled easier through {{the presentation of}} a person's face rather than a person's voice. Faces and voices are very similar stimuli that reveal similar {{information and}} result in similar processes of <b>memory</b> <b>recall.</b> During face perception, there are three stages of <b>memory</b> <b>recall</b> that include recognition, followed by the remembering of semantic memory and episodic memory, and finally name recall. The Face Advantage is shown through an experiment where participants are presented with faces and voices of unfamiliar faces and recognizable celebrity faces. [...] The stimuli are presented with a between-group design. The participants are asked to say if the face or voice is familiar. If the answer is yes, {{they are asked to}} recall semantic and episodic memories and finally the name of the face or voice. It was much easier for those presented with a celebrity's face to recall information than for those presented with a voice. The results show that in the second stage of face perception when memories are recalled, information is recalled faster and more accurate after a face is perceived, and slower, less accurate and with less detail after a voice is perceived. [...] A possible explanation is that the connections between face representations and semantic and episodic memory are stronger than that of voices.|$|E
