50|$|A {{kaleidoscope}} {{operates on}} the principle of <b>multiple</b> <b>reflection,</b> where two or more reflectors are placed at an angle to one another. When the eye is placed {{at one end of the}} reflectors, the original view from the aperture on the other side is multiplied into a symmetrical mosaic pattern. A two-mirror kaleidoscope yields a circular pattern isolated against a solid black background, while the three-mirror equilateral triangle type yields an infinite pattern that fills the entire visual field.|$|E
5000|$|Because {{ultrasound}} signal wavelengths have short reach, {{they are}} confined to lesser distant locations than with wireless transmissions with higher susceptibility to <b>multiple</b> <b>reflection,</b> multipath and through-the-wall multiple room responses. Hence ultrasound-based RTLS is considered a more robust alternative to passive radio-frequency identification (pRFID) and even to active radio-frequency identification (aRFID) in complex indoor environments (such as hospitals), where radio waves get multiply transmitted and reflected, thereby compromising the positioning accuracy. Generally the ultrasound signal does not interfere with sensitive medical equipment.|$|E
50|$|<b>Multiple</b> <b>reflection</b> {{by two or}} more {{reflecting}} surfaces {{has been}} known since antiquity and was described as such by Giambattista della Porta in his Magia Naturalis (1558-1589). In 1646 Athanasius Kircher described an experiment with a construction of two mirrors, which could be opened and closed like a book and positioned in various angles, showing regular polygon figures consisting of reflected aliquot sectors of 360°. Mr. Bradley's New Improvements in Planting and Gardening (1717) described a similar construction {{to be placed on}} geometrical drawings to show an image with multiplied reflection. However, an optimal configuration that produces the full effects of the kaleidoscope have not been recorded before 1815.|$|E

40|$|Using the MIT bag model, we {{calculate}} the free energy of droplets of quark-gluon plasma in a bulk hadronic medium, and of hadronic bubbles in a bulk quark-gluon plasma, {{under the assumption}} of vanishing chemical potentials. We investigate {{the validity of the}} <b>multiple</b> <b>reflection</b> expansion approximation, and we advise a novel procedure for calculating finite-size corrections to the free energy of hadronic bubbles in a bulk quark-gluon plasma. While our results agree largely with earlier calculations, we show that the usual <b>multiple</b> <b>reflection</b> expansion should be used with caution, and we propose a modification of the <b>multiple</b> <b>reflection</b> expansion, which makes this approximation agree nicely with direct numerical calculations. The results should be of relevance in connection with the cosmological quark-hadron transition as well as for ultrarelativistic heavy ion collisions.

40|$|A simple {{scaling law}} for {{penetration}} depth in laser welding is proposed considering heat flow characteristics and <b>multiple</b> <b>reflections.</b> First, a process parameter is identified that {{is proportional to}} the surface temperature during laser processing, and the parameter is modified by accounting for the effect of <b>multiple</b> <b>reflections.</b> As a result, the normalized penetration depth is expressed as a function of a single parameter that is a combination of laser intensity, interaction time and an indicator of the strength of <b>multiple</b> <b>reflections.</b> The obtained scaling law is applicable not only to conduction mode welding but also to keyhole mode welding, and provides insight into why and how penetration depth changes in a particular way. Systematic and extensive welding experiments were conducted using a 2 kW multi-mode fiber laser and two types of steels. The experimental results were in good agreement with the proposed scaling law. close...|$|R
40|$|Interbed <b>multiple</b> <b>reflections</b> contain {{valuable}} informa-tion {{about the}} subsurface reflectivity distribution that can complement information obtained from primary re-flections and free-surface multiples. In this report two methods are developed {{and used to}} migrate interbed mul-tiples. The first method applies Fermat’s principle to find the specular reflection point along the interbed mul-tiple generating interface; the second method sums all the diffractions bouncing off the multiple generating interface. The first method is more computationally efficient, while the second method utilizes the full Fresnel zone along the interbed multiple generating interface. Numerical tests with synthetic VSP data and field data show that interbed multiples can illuminate areas below salt and can image salt boundaries. One challenge is that interbed <b>multiple</b> <b>reflections</b> are usually weak, thus the interbed multiple generating interface needs to be strong, and the reflector to be imaged also must be strong in or-der to generate noticeable interbed <b>multiple</b> <b>reflections...</b>|$|R
