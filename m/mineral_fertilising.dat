40|$|Plants {{have many}} useful {{substances}} – {{and one of}} them is flavonoids with other phenolic compounds. This is a very big group of biological active compounds. Flavonoids have been referred to as "nature's biological response modifiers" because of their ability to modify the body's reaction to other compounds such as allergens, viruses, and carcinogens. They show anti-allergic, anti-inflammatory, and anti-cancer activity. In addition, flavonoids act as powerful antioxidants, providing remarkable protection against oxidative and free radical damage. As a result, consumers and food manufacturers have become increasingly interested in flavonoids for their healthful properties, especially their potential beneficial role in the prevention of cancer and cardiovascular diseases. Phenolic acids are interesting of their protective role against oxidative damage diseases (coronary heart disease, stroke, and cancers). One of possible sources of flavonoids and phenolic acids – Canadian thick-trefoil (showy trefoil) – Desmodium canadense (L) DC. This plant is not researched as good as many other plants, but there are some works on it. In Lithuania, KUM, there were some research works on Desmodium canadense (L.) DC. There was performed analysis of grass, collected in different phase of vegetation. Also was researched influence of <b>mineral</b> <b>fertilising</b> to amounts of flavonoids and phenolic acids...|$|E
40|$|International audienceGarlic (Allium sativum L.) is {{well-known}} for presenting numerous health benefits {{linked to the}} high amount of organo-sulfur compounds, especially aliin, produced in the bulbs. The accumulation of alliin and its precursors in garlic is dependent on both genetic factors and environmental conditions in which the plants are cultivated. Indeed, different organo-sulfur compounds profiles were obtained for several accessions originating from Central Asia when grown in natural conditions in two different climatic contexts. Field trials carried out on three commercial varieties grown under two different climatic conditions of Western Europe confirmed this observation and suggested an important role of the cropping temperature, soil status and water stress conditions. Experiments performed under fully controlled conditions, in vitro and in the greenhouse, showed that sulfur fertilisation as well as light conditions could also {{have an impact on}} the organosulfur composition of garlic bulbs. However, the interaction with the genotype has to be considered as spring-varieties and winter-varieties did not react the same way to variations in fertilising and environmental conditions. In the mean time, the effect of increasing mineral sulfur should be considered in relation to other <b>mineral</b> <b>fertilising</b> components, like nitrogen and selenium, as well as to other sulfur sources, from the soil and from the atmosphere, as garlic seems to be able to use atmospheric sulfur. Multiple factors affect alliin accumulation in garlic, so its quality for human health. These factors should be considered when growing garlic for flavour or therapeutic value...|$|E
40|$|N-balances over 35 {{years from}} the DOK trial are {{presented}} and combined with Nstock changes in DOK treatments on different fertilisation levels. Results strongly indicate an N efficiency-sustainability dilemma: DOK treatments with a high nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) lose more soil stock N than those with a lower NUE but higher N losses from the system. The biodynamic system showed little advantage in terms of soil N stocks sustainability while the solely <b>mineral</b> <b>fertilised</b> conventional treatment had highest NUE across all inputs including soil N change...|$|R
40|$|Biowaste compost {{exploitation}} {{is a way}} {{of recovering}} agricultural soil fertility that in these last decades decreased up to a desertification limit. In order to test compost efficacy on crop yield and soil fertility, in the period 2011 - 2013 at COTIR experimental farm, a trial comparing different amounts of compost on two crop rotations was carried out. Crop rotations tested were durum wheat-sunflower-durum wheat and tomato-durum wheat-pepper. Results showed that the use of 40 t ha – 1 of compost increased wheat grain yield and protein content if compared to control and <b>mineral</b> <b>fertilised</b> treatment. Compost application at 40 t ha – 1 increased also yield of pepper in the first two harvest times, while during the third harvest, which included green and red berries, (the) yield was statistically different only if compared to control treatment. Moreover, compost improved soil fertility both in terms of organic matter and main nutritional elements, while a negative aspect of its use was the increase of soil electric conductivity, although no negative effect on crops yield were observed...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L.) {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} crops in the world and represents a key crop in southern Italy. With the aim to evaluate the nutritional characteristics of tomato fruits in relation to NPK and compost fertilisation, the concentrations of the main nutrients, toxic elements, primary metabolites and total phenols were determined in two varieties (Lido and San Marzano). Each variety was cultivated in a diﬀerent experimental ﬁeld, subjected to diﬀerent agronomic techniques. RESULTS: Concentrations of toxic elements (Cd and Pb) were below the limits indicated by the EU Regulation (2011) in all the fruits analysed. Moreover, fruits obtained from San Marzano plants grown on organic amended soils showed a better overall quality than those obtained on <b>mineral</b> <b>fertilised</b> soil, being characterised by lower N (attributed to lower nitrate and nitrite concentrations), lower Cd, and higher soluble sugar concentrations. Higher concentrations of soluble sugars in fruits from organic amended soils were also observed in the Lido variety. CONCLUSIONS: The agricultural use of quality compost represents an eﬀective strategy to obtain high quality products in an economically and environmentally sustainable way...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Besides their {{nutritional}} value, {{vegetables are}} a source of health-promoting compounds, such as polyphenols, and their content can be influenced by the particular farming method. In this study polyphenolic extracts from Lactuca sativa (var. Maravilla de verano) plants cultivated with different farming methods were chemically characterised and tested in vitro and ex vivo inflammation models. RESULTS: The tested extacts (250 - 2. 5 μg mL- 1) were able to reduce both the inflammatory and oxidative stress in LPS-stimulated J 774 A. 1 murine monocyte macrophage cells, by lowering the release of nitric oxide (NO) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) and promoting nuclear translocation of nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2) -like 2; (Nrf 2) and nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB). In this regard, quantitative profiles revealed different amounts of polyphenols, in particular quercetin levels were higher in plants under <b>mineral</b> <b>fertilised</b> treatment. Those extract showed an enhanced anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activity. CONCLUSION: Our data showed the anti-inflammatory and antioxidant potential of Maravilla de Verano polyphenolic extracts. The effect of farming methods on polyphenolic levels was highlighted. The higher reduction of inflammatory mediators release in extracts from plants cultivated under mineral fertilisation treatment was correlated to the higher amount of quercetin. These results can be useful for both nutraceutical or agronomic purposes...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to {{evaluate}} the effects of soil amendment with compost, obtained by the organic fraction of solid urban wastes, in comparison with traditional chemical fertilization practices on potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) crop. Seven genetically biodiverse cultivars (Cvs - King Edward, Pentland Dell, Maris Piper, Wilja, Kingston, Spunta, Red Pontiac) were employed to establish an experimental field in southern Italy. The field was subdivided into two portions (about 1000 m 2 each) : one was amended with compost at 20 tons per hectare, while the other one was supplemented with ammonium sulphate at 200 Kg per hectare. Element concentrations, productivity and organoleptic characteristics were evaluated, at the end of the experiment, in potato tubers of all Cvs obtained from both kinds of fertilised soil. cDNA-AFLP and MSAP analyses were performed on leaves and tubers collected from Red Pontiac Cv, to estimate if any transcriptome or epigenetic modifications, due to different kinds of fertilization, were induced. Mineral fertilization and compost amendment did not cause any significant modification in transcriptome and in epigenome profiles in both analyzed organs, as well as in the productivity, organoleptic characteristics, nutrients and trace elements in tubers. Only for K, the tubers grown on compost amended soil showed, on average, a higher K concentration in respect to those grown on <b>mineral</b> <b>fertilised</b> soil. In conclusion, potato tubers, produced by means of different soil fertilizations, show similar characteristics in terms of productivity, quality and nutraceutical properties...|$|R
40|$|Aim of the {{presented}} {{study was}} the comparison of the specific emissions of CO 2 equivalents of a legume based and a <b>mineral</b> N <b>fertilised</b> grassland considering the N 2 O emissions caused by N fertilisation and soil compaction. The field trial was {{set up on the}} experimental station “Hohenschulen” in northern Germany with the factors soil compaction, N fertilisation and experimental year. The N 2 O emissions were affected by an interaction of soil compaction and N fertilisation, especially under moist spring conditions. The specific CO 2 -equivalent emission per unit energy yield was 67 % higher for the mineral N-fertilised grassland compared to the legume based grassland...|$|R
40|$|Leafy {{vegetables}} have {{a relatively}} high potential for Cd uptake and translocation, and are thus considered Cd accumulators. For this reason, leaves and roots of lettuce (Lactuca sativa L.) and endive (Cichorium endivia L.) plants, grown on different agricultural soils in Campania region (southern Italy), subjected to different fertilisation treatments (unfertilisation, compost amendment and mineral fertilisation), were analysed for Cd concentrations. Moreover, to clarify if the highest concentrations found are linked to older and inedible or to younger and edible leaves, external and internal endive leaves were separately analysed. All the leafy vegetables analysed showed on average 2 -fold higher Cd concentrations in leaves than in roots. Leaf Cd concentrations in both lettuce and endive plants significantly differed among fertilisation treatments, with values highest in the plants grown on <b>mineral</b> <b>fertilised</b> soils. Apart from the soil fertilisation treatments, however, Cd leaf concentrations were often higher (up to 4 -fold) than the threshold deduced by the EU 420 / 2011 Regulation, although the plants grew on unpolluted soils. Anyway, external leaves of endive plants showed significantly higher concentrations than internal leaves (in some cases the values were 3 -fold higher), partly reassuring on the consumption of the younger leaves. Moreover, this study points out two major drawbacks in the Italian and European regulatory frameworks: (1) metal concentration (as total and/or available fraction) limits in agricultural soils are lacking; (2) metal concentration thresholds (currently existing only for Cd and Pb in crops) reported in the EU 420 / 2011 Regulation, expressed on the fresh weight basis {{rather than on the}} dry weight basis, appear not suitable...|$|R
40|$|The use {{of compost}} for soil {{amendment}} is a promising agricultural practice environmentally and economically viable. In {{the framework of}} a wide research project designed to evaluate the effects of soil amendment with municipal solid waste compost in comparison with traditional mineral fertilization practices, 54 different cultivars (Cvs) of potatoes were AFLP (ampliﬁed fragment length polymorphism) molecularly fingerprinted. The seven most genetically biodiverse potato Cvs were used to establish an experimental ﬁeld in southern Italy. The ﬁeld area was divided into two portions fertilized with compost (20 Mg ha− 1) or with ammonium sulphate (200 kg ha). No signiﬁcant differences in productivity, organoleptic characteristics and element concentrations were observed between the potato tubers obtained with both kinds of soil fertilization, while the tubers grown on compost amended soil showed, on average, higher K concentrations with respect to those grown on <b>mineral</b> <b>fertilised</b> soil. cDNA-AFLP (complementary DNA-AFLP) and MSAP (methylation sensitive ampliﬁed polymorphism) analyses were carried out on both leaves and tubers of one selected Cv to estimate if any transcriptome alterations or epigenetic modiﬁcations were induced by the two kinds of fertilization, however no variations were detected. Chemical and biological soil qualities (i. e., microbial respiration, FDA hydrolysis, alkaline and acid phosphatase) were assessed on soil samples {{at the start of the}} experiment and at the end of potato crop cycle. No signiﬁcant differences in soil pH and limited ones, in the available fraction of sometrace elements, were observed; while conductivity was much higher for the compost amended portion of the experimental ﬁeld. Microbial respiration, FDA hydrolysis and acid phosphatase activities were signiﬁcantly increased by compost amendment, in comparison with mineral fertilization. Finally, a sensory panel of potato Cvs detected no signiﬁcant differences among qualitative descriptors and among potatoes coming from the two differently fertilized soils...|$|R
40|$|Cadmium is a toxic element for {{all living}} beings, even at low concentrations, {{and it is}} a human {{carcinogenic}} according to IARC. Since food is reported as the main source of Cd intake in non-smoking individuals, FAO and WHO set limits for the maximum permitted human intake. Leafy vegetables have a relatively high potential for Cd uptake and translocation, therefore they are often considered Cd accumulators. As they are important salad crops of the Mediterranean diet and are available worldwide, their consumption may represent an effective risk for human health. Lettuce (Lactuca sativa) and endive (Cichorium endivia), grown on different agricultural soils in Campania region (southern Italy), subjected to different fertilisation treatments (unfertilisation, compost amendment and mineral fertilisation), were analysed to clarify if the highest concentrations found are linked to external (older and inedible) or internal (younger and edible) leaves. All the leafy vegetables analysed showed on average 2 -fold higher (α= 0. 05) Cd concentrations in leaves than in roots. Leaf Cd concentrations in both lettuce and endive significantly differed among fertilisation treatments, with values highest in the plants grown on <b>mineral</b> <b>fertilised</b> soils. Apart from the soil fertilisation treatments, however, Cd leaf concentrations were often higher than maximum levels deduced by the CE 629 / 2008 Regulation. External leaves of endive plants showed significantly higher (α= 0. 05) concentrations than internal leaves (in some cases the values were 3 -fold higher). This study highlights worrying Cd concentrations in the edible parts of the studied vegetables, with concentrations up to 4 -fold higher than the threshold. Moreover, it points out two major drawbacks in the Italian and European regulatory frameworks: 1) metal concentration (as total and/or available fraction) limits in agricultural soils are lacking; 2) metal concentration thresholds reported in the CE 629 / 2008 Regulation, expressed on the fresh weight basis rather than on the dry weight basis, appear not suitable...|$|R
40|$|The {{recycling}} of organic wastes as soil amendments is notably promoted in sustainable agricultural systems. However, for many animal by-products approved by organic farming regulations {{little is known}} about their effects on the greenhouse gas balance of the soil, in particular on N 2 O emissions. In this work we report on the N 2 O and CO 2 emissions from six animal-derived wastes (horn and hoof meal, blood meal, hydrolysed leather, meat bone meal, chicken manure and a commercial organic mixed fertiliser). We compared these emissions to those from a mineral fertiliser (calcium ammonium nitrate) in a sandy and a loam soil during a three month laboratory incubation study. N 2 O flux dynamics varied strongly with residue category and soil type. In the sandy soil, cumulative N 2 O emissions correlated with soil NO 3 - content. Although the mineral fertiliser produced the highest total N 2 O emissions (5. 7 mg N 2 O–N kg- 1 soil), the commercial organic fertiliser mixture led to statistically similar emissions (5. 3 mg N 2 O–N kg- 1 soil). The other by-products emitted between 1. 3 – 3. 0 mg N 2 O–N kg- 1 soil, and only blood meal emitted less than 1 mg N 2 O–N kg- 1 soil. In the loam soil, N 2 O emissions never exceeded 1. 0 mg N 2 O–N kg- 1 soil, and did not correlate with NO 3 - in soil. With regard to CO 2 emissions and C storage potential, chicken manure was the only residue that significantly accumulated C in both soils during the course of our experiment. The addition of an extra easily available source of C (glucose) or N (NO 3 -) influenced N 2 O emissions differently depending on the residue applied. Our results showed that despite the extra amount of C added with the organic amendments, N 2 O emissions from animal-derived wastes were never higher than those from the <b>mineral</b> <b>fertilise...</b>|$|R
40|$|Soil {{properties}} that drive grassland {{production in the}} absence of mineral nitrogen applications and explanatory mechanisms thereof were sought in this study. Sixteen grassland farms varying in nitrogen inputs were selected in Counties Limerick and Clare, Ireland. Soil was sampled in 1995 and physical, chemical and biological properties analysed in the laboratory. Management data describing lime and fertiliser applications, grazing practices, soil disturbance, livestock and fodder production were obtained by interview. Grassland production for the year 1996 / 97 was measured as: stocking density; gross margin; and total energy required for livestock production, including maintenance, growth, offspring and milk and fodder sales, taking nongrassland feed energy into account. The botanical composition was determined in 1998. Data were not normally distributed therefore the research was conducted in an exploratory manner. Descriptive scatter graphs and statistics, bivariate nonparametric Spearman 2 ̆ 7 s rank correlation, multiple regression analyses, principle components analysis (PCA) and canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) were implemented. Four farms were in conversion to organic management, seven were organically managed and one was conventionally managed. Four farms had not had fertiliser applications. Microbial biomass, bacterial popUlations, and arginine ammonification activity that was interpreted as N-mineralisation and N-immobilisation activities in vitro, were not extreme in productive farms. Production measured as grassland energy correlated (P < 0. 05) with: fertiliser inputs and mechanical disturbance; soil pH; depth to bedrock; soil plant-available magnesium and calcium contents, influences of which were direct. Root mass and N-mineralisation in vitro correlated inversely (P < 0. 05) with production. Influential factors were highly correlated with each other (P < 0. 05). Each influential factor, ordinated with variables correlated to it, gave rise to a production-related gradient of farms in PCA. A suite of N -mineralisation in vitro and its related variables reliably indicated grassland farm production in ordination space. Fertiliser and lime applications, vegetation, grazing, soil depth and metabiosis influenced bacterial populations and activities. Root mass and N-mineralisation rates in vitro were least in disturbed and <b>mineral</b> nitrogen <b>fertilised</b> soils. N-mineralisation in vitro was greatest in extensive farms and N-immobilisation in vitro indicated carbon abundance in botanically diverse swards. Soil microbial biomass, bacterial populations and activities behaved individualistically along a possible succession in grazed grassland. Based on observations, and on allosteric and catabolite repression of amino acid use, it was hypothesised that 2 ̆ 7 available carbon, AC, is used before organic nitrogen, ON 2 ̆ 7 is ammonified. However, ammonification in vitro was uncorrelated with soil organic carbon or soil nitrogen contents or C:N ratio, because soil C and N analyses applied in the study may not have accounted for microbe-available resources. Soil organic carbon content was relatively high, but least in the conventional farm. In contrast to other studies in the literature, soil organic carbon content was not correlated with microbial biomass and arginine ammonification but may be above threshold values needed to facilitate biological function in the soils examined. Available forms of C and N ought to be considered as interdependent determinants of soil organic matter turnover rates subject to fertiliser use and grazing in grassland soils...|$|R
40|$|Deep {{anthropogenic}} topsoils – those augmented through long-term additions of <b>mineral</b> bulk among <b>fertilising</b> agents – retain in {{both their}} {{physical and chemical}} make-up significant indicators for cultural activity. This project researched the geographical distribution and historical context of deep anthropogenic topsoils in Scotland and the Isles, and used this information to investigate the impact of current land cover upon the cultural information they retain. In so doing, the project investigated the potential for conservation of this significant cultural resource. A review of the historical information available on agricultural and manuring practices for Scotland identified several factors likely to affect deep topsoil distribution and frequency. These were: the availability of bulk manures to Scottish farmers, {{the significance of the}} seaweed resource in determining fertiliser strategies in coastal areas, and the influence of urban settlement and associated patterns of domestic and industrial waste disposal on the location of deep topsoils. Evidence for widespread deep topsoil development was limited. The primary data source used – the First Statistical Account of Scotland – was manipulated into a spatial database in ArcView GIS, to which geographical data from the Soil Survey of Scotland and national archaeological survey databases were added. This was used to devise a survey programme aiming both to investigate the potential factors affecting soil development listed above, and to locate deep topsoil sites for analysis. Three sites were identified with deep topsoils under different cover types (woodland, arable and pasture). The urban-influenced context of two of these highlighted the significance of urban settlement to the location of Scottish deep topsoils. Analysis of pH, organic matter, and total phosphorus content showed a correlation between raised organic matter and a corresponding increase in phosphorus content in soils under permanent vegetation. By contrast, soils under arable cultivation showed no such rise. This was attributed to the action of cropping in removing modern organic inputs prior to down-profile cycling. The potential for pasture and woodland cover to affect relict soil signatures was therefore observed. Thin section analysis aimed to both provide micromorphological characterisation of the three deep topsoil sites and investigate the effect of modern land cover on micromorphological indicators. Distinctive differences in micromorphological character were observed between the rural and urban deep topsoils, with the latter showing a strong focus on carbonised fuel residues and industrial wastes. All sites showed a highly individual micromorphological character, reflective of localised fertilising systems. There was no correlation between land cover type and survival of material indictors for anthropogenic activity, with soil cultural indicators surviving well, particularly those characteristic of urban-influenced topsoils. Suggestions for preservation strategies for this potentially rare and highly localised cultural resource included the incorporation of deep anthropogenic topsoil conservation into current government policy relating to care of the rural historic environment, and the improvement of data on the resource through ongoing survey and excavation.
