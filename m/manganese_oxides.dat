40|$|This {{study focused}} on the design and {{synthesis}} of <b>manganese</b> <b>oxide</b> nanomaterials with nanoarray architectures. First of all, a straightforward synthetic strategy was discovered to fabricate <b>manganese</b> <b>oxide</b> nanoarrays on two-dimensional substrates (e. g. Si wafers and conductive FTO glass). Then, the generic one-pot hydrothermal synthesis route has been successfully utilized to in-situ grow uniform <b>manganese</b> <b>oxide</b> nanoarrays onto the cordierite honeycomb monolithic substrates, forming a series of nanoarray-based monolithic catalysts with different morphology, surface area, and reactivity of carbon monoxide (CO) oxidation., denoted as HM-DCM, HM-PCR, and HM-PSF, respectively. Next, copper <b>manganese</b> <b>oxide</b> (CuMn 2 O 4) was combined with the <b>manganese</b> <b>oxide</b> nanoarray-based monolithic catalysts to enhance reactivity. Nanosheet layers of CuMn 2 O 4 were uniformly coated onto the <b>manganese</b> <b>oxide</b> nanoarrays (HM-PCR). Compared to traditional monolithic catalysts with alumina support, the benefit of nanoarray morphology was demonstrated by correlating the variation of surface area with the reactivity. The incorporation of cobalt ions promoted the higher surface area and C 3 H 8 conversion as well. Last but not least, a continuous flow synthesis system was attempted to scale-up the size of <b>manganese</b> <b>oxide</b> nanoarray-based monolithic catalysts. Overall, the straightforward synthetic processes of nanoarrays and transition metal oxide coatings show a scalable, low-cost, and template-free method to fabricate monolithic catalysts for exhaust treatment...|$|R

40|$|Monodisperse <b>manganese</b> <b>oxide</b> {{honeycomb}} {{and hollow}} nanospheres {{have been prepared}} facilely at room temperature by varying the molar ratio of KMnO 4 and oleic acid. These new nanomaterials were characterized by XRD, SEM, EDS, TEM, and BET measurements. They had robust nanostructures and were stable even after ultrasonic treatment (40 kHz, 120 W) for 30 min. A plausible mechanism {{of the formation of}} <b>manganese</b> <b>oxide</b> nanostructures was proposed. The <b>manganese</b> <b>oxide</b> nanomaterials showed high catalytic activities for oxidative decomposition of formaldehyde at low temperatures. Complete conversion of formaldehyde to CO 2 and H 2 O could be achieved, and harmful byproducts were not detected in effluent gases. The catalytic activity of <b>manganese</b> <b>oxide</b> hollow nanospheres was much higher than that of honeycomb nanospheres, although the surface area of the latter was nearly 2 times as high as that of the former. The mechanism of such morphology-dependent catalytic activity was discussed in detail.

40|$|The {{characteristics}} of the oxidative transformation of the antibiotic levofloxacin (abbreviated as LEV) by <b>manganese</b> <b>oxide</b> were investigated. Up to 91 % of LEV were removed with an equivalent of 200 units (abbreviated as equiv) of <b>manganese</b> <b>oxide</b> within a 35 -day treatment period. A total of ten transformation products were identified, and five of them were newly reported. A tentative transformation pathway of LEV in the <b>manganese</b> <b>oxide</b> system involving oxidation and dealkylation was proposed. In addition, the variation in the genotoxicity and antibacterial activity along with the treatment by <b>manganese</b> <b>oxide</b> were traced using a SOS/umu assay and Escherichia coli growth inhibition assay, respectively. The {{results indicated that the}} genotoxicity significantly decreased in response to treatment with <b>manganese</b> <b>oxide,</b> while the antibacterial activity was not markedly affected until 160 -equiv of delta-MnO 2 were added. This study suggests that the oxidative degradation of LEV by <b>manganese</b> <b>oxide</b> can {{play an important role in}} the natural attenuation of LEV in sediment or soil matrices. The transformation reaction may be further optimized for removing quinolone antibiotics from wastewater or other environmental matrices to reduce the potential risk. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

A gradual transformation of the rhodochrosite to <b>manganese</b> <b>oxide</b> micronodules is observed in many grains throughout the interval. The transformation process initially attacks {{the edge of the}} rhodochrosite crystal and proceeds inward, first forming a pseudomorph of the crystal. Some grains exhibit varying degrees of departure from the crystal shape of a true pseudomorph, suggesting either an overgrowth of <b>manganese</b> <b>oxide</b> or late-stage destruction of the pseudomorph. No significant differences were observed in the relative per cent of minor and trace metals when comparing the pure rhodochrosite with the <b>manganese</b> <b>oxide</b> pseudomorphs. This suggests that the manganese and other trace elements were not transported into the system but were incorporated directly from the rhodochrosite as the <b>manganese</b> <b>oxide</b> formed.
