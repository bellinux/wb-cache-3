The film was written, produced, {{and directed by}} Robert Bilheimer, who {{had been asked to}} make the film by Antonio Maria Costa, executive director of the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime. Bilheimer planned Not My Life as the second installment in a trilogy, the first being A Closer Walk and the third being the unproduced Take Me Home. The title Not My Life came from a June 2009 interview with Molly Melching, founder of Tostan, who said that many people deny the reality of contemporary slavery because it is an uncomfortable truth, saying, [...] "No, this is not my life." ...|$|E

500|$|According to Casting Crowns' {{lead singer}} Mark Hall, {{the idea for}} [...] "Who Am I" [...] came while he was driving home {{with his wife and}} {{children}} one night. Hall, who was having personal worship time during the drive, recounts that he wondered [...] "Who am I to think I can just call up to God whenever I want, from the middle of nowhere, and expect Him to hear me?" [...] Hall says [...] "immediately I started thinking I'm a new creation, I'm more than a conqueror... I'm [...] grass, that is rises up and is gone in a day". In an interview, he commented that [...] "me being a conqueror is true, {{but at the same time}} I need to understand that <b>my</b> <b>life</b> <b>is</b> a vapor, and me being able to even pray to [...] is because of what he's done for me". [...] "Who Am I" [...] was produced by Mark A. Miller and Steven Curtis Chapman. It was recorded at Glow In The Dark Studio in Decatur, Georgia and Zoo Studio in Franklin, Tennessee, and it was engineered by Matt Goldman and Sam Hewitt.|$|E
500|$|At the USAID preview screening, actress Lucy Liu, who {{has worked}} with MTV EXIT and {{produced}} the documentary film Redlight, said that people who watch Not My Life [...] "will be shocked to find [...] is happening in America"; she said that there were 80,000 women being sexually assaulted daily and she called human trafficking the [...] "cannibalization of the planet's youth." [...] According to UN.GIFT, before Not My Life, there was [...] "no single communication tool that effectively depict the problem as a whole for a mass audience." [...] Susan Bissell, UNICEF's Child Protection Section chief, agreed with this assertion, and said that the film [...] "takes {{a close look at the}} underlying causality that so many other filmmakers have missed [...] it will change the way we see our lives, in some very fundamental ways." [...] She also said that Not <b>My</b> <b>Life</b> <b>is</b> an important documentary because it brings attention to underreported forms of abuse. A reviewer from Medical News Today praised the film for [...] "raising awareness and speaking about taboo subjects," [...] arguing that these activities [...] "are critical to empower families, communities, and governments to speak out honestly and take action against abuses." ...|$|E
500|$|While {{agency is}} the first of two {{dimensions}} of Dyer's story, the second is allegiance. [...] Dyer became a known in the public eye on the day when Anne Hutchinson was excommunicated, and Dyer took her hand while they walked out of the meeting house together. [...] Dyer had a strong affiliation and allegiance to this older woman who shared the secret of her unfortunate birth. [...] Likewise, two decades later she framed her acts as a means to stand by her friends and share in their fate. [...] In the first of two letters of Dyer's that have been preserved, she wrote to the General Court, [...] "if my Life were freely granted by you, it would not avail me, nor could I expect it of you, so long as I should daily hear or see the Sufferings of these People, my dear Brethren and Seed, with whom <b>my</b> <b>Life</b> <b>is</b> bound up, as I have done these two years". [...] Traditional bonds for females were to spouses and children, yet in the Quaker community there were strong spiritual bonds that transcended gender boundaries. [...] Thus the Puritan public found it very unusual that Dyer walked to the gallows hand-in-hand between two male friends, and she was asked if she was not ashamed of doing so. [...] This spiritual closeness of the Quakers was very threatening to the Puritan mindset where allegiance was controlled by the male church members. [...] The Quakers allowed their personal bonds to transgress not only gender lines, but also the boundaries of age and class.|$|E

500|$|... "Treehouse of Horror X" [...] was {{directed}} by Pete Michels and written by Donick Cary, Tim Long and Ron Hauge. It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on Halloween,1999. [...] "I Know What You Diddily-Iddily-Did" [...] was conceived and written by former staff writer Cary. In the DVD commentary for the episode, Cary said that {{he came up with}} the segment after watching the 1997 horror film I Know What You Did Last Summer. [...] "I had just seen the movie and I was like, 'Hey, there you go.'" [...] he said. While Flanders serves as the segment's antagonist, the role would originally go to Grampa, who would chase Homer inside a roller disco. While Grampa does not appear in the segment, the Springfield Roller Disco is seen during the Simpsons escape from Flanders. Despite serving as writer for the segment, Cary left the series after finishing the first draft in order to work on the animated Austin Powers series, which never came to fruition. In his absence, the writing staff rewrote {{the last quarter of the}} segment and added the revelation that Flanders is a werewolf. In order to dispose of Ned Flanders' corpse, Homer throws his body into Flanders' house. After he is finished, he says [...] "That's the end of that chapter", a phrase that Cary often uses in his everyday life. [...] "That's just something that comes up a lot in <b>my</b> <b>life</b> <b>is</b> when no matter if it's a good or a bad thing, just move on" [...] he said.|$|E
2500|$|Fraud {{includes}} essays {{that are}} largely autobiographical and humorous.

[...] He has said that he thought of other titles for Fraud, like [...] "Smart mouth" [...] and [...] "The jig is up". Rakoff described the first-person essays that comprise the collection as more inwardly focused than his later work. The work contains material from public radio's This American Life and from Outside and Salon, which was significantly lengthened and re-written, as well as a few new pieces.|$|E
