5000|$|In early English common law, {{an adult}} who killed {{themselves}} was literally a felon, and {{the crime was}} punishable by forfeiture of property to the king and what was considered a shameful burial [...] - [...] typically with a stake through his heart and with a burial at a crossroad.

5000|$|Doe ex. rel. Tarlow v. District of Columbia, 489 F.3d 376 (D.C. Cir. 2007), is a {{decision}} of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, written by Circuit Judge Brett Kavanaugh, in which the Court upheld a 2003 District of Columbia statute that stated the conditions for authorizing a non-emergency surgical procedure on a <b>mentally</b> <b>incompetent</b> <b>person.</b> This case developed out of an appeal to a district court decision that was brought {{on behalf of a}} mentally incompetent patient who was subjected to an abortion without her consent and another patient who was subjected to an eye surgery without the patient's consent. Under the Appellate Court's interpretation of the statute, a court located in the District of Columbia, must apply the [...] "best interest of the patient" [...] standard to a person who was never competent, and the court must apply the [...] "known wishes of the patient" [...] standard to a person who was once competent. The appellate decision was [...] remanded back to the District Court.|$|E
50|$|Since then, in the 1970s, {{in several}} road traffic cases, {{although}} obiter dicta, {{it has been}} stated {{that there is a}} defence of necessity. In Johnson v Phillips 1975, Justice Wein stated that a police constable would be entitled to direct motorists to disobey road traffic regulations if this was reasonably necessary for the protection of life or property. In a later case, Woods v Richards, Justice Eveleigh stated that the defence of necessity depended on the degree of emergency which existed or the alternative danger to be averted. In DPP v Harris a police officer, charged with driving without due care and attention through a red traffic light contrary to s 3 of the Road Traffic Act 1988, and having collided with another vehicle containing armed robbers whilst pursuing that vehicle, was not allowed to advance the defence of necessity. Again in Chicon v DPP 1994 the defence of necessity was not allowed in a case of a pit bull terrier dog being kept in a public place without a muzzle - the owner had removed the muzzle to allow the dog to drink. But in the case of In re F (Mental Patient Sterilization), the defence of necessity was allowed. In the case of R v Bournewood Community and Mental Health NHS Trust, the defence of necessity (in the case of Tort law) was recognized and applied by the House of Lords to justify the informal detention and treatment of a <b>mentally</b> <b>incompetent</b> <b>person</b> who had become a danger to himself. This approach was subsequently found to be a violation of Article 5 of the European Convention of Human Rights by the European Court of Human Rights in HL v United Kingdom. Subsequent to this decision, individuals who lack capacity must be deprived of their liberty in accordance with the Deprivation of Liberty Safeguards (an amendment to the Mental Capacity Act 2005), not under the common law doctrine of necessity.|$|E

40|$|In penal law, {{persons with}} mental {{disorders}} most often receive attention as potential perpetrators of criminal acts. Persons who commit unlawful act provided under {{law as a}} criminal offence {{in the state of}} mental incompetence are subjected to a primary sanction - security measure of compulsory psychiatric treatment and confinement in a medical institution. This measure, as well as the security measure of compulsory psychiatric treatment at liberty may be also ordered to a person who committed a criminal offence in a state of substantially impaired mental capacity. In the new Serbian Penal Code 2005 few changes has been done respecting the conditions for imposing the security measures of compulsory psychiatric treatment and confinement in a medical institution and compulsory treatment at liberty, even though these provisions needed to be brought into accord with the changed concept of guilt. Especially, these changes are not properly expressed in the new Code of Criminal Procedure (special procedure for application of security measures). It is therefore even more distinct the contradictory position of a <b>mentally</b> <b>incompetent</b> <b>person</b> accused of a crime. One way of solving this issue, supported by the author, includes a separate legislation on protection of persons with mental disorders (including those persons who, in the state of mental incompetence, commit unlawful acts provided under law as criminal offences). The position of persons in the state of substantially impaired mental capacity does not need necessarily to be changed, since their guilt is not excluded. The entire complexity of protection of these persons’ human rights is additionally pointed out in the section referring to execution of security measure of compulsory treatment and confinement in a medical institution, which naturally includes deprivation of liberty and compulsory psychiatric treatment...|$|E

25|$|The {{explanation}} above discloses another {{difference between}} title insurance and other types: title insurance premiums are not principally calculated {{on the basis}} of actuarial science, as is true in most other types of insurance. Instead of correlating the probability of losses with their projected costs, title insurance seeks to eliminate the source of the losses through the use of the recording system and other underwriting practices. As a result, a relatively small fraction of title insurance premiums are used to pay insured losses. The great majority of the premiums is used to finance the title research on each piece of property and to maintain the title plants used to efficiently do that research. There is significant social utility in this approach as the result conforms with the expectations of most property purchasers and mortgage lenders. Generally, they want the real estate they purchased or lent money on to have the title condition they expected when they entered the transaction, rather than money compensation and litigation over unexpected defects. This {{is not to say that}} title insurers take no actuarial risks. There are several matters that can affect the title to land that are not disclosed by the recording system but that are covered by the policies. Some examples are deeds executed by minors or <b>mentally</b> <b>incompetent</b> <b>persons,</b> forged instruments (in some cases), corporate instruments executed without the proper corporate authority and errors in the public records. However, historically, these problems have not amounted to a high percentage of the losses paid by the insurers. A more significant percentage of losses paid by the insurers are the result of errors and omissions in the title examining process itself.|$|R
40|$|In the {{research}} ethics literature, {{there is strong}} disagreement about the ethical acceptability of placebo-controlled trials, particularly when a tested therapy aims to alleviate a condition for which standard treatment exists. Recently, this disagreement {{has given rise to}} debate over the moral appropriateness of the principle of clinical equipoise for medical research. Underlying these debates are two fundamentally different visions of the moral obligations that investigators owe their subjects. Some commentators and ethics documents claim that physicians, whether acting as care givers or researchers, have the same duty of beneficence towards their patients and subjects: namely, that they must provide optimal medical care. In discussing placebo surgery in research on refractory Parkinson 2 ̆ 7 s disease, Peter Clark succinctly states this view: “The researcher has an ethical responsibility to act {{in the best interest of}} subjects. ” The Declaration of Helsinki, a leading code of ethics for clinical research, also appears to accept this ethical view when it embraces the physician 2 ̆ 7 s oath, “The health of my patient will be my first consideration. ” We, however, argue that researchers owe significant moral obligations to patient-subjects, but do not have the same duty of therapeutic beneficence that binds physicians treating patients. Thus far, while both sides have provided reasons for their respective views and critiques of contrary perspectives, neither side has shown how its view is rooted in and justified by a more general account of what we morally owe to each other. This paper provides that needed, theoretical moral justification for distinguishing the ethical guidelines governing medical care and research, respectively. We examine whether there are legitimate reasons for patient-subjects to demand the ethical orientation of therapeutic beneficence in {{the research}} setting, and whether there are otherwise good reasons from the physician-researchers 2 ̆ 7 perspective to conclude that they owe their subjects the same duties owed to patients under medical care. Our inquiry is limited to normal competent adults as the set of potential research subjects, recognizing that the ethics of conducting research on children and <b>mentally</b> <b>incompetent</b> <b>persons</b> requires separate treatment...|$|R

40|$|With {{the case}} of Belgium as a {{negative}} example, this paper will evaluate the legitimacy of using <b>mentally</b> <b>incompetents</b> as organ sources. The first section examines the underlying moral dilemma that results from the necessity of balancing the principle of respect for persons with the obligation {{to help people in}} desperate need. We argue for the rejection of a radical utilitarian approach but also question the appropriateness of a categorical prohibition. Section two aims to strike a fair balance between the competing interests at stake and to define the conditions under which organ harvest from <b>mentally</b> <b>incompetents</b> might be morally acceptable. To this end, we morally assess the main requirements that have been put forward to allow organ removal from incompetent donors. We conclude that the current Belgian legislation is far too permissive and that national regulations that do not permit the harvest of non-regenerable organs from <b>mentally</b> <b>incompetents</b> in exceptional circumstances are too restrictive. On the basis of this discussion, we propose a number of guiding principles for decision-making in this area...|$|R
