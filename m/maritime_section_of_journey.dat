25|$|The region, {{together}} {{with part of}} South Asia, was well known by the Europeans as the East Indies or simply the Indies until the 20th century. Chinese sources referred the region as 南洋 (Nanyang), which literally means the Southern Ocean. The mainland <b>section</b> <b>of</b> Southeast Asia is referred as Indochina by European geographer due to its location between China and Indian subcontinent and cultural influences from both neighboring regions. In the 20th century however, the term became more restricted to former French Indochina territory (Cambodia, Laos, and Vietnam). The <b>maritime</b> <b>section</b> <b>of</b> Southeast Asia {{is also known as}} Malay Archipelago, a term derived from the European concept of a Malay race.

40|$|There are continual debates {{regarding}} {{the effectiveness of}} United Nations Security Council Resolutions (UNSCR) 1803 and 1929 as tools for limiting the Islamic Republic of Irans goals for a nuclear program. This thesis examines the enforceability <b>of</b> the <b>maritime</b> <b>sections</b> <b>of</b> both resolutions at the police level in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries. Arab nations along the Arabian Gulf have had long-standing maritime trade relations with Iran and the greater Indian Ocean that extend generations into history. This relationship led to the extensive merging of Arab and Persian cultures in the GCC, {{as well as the}} growth of an immigrant workforce from South Asia. With this influx of identities and nationalities, challenges were developed in enforcing both resolutions, specifically {{as it relates to the}} inspection of Iranian maritime cargo. Alongside this merging of cultures, is the growth of successful maritime drug-smuggling networks that weapons proliferators could exploit to intentionally violate UNSCR 1803 and 1929. Based on the challenges of maritime trade, cultural and national identity, as well as criminal activity, it is argued that both resolutions are an unnatural fit in the Arabian Gulf, and are therefore questionable as policy choices in the GCC countries.

3000|$|Beneficial Cargo Owners (BCOs) {{are often}} {{represented}} by Ocean Transportation Intermediaries (OTI’s) {{in the form}} of Freight Forwarders, Non-Vessel Operating Common Carriers (NVOCCs) and Third Party Logistics service providers. These companies are chain integrators: they organize the door-to-door chain, or part of it, including the <b>maritime</b> <b>section</b> <b>of</b> transportation and land transport. In this role, they function as direct customers of shipping lines as they typically book the shipments and organize the chain around them. When shipping lines move towards supply chain integration through door to door service they become competitors of their customers. OTIs are thus in the odd position of being positively and negatively impacted by poor alliance performance. On the one hand, OTIs are impacted by delayed vessel calls, poorly aligned chassis supply and changing carrier alliances {{in the same way as}} BCOs. On the other hand, OTI’s sell themselves and make their money as supply chain experts who help their shipper customers navigate the complexities of international shipping. Who is best positioned to achieve (and want) a better supply chain integration: the representatives of the cargo-owners or the shipping lines? To put a cynical spin on it; what benefit would have standardized service metrics to enhance SCI provided either party? Would it not be better to keep actual performance measures somewhat vague? Given the increasing importance of these questions, how can alliances use standards for service differentiation and strategic planning? [...]...|$|R

40|$|Gazprom is {{determined}} to continue its efforts to build the South Stream gas pipeline regardless of the slump on the European gas market {{and the fact that}} there is sufficient capacity already in the existing transport infrastructure. The official inauguration <b>of</b> the <b>maritime</b> <b>section</b> <b>of</b> South Stream was held on 7 December this year, but the construction itself will commence in 2014. The agreements concluded so far, both intergovernmental and between corporations, are necessary for the launch of the construction of the new pipeline, but still do not guarantee that the project will be completed on time. First of all, some legal problems have yet to be resolved, such as the evaluation of the compliance of the planned actions with the ‘third energy package’ or the fact that ecological surveys required under European law need to be carried out. Secondly, given the present situation on the European gas market and medium-term forecasts, the high cost of implementation of this project and the maintenance expenses of existing pipelines – which are not being used to full capacity – the new project seems to be unfeasible. However, Gazprom’s determination in its efforts to build the pipeline proves that Russia is ready to take a high economic risk to maintain its dominant position on the European gas supply market; it will restrict the possibilities of alternative infrastructural projects being implemented (above all, the EU’s Southern Corridor) and use the construction of new pipelines as an instrument of political pressure on the present transit countries (especially Ukraine) ...|$|R
