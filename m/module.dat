The rear-docking Gemini would have simply remained attached to the cargo <b>module,</b> with the crew boarding the station through it. Its docking would have been controlled by its own crew, from a station {{at the back of the}} cargo <b>module.</b>|$|E
5|$|A {{powerful}} way {{of studying}} rings is through their modules. A <b>module</b> {{consists of a}} choice of ring, another set, usually distinct from the underlying set of the ring and called the underlying set of the <b>module,</b> an operation on pairs of elements of the underlying set of the <b>module,</b> and an operation which takes {{an element of the}} ring and an element of the <b>module</b> and returns an element of the <b>module.</b> The underlying set of the <b>module</b> and its operation must form a group. A <b>module</b> is a ring-theoretic version of a group representation: Ignoring the second ring operation and the operation on pairs of <b>module</b> elements determines a group representation. The real utility of modules is that the kinds of modules that exist and their interactions, reveal the structure of the ring in ways that are not apparent from the ring itself. An important special case of this is an algebra. (The word algebra means both a subject within mathematics as well as an object studied in the subject of algebra.) An algebra consists of a choice of two rings and an operation which takes an element from each ring and returns an element of the second ring. This operation makes the second ring into a <b>module</b> over the first. Often the first ring is a field.|$|E

In this paper, we {{construct}} {{two different}} classes of Virasoro <b>modules</b> from twisting Harish-Chandra <b>modules</b> over the twisted Heisenberg-Virasoro algebra by an automorphism of the twisted Heisenberg-Virasoro algebra. Weight <b>modules</b> {{in the first}} class are some irreducible highest weight <b>modules</b> over the twisted Heisenberg-Virasoro algebra. The non-weight <b>modules</b> in the first class are irreducible Whittaker <b>modules</b> over the Virasoro algebra.
