40|$|Mixtures of ruminal {{bacteria}} degraded benzo(b) thien- 4 -yl methylcarbamate (<b>Mobam)</b> to 4 -hydroxybenzothiophene, CO 2, and polar product(s). The metabolite, 4 -hydroxybenzothiophene, {{was identified}} (after acetylation) by comparative infrared and mass spectrometry with an authentic sample. Carbon dioxide and polar product(s) were produced by {{degradation of the}} methylcarbamate moiety. Ten previously characterized strains of ruminal bacteria with diverse physiological capabilities did not degrade <b>Mobam.</b> However, three tributyrin-hydrolyzing strains were isolated that did degrade <b>Mobam.</b> <b>Mobam</b> inhibited growth of two of ten strains isolated on Mobam-free glycerol-tributyrin enrichment medium. One of these strains was also sensitive to 2 -carbomethoxy-propene- 2 yl dimethyl phosphate (Phosdrin). <b>Mobam</b> prevented some ruminal bacteria from producing zones of hydrolysis in tributyrin emulsion media and inhibited some ruminal bacteria from degrading 1 -naphthyl acetate and fluorescein- 3 ′, 6 ′-diacetate...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1968 In vitro {{studies of}} <b>Mobam</b> (4 -benzo(b) thienyl N-methylcarbamate) {{metabolism}} {{have demonstrated that}} at least three ether soluble metabolites are formed in a microsomal system fortified with reduced triphosphopyridine nucleotide (NADPH). One of the metabolites was identical to 4 HBT (4 -hydroxy benzothiophene), the phenol of <b>Mobam.</b> The other two metabolites did not possess the carbonyl carbon of <b>Mobam</b> and therefore involved hydrolysis of the ester linkage. Water soluble metabolites of <b>Mobam</b> and 4 HBT were produced by NADPH-dependent microsomal reactions. One of the metabolites contained the carbonyl carbon of <b>Mobam</b> but not the ring moiety. The added cofactors UDPGA (uridine diphosphoglucuronic acid) and ATP/SO₄[subscript =]/Mg⁺⁺ resulted {{in the formation of}} specific metabolites of the ring moiety. One of these products is tentatively identified as the glucuronide of 4 HBT. No reaction between the carbamic acid portion of the carbamate and UDPGA was observed. In vivo metabolism of <b>Mobam</b> or 4 HBT led to the rapid excretion or expiration of the metabolic products. Approximately 80 % of the ring moiety and more than 40 % of the carbonyl carbon were excreted in the urine within 72 hours after treatment of the rat. An additional one-fourth of the carbonyl carbon was expired as carbon dioxide indicating hydrolysis of the ester linkage and splitting of the C-N bond of the carbamic acid. Besides expired carbon dioxide, four other in vivo metabolites were characterized by their paper chromatographic Rf values. One of these metabolites arose from the carbamic acid moiety and the other three contained the ring structure but not the carbonyl carbon. One of the ring metabolites is tentatively identified as the glucuronide of 4 HBT and another may be the sulfate conjugate of 4 HBT. Each of the major metabolites of <b>Mobam</b> was also excreted by rats treated with 4 HBT, demonstrating the close relationship between the metabolic fate of <b>Mobam</b> and its phenol...|$|E
