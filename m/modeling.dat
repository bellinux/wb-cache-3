40|$|To {{validate}} {{an estimated}} <b>model</b> {{and to have}} a good understanding of its reliability is a central aspect of System Identification. This contribution discusses these aspects in the light of <b>model</b> error <b>models</b> that are explicit descriptions of the <b>model</b> error. A <b>model</b> error <b>model</b> is implicitly present in most <b>model</b> validation methods, so the concept is more of a representation form than a set of new techniques. Traditional <b>model</b> validation is essentially a test of whether the confidence region of the <b>model</b> error <b>model</b> contains the zero <b>model.</b> However, the <b>model</b> error <b>model</b> allows a better visualization of the possible deficiencies of the nominal <b>model.</b> Based on such information, the nominal <b>model</b> may very well be accepted even if the <b>model</b> error <b>model</b> does not contain the zero <b>model.</b> Conversely, it will be illustrated that the <b>model</b> error <b>model</b> may give good reason - because of if its more precise infomation - to reject a nominal <b>model,</b> that has passed a conventional <b>model</b> validation test...|$|R

25|$|Computational <b>modeling</b> {{is a tool}} used in {{mathematical}} {{psychology and}} cognitive psychology to simulate behavior. This method has several advantages. Since modern computers process information quickly, simulations can be run in a short time, allowing for high statistical power. <b>Modeling</b> also allows psychologists to visualize hypotheses about the functional organization of mental events that couldn't be directly observed in a human. Connectionism uses neural networks to simulate the brain. Another method is symbolic <b>modeling,</b> which represents many mental objects using variables and rules.
