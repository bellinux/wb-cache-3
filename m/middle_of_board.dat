50|$|The Colition for On-Board Optics (COBO) was {{established}} in 2014 to provide {{a home for the}} standardization of optical interfaces that were located on the <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> <b>boards</b> rather than on the front panel.|$|R
5000|$|Black {{traditionally}} starts first, {{and must}} remove {{one of his}} pieces from the <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> the <b>board,</b> or {{from one of the}} four corners <b>of</b> the <b>board.</b> (There are 4 pieces, 2 black and 2 white diagonally opposite each other, that form a 2×2 square array in the <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> the <b>board.</b> Black can either remove one of those two black pieces, or remove a black piece from one of the four corners <b>of</b> the <b>board.)</b> The four corners <b>of</b> the <b>board</b> will also consist of two black pieces and two white pieces that are diagonally opposite from each other.|$|R
50|$|The {{winner of}} the game is the first one to make an exact roll to land in the volcano in the <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> the <b>board.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Irving Chernev {{included}} five of Kasparyan's compositions in {{his book}} 200 Brilliant Endgames. This study uses a [...] "model mate" [...] in the <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> the <b>board.</b>|$|R
50|$|Fried-Schlechter, Vienna 1894, From's Gambit (A02), 0-1 A breezy 14-move win by Schlechter, who sacrifices his {{queen and}} mates his opponent's king in the <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> the <b>board.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{first player}} {{to reach the}} <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> the game <b>board</b> wins.|$|R

5000|$|Players {{decide which}} animal to play. Depending on the versions, the hounds will usually {{be placed on}} one end <b>of</b> the <b>board</b> while the hare will {{be placed in the}} <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> the <b>board</b> or dropped onto any vacant point on the board in the first move.|$|R
25|$|Two {{zones in}} the <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> the <b>board,</b> each 2×2, cannot be entered by either player's pieces at any time. They are shown as lakes on the {{battlefield}} and serve as choke points to make frontal assaults less direct.|$|R
5000|$|... 1. Initial {{positions}} of the pieces vary depending upon the variant. Usually the bear {{is placed in the}} <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> the <b>board,</b> and the hunters are placed together on one end <b>of</b> the <b>board.</b> One player plays the hunters (normally three pieces), and the other player plays the bear.|$|R
5000|$|A piece cannot move {{backward}} (e.g., a {{piece in}} the <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> an empty <b>board</b> would have five available moves).|$|R
5000|$|The smaller empty socket in the <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> the <b>board</b> {{was used}} to set the memory map of the RAM, ROM and I/O {{expansion}} by fitting or soldering wires between various positions according to the instructions in the Acorn System 1 Technical Manual.|$|R
50|$|The {{board is}} used as follows:One {{to all of the}} {{participants}} in the séance place one or two fingers on the planchette which is in the <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> the <b>board.</b> The appointed medium asks questions of the spirit(s) with whom they are attempting to communicate.|$|R
5000|$|King safety: The king is {{somewhat}} exposed in the <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> the <b>board.</b> Measures {{must be taken}} to reduce his vulnerability. It is therefore common for both players either to castle in the opening (simultaneously developing one of the rooks) or to otherwise bring the king to the side <b>of</b> the <b>board</b> via artificial castling.|$|R
30|$|At {{pressing}} {{temperatures of}} 190 and 210 °C, the air injection lowered the temperature <b>of</b> the <b>middle</b> layer <b>of</b> the <b>boards.</b>|$|R
50|$|The game {{starts with}} X playing {{wherever}} he wants {{in any of}} the 81 empty spots. This move 'sends' his opponent to its relative location. For example, if X played in the <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> his local <b>board,</b> then O needs to play next in the local <b>board</b> in the <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> the global <b>board.</b> O can then play in any one of the nine available spots in the top-right local board, each move sending X to a different local board.|$|R
50|$|The {{board is}} an 11 x 11 square grid (or a 10 x 10 square board) with pieces {{played on the}} {{intersection}} points. A 2 x 2 empty square {{is made in the}} <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> the <b>board.</b> To be more specific, the <b>middle</b> point <b>of</b> the <b>board</b> is removed along with the four segments connected to it. Also, four diagonal lines from the four corners <b>of</b> the <b>board</b> connect to the four corners of the 2 x 2 empty square. The diagonal lines have no structural relevance to the game, they are just an aid in setting up the pieces on the <b>board</b> in one <b>of</b> over thirty possible patterns. In this article, only two patterns are described. There is a total of 120 intersection points for the pieces to be played upon.|$|R
25|$|A match (much like tennis) {{consists}} {{of more than}} one game, often an odd number. The match points are scored on the cribbage board using the holes reserved for match points. On a spiral board, these are often at the bottom <b>of</b> the <b>board</b> in a line with 5 or 7 holes. On a conventional board, they are often in the <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> the <b>board</b> or at the top or bottom.|$|R
5000|$|In the beginning, each player's six {{pieces are}} set up on their {{respective}} triangle. The only vacant point is the common vertex {{which is also the}} <b>middle</b> point <b>of</b> the <b>board.</b>|$|R
50|$|A match (much like tennis) {{consists}} {{of more than}} one game, often an odd number (3 games, 5 games, 7 games etc.). The match points are scored on the cribbage board using the holes reserved for match points. On a spiral board, these are often at the bottom <b>of</b> the <b>board</b> in a line with 5 or 7 holes. On a traditional board, they are often placed in the <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> the <b>board</b> or at the top/bottom.|$|R

50|$|If {{any player}} wants to {{interrupt}} the game {{in order to avoid}} the goal heading into his cage, he must clearly say a short phrase. The game is interrupted and puck placed in the <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> the <b>board</b> for the next face off. The phrase could only be said if the player keeps the puck long enough to enable his opponent to say it.|$|R
50|$|A player {{may choose}} to upgrade their colonies to spaceports. Unlike Settlers, there is no {{increased}} production to spaceports - however, ships may be deployed at intersections adjacent to spaceports, which may be convenient as the Catanian colonies are considerably distant from the planets in the <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> the <b>board</b> and the trading bases at the edges <b>of</b> the <b>board.</b> Each player begins the game with one spaceport, and may build two additional spaceports {{over the course of}} the game.|$|R
50|$|The game {{consists}} <b>of</b> a <b>board,</b> a {{movable partition}} and movable pieces. Each player has eighteen men, three cannons, and one captain or king. The game board {{is divided into}} two parts by the movable partition that is placed across the <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> the <b>board.</b> On each side of the partition, the board is divided into nine spaces, each of which corresponds to a similar space on the other side. The game is played by two persons; although three or four may participate.|$|R
5000|$|A special note {{to mention}} are those two {{orthogonal}} lines (one horizontal and one vertical) that {{run down the}} center <b>of</b> the <b>board</b> and are interrupted by the empty 2 x 2 square in the <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> the <b>board.</b> Those two lines are not continuous through the empty 2 x 2 square. Therefore, a [...] "ka" [...] cannot form a capturing line with pieces {{on the other side}} of the empty 2 x 2 square in either of those two orthogonal lines.|$|R
50|$|Each player's {{pieces are}} {{set up on the}} first two ranks of their side <b>of</b> the <b>board,</b> and on the right two squares (from their point of view) of the third rank which is the <b>middle</b> rank <b>of</b> the <b>board.</b> Only the central square <b>of</b> the <b>board</b> is empty in the beginning.|$|R
50|$|An {{octagonal}} {{board is}} used. Lines connect each {{corner of the}} octagon to its opposite corner. The eight lines intersect at the <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> the octagonal <b>board.</b> There is a total of 9 intersection points or spaces for pieces to be played at.|$|R
5000|$|... 2. Each player's {{three pieces}} are {{initially}} {{next to each}} other in a row on the perimeter points of the octagon facing opposite the other player's three pieces which are also {{next to each other}} in a row on the perimeter of the octagon. This leaves three empty spaces left. One empty space is the <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> the <b>board.</b> The other two empty spaces separate the two rows of pieces on both sides.|$|R
50|$|Hare {{games are}} two-player {{abstract}} strategy board games that were popular in medieval northern Europe {{up until the}} 19th century. In this game, a hare {{is trying to get}} past three dogs who are trying to surround it and trap it. The three dogs are represented by three pieces which normally start on one end <b>of</b> the <b>board,</b> and the hare is represented by one piece that usually starts in the <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> the <b>board</b> or is dropped on any vacant point {{in the beginning of the}} game.|$|R
50|$|The fox {{is placed}} in the <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> the <b>board,</b> and 13 geese are placed on one side <b>of</b> the <b>board.</b> The fox and geese can move to any empty space around them (also diagonally). The fox can jump over geese like in checkers, {{capturing}} them. Repeated jumps are possible. Geese can not jump. Unlike in Halatafl, capturing is not mandatory. The geese win if they surround the fox so that it cannot move. The fox wins if it captures enough geese so that the remaining geese cannot surround it.|$|R
5000|$|Only feudal lords (pawns) are on {{the board}} in the initial position. The game starts with the Red player (depicted here having white pieces), {{followed}} by the Black player, placing their other pieces arbitrarily on their own halves <b>of</b> the <b>board</b> (known as sit-tee or troops deployment): chariots can be put on any squ{{are on the}} back rank. In official tournaments, a small curtain is used on the <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> the <b>board</b> to prevent the players seeing each other's deployment during the sit-tee phase. One of the possible game openings {{is shown in the}} diagram.|$|R
50|$|A classic {{footwork}} step {{in which}} you put {{one foot in the}} <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> the <b>board,</b> step to the nose with the back foot, and bring the nose to the back, spinning the board 180 around the center foot. With practice this move can be done quite fast and many times in a row - or even backwards - but it is generally better to do it slower while maintaining balance to create an illusion of speed.|$|R
50|$|Similar to a boardslide {{only the}} skater turns 90 degrees {{so that the}} {{trailing}} trucks are placed over the rail/ledge/coping and the skater slides on the <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> the <b>board.</b> Considered more complex than a boardslide due the rotation over the obstacle at the beginning into the trick and the re-entry or dismount. Note {{that in this case}} a frontside lipslide involves facing forwards while a backside lipslide involves facing backwards. Also known as a Disaster slide.|$|R
5000|$|At {{the start}} of the game, each player chooses two objects from a list {{provided}} and creates plasticine sculptures of each, and places them in the <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> the <b>board.</b> Each player places on the board three tokens: a magician, a witches' hat and an Elfstone. The hats are placed on the scoring track; the elfstones are placed on the elfstone track, and the magicians are placed on the space marked [...] "A". Each player receives three curse tokens.|$|R
