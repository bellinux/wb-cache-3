The predictions for the <b>mixed</b> <b>bladed</b> rotor configuration range from fair to good.

For near surface to intermediate contamination zones, either standard construction equipment (i.e. bucket mixing), or specialized soil mixing tools (i.e. Lang Tool, Allu Tool, Alpine, etc.) can be used. Deep soil mixing requires specialized auger mixing equipment. In order to apply this method in-situ and in deep soil, the oxidant must be pumped to the point of mixing using a kelly bar (a piece of earth drilling equipment), or appropriate piping to the place where the soil needs to be oxidized.

Some are called single pass soil stabilizers because they can make soil cement in one pass where some of these machines take up to four passes.

30|$|Heterogenization: {{detection}} and avoidance Cyclopentane {{tests showed that}} the generated slurries can be dispersed or segregated slurries. The type of slurry formed may depend on the fluid mixture charged to the system, operating conditions and additives used. Figure  6 shows a hypothetical torque response during hydrate formation. Heterogeneous slurries may result from severe agglomeration or settling of hydrate particles. Figure  6 also shows the effect of some unit operations and experimental conditions on the resulting viscosity and slurry type. On the other hand, torque signature may give indications whether the slurry is dispersed/ homogenous (no concentration gradient) or heterogeneous (with concentration gradient). This is important because viscosity can only be established with homogeneous systems. During shaft speed ramping, if solids agglomerate towards the <b>mixing</b> <b>blade,</b> torque is expected to rise. However, if the agglomerating solids {{move away from the}} blades, i.e., toward the wall, torque measurements decrease.

40|$|In a wet {{agglomeration}} process occuring {{in a low}} shear mixer, {{the function}} of the blade is to promote emergence of stable agglomerates and to homogenize the liquid sprayed on the powder surface. The design of the bowl and the <b>mixing</b> <b>blade</b> along with the values of the process parameters (load, rotation speed, etc.) contribute to the agglomeration mechanisms. In this work a preliminary approach is conducted to study the mechanical input during agglomeration through the analysis of static and dynamic stress distributions (by force measurements) and particles' motions (by visualizations through a transparent wall) in the powder bed, using an experimental mixing cell. A characteristic depth is identified as a representative parameter of the static state of a laterally confined semolina bed. This characteristic depth is implied when the granular medium is submitted to a vertical mechanical stress. For wet agglomerates, the static distribution of vertical stresses can be approximated by the Janssen's model. Under dynamic conditions, a correlation is found between the mechanical resistance of agglomerates and the maximum vertical stress according to the water content. In the context of wet agglomeration in a mixing device, these results allow to consider the role of the characteristic length in the mixing bowl. (C) 2012 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|One-dimensional models {{predict the}} {{performance}} of centrifugal compressor in short time, being a helpful design tool in the early design stages. They assume uniform flow through the compressor. Conservation of mass, momentum and energy and some empirical loss correlations are applied to estimate the real outputs. In this thesis, this one-dimensional approach is applied to model a turbocharger compressor. Two different models are implemented. They consist of an impeller, a vaneless diffuser and a volute. The model stage outputs, pressure ratio and efficiency, are compared with experimental data. Then, both models are further investigated by comparing their losses prediction with validated Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) data. The implemented models are taken from literature. They use the same vaneless diffuser and volute approach, but different impeller loss sets. The next impeller losses are studied: incidence, skin friction, choking, jet-wake <b>mixing,</b> <b>blade</b> loading, hub to shroud, tip clearance, shock and distortion losses. The vaneless diffuser outlet is calculated using a one-dimensional numerical solution to the underlying differential equations. For the volute, a set of empirical losses is used. The losses from the CFD are also measured by entropy rise calculations. Due {{to the complexity of}} this model, not all the losses can be independently extracted. Incidence, choking, skin friction, blade loading and jet-wake mixing losses are measured along the impeller. Besides, vaneless diffuser and volute losses are also obtained. Results show relative total pressure ratio errors less than 5 % in 49 points in a total of 77 predicted operation conditions. 69 points are estimated with a relative error less than 10 %. CFD still gives better predictions, especially at low tip speeds. However, at high tip speeds one-dimensional gives similar accuracy. The one-dimensional and CFD losses comparison shows largest differences in the vaneless diffuser and volute models.

Then this waste wash water is directly distributed to the drainage without any treatment that could bring environmental problems. The alternative solution is to recycle the waste wash water and use it as batch water to make fresh concrete. In this study analyzes the quality of this waste wash water. Then, tests were conducted on mortar. The waste wash water meets the ASTM C 94 requirements on mixing water for ready-mix concrete. The aim of this study is to determine the compressive strength and drying shrinkage of the mortar. The specimens for compressive strength test were cured under water with different curing duration of 7, 28 and 60 days. For drying shrinkage the specimens were cured on air for 4, 11, 18 and 25 days. The results revealed the development of compressive strength were increase with increases of curing days. While the value of drying shrinkage that recorded is less during the curing durations.

40|$|Crystallization is a {{key unit}} {{operation}} in the pharmaceutical industry. Control of crystallization processes can be challenging when undesirable phenomena such as particle attrition and breakage occur. This thesis describes the controlled crystallization of pharmaceuticals and amino acids for more efficient manufacturing processes and better efficacy of products. Crystallization equipment is designed so that (1) the undesirable phenomena do not occur at all, and/or (2) the phenomena that do occur are carefully controlled. One key strategy is to exploit dual-impinging jets and multiphase flow to decouple nucleation and growth {{so that they can}} be individually controlled. Various configurations of micromixers were designed to provide controlled nucleation. Based on the dual-impinging-jet (DIJ) configuration, a physical explanation was provided for the discovery that a cooling micromixer can generate small crystals of uniform size and shape. An alternative design replaces the micromixing with the application of ultrasonication to decouple nucleation and flow rates. Based on these nucleation methods, a novel continuous crystallizer is designed where the slurry flow is combined with an air flow to induce a multiphase hydrodynamic instability that spontaneously generates slugs where the crystals continue to grow. These slugs are well-mixed without having the <b>mixing</b> <b>blades</b> in traditional crystallizer designs that induce undesirable uncontrolled crystallization phenomena. Another key strategy is to increase the degrees of freedom in the dynamic operation of the crystallizers. In the slug-flow continuous crystallizer, extra degrees of freedom for control of the crystal growth are created by spatially varying the temperature profile along the tube. In a semi-continuous crystallizer configuration, continuous seeding using a DIJ mixer is combined with growth rate control in a stirred tank to experimentally demonstrate the manufacture of uniform-sized crystals. In addition, temperature-cycling experiments are designed in batch crystallizers to substantially change crystal shape with only a small number of cycles. Experimental validation confirms that the proposed crystallizer designs reduce production time and equipment cost by orders of magnitude while suppressing secondary nucleation, attrition, and aggregation/agglomeration-dominant but undesired phenomena that worsen the ability to control the properties of crystals produced by most existing crystallizer designs. by Mo Jiang.

40|$|Nowadays Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC) {{power systems}} are of {{paramount}} importance to exploit waste heat and renewable energy sources. Standard design rules and empirical models are mostly available for steam/gas turbines {{and can not be}} directly applied for ORC. Because of this, a redefinition of the design strategy is needed, starting from the turbine concept, passing through dedicated preliminary design optimization and eventually arriving at a complete new redefinition of the optimal blade profiles through advanced optimization methodologies. To fill the gap between (zero-dimensional) mean-line analysis and 3 D fluid-dynamic analysis a Turbomachinery Blade Modeler (TBM) is required. The modeler not only gives direct control of the blade geometry but also provides valuable feedback of the design. This allows the user to construct a good initial design before refining it with more computationally expensive methods. The TBM is developed using the python API {{within the framework of the}} open source software FreeCAD. Furthermore, it is also tightly coupled to two mesh generators, an in-house one UMG (Unstructured Mesh Generator) and to the open source Salome. This link guarantees the quasi-automatic generation of high quality CFD meshes for any kind of blade design. The approach to construct a variety of turbomachinery blades is based partially on state-of- art parametrization techniques and uses fundamental design variables such as metal blade angles, chord length and the stagger angle. The geometry is purely build up with NURBS curves and surfaces which has the benefit that sharp edges are avoided and high smoothness of the profile shape is guaranteed. NURBS include control point position, weight and curve degree which allow a flexible control of the shape without introducing many variables, which is beneficial in optimization routines. The TBM allows for the design of any kind of blade: these include axial, centrifugal, centripetal, radial rotors/ impellers and <b>mixed</b> <b>blades.</b> Moreover, to aid the designer the flow passage area distribution can be visualized run time. The TBM has been already successfully tested for the design of a high loaded centrifugal rotor. Additionally, a complex twisted and flared axial compressor, the NASA Rotor 67 was reconstructed using the TBM. The small differences between the reference geometry and the reconstructed one were evaluated with 2 D CFD simulations. Finally, a design of a radial-inflow turbine was reproduced and meshed for future analysis. The parametric 3 D turbomachinery blade modeler has proven to be a very powerful tool for designing turbine and compressor stator/rotors. Moreover, after the consolidation of the algorithms and a direct coupling with the CFD solver SU 2, the tool will be ready to be used as a turbomachinery optimization environment.

40|$|Morphology {{evolution}} in the melting regime during compounding of immiscible polymer blends. {{where most of the}} size scale reduction occurs. is studied. Starting from an initial solid pellet mixture of two components. the progression to the final two-phase viscoelastic melt involves an intermediate stage where either one or both the components are melting or softening. Our focus is identifying and quantifying the factors that determine morphologies in the melting regime. We identify blend systems that exhibit a transformation in morphology from a minor-component continuous phase with dispersed major component domains to that with the major component being the continuous matrix phase. as a function of mixing time. This phenomenon of phase inversion during compounding is demonstrated to occur even in blends with a higher melting point minor component. A low solid modulus and a low melt viscosity are shown to favor the formation of the continuous phase by the minor component. Polycaprolactone/polyethylene. polystyrene/polyethylene. polycarbonate/ polyethylene, poly(ethylene-co-cyclohexane dimethylene terephthalate) / polyethylene. and polybutylene/polycaprolactone blends were studied. These model blends were chosen based on the melt viscosity ratio and the relative softening temperatures of the two components. These two parameters were used to develop a two-dimensional framework for summarizing the compounding behavior of blends. For compounding runs {{with a small amount of}} the minor component (- 1 Owt. %) at a constant mixer temperature, phase inversion was observed for blend viscosity ratios less than 0. 2. irrespective of the relative transition temperatures of the two components. Using a temperature ramping program resulted in the low melting component forming the continuous phase initially. Selective dissolution studies were used to quantify the amount of minor component present in the continuous phase at different mixing times. A polystyrene/polyethylene blend with a melt viscosity ratio of - 0. 001. was used to study the effect of batch size on the time required to form a continuous phase of the compounding of batch sizes ranging from 12 g to 240 g. Upon a five-fold increase in batch size the time to phase inversion increased by a factor of 3. This increase was explained by a combination of reduced heat conduction and reduced mechanical energy input to the batch. To enable studies at different batch sizes in the same mixing bowl, a novel <b>mixing</b> <b>blade</b> with modular elements was designed and constructed. This design was used for both radial and axial scaleup studies. The effect of changing the blade configuration on the time to phase inversion was explained using a specific relative stagger parameter, which is a measure of the effectiveness of stress transfer to the batch. Flow visualization using a glass window and blend sampling was used to develop a detailed description of the deformation steps leading to phase inversion in a model low viscosity ratio blend. Intermediate morphologies of flattened pellets, stacks of pellets, fibers and clusters were identified. Based on these observations a micro-structural model was developed to predict the time to phase inversion. The model incorporates a simplified flow-field approximation and calculates the strain in the major component. A strain-based criterion was proposed which in conjunction with the model yielded an explicit expression for the time to phase inversion. Model predictions of the dependence of time to phase inversion on nominal maximum-shear-rate in the mixer, volume fraction of the minor component and blend viscosity ratio were shown to be in excellent agreement with experimental results. by Ramabhadra Ratnagiri.

In {{order to}} explore the effect of {{vibrating}} mixing technology in industrial production of concrete, the influence of vibrating mixing and common forced mixing on the mixing quality and efficiency were comparatively investigated by field tests of concrete mixing plant. The vibrating mixing scheme was achieved by adopting <b>mixing</b> shaft and <b>blades</b> as vibrating source based on conventional twin-shaft mixer. The field tests included mixing time test and reducing cement test. The experimental results show that under different mixing time, the freshly mixed concrete by both mixing methods have similar uniformity but the hardened concrete have distinctive compression strength; comparing with common forced mixing, vibrating mixing makes the materials in vibrating status to destroy their sticky connection and distribute cement particles, so both 7 d and 28 d compression strength are significantly improved and the mixing time is reduced; with the cement reduction, the compression strength of concrete by both mixing methods decrease, but comparing with common forced mixing, vibrating mixing can save cement under the condition of ensuring necessary concrete strength due to its improved cement utilization...|$|R
5000|$|A Wet mix Concrete Plants, {{combines}} {{some or all}} of {{the above}} ingredients (including water) at a central location into a Concrete Mixer - that is, the concrete is mixed at a single point, and then simply agitated on the way to the jobsite to prevent setting (using agitors or ready mix trucks) or hauled to the jobsite in an open-bodied dump truck. Dry mix differ from Wet mix plants in that Wet Mix contain a central mixer whereas dry, which can offer a more consistent mixture in a shorter time (generally 5 minutes or less). Dry mix plants typically see more break strength standard deviation and variation from load to load because of inconsistencies in <b>mix</b> times, truck <b>blade</b> and drum conditions, traffic conditions, etc. With a Central Mix plant, all loads see the same mixing action and there is an initial quality control point when discharging from the central mixer. Certain plants combine both Dry and Wet characteristics for increased production or for seasonality. le A Mobile batch plant can be constructed on a large job site.|$|R
