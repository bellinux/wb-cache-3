50|$|An engineer's vice, {{also known}} as a {{metalworking}} vice or machinist's vice, is used to clamp metal instead of wood. It is used to hold metal when filing or cutting. It is sometimes made of cast steel or <b>malleable</b> <b>cast</b> iron, but most are made of cast iron. However, most heavy duty vices are 55,000 psi cast steel or 65,000 psi ductile iron. Some vices have a cast iron body but a steel channel bar. Cast iron is popular because it is typically 30 ksi grey iron which is rigid, strong and inexpensive. The jaws are often separate and replaceable, usually engraved with serrated or diamond teeth. Soft jaw covers made of aluminum, copper, wood (for woodworking) or plastic may be used to protect delicate work.

50|$|Malleable iron {{starts as}} a white iron casting that is then heat treated {{for a day or}} two at about 950 C and then cooled over a day or two. As a result, the carbon in iron carbide {{transforms}} into graphite and ferrite plus carbon (austenite). The slow process allows the surface tension to form the graphite into spheroidal particles rather than flakes. Due to their lower aspect ratio, the spheroids are relatively short and far from one another, and have a lower cross section vis-a-vis a propagating crack or phonon. They also have blunt boundaries, as opposed to flakes, which alleviates the stress concentration problems found in grey cast iron. In general, the properties of <b>malleable</b> <b>cast</b> iron are more like those of mild steel. There is a limit to how large a part can be cast in malleable iron, as it is made from white cast iron.|$|E
50|$|Fig 4 shows a 10-inch {{studless}} Palliser shell Mk II {{with automatic}} gas-check. The gas-check {{is the same}} as the one in Fig 3. However, in contrast to Fig 3, the protrusion on the base of the shell in Fig 4 is not part of the shell, but is instead a wrought iron disc attached to the shell by the screw plug. Initially, all studless shells 9 - 17.72 inches, including Palliser shells, were made in one piece as in Fig 3. These shells were identified as Mark I. However, it was found that casting Palliser shells in brittle metal in one piece was extremely difficult, especially for smaller calibres, and that the protusions were liable to chipping during handling. As a result, later Palliser shells 9 - 12.5 inches were made in two pieces as in Fig 4, and identified as Mark II. The separate protrusions were made from wrought iron, cast steel or <b>malleable</b> <b>cast</b> iron.|$|E
5000|$|Steel {{contains}} {{a relatively small}} percentage of carbon, which can migrate freely within the gamma iron. When austenized steel is exposed to air {{for long periods of}} time, the carbon content in the steel can be lowered. This is the opposite from what happens when steel is heated in a reducing environment, in which carbon slowly diffuses further into the metal. In an oxidizing environment, the carbon can readily diffuse outwardly, so austenized steel is very susceptible to decarburization. This is often used for cast steel, where a high carbon-content is needed for casting, but a lower carbon-content is desired in the finished product. It is often used on cast-irons to produce <b>malleable</b> <b>cast</b> iron, in a process called [...] "white tempering." [...] This tendency to decarburize is often a problem in other operations, such as blacksmithing, where it becomes more desirable to austenize the steel for the shortest amount of time possible to prevent too much decarburization.|$|E
5000|$|In 1818, Boyden {{received}} {{a piece of}} German manufactured patent leather (said to be a German military cap front) from a local carriage manufacturer and used that to investigate the possibility of creating a version of leather in the United States that was treated {{in such a way}} that the material would be decidedly more dressy than work boots and similar leather goods, but retained its desirable qualities of protection and durability. To reverse engineer the European patent leather, Boyden set up a shed at the <b>Malleable</b> <b>Cast</b> Iron Foundry of Condit & Bowles at 25 Orange in Newark, New Jersey (...) and ultimately discovered a way to produce his own patent leather. Using a formula that was based on a series of treatments using layers of linseed oil-based coats, the new shiny leather began commercial production on 20 September 1819. Boyden’s efforts resulted in the production of glossy leather that quickly caught on as a complement for formal dress. Ironically, Boyden never patented his inventive patent leather process.|$|E

The appropriate generating system of oil mist is constructed and the specified turning tool with oil hole is used. In order to verify the cooling effect of MQL, the tool temperature at the flank face is measured using a newly assembled fiber-coupled two-color pyrometer. In this new technique, a sensing fiber is inserted into a small hole that extends to the outer surface of the tubelike workpiece and it rotates with the workpiece. The thermal radiation accepted by a sensing fiber is noncontactly transmitted to the other fixed fiber {{and led to the}} two-color detectors. As for cutting force in turning of SCM 440 H, MQL is more effective in low cutting speed below 100 m/min. The tool temperature in MQL turning is approximately 100 °C lower than that in dry turning over the wide range of 30 ∼ 300 m/min.

40|$|In {{this work}} {{a method for}} the fatigue life {{estimation}} of components from materials which fail with only little deformation under multiaxial stochastic loading with different grades of correlation was determined and verified by tests. Two different materials of nodular iron (GGG 40 and GGG 60) as well as <b>malleable</b> <b>cast</b> iron (GTS 45) were available. The multiaxial stochastic loading resulted from the superposition of tensile and torsional loading. Two extreme cases for the grade of correlation of both loads, the linear correlated and the uncorrelated loading were taken into account. For the failure in each case nominal strains in the most highly loaded cross-section are decisive. The characteristic quantities for the fatigue life estimation under linear correlated loading {{are based on the}} nominal strain hypothesis, for the uncorrelated loading the method of reference strain was introduced. The reference strain is not only a value related to the material behaviour, but takes also account for the statistical interaction of the uncorrelated loads based on the independance of casual values. Test and calculation correspondingly show for the uncorrelated loaded components a higher fatigue life by about factor of 2 compared to the results with linear correlated loaded samples if the same particular characteristic values of loading (peak values of spectra) boundary conditions (shape of spectra and stress ratio) are chosen.

Especially ships with size of 30 GT has problem with low {{availability of the}} ship engine, {{which most of the}} ships still use non marine diesel engine as its main propulsion. The problem gives interest to make a step to improve by design marine diesel engine using reverse engineering method. Cam system of marine diesel engine design was needed to be calculate to select the material and the motion. The design of cam system needs study about the stress analysis in cam system to make sure the distribution of force and moment. The result of stress analysis was used to select material of components in cam system. The motion analysis result was used to be input data of stress analysis. The condition to obtain the stress of components was on maximum condition, its contain pressure, torque, rotation, and force. All component that calculated are camshaft, lifter (flat-tappet), push rod, rocker arm, spring, and valve. Each component was given two different materials and material selection was based on safety factor of each component. Material for camshaft and lifter were <b>malleable</b> <b>cast</b> iron, for push rod and rocker arm were mild steel, for spring was ASTM A 231, for intake valve was steel JIS SUH 3, and for exhaust valve was steel JIS SUH 35. The result of motion analysis were angular velocity of camshaft with value was 2400 deg/sec, friction force between camshaft and lifter with maximum value was 125. 393 N, and contact force between camshaft and lifter with maximum value was 845. 307 N, and linear velocity of intake valve with maximum value was 696. 573 mm/s, and linear velocity of exhaust valve was 463. 734 mm/s. </p...|$|E
