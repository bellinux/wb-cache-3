5|$|Map-making in China {{preceded the}} Han dynasty. Since two 4th-century-BCE silk maps from the State of Qin (found in Gansu, {{displaying}} the region about the Jialing River) show the measured distance between timber-gathering sites, Mei-ling Hsu argues {{that these are}} to be considered the first known economic maps (as they predate the maps of the Roman geographer Strabo, c. 64 BCEâ€“ 24 CE). Maps from the Han period have also been uncovered by modern archaeologists, such as those found with 2nd-century-BCE silk texts at Mawangdui. In contrast to the Qin maps, the Han maps found at Mawangdui employ a more diverse use of <b>map</b> <b>symbols,</b> cover a larger terrain, and display information on local populations and even pinpoint locations of military camps. One of the maps discovered at Mawangdui shows positions of Han military garrisons which were to attack Nanyue in 181 BCE.|$|E
25|$|The three Han Dynasty maps {{found at}} Mawangdui {{differ from the}} earlier Qin State maps. While the Qin maps place the {{cardinal}} direction of north {{at the top of}} the map, the Han maps are orientated with the southern direction at the top. The Han maps are also more complex, since they cover a much larger area, employ a large number of well-designed <b>map</b> <b>symbols,</b> and include additional information on local military sites and the local population. The Han maps also note measured distances between certain places, but a formal graduated scale and rectangular grid system for maps would not be usedâ€”or at least described in fullâ€”until the 3rd century (see Pei Xiu below). Among the three maps found at Mawangdui was a small map representing the tomb area where it was found, a larger topographical map showing the Han's borders along the subordinate Kingdom of Changsha and the Nanyue kingdom (of northern Vietnam and parts of modern Guangdong and Guangxi), and a map which marks the positions of Han military garrisons that were employed in an attack against Nanyue in 181 BC.|$|E
2500|$|Fred Hoffman hypothesizes that {{underlying}} Basquiat's {{sense of}} himself as an artist was his [...] "innate capacity to function as something like an oracle, distilling his perceptions {{of the outside world}} down to their essence and, in turn, projecting them outward through his creative acts." [...] Additionally, continuing his activities as a graffiti artist, Basquiat often incorporated words into his paintings. Before his career as a painter began, he produced punk-inspired postcards for sale on the street, and became known for the politicalâ€“poetical graffiti under the name of SAMO. On one occasion Basquiat painted his girlfriend's dress with the words [...] "Little Shit Brown". He would often draw on random objects and surfaces, including other people's property. The conjunction of various media is an integral element of Basquiat's art. His paintings are typically covered with text and codes of all kinds: words, letters, numerals, pictograms, logos, <b>map</b> <b>symbols,</b> diagrams and more.|$|E

40|$|A {{wide range}} of local, regional, and federal {{authorities}} will generate maps to help respond to and recover from a disaster.

Here we present preliminary results from research into {{the application of the}} ANSI 415 - 2006 INCITS Homeland Security <b>Map</b> <b>Symbol</b> Standard, a point symbol standard intended to support emergency management mapping for the U.
