30|$|Coal <b>mining</b> <b>activities</b> {{have been}} active at the study area since half a century ago. Most of the <b>mining</b> <b>activities</b> were carried out by {{inclined}} mining adits. In addition, there were numerous illegal coal <b>mining</b> <b>activities</b> operated by local residents. These small-scaled illegal <b>mining</b> <b>activities</b> were generally scattered randomly within the study area with an average mining depth of about 200  m. The <b>mining</b> <b>activities</b> undertook very minimum safety measures, whereby most of the goaves were only either supported by a temporary shoring system or even left unsupported.|$|R

The boom towns declined and the population of Dawson City fell. Gold <b>mining</b> <b>activity</b> lasted until 1903 when production peaked after heavier equipment was brought in. Since then the Klondike has been mined on and off, and today the legacy draws tourists to the region and contributes to its prosperity.|$|E
5|$|In {{the mid-19th}} century a mine was {{developed}} alongside the River Barle. The mine was originally called Wheal Maria, then changed to Wheal Eliza. It was a copper mine from 1845–54 and then an iron mine until 1857, although the first <b>mining</b> <b>activity</b> on the site may be from 1552.

40|$|Perak is a one of {{the state}} which rich in mineral {{resources}} that could be explore to provide economic contribution to the Perak State Government especially through <b>mining</b> <b>activities.</b> In the past, mining is among the main activities to generate economy to the state. Mining is found in natural form or resulting from exploration activities, creating a man-made mine. The effects of uncontrolled <b>mining</b> <b>activities</b> will cause problems such as flooding and pollution in the absence of close monitoring of the Local Authority. In helping local authorities to regulate <b>mining</b> <b>activities,</b> this research will focus on the needs of the implementation of Planning Permission as provided in Section 2 (1), Town and Country Planning Act 1976 (Act 172). With the advent of mining planning permission, {{it will be able to}} ensure that any particular development of <b>mining</b> <b>activities</b> will be controlled by the authorities such as the Local Authority (LA). This is because, the aspects that will be addressed in this mining planning permission process will cover three stages in planning process which is before, during and after <b>mining</b> <b>activities</b> carried out. Therefore, this study was undertaken to examine the current planning criteria used by the Department of Mineral and Geosciences and State Land Office in considering and approving applications for <b>mining</b> <b>activities</b> in the state, identify the factors why planning permission procedures for <b>mining</b> <b>activities</b> as described in Section 2 (1) Act 172 was not fully enforced in the state and examine the implications of planning permission for Mining. To achieve these three objectives, data collection methods for this study was obtained from the primary data and secondary data and also from the distribution of questionnaires and interviews with special technical agencies relating to planning policy makers at the state level. Based on the study results, recommendations are made for improvement of processes and procedures during the procedure to ensure that elements of planning permission for <b>mining</b> <b>activities</b> to comply with aspects of planning control has been set as the provisions of Act 172 to ensure sustainable <b>mining</b> <b>activities</b> can be implemente...|$|R

5|$|By the 1520s, Chiprovtsi {{was still}} a minor centre of <b>mining</b> <b>activity</b> {{compared}} to {{other places in the}} empire. In that period, it brought a revenue of 47,553 akçe, as compared to Kratovo's 100,000 and Srebrenica's 477,000. The Catholic miners are known to have arrived by that time, as the Catholic Church of Saint Mary had been built around 1487, {{but it was not until}} the years after the 1520s that Chiprovtsi attracted more colonists and turned into one of the Ottoman Empire's leading mining centres. By 1528, Chiprovtsi had a mint and was manufacturing silver coins. In 1585, the miners were forced to work night and day and had to pay increased taxes, leading to protests and the danger that they may migrate. By the time, Chiprovtsi was already providing a revenue of 1,400,000 akçe, making it one of the empire's prime mining and metalworking regions.|$|E
5|$|Following the Republic of the Congo's {{independence}} from Belgium in 1960, the country fell into disorder as the army mutinied. Shortly thereafter South Kasai and the State of Katanga declared {{independence from}} the Congolese government. The latter contained {{the vast majority of}} the Congo's valuable mineral resources and attracted significant <b>mining</b> <b>activity</b> under Belgian rule. Many Katangese thought that they were entitled to the revenue generated through the lucrative industry, and feared that under the new central government it would be distributed among the Congo's poorer provinces. Resulting nativist politics with support from the Belgian government and private interests such as the Union Minière du Haut Katanga (UMHK) precipitated the Katangese secession.|$|E

5|$|M-35 is an {{original}} state trunkline that was first designated by July 1, 1919, {{originally intended to}} run from Menominee {{in the south to}} near Big Bay in the north, before turning toward L'Anse to end at Ontonagon. However, the section through the Huron Mountains in northern Marquette and Baraga counties was never built. Automobile pioneer Henry Ford helped halt this construction to gain favor with and membership in the exclusive Huron Mountain Club. Some discontinuous sections were later ceded to local control. The northern segment of the route between Ontonagon and Baraga was retained as a discontinuous segment of the highway; this northern segment was redesignated as another state trunkline. The northern end was rerouted out of the City of Negaunee into Negaunee Township to avoid <b>mining</b> <b>activity</b> near Palmer.|$|E
5|$|Most of Thistle's {{residents}} were railroad employees sent {{to live in}} the town, but there were some who had settled before the railroads arrived. The first Europeans were part of the Mormon migration to Utah, and the first of these was the Pace family, who migrated from Nauvoo, Illinois, reaching Thistle in 1848. Fifth-generation descendants of the Pace settlers continued to operate a family-owned cattle ranch until the town was evacuated. Other settlers included Mormons who originally settled elsewhere in Utah but subsequently arrived to homestead fertile ground on Billies Mountain, on the north wall of the canyon. Among them was the mountain's presumed namesake, William Johnson. Homesteading was practiced in Thistle until the early 1900s. Until the arrival of the railroads, the town's economy was based mainly on farming and ranching, although there was also some <b>mining</b> <b>activity</b> in the region, including a vein of asphaltum that was mined between 1892 and 1914.|$|E
5|$|The Iron Mountain Mine, {{the most}} {{productive}} copper mine in California {{in at least one}} point along its history, operated along the banks of two Spring Creek tributaries, upstream from the current dam site, from 1879 to the 1960s. The mine extracted iron ore, silver, gold, copper sulfide ore, and pyrite from a rock formation dating to approximately 780,000 years ago. The potential of a mine at the site was discovered in 1860, when two men, surveyor William Magee and settler Charles Camden, discovered an extensive iron ore deposit along one of the tributaries of Spring Creek. In 1879, silver was also discovered at the site, and the mine was begun. The ownership was transferred to Mountain Mines Ltd., a London company, in 1894. At {{the very end of the}} 19th century, Iron Mountain Mine took blames for several fish kills in the Sacramento River. Nevertheless, <b>mining</b> <b>activity</b> continued, and by 1928, 600 tons of ore were being extracted from the site per day.|$|E
