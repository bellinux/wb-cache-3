2500|$|There are six notable {{meteorite}} or comet impact craters in Saskatchewan. [...] Carswell, Deep Bay, and Gow Lake {{have affected}} the Canadian Shield area of the north. In the southern Phanerozoic crater are the Viewfield, Elbow, and Maple Creek structures. [...] The Carswell structure is the largest astrobleme at [...] in diameter. It is estimated that the impact to the Athabasca basin occurred about 478 million years ago during the Ordovician period. The thrust of the impact affected the Athabasca Rock groups. [...] The William River Subgroup and the Douglas and Carswell formations show inversions, thrusting and disruptions. [...] The impact that occurred about 210 million years ago has created the Gow Lake Structure. [...] This lake is [...] in diameter with Calder island centrally located. [...] La Ronge is [...] south-southwest of the crater location. [...] The other impact crater of the Cambrian shield is the Deep Bay Structure, which created a bay in the southerly part of Reindeer Lake. [...] The crater is about [...] in diameter and about [...] at the deepest point. [...] The circular impact ridge [...] above water level partially encompasses the crater area. [...] There is some central uplift. [...] The crater was formed about 50 to 150 million years ago. [...] Weyburn is west and Stoughton is north of the Viewfield Impact Structure, a small impact crater [...] in diameter. The impact occurred in the early Jurassic period about 190 million years ago. [...] Oil and gas reserves {{have been found in}} the area of the rim breccia [...] Another impact crater in the Phanerezoic crater is the Maple Creek Structure. [...] This impact affected Upper Cretaceous Bearpaw Formation sediments on the north edge of the Cypress Hills, and roughly occurred 75 million years ago. [...] Maple Creek is located north northwest of this [...] diameter crater. [...] The Elbow Impact Structure is [...] in diameter and the impact occurred between 370 and 415 million years ago during the [...] Devonian Period. [...] The crater is located in <b>Maple</b> <b>Bush</b> rural municipality north of Aitkow (Riverhurst) and west of Grainfield (Grainland). [...] The Elbow crater is located south of the elbow of the South Saskatchewan, and south of Diefenbaker lake across the waters from the town of Elbow which is north of the South Saskatchewan River.|$|E

Besides, there's many a worse man in his own line than Devine. There was one fellow up at Jamieson's when the rush was on. He could talk the shoes off a mule--and he was an Englishman. Whatever any man wanted, fruit-land, mineral-land, sawing lumber, and gold outcrop, he'd got. Picked it out on the survey map and sold it him. For 'most a month he rolled the dollars in, and then the circus began. The folks who'd made the deals went up to see their land, and most of them found it belonged to another man. You see, if three of them wanted <b>maple</b> <b>bush,</b> that's {{generally}} good soil and light to clear, and he'd only one piece of it, he sold the same lot to all of them. They went back with clubs, but that man knew when to light out, and he didn't wait for them." ...|$|E

The tapping period ends when the supply of maple sap ceases, as when night-time temperatures begin to be above freezing, or when the tree produces metabolites to facilitate tree bud development (which will give syrup an off flavor)--whichever comes first. After the tapping period, some <b>maple</b> sugar <b>bushes</b> experience a profusion of spring wildflowers which take advantage of unobstructed sunlight before the maple leaves emerge.

Hunter's Maple Products sells a variety of maple products including maple syrup, candy, fudge and butter. The restaurant serves typical breakfast foods to pair with their maple products.|$|R

5000|$|Mistusinne is {{a resort}} village in <b>Maple</b> <b>Bush</b> Rural Municipality No. 224, Saskatchewan, Canada. The {{population}} was 56 at the 2006 Census. The village's name {{is derived from}} the Plains Cree word mistasiniy (meaning [...] "big stone") which refers to a massive stone that resembled a sleeping bison that once rested in the Qu'Appelle Valley before Lake Diefenbaker was built. Douglas Provincial Park extends from the community to the Qu'Appelle River Dam and is 8 km south of the village of Elbow on highway 19. The community serves as a summer retreat that contains many cabins and a golf course, with a view of Lake Diefenbaker. Part of the golf course along the shore had to be rebuilt when waters of Lake Diefenbaker rose in 1998 and collapsed the shoreline.|$|E

40|$|Black-throated Blue Warbler. I {{saw this}} bird in our yard (James Ranch, Fort Robinson State Park, Sioux co.) between October 10 and 13, 1993.

I used the Golden Field Guide to Birds of North America, and the Audubon Society Field Guide to North American Birds to {{identify}} it. It {{did not seem to}} be disturbed by my presence (5 to 10 feet away), but moved about very rapidly. It was with a bird tentatively identified as an immature Yellow-rumped Warbler, and was also sometimes seen at the same time as an immature Yellow-bellied Sapsucker. On October 8, we had 142 ÃÜ 2 snow and temperatures down to the lower 202 ÃÜ 7 s (F). The temperature was close to 50 ¬∞ on Oct. 9 and 10, but the ground was still mostly snow-covered.

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the extent to}} which sugar bush management in Eastern Ontario might contribute to biodiversity maintenance and conservation and therefore be promoted as a form of rural sustainable development. Ontario government policy seeks to actively promote actions that strengthen the province‚Äôs rural communities and protect biodiversity. Therefore sustainable development is an important concept to encourage in rural areas. The production of maple syrup on sugar bushes has already been demonstrated to be economically, socially, and in some aspects ecologically sustainable. This study seeks to determine how the operation of sugar bushes might also contribute to ecological sustainability through the maintenance and conservation of forest biodiversity. I identified three documents published by the Eastern Ontario Model Forest (EOMF) : a set of management principles for conserving biodiversity on private woodlots, a list of biodiversity indicators, and a manual for monitoring them. I monitored three of the biodiversity indicators (spring ephemerals, birds, and frogs) on three of the larger sugar bushes in the Eastern Ontario and established that the EOMF biodiversity monitoring practices and guidelines were suitable for working sugar bushes. Using the management principles for biodiversity conservation developed by the EOMF, I interviewed 22 sugar bush operators in Eastern Ontario. With these interviews I addressed two objectives: 1. 	To generate empirical information regarding the management practices of <b>maple</b> sugar <b>bush</b> operators in Eastern Ontario and to compare these with established management principles for forest biodiversity conservation in the region 2. 	To generate suggestions for woodlot operators and government policymakers alike about future opportunities for research and management decision-making. The results of the study show that although most operators do not have a formal management plan for their sugar bush, many of their management practices are consistent with prescribed biodiversity conservation principles. Sugar bush operators are receptive to conserving biodiversity on their properties. The findings suggest that through sound management and planning, small-scale commercial sugar bush operations generally can be made environmentally sustainable, and become important components in broader rural development strategies. This study provides new insights into how small-scale sugar bush management, when practiced well, is consistent with conservation principles and with sustainable development principles more generally. It shows how sugar bush operators in Eastern Ontario can help the province reach its goals of biodiversity conservation and rural development set out in Ontario‚Äôs Biodiversity Strategy (2005) and Ontario‚Äôs Rural Plan (2004) ...|$|R
