5|$|The reed is {{attached}} to the <b>mouthpiece</b> by the ligature, and the top half-inch or so of this assembly is held in the player's mouth. In the past clarinetists used to wrap a string around the <b>mouthpiece</b> and reed instead of using a ligature. The formation of the mouth around the <b>mouthpiece</b> and reed is called the embouchure.|$|E
5|$|The reed {{is on the}} {{underside}} of the <b>mouthpiece,</b> pressing against the player's lower lip, while the top teeth normally contact the top of the <b>mouthpiece</b> (some players roll the upper lip under the top teeth to form what is called a 'double-lip' embouchure). Adjustments in the strength and shape of the embouchure change the tone and intonation (tuning). It is not uncommon for clarinetists to employ methods to relieve the pressure on the upper teeth and inner lower lip by attaching pads to the top of the <b>mouthpiece</b> or putting (temporary) padding on the front lower teeth, commonly from folded paper.|$|E
5|$|The {{rarefaction}} {{is reflected}} off the sloping end {{wall of the}} clarinet <b>mouthpiece.</b> The opening between the reed and the <b>mouthpiece</b> makes very little difference to {{the reflection of the}} rarefaction wave. This is because the opening is very small compared {{to the size of the}} tube, so almost the entire wave is reflected back down the tube even if the reed is completely open at the time the wave hits (image 3).|$|E
50|$|<b>Mouthpieces</b> vary to {{suit the}} tone of the instrument. Lower {{instruments}} also have larger <b>mouthpieces,</b> to maximize resonance (see pitch of brass instruments). Also, <b>mouthpieces</b> are selected {{to suit the}} embouchure of the player, to produce a certain timbre, or to optimize the instrument for certain playing styles. For example, trumpet and trombone <b>mouthpieces</b> are usually semi-spherical whereas French horn <b>mouthpieces</b> are conical.|$|R
50|$|The company {{continues}} to build Schilke designed instruments and <b>mouthpieces</b> for {{the professional and}} semi-professional market. Schilke <b>mouthpieces</b> are used by players of brass instruments of every age and ability and are the basis for Yamaha <b>mouthpieces,</b> sharing a numbering scheme for their dimensions and characteristics in common.|$|R
50|$|Early EPG devices used {{direct current}} {{electricity}} {{to power the}} sensors, which were activated by moisture sensors on <b>mouthpieces.</b> <b>Mouthpieces</b> (electropalates) originally closely resembled modern dental impression plates. <b>Mouthpieces</b> became more customized over time, which allowed for more accurate research. Fig. 1 shows a typical electropalate from the Reading system.|$|R

5|$|The A and B {{clarinets}} {{have nearly}} the same bore and use the same <b>mouthpiece.</b> Orchestral clarinetists using the A and B instruments in a concert could use the same <b>mouthpiece</b> (and often the same barrel) (see 'usage' below). The A and B have nearly identical tonal quality, although the A typically has a slightly warmer sound. The tone of the E clarinet is brighter and can be heard even through loud orchestral or concert band textures. The bass clarinet has a characteristically deep, mellow sound, while the alto clarinet is similar in tone to the bass (though not as dark).|$|E
5|$|The {{clarinet}} is a musical-instrument family {{belonging to}} the group known as the woodwind instruments. It has a single-reed <b>mouthpiece,</b> a straight cylindrical tube with an almost cylindrical bore, and a flared bell. A person who plays a clarinet is called a clarinetist (sometimes spelled clarinettist).|$|E
50|$|Vandoren {{clarinet}} and saxophone <b>mouthpieces</b> {{are made}} of vulcanised rubber called ebonite. Their V16 tenor saxophone <b>mouthpieces</b> are also available in a metal variant.|$|R
50|$|Saxophone <b>mouthpieces</b> are {{available}} in hundreds of styles from dozens of manufacturers around the world. <b>Mouthpieces</b> are often named after famous performers who contribute to their designs.|$|R
5000|$|However, <b>mouthpieces</b> {{that are}} {{extremely}} thin, such as wire <b>mouthpieces</b> or {{those that are}} only 1/8-1/4" [...] in thickness, are never mild. These can be damaging to a horse's mouth.|$|R
5|$|The <b>mouthpiece</b> {{and reed}} are {{surrounded}} by the player's lips, which put light, even pressure on the reed and form an airtight seal. Air is blown past the reed and down the instrument. In {{the same way a}} flag flaps in the breeze, the air rushing past the reed causes it to vibrate. As air pressure from the mouth increases, the amount the reed vibrates increases until the reed hits the <b>mouthpiece.</b> At this point the reed stays pressed against the <b>mouthpiece</b> until either the springiness of the reed forces it to open or a returning pressure wave 'bumps' into the reed and opens it. Each time the reed opens, a puff of air goes through the gap, after which the reed swings shut again. When played loudly, the reed can spend up to 50% of the time shut. The 'puff of air' or compression wave (around 3% greater pressure than the surrounding air) travels down the cylindrical tube and escapes {{at the point where the}} tube opens out. This is either at the closest open hole or at the end of the tube (see diagram: image 1).|$|E
5|$|Compressor diving is a {{rudimentary}} method of surface-supplied diving {{used in some}} tropical regions such as the Philippines and the Caribbean. The divers swim with a half mask and fins and are supplied with air from an industrial low-pressure air compressor on the boat through plastic tubes. There is no reduction valve; the diver holds the hose end in his mouth with no demand valve or <b>mouthpiece</b> and allows excess air to spill out between the lips.|$|E
5|$|So {{frustrated}} {{were the}} Social Crediters with the newspapers' hostility that in 1934 they founded their own, the Alberta Social Credit Chronicle, to spread their views. The Chronicle, {{in addition to}} acting as Aberhart's <b>mouthpiece,</b> carried guest editorials by such figures as British fascist leader Oswald Mosley and anti-semitic priest Charles Coughlin.|$|E
50|$|Contrabass sarrusophones take {{rather large}} reeds; they {{are larger than}} contrabassoon reeds. This leads to most people making their own reeds (as is the {{practice}} of most oboe and bassoon players). Contrabass sarrusophone reeds are still manufactured by Vandoren. Sarrusophones are traditionally played with a double reed, but single reed <b>mouthpieces</b> have also been used. These <b>mouthpieces</b> are similar in size to soprano or alto saxophone <b>mouthpieces.</b>|$|R

5|$|Electronic cigarette: Hon Lik, a Chinese pharmacist, is {{credited}} with {{the invention of the}} modern electronic cigarette. In 2003, he {{came up with the idea}} of using a piezoelectric ultrasound-emitting element to vaporise a pressurized jet of liquid containing nicotine diluted in a propylene glycol solution.This design produces a smoke-like vapour that can be inhaled and provides a vehicle for nicotine delivery into the bloodstream via the lungs. He also proposed using propylene glycol to dilute nicotine and placing it in a disposable plastic cartridge which serves as a liquid reservoir and <b>mouthpiece.</b>|$|E
5|$|In a {{radio address}} on May 11, Alley {{announced}} {{that due to}} the nullification, the military would heve {{to stay in power}} beyond June 17. He noted that his administration would require extra time to find a successor who was backed by everyone. Alley suggested that the military should retreat back to the barracks at Camp Ghezo and leave Dahomeyan politics to the career politicians. The view was unpopular, and he was outvoted by his military comrades. Alley eventually became little more than Kouandété's <b>mouthpiece.</b>|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to this primary compression wave, other waves, known as harmonics, are created. Harmonics are caused by factors including the imperfect wobbling and shaking of the reed, the reed sealing the <b>mouthpiece</b> opening {{for part of the}} wave cycle (which creates a flattened section of the sound wave), and imperfections (bumps and holes) in the bore. A wide variety of compression waves are created, but only some (primarily the odd harmonics) are reinforced. These extra waves are what gives the clarinet its characteristic tone.|$|E
5000|$|General service whistles, mostly ones {{stamped with}} [...] " [...] Police or Fire whistle [...] " [...] name variations. These {{were made with}} cast top <b>mouthpieces</b> at the earlier ones and later with rolled <b>mouthpieces.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>Mouthpieces</b> have {{traditionally}} been formed of solid brass. Due to brass often containing lead and being toxic upon contact, brass <b>mouthpieces</b> are usually plated with either gold or silver to protect the player from potential brass poisoning.|$|R
5000|$|Hauser {{developed}} new <b>mouthpieces</b> for saxophones. During {{his time}} spent studying in the USA, the trained toolmaker embarked {{on research and}} literature studies {{in order to develop}} his own <b>mouthpieces.</b> Together with his brother he has been producing individual pieces aimed at the requirements of saxophonists since 2004. Since 2007, in addition to saxophonists in Europe, musicians such as Kenny Garrett and Chico Freeman have also been playing with [...] "hausertone" [...] <b>mouthpieces.</b>|$|R
5|$|In addition, Kogălniceanu began {{printing}} {{the magazine}} Steaua Dunării in Iași: a unionist <b>mouthpiece,</b> it enlisted support from Alecsandri and his România Literară. Kogălniceanu encouraged Nicolae Ionescu {{to issue the}} magazine L'Étoile de Danube in Brussels, as a French-language version of Steaua Dunării which would also serve to popularize Partida Naționalăs views. By that time, he was in correspondence with Jean Henri Abdolonyme Ubicini, a French essayist and traveler who had played a minor part in the Wallachian uprising, and who supported the Romanian cause in his native country.|$|E
5|$|Kouandété {{launched}} another coup against Soglo on December 17, but he {{was forced}} to hand power to Alley two days later. His administration oversaw {{the creation of a new}} constitution and a presidential election, Dahomey's first since 1964. The results were annulled because of a boycott that prevented almost three-quarters of the country from voting. Alley lost popularity with the suggestion that the military should retreat back to the barracks, and was eventually reduced to a <b>mouthpiece</b> for Kouandété. On July 17, 1968, Alley was forced to hand power to Emile Zinsou, a veteran politician.|$|E
5|$|On June 23, 2001, Judah {{defeated}} Allan Vester by third-round knockout in {{his fifth}} successful {{defense of the}} IBF title. In round two, Judah put Vester down to the canvas twice. In the third round, Judah knocked out Vester with a left hand that connected on Vester's temple. Vester went {{down on his knees}} and nearly lost his <b>mouthpiece.</b> The referee stopped the fight right before the closing bell. The fight would set up a unification match between Judah and WBC and WBA Light Welterweight Champion Kostya Tszyu, who defeated Oktay Urkal on the undercard.|$|E
50|$|Between 1940 and 1960, {{it became}} common for {{classical}} saxophonists to use narrow-chamber <b>mouthpieces,</b> {{based on those}} designed for jazz use. These <b>mouthpieces</b> give the instrument a brighter and edgier sound (more high partials) than the traditional shape as designed by Sax.|$|R

50|$|All twisted <b>mouthpieces</b> are {{considered}} {{more severe than}} smooth <b>mouthpieces.</b> In general, they are not appropriate for novice riders or those with harsh or unskilled hands. Neither these nor any bits {{should be used to}} the point where they cause bleeding of the horse's mouth.|$|R
5|$|The modern {{clarinet}} {{developed from}} a Baroque instrument called the chalumeau. This instrument {{was similar to}} a recorder, but with a single-reed <b>mouthpiece</b> and a cylindrical bore. Lacking a register key, it was played mainly in its fundamental register, with a limited range of about {{one and a half}} octaves. It had eight finger holes, like a recorder, and two keys for its two highest notes. At this time, contrary to modern practice, the reed was placed in contact with the upper lip.|$|E
5|$|Thơ {{was part}} of an Interministerial Committee, a group of {{government}} officials that negotiated a Joint Communique with the Buddhists to end the civil disobedience. An agreement was signed, but never implemented. Thơ was later criticised by the Nhus through their English language <b>mouthpiece,</b> the Times of Vietnam, for the deal. Despite the general amnesty granted to arrested Buddhist activists, on 13 August, Thơ gave a press conference during which he vowed to prosecute the Buddhist victims of the Huế Vesak shootings, and revoking the amnesty and vowing to jail Buddhist demonstrators.|$|E
5|$|When the rarefication wave {{reaches the}} other (open) {{end of the}} tube, air rushes in to fill the slight vacuum. A {{little more than a}} 'neutral' amount of air enters the tube and causes a {{compression}} wave to travel back up the tube (image 4). Once the compression wave reaches the <b>mouthpiece</b> end of the 'tube', it is reflected again back down the pipe. However at this time, either because the compression wave 'bumped' the reed or because of the natural vibration cycle of the reed, the gap opens and another 'puff' of air is sent down the pipe.|$|E
5000|$|Always {{looking for}} a darker, more {{powerful}} sound, Arthur Lehman also developed the deep, large-bore parabolic-cup <b>mouthpieces</b> generally known today as the [...] "Lehman Special," [...] a radical change from the shallower cup-shaped <b>mouthpieces</b> of earlier Euphonium soloists. With his performances on the Boosey and Hawkes Euphoniums and his [...] "Lehman Special" [...] <b>mouthpieces,</b> Lehman is widely credited for transforming the typical American Euphonium sound from the lighter continental sound of the John Philip Sousa days to the rich, dark and resonant sound common today.|$|R
50|$|Makers {{commonly}} construct <b>mouthpieces</b> {{from one}} of two types of material, with different costs, properties, and features.
