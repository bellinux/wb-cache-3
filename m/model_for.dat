40|$|In {{the last}} decades several {{preclinical}} <b>models</b> <b>for</b> sepsis {{have been used to}} study the pathophysiologic processes during sepsis. Although these studies revealed promising immunomodulating agents for the treatment of sepsis, clinical trials evaluating the efficacy of these new agents in septic patients were disappointing. It should be realized that most of the preclinical <b>models</b> <b>for</b> sepsis lack a localized infectious source from which the infection disseminates. Studies on the effects of several immunomodulating strategies have demonstrated strikingly opposite results when using <b>models</b> <b>for</b> sepsis with a more natural route of infection, such as pneumonia, and when using <b>models</b> <b>for</b> sepsis lacking an infectious focus. In this review we will compare <b>models</b> <b>for</b> sepsis and <b>models</b> <b>for</b> pneumonia. We advise to use a combination of <b>models,</b> including <b>models</b> <b>for</b> sepsis and <b>models</b> <b>for</b> localized infections, to test new immunomodulating strategies before starting any clinical trial evaluating a new immunomodulating therap...|$|R
