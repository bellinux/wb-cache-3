She explained that stance, saying [...] "I’ve been celibate for 14 years and I’m a regular church-goer." [...] She also claimed she had never masturbated. However, in 2012 Suleman filed for bankruptcy in federal court, claiming a $1 million debt. She thus reversed her earlier position, saying [...] "If it's a job, and it's a well-paying job, and it's going {{to allow me to}} get out of here and move in a very safe, huge home that they deserve, I'm going to do it." [...] She was paid a five-figure amount and <b>monthly</b> <b>royalties.</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} is to examine whether the extent of tax compliance by oil producing companies in Nigeria is determined by the knowledge, remuneration and incentives of government tax officials. This study sets out to investigate the extent of compliance of oil and gas (exploration and production) companies with the Petroleum Profits Tax Act and to confirm whether lack of sufficient knowledge of the PPT law and poor remuneration and incentives of government tax officials affect tax administration in the upstream sector of the petroleum industry in Nigeria. An extensive literature review was conducted on the historical and legislative background and the incentives available to petroleum companies in Nigeria. The review also covered theories of taxation, tax administration and compliance, tax reforms, tax avoidance and evasion. The literature review revealed gaps which this study attempts to fill. This research has concepts that require both qualitative and quantitative approaches in its design, data collection and data analyses. Consequently, a combination of quantitative and qualitative methods was adopted for this study. Face to face interviews were held with experienced regulatory, tax, petroleum companies’ officials and tax and audit practitioners. The researcher uses literature to develop hypotheses which are tested using survey results and backed up by personal interviews. This helps in obtaining results about the behaviour of taxpayers and tax officials in the upstream sector of the petroleum industry in Nigeria. By using a survey, the researcher is able to assess the perceptions of a cross-section of stakeholders in the Nigerian oil industry about the level of compliance with the PPT law. The personal interviews with oil experts provide the benefit of their in-depth knowledge of the oil industry in Nigeria and furnish an understanding of their social world. This research seems to support the perception that the oil producing companies may not be complying fully with the provisions of the Petroleum Profits Tax Act and the Petroleum Act in relation to the payments of royalty and PPT. Interview results suggest that {{there is a lack of}} an adequate database of all company taxes paid in Nigeria, minimisation of <b>monthly</b> <b>Royalties</b> and PPT instalments, a dearth of experts on fiscal issues, overwhelming influence of the oil producing companies, poor attitude and inadequate knowledge of the operations of the petroleum industry amongst government tax officials...|$|E

(Alan notes {{at the beginning of}} Season 8 that just one of Charlie's <b>monthly</b> <b>royalty</b> checks for his children's songs is more than he makes in a year.) Although he and his brother do have a sometimes tense relationship, they remain loyal to one another with Charlie able to cheer Alan up when he needs it, or Alan having to control Charlie's free spending ways. He has little confidence in Jake, mostly because of his lazy, unmotivated attitude, but he does love his son.|$|R

5000|$|With {{a strong}} initial focus on children's books, the firm {{published}} {{editions of the}} fairy tales of Hans Christian Andersen and The Brothers Grimm in 1905; but their mainstay in their early years remained L. Frank Baum. Reilly & Britton issued eleven titles by Baum in 1906: the fantasy novel John Dough and the Cherub, under Baum's name; Daughters of Destiny, an adult romance by [...] "Schuyler Staunton;" [...] the juvenile novel Annabel, by [...] "Suzanne Metcalf;" [...] a book for boys, Sam Steele's Adventures on Land and Sea, by [...] "Capt. Hugh Fitzgerald," [...] and one for girls, Aunt Jane's Nieces, by [...] "Edith Van Dyne" [...] - [...] the last one was so successful that it inspired a ten-volume series of the same name. There was also a set of six booklets for small children, collectively known as The Twinkle Tales, by [...] "Laura Bancroft," [...] with illustrations by Maginel Wright Enright. The six were a popular success, selling a total of 40,000 copies, and were later re-printed in one volume, as Twinkle and Chubbins: Their Astonishing Adventures in Nature-Fairyland (1911). The firm paid Baum a 10% royalty {{on each of the}} first five books, and two-and-a-half cents per copy on the booklets. (Mindful of his past financial difficulties, Baum also negotiated <b>monthly</b> <b>royalty</b> payments, instead of the more usual yearly payment.) If the six booklets are counted as a single full-length volume, the firm issued six books by Baum in 1906 alone.|$|R

Coal Mining became an important industry for the post-Antebellum, now Gilded Age city.

After a series of corporate transactions brought the Cairo and Vincennes Railroad {{into the hands of}} the Cleveland, Cincinnati, Chicago & St. Louis Railway around 1890, with Illinois state representative Charles P Skaggs as mayor, Harrisburg evolved into one of the leading coal-mining centers of the Midwest. Harrisburg was a strategic spot on the railroad route with a large hump yard, making it the focal point for the most productive coal field operations. Some of the most profitable coal companies that operated around Harrisburg were Big Creek Coal, Harrisburg Coal and O'Gara Coal. Each one with their own sizable rail yards.

5000|$|On June 14, 2004, Bobby Maxwell, {{a senior}} {{government}} auditor for the U.S. Department of the Interior's Minerals Management Service ("MMS"), {{filed suit in}} federal court {{on behalf of the}} U.S. Government against Kerr-McGee, under the whistle-blowing provisions of the False Claims Act ("FCA"). In the suit, Mr. Maxwell alleged that, based on the information uncovered during his audit, [...] "Kerr-McGee knowingly made false and/or fraudulent statements on the <b>monthly</b> <b>royalty</b> reports submitted to the MMS and 'understated and underpaid' its federal royalties." [...] In January 2007, after a full trial on the issues, Kerr-McGee was found by a jury to have failed to report earnings, and thus, under-paying royalties due to the U.S. government. The jury award damages in the amount of US$7.6 million. Despite the jury's verdict, however, before entering judgment, the court reconsidered an earlier Motion for Summary Judgement filed by Kerr-McGee and reversed its prior holding, this time determining that the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to hear the case at all. The case was appealed by Mr. Maxwell, and on September 10, 2008, the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the ruling of the lower court, remanding it back for further proceedings. On September 16, 2010, U.S. District Court Judge Marcia S. Krieger of Colorado ordered Kerr-McGee to pay treble damages, or almost $23 million. As a whistle-blower under the FCA, Mr. Maxwell would be entitled to twenty-five percent of the amount recovered for the government, or approximately $5.7 million. Per Mr. Maxwell, however, most of the money awarded would go to pay the legal fees associated with his almost-10-year fight to force Kerr-McGee to change its deceptive practices and pay what it owed to the public.|$|R

Large numbers of immigrants from England, Wales, and eastern Europe, looking for work, detrained at the Harrisburg Train Depot; crowding around quickly expanding mining villages directly outside of the city, such as Muddy, Wasson, Harco and Ledford. The city's population quickly expanded from 5,000 to 10,000 in a few years. By 1906, the Big four/CCC&STL Railroad became the New York Central, and Saline County was producing more than 500,000 tons of coal annually with more than 5000 miners at work. In 1915 the Ringling Brothers Circus made an appearance in Harrisburg. In 1913, the Southern Illinois Railway and Power Company operated an interurban trolley line, that ran from downtown Eldorado, into Muddy, Wasson, Beulah Heights, through downtown Harrisburg, Dorrisville, Ledford and into downtown Carrier Mills, all of which had larger residential areas than present. In 1917 there were plans to extend the line westward to Marion and Carbondale to connect to the Coal Belt Co. line, and then run it towards St. Louis. The trolley wire through the county was 16 ft high. It was an off branch of the Cairo and Vincennes Railroad. The corporation erected the first electrical generating plant in Muddy, Illinois.|$|R
