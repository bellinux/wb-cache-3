Used from the antiquity as a measuring system that ensured good proportions for the objects or buildings, the module is used in present industry {{as a tool for}} improving the product maintenance, repair, upgrading, and/or recycling. <b>Modular</b> <b>constructions</b> can be assembled and disassembled easily, facilitating the postuse actions like subassemblies reuse, or materials recovering for the recycling process. An important aspect of this paper is that designers should create the modular solution even from the conceptual design stage and build a structure of functions based on well motivated arguments and which can easily be brake out according to technological possibilities, product functioning and assembly solutions...|$|R

The combined electrical generation capability of each submarine is 4.2 megawatts. The Hedemora diesels were chosen because of <b>modular</b> <b>construction,</b> which made servicing easier; they could be installed three across in the available space, while other contenders required at least two banks of two; and they had turbochargers driven by the exhaust gas. Fifteen fuel tanks are located throughout the submarine: they must be used in specific sequences to preserve the submarine's buoyancy and trim.|$|E

25|$|The {{contract}} {{to build the}} stadium was issued the Nussli Group of Switzerland, which specializes {{in the construction of}} temporary stadiums. They used their NT grandstand system, which allowed for <b>modular</b> <b>construction</b> of stands. Construction implemented 2,500 tonnes of material. Nussli's senior project manager, Florian Weber, stated that {{the most difficult part of}} the construction was the occupancy permit, caused by the short construction schedule. Construction took 111 days, and was completed in late June 2010. Several commentators stated that use of temporary stadiums on a permanent basis could be used for other MLS and CFL stadia. For instance, the price of building an 18,500 seat permanent soccer-specific stadium was averaging $200 million.|$|E

40|$|A {{category}} of one-step semantics is introduced to unify different ap-proaches to coalgebraic logic parametric in a contravariant functor that assigns {{to the state}} space its collection of predicates with propositional connectives. <b>Modular</b> <b>constructions</b> of coalgebraic logic are identified as colimits, limits, and tensor products, extending known results for predicate liftings. Generalised predicate liftings as modalities are introduced. Under common assumptions, the logic of all predicate liftings together with a complete axiomatisation exists for any type of coalgebras, and it is one-step expressive for finitary functors. Colimits and compositions of one-step expressive coalgebraic logics are shown to remain one-step expressive. ...|$|R
25|$|The ship uses <b>modular</b> <b>construction,</b> with 874 blocks joined {{together}} for the hull. By the time the keel was laid, 423 blocks weighing over 8,000 tons had been completed. The construction plan called for the carrier to be launched in 2010, when it would displace some 20,000 tonnes, as a larger displacement could not be accommodated in the building bay. It was planned that after about a year's development in the refit dock, the carrier would be launched when all the major components, including underwater systems, would be in place. Outfitting would then be carried out after launch. As per the Cabinet Committee on Security (CCS), sea trials were initially planned to commence in 2013, with the ship to be commissioned in 2014.|$|E
25|$|The Alpha Jet {{is powered}} by a pair of SNECMA Turbomeca Larzac {{turbofan}} engines. It is a low bypass-ratio, twin-spool engine that uses <b>modular</b> <b>construction</b> methods. The Larzac was a new engine at the time, having only performed its first run a year prior to being selected to power the Alpha Jet. The need for greater thrust to power the aircraft than the original model of the engine could generate led to the development and adoption of the 2,970lb Larzac 04 in February 1972; it was this version of the engine that initially powered the Alpha Jet. Germany was interested in powering the type with the General Electric J85, but France objected to the use of an American engine which would result in US export restrictions upon the overall aircraft and agreed to assume the cost of developing the French-built Larzac. During the 1980s, an upgraded model of the Larzac engine which increased the thrust by 10 per cent was developed.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. We {{propose a}} general {{categorical}} setting for modeling program composition {{in which the}} call-by-value and call-by-name disciplines fit as special cases. Other notions of composition arising in denotational semantics are captured in the same framework: our leading examples are nondeterministic call-by-need programs and nonstrict functions with side effects. Composition of such functions is treated in our framework with {{the same degree of}} abstraction that Moggi’s categorical approach based on monads allows in the treatment of call-by-value programs. By virtue of such abstraction, interesting program equivalences can be validated axiomatically in mathematical models obtained by means of <b>modular</b> <b>constructions.</b> ...|$|R

500|$|Another of Romney's {{initiatives}} was [...] "Operation Breakthrough," [...] {{which was}} intended {{to increase the amount}} of housing available to the poor and which initially had Nixon's support. [...] Based on his automotive industry experience, Romney thought that the cost of housing could be significantly reduced if in-factory <b>modular</b> <b>construction</b> techniques were used. [...] HUD officials believed that introduction of this technique could help bring about desegregation; Romney said, [...] "We've got to put an end to the idea of moving to suburban areas and living only among people of the same economic and social class". [...] This aspect of the program brought about strong opposition at the local suburban level and lost support in the White House as well. [...] Over half of HUD's research funds during this time were spent on Operation Breakthrough, and it was modestly successful in its building goals. [...] It did not revolutionize home construction, and was phased out once Romney left HUD. But it resulted indirectly in more modern and consistent building codes and introduction of technological advances such as the smoke alarm.|$|E
500|$|As the Basketmaker III people {{improved}} their farming techniques during the 8th century, the well-watered {{areas of the}} San Juan Basin became densely populated. Greater crop yields necessitated the construction of above-ground storage facilities, which were the first large-scale construction projects in the region. Fagan identifies this {{as the beginning of}} the first pueblos, [...] "ushering in a period of profound social tension, population movements, and political change." [...] In his opinion, [...] "by 800, there was no going back. The people of Chaco and elsewhere were locked completely into economies based on maize and bean cultivation." [...] Archeologists refer to the period starting [...] as the Pueblo I Period. By the early 10th century the large pit-house settlements had been supplanted by <b>modular</b> <b>construction</b> that later served as the foundation for the Ancestral Puebloan great houses. This marks the beginning of the Bonito Phase. During the 10th century, Chaco's population was swelled by a steady influx of immigrants from the San Juan River, approximately [...] north. Fagan notes, [...] "Within a few centuries, as rainfall became more irregular and life less predictable, the Chacoans embarked on a cultural trajectory that melded ancient traditions with new ideas that were to crystalize into a brilliant and short-lived Southwestern society." ...|$|E
2500|$|<b>Modular</b> <b>construction</b> {{techniques}} were incorporated during construction. Earlier submarines (e.g., Los Angeles-class SSNs) were built by assembling the pressure hull and then installing the equipment via cavities in the pressure hull. This required extensive construction activities within the narrow {{confines of the}} pressure hull which was time-consuming and dangerous. <b>Modular</b> <b>construction</b> was implemented {{in an effort to}} overcome these problems and make the construction process more efficient. <b>Modular</b> <b>construction</b> techniques incorporated during construction include constructing large segments of equipment outside the hull. These segments (dubbed rafts) are then inserted into a hull section (a large segment of the pressure hull). The integrated raft and hull section form a module which, when joined with other modules, forms a Virginia-class submarine. Block I boats were built in 10 modules with each submarine requiring roughly 7 years (84 months) to build.|$|E

40|$|Motivated by the {{proliferation}} and usefulness of Domain Specific Languages {{as well as}} the demand in enriching well established languages by high level capabilities like modularity, pattern matching or strategic rewriting, we have introduced in previous works the Formal Islands framework. The main idea consists in integrating, in existing programs, formally defined parts called Islands, on which proofs and tests can be meaningfully developed. Then, Formal Islands could be safely dissolved into their hosting language to be transparently integrated in the existing user environment. We present this generic framework and we show that language extensions like Mhtml—providing <b>modular</b> <b>constructions</b> for html — or Tom—a Java language extension allowing for pattern matching and rewriting—are indeed Islands and can therefore be used to embed formal software developments into legacy code...|$|R
