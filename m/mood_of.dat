5|$|I {{think when}} you name a record, {{you have to choose}} {{something}} which you feel reflects the record or that collection of songs. You also want to choose something that reflects not just the <b>mood</b> <b>of</b> the record, but the <b>mood</b> <b>of</b> the people who made it... the <b>mood</b> <b>of</b> those people when they recorded it, and there were quite a few things that sort of came up as ideas, but Right Thoughts, Right Words, Right Action seemed to sum it up best. It's probably the most positive record we've made, and the band have been, yeah, the most optimistic we've been since before we had any encounter with the music industry... probably because we've been sort of keeping a low profile for a while and not talking about ourselves too much.|$|E
5|$|The {{building}} itself is based around a striking honeycomb frontage, modelled on close-up images of an insect's eye, and is illuminated {{at night in}} a variety of colours that reflect the <b>mood</b> <b>of</b> whichever show is playing at the time.|$|E
5|$|In {{the final}} {{months of the}} war, Hand {{increasingly}} supported President Woodrow Wilson's post-war foreign policy objectives. He believed the United States should endorse the League of Nations and the Treaty of Versailles, despite their flaws. This position estranged him from Croly and others at The New Republic, who vehemently rejected both. Alienated from his old circle on the magazine and by the reactionary and isolationist <b>mood</b> <b>of</b> the country, Hand found himself politically homeless.|$|E

60|$|I am {{setting down}} here {{as clearly as}} {{possible}} what wasn't by any means clear in Lady Harman's mind. I am giving you side by side phases that never came {{side by side in}} her thoughts but which followed and ousted and obliterated one another. She had <b>moods</b> <b>of</b> triviality. She had <b>moods</b> <b>of</b> magnificence. She had <b>moods</b> <b>of</b> intense secret hostility to her urgent little husband, and <b>moods</b> <b>of</b> genial tolerance for everything there was in her life. She had moods, and don't we all have moods?--of scepticism and cynicism, much profounder than the conventions and limitations of novel-writing permit us to tell here. And for hardly any <b>of</b> these <b>moods</b> had she terms and recognitions....|$|R

5|$|Reitz's {{policies}} were appreciated by the Volksraad, reflecting {{the change in}} the <b>mood</b> <b>of</b> the Afrikaner electorate towards Afrikaner nationalism. Months before the presidential election of 1893 the Volksraad endorsed Reitz's candidature with a vote of forty-three against eighteen. Reitz accepted the endorsement on the condition that he be allowed three months leave to Europe. On 22 November 1893 he was re-elected, again with a landslide majority.|$|E
5|$|The Easter Rising of 1916 {{was carried}} out by the latter group {{together}} with a smaller socialist militia, the Irish Citizen Army. The British response, executing fifteen leaders of the Rising over a period of ten days and imprisoning or interning more than a thousand people, turned the <b>mood</b> <b>of</b> the country in favour of the rebels. Support for Irish republicanism increased further due to the ongoing war in Europe, as well as the Conscription Crisis of 1918.|$|E
5|$|The {{score was}} {{composed}} by Jonathan Morali {{of the band}} Syd Matters. Inspired by modern indie folk music, the soundtrack was intended to inform the <b>mood</b> <b>of</b> the game. The music contains a blend of licensed tracks and composed pieces. Featured artists include José González, Mogwai, Breton, Amanda Palmer, Brian Viglione, Bright Eyes, Message to Bears, Local Natives, Syd Matters, Sparklehorse, Angus & Julia Stone, alt-J, Mud Flow and Foals.|$|E

5|$|At {{the age of}} 21, Sahajanand Swami was {{appointed}} successor to Ramanand Swami {{as the leader of}} the Uddhav Sampraday by Ramanand Swami, prior to his death. The Uddhav Sampraday henceforth came to be known as the Swaminarayan Sampraday. According to sources he proclaimed the worship of one sole deity, Krishna or Narayana. Krishna was considered by him his own ista devata. In contrast with the Vaishnava sect known as the Radha-vallabha Sampradaya, he had a more puritanical approach, rather than the theological views of Krishna that are strongly capricious in character and imagery. While being a worshipper of Krishna, Swaminarayan rejected licentious elements in Krishnology in favor of worship in the <b>mood</b> <b>of</b> majesty, alike to earlier Vaisnava teachers, Ramanuja and Yamunacarya.|$|E
5|$|During the {{build-up}} to the 1978 FIFA World Cup, MacLeod fuelled {{the hopes}} of the nation by stating that Scotland would come home with a medal. As the squad left for the finals in Argentina, they were given an enthusiastic send-off as they were paraded around a packed Hampden Park. Thousands more fans lined the route to Prestwick Airport as the team set off for South America. Scotland's first game was against Peru in Córdoba. Two spectacular goals by Teófilo Cubillas meant that {{the result was a}} 3–1 loss. The second game was a very disappointing 1–1 draw against Iran. The disconsolate <b>mood</b> <b>of</b> the nation was reflected by footage of Ally MacLeod in the dugout with his head in his hands.|$|E
5|$|Extra Texture (Read All About It) is {{the sixth}} studio album by English {{musician}} George Harrison, released in September 1975. It was Harrison's final album under {{his contract with}} Apple Records and EMI, and the last studio album issued by Apple. The release came nine months after his troubled 1974 North American tour with Ravi Shankar and the poorly received Dark Horse album. The melancholic <b>mood</b> <b>of</b> the recording reflects Harrison's depressed state at the criticism generated by these projects.|$|E

5|$|Facts were {{overwhelmed}} with sound, passion substituted for arithmetic, moral indignation pumped {{up to the}} bursting point. But Mr. Diefenbaker provided the liveliest show of the election... and many listeners undoubtedly failed to notice that he was saying even less than the Prime Minister, though saying it more shrilly and with evangelistic fervour... Mr. Diefenbaker has chosen instead to cast himself as the humble man in a <b>mood</b> <b>of</b> protest, the common Canadian outraged by Liberal prosperity, the little guy fighting for his rights.|$|E
5|$|Fanning married Andrea Moreno in February 2007 in Brisbane, Australia. Moreno is from Spain, {{where the}} two met while Fanning was writing and {{recording}} Tea & Sympathy in Europe. This relationship followed a twelve-year union Fanning had had with his previous girlfriend, {{and it was this}} break-up (along with the then-recent death of his older brother) which influenced much of the lyrical content and sombre atmospheric <b>mood</b> <b>of</b> Tea & Sympathy. Through Moreno, Fanning has learned to speak some of the Spanish language. Fanning and Moreno have performed together while Powderfinger was on hiatus and Fanning was touring as a solo artist.|$|E
5|$|Hopes {{that the}} ballet {{would be ready}} in May were dashed and the opening night was {{postponed}} several times. Grisi was absent {{for a few days}} and her return was delayed to protect her health. Lighting, trapdoors, and scene changes needed further rehearsals. Cuts were made in Grisi's role to spare the dancer's health. Instead of returning to her tomb {{at the end of the}} ballet, it was decided that she would be placed on a bed of flowers and sink slowly into the earth. This touch preserved the romantic <b>mood</b> <b>of</b> the Act II finale.|$|E

5|$|In an {{interview}} during her North American debut in 2011, Kurosaki mentioned {{that it had}} been her long-time dream to perform theme songs for anime series, and that anime {{is a big part of}} her life. She related her experiences working at Dear Stage, where originally worked as a waitress and performer. She said that she worked hard to meet customer expectations, and that performing at the venue's stage would prove to be a valuable experience as it would allow her to perform at larger stages with more imagination and inspiration. She mentioned that while writing lyrics for anime series, she wants the tone and <b>mood</b> <b>of</b> her songs to match the anime's setting.|$|E
5|$|It was mid-September before {{news of the}} {{declaration}} of independence spread to the outer islands, and many Indonesians far from the capital Jakarta did not believe it. As the news spread, most Indonesians came to regard themselves as pro-Republican, and a <b>mood</b> <b>of</b> revolution swept across the country. External power had shifted; it would be weeks before Allied Forces entered Indonesia, and the Dutch were too weakened by World War II. The Japanese, on the other hand, were required by the terms of the surrender to both lay down their arms and maintain order; a contradiction that some resolved by handing weapons to Japanese-trained Indonesians.|$|E
5|$|Lombard {{was eager}} to win an Academy Award, and {{selected}} her next project—from several possible scripts—with the expectation that it would bring her the trophy. Vigil in the Night (1940), directed by George Stevens, featured Lombard as a nurse who faces a series of personal difficulties. Although the performance was praised, she did not get her nomination, as the sombre <b>mood</b> <b>of</b> the picture turned audiences away and box-office returns were poor. Despite the realization that she was best suited to comedies, Lombard completed one more drama: They Knew What They Wanted (1940), co-starring Charles Laughton, which was mildly successful.|$|E

5|$|On January 17, 2009, Obama {{hosted a}} whistle stop train tour {{in honor of}} the 200thanniversary of the birth year of Abraham Lincoln. Obama reenacted the final part of Lincoln's 1861train tour from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania to Washington,D.C. to capture the <b>mood</b> <b>of</b> the 1861Springfield to Washington train tour {{traveled}} by Lincoln to his own inauguration. For his train ride to the nation's capital, Obama rode in the Georgia300, a vintage railroad car used by past presidents and the same one he used for touring Pennsylvania during his presidential primary campaign. On the tour, Obama was accompanied by his wife Michelle, their daughters Malia and Sasha, and a host of friends and guests.|$|E
5|$|Originally {{intended}} to be a full-length opera, Twice was composed between 1994 and 1996, undergoing substantial reworking before Turnage found a form with which he was satisfied. It was first performed in 1997 when it was put on both in the concert hall and in the opera house. The critical reception has been generally favourable, with several authors commenting positively about the instrumental writing and emotional impact of the work, though some critics see limitations in the libretto, find the <b>mood</b> <b>of</b> the work too unrelenting or note the great demands that the vocal writing provides for the soloist.|$|E
5|$|Over one {{thousand}} artists and technicians {{were used in}} the making of Fantasia, which features more than 500 animated characters. Segments were color-keyed scene by scene so the colors in a single shot would harmonize between proceeding and following ones. Before a segment's narrative pattern was complete, an overall color scheme was designed to the general <b>mood</b> <b>of</b> the music, and patterned to correspond with the development of the subject matter. The studio's character model department would also sculpt three-dimensional clay models so the animators could view their subject from all angles.|$|E
