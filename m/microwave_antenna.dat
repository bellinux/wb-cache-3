25|$|Meanwhile, the {{microwave}} needed {{to return to}} the future has been destroyed and replacements have not been invented yet. A <b>microwave</b> <b>antenna</b> from the army base would work, but Professor Farnsworth warns that using it could change history. He likewise warns Fry against visiting his grandfather, Enos, who is stationed at the base, as he might kill Enos and erase his own existence. Rather than persuading him to avoid his grandfather, the professor's warning causes Fry to become obsessed with protecting Enos from possible harm and encouraging his copulation with his fiance Mildred. Fry finally resorts to locking Enos in an abandoned house to prevent his coming to harm. The house is located {{in the middle of a}} nuclear weapon testing range, and Enos is shortly killed by one of the tests.|$|E
