All amplifiers have gain, a <b>multiplication</b> <b>factor</b> that relates the magnitude of some property of the output signal to a property of the input signal. The gain may be specified as the ratio of output voltage to input voltage (voltage gain), output power to input power (power gain), {{or some combination of}} current, voltage, and power. In many cases the property of the output that varies is dependent on the same property of the input, making the gain unitless (though often expressed in decibels (dB)).|$|E

40|$|We {{study the}} {{evolution}} of cooperation {{under the assumption that}} the collective benefits of group membership can only be harvested if the fraction of cooperators within the group, i. e. their critical mass, exceeds a threshold value.

For larger <b>multiplication</b> <b>factors,</b> however, the level of cooperation is highest at an intermediate value of the critical mass. The latter is robust to variations of the group size and the interaction network topology. Applying the optimal critical mass threshold, we show that the fraction of cooperators in public goods games is significantly larger than in the traditional linear model, where the produced public good is proportional to the fraction of cooperators within the group.

To enable comparison between different manufacturers, tests are carried out {{in accordance with the}} relevant test code (such as those defined in the ISO 8662 and EN 60745 series). These tests may be carried out in artificial circumstances which do not necessarily correctly predict the vibration emission that would be obtained in the workplace and often underestimate the magnitude of the vibration. In practice, tools are used with a range of inserted tools on different materials, resulting in a range of vibration emission values for a given tool. CEN Technical Report, CEN/TR 15350 provides <b>multiplication</b> <b>factors</b> to enable an estimate of the workplace vibration emission to be obtained from the manufacturersâ data.

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} {{effective}} electrical size and carrier multiplication of breakdown sites in multi-crystalline silicon solar cells. The local series resistance limits the current of each breakdown site and is thereby linearizing the current-voltage characteristic. This fact allows {{the estimation of}} the effective electrical diameters to be as low as 100 [*]nm. Using a laser beam induced current (LBIC) measurement with a high spatial resolution, we find carrier <b>multiplication</b> <b>factors</b> {{on the order of}} 30 (Zener-type breakdown) and 100 (avalanche breakdown) as new lower limits. Hence, we prove that also the so-called Zener-type breakdown is followed by avalanche multiplication. We explain that previous measurements of the carrier multiplication using thermography yield results higher than unity, only if the spatial defect density is high enough, and the illumination intensity is lower than what was used for the LBIC method. The individual series resistances of the breakdown sites limit the current through these breakdown sites. Therefore, the measured <b>multiplication</b> <b>factors</b> depend on the applied voltage {{as well as on the}} injected photocurrent.
