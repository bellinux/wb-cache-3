40|$|Response {{of steel}} tanks under seismic {{action is a}} {{structural}} topic {{of interest in the}} framework of industrial risk assessment because collapse of these structures may trigger other catastrophic phenomena, as vapor cloud explosion (VCE) or pool fires. Damages suffered by storage tanks under seismic actions are generally related to large axial compressive stress that can cause the instability of tank shell near the base (known as Elephant Foot Buckling, EFB) and large displacement of unanchored structures (sliding and uplifting) that can induce collapse of piping connections and loss of containment. This paper deals with the seismic response of anchored and unanchored liquid storage tanks focusing on the EFB. The algorithm to solve the equation of motion for simplified tank's model is proposed and seismic demand and seismic fragility are accordingly evaluated. Comparative analyses including both horizontal seismic input are discussed in order to point out the effects of ground motion and effects of two fundamental parameters on the seismic response: filling level and friction factor.

A major portion of the program involves determining the compatibility of $sup 90 $SrF$sub 2 $ with <b>containment</b> <b>materials</b> at elevated temperatures. The compatibility studies are divided into two phases: an initial series of short-term scouting tests lasting up to 4400 h in which a number of <b>containment</b> <b>materials</b> were evaluated, and a subsequent series of long-term tests in which the three best <b>containment</b> <b>materials</b> identified in the short-term tests will be tested for up to 30, 000 h with WESF-produced $sup 90 $SrF$sub 2 $. The results of the first phase tests are summarized. The short-term tests were carried-out at temperatures of 800, 1000, and 1100 $sup 0 $C for 1500 and 4400 h using both radioactive and nonradioactive strontium fluoride. Nine potential <b>containment</b> <b>materials</b> were evaluated in the tests: two refractory metals (tungsten and TZM); two cobalt base alloys (Haynes Alloy 25 and Haynes Alloy 188); and five nickel base alloys (Hastelloy C- 276, Hastelloy X, Hastelloy N, Inconel 600 and Inconel 625).

40|$|Designers are {{challenged}} to manage customer, technology, and socio-economic uncertainty causing dynamic, unquenchable demands on limited resources. In this context, increased concept flexibility, {{referring to a}} designer s ability to generate concepts, is crucial. Concept flexibility can be significantly increased through the integrated design of product and material concepts. Hence, {{the challenge is to}} leverage knowledge of material structure-property relations that significantly affect system concepts for function-based, systematic design of product and materials concepts in an integrated fashion. However, having selected an integrated product and material system concept, managing complexity in embodiment design-processes is important. Facing a complex network of decisions and evolving analysis models a designer needs the flexibility to systematically generate and evaluate embodiment design-process alternatives. In order to address these challenges and respond to the primary research question of how to increase a designer s concept and design-process flexibility to enhance product creation in the conceptual and early embodiment design phases, the primary hypothesis in this dissertation is embodied as a systematic approach for integrated product, materials and design-process design. The systematic approach consists of two components i) a function-based, systematic approach to the integrated design of product and material concepts from a systems perspective, and ii) a systematic strategy to design-process generation and selection based on a decision-centric perspective and a value-of-information-based Process Performance Indicator. The systematic approach is validated using the validation-square approach that consists of theoretical and empirical validation. Empirical validation of the framework is carried out using various examples including: i) design of a reactive <b>material</b> <b>containment</b> system, and ii) design of an optoelectronic communication system.

40|$|A key {{challenge}} facing designers creating innovative products is concept generation. Conceptual design {{is more effective}} when the design space is broadened by using an integrated design of product and material concepts approach. Conceptual design can also be accelerated by including problem solving and solution triggering tools in its structure. In this approach, structured analogy is used to transfer underlying principles from a solution suitable in one domain (i. e., product or mechanical domain) to an analogous solution in another domain (i. e., material domain). The nature of design analogy does not require as full of {{an exploration of the}} target domain as would otherwise be necessary; affording the possibility of a more rapid development. The addition of problem solving and solution triggering tools to a design method also decreases the design time and/or improves the quality of the final solution. 	This approach is formulated through a combination of the Theory of Inventive Problem Solving (TRIZ) proposed by Altshuller, and the systematic approach of Pahl and Beitz, for products that are jointly considered at the product and material level. These types of problems are ones where customer performance requirements are fulfilled through both the designed product and the designed material. The systematic approach of Pahl and Beitz is used as the base method through which TRIZ is used as a means of transferring abstract information about the design problem between the domains with the aim of accelerating conceptual design. This also allows for multi-domain design tools such as Su-Field-Model integration with design repositories for the transfer of information at different levels of abstraction; expanding the design space and effectively directing the designer. The explanation of this approach is presented through a simple example of a spring design improvement and validated through concept generation of a reactive <b>material</b> <b>containment</b> system.

40|$|The {{telescoping}} weir is {{an innovative}} structure {{that has the}} ability to closely control the environmental water quality during decantation and drainage of water from the dredged material surface of Confined Dredged <b>Material</b> <b>Containment</b> Facilities (CDF) by mechanically lowering and/or raising the weir crest to the desired elevation. The telescoping weir is designed to meet a range of water and dredged material storage levels common to most CDF sites. The express design life also as a capacity per area i. e. 2. 5 MCY per 100 AC of a 15 -ft high telescoping weir is ten to fifteen years depending on the filling rate, consolidation and surface area. The telescoping weir consists of a set of vertically nested cylinders set on end with one cylinder within the other. The telescoping weir is set within and attached to the base of a reaction frame that provides support for it and the machinery that controls the telescoping movements of the weir. The telescoping weir is raised and lowered by a set of mechanical screw jacks that operate simultaneously either manually or by a solar/battery-powered motor. The bottom cylinder is fixed to a foundation that is anchored {{to the bottom of the}} CDF and connected to a discharge pipe. The upper cylinders are extended in a telescoping manner to position the rim of the top cylinder to any desired elevation below or above the water surface. As the cylinders are lowered below the water surface, the decant water flows over the weir crest into the interior sections and exits through the discharge pipe in the lower section and returns to the receiving body of water. Improved safety and ease of operation of the telescoping weir and its ability to extend storage capacity of CDF’s by 10 to 20 percent are very attractive aspects. Operational success and increased storage capacity at Craney Island has shown the telescoping weir to be technically, economically and operationally feasibility.
