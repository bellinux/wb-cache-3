40|$|Paper {{presents}} {{methodology for}} analyzing behaviour of time-dependent (viscoelastic) materials {{when exposed to}} periodical (cyclic) loading. Within each loading cycle time-dependent material undergoes {{a combination of the}} creep and retardation process. At certain conditions the retardation process between two loading cycles cannot be fully completed to a strain free state. Consequently, strain starts to accumulate, which leads to hardening of the material and ultimately to the failure of polymeric product. Critical frequency of the applied periodical loading depends on the <b>material</b> <b>retardation</b> time (location of mechanical spectrum), while the magnitude of accumulated strain on the strength of corresponding discrete spectrum lines. The shape of mechanical spectrum defines the intensity and the magnitude of accumulated strain. Thus, the mechanical spectrum of time-dependent material is the most important function for predicting durability of dynamically loaded polymeric products. In continuation we present mathematical methodology for predicting durability of periodically loaded polymeric components of drive belt. Methodology includes numerical calculations of accumulated strain {{as a function of the}} number of loading cycles and function of loading angular velocity. Based on these calculations we can determine the critical angular velocity area of periodical loading where the strain accumulation is the most intensive...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} constitutive {{modeling of}} dynamically loaded elastomeric {{products such as}} power transmission belts. During the normal operation of the belts certain segments of the belt structure are loaded with a tooth-like periodic (cyclic) loading. When the time-dependent properties of the elastomeric material "match" the time-scale of the dynamic loading a strain accumulation process occurs. The critical angular velocity {{is proportional to the}} ratio of the belt length to the common diameters of the pulleys. The magnitude of the strain accumulated in each loading cycle decreases with an increase in belt length. For a given belt geometry the critical angular velocity increases with the number of loading cycles. At the same time the magnitude of the accumulated strain decreases non-linearly as the number of loading cycles increases. However if the belt operates at or in the close vicinity of its critical angular velocity it will almost certainly fail! The critical angular velocity depends on the <b>material</b> <b>retardation</b> time (location in the frequency spectrum), while the magnitude of the accumulated strain is dictated by the strength of the corresponding discrete spectrum lines. Thus, the mechanical spectrum of the elastomeric material from which the belt is constructed is the most important material function for predicting the durability of drive belts and similarly dynamically loaded elastomeric products...|$|E

40|$|Interactions between {{diffusing}} impurity {{atoms and}} dislocations can occur during or following the deformation of metals. These interactions cause dislocation pinning, leading to strain aging. At lower temperatures (800 °C), substitutional impurities {{are expected to}} be most influential. The same mechanisms that result in the yield drops, increased flow stresses and increased work hardening associated with strain aging at low temperatures should result in significant modification of recovery and recrystallization behaviour at higher temperatures. The present work involves the deformation of austenitic (304) stainless steel at high temperatures (800 °C to 1280 °C) in 1 -hit and 2 -hit high-temperature compression and multi-hit hot torsion testing. Experimental variables include the strain rate, temperature and interpass time. Significant anomalies in the static softening kinetics are observed; under certain deformation conditions, the normal relationship between temperature and fractional softening is reversed. This effect is attributed to the non-equilibrium segregation of phosphorus during the interpass holding time.

The {{purpose of this study is}} to evaluate alternative landfill liner materials that could be utilized in conjunction with current liners in order to improve the liner's performance by preventing the release of hazardous chemicals into the subsurface environment. Five alternative liner materials were tested in this study: granular activated carbon, lignite, compost, peat moss, and powdered activated carbon produced from cotton gin trash. Three volatile organic compounds are used in this study: Benzene, Toluene, and O-Xylene. The linear Langmuir isotherm coefficients, Qo, and b, and the linear adsorption distribution coefficient K,,.,, were determined by equilibrium studies for each chemical and <b>material.</b> The <b>retardation</b> factor, R., was calculated from the breakthrough curve data for each combination of chemical and material. The cotton gin trash dissolved in the presence of each of the solvents so no data is presented for this material. Because activated carbon sorbed all of the chemical during the isotherm testing, no data could be collected for the extraction procedure. Lignite has the highest adsorption capacity of the three remaining materials and the second highest retardation factor. Activated carbon has the highest retardation factor of each of the chemicals, as expected. The results show that the adsorption capacity and the retardation factor are more dependent on surface area and pore diameter than on the organic carbon content of the test materials. Lignite is the leading candidate after this study to be used as an additive material in liner design. However, further evaluation of these liner materials must be accomplished in order to determine which material, if any, could be added to the design of landfill liners to aid in preventing the release of hazardous chemicals into the subsurface environment and groundwater supply...|$|R

40|$|The out-of-plane {{birefringence}} and its wavelength dispersion are studied employing solution-cast {{films of}} cellulose triacetate (CTA). In solution-cast process, CTA molecules are induced to align {{in the film}} plane. Although refractive index is {{the lowest in the}} oriented direction for the CTA films stretched more than 110 %, refractive index is found to be the lowest in the normal direction for the unstretched cast film. ATR measurements reveal that in-plane alignment of the acetyl group which provides strong polarizability anisotropy is responsible for the phenomenon. Furthermore, the out-of-plane birefringence is found to increase with increasing wavelength, i. e., extraordinary wavelength dispersion, whereas a stretched CTA film shows ordinary wavelength dispersion. The level of the out-of-plane birefringence in cast films depends on the preparation conditions, which is predictable considering the evaporation rate. Moreover, it is demonstrated {{for the first time that}} the out-of-plane birefringence and its wavelength dispersion can be modified by addition of a certain plasticizer such as tricresyl phosphate (TCP).

Gas-flow experiments were conducted using columns packed with small pieces of cement mortar obtained from the grinding of typical concrete <b>material.</b> Transport and <b>retardation</b> of TCE at high vapor concentrations (500 mg L− 1) was {{compared to that of}} a non-reactive gas tracer (Sulfur Hexafluoride, SF 6). The results show a large magnitude of retardation (retardation factor = 23) and sorption (sorption coefficient = 10. 6 cm 3 g− 1) for TCE, compared to negligible sorption for SF 6. This magnitude of sorption obtained with pollutant vapor is much bigger than the one obtained for aqueous-flow experiments conducted for water-saturated systems. The considerable sorption exhibited for TCE under vapor-flow conditions is attributed to some combination of accumulation at the air-water interface and vapor-phase adsorption, both of which are anticipated to be significant for this system given the large surface area associated with the cement mortar. Transport of both SF 6 and TCE was simulated successfully with a two-region physical non-equilibrium model, consistent with the dual-medium structure of the crushed cement mortar.

The surfactant {{was found to}} be a useful hydrogen source in improving the TeCB photodecay via photoreduction process, while the light attenuation effect resulted from the nontarget compounds in the solution, and the impact of humic materials that co-extracted from the soil played important roles in the process of photolvtic destruction of TeCB. A well-defined sediment, EPA- 11, was used as the source of humic materials in examining the acceleration and quenching effects in the photolysis process. Experimental results indicated that the low dose of humic materials mainly acted as a supplementary hydrogen source to improve the photodegradation rate, while at a higher dose its amphoteric property of being a photochemical quencher become perceptible gradually, thus retarding the reaction. These effects were inspected and the dominant rate constants were quantified through the examination of possible sub-reactions in the assistant of proposed linear models in this study. The models under three different conditions at zero, low, and high humic levels associated with a light attenuation model were successfully developed to solve the dominant rate constants of the process.

40|$|A {{new method}} of {{continuous}} extrusion of aluminium, utilizing a screw tocompact scrap material into an extrusion prole, is being developed. Suchdirect recycling shows great advantages compared to traditional extrusion,especially {{in terms of}} the energy efficiency of the process. As a part of anindustrial project aiming to developing this extrusion method within a setof specic goals, the present work contributes to characterization andunderstanding with regard to extrudate quality. A test scheme producingcylindrical extrudates at controlled parameters was carried out, where theextrusion was performed with variations in die temperature, material feedand the rotation speed of the screw. The eect of these parametervariations to the nal extruded material was studied. This included studiesof the microstructure, mechanical properties and the materials response toheat treatment. The systematical variations in die temperature from 550 *C to 590 *Cindicated that a low die temperature yields a material with a favorablemicrostructure and mechanical properties, where low die temperature gavematerial with less recystallized grains. The ultimate tensile strength, yieldstress and elongation at fracture was highest for the extrudate produced atthe lowest die temperature. By an increase in die temperature to 560 and 575 *C, more recrystallized grains was observed, and consequently adecrease in ultimate tensile strength, yield stress and elongation at fracture. With a die temperature of 590 *C, a more porous material was observed,and larger variations in the properties along the extrudate was observed. The feed rate was varied from 100 to 500 g/min and gave more visualeects on the material. At a feed rate of approximate 100 g/min, most ofthe deformation structure was retained in the material. Also, much lessporosity was observed for this material. Only small band on the peripheryof this extrudate was recrystallized after extrusion. This was reected by the mechanical properties, i. e. this material showed the overall highestultimate tensile strength. At feed rates of 300, 400 and 500 g/min, theamount of recrystallized grains was observed to increase, as well as theporosity. A decrease in ultimate tensile strength, yield stress and elongationat fracture was consequently observed at increased feed rates. By varying the rotation speed of the screw, a decrease in the amount ofrecrystallized grains was observed as the rotation speed was increased. Theamount of retained deformation structure was gradually increasing, and as aconsequence, the ultimate tensile strength and yield stress was increasingcorrespondingly. Compared to material extruded conventionally by direct extrsion from abillet, the general observation is that the microstructure in the screwextruded <b>material</b> favors the <b>retardation</b> of the deformation structure. Thematerial produced from the billet had equiaxed recrystallized grainsthroughout the whole mass. Investigation of the material after heat treatment showed that the screwextruded material overall had a fairly good response to heat treatment.

40|$|Hydrophobic organic {{contaminants}} (HOCs) {{released from}} non-aqueous phase liquids (NAPLs) impose a serious risk on groundwater quality. The concentrations in groundwater of these toxic, cancerogenic and mutagenic compounds are at many sites far above legal limits. The time scale of contaminant emission could be centuries or longer {{due to their}} extremely low water solubility and the diffision limited dissolution. Due to the Same reasons conventional pump and treat remediation techniques can be not successful. Surface active agents (surfactants) are considered to overcome this limitations. Surfactants assemble at the solid-water interface as monomers, monolayers and bilayers (admicelles) depending on the bulk solution surfactant concentration. Above the critical micelle concentration (CMC) they form micelles in the aqueous phase due to their amphiphilic (hydrophilic-hydrophobic) properties. HOCs have a high affinity to the hydrophobic surfactant pseudophases created by the hydrophobic, oil-like moieties of the surfactant molecules either adsorbed to the solid (monolayer, bilayer) or mobile in the aqueous phase (monomers, micelles). The increase of the apparent water solubility of HOCs due to partitioning into micelles is known as solubilization. Analogous, the partitioning into adsorbed surfactant admicelles is known as adsolubilization. Thus, the surfactants can act either to enhance or reduce HOCs sorption to aquifer material from the aqueous solution depending on the surfactant concentration. An understanding of the processes influencing the transport of surfactant and the coupled transport of surfactants and HOCs in groundwater is an essential foundation {{for the design of}} surfactant enhanced subsurface remediation (SESR) technologies. Therefore, laboratory batch and column experiments were performed using phenanthrene as a chemical probe for the HOCs, different anionic, nonionic and cationic surfactants and different natural aquifer materials. The CMC and the surface area per molecule were determined from surface tension measurements. The results show that the CMC of the surfactants in the presence of electrolytes is decreased compared to the CMC in pure water. The surfactant sorption can be described by a typical nonlinear isotherm consisting of a linear part for concentrations below the CMC and an adsorption maximum qmax above the CMC where a complete surfactant bilayer is established. Different qmax values were found for different lithocomponents of the aquifer materials examined. Generally the sandstones show the highest values, followed by Triassic limestones, Jurassic limestones and quartzes. A surfactant specific surface area AWv was calculated from qmax and compared to other specific surface areas. The external surface area Aext, assuming the aquifer grains as ideal, nonporous spheres shows no influence on Asurf i. e. the grain size does not control surfactant adsorption. The comparison son of Asurf with the cumulative surface area determined by N 2 -adsorption (BET) and Hg-intrusion indicates that surfactants can access macropores (> 50 nm) but not mesopores (2 nm - 5 O nm) and micropores (< 2 nm). A comparison of Asurf with BET indicates that in average about 2 % of the BET surface area can be 'seen' by surfactants. The surfactant column experiments indicate that the surfactant transport is close to equilibrium and can be reasonably well predicted by the adsorption isotherm. The surfactant adsorption is completely reversible. The adsolubilization kinetics are fast and can be described by a first order process. To distinguish between the contributions to phenanthrene sorption of surfactant monolayers and bilayers the partitioning of phenanthrene onto the surfactant coated aquifer material was quantified over a wide range of surfactant loading. The bilayer partitioning coefficient (Kbl) was found to be a factor of 3 larger compared to monolayer partitioning coeficient (Kbl). The respective partitioning coefficients to the surfactant pseudophases in the mobile aqueous phase (Kmic, and Kmn) are smaller. The different surfactants show different efficiencies in terms of sorbing phenanthrene from the aqueous phase. However, the coefficients (including literature data) are in a similar range. Thus, the transport behavior of phenanthrene depends strongly On the adsorption behavior of the surfactant present in the System. The retardation of phenanthrene in column experiments increases with increasing surfactant conceniration below the CMC due to the increasing surfactant loading of the aquifer <b>material</b> (enhanced <b>retardation).</b> The phenanthrene retardation decreases again with further increasing surfactant concentration until a facilitated transport can be observed for surfactant concentrations well above the CMC. The phenanthrene distribution coefficients and thus the retardation factors in the presence of surfactants can be reasonably well predicted by a mass balance model. This denotes for the different surfactant pseudophases in the mobile (micelles and monomers) and the immobile (monolayers, bilayers) phase and the respective partitioning coefficients determined in independent equilibrium batch experiments. Transport von Tensiden und gekoppelter Transport von polyzyklischen aromatischen Kohlenwasserstoffen (PAKS) und Tensiden in natürlichem Aquifermaterial - Laborexperimente Organische Flüssigkeiten, die nicht mit Wasser mischbar sind (Non-Aqueous Phase Liquids: NAPLs), wie z. B. Benzin, Hydrauliköl, Teeröl, Kreosot, chlorierte Lösemittel etc. gelangten an vielen Standorten (Tankstellen, Gaswerke, Flughäfen, Raffinerien, militärische Liegenschaften, Industrie etc.) in den Untergrund. Obwohl NAPLs als separate Flüssigphasen im Untergrund vorliegen, lösen sich aus ihnen Inhaltsstoffe, die z. T. giftig, krebserregend oder erbgutverändernd sind (z. B. Benzol oder polyzyklische aromatische Kohlenwasserstoffe), in das vorbeifließende Grundwasser und verursachen Schadstofffahnen im Abstrom. Die Konzentrationen dieser organischen Schadstoffe liegen häufig weit über den zulässigen Werten der Trinkwasserverordnung. NAPLs stellen deshalb eine große Gefahr für die Qualität des Grundwassers dar und können dieses für eine Nutzung als Trinkwasser unbrauchbar machen. Aufgrund der geringen Wasserlöslichkeit der NAPL-bürtigen Schadstoffe und der daraus resultierenden langsamen Lösung bleiben NAPLs und damit die Gefährdung Jahrzehnte bzw. Jahrhunderte bestehen. Die langsame Lösung ist auch dafür verantwortlich, daß konventionelle Sanierungsmaßnahmen, bei denen das Grundwasser zur Entfernung der Schadstoffe abgepumpt wird (pump and treat) in einem ökonomisch vertretbarem Zeitraum (50 nm), nicht aber in Meso- (2 nm - 50 nm) und Mikroporen (< 2 nm) erreichen kann. Im Mittel werden ca. 2 % der BET-Grenzfläche von den Tensiden "gesehen". Die Säulenversuche zeigten, daß der Tensidtransport nahezu unter Gleichgewichtsbedingungen stattfindet und damit aus der Gleichgewichts-Adsorptionsisotheme vorhergesagt werden kann. Die Tensidsorption ist vollständig reversibel. Der Transport von Phenanthren in Anwesenheit von Tensiden wird neben der Sorption am Aquifermaterial durch die Affinität zu den adsorbierten, immobilien Tensiden (Monolagen, Admizellen) und den Tensiden in der mobilen Wasserphase (Monomere, Mizellen) bestimmt. Diese Affinität wurde in Batchexperimenten durch Verteilungskoeffizienten quantifiziert. Der Verteilungskoefizient zu den sorbierten Tensiddoppellagen (Kbl) ist ungeflihr einen Faktor 3 größer als zu den Tensidmonolagen sidmonolagen (Kml). Die Verteilungskoefizienten zu den entsprechenden Tensidpseudophasen im mobilen Wasser (Monomere und Mizellen) sind etwas niedriger. Die verschiedenden untersuchten Tensiden sind unterschiedlich effizient, um Phenanthren zu solubilisieren bzw. adsolubilisieren. Generell liegen die Veteilungskoeffizienten (Literaturdaten eingeschlossen) jedoch in einem ähnlichen Bereich. Der Transport von Phenanthren hängt deshalb sehr stark vom Adsorptionsverhalten des Tensids im Aquifer ab. In Säulenversuchen wurde gezeigt, daß die Retardation von Phenanthren unterhalb der CMC mit steigender Tensidkonzentration und damit steigender Tensidbelegung des Aquifermaterials linear zunimmt (erhöhte Retardation). Die höchste Retardation wird im Bereich der CMC beobachtet. Eine Erhöhung der Tensidkonzentration über die CMC bewirkt die Abnahme der Retardation infolge der Erhöhung der Mizellenkonzentration in der mobilen Phase. Eine höhere Transportgeschwindigkeit von Phenanthren verglichen mit dem tensidfieien System wird erst bei Konzentrationen deutlich über der CMC erreicht. Der Transport von Phenanthren in Säulenexperimenten mit natürlichem Aquifermaterial läßt sich mit einem Massenbilanzmodell, in das die Parameter aus den Batchversuchen eingehen, hinreichend gut vorhersagen...|$|R
