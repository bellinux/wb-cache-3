5|$|The play {{can also}} be seen as a {{predecessor}} to the exaggerated emotionalism of later American drama, and as an early example of how background <b>music</b> <b>would</b> be used in more modern American drama and films.|$|E
5|$|A gallery feature {{was also}} planned and would allow players to unlock bonus {{material}} {{depending on their}} progression in the game. Fan artwork and <b>music</b> <b>would</b> be unlockable through this feature, as well as minigames, including a card game similar to Triple Triad from Final Fantasy VIII. The remake {{was expected to be}} released on the Internet for free and played on console emulators, since there would be no cartridge version due to financial constraints. Only a semi-working 3D test was actually completed, and the project was discontinued in mid-2000 due to a number of factors, including the accidental loss of Lazur's data and his desire to improve his programming skills.|$|E
5|$|As {{preparations}} {{were made}} for the US tour, the Beatles knew that their <b>music</b> <b>would</b> hardly be heard. Having originally used Vox AC30 amplifiers, they later acquired more powerful 100-watt amplifiers, specially designed by Vox for them as they moved into larger venues in 1964, but these were still inadequate. Struggling {{to compete with the}} volume of sound generated by screaming fans, the band had grown increasingly bored with the routine of performing live. Recognising that their shows were no longer about the music, they decided to make the August tour their last.|$|E
5000|$|Following the {{positive}} response, the Mumbai-based audio company Venus <b>Music,</b> who <b>would</b> market the album, {{expressed interest in}} a music video of the song in Hindi language. Silambarasan himself was asked to shoot for the <b>music</b> video, which <b>would</b> be premiered on Bollywood <b>music</b> channels. This <b>would</b> also mark Silambarasan's Bollywood debut. The song titled [...] "Kaun Hai Baap Tera", featuring Silambarasan, is penned by Shabbir Ahmed.|$|R

5|$|Following {{several years}} of {{relative}} inactivity as the band maintained their relaxed touring pace, Perry began writing material for a new Daddies album in early 2006, claiming to {{have come to the}} realization of a cathartic reliance on songwriting. In an April 2006 radio interview, he confirmed that the band was in preparation over recording a new studio album, noting that the <b>music</b> <b>would</b> cover new territory for the Daddies, drawing heavily on tropical themes. This was followed shortly thereafter by the band's first U.S. tour since 2000, where much of this new material was debuted.|$|E
5|$|BÃ¶cker later {{explained}} {{that the decision to}} focus on Square Enix was made due to the large library of games to choose from, all of which he felt had a distinct sound, and many of which were very well known in Germany. An emphasis was put on balancing out the concert program and the arrangements, so that the <b>music</b> <b>would</b> appeal to first-time listeners, classical music fans, and longtime gamers. The titles chosen to be featured in the concert were Kingdom Hearts and Kingdom Hearts II from the Kingdom Hearts series, Secret of Mana, Chrono Trigger and Chrono Cross from the Chrono series, and the Final Fantasy series. In order to select the pieces presented, the original composers were consulted to assemble a list of their personal favorites. The composers were Yoko Shimomura for the music of Kingdom Hearts, Hiroki Kikuta for the music of Secret of Mana, Yasunori Mitsuda for the music of Chrono Trigger and Cross, and Nobuo Uematsu for the music of the Final Fantasy series.|$|E
5|$|The game's {{music was}} {{composed}} by Peter McConnell, Michael Land and Clint Bajakian. The three had {{worked together to}} share the duties equally of composing the music for Monkey Island 2 and Fate of Atlantis, and continued this approach for Day of the Tentacle. According to McConnell, he had composed most of the music {{taking place in the}} game's present, Land for the future, and Bajakian for the past, outside of Dr. Fred's theme for the past which McConnell had done. The music was composed around the cartoonist nature of the game play, further drawing on Looney Tunes' use of parodying classical works of music, and playing on set themes for all of the major characters in the game. Many of these themes had to be composed to take into account different processing speeds of computers at the time, managed by the iMUSE music interface; such themes would include shorter repeating patterns that would play while the game's screen scrolled across, and then once the screen was at the proper place, the <b>music</b> <b>would</b> continue on to a more dramatic phrase.|$|E

50|$|After a 3-year hiatus, Viacom International Media Networks Africa {{announced}} that the MTV Africa <b>Music</b> Awards <b>would</b> return on 7 June 2014.

5|$|The {{music was}} {{composed}} {{by a team}} consisting of Motoi Sakuraba, Yuzo Koshiro, Masafumi Takada, Noriyuki Iwadare, Takahiro Nishi, and Yasunori Mitsuda. Nishi acted as the music director, while orchestration was handled by Mitsuda and his studio assistant Natsumi Kameoka. Early in the game's development, Sakurai and Nishi were in discussions about what the style of Uprisings <b>music</b> <b>would</b> be, and which composers to hire for it. The composers were those who had contributed most prominently to Super Smash Bros. Brawl. The music involved both live orchestral music, synthesized tracks, and tracks that combined both musical styles. The air battle themes were created to match the dialogue and action on-screen, which was stated early on {{to be an important}} goal. Another aspect of the music, as noted by Koshiro, was that it should stand out while not interfering with dialogue. Sakuraba and Koshiro were brought in fairly early, and thus encountered difficulties with creating their music. Sakuraba recalled that he needed to rewrite the opening theme multiple times after his first demo clashed with the footage he saw due to his not knowing much about the game's world. Takada came on board when there was an ample amount of footage, but was shocked when he saw gameplay from the game's fifth chapter and tried to create suitable music within Sakurai's guidelines.|$|E
25|$|This period {{overlaps}} with {{the beginnings of}} Johnson's serious forays into Third Stream music (see below). Periods of writing and recording his <b>music</b> <b>would</b> alternate with tours demanding attention to his playing.|$|E
25|$|Westbury Road is {{the name}} of the area Rihanna grew up in back in Barbados. The <b>music</b> <b>would</b> be {{distributed}} through Universal Music Group. Westbury Road Entertainment's artist roster includes Melissa Forde as the label's photographer, and KazeLoon.|$|E

25|$|Ward died in 1903, {{not knowing}} the {{national}} stature his <b>music</b> <b>would</b> attain since the music was only first applied to the song in 1904. Bates was more fortunate since the song's popularity was well established {{by the time of}} her death in 1929.|$|E
25|$|The RIAA {{and music}} publishers, {{concerned}} that consumers' {{ability to make}} perfect digital copies of <b>music</b> <b>would</b> destroy the market for audio recordings, had threatened to sue companies and had lobbied Congress to pass legislation imposing mandatory copy protection technology and royalties on devices and media.|$|E
25|$|The musical {{started to}} diverge from the {{relatively}} narrow {{confines of the}} 1950s.

5000|$|Mathis {{described}} his degree {{of interest in}} this project in the liner notes on the back cover of the original album. [...] "'I love everything about Latin American music: the rhythms, the melodies, the sentiment and the passion. There is no <b>music</b> I <b>would</b> rather listen to - no <b>music</b> I <b>would</b> rather sing.'" [...] In an interview for the 2012 CD release, he recalled this intensity. [...] "'All my enthusiasm came out on this particular album.'" ...|$|R
5000|$|Rouse {{wrote in}} the program notes to the piece: My concept of the work was to {{introduce}} a series of 'circular' musical ideas that would repeat over and over until metamorphosing to a new idea that would then also be repeated {{in the same fashion}} until becoming yet another. These <b>musics</b> <b>would</b> be of different lengths so that their repeated overlaps would produce a constantly changing sonic landscape. Sometimes these ideas would repeat verbatim; at other times there would be gradual but constant development within each repetition. Some instruments <b>would</b> introduce new <b>musics</b> while others <b>would</b> continue to repeat their material {{for a longer period of}} time before moving on to a new idea.|$|R
25|$|In {{spite of}} this however, the <b>music</b> <b>would</b> {{continue}} its development against the odds. Along with the plethora of symphonic/progressive bands, heavies Vox Dei and Pappo's Blues continued to sustain their popularity during the period. Yet another heavy metal band, Plus, made their debut in '76 and enjoyed success {{through the end of}} the decade.|$|E
25|$|During {{the studio}} sessions, every band member's {{instrument}} was miked and captured {{as they were}} writing {{so that they could}} simulate ahead of time exactly how the <b>music</b> <b>would</b> sound when it was formally recorded.
