5|$|Acute <b>myeloid</b> leukemia is a curable disease; {{the chance}} of cure for a {{specific}} person depends {{on a number of}} prognostic factors.|$|E
5|$|Acute leukemias of {{ambiguous}} lineage (also {{known as}} mixed phenotype or biphenotypic acute leukemia) {{occur when the}} leukemic cells can not be classified as either <b>myeloid</b> or lymphoid cells, or where both types of cells are present.|$|E
5|$|Acute <b>myeloid</b> leukemia is a {{relatively}} rare cancer. There are approximately 10,500 new cases {{each year in the}} United States, and the incidence rate has remained stable from 1995 through 2005. AML accounts for 1.2% of all cancer deaths in the United States.|$|E
5|$|The WHO 2008 {{classification}} of acute <b>myeloid</b> leukemia attempts {{to be more}} clinically useful and to produce more meaningful prognostic information than the FAB criteria. Each of the WHO categories contains numerous descriptive subcategories {{of interest to the}} hematopathologist and oncologist; however, most of the clinically significant information in the WHO schema is communicated via categorization into one of the subtypes listed below.|$|E
5|$|Three of the {{observers}} eventually died of {{conditions that are}} known to be promoted by radiation: Graves of a heart attack 20 years later at age 55; Cieslicki of acute <b>myeloid</b> leukemia 19 years later at age 42; and Young of aplastic anemia and bacterial infection of the heart lining 27 years later at age 83. Although some of those deaths were probably latent stochastic (random) effects of the accident, {{it is not possible to}} draw any definitive conclusions from such a small sample set.|$|E
5|$|Base J (beta-d-glucopyranosyloxymethyluracil), a {{modified}} form of uracil, {{is also found}} in several organisms: the flagellates Diplonema and Euglena, and all the kinetoplastid genera. Biosynthesis of J occurs in two steps: in the first step, a specific thymidine in DNA is converted into hydroxymethyldeoxyuridine; in the second, HOMedU is glycosylated to form J. Proteins that bind specifically to this base have been identified. These proteins appear to be distant relatives of the Tet1 oncogene that is involved in the pathogenesis of acute <b>myeloid</b> leukemia. J appears to act as a termination signal for RNA polymerase II.|$|E
5|$|In 1976, {{thousands}} of inhabitants of Seveso, Italy {{were exposed to}} TCDD after an accidental release of several kilograms of TCDD from a pressure tank. A number of animals died, and high concentrations of TCDD, up to 56,000 pg/g of fat, were noted especially in children playing outside and eating local food. The acute effects were limited to about 200 cases of chloracne. Long-term effects seem to include a slight excess of multiple myeloma and <b>myeloid</b> leukaemia, {{as well as some}} developmental effects such as disturbed development of teeth and excess of girls born to fathers who were exposed as children. Several other long-term effects have been suspected, but the evidence is not very strong.|$|E
5|$|The disease-modifying {{treatments}} {{have several}} adverse effects. One {{of the most}} common is irritation at the injection site for glatiramer acetate and the interferons (up to 90% with subcutaneous injections and 33% with intramuscular injections). Over time, a visible dent at the injection site, due to the local destruction of fat tissue, known as lipoatrophy, may develop. Interferons may produce flu-like symptoms; some people taking glatiramer experience a post-injection reaction with flushing, chest tightness, heart palpitations, and anxiety, which usually lasts less than thirty minutes. More dangerous but much less common are liver damage from interferons, systolic dysfunction (12%), infertility, and acute <b>myeloid</b> leukemia (0.8%) from mitoxantrone, and progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy occurring with natalizumab (occurring in 1 in 600 people treated).|$|E
5|$|The α-chemokine SDF-1, a ligand for CXCR4, {{suppresses}} {{replication of}} T-tropic HIV-1 isolates. It does this by down-regulating {{the expression of}} CXCR4 {{on the surface of}} these cells. HIV that use only the CCR5 receptor are termed R5; those that use only CXCR4 are termed X4, and those that use both, X4R5. However, the use of coreceptor alone does not explain viral tropism, as not all R5 viruses are able to use CCR5 on macrophages for a productive infection and HIV can also infect a subtype of <b>myeloid</b> dendritic cells, which probably constitute a reservoir that maintains infection when CD4+ T cell numbers have declined to extremely low levels.|$|E
25|$|Erythropoietin is {{required}} for a <b>myeloid</b> progenitor cell to become an erythrocyte. On the other hand, thrombopoietin makes <b>myeloid</b> progenitor cells differentiate to megakaryocytes (thrombocyte-forming cells).|$|E
25|$|In March {{researchers}} {{announced the}} successful use of gene therapy to treat two adult patients for X-linked chronic granulomatous disease, a disease which affects <b>myeloid</b> cells and damages the immune system. The {{study is the}} first to show that gene therapy can treat the <b>myeloid</b> system.|$|E
25|$|Some {{interest}} {{has been seen}} in its possible use {{as a treatment for}} cancers, especially acute <b>myeloid</b> leukemia.|$|E
25|$|Oligopotent {{stem cells}} can {{differentiate}} into {{only a few}} cell types, such as lymphoid or <b>myeloid</b> stem cells.|$|E
25|$|Research on mice {{suggests}} that Zileuton used {{alone or in}} combination with imatinib may inhibit chronic <b>myeloid</b> leukemia (CML).|$|E
25|$|On June 26, 2012, Ephron {{died from}} pneumonia, a {{complication}} resulting from acute <b>myeloid</b> leukemia, a condition {{with which she}} was diagnosed in 2006.|$|E
25|$|Cancer {{stem cells}} were first {{identified}} by John Dick in acute <b>myeloid</b> leukemia {{in the late}} 1990s. Since the early 2000s they have been an intense cancer research focus.|$|E
25|$|As well as {{classical}} αβ T cells (their {{development of}} which is outlined above), {{a number of other}} T lineages develop in the thymus, including γδ T cells and Natural Killer T (NKT)cells. Additionally, other non-T hematopoietic lineages can develop in the thymus, including B lymphocytes (B cells), Natural Killer lymphocytes (NK cells).), <b>myeloid</b> cells, and dendritic cells. However, the thymus is not a source of B, NK, or <b>myeloid</b> development. The development of these cells in the thymus reflects the multipotent nature of hematopoitic prognitors that seed the thymus.|$|E
25|$|Following John-Henry's {{unexpected}} {{illness and}} death from acute <b>myeloid</b> leukemia on March 6, 2004, John-Henry's body was also transported to Alcor, in {{fulfillment of the}} family agreement.|$|E
25|$|Due {{in part to}} the {{development}} of imatinib and related drugs, the five year survival rate for people with chronic <b>myeloid</b> leukemia increased from 31% in 1993 to 59% in 2003 to 2009.|$|E
25|$|In <b>myeloid</b> or myelogenous leukemias, the {{cancerous}} change {{takes place}} in a type of marrow cell that normally goes on to form red blood cells, some other types of white cells, and platelets.|$|E
25|$|Predisposition {{of acute}} <b>myeloid</b> leukemia; {{skeletal}} abnormalities; radial hypoplasia and vertebral defect and other physical abnormalities, bone marrow failure (pancytopenia), endocrine dysfunction, early onset osteopenia/osteoporosis and lipid abnormalities, spontaneous chromosomal breakage exacerbated {{by exposure to}} DNA cross-linking agents.|$|E
25|$|The exact {{cause of}} leukemia is unknown. Different kinds of leukemia are {{believed}} to have different causes. Both inherited and environmental (non-inherited) factors {{are believed to}} be involved. Risk factors include smoking, ionizing radiation, some chemicals (such as benzene), prior chemotherapy, and Down syndrome. People with a family history of leukemia are also at higher risk. There are four main types of leukemia — acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), acute <b>myeloid</b> leukemia (AML), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and chronic <b>myeloid</b> leukemia (CML) — {{as well as a number}} of less common types. Leukemias and lymphomas both belong to a broader group of tumors that affect the blood, bone marrow, and lymphoid system, known as tumors of the hematopoietic and lymphoid tissues.|$|E
25|$|Numerous {{clinical}} trials {{are already in}} the pipeline or being conducted to explore further use for lenalidomide, alone or in combination with other drugs. Some of these indications include acute <b>myeloid</b> leukemia, follicular lymphoma, MALT lymphoma, Waldenström macroglobulinemia, lupus erythematosus, Hodgkin's lymphoma, myelodysplastic syndrome and more.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to proliferation, differentiation and T lineage commitment occurs within the DN thymocyte population. Commitment, {{or loss of}} alternative lineage potentials (such as <b>myeloid,</b> B, and NK lineage potentials), is dependent on Notch signaling, and is complete by the DN3 stage. Following T lineage commitment, DN3 thymocytes undergo β-selection.|$|E
25|$|BI811283 {{is a small}} {{molecule}} inhibitor of {{the aurora}} B kinase protein being developed by Boehringer Ingelheim for use as an anti-cancer agent. BI 811283 is currently {{in the early stages}} of clinical development and is undergoing first-in-human trials in patients with solid tumors and Acute <b>Myeloid</b> Leukaemia.|$|E
25|$|Tetrasomy and hexasomy 8 {{are rare}} {{compared}} to trisomy 8, {{which is the}} most common karyotypic finding in acute <b>myeloid</b> leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). AML, MDS, or myeloproliferative disorder (MPD) with a high incidence of secondary diseases and a six-month survival rate are associated with a polysomy 8 syndrome.|$|E
25|$|Low {{platelet}} {{concentration is}} thrombocytopenia and {{is due to}} either decreased production or increased destruction. Elevated platelet concentration is thrombocytosis and is either congenital, reactive (to cytokines), or due to unregulated production: one of the myeloproliferative neoplasms or certain other <b>myeloid</b> neoplasms. A disorder of platelet function is a thrombocytopathy.|$|E
25|$|Clonal eosinophilias {{are caused}} by {{acquired}} genetic mutations in hematopoietic stem cells that leads to, or are associated with, a form of chronic eosinophilic leukemia or various forms of <b>myeloid</b> neoplasms, lymphoid neoplasms, myelofibrosis, or the myelodysplastic syndrome. The latter forms of clonal eosinophilia are commonly associated with blood or tissue eosinophilia.|$|E
25|$|For {{a decade}} now, the {{evidence}} is growing that HSC maturation follows a myeloid-based model instead of the 'classical' schoolbook dichotomy model. In the latter model, the HSC first generates a common myeloid-erythroid progenitor (CMEP) and a common lymphoid progenitor (CLP). The CLP produces only T or B cells. The myeloid-based model postulates that HSCs first diverge into the CMEP and a common myelo-lymphoid progenitor (CMLP), which generates T and B cell progenitors through a bipotential myeloid-T progenitor and a myeloid-B progenitor stage. The main difference is that in this new model, all erythroid, T and B lineage branches retain the potential to generate <b>myeloid</b> cells (even after the segregation of T and B cell lineages). The model proposes the idea of erythroid, T and B cells as specialized types of a prototypic <b>myeloid</b> HSC. Read more in Kawamoto et al. 2010.|$|E
25|$|Vitamin A is {{essential}} to maintain intact epithelial tissues as a physical barrier to infection; it is also involved in maintaining a number of immune cell types from both the innate and acquired immune systems. These include the lymphocytes (B-cells, T-cells, and natural killer cells), {{as well as many}} myelocytes (neutrophils, macrophages, and <b>myeloid</b> dendritic cells).|$|E
25|$|Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are a {{group of}} cancers in which {{immature}} blood cells in the bone marrow do not mature and therefore do not become healthy blood cells. Early on there are typically no symptoms. Later symptoms may include feeling tired, shortness of breath, easy bleeding, or frequent infections. Some types may develop into acute <b>myeloid</b> leukemia.|$|E
25|$|Two US Federal {{court cases}} {{resulted}} from the Baneberry event. Two NTS workers {{who were exposed to}} high levels of radiation from Baneberry died in 1974, both from acute <b>myeloid</b> leukemia. The district court found that although the Government had acted negligently, the radiation from the Baneberry test did not cause the leukemia cases. The district decision was upheld on appeal in 1996.|$|E
25|$|On 24 September 2007, Manning went to Cuba for {{a routine}} medical evaluation. For many years, he {{had engaged in}} a regular {{exercise}} program. On 23 January 2012, Manning suffered a stroke. Diagnosis of acute <b>myeloid</b> leukemia was confirmed on 30 June 2016 and he died at 8:15 AM on 2 July 2016 at the San Fernando General Hospital, six weeks before his 70th birthday.|$|E
25|$|Interleukin-2 and interferon-α are cytokines, {{proteins}} that regulate and coordinate the behaviour {{of the immune}} system. They {{have the ability to}} enhance anti-tumor activity and thus can be used as passive cancer treatments. Interferon-α is used in the treatment of hairy-cell leukaemia, AIDS-related Kaposi's sarcoma, follicular lymphoma, chronic <b>myeloid</b> leukaemia and malignant melanoma. Interleukin-2 is used in the treatment of malignant melanoma and renal cell carcinoma.|$|E
25|$|Chronic myelogenous (or <b>myeloid</b> or myelocytic) leukemia (CML), {{also known}} as chronic granulocytic leukemia (CGL), is a cancer of the white blood cells. It {{is a form of}} leukemia {{characterized}} by the increased and unregulated growth of predominantly <b>myeloid</b> cells in the bone marrow and the accumulation of these cells in the blood. CML is a clonal bone marrow stem cell disorder in which a proliferation of mature granulocytes (neutrophils, eosinophils and basophils) and their precursors is found. It is a type of myeloproliferative neoplasm associated with a characteristic chromosomal translocation called the Philadelphia chromosome. CML is now largely treated with targeted drugs called tyrosine-kinase inhibitors (TKIs) which have led to dramatically improved long-term survival rates since the introduction of the first such agent in 2001. These drugs have revolutionized treatment of this disease and allow most patients to have a good quality of life when compared to the former chemotherapy drugs. In Western countries, CML accounts for 15–25% of all adult leukemias and 14% of leukemias overall (including the pediatric population, where CML is less common).|$|E
25|$|Development of {{secondary}} neoplasia after successful chemotherapy or radiotherapy treatment can occur. The most common secondary neoplasm is secondary acute <b>myeloid</b> leukemia, which develops primarily after treatment with alkylating agents or topoisomerase inhibitors. Survivors of childhood cancer {{are more than}} 13 {{times as likely to}} get a secondary neoplasm during the 30 years after treatment than the general population. Not all of this increase can be attributed to chemotherapy.|$|E
