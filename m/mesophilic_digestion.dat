40|$|The use of <b>mesophilic</b> {{anaerobic}} <b>digestion</b> {{for treatment}} of organic wastes is a growing biotechnology for sustainable energy supply. Ammonia inhibition {{is a major problem}} in anaerobic digestion mainly when digestion of nitrogen-rich substrates such as livestock wastes and manure occurs. This paper provides a summary of research conducted on ammonia inhibition of the anaerobic process. An experiment with <b>mesophilic</b> <b>digestions</b> of swine manure was conducted in single unit reactors, which were controlled under different ammonia concentrations by addition of NH 4 Cl in different amounts. From the experimental results, it was shown that NH 4 Cl could be an effective chemical agent for removing foam and scum in the digester. Methane production was decreased with the increasing NH 4 Cl addition until a collapse was observed between 11. 2 g NH 4 +-N/l and 13. 2 g NH 4 +-N/l. Contrary to the findings in thermophilic digestion, a dysfunction of acidogenesis was also observed since both gas and methane production was delayed with increasing NH 4 Cl addition.

On {{the basis of}} these results, a two-series digestion process with a thermophilic liquefaction of only thickened surplus sludge was proposed (hereafter called modified two-series digestion process). In the thermophilic liquefaction of the thickened surplus sludge, the maximum volumetric loading rate of VSS of 14 g·l- 1 ·d- 1 (HRT, 1. 8 d) could be achieved with respect to liquefaction of the sludge.

As a result, the maximum volumetric loading rate of VSS in the modified two-series digestion process was about twice as much as that in the conventional process.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to compare {{microbial}} populations and intermediate compounds in mesophilic and thermophilic anaerobic digestion of pineapple peel. Ethanol, acetic acid, propionic acid, and butyric acid were found as intermediates leading to methane formation during <b>mesophilic</b> <b>digestion.</b> Most of these compounds were found in thermophilic digester except propionic acid. The absence of propionic acid during thermophilic digestion of peel was supported by the following evidence: a) Microbial activity tests indicated the similarity of microbial populations in mesophilic and thermophilic digesters in their ability to utilize the different substrates as sole carbon source. Exceptionally, propionic acid utilizing bacteria was found only in mesophilic digester. b) In the presence of methanogenesis inhibitor using 2. 5 mM chloroform, 32 mM phenol, and 20 mM bromoethanesulfonate, acetic and propionic acids were accumulated in mesophilic digester. Only acetic acid was detected in thermophilic digester. c) By shifting operating temperature from 55 oC to 37 "C, the biochemical pathway changed in which propionic acid was one of the intermediates. No propionic acid was found during temperature shift from 37 oC to 55 oC. The results suggested that B-oxidation of butyric acid to acetic acid occurred in both mesophilic and thermophilic digestion. In addition, degradation of propionic acid was another route for acetic acid production at mesophilic temperature.

The study showed that 99.9 % of FS, 96.3 % of TC and 95 % of P. aeruginosa were reduced {{at the end of}} the treatment process. These findings revealed the potential of anaerobic digestion in the reduction of pathogenic bacteria from the biosolids. Wakelin et al.

The main pathogen-reducing factor during thermophilic anaerobic digestion is temperature in relation to time, while the competition among microorganisms for nutrients is the limiting factor that reduces pathogen amounts in anaerobic mesophilic treatment of biosolids (Smith et al. 2005). It can be noted that the thermophilic treatment is more efficient than the mesophilic because the biosolids have high contents of nutrients; therefore, the competition between microorganisms in the biosolids is weak. Carrington (1998) also elucidated that temperature is not the main factor in <b>mesophilic</b> anaerobic <b>digestion</b> processes at 35  °C, but this process produces fatty acids and other products that are lethal to many pathogenic bacteria.|$|R

40|$|Using a {{previously}} developed filter adsorption technique, the inactivation {{of a human}} rotavirus, a coxsackievirus B 5, and a bovine parvovirus was monitored during sludge treatment processes. During conventional anaerobic <b>mesophilic</b> <b>digestion</b> at 35 to 36 degrees C, only minor inactivation of all three viruses occurred. The k' values measured were 0. 314 log 10 unit/day for rotavirus, 0. 475 log 10 unit/day for coxsackievirus B 5, and 0. 944 log 10 unit/day for parvovirus. However, anaerobic thermophilic digestion at 54 to 56 degrees C led to rapid inactivation of rotavirus (k' greater than 8. 5 log 10 units/h) and of coxsackievirus B 5 (k' greater than 0. 93 log 10 unit/min). Similarly, aerobic thermophilic fermentation at 60 to 61 degrees C rapidly inactivated rotavirus (k' = 0. 75 log 10 unit/min) and coxsackievirus B 5 (k' greater than 1. 67 log 10 units/min). Infectivity of parvovirus, however, was only reduced by 0. 213 log 10 unit/h during anaerobic thermophilic digestion and by 0. 353 log 10 unit/h during aerobic thermophilic fermentation.

The corresponding organic loading rates (OLR) varied from 1. 6 to 20. 5 kg VS m(- 3) Biogas production rate could be tripled when the SRT was shortened from 30 to 12 days and more than doubled from 35 - to 15 -day SRT because of a concomitant increase in OLR. In general, higher biogas productivity was realized under thermophilic, but methane yields were comparable due to the higher methane content in the biogas under <b>mesophilic</b> <b>digestion.</b> The methane content in biogas fluctuated between 55 and 65 % and the methane yield ranged from 0. 314 to 0. 348 Nm(3) CH 4 kg VSadded- 1 day(- 1) for both thermophilic and <b>mesophilic</b> <b>digestion.</b> The VS-reduction at 12 - and 15 -day SRT ranged from 45 to 52 % {{and there was no}} accumulation of VFAs.

40|$|Anaerobic {{digestion}} is a {{biochemical process}} in which organic carbon is biodegraded in an oxygen free environment through a microbial consortium. Engineered biological systems used for resource recovery often utilize anaerobic digestion to treat anthropogenic organic wastes by reclaiming the carbon as energy (methane gas) and a soil amendment (biosolids). Small-scale, or household, semi-continuous anaerobic digesters {{have been used in}} developed and developing countries for many decades to produce biogas from human and livestock waste, which is used for heating, lighting, and cooking. This application has been shown {{to improve the quality of}} life of the user. Although there is great potential for small-scale semi-continuous anaerobic digestion to provide much needed resource recovery functions and quality of life improvements in future development, the manner in which these systems are operated could lead to unintended consequences on human health because human waste often contains resistant pathogens. This paradigm is best demonstrated by soil-transmitted helminths that are known to be highly resilient in <b>mesophilic</b> anaerobic <b>digestion</b> environments and endemic to many developing countries. The idea that soil-transmitted helminths survive <b>mesophilic</b> anaerobic <b>digestion</b> is exacerbated when the biosolids from the digesters are land applied as a soil-amendment because this process fits perfectly into the lifecycle of soil-transmitted helminths that need soil environments to develop into infective larva. This research was divided into three sections to investigate the fate of human pathogens during semi-continuous anaerobic digestion and investigate techniques to enhance their removal. The sections were: 1) an examination into the fate (embryonation, development, inactivation, destruction) of Ascaris suum ova during <b>mesophilic</b> semi-continuous anaerobic <b>digestion,</b> with an emphasis on increased inactivation, 2) an investigation into the performance (volatile solids (VS) removal, E. coli and Salmonella destruction, methane production) of semi-continuous mesophilic anaerobic digesters and the effect of variations to solids retention time (SRT) and feeding frequency, and 3) development and application of mathematical models for pathogen inactivation kinetics and typical semi-continuous reactor residence time distributions to predict the removal efficiency of Ascaris suum ova during semi-continuous anaerobic digestion under different operating conditions. Results of these studies showed that during semi-continuous <b>mesophilic</b> anaerobic <b>digestion</b> variations in feeding frequency did not impact the fate of Ascaris suum ova or Salmonella; however it was observed that better removal of E. coli and higher methane production was achieved at the longer feeding interval (weekly). Additional results indicated that embryonated ova were destroyed faster than unembryonated ova under the experimental conditions, which suggests a potential mechanism to enhance removal of this common pathogen. Since an increased feeding interval proved to be beneficial for digester performance our findings suggest that wastes containing Ascaris suum ova could be stored in an aerated environment, for a period of time that does not negatively impact resource recovery, to lengthen the time between feedings and promote ova embryonation and ensuing destruction during digestion. Modeling results indicate that under mesophilic conditions (35 oC) the ova of Ascaris suum could survive for 22 days and will not be completely removed from the effluent under typical feeding frequencies and average SRT were examined. Therefore, the use of anaerobic digestion as a resource recovery technology where soil-transmitted helminths proliferate should be applied with extra operational safeguards or be included as one step of several in a small-scale treatment train...|$|R

30|$|The factors, {{which might}} induce {{bacterial}} cell to be VBNC, are less nutrients, nucleotide, inactive cell membrane, size of bacterial cells and presence of antibiotics, which inhibit DNA synthesis without affecting other cellular metabolic activities (Gasoll et al. 1995; Joux and LeBaron 1997; Luna et al. 2002; Kim et al. 2009). Therefore, some authors recommended using molecular {{techniques such as}} PCR to detect the presence of VBNC bacteria after disinfection process (Straub et al. 1993; Choi et al. 1996). Chen et al. (2012) determined log reduction of Salmonella sp., E. coli and Shigella sp. during <b>mesophilic</b> anaerobic <b>digestion</b> of sludge by MPN and PCR. They found that log reduction determined by MPN was {{much higher than the}} data recorded by quantitative PCR. They explained their findings due to the presence of viable but non-culturable pathogen cells.|$|R
40|$|Biological {{pretreatment}} {{methods of}} waste-activated sludge (WAS) have recently received attention {{because of their}} efficiency and relatively low investment. The application of hydrolysis/acidification step before methanization in anaerobic digestion or the two-phase anaerobic digestion process constitutes one of these methods. Two phase (thermophilic acidification and <b>mesophilic</b> methanogenesis) anaerobic <b>digestion</b> of WAS was investigated and reported to perform better in terms of chemical oxygen demand (COD) solubilization, volatile solids destruction, gas production, and pathogen indicator reduction. The solids loading rates (SLR) used in these studies were significantly high (6. 5 - 28. 9 g volatile solids (VS) /L·day). It is well-known that high SLRs along with low retention times lead to higher acidification in two-phase systems. However, WAS from different wastewater treatment plants {{is likely to have}} different concentrations due to different process configurations and operational practices that lead to lower solids loading rates. Therefore, this study investigated the performance of thermophilic anaerobic preacidification of WAS prior to conventional <b>mesophilic</b> (methanogenic) anaerobic <b>digestion</b> at low SLRs (0. 98 - 3. 93 g VS/L·day). To this purpose, continuous anaerobic acidogenic reactors with no recycle were operated at two different HRT (or SRT) values of 2 and 4 days, and three different SLR values of 0. 98, 1. 97, and 3. 93 g VS/L·day...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Partially mixed {{semi-continuous}} reactor {{was used}} to examine the effect of organic loading rate (OLR) and hydraulic retention time (HRT) on the <b>mesophilic</b> anaerobic <b>digestion</b> of palm oil mill effluent (POME). The performance of the reactor was evaluated with emphasis on biodegradability of POME, methane gas (CH) 4 production rate and methane yield under different organic loading rates. The OLR of the anaerobic reactor increased stepwise from 1. 0 to 6. 0 g COD/L/day and HRT ranged from 13. 3 to 80. 0 days. The total chemical oxygen demand (TCOD) utilized was higher than 75 % and the CH percentage of the biogas was 62. 00 - 63. 00 % 4 for the OLRs studied. The methane yield coefficient (Y) was inversely proportional to the OLR due to the lossCH 4 of biomass with effluent. The experimental observations proved that partially mixed semi-continuous reactor could perform similar to complete-mixed reactors...|$|R
