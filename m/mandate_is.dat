2500|$|<b>Mandates</b> <b>were</b> not the {{creation}} of the League, and they could not in substance be altered by the League. The League's duties were confined to seeing that the specific and detailed terms of the <b>mandates</b> <b>were</b> in accordance with the decisions taken by the Allied and Associated Powers, and that in carrying out these mandates the Mandatory Powers should be under the supervision—not under the control—of the League. A <b>mandate</b> <b>was</b> a self-imposed limitation by the conquerors on the sovereignty which they exercised over the conquered territory.|$|R
25|$|The {{number and}} {{complexity}} of tasks have also increased. UNRWA's original mandate does not require resettling refugees or transferring responsibility to the Palestinian Authority.

25|$|During the French Mandate of Lebanon, {{there was}} a fairly large French {{minority}} and a tiny Italian minority.

5000|$|The <b>Mandate</b> <b>was</b> {{supposed}} {{to become a}} United Nations Trust Territory when League of Nations <b>Mandates</b> <b>were</b> transferred to the United Nations following the Second World War. The Prime Minister, Jan Smuts, objected to South West Africa coming under UN control and refused to allow the territory's transition to independence, instead seeking to make it South Africa's fifth province in 1946.|$|R
