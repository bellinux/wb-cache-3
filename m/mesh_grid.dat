For this gridshell structure the common kitchen sieve was the inspiration: its quadratic <b>mesh</b> <b>grid</b> can be transformed into any desired geometry by altering the <b>mesh</b> <b>grid</b> into a rhombus shape.

The glass panes lie directly on the grid beams, thereby merging the load-bearing structure and glass planes. This serves to eliminate the typically necessary secondary structure.|$|E

A novel partially reflective surface (PRS), consisting of square patches and <b>mesh</b> <b>grids</b> etched {{on both sides}} of dielectric substrate, is designed to operate at 10 GHz. In the proposed design, the sizes of square patches and <b>mesh</b> <b>grids</b> can be adjusted separately, which provides two methods to achieve tilted-beam: one is to vary the sizes of square patches to change the E-field phase distribution on the surface of PRS; the other is to change the dimensions of <b>mesh</b> <b>grids</b> to obtain tilted beam. Simulation results show that it can obtain a gain of 13. 7 dBi for a 23 ° beam tilting and 13. 4 dBi for a 27 ° beam tilting using the first and second method, respectively. This proposed antenna has the advantages of low profile, low cost and high gain, thus promising for fixed and tilted beam applications in mobile communication base stations and radars...|$|R

The squarecentimeter size of the materials, formed by nano-imprint lithography, allows reliable investigation of such materials by plane-wave techniques with minimal focusing. For both materials we observe strong polarization conversion (s- to p-polarization, and vice versa) in generalized ellipsometry measurements. We compared the spectra to analytical predictions using surface plasmon polariton (SPP) theory and find good agreement for the <b>meshed</b> <b>grid.</b> The spectra for the <b>meshed</b> <b>grid</b> are also well modeled using the rigorous coupled wave analysis (RCWA) technique. Simulated results for the more complicated fishnet layer showing qualitative agreement are also presented. We then probe the validity of describing the observations using homogenous parameters such as dichroism and birefringence, by examining the calculated reflection of nominally polarized incident light using simulated and measured Mueller matrices. The {{results show that the}} cross-polarization that we observe is primarily related to linear birefringence and dichroism, although circular effects are indeed present...|$|R

30|$|This paper {{describes}} new methodology in {{the current}} unbalance calculations in <b>meshed</b> <b>grids.</b> The <b>meshed</b> <b>grids,</b> mainly the transmission ones, consist of more parts connected together which are formed using different conductor types, phase sequence arrangements, tower constructions, and various number of lines on the same tower. Therefore several computational challenges arise {{in comparison with the}} widely discussed point-to-point configuration. The methodology divides the grid into a number of impedance matrices respecting all the self and mutual impedances among all conductors and all parallel lines. Another challenging issue for the lines impedance description is changing the number of shield wires along the line if the line is composed of several sections with different tower configurations. For the current unbalance calculation, shield wires must also be included in the algorithms, and matrices of various dimensions can be obtained. For the overall matrix description to be used, dimensions of all matrices in final equations must be equal, and therefore the virtual shield wires are created. To compare more conductor transposition cases with each other, the line loadings caused by voltage sources should be equal. This is necessary mainly in case of <b>meshed</b> <b>grids</b> where the supplying sources on different lines can have strong mutual couplings. This can be achieved by an appropriately designed optimization of the connected voltage sources.|$|R

The Norwegian context {{is the point of}} departure, but with clear references to relevant processes at the European level. At the EU level there is an overall drive towards establishing common infrastructure for electricity distribution across borders, but no concrete measures concerning a <b>meshed</b> <b>grid.</b> At the Norwegian level, there is currently no clear commitment towards a North Sea Grid development. Norwegian authorities' approach to off-shore infrastructure, and related processes in the EU and NSCOGI, has thus far been characterized by a wait-and-see attitude. The Norwegian approach is characterized by socio-economic perspectives, with limited attention towards possible long-term and cross-sectoral effects; such as innovation, and new industrial possibilities. Off-shore wind power development could constitute a 'proxy', and licensing procedures for such installations have been in place for some years, but without any economic incentives. Furthermore, interconnector projects between Norway, the UK and Germany could be considered as potential steppingstones towards a <b>meshed</b> <b>grid.</b> However, harmonization between different national licensing systems stands out as challenging, and there is limited experience of coordinating the licensing of crossborder projects.

The coarse <b>mesh</b> <b>grid</b> {{will be used for}} tsunami simulations of hypothetic earthquakes to construct the tsunami database. We located 21 source points (SP) along the trench axis, surrounding the real case of the 1977 Sumbawa earthquake, with three magnitudes (M 7. 0, 7. 5 and 8. 0) and four depths (0, 20, 40 and 60 km) set for tsunami simulations, in total 252 hypothetic cases. We located 38 coastal points (CP) and 38 forecast points (FP) as target points. We estimated maximum tsunami heights at CPs by applying Green’s law to those at FPs. Inverse refraction diagram was used to obtain tsunami arrival times at CPs. Three kinds of method to retrieve values from the database were applied in this study, namely interpolation methods for epicenter location, magnitude and depth; extrapolation methods for magnitude and depth; and maximum risk methods.

We find that the performance of our scheme scales well with the number of adopted CPU cores and GPUs, and also that our scheme is nicely parallelized on a multi-node system by adopting the multiple wave front scheme, and the performance scales well with the amount of the computational resources. As numerical tests to validate our scheme and to give a physical criterion for the angular resolution of our ray-tracing scheme, we perform several numerical simulations of the photo-ionization of neutral hydrogen gas by ionizing radiation sources without the "on-the-spot" approximation, in which the transfer of diffuse radiation by radiative recombination is incorporated in a self-consistent manner.

40|$|Abstract—Power flow {{controlling}} {{devices such}} as phase shifting transformers are increasingly important in the power system. They can increase reliability and can serve {{as an alternative to}} new investments in overhead lines, which are difficult {{due to a lack of}} public support. Furthermore, they are an important means of control for a transmission system operator in the liber-alized market. HVDC links recently also got renewed attention as they do not only provide the possibility to control the power flow, but can also be economically competitive to underground ac cables [1]. Especially with the emergence of VSC HVDC applications for bulk power transport, HVDC is a real alternative in the meshed power system. The usage of power flow controlling devices in a <b>meshed</b> <b>grid</b> causes the power to flow along alternative paths. However, these devices, and especially HVDC and VSC HVDC, incorporate significant losses. Furthermore, the shifting of power to other lines can cause losses in other parts of the grid. In this paper, the losses caused by the different power flow controlling elements are discussed, and afterwards their influence on the power system losses of a <b>meshed</b> <b>grid</b> are investigated. An important issue that is addressed in this paper is the use of multiple power flow controlling devices in one grid, consisting of multiple control areas.

Moreover, with addition of a second and forth order artificial dissipation, the second-order central scheme is adopted.
