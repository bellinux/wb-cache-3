In this study, sorption and degradation of the herbicide <b>metsulfuron-methyl</b> in a loamy silt soil were investigated by applying inverse modelling techniques to data sets from different experimental approaches under laboratory conditions at a temperature of 10 degreesC: first, batch-degradation studies and, second, column experiments with undisturbed soil cores (28 cm length x 21 cm diameter). The column experiments included leachate and soil profile analysis at two different run times. A sequential extraction method was applied in both study parts in order to determine different binding states of the test item within the soil. Data were modelled using ModelMaker and Hydrus- 1 D/ 2 D. <b>Metsulfuron-methyl</b> half-life in the batch-experiments (t(1 / 2) = 66 days) was shown to be about four times higher than in the micro-lysimeter studies (t(1 / 2) about 17 days). Kinetic sorption was found to be a significant process both in batch and column experiments. Applying the one-rate-two-site kinetic sorption model to the sequential extraction data, it was possible to associate the stronger, bonded fraction of <b>metsulfuron-methyl</b> with its kinetically sorbed fraction in the model. Although the columns exhibited strong significance of multi-domain flow (soil heterogeneity), the comparison between bromide and <b>metsulfuron-methyl</b> leaching and profile data showed clear evidence for kinetic sorption effects. The use of soil profile data had significant impact on parameter estimates concerning sorption and degradation. The simulated leaching of <b>metsulfuron-methyl</b> as it resulted from parameter estimation was shown to decrease when soil profile data were considered in the parameter estimation procedure. Moreover, it was shown that the significance of kinetic sorption can only be demonstrated by the additional use of soil profile data in parameter estimation.

40|$|BACKGROUND: <b>Metsulfuron-methyl</b> {{is widely}} used for {{controlling}} many annual grasses and broadleaf weeds in cereal crops. Nonetheless, increasing evidence has demonstrated that even extremely low levels of <b>metsulfuron-methyl</b> residues in soil can be toxic to subsequent crops or non-target organisms. The behavior of herbicides in soils is mostly related to their residual forms. The intent {{of the present study}} was to investigate the dynamics of extractable residues (ERs) and non-extractable residues (NERs) of 14 C-metsulfuron-methyl in twelve Chinese paddy soils and their relationships to soil properties. RESULTS: ERs decreased gradually after application, whereas NERs increased rapidly during the initial 28 days, and gradually decreased thereafter. ERs and NERs were respectively 10. 1 – 67. 9 % and 5. 6 – 28. 7 % of applied radioactivity in soils at 224 days after application. ERs correlated positively with soil pH and silt fractions, and negatively with microbial biomass carbon (MBC) and clay fractions, but the opposite was observed for NERs. CONCLUSION: Both ERs and NERs may be present in the soil at the time of planting following rice crops, and the risk of phytotoxic effects needs to be considered. Soil pH, MBC and clay/silt fractions were the main factors in affecting the amounts of both ERs and NERs of <b>metsulfuron-methyl</b> in the tested soils...|$|E

In this study, field experiments were conducted in 2014 and 2015 at two locations in Minas Gerais State, Brazil, to evaluate the tolerance of elephant grass pasture to acetolactate synthase inhibitor herbicides. The experimental pastures were treated at 1 × and 2 × the normal field-use rates (g ai ha- 1) with <b>metsulfuron-methyl</b> (7. 8 and 15. 6), chlorimuron-ethyl (15 and 30), halosulfuron (112. 5 and 225), ethoxysulfuron (150 and 300), and nicosulfuron (60 and 120).

40|$|In {{this thesis}} I have {{investigated}} the effects of pesticide exposure on the ecosystem level using various types of experimental ecosystems, i. e. microcosms. The direct effect of exposure to cyperemthrin, a pyretroid insecticide, was a rapid decrease of crustancean zooplankton in enclosures in a lake. In the exposed enclosures the biomass of algae, heterotrophic nanoflagellates, ciliates and bacteria increased, likely due to indirect effects of the exposure to cypermethrin. The effects of a sulfonylurea herbicide, <b>metsulfuron-methyl,</b> were investigated in two studies. The experiments showed that the macrophytes were negatively affected following exposure to concentrations of <b>metsulfuron-methyl</b> at which no negative effects were observed on the algal communities. Instead the algae proliferated in the exposed microcosms. The alterations of the primary producing community propagated to the zooplankton, and the species composition of the zooplankton community was altered, which thus was an indirect effect of exposure to <b>metsulfuron-methyl.</b> Hence, these studies show that both insecticides (i. e. cypermethrin) and herbicides (i. e. <b>metsulfuron-methyl),</b> through different mechanisms, can induce a competitive advantage for the algal communities {{in relation to the}} macrophytes. This suggests that exposure to pesticides may shift an aquatic ecosystem over to an algal dominated turbid state, i. e. cause alterations similar to changes induced by eutrophication. Furthermore, a study of the effects of a pesticide mixture on aquatic model ecosystems of different trophic status, indicated that the structure and trophic status of aquatic ecosystems is important for the final outcome of pesticide exposure.

Results show that 15 mm of simulated rain on either Day 1, 3 or 7 after herbicide application had no apparent effect on the dissipation of <b>metsulfuron-methyl</b> but natural rainfall that occurred later in the experiment leached it to the 50 – 100 mm soil layer. Glasshouse bioassays of soil samples collected from the field showed that between 75 % and 90 % of the applied herbicide had degraded by Day 56. Clopyralid stayed in the top 50 mm of soil during the experiment but by Day 56 less than 10 % of the applied herbicide remained...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{reports a}} field study {{undertaken}} {{to determine if}} the foliar application of herbicides fluroxypyr (150 mL 100 L- 1 a. i.) and <b>metsulfuron-methyl</b> (12 g 100 L- 1 a. i.) were capable of reducing the germination and viability of Chromolaena odorata (L.) R. M. King & H. Rob. (Siam weed) seeds at three different stages of maturity. After foliar application of fluroxypyr germination of mature seeds was reduced by 88 % and intermediate and immature seeds were reduced by 100 %, compared to the control. Fluroxypyr also reduced the viability of mature, intermediate and immature seeds by 79, 89 and 67 % respectively, compared to the control. <b>Metsulfuron-methyl</b> reduced germination of intermediate and immature seeds by 53 and 99 % respectively compared to the control. Viability was also reduced by 74 and 96 % respectively, compared to the control. Mature seeds were not affected by <b>metsulfuron-methyl</b> as germination and viability increased by 2 % and 1 % respectively, as compared to the control. These results show that these herbicides are capable of reducing the amount of viable seed entering the seed bank. However depending on the treatment and stage of seed development a percentage of seeds on the plants will remain viable and contribute to the seed bank. This information is of value to Siam weed eradication teams as plants are most easily located and subsequently treated at the time of flowering. Knowledge of the impact of control methods on seeds at various stages of development will help determine the most suitable chemical control option for a given situation...|$|E

40|$|AIM: This study {{evaluated}} {{the effect of}} the insecticide carbofuran and the herbicide <b>metsulfuron-methyl</b> on the abundance and diversity of benthic macroinvertebrates in a paddy ricefield. METHODS: To achieve this goal, two pesticide treatments [the insecticide carbofuran (IC) and the herbicide <b>metsulfuron-methyl</b> (HM) ] and a control (Co) treatment with no added pesticide were established in an experimental area of the Plant Science Department of the Federal University of Santa Maria. Soil samples were collected in triplicate from each treatment 30 days before and 1, 10, and 51 days after the pesticide application, for macrofauna identification. RESULTS: Among the 21 taxa identified, Trichoceridae was present only in Co, Hydroptilidae was recorded only in IC, and Corixidae in HM. In Co, the most abundant group was Annelida, while in IC and HM Diptera (Chironomidae) was dominant. Significant differences were observed between Co and IC, in the density of Odontoceridae (Control>IC) and Hydrophilidae (ControlHM) and Hirudinea (Control<HM). CONCLUSION: In spite of the possible negative effects of the pesticides on the benthic community, the assemblages recovered rapidly...|$|E
40|$|Abstract- Sulfonylureas are a {{relatively}} new class of herbicides characterised by several aspects that make them particularly interesting in comparison with other products. Two microbial consortia able to grow on two sulfonylureas, chlorsulfuron and <b>metsulfuron-methyl,</b> were selected in laboratory conditions using as inocula soil samples previously treated with sulfonylurea herbicides and from a laboratory enrichment culture obtained with chlorsulfuron. From these mixed cultures, a Pseudomonas fluorescens strain called B 2, was able to degrade in co-metabolic conditions with a rich medium in two weeks about 21 % of <b>metsulfuron-methyl</b> and 32 % of chlorsulfuron. For both herbicides, three microbial metabolites were detected and characterized, suggesting two different degradation path-ways in which the cleavage of sulfonylurea bridge takes place. Chemical hydrolysis, per-formed in acidic condition, {{in order to determine}} the chemical degradation pathways and to obtain pure standard for HPLC analyses, allowed to identify different compounds from those obtained with biodegradation; in fact the cleavage of triazinic ring happened. These results suggest that microbiological and chemical degradation can follow different path-ways...|$|E
40|$|The goal of {{the present}} work was to {{determine}} the lethal concentration (LC 50) (96 h) of clomazone, <b>metsulfuron-methyl,</b> and quinclorac, herbicides used in rice culture, for the silver catfish, Rhamdia quelen. Fingerlings were exposed to different concentrations of the herbicides. The LC 50 s were 7. 32 µL L- 1 for clomazone and 395 mg L- 1 for quinclorac. The LC 50 for <b>metsulfuron-methyl</b> was not obtained since all fingerlings survived even at 1200 mgL- 1. Probably only clomazone can lead to mortality among silver catfish reared in the rice culture system. O objetivo deste trabalho foi determinar a concentração letal (CL 50 96 h) de clomazone, metsulfuron-metil e quinclorac, herbicidas utilizados no cultivo de arroz, para alevinos de jundiá, Rhamdia quelen.

40|$|We {{tested the}} effects of the {{herbicide}} <b>metsulfuron-methyl</b> on growth of the submerged macrophyte Myriophyllum spicatum under laboratory conditions using different exposure scenarios. The exposures of each scenario were comparable in the concentration×time factor, viz., the same 21 -d time-weighted average (TWA) concentrations but variable in peak exposure concentrations (ranging from 0. 1 to 21000 ngaiL(- 1)) and exposure periods (1, 3, 7, 14 or 21 d). To study recovery potential of the exposed M. spicatum plants we continued the observation on shoot and root growth for another 21 d in herbicide-free medium so that the total observation period was 42 d. Non-destructive endpoints, length and number of new shoots and roots, were determined weekly from day 14 onwards. Destructive endpoints, dry-weight (DW) of main shoots, new shoots and new roots, were measured {{at the end of the}} experiment (t= 42 d). <b>Metsulfuron-methyl</b> exposure in particular inhibited new tissue formation but was not lethal to main shoots. On days 21 and 42 after start exposure, EC(10) /EC(50) values for new tissues expressed in terms of peak concentration (=measured concentration during exposure periods of different length) showed large differences between exposure scenarios in contrast to EC(10) /EC(50) values for days 21 and 42 expressed in terms of 21 -d and 42 -d TWA concentrations, respectively. At the end of the experiment (day 42), 42 -d TWA EC(x) values were remarkably similar between exposure scenarios, while a similar trend could already be observed on day 21 for 21 -d TWA EC(x) values. For the macrophyte M. spicatum and exposure to the herbicide <b>metsulfuron-methyl</b> the TWA approach seems to be appropriate to use in the risk assessment. However, the data from the toxicity experiment suggest that on day 21 also the absolute height of the pulse exposure played a (minor) role in the exposure - response relationships observe...|$|E
40|$|Acetolactate synthase (ALS) {{inhibiting}} herbicides {{are commonly}} used to eliminate weeds from mature turfgrasses. Field trials were conducted from 2004 - 2006, testing ALS herbicides for preemergence and early postemergence activity on newly seeded turfgrasses, using four species: ‘Riviera ’ bermuda, ‘Zenith ’ and ‘Companion ’ zoysia, ‘L- 93 ’ creeping bentgrass, and Poa annua L. Data collected were phytotoxicity and percent turf cover. Bermuda and zoysia herbicides were <b>metsulfuron-methyl</b> (42 g ha- 1), trifloxysulfuron (29 g ha- 1), flazasulfuron (53 g ha- 1), foramsulfuron (30 g ha- 1), bispyribac-sodium (112 g ha- 1), and rimsulfuron (35 g ha- 1). Treatments occurred the day of seeding and two-three weeks after seeding. Flazasulfuron, trifloxysulfuron and bispyribac-sodium caused significant damage in all treatments.

40|$|Herbicide {{control of}} rubber vine (Cryptostegia grandiflora R. Br.), a Weed of National Significance in Australia, can be {{effectively}} achieved in most situations using {{a range of}} chemicals and various techniques, including basal bark, cut stump, foliar and aerial applications. Nevertheless control in areas with poor access and with native vegetation still poses difficulties for some land managers, particularly doing so in a cost effective manner. The successful incorporation of low-volume high-concentration herbicide applications into control programs for several woody weeds in recent years prompted further testing of this technique for control of rubber vine. The efficacy of single rates of four herbicides plus a combination of two herbicides was compared against an untreated control.
