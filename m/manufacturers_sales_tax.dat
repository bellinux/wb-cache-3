5000|$|In September 1990 Chrétien {{seeing a}} chance to make a strong {{impression}} on public opinion after a shaky start as a leader reaped a major windfall after Mulroney introduced an unpopular Goods and Services Tax (GST), which Chrétien decided to vigorously oppose. Traditionally in Canada the government had levied a 13.5% <b>Manufacturers</b> <b>Sales</b> <b>Tax</b> (MST), which was paid by manufacturers, who passed on the cost of the tax to consumers in the form of higher prices. Since foreign manufacturers did not pay the MST, this placed Canadian companies at a competitive disadvantage in their home market, and to compensate the government had levied tariffs on manufactured imports to maintain a level playing field. When the free trade agreement with the United States came into effect in 1989, the government could no longer levy tariffs on American imports, which led to furious complaints from Canadian industry about having to compete with American companies who did not pay the MST. To save Canadian industry and the jobs of those Canadians employed in manufacturing from being destroyed by American competition, the Mulroney government decided in late 1989 to abolish the MST and replace it with the 7% GST, whose costs would be borne by consumers. On the proposed GST, Chrétien was torn between his belief that the GST was economically necessary vs. his desire to score political points by opposing a proposed tax that most Canadians hated, and as such, he was initially vague about where he stood about the GST. It was only in September 1990 after months of vacillation did Chrétien finally make up his mind to oppose the GST. Chrétiens decision to oppose the GST in 1990 was taken for reasons of political expediency rather than for principle, namely that Chrétien needed an issue to oppose the government on that would allow him to connect with the public; sources close to Chrétien were later to claim that he had wanted to support the GST bill, but had been forced by his caucus against his will to oppose it. At a Liberal event in the fall of 1990, Chrétien stated that if he became Prime Minister [...] "the Mulroney GST will disappear", going on to say: [...] "I am opposed to the GST. I have always been opposed to it. And I will be opposed to it, always". To capitalise on widespread public dislike on the proposed GST, Chrétien ordered the Liberal-dominated Senate to defeat the GST bill in late September 1990, leading Mulroney on September 27, 1990, to appoint 8 Conservative senators to give the Tories a majority using a never before used section of the Constitution Act, the so-called [...] "Deadlock Clause". At that point, Chrétien ordered the Liberal senators to filibuster the GST bill, reducing the Senate to scenes of chaos for the entire fall of 1990. On October 24, 1990, a poll revealed that the Liberals had fallen behind the New Democrats, which Chrétien admitted in an interview might {{have something to do with}} the scenes of obstructionist, often childish behavior by the Liberal senators. Finally on December 13, 1990, the Conservative senators changed the procedure rules in the Senate to break the Liberal filibuster and passed the GST bill. Public opinion polls taken in the fall of 1990 showed between 75 and 85 percent of Canadians were opposed to the GST bill, but at the same time, most people wanted an end of the [...] "circus" [...] in the Senate as the Liberal senators filibustered using such tactics such as [...] "...hooting, catcalls, shouting, blowing kazoos, interminable reading of petitions name by name and other delaying measures". Though the often undignified behavior of the filibustering Liberal senators was not popular with the Canadian public, the GST was even more unpopular with 75% of Canadians saying in a 1991 poll that they were hostile to the new tax, which worked to Chrétien benefit. In order to reinvigorate his leadership and reorganize his office which was in chaos under the leadership of Goldenberg, he hired an old friend and classmate, Jean Pelletier, as his chief of staff in December 1990.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a new dataset of fiscal consolidation for 17 OECD economies during 1978 - 2009. We focus on discretionary changes in taxes and government spending primarily {{motivated by a}} desire to reduce the budget deficit and not by a response to prospective economic conditions. To identify the motivation and budgetary impact of the fiscal policy changes, we examine contemporaneous policy documents, including Budgets, Budget Speeches, central bank reports, Convergence and Stability Programs submitted by the authorities to the European Commission, and IMF and OECD reports. The resulting series can be used to estimate the macroeconomic effects of fiscal consolidation.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{information on}} <b>manufacturers</b> <b>sales</b> <b>taxes</b> in four African countries — Kenya, Tanzania, Zambia and Ghana. Because {{there are no}} retail <b>sales</b> <b>taxes</b> in tropical Africa, a comparison is made with the retail <b>sales</b> <b>taxes</b> of two relatively small non-African countries — Barbados and Iceland. Topics discussed in this paper include {{the coverage of the}} taxes, the rates, the revenue importance, the numbers of registered firms, the administration and operation of the taxes, inspection and audit programmes and the problem of delinquency. Finally, a number of merits and criticisms of these taxes are pointed out. A number of general conclusions are suggested from the inspection of these six <b>sales</b> <b>taxes.</b> It is found that in a developing country a <b>sales</b> <b>tax</b> can be a very significant revenue source and <b>sales</b> <b>taxes</b> at the manufacturing level can function extremely well. A general problem has been the failure to develop adequate audit programmes, and also the need for simplicity in tax structure and operation has often been overlooked. There are serious dangers in placing <b>sales</b> <b>tax</b> administration under the jurisdiction of customs and excise departments because the personnel in these departments generally lack the accounting knowledge necessary to effectively administer a <b>sales</b> <b>tax.</b> Finally, it appears that the exemption of basic foods from <b>sales</b> <b>tax</b> has effectively lessened possible complaints against the taxes on equity grounds...|$|R
2500|$|The {{visibility}} of the GST {{proved to be}} very unpopular. The GST was created to help eliminate the ever-growing deficit and to replace the hidden <b>Manufacturer's</b> <b>sales</b> <b>tax,</b> which Mulroney argued was hurting business. Mulroney's usage of a rare Constitutional clause to push the tax through, prices not falling very much with the MST removed, and the [...] "in your face" [...] nature of the tax infuriated politicians and the public. The succeeding Liberal government of Jean Chrétien campaigned in 1993 on a promise to eliminate the GST (as per the Red Book), but ultimately backed away from that promise. This prompted two of their members Sheila Copps and John Nunziata to resign or be expelled in protest. Mulroney's supporters argue that the GST helped the subsequent government eliminate the deficit, and that the visible nature of the tax kept politicians more accountable.|$|R
40|$|In a <b>manufacturer's</b> <b>sales</b> <b>tax</b> refund suit, {{the trial}} court {{determined}} {{that most of the}} transactions at issue were not taxable. The manufacturer sold telephone switching equipment to a telephone company, licensed a switch-specific program for each switch, and licensed three prewritten software programs. The trial court ruled that the prewritten programs were taxable and that the switch-specific programs were not. (Superior Court of Los Angeles County, No. BC 341568, Terry A. Green, Judge.) The Court of Appeal affirmed the portion of the judgment that awarded the manufacturer a refund of the <b>sales</b> <b>tax</b> it had paid for licensing switch-specific programs, reversed the denial of the manufacturer's claim for a refund of the <b>sales</b> <b>tax</b> it had paid for licensing prewritten programs, and remanded with directions to enter judgment in favor of the manufacturer with regard to the prewritten programs. The court held that the licensing of a switch-specific program was a valid license of a copyrighted interest containing patented processes (Rev. & Tax. Code, § § 6011, subd. (c) (10) (D), 6012, subd.
