5|$|A {{trial in}} Western Australia showed Banksia marginata to be <b>mildly</b> {{sensitive}} to Phytophthora cinnamomi dieback. At Brisbane Ranges National Park west of Melbourne, which was invaded by Phytophthora cinnamomi in the 1970s, Banksia marginata (along with such species as Grevillea steiglitziana) {{was part of}} a secondary regrowth of understory species after more resistant shrubs such as grasses and sedges had grown back.|$|E
5|$|Harry Connick, Jr. as Dean McCoppin, a beatnik {{artist and}} junkyard owner. Bird felt it {{appropriate}} {{to make the}} character {{a member of the}} beat generation, as they were viewed as <b>mildly</b> threatening to small-town values during that time. An outsider himself, he is among the first to recognize the Giant as no threat.|$|E
5|$|Soluble {{dysprosium}} salts, such as dysprosium chloride and dysprosium nitrate, are <b>mildly</b> toxic when ingested. Based on {{the toxicity}} of dysprosium chloride to mice, {{it is estimated}} that the ingestion of 500grams or more could be fatal to a human. The insoluble salts, however, are non-toxic.|$|E
5|$|Tellurium and {{tellurium}} compounds {{are considered}} to be <b>mildly</b> toxic and need to be handled with care, although acute poisoning is rare. Tellurium poisoning is particularly difficult to treat as many chelation agents used in the treatment of metal poisoning will increase the toxicity of tellurium. Tellurium is not reported to be carcinogenic.|$|E
5|$|The Devotees was {{published}} by Heinemann in December1900. Like Rupert Armstrong, the plot of The Devotees depicts a <b>mildly</b> incestuous love: {{a young man and}} girl, raised together since childhood, devote themselves for decades to his drug-addicted mother before they marry. The reviews were mostly unkind.|$|E
5|$|The female is <b>mildly</b> {{aggressive}} to her suitors during estrus, {{and will}} often lunge at males, usually {{after a long}} period of being approached and followed. Vocalizations during mating include a whistling sound, most commonly by the female, usually during June and August, coinciding with female estrus. Other vocalizations recorded during estrus include chittering and growling. The testosterone levels of the males are seasonal, with peaks coinciding with female estrogen peaks.|$|E
5|$|This episode saw the {{introduction}} of the redesigned Romulans, with prosthetic forehead pieces designed by makeup supervisor Michael Westmore, and the first appearance of the Romulan Warbird which was designer Andrew Probert's final work for the Star Trek franchise. The episode was <b>mildly</b> received by critics who viewed it {{after the end of the}} season, who criticised the two-plot nature of the episode and the general lack of excitement.|$|E
5|$|Water-soluble {{compounds}} of yttrium {{are considered}} <b>mildly</b> toxic, while its insoluble compounds are non-toxic. In experiments on animals, yttrium {{and its compounds}} caused lung and liver damage, though toxicity varies with different yttrium compounds. In rats, inhalation of yttrium citrate caused pulmonary edema and dyspnea, while inhalation of yttrium chloride caused liver edema, pleural effusions, and pulmonary hyperemia.|$|E
5|$|A {{laboratory}} diagnosis is usually made based on recovery of poliovirus from a stool sample or a swab of the pharynx. Antibodies to poliovirus can be diagnostic, and are generally {{detected in the}} blood of infected patients early in the course of infection. Analysis of the patient's cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), which is collected by a lumbar puncture ("spinal tap"), reveals an increased number of white blood cells (primarily lymphocytes) and a <b>mildly</b> elevated protein level. Detection of virus in the CSF is diagnostic of paralytic polio, but rarely occurs.|$|E
5|$|A {{shipbuilding}} boom in {{the early}} part of the 20th century became massive during World War I, making Seattle somewhat of a company town; the subsequent retrenchment led to the Seattle General Strike of 1919, the first general strike in the country. A 1912 city development plan by Virgil Bogue went largely unused. Seattle was <b>mildly</b> prosperous in the 1920s but was particularly hard hit in the Great Depression, experiencing some of the country's harshest labor strife in that era. Violence during the Maritime Strike of 1934 cost Seattle much of its maritime traffic, which was rerouted to the Port of Los Angeles.|$|E
5|$|Although {{atherosclerosis}} {{occurs to}} a certain degree in all people, people with FH may develop accelerated atherosclerosis due to the excess level of LDL. The degree of atherosclerosis approximately depends on the number of LDL receptors still expressed and the functionality of these receptors. In many heterozygous forms of FH, the receptor function is only <b>mildly</b> impaired, and LDL levels will remain relatively low. In the more serious homozygous forms, the receptor is not expressed at all.|$|E
5|$|Andula is {{a working-class}} young woman {{living in a}} fading Czech factory town, where, due to an {{oversight}} in central state planning, women outnumber men 16–1. The film opens with an intimate scene between Andula and her fellow shoe-factory-worker friend as they lie in bed in their dormitory discussing the ring given to Andula by her boyfriend Tonda and gossiping about her <b>mildly</b> flirtatious encounter with a forest ranger, which is shown in flashback.|$|E
5|$|Anecdotal {{evidence}} suggests that the plant may be <b>mildly</b> toxic. The noxious odours have been associated with nausea and headaches, as well as with contact dermatitis reported in both humans and sheep, who also developed weakness and paralysis. It contains a quinone irritant, 2,6-dimethoxybenzoquinone, as well as active quassinoids (ailanthone itself being one) which may account for these effects, but they have, however, proved difficult or impossible to reproduce in humans and goats. In one trial a tincture from the blossom and foliage caused nausea, vomiting and muscular relaxation.|$|E
5|$|At room temperature, it is a {{colourless}} gas, {{like all}} of the hydrogen halides except hydrogen fluoride, since hydrogen cannot form strong hydrogen bonds to the large and only <b>mildly</b> electronegative iodine atom. It melts at −51.0°C and boils at −35.1°C. It is an endothermic compound that can exothermically dissociate at room temperature, although the process is very slow unless a catalyst is present: the reaction between hydrogen and iodine at room temperature to give hydrogen iodide does not proceed to completion. The H–I bond dissociation energy is likewise {{the smallest of the}} hydrogen halides, at 295kJ/mol.|$|E
5|$|Benzoyl {{peroxide}} (BPO) is a first-line {{treatment for}} mild and moderate acne {{due to its}} effectiveness and mild side-effects (mainly skin irritation). In the skin follicle, benzoyl peroxide kills P. acnes by oxidizing its proteins through the formation of oxygen free radicals and benzoic acid. These free radicals are thought {{to interfere with the}} bacterium's metabolism and ability to make proteins. Additionally, benzoyl peroxide is <b>mildly</b> effective at breaking down comedones and inhibiting inflammation. Benzoyl peroxide may be paired with a topical antibiotic or retinoid such as benzoyl peroxide/clindamycin and benzoyl peroxide/adapalene, respectively.|$|E
5|$|Dysprosium {{was first}} {{identified}} in 1886 by Paul Émile Lecoq de Boisbaudran, {{but it was}} not isolated in pure form until the development of ion exchange techniques in the 1950s. Dysprosium has relatively few applications where it cannot be replaced by other chemical elements. It is used for its high thermal neutron absorption cross-section in making control rods in nuclear reactors, for its high magnetic susceptibility in data storage applications, and as a component of Terfenol-D (a magnetostrictive material). Soluble dysprosium salts are <b>mildly</b> toxic, while the insoluble salts are considered non-toxic.|$|E
5|$|His {{enthusiasm for}} {{teaching}} at the university ebbed in his final years there. He was also perturbed {{by an increase in}} religious enthusiasm on campus and a temperance movement, which he <b>mildly</b> protested. Tucker zealously defended higher salaries for more tenured professors, and he was enraged when the University reduced his annual salary from $1500 to $1000. Having produced documentation proving that Jefferson had intended his salary be guaranteed for life, he convinced the university to reinstate his original salary.|$|E
5|$|In biology, borates {{have low}} {{toxicity}} in mammals (similar to table salt), but are more toxic to arthropods {{and are used}} as insecticides. Boric acid is <b>mildly</b> antimicrobial, and several natural boron-containing organic antibiotics are known. Boron compounds play a strengthening role in the cell walls of all plants, making boron a necessary plant nutrient. There is no consensus on whether boron is an essential nutrient for mammals, including humans, although {{there is some evidence}} it supports bone health.|$|E
5|$|In the 5-planet {{solution}} for the 55 Cancri system, the orbit of 55 Cancri c is <b>mildly</b> eccentric: at apoastron the planet is about 19% further from the star than it is at periastron. It is located closer to 55 Cancri A than Mercury is to our sun, though it has a longer orbital period than the hot Jupiters. The planet is located close to a 3:1 resonance with the inner planet 55 Cancri b; however, simulations indicate that the two planets are not actually in this resonance.|$|E
5|$|India's {{geography}} and geology are climatically pivotal: the Thar Desert {{in the northwest}} and the Himalayas in the north work in tandem to effect a culturally and economically important monsoonal regime. As Earth's highest and most massive mountain range, the Himalayas bar the influx of frigid katabatic winds from the icy Tibetan Plateau and northerly Central Asia. Most of North India is thus kept warm or is only <b>mildly</b> chilly or cold during winter; the same thermal dam keeps most regions in India hot in summer.|$|E
5|$|Lombard {{was eager}} to win an Academy Award, and {{selected}} her next project—from several possible scripts—with the expectation that it would bring her the trophy. Vigil in the Night (1940), directed by George Stevens, featured Lombard as a nurse who faces a series of personal difficulties. Although the performance was praised, she did not get her nomination, as the sombre mood of the picture turned audiences away and box-office returns were poor. Despite the realization that she was best suited to comedies, Lombard completed one more drama: They Knew What They Wanted (1940), co-starring Charles Laughton, which was <b>mildly</b> successful.|$|E
5|$|Mario Bros. {{was only}} {{modestly}} successful in Japanese arcades. The arcade cabinets have since become <b>mildly</b> rare. To date in Japan, the NES version of Mario Bros. {{has sold more}} than 1.63 million copies, and the Famicom Mini re-release of the NES version {{has sold more than}} 90,000 copies. Despite being released during the North American video game crash of 1983, the arcade game (as well as the industry) was not affected. Video game author Dave Ellis considers it one of the more memorable classic games.|$|E
5|$|Other {{scholars}} {{have identified the}} text's tone as satirical and <b>mildly</b> obscene, locating it among a movement of pamphlets influenced by a counter-trend promoting greater sympathy for prostitution. Linda Dowling interprets the pamphlet less a broadside against sodomites, and more as evidence of a strand in rhetoric that valorized Britain's martial past and saw {{lack of respect for}} it as a precondition for vice. Ian Bell considers the causality of this relationship between moral collapse and vice, characterizing the book as part of strand that saw vice as a product, not a cause, of a fundamental collapse in morality in Augustan London.|$|E
5|$|Significant {{amounts of}} iron {{occur in the}} iron sulfide mineral pyrite (FeS2), but it is {{difficult}} to extract iron from it and it is therefore not used. In fact, iron is so common that production generally focuses only on ores with very high quantities of it. During weathering, iron tends to leach from sulfide deposits as the sulfate and from silicate deposits as the bicarbonate. Both of these are oxidized in aqueous solution and precipitate in even <b>mildly</b> elevated pH as iron(III) oxide.|$|E
5|$|Similarly to {{the other}} rare-earth metals, {{lutetium}} has no known biological role, but it is found even in humans, concentrating in bones, {{and to a lesser}} extent in the liver and kidneys. Lutetium salts are known to occur together with other lanthanide salts in nature; the element is the least abundant in the human body of all lanthanides. Human diets have not been monitored for lutetium content, so it is not known how much the average human takes in, but estimations show the amount is only about several micrograms per year, all coming from tiny amounts taken by plants. Soluble lutetium salts are <b>mildly</b> toxic, but insoluble ones are not.|$|E
5|$|Somewhere premiered at the 67th Venice International Film Festival {{where it}} {{received}} the Golden Lion {{award for best}} picture. Critical opinion was <b>mildly</b> positive. Reviewers praised the patience of the film's visual style and its empathy {{for a handful of}} characters, but some found Somewhere to be too repetitive of themes in Coppola's previous work, or did not sympathize with the protagonist because of his relative success. It was released to theaters in the United Kingdom and Ireland on December 10, 2010, and in the United States on December 22, 2010.|$|E
5|$|Tellurium is a {{chemical}} element with symbolTe and atomic number52. It is a brittle, <b>mildly</b> toxic, rare, silver-white metalloid. Tellurium is chemically related to selenium and sulfur. It is occasionally found in native form as elemental crystals. Tellurium {{is far more}} common in the universe as a whole than on Earth. Its extreme rarity in the Earth's crust, comparable to that of platinum, is due partly to its high atomic number, but also to its formation of a volatile hydride which caused it to be lost to space as a gas during the hot nebular formation of the planet.|$|E
5|$|The band's {{previous}} album, 1989's Mother's Milk {{would become}} the band's second album to enter in the Billboard 200, peaking at number 52 {{and at the time}} the biggest of their career. Although the record was <b>mildly</b> successful, production was weighed down by producer Michael Beinhorn. He convinced Frusciante to play with an overall heavier tone, and instructed Kiedis to write lyrics that would be more radio viable, thus causing the band to feel restricted creatively.|$|E
5|$|The {{species is}} found in Asia, Europe, and North America, where it grows {{on the ground in}} {{deciduous}} or mixed woods, usually in association with pine trees. It is closely related, and physically similar, to the more common Albatrellus ovinus, from which it may be distinguished macroscopically by differences in the color when bruised, and microscopically by the amyloid (staining bluish-black to black with Melzer's reagent) walls of the spores. The fruit bodies of A.subrubescens contain scutigeral, a bioactive chemical that has antibiotic activity. A.subrubescens mushrooms are <b>mildly</b> poisonous, and consuming them will result in a short-term gastrointestinal illness.|$|E
5|$|There were {{repeated}} attempts by some Polish academics and philosophers, many {{related to the}} prewar Lwów–Warsaw school – such as Leszek Kołakowski, Stanisław Ossowski and Adam Schaff – to develop a specific form of Polish Marxism. Their attempts to create a bridge between Poland's history and Marxist ideology were <b>mildly</b> successful, although stifled due to the regime's unwillingness to risk {{the wrath of the}} Soviet Union for deviating too far from the Soviet party line. Kołakowski, a leading revisionist, was verbally attacked by Gomułka in 1957, expelled from the party in 1966 and in 1968 had to emigrate.|$|E
5|$|When {{projects}} are agreed upon with an island community, local rituals often {{coincide with the}} start of the project, particularly in the Pacific Islands, where a common custom involves drinking kava, a <b>mildly</b> narcotic drink made from the ground-up root of a pepper plant. The ritual is hundreds of years old, and has been described by the Seacology staff as being relaxing, especially because of the friendly environment. Seacology staff often dress in local attire. The villagers perform dances, and the staff are invited to join in, often to the amusement of the villagers.|$|E
5|$|A Little More Personal (Raw) {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from music critics, who praised Lohan's ambition, despite considering it a weak album. The album charted <b>mildly</b> compared to Speak, debuting (and also peaking) at number twenty on the US Billboard 200 chart with first week sales of 82,000 copies, and also peaking {{at the same}} position on the Digital Albums chart. However, A Little More Personal (Raw) was certified Gold in the United States by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for sales of over 500,000 copies. It was also certified Gold in Taiwan. Lohan promoted the album with a few television appearances, including at MTV's Total Request Live, The Ellen Show and the 2005 American Music Awards.|$|E
5|$|After a <b>mildly</b> {{successful}} {{period in}} the 1960s, where they stood among the top contenders, Southern European teams started to lose influence in the European stage during the 1970s, as Dutch and German teams appeared stronger. In the 1971–72 European Cup, Benfica lost in the semi-finals to a Johan Cruyff-led Ajax {{on their way to}} a second consecutive win. Benfica reached the quarter-finals of the 1974–75 European Cup Winners' Cup, before being eliminated by another Dutch team, PSV Eindhoven. Over the course of the late 1970s, as historic players like Eusébio and Simões retired, Benfica could not maintain the same performance of the previous decade, and only secured two European Cup quarter-final presences. In 1975–76, they lost 5–1 to the holders Bayern Munich, and in 1977–78, they were knocked out by the defending champions Liverpool with a 6–2 aggregate score.|$|E
5|$|At room temperature, {{hydrogen}} bromide is a colourless gas, {{like all the}} hydrogen halides apart from hydrogen fluoride, since hydrogen cannot form strong hydrogen bonds to the large and only <b>mildly</b> electronegative bromine atom; however, weak hydrogen bonding is present in solid crystalline {{hydrogen bromide}} at low temperatures, similar to the hydrogen fluoride structure, before disorder begins to prevail as the temperature is raised. Aqueous hydrogen bromide is known as hydrobromic acid, which is a strong acid (pKa = −9) because the hydrogen bonds to bromine are too weak to inhibit dissociation. The HBr/H2O system also involves many hydrates HBr·nH2O for n = 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6, which are essentially salts of bromine anions and hydronium cations. Hydrobromic acid forms an azeotrope with boiling point 124.3°C at 47.63g HBr per 100g solution; thus hydrobromic acid cannot be concentrated beyond this point by distillation.|$|E
5|$|Caesium {{compounds}} {{are rarely}} encountered by most people, but most caesium compounds are <b>mildly</b> toxic. Like rubidium, caesium tends to substitute potassium in the body, but is significantly larger {{and is therefore}} a poorer substitute. Excess caesium can lead to hypokalemia, arrythmia, and acute cardiac arrest, but such amounts would not ordinarily be encountered in natural sources. As such, caesium {{is not a major}} chemical environmental pollutant. The median lethal dose (LD50) value for caesium chloride in mice is 2.3g per kilogram, which is comparable to the LD50 values of potassium chloride and sodium chloride. Caesium chloride has been promoted as an alternative cancer therapy, but has been linked to the deaths of over 50 patients, on whom it was used as part of a scientifically unvalidated cancer treatment.|$|E
