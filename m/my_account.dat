25|$|Why do {{you retire}} from me? I can easily follow you anywhere, and be where you are.

2500|$|In October 1949, Ivinskaya {{was arrested}} as [...] "an {{accomplice}} to the spy" [...] and in July 1950 was sentenced by the Special Council of the NKVD {{to five years}} in the Gulag. That was seen as an attempt to press Pasternak to give up writings critical of the Soviet system.

"Neither your superiority, nor {{the threat}} that the {{spilling}} of human blood should be laid to <b>my</b> <b>account,</b> could prevent my shewing to you, to the last moment, what I could do for my sovereign, whom I acknowledge to be no other than the Batavian people and its representatives, when your prince's and the Orange flags have obtained their end. The traitors whom I commanded refused to fight; and nothing remains {{to me and my}} brave officers but vain rage and the dreadful reflection of our present situation: I therefore deliver over to you the fleet which I commanded. From this moment it is your obligation to provide for the safety of my officers and the few brave men who are on-board the Batavian ships, as I declare myself and my officers prisoners of war, and remain to be considered as such." ...|$|E

I {{went to see}} {{her last}} Sunday, the 23rd May, and found her in a sad state, {{suffering}} from pains in her toes and the soles of her feet until the tears came into her eyes. I went away because I saw that she refrained from crying out on <b>my</b> <b>account.</b> I thought {{she was in a}} bad way. A consultation was held by her three physicians, the result of which was that they determined to bleed her in the feet. They had some difficulty in persuading her to submit to it, because the pain in her feet was so great that she uttered the most piercing screams if the bedclothes only rubbed against them. The bleeding, however, succeeded, and she was in some degree relieved. It was the gout in both feet ...|$|E

2500|$|Urkesh was {{an ally of}} the Akkadian Empire {{through what}} is {{believed}} to have been a dynastic marriage tradition. Tar'am-Agade the daughter of the Akkadian king, Naram-Sin, {{is believed to have}} been married to the king of Urkesh. During the early second millennium BC the city passed into the hands of the rulers of Mari, a city a few hundred miles to the south. The king of Urkesh became a vassal (and apparently an appointed puppet) of Mari. The people of Urkesh evidently resented this, as the royal archives at Mari provide evidence of their strong resistance; in one letter, the king of Mari tells his Urkesh counterpart that [...] "I did not know that the sons of your city hate you on <b>my</b> <b>account.</b> But you are mine, even if the city of Urkesh is not." [...] In the middle of the millennium, Tell Mozan was the location of a Mitanni religious site. The city appears to have been largely abandoned circa 1350 BC, although the reason for this is unknown to archaeologists at this time.|$|E
