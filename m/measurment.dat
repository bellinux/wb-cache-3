40|$|The {{slipping}} {{of gravel}} {{in the region}} of Potoška planina scree is a continuous process. According to geologists' analysis and estimates this process has an impact on the amount of gravel material in the river bed under the funnel at the foothills of the mountain scree. For the purpose of monitoring the shape of the scree surface and evaluating the quantity of the material over several years a geodetic network was established. It was meant to ensure a uniform geodetic datum, which would serve in different geodetic terms to establish coordinates for control points and check points, evaluating with modern multi ladling technologies of spatial data. First <b>measurment's</b> goal was to ensure the coordinate base at the scree, the second <b>measurment's</b> goal was {{to find out if the}} network is stable and suitable for the use in the future term <b>measurments.</b> The achieved observations of classical <b>measurments</b> have been adequatly processed and statistically analysed. With seperate adjustements of observations we got horizontal and hight coordinates of geodetic network. The movements of points of geodetic network were defined with comparing the size of movements with the three fold value of the accuracy of defining these movements. It was established that the points in the lower part of the scree moved on average for 5, 4 cm horizontally and 2. 2 cm in height. The conclusion provides comments on the results and the assesment whether the use of geodetic networks would be appropriate in the future...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. In {{this paper}} {{mathematical}} methods for prediction of uncertain structural responses {{with the aid}} of fuzzy time series are presented. Uncertain <b>measurments</b> of structural loads and responses respectively at equally spaced discrete time points are modeled as fuzzy variables. Hence uncertain <b>measurments</b> over time are considered as time series with fuzzy data. The fuzzy variables are processed on the basis of generally applicable numerical methods for descriptive analysis as well as for stochastic analysis. Algorithms of stochastic analysis are used to forecast fuzzy time series. At this the new fuzzy-ARMA-process is introduced. Forecasts of fuzzy time series provides informationen about future structural responses. The algorithm of analysis and forecast of fuzzy time series are presented in detail and demonstrated by way of numerical examples...|$|R

40|$|For {{measuring}} the drag against a moving body in water, a long water pool or tank is generally used. But in this case, {{the material to}} be tested must be moved at high speed in the weter.
