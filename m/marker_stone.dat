25|$|The stone {{appears in}} several {{chapters}} of Edward Rutherfurd's novel, London (1997). In the second chapter {{we see it}} as the <b>marker</b> <b>stone</b> for all the roads in Roman Londinium, and also sitting beside the wall of the Governor's Palace as mentioned above as a hypothesis of its use or origin. It is seen again in the ninth chapter where the main family unit of the novel bring in the character of the foundling who is found propped up against it. The stone {{is one of the many}} central focus points in the novel that the author uses to tie the different time periods together.|$|E
25|$|The old {{boundary}} between Brighton and Hove is most clearly {{seen on the}} seafront, where the King Edward Peace Statue (1912) straddles the border, and in a twitten called Boundary Passage which runs northwards from Western Road to Montpelier Road. There is a Grade II-listed parish boundary <b>marker</b> <b>stone</b> in this passageway. Between Western Road and the seafront, the boundary runs up Little Western Street (pavement on eastern side, in Brighton), {{but it is not}} visible. Northwards from Western Road, it runs to the west of Norfolk Road, Norfolk Terrace, Windlesham Road and Windlesham Gardens in the Montpelier area, then along the south side of Davigdor Road to Seven Dials. From there it runs along the west side of Dyke Road as far as Withdean Road in Withdean, at which point it crosses Dyke Road so that the section north of that is part of Hove parish. The boundary continues to follow Dyke Road towards Devil's Dyke on the South Downs.|$|E

25|$|A {{tradition}} emerged of marking important graves, particularly ecclesiastical ones. Such markers included slabs that laid flat {{over the}} grave, and large crosses that stood upright, {{a number of}} which still survive in place.

2500|$|The {{use of the}} fifty-six Aubrey {{holes at}} Stonehenge as a system for the neolithic Britons to predict eclipses, using them in the daily {{positioning}} of <b>marker</b> <b>stones</b> as proposed in his 1977 book On Stonehenge.

50|$|The {{original}} {{border between}} Shropshire and Staffordshire was Goldstone Brook, which formed {{the boundary between}} the manors of Cheswardine and Goldstone, Cheswardine originally being in Staffordshire. Edward Hayward of Goldstone made an interesting reference to some old manorial <b>marker</b> <b>stones</b> that demarcated Goldstone from Cheswardine, in an entry in his Journal dated 21 May 1805, as follows: This day Mr Pierpoint of Ellerton told me that the proper old course of the Goldstone Brook is by the Gate going into Sowdley Lane which is also the Boundary of Goldstone Manor. This he heard the late Mr E. Pegg of Goldstone declare when he refused to give one of the large stones there to ---? Jones the Miller. It is perhaps possible that these <b>marker</b> <b>stones</b> may have more than significance as a part of Goldstone and Cheswardine's manorial history, but also that of the counties of Shropshire and Staffordshire, since they could also have been boundary stones marking the original border between Shropshire and Staffordshire.|$|R
