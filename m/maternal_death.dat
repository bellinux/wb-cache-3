5|$|Non-reproductive health {{remains an}} {{important}} predictor of maternal health. In the United States, the {{leading causes of}} <b>maternal</b> <b>death</b> are cardiovascular disease (15% of deaths), endocrine, respiratory and gastrointestinal disorders, infection, hemorrhage and hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (Gronowski and Schindler, Table II).|$|E
5|$|Baby {{flying foxes}} usually come into care {{after having been}} {{separated}} from their mothers. Babies are often orphaned during {{four to six weeks}} of age, when they inadvertently fall off their mothers during flight. When they are older, orphans usually come into care because of <b>maternal</b> <b>death</b> from power line electrocution or barbed wire entanglement. A rare, but apparent natural, occurrence of mass abandonment can lead to the rescue of hundreds of babies at one time. The latter most recently occurred in November 2008 at the Canungra bat camp in South East Queensland, when Wildcare Australia, working closely with the EPA and regional bat care groups, rescued and rehabilitated over 300 baby grey-headed flying foxes. Most babies are in a dehydrated and distressed state by the time they are rescued, and some are infested with maggots if found sick or injured. A young flying fox must be fed every four hours, and then as it develops it is introduced to blossoms and fruit. When the young flying fox is fully weaned around 10 to 12 weeks of age, it goes into a crèche for rehabilitation and eventual release.|$|E
5|$|Globally, women's {{access to}} health care remains a challenge, both in {{developing}} and developed countries. In the United States, before the Affordable Health Care Act came into effect, 25% of women of child bearing age lacked health insurance. In the absence of adequate insurance, women are likely to avoid important steps to self care such as routine physical examination, screening and prevention testing, and prenatal care. The situation is aggravated by the fact that women living below the poverty line are at greater risk of unplanned pregnancy, unplanned delivery and elective abortion. Added to the financial burden in this group are poor educational achievement, lack of transportation, inflexible work schedules and difficulty obtaining child care, all of which function to create barriers to accessing health care. These problems are much worse in developing countries. Under 50% of childbirths in these countries are assisted by healthcare providers (e.g. midwives, nurses, doctors) which accounts for higher rates of <b>maternal</b> <b>death,</b> up to 1:1,000 live births. This is despite the WHO setting standards, such as a minimum of four antenatal visits. A lack of healthcare providers, facilities, and resources such as formularies all contribute to high levels of morbidity amongst women from avoidable conditions such as obstetrical fistulae, sexually transmitted diseases and cervical cancer.|$|E
40|$|Reliable {{data from}} South Africa emanating from WHO {{recommendations}} for the Safe Motherhood programme underscores HIV/AIDS as {{the most common cause}} of <b>maternal</b> <b>deaths.</b> The strengthening of HIV services for pregnant women especially in countries with a high burden of HIV infection will reduce HIV-related and un-related maternal mortality rates. High-quality and complete data on <b>maternal</b> <b>deaths</b> is a critical foundation for reliably monitoring temporal trends in <b>maternal</b> <b>deaths,</b> and causes thereof, but needs substantial strengthening in many resource-constrained settings. HIV/AIDS is an increasing contributor to direct and indirect causes of <b>maternal</b> <b>deaths</b> in sub-Saharan Africa. A review of published data on <b>maternal</b> <b>deaths</b> and its association with HIV shows that reliable data come from the Confidential Enquiries into <b>Maternal</b> <b>Deaths</b> from South Africa, population-based surveys in sentinel populations, and facility-based data. Despite an increase in knowledge of the HIV status of pregnant women and the initiation of antiretroviral treatment, reversals in trends towards increased <b>maternal</b> <b>deaths</b> are not being observed.

25|$|Trauma {{occurs in}} {{approximately}} 5% of all pregnancies, {{and is the}} leading cause of <b>maternal</b> <b>death.</b> Additionally, pregnant women may experience placental abruption, pre-term labor, and uterine rupture. There are diagnostic issues during pregnancy; ionizing radiation has been shown to cause birth defects, although the doses used for typical exams generally are considered safe. Due to normal physiological changes that occur during pregnancy, shock may be more difficult to diagnose. Where the woman is more than 23 weeks pregnant, it is recommended that the fetus be monitored for at least four hours by cardiotocography.|$|E
25|$|Gender and sex {{are also}} {{components}} of health disparity {{in the female}} population. The 2012 World Development Report (WDR) noted that women in developing nations experience greater mortality rates than men in developing nations.

40|$|Indirect <b>maternal</b> <b>deaths</b> outnumber direct deaths due to obstetric {{causes in}} many high-income countries, {{and there has}} been a {{significant}} increase in the proportion of <b>maternal</b> <b>deaths</b> due to indirect medical causes in low- to middle-income countries. This review presents a detailed analysis of indirect <b>maternal</b> <b>deaths</b> in the UK and a perspective on the causes and trends in indirect <b>maternal</b> <b>deaths</b> and issues related to care in low- to middle-income countries. There has been no significant decrease in the rate of indirect <b>maternal</b> <b>deaths</b> in the UK since 2003. In 2011 - 2013, 68 % of all <b>maternal</b> <b>deaths</b> were due to indirect causes, and cardiac disease was the single largest cause. The major issues identified in care of women who died from an indirect cause was a lack of clarity about which medical professional should take responsibility for care and overall management. Under-reporting and misclassification result in underestimation of the rate of indirect <b>maternal</b> <b>deaths</b> in low- to middle-income countries. Causes of indirect death include a range of communicable diseases, non-communicable diseases and nutritional disorders. There has been evidence of a shift in incidence from direct to indirect <b>maternal</b> <b>deaths</b> in many low- to middle-income countries due to an increase in non-communicable diseases among women in the reproductive age. The gaps in care identified include poor access to health services, lack of healthcare providers, delay in diagnosis or misdiagnosis and inadequate follow-up during the postnatal period. Irrespective of the significant gains made in reducing maternal mortality in many countries worldwide, there is evidence of a steady increase in the rate of indirect deaths due to pre-existing medical conditions. This heightens the need for research to generate evidence about the risk factors, management and outcomes of specific medical comorbidities during pregnancy in order to provide appropriate evidence-based multidisciplinary care across the entire pathway: pre-pregnancy, during pregnancy and delivery, and postpartum...|$|R
40|$|Background: An {{audit of}} autopsies of <b>maternal</b> <b>deaths</b> is {{important}} for the establishment of accurate cause of <b>maternal</b> <b>deaths</b> and to determine the contribution of various etiologies responsible in a given community. Aim: To study the causes of <b>maternal</b> <b>deaths</b> as determined by a pathological autopsy. Settings and Design: A retrospective study of all the cases of <b>maternal</b> <b>deaths</b> that underwent a pathological autopsy in a tertiary healthcare center from January 1998 to December 2006. Materials and Methods: The autopsy records with clinical notes were retrieved; gross and histopathology specimens and slides were studied to establish the accurate cause of <b>maternal</b> <b>deaths.</b> The variables like age (years), stay in the hospital, gravidity, trimester of pregnancy and method of delivery were used to classify and analyze the data from the autopsies. The causes of <b>maternal</b> <b>deaths</b> were divided in to direct and indirect; each being classified into subgroups based on the most evident pathology on autopsy. Results: The Maternal Mortality Rate (MMR) over a nine-year period (1998 - 2006) was 827 / 100000 live births (471 <b>maternal</b> <b>deaths</b> against 56944 live births). An autopsy was performed in 277 cases (58. 8 &#x 0025;). In the autopsy group, the most common causes of maternal mortality were pre-ecclampsia/ecclampsia (40 of 277, 14. 44 &#x 0025;) and hemorrhage (32 of 277; 11. 55 &#x 0025;); However, indirect causes like infectious diseases (27 of 277; 9. 75 &#x 0025;) and cardiac (27 of 277; 9. 75 &#x 0025;) disease also contributed to <b>maternal</b> <b>deaths.</b> Conclusion: Indirect causes like rheumatic heart disease and infections like tuberculosis, malaria or leptospirosis and nutritional anemia are still major causes of maternal mortality in developing countries like India. Intensive efforts need to be taken in these areas to reduce the maternal mortality in developing countries like India...|$|R
