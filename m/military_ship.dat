2500|$|In 2017, a History Channel documentary, , {{proposed}} that a photograph in the National Archives of Jaluit Atoll in the Marshall Islands {{was actually a}} picture of a captured Earhart and Noonan. [...] The picture showed a Caucasian male on a dock who appeared to look like Noonan and a woman sitting on the dock but facing away from the camera, who was judged to have a physique and haircut resembling Earhart's. [...] The documentary theorizes that the photo was taken after Earhart and Noonan crashed at Mili Atoll. [...] The documentary also said that physical evidence recovered from Mili matches pieces that could have fallen off an Electra during a crash or subsequent overland move to a barge. [...] The Lost Evidence [...] {{proposed that}} a Japanese ship seen in the photograph was the Koshu Maru, a Japanese <b>military</b> <b>ship.</b> [...] The Lost Evidence was quickly discredited, however, after Japanese blogger Kota Yamano found the original source of the photograph in the Archives in the National Diet Library Digital Collection. [...] The original source of the photo was a Japanese travel guide published in October 1935, implying that the photograph was taken in 1935 or before, and thus would be unrelated to Earhart and Noonan's 1937 disappearance. [...] Additionally, the researcher who discovered the photo also identified the ship in the right of the photo as another ship called Koshu seized by Allied Japanese forces in World War I and not the Koshu Maru.|$|E
