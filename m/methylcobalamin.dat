25|$|Another {{example is}} the work which was done on the {{methylation}} of elements such as sulfur, selenium, tellurium and polonium by living organisms. It {{has been shown that}} bacteria can convert these elements into volatile compounds, it is thought that <b>methylcobalamin</b> (vitamin B12) alkylates these elements to create the dimethyls. It has been shown that a combination of Cobaloxime and inorganic polonium in sterile water forms a volatile polonium compound, while a control experiment which did not contain the cobalt compound did not form the volatile polonium compound. For the sulfur work the isotope 35S was used, while for polonium 207Po was used. In some related work by the addition of 57Co to the bacterial culture, followed by isolation of the cobalamin from the bacteria (and the measurement of the radioactivity of the isolated cobalamin) it was shown that the bacteria convert available cobalt into <b>methylcobalamin.</b>|$|E
500|$|It {{has been}} {{reported}} that some microbes can methylate polonium by the action of <b>methylcobalamin.</b> This is similar {{to the way in which}} mercury, selenium, and tellurium are methylated in living things to create organometallic compounds.

2500|$|Vitamin B12 is {{the only}} {{acceptor}} of methyl-THF, and this reaction produces methyl-B12 (<b>methylcobalamin).</b> There is also only one acceptor for methyl-B12, homocysteine, in a reaction catalyzed by homocysteine methyltransferase. These reactions are important because a defect in homocysteine methyltransferase or a deficiency of B12 {{may lead to a}} so-called [...] "methyl-trap" [...] of THF, in which THF converts to a reservoir of methyl-THF. Thereafter, this THF has no way of being metabolized, and serves as a sink of THF that causes a subsequent deficiency in folate. Thus, a deficiency in B12 can generate a large pool of methyl-THF that is unable to undergo reactions and mimics folate deficiency.|$|E
50|$|<b>Methylcobalamin</b> that is {{ingested}} is {{not used}} directly as a cofactor, but is first converted by MMACHC into cob(II)alamin. Cob(II)alamin is then later converted into the other 2 forms, adenosylcobalamin and <b>methylcobalamin</b> for use as cofactors. That is, <b>methylcobalamin</b> is first dealkylated and then regenerated.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Methylcobalamin</b> is {{produced}} by some bacteria. It {{plays an important role}} in the environment.

50|$|One author {{says it is}} {{important}} to treat vitamin B deficiency with hydroxocobalamin or cyanocobalamin or a combination of adenosylcobalamin and <b>methylcobalamin,</b> and not <b>methylcobalamin</b> alone.|$|E

50|$|Adenosylcobalamin (AdoCbl), {{which is}} also known as {{cobamamide}} and dibencozide, is, along with <b>methylcobalamin</b> (MeCbl), one of the active forms of vitamin B12. It is available as a nutritional supplement, along with cyanocobalamin, <b>methylcobalamin,</b> and hydroxocobalamin.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Methylcobalamin</b> (mecobalamin, MeCbl, or MeB) is a cobalamin, a form {{of vitamin}} B. It differs from {{cyanocobalamin}} in that the cyano at the cobalt is replaced with a methyl group. <b>Methylcobalamin</b> features an octahedral cobalt(III) centre and can be obtained as bright red crystals. [...] From the perspective of coordination chemistry, <b>methylcobalamin</b> is notable as a rare example of a compound that contains metal-alkyl bonds.

5000|$|The two {{bioactive}} {{forms of}} vitamin [...] are <b>methylcobalamin</b> in cytosol and adenosylcobalamin in mitochondria.

Both <b>methylcobalamin</b> and adenosylcobalamin are commercially available as supplement pills. The MMACHC gene product catalyzes the decyanation of cyanocobalamin {{as well as the}} dealkylation of alkylcobalamins including <b>methylcobalamin</b> and adenosylcobalamin. This function has also been attributed to cobalamin reductases. The MMACHC gene product and cobalamin reductases enable the interconversion of cyano- and alkylcobalamins.|$|E

50|$|Cobalamins are {{characterized}} by a porphyrin-like corrin nucleus that contains a single cobalt atom bound to a benzimidazolyl nucleotide and a variable residue (R) group. The variable R group {{gives rise to the}} four most commonly known cobalamins: CNCbl, <b>methylcobalamin,</b> 5-deoxyadenosylcobalamin, and OHCbl. In the serum, hydroxocobalamin and cyanocobalamin are believed to function as storage or transport forms of the molecule, whereas <b>methylcobalamin</b> and 5-deoxyadenosylcobalamin are the active forms of the coenzyme required for cell growth and replication. Cyanocobalamin is usually converted to hydroxocobalamin in the serum, whereas hydroxocobalamin is converted to either <b>methylcobalamin</b> or 5-deoxyadenosyl cobalamin. Cobalamins circulate bound to serum proteins called transcobalamins (TC) and haptocorrins. Hydroxocobalamin has a higher affinity to the TC II transport protein than cyanocobalamin, or 5-deoxyadenosylcobalamin. From a biochemical point of view, two essential enzymatic reactions require vitamin B12 (cobalamin).|$|E

50|$|Mutations in the MTR gene {{have been}} {{identified}} as the underlying cause of <b>methylcobalamin</b> deficiency complementation group G, or <b>methylcobalamin</b> deficiency cblG-type. Deficiency or deregulation of the enzyme due to deficient methionine synthase reductase can directly result in elevated levels of homocysteine, which is associated with blindness, neurological symptoms, and birth defects. Most cases of methionine synthase deficiency are symptomatic within 2 years of birth with many patients rapidly developing severe encephalopathy. One consequence of reduced methionine synthase activity that is measurable by routine clinical blood tests is megaloblastic anemia.|$|E
50|$|This vitamer {{is one of}} two active coenzymes used by vitamin B-dependent enzymes and is the {{specific}} vitamin B form used by 5-methyltetrahydrofolate-homocysteine methyltransferase (MTR), also known as methionine synthase. <b>Methylcobalamin</b> participates in the Wood-Ljungdahl pathway, which is a pathway by which some organisms utilize carbon dioxide as their source of organic compounds. In this pathway, <b>methylcobalamin</b> provides the methyl group that couples to carbon monoxide (derived from CO2) to afford acetyl-CoA. Acetyl-CoA is a derivative of acetic acid that is converted to more complex molecules as required by the organism.|$|E
