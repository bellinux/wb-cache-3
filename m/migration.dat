5|$|During <b>migration,</b> {{the song}} thrush travels mainly {{at night with}} a strong and direct flight action. It flies in loose flocks which cross the sea on a broad front rather than concentrating at short {{crossings}} (as occurs in the <b>migration</b> of large soaring birds), and calls frequently to maintain contact. <b>Migration</b> may start as early as late August in the most easterly and northerly parts of the range, {{but the majority of}} birds, with shorter distances to cover, head south from September to mid-December. However, hard weather may force further movement. Return <b>migration</b> varies between mid-February around the Mediterranean to May in northern Sweden and central Siberia. Vagrants have been recorded in Greenland, various Atlantic islands, and West Africa.|$|E

5|$|Hunting along <b>migration</b> routes threatens some bird species. The {{populations of}} Siberian cranes (Leucogeranus leucogeranus) that wintered in India {{declined}} due to hunting along the route, particularly in Afghanistan and Central Asia. Birds were last seen in their favourite wintering grounds in Keoladeo National Park in 2002. Structures such as power lines, wind farms and offshore oil-rigs {{have also been}} known to affect migratory birds. Other <b>migration</b> hazards include pollution, storms, wildfires, and habitat destruction along <b>migration</b> routes, denying migrants food at stopover points. For example, in the East Asian–Australasian Flyway, up to 65% of key intertidal habitat at the Yellow Sea <b>migration</b> bottleneck has been destroyed since the 1950s.|$|E

This exposure also decreased TBR1 and TBR2 expression. However, further research showed that cocaine exposure only delayed TBR1 expression and did not cause permanent downregulation. Therefore, in models of prenatal cocaine exposure both <b>migration</b> and maturation of these progenitor cells is delayed.|$|E

5|$|The {{park and}} the Athi-Kapiti Plains are linked by the migrations of wild {{herbivore}} populations. The plains {{to the south of}} the park are important feeding areas during the wet season. Before the city was established, herds of animals followed the rains and moved across the plains from Mount Kilimanjaro to Mount Kenya, a <b>migration</b> as great as the <b>migration</b> that takes place on the Serengeti. However, as the city grew the park became the northernmost limit of the animal's <b>migration.</b> Migrating animals can reach their southern pastures by travelling through the part of the Athi plains called the Kitengela. This land is very important to their <b>migration</b> routes, but growth in the human population and the accompanying need for land threaten to cut off this traditional <b>migration</b> route from the park to land further south. The park's migratory species are also threatened by changing settlement patterns, fencing, and their closeness to Nairobi and other industrial towns. These activities fragment their ecosystems and occupy their habitat.|$|E

5|$|Bird <b>migration</b> routes {{have been}} studied {{by a variety of}} {{techniques}} including the oldest, marking. Swans have been marked with a nick on the beak since about 1560 in England. Scientific ringing was pioneered by Hans Christian Cornelius Mortensen in 1899. Other techniques include radar and satellite tracking. The rate of bird <b>migration</b> over the Alps (up to a height of 150 m) was found to be highly comparable between fixed-beam radar measurements and visual bird counts, highlighting the potential use of this technique as an objective way of quantifying bird <b>migration.</b>|$|E

5|$|Most {{mourning}} doves migrate along flyways over land. On rare occasions, mourning doves {{have been}} seen flying over the Gulf of Mexico, but this is exceptional. Spring <b>migration</b> north runs from March to May. Fall <b>migration</b> south runs from September to November, with immatures moving first, followed by adult females and then by adult males. <b>Migration</b> is usually during the day, in flocks, and at low altitudes.

40|$|Fibroblast {{growth factors}} (FGFs) bind to FGF receptors, transmembrane {{tyrosine}} kinases that activate mitogenic, motogenic, and differentiative responses in different tissues. While {{there has been}} substantial progress in elucidating the Ras-MAP kinase pathway that mediates the differentiative responses, the signal transduction pathways that lead to directed cell <b>migrations</b> are not well defined. Here we describe a Drosophila gene called stumps that is required for FGF-dependent <b>migrations</b> of tracheal and mesodermal cells. These <b>migrations</b> are controlled by different FGF ligands and receptors, and they occur by different cellular mechanisms: the tracheal <b>migrations</b> occur {{as part of an}} epithelium whereas the mesodermal <b>migrations</b> are fibroblast-like. In the stumps mutant, tracheal cells fail to move out from the epithelial sacs, and only rudimentary tracheal branches form. Mesodermal cells fail in their dorsal <b>migrations</b> after gastrulation. The stumps mutation does not block all FGF signaling effects in these tissues: both random cell <b>migrations</b> and Ras-MAP kinase-mediated induction of FGF-specific effector genes occurred upon ectopic expression of the ligand or upon expression of a constitutively activated Ras protein in the migrating cells. The results suggest that stumps function promotes FGF-directed cell <b>migrations,</b> either by potentiating the FGF signaling process or by coupling the signal to the cellular machinery required for directed cell movement...|$|R
