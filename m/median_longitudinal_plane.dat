A carrycot is a restraint system intended to accommodate and restrain the child in a supine or prone position with the child's spine perpendicular to the <b>median</b> <b>longitudinal</b> <b>plane</b> of the vehicle. Carrycots are designed to distribute the restraining forces over the child's head and body, excluding its limbs, {{in the event of}} a big crash. It must be put on the rear seat of the car. Some models can be changed to face forward after the baby has reached the weight limit which is normally about 15-20 kilograms.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe paper {{presents}} {{a comparison between}} the experimental and numerical results on the flow around a Bolund Island 1 : 705 scale model. A boundary layer wind tunnel with expansion stage was used for experimental modelling [9]. Velocity fields were determined using Constant Temperature Anemometry (CTA) and Particle image Velocimetry (PIV) measurements. Unsteady numerical simulations were performed using a Reynolds Average Navier Stokes (RANS) turbulence model adapted to atmospheric boundary layer flows [6] which was implemented in the ANSYS FLUENT expert software. At the beginning, the wind tunnel with expansion stage was explored and measurements were performed to determine the flow characteristics in the experimental vein. Data from CTA measurements in the <b>median</b> <b>longitudinal</b> <b>plane,</b> in eleven sections located at different distances from the expansion stage were used to determine mean velocity ant turbulence intensity profiles. Comparison with real data from the Bolund experiment showed a good agreement with the wind tunnel measurements. The experimental 1 : 705 scale model of the Bolund Island was manufactured on a CNC machine using the topographical data provided by the Risø DTU team from the Bolund experiment. Same data was used to build the mesh which virtually replicates the model placed in the experimental vein of the wind tunnel. PIV measurements were performed {{in order to determine the}} velocity, turbulence intensity and vorticity contours in a vertical reference plane and then compared to the URANS numerical simulation results...|$|E

40|$|Key words: {{negative}} buoyancy vehicle; reduction of order; linear system; modes of motion; static stability; constant load Abstract: This article described a novel type of {{autonomous underwater vehicle}} and modeled the dynamics.

40|$|SUMMARY Five {{patients}} with "locked-in " syndrome and dysconjugate palsy of horizontal gaze were studied. In all cases internuclear ophthalmoplegia due to dysfunction or {{destruction of the}} <b>median</b> <b>longitudinal</b> fasciculus was combined with an ipsilateral gaze palsy, producing the "one-and-a-half " syndrome. Clinical and electro-oculographic examination suggested involvement of the paramedian pontine reticular formation when all ipsilateral saccades were abolished, when exotropia of the contralateral eye was present, and when vestibular stimulation showed full conjugate deviation to the damaged side. Involvement of the abducens nucleus was suggested when the palsy of ipsilateral gaze was not dissociated on vestibular stimulation. In three cases these clinical deductions were confirmed by the pathological study, which showed a correspond-ing destruction-of the <b>median</b> <b>longitudinal</b> fasciculus, paramedian pontine reticular formation and abducens nucleus. In one case the one-and-a-half syndrome evolved into a total horizontal gaze palsy, which corresponded to involvement of the abducens nucleus contralateral to the initially destroyed paramedian pontine reticular formation. Vertical oculocephalic response dis-appeared, because of destruction of the <b>median</b> <b>longitudinal</b> fasciculus on both sides (bilateral internuclear ophthalmoplegia).
