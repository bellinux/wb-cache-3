5|$|Bianchi {{collided}} with {{the rear of the}} tractor crane, which caused extensive damage to his car; its roll bar was destroyed as it slid underneath. The impact jolted the tractor crane off the ground, causing Sutil's car (suspended in the air by the crane) to fall to the ground. Marshals moved away from the scene to avoid being struck by Bianchi's Marussia. Calculations in July 2015 indicated a peak of 254 g0 (2,490m/s2), and data from the FIA's World Accident Databaseâwhich sources information from racing accidents worldwideâindicate that Bianchi's impact occurred 2.61 seconds after loss of control, at a speed of 123km/h (76mph) and an angle of 55 degrees. Bianchi was reported unconscious after not responding to a team radio call or marshals. Marshals reported the accident, and safety and medical cars were dispatched. Bianchi was extracted from his car and treated at the crash site before being taken by ambulance to the circuit's <b>medical</b> <b>centre.</b> Transport by helicopter was impossible due to the weather; Bianchi was taken by ambulance with a police escort to Mie Prefectural General Medical Center in Yokkaichi, about 15km (9.3mi, a 32-minute drive) from the track.|$|E
