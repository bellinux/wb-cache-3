40|$|Computing semiparametric bounds for option {{prices is}} a widely studied pricing technique. In {{contrast}} to parametric pricing techniques, such as Monte-Carlo simulations, semiparametric pricing techniques do not require strong assumptions about the <b>underlying</b> <b>asset</b> <b>price</b> distribution. We extend classical results in this area in two main directions. First, we derive closed-form semiparametric bounds for the payoff of a European call option, given up to third-order moment information on the <b>underlying</b> <b>asset</b> <b>price.</b> We analyze how these bounds tighten the corresponding bounds, when only second-order moment (i. e., mean and variance) information is provided. Second, we derive closed-form semiparametric bounds for the risk associated to the expected payoff of a European call option, when the mean and the variance of the <b>underlying</b> <b>asset</b> <b>price</b> are given. Applications of these results to other areas such as inventory and supply chain management are also discussed. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{issue of}} {{forecasting}} the future price of risky financial assets has attracted academia and business practice since {{the inception of}} the stock exchange. Also due to the just finished financial crisis, which was the worst crisis since the Great Depression, it is clear that research in this area has not been finished yet. On the contrary, new challenges have been raised. The main goal of the thesis is the demonstration of the significant information potential which is hidden in option market prices. These prices contain informations on probability distribution of the <b>underlying</b> <b>asset</b> returns and the risk connected with these returns. Other objectives of the thesis are the forecast of the <b>underlying</b> <b>asset</b> <b>price</b> distribution using parametric and nonparametric estimates, the improvement of this forecast using the utility function of the representative investor, the description of the current market sentiment and the determination of the risk premium, especially the risk premium on Czech market. The thesis deals with the forecast of the <b>underlying</b> <b>asset</b> <b>price</b> probability distribution implied by the current option market prices using parametric and nonparametric estimates. The resulting distribution is described by the moment characteristics which represent a valuable tool for analyzing the current market sentiment. According to the theory, the probability distribution of the <b>underlying</b> <b>asset</b> <b>price</b> implied by option prices is risk neutral, i. e. it applies only to risk neutral investors. The theory further implies that the distribution of real world can be derived from the risk neutral distribution using utility function of the representative investor. The inclusion of a utility function of representative investor improves the forecast of the <b>underlying</b> <b>asset</b> <b>price</b> distribution. Three different utility functions of traditional risk theory are used in the thesis. These functions range from the simple power function to the general function of hyperbolic absolute risk aversion (HARA). Further, Friedman-Savage utility function is used. This function allows both a risk averse investor and a risk loving investor. The thesis also answers the question: Are the current <b>asset</b> <b>prices</b> at so high level that the purchase of the asset means a gamble? The risk premium associated with investing in the risky asset is derived in the thesis. The risk premium can be understood as the premium demanded by investors for investment in a risky asset against the investment in a riskless asset. All the theoretical methods introduced in the thesis are demonstrated on real data coming from two different markets. Developing market is represented by shares of CEZ and developed market is represented by S&P 500 futures. The thesis deals with demonstrations in single point in time as well as in available history of the data. The forecasts of the <b>underlying</b> <b>asset</b> <b>price</b> distribution and the relating risk premium are constructed in the available data history. The goals and the objectives of the thesis have been achieved. The contribution of the thesis is the development of parametric and nonparametric methodology for estimating the <b>underlying</b> <b>asset</b> <b>price</b> probability distribution implied by the option market prices so that the nature of the particular market and instrument is captured. The further contribution of the thesis is the construction of the forecasts of the <b>underlying</b> <b>asset</b> <b>price</b> distribution and the construction of the market sentiment in the available history of data. The contribution of the thesis is also the construction of the market risk premium in the available history and the establishment of the hypothesis that the markets gamble before the crisis...|$|R
5000|$|As {{the name}} {{introduces}} it, the option's strike price is floating and determined at maturity. The floating strike is the optimal {{value of the}} <b>underlying</b> <b>asset's</b> <b>price</b> during the option life.

40|$|Options markets display {{interesting}} features. Most {{options are}} executed {{when they are}} near the money. However, the <b>underlying</b> <b>asset</b> <b>price</b> varies significantly during the life-time option. It is therefore difficult {{to predict the future}} option position. In order to make options' markets more liquid, the paper proposes to replace all options into At-the-Money (ATM) ones by resetting the strike price X to the <b>asset</b> <b>price</b> at pre-specified time point t, before maturity time T. Strike price is locked in at the then <b>underlying</b> <b>asset</b> <b>price</b> S_{t} regardless whether it is above or below S_{t}. The reset condition is in exchange for deposit in the Clearing House. The idea is to provide a general valuation of reset option of Gray and Whaley (1999) in which reset condition does not depend on the relation between the strike <b>price</b> and the <b>underlying</b> <b>asset</b> <b>price.</b> The contribution of this paper is double. First, it shows that our general model option, under specific conditions, can be generalized to the most common ones like for example Black-Scholes-Merton, forward-start and strike reset pricing formulae etc [...] . Second, in line with Haug and Haug (2001), we use the CRR binominal approach (Cox et al., 1979) and an estimation program of the cumulative bivariate normal distribution to provide closed-form solution for the pricing of the generalized European reset option. ...|$|R

40|$|We {{assume that}} the call option's value is {{correctly}} priced by Black and Scholes' option pricing model in this paper. This paper derives an exact closed-form solution for implied standard deviation {{under the condition that}} the <b>underlying</b> <b>asset</b> <b>price</b> equals the present value of the exercise price. The exact closed-form solution provides the true implied standard deviation and has no estimate error. This paper also develops three alternative formulas to estimate the implied standard deviation if this condition is violated. Application of the Taylor expansion on a single call option value derives the first formula. The accuracy of this formula depends on the deviation between the <b>underlying</b> <b>asset</b> <b>price</b> and the present value of the exercise price. Use of the Taylor formula on two call option prices with different exercise prices is used to develop the second formula, which can be used even though the <b>underlying</b> <b>asset</b> <b>price</b> deviates significantly from the present value of the exercise price. Extension of the second formula's approach to third options value derives the third formula. A merit of the third formula is to circumvent a required parameter used in the second formula.
