500|$|English is {{an immensely}} rich {{language}} {{in terms of}} vocabulary, containing <b>more</b> <b>synonyms</b> than any other language. There are words which appear on the surface to mean {{exactly the same thing}} but which, in fact, have a slightly different shade of meaning and must be used appropriately if a speaker wants to convey precisely the message they intend to convey. It is generally stated that English has around 170,000 words, or 220,000 if obsolete words are counted; this estimate is based on the last full edition of the Oxford English Dictionary from 1989. Over half of these words are nouns, a quarter adjectives and a seventh verbs. There is one count that puts the English vocabulary at about 1 million wordsbut that count presumably includes words such as Latin species names, scientific terminology, prefixed and suffixed words, jargon, foreign words of extremely limited English use and technical acronyms.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Cross {{language}} information retrieval (CLIR) presents huge ambiguous results as polysemy problems. Therefore, the semantic approach comes {{to solve the}} polysemy problem which that the same word may have different meanings according to the context of sentences. This paper presents semantic technique on queries for retrieving more relevant results in CLIR) that concentrates on the Arabic, Malay or English query(s) translation (a dictionary based method) to retrieve documents according to query(s) translation. Therefore, semantic ontology significantly improves and expands the single query itself with <b>more</b> <b>synonym</b> and related words. The query however is to retrieve relevant documents across language boundaries. Therefore, this study is conducted with the purposes to investigate English-Malay-Arabic query(s) translation approach and vice versa against keywords and querywords based on total retrieve and relevant. Keywords and querywords retrieval are evaluated in the experiments in terms of precision and recall. In order to produce more significant results, semantic technique is therefore applied to improve the performance of CLIR...|$|R
40|$|Word sense {{ambiguity}} {{is widely}} spread in all natural languages; a word may carry several distinct meanings. Human {{can figure out}} the suitable meaning according to {{the context in which}} the word occurs. The Arabic language is highly polysemous; in many situations we find it extremely necessary to disambiguate the word senses. This paper studies and compares the performance of a search engine before and after expanding the query through Interactive Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD). We found that expanding polysemous query terms by adding <b>more</b> specific <b>synonyms</b> will narrow the search into the specific targeted request and thus causes both precision and recall to increase; on the other hand, expanding the query with a <b>more</b> general (polysemous) <b>synonym</b> will broaden the search which would cause the precision to decrease...|$|R

40|$|The {{relationship}} between two important semantic properties (polysemy and syn-onymy) {{of language and}} one of the most fundamental syntactic network proper-ties (a degree of the node) is observed. Based on the synergetic theory of language, it is hypothesized that a word which occurs in more syntactic contexts, i. e. it has a higher degree, should be more polysemous and have <b>more</b> <b>synonyms</b> than a word which occurs in less syntactic contexts, i. e. it has a lesser degree. Six languages are used for hypotheses testing and, tentatively, the hypotheses are corroborated.
