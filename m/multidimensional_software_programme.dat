40|$|The {{fundamental}} abstractions used by {{the majority}} of pro-gramming languages to store computer programs has not changed significantly in 40 years. Software configura-tion management systems reflect this, forcing a unidimen-sional file-based decomposition of the system for storage purposes. By applying the same techniques of indirection that have driven programming design to program storage, an SCM system can provide a collection of facilities that I call <b>multidimensional</b> <b>software</b> configuration manage-ment, which both resembles and supports aspect-oriented software development. In this paper, I will describe Stel-lation, a new system under development at IBM Research, and how it supports <b>multidimensional</b> <b>software</b> configura-tion management. ...|$|R

30|$|Our {{study has}} several limitations. First, a true golden {{standard}} {{for the assessment of}} breast density is lacking. There is no accurate way to determine breast density other than histopathologic analysis of mastectomy specimens. It is obvious that these specimens are not available for this study, and previously published studies assessing breast density with various computerised methods also lack this (true) golden standard. As we have shown in this study, our <b>software</b> <b>programme</b> acquired similar results to other, more validated programmes. This is why we have chosen to use our <b>software</b> <b>programme</b> as the reference standard (not golden standard) to which we compared the visual assessment of breast density.|$|R

40|$|The main {{objective}} of couches employed with MGSU Department of Physical Training and Sports consists in {{the improvement of}} the quality of physical training of specialists. Attainment of this objective requires new incentives, advanced knowledge sharing and dissemination technologies. Development and implementation of the <b>software</b> <b>programme</b> responsible for the monitoring of the psychophysical health of students and available 24 hours a day is one of the challenges of Department of Physical Training and Sports. One of the most important tasks to be solved by lecturers of higher education institutions is to teach students to assess their health. This task may also involve development of a <b>software</b> <b>programme</b> to serve as a uniform source of information needed for effective interaction between coaches (lecturers) and students. The software is being developed by Department of Physical Training and Sports in collaboration of Department of Mathematics and Informatics. When the software is in operation, the coaches will be able to monitor the physical condition of students. The <b>software</b> <b>programme</b> will also analyze the health data within the entire period of training of each student at an institution of higher education. All data will be automatically processed. The <b>software</b> <b>programme</b> will be a good self-check diary available at any time. All data entered into the database will be strictly confidential. Each registered student will have a personal page protected by the password and the login name; however, access to the general database will be available to lecturers and coaches who will be responsible for adjustments to personal health improvement and physical training programmes.

40|$|The {{issue of}} {{enhancing}} an already superior visual system in elite athletes {{has led to}} several investigations dealing with intervention programmes designed to enhance visual performance. The influence of visual skills enhancement programmes has been investigated (Coffey & Reichow, 1990; Calder, 2005; Love, Kluka, & Young, 2006; Kluka & Love, 2006). Researchers (Kluka & Love, 2006; Kluka, Love, Covington, Bristow, & Allison, 2000) have reported that elite athletes, when compared to nonathletes, have superior visual abilities, measured through contrast sensitivity function, peripheral vision, visual reaction time, static visual acuity, eye movements, visual concentration, visual recognition and static / dynamic balance. Practical limitations, however, involves applicability to athletes. Where geographical location is considered, access to such training is a factor. A <b>software</b> <b>programme,</b> EyeThinkSport (Calder, 2006), was developed as an internet-based, self-administered intervention. Accessed through a personal computer with an internet link, the programme was designed to improve athlete's visual abilities and decision making. The aim {{of this investigation was}} to determine the efficacy of the EyeThinkSport visual training <b>software</b> <b>programme</b> on selected cricket athletes at high school club level. Thirty high school level (aged 13 - 19) cricket players participated. Each player had at least 3 years of cricket playing experience. Participants were divided into 2 groups (E = 15) and (C = 15). Four phases of assessment were involved : (1) Series of preliminary visual assessments to establish testing protocol; (2) Pre-training programme assessment (pretest) using six different visual skills tests and five different cricket-specific skill tests (baseline data); (3) Three-week training programme using the EyeThinkSport <b>software</b> <b>programme</b> or a placebo; (4) Post training assessment (posttest) using 6 visual and 5 cricket-specific tests. All outcome variables were analyzed using a RM-ANOVA (group X time). Where significant interaction (p < 0. 05) effects were found, post-hoc analyses were performed (Tukey's HSD). In all tests involving visual skills, E performances showed greater improvement when compared to C performances. The efficacy of the EyeThinkSport visual training <b>software</b> <b>programme</b> led to significant improvements in the performance of athletes in E in almost all visual skills. In contrast, there was minimal to moderate improvement in all tests {{with the exception of the}} horizontal and vertical saccades in C.
