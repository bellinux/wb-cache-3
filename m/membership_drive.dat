He played only two more first-class games. He scored an unbeaten 92 for the M.C.C. against Ireland in 1950. To help boost a Gloucestershire <b>membership</b> <b>drive,</b> he joined his former side for a match the following year. Although given an excellent reception by the crowd, his tired appearance and struggle to score seven runs before being dismissed embarrassed many of those present. In all first-class cricket, Hammond scored 50,551 runs {{at an average of}} 56.10 with 167 centuries. He remains seventh on the list of highest run scorers in first-class cricket and has the third highest number of centuries, as of 2015.|$|E

500|$|Provincially, Greenfield was {{originally}} a Liberal, {{but along with}} many other farmers, began to grow dissatisfied with the Liberal government's treatment of farmers. [...] He became involved with the United Farmers of Alberta, which prior to 1919 was a non-partisan lobby group that eschewed direct involvement in the political process.

[...] He headed an extremely successful <b>membership</b> <b>drive,</b> [...] Despite this involvement, he did not seek election to the Legislative Assembly of Alberta in the 1921 election.

Greenfield meanwhile had been named interim Vice President of the organization after the death of Percival Baker.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the period}} 1972–1974 the party lost a {{dramatic}} {{number of members}} (from 6000 to 300) and polled very poorly in the provincial elections of 1974.

The cabinet fell nine months after it was formed when Labour left the cabinet. D66 and the CDA continued to govern in a caretaker government. In the subsequent 1982 general election, D66 lost two-thirds of its support, and was left with only six seats. After the elections Terlouw left politics, and he was replaced by [...] The party was confined to opposition.|$|E
