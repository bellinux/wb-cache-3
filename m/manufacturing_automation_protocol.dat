Token bus {{was used by}} General Motors for their <b>Manufacturing</b> <b>Automation</b> <b>Protocol</b> (MAP) standardization effort.

50|$|Token passing schemes degrade deterministically under load, {{which is}} a key reason why they were popular for {{industrial}} control LANs such as MAP, (<b>Manufacturing</b> <b>Automation</b> <b>Protocol).</b> The advantage over contention based channel access (such as the CSMA/CD of early Ethernet), is that collisions are eliminated, and that the channel bandwidth can be fully utilized without idle time when demand is heavy. The disadvantage is that even when demand is light, a station wishing to transmit must wait for the token, increasing latency.|$|E

40|$|The ready {{availability}} of inexpensive and standard communications hardware {{in the late}} 1980 s, coupled with sufficient standardization of intermediate-layer protocols to make reliable machine-to-machine communication through any combination of standard devices a reality, has {{laid the groundwork for}} integrated automation on a grand scale. The contribution of the <b>Manufacturing</b> <b>Automation</b> <b>Protocols</b> (MAP) effort [MAP 87], thus far, has been to speed delivery of this powerful communications capability to the industrial community. We must realize, however, that the delivery of the capability has now outstripped our ability to use it. On the factory floor, we have no devices which are prepared to control automation on a grand scale, and even worse, we have few controllers which are capable of contributing their local automation to any kind of integrated whole. The stumbling block is the lack of common languages or even a common experience base in which to communicate about automation tasks. We are now {{in the midst of a}} flurry of intellectual activity, on both sides of the Atlantic, developing languages, architectures, control techniques, data systems, communications systems and ultimately controllers to meet this challenge. In such a burst of activity, it is to be expected that experts in individual areas will hasten to solve the problems with which they are most conversant, and that certai...|$|R

5000|$|<b>Manufacturing</b> <b>Automation</b> <b>Protocol</b> was a {{computer}} network standard released in 1982 for interconnection of devices from multiple manufacturers. It {{was developed by}} General Motors to combat the proliferation of incompatible communications standards used by suppliers of automation products such as programmable controllers. By 1985 demonstrations of interoperability were carried out and 21 vendors offered MAP products. In 1986 the Boeing corporation merged its Technical Office Protocol with the MAP standard, and the combined standard {{was referred to as}} [...] "MAP/TOP". The standard was revised several times between the first issue in 1982 and MAP 3.0 in 1987, with significant technical changes that made interoperation between different revisions of the standard difficult.|$|E

40|$|Current {{trends in}} {{communication}} technology are towards standardized protocols {{and services in}} order to be able to integrate heterogeneous computer systems in all areas of factory and office automation. One only needs to mention the MAP (<b>Manufacturing</b> <b>Automation</b> <b>Protocol)</b> project of General Motors or the closely related TOP (Technical and Office Protocol) project of Boeing. But conformance to standards alone is not sufficient to solve communication problems. The performance of a communication system is just as important. The performance is measured by the time required by the system to complete pre-defined communication tasks and the volume of user data which the system can handle. Using the example of a network of four interconnected token rings we illustrate how performance evaluation can be carried out with the aid of simulation. (IITB...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the development of}} the internal communication in a Flexible Manufacturing System @MS), using Manufacturing Message Specification (MMS) and based on a <b>Manufacturing</b> <b>Automation</b> <b>Protocol</b> (MAP) network. Because the machines, of which the FMS consists, had few possibilities for communication with external devices, effort had to be put into making machine-specific interfaces between the NC machines and the MAP network. The interfaces were implemented by developing applications that translate MMS messages into machine-specific data and vice versa. The results of the project show that MMS can be used for the control of manufacturing machines that were not designed for use in a network for flexible manufacturing. MMS is not yet widely used. Therefore this paper is meant to demonstrate that MMS can easily be put into practice using relatively simple and off-the-shelf equipment...|$|E

We are currently studying in depth how such standards can be used to communicate with robots and automated construction equipment used in a space project. Specifically, we are looking at how the <b>Manufacturing</b> <b>Automation</b> <b>Protocol</b> (MAP) and the Manufacturing Message Specification (MMS), which tie together computers and machines in automated factories, might be applied to space {{construction projects}}.

40|$|Computer {{integrated}} monitoring {{is a very}} large area in engineering where on-line, real time data acquisition with the aid of sensors is the solution to many problems in the manufacturing industry as opposed to the old data logging method by graphics analysis. The raw data which is collected this way however is useless {{in the absence of a}} proper computerized management system. The transfer of data between the management and the shop floor processes has been impossible in the past unless all the computers in the system were totally compatible with each other. This limits the efficiency of the systems because they get governed by the limitations of the computers. General Motors of U. S. A. have recently started research on a new standard called the <b>Manufacturing</b> <b>Automation</b> <b>Protocol</b> (MAP) which is expected to allow data transfer between different types of computers. This is still in early development stages and also is currently very expensive. This research programme shows how such a shop floor data acquisition system and a complete management system on entirely different computers can be integrated together to form a single system by achieving data transfer communications using a cheaper but a superior alternative to MAP. Standard communication character sets and hardware such as ASCII and UARTs have been used in this method but the technique is so powerful that totally incompatible computers are shown to run different programs (in different languages) simultaneously and yet receive data from each other and process in their own CPUs with no human intervention...|$|E

40|$|This study {{reports the}} results of an {{empirical}} research investigating the relationships between manufacturing efficiency and (a) adoption of the <b>manufacturing</b> <b>automation,</b> (b) business network and (c) managerial use of the information technology in Indonesian manufacturing organisations. A comprehensive review of the relevant literature reveals that previous researchers have investigated the relationship between manufacturing organisations' performance and their adoption of <b>manufacturing</b> <b>automation.</b> However, although the extant literature suggests that manufacturers' engagement in business network and managerial use of information technology could {{play an important role in}} the above relationship, the relevant previous studies did not consider the role of these variables. The current study addresses the above-mentioned gaps in the literature. It has done so by empirically investigating the effect of Indonesian manufacturing organisations' adoption of the <b>manufacturing</b> <b>automation,</b> engagement in the business network and managerial use of the information technology on their manufacturing efficiency. The sample of the study consists of 104 manufacturing organisations, which operate in Java Island, Indonesia. One manager in charge of one business unit of each of the 104 manufacturing organisations participated in this study. The results indicate that adoption of the <b>manufacturing</b> <b>automation</b> and engagement in the business network are indirectly associated with manufacturing efficiency through managerial use of the information technology.
