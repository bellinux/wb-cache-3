(iMoS) Intelligence Monitoring System is developed a prototype {{in order to}} be a monitoring platform to support the medical treatment of <b>HIV</b> <b>carriers</b> by integrating information technology approaches in fields of database, communication, and mobile application. iMoS consists of three main modules: 1) The clinical module; 2) The laboratory module; and 3) The monitoring module that transfer data with each other on computer network. The Clinical module is a front office to collect a client data and medical record form registration process. The risk assessment data is fed into database by consulting process. The Laboratory module is scientific machine section to perform testing Anti-body HIV and CD 4 testing with international standard to complete medical data. Morning module is the front-end application to contract with <b>HIV</b> <b>carriers</b> using wearable mobile device under privacy policy. It is important to take standardize monitoring <b>HIV</b> <b>carriers</b> by using information technology platform.

40|$|A conference {{paper on}} the {{counseling}} of HIV/AIDS {{patients and their families}} in Zimbabwe. The aim of this talk is to explore possible techniques for counselling <b>HIV</b> <b>carriers,</b> AIDS patients and their families, which do not involve extensive in-depth training in therapy. It is recognized that with the exponential growth in numbers of <b>HIV</b> <b>carriers</b> there will not be enough qualified social workers and psychologists to cope with the counselling load. Therefore, {{it will be necessary to}} provide training to interested persons who volunteer from the health service churches or as individuals.

The participants were selected through a theoretic sample: 20 <b>HIV</b> <b>carriers,</b> 19 representatives and volunteers from anti HIV associations and six administrative representatives. The information was obtained through semi-structured interviews and triangle groups; content analysis was performed. Participation has different meanings to the participant groups. <b>HIV</b> <b>carriers</b> consider it should be accomplished by communication mechanisms, support and prevention; association members consider it a right and a tool to change health policies, while two conceptions coexist among administrative representatives. The encouragement of participatory designs is proposed that respect the theoretical diversity and favor interaction based on distinct attitudes...|$|R

40|$|Outcome of {{patients}} with human immunodeficiency virus on maintenance hemodialysis. Fifty-one adults with HIV infection, including 20 chronic hemodialysis patients with superimposed HIV infection and 31 patients with HIV-associated nephropathy requiring chronic maintenance hemodialysis were followed to evaluate survival on outpatient dialysis {{in relation to the}} clinical stage of the HIV infection. Regardless of when they contracted the infection, AIDS patients who required maintenance hemodialysis had a poor prognosis. All 17 patients who developed AIDS died after a mean of 93 ± 32 days on hemodialysis (median 30 days; range 2 to 540 days). On the other hand, 12 asymptomatic <b>HIV</b> <b>carriers</b> were alive after a mean follow-up on chronic hemodialysis of 488 ± 75 days (median 420 days; range 142 to 850 days); and five hemodialyzed patients with ARC were alive after 564 ± 191 days (median 420 days; range 150 to 1230 days). The data confirm the lack of effectiveness of maintenance hemodialysis for prolonging life in patients with AIDS. This dismal prognosis was evident whether renal failure antedated HIV infection or whether it was HIV-associated. In asymptomatic <b>HIV</b> <b>carriers</b> and in patients with ARC, however, maintenance hemodialysis provides meaningful, long-term life support...|$|R

40|$|We {{evaluated}} {{whether or}} not intraurethral instillation of 5 -fluorouracil (5 -FU) solution can rapidly, safely, and effectively eradicate intraurethral condyloma acuminata in a human immunodeficiency virus (<b>HIV)</b> <b>carrier.</b> A 43 -year-old man presented with the major complaint of difficult micturition and blood dribbling from the urethral meatus for more than 6 months. He was an <b>HIV</b> <b>carrier</b> for more than 10 years and had undergone diathermy for perianal warts. Physical examination showed cauliflower lesions over the orifice of the urethra and frenulum base of the penile prepuce. Urinalysis disclosed pyuria and microscopic hematuria. Cystourethroscopy {{on the following day}} showed extensive wart lesions extending from the urethra to the bladder neck. Biopsy of the lesions was compatible with condyloma acuminata. 5 -FU solution (500 mg in normal saline 50 mL) urethral instillation with massage at the ventral side of the penile shaft for 20 minutes was given once a week for 7 doses. The urine routine was normal. Management was then prescribed once a month until the lesions became invisible under urethroscopy. After 18 doses of 5 -FU solution urethral instillation, no visible wart lesions were noted. He has been asymptomatic with no voiding difficulty for more than 1 year...|$|R
