5|$|Pain {{in cancer}} <b>may</b> <b>arise</b> <b>from</b> a tumor {{compressing}} or infiltrating nearby body parts; from treatments and diagnostic procedures; or from skin, nerve and other changes {{caused by a}} hormone imbalance or immune response. Most chronic (long-lasting) pain {{is caused by the}} illness and most acute (short-term) pain is caused by treatment or diagnostic procedures. However, radiotherapy, surgery and chemotherapy may produce painful conditions that persist long after treatment has ended.|$|E
5|$|Although cholangiocarcinoma {{is known}} to have the {{histological}} and molecular features of an adenocarcinoma of epithelial cells lining the biliary tract, the actual cell of origin is unknown. Recent evidence has suggested that the initial transformed cell that generates the primary tumor <b>may</b> <b>arise</b> <b>from</b> a pluripotent hepatic stem cell. Cholangiocarcinoma is thought to develop through a series of stages - from early hyperplasia and metaplasia, through dysplasia, to the development of frank carcinoma - in a process similar to that seen in the development of colon cancer. Chronic inflammation and obstruction of the bile ducts, and the resulting impaired bile flow, are thought {{to play a role in}} this progression.|$|E

5|$|Non-human animals may {{experience}} both spontaneous and traumatic pneumothorax. Spontaneous pneumothorax is, as in humans, classified as primary or secondary, while traumatic pneumothorax {{is divided into}} open and closed (with or without chest wall damage). The diagnosis may be apparent to the veterinary physician because the animal exhibits difficulty breathing in, or has shallow breathing. Pneumothoraces <b>may</b> <b>arise</b> <b>from</b> lung lesions (such as bullae) or from trauma to the chest wall. In horses, traumatic pneumothorax may involve both hemithoraces, as the mediastinum is incomplete {{and there is a}} direct connection between the two halves of the chest. Tension pneumothorax – the presence of which may be suspected due to rapidly deteriorating heart function, absent lung sounds throughout the thorax, and a barrel-shaped chest – is treated with an incision in the animal's chest to relieve the pressure, followed by insertion of a chest tube.|$|E
25|$|The {{representation}} <b>may</b> <b>arise</b> <b>from</b> {{either the}} words used or the behaviour of the parties.|$|E

6000|$|... [33] This superstition <b>may</b> have <b>arisen</b> <b>from</b> the {{peculiarity}} {{that the}} camel's milk, however fresh, if placed upon the fire, breaks like some cows' milk.|$|R
25|$|Pain in the anterolateral {{aspect of}} the {{shoulder}} is not specific to the shoulder, and <b>may</b> <b>arise</b> <b>from,</b> and be referred from, the neck, heart or gut.|$|E
25|$|Ocular {{albinism}} {{results from}} defects in the melanin system, which <b>may</b> <b>arise</b> <b>from</b> either defects in the OA1 receptor, or mutations {{of either the}} Tyr gene or P transporter.|$|E
25|$|Pathological {{phimosis}} (as {{opposed to}} the natural non-retractability of the foreskin in childhood) is rare and the causes are varied. Some cases <b>may</b> <b>arise</b> <b>from</b> balanitis (inflammation of the glans penis).|$|E
50|$|This branch, which <b>may</b> <b>arise</b> {{directly}} <b>from</b> {{the superficial}} temporal artery, supplies the Orbicularis oculi, and anastomoses with the lacrimal and palpebral {{branches of the}} ophthalmic artery.|$|R
2500|$|Be a [...] "Free Man". This <b>may</b> have <b>arisen</b> <b>from</b> {{the refusal}} of {{operative}} masons to pass their secrets to slaves, who could be ordered to divulge them to others. It <b>may</b> also have <b>arisen</b> <b>from</b> a requirement of early speculative lodges that a new Freemason should {{at least have a}} license to trade and employ others, making him a Free Man of the city or borough of the lodge.|$|R
25|$|Pheromonal cues aid {{synchronization}} of oestrus in many species; in women, synchronized menstruation <b>may</b> also <b>arise</b> <b>from</b> pheromonal cues, {{although the}} role of pheromones in humans is disputed.|$|R
25|$|Hans Reichenbach has {{proposed}} that the paradox <b>may</b> <b>arise</b> <b>from</b> considering space and time as separate entities. In a theory like general relativity, which presumes a single space-time continuum, the paradox may be blocked.|$|E
25|$|The {{effectiveness}} of dopamine re-uptake inhibitors in treating {{the symptoms of}} ADHD {{has led to the}} hypothesis that ADHD <b>may</b> <b>arise</b> <b>from</b> low tonic levels of dopamine (particularly in the fronto-limbic circuitry), but evidence in support of this theory is mixed.|$|E
25|$|The lunate has a {{variable}} shape. About one-third of lunate bones {{do not possess}} a medial facet, meaning they do not articulate with the hamate bone. Additionally, in about 20% of people, blood supply <b>may</b> <b>arise</b> <b>from</b> palmar vessels alone.|$|E

50|$|Both Peter Leonard (1833) and H.C. Adams (1883) {{suggest that}} the error <b>may</b> have <b>arisen</b> <b>from</b> a {{confusion}} with Annobón Island, which lies at the same latitude but at 5°38′E longitude.|$|R

25|$|Some earlier, {{published}} maps {{labeled the}} northern peak as Mt. Jefferson. Confusion <b>may</b> <b>arise</b> <b>from</b> {{the fact that}} the horizontal triangulation control station (VABM) named JEFFERSON is located on the southern peak, and this designation is found on many maps.|$|E
25|$|Sexual {{activity}} {{is a normal}} physiological function, but like other physical activity, it comes with risks.

25|$|First the {{situation}} is analysed, then ISPL proposes a number of risks which <b>may</b> <b>arise</b> <b>from</b> {{the situation}} at hand. With this information, an acquisition strategy can be formed to mitigate both the situation and risks {{in a number of}} areas.|$|E
50|$|Idiolectical (individual) or dialectical (based on context or on locale) {{variations}} may exist. Different families <b>may</b> also <b>arise</b> <b>from</b> the use {{of stock}} structures or of formulae such as stock phrases and motifs.|$|R

40|$|Ferromagnetism above room {{temperature}} {{was observed in}} Cr-doped hydrogenated amorphous silicon films deposited by rf magnetron-sputtering. Structure analysis reveals that films are amorphous without any detectable precipitates up to the solubility limit 16 atomic percentages of Cr. Experimental results suggest that hydrogenation has a dramatic influence on magnetic properties, electrical conductivity and carrier concentration in the thin films. Pronounced anomalous Hall effect and magnetization curve both suggest {{the origin of the}} ferromagnetism <b>may</b> <b>arises</b> <b>from</b> percolation of magnetic polarons.

25|$|Some {{theories}} believe many psychotic {{symptoms are}} {{a problem with the}} perception of ownership of internally generated thoughts and experiences. For example, the hallucination of hearing voices <b>may</b> <b>arise</b> <b>from</b> internally generated speech that is mislabeled by the psychotic person as coming from an external source.|$|E
25|$|Some modern maps {{show the}} {{junction}} spur extending {{as far as}} the Red Lion crossing. This is probably erroneous, but needs to be researched. The error <b>may</b> <b>arise</b> <b>from</b> the War Office having built the final stretch of line to New Quay that was authorised for the EKLR in 1911.|$|E
25|$|Vitiligo is a {{condition}} that causes depigmentation of sections of skin. It occurs when melanocytes die or are unable to function. The cause of vitiligo is unknown, but research suggests that it <b>may</b> <b>arise</b> <b>from</b> autoimmune, genetic, oxidative stress, neural, or viral causes. The incidence worldwide is less than 1%. Individuals affected by vitiligo sometimes suffer psychological discomfort because of their appearance.|$|E
50|$|The Qalandariya <b>may</b> have <b>arisen</b> <b>from</b> {{the earlier}} Malamatiyya and {{exhibited}} some Buddhist and Hindu influences in South Asia. The Malamatiya condemned {{the use of}} drugs and dressed only in blankets or in hip-length hairshirts.|$|R
50|$|Saint Hilary's own {{connection}} with Wales <b>arose</b> <b>from</b> confused accounts that he ordained Saint Cybi as a bishop, {{although the two}} were separated by two centuries.

50|$|This {{object is}} the namesake {{of a family}} of 13-76 asteroids that share similar {{spectral}} properties and orbital elements; hence they <b>may</b> have <b>arisen</b> <b>from</b> the same collisional event. All members have a relatively high orbital inclination.|$|R
