Wines was {{appointed}} to write a 582-page volume called Report on the Defective, Dependent, and Delinquent Classes of the Population of the United States, As Returned at the Tenth Census (June 1, 1880) (published 1888). Wines used seven categories of mental illness: dementia, dipsomania (uncontrollable craving for alcohol), epilepsy, mania, melancholia, <b>monomania</b> and paresis. These categories were also adopted by the Association.|$|E

Jeff Evans, writing in The Penguin TV Companion, observed that [...] "Slatt is certainly keen, but regrettably he is also unbalanced, tactless, clumsy, snobby, sarcastic, at times pointlessly aggressive and always prone to appalling errors of judgment (an academic version of Basil Fawlty, it was widely noted)". The Independent commented: [...] "Chalk is in the idiom of sadistic farce: disaster begets catastrophe begets apocalypse, and they all engulf Slatt. There are inevitable echoes of other sitcom characters - a dash of Basil Fawlty's unquenchable apoplexy, a slice of Gordon Brittas's purblind <b>monomania</b> - but Slatt's entanglements are caused by his own cocktail of failings." [...] Nicola Walker commented that viewers sympathise with Slatt because he {{is in charge of}} a bunch of lunatics. Moffat told The Herald that Slatt was inspired by a real person: ...|$|E
2500|$|... "Mr. Phillips", a French hypnotist {{living in}} London had been {{following}} the [...] "Werewolf of Allariz" [...] case through the reporting in French newspapers. Phillips wrote to José de Castro y Orozco, the Spanish Minister of Justice, stating that Romasanta was suffering from a <b>monomania</b> known as lycanthropy and was not responsible for his actions. He claimed that he had successfully treated the condition through hypnosis and asked that the execution be delayed so he could study the case. The Minister of Justice wrote to Queen Isabella II who personally commuted the death sentence to life imprisonment by Royal Order of 13 May 1854 and Romasanta was transferred to a prison in Celanova.|$|E

50|$|In {{the early}} 1800s, French {{psychiatrist}} Jean-Étienne Dominique Esquirol's lypemania, {{one of his}} affective <b>monomanias,</b> was the first elaboration on {{what was to become}} modern depression. The basis of the current conceptualisation of bipolar illness {{can be traced back to}} the 1850s; on January 31, 1854, Jules Baillarger described to the French Imperial Académie Nationale de Médecine a biphasic mental illness causing recurrent oscillations between mania and depression, which he termed folie à double forme (dual-form insanity). Two weeks later, on February 14, 1854, Jean-Pierre Falret presented a description to the Academy on what was essentially the same disorder, and which he called folie circulaire (circular insanity).|$|R
5000|$|Literary {{historian}} George Călinescu saw Mitică {{as a main}} {{representative of}} Balkan subjects in Ion Luca Caragiale's prose, and listed among the character's other traits his pessimism in respect to historical developments, {{as well as his}} interest in rallying people off the street and imposing his ideas on them. He defined the latter aspect as [...] "southern", and noted that, like other heroes of Caragiale's sketches, Mitică is [...] "at the antipode of Romanticism", and inhabits a place where [...] "Gothic meditation does not flourish". In his history of the Junimea literary society, Z. Ornea argued that there was a link between Mitică's personality and Caragiale's strong rejection of nationalism:"Caragiale's mitici are jovial, good-natured characters, easy-going in their thought and behavior. Solemnity does not suit them and fanatical <b>monomanias</b> are unimaginable in this context. An ecstatically nationalist Mitică is a contradiction in terms, since his formula in life is accommodation, adaption to the situations." ...|$|R
2500|$|From 26 April to May 1867, The Times {{reported}} {{the case of}} Smith and Others v Tebbitt and Others, in which Sarah Tebbitt and two nieces contested her Will [...] "on the grounds of undue execution, incapacity and undue influence." [...] At the hearing, the legatees declared Ann sane whereas those {{left out of the}} Will, led by Ann's nephew, recounted her religious delusions. It was during this case that the unmarried situation of Ann Thwaytes's mother came to light, because illegitimacy might put Sarah Tebbitt's position of rightful heir in doubt. On 6 August 1867 the judge cited <b>monomania</b> as her illness, and found that she was of unsound mind when signing her Will, thus making it invalid. He said, however, that if she had been found to have been in sound mind, there remained the question of possible undue influence by the Smith brothers, putting the validity of the Will doubly in doubt.|$|E

"This {{national}} {{characteristic of}} the English to shout: 'Help, they are killing us!' when nobody even thinks of touching them, is disgusting… But if this trait is notable even in England, how much more so is it in India? Here suspicion has become a <b>monomania.</b> Anglo-Indians see Russian spies even in their own shoes, and this drives them to madness… They watch every new arrival from one province to another, even should he be an Englishman. People have been deprived not only of every weapon, but of all knives and axes. The peasant can hardly chop his wood, or protect himself from a tiger. But the English are still afraid. It is true that here there are but 60,000 of them, while the native population numbers 245 million. And their system which they took over from successful animal-tamers, is good only until the animal senses his tamer is fearful in his turn… Then his hour has come! At all events, such a manifestation of chronic fear merely admits a recognition of one's own weakness." ...|$|E
2500|$|A {{significant}} structural {{device is}} {{the series of}} nine meetings (gams) between the Pequod and other ships. These meetings are important in three ways. First, their placement in the narrative. The initial two meetings and the last two are both close to each other. The central group of five gams are separated by about 12 chapters, more or less. This pattern provides a structural element, remarks Bezanson, as if the encounters were [...] "bones to the book's flesh". Second, Ahab's developing responses to the meetings plot the [...] "rising curve of his passion" [...] and of his <b>monomania.</b> Third, in contrast to Ahab, Ishmael interprets the significance of each ship individually: [...] "each ship is a scroll which the narrator unrolls and reads." [...] Bezanson sees no single way {{to account for the}} meaning of all of these ships. Instead, they may be interpreted as [...] "a group of metaphysical parables, a series of biblical analogues, a masque of the situation confronting man, a pageant of the humors within men, a parade of the nations, and so forth,'as well as concrete and symbolic ways of thinking about the White Whale".|$|E
40|$|In {{descriptive}} and historical study, {{some examples of}} the models of psychiatric classifications in Brazil are presented, starting from the absorption of the European standards of the time and, evolutively, until to arrive it the Brazilian classification sketches. In the initial section, a parallel is drew between historical and social facts, of Europe and Brazil, since {{the discovery of the}} last one. This is done in order to relate the historical times approached with the evolution of the classification conceptions of the mental diseases by the societies, at different times. In the sequence, they are described, effectively, the importations of the classification psychiatric concepts of Europe and attempts of Brazilian alienists in 19 century and beginning of 20 century. The discussion is extended to the sequences of this process, in the course of 20 century. The first classification sketch is done by dr. Domingos José Cunha, practitioner of the Santa Casa de Misericórdia de São João del-Rei, in Minas Gerais, in the year of 1817. In this classification list is a miscellany of diagnosis, which are reproduced from European authors, which associated at popular jargons as little judgment and furious crazy. Effectively, the first Brazilian classification synthesis occurs in thesis of Antonio Luiz da Silva Peixoto, in 1837, when the adaptation of the classification of Esquirol is observed, with the incorporation of the lypemanias in the group of the <b>monomanias.</b> The first psychiatric classification of Brazilian author happens in 1876, with Nuno de Andrade, a alienist with mental orientation. In this classification, from the influences of Heinroth and Guislain, an ideological trend to the mental orientation is inferred, in opposition to the increasing of the organic orientation in that time. In conclusion, in despite of the majority and prevalent importation of international psychiatric classification standards, since the primordial of alienism in Brazil, an inclination always existed to classify the mental diseases in accordance with certain Brazilian particularities...|$|R
6000|$|An idealistic {{intellectual}} remarked {{recently that}} there were a great many things in the creed for which he had no use. He might just as well have said {{that there were}} a great many things in the Encyclopedia Britannica for which he had no use. It would probably have occurred to him that the work in question was meant for humanity and not for him. But even {{in the case of the}} Encyclopedia, it will often be found a stimulating exercise to read two articles on two widely different subjects and note where they touch. In fact there is really a great deal to be said for the man in Pickwick who read first about China and then about metaphysics and combined his information. But however this may be in the famous case of Chinese metaphysics, it is this which is chiefly lacking in Arabian metaphysics. They suffer, as I have said of the palm-tree in the desert, from a lack of the vitality that comes from complexity, and of the complexity that comes from comparison. They suffer from having been in a single movement in a single direction; from having begun as a mood and ended rather as a mode, that is a mere custom or fashion. But any modern Christian thus criticising the Moslem movement will do well to criticise himself and his world at the same time. For in truth most modern things are mere movements in the same sense as the Moslem movement. They are at best fashions, in which one thing is exaggerated because it has been neglected. They are at worst mere <b>monomanias,</b> in which everything is neglected that one thing may be exaggerated. Good or bad, they are alike movements which in their nature can only move for a certain distance and then stop. Feminism, for instance, is in its nature a movement, and one that must stop somewhere. But the Suffragettes no more established a philosophy of the sexes by their feminism than the Arabs did by their anti-feminism. A woman can find her home on the hustings even less than in the harem; but such movements do not really attempt to find a final home for anybody or anything. Bolshevism is a movement; and in my opinion a very natural and just movement considered as a revolt against the crude cruelty of Capitalism. But when we find the Bolshevists making a rule that the drama [...] "must encourage the proletarian spirit," [...] it is obvious that those who say so are not only maniacs but, what is more to the point here, are monomaniacs. Imagine having to apply that principle, let us say, to [...] "Charley's Aunt." [...] None of these things seek to establish a complete philosophy such as Aquinas founded on Aristotle. The only two modern men who attempted it were Comte and Herbert Spencer. Spencer, I think, was too small a man to do it at all; and Comte was a great enough man to show how difficult it is to do it in modern times. None of these movements can do anything but move; they have not discovered where to rest.|$|R
