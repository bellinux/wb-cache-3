500|$|Her Jewish {{upbringing}} {{was influenced}} by her devoutly Orthodox Jewish maternal grandmother. Barr's parents kept their Jewish heritage secret from their neighbors and were partially involved in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Barr has stated, [...] "Friday, Saturday, and Sunday morning I was a Jew; Sunday afternoon, Tuesday afternoon, and Wednesday afternoon we were Mormons". [...] When Barr was three years old, she got Bell's palsy {{on the left side}} of her face. Barr said, [...] " [...] <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>called</b> in a rabbi to pray for me, but nothing happened. Then my mother got a Mormon preacher, he prayed, and I was miraculously cured". Years later Barr learned that Bell's palsy was usually temporary and that the Mormon preacher came [...] "exactly at the right time". [...] At six years old, Barr discovered her first public stage by lecturing at LDS churches around Utah and even was elected president of a Mormon youth group.|$|E
2500|$|Vanna was a feminist, socialist, pacifist and {{vegetarian}} with {{an active}} intellectual life, reading books mostly on history, current events, and biography. [...] She {{was born to}} Italian immigrant parents in Philadelphia in 1893. She {{dropped out of high}} school because her family could not afford to buy her a coat, so she was essentially self-educated. [...] She did not marry until relatively late in life in 1924, marrying a fruit and produce merchant, Robert Venturi, Sr. [...] Her only child, Robert, Jr. was born in 1925. [...] Possibly because of her liberal views she perceived herself as an [...] "outsider" [...] and became a Quaker. Robert, Jr. said [...] "I never went to public school: pledging allegiance to the flag - 'coercive patriotism' <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>called</b> it - was anathema to her." [...] The family made summer trips to Arden, Delaware and Rose Valley, Pennsylvania, two communities organized by architect Will Price who was inspired by the Arts and Crafts Movement and the then-radical economics of Henry George. [...] In Rose Valley the family attended plays by George Bernard Shaw at the Hedgerow Theater.|$|E

60|$|One {{night as}} I lay buried in deep sleep {{close to the}} garret eaves I heard <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>call</b> me--and {{something}} in her voice pierced me, roused me. A poignant note of alarm was in it.|$|R
60|$|Now, {{seeing that}} I was not wanted, I took my cudgel {{and started down}} the {{bridle-path}} towards the common footbridge, when suddenly <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>called</b> me back.|$|E
60|$|I {{was running}} {{to the door to}} welcome him, when <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>called</b> me back. I turned and looked at her. She smiled. So did I. Without uttering a word we both sat down to finish our breakfast.|$|E
6000|$|My brother went his way {{to consult}} {{with some of the}} other volunteers, and <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>called</b> for her sedan chair to go and see whether she could get an order from Queen Henrietta to stop him, while Annora exclaimed: ...|$|E
6000|$|I {{played there}} were no deeper seas, [...] Nor any wider plains than these, [...] Nor other kings than me. [...] At last I heard <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>call</b> [...] Out from the house at evenfall, [...] To call me home to tea.|$|R
6000|$|... "I believe I {{was asleep}} at that time, and dreaming about something, though I don't {{remember}} what it was. I started up and reached {{out as far as}} I could over the boot, and looked down. I found it was <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>calling</b> to me.|$|R
6000|$|... "But we are alone--practically," [...] Lady Mary declared. [...] "I am {{sure you}} wouldn't count Mr. Montague, and Mr. Pratt is an old friend.--One moment, there's <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>calling.</b> Don't move, either of you, or we shall have to sit in that stuffy drawing-room all the evening." ...|$|R
6000|$|Her mother laughed, {{and then}} added, with a sigh: [...] "I {{used to like}} {{to get hold of}} a good book when I was a girl; but we weren't allowed to read many novels in those days. <b>My</b> <b>mother</b> <b>called</b> them all LIES. And I guess she wasn't so very far wrong about some of them." ...|$|E
6000|$|She half rose in {{response}} to his questioning bow, and he motioned her to her seat again. [...] "I had to keep you waiting," [...] he said. [...] "I was up all night with a patient, and I was asleep when <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>called</b> me." [...] He stopped here, and definitively waited for her to begin.|$|E
6000|$|Sunset came at last, {{but still}} he drove {{steadily}} on through the sparse settlements. Just at nightfall {{we came to a}} beautiful little stream, and stopped to let the horses drink. I heard its rippling, reassuring song on the pebbles. Thereafter all is dim and vague to me until <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>called</b> out sharply, [...] "Wake up, children! Here we are!" ...|$|E
2500|$|Lennon's {{first wife}} Cynthia Lennon denounced the book, stating [...] "Every single person was annihilated. <b>My</b> <b>mother</b> was <b>called</b> a bulldog and a domineering woman, which was nothing—nothing—like <b>my</b> <b>mother.</b> And he <b>called</b> me a spaniel. I thought, I'd rather be a spaniel than a Rottweiler, {{which is what}} he was." ...|$|R
50|$|Everyone {{has always}} called me Joe. Friends, family, everyone. Only <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> ever <b>called</b> me Johannes.|$|R
60|$|That was my name, Jesse. I did {{not know}} my surname, though I heard <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>call</b> <b>my</b> father John. I have a dim {{recollection}} of hearing, {{at one time or}} another, the other men address my father as Captain. I knew that he was the leader of this company, and that his orders were obeyed by all.|$|R
6000|$|These {{things had}} {{happened}} two days before; now John was dying, {{and the letter}} had not come. I had been summoned to many death beds in my life, but to none that made my heart ache as it did then, since <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>called</b> me to watch the departure of a spirit akin to this in its gentleness and patient strength. As I went in, John stretched out both hands: ...|$|E
6000|$|My {{mother was}} a Circassian by birth, who in early youth had been torn [...] away from her home. Her {{father had been a}} farmer, and she had always [...] lived peacefully with her parents and her little brother and sister. [...] War broke out suddenly, and the country was overrun by marauding [...] bands. On their approach, the family fled into an {{underground}} place, [...] as <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>called</b> it--she probably meant a cellar, which is not [...] known in Zanzibar. Their place of refuge was, however, invaded by a [...] merciless horde, the parents were slain, and the children carried off [...] by three mounted Arnauts.|$|E
60|$|One {{afternoon}} chance led me {{into the}} little room which <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>called</b> her own, a room I seldom entered. There was a small volume lying {{on the table and}} carelessly I took it up and glanced at the title. Then, with a quick exclamation of pleasure, I carried it away with me. It was Mr. Ravenor's first little volume of poems, which I had tried in vain to get. The Mellborough bookseller of whom I had ordered it {{told me that it was}} out of print. The first edition had been exhausted long since and the author had refused to allow a second edition to be issued.|$|E
6000|$|... "The christening {{came too}} late," [...] he said. [...] "O lady, {{you who are}} so good and pitiful, let <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> get back her true Peregrine--a straight-limbed, comely dullard, such as would be welcome to her. She would bless and thank you, and for me, to be a Will-of-the-wisp, or what not, would be far better than the life I lead. Never did I know what <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>calls</b> peace till I lay here." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>My</b> <b>mother</b> was <b>called</b> and came; and I {{could not}} help {{thinking}} how insignificant she looked with her pale face and plain dark frock, standing stiffly beside this shining lady in her rustling clothes.|$|R
6000|$|... 'The White Ribaumonts,' said Berenger, 'and, moreover, <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> was <b>called</b> the Swan of England; {{my little}} sisters have skins like snow. Ah! Madame, though I have failed, I go away far happier than if I had succeeded.|$|R
60|$|The {{only person}} I expected, however, was my cousin Ulick, {{who was to}} bring me the welcome {{intelligence}} of Lady Lyndon's arrival; and I own, after two days' close confinement at Bray, in which I narrated all the adventures {{of my life to}} my mother, and succeeded in making her accept the dresses she had formerly refused, and a considerable addition to her income which I was glad to make, I was very glad when I saw that reprobate Ulick Brady, as <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>called</b> him, ride up to the door in my carriage with the welcome intelligence for my mother, that the young lord was out of danger; and for me, that the Countess of Lyndon had arrived in Dublin.|$|E
6000|$|... "In a {{short time}} <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>called</b> that she and Aline were ready. We were about {{to leave the room}} and hurry away, when {{suddenly}} seven rough knaves, inflamed by wine, rushed in. The leader of them said that they saw we were people of quality, and that he would take us down before Wat the Tyler, who would {{know how to deal with}} us; but before doing so he and his crew would give the ladies some kisses, and thereupon he seized Aline roughly. I was in the act of drawing my sword, when Edgar dealt him so terrible a blow with the hilt of his that the man fell dead. Then there was a general fight. Edgar shouted to my mother and Aline to run up the steps to the platform above, and to me to hold the stairs, while he placed his back to the door.|$|E
6000|$|... "No; we must {{be thankful}} {{that we have a}} home at all, and are not like so many, who are {{actually}} come to beggary, like poor Mrs. Forde. You remember her, our old clergyman's widow. He died on board ship, and she was sent for by her cousin, who promised her a home; but she had no money, and was forced to walk all the way, with her two little boys, getting a lodging at night from any loyal family who would shelter her for the love of heaven. My mother wept when she saw how sadly she was changed; we kept her with us a week to rest her, and when she went she had our last gold carolus, little guessing, poor soul, that it was our last. Then, when she was gone, <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>called</b> us all round her, and gave thanks that she could still give us shelter and daily bread." ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{lieutenant}} {{brought his}} heels together, and bent low. [...] "I beg her pardon {{with all my}} heart. I am very, very sorry. I will do anything I can. I would like to stop that. May I bring <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> to <b>call</b> on Miss Gerald?" ...|$|R
60|$|Finally <b>my</b> <b>mother,</b> <b>calling</b> in Solivet, {{came to the}} {{following}} arrangement, since it was plain that we must part with our inmates. Cecile and her children were to be installed in the Hotel d'Aubepine, to which her husband did not object, since he would be either in attendance on the Prince, or with his regiment. This was better than sending her either to a convent or to the country, since she would still be within our reach, although to our great vexation we could not prevail {{so far as to}} hinder Madame Croquelebois from being installed as her duenna, the intendant himself returning to La Vendee.|$|R
6000|$|... "He was {{an officer}} of the States in the war of the revolution, of my own name of course; <b>my</b> <b>mother's</b> brother was <b>called</b> Duncan Uncas Heyward." ...|$|R
60|$|The next afternoon, {{which was}} Sunday, we went, all except {{my brother and}} sister, who had what <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>called</b> Puritan notions as to Sunday, to see royalty walk in the Tuileries gardens. The Queen was there, slowly pacing along {{with one of her}} sons on each side, and {{beautiful}} boys they were, in their rich dresses of blue velvet and white satin, with rich lace garnishings, their long fair hair on their shoulders, and their plumed hats less often on their heads than in their hands, as they gracefully acknowledged the homage that met them at each step. Perhaps I thought my Gaspard quite as beautiful, but every widow's only son is THE king of her heart; and we had so trained the boy that he did his part to perfection kneeling and kissing the hand which King Louis extended to him. Yet it had--to me who was fresh to such scenes--something of the air of a little comedy, to see such gestures of respect between the two children so splendidly dressed, and neither of them yet nine years old.|$|E
60|$|Some gallants {{indeed there}} were to ruffle it as sprucely as ever, {{and there were a}} few who had taken service as musketeers or archers of the guard; but these were at that time few, for the King was still living, and they did not despair of an {{accommodation}} which would soon bring them home again. As my mother had predicted, the gentlemen with the ragged lace tried in vain to affect indifference to the good things on the buffet, till they had done their devoir by me as their hostess. Eustace and Nan were on the watch and soon were caring for them, and heaping their plates with food, and then it was that my sister's face began to light up, and I knew her for herself again, while there was a general sound of full gruff English voices all round, harsh and cracking <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>called</b> it, but Nan said it was perfect music to her, and I think she began to forgive me when she found that to me likewise it had a sound of home.|$|E
6000|$|... "A good man--a {{wonderful}} man," [...] said Mirah, {{with slow}} emphasis, trying {{to master the}} agitation which made her voice more tremulous as she went on. She felt urged to prepare her father for the complete penetration of himself which awaited him. [...] "But he was very poor when my friends found him for me--a poor workman. Once--twelve years ago--he was strong and happy, going to the East, which he loved to think of; and <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>called</b> him back because--because she had lost me. And he went to her, {{and took care of}} her through great trouble, and worked for her till she died--died in grief. And Ezra, too, had lost his health and strength. The cold had seized him coming back to my mother, because she was forsaken. For years he has been getting weaker--always poor, always working--but full of knowledge, and great-minded. All who come near him honor him. To stand before him is like standing before a prophet of God"--Mirah ended with difficulty, her heart throbbing--"falsehoods are no use." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "True," [...] she replied. [...] "There's {{not much}} good in {{thinking}} of it now. It was unfortunate, by the way, that <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> had me <b>called</b> Castalia." ...|$|R
6000|$|... --'Er--We {{miss you}} very much. We all miss you. We {{wish you were}} here to see the darling baby. Ah, Alfred, how happy we were when you stayed with us. We all loved you so much. <b>My</b> <b>mother</b> will <b>call</b> the baby Alfred so that we shall never forget you--' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> {{will soon}} <b>call</b> to see you; and, meantime, I'll {{tell you what}} I'll do. I'll write--just any cheerful {{nonsense}} that comes into my head--shall I?" ...|$|R
