So the aim {{of this study was to}} analyze the association between counselling of pregnant womc-en at Lithuanian pharmacies about rational use of <b>medicinal</b> <b>substances</b> and pharmacy specialist’s age and educational background. Methods. Random sample of Lithuanian pharmacy specialists (N = 440) was anonymously questioned during the period of March-October, 2012. “FIP reference paper on the effective utilization of phar-macists in improving maternal, newborn and child health ” was used for the development of questions about the counselling of pregnant women about ra-tional use of <b>medicinal</b> <b>substances.</b> Results. The odds ratio of more frequent counselling was higher in the case of millennial generation comh-paring with baby boomers (OR = 3. 521 (CI 95 % = 6. 135 – 2. 020)). Higher proportion of pharmacists, compared to pharmacy technicians (p< 0. 05), were counselling about rational use of synthetized medict-inal substances and non-pharmacological alternas-tives (millennial generation) and almost all topics of rational use of <b>medicinal</b> <b>substances</b> (baby boom-ers).

40|$|This paper summarises the {{development}} of pharmacology in the Graeco-Roman world. The number of medicinal plants recorded almost trebled between 400 BC (the Hippocratic writings) and AD 250 as the Greeks and Romans discovered more about the regions beyond the Mediterranean. The transfer of <b>medicinal</b> <b>substances</b> was almost entirely from East to West, and from South to North with Alexandria and, later, Rome as the major entrepôts. Two Greek writers were of great importance because they were translated into Syriac, Arabic, and Latin, among other languages, and set the agenda for subsequent work in pharmacology. The descriptions of <b>medicinal</b> <b>substances</b> by Pedanius Dioscorides (fl. AD 67) created a model that others followed down to the 17 th century. Galen theorized about {{the way in which}} drugs worked, and his suggestion that one might correlate illnesses and drugs in terms of four degrees of intensity (a suggestion never followed through systematically by Galen himself) led in the Middle Ages to the classification and investigation of drugs in these terms...|$|R
