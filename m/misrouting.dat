50|$|Deletion of pioneer axons which {{create the}} {{scaffold}} {{have an effect}} on the growth cones of the neurons of the nucleus of the posterior commissure, in that they cannot follow the normal path of extending ventrally, then posteriorly. Despite the compromised pioneer neuron scaffold, the follower growth cones extend ventrally normally. However, around half of the followers do not follow the posterior longitudinal path correctly, while the other half do. This suggests that other cues other than those from pioneer axons play a role in guiding follower axon growth, and that pioneer axons may play different roles in different parts of neuronal development. In a different study, replacement or removal of the early-born retinal ganglion cells, which function as pioneer neurons, had a significantly deleterious effect on the ability of later axons to exit the eye.

30|$|Reelin is a {{secreted}} extracellular glycoprotein with N-terminal f-spondin {{domain and}} C-terminal rich in positive charged amino acid group (D’Arcangelo et al., 1995; D’Arcangelo et al., 1997). The genomic organization of Reelin is highly similar between mice and human, implying evolutionary conservation in the gene structure (Royaux et al., 1997). This gene came into sight {{when it was}} discovered to function in the synaptic development of neurons such as plasticity, polarization and targeting (Borrell et al., 1999; Matsuki et al., 2010; Rogers et al., 2011). In a chip screening study aimed at capturing differentially expressing genes between dLGN and vLGN, reelin gene is identified to involve in nuclei-specific axon guidance. Reelin binds to very-low-density lipoproteins receptor (VLDLR) and low-density lipoproteins receptor-related protein 8 (LRP 8) in vivo. After binding to these receptors, Reelin activates disabled- 1 (Dab 1) to function downstream (Howell et al., 1997; Sheldon et al., 1997; Trommsdorff et al., 1999). In reln −/− mutant, two striking defects are found at P 1. First, there is a gap between IGL and the medial-lateral part of vLGN, which {{may be caused by}} the reduced projection from RGCs, and this reduction in RGC innervation leads to the shrink in the vLGN territory; another abnormality is a large number of <b>misrouted</b> axons originating from both eyes’ intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cell (ipRGCs) at the vLGN, but axons aiming at the dLGN is unaffected (Su et al., 2011). This confirms the function of reelin in specific targeting at vLGN and IGL but not dLGN. Reduced targeting in IGL and <b>misrouted</b> fibers also exist in 50 % Dab 1 mutant at a less modest degree compared to reln −/− mice, while in the other half, only <b>misrouted</b> axons are found, again less than those in reln −/− mutant.|$|R
50|$|Since freight sent via LTL {{carriers}} {{is subject}} to <b>misrouting</b> or misloading {{it is a good}} practice to put the tracking number on each side of each piece of freight. If the destination state and zipcode are affixed to each side as well, misloading is less likely to occur. Even though it is not required it is good practice to affix a relatively large label including four letter carrier code, tracking number, destination station, and destination zipcode of the shipment (i.e. ABFS123456789 GA 30301). The easier it is for dockworkers to identify an individual shipment the less likely it is to be put in the wrong place. The value or type of contents should not be advertised on the package to help reduce losses. If the only piece of identification is the tracking number the dockworker will have a harder time identifying the shipments pieces and as such the chances of freight being loaded onto the wrong trailer is greater thereby increasing the transit time and also increasing the chances of the shipment being lost. Proper labels, bar codes, and RFID are important for proper routing and delivery.|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE: The optokinetic {{system in}} healthy humans is a negative-feedback system that stabilizes gaze: slow-phase eye {{movements}} (i. e., the output signal) minimize retinal slip (i. e., the error signal). A positive-feedback optokinetic system may exist {{due to the}} <b>misrouting</b> of optic fibers. Previous studies have shown that, in a zebrafish mutant {{with a high degree}} of the <b>misrouting,</b> the optokinetic response (OKR) is reversed. As a result, slow-phase eye movements amplify retinal slip, forming a positive-feedback optokinetic loop. The positive-feedback optokinetic system cannot stabilize gaze, thus leading to spontaneous eye oscillations (SEOs). Because the <b>misrouting</b> in human patients (e. g., with a condition of albinism or achiasmia) is partial, both positive- and negative-feedback loops co-exist. How this co-existence affects human ocular motor behavior remains unclear. METHODS: We presented a visual environment consisting of two stimuli in different parts of the visual field to healthy subjects. One mimicked positive-feedback optokinetic signals and the other preserved negative-feedback optokinetic signals. By changing the ratio and position of the visual field of these visual stimuli, various optic nerve <b>misrouting</b> patterns were simulated. Eye-movement responses to stationary and moving stimuli were measured and compared with computer simulations. The SEOs were correlated with the magnitude of the virtual positive-feedback optokinetic effect.

40|$|Introduction: Obstetric Brachial Plexus Lesion (OBPL) is {{characterized}} by diminished motor and sensory function. These may be worsened by misrouted nerve fibres and faulty formation of central motor programmes. The latter is treated with triceps injections of botulinum toxins, which is aimed at inactivating misrouted nerve fibres in the triceps, which increases biceps function. Increased biceps use is believed to lead to better formation of the central motor programmes. However, the current electrical stimulation brachial plexus (ESBP) method for measurement of co-contraction has four major shortcomings preventing it from use in the clinical setting to determine whether an OBPL patient would benefit from the injections or not. Therefore, the new method for the measurement of co-contraction should fulfil the following requirements: 1. is able to quantify motor <b>misrouting</b> 2. is able to quantify sensory <b>misrouting</b> and 3. quantifies <b>misrouting</b> at different voluntary force levels, and 4. is easily applicable in clinical practice. In this study we investigated whether measuring short-range-stiffness (SRS) at the elbow level fulfils these requirements. SRS is the stiffness induced by a fast stretch and which lasts for a certain stretch distance (the elastic limit), varies proportionally with muscle force and is likely attributed to the elastic elongation of attached cross-bridges. Methods: Seven controls (2 men, median (25 th – 75 th) age 28 y (21 - 52)) and five OBPL patients (1 man, median (25 th – 75 th) age 31 y (24 - 50)) were investigated. The OBPL patients were further divided in two groups according to the ESBP method for measurement of biceps misrouting: a group of two OBPL patients without <b>misrouting</b> {{and a group of}} three OBPL patients with <b>misrouting.</b> Subjects were instructed to maintain a constant elbow torque in flexion direction at different levels (0, 2. 1, 4. 3 and 6. 4 Nm). The elbow was suddenly and quickly extended and SRS was estimated from the resulting torque responses using a mechanical model for the elbow joint. The rotation stimulus (t = 0 ms) was used for two purposes: 1) to estimate SRS as a measure for motor <b>misrouting</b> and 2) to induce a stretch reflex. The elbow was returned to its original angle by an opposite displacement (shortening stimulus) and SRS was again estimated from the shorting torque response. SRS during that shortening stimulus should reflect the effect of the stretch reflex and was therefore taken as a measure for sensory <b>misrouting.</b> The timing of the shortening stimulus was varied (t = 130, 150, 180 and 200 ms) to search for the expected peak in the stretch reflex response. Similar stimuli but in the opposite direction were used during elbow extension torque. Activation ratios (AR) were calculated from the EMG measurements of the biceps and triceps to quantify the relative participation of agonist and antagonist in performing the task. The Kruskal-Willis test was used to compare SRS and AR between controls, patients without <b>misrouting</b> and patients with <b>misrouting.</b> The biceps motor <b>misrouting</b> according to the ESBP method was plotted in a scatter plot against SRS for flexion torque 6. 4 Nm. Results: VAF were high and parameter SEM were low for the SRS measurement of the first flank (t = 0 ms). High VAF and SEM values indicted the model was adequate and the parameters were reliable. Median SRS was higher in patients with <b>misrouting</b> than in controls. ARs for the biceps and the triceps were lower in patients with <b>misrouting</b> than in controls. Kruskal-Willis test of SRS and AR did not show {{a significant difference between the}} groups. The scatter plot of the SRS for flexion torque 6. 4 Nm and the biceps <b>misrouting</b> according to the ESBP method showed that SRS is not able to discern between the patients and control subjects on the individual level. VAF were high and parameter SEM were low overall for the second stimulus SRS measurement (t = 130, 150, 180 and 200 ms) except for t = 130 ms during flexion. Median SRS is not consistently higher or lower in patients with <b>misrouting</b> compared to controls during either flexion or extension and the Kruskal-Willis test shows no significant difference between the two groups. Conclusion: With the SRS method it is possible to quantify motor <b>misrouting</b> for different voluntary force levels on a group level, and it is easily applicable in clinical practice. The higher median SRS and lower AR in patients compared to control subjects for the same torques suggest there is motor <b>misrouting</b> in patients. Though, the method should be improved before it can be applied on the individual level: The great spread of the data may be reduced by more repetitions of the SRS measurement. It is unclear whether sensory <b>misrouting</b> was present or not, though if present, we were able to measure its effect reliably and we found that it did not have an effect on SRS and thus probably does not lead to an apparent decrease of function in this OBPL patient population.

One of (he patients had primary ciliary dyskinesia arid situs inversus totalis (Kartagener syndrome). Methods: Fundus photographs were token and the angles {{at which the}} main temporal arterial branches leave the optic nerve head (ONH) were analysed. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) was performed through the presumed foveal region. Pattern onset visually evoked potentials (VEPs) (check sizes 60 ', 40 / 400 ms) were recorded and the chiasmal coefficient was calculated to detect <b>misrouting.</b> Results: Fundus photography showed normally pigmented fundi with absence of the usual foveal hyperpigmentation, foveal avascular zone, and mocular and foveal reflexes. On OCT no foveal pit was found. The VEP recordings showed the largest positive CI component over the right hemisphere for the left eye, and over the left hemisphere tor the right eye, with the CI almost absent over the ipsilateral hemispheres. The differential derivations showed opposite polarity for the recordings of the two eyes. The chiasmal coefficients of all three patients were significantly indicative of <b>misrouting</b> (- 0. 99, - 0. 91, and - 0. 99, respectively).

40|$|Abstract—High-radix {{hierarchical}} {{networks are}} cost-effective topologies for large scale computers. In such net-works, routers are organized in supernodes, with {{local and global}} interconnections. These networks, known as Dragon-flies, outperform traditional topologies such as multi-trees or tori, in cost and scalability. However, depending on the traffic pattern, network congestion can lead to degraded performance. <b>Misrouting</b> (non-minimal routing) can be em-ployed to avoid saturated global or local links. Nevertheless, with the current deadlock avoidance mechanisms used for these networks, supporting <b>misrouting</b> implies routers with {{a larger number of}} virtual channels. This exacerbates the buffer memory requirements that constitute one of the main constraints in high-radix switches. In this paper we introduce two novel deadlock-free routing mechanisms for Dragonfly networks that support on-the-fly adaptive routing.

40|$|In {{albinism}} a {{large proportion}} of nerve fibres originating in temporal retina cross the midline at the chiasm and project to the contralateral hemisphere. Studies in rodents with albinism have suggested that the extent of this <b>misrouting</b> at the chiasm is inversely related to pigmentation levels. Here, we examine whether there is evidence for a similar relationship in humans with albinism. Functional MRI was performed on 18 subjects with albinism, 17 control subjects and six controls with nystagmus as they underwent hemifield visual stimulation of nasal or temporal retina. Functional activation in 16 coronal slices beginning at the posterior occipital lobes were analysed and the extent of hemispheric response lateralization at each slice position was determined. During temporal retina stimulation, the control response was lateralized to the hemisphere ipsilateral to the stimulated eye for all slices. In albinos, the response in posterior slices was predominantly in the contralateral hemisphere, consistent with <b>misrouting</b> of temporal retina fibres. However, as slice location became progressively anterior, response lateralization reverted to the ipsilateral hemisphere. The slice location at which the transition from contra- to ipsilateralization occurred provided an estimate of the extent of fibre <b>misrouting</b> in the individual. The slice transition location correlated negatively with pigmentation level, providing the first evidence for a relationship between pigmentation and the extent of <b>misrouting</b> in humans with albinism...|$|E

Interestingly, retrograde labeling shows that the presumptive back tracing target the dorsal thalamus is replaced by the lateral ventrobasal. Meanwhile, the histology of the cortex is unchanged, as well as the retina projections which also have a large amount of Semaphorin- 6 A expression. However, in the early postnatal stage, many of the cortex-projecting dLGN axons follow a different route, which is probably due to their mispositioning at the embryonic stage (Little et al., 2009). Among these axons arriving at the visual cortex, some of them are <b>misrouted</b> to the superficial layer of the cortex.

Its etiology and pathomechanism is largely unknown, but <b>misrouting</b> of the optic nerve has been observed in some patients. Likewise, optic nerve <b>misrouting,</b> a reversed OKR and SOs with INS-like waveforms are observed in zebrafish belladonna (bel) mutants. We aimed to investigate whether and how <b>misrouting</b> of the optic nerve correlates with the ocular motor behaviors in bel larvae. OKR and SOs were quantified and subsequently the optic nerve fibers were stained with fluorescent lipophilic dyes. Eye velocity during OKR was reduced in larvae with few misprojecting optic nerve fibers and reversed in larvae with a substantial fraction of misprojecting fibers. All larvae with reversed OKR also displayed SOs. A stronger reversed OKR correlated with more frequent SOs. Since {{we did not find}} a correlation between additional retinal defects and ocular motor behavior, we suggest that axon <b>misrouting</b> is in fact origin of INS in the zebrafish animal model. Depending on the ratio between misprojecting ipsilateral and correctly projecting contralateral fibers, the negative feedback loop normally regulating OKR can turn into a positive loop, resulting in an increase in retinal slip. Our data not only give new insights into the etiology of INS but may also be of interest for studies on how the brain deals with and adapts to conflicting inputs...|$|E

Boyce becomes disillusioned with the U.S. government through his new position, especially after reading a <b>misrouted</b> communiqué dealing with the CIA's plan to depose the Prime Minister of Australia. Frustrated by this duplicity, Boyce decides to repay his government by passing classified secrets to the Soviets.|$|R
40|$|Mobile Ad-hoc {{networks}} (MANETs) {{are inherently}} prone to security attacks, with node mobility being {{the primary cause}} in allowing security breaches. This makes the network susceptible to Byzantyne faults with packets getting <b>misrouted</b> or dropped. This paper proposes solutions using an unobtrusive monitoring technique to locate malicious or faulty nodes that misroute or drop packets. This technique uses information from different network layers to detect malicious nodes. Any single node can use unobtrusive monitoring without relying on the cooperation of other nodes, making this technique easy to implement and deploy. Simulations of MANETs containing malicious nodes indicate that this technique has a high detection effectiveness with low false positive rate...|$|R
5000|$|In {{the week}} finalist Chris Daughtry was voted off, some voters claimed that phone calls dialed for Daughtry {{during the first}} few minutes of voting were <b>misrouted</b> to Katharine McPhee's lines, and they heard her {{recorded}} message thanking them for voting. Other voters claimed similar problems voting for other contestants, in some cases resulting in votes going to Daughtry that were intended for another contestant, Elliott Yamin. It is not clear whether votes were actually tabulated for the wrong contestant, or if the [...] "Thank you for voting for me" [...] messages that callers heard were merely incorrectly assigned but votes would still have counted for the correct contestant.|$|R
