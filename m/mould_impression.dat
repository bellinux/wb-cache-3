40|$|AbstractINTRODUCTIONThe {{creation}} of ear moulds for hearing aids {{is generally considered}} a safe and routine procedure for trained professionals. In the literature {{there are reports of}} otological complications caused by hearing aid <b>mould</b> <b>impression</b> material in the middle ear cavity but such complications are considered rare. PRESENTATION OF CASEWe present the case of a patient in whom impression material entered the middle ear through a perforation of the tympanic membrane during the process of making a hearing aid mould and review how this was managed. DISCUSSIONWe discuss how many aspects of the British Society of Audiology guidelines were not followed during this procedure and make recommendations as to how independent community practitioners need to be closely supervised with regular review to minimise the risks of such complications. CONCLUSIONOur report demonstrates how a serious otological complication from the {{creation of}} a hearing aid impression in a community based private hearing clinic was managed. The reporting of such complications is rare but the incidence is likely to be much higher than the literature would suggest. We recommend and advise how these adverse incidents may be minimised and managed through competency reviews and formal referral links from community centres to hospital otolaryngology/audiology departments...|$|E

40|$|Reading Virginia Woolf is {{the same}} as {{entering}} “a room of her own”, <b>moulding</b> <b>impressions,</b> listening to words spoken and unspoken, experiencing her well balanced, sensitive, and synaesthetic world. The way she spins out her stories creates a unique lacework where tout se tient since each single stitch contributes to the whole. Translating Virginia Woolf implies appropriating these impressions and techniques, as well as bridging the gap between the perception of feelings and the way they are worded. It also implies creating a palette to paint a comparable picture for the TL reader, who expects to enjoy rhythms, sounds, suggestions, and impressions which can somehow evoke the original. And yet, despite the effort to get this aim, the perfect finish of a translated text may be more aspiration than fact. Being aware of how difficult it can be to get this aim, I would like to discuss a couple of issues which are of some relevance in literary translation, namely 1) the role of textual components - first and foremost speech styles such as FIS – and 2) the crucial challenge of keeping the stylistic features of the original. Indeed, what happens when a highly peculiar text goes through translation? How much important is it to avoid forms of modulation which can thin down the semantic thickness of a text as well as blur its neat formal framework? Examples from published translations will help to answer these questions...|$|R

A famous portrait by Sandro Botticelli, who trained as a goldsmith, Portrait of a Man with a Medal of Cosimo the Elder (Uffizi, c. 1474), has the medal the subject is holding executed in gilded pastiglia, which apparently is an <b>impression</b> <b>moulded</b> from the original matrix for the metal medals, some of which survive.|$|R
40|$|Abstract- Complete {{dentures}} rest on basal {{seat area}} which is primarily oral mucosa and residual alveolar ridge. The oral mucosa on which complete dentures are fabricated is displacable and compressible. This factor {{was described by}} Hanau as ‘resiliency and like effect’, Realeff Effect. Realeff {{plays an important role}} In all the steps of compete denture fabrication as in primary <b>impression,</b> border <b>moulding,</b> final <b>impression,</b> jaw relation, try –in procedure and remount and follow up. Adequate measures taken during fabrication, can utilize this effect for construction of well fitted dentures. Hence this review study has been done in which the details of all the clinical procedures like use of adequate impression materials, techniques, jaw relation procedures, selective grinding, relining and rebasing which are important for utilization of realeff effect in dentures are mentioned in detail, thereby helping the operator to fabricate dentures with long term function and efficiency.

40|$|Post {{consumer}} plastics from household {{are highly}} mixed and contaminated {{and are thus}} particularly difficult to recycle. Although advances in sorting and cleaning technologies for waste plastics have enable the relatively pure and clean streams such as bottles to be recycled, there is a increasing need for processing technologies that can utilise the low grade and mixed plastic residues from the plastics recovery facilities (PRF). In this work, potentials of utilisation of such feedstock in Powder <b>Impression</b> <b>Moulding</b> (PIM), a process capable of fabricating lightweight sandwich structures, are investigated in terms effects of loading and size of flakes from PE-rich mixed plastics in the formulations of the core on flexural properties of the sandwich panels. It was demonstrated that sandwich panels {{can be made by}} incorporating about 75 wt % of coarse flakes of a low-grade mixed plastics material directly obtained from a PRF...|$|R
6000|$|He {{left two}} sons, Titus and Domitian. Titus {{was more of}} a scholar than his father, and was gentle and kindly in manner, so that he was much beloved. He used to say, [...] "I have lost a day," [...] when one went by without his finding some kind act to do. He was called the delight of mankind, and his reign would have been happy but for another great fire in Rome, which burnt what Nero's fire had left. In his time, too, Mount Vesuvius {{suddenly}} woke from its rest, and by a dreadful eruption destroyed the two cities at its foot, Herculaneum and Pompeii. The philosopher Plinius, who wrote on geography and natural history, was stifled by the sulphurous air while fleeing from the showers of stones and ashes cast up by the mountain. His nephew, called Pliny the younger, has left a full account of the disaster, and the cloud like a pine tree that hung over the mountain, the noises, the earthquake, and the fall at last of the ashes and lava. Drusilla, the wife of Felix, the governor before whom St. Paul pleaded, also perished. Herculaneum was covered with solid lava, so that very little could be recovered from it; but Pompeii, being overwhelmed with dust or ashes, was only choked, and in modern days has been discovered, showing perfectly what an old Roman town was like--amphitheatre, shops, bake-houses, and all. Some skeletons have been found: a man with his keys in a cellar full of treasure, a priest crushed by a statue of Isis, a family crowded into a vault, a sentry at his post; and in other cases the ashes perfectly <b>moulded</b> the <b>impression</b> of the figure they stifled, and on pouring plaster into them the forms of the victims have been recovered, especially two women, elder and younger, just as they fell at the gate, the girl with her head hidden in her mother's robe.|$|R
40|$|We {{identify}} the macroscopic impression fossils from the Xingmincun Formation of the Jinxian Group, Liaoning Province of northeastern China {{as members of}} the Aspidella plexus of the Ediacaran age. This is the first recognition of the taxon in the Liaoning Province, although such fossils have been previously recorded in the succession but were referred to as new species and relegated to an earlier Neoproterozoic age. A revision of the taxonomic interpretation and relative age estimation of the previous record is provided as well as an evaluation of abiotic vs biotic processes that could produce similar structures to studied impressions. We consider the mode of preservation of the fossils from a biochemical point of view and the properties of organic matter in the integument of soft-bodied metazoans. The selective preservation of the Ediacaran organisms, including metazoans, as <b>impressions</b> (<b>moulds</b> and casts) against the organically preserved contemporaneous cyanobacterial and algal microfossils and an exceptionally small number of terminal Ediacaran metazoan fossils (Sabellidites, Conotubus and Shaanxilites), demonstrates the non-resistant characteristics and the very different biochemical constitution of the Ediacaran metazoans compared with those that evolved in the Cambrian and after. The refractory biomacromolecules in cell walls of photosynthesizing microbiota (bacterans, cutans, algaenan and sporopollenin groups) and in the chitinous body walls of Sabellidites sharply contrast to the labile biopolymers in Ediacaran metazoans known only from impressions. The newly emerging biosynthesis of resistant biopolymers in metazoans (chitin and collagen groups) initiated by the annelids at the end of Ediacaran and fully evolved in Cambrian metazoans, considered with the ability to biomineralize, made their body preservation possible. The Chengjiang and Burgess Shale metazoans show evidence of this new biochemistry in body walls and cuticles, and {{not only because of the}} specific taphonomic window that enhanced their preservation.

40|$|Background and Aims: By {{using the}} {{technique}} of replicas of a developing apex {{it is possible to}} obtain a direct measure of phyllotactic parameters (plastochrone and platochronic ratio) involved in the initiation of two successive primordia {{at the level of the}} SAM. The goal of this study is to compare, in a real time setting, the value of phyllotactic parameters in distichous sytems using Begonia as a case study, with the value of the same parameters in spiral phyllotactic systems. Methods: To determine the real-time sequence of events at the level of the SAM, replicas were made of the developing apex at different intervals using previously described techniques. <b>Impression</b> <b>moulds</b> were made at 24 -h intervals. The following phyllotactic parameters were measured: plastochrone, angle of divergence, plastochrone ratio and ratio between the diameter of the leaf and the apex. Results: The time between the appearance of two successive leaves is 15 - 20 d. The average value of the plastochrone ratio (R) is 1. 3, and the ratio of the leaf to the diameter of the apex (Gamma) is 2. 5. The angle of divergence varies from 165 degrees to 180 degrees. The speed of advection of the primordium from the apex, varies from 0. 28 to 0. 37 micro m d- 1. Conclusions: The speed of advection of primordia in Begonia is lower than that of Anagalis. This is not in accordance with theoretical simulations that predict the opposite. In Begonia, the plastochrone ratio does not reflect the real time of appearance of two successive primordia. The time separating the appearance of two primordia is not directly related to the distance of these two primordia from the centre of the apex but is related instead to the enlargement of leaves. ...|$|R
40|$|As a {{consequence}} of rock engineering works, the rock mass will deform due to stress changes. Most deformation occurs in the rock joints, in form of normal and shear strains. These deformations will also change the void geometry and thereby the joint aperture and fluid flow. The {{purpose of the study}} was to increase the knowledge and understanding about mechanical and hydro-mechanical behaviour of rock joints and to provide essential parameter values. A comprehensive laboratory test programme was performed on both granite joints and replicas, followed by an analysis. The replicas consisted of high strength concrete with rock mechanical parameters close to those of the granite samples. 36 identical replicas were cast in a rubber <b>mould,</b> using an <b>impression</b> from one of the 19 granite samples. Roughness measurements were performed with, among other methods, a laser profilometer. Based on measured profile lines, an attempt was made to use fractal dimension (D) as a measure of joint roughness. Most of the mechanical and hydromechanical laboratory tests were performed in a direct shear box. Before shear testing, normal loading and unloading cycles were performed to consolidate the joints. The shear tests were performed with both constant normal load (CNL) and constant normal stiffness (CNS). To provide relevant rock mass stiffness for the (CNS) shear tests, a model was suggested. A clear difference between CNL and CNS tests occurred in the shear stress paths and in the peak shear stiffness, while the dilation angle and peak friction angle were unaffected. In the hydromechanical shear tests, the water flow through the joint was parallel; the joint opened much more than the hydraulic aperture which certainly depends on gouge production from the degradation of the joint surfaces. A minor modelling exercise was performed to verify some results obtained from the shear tests...|$|R
40|$|The current {{understanding}} of anterior eye shape in humans is limited due to available technology and its accessibility. Accurate curvature metrics of {{specific areas of}} the peripheral cornea, corneo-limbal junction and anterior sclera have remained obscured by {{the limits of the}} palpebral aperture, since the upper and lower eyelids cover most of the vertical aspect. This thesis starts by comparing the ‘gold standard’ keratometry measurements to commonly used topographic systems. Keratometric analogues were found to be significantly different and in addition provided spurious vertical anterior ocular surface (AOS) profiles. These findings revealed a need to establish an accurate model. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) potentially offers the best opportunity to image the entire AOS structure. However, preliminary studies in this thesis demonstrated that the use of a 3 -Tesla MRI scanner was unable to obtain sufficiently resolute data to meet requirements. As an alternative, ocular impression taking techniques were adopted during the remainder of this work to acquire the AOS data. Eye casts from <b>impression</b> <b>moulds</b> were scanned using active laser triangulation and virtual 3 -dimensional surfaces rendered. Further investigations defined the most suitable material for impression taking and the amount of deformation of the AOS caused by the procedure. The ocular impression casting and scanning process was examined for accuracy and reliability. This protocol was used to sample a population of normal white European eyes in order to establish a database and define wide-field AOS variability. Volumetric and 2 -dimensional topographic profiles were extracted from the digital 3 -dimensional representation obtained, allowing for the analysis of point-to-point curvature differences. For the first time, the entire AOS shape has been defined with known accuracy. In addition, effects of myopic refractive error and gender are presented. This data is of potential importance to ophthalmic surgeons, ocularists, contact lens practitioners, vision scientists and researchers, {{in the form of a}} digital archive of normal white European wide-field AOS topography as a reference source.

40|$|European Union’s 2020 target by 2020 {{is driving}} all {{the member states}} towards low carbon green economy and UK is in {{forefront}} of the change. UK government is using the transition to green economy to tackle economic instability and deficit. To ease the transition, various government departments are working with businesses and supporting them through many grants and funds. Anaerobic digestion (AD) is one such green business that generates energy from food waste {{that would have been}} otherwise sent to landfill. A unique challenge in AD is the sustainable way of disposing packaging plastic waste that is generated from the process. Around the world, recycling and reprocessing mixed plastic has been a challenge. Now there are multiple technologies available worldwide to handle this issue. We scanned for business opportunities and technologies worldwide to create a business using waste plastic. Few of the business opportunities we analysed are selling plastic to recyclers, plastic to fuel conversion, reprocessing plastic into useful products, using plastic in road construction and substitute for reducing agents in blast furnace. These options, except for selling to recyclers, are analysed in terms of technology feasibility, market attractiveness and sustainability aspect. As there is no technology or sustainability aspect involved in supplying plastic to recyclers, only the possibility of selling plastic is explored. There are companies that are ready to buy contaminated and clean mixed plastics. Based on the technology analysis, blast furnace and road construction are not feasible options for Local Generation as the investment is huge and technology providers or companies using this technology don’t exist in UK. Market analysis was carried out on the remaining two opportunities. Both markets – construction products using Powder <b>Impression</b> <b>Moulding</b> (PIM) and plastic to fuel are attractive and expected to grow soon. In terms, of sustainability, PIM stands tall as it uses closed loop recycling but plastic to fuel is also a sustainable solution. Scenario analysis is carried out to see how UK’s political and economical decisions impact the markets and businesses under consideration. Three scenarios used are – success of low carbon economy, failure of low carbon economy and a global economic downturn. Based on the analysis, market for both the products are attractive in all scenarios. So, our recommendations are  Short term - Supply plastic to recyclers  Midterm -Install cleaning and washing facility and sell clean plastic to recyclers  Long term - Build a PIM or plastic to fuel plant in long term...|$|R
