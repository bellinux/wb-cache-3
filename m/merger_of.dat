40|$|Merger {{activity}} had {{dramatically increased}} in the banking industry during the 1990 s. In the last few years, many <b>of</b> these <b>mergers</b> have been announced as a "merger of equals. " However, many {{studies have suggested that}} <b>mergers</b> <b>of</b> equals are different from acquisitions (Houston and Ryngaert 1994, 2000). This finding could suggest that there are fundamental differences between the returns for <b>mergers</b> <b>of</b> equals and acquisitions of banking firms. To test if <b>mergers</b> <b>of</b> equals in fact differ from acquisitions, I examine bidder and target returns, number of days to complete the transaction, and returns based on headquarter location. Overall, I find that there are statistically significant differences in the returns to bidders and targets in <b>mergers</b> <b>of</b> equals versus acquisitions. These results suggest that future studies that examine wealth effects from bank mergers need to control for <b>mergers</b> <b>of</b> equals. B. S. (Bachelor of Science...|$|R

40|$|<b>Mergers</b> <b>of</b> spiral galaxies as {{the only}} {{formation}} mechanism for elliptical galaxies can neither reproduce the kinematical and photometric properties of very massive elliptical galaxies nor the change from rotation supported disky to pressure supported boxy systems with increasing luminosity. Semi-analytical models indicate that the most massive galaxies assemble in major <b>mergers</b> <b>of</b> early-type progenitors even at low redshifts. We present numerical simulations showing that binary <b>mergers</b> <b>of</b> early-type galaxies open an additional channel {{for the formation of}} pressure supported, slowly rotating and boxy ellipticals. Including this channel in the semi-analytical models we can successfully reproduce the observed trend that more luminous giant ellipticals are more boxy and pressure supported. This trend can be strengthened by suppressing residual gas infall and star formation for galaxies with stellar bulge masses M_* ≥ 3 × 10 ^ 10 M_. Hence we propose that <b>mergers</b> <b>of</b> early-type galaxies play an important role for the assembly of massive elliptical galaxies...|$|R
