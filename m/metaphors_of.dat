In most variations, the only hint of three-dimensionality came from the shading on the tin lid. Otherwise the image was flat.

25|$|Faulkner's {{numerous}} {{contributions to}} the field of NLP began in 1984 with his modeling of Accelerated Learning, to pioneer more efficient and effective learning strategies. He taught this model together with NLP, to a group of teachers in Japan that same year. The result of this work was the founding of Learning How to Learn. Upon returning to the U.S. in 1985, he modeled the <b>Metaphors</b> <b>of</b> Identity. This model states that an individual's strategies and behavior patterns are informed by deeply structured metaphors for life, self, desired outcomes and challenges. By adopting new metaphors, an individual can create new pathways to transformation.|$|E
25|$|With La Création métaphorique, the {{researcher}} inventoried the representations {{of animals in}} the late medieval imaginary: lions and cocks as representations of courage, hunting dogs as icons of arrogance, pigs as symbols of gluttony etc. The books notably showed the traditional semantic parallelisms between cats, monkeys and apes, as codified in several Romance languages, and investigated the animals' respective roles within popular demonology and <b>metaphors</b> <b>of</b> drunkenness. With Les Sources indigènes de l'étymologie française, Șăineanu offered clues on the obscure origin of various French words. Șăineanu thus sourced the French and English harlequin beyond the Italian-language arlechino in Commedia dell'arte, and back to a medieval legend in Middle French.|$|E

25|$|Cleaning the Mirror {{consisted}} of five monitors playing footage in which Abramović scrubs a grimy human skeleton in her lap. She vigorously brushes the {{different parts of}} the skeleton with soapy water. Each monitor is dedicated to one part of the skeleton: the head, the pelvis, the ribs, the hands, and the feet. Each video is filmed with its own sound, creating an overlap. As the skeleton becomes cleaner, Abramović becomes covered in the grayish dirt that was once covering the skeleton. This three-hour performance is filled with <b>metaphors</b> <b>of</b> the Tibetan death rites that prepare disciples to become one with their own mortality. The piece consists of a three-piece series. Cleaning the Mirror #1 was performed at the Museum of Modern Art, consisting of three hours. Cleaning the Mirror #2 consists of 90 minutes performed at Oxford University. Cleaning the Mirror #3 was performed at Pitt Rivers Museum for five hours.|$|E
500|$|On {{their first}} meeting, Romeo and Juliet use {{a form of}} {{communication}} recommended by many etiquette authors in Shakespeare's day: metaphor. By using <b>metaphors</b> <b>of</b> saints and sins, Romeo was able to test Juliet's feelings for him in a non-threatening way. This method was recommended by Baldassare Castiglione (whose works had been translated into English by this time). He pointed out that if a man used a metaphor as an invitation, the woman could pretend she did not understand him, and he could retreat without losing honour. Juliet, however, participates in the metaphor and expands on it. The religious <b>metaphors</b> <b>of</b> [...] "shrine", [...] "pilgrim", and [...] "saint" [...] were fashionable in the poetry {{of the time and}} more likely to be understood as romantic rather than blasphemous, as the concept of sainthood was associated with the Catholicism of an earlier age. Later in the play, Shakespeare removes the more daring allusions to Christ's resurrection in the tomb he found in his source work: Brooke's Romeus and Juliet.|$|E
500|$|The second Experience album, , {{opens with}} the track [...] "EXP", which {{utilized}} microphonic and harmonic feedback in a new, creative fashion. It also showcased an experimental stereo panning effect in which sounds emanating from Hendrix's guitar {{move through the}} stereo image, revolving around the listener. The piece reflected his growing interest in science fiction and outer space. He composed the album's title track and finale around two verses and two choruses, during which he pairs emotions with personas, comparing them to colors. The song's coda features the first recording of stereo phasing. Shadwick described the composition as [...] "possibly the most ambitious piece on Axis, the extravagant <b>metaphors</b> <b>of</b> the lyrics suggesting a growing confidence" [...] in Hendrix's songwriting. His guitar playing throughout the song is marked by chordal arpeggios and contrapuntal motion, with tremolo-picked partial chords providing the musical foundation for the chorus, which culminates in what musicologist Andy Aledort described as [...] "simply {{one of the greatest}} electric guitar solos ever played". The track fades out on tremolo-picked thirty-second note double stops.|$|E

500|$|On 18 January 2007, French Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin {{presented}} Pinter with France's highest civil honour, the Légion d'honneur, at {{a ceremony}} at the French Embassy in London. [...] De Villepin praised Pinter's poem [...] "American Football" [...] (1991) stating: [...] "With its violence and its cruelty, {{it is for me}} one of the most accurate images of war, one of the most telling <b>metaphors</b> <b>of</b> the temptation of imperialism and violence." [...] In response, Pinter praised France's opposition to the war in Iraq. [...] M. de Villepin concluded: [...] "The poet stands still and observes what doesn't deserve other men's attention. Poetry teaches us how to live and you, Harold Pinter, teach us how to live." [...] He said that Pinter received the award particularly [...] "because in seeking to capture all the facets of the human spirit, [...] works respond to the aspirations of the French public, and its taste for an understanding of man and of what is truly universal". Lawrence Pollard observed that [...] "the award for the great playwright underlines how much Mr Pinter is admired in countries like France as a model of the uncompromising radical intellectual".|$|E
500|$|Considering it Donne's {{most famous}} valedictory poem, Theodore Redpath praises [...] "A Valediction" [...] for its [...] "lofty and {{compelling}} restraint, and the even tenor of its movement". Targoff maintains that what distinguishes [...] "A Valediction: Forbidding Mourning" [...] from Donne's other [...] "Valedictions" [...] is what Donne leaves for his lover: [...] "Donne does not leave his beloved either a physical or spiritual piece of himself. Instead, he leaves her {{the power of}} his poetic making. What is meant to prevent her [...] "mourning" [...] is not her possession of his name or book or heart or soul. It is the possession of his metaphors, <b>metaphors</b> <b>of</b> their union that seem invulnerable to division". Guibbory uses [...] "A Valediction" [...] to highlight Donne's status as [...] "master of the monosyllable, the small word that holds the line taut" [...] with his use of the word [...] "beat" [...] rather than [...] "spun" [...] in the analogy of beaten gold, while Ian Ousby uses the compass metaphor as an example of Donne's skill at weaving conceits [...] "sometimes extended throughout an entire poem in a virtuoso display of similitude". This view is seconded by Geoffrey Galt Harpham, who refers to it as [...] "the best known sustained conceit".|$|E
500|$|The xx's lyrics on Coexist feature broader diction {{than on the}} xx's {{first record}} and employ simple <b>metaphors</b> <b>of</b> light and darkness, and {{distance}} and time. They often express emotional stress, yearning, and passive-aggressive attitudes. Some songs feature a lyrical conceit of an emotionally elusive lover as an apparition or an illusion. Croft and Sim avoid traditional duet lyrics about declarations of love, instead employing inner monologues to depict the same situation from two different perspectives. Eric Sundermann asserts that, rather than [...] "simply" [...] being [...] "declarations", the songs serve as [...] "the thought process of {{how to deal with}} interpersonal struggles." [...] Neil McCormick of The Daily Telegraph perceives [...] "intimate conversations between forlorn lovers" [...] and an [...] "almost sacred eroticism in Croft and Sim's whispery vocals." [...] Drowned in Sound's Hayden Woolley views that the album shares its predecessor's [...] "fragility", [...] "quiet gravitas", and [...] "heavy words", but is [...] "an intensely wind-torn and wounded album that cuts even deeper than its predecessor." [...] Music journalist Luke Turner calls its subject matter more [...] "turbulent, sensual and fun" [...] than on the group's first album and states, [...] "of course not necessarily a sexual or romantic one, the feel of this second record is far more earthy, sticky, complicated, like the tension of the second or third encounters after a one night stand." ...|$|E

40|$|This paper aims {{to draw a}} {{knowledge}} map of the fragmented and multidisciplinary literature of sustainable development. Through the process <b>of</b> <b>metaphor</b> making, the study identifies seven metaphors that together construct this map. Each metaphor represents a specific domain in this map. The <b>metaphor</b> <b>of</b> ethical paradox signifies the ethical domain; the material domain is represented through the <b>metaphor</b> <b>of</b> natural capital, the social domain through the <b>metaphor</b> <b>of</b> fairness, the spatial domain through the eco-form metaphor, the political domain through the global discourse metaphor, the management domain through the integrative management metaphor, and the visionary domain through the utopian <b>metaphor.</b> The strength <b>of</b> this approach lies with its comprehensive representation of the complex sustainable development world. Its main weakness relies on the accurate representation of this map. ...|$|R

[...] was one that they wanted to answer in the fourth season. Tancharoen called the Inhumans [...] "a permanent part of our universe now", with Whedon adding, [...] "we have a quick-fire way of introducing people with powers. It gives us a lot of leeway in our world, and it lets us explore the <b>metaphors</b> <b>of</b> {{what it is like to}} be different. We will never close that chapter." [...] With the Inhumans film being removed from Marvel Studios' release schedule, the series had [...] "a little more freedom" [...] and were [...] "able to do a little bit more" [...] with the species, including the potential of introducing some of the [...] "classic" [...] Inhumans, though the series would focus less on Inhumans than the third season which saw [...] "a real significant Inhuman agenda story". It was not intended to be a spin-off of Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. On the evolution of S.H.I.E.L.D. to featuring so many powered characters, Whedon said [...] "the dynamic in the world has changed. There was one person with powers, and then by The Avengers there were maybe six total ... now they're much more prevalent, so there's reaction from the public based on that." ...|$|E
500|$|Although Darwin gives plant-women {{the central}} role in each {{vignette}} (a reversal of Linnaeus's classification scheme, which focuses on the male), few of the representations stray from stereotypical images of women. When the female and male reproductive organs are in a 1:1 ratio in a plant, Darwin represents traditional couplings. The women are “playful”, “chaste”, “gentle” and “blooming”. When the ratio is 1:2-4, the female becomes a “helpmate” or “associate” to the males, who have separate bonds to their “brothers”. Once he reaches 1:5-6, however, Darwin presents women as “seductive or wanton” or, at the other extreme, “needing protection”. By 1:8+, he presents “unambiguous <b>metaphors</b> <b>of</b> power and command, [...] being pictured as a saint, a reigning sovereign, a sorceress, a proto-industrialist [...] [...] [...] a priestess”. The images also present a largely positive view {{of the relationship between}} the sexes; there is no rape or sexual violence of any kind, elements central to much of Ovid and Linnaeus. There is also no representation of the marriage market, divorce or adultery (with one exception); the poem is largely pastoral. There are also no representations of intelligent women or women writers, although Darwin knew quite a few. The exception is the “Botanic Muse”, who has the botanical knowledge that the poem imparts; however, as Browne argues, few readers in the eighteenth century would have seen this as a liberating image for women since they would have been skeptical that a woman could have written the poem and inhabited the voice of the muse (they would have assumed that the anonymous writer was a man).|$|E
500|$|Discussing {{the season}} finale, Tancharoen stated, [...] "This season, we've {{explored}} {{a lot of}} different themes: There's the notion of purpose. We also introduced an Inhuman who has a strong sense of faith. We talk a lot about destiny and all these things intertwine." [...] Bennet likened {{the end of the season}} to [...] "the end of the first book of S.H.I.E.L.D. This finale feels like the end of something bigger and the beginning of a whole new tone for the show." [...] Whedon added, [...] "We wanted to put a close to [...] story. We knew going into this season what our plan was for both Ward and Hive. Our goal was to make it not just feel like victory—we like to get a victory and also a loss at the same time." [...] On whether the Inhumans storyline would also be ending with the season, Whedon said, [...] "We think of it as never closed. We like that we were able to open up that world and make Inhumans a permanent part of the universe. Now, we have a quick-fire way of introducing people with powers. It gives us a lot of leeway in our world, and it lets us explode the <b>metaphors</b> <b>of</b> what it is like to be different. We will never close that chapter." [...] On making a six-month time jump at the end of [...] "Ascension", Bell said that despite each character completing their arcs this season, [...] "we still have a lot of plot. Emotionally, their arcs are done. What the jump lets you do is to do a reset ... It allows us to put down a lot of old plot and pick up a lot of new." [...] Whedon added, [...] "We’ve done it each season, so we just wanted to do it a little early ... we would’ve done [...] in episode 1 next year but what we wanted to do was tease" [...] things to come at the end of this season.|$|E
