5|$|Glasses {{and certain}} types of {{plastics}} are commonly welded materials. Unlike metals, which have a specific melting point, glasses and plastics have a <b>melting</b> <b>range,</b> called the glass transition. When heating the solid material into this range, it will generally become softer and more pliable. When it crosses through the glass transition, {{it will become a}} very thick, sluggish, viscous liquid. Typically, this viscous liquid will have very little surface tension, becoming a sticky, honey-like consistency, so welding can usually take place by simply pressing two melted surfaces together. The two liquids will generally mix and join at first contact. Upon cooling through the glass transition, the welded piece will solidify as one solid piece of amorphous material.|$|E

Changing the degree of saturation of the fat changes some important physical properties, such as the <b>melting</b> <b>range,</b> which is why liquid oils become semi-solid. Solid or semi-solid fats are preferred for baking because the way the fat mixes with flour produces a more desirable texture in the baked product.

40|$|NOVELTY - To sinter {{polymers}} {{with narrow}} <b>melting</b> temperature <b>range</b> and high <b>melt</b> index, {{at least two}} different portions of similar polymer type with differing melting properties are employed. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - Different types of polymer may be used and mixed together. One type coats the other, the former having the lower <b>melting</b> temperature <b>range.</b> Portion(s) may be mixed with radiation-absorbent additive. A portion is co-extruded and/or granulated. The portion with the lower <b>melting</b> temperature <b>range</b> lies outside. USE - To sinter or meld plastics of the same type with a high melt index and narrow <b>melting</b> temperature <b>range,</b> forming a porus structure. A wide range of filter materials is cited. ADVANTAGE - If a plastic with narrow <b>melting</b> temperature <b>range</b> is heated, {{it is likely to}} collapse suddenly into a liquid, rendering sintering attempts futile. Using two types of the same plastic, which have different melting behavior, ensures one softens before the other; ideal for sintering. Given good mixing, a very uniform product results...|$|R

5000|$|Gold-Nickel. Continuous {{series of}} solid solutions. Wider <b>melting</b> <b>range</b> than Au-Cu alloys but better {{corrosion}} resistance and improved wetting. Frequently alloyed with other metals to reduce proportion of gold while maintaining properties. Copper may {{be added to}} lower gold proportion, chromium to compensate for loss of corrosion resistance, and boron for improving wetting impaired by the chromium. Generally no more than 35% Ni is used, as higher Ni/Au ratios have too wide <b>melting</b> <b>range.</b> Low vapor pressure.|$|E
5000|$|Gold-copper. Continuous {{series of}} solid solutions. Readily wet many metals, {{including}} refractory ones. Narrow <b>melting</b> <b>ranges,</b> good fluidity. Frequently used in jewellery. Alloys with 40-90% of gold harden on cooling but stay ductile. Nickel improves ductility. Silver lowers melting point but worsens corrosion resistance. To maintain corrosion resistance, gold {{must be kept}} above 60%. High-temperature strength and corrosion resistance can be improved by further alloying, e.g., with chromium, palladium, manganese, and molybdenum. Added vanadium allows wetting ceramics. Gold-copper has low vapor pressure.|$|R

Solubility is lower for more mafic magmas. As the temperature and pressure drop during emplacement and cooling of the magma a separate aqueous phase will exsolve. This aqueous phase will be enriched in other volatile and silicate incompatible species such as the metals: copper, lead, zinc, silver and gold; alkalis and alkaline earths and others, including: lithium, beryllium, boron, rubidium; and volatiles: fluorine, chlorine and carbon dioxide.|$|R
5000|$|Unlike {{electroplated}} nickel, {{electroless nickel}} deposits {{do not have}} a precise melting point but rather have a <b>melting</b> <b>range.</b> Pure nickel has a melting point of 1455 °C (2650 °F), however EN is an alloy and as the phosphorus content is increased within the film, the deposit begins to soften at lower temperatures and continues to soften until it eventually melts. The <b>melting</b> <b>range</b> decreases linearly as the phosphorus levels increase. The eutectic or lowest melting point for NiP alloys is 880 °C (1620 °F) and occurs at a deposit phosphorus content of 11% b.w. [...] The highest melting point is for low Phosphorus deposits (less than 3%) that claim to have melting points at 1,200 °C (2,200 °F). EN has failed in some high temperature applications since it was not fully recognized that even with a relatively high <b>melting</b> <b>range</b> the deposit may still have a liquid phase at lower temperatures. Figure 3 illustrates what happens when you subject EN to temperatures above its melting point.|$|E
5000|$|Alloys {{with larger}} span of solidus/liquidus {{temperatures}} tend to melt through a [...] "mushy" [...] state, {{during which the}} alloy {{is a mixture of}} solid and liquid material. Some alloys show tendency to liquation, separation of the liquid from the solid portion; for these the heating through the <b>melting</b> <b>range</b> must be sufficiently fast to avoid this effect. Some alloys show extended plastic range, when {{only a small portion of}} the alloy is liquid and most of the material melts at the upper temperature range; these are suitable for bridging large gaps and for forming fillets. Highly fluid alloys are suitable for penetrating deep into narrow gaps and for brazing tight joints with narrow tolerances but are not suitable for filling larger gaps.
