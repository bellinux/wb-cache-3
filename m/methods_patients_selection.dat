40|$|HLA-DR 4, {{like most}} other HLA-DR specificities, is a serologically defined public {{specificity}} present {{on a number of}} different haplotypes. Hapiotypes that share the DR 4 specificity may differ considerably; polypeptide products of HLA class II genes in the DR and DQ regions vary among different DR 4 + cells (1 - 4) and restriction endonuclease fragment length polymorphisms (RFLP) identify nucleotide variation among different DR 4 + haplotypes (5). Polymorphic variations within HLA class II molecules are implicated in the regulation of immune response, and are associated with susceptibility to a number of different diseases, including insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) and seropositive juvenile rheumatoid arthritis (IRA), which are both associated with HLA-DR 4 (6 - 9).

30|$|In summary, studies {{looking at}} the rates of {{progression}} of isolated MVT have shown conflicting results.

40|$|The {{value of}} pulsed-wave transmitral Doppler for the {{diagnosis}} of moderate acute rejection was examined {{in a total of}} 347 Doppler recordings obtained in 32 consecutive cardiac allograft recipients. Serial Doppler examinations (median, 11 per patient; range, 1 to 23) were performed simultaneously with endomyocardial biopsies from the first week after heart transplantation to a follow-up of 186 days (median; range, 10 to 395 days after transplantation). Pulsed-wave transmitral Doppler did not allow noninvasive diagnosis of moderate acute rejection in individual patients. Peak filling rate normalized for mitral stroke volume, early diastolic velocity, and mean diastolic velocity were significantly increased, whereas diastolic filling period was decreased during moderate acute rejection compared to other biopsy classes. The wide overlap of measurements in individual recipients with or without rejection may be due, however, to a variety of hemodynamic factors after transplantation affecting diastolic function, which are superimposed on the restrictive left ventricular filling pattern caused by persistent mild acute rejection and left ventricular hypertrophy. These hemodynamic factors include pulmonary hypertension, perioperative ischemia, reperfusion injury, and changes in both blood pressure and loading conditions caused by hypertension and its treatment. Differences between studies with regard to the detection of moderate acute rejection by transmitral Doppler may be caused by chance, because most studies were relatively small. Differences in <b>methods,</b> <b>patient</b> <b>selection,</b> duration of follow-up, prevalence of hypertension and left ventricular hypertrophy, and differences in antihypertensive drug regimens may also play a role.

40|$|Due {{to recent}} results from {{clinical}} intra-arterial treatment for acute ischemic stroke (IAT-AIS) trials {{such as the}} Interventional Management of Stroke (IMS III), IAT-AIS and the merit of revascularization have been contested. Even though intra-arterial treatment (IAT) {{has been shown to}} improve revascularization rates, a corresponding increase in good outcomes has only recently been noted. Even though a significant percentage of patients achieve good revascularization in a timely manner, results do not translate into good clinical outcomes (GCOs). Based on a review of the literature, the authors suspect limited good clinical outcomes following timely and successful revascularization are due to poor <b>patient</b> <b>selection</b> that led to futile and possibly even harmful revascularization. The Capillary Index Score (CIS) is a simple angiography-based scale that can potentially be used to improve <b>patient</b> <b>selection</b> to prevent revascularization being performed on patients who are unlikely to benefit from treatment. The CIS characterizes presence of capillary blush related to collateral flow as a marker of residual viable tissue, with absence of blush indicating the tissue is no longer viable due to ischemia. By only selecting patients with a favorable CIS for IAT, the rate of GCOs should consistently approach 80 - 90 %. Current <b>methods</b> of <b>patient</b> <b>selection</b> are primarily dependent on time from ischemia.

Demographic data, cardiovascular risk factors, preoperative radiologic aneurysm characteristics, as well as timing of surgery and preoperative severity grades (Hunt and Hess [HH], Fisher, World Federation of Neurological Societies [WFNS]), were collected from hospital charts and surgery videos and compared between patients with and without ioAR. Results Of 100 patients (38 men, 62 women) with a median age of 57. 4 years (range: 23 - 85 years), ioAR occurred in 34 cases (34 %). Univariate analyses showed that severity grades were significantly higher in the ioAR group (Fisher p[*]=[*] 0. 012; HH p[*]=[*] 0. 002; WFNS p[*]=[*] 0. 023). IoAR was significantly associated with intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) (23 % versus 47 %; p[*]=[*] 0. 013) and the spot sign as an indicator of active bleeding within the ICH (0 % vs 44 %; p[*]=[*] 0. 007). Multivariate analysis showed that HH was the only significant predictor of ioAR (p[*]=[*] 0. 03; odds ratio: 2. 3; 95 % confidence interval, 1. 1 - 5. 0).

40|$|Arterial {{waves are}} seen as {{possible}} independent mediators of cardiovascular risks, and the wave intensity analysis (WIA) has therefore been proposed as a <b>method</b> for <b>patient</b> <b>selection</b> for ventricular assist device (VAD) implantation. Interpreting measured wave intensity (WI) is challenging and complexity is increased by the implantation of a VAD. The waves generated by the VAD interact with the waves generated by the native heart, and this interaction varies with changing VAD settings. Eight sheep were implanted with a pulsatile VAD (PVAD) through ventriculo-aortic cannulation. The start of PVAD ejection was synchronized to the native R-wave and delayed between 0 % - 90 % of the cardiac cycle in 10 % steps or phase shifts (PS).

Depending on the PS, different wave interference phenomena occurred. Maximum unloading of the left ventricle (LV) coincided with constructive interference and maximum blood flow pulsatility, and maximum loading of the LV coincided with destructive interference and minimum blood flow pulsatility.

We investigated the suitability of two novel sputum-based nucleic acid amplification <b>methods</b> for <b>patient</b> <b>selection</b> in a recent early bactericidal activity study. Spontaneously expectorated sputum samples of 140 consecutive pulmonary tuberculosis patients were examined with direct fluorescence microscopy, Genotype MTBDRplus assay (MTBDR), Xpert MTB/RIF assay (Xpert), and liquid mycobacterial culture. The methods detected mycobacteria or mycobacterial DNA in 96. 8 %, 90. 5 %, 92. 9 %, and 92. 1 % of samples, respectively. MTBDR, Xpert, and liquid culture were 100 % concordant for detection of resistance to rifampin. Sensitivity and specificity of MTBDR for detection of isoniazid resistance were 83. 3 % and 100 %, respectively. For quantification of mycobacterial sputum load, we found a correlation between Xpert DNA amplification cycle thresholds, time to positivity, and microscopy smear grade. The best correlation was found between Xpert and time to positivity (r = 0. 54), which were both correlated with smear microscopy with r values equal to - 0. 40 and - 0. 48, respectively. We conclude that MTBDR and Xpert are suitable screening tools for determining rifampin resistance in sputum microscopy smear-positive patients before participation in tuberculosis trials. Xpert should be further explored as a surrogate measurement for sputum mycobacterial load. Copyright © 2011, American Society for Microbiology. All Rights Reserved. Articl...|$|R
40|$|Rheumatoid {{arthritis}} (RA) is {{a systemic}} autoimmune rheumatic disease of unknown etiology, characterized by chronic erosive arthritis and extraarticular manifestations. Pulmonary involvement {{is one of}} the common extraarticular manifestations of RA and may show itself as bronchial tree lesions, rheumatoid nodules, Caplan's syndrome, and lesions in the pleura or pulmonary interstitium (interstitial lung involvement (ILI)). High-resolution computed tomography allows the diagnosis of ILI in RA in nearly 70 % of cases although the incidence of ILI may be lower (4 to 30 %) depending on diagnostic <b>methods</b> and <b>patient</b> <b>selection</b> criteria. There are several histopathological types of ILI, the differential diagnosis of which can be troublesome. Usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP) and nonspecific interstitial pneumonia are major types of RA-associated ILI. UIP-pattern ILI has a more severe course than ILI with other histological patterns. The clinical presentation of ILI may be complicated by the likely toxic effect of a number of disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) used to treat RA, such as methotrexate and leflunomide, and biological agents (BAs), tumor necrosis factor- α (TNF- α) inhibitors. The pathogenesis of pulmonary involvement in RA and the role of synthetic DMARDs and BAs in the development of ILI call for further investigations. An extraarticular manifestation, such as ILI, affects the choice of treatment policy in patients with RA. The relevance of a study of ILI is beyond question.

Large, prospective clinical trials evaluating the potency of MSCs have however not been published. To evaluate the therapeutic potential of MSCs in the treatment of steroid-refractory acute GvHD, we conducted a systematic literature search. We included all studies that focused on MSC treatment of adult allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation recipients with grades III to IV steroid-refractory acute GvHD and were transparent about their <b>methods</b> and <b>patient</b> <b>selection</b> criteria.

The GvHD grade at the time of treatment was identified as a predictor of clinical response. Interestingly, complete response but not partial response to MSCs was associated with overall survival. No serious side effects of MSC therapy were reported.

Clinical and laboratory data of 120 out of 334 SLE patients, fulfilling inclusion criteria for enrolment and followed up between 1997 and 2012, were retrospectively collected. For the purposes of the study, a flare was defined as any new SLE manifestation or worsening of a pre-existing manifestation resulting in change of therapy. A review of the literature was performed searching for articles published between 1980 and 2015. Over a median (IQR) follow-up of 5. 9 (3. 0 - 8. 9) years, 87 flares were recorded in 59 (49 %) patients. The estimated incidence rate was 0. 11 flare per patient-year, at the low-end of values reported in literature (0. 19 - 1. 76 patient-year).

40|$|Introduction: DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) are toxic DNA lesions {{that can}} be {{repaired}} by non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) or homologous recombination (HR). Mutations in HR genes elicit a predisposition to cancer; yet, they also result in increased sensitivity to certain DNA damaging agents and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors. To optimally implement PARP inhibitor treatment, {{it is important that}} patients with HR-deficient tumors are adequately selected. Areas covered: Herein, the authors describe the HR pathway mechanistically and review the treatment of HR-deficient cancers, with a specific focus on PARP inhibition for BRCA 1 / 2 -mutated breast and ovarian cancer. In addition, mechanisms of acquired PARP inhibitor resistance are discussed. Furthermore, combination therapies with PARP inhibitors are reviewed, in the context of both HR-deficient and HR-proficient tumors and <b>methods</b> for proper <b>patient</b> <b>selection</b> are also discussed. Expert opinion: Currently, only patients with germline or somatic BRCA 1 / 2 mutations are eligible for PARP inhibitor treatment and only a proportion of patients respond. Patients with HR-deficient tumors caused by other (epi) genetic events may also benefit from PARP inhibitor treatment. Ideally, <b>selection</b> of eligible <b>patients</b> for PARP inhibitor treatment include a functional HR read-out, in which cancer cells are interrogated for their ability to perform HR repair and maintain replication fork stability...|$|R

40|$|Background and purpose: Obesity now forms one of {{the leading}} public health {{concerns}} globally. Several surgical options including sleeve gastrectomy exist for its treatment. Recently, laparoscopic gastric banding has been developed with the aim of providing a laparoscopically placed device that is safe and effective in generating substantial weight loss. The goal of this review is to compare the effectiveness and safety of laparoscopic adjustable silicon gastric banding (LASGB) and laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) in the treatment of morbid obesity by reviewing the <b>methods</b> of <b>patient</b> <b>selection,</b> operative time, conversion rate, complications, blood loss, postoperative morbidity and mortality, hospital stay, and quality of life. Material and methods: A systematic literature search was performed using Highwire press, Springer link, Medline, Medscape and Google, and article bibliographies to identify relevant evidence. Included studies must have reported outcome data for more than 40 patients aged 20 years and above with a minimum of one 1 -year follow-up. The operating time, complications, blood loss, hospital stay, morbidity and mortality, and quality of life were reviewed. Results: The total number of patients enrolled was 4, 519; the specific procedure totals were 3, 714 for LAGB and 805 for LSG. The age range of the population studied was 13 - 79 years for LSG and 18 - 65 years for LAGB. The sex distribution had a male:female ratio of 1 : 4 for LAGB and 1 : 3 for LSG. The overall complication rate in this review varied from 1. 7 - 11. 80 % for LSG and 0. 2 - 24 % for LAGB. Conclusion: Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy though, forms a safe surgical option for weight loss treatment particularly in the very-very-obese patients (BMI> 60 kg/m 2). LASGB gives satisfactory results and coupled with reversibility and low cost, it is an important tool in the long-term management of patients with morbid obesity...|$|R
30|$|This paper {{reviews the}} <b>patient</b> <b>selection,</b> {{clinical}} management and expected results of prostate artery embolization. <b>Patient</b> <b>selection</b> is paramount in delivering the desired results for any procedure. Likewise, {{the ability to}} clinically manage patients in the pre-operative and post-operative setting is an important skill to acquire when implementing new techniques. This paper introduces important urologic measurements/tests, <b>patient</b> <b>selection</b> paradigms, and clinical management concepts for interventional radiologists. It also reviews the outcomes patients can expect following prostate artery embolization {{as well as the}} complication profile.|$|R
40|$|Competition in {{hospital}} care is often implemented through mixed markets where {{public and private}} hospitals compete for patients. The optimality of this market form has long been debated in the literature. In this paper we investigate the role of soft budget constraint in affecting <b>patient</b> <b>selection</b> within a mixed market. <b>Patient</b> <b>selection</b> is the undesired effect of hospital competition when three conditions are met: asymmetry {{in hospital}}s' objectives, presence of hospital’s private information and inability to enforce hard budget constraint. The paper shows that soft budget is a pre-condition {{for the existence of}} <b>patient</b> <b>selection.</b> Our paper adds an important dimension to the existing literature which considers asymmetry of information as the only cause for this market failure. The understanding of the mechanisms leading to <b>patient</b> <b>selection</b> makes it possible for the regulator to design measures to reduce such undesirable effect...|$|R
40|$|We thank Mydin et al {{for their}} {{interest}} in our article. 1 They contend that the main findings are explained by <b>patient</b> <b>selection</b> and that {{for many of these}} patients management with non-invasive ventilation (NIV) is inappropriate and end-of-life care pathways should be introduced instead. We agree that <b>patient</b> <b>selection</b> is one of the important explanations for the difference in outcomes of observed clinical practice when compared with the randomised controlled trial (RCT) results and repeatedly emphasise this within the discussion. <b>Patient</b> <b>selection</b> alone however is unlikely to explain the poor survival observed as we als...|$|R
