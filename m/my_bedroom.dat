500|$|... 50 Cent told NME {{that the}} song is the one he wished he'd written: [...] "I had his poster on my wall. He had me moonwalkin' around <b>my</b> <b>bedroom.</b> I'd love to have written any Michael Jackson song, so maybe start {{with one of the}} greatest." ...|$|E
500|$|I pop {{the video}} in, and wow... Tears welling, silence, goose-bumps... Wow. [...] I just lost my girlfriend, because that song isn't mine anymore... It really {{made me think}} about how {{powerful}} music is as a medium and art form. I wrote some words and music in <b>my</b> <b>bedroom</b> {{as a way of}} staying sane, about a bleak and desperate place I was in, totally isolated and alone. [...] that winds up reinterpreted by a music legend from a radically different era/genre and still retains sincerity and meaning— different, but every bit as pure.|$|E
500|$|Chesnutt shopped {{the album}} around to record companies, but they mistook {{it for a}} demo and {{rejected}} it. They encouraged him to reproduce it smoothly, rearrange the drums, and rerecord his vocals. He {{said in an interview}} for Vibe at the time, [...] "I refuse to re-record it-that defeats the purpose. What about the experience I had in <b>my</b> <b>bedroom?</b> To go back to the studio, I'd be chasing something. If you're listening to it and you love it, then it's already done what it's supposed to do." [...] In September 2002, Chesnutt made the album available through his website, and released it on September 24 on his own label Ready, Set, Go! ...|$|E

500|$|Jolie had {{a serious}} boyfriend for two years {{from the age of}} 14. Her mother allowed them to live {{together}} in her home, of which Jolie later said, [...] "I was either going to be reckless on the streets with my boyfriend or {{he was going to be}} with me in <b>my</b> <b>bedroom</b> with my mom in the next room. She made the choice, and because of it, I continued to go to school every morning and explored my first relationship in a safe way." [...] She has compared the relationship to a marriage in its emotional intensity, and said that the breakup compelled her to dedicate herself to her acting career at the age of 16.|$|E
500|$|Having posted similar {{offensive}} {{statistics in}} the regular season, the Eagles and Cardinals were expected to play a tight game. Played in a blizzard at Philadelphia's Shibe Park, the game's only score was a fourth quarter rushing touchdown by Van Buren from five yards out. The 7–0 win gave the Eagles their first league title. Van Buren finished with 98 yards on 26 carries, though he nearly missed the game entirely. Thinking the game would not be played in the blizzard, he remained home until coach Greasy Neale called {{him and told him}} the game was still on. He had to catch three trolleys and walk six blocks {{in order to make the}} game on time. [...] "I looked out <b>my</b> <b>bedroom</b> window that morning, saw the snow and went back to bed," [...] he later explained. [...] "I was sure the game would be postponed." ...|$|E
500|$|For {{the next}} two years, the band played {{throughout}} the Boston area. Eventually Godsmack's CD landed {{in the hands of}} Rocko, the night-time DJ for Boston radio station WAAF (FM). The radio station put [...] "Keep Away" [...] into heavy rotation and the song rose to the number one spot at the station very quickly. Newbury Comics, a New England record store chain, agreed to sell the CD on consignment. Shortly after the success of [...] "Keep Away", Godsmack went back into the studio and recorded a single titled [...] "Whatever", which became the new local favorite on WAAF (FM). In an interview Sully Erna stated, [...] "We had been selling maybe 50 copies a month at the time WAAF picked up the album. All of a sudden we started moving over a thousand records a week. (...) I was doing all this from <b>my</b> <b>bedroom.</b> After years of grinding away, things finally started taking off".|$|E
60|$|Then I rose of a sudden, and {{ran down}} the hill with all my might, lest I should break my resolve, never {{stopping}} once till I reached <b>my</b> own <b>bedroom.</b>|$|R

6000|$|That night Charles {{came to me}} with a very grave face in <b>my</b> own <b>bedroom.</b> [...] "Sey," [...] he said, {{under his}} breath, [...] "have you observed? Have you watched? Have you any suspicions?" ...|$|R
500|$|The group's primary musical {{influences}} {{came from}} bands such as Buzzcocks, The Jam, Madness and The Kinks. Supergrass took this contemporary music and mixed it with pop punk's characteristic fast, three-chord, guitar-based, catchy tunes {{to produce a}} sound uniquely their own; [...] "we were just {{the three of us}} in <b>my</b> <b>bedroom</b> or someone's house, just making... we played really hard and just made loads of noise. Most of our early songs were just three chord grooves and stuff that was fun to play. So that's why the first album sounded so 'punky', I think... it's just 'cause we were all used to playing in this small room and it being really loud, so we just made the album sound like that." [...] Songs for Beginners by Graham Nash was another possible influence on I Should Coco. Gaz Coombes told The Guardian in 2003, [...] "We used to listen to it a lot when we lived in Cowley Road in Oxford in 1994, just when the band were getting big." ...|$|E
500|$|But this contradicted O'Neal's {{own account}} of the {{relationship}} in 1995 in Vibe, where she remembered Jackson as [...] "being so shy" [...] and [...] "one of the nicest, most innocent people I've ever met", and, [...] "Once he came into <b>my</b> <b>bedroom,</b> and he wouldn't even sit on my bed." [...] She described the relationship as [...] "a really wonderful friendship" [...] where they would dance and [...] "talk on the phone all the time." [...] She recalled that he found it funny that she could drive at 12 and he couldn't. And that one time they had a [...] "jam session" [...] at her house where he played the drums and her brother played guitar. She said the relationship ended when she was 12, after {{he asked her to}} go to the premiere of The Wiz with him, but her agent disapproved, [...] "maybe because they thought he wasn't a big enough star yet", and she did what she was told because she was a child. [...] While she claimed they never spoke after that, they were actually shown to be together a number of times after this would have happened.|$|E
500|$|In his memoir, Eminent Hipsters, Fagen {{notes that}} the cover figure [...] "wasn't {{supposed}} to be a stand-in for any particular jazz DJ," [...] but noted a few personalities from the period that factored into the creation: Ed Beach, Dan Morgenstern, Martin Williams, R.D. Harlan, [...] "Symphony Sid" [...] Torin, and what Fagen regarded as his [...] "main man", WEVD's Mort Fega. [...] "He was laid-back, knowledgeable, and forthright, the cool uncle you wished you'd had." [...] At the time of the album's release, he remembered that jazz music offered him an escape from the adults in his life: [...] "When I saw E.T.,' I realized that the E.T. in <b>my</b> <b>bedroom</b> was my Thelonious Monk records. Everything that he represented was totally unworldly in a way, although at the same time jazz to me seemed more real than the environment in which I was living." [...] The Wall Street Journal Robert J. Toth writes, [...] "The cover adds another layer of autobiography. On the front, we see Mr. Fagen as a crew-cut deejay on the graveyard shift. On the back is his audience, a single lighted window in a row of tract homes — or maybe the artist as a young man, drinking in inspiration." [...] Robert Palmer, of The New York Times, continued in this line of thinking: [...] "Inside, there's a teenager with his ear next to a portable radio. He's playing it softly, so his parents won't wake up, and he can barely make out the sounds through the static. [...] The teenager was Donald Fagen." ...|$|E
60|$|Finally, I {{remember}} that when I got into <b>my</b> little <b>bedroom,</b> I was truly wretched, and had a strong conviction on me that I should never like Joe's trade. I had liked it once, but once was not now.|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{will talk}} all that over to-morrow, Mammy Green, and I {{will tell you}} some of my history, and what I intend doing. I am tired now, I suppose <b>my</b> little <b>bedroom</b> is nearly {{as it used to}} be?" ...|$|R
60|$|I {{went into}} <b>my</b> wife's <b>bedroom.</b> Césarine lay moaning piteously on the bed, in her wet clothes still; {{her cheeks were}} hot, and her pulse was high and thin and feverish. I knew without asking {{what was the matter}} with her. It was yellow fever.|$|R
2500|$|Bergman cited {{his desire}} to one day perform in Graceland as another {{influence}} on the project, musing that if the band became popular enough he {{would one day be}} able to perform there. Bergman commented [...] "I used to sit in <b>my</b> <b>bedroom</b> and think, 'Damn, if we could just play Graceland, I would die a happy guy'". Before the album was released, it was promoted by the release of a music video for the single [...] "They Live".|$|E
2500|$|... "I had {{went through}} {{a lot of things in}} my life that had driven me to a darker path than most choose to take. I split the flesh on my wrist with a box opener, {{painting}} the floor of <b>my</b> <b>bedroom</b> with blood I shouldn't have spilt. After sitting there for what seemed like hours (which apparently was only minutes), I had the revelation that this was not the path. It was my dicision (sic) to seek medical treatment, as on the other hand I could have chose to sit there until enough blood drained from my downward lascerations on my wrists to die." ...|$|E
2500|$|English {{versions}} of Jacques Brel songs {{have been recorded}} by {{a wide variety of}} artists. Rod McKuen {{was one of the first}} American artists to discover and translate Brel's songs. Canadian Terry Jacks' version of [...] "Seasons in the Sun" [...] (based on Brel's [...] "Le Moribond") became a global pop hit in 1974, topping the charts internationally. [...] "Seasons in the Sun" [...] has seen its own renditions recorded by artists ranging from the Beach Boys to Nirvana. McKuen and Brel formed a close friendship. McKuen later wrote, [...] "When news of Jacques' death came, I stayed locked in <b>my</b> <b>bedroom</b> and drank for a week." ...|$|E

25|$|During the tour, the {{increasingly}} difficult relationship between Chadwick and Bickers worsened and Bickers was abruptly sacked mid-tour. At one day's notice, Simon Walker was recruited directly from <b>My</b> White <b>Bedroom</b> and The Dave Howard Singers as replacement lead guitarist. He made his debut at the band's concert at Portsmouth Polytechnic on 4 December 1989.|$|R
2500|$|Following {{the mixed}} {{response}} to Pinkerton, Weezer {{went on a}} five-year hiatus. Cuomo enrolled at Harvard twice more and completed semesters in 1997 and 2004. During the 1997 semester, he played with a new band, Homie, in Boston. In February 1998, Cuomo disbanded Homie and moved to Los Angeles to work on new Weezer demos with Bell and Wilson, but the sessions were unproductive. In 1998 and 1999, he lived in an apartment under a freeway in Culver City, California. In an essay for Harvard, he wrote: [...] "I {{became more and more}} isolated. I unplugged my phone. I painted the walls and ceiling of <b>my</b> <b>bedroom</b> black and covered the windows with fiberglass insulation." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2005, on 60 Minutes, he told Mike Wallace {{that his}} life could have turned out differently. [...] "I'd got {{accepted}} to a seminary in Wisconsin, and I was gonna become a priest, {{but at the last}} second I thought, 'I'll just go to public school.' I had just gotten a new amplifier in <b>my</b> <b>bedroom,</b> and I didn't think I was allowed to take it with me." [...] Instead, he got accepted into the famed Cass Technical High School as a business major, and played the drums and trombone in the band. At 15, he began a three-year upholstery apprenticeship with a family friend, Brian Muldoon. He credits Muldoon with exposing him to punk music as they worked together in the shop. Muldoon goaded his young apprentice into forming a band: [...] "He played drums", Gillis thought. [...] "Well I guess I'll play guitar then." [...] The two recorded an album, Makers of High Grade Suites, as the Upholsterers.|$|E
2500|$|The {{dynamics}} {{of their relationship}} were clear from the start, with Bianca portrayed as the dominant, bossy and authoritative partner, while Ricky was shown as the hen-pecked, dim-witted [...] "loser" [...] or [...] "soft touch", comically under the thumb of his female counterpart. James Rampton from The Independent has commented, [...] "to her eternally put-upon husband, Ricky, Bianca was a ferocious reincarnation of H Rider Haggard's 'She Who Must Be Obeyed'." [...] Bianca was notorious for shouting the catchphrase [...] "Rickaaaaaaay!" [...] (a cockney pronunciation of Ricky) at her lover, and Palmer admitted in 2008 that [...] "not a day has gone by in nine years when someone hasn't shouted that from cars and even up at <b>my</b> <b>bedroom</b> window at night." [...] Rampton has suggested that Bianca's catchphrase – [...] "Rickaaaaaaay!" [...] – transitioned, becoming [...] "shorthand for any sort of heinous henpecking." [...] On Friday Night with Jonathan Ross on 18 April 2008, Palmer explained that it was actually Ross, as a DJ, who had originally inspired the catchphrase.|$|E
60|$|I trembled for Clara; {{and just}} then her dear voice was heard calling {{us to come}} upstairs.

60|$|I {{went into}} <b>my</b> own <b>bedroom</b> and {{wrote to the}} lawyer, merely telling him that Mr. James Smith had {{appeared}} unexpectedly at the Hall, and that events had occurred in consequence which required his immediate presence.

2500|$|In October 1868, {{with the}} {{rebuilding}} of the lodge largely complete: [...] "Reached the Glassalt Sheil at half past 6. It looked so cheerful & comfortable, all lit up & the little rooms are so cosy & nice. The Dining room is {{on the one side}} of the little entrance hall, my sitting room, on the other & <b>my</b> <b>bedroom</b> [...] – beyond. In it stands the old bed & wardrobe in our former little bedroom at Alt na Guithasach. Upstairs the rooms are equally comfortable. Felt sad & lonely, thinking of the blessed happy past with dearest Albert, who always had wished to build here, in this favourite spot. I could not have lived again at Alt na Guithasach now, alone, & it is far better to have built a totally new house, but the sad thought struck me, that it was the first widow's house, – not blessed by him." [...] With five of her children and her Lady of the Bedchamber Jane Spencer, Baroness Churchill, Victoria held a house warming party and then they stayed for the night.|$|E
2500|$|Ballinger {{was briefly}} {{unsure of what}} to do with her newfound {{internet}} success, but in April 2009, Jim Caruso invited her to perform as the character at Cast Party, a weekly show at his Birdland jazz club in New York City. She recalls, [...] "I went from making a minute-and-a-half video in <b>my</b> <b>bedroom</b> to doing an hour-and-a-half live show". Members of the Broadway theatre community quickly embraced the Miranda videos and were eager to be a part of Miranda's live comedy acts. Frankie Grande, who was then in the cast of Mamma Mia!, invited Ballinger to join the cast as Miranda at the Minskoff Theatre in the 2009 Broadway Cares Easter Bonnet competition charity benefit. Later, Broadway celebrities like Lin-Manuel Miranda performed in videos with Miranda. Ballinger was also invited to perform in London. At the Leicester Square Theatre in 2010, Miranda taught [...] "voice lessons" [...] to, and performed with, such West End theatre stars as Leanne Jones, Scarlett Strallen, Daniel Boys, Julie Atherton, Ian ‘H’ Watkins, Anna-Jane Casey, Jon Lee and Noel Sullivan, and the London casts of Naked Boys Singing, Wicked and Les Misérables. Since the summer of 2009, Miranda Sings has also been featured in radio, television and internet interviews where the interviewers explore the personality traits of, and play along with, the character.|$|E

60|$|I withdrew {{early to}} <b>my</b> little <b>bedroom</b> {{overlooking}} the gardens, {{a room that}} had more {{the air of a}} monastic cell than a bedchamber fitting the estate of the Lord of Mondolfo.
