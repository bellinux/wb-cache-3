5|$|Borislow {{died from}} an {{apparent}} {{heart attack or}} <b>myocardial</b> infarction on July 21, 2014.|$|E
5|$|C-terminal truncation: The C-terminal end {{segment is}} the most conserved region of TnI. As an {{allosteric}} structure regulated by Ca2+ in the troponin complex, it binds and stabilizes the position of tropomyosin in low Ca2+ state implicating {{a role in the}} inhibition of actomyosin ATPase. A deletion of the C-terminal 19 amino acids was found during <b>myocardial</b> ischemia-reperfusion injury in Langendorff perfused rat hearts. It was also seen in <b>myocardial</b> stunning in coronary bypass patients. Over-expression of the C-terminal truncated cardiac TnI (cTnI1-192) in transgenic mouse heart resulted in a phenotype of <b>myocardial</b> stunning with systolic and diastolic dysfunctions. Replacement of intact cTnI with cTnT1-192 in myofibrils and cardiomyocytes did not affect maximal tension development but decreased the rates of force redevelopment and relaxation.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to its effects on thrombosis, hypercoagulable states may accelerate the development of atherosclerosis, the arterial disease that underlies <b>myocardial</b> infarction {{and other forms of}} cardiovascular disease.|$|E
25|$|<b>Myocardial</b> {{cells are}} exposed to {{different}} environments. Normal cells may be exposed to hyperkalaemia; abnormal cells may be perfused by normal environment. For example, with a healed <b>myocardial</b> infarction, abnormal cells can be exposed to an abnormal environment such as with a <b>myocardial</b> infarction with <b>myocardial</b> ischaemia. In conditions such as <b>myocardial</b> ischaemia, possible mechanism of arrhythmia generation include the resulting decreased internal K+ concentration, the increased external K+ concentration, norepinephrine release and acidosis. When <b>myocardial</b> cell {{are exposed to}} hyperkaliemia, the maximum diastolic potential is depolarized {{as a result of}} the alteration of Ik1 potassium current, whose intensity and direction is strictly dependent on intracellular and extracellular potassium concentrations. With Ik1 suppressed, an hyperpolarizing effect is lost and therefore there can be activation of funny current even in <b>myocardial</b> cells (which is normally suppressed by the hyperpolarizing effect of coexisting potassium currents). This can lead to the instauration of automaticity in ischemic tissue.|$|E
25|$|Endogenous {{sulfur dioxide}} also diminishes <b>myocardial</b> damage, caused by isoproterenol {{adrenergic}} hyperstimulation, and strengthens the <b>myocardial</b> antioxidant defense reserve.|$|E
25|$|Because aortic {{dissection}} {{may present}} {{to the emergency room}} physician similar to a <b>myocardial</b> infarction, the physician must be careful to make the proper diagnosis prior to initiating treatment for <b>myocardial</b> infarction since the treatment regimen for <b>myocardial</b> infarction can be lethal to an individual presenting with aortic dissection.|$|E
25|$|Western {{blotting}} is {{a fundamental}} technique of biochemistry and is therefore used by many researchers to prove different properties of proteins, based on molecular weight. Specifically, it has been employed by a research group with one publication depicting investigations of rapamycin treatment, acute <b>myocardial</b> ischemia-reperfusion injury and <b>myocardial</b> necrosis among many others. For this research, western blotting analysis helped confirm effective inhibition of <b>myocardial</b> mTOR kinase activities by analyzing protein molecular weights versus expected values. This study's conclusion: By using the western blot technique, the researchers were able to discover that by pre-treating healthy pigs with rapamycin before acute <b>myocardial</b> IRI, rapamycin is associated with decreased cardiac function and higher <b>myocardial</b> necrosis.|$|E
25|$|These micro RNAs have pivotal {{roles in}} {{development}} and physiology of muscle tissues including the heart. MiR-1 {{is known to}} be involved in important role in heart diseases such as hypertrophy, <b>myocardial</b> infarction, and arrhythmias. Studies have shown that MiR-1 is an important regulator of heart adaption after ischemia or ischaemic stress and it is upregulated in the remote myocardium of patients with <b>myocardial</b> infarction. Also MiR-1 is downregulated in <b>myocardial</b> infarcted tissue compared to healthy heart tissue. Plasma levels of MiR-1 {{can be used as a}} sensitive biomarker for <b>myocardial</b> infarction.|$|E
25|$|While {{the pain}} may be {{confused}} with the pain of a <b>myocardial</b> infarction (heart attack), aortic dissection is usually not associated with the other signs that suggest <b>myocardial</b> infarction, including heart failure and ECG changes.|$|E
25|$|A study {{published}} in 1997 found an inverse association between death from coronary heart disease and frequency of orgasm even given the risk that <b>myocardial</b> ischaemia and <b>myocardial</b> infarction can be triggered by sexual activity.|$|E
25|$|The Belfast {{system was}} {{established}} to reach patients with acute <b>myocardial</b> infarction. The resuscitated patients were those whose hearts fibrillated after the ambulance was at the scene or en route. The system reacted too slowly to resuscitate persons who fibrillated before the call was placed. In 1966, {{it was assumed that}} most cardiac deaths in the community were the result of acute <b>myocardial</b> infarction. It was not appreciated that ventricular fibrillation can occur without <b>myocardial</b> infarction and have only seconds of warning—or none at all.|$|E
25|$|It {{can also}} be used as a marker of <b>myocardial</b> infarction. Following a <b>myocardial</b> infarction, levels of LDH peak at 3–4 days and remain {{elevated}} for up to 10 days. In this way, elevated levels of LDH (where the level of LDH1 is higher than that of LDH2, i.e. the LDH Flip, as normally, in serum, LDH2 is higher than LDH1) can be useful for determining whether a patient has had a <b>myocardial</b> infarction if they come to doctors several days after an episode of chest pain.|$|E
25|$|Bypass surgery {{does not}} prevent future <b>myocardial</b> infarctions.|$|E
25|$|<b>Myocardial</b> {{infarction}} due to embolism, hypoperfusion, or graft failure.|$|E
25|$|Allen died on 11 May 1982 at Sovereign Hill of {{diabetes}} and <b>myocardial</b> infarction.|$|E
25|$|Iwerks died in 1971 of a <b>myocardial</b> {{infarction}} in Burbank, California, aged 70.|$|E
25|$|Jackson {{died from}} a <b>myocardial</b> {{infarction}} and was interred at Mount Auburn Cemetery in Baltimore.|$|E
25|$|In the Rotterdam Study, Bots et al. {{followed}} 7,983 patients >55 {{years of}} age for a mean period of 4.6 years, and reported 194 incident <b>myocardial</b> infarctions within this period. CIMT was significantly higher in the <b>myocardial</b> infarction group {{compared to the other}} group. Demircan et al. found that the CIMT of patients with acute coronary syndrome were significantly increased compared to patients with stable angina pectoris.|$|E
25|$|<b>Myocardial</b> {{infarction}} (heart attack) {{occurs in}} 1–2% of aortic dissections. The {{cause of the}} infarction is involvement of the coronary arteries, which supply the heart, in the dissection. The right coronary artery is involved more commonly than the left coronary artery. If the <b>myocardial</b> infarction is treated with thrombolytic therapy, the mortality increases to over 70%, mostly due to bleeding into the pericardial sac causing pericardial tamponade.|$|E
25|$|<b>Myocardial</b> {{infarction}} {{is associated}} {{with high levels of}} circulating epinephrine and norepinephrine, particularly in cardiogenic shock.|$|E
25|$|Late graft stenosis, {{particularly}} of saphenous vein grafts due to atherosclerosis causing recurrent angina or <b>myocardial</b> infarction.|$|E
25|$|Secondary {{prevention}} of <b>myocardial</b> infarction, stroke, unstable angina, and revascularization {{in people with}} established coronary heart disease.|$|E
25|$|Fontaine died on January 30, 2005 {{following}} an <b>myocardial</b> infarction at the Hospital Saint-François d'Assise in Québec.|$|E
25|$|Some {{studies of}} other coxibs have also shown {{increase}} {{in the risk of}} cardiovascular events, while others have not. For instance, the Adenoma Prevention with Celecoxib study (APC) showed a dose-related increase in risk of cardiovascular death, <b>myocardial</b> infarction, stroke, or heart failure when taking celecoxib compared to placebo; and the Successive Celecoxib Efficacy and Safety Study I (SUCCESS-I) showed increased risk of <b>myocardial</b> infarction when taking 100nbsp&mg twice a day of celecoxib compared to diclofenac and naproxen; but taking 200nbsp&mg twice a day had lower incidence of <b>myocardial</b> infarction compared to diclofenac and naproxen. Nussmeier et al. (2005) showed in a study increase in incidence of cardiovascular events when taking parecoxib and valdecoxib (compared to placebo) after coronary artery bypass surgery.|$|E
25|$|The Killip {{classification}} {{consists of}} 4 classes based on clinical symptoms. It predicts 30-day mortality after <b>myocardial</b> infarction.|$|E
25|$|High risk: atrial {{fibrillation}} and paroxysmal {{atrial fibrillation}}, rheumatic {{disease of the}} mitral or aortic valve disease, artificial heart valves, known cardiac thrombus of the atrium or ventricle, sick sinus syndrome, sustained atrial flutter, recent <b>myocardial</b> infarction, chronic <b>myocardial</b> infarction together with ejection fraction <28 percent, symptomatic congestive heart failure with ejection fraction <30 percent, dilated cardiomyopathy, Libman-Sacks endocarditis, Marantic endocarditis, infective endocarditis, papillary fibroelastoma, left atrial myxoma and {{coronary artery bypass graft}} (CABG) surgery.|$|E
25|$|Improvement in <b>myocardial</b> {{perfusion}} (blood supply) after FGF-1 {{treatment as}} demonstrated by single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) imaging.|$|E
25|$|In 1999 Xiao Qian {{died at the}} age of 90 of <b>myocardial</b> {{infarction}} and {{renal failure}} in Beijing.|$|E
25|$|Nitroglycerin is {{used for}} the {{treatment}} of angina, acute <b>myocardial</b> infarction, severe hypertension, and acute coronary artery spasms.|$|E
25|$|People with RA {{are more}} prone to atherosclerosis, and risk of <b>myocardial</b> {{infarction}} (heart attack) and stroke is markedly increased.|$|E
25|$|Lidocaine is {{also the}} most {{important}} class-1b antiarrhythmic drug; it is used intravenously for the treatment of ventricular arrhythmias (for acute <b>myocardial</b> infarction, digoxin poisoning, cardioversion, or cardiac catheterization) if amiodarone is not available or contraindicated. Lidocaine should be given for this indication after defibrillation, CPR, and vasopressors have been initiated. A routine preventative dose is no longer recommended after a <b>myocardial</b> infarction as the overall benefit is not convincing.|$|E
25|$|Mostly {{the result}} of a thrombo{{embolism}}. Commonly the embolism is caused by atrial fibrillation, valvular disease, <b>myocardial</b> infarction, or cardiomyopathy.|$|E
25|$|Vitamin D {{supplements}} do {{not alter}} the outcomes for <b>myocardial</b> infarction, stroke or cerebrovascular disease, cancer, bone fractures or knee osteoarthritis.|$|E
25|$|The {{atrioventricular}} node position differs from other fowl. It {{is located in}} the endocardium of the atrial surface of the right atrioventricular valve. It is not covered by connective tissue, which is characteristic of vertebrate heart anatomy. It also contains fewer myofibrils than usual <b>myocardial</b> cells. The AV node connects the atrial and ventricular chambers. It functions to carry the electrical impulse from the atria to the ventricle. Upon view, the <b>myocardial</b> cells are observed to have large densely packed chromosomes within the nucleus.|$|E
25|$|Diclofenac {{is similar}} in COX-2 {{selectivity}} to celecoxib. A review by FDA Medical Officer David Graham concluded diclofenac does {{increase the risk of}} <b>myocardial</b> infarction.|$|E
25|$|Several radiopharmaceuticals and {{radionuclides}} may be {{used for}} this, each giving different information. In the <b>myocardial</b> perfusion scans using Tc-99m, the radiopharmaceuticals 99mTc-tetrofosmin (Myoview, GE Healthcare) or 99mTc-sestamibi (Cardiolite, Bristol-Myers Squibb) are used. Following this, <b>myocardial</b> stress is induced, either by exercise or pharmacologically with adenosine, dobutamine or dipyridamole(Persantine), which increase the heart rate or by regadenoson(Lexiscan), a vasodilator. (Aminophylline can be used to reverse the effects of dipyridamole and regadenoson). Scanning may then be performed with a conventional gamma camera, or with SPECT/CT.|$|E
