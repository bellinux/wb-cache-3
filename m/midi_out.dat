5|$|The {{new sound}} chip and <b>MIDI</b> <b>out</b> {{abilities}} {{were exposed to}} the BASIC programming language with the command PLAY and a new command SPECTRUM was added to switch the machine into 48K mode, keeping the current BASIC program intact (although {{there is no way to}} switch back to 128K mode). To enable BASIC programmers to access the additional memory, a RAM disk was created where files could be stored in the additional 80KB of RAM. The new commands took the place of two existing user-defined-character spaces causing compatibility problems with certain BASIC programs.|$|E

50|$|A {{common mistake}} is the {{mismatch}} between RTP-MIDI endpoints and RTP-MIDI sessions, since they both represent {{a pair of}} MIDI IN / <b>MIDI</b> <b>OUT</b> ports.|$|E
50|$|The MIDI {{specification}} for {{the electrical}} interface {{is based on}} a fully isolated current loop. The <b>MIDI</b> <b>out</b> port nominally sources a +5 volt source through a 220 ohm resistor out through pin 4 on the <b>MIDI</b> <b>out</b> DIN connector, in on pin 4 of the receiving device's MIDI in DIN connector, through a 220 ohm protection resistor and the LED of an opto-isolator. The current then returns via pin 5 on the MIDI in port to the originating device's <b>MIDI</b> <b>out</b> port pin 5, again with a 220 ohm resistor in the path, giving a nominal current of about 5 milliamperes. Despite the cable's appearance, there is no conductive path between the two MIDI devices, only an optically isolated one. Properly designed MIDI devices are relatively immune to ground loops and similar interference. The data rate on this system is 31,250 bits per second, logic 0 being current on.|$|E
50|$|The MCB-1 {{has four}} DIN connectors: 1 MIDI IN, 2 <b>MIDI</b> <b>OUT,</b> a SYNC OUT (possibly MTC) and three mini jack (3.5 mm) connectors: TAPE IN and OUT and a METRONOME OUT.|$|E

50|$|It {{supports}} MIDI, {{having a}} <b>MIDI</b> <b>Out</b> connector {{which allows the}} keyboard to control external MIDI equipment. It {{does not have a}} MIDI In connector. Although originally made for the consumer market, this keytar's <b>MIDI</b> <b>out</b> features are very powerful. Its drum rhythms and accompaniment are transmitted on separate MIDI channels, so that an external drum machine, sampler, or other MIDI equipment can be programmed to play the backing parts. Drums are transmitted on channel 16; Bass on 15; and three chord harmonies on channels 12-14. MIDI start/stop and tempo sync are also transmitted so an external sequencer may be utilized as well.|$|E

5000|$|S-MPU-IIAT (Super MPU II): for the IBM or {{compatible}} Plug and Play PC's (16 bit ISA). It had a Mini-DIN {{female connector}} for the breakout box with two MIDI In connectors and two <b>MIDI</b> <b>Out</b> connectors. A TSR {{has to be}} loaded for the MPU-401 to be intelligent in MS-DOS.|$|E
50|$|<b>MIDI</b> In, <b>Out,</b> and Thru are {{supplied}} with full dynamic velocity sensitivity. Each module may {{be assigned to}} any MIDI note number and independent channel, and several modules may have the same note number and channel, if desired. MIDI note and channel settings are preserved when the F16 is turned off or unplugged.|$|R
50|$|The MKS-80 has a 64 patch {{internal}} memory (8 {{banks of}} 8 patches each) {{along with an}} optional memory cartridge called the M-64C with room for another 128 (2 banks of 64 each). A full MIDI implementation {{is built into the}} MKS-80, with <b>MIDI</b> IN, <b>OUT</b> and THRU jacks positioned {{at the rear of the}} unit.|$|R
50|$|The {{interface}} {{is handled}} by <b>MIDI</b> In, <b>Out</b> and Thru connections {{on the back}} of the synth. There are 3 foot control switches of which 2 are assignable. There's also a serial To Host port for direct connection to a Mac or PC. Drivers can be downloaded from the XG software page on the Yamaha website.|$|R
5000|$|The RTP-MIDI driver from Apple creates virtual MIDI ports (named [...] "Sessions") {{which are}} {{available}} as MIDI ports in any software (like sequencers or software instruments) using CoreMIDI, where they appear {{as a pair of}} MIDI IN / <b>MIDI</b> <b>OUT</b> ports (like any other MIDI 1.0 port or USB MIDI ports).|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: The MIDI ports on {{the rear}} of the instrument. The three jacks are, from left to right, [...] "Thru", [...] "Out" [...] and [...] "In". The <b>MIDI</b> <b>out</b> jack can be used to send the player's {{keyboard}} presses to another MIDI-compatible instrument or computer. The MIDI in jack can be used to send an external MIDI controller's instructions to the DX-7.|$|E
50|$|Hymnsoft version 3.1 is {{the current}} version of the software. It {{includes}} new recordings of all music, hymns, and psalms in the Christian Worship hymnal, Christian Worship Supplement, and Christian Worship Occasional Services. The scripting method has been greatly improved and <b>midi</b> <b>out</b> functionality has been retained. Planning Christian Worship materials have been moved to their own product and are available as downloadable files.|$|E
50|$|Y3K: Soundtrack to the Future {{is a mix}} album, {{which is}} part of the Y3K/Y4K series, created by Distinct'ive Breaks. The album {{contains}} music by BT, General <b>Midi,</b> Hybrid, Way <b>Out</b> West, Sasha & Timo Maas.|$|R
50|$|Two {{models were}} released: the Alpha Juno 1 (JU-1) (1985), and the Alpha Juno 2 (JU-2) (1985), which added one octave of notes, a {{cartridge}} slot and touch-sensitivity. Alpha Juno synthesizers were notable for their reduced user interface {{compared to other}} synths of the day, with a single Alpha Dial replacing many sliders and knobs. The keyboard features <b>MIDI</b> in, <b>out</b> and thru, mono, stereo and headphone sockets. It also supports an external footpedal controller, and tape backup.|$|R
5000|$|The {{back panel}} {{is unusual in}} that it is tilted from {{vertical}} so that the connectors {{can be seen from the}} front of the instrument. There are quarter-inch jacks for recording data to cassette tape, sustain and program change footpedal jacks, <b>MIDI</b> in, <b>out</b> and [...] "thru" [...] DIN connectors, a monaural quarter-inch audio output, a quarter-inch headphone jack, and memory protect and power switches. Some models have a voltage selection for the power supply on the underneath of the synth.|$|R
50|$|Most MIDI capable {{instruments}} {{feature a}} MIDI IN, <b>MIDI</b> <b>OUT,</b> and occasionally a MIDI THRU connection {{in the form}} of five-pin DIN connectors. In order to build a two-way physical connection between two devices, a pair of cables must be used. The MIDI THRU jack simply echoes the signal entering the device at MIDI-IN. This makes it possible to control several devices from a single source.|$|E
50|$|The {{new sound}} chip and <b>MIDI</b> <b>out</b> {{abilities}} {{were exposed to}} the BASIC programming language with the command PLAY and a new command SPECTRUM was added to switch the machine into 48K mode, keeping the current BASIC program intact (although {{there is no way to}} switch back to 128K mode).

5000|$|These {{instruments}} were breath-sensitive for volume. Unlike other digital wind controllers, the breath actually {{flows through the}} instrument, making it feel similar to an acoustic woodwind instrument. Each came with a small built-in speaker, and also had an output cable for external amplification. <b>MIDI</b> <b>OUT</b> capability of the instrument means {{that it can be}} used to control sounds from other MIDI synthesizers that offered a MIDI IN connection. These features, as well as the low price (since it was initially marketed as a toy), increased its appeal to budget-minded musicians.|$|E
5000|$|Compatible with: CoreMIDI (<b>MIDI</b> in and <b>out),</b> Virtual <b>MIDI,</b> Line 6 MIDI Mobilizer I & II, iRig, iRig Mic, iRig MIDI, Yamaha i-MX1, Apogee Jam, Blue Mikey, Alesis IO Dock, iConnectMIDI, Line 6 Mobile Keys, Line 6 Mobile In, Tascam iU2 {{and many}} more.|$|R
5000|$|The {{back panel}} has quarter-inch jacks for {{recording}} data to cassette tape, sustain and program change footpedal jacks, <b>MIDI</b> in, <b>out</b> and [...] "thru" [...] DIN connectors, stereo quarter-inch audio outputs (with a cable plugged into only the left output the stereo signal is summed to mono), a quarter-inch stereo headphone jack, a quarter-inch arpeggiator trigger input jack, and memory protect and power switches.It also has special inputs {{for use with}} Akai's S612, S700, and X7000 samplers, allowing you to run the samplers' voices through the AX-60's analog filters and envelopes.|$|R
50|$|The {{back panel}} has quarter-inch jacks for {{recording}} data to cassette tape (one also doubling as a footswitch input), <b>MIDI</b> in and <b>out</b> DIN connectors, separate quarter-inch audio outputs {{for each of}} the two sounds and a mix audio out (both sounds combined), a power switch, and a fuse socket.|$|R
5000|$|Users can compose in PROGRESSION both in {{standard}} notation and tablature ("TAB") {{at the same}} time and hear their musical ideas played back with digital samples from Victor Wooten (bass), Roy [...] "Futureman" [...] Wooten (drums), Neil Zaza (guitar), and others. Playback features include built-in effects, amp simulators, customizable bends and slides, and continuous real-time control of playback tempos. With its <b>MIDI</b> <b>Out</b> features, a user can incorporate sounds from other sound libraries outside of PROGRESSION. Target users include beginning guitarists, emerging composers, music students, and home hobbyists.|$|E
5000|$|Every MIDI {{connection}} is a one-way connection from the <b>MIDI</b> <b>Out</b> connector of the sending device to the MIDI In connector of the receiving device. Each such connection {{can carry a}} stream of MIDI messages, with most messages representing a common musical performance event or gesture such as note-on, note-off, controller value change (including volume, pedal, modulation signals, etc.), pitch bend, program change, aftertouch, channel pressure. All of those messages include channel number. There are 16 possible channels in the protocol. The channels are used to separate [...] "voices" [...] or [...] "instruments", somewhat like tracks in a multi-track mixer.|$|E
5000|$|The IBM DA15 PC game {{connector}} {{has been}} modified {{to add a}} (usually MPU-401 compatible) MIDI interface, and this is often implemented in the game connectors on third-party sound cards, for example the Sound Blaster line from Creative Labs. The [...] "standard" [...] straight game adapter connector (introduced by IBM) has three ground pins and four +5 V power pins, and the MIDI adaptation replaces one of the grounds {{and one of the}} +5 V pins, both on the bottom row of pins, with MIDI In and <b>MIDI</b> <b>Out</b> signal pins. (There is no MIDI Thru provided.) Creative Labs introduced this adaptation.|$|E
50|$|The 1985 Atari ST was {{the first}} home {{computer}} to sport the original five-pin DIN format, making it a very popular platform for running MIDI sequencer software. Most PC soundcards from the late 1990s {{had the ability to}} terminate a MIDI connection, usually through a <b>MIDI</b> IN/MIDI <b>OUT</b> converter on the game port. The game port has been supplanted in the modern PC by USB devices, and so typically a PC owner will need to purchase a MIDI interface that attaches to the USB or FireWire port of their machine to use MIDI. Most current digital audio interfaces are equipped with MIDI ports.|$|R
50|$|Some {{computers}} {{or their}} sound cards have 15-pin D-subminiature connectors, called game ports, {{that can be}} used for <b>MIDI</b> IN/MIDI <b>OUT.</b> The connector supports both MIDI and analog joystick functions. Access to the MIDI signals is provided by a short adapter cable that converts the D-subminiature pinout into DIN connectors. The recommended method of connecting two 5-pin DIN cables to a 15-pin D-subminiature computer port can be found at the MIDI.org web site. The MIDI specification very conservatively states that the maximum distance MIDI can be transmitted is 15 meters (50 feet), but it can normally go much farther.|$|R
5000|$|Intended to {{represent}} Sequential's first {{entry into the}} low-cost digital sampler market, the Prophet 2000 was equipped with 256 kilowords of sample memory (word length of 12 bits = 1 sample), and sampling rates of 16, 32, and 42 kHz at 12-bit audio resolution. External storage was available through 3.5" [...] diskettes. The Prophet 2000 featured <b>MIDI</b> (in, <b>out,</b> and thru), 8-voice polyphony, up to 8 layers, and an arpeggiator. Despite their technological limitations, early digital samplers like the Prophet 2000 are noted for their warm audio quality {{as a result of}} using analog VCFs and VCAs.|$|R
