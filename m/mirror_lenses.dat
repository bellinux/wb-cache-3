50|$|The Minolta/Sony Reflex 500mm lens is {{the only}} {{production}} mirror lens designed to auto focus with an SLR camera. There are other <b>mirror</b> <b>lenses</b> that can mount onto current mounts such as Canon EF-mount and Nikon F-mount, but all of these <b>mirror</b> <b>lenses</b> are manual focus only. Only this lens can have its focus controlled by the camera's autofocus motor in conjunction with TTL autofocus sensing. In terms of the Minolta AF and subsequent Sony α SLR systems, this lens is an anomaly, being the only lens guaranteed to auto focus at 8. Minolta also produced a V-mount 400 mm f/8 Reflex lens that can autofocus at 8, but only the Minolta Vectis S-1, Minolta Vectis S-100 and Minolta Dimâge RD 3000 can use it.|$|E
50|$|Dedicated {{photographic}} <b>mirror</b> <b>lenses</b> {{fell out}} of favor in the 1980s for various reasons. However, commercial reflector astronomical Maksutov-Cassegrain and Schmidt-Cassegrain telescopes with 14 to 20 inch (or even larger) diameter primary mirrors are available. With an accessory camera adapter, they are 4000mm f/11 to f/8 equivalent.|$|E

50|$|The Reflex 500mm 8 lens is a supertelephoto {{mirror lens}} of high optical quality which shares the unique {{characteristics}} of all <b>mirror</b> <b>lenses</b> {{with a central}} obstruction. Since its aperture is fixed at 8, it lacks FD signals and controls. It must be used in manual or stopped-down metering mode.|$|E
5000|$|The lens uses manual focus only. As all <b>mirror</b> <b>lenses,</b> it can {{not change}} the aperture. Only {{available}} mount is the T-Mount and can be connected to several other mounts via adapter. Currently no hood is available. Filter can be either 72 mm at the front or 30.5 screwed in at the rear side ...|$|E
50|$|By using {{a mirror}} design {{similar to that}} of a telescope, this lens uses very little glass {{compared}} to traditional telephoto lenses and is thus much smaller, lighter, and far less expensive than traditional lenses in the same focal length. However, this and all other <b>mirror</b> <b>lenses</b> can produce an undesirable donut-shaped bokeh in the image it produces.|$|E

50|$|The 1:5.6 and 1:8.0/500 mm Rubinar Catadioptric (<b>mirror)</b> <b>lenses</b> are {{sometimes}} adapted {{to fit on}} Kiev medium format cameras. Shift and Tilt-Shift lenses based on the 45 mm and 65 mm optics are also available. These lenses allow photographers {{to take advantage of}} the Scheimpflug principle for achieving greater apparent depth of field without adjusting the aperture, and gain other controls similar to those found on view cameras.|$|E
5000|$|There is no precise {{definition}} of bokeh and no objective tests for it - {{as with all}} aesthetic judgments. However, symmetrical optical formulae such as the Rapid-Rectilinear/Aplanat and the Double Gauss are usually considered pleasing, while asymmetric retrofocus wide angle and telephoto lenses are often thought harsh. The unique [...] "donut" [...] bokeh produced by <b>mirror</b> <b>lenses</b> because of the optical pathway obstruction of the secondary mirror is especially polarizing.|$|E
50|$|He was {{allied with}} Gladiator against Daredevil. The Death-Stalker {{traveled}} to the Florida Everglades in search of papers relating to Ted Sallis's experiments, and encountered the Man-Thing. He later stole a set of ancient Lemurian <b>mirror</b> <b>lenses</b> from various museums, and used them to create a powerful gun in order to destroy Daredevil. However, Daredevil destroyed the gun, {{and in the midst}} of their battle, Death-Stalker was mysteriously discorporated by the Sky-Walker. He reappeared in a third costumed guise as the new Death's-Head, gifting an enforcer called Smasher with super-human powers, and kidnapping Karen Page in order to force her to give him the original Death's Head's research. He was defeated by Daredevil and the Ghost Rider, killing Smasher with his touch during the battle.|$|E

50|$|In optical {{apparatuses}} such as curved <b>mirrors,</b> <b>lenses</b> or prisms, chromatic aberrations, i.e., unintended {{separation of}} colors, may occur. However, when optical aberrations distort monochromatic light {{the effect is}} called monochromatic aberration.|$|R
50|$|Various {{types of}} {{catadioptric}} systems {{are also used}} in camera lenses known alternatively as catadioptric lenses (CATs), reflex lenses, or <b>mirror</b> <b>lenses.</b> These lenses use some form of the cassegrain design which greatly reduces the physical length of the optical assembly, partly by folding the optical path, but mostly through the telephoto effect of the convex secondary mirror which multiplies the focal length many times (up to 4 to 5 times). This creates lenses with focal lengths from 250 mm up to and beyond 1000 mm that are much shorter and compact than their long-focus or telephoto counterparts. Moreover, chromatic aberration, a major problem with long refractive lenses, and off-axis aberration, a major problem with reflective telescopes, is almost completely eliminated by the catadioptric system, making the image they produce suitable to fill the large focal plane of a camera.|$|E
50|$|The biggest {{advantage}} of catadioptric systems (panoramic <b>mirror</b> <b>lenses)</b> {{is that because}} one uses mirrors to bend the light rays instead of lenses (like fish eye), the image has almost no chromatic aberrations or distortions. The image, {{a reflection of the}} surface on the mirror, {{is in the form of}} a doughnut to which software is applied in order to create a flat panoramic picture. Such software is normally supplied by the company who produces the system. Because the complete panorama is imaged at once, dynamic scenes can be captured without problems. Panoramic video can be captured and has found applications in robotics and journalism. The mirror lens system uses only a partial section of the digital camera's sensor and therefore some pixels are not used. Recommendations are always to use a camera with a high pixel count in order to maximize the resolution of the final image.|$|E
