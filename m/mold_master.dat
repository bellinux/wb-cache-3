40|$|Lab-on-a-chip (LOC) {{and other}} {{microfluidic}} devices for medical applications {{need to be}} mass produced at a low fabrication cost because the disposable device is destroyed after a single use to avoid sample contamination. In this paper, a new method for rapidly fabricating metallic micromold masters for manufacturing large volumes of polymeric microfluidic devices is presented. Polymers are preferred over silicon as the device material due to their better compatibility with biological and chemical substances. The manufacturing method involves laser micromachining of the desired imprint features from thin metallic sheets and then microwelding them onto a substrate to form the final <b>mold</b> <b>master.</b> The polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) elastomer is then poured over the mold and cured to produce the microfluidic device. The proposed method involves fewer processing steps than the soft lithography, electroplating and molding (LIGA) process. To verify the method, a metallic mold for a passive Y-channel microfluidic mixer was fabricated. The <b>mold</b> <b>master</b> was made from low-cost steel and the mold manufacturing process can be completed within an hour. PDMS elastomer is then poured over the mold and cured to produce the mixer. The channels of the mixer were 75 micrometers wide and 50 micrometers high. The mixer created from the mold was tested by mixing two streams of colored water in it. The maximum flow rate achieved by the prototype was 6. 4 microlitres per minute.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a new method for rapid fabrication of polymeric micromold masters for {{the manufacture of}} polymer microfluidic devices. The manufacturing method involves laser micromachining of the desired structure of microfluidic channels in a thin metallic sheet and then hot embossing the channel structure onto poly(methyl methacrylate) PMMA substrate to form the <b>mold</b> <b>master.</b> The channeled layer of the microfluidic device is then produced by pouring the polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) elastomer over the mold and curing it. The method {{is referred to as}} LHEM (laser micromachining, hot embossing and molding). Polymers like PDMS are preferred over silicon as the material for building microfluidic devices because of their biocompatibility properties as well as because of their lower cost. The proposed manufacturing method involves fewer processing steps than the conventional soft lithography process and enables manufacture of non-rectangular channels in microfluidic devices. To test the method, a mold for a micro capillary electrophoresis microfluidic chip was fabricated. The experimental results confirmed that high quality (Ra 10 to 100 nm) molds can be fabricated quickly and inexpensively. Advantages and limitations of the proposed method are discussed in the concluding section of the paper. Peer reviewed: YesNRC publication: Ye...|$|E

30|$|For {{the molding}} process, PDMS (Sylgard 184, Dow Corning, Midland, MI, USA) was first mixed with its curing agent {{at the ratio}} of 10 : 1 and then casted onto the <b>master</b> <b>mold.</b> Next, we left the samples in a vacuum for {{approximately}} 2  h for degassing, during which time period the PDMS began to fill the holes on the <b>master</b> <b>mold.</b> Finally, the PDMS was cured at 100 °C for 4  h on a hotplate in atmospheric condition and peeled off from the <b>master</b> <b>mold.</b> To study {{the effect of the}} additional solvent treatment of the silane-coated <b>master</b> <b>mold</b> on PDMS molding, right before (undiluted) PDMS casting, some <b>master</b> <b>molds</b> were dipped into toluene or hexane for 1  min and dried with nitrogen gun.|$|R
40|$|A {{method of}} {{creating}} metallic micromolds with features that have high-aspect ratios {{is described in}} this paper. The proposed manufacturing process utilizes laser micromachining to cut the negative two-dimensional profiles of the desired microfeatures and fluidic network patterns on a 100 3 ̆bcm thick brass sheet. The positive relief of the cut pattern is then created by using electro-discharge micromachining (micro-EDM) die-sinking the metallic mask onto a brass substrate. The final substrate with the desired relief pattern becomes the molding tool used for either elastomer casting or thermoplastic hot embossing. To validate the proposed fabrication methodology and evaluate the quality of surface finishes, a brass <b>mold</b> <b>master</b> of a T-channel micromixer (50 3 ̆bcm width, 25 3 ̆bcm height) is developed and multiple replicated devices are cast on this mold using poly-di-methyl-siloxane (PDMS). The surface finish of both the original micromold master and final molded channels on PDMS are measured using an optical profiler and {{found to have a}} roughness of approximately 400 nm Ra. The ability of the proposed fabrication technique to create high-aspect ratio features is illustrated by manufacturing a Y-channel micromixer with an aspect ratio of 4. Experimental results are discussed and suggestions for improvement are presented. Peer reviewed: YesNRC publication: Ye...|$|E
40|$|Disposable {{microfluidic}} {{systems are}} used to avoid sample contamination {{in a variety of}} medical and environmental monitoring applications. A contactless hot intrusion (HI) process for fabricating reusable polymer micromolds with near "optical quality" surface finishes is described in this paper. A metallic hot intrusion mask with the desired microchannels and related passive components is first machined using a tightly focused beam from a diode-pumped solid-state (DPSS) laser. The polymer <b>mold</b> <b>master</b> is then created by pressing the 2 D metallic mask onto a polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) substrate. Since it is a contactless fabrication process the resultant 3 D micro-reliefs have near optical quality surface finishes. Unfortunately, the desired micro-relief dimensions (height and width) are not easily related to the hot intrusion process parameters of pressure, temperature, and time exposure profile. A finite element model is introduced to assist the manufacturing engineer in predicting the behavior of the PMMA substrate material as it deforms under heat and pressure during micromold manufacture. The FEM model assumes that thermo-plastics like PMMA become "rubber like" when heated to a temperature slightly above the glass transition temperature. By controlling the material temperature and maintaining its malleable state, it is possible to use the stress-strain relationship to predict the profile dimensions of the imprinted microfeature. Examples of curved microchannels fabricated using PMMA mold masters are presented to illustrate the proposed methodology and verify the finite element model. In addition, the non-contact formation of the micro-reliefs simplifies the demolding process and helps to preserve the high quality surface finishes. 9 2012 Copyright Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE).

40|$|Microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) based {{artificial}} sensory hairs for flow sensing {{have been}} widely explored, but the processes involved in their fabrication are lithography intensive, making the process quite expensive and cumbersome. Most of these devices are also based on silicon MEMS, which makes the fabrication of out-of plane 3 D flow sensors very challenging. This thesis aims to develop new fabrication technologies based on Polymer MEMS, with minimum dependence on lithography for the fabrication of piezoresistive 3 D out-of-plane artificial sensory hairs for sensing of air flow. Moreover, the fabrication of a flexible sensor array is proposed and new materials are also explored for the sensing application. Soft lithography based approaches are first investigated for the fabrication of an all elastomer device that is tested in a bench top wind tunnel. Micromolding technologies allow for the mass fabrication of microstructures using a single, reusable <b>mold</b> <b>master</b> that is fabricated by SU- 8 photolithography, reducing the need for repetitive processing. Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) is used as the device material and sputter deposited gold is used as both the piezoresistive {{as well as the}} electrode material for collection of device response. The fabrication results of PDMS to PDMS metal transfer micromolding (MTM) are shown and the limitations of the process are also discussed. A dissolving mold metal transfer micromolding process is then proposed and developed, which overcomes the limitations of the conventional MTM process pertinent to the present application. Testing results of devices fabricated using the dissolving mold process are discussed with emphasis on the role of micro-cr  acking as one failure mode in elastomeric devices with thin film metal electrodes. Finally, a laser microfabrication based approach using thin film Kapton as the device material and an electrically conductive carbon-black elastomer composite as the piezoresistor is proposed and demonstrated. Laminated sheets of thick and thin Kapton form the flexible substrate on which the conductive elastomer piezoresistors are stencil printed. Excimer laser ablation is used to make the micro-stencil as well as to release the Kapton cantilevers. The fluid-structure interaction is improved by the deposition of a thin film of silicon dioxide, which produces a stress-gradient induced curvature, strongly enhancing the device sensitivity. This new approach also enables the fabrication of backside interconnects, thereby addressing the commonly observed problem of flow intrusion while using conventional interconnection technologies like wire-bonding. Devices with varying dimensions of the sensing element are fabricated and the results presented, with smallest devices having a width of 400 microns and a length of 1. 5 mm with flow sensitivities as high as 60 Ohms/m/s. Recommendations are also proposed for further optimization of the device. M. S. Committee Chair: Allen, Mark; Committee Member: Allen, Sue Ann Bidstrup; Committee Member: Wong, C. P...|$|E
