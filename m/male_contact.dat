40|$|Arginine {{vasopressin}} (AVP) is a neuropeptide hormone and neurotransmitter {{that has}} peripheral functions in water regulation, and central {{functions in the}} stress response and social bonding in male rodents. In this study, we investigated the role of AVP in partner preference behavior in a monogamous primate, the coppery titi monkey (Callicebus cupreus). Seven titi males each received three intranasal treatments: saline, low AVP (40 IU) and high AVP (80 IU) in random order, 1 week apart. They experienced a series of stimulus exposures to their female partner, a female stranger and an empty cage. Males {{were more likely to}} contact the stimulus and do so faster when either female stimulus was present. When pretreated with saline, <b>males</b> <b>contacted</b> the stranger more frequently than their partner; when pretreated with the high dosage of AVP, <b>males</b> <b>contacted</b> their partner more frequently than the stranger. We used microarray to measure peripheral changes in gene expression associated with intranasal AVP and found reduced expression of several genes coding for proinflammatory cytokines.

40|$|Compared to {{the wealth}} of {{information}} available on male courtship behavior in Drosophila melanogaster, we know relatively little about female sexual behavior. The female's role during courtship has been historically relegated to "acceptance" or "rejection", often ignoring any of her precopulatory behaviors. In this study, I investigated three female precopulatory behaviors - ovipositor extrusion, immobility, and grooming - that potentially communicate information about her receptivity and modulate male behavior. Using high-resolution video recording, I (1) measured these behaviors at three different levels of male exposure, (2) measured female behavior before and after her own ovipositor extrusion, and (3) analyzed male behavior preceding and following ovipositor extrusion. In addition, I compared these behaviors between virgin and mated females. I report that ovipositor extrusion and immobility were sensitive to male presence. Specifically, both virgins and mated females extruded their ovipositor at a high rate during <b>male</b> <b>contact,</b> but performed no extrusions with no access or limited sensory access to a male. Only virgins increased immobility during <b>male</b> <b>contact,</b> while mated females maintained baseline locomotive activity {{at all levels of}} male exposure. Next, I report no difference in either the rate of ovipositor extrusion or {{the context in which the}} extrusion occurred between virgins and mated females. Although ovipositor extrusion did not immediately change the amount of male courtship, it did change the type of courtship behaviors that males expressed. Principally, males shifted from non-contact courtship behaviors to contact-mediated courtship behaviors immediately following ovipositor extrusion from both types of females. These results suggest that females are playing an active role during courtship...|$|E

40|$|A new {{combined}} methodology {{consisting of}} direct observation and {{two types of}} interviews (internal and external interviews) was evaluated for use in exposure risk assessment in schistosomiasis. Specific objectives were to determine its usefulness in achieving equitable coverage of gendered exposure risk and its efficiency in identifying water contact behavior {{in a rural area}} in Brazil with different settlement patterns, land use and domestic water supplies. Of the 2476 water contacts recorded, 1223 (49. 4 %) were identified by direct observation, 946 (38. 2 %) by internal interviews and 307 (12. 4 %) by external interviews. Significantly longer mean durations of contacts were recorded for females and greater mean percentage of body surface exposed for males (P< 0. 01), reflecting differences in gendered water contact activities. Direct observation identified slightly more <b>male</b> <b>contacts,</b> external interviews significantly more <b>male</b> <b>contacts</b> (P< 0. 006), and internal interviews moderately more female contacts. The three methods recorded mean numbers of contacts and mean TBM (total body minutes) per person, declining with age.

40|$|Welfare {{impacts of}} an {{intensive}} dairy technology package {{on women and}} their families are investigated on 32 smallholder crop-livestock farms in the sub-humid zone of Kilifi District, Coast Province, Kenya. Farms were stratified according to male or female extension contact. A female enumerator interviewed the wife or female head of household on each farm regarding her present and past household responsibilities and the effects of the intensive dairy enterprise on these duties and upon the welfare of the household. On three-quarters of the <b>male</b> <b>contact</b> farms, dairy operators were women. Across all farms, women performed half of all dairy-related activities, but only on female contact farms did income from the dairy enterprise accrue to women in proportion to their labor input. The equitable return of benefits to labor corresponded with better dairy unit performance on female contact farms, where women also indicated greater access to and autonomy over household resources and decision-making. Irrespective of extension contact, there was broad consensus among the women interviewed that intensive dairying has led to improved household welfare, primarily through increased household income and milk consumption. There was also wide agreement, however, that these gains have been achieved at the expense of more work for women. Women on female contact farms were observed spending dairy income on food for the household and childrens' schooling more often than their counterparts on <b>male</b> <b>contact</b> farms. Based on these and other findings, the study concludes that gender of the extension contact, dairy operator and farm owner were determinants of the intra-household impacts of intensive dairying on the smallholder farms in this study. Recommendations for design and delivery of livestock technologies for crop-based farming systems, with special emphasis on how to minimize negative impact on vulnerable household members, are inferred from study findings...|$|E

40|$|We preliminarily {{find that}} {{providing}} sustainable land management (SLM) training to standard contact farmers and having them maintain demonstration plots {{within the community}} on a whole had low impact on the knowledge and adoption of SLM practices. However, the aspect of our intervention that targeted a traditionally disadvantaged group {{as far as their}} access to extension services, women, was somewhat successful in terms of improving their SLM knowledge and adoption rates. Having a female contact farmer increased the number of SLM techniques adopted by women by 10 percent. Both male and female farmers in this treatment group identified female (not <b>male)</b> <b>contact</b> farmers as a source of learning for both SLM practices and non SLMpractices suggesting knowledge spillovers. Furthermore, farmers were additionally inclined to teach others what they have learned in the communities with female contact farmers.

Significant increase of Bb genotype (heterozygote carrier) of BsmI polymorphism (P = 0. 028) and FF genotype (homozygotes of common allele F) of FokI polymorphism (P = 0. 034) were observed in male PTB patients than <b>male</b> <b>contacts.</b> The BB genotype (homozygote of common allele B) of BsmI polymorphism and AA genotype (homozygote of common allele A) of ApaI polymorphism were increased in <b>male</b> <b>contacts</b> than <b>male</b> PTB patients (BB: P = 0. 018; AA: P = 0. 04). No significant differences were found among female patients and female contacts. In bacteriological relapse cases of PTB, a decreased frequency of AA genotype (P = 0. 015) and an increased frequency of Aa genotype (P = 0. 024) were observed in bacteriological relapse patients than quiescent patients of PTB. The present study suggests that Bb genotype of BsmI polymorphism and FF genotype of FokI polymorphism of VDR gene may be associated with the susceptibility to tuberculosis in males. The BB and AA genotypes may be associated with resistance to PTB in males.

If, during copulation, the female lands, the couple will disengage and the male will hover waiting for the female to take flight again; however, although the males almost always disengage and pause copulation when the female lands, there have been instances recorded in which the males will {{hold on to the}} female with all six legs and flap his wings in an attempt to lift her back into the air.|$|R

Opposing natural and sexual selection suggests that further evolution of the male pheromone may in part be limited by costs associated with attractive male CHC blends...|$|E
40|$|The {{courtship}} {{behavior of}} the navel orangeworm, Amyelois transitella, was examined in a wind tunnel. Sixty nine courtship sequences were analyzed and successful sequences divided into two categories: rapid courtship sequences, which involved few breaks in contact, short or no periods of male/female chasing and lasted 10 s. Fifty six (81 %) courtships were successful (50. 7 % rapid courtship and 30. 4 % prolonged courtship); the remaining 13 (18. 8 %) sequences were failed courtships.

Drawing on ethnographic fieldwork undertaken throughout the 2005 South Australian football season, as well as Internet research, we argue that the style of support engaged in by the Grog Squad represents a paradox for how we typically understand football fans. On the one hand, much of the language and behavior of the Grog Squad is characteristic of the aggressive masculinity common in <b>male</b> <b>contact</b> sports. On the other, being a Groggie provides access to a range of resources, benefits, networks, and supports that confound many of the popular assumptions about male social relationships in sport.
