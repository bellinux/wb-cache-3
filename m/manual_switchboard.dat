50|$|Many of the {{buildings}} in Collarenebri today date back to c.1910. Collarenebri was among the last places in Australia to be converted from a <b>manual</b> <b>switchboard</b> to an automatic telephone exchange (in 1986). Volunteers run Collarenebri's live, local radio station YAAMA-FM 95.9 specialising in indigenous programming.|$|E
50|$|By 1904 {{over three}} million phones in the U.S. were {{connected}} by <b>manual</b> <b>switchboard</b> exchanges. By 1914, the U.S. {{was the world}} leader in telephone density and had {{more than twice the}} teledensity of Sweden, New Zealand, Switzerland, and Norway. The relatively good performance of the U.S. occurred despite competing telephone networks not interconnecting.|$|E
25|$|In the {{ringdown}} method, the originating operator called another intermediate operator {{who would}} call the called subscriber, or {{passed it on to}} another intermediate operator. This chain of intermediate operators could complete the call only if intermediate trunk lines were available between all the centers at the same time. In 1943 when military calls had priority, a cross-country US call might take as long as 2 hours to request and schedule in cities that used <b>manual</b> <b>switchboards</b> for toll calls.|$|R
5000|$|Common {{connectors}} {{used with}} balanced circuits include modular connectors on telephone instruments and broadband data, and XLR connectors for professional audio. 1/4" [...] tip/ring/sleeve (TRS) phone connectors were once widely used on <b>manual</b> <b>switchboards</b> and other telephone infrastructure. Such connectors {{are now more}} commonly seen in miniature sizes (2.5 and 3.5 mm) being used for unbalanced stereo audio; however, professional audio equipment such as mixing consoles still commonly use balanced and unbalanced [...] "line-level" [...] connections with 1/4" [...] phone jacks.|$|R

50|$|In July 1951, during massive {{flooding}} in Kansas and Missouri, a <b>manual</b> <b>switchboard</b> in Manhattan, Kansas was abandoned as water levels {{rose in the}} central office; operators regained access to the town's four trunk lines from a local filling station on higher ground to send emergency messages and radiotelephone was used to bypass damaged facilities.|$|E
50|$|Often, the {{rationale}} for a separate rate center is arbitrary or based on historical factors which no longer apply. Some tiny place {{used to be a}} separate village or used to have a small <b>manual</b> <b>switchboard,</b> but was swallowed by urban or suburban sprawl years ago — yet the rate center (and a restrictive local calling area) still exists.|$|E

50|$|In {{the early}} days of telephony, through roughly the 1960s, {{companies}} used <b>manual</b> telephone <b>switchboards,</b> and switchboard operators connected calls by inserting a pair of phone plugs into the appropriate jacks.|$|R
2500|$|Early <b>manual</b> <b>switchboards</b> {{required}} the operator to operate listening keys and ringing keys, {{but by the}} late 1910s and 1920s, advances in switchboard technology led to features which allowed the call to be automatically answered immediately as the operator inserted the answering cord, and ringing would automatically begin {{as soon as the}} operator inserted the ringing cord into the called party’s jack. [...] The operator would be disconnected from the circuit, allowing her to handle another call, while the caller heard an audible ringback signal, so that that operator would not have to periodically report that she was continuing to ring the line.|$|R
50|$|The {{electromechanical}} {{automatic telephone}} exchange, invented by Almon Strowger in 1888, gradually replaced <b>manual</b> <b>switchboards</b> in central telephone exchanges around the world. In 1919, the Bell System in the United States also adopted automatic switching as its future technology, {{after years of}} reliance on manual systems. Nevertheless, many manual branch exchanges remained operational into {{the second half of}} the 20th century in many enterprises. Later electronic devices and computer technology gave the operator access to an abundance of features. A private branch exchange (PBX) in a business usually has an attendant console for the operator, or an auto-attendant, which bypasses the operator entirely.|$|R
5000|$|Destinations {{with numbers}} in {{non-standard}} lengths or formats may have required an operator dial the number or request assistance of an inward operator at destination. Rural party line numbers in manual exchanges were prone to awkward, non-standard numbering schemes like [...] "line 10, two long rings and one short" [...] which were gradually eliminated {{as the number}} of parties on a single line was reduced and the <b>manual</b> <b>switchboard</b> replaced by automatic dial equipment.|$|E

Today, the rooms are decorated according to international standard, equipped with air conditioner, heater, TV, mini-bar, phone and radio. English, German and French TV channels are also available. It has an internet cafe located in the basement. The telephone system is still operated by its original old <b>manual</b> <b>switchboard,</b> which was manufactured by Siemens.|$|E
5000|$|The E. H. Danner Museum of Telephony {{contains}} interesting {{models of}} telephones from the 1880s to modern times. Exhibits include {{a model of}} Alexander Graham Bell's [...] "Gallows Frame Phone", of which only five were assembled, a <b>manual</b> <b>switchboard,</b> an 1898 hotel lobby telephone, the Independent Telephone Pioneers Association Hall of Fame, which features photos and biographies of former Verizon leaders, and career memorabilia of former GTE Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Rocky Johnson. The museum occupies the old Officers' Quarters No. 4.|$|E
50|$|Tip {{and ring}} are {{the names of}} the two {{conductors}} or sides of a telephone line. The terms originate in reference to the telephone plugs used for connecting telephone calls in <b>manual</b> <b>switchboards.</b> One side of the line is connected to the metal tip of the plug, and the second is connected to a metal ring behind the tip, separated and insulated from the tip by a non-conducting material. When inserted into a jack, the plug's tip conductor connects first, followed by the ring conductor. In many European countries tip and ring are referred to as the A and B wires.|$|R
25|$|For {{compatibility}} with manual offices, {{two types of}} signaling were supported. In areas with mostly machine switches and a few <b>manual</b> <b>switchboards,</b> Panel Call Indicator (PCI) signaling lit lamps on the B operator's desk at the terminating manual office. The lamps illuminated digits on a display panel corresponding to the number dialed. The manual operator connected the call to the appropriate jack, and then repeated the process for the next incoming call. In areas with mostly manual switches, the Call Annunciator signaling system was used to avoid installing lamp panels at every operator station. The Call Annunciator used speech recorded on strips of photographic film to verbally announce the called number to the answering operator.|$|R
40|$|In its {{autonomic}} computing call to arms, IBM compared what the IT industry faced in 2001 to what {{occurred in the}} US telephony industry in the 1920 s. At that time, the rapid expansion and infiltration into daily life of the phone aroused serious concern that {{there would not be}} enough trained operators to work the <b>manual</b> <b>switchboards.</b> Analysts predicted that by the 1980 s, half the country’s population would have to become telephone operators to meet demand. AT&T/Bell System’s implementation of the automated switching protocol and other technological in-novations averted this crisis. In 2001, unfilled IT jobs in the US alone numbered in the hundreds of thousands, even in uncertain economic condi-tions, and global demand for IT workers was expected to increase by more than 100 percent in the next five years...|$|R
50|$|The museum also {{contains}} the UK's National Telephone Kiosk Collection. This {{is the largest}} collection of telephone kiosks {{in the country and}} is part of the Connected Earth heritage project. There are also three fully working analogue telephone exchanges (one of them a mobile TXE2), a <b>manual</b> <b>switchboard</b> and early automatic systems. The collection shows the complete history of telephone kiosks in the UK from 1912 to the 1990s together with demonstrations of how telephone calls were routed and connected before the advent of digital technology.|$|E
50|$|At {{the time}} of the 1918 merger, Home had 60,000 {{customers}} served from 16 dial offices. Sunset had 68,000 subscribers served from nine manual offices. Home's operations were sizable and the public felt Home provided better service than Sunset, so Pacific Telephone didn't convert the dial offices to manual as it had in the past. Instead, they took the highly unusual step of adding a dial and trunk lines to every <b>manual</b> <b>switchboard</b> position. In this way, former Sunset customers could reach the former Home subscribers via their central office operator.|$|E
50|$|The first {{central office}} was located at Wilcomb’s General Store, and that {{consisted}} of a small <b>manual</b> <b>switchboard.</b> Mr. Wilcomb would answer an incoming telephone call and connect it manually to the party being called between waiting on customers in the store. In 1914 it was relocated to a building at the junction of routes 121 and 121A, adjacent to the old Glidden Tavern, and there it remained for 44 years. A new building was constructed at 7 Derry Road (Route 102) in 1957 to house new central office switching equipment.|$|E
50|$|The Collis {{post office}} was opened in 1894, closed in 1899, re-established in 1904, and renamed Kerman in 1906. Kerman {{incorporated}} in 1946.

40|$|After {{identifying}} the general {{structure of a}} POTS (Plain Old Telephone System) Switching System we model individual components as communicating finite state machines. Formulating the finite state machines in Promela (Process Meta Language) allows us to verify general and specific properties of the model using the model-checker Spin. Modelling operational systems imposes design decisions, which we will consider in the appropriate context. 1 Introduction The development of telephone switching systems from <b>manual</b> <b>switchboards</b> to automated systems has required the development of control software. The development process of the switching software has in general been complex and evolutionary; this is sometimes reflected in the software which may be large, poorly structured and/or undocumented legacy code. Increasing user demands and advancing technology are forcing the provision of extensions to the software, usually {{in the form of}} features. Implementing features is not straightforwar [...] ...|$|R
50|$|The {{island was}} the first {{offshore}} island in the Ireland to get electricity from the Rural Electrification Scheme, run by the E.S.B., in 1957, but was amongst the last {{places in the country}} to get universally reliable piped water (in 1973-75) and an automatic phone exchange (in 1986). It went directly from a <b>manual</b> <b>switchboard</b> to an ISDN-enabled system, which had to be upgraded within weeks due to massive demand for consumer phone lines, as the previous exchange had been limited to issuing numbers to business ventures only, and only had 47 internal lines.|$|E
50|$|Woodbury Telephone began {{operation}} in the 1870s when a local businessman, Mr. Charles A. Stone visited the Philadelphia Centennial Exposition 1876 and realized the value of connecting his grain and feed store to the Southbury Railroad Station via the telephone. The company grew modestly and was incorporated in 1910 with Arthur D. Warner as its first President. The company continued in operation and upgraded from a <b>manual</b> <b>switchboard</b> to a direct dial system in 1955. As the service area grew considerably in the 1970s and 1980s the company deployed digital switching, fiber optic network architecture and in the 1990s it successfully introduced internet service with broadband access.|$|E
50|$|The size {{ranged from}} small {{mom and pop}} {{companies}} run by {{a husband and wife}} team, to large independent companies, such as GTE, Theodore Gary & Company, United Telecom, ConTel and Centel, which resembled the Bell system with vertical integration. GTE was the largest non-RBOC domestic telephone company, and included local operating companies, long line (toll) companies and manufacturing companies. A small mom and pop company might have had the husband doing the outside lines work and the wife operating a <b>manual</b> <b>switchboard.</b> Later these small companies would have a Class 5 telephone switch providing local automatic service. Much of this equipment was manufactured by the Automatic Electric Company, Stromberg-Carlson, and the Kellogg Switchboard & Supply Company.|$|E
40|$|Model-checking is {{becoming}} very popular for automated reasoning about hardware and software. The input {{can be in}} any language provided there is a translation to transition systems or Kripke structures; properties are then expressed in a temporal logic. Telephone switching systems are concurrent systems which are naturally described by a composition of interacting finite automata. We describe a model of one switching system in IO-Automata, express it in Promela (process meta language) and then formulate certain properties in LTL (linear temporal logic). Using the model-checker Spin, we have attempted to verify the model with respect to some properties. A particular challenge is that even a simple switching system leads to state space explosion. 1 Introduction Telephone switching systems have developed from <b>manual</b> <b>switchboards</b> to automated systems. The latter require control software, which is usually large, unstructured and not well documented (legacy software). On the other h [...] ...|$|R
50|$|Tarro's first {{post office}} was named Upper Hexham and was {{located at the}} railway station. Around 1918 the post office moved to Woodberry Road, and later to 13 Maitland Road (now Anderson Drive). The post office housed the <b>manual</b> {{telephone}} <b>switchboard</b> until automatic switching was introduced in 1957. The post office closed on 30 July 1993 and Tarro is now served by Beresfield Post Office.|$|R
50|$|The {{telephone}} services {{experienced a}} post-war boom for demand and {{it quickly became}} apparent that the existing exchange network was not sufficient. It was decided to rationalize the network and reduce the number of switches. Strangely, it was decided to continue with <b>manual</b> <b>switchboards.</b> The first exchanges to be converted were St Ouen and St Peter which were amalgamated to form Western exchange. The equipment at this exchange was supplied by Ericsson's of Beeston (later Plessey) and was an export cancellation, having originally been destined for Ethiopia. Northern Exchange which absorbed Sion, Trinity, St John and St Lawrence exchanges, was opened in 1951, Southern exchange which replaced St Aubin's exchange (La Moye was absorbed into St Aubin's exchange in 1946), in 1952 and Eastern exchange absorbing Five Oaks and Gorey (La Rocque exchange having been absorbed into Gorey in April 1946) in 1955. A relief exchange for Central was opened directly opposite in Lyric Hall, Cattle Street in 1953. all these exchanges were of the CB10 type supplied by GEC Telecommunications of Coventry. Later, on the opening of Central automatic exchange, the '-ern' suffix was removed because of the potential for confusion over poor transmission lines.|$|R
