25|$|Investors <b>Max</b> <b>Value</b> and Max Return are {{presented}} with two possible projects to invest in, called Big-Is-Best and Small-Is-Beautiful. Big-Is-Best requires a capital investment of 100,000 US dollars today, and the lucky investor will be repaid 132,000 US dollars in a year's time.

25|$|How {{can this}} be {{rational}} for both investors? The {{answer lies in the}} fact that the investors do not have to invest the full 100,000 US dollars. Max Return is content to invest only 10,000 US dollars for now. After all, Max Return may rationalize the outcome by thinking that maybe tomorrow there will be new opportunities available to invest the remaining 90,000 US dollars the bank is willing to lend Max Return, at even higher IRRs. Even if only seven more projects come along which are identical to Small-Is-Beautiful, Max Return would be able to match the NPV of Big-Is-Best, on a total investment of only 80,000 US dollars, with 20,000 US dollars left in the budget to spare for truly unmissable opportunities. <b>Max</b> <b>Value</b> is also happy, because she has filled her capital budget straight away, and decides she can take the rest of the year off investing.|$|E

50|$|It {{was found}} that the last two mutations, F46T and T52F, {{occurred}} between 45 million and 30 million years ago as the absolute max for short wave length opsins was increasing from 400 to 430.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} and compare the VO 2 <b>max</b> <b>values</b> of college soccer players at the University of New Mexico to data available from other collegiate teams. These values are beneficial for athletes, trainers, and coaches alike. Performance in athletics has improved significantly over the past 20 years as demonstrated by faster times and increased fitness levels. This is due to multiple factors including changes in nutrition, coaching, and equipment. Methods used in this study include a review of the literature specific for collegiate soccer athletes that were published after the year 2000. In addition, data from athletes from men’s and women’s soccer teams at the University of New Mexico are included in our results. VO 2 <b>max</b> <b>values</b> were obtained using a maximal exercise test performed on a treadmill. The compilation of a table from the gathered data on VO 2 <b>max</b> <b>values</b> of collegiate soccer players specific for gender and level of competition will be of significant value for training personnel and athletes involved in soccer and collegiate athletics.

50|$|The basic {{fundamental}} of induction generators is {{the conversion}} between mechanical energy to electrical energy. This requires an external torque {{applied to the}} rotor to turn it faster than the synchronous speed. However, indefinitely increasing torque doesn't lead to an indefinite increase in power generation. The rotating magnetic field torque excited from the armature works to counter {{the motion of the}} rotor and prevent over speed because of induced motion in the opposite direction. As the speed of the motor increases the counter torque reaches a <b>max</b> <b>value</b> of torque (breakdown torque) that it can operate until before the operating conditions become unstable. Ideally, induction generators work best in the stable region between the no-load condition and maximum torque region.|$|E

5000|$|There is {{a variety}} of filter media that can be {{employed}} in depth filter processes the most common being sand. Choice of filter media has effects on filter rate, turbidity and filter surface area. Clean bed head loss (pressure drop) is sensitive to media diameter where increasing media diameter results in a longer time to design head loss. Increasing the media diameter and filter rate however results in degradation of effluent turbidity. To compensate, media depth can be increased to reduce the effects on effluent turbidity. The <b>max</b> <b>value</b> of media depth used in designs so far for high rate filtration is 100 in, whilst the maximum media size used in pilots is 2mm in diameter.

40|$|Background: Exercise is very {{important}} for keeping and increasing healt. Exercise is classified aerobic and anaerobic. Aerobic exercise will affect the cardiorespiratoric more than anaerobic one, because it will enhance the oxygen uptake. Men fitness can be measured by the VO 2 <b>max</b> <b>values.</b> VO 2 <b>max</b> is the maximum amount of oxygen in millilitres, one can use in one minute per kilogram of body weight. Those who are fit have higher VO 2 <b>max</b> <b>values</b> and can exercise more intensely than those who are not as well conditioned. Objectives: To know that how programmed aerobic exercise influence the VO 2 max change in 12 weeks. Method: This way an experimental study using pre and post test control group design. Seventy students were divided in two groups, treatment and control groups. Measurement performed before, on 6 th weeks and after the 12 weeks treatment period for dtetermination of the VO 2 max, both control and group of treatment. Result: There was significant increases of VO 2 max in the treatment group after 12 weeks programmed aerobic exercise. There was not significant increases of VO 2 max in the control group after 12 weeks anaerobic exercise. There was significant difference of VO 2 <b>max</b> <b>values</b> between treatment and control group at 12 th week. Conclusion: Aerobic training for about 12 weeks could increase VO 2 <b>max</b> <b>values.</b> Key words: aerobic exercise, VO 2 max...|$|R
