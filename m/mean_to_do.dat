500|$|The {{game was}} created by {{roommates}} Michael Frederickson—a technical director at Pixar—and Stephen Barlow using HTML5. The two heard Kanye West's song [...] "Niggas in Paris" [...] and became [...] "obsessed" [...] with the lyric [...] "Don't let me into my zone" [...] (which is probably a reference to West's [...] "artistic zone"), and what it would <b>mean</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so. It was inspired by 1980s games such as Pac-Man, {{as well as the}} 1972 game Pong. They noted that although they tried to make the rest of the game [...] "flashy", the zone had to be [...] "this unremarkable geometric form" [...] {{so as not to be}} distracting.|$|E
500|$|Although the State Opening of Parliament {{was planned}} for February 1605, {{concern over the}} plague delayed it until 3October. A {{contemporaneous}} government account has the plotters engaged in digging a tunnel beneath Parliament by December 1604, but no other evidence exists to prove this, and no trace of a tunnel has since been found. If the story is true, the plotters ceased their efforts when the tenancy to the undercroft beneath the House of Lords became available. Several months later, early in June 1605, Catesby met the principal Jesuit in England, Father Henry Garnet, on Thames Street in London. While discussing the war in Flanders, Catesby asked about the morality of [...] "killing innocents". Garnet said that such actions could often be excused, but according to his own account during a second meeting in July he showed Catesby {{a letter from the}} pope which forbade rebellion. Catesby replied, [...] "Whatever I <b>mean</b> <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> if the Pope knew, he would not hinder for the general good of our country." [...] Father Garnet's protestations prompted Catesby's next reply, [...] "I am not bound to take knowledge by you of the Pope's will." [...] Soon after, Father Tesimond told Father Garnet that while taking Catesby's confession he had learned of the plot. Father Garnet met with Catesby a third time on 24July at White Webbs in Enfield Chase, the home of Catesby's wealthy relative Anne Vaux, and a house long suspected by the government of harbouring Jesuit priests. Without acknowledging that he was aware of the precise nature of the plot, the priest tried in vain to dissuade Catesby from his course.|$|E

A jailhouse guard, Jeff Stuart, testified to Judge Ito that at one point Simpson yelled to Grier that he [...] "didn't <b>mean</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> it," [...] after which Grier had urged Simpson to come clean. Ito ruled that the evidence was hearsay and could not be allowed in court.|$|E

2500|$|President Mirza had not envisaged {{any change}} in his {{previous}} powers; he wanted to retain the ability to maneuver things {{in keeping with his}} own whims. Judging from the situation, the things however had changed as the time and situation both were demanding the complete solution. General Ayub Khan came to an understanding that the real political power rested with the support from the military, and within a week of enforcing the martial law, President Mirza realized the delicate position he got himself into. In an interview with Dawn, President Mirza regretted his decision saying: [...] "I did not <b>mean</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> it" [...] while offering assurances that the martial law would be for the shortest possible duration.|$|E
2500|$|In the post-trial proceedings, House's {{attorneys}} presented {{evidence that}} Mr. Muncey, the victim's husband, {{could have been}} the murderer. House's attorneys produced evidence from multiple sources suggesting that Muncey regularly abused his wife. [...] Moreover, two witnesses at House's habeas hearing testified that, around the time of House's trial, Muncey had confessed to the crime. One witness recalled that she and [...] "some family members and some friends [...] sitting around drinking" [...] at her trailer when Muncey [...] "just walked in and sit down." [...] Muncey, who had evidently been drinking heavily, began [...] "rambling off [...] [...] [...] talking about what happened to his wife and how it happened and he didn't <b>mean</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> it." [...] According to the witness, Muncey [...] "said [...] had been into [...] argument and he slapped her and she fell and hit her head and it killed her and he didn't mean for it to happen." [...] The witness then said she [...] "freaked out and run him off." ...|$|E
2500|$|After Michael Fay {{was arrested}} in Singapore and sentenced to a caning, ECW head booker Paul Heyman decided to {{capitalize}} on the publicity by holding a Singapore Cane match between Dreamer and The Sandman – with the loser having to take 10 lashes. After losing the match Dreamer took his lashes, then asked The Sandman for another, causing the crowd to feel sympathy for him as he took the extra, and another. This was a launching point to an angle that ended up blurring the divide between faces and heels in wrestling, as well as start a new way of working the fans, especially the [...] "smarks" [...] – fans with some amount of inside information. In a later match, Dreamer kayfabe accidentally blinded The Sandman, first by knocking a lit cigarette into his eye, then hitting in the other with a Singapore cane. Immediately after, Dreamer seemed to break kayfabe and started aiding The Sandman. He professed that he [...] "didn't <b>mean</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> it" [...] and that it was [...] "an accident" [...] as other wrestlers – face and heel – swarmed out to help. The feud continued with Sandman planning to announce his retirement at an ECW show, only to attack Dreamer and reveal he was never actually blind. The feud ended when Tommy Dreamer defeated the Sandman in a No DQ/No-Holds-Barred match.|$|E

60|$|L. Yes, Isabel; but {{you will}} find that the great {{difference}} is between kind and unkind wrongs, not between meant and unmeant wrong.
