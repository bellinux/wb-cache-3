500|$|... "Get Back" [...] is a upbeat guitar-driven rock song. According to {{the sheet}} music {{published}} at Musicnotes.com by Sony/ATV Music Publishing, {{the song is}} set in common time with a tempo of 120 beats per minute. It is performed in the key of C major and Lovato's vocals span from the note of B3 to the note of G5. Ed Masley of The Arizona Republic compared the song's sound to works by Tommy Tutone. Lyrically, the song is about a desire to get back together with an old boyfriend, demonstrated in the lines [...] "I {{want to get back}} to the old days", and [...] "Kiss <b>me</b> <b>like</b> <b>you</b> mean it".|$|E
500|$|Though {{many critics}} and fans saw Revenge of the Sith as the strongest {{of the three}} prequels, some saw it as more or less on par with The Phantom Menace and Attack of the Clones. Much of the {{criticism}} for the film was directed towards the dialogue, particularly the film's romantic scenes, and for Hayden Christensen's performance (which won him his second Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Supporting Actor). Critics and fans alike were quick to jump on such lines as [...] "Hold me, Ani. Hold <b>me,</b> <b>like</b> <b>you</b> did by the lake on Naboo...where {{there was nothing but}} our love..." [...] Critics have claimed this demonstrated Lucas's weakness as a writer of dialogue, a subject with which Lucas openly agreed when receiving the Lifetime Achievement Award from the American Film Institute.|$|E
500|$|Lo co-wrote [...] "Love <b>Me</b> <b>Like</b> <b>You</b> Do", {{recorded}} by English singer Ellie Goulding, which was released {{as the second}} single from the [...] to the film Fifty Shades of Grey (2015). The track topped the UK Singles Chart and peaked at number three on the Billboard Hot 100. Additionally, Lo received nominations, alongside the others co-writers of the song, for the Golden Globes, Grammys and Critics' Choice Awards. [...] Discussing {{the process of writing}} for other artists, the singer told Paste that she avoids drawing from her own experiences so that the songs do not become personal. She also stated: [...] "My main goal is to say something how they would say it, even if I might say it in a different way that makes more sense to me".|$|E

Let the blood of life, which flows from thee, procure me pardon for the past; let the water of life, which flows from thee, give me strength for the future. I come to cast away my own life, my life of self and selfishness, which is corrupt according to the deceitful lusts, that I may live it no more; and to receive thy life, which is created after the likeness of God, in righteousness and true holiness, that I may live it for ever and ever, and find it a well of life springing up in me to everlasting life.

500|$|The song {{opens with}} the group harmonising [...] "Sha la la la" [...] over pianos. The lyrics are about puppy love, as they yearningly sing [...] "Last night I lay in bed so blue / Cause' I {{realized}} the truth/ They can't love <b>me</b> <b>like</b> <b>you</b> / I tried to find somebody new / Baby they ain't got a clue/ Can't love me like you." [...] Fuse writer Jeff Benjamin described the song as being reminiscent of 1960s girl group The Ronettes but with a more modern feel for 2015 radio, highlighting the line [...] "They try to romance me but you got that nasty and that's what I want" [...] as an example. Digital Spy writer Lewis Corner thought that the line [...] "He might got the biggest ca-aa-ar" [...] does not fool listeners into thinking that [...] "they're not actually talking about his Fiat 500." [...] Several music critics compared the song to recordings from the Motown era in the 1950s and 1960s, with Andy Gill of The Independent likening it to material composed by Shadow Morton. Emilee Lindner of MTV News likened the production to material composed by Phil Spector. The Christmas mix version features added church bells and jingles.|$|E
500|$|The group {{announced}} on 9 September 2015 that [...] "Love Me Like You" [...] {{would be the}} second single {{to be released from}} the album, {{and that it would be}} made available to pre-order on 11 September, and be released on 25 September. It was released by Syco and Columbia in Ireland and the United Kingdom on 25 September 2015. The single's artwork was released on the same day. In their review, MTV News joked that the group were suggesting that it would be number-one due to each of the band members eyeline, writing [...] "We can't help but get the hint they're on the hunt for ANOTHER chart topping trophy. Leigh-Anne clearly thinks she can see it in the distance, Jesy is just imagining it with her brain, Jade definitely thinks she can hear the noise of records being sold and Perrie is convinced it's on the floor." [...] M magazine writer Heather Thompson described the artwork as [...] "vibrant". A collection of alternate versions called [...] "Love <b>Me</b> <b>Like</b> <b>You</b> (The Collection)" [...] was also released in Australia and New Zealand in addition to Ireland and the United Kingdom on 16 October 2015. It consists of a Christmas mix, several remixes and an instrumental version of [...] "Love Me Like You" [...] and another album track called [...] "Lightning".|$|E
500|$|After {{signing with}} Columbia, many music critics {{considered}} that Smith {{lost much of}} the quality that was found in her earlier records with RCA Victor. When reviewing her compilation from her years at Columbia titled Connie Smith Sings Her Hits (1997), Thom Jurek of Allmusic commented that Smith lost much of the [...] "grain" [...] in her voice. Jurek went on to write, [...] "It could be said, that regardless of the material, she never made a bad record; the tunes were carefully chosen it's true, but she never tried to hide the hardcore twang in her vocal style." [...] In 1974 Smith released the singles [...] "I Never Knew (What That Song Meant Before)" [...] and [...] "I've Got My Baby on My Mind", which both reached No.13 on the Billboard Magazine Hot Country Singles chart. In 1975, she released her second gospel album with the label, entitled Connie Smith Sings Hank Williams Gospel, which was {{a tribute to the}} gospel material that Hank Williams recorded. That year, she also released a cover of Williams' secular [...] "Why Don't You Love <b>Me</b> (<b>Like</b> <b>You</b> Used to Do)" [...] as a single. In 1976, Smith released two cover versions of previously-made pop hits by The Everly Brothers as singles: [...] "(Till) I Kissed You" [...] and [...] "So Sad (To Watch Good Love Go Bad)". After releasing two more studio albums in 1976, Smith parted ways with Columbia Records the following year.|$|E

2500|$|On {{returning}} to the United States in 1919, Austin settled in Baltimore, Maryland, where he intended to study dentistry. Soon, however, he was playing piano and singing in local taverns. He started writing songs and formed a vaudeville act with Roy Bergere, with whom he wrote [...] "How Come You Do <b>Me</b> <b>Like</b> <b>You</b> Do." [...] The act ended when Bergere married.

2500|$|... "I Want You" [...] is {{a classic}} pop ballad {{influenced}} by Motown music of the nineteen-fifties and seventies. The song's instrumentation includes a chime-studded texture, violins, heavy drums, and a girl-group arrangement over production described as an [...] "electronic reconstruction." [...] The [...] "retro" [...] song was likened {{to the music of}} Karen Carpenter, and has a [...] "swooning charm." [...] Eleventh track [...] "R Junkie" [...] has a [...] "retro" [...] feel consisting of eighties funk, dance-pop, and upbeat synths. It transforms a brief sample from Evelyn King into a new composition, considered a likely candidate for a summer club hit. The song's positive vibe was described as a sonic [...] "ambrosia." [...] "Like You Don't Love Me" [...] blends guitars and heavy bass with youthful vocals and a repeated chorus littered throughout. The lyrics talk about feeling neglected sexually, with Jackson encouraging her partner to role play as if they were not in a monogomous relationship: [...] "You need to make love to me/Like you don't love me [...] Do <b>me</b> <b>like</b> <b>you</b> wanna do them other girls." [...] The song ends with a spoken reprise of the album's title track's chorus.|$|E
