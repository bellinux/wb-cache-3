The Beginning {{was released on}} June 24, 1987, and featured <b>material</b> <b>from</b> the band's 1982 self-titled EP, as well as rare live and studio recordings. On May 12, 1992, Return of the Vampire was released, which was another compilation of rare studio recordings. On October 6, 1992, Roadrunner released A Dangerous Meeting; a split-release featuring <b>material</b> <b>from</b> both Mercyful Fate and King Diamond.|$|E

50|$|The Asuka Historical Museum {{primarily}} preserves {{and exhibits}} <b>materials</b> <b>from</b> the 6th to 8th centuries, specifically from the Asuka period (538-710) of Japanese history.

Unlike other regional museums which house well-known <b>materials</b> <b>from</b> the early periods of Japanese history, Asuka Historical Museum exhibits <b>materials</b> <b>from</b> recent, local excavations. The Asuka Historical Museum is {{a repository of}} materials excavated by the Department of Imperial Palace Sites Investigations of the Nara National Research Institute for Cultural Properties. Its collections center on <b>materials</b> <b>from</b> the Asuka, Fujiwara, and Heijō palaces.|$|R

5|$|A 2007 study {{suggested}} that Massospondylus {{may have used}} its short arms for defense against predators ("defensive swats"), in intraspecies combat, or in feeding, although its arms were too short to reach its mouth.

50|$|A total 83 {{artifacts}} or prismatic knives were found, {{of which}} 50 {{seem to have}} been manufactured with raw <b>materials</b> <b>from</b> Ixtepeque Guatemala. 26 artifacts or fragments were identified as likely to have been manufactured with raw <b>materials</b> <b>from</b> the Chayal, El Salvador. 6 of the objects were possible manufactured with raw <b>materials</b> <b>from</b> the Guinope, Honduras. And one artifact is of undetermined origin. From the lithic waste (chips) 31 fragments were recorded of which 11 appear to be from Ixtepeque, Guatemala; 8 chips might come from the Chayal, El Salvador, and 12 chips seem to be raw <b>material</b> brought <b>from</b> Guinope, Honduras.|$|R
5|$|A thread common {{throughout}} {{these early}} works is Monteverdi's {{use of the}} technique of imitatio, a general practice among composers of the period whereby <b>material</b> <b>from</b> earlier or contemporary composers was used as models for their own work. Monteverdi continued to use this procedure well beyond his apprentice years, a factor that in some critics' eyes has compromised his reputation for originality.|$|E
5|$|A {{white dwarf}} star may {{accumulate}} sufficient <b>material</b> <b>from</b> a stellar companion to raise its core temperature enough to ignite carbon fusion, at which point it undergoes runaway nuclear fusion, completely disrupting it. There are three avenues by which this detonation is theorized to happen: stable accretion of <b>material</b> <b>from</b> a companion, the collision of two white dwarfs, or accretion that causes ignition in a shell that then ignites. The dominant mechanism by which Type Ia supernovae are produced remains unclear. Despite this uncertainty in how Type Ia supernovae are produced, Type Ia supernovae have very uniform properties, and are useful standard candles over intergalactic distances. Some calibrations are required {{to compensate for the}} gradual change in properties or different frequencies of abnormal luminosity supernovae at high red shift, and for small variations in brightness identified by light curve shape or spectrum.|$|E
