The sensor is capable of detecting the <b>melt</b> <b>front</b> at predefined locations inside the mould. The sensor com-prises a movable pin which acts as the sensor element generating structure-borne sound triggered by the passing <b>melt</b> <b>front.</b> Due to the sensor design, melt pressure is the driving force. For pressure level measurement during pin movement a pressure transducer located at {{the same position as}} the movable pin. By deriving a mathematical model for the mechanical movement, dominant process parameters could be investigated towards their impact on the <b>melt</b> <b>front</b> detection characteristic. It was found that the sensor is not affected by the investigated parameters enabling it for reliable <b>melt</b> <b>front</b> detection. In addition, it could be proved that the novel sensor is in comparable range to conventional <b>melt</b> <b>front</b> detection sensors...|$|E

A method of profiling the injection velocity for such a uniform mold filling is presented in this paper. Based on a neural network model developed for estimating the melt flow length from online measurable variables, the profiling problem is transformed into an optimization to minimize {{the difference between the}} predicted melt flow length and a given ramp. The rate of the ramp determines the rate of the <b>melt</b> <b>front</b> velocity traveling in the cavity during filling.

40|$|Abstract. The {{precision}} {{control of}} the injection process in micro injection molding demands precise tracking of the moment that <b>melt</b> <b>front</b> passes through the nozzle so that accurate prediction {{of the amount of}} melt being injected into the mould can be achieved. The tracking accuracy, to large extent, depends on the processing of pressure signals followed by the identification of the critical moment that <b>melt</b> <b>front</b> reaches the nozzle. A new adaptive Kalman filter was introduced in this study to calculate and predict the amount of melt injected. The filter eliminated the delay error and was more robust than other filters. The adaptive Kalman filter switches between two Qs for steady-state and transient estimations, allowing resetting of the Kalman gain so that convergence is speeded up in calculations. Experimental and simulation results prove the effectiveness of the method proposed...|$|E

In {{the present study}} a mathematical modeling of CO 2 laser cutting process is introduced and numerical solution of the heat transfer equation is obtained. The <b>melting</b> <b>front</b> velocities at different laser output power and workpiece thicknesses are predicted. The temporal development of the <b>melting</b> <b>front</b> profile is computed. The study is extended to include the experimental study of the transient behavior of the vapor ejected from the kerf in the initial stage of the cutting process. To achieve this two methods namely He-Ne laser transmittance and fiber-optic methods are introduced.

40|$|Experiments {{were carried}} out in an {{environmental}} chamber with the aim to monitor the <b>melting</b> <b>front</b> propagation in a rectangular cavity filled with a paraffin-based Phase Change Material (PCM). The PCM was contained in transparent containers with the heat flux introduced {{by means of an}} electric heating element. The stabilized power source was used to maintain the constant heat output of the heating elements. The experiments were performed for the heat flux introduced at the side wall of the container and at the upper surface of the PCM. The paraffin-based PCM RT 28 HC with the phase change temperature of 28 °C was used in the experiments. The temperature in the environmental chamber was maintained at the melting temperature of the PCM. The propagation of the <b>melting</b> <b>front</b> was monitored with a digital camera and temperatures at several locations were monitored with RTDs and thermocouples. Significant natural convection was observed for the heat flux introduced at the side wall of the container. As a result the <b>melting</b> <b>front</b> propagated much faster {{at the top of the}} container than at its bottom. The heat flux introduced at the upper-surface of the PCM resulted in almost one-dimensional propagation of the <b>melting</b> <b>front.</b> The acquired data are to be used for validation of an in-house developed numerical model based on the front-tracking method...|$|R

Dynamic meshing was used for evolving the flow domain in time as the <b>melting</b> <b>front</b> extended radially outward from the cylinder; a node shuffle algorithm was used to retain mesh quality across the significant mesh deformation. We simulated one case above the density inversion point of water and one case below, yielding pear-shaped <b>melting</b> <b>fronts</b> due to thermal plumes either rising or falling from the cylinder, respectively. Results were compared with previous experimental studies and the <b>melting</b> <b>front</b> profiles matched reasonably well and melting rates were in agreement.

The single parameter method was used to discuss the flatness and replication properties for different processing parameters (mold temperature, melt temperature, packing pressure, packing time and injection pressure). The results show that there are <b>melt</b> <b>front</b> delays due to the slow injection velocity, the low temperature induced by the little effect of shear heating, the high viscosity, the large flow resistance and the slow flow velocity. The mold temperature is the most important factor for the flatness and the replication of micro-feature of liughtguiding plate. Lower mold temperature induces better flatness properties.

Also, a molding experiment was conducted and the results of the experiment showed a good agreement with the simulation results for flow pattern and weld line location. On the other hand, gravity and inertia effects have an influence on the velocity of the <b>melt</b> <b>front</b> because of the high density of ceramic powder particles during powder injection molding in comparison with polymer’s injection molding process.

Very good agreement was obtained between the predictions and the experiment for Stefan numbers of up to 0. 1807.

However, the gap phenomena are critical to produce optimal surface integrity for superior performance of EDMed components. Nevertheless, the highly nonlinear transient dynamic process involving time/space-dependent plasma and heat flux has not been well understood. This work presents a multiscale finite element modeling for single discharging of ASP 2023 tool steel to incorporate the plasma-induced time/space-dependent Gaussian heat flux via a user subroutine. The long-standing numerical singularity of heat flux in EDM modeling is solved using the innovative functions of discharge current. The effects of discharge duration and current on temperature profiles, crater formation, and dimensions are investigated. The basic mechanisms of superheating and melting can be successfully predicted.

40|$|We discuss melting of alloys along grain {{boundaries}} {{as a free}} boundary problem for two moving solid-liquid interfaces. One {{of them is the}} <b>melting</b> <b>front</b> and the other is the solidification front. The presence of the triple junction {{plays an important role in}} controlling the velocity of this process. The interfaces interact strongly via the diffusion field in the thin liquid layer between them. In the liquid film migration (LFM) mechanism the system chooses a more efficient kinetic path, which is controlled by diffusion in the liquid film over relatively short distances. However, only weak coherency strain energy is the effective driving force for LFM in the case of melting of one-phase alloys. The process with only one <b>melting</b> <b>front</b> would be controlled by the very slow diffusion in the mother solid phase over relatively large distances. (C) 2008 Acta Materialia Inc.

40|$|In a {{long series}} of larger {{spreading}} tests with high temperature oxide melts (KATS tests) many parameters have been varied which are influencing the spreading behaviour (viscosity, pouring rate, substratum of spreading surface, presence of water). In spite of an extensive instrumentation using different thermocouples, an infrared camera and several video cameras, only in very few cases the behaviour of the <b>melt</b> <b>front</b> at the very moment of immobilization could be detected in detail. Therefore in the additional miniKATS series five small scale (5 kg) spreading tests with oxide melts have been conducted to investigate the mechanical properties of the spreading front in the moment of immobilization. It turned out that in all cases the bulk of the melt at this moment was still liquid at a temperature close to the initial one. Depending on the initial melt properties two distinct phenomena have been observed which control the immobilization of the melt: the first phenomena is the crust formation at the surface, the crusts at the bottom combined with the crust at the surface of the melt. In the other case the whole <b>melt</b> <b>front</b> was still above the liquid temperature at the moment of immobilization. Here the surface tension was controlling the spreading, it was in balance with the driving gravitational force. In none of the test bulk freezing has been detected. (orig.)

Some pores can float and escape from the solidifying <b>melt</b> <b>front</b> at a relatively high velocity. At the end of solidification, the remaining pores maintain spherical morphology in the near eutectic alloy but become irregular in the hypoeutectic alloy.

40|$|The {{mechanism}} of porosity formation during the fusion welding of titanium and its alloys is studied. Porosity formed during the electron beam welding of titanium is characterized using high-resolution X-ray tomography, residual gas analysis and metallographic sectioning; the results confirm that porosity formation {{is associated with}} evolution of gas, especially hydrogen. A model for hydrogen diffusion-controlled bubble growth is proposed, {{to aid in the}} interpretation of these findings. To investigate further the effect of hydrogen on porosity formation, hydrogen charging is used to achieve different hydrogen levels prior to welding. The results confirm that porosity can be suppressed even at every high hydrogen levels, when welding is carried out with optimized welding parameters and perfect joint alignment; on the other hand, porosity is exacerbated when a small beam offset is employed. This is because any beam offset alters the size of the liquid zone at the <b>melting</b> <b>front,</b> where the joint edges first become melted. It is proposed that the thickness of the liquid film at the <b>melting</b> <b>front</b> is crucial for bubble nucleation and bubble survival in the weld pool; bubbles can escape through the keyhole by breaking through this liquid film, when it is too thin. This challenges the common assumption of bubble escape by flotation to the weld pool surface. Thus the nucleation rate in the liquid zone at the <b>melting</b> <b>front</b> determines the likelihood of porosity occurring. This suggests that the beam offset is likely to be one factor influencing porosity formation in these circumstances. The paper provides fundamental insights into the {{mechanism of}} porosity formation during the welding of titanium alloys and guidance to aid in its elimination. © 2011 Acta Materialia Inc.

40|$|Numerical {{simulations}} {{are performed}} {{in order to}} examine the time-dependent melting, and heavily deforming processes of phase change material (PCM) subjected to local heating. By comparing cases with and without deformation, the impact of the inclusion of a deformation model is firstly addressed to understand what influences the precise melting behavior. Mass, momentum and energy conservation equations are solved in a 2 -D system based on a fixed grid by means of a finite volume method. The Volume of Fluid (VOF) method and the Enthalpy-Porosity method are applied to model the deformable liquid-gas interface and the melting processes, respectively. Results successfully show the melting, subsequent deformation and dropping-off behavior of the molten PCM. It is found that the inclusion of the deformation model enhances the melting owing to the increase of the total received heat; namely, widening of the contact area at the <b>melting</b> <b>front</b> and induced flow motion inside molten PCM improve the heat transfer toward the <b>melting</b> <b>front.</b> Parametric studies by varying the applied Stefan number so as to change the surface tension are also made to ensure the above-mentioned enhancement mechanism is universally applicable.

This paper considers the gross melting of fuel plates and rods and seeks to estimate the extent of melting and the rapidity with which it occurs. Methods of analysis are presented in detail in the present exploratory study. For short times after the onset of melting, an analytical series solution is constructed by the ‘embedding technique’. The effect of the change in density which accompaies the change in phase is examined, and is found to be relatively unimportant as far as the <b>melting</b> <b>front</b> position is concerned. An exact steady-state solution is found, which makes possible a prediction of the maximum extent of melting in cases in which steady state can be expected. The actual progress of melting for all times is more difficult to calculate, and an approximate solution is therefore introduced.
