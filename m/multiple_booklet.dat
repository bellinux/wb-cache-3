5|$|From 1906 the CLR {{began to}} {{experience}} a large fall in passenger numbers caused by increased competition from the DR and the MR, which electrified the Inner Circle in 1905, and from the Great Northern, Piccadilly and Brompton Railway (GNP) which opened its rival route to Hammersmith in 1906. Road traffic also offered a greater challenge as motor buses began replacing the horse drawn variety in greater numbers. In an attempt to maintain income, the company increased the flat fare for longer journeys to three pence in July 1907 and reduced the fare for shorter journeys to one penny in March 1909. <b>Multiple</b> <b>booklets</b> of tickets, which had previously been sold at face value, were offered at discounts, and season tickets were introduced from July 1911.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} use of a {{specific}} case of the Linear Logistic Test Model, known as the rating scale rater model, in which the item parameter is conceptualized to include an item difficulty parameter, plus a rating severity parameter. Using this model, the severity of groups of teachers is investigated when they scored sets of 321 pretests and posttests designed to be congruent with an embedded assessment system. The items were included in a linked design involving <b>multiple</b> <b>booklets</b> randomly allocated to students. Individual teachers were found to differ in overall severity, but also showed a reasonable amount of consistency within two of the three district moderation groups. Teachers also showed some mean differences between districts. There is also evidence that the model may be too tightly constrained, and further exploration using a less constrained model is indicated...|$|R
50|$|When playing Star Saga, {{each player}} {{physically}} plots {{his or her}} moves on the map, then enters these movements and other desired actions into the Star Saga computer program. In response to the entered commands, the program determines the results, updates the character's statistics and inventory, and directs the player to read one or more text passages from the accompanying booklets. Upon reading the section(s), the player discovers {{the consequences of his}} or her actions, as well as any new information which has been gleaned. In some cases, the actual results of a turn will be quite different from those planned, due to events such as interception by hostile forces. Although the large amount of reading slows gameplay, the text is broken out into <b>multiple</b> <b>booklets</b> so that players can (usually) be simultaneously reading from separate sources. Over a number of turns, each player slowly progresses through the game, discovering what lies at each unlabeled planet on the map and otherwise uncovering the mysteries of the galaxy.|$|R
5000|$|Hertz {{initially}} {{set out to}} make a zine {{of about}} 50 pages but was flooded with almost 300 pages of original content from approximately sixty people. It consisted of academic papers, detailed technical projects, interviews and documented pieces of artwork. He then categorised the information into specific topics thereby producing <b>multiple</b> <b>booklets.</b> The booklet itself is a testament to critical making. It was printed using a hacked photocopier and roughly 100,000 pages were manually folded and stapled to create 300 copies of 10 booklets each. The publication asks us to look at aspects of the DIY culture that go beyond buying an Arduino, getting a MakerBot and reducing DIY to a weekend hobby. These books embrace social issues, the history of technology, activism and politics. The project also stems from a specific disappointment. Recently, Make received a grant from DARPA to create [...] "makerspaces" [...] for teenagers. Everyone who had assumed that a culture built on openness was antithetical to the murkiness that surrounds the military world was bitterly disheartened. However, CM is not the anti-Make Magazine, it is simply an alternative, a forum for electronic DIY practice to discuss hacking, making, kludging, DIYing in a less sanitized, mass-market way.|$|R
40|$|Differential item {{functioning}} (DIF) {{analysis is}} an important step in the data analysis of large-scale testing programs. Nowadays, many such programs endorse matrix sampling designs to reduce the load on examinees, such as the balanced incomplete block (BIB) design. These designs pose challenges to the traditional DIF analysis methods. For example, as difficulty levels often vary across booklets, examinees with same booklet scores may be disparate in ability. Consequently, DIF procedures based on matching total scores at the booklet level may cause misplacement of examinees and inflation in measurement errors. Therefore, modification to traditional DIF pro-cedures to better accommodate the BIB design becomes important. This article introduces modification of current simultaneous item bias test (SIBTEST) procedure for the DIF analysis method when <b>multiple</b> <b>booklets</b> are used. More specifically, examinees will be pooled across booklets, and the matching will be based on transformed booklet scores after common block equating/linking. Simulations are conducted to compare the performance of this new method, the equated pooled booklet method against that of the current pooled booklet method, in terms of both Type I error control and power. Four factors are considered in the simulation—the DIF effect size, item difficulty, impact, and the length of common block. Results show that the equa-ted pooled booklet method in general improves power while keeping Type I error under control. The advantage of the new method is the most pronounced when the traditional method strug-gles, for example, when the item is difficult or there is impact...|$|R

Some of these titles were given numbered limited edition releases which included <b>multiple</b> discs, information <b>booklets,</b> and collectible tin cases. Many of these releases went out of print and became sought-after collectibles.|$|R
30|$|Researchers {{exploring}} PISA, NAEP, and TIMSS {{data have}} used the multilevel item response theory approach to examine the relationships between {{a small number of}} latent proficiency variables, for example, three to seven such variables in the case of PISA, and quite a large number of other variables collected via respondent contextual questionnaires. To ensure adequate content coverage of the latent proficiency variables, PISA, NAEP, and TIMSS all use <b>multiple</b> linked test <b>booklets,</b> which means that although each respondent responds to just 60 (NAEP) to 120 (PISA) minutes of assessment material, the total sum of assessment material used far exceeds this amount.|$|R

40|$|Intended for {{teachers}} of students with severe <b>multiple</b> impairments, the <b>booklet</b> examines the role of physical activities in the education of this population and suggests approaches to exhancing their motor development. Suggestions are offered for stimulating movement in preschool, elementary, and secondary immobile children, including tactile stimulation, passive range of motion exercises, moving the child through or over obstacles, and parachute play. sAmong motivational techniques considered are modeling the activities, providing visually stimulating equipment or tasks, emphasizing repetitions,, and using age-appropriate activities/equipment. Specific suggestions are outlined for preschoolers (such as using a multisensory approach), elementary students (including providing imitative activities), and secondary students (such as working. with balloons and rubber bands). Individualized education program 'pais in the physical domain are discussed, and ways to teach specific motor skills to preschool, elementary, and secondary students are reviewed. The importance of selecting individually appropriate activities in developing the student's'functioning is emphasized. (CL) * Reproductions supplied by EDRS are the best that can be-made...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the usage of three selected readability indices and the Cloze Procedure to assess the understandability of narrative disclosures in financial reports. Specifically, the dissertation study was conducted to (1) determine validity of Cloze Procedure tests as measures of narrative disclosure communication; (2) clarify the relationship among Dale Chall Readability Formula, Flesch Reading Ease Index, Gunning 2 ̆ 7 s Fog Index, and the Cloze Procedure when used in conjunction with financial narrative disclosures; and, (3) examine the effect of user groups and narrative disclosures on the ability of the Cloze Procedure to discriminate understandability. ^ Six financial narrative disclosures were used to develop Cloze Procedure tests and multiple choice questions designed to measure comprehension. Three Cloze Procedure tests were combined as Cloze Procedure test booklets. Three narrative disclosures and sets of five multiple choice questions were combined as <b>multiple</b> choice test <b>booklets.</b> Twenty-six chartered financial analysts and forty-seven financial accountants completed both type of test booklets. ^ Readability index scores were computed for each of the six financial narrative disclosures using the Dale Chall Readability Formula, Flesch Reading Ease Index, and Gunning 2 ̆ 7 s Fog Index. ^ The results from correlation analysis and analysis of variance, regression method (1) did not support the Cloze Procedure as a valid measure of narrative disclosure communication; (2) did not support significant relationships among the four readability techniques; and, (3) supported Cloze Procedure scores as being sensitive to type of narrative disclosure, but found no support for sensitivity of user groups. ^ The conclusions from the study are as follows: (1) The usage of Cloze Procedure to measure understandability of narrative disclosures in financial accounting is questionable. (2) It makes little difference which readability technique is used to evaluate the understandability of narrative disclosures in financial reports. (3) The Cloze Procedure tests are efficient measures to discriminate between type of narrative disclosures but are not for user groups. ...|$|R
