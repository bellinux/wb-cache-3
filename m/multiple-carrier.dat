This includes a range of alternatives to cells made of semiconducting p-n junctions ("first generation") and thin film cells ("second generation"). Common third-generation systems include multi-layer ("tandem") cells made of amorphous silicon or gallium arsenide, while more theoretical developments include frequency conversion, (i.e. changing the frequencies of light that the cell cannot use to light frequencies that the cell can use - thus producing more power), hot-carrier effects and other <b>multiple-carrier</b> ejection techniques.|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{comprises}} two parts. The {{first part}} deals with single carrier and <b>multiple-carrier</b> based frequency estimation. The second part {{is concerned with}} the application of ultrasound using the proposed estimators and introduces a novel efficient implementation of a subspace tracking technique. In the first part, the problem of single frequency estimation is initially examined, and a hybrid single tone estimator is proposed, comprising both coarse and refined estimates. The coarse estimate of the unknown frequency is obtained using the unweighted linear prediction method, and is used to remove the frequency dependence of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) threshold. The SNR threshold is then further reduced via a combination of using an aver aging filter and an outlier removal scheme. Finally, a refined frequency estimate is formed using a weighted phase average technique. The hybrid estimator outperforms other recently developed estimators and is found to be independent of the underlying frequency. A second topic considered {{in the first part of}} this thesis is <b>multiple-carrier</b> based frequency estimation. Based on this idea, three novel velocity estimators are proposed by exploiting the velocity dependence of the backscattered carriers using synthetic data, all three proposed estimators are found to exhibit the capability of mitigating the poor high velocity performance of the conventional correlation based techniques and thereby provide usable performance beyond the conventional Nyquist velocity limit. To evaluate these methods statistically, the Cramer-Rao lower bound for the velocity estimation is derived. In the second part, the fundamentals of ultrasound are briefly reviewed. An efficient subspace tracking technique is introduced as a way to implement clutter eigenfilters, greatly reducing the computation complexity as compared to conventional eigenfilters which are based on the evaluation of the block singular value decomposition technique. Finally, the hybrid estimator and the <b>multiple-carrier</b> based velocity estimators proposed in the first part of the thesis are examined with realistic radio frequency data, illustrating the usefulness of these methods in solving practical problems...|$|E

Although {{solutions to the problem}} of maintaining a stable neutral-point voltage in the converter continue to be the topic of research, a simple solu-tion based on a design-oriented dynamic model of the system is not widely known. This paper presents the design, analysis, and implementation of a simple neutral-point voltage regulator for a three-level diode-clamped multilevel inverter, which uses a <b>multiple-carrier</b> sine-triangle modulator in conjunction with a closed-loop controller for neutral-point regulation. Redundant state choices are controlled via a continuous offset voltage that regulates the dc injection into the midpoint of the dc bus. A small-signal transfer function is developed in closed form, for neutral-point regulation, with the voltage offset as the control vari-able. Besides maintaining dc-bus voltage balance, the use of the approach leads to a significant reduction in the voltage distortion at the neutral point, allowing a definitive reduction in the required dc bus capacitance.

40|$|Several {{high-speed}} communication standards modulate encoded data on <b>multiple-carrier</b> frequencies {{using the}} fast Fourier transform (FFT). The real {{part of the}} quantized inverse FFT samples form a symbol. The symbol is periodically extended by prepending a copy of its last few samples, {{also known as a}} cyclic prefix. When the cyclic prefix is longer than the channel order, amplitude and phase distortion can be equalized entirely in the frequency domain. In the receiver, prior to the FFT, a time-domain equalizer, {{in the form of a}} finite-impulse response filter, shortens the effective channel impulse response. Alternately, a bank of equalizers tuned to each carrier frequency can be used. In earlier literature, we unified optimal multicarrier equalizer design algorithms as a product of generalized Rayleigh quotients. In this paper, we convert the unified theoretical framework into a framework for fast design algorithms. The relevant literature is reviewed and classified according to this framework. We analyze the achieved bit rate versus implementation complexity (in terms of multiply-and-accumulate operations) tradeoffs in the original and fast design algorithms.

In this paper, we study {{the impact of the}} asymmetry on the performance of channel estimation and precoding in downlink BS cooperative multiple-antenna <b>multiple-carrier</b> systems. We first present three linear estimators which jointly estimate the channel coefficients from users in different cells with minimum mean square error, robust design and least square criterion, and then study the impact of uplink channel asymmetry on their performance. It is shown that when the large scale channel information is exploited for channel estimation, using non-orthogonal training sequences among users in different cells leads to minor performance loss. Next, we analyze the impact of downlink channel asymmetry on the performance of precoding with channel estimation errors. Our analysis shows that although the estimation errors of weak cross links are large, the resulting rate loss is minor because their contributions are weighted by the receive signal to noise ratio. The simulation results verify our analysis and show that the rate loss per user is almost constant no matter where the user is located, when the channel estimators exploiting the large scale fading gains.

40|$|On-board {{joint power}} {{amplification}} of <b>multiple-carrier</b> DVB-S 2 signals using a single High-Power Amplifier (HPA) is an emerging configuration {{that aims to}} reduce flight hardware and weight. However, effects specific to such a scenario degrade power and spectral efficiencies with increased Adjacent Channel Interference caused by non-linear characteristic of the HPA and power efficiency loss due to the increased Peak to Average Power Ratio (PAPR). The paper studies signal processing techniques that counteract for both aspects enabling efficient multicarrier on board amplification. Digital pre-distortion (DPD) at the gateway and equalization (EQ) at the User Terminal are the designed avenues of attack to mitigate the non-linear effects and improve power as well as spectral efficiencies. This paper builds on our initial work in Ref. 1 that performed a survey on the adaptability of various compensation techniques to the considered scenario and short-listed the most favourable ones.

40|$|BackgroundNonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs) {{catalyze}} {{the assembly}} of a structurally diverse group of peptides by the <b>multiple-carrier</b> thiotemplate mechanism. All NRPSs known to date are exclusively type I modular enzymes that consist of domains, such as adenylation (A), peptidyl carrier protein (PCP) and condensation (C) domains, for individual enzyme activities. Although several A and PCP domains have been demonstrated to function independently, aminoacylation in trans has been successful only between PCPs and their cognate A domains. ResultsWe have identified within the bleomycin-biosynthesis gene cluster from Streptomyces verticillus ATCC 15003 the blml gene that encodes a discrete PCP protein. We overexpressed the blml gene in Escherichia coli, purified the Blml protein, and demonstrated that apo-Blml can be efficiently modified into holo-Blml either in vivo or in vitro by PCP-specific 4 ′-phosphopantetheine transferases (PPTases). Unlike the PCP domains in type I NRPSs, Blml lacks its cognate A domain and can be aminoacylated by Val-A, an A domain from a completely unrelated type I NRPS. ConclusionsBlml represents the first characterized type II PCP. The Blml type II PCP, like the PCP domains of type I NRPSs, can be 4 ′-phosphopantetheinylated by PCP-specific PPTases but is biochemically distinct in {{that it can be}} aminoacylated by an A domain from a completely unrelated type I NRPS.

40|$|Frequency Modulation (FM) {{and other}} audio rate {{non-linear}} modulation techniques like Waveshaping Digital Synthesis, Amplitude Modulation (AM) and their variants are wellknown techniques for generating complex sound spectra. Kleimola [1] provides a comprehensive and up-to-date {{description of the}} entire family. One shared trait is that synthesizing vocal sounds and other harmonically-structured sounds comprised of formants can be problematic because of an obstacle which causes distortions when intensifying time-varying controls. Large deflections of pitch or phoneme parameters cause jumps in the required integer approximations of formant center frequencies. Trying to imitate human vocal behavior with its often wide prosodic and expressive excursions causes audible clicks. A partial solution lay buried in some code from the 80 ’s. This, combined with a phase-syncronous oscillator bank described in Lazzarini and Timoney [2] produces uniform harmonic components which ensure artifact-free, exact formant spectra even under the most extreme dynamic conditions. The paper revisits singing and speech synthesis using the classic FM single modulator / <b>multiple-carrier</b> structure pioneered by Chowning [3]. The revised method is implemented in Faust and is as efficient as its predecessor technique. Dynamic controls arrive multiplexed via an audio rate “articulation stream ” which interfaces conveniently with sample-synchronous algorithms written in Chuck. FM for singing synthesis can now be “abused ” with radical time-varying controls. It also has potential as an efficient means for low-bandwidth analysis – resynthesis speech coding.

30|$|Much of {{the recent}} effort to develop {{photovoltaics}} (PV) has focused on third-generation PV. The third-generation PV is defined by cost and power conversion efficiency (PCE) greater than the Shockley-Queisser limit of 32 % [1]. It can be reached through device architecture innovations, <b>multiple-carrier</b> generation using impact ionization, and new materials. Colloidal quantum dots (CQDs) have been proposed as useful materials for third-generation PV because {{of their ability to}} generate multiple excitons. Also, by changing the physical dimensions of CQDs, band gaps can be tuned from the visible to the infrared region using low-cost solution-processed fabrication. CQD PV has been studied in various ways using the following: Schottky CQD solar cells [2], depleted heterojunction CQD solar cells [3], and CQD-sensitized solar cells [4]. The highest PCE of CQD-based PV, 6 %, has been achieved with depleted heterojunction CQD solar cells [5]; this PCE makes CQDs competitive with organic materials for the PV industry. CQD-based PV has lower cost per area and benefits from greater process flexibility compared with Si-based PV. However, some issues must still be overcome for PV applications. They are especially sensitive to humidity, light, and oxygen [6, 7]. This sensitivity is the main cause of inferior charge transport, demanding a new strategy to solve these issues. Concurrent use of CQDs and organic compounds in devices has been one approach; these materials have typically been blended together [8 – 10]. To date, though, the PCE of a bilayer-based PV device has been much lower than that of blend-based PV because of poor morphology at the bilayer interface. In one example of a bilayer approach, Spoerke et al. reported that bilayer-based PV made with CdS CQDs and poly(3 -hexylthiophene) (P 3 HT) had a PCE of 0.11 % under simulated air mass (AM) 1.5 conditions [11].|$|E
40|$|The thesis {{studies the}} {{shipping}} contract {{and the process}} of execution aiming at enhancing shipper-carrier cooperation and communication in the shipping process. Free cancellation of shipment booking causes conflict in interests of carrier and shipper and prevents optimization techniques from being used. Therefore, a new contract form with a discount term is proposed to benefit both shipper and carrier. The discounted freight rate is offered only for early confirmed booking which requires zero cancellation. The discount allows the shipper to reduce shipping cost and get a higher service level, while the use of confirmed booking helps carrier to stabilize demand and enables better revenue management and operation planning. Two stochastic models are developed to study shipper’s behavior with single carrier. The first model minimizes shippers shipping cost with the optimal confirmed booking volume being calculated from the distribution of show-up volume. An algorithm is developed to find the distribution, followed by the proof of strongly consistence. The second model adds the consideration of service level. We prove that the booking decision and shipment assignment are independent and thus solvable like Model 1. Numerical results demonstrate the impacts of demand characteristics on shipper’s booking behavior, showing that the optimal volume of confirmed booking reveals shipment show-up probability. For the carrier, a small discount can be enough to encourage the shipper to use confirmed booking. In the <b>multiple-carrier</b> problem, a new booking and assignment policy is designed for the shipper to make decisions when some carriers offer discounts for confirmed booking and other carriers do not. The proposed policy is proved to be feasible and satisfying the MQC requirement, while enabling the shipper to make the best use of the discount. The new policy shifts the no-show risk of demand from participating carriers to non-participating carriers. This forms a strategic game for the carriers and pushes them to participate in the new contract, so that in the unique Nash Equilibrium, the shipper as the creator of the game can minimize its total cost as all carriers participate...|$|E
30|$|In {{the past}} three decades, {{significant}} progress has been achieved in UWA communications [2 – 14]. Earlier UWA communications adopted noncoherent frequency-shift keying (FSK) technology which enabled simple energy-based signal detection combating the unpleasant effect of channel reverberation [2]. The drawback of FSK lies in its low transmission rate and also low bandwidth efficiency. The partial coherent modulation of differential phase shift keying (DPSK) was then chosen to achieve a bandwidth efficiency between noncoherent and fully coherent systems. It was until early 1990 s, UWA transmission using the bandwidth-efficient coherent modulation appeared in [3]. Different from FSK, coherent transmission adopting modulations like phase shift keying (PSK) and quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) requires proper cancelation of intersymbol interference (ISI) and compensation of phase distortion in signal detection; both tasks become very difficult under hash UWA channel conditions. Passive-phase conjugation (PPC) [4] and time reversal (TR) [5] technologies, both having different principles from equalization, have been proposed to mitigate ISI. The detection using PPC technology, however, has poor performance when {{only a small number}} of receiving hydrophones are available [6]. As a result, equalization technology is more commonly adopted for coherent detection. Generally, equalization can be performed in either time-domain (TD) [7 – 11] or frequency-domain (FD) [12 – 14]. In [7, 8], the classic joint design of decision feedback equalizer (DFE) and phase-locked loop (PLL) has been proposed, and its iterative implementation can be found in [9]. In [10], by coupling PPC technology with a single-channel DFE, the correlation-based DFE is proposed and tested to be robust to different acoustic environments. The phase rotation is tracked with PLL technology. In [11], linear equalization combined with proper phase compensation has been proposed to minimize error propagation due to incorrect decision feedback. In [12], single-carrier frequency-domain equalization (SC-FDE) followed by phase compensation is proposed for single-carrier systems, and the frequency-domain equalization for <b>multiple-carrier</b> orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems has been proposed in [13, 14]. In [13], equalization is performed with adaptive channel estimation and phase tracking method. In [14], pilot-aided channel estimation is adopted for equalization, and a two-step Doppler compensation is adopted to remove phase rotation. While FD equalization enables low-complexity implementation even over highly dispersive channel, it usually requires extra guard intervals (GIs) among transmission blocks, which sacrifices the data transmission efficiency. Moreover, the inherent sensitivity of OFDM systems to carrier frequency offset makes robust signal detection very challenging especially with moving transceivers.|$|E
40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{dedicated}} to transceiver designs for high data-rate wireless communication systems with rapidly moving terminals. The challenges are two-fold. On the one hand, more spectral bandwidth of the transmitted signals is required by future wireless systems to obtain higher transmission rates, which can result in the frequency selectivity of the communication channels. On the other hand, Doppler effects emerge when high mobile speeds are present, which can result in the time selectivity of the communication channels. Therefore, {{it is likely that}} future wireless communication systems operate in doubly-selective channels, which impose many difficulties on transceiver designs. In this thesis, we investigate these challenges in the following four scenarios, and propose a number of corresponding solutions. OFDM over Narrowband Channels: Orthogonal frequency-divisionmultiplexing (OFDM) is a typical <b>multiple-carrier</b> transmission technique. In a narrowband scenario, Doppler effects are well approximated as frequency shifts. In this manner, a narrowband doubly-selective channel for OFDM systems can be approximately characterized as a banded matrix especially when a basis expansion model (BEM) is exploited to model the channel. It thus allows to reduce the complexity of the channel equalization. However, there are various different BEM’s available. We identify a particular BEM which leads to a more efficient hardware architecture than other choices, while still maintaining a high modeling accuracy. OFDM over Wideband Channels: The Doppler effect manifests itself as a distinct phenomenon in wideband channels compared to narrowband channels. Specifically, the wideband signal waveformismeasurably dilated or compressed when Doppler is present rather than just frequency-shifted. This unique nature ofwideband time-varying channels requires new designs for wideband OFDM systems. We first quantify the amount of interference resulting from wideband doubly-selective channels which follow the multi-scale/multi-lag (MSML) model. Then we discuss an equalization method for wideband channels either in the frequency domain or in the time domain. A novel optimum resampling procedure is also introduced, which is normally unnecessary in narrowband systems. Multi-Rate Transmissions over Wideband Channels: Traditional multi-carrier transmission schemes, e. g., OFDM, use a uniformdata rate on each subcarrier, which is inherently mismatched with wideband time-varying channels. In fact, the time variation of wideband channels, i. e., the Doppler scales, imply a non-uniform sampling mechanism. To mitigate this, we propose a novel multi-rate transmission scheme by placing the information symbols at different non-overlapping sub-bands where each sub-band has a distinctive bandwidth. To combat the MSML effect of the channel, a filterbank is deployed at the receiver, where each branch of the filterbank samples the received signal at a corresponding rate. By selecting a proper transmit/receiver pulse, the effective input/output relationship can be captured by a block-diagonal channel, with each diagonal block being a banded matrix similarly as seen in narrowband OFDM systems. The benefit of this similarity is that existing low-complexity equalizers can be adopted for wideband communications. Robust Multi-band Transmissions over Wideband Channels: Accurate channel estimation for wideband doubly-selective channels is challenging and troublesome. Adaptive channel equalization is thus attractive since it does not require precise channel information and is robust to various prevailing environmental conditions. When the MSML effect emerges in wideband channels, it is not wise to adopt existing adaptive equalization designs that are previously used in other scenarios, e. g., narrowband channels. We adopt a multi-band frequency-division multiplexing (FDM) signal waveform at the transmitter to reduce the equalization complexity, while maintaining a high data rate. By carefully designing the transmit pulse, our proposed multi-layer turbo equalization, using a phase-locked loop (PLL) followed by a time-invariant finite impulse response (FIR) filter, is capable of equalizing such MSML channels.
