Of these isolates, 630 {{were identified as}} P. stuartii, 206 were identified as Providencia rettgeri, and 1 was identified as Providencia alcalifaciens. Twelve inositol-positive isolates from 10 patients (10 strains) resembled P. stuartii in fermenting trehalose but resembled P. rettgeri in fermenting D-arabitol or <b>meso-erythritol</b> or both. The latter traits, however, were not stable in all cases. These aberrant strains were identified as P. stuartii {{on the basis of}} their O antigens and DNA hybridization experiments. All isolates were tested for L-glutamic acid decarboxylase activity by a qualitative thin-layer chromatography method. All P. stuartii isolates, including the aberrant ones, were trehalose positive and L-glutamic acid decarboxylase negative. None of the P. rettgeri isolates fermented trehalose, while 99. 0 % of them and the single P. alcalifaciens strain were L-glutamic acid decarboxylase positive.

DNA DNA hybridization experiments on the type strains of these species revealed moderate DNA relatedness values (39 - 65 %). The three strains used D-fructose, D-sorbitol, <b>meso-erythritol,</b> glycerol,L-sorbose, ethanol (weakly), sucrose and raffinose as a sole carbon source for growth (weak growth on the latter two carbon sources was obtained for strains LMG 27748 (T) and LMG 27882).

These genotypic and phenotypic characteristics distinguish strains LMG 27748 (T), LMG 27749 and LMG 27882 from species of the genus Gluconobacter with validly published names and, therefore, we propose classifying them formally as representatives of a novel species, Gluconobacter cerevisiae sp. nov., with LMG 27748 (T) (=DSM 27644 (T)) as the type strain...|$|E

Results: With the increase of the kLa value in the fed-batch culture, l-erythrulose concentration, productivity and yield were significantly improved, while cell growth was not {{the best in the}} high kLa. Thus, a two-stage oxygen supply control strategy was proposed, aimed at achieving high concentration and high productivity of l-erythrulose.

Identification of predictors of weight gain and adiposity change, considering population subgroup differences, could lead to effective prevention strategies. Methods: In the context of a prospective study design of college freshmen with repeated measures of anthropometry and adiposity (measured via dual energy x-ray absorptiometry), over one academic year, we evaluated multiple independent variables as potential predictors of weight gain and adiposity, testing for effect modification by sex. We also compared the metabolome between participants who increased in three markers of central adiposity over the year vs. those with stable adiposity. Results: 264 freshmen (50 % female, characteristics representative of the Class of 2015) participated; 65 % (N = 173) completed follow-up 8 - 9 months later, at the end of the academic year. Weight gain was ~ 2 kg overall; among the 75 % who gained at least 0. 5 kg over the year, weight increased 5. 6 %, on average. Leaner body habitus at the start of college (leaner adiposity and anthropometrics) was associated with greater weight gain and weight gain risk in regression analyses. We observed a significant sex x physical activity interaction (Pinteraction = 0. 049) such that, higher baseline physical activity predicted greater weight gain among females. Investigation of psychological factors, including eating competence, restraint, and overeating due to emotional or external cues, as predictors of changes in adiposity and weight were generally null; however, there was a consistent and statistically significant stress x sex interaction such that greater stress at the start of college was significantly associated with increases in weight, waist circumference and BMI among males. Metabolomics investigation results showed baseline plasma concentrations of <b>meso-erythritol</b> and fructose, two dietary sweeteners, were respectively 15 - and 2 -fold greater among participants who subsequently experienced increased central adiposity, compared to participants who maintained a stable adiposity phenotype. Conclusions: Weight gain {{during the first year}} of university is common, and leaner body habitus at the beginning of college was associated with greater weight gain. There were meaningful sex differences in predictors of weight gain: higher self-reported baseline physical activity in females only and, higher self-reported baseline stress in males only, were both associated with greater weight gain.

40|$|Continuing {{depletion}} of world’s {{fossil fuel resources}} has been a driving factor for seeking an ultimate goal of reducing heavy US dependence on fossil fuels by extensively investigating and developing alternative fuel sources and technologies including biorefinery use of lignocellulose biomass. Electrochemistry and electrocatalysis based technologies have great potential {{to be used in}} the next generation of biorefineries, part of developing sustainable technologies to mitigate global warming and lower dependence on fossil fuels. Electrical energy could be directly generated using electrochemical fuel cell reactors based on electrocatalytic conversion processes. This might be a promising green route to partially alleviating our energy dependence on traditional fossil fuel resources. Although great progress has been achieved in selective catalytic conversion of biorenewable compounds in heterogeneous catalysis, there is still a need to explore and develop electrocatalytic biorefineries to selectively produce valuable chemicals while simultaneously generating electricity. The research efforts described in this Ph. D. dissertation are divided into two parts: applied fundamental electrocatalysis research and practical direct biorenewable fuel cell technologies development. First, electrocatalytic oxidation of biorenewable polyols (C 3 glycerol and C 4 <b>meso-erythritol)</b> for valuable chemicals and electricity cogeneration has been investigated on supported Pd-based nanoparticle electrocatalysts in alkaline anion-exchange membrane fuel cells. PdAg bimetallic nanoparticle catalyst has been shown more efficient than Pd for alcohol oxidation due to Pd facilitating deprotonation of alcohol in a base electrolyte, while Ag promotes intermediate aldehyde oxidation and cleavage of C-C bond of C 3 species to C 2 species. A mechanistic understanding of electrocatalytic oxidation of glycerol and <b>meso-erythritol</b> and associated bond breaking on PdAg bimetallic catalysts has been developed, and the keys influencing product distribution and reaction pathways were further elucidated and controlled by optimizing electrocatalysts and reaction conditions. The second part of this dissertation describes the development of practical biorenewable fuel cells technologies focused on alternative “fuel” and inexpensive durable “cells” (device). A new route for directly using complex biomass derived bio-oil as an alternative fuel to generate electricity in alkaline membrane fuel cells has been explored. Electrochemical performance of bio-oil derived from the pyrolysis of lignocellulosic biomass over precious metal monometallic catalysts such as Pt/CNT, Pd/CNT, Au/CNT, and Ag/CNT has been studied. In order to reduce costs and improve durability of fuel cell devices, the usage of porous polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) thin films as separators in high alkaline direct glycerol fuel cells has been thoroughly investigated. Low-cost, stable and durable PTFE thin film separators have demonstrated superior performances compared to state-of-the-art anion exchange membranes with respect to anode degradation in alkaline fuel cells under harsh alkaline conditions. Our preliminary work on integration of carbon-based cathode catalyst, porous PTFE thin film separator, and crude biorenewable fuel into a fuel cell device to generate low cost bio-electricity has shown promise toward the development of novel alkaline fuel cells with high performance, low cost, and desired durability...|$|E
40|$|By using membrane-bound dehydrogenases, Gluconobacter oxydans {{characteristically}} accomplishes single-step oxidation of many polyols {{and quantitative}} {{release of the}} oxidation product into the medium. These cells typically differentiate by forming intracytoplasmic membranes (ICM) after exponential growth on glycerol. Earlier experiments demonstrated that glycerol-grown cells containing ICM oxidized glycerol more rapidly than cells which were harvested during exponential growth and lacked ICM (Claus et al., J. Bacteriol. 123 : 1169 - 1183). This report demonstrates that ICM are also formed after growth on sorbitol. Sorbitol-grown, ICM-containing maximum stationary-phase (MSP) cells showed from 50 to 300 % greater oxidation (respiration) rates on mannitol, glycerol, glucose, <b>meso-erythritol,</b> and meso-inositol than did exponential-phase (EXP) cells which lacked ICM. Both EXP and MSP cells exhibited maximum sorbitol oxidation at pH 5. 0, 38 °C, and 5 % (wt/vol) sorbitol. When assayed under these optimum conditions, ICM-containing MSP cells demonstrated a 72 % increase in respiration on sorbitol {{compared with that of}} EXP cells lacking ICM (oxygen quotients of 3, 100 and 1, 800, respectively). Gas chromatographic studies showed that sorbose was the only detectable product released from cells during oxygen quotient analysis. The specific activity of particulate-bound sorbitol dehydrogenase from ICM-containing MSP cells was twice that obtained from particulate fractions prepared from EXP cells lacking ICM. These results show that neither ICM formation after exponential growth nor increased respiration of other polyols is dependent upon the polyol used to grow cells. Our results suggest that increased respiratory activity of MSP cells is caused both by ICM formation and by increased synthesis (or activity) of the polyol dehydrogenases found in these membranes...|$|E
40|$|The {{physical}} properties, viscosity, conductivity, {{surface tension}} and density were measured {{for a series}} of alcohol based Deep Eutectic Solvents (DES) as a function of choline chloride (ChCl) concentration. The point at which the system becomes a saturated salt solution in the diol systems is at 20 mol% ChCl, because at higher concentrations the conductivity decreases despite the increase in number of charge carrying species. The addition of ChCl to glycerol results in a decrease in the viscosity of the system by interrupting the intermolecular hydrogen bonding of the glycerol molecules, whereas the addition of ChCl to the diols results in an increase in viscosity. The mono-alcohol phenol has been shown to form a DES in a ratio of 4 : 1 phenol: ChCl. Stable DES’s have also been formed using sugars, D-(-) fructose, D-glucose, xylitol and <b>meso-erythritol.</b> Determination of solvent-solute interactions is key to the understanding of solvent properties in liquids therefore the Kamlet-Taft parameters α, β, π* and ET (30) parameter were determined {{for a series of}} alcohol based DES using three solvatochromic dyes, 4 -nitroaniline, N,N-dimethyl- 4 -nitroaniline and Reichardt’s dye ET (30). It is shown that they are similar to RNH 3 +X-, R 2 NH 2 +X- and imidazolium ionic liquids. The effect of ChCl on the Kamlet-Taft parameters is not uniform across the systems and is dependant upon the hydrogen bond donor. The solventless esterification of glycerol and lauric was carried out using ChCl with the intention of using its hydrogen bonding interaction with glycerol to behave a potential site inhibitor as to selectively form mono- or di-ester products. The work has shown that the addition of ChCl to the system, initially slows the rate of the mono-ester formation, but actually encourages the reaction to progress further towards the di-ester product, when compared to the pure glycerol system encouraging only mono-ester formation.

40|$|Salmonella dublin is a {{well-known}} cause of bovine abortion and was responsible for 309 (2. 8 yo) of 14 I 16 abortions investigated in England and Wales between July 1968 and June 1969 (Hugh-Jones, 1971). The literature has been reviewed (Hinton, 1971). Abortion {{may be associated with}} symptoms of dysentery or it may occur {{in the absence of any}} other clinical signs. Salmonella can usually be isolated from the foetus or the foetal membranes in pure culture, and a serological response can be demonstrated in most cases. Smith and his colleagues (Smith et al. 1962) have shown that the polyol, erythritol, may be one of the main factors responsible for the localization of Brucella abortus in the bovine uterus. Erythritol stimulates the growth of Brucella abortus, B. melitensis and B. suis (Williams, Keppie & Smith, 1964). Brucella abortus will grow in media in which erythritol is the only carbohydrate (McCullough & Beal, 195 I) and the organism will use the polyol in preference to glucose, sorbitol or fructose as a carbon and energy source (Anderson & Smith, 1965). Erythritol is concentrated in the bovine chorion, cotyledons and foetal fluids (Williams, Keppie & Smith, 1962) and it is also found in placental extracts of other hosts susceptible to brucella infections, including sheep, goats and pigs (Smith et al. 1962).

High-valent oxorhenium complexes {{are among the}} most efficient catalysts for deoxygenation reactions, and have been studies using various reductants including organic phosphines, molecular hydrogen (H 2), sulfite, and alcohols. These complexes exhibit intriguing oxophilic performance, which facilitates selective C-O bond cleavage of polyols. ^ My thesis research focuses on catalytic transformations with oxorhenium and chromium complexes for deoxydehydration of polyols and selective reduction of dioxygen. I have investigated various catalytic deoxydehydration (DODH) reactions of biomass-derived polyols with high-valent oxorhenium complexes. Cooperating with another graduate student in our group, we were able to demonstrate the use of oxo-rhenium complexes as catalysts for the transformation of glycerol and erythritol to small and useful organics (SUO). Glycerol was reduced to generate allylic alcohol, and can be continuously driven to high yields by separation of the volatile products. <b>Meso-erythritol</b> was reduced to dihydrofuran. The work was published in ChemSusChem (DOI: 10. 1002 /cssc. 201200138). I further investigated the MTO-catalyzed DODH reaction with sacrificial alcohol as reductant, and elucidated the reaction mechanism based on detailed kinetics, spectroscopics (NMR, XRD, ESI-MS, UV-vis) and isotope labeling studies. Our findings revealed a new mechanism for DODH with oxorhenium based on a rhenium(V) /rhenium(III) cycle, which should stimulate future catalyst design. This mechanistic study was published in Organometallics (DOI: 10. 1021 /om 400127 z). ^ In the spring of 2013, I had the opportunity to visit Osaka University as a visiting scholar. I was very motivated by the unique electrocatalysis properties of chromium-corrole complexes we synthesized, which emulate the natural metalloenzymes. The chromium-corrole complex catalyzed the selective two-electron reduction of O 2 by ferrocene derivatives in the presence of trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) at room temperature. We further investigated the catalytic mechanism and reaction selectivities based on detailed kinetic studies of each step in the catalytic cycle as well as the overall catalytic reaction and detection of reactive intermediates. The study also revealed ultra-fast electron-transfer from ferrocene derivative to Cr(V) -oxo corrole. This work resulted in two papers, one published in Inorganic Chemistry (DOI: 10. 1021 /ic 5013457), and the other to be submitted. My current work is a collaboration with Eli Lilly 2 ̆ 6 Co. on the synthesis of green polar aprotic solvents using ruthenium catalysts, which involves dehydrogenation reactions of biomass-derived compounds followed by coupling with amines.

The macroscopically homogeneous films obtained were characterized by 29 Si NMR, Attenuated Total Reflectance/Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR), Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA), Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) including Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy (EDX), swelling in hexane and extraction in toluene, adhesion on aluminum plate and hardness. The hybrid films that showed the best characteristics considering the results of swelling in hexane and extraction in toluene, adhesion on aluminum plate and hardness tests were those prepared with systems hydroxylated soybean oil with OH values of 198 and TEOS and the modified soybean oil with 3 -aminopropyltriethoxysilane and TEOS...|$|E
