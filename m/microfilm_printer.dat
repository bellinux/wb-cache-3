5000|$|... 1954 Major {{contract}} for Charactron tubes received (SAGE). First Charactron <b>microfilm</b> <b>printer</b> (Model 100) built.|$|E
50|$|The 1385 was {{followed}} by the first automatic xerographic printer, the Copyflo, in 1955. The Copyflo was a large <b>microfilm</b> <b>printer</b> which could produce positive prints on roll paper from any type of microfilm negative. Following the Copyflo, the process was scaled down to produce the 1824 <b>microfilm</b> <b>printer.</b> At about half the size and weight, this still sizable machine printed onto hand-fed, cut-sheet paper which was pulled through the process by one of two gripper bars. A scaled-down version of this gripper feed system was to become the basis for the 813 desktop copier.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>microfilm</b> <b>printer</b> was {{originally}} {{developed for the}} Social Security Administration to handle its large volume of microfilm data. In 1959, Stromberg-Carlson introduced the SC4020, a computer-controlled <b>microfilm</b> <b>printer</b> and plotter, used chiefly for COM (Computer Output Microfilm) applications. The SC4020 utilized a Charactron cathode-ray-tube (CRT) with an internal mask (or stencil) through which the electron beam was deflected to choose an alphanumeric character, and the character-shaped beam was then deflected to a target position on the faceplate of the CRT. A 35 mm or 16 mm shutterless camera, in a lightproof enclosed cabinet along with the CRT, captured the imagery produced on the faceplate. The film was then developed chemically, separate from the SC4020, and could be later enlarged onto paper. The instructions to control the SC4020 were created by a mainframe computer and transferred to the SC4020 on magnetic tape. A “quick-look,” separate from the SC4020, was available using zinc oxide photosensitized paper.|$|E

Included in the services and materials that the library offers to the community are: books, eBooks, sound recordings, audio books, eAudiobooks, Playaways, magazines, newspapers, video games, public meeting rooms, large-type books, DVDs, compact discs, STEM kits, puzzles, puppets, oral history, films, copy machines, public access computer catalogs with <b>printers,</b> <b>microfilm</b> reader- <b>printer,</b> children and adult programs, information services, Internet access, health information, tax assistance, and volunteer opportunities.|$|R
50|$|The library has a {{computer}} lab and homework center, a copy machine, a <b>microfilm</b> reader <b>printer</b> and a microfche reader printer. Prueter Library has books in Spanish for {{both children and}} adults. Because the library is {{in the home of}} the navy base, the library makes an effort to collect materials about Port Hueneme, the Seabees, and the U.S. Navy.|$|R

50|$|In {{the early}} 1960s, the Stromberg Carlson SC-4020 <b>microfilm</b> <b>printer</b> was used at Bell Telephone Laboratories as a plotter to produce digital {{computer}} art and animation on 35-mm microfilm. Still images were {{drawn on the}} face plate of the cathode ray tube and automatically photographed. A series of still images were drawn to create a computer-animated movie, early on a roll of 35-mm film and then on 16-mm film as a 16-mm camera was later added to the SC-4020 printer.|$|E
50|$|A <b>microfilm</b> <b>printer</b> {{contains}} a xerographic copying process, like a photocopier. The image to be printed is projected with synchronised movement {{on to the}} drum. These devices offer either small image preview for the operator or full size image preview, when it is called a reader printer. Microform printers can accept positive or negative films and positive or negative images on paper. New machines allow the user to scan a microform image and save it as a digital file: see the section below on digital conversion.|$|E
50|$|Only the {{microfilm}} {{collections are}} allowed to be viewed by researchers. Services are {{made available to the}} faculty, staff and students of UST as well as to outsiders. UST students are required to present his/her library card and a letter from the adviser or Department Head. Research fee of P20.00 per visit is charged for researchers. Microfilm reader fee is P2.00 per hour, while a fee of P4.00 per page is charged for the <b>microfilm</b> <b>printer.</b> The microfilm section is open to researchers every Tuesdays to Fridays at 9:00 to 12:00 AM, and 1:00 to 5:00 PM.|$|E
5000|$|From fiction, to anime, mystery, history, {{and large}} print, IPL's shelves cover {{a wide range}} of subject matter and formats. Patrons can also find DVD's, video games, computers, eReaders, puzzles, <b>microfilm</b> readers, <b>printers,</b> scanners, and a nearly {{complete}} set of yearbooks from Independence High School dating back to 1911. [...] The library {{is also a member of}} SEKnFind, a 41-member consortium of Southeast Kansas Libraries, allowing for a robust inter-library loan program.|$|R
50|$|A {{new era of}} {{library service}} began with the move to the new building. A new {{bookmobile}} was purchased in 1978. A high-tech microfilm reader-printer {{was given to the}} library by the B'nai B'rith Lodge in 1970. Several neighborhood libraries were established under the Model Cities Program (no longer in existence). Art work was added to the circulating collection. The Israelite House of David research room was opened. The library offered rental of videodiscs, and later videotapes. A computer terminal with internet access was made available to the public in 1997. That same year, the Benton Harbor Lions Club Foundation paid for half of a new $14,000 <b>microfilm</b> reader <b>printer.</b>|$|R
50|$|Document imaging is an {{information}} technology category for systems capable of replicating documents commonly used in business. Document imaging systems can take many forms including <b>microfilm,</b> on demand <b>printers,</b> facsimile machines, copiers, multifunction printers, document scanners, computer output microfilm (COM) and archive writers. Document Imaging means the conversion of paper files (of any size or description) or microfilm / fiche to digital images.|$|R
