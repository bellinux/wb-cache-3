Hager had initially volunteered to give evidence, however decided {{he did not want to}} after <b>Mr</b> <b>Williams</b> gave evidence in relation to Craig's treatment of his former press secretary, Rachel MacGregor. Craig gave evidence that he had read Hager's book Dirty Politics before producing his pamphlet Dirty Politics and Hidden Agendas, which was found to have defamed Williams. Hager took the stand as an expert witness and alleged that publications linked to Jordan Williams on Cameron Slater's blog attacked Craig and followed a similar pattern that had been documented in his book. After testifying for fifteen minutes, Hager was not cross-examined by Williams' lawyers and was allowed to leave by the judge.|$|E

In 1910, the North Devon Coast was hit by severe storms, and the embankments around Horsey Island were breached in several places. A breach also occurred in the walls of the new cut, with local newspapers describing a boat passing through the breach onto the marsh, and back out again when the tide turned, but few other details are known, as contemporary sources were more concerned with the task of repairing the embankments around Horsey Island.|$|E

By 1740, George Mason was again at Chopawamsic, under the tutelage of a Dr. Bridges. Mason's biographers have speculated that this was Charles Bridges, who helped develop the schools run in Britain by the Society for the Promotion of Christian Knowledge, and who came to America in 1731. In addition, Mason and his brother Thomson doubtlessly had the run of Mercer's library, {{one of the largest in}} Virginia, and the conversations of Mercer and the book-lovers who gathered around him were likely an education in themselves.|$|E

[...] During jury selection the defence objected to three potential jurors (much less than the Crown's 17objections) but were too late to argue the choice of foreman, who, it was claimed, had publicly called Canning [...] "a LYING B——H, a CHEAT, or an IMPOSTER". [...] Presiding over the courtroom was the new Lord Mayor, Thomas Rawlinson (Crisp Gascoyne's successor Edward Ironside having died in office in November 1753), with Edward Clive (Justice of the Common Pleas), Heneage Legge (Baron of the Exchequer), William Moreton (Recorder of London), and Samuel Fludyer, alderman. [...] Canning was represented by three attorneys, George Nares, John Morton and a <b>Mr</b> <b>Williams.</b> [...] Prosecuting was Gascoyne's son Bamber, Edward Willes and William Davy. [...] After her indictment was read by the Clerk of Arraigns the story of Canning's supposed abduction and imprisonment was retold by Bamber Gascoyne. [...] Then Davy spoke at length. [...] He attacked Canning's story and told how Squires and her family had travelled through England with smuggled goods to sell. [...] He offered new evidence to support Squires' alibi and rubbished Canning's description of her prison, before questioning her account of her escape. [...] He concluded with Virtue Hall's recantation of her earlier testimony. [...] Willes was the next to speak, picking over the discrepancies between the various accounts offered by Canning of her disappearance.|$|E
500|$|According to Beckerlegge, {{there was}} a view held by many of those {{involved}} in the keenly fought struggle between Williams and Müller that more depended on the result than simply one man's career– missionary success or failure in India, [...] "and even the future stability of British rule in this region" [...] (in the light of events in India a few years previously) might depend on the abilities of the Boden professor. Victory would depend on each side's ability to persuade non-resident members of Convocation to return to Oxford to cast their votes. Each candidate had their supporters: Müller was backed by scholars of international merit, whereas Williams was able to call upon Oxford-based academics and those who had served in India as administrators or missionaries. Both candidates claimed support from Wilson– [...] "as if the principle of apostolic succession was involved in the appointment", says Chaudhuri. The Times reported on 23 May that friends of Williams placed considerable weight upon a private letter to him from Wilson, [...] "indicating <b>Mr.</b> <b>Williams</b> as his probable successor." [...] In return, Wilson was revealed to have said [...] "two months before his death" [...] that [...] "Mr. Max Müller was the first Sanskrit scholar in Europe". The source of this information was W. S. W. Vaux, of the British Museum, who described his conversation with Wilson in a letter to Müller in May 1860. In reply to Vaux's comment that he and others wanted Wilson's successor to be [...] "the finest man we could procure", Vaux quoted Wilson as saying that [...] "You will be quite right if your choice should fall on Max Müller." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1867 Restieaux was foreman of a Guano {{excavation}} {{operation at}} McKean Island, in the Phoenix Islands (which {{is now part}} of Kiribati). Towards the end of 1867 he was a passenger on the brig Kamehameka going to Honolulu for a vacation. At this time Ben Pease was the captain of the schooner the Blossom and trading in coconut and coconut oil in the Marshall Islands. As trading was good, in late 1867 Pease sent George Bridges, his mate, to Honolulu to ask Mr. C. A. Williams, the owner of the Blossom, to supply another schooner and to engage someone to take charge of the trading station at Ponape atoll (now known as Pohnpei). Williams engaged Restieaux for the position on Ponape and sent the schooner Malolo under Captain Bridges. [...] The Malolo arrived at Mili Atoll on 1 March 1868. Instead of going to Ponape, Restieaux was put in charge of the Mili station.

2500|$|Williams's work is {{identified}} with the noir fiction subgenre of [...] "hardboiled" [...] crime writing. His 1953 novel Hell Hath No Fury—- published by the defining pulp crime fiction company, Gold Medal Books—- was the first paperback original to merit a review from renowned critic Anthony Boucher of The New York Times. Boucher relates Williams {{to two of the}} most famous noir fiction writers: [...] "The striking suspense technique...may remind you of [...] Woolrich; the basic story, with its bitter blend of sex and criminality, may recall James M. Cain. But <b>Mr.</b> <b>Williams</b> is individually himself in his sharp but unmannered prose style and in his refusal to indulge in sentimental compromises." [...] Ed Gorman's description of a characteristic Williams novel, Man on the Run (1958), outlines the essential elements that associate it with the noir fiction category: [...] "a) a falsely accused man trying to elude police, b) a lonely woman as desperate in her way as the man on the run, c) enough atmospherics (night, rain, fog) to enshroud a hundred films noir." [...] Cultural critic Geoffrey O'Brien further details Williams's [...] "chief characteristics": ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{promises}} {{offered by}} {{one person to}} another are the terms of a contract, but not every representation before an acceptance will always count as a term. The basic rule of construction is that a representation is a term if it looked like it was [...] "intended" [...] to be from the viewpoint of a reasonable person. It matters how much importance is attached to the term by the parties themselves, but also as a way to protect parties of lesser means, the courts added that someone who is in a more knowledgeable position {{will be more likely to}} be taken to have made a promise, rather than a mere representation. In Oscar Chess Ltd v Williams <b>Mr</b> <b>Williams</b> sold a Morris car to a second hand dealer and wrongly (but in good faith, relying on a forged log-book) said it was a 1948 model when it was really from 1937. The Court of Appeal held that the car dealer could not later claim breach of contract because they were in a better position to know the model. By contrast, in Dick Bentley Productions Ltd v Harold Smith (Motors) Ltd the Court of Appeal held that when a car dealer sold a Bentley to a customer, mistakenly stating it had done 20,000 miles when the true figure was 100,000 miles, this was intended to become a term because the car dealer was in a better position to know. A misrepresentation may also generate the right to cancel (or [...] "rescind") the contract and claim damages for [...] "reliance" [...] losses (as if the statement had not been made, and so to get one's money back). But if the representation is also a contract term a claimant may also get damages reflecting [...] "expected" [...] profits (as if the contract were performed as promised), though often the two measures coincide.|$|E
