6000|$|Section 20. Finally, we note two {{series of}} buds of cells, one {{on either side}} of the archenteron in Figure 7 ii.

They finally appear to (? entirely) obliterate the segmentation cavity-- they certainly do so throughout the body; and their cavities are in time cut off from the <b>mesenteron,</b> by the gradual constriction of their openings. In this way the coelom (body cavity) arises as a series of hollow [...] "archenteric" [...] outgrowths, and ms. becomes the alimentary canal. mt.c., the metapleural canals, probably arise subsequently to, and independently of, the general coelomic space, by a splitting in the body-wall substance.|$|E

50|$|The midgut (<b>mesenteron)</b> is {{the largest}} organ in harvestmen and fills most of the opisthosoma. Like in other {{arthropods}} it {{is derived from the}} endoderm. Unlike the fore- and hindgut, which are derived from ectoderm, it has no cuticular lining. The midgut is surrounded by muscle cells, trachaeae and intermediate tissue, which does not form a fat body like in scorpions and solifuges. The epithelial cells of the midgut are often infected by rickettsia-like parasites, like in some other arachnids. Resorptive cells, which may be unique to harvestmen, contain lipid droplets, glycogen and mineral spherites. These spherites are also common in many arachnids. They seem to function in heavy metal excretion and mineral storage. Overwintering juveniles store calcium and phosphates in it for molting. Silicon is present throughout the life, but decreases with age, as does the number of spherites.|$|E

Significant mortality was recorded the fifth day after treatments, using ethanol at 50 % by ingestion (52. 5 %) and crude aqueous C. procera extracts (45 %) when applied by contact and ingestion and with S. purpurea ethanol extracts at 50 % when used by contact (47 %).

40|$|A general {{account is}} given of the {{development}} of Daphnia magna from the egg to the mature adult. A review of previous work reveals that authors have concentrated on the early development, neglecting the later development. An adequate technique has been developed. An account {{of the development}} based on living material gives a detailed series of stages. A summary of the present state of knowledge of the physiological aspects of development is included. The development of the parthenogenetic egg is described. The early development includes a superficial cleavage and gastrulation by immigration. The <b>mesenteron</b> develops from a solid rod of cells in the ventral part of the egg, and acquires a central cavity which never contains yolk. The yolk cells develop from the blastoderm. The mesoderm develops a single small pair of coelomic cavities, and the heart develops from a compact group of cells. The history of the dorsal organ is described. The development of the ephippial egg resembles that of the parthenogenetic egg except in some features related to the smaller and more even sized nature of the yolk globules. Daphnia magna hatches from the brood pouch of the mother as an immature adult. The account of the anatomy of the adult is a confirmation and extension of previous work, including histology and indicating function. The muscles of the <b>mesenteron</b> are striated, and the heart wall contains anincomplete longitudinal, as well as a circular, layer of muscles. A suggestion is made for a new interpretation of the cells of the branchial sacs. The results obtained and the importance of a large quantity of yolk are discussed. <p...|$|E

40|$|Sand {{flies and}} {{mosquitoes}} are vectors of leishmania and plasmodium, which are parasitic protists, that cause malaria and leishmaniasis. Mosquitoes and sand flies {{are exposed to}} a wide range of micro-organisms, which enter their bodies when they get in contact with the surrounding environment, when they intake food or via a transfer from individual to individual. The larvae acquire micro-organisms from breeding sites microhabitat, the adults from the sugary food and blood.

40|$|The {{biology of}} Pullus impexus (Muls.), a Coccinellid beetle predacious on Adelges piceae (Ratz.) in Switzerland, Germany and France, was studied during 1950 - 1952. The present {{work is a}} part of the {{research}} on the complex problem of factors in the control of the Balsam Woolly Aphid in Canada. The morphology of both the larva and the adult has been studied. Some information has been provided on the probable distribution of the species. P. impexus has only one generation a year. The eggs are deposited during the late summer or early autumn on infested trees and the larvae hatch in April. The larvae develop and adults appear in May. The adults of the new generation are to be found in June together with adults of the old generation. In the biology, particular attention has been directed to the diet of the insect in each of its stages, in order to establish the value of the species from the standpoint of biological control. Two new species of Hymenopterous parasites were found in Switzerland and in Germany, Scymnophagus mesnili Ferr., a parasite of pupae, and Centistes scymni Ferr., a parasite of the imagines. The life history of these species has been briefly studied. A cephaline gregarine species was noted in the <b>mesenteron</b> of adults of P. impexus and a nematode in the abdominal cavity of a female.

40|$|This paper {{attempts}} {{to pinpoint the}} most original morphological anatomical features of the biology of filariae per se and those which are or could be important for triggering regulatory processes in the arthropod vector and uncontrolled pathogenic processes in the vertebrate hosts. The following stages are considered: the motile egg or newly-hatched larva, the microfilaria, in the lymphatic or blood vessels of its vertebrate host; the larva, its migrations and its intrasyncitial development in the hematophagous arthropod subverted as vector; its transfer to the vertebrate host, migratory properties through the lymphatic system, maturation, mating and, finally, egg laying in the tissues they reach. This synthesis is based on parasite morphological features and their functional interpretation, histological features in the different niches the filariae reach, and on quantitative analyses of filarial development at its different phases, {{as well as on}} the rare and valuable observations of living parasites in situ. Data have been drawn from various species of Onchocercidae from amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals. These comparative analyses have revealed the major constraints to which the filariae, including those parasitizing humans, have been subjected during their evolution from their ancestors, the oviparous and heteroxenic spirurids. Emphasis is placed on mechanical events: resistance of the microfilariae to the currents in the blood or lymph vessels, regulatory processes induced in the vector <b>mesenteron</b> by the movements of the ingested microfilariae, transient disruption by the microfilarial cephalic hook of the vectors' tissues and cell membranes during microfilarial translocation, attachment of males to females during mating by means of 'non-slip' systems, etc. Like other nematodes, filariae are equipped with sensory organs and a locomotor system, composed of the muscles and of the original osmoregulatory-excretory cell. Any change in one of these elements will result in the destruction of the filaria, at some stage of its development. In the vertebrate host, the intravascular stages will no longer be able to resist being carried passively towards the organs of destruction such as the lymph nodes or the lungs...|$|E
