Using data from China’s National Bureau of Statistics and National Development and Reform Commission, we empirically analyze the main determinants of industrial inward FDI, across 20 manufacturing sectors (2 -digit) in China, over the period 2001 - 2008, and we are particularly interested in 9 high-technology (HT) and <b>medium-high-technology</b> (<b>MHT)</b> industries. The random effect panel estimations reveal that when industrial technological intensity is controlled, host technology resources are significantly positive determinants for newly inward FDI. The dynamic econometrical approach by System Generalized Method of Moment (GMM) estimations for HT and MHT industries obtain interesting results, which show evident impacts on MNC’s strategic behaviors, brought about by geographic agglomeration (or industrial concentration) effects and local protection (that we will call “new oligopolistic reactions”). Besides, FDI in HT and MHT industries are both market and export seeking. High productivity, large economies of scale, and abundant technology resources attract newly FDI in these industries. This study has two contributions: firstly, it covers the deficiency that many researches on FDI in China only focus on aggregate flow without distinguishing host sector’s characteristics; secondly, it provide the local government some useful suggestions on regional development and industrial policies, especially in technology industries...|$|E
