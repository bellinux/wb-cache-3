But in these remote days the one inn of Whitby was up a back-yard, and oyster-shell grottoes were the only view from the best private room.|$|E
5|$|At {{eight years}} old, James Dean {{lives with his}} estranged father Winton and mother Mildred in 1939 Santa Monica, California. When Mildred dies of cancer in 1940, Winton sends James on a train to Fairmount, Indiana, along with the coffin {{containing}} her body. Winton does not {{show up at the}} funeral, leaving James to be raised by his aunt and uncle on a farm in Fairmount. Over the years, he becomes <b>more</b> <b>curious</b> about his father's decision to abandon him. He tries to impress him by sending him a package displaying his various athletic trophies in high school sports.|$|E
5|$|Considerable non-printed {{material}} in the Deseret alphabet was made, including a replica headstone in Cedar City, Utah, some coinage, letters, diaries, and meeting minutes. One of the <b>more</b> <b>curious</b> items found in the Deseret alphabet is an English-Hopi dictionary prepared by two Mormon missionaries. It sat unappreciated in handwritten form at the LDS Church Archives until 2014, when Kenneth R. Beesley, a writing system researcher and computer scientist, noticed its significance and transcribed it into standard written English.|$|E

25|$|Even <b>more</b> <b>curious</b> is the {{presence}} of patterns of glazed bricks and various plaques bearing initials and enigmatic symbols. As already mentioned, the porch gable contains glazed headers in a diamond shape (diapering) and a glazed header barge line (a diagonal line of bricks following the barge boards on the gable), but these embellishments are unevenly spaced so that the diamond is clearly off-center (see porch picture in gallery). This irregularity is true for the use of glazed headers throughout the structure.|$|E
25|$|Chipatá was {{the first}} {{settlement}} of the later New Kingdom of Granada, founded by Gonzalo Jiménez de Quesada on March 8, 1537. Shortly after, the rested and reinforced troops set foot to higher terrains towards the south. Different from the scattered and unorganised indigenous groups they encountered before, advancing into the Muisca Confederation, they found a much better organised society and economy. The agriculture of the Muisca impressed the Spanish conquistadors and made them even <b>more</b> <b>curious</b> {{to find out who}} was the leader of the civilisation. While the Muisca regarded the European conquerors with distrust, they were also curious about them and where they came from.|$|E
25|$|After resting at the Sub, Shade unveils {{the reward}} created with the {{recovered}} data: metal crowns called Deceptors which scramble the sensory input of the Overlords' creatures, effectively making a human wearer invisible and non-olfactive {{to them as}} long as the power supply is maintained. It also is later revealed that scent trails are equally scrambled, although footprints are not. With this sudden new advantage and information, Shade is <b>more</b> <b>curious</b> about the method of distribution of Change radiation and sends Ella's team on a newer, even more dangerous mission: to steal a Change Projector from Fort Robertson, the stronghold of the Overlord named Red Diamond. This mission is not successful: on entry, the team discovers that the stronghold stretches underground, allowing for the unforeseen presence of creatures. The team's Deceptors run out prematurely as they discover a Myrmidon barracks, and they escape with a conch-shaped Overlord device called a Thinker, but without Drum who, having been winded, stays behind to fight. It is presumed {{by the rest of the}} team that he is killed.|$|E

500|$|In a mixed review, Evan Sawdey of PopMatters {{called the}} song generic and that [...] "were {{it not for}} her heady lyrics and warped lead-in synth line, [...] "Applause" [...] wouldn’t stand out all that much in radio, which makes it an even <b>more</b> <b>curious</b> choice as a lead single."

500|$|As in {{the first}} contact, the meeting was {{friendly}} and Cabral presented the locals with gifts. The inhabitants were stone age hunter-gatherers, to whom the Europeans assigned the generic label [...] "Indians". The men collected food by stalking game, fishing and foraging, while the women engaged in small-scale farming. They were divided into countless rival tribes. The tribe which Cabral met was the Tupiniquim. Some of these groups were nomadic and others sedentary—having a knowledge of fire but not metalworking. A few tribes engaged in cannibalism. On 26 April, as more and <b>more</b> <b>curious</b> and friendly natives appeared, Cabral ordered his men to build an altar inland where a Christian Mass was held—the first celebrated on the soil of what would later become Brazil. He, along with the ships' crews, participated.|$|E

500|$|... In {{the section}} [...] "Morphology" [...] of Chapter XIII of On the Origin of Species, Darwin commented on {{homologous}} bone patterns {{between humans and}} other mammals, writing: [...] "What can be <b>more</b> <b>curious</b> than that {{the hand of a}} man, formed for grasping, that of a mole for digging, the leg of the horse, the paddle of the porpoise, and the wing of the bat, should all be constructed on the same pattern, and should include the same bones, in the same relative positions?" [...] and in the concluding chapter: [...] "The framework of bones being the same in the hand of a man, wing of a bat, fin of the porpoise, and leg of the horse … at once explain themselves on the theory of descent with slow and slight successive modifications." ...|$|E
500|$|The effects team {{approached}} the new spacecraft's design as inter-dimensional portals resembling orbs. The script had specified {{the inside of}} the orbs as a [...] "white limbo-y thing", but visual-effects consultant Jeff Okun explained this was deleted for being too [...] "cheesy". Derrickson felt not showing {{the inside of the}} ship, unlike the original, would make the audience <b>more</b> <b>curious.</b> As well as computer-generated spheres—such as Klaatu's [...] ship, or a [...] tall orb that rises from the sea— spheres, [...] in diameter, were sculpted by Custom Plastics, which built spheres for Disney theme parks. The spheres were split in two to make transportation easier. It was difficult placing lights inside them without making them melt. The visual-effects team looked at natural objects, including water droplets and the surfaces of Jupiter and Saturn for the spheres' texture.|$|E
500|$|Darwin {{discusses}} morphology, {{including the}} importance of homologous structures. He says, [...] "What can be <b>more</b> <b>curious</b> than that {{the hand of a}} man, formed for grasping, that of a mole for digging, the leg of the horse, the paddle of the porpoise, and the wing of the bat, should all be constructed on the same pattern, and should include the same bones, in the same relative positions?" [...] This made no sense under doctrines of independent creation of species, as even Richard Owen had admitted, but the [...] "explanation is manifest on the theory of the natural selection of successive slight modifications" [...] showing common descent. He notes that animals of the same class often have extremely similar embryos. Darwin discusses rudimentary organs, such as the wings of flightless birds and the rudiments of pelvis and leg bones found in some snakes. He remarks that some rudimentary organs, such as teeth in baleen whales, are found only in embryonic stages. These factors also supported his theory of descent with modification.|$|E
60|$|There is one <b>more</b> very <b>curious</b> {{circumstance}} {{illustrative of}} the Venetian desire to obtain horizontal pressure. In all the Gothic staircases with which I am acquainted, out of Venice, in which vertical shafts {{are used to}} support an inclined line, those shafts are connected by arches rising each above the other, with a little bracket above the capitals, on the side where {{it is necessary to}} raise the arch; or else, though less gracefully, with a longer curve to the lowest side of the arch.|$|R

60|$|Torrance only smiled, but {{the warm}} bronze {{seemed to have}} {{returned}} to Larry's face as he passed on. Flora Schuyler had thanked him, but he had seen what was worth far more to him in Hetty's eyes, and {{knew that it was}} only loyalty to one who had the stronger claim that held her still. After the door closed behind him there was once <b>more</b> a <b>curious</b> stillness in the hall until Torrance went out with his retainers.

500|$|In 1869, the {{antiquarian}} A. L. Lewis {{first visited}} the site, and was informed by locals that several years previously a skull had been uncovered from inside or {{near to the}} chamber, but that they believed it {{to be that of}} a gypsy. A later account elaborated on this, stating that two individuals who excavated in the centre of the chamber without permission discovered a human skeleton, the skull of which was re-buried in the churchyard at Meopham. In an 1878 note published in The Journal of the Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland, Lewis noted that while many tourists visited Kit's Coty House, [...] "very few goes to or ever hears of a yet <b>more</b> <b>curious</b> collection of stones at Colderham or Coldrum Lodge". He believed that the monument consisted of both a [...] "chamber" [...] and an [...] "oval" [...] of stones, suggesting that they were [...] "two distinct erections". In 1880, the archaeologist Flinders Petrie included the existence of the stones at [...] "Coldreham" [...] in his list of Kentish earthworks; although noting that a previous commentator had described the stones as being in the shape of an oval, he instead described them as forming [...] "a rectilinear enclosure" [...] around the chamber. He then included a small, basic plan of the monument.|$|E
500|$|Among his <b>more</b> <b>curious</b> and {{enduring}} innovations was the Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue. [...] The winter months, between the college bowl {{season and the}} start of Major League Baseball's spring training, was a slow time for sports journalism. [...] At the time, winter team sports like basketball and ice hockey were regional niche sports, and there was little to write about. [...] Laguerre had instituted an annual February issue titled [...] "Fun in the Sun", where he sent his staff to an exotic locale to write about and photograph it for his readers. [...] In 1964, he asked Jule Campbell, then a fashion reporter for Sports Illustrated, to [...] "go to some beautiful place and put a pretty girl on the cover" [...] of that year's [...] "Fun in the Sun" [...] issue. That year's issue featured only five pages of girls in swimsuits, and still predominantly featured travel writing, including articles about snorkeling and fish-watching. [...] With the help of that year's [...] "Fun in the Sun" [...] issue, 1964 became the first year that Sports Illustrated would turn a profit. [...] Though originally only planned as a one-off event, Laguerre was convinced by Sports Illustrated art director Dick Gangel to bring back the swimsuits in 1965, only [...] "a lot sexier". [...] Laguerre once again assigned Jule Campbell to scout models and locations. [...] The 1965 issue contained an article entitled [...] "The Nudity Cult" [...] and de-emphasized the travelogue-like writing of previous [...] "Fun in the Sun" [...] issues from which it evolved. [...] Since then, the Swimsuit Issue has become the biggest selling issue of the magazine, and a major cross-over publication for the fashion and modeling worlds as well.|$|E
500|$|In September 2014, Rob Walker of Yahoo! called PewDiePie's {{popularity}} [...] "insane", writing, that it [...] "strikes me as considerably <b>more</b> <b>curious</b> — I mean, {{you know}} who Rihanna is, but would you recognise this kid if he were standing in line behind you at the bank?" [...] Walker, among other reporters and some casual gamers, have questioned the reasons for his popularity, while other reporters have criticised his rise in notability. Walker commented on PewDiePie's interaction with his audience, writing, [...] "While he can be raucous and crude, it always comes across as genuine. He constantly addresses his audience as a bunch of peer-like friends, as opposed to distant, genuflecting fans. He's certainly {{more than willing to}} make fun of himself in the process." [...] In 2015, The Verge wrote, [...] "Love it or hate it, his success — like so many other YouTube personalities — isn't just in playing games but actually connecting and talking directly to an audience. No agent, press release, or any other intermediary. He just hit record." [...] He refers to his fan base as the [...] "Bro Army" [...] and addresses his audience as [...] "bros". On this, Walker wrote, [...] "Profanity aside, it's a bummer that his persona includes constant references to his viewers as [...] "bros," [...] and that he's loose with words like [...] "bitch" [...] when his gaming adventures lead him into contact with female villain characters. Given how smart this guy clearly is when he speaks directly, I suspect he could modify his demeanor in a way that remained engaging to a young fan base but somehow contributed to improving gamer-land’s sometimes disturbingly bro-centric attitude." [...] However, both Walker and Reed have commented on PewDiePie's intelligence, with Reed opining, [...] "He's much more thoughtful and self-aware than he seems in many of his videos." ...|$|E
60|$|This {{sign that}} the {{bombardment}} had ceased was accepted in good faith; and {{as some of the}} military and naval men had carefully noted that each puff from the repeller was accompanied by a shock, it was considered certain that all the bombs which had been discharged had acted, and that, consequently, no further danger was to be apprehended from them. In spite of this announcement many of the spectators would not leave their position on the hills, but a hundred or <b>more</b> of <b>curious</b> and courageous men ventured down into the plain.|$|R

5000|$|Weaver {{was one of}} four {{children}} born to Clarence and Wilma Weaver, a farming couple from Villisca, Iowa. The Weavers were deeply religious and had difficulty finding a denomination that matched their views; hence, they often moved around among Evangelical, Presbyterian, and Baptist churches. Weaver earned decent grades in school and played baseball and football in high school. He professed his faith in Jesus Christ at age 11; however, at a 2007 news conference for Edward and Elaine Brown he stated : [...] "I ain't afraid of dying no <b>more.</b> I'm <b>curious</b> about the afterlife.
