5|$|JAL Express (JEX) was {{established}} on April 1, 1997, as a wholly owned domestic subsidiary airline of Japan Airlines (JAL), {{with an initial}} capital of ¥5.8 million. The airline operates scheduled passenger services to regional domestic destinations in Japan, {{as well as some}} low-demand flights for JAL under wet-lease agreement. It was anticipated that the airline <b>may</b> <b>enter</b> services on the domestic trunk and short-haul international routes. On July 1, 1998, JAL Express commenced operations from Osaka to Miyazaki and Kagoshima with two Boeing 737-400s, non-Japanese cockpit crew, and short-term contracted cabin attendants. The airline's cabin attendants are called Sky Cast, their duties include cleaning the 150-seat cabin between flights.|$|E

If any of the offensive players violate the rule, no points are awarded for the shot and, if there are no more shots remaining, the ball is given to the defending team. If a defending player is in the lane too soon, an extra shot will be awarded regardless of whether the shot was made or missed.|$|E

5|$|The Dominica National Olympic Committee (NOC) {{selected}} one athlete (Durañona) through qualification standards. NOCs <b>may</b> <b>enter</b> athletes {{regardless of}} time (one athlete per sex) {{if they have}} no athletes meeting the entry standard. This {{made it possible for}} Dominica to have two representatives in the sport. The two athletes that were selected to compete in the Rio Games were Yordanys Durañona in the men's triple jump and Thea LaFond in the women's triple jump. Durañona was selected as the flag bearer for both the opening and closing ceremonies.|$|E
5|$|The Wilderness Act {{enhanced}} the protection status of remote or undeveloped land already contained within federally administered protected areas. Passage {{of the act}} ensured that no human improvements would take place aside from those already existing. The protected status in wilderness-designated zones prohibits road and building construction, oil and mineral exploration or mining, and logging, and also prohibits the use of motorized equipment and bicycles. The ways people <b>may</b> <b>enter</b> wilderness areas are on foot or on horseback.|$|E

They are therefore counselled to avoid scuba diving, during which small air bubbles may form in the bloodsteam that may migrate to the brain and cause stroke. Similarly, antimicrobial prophylaxis is advised during procedures in which bacteria <b>may</b> <b>enter</b> the bloodstream, such as dental work, and avoidance of air bubbles during intravenous therapy.|$|E

5|$|Throughout the stages, {{the player}} <b>may</b> <b>enter</b> doors to access seven {{different}} types of chambers. Stores and black markets offer items in exchange for hearts, which are left behind by defeated monsters. Treasure chambers contain items, enemy nests give the player an opportunity to earn extra hearts, and hot springs restore Pit's health. In the god's chamber, the strength of Pit's bow and arrow may be increased depending on several factors, such {{as the number of}} enemies defeated and the amount of damage taken in battle. In the training chamber, Pit will be awarded with one of the three power items if he passes a test of endurance.|$|E
5|$|After {{a period}} of time and under the {{appropriate}} environmental conditions, the dikaryotic mycelia <b>may</b> <b>enter</b> the reproductive stage of the life cycle. Fruit body formation is influenced by external factors such as season (which affects temperature and air humidity), nutrients and light. As fruit bodies develop they produce peridioles containing the basidia upon which new basidiospores are made. Young basidia contain a pair of haploid sexually compatible nuclei which fuse, and the resulting diploid fusion nucleus undergoes meiosis to produce basidiospores, each containing a single haploid nucleus. The dikaryotic mycelia from which the fruit bodies are produced is long lasting, and will continue to produce successive generations of fruit bodies as long as the environmental conditions are favorable.|$|E
5|$|Near {{the top of}} the inrun, {{there is}} a 'start gate' – a metal or wooden beam – on which an athlete sits and awaits their signal to jump via a set of traffic lights (green, amber, and red). These lights are {{operated}} directly by Borek Sedlák. An athlete <b>may</b> <b>enter</b> the gate when amber is shown. If red is shown after this point, the wind conditions will have been deemed unfavourable for a safe jump: the athlete must then carefully exit the gate as they had entered it and await another opportunity to jump. Failure to dismount the gate within ten to fifteen seconds of being shown a red light, or jumping without having been given the signal to go, will disqualify the athlete.|$|E

5|$|Parasitic ant species {{enter the}} colonies of host ants and {{establish}} themselves as social parasites; {{species such as}} Strumigenys xenos are entirely parasitic {{and do not have}} workers, but instead, rely on the food gathered by their Strumigenys perplexa hosts. This form of parasitism is seen across many ant genera, but the parasitic ant is usually a species that is closely related to its host. A variety of methods are employed to enter the nest of the host ant. A parasitic queen <b>may</b> <b>enter</b> the host nest before the first brood has hatched, establishing herself prior to development of a colony scent. Other species use pheromones to confuse the host ants or to trick them into carrying the parasitic queen into the nest. Some simply fight their way into the nest.|$|E

5|$|East of the river, I-96 and M-37 {{pass through}} the {{northern}} suburb of Comstock Park, intersecting Connector M-44 (CONN M-44, Plainfield Avenue) near Lamberton Lake. Past that interchange, the freeway angles southeasterly and then southward, bypassing Grand Rapids to the northeast. East of downtown, I-96/M-37 meets I-196 (Gerald R. Ford Freeway) at a partial interchange; traffic headed eastbound on I-196 must enter I-96 eastbound and only westbound I-96 traffic <b>may</b> <b>enter</b> I-196. Immediately east of the interchange is another for M-44 (East Beltline Avenue) where M-37 separates from the freeway to turn southward. Through this series of interchanges, I-96 curves {{to the east and}} then turns back southward after passing through them. There are two more interchanges for M-21 (Fulton Street) and Cascade Road before I-96 meets the eastern end of M-11 at 28th Street. The next interchange for 36th Street provides access to the Gerald R. Ford International Airport. The freeway continues to the east of the airport and then intersects the eastern end of M-6 (Paul B. Henry Freeway, South Beltline Freeway) at an interchange over the confluence of the Thornapple and Grand rivers.|$|E
5|$|Initially {{tuition at}} the school was free, funded by various endowments and rents {{obtained}} from lands the most significant arising from the Abolition of the Chantries Acts, and the re-appropriation of funds to the school. In 1944 under the Education Act education remained free, however the common entrance exam at eleven was introduced and the school became a selective grammar school. School fees were introduced in 1977 when the school withdrew from the maintained system and became independent. For the year 2013/2014 they are £14,670 (approximately €17,900 or US$24,500 as of March 2014) per year excluding lunches. All those wishing to be admitted now take the schools own internal 11+ entrance examination which tests English, mathematics and verbal reasoning and attend an interview with two members of staff. If a place is awarded, entry can de deferred for two years so that boys who are at prep school <b>may</b> <b>enter</b> at thirteen. Those entering at thirteen must take the 13+ Common Entrance or the scholarship examination to confirm their place.|$|E
5|$|There were 1480 {{schools in}} Sarawak in 2014, of which 1271 were primary, 202 were {{secondary}} and 7 were vocational/technical secondary schools. Among {{these are a}} number of schools that date from the Brooke era, including St. Thomas's School Kuching (1848), St Mary's School Kuching (1848), and St Joseph's School Kuching (1882). As well as government schools, there are four international schools: Tunku Putra School, a primary and secondary school offering national and Cambridge curricula, Lodge International School, which is also open to local students and uses both the British National and Cambridge systems, Kidurong International School, which is owned by Shell and offers primary education mainly to children of employees but local children <b>may</b> <b>enter</b> depending on space availability, and Tenby International School, which opened in 2014 and is open to both local and expatriate children. There are also 14 Chinese independent secondary schools in Sarawak that teach in Chinese rather than English or Malay. Previously, only Chinese students were enrolled in these schools, but mobility of the workforce has led to increasing turnover of students as parents move to other areas for employment. This has led to an increasing number of bumiputera students being enrolled in Chinese schools.|$|E
