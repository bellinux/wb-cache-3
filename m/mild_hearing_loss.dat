40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{introduce}} a new method of measuring sound localization ability based on eye-tracking and to test this method by analysing the influence of <b>mild</b> induced conductive <b>hearing</b> <b>loss</b> on sound localization. DESIGN: Sound signals were presented from different angles, and the participant's responses were measured using an eye-tracking device. For validation, a comparison of responses to visual stimuli was performed. To test the clinical application of this method, a <b>mild</b> conductive <b>hearing</b> <b>loss</b> was simulated, {{and the impact of}} this change on sound localization was measured.

A large number of trials could be completed fairly rapidly. Following the induced conductive <b>hearing</b> <b>loss,</b> a decline of 5. 5 ° in the accuracy of sound localization in the horizontal plane was found towards the side of the non-impaired ear for frontal presentations. CONCLUSIONS: Quantifying sound localization by eye-tracking was found to be feasible, fast and accurate.

In this validation study, we studied 361 survivors of childhood cancer from the Swiss Childhood Cancer Survivor Study (SCCSS) who had been diagnosed after 1989 and had been exposed to ototoxic cancer treatment. Questionnaire-reported hearing was compared to the information in medical records. <b>Hearing</b> <b>loss</b> was defined as ≥ grade 1 according to the SIOP Boston Ototoxicity Scale.
