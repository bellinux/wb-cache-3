Similarly, the perceived effectiveness {{of security}} measures is sometimes different from the actual security provided by those measures.

40|$|Managing and {{controlling}} wildlife species within Europe is an acknowledged part of conservation management, yet deciding and setting a population target {{in order to}} control a population is perceived to be conceptually very challenging. We interviewed stakeholders, within a variety of governmental and non-governmental organizations, to evaluate their perspectives about setting population targets as part of waterbird management for controlling population sizes. We conclude that the setting of a quantifiable population target is beneficial as a <b>measurable</b> <b>objective</b> for monitoring and evaluating management actions. However, it must be recognised as just one possible <b>measurable</b> <b>objective</b> and there may well be multiple supporting objectives that encapsulate the management aims of different stakeholders. When considering wide-scale control of waterbirds species, where it is likely that population size matters, any population target should be coupled to the issues being addressed. We highlight {{that it is important to}} actively engage with stakeholders as part of the decision-making process, not only to gain consensus but to share knowledge. A clear understanding of the context and the rationale for controlling a waterbird species is needed to align the interests of diverse stakeholders. The provision of scientific data and the continuous monitoring of management actions is viewed as beneficial and demanded by stakeholders, as part of any decision-making process when setting population targets. This facilitates effective evaluation of management actions, helping managers make wise decisions as well as enabling the continued development o...|$|R

Though common, this "matching" process leads to unstable preferences when perceived product ranks change due to product array manipulations. This article proposes that another variable, task difficulty, also leads to inconsistent choices through the matching process. Accuracy resulting from matching is also assessed by exploring domains where comparative standing is based on <b>measurable,</b> <b>objective</b> skill. The present studies show that people rely heavily on their relative self-assessments in product choice, but these estimates are often inaccurate and thus lead to unintended and inconsistent choices.

We introduce a <b>measurable,</b> <b>objective</b> foundation for comfort, which was previously assumed equivalent to the absence of discomfort, a subjective quantity. Interfaces designed outside a user’s comfort zone can prompt the adoption of alternative use patterns, which are often less favorable because they trade off the unnoticeable potential of injury for comfort. Designing interfaces within the limits of comfort zones can avert these risks...|$|R
