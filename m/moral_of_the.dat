25|$|The {{struggle}} with the world is framed {{by the idea that}} series of personal and social transformations can increase our share of attributes associated with the divine and give us a larger life. It emphasizes love over altruism, rejecting the <b>moral</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mastery of self-interest to enhance solidarity, and emphasizing the humility of individual love. This orientation has been articulated in two different voices: the sacred voice of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam, and the profane voice of the secular projects of liberation.|$|E
25|$|The {{battle of}} Hatvan {{was not a}} very {{important}} victory, but its influence on the <b>moral</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Hungarian troops was remarkable. The most important result of the battle was that Gáspár succeeded to make Schlik to think that he faced the whole Hungarian army, and not just its VIIth corps. Windisch-Grätz continued to be unsure about the plans and displacement of the Hungarian main army, and because of this he remained mostly incapable of stopping them to advance from two sides, towards his headquarters at Gödöllő. After the victory of Hatvan, the other, more numerous Hungarian army, consisting of three corps, won at Tápióbicske another victory, than neared to Isaszeg, where, on 6 April, the decisive battle of {{the first phase of the}} Spring Campaign took place.|$|E

25|$|The {{parable of}} the blind men and an {{elephant}} originated in ancient Indian subcontinent, from where it has widely diffused. It {{is a story of}} a group of blind men, who have never come across an elephant before, learn and conceptualize what the elephant is like by touching it. Each blind man feels {{a different part of the}} elephant body, but only one part, such as the side or the tusk. They then describe the elephant based on their partial experience and their descriptions are in complete disagreement on what an elephant is. In some versions they come to suspect that the other person is dishonest and they come to blows. The <b>moral</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> parable is that humans have a tendency to project their partial experiences as the whole truth, ignore other people's partial experiences, and one should consider that one may be partially right and may have partial information.|$|E
25|$|During {{her first}} term, Benazir Bhutto had {{strained}} {{relationship with the}} Pakistan Armed Forces, especially with Pakistan Army. Army chief Mirza Aslam Beg had cold relations with the elected prime minister, and continued to undermine her authority. As for the military appointments, Benazir Bhutto refused to appoint General Beg as the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee, instead invited Admiral Iftikhar Ahmed Sirohey to take {{the chairmanship of the}} Joint Chiefs of Staff. In 1988, Benazir Bhutto appointed Air Chief Marshal Hakimullah as the Chief of Air Staff and Admiral Jastural Haq as the Chief of Naval Staff. In 1988, shortly after assuming the office, Benazir Bhutto paid a visit to Siachen region, to boost the <b>moral</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> soldiers who fought the Siachen war with India. This was the first visit of any civilian leader to any military war-zone area since the country's independence in 1947. In 1988, Benazir appointed Major-General Pervez Musharraf as Director-General of the Army Directorate General for Military Operations (DGMO); and then-Brigadier-General Ashfaq Parvez Kayani as her Military-Secretary. In 1989, the Pakistan Army exposed the alleged Operation Midnight Jackal against the government of Benazir Bhutto. When she learned the news, Benazir Bhutto ordered the arrest and trial of former ISI officer Brigadier Imtiaz Ahmad and Major Amir Khan, it was later revealed that it was General Beg who was behind this plot. General Beg soon paid the price in 1993 elections, when Benazir Bhutto politically destroyed the former general and his career was over before taking any shifts in politics. During her first term, Benazir Bhutto had successfully removed senior military officers including Lieutenant-Generals Hamid Gul, Zahid Ali Akbar Khan, General Jamal A. Khan, and Admiral Tariq Kamal Khan, all of whom had anti-democratic views and were closely aligned to General Zia, replacing them with officers who were educated in Western military institutes and academies, generally the ones with more westernised democratic views.|$|E

500|$|Psychologists Gilbert Reyes and Gerard Jacobs {{have cited}} [...] "Starvin' Marvin" [...] as {{one example of}} popular culture voicing criticisms of humanitarianism [...] "as an overblown {{industry}} leeching off others' suffering and harming its purported beneficiaries".

500|$|Food critic Katharine Shilcutt of the Houston Press {{criticized the}} episode for giving {{what she thought}} was an {{inaccurate}} depiction of foodies, as people that are [...] "tacky, snotty, slightly racist, hoarders of food experiences that you gather like rare gems and patronizingly hold over other people's heads." [...] Shilcutt added that she found it upsetting that what she believes to be the <b>moral</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> episode is that [...] "Educated, passionate people are elitists. It reduces all the hard work that people put into creating good, honest food into a joke, and not a terribly funny one. There was no balance in the episode between smug, arrogant, obnoxious foodies and those who have a genuine, guileless interest in food and all its important permutations in our lives." ...|$|E

500|$|During the {{original}} broadcast of [...] "201" [...] on April 21, 2010, all references to Muhammad's name were obscured by audio bleeps.

500|$|Andrew Tran of {{the website}} Overmental, {{on the other}} hand, reacted more {{positively}} to the episode. He felt that both King Huge and Seven were representative of a stagnation in mindset; according to him, they are both stuck in their ways and unwilling to change. However, {{he notes that the}} two also differ substantially. Tran argues that King Huge has legions of slaves feeding him the richest of foods. He is comfortable, but unaccustomed to dealing with outsiders, which expresses itself as xenophobia. Seven, on the other hand, lives in abject poverty, and is much more welcoming of strangers. In the end, Seven escapes the episode unscathed, and according to Tran, the <b>moral</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> episode is that [...] "the bright side of a crap situation is that [...] pushes rather than restricts, enriches rather than fattens." ...|$|E
500|$|Tom Carson, {{television}} {{critic for}} The Village Voice, praised the episode, {{which he said}} [...] "featured some amazing sick jokes about American affluence and obliviousness".

500|$|Within {{a couple}} of hours, Michael Jensen of the gay website AfterElton.com took note of Murphy's statement, and also of the then-current cover article on Criss in Out magazine, in which Murphy was quoted as saying, [...] "Blaine will openly {{question}} whether bisexuality is real. I think that some people will love that discussion and some will not love it." [...] Jensen pointed out that Murphy does not say that Blaine will not question his own sexuality, but clearly [...] "decides he is, in fact, gay". Ausiello posted at about that time that Blaine was indeed who {{he was referring to}} in his original story, quoted from the same Out article as Jensen, and added a new one-sentence summation from Murphy on the coming episode: [...] "I guess the <b>moral</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> story is don’t play spin the bottle while drunk on wine coolers." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{her essay}} [...] "Thoroughly Post-Victorian, Pre-Modern Beatrix" [...] {{professor}} of English Katherine Chandler {{points out that}} Potter, unlike most Victorian writers of children's books, wrote original stories based on the realism of animal behaviour. Chandler notes that Potter avoids moralizing in her tales, making Miss Moppet {{nothing more than a}} story describing the natural behaviour of kittens. Potter's anthropomorphized animals are in fact slightly naughty, yet in their naughtiness the punishment is never the <b>moral</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tale. At the end of Miss Moppet, the kitten is not punished and the mouse dances on the cupboard. This leads Chandler to quote literary scholar of modernism Humphrey Carpenter, [...] "there is nothing in [...] work that resembles the moral tale. In fact if might be argued that she is writing something pretty close to a series of immoral tales". In addition Chandler notes that Potter's economic use of prose presages modernism, comparing her writing to that of Ernest Hemingway.|$|E
500|$|Largely silent until then, in 1904 both Seton and Roberts made small {{efforts to}} defend their brand of nature writing from its critics, mainly Burroughs. In the preface to his new book The Watchers of the Trails, Roberts {{specifically}} responded to Burroughs' criticism by carefully pointing out that his stories were [...] "avowedly fiction". However, he continued: [...] "They are, at the same time, true, in that the material {{of which they are}} moulded consists of facts". Later that year, Century Magazine published Seton's only public response to Burroughs' criticisms, especially those made in the previous year's Atlantic Monthly article in which the naturalist branded Seton the originator of the faulty genre. Seton's response was {{in the form of a}} lighthearted tale about a critic named Little Mucky—obviously meant to parody Burroughs himself—who climbs a hill called Big Periodic, only to throw mud at a newcomer who attracts attention away from him. The <b>moral</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> story, Seton wrote, was that [...] "Notoriety is a poisonous substitute for fame." ...|$|E

500|$|Several reviewers have {{commented on}} {{themes of the}} episode; topics of {{discussion}} included the relationship between parents and children, class relations, the scene in which Logan attacks the perpetrator in Veronica's sex tape case, and the final scene {{in relation to the}} overall <b>moral</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> series. According to Rowan Kaiser of The A.V. Club, the episode contained a role reversal between Veronica and Keith, with Keith violating the law. He noted the scene in which Keith erases the surveillance tapes of Veronica as illustrating the theme that [...] "the two aren't so different after all." [...] Roger Holland of PopMatters thought that the episode demonstrated that Veronica and Keith's relationship was the central component of the show: [...] "it was all about Veronica and Keith. And beyond that, about parents, children, and the myriad ways they can fuck each other up." [...] Stephanie Zacharek, writing for Salon, thought that the final scenes of [...] "The Bitch Is Back" [...] "cement the dour reality, posited {{at the very beginning of}} the series, that the rich ... are always going to be the ones in charge." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{overcoming}} {{of greed}} and selfishness {{has been seen}} as the central <b>moral</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> story. Whilst greed is a recurring theme in the novel, with many of the episodes stemming from {{one or more of the}} characters' simple desire for food (be it trolls eating dwarves or dwarves eating Wood-elf fare) or a desire for beautiful objects, such as gold and jewels, it is only by the Arkenstone's influence upon Thorin that greed, and its attendant vices [...] "coveting" [...] and [...] "malignancy", come fully to the fore in the story and provide the moral crux of the tale. Bilbo steals the Arkenstone—a most ancient relic of the dwarves—and attempts to ransom it to Thorin for peace. However, Thorin turns on the Hobbit as a traitor, disregarding all the promises and [...] "at your services" [...] he had previously bestowed. In the end Bilbo gives up the precious stone and most of his share of the treasure to help those in greater need. Tolkien also explores the motif of jewels that inspire intense greed that corrupts those who covet them in the Silmarillion, and there are connections between the words [...] "Arkenstone" [...] and [...] "Silmaril" [...] in Tolkien's invented etymologies.|$|E
500|$|In September 2014, Chris was {{the focus}} of a coward punch storyline. During Kyle and Georgia's joint bucks and hen night, Chris was forced to eject a drunk Josh Willis (Harley Bonner) from The Waterhole when he caused a scene. Shortly after, Josh {{returned}} and hit Chris with a coward punch, causing him to fall and hit his head on a rock. Kyle and Georgia found Chris unconscious and he was rushed to hospital in a critical condition. Mason was pleased to be given the storyline, explaining that it was a topical issue in Australia at the time. He said [...] "The whole <b>moral</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> story is that one little mistake can have really dire consequences. I like to think that we can use this story to really educate people and get the word out there that this is something really serious that we're battling against at the moment." [...] Mason thought that Chris might be able to forgive Josh in the future, but it would be [...] "a long process", and he would {{have to deal with the}} fact that his life had changed forever due to the attack first.
