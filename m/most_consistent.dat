5|$|The {{period before}} and after the First World War was Bolton's <b>most</b> <b>consistent</b> period of top-flight success as {{measured}} by league finishes, with the club finishing outside the top 8 of the First Division on only two occasions between 1911–12 and 1927–28. In this period Bolton equalled their record finish of third twice, in 1920–21 and 1924–25, on the latter occasion missing out on the title by just 3 points (in an era of 2 points for a win).|$|E
5|$|The size of {{the brain}} and a person's {{intelligence}} are not strongly related. Studies tend to indicate small to moderate correlations (averaging around 0.3 to 0.4) between brain volume and IQ. The <b>most</b> <b>consistent</b> associations are observed within the frontal, temporal, and parietal lobes, the hippocampi, and the cerebellum, but these only account for a relatively small amount of variance in IQ, which itself has only a partial relationship to general intelligence and real-world performance.|$|E

5|$|A {{graduate}} of Jackson State University, {{he was a}} teammate of Walter Payton. Drafted {{in the third round}} of the 1976 NFL Draft, Slater seldom played his first few years before starting in 1979. Known as the <b>most</b> <b>consistent</b> member {{of one of the most}} potent offensive lines in NFL history, Slater was selected to seven Pro Bowls and broke a record for most seasons with one team. His jersey number was retired, and he was inducted to the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2001.|$|E
5|$|Because of the {{economic}} background, large-scale systems are presently distributed where the support regimes have been the <b>most</b> <b>consistent,</b> or the most advantageous. Total capacity of worldwide PV plants above 4 MWAC was assessed by Wiki-Solar as 36 GW in c. 2,300 installations {{at the end of}} 2014 and represents about 25 percent of total global PV capacity of 139GW. The countries which had the most capacity, in descending order, were the United States, China, Germany, India, United Kingdom, Spain, Italy, Canada and South Africa. Activities in the key markets are reviewed individually below.|$|E
5|$|In his prime, Iginla was {{considered}} {{to be one of the}} NHL's most prominent power forwards. Upon entering the league, he tried to emulate players like Brendan Shanahan and Keith Tkachuk, hoping to match their combination of finesse and physicality. He is one of the <b>most</b> <b>consistent</b> scorers in the league; between 1998 and 2008, only Jaromír Jágr scored more NHL goals than Iginla. Even so, scouting reports have argued that Iginla's lack of speed makes it easier for opponents to isolate him and restrict his ability to move if his teammates rely on him too much to lead the offence.|$|E

5|$|Kitayama and Karasawa {{concluded}} that the patterns in the findings from both experiments were <b>most</b> <b>consistent</b> with {{the hypothesis that the}} preference is due to an attachment to the self. These feelings leak out to stimuli that are closely associated with the self, not just names and birthdates, but also, implicitly, their constituent letters and numbers. The researchers suggested that the effect is stronger for higher numbers because in daily life these numbers are less saturated with other meanings, other than their associations with birthdays.|$|E
5|$|Strong overall {{favorite}} Alberto Contador was the race's original winner, in what constituted {{his second}} Giro championship.

In the other sub-classifications, Stefano Garzelli won the mountains competition and Roman Kreuziger finished as the best rider aged 25 or under in the general classification; he finished the race fifth overall.|$|E
5|$|The Limousin breed {{was also}} not immune to the wave of Anglomania {{affecting}} France {{in the middle of}} the 19th century. Some wealthy farmers maintained Durham cattle, which were prized by the elite of the time. However, this practice was criticised by the agricultural society of Limoges. The society encouraged farmers to continue selecting animals that were <b>most</b> <b>consistent</b> with the characteristics of the Limousin breed, which was perfectly adapted to the region's environment, rather than trying to adapt other breeds. Furthermore, the vast majority of Limousin breeders could not afford to raise livestock in addition to their working animals, as was the case on larger properties that practiced crossing with Durham cattle.|$|E

5|$|There was no autopsy, and {{the cause}} of Lambert's death is unknown. While many sources say that he died of a fatty {{degeneration}} of the heart or of stress on his heart caused by his bulk, his behaviour in the period leading to his death does not match that of someone suffering from cardiac insufficiency; witnesses agree that on the morning of his death he appeared well, before he became short of breath and collapsed. Bondeson(2006) speculates that the <b>most</b> <b>consistent</b> explanation of his death, given his symptoms and medical history, is that he had a sudden pulmonary embolism.|$|E
5|$|West {{has been}} {{mentioned}} in several polls of MLB players. In 2006, the spring after he was crew chief in the World Series, a Sports Illustrated survey asked 470 MLB players to identify {{the best and worst}} umpires. West was identified as the best MLB umpire by 2 percent of those players, ranking him ninth on that list. With respect to the worst umpire, 6 percent of players in the survey selected West. Only three umpires were named more frequently as worst umpire in the survey. A 2007 review of umpire strike zones by The Hardball Times determined that West was the <b>most</b> <b>consistent</b> umpire in the major leagues.|$|E
5|$|During the 1900 English cricket season, Ollivierre {{travelled}} to England with a West Indian team. Invited to tour England by Lord Hawke {{following the}} success of English tours to the Caribbean, the team was the first from the West Indies to visit England, and matches were not first-class. The team improved steadily throughout, {{and by the end}} of the tour were judged to be playing well. Although predominantly made up from white players, the team contained several black cricketers; at the time, the dominant teams in the West Indies were exclusively white. Ollivierre was the <b>most</b> <b>consistent</b> and successful batsman in the team, scoring 883 runs at a batting average of 32. His highest score, and only century, came against Leicestershire, when he scored 159 runs and shared an opening partnership of 238 with Pelham Warner. He also shared an opening partnership of 208 with Percy Cox against Surrey. He bowled occasionally in the early part of the tour, although with little success, but did not bowl at all in his last eight games.|$|E

5|$|Fast {{scored three}} goals during the Rangers' 2014 preseason, {{including}} a game-tying goal in a September 22 {{loss to the}} New Jersey Devils, and two goals in a 6–3 victory over Philadelphia on September 28. For the second consecutive year, he made the Rangers roster out of training camp, with Vigneault calling {{him one of the}} <b>most</b> <b>consistent</b> players throughout the camp. But he again struggled once the regular season began, and on October 17 was sent back to the Hartford Wolf Pack, along with J. T. Miller. Fast had nine points (one goal, eight assists) over the next 11 matches for Hartford, including two 2-assist games on October 24, and November 8, notching his sole goal in a 4–3 win over the Worcester Sharks on November 2. He was recalled by the Rangers on November 10.|$|E
5|$|Granderson and Daniel Murphy {{were the}} two most {{productive}} hitters in the Mets lineup during their 2015 postseason run to the World Series. While Murphy cooled off in the World Series against the Kansas City Royals, Granderson {{continued to be a}} consistent threat for the Mets out of the leadoff spot and also had three home runs and five RBIs in that World Series. In Game 1, after the Royals tied the game in the ninth inning with a home run off Mets closer Jeurys Familia, Granderson made an excellent leaping catch with nobody out {{in the bottom of the}} 11th inning, off the bat of the Royals fastest runner Jarrod Dyson, preventing what would have at least been a lead off triple and likely saving the game at the time, though the Royals would go on to win the game anyway in the bottom of the 14th inning on a sacrifice fly by Eric Hosmer. Throughout the series, playing right field, Granderson played the <b>most</b> <b>consistent</b> and solid defense of any Mets fielder.|$|E
5|$|In Bournemouth's first {{match of}} 2014–15, a 4–0 away win over Huddersfield on 9 August 2014, Pugh opened the scoring after only 26 seconds with a {{composed}} finish from Matt Ritchie's cross. On 25 October 2014, Pugh played as Bournemouth beat Birmingham City 8–0 away {{to set a}} club record win, in which he scored the first hat-trick {{of his career in}} the second half. Pugh and full-back Charlie Daniels formed a partnership on the left-hand side of the pitch during 2014–15, the duo starting all matches but one of a 14-match unbeaten run for Bournemouth. He scored the first goal in a 3–0 win over Bolton Wanderers on 27 April 2015 with a left-footed shot into the top corner; this result all but sealed Bournemouth's promotion into the Premier League. He played in a 3–0 away win against Charlton on 2 May 2015, which confirmed promotion and, thanks to Watford drawing their last match, the Championship title. This was the first time Bournemouth had been promoted into the top flight in the club's 125-year history. Pugh was one of Bournemouth's <b>most</b> <b>consistent</b> players in 2014–15, and contributed with 9 goals from 44 matches.|$|E

5|$|Specific {{genes that}} have been linked with MS include {{differences}} in the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) system—a group of genes on chromosome 6 {{that serves as the}} major histocompatibility complex (MHC). That changes in the HLA region are related to susceptibility has been known since the 1980s, and additionally this same region has been implicated in the development of other autoimmune diseases such as diabetes type I and systemic lupus erythematosus. The <b>most</b> <b>consistent</b> finding is the association between multiple sclerosis and alleles of the MHC defined as DR15 and DQ6. Other loci have shown a protective effect, such as HLA-C554 and HLA-DRB1*11. Overall, {{it has been estimated that}} HLA changes account for between 20 and 60% of the genetic predisposition. Modern genetic methods (genome-wide association studies) have discovered at least twelve other genes outside the HLA locus that modestly increase the probability of MS.|$|E
5|$|Standing at 6 feet 11 {{inches tall}} (2.11 m) and {{weighing}} 250 pounds (113kg), Duncan was a power forward who could also play center. With a double-double career average in points and rebounds, {{he was considered}} one of the <b>most</b> <b>consistent</b> players in the NBA throughout his career. Regarded as one of the league's best interior defenders, Duncan also ranked consistently {{as one of the top}} scorers, rebounders and shot-blockers in the league. At the end of his final season in 2015–16, he was ranked first in regular season point-rebound double-doubles among active players, while he led the charts in post-season point-rebound double-doubles (158 as of 2013–14). His main weakness for much of his career was his free throw shooting, with a career average of less than 70%.|$|E
5|$|Symbolism is used {{heavily in}} Blue Velvet. The <b>most</b> <b>consistent</b> {{symbolism}} {{in the film}} is an insect motif introduced {{at the end of}} the first scene, when the camera zooms in on a well-kept suburban lawn until it unearths a swarming underground nest of disgusting bugs. This is generally recognized as a metaphor for the seedy underworld that Jeffrey will soon discover under the surface of his own suburban, Reaganesque paradise. The severed ear he finds is being overrun by black ants. The bug motif is recurrent throughout the film, most notably in the bug-like gas mask that Frank wears, but also the excuse that Jeffrey uses to gain access to Dorothy's apartment: he claims to be an insect exterminator. One of Frank's sinister accomplices is also consistently identified through the yellow jacket he wears, possibly reminiscent of the name of a type of wasp. Finally, a robin eating a bug on a fence becomes a topic of discussion in the last scene of the film. The robin, mentioned earlier by Sandy when she recounted her dream, represents love conquering evil.|$|E
