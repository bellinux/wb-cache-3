5|$|A motto, {{placed on}} a scroll below the Royal Arms of England, seems to have first been adopted by Henry IV in the early 15th century. His motto was Souverayne ("sovereign"). His son, Henry V adopted the motto Dieu et mon droit ("God and my right"). While this motto has been {{exclusively}} used since the accession of George I in 1714, and continues to form part of the Royal Arms of the United Kingdom, other mottoes were used by certain monarchs in the intervening period. Veritas temporis filia ("truth {{is the daughter of}} time") was the <b>motto</b> <b>of</b> Mary I (1553–1558), Semper Eadem ("always the same") was used by Elizabeth I (1558–1603) and Anne (1702–1714), James I (1603–1625) sometimes used Beati pacifici ("blessed are the peacemakers"), while William III (1689–1702) used the <b>motto</b> <b>of</b> the House of Orange: Je maintiendrai ("I will maintain").|$|E

5|$|Initially {{the film}} was to be {{released}} in 2000, rumoured to be titled Bond 2000. Other rumoured titles included Death Waits for No Man, Fire and Ice, Pressure Point and Dangerously Yours. The title The World Is Not Enough is an English translation of the Latin phrase Orbis non sufficit, which in real life was the <b>motto</b> <b>of</b> Sir Thomas Bond. In the novel On Her Majesty's Secret Service and its film adaptation, this is revealed to be the Bond family motto. The phrase originates from the epitaph of Alexander the Great.|$|E

The Rover {{programme}} focuses on their <b>motto</b> <b>of</b> 'Service', which has 3 aspects - service to the community, service to the Scout Movement and service to oneself. Rovers are not necessarily adult leaders of Scout Troops, although there is often some overlap. The Rover section has historically been open to young men and women, even prior to Cubbing and Scouting being opened to girls.|$|E

5|$|The {{title of}} the episode is the <b>motto</b> <b>of</b> House Targaryen, and alludes to the {{aftermath}} of the previous episode's climactic events. The episode's action revolves around the Starks' reactions to Eddard Stark's execution: Sansa is taken hostage, Arya flees in disguise, Robb and Catelyn lead an army against the Lannisters, and Jon Snow struggles with his divided loyalty. Across the narrow sea, Daenerys must deal with the blood magic that has robbed her of her husband, her son and her army.|$|E
5|$|There were {{numerous}} types of belts produced for the Confederate Military during the Civil War. There were literally dozens {{of types of}} buckles used and produced by or for the Confederacy. The buckles ranged from single plates with hooks, to two piece interlocking buckles, to simple roller buckles and countless other variations. Many buckles use plates that bore the state seal or <b>motto</b> <b>of</b> their home states. The vast majority used simple roller buckle plates of the type found on a common dog collar. As the War progressed, more and more men used captured US belt plates, often wearing them upside down.|$|E
5|$|It took until 1994 for the Queen {{to approve}} the new design for general use, though the Canadian Heraldic Authority began to allow for its limited use {{beginning}} in 1987, where the arms were used to represent the Queen personally on letters patent granting new arms for distinguished Canadians. These letters patent carried the shield from the royal arms along with the annulus behind the shield bearing the <b>motto</b> <b>of</b> the Order of Canada—Desiderantes meliorem patriam. As soon as royal approval was forthcoming, the full achievement was redesigned {{for use by the}} federal government within the Federal Identity Program. The present design of the arms of Canada was drawn by Cathy Bursey-Sabourin, Fraser Herald at the Canadian Heraldic Authority.|$|E
50|$|In {{less than}} a year, the city was cleared of debris. Keen {{to have a new}} and {{perfectly}} ordered city, the king commissioned the construction of big squares, rectilinear, large avenues and widened streets - the new <b>mottos</b> <b>of</b> Lisbon.|$|R

5|$|By 1957, {{the arms}} were redrawn by Alan Beddoe {{so as to}} have red leaves and to change the royal crown from one of a Tudor design to one more {{resembling}} St. Edward's Crown, as preferred by Queen Elizabeth II. To mark the 1982 patriation of the Canadian constitution, which finally ended {{the last vestiges of}} British authority over Canada, a McGill University student named Bruce Hicks proposed to Secretary of State Gerald Regan that the <b>motto</b> <b>of</b> the Order of Canada be placed around the shield in order to bring these royal arms into line with other royal arms, many of which have been displayed in Canada during French, Scottish, and English colonisation, where those countries' highest national order of honour appears around the shield of the arms (the British arms displayed the Order of the Garter), the Scottish royal arms the Order of the Thistle, and the royalist arms of the French Regime the Order of the Holy Spirit and Order of Saint Michael). While unsuccessful in this first attempt, Hicks continued his campaign and was joined by a number of other amateur and professional heraldists. As a journalist in the parliamentary press gallery in Ottawa in the late 1980s and early 90s, Hicks strategically recast the change as something worth doing to commemorate the 25th Anniversary of the Order of Canada in 1992, an idea that was endorsed by the Advisory Committee on the Order of Canada.|$|E

25|$|The {{addition}} by King Charles of Nemo me impune lacessit {{ensured that}} the blazon of his Royal arms used in Scotland complemented that of his Royal arms used elsewhere, in that two mottoes were displayed. The blazon used elsewhere had included the French <b>motto</b> <b>of</b> the arms, Dieu et mon droit, together with the Old French <b>motto</b> <b>of</b> the Order of the Garter, the highest Chivalric order of the Kingdom of England. The <b>motto</b> <b>of</b> the Order of the Garter, Honi soit qui mal y pense, appears on {{a representation of the}} garter surrounding the shield. Henceforth, the versions of the Royal arms used in Scotland and elsewhere were to include both the <b>motto</b> <b>of</b> the arms of the respective kingdom and the <b>motto</b> <b>of</b> the associated order of chivalry.|$|E
50|$|The Royal {{coat of arms}} of the United Kingdom still {{features}} in French the <b>mottos</b> <b>of</b> both the British Monarch, Dieu et mon droit ("God and my right") and the Order of the Garter, Honi soit qui mal y pense ("Shamed be he who thinks evil of it").|$|R
50|$|Versions of {{this phrase}} are the {{national}} <b>mottos</b> <b>of</b> Belgium, Bulgaria, and Haiti, {{and also the}} historical South African Republic and Federation of Malaya. There is a popular legend in Bulgaria about Kubrat, ruler of Great Bulgaria, who also gave his sons the same advice by the same example.|$|R

25|$|Adopted {{during the}} reign of the Stewart dynasty, and {{certainly}} in use by the reign of James IV (1488–1513), Appearing beneath the shield may have led to the conclusion that Nemo me impune lacessit is the <b>motto</b> <b>of</b> the Royal arms, whereas historical evidence coupled with the conventions of heraldry in Scotland would suggest that In my defens God me defend is the <b>motto</b> <b>of</b> the Royal arms and therefore the <b>motto</b> <b>of</b> Scotland itself.|$|E
25|$|The coat {{features}} {{both the}} <b>motto</b> <b>of</b> English monarchs, Dieu et mon droit (God and my right), and the <b>motto</b> <b>of</b> the Order of the Garter, Honi soit qui mal y pense (Shamed be he who thinks ill of it) on {{a representation of}} the Garter behind the shield.|$|E
