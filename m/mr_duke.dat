25|$|On 18 April 1806, Captain John Ayscough assumed {{command of}} Success. Early on 20 November 1806, while {{just east of}} Guantánamo Bay (known as Cumberland Harbour to the British), Ayscough {{observed}} a felucca running into Hidden Port. He sent the ship's barge and yawl in pursuit, but on reaching the shore they discovered that about 50 armed men had landed from the felucca, which was lashed to a tree, and had taken a position {{at the top of}} a small hill overlooking the beach, upon which they had mounted a single long gun. They fired grape and ball down on the British, killing the First Lieutenant, <b>Mr.</b> <b>Duke,</b> with their first volley. The British withstood the enemy fire for an hour and twenty minutes, suffering seven more men wounded, and having the barge shot through in several places before Lieutenant Spence, then in command, deemed any attempt on the hill a useless sacrifice, so ordered the enemy ship to be towed out, which was achieved under heavy fire. She proved to be the French privateer Vengeur, which had sailed from Santo Domingo on 1 October, but being badly damaged she sank while under tow.|$|E

6000|$|<b>Mr.</b> <b>Duke</b> turned rather yellow, {{which was}} his way of blushing, and Mr. Ely came to his relief by observing,--'They're making a very good piece of work of Shepperton Church. Dolby, the architect, who has it in hand, is a very clever fellow.' ...|$|E
6000|$|Mr. Ely gave {{these words}} dramatically, imitating the Rev. Amos's fervour and {{symbolic}} action, {{and every one}} laughed except <b>Mr.</b> <b>Duke,</b> whose after-dinner view of things was not apt to be jovial. He said,--'I think some of us ought to remonstrate with Mr. Barton on the scandal he is causing. He is not only imperilling his own soul, but the souls of his flock.' ...|$|E

60|$|I {{dare say}} the long {{residence}} of the Countess Czerlaski at Shepperton Vicarage is very puzzling to you also, dear reader, {{as well as to}} Mr. Barton's clerical brethren; the more so, as I hope you are not in the least inclined to put that very evil interpretation on it which evidently found acceptance with the sallow and dyspeptic <b>Mr.</b> <b>Duke,</b> and with the florid and highly peptic Mr. Fellowes. You have seen enough, I trust, of the Rev. Amos Barton, to be convinced that he was more apt to fall into a blunder than into a sin--more apt to be deceived than to incur a necessity for being deceitful: {{and if you have a}} keen eye for physiognomy, you will have detected that the Countess Czerlaski loved herself far too well to get entangled in an unprofitable vice.|$|E
60|$|At Mr. Ely's {{right hand}} {{you see a}} very small man with a sallow and {{somewhat}} puffy face, whose hair is brushed straight up, evidently {{with the intention of}} giving him a height somewhat less disproportionate to his sense of his own importance than the measure of five feet three accorded him by an oversight of nature. This is Rev. Archibald Duke, a very dyspeptic and evangelical man, who takes the gloomiest view of mankind and their prospects, and thinks the immense sale of the 'Pickwick Papers,' recently completed, one of the strongest proofs of original sin. Unfortunately, though <b>Mr.</b> <b>Duke</b> was not burdened with a family, his yearly expenditure was apt considerably to exceed his income; and the unpleasant circumstances resulting from this, together with heavy meat-breakfasts, may probably have contributed to his desponding views of the world generally.|$|E
