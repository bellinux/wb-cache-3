"So Little Chief {{made his}} home in the rock-slide high up on the {{mountain}} and was happy, for it was just as he thought it would be--no one thought of looking in that bare place for him. For food he ate the <b>pea</b> <b>vines</b> and grasses and other green things that grew just {{at the edge of the}} rock-slide and was perfectly happy. One day he decided he would take some of his dinner into his little cave and eat it there. So he cut a little bundle of <b>pea</b> <b>vine</b> and other green things. He left his little bundle on a flat rock in the sun while he went to look for something else and then forgot all about it. It didn't enter his head again until a few days later he happened along by that flat rock and discovered that little bundle. The <b>pea</b> <b>vines</b> and grasses were quite dry, just like the hay Farmer Brown's boy helps his father store away in the barn every summer.|$|R

Thirty-nine percent to 86 % of alfalfa (M. scutellata) and 10 % to 55 % of red clover (T. pratense) plants survived inoculation with the nematode populations at a greenhouse temperature of 24 ± 3 °C. All plants of the other legume species survived all nematode populations, except 4 % of the white clover (T. repens) plants inoculated with the California M. hapla population. Entries were usually more susceptible to the M. hapla populations than to M. chitwoodi. Galling of host roots differed between nematode populations and species. Root-galling indices (1 = none, 6 = severely galled) ranged from 1 on <b>pea</b> <b>vine</b> inoculated with the California population of M. hapla to 6 on yellow sweet clover inoculated with the Wyoming population of M. hapla.
