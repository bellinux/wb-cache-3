40|$|A weekly planner {{allows you}} {{to keep track of}} your {{different}} responsibilities, and schedule your time appropriately to meet those responsibilities, including your study. It {{is important to remember that}} most of the time that you will require for your university studies will occur outside of lectures and tutorials. Follow these steps to use your weekly planner effectively: 1. Think about all of the different things that require your time or attention during a week such as: for these activities, taking into account travel time, how long it takes to get ready and so on. For example: • You know that it takes 30 minutes to travel to uni. <b>Make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>you</b> <b>include</b> this time allowance in your planner. • Your child has a 60 minute swimming lesson and you know it takes 20 minutes to get there, 20 minutes to get home and at least 10 minutes either side to get them ready and then course. Some units or courses demand more time than others. 4. Work out when you study best during the day and the week. This is when you should tackle your more demanding units, assignments, practice etc. Identify other times that are good for less challenging activities like going to the library to find books and journals, photocopying etc. Schedule these activities into your weekly planner so that you can clearly see what time is allocated to what study task. 5.
