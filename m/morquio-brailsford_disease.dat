40|$|<b>Morquio-Brailsford</b> <b>disease</b> {{is a rare}} genetic {{disorder}} of mucopolysaccharide metabolism, and its features include dwarfism and thoracic deformity. A boy aged 15 with this condition developed respiratory failure and later died. This boy and his two affected female siblings were studied {{and the results are}} presented. The height of the lungs was less than the anteroposterior diameter on standard chest radiographs. All had small lungs without evidence of airways obstruction. Measure-ments of dependent airway closure were made in the erect and supine positions. These showed some abnormalities which could cause ventilation-perfusion imbalance. Possible mechanisms leading to the development of respiratory failure in this condition are discussed, including naso-pharyngeal obstruction, thoracic deformity, and disturbed ventilation-perfusion relationships. The importance of respiratory failure as a cause of death in Morquio's disease is emphasized. Cases of this rare {{genetic disorder}} were described independently by Morquio (1929) and Brailsford (1929). The disease has now been classified as a disorder of mucopolysaccharide metabolism and is inherited as an autosomal recessive. The geneti...|$|E
