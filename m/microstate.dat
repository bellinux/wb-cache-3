Fearing that the agent will alert the world to their existence, he initiates plans for a war economy and decides to question Silvia in her hospital room. Their dialogue reveals the story of his escape during the collapse of governments and the establishment of the <b>microstate.</b> He was damaged and in transport for repairs when the anarchist revolution began 200 years prior, allowing him to survive in hiding. Enraged by his calm indifference to the prospect of war, Silvia attacks him and attempts her escape, but is restrained by guards.|$|E
5|$|The <b>microstate</b> of San Marino, in the {{northern}} Italian Peninsula and fully surrounded by Italy, had played little role throughout the Second World War. It had a fascist government, closely aligned with Benito Mussolini's regime, but remained neutral. It {{was reported to have}} declared war against the United Kingdom in September 1940, though the Sammarinese government later transmitted a message to the British government stating that it had not. In early 1942, the Sammarinese government reiterated it was not at war with the United States, a position that was confirmed by the US State Department. The British Foreign Office noted more equivocally in 1944 that Britain had never declared war, but also had never formally recognised San Marino's neutrality, and that it felt that military action on Sammarinese territory would be justified if it were being used by Axis forces.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the empirical link between fiscal {{policy and the}} current account focusing on <b>microstates</b> defined as countries {{with a population of}} less than 2 million between 1970 and 2009. The paper employs panel regression and panel vector autoregression (VAR) on 155 countries of which 42 are <b>microstates.</b> Panel regression results show that a percentage point improvement in the fiscal balance improves the current account balance by 0. 4 percentage points of GDP. The real effective exchange rate has no significant impact on the current account in <b>microstates</b> but the coefficient is significant in the global sample. Panel VAR results show that an increase in government consumption results in real exchange appreciation but the effect on the current account after an initial deterioration dies out quicker in <b>microstates</b> than in the global sample. The result implies that fiscal policy has little effect on the current account in <b>microstates</b> beyond its direct impact on imports. Overall, the results suggest that the weak relative price effects make the effect of fiscal adjustment on the current account much more difficult in <b>microstates...</b>|$|R
5000|$|In a study {{conducted}} by researchers in Geneva, the temporal dynamics and possible fractal properties of EEG <b>microstates</b> were analyzed in normal human subjects. Since <b>microstates</b> are a global topography, but occur on such small time scales and change so rapidly, Van De Ville, Britz, and Michel hypothesized that these [...] "atoms of thoughts" [...] are fractal-like in the temporal dimension. That is, whether scaled up or scaled down, an EEG is itself a composition of <b>microstates.</b> This hypothesis was initially illuminated by the strong correlation between the rapid time scale and transience of EEG <b>microstates</b> and the much slower signals of a resting state fMRI.|$|R

25|$|Even when {{a system}} is entirely {{isolated}} from external influences, its <b>microstate</b> is constantly changing. For instance, the particles in a gas are constantly moving, and thus occupy a different position at each moment of time; their momenta are also constantly changing as they collide with each other or with the container walls. Suppose we prepare the system in an artificially highly ordered equilibrium state. For instance, imagine dividing a container with a partition and placing a gas {{on one side of}} the partition, with a vacuum on the other side. If we remove the partition and watch the subsequent behavior of the gas, we will find that its <b>microstate</b> evolves according to some chaotic and unpredictable pattern, and that on average these microstates will correspond to a more disordered macrostate than before. It is possible, but extremely unlikely, for the gas molecules to bounce off one another in such a way that they remain in one half of the container. It is overwhelmingly probable for the gas to spread out to fill the container evenly, which is the new equilibrium macrostate of the system.|$|E

Though loyal to his leader, Green nonetheless draws Bors' distrust as the robot's paranoia steadily grows.|$|E

The method is applied to polyimide and polycarbonate systems. It is shown that individual <b>microstates</b> can yield a wide range of predicted elastic properties, whereas the consideration of multiple <b>microstates</b> yield predicted properties that more-closely agree with experimentally-determined values of Young’s modulus.
