25|$|The {{main goal}} of the {{strategy}} {{is to increase the}} <b>modal</b> <b>share</b> of the bicycle to 50% of commuter trips, and make Copenhagen the best cycling city in the world. The city has used the biennial bicycle accounts to identify key problems {{that need to be addressed}} in order to increase the <b>modal</b> <b>share,</b> and plans employing a number of tools to reach its target. These include widening cycle tracks to 3 lanes to allow for conversational cycling and increase the sense of safety on the cycle tracks, while at the same time allowing for higher speeds among commuters. The city further plans to decrease travel times by expanding the use of green waves adjusted to cycling speeds, and building additional bicycle and pedestrian only bridges across busy streets and over the harbour and canals. The city also plans to increase safety by redesigning a number of intersections with a high number of accidents, and rebuilding school routes with safer infrastructure, and speed decreasing measures. Finally the strategy also aims to improve the chaotic bicycle parking conditions, by greatly expanding the number of parking spaces, especially in and around stations.|$|E
25|$|Palmerston North is {{perceived}} as being better for cycling than most New Zealand cities, with 2001 figures putting it a close second only to Blenheim in terms of bicycle <b>modal</b> <b>share.</b> The Manawatu River Pathway is great for family or beginners riders, as it is all flat to mildly contoured, with some limestone sections, as well as wide cement paths. The track has many access points to this trail, which runs for over 9km between Maxwells Line in the West to Riverside Drive in the East. A new 3km section has been added between Ashhurst and Raukawa Road, with plans to link this to the existing path {{over the next two}} years, making over 22km of scenic tracks to explore alongside the river.|$|E

Passenger and freight activities have increased in Spain and are projected to continue, presenting a challenge for sustainable mobility efforts; emissions have increased, mainly fueled by the rise in activity; <b>modal</b> <b>shares</b> have pulled away from public transport, with a decrease in bus and rail, towards an increase in car and air travel; energy intensities, though initially decreasing, are currently increasing; and fuel use has taken over 37 % of Spanish final energy consumption. To target these issues the Spanish government has focused its efforts in targeting energy efficiency through dieselization, which has not led to positive results. More recently policies and measures have been directed towards redirecting <b>modal</b> <b>shares</b> and diversifying the fuel mix. Little has been done to reduce activity besides some anecdotic public awareness campaigns. Activity reduction may be achieved with regulations, restrictions and mobility plans; by increasing high speed rail and rail freight transport; by improving intermodality and tying the Spanish rail network with the EU; and with more urban transport planning at local level.

2500|$|The Cycle Super Highways are {{a series}} of bike paths that connect Copenhagen to nearby suburbs.

Eurostat data report that freight transport in Sweden (by rail, road and waterways) increased by 17  % in tonne-kilometre terms between 2000 and 2008. Passenger transport increased little over the same period. This puts the increase in total greenhouse gas emissions into perspective. However, the <b>modal</b> <b>shares</b> of rail road and waterways transport have hardly changed in 11  years, remaining at around 65  % for the road.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the chapter is to make {{retrospective}} data from biographic surveys comparable with traditional cross-section travel surveys, by correcting some biases attached to the biographic collection method. This is applied to a biographic survey passed in France within the 2007 – 2008 national travel survey. Methodology/approach — The methodology implemented deals with three specific biases: the general survey sampling and response rate, the survival bias, due to differential surviving rates according to generations, and the geographical bias, as biographies were not passed in all regions. All biases were corrected by computing specific weightings. Findings — One main finding is that with these three corrections, biographic data can yield <b>modal</b> <b>shares</b> for commuting trips to work and for commuting trips to education {{that are similar to}} those derived from the historical crosssection surveys about regular trips. Research limitations/implications — Though biographic collection suffers from the memory effect, this effect remains low and does not disturb the <b>modal</b> <b>shares</b> derived from biographies. The most challenging issue is that of missing generations that contributed to past mobility. But they can be replaced by modeling with an age-period model. Practical implications — The chapter provides methodology to correct biographic data to reconstitute historical behavior. Social implications — Exploring the memory of living people is essential to save data about the past, that otherwise could be lost, although they may be useful to understand present behavior and future likely trends. Originality/value of chapter—Investigating biographic surveys is a new topic in the field of transport survey methods...|$|R
