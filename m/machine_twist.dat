The industry had burgeoned after the Civil War: only four of the thirty four silk exhibitors (representing America 2 ̆ 7 s two hundred twenty four silk manufacturers and dealers) could trace their origins to the 2 ̆ 2 times which tried the souls of the silk producers and manufacturers. 2 ̆ 2 The Nonotuck Silk Company, the unlikely descendant of the 18302 ̆ 7 s moth-to-cloth Northampton Silk Company, was one that could and did. After falling twice from the rickety carousel of early nineteenth century enterprises, it seized the brass ring and held on. The key to its success was its manufacture of the first usable 2 ̆ 2 <b>machine</b> <b>twist,</b> 2 ̆ 2 a silk thread strong and smooth enough to withstand the unprecedented demands of the newly invented sewing machine. Nonotuck became one of the nation 2 ̆ 7 s leading silk thread manufactures and Northampton 2 ̆ 7 s largest employer for decades. Yet the details of this key invention have never been spelled out. This paper attempts to fill that gap. The sericulture years: 1830 - 1850. The story begins, not in 1838 as the trade card suggests, but eight years earlier, when Samuel Whitmarsh, a 30 -year-old Boston native, bought a large estate near the center of Northampton with the proceeds of a successful tailoring business in New York and built cocoonery for two million silkworms and two greenhouses for mulberry shoots next to his mansion. Raising silkworm was a popular spring pastime in Northampton in the 18202 ̆ 7 s; Whitmarsh tugged the silkworm from cottage to factory, from hobby to industry. A former linseed oil mill three miles three miles to the north along the Mill River served as his first factory. A few years later, backed by a group of New York and Connecticut financiers, Whitmarsh built a four-story brick one nearby. The new 7 factory hummed with up-to-the-minute machinery. Tourists flocked to see his power loom churn out silk ribbons and vesting. The Northampton Silk Company was incorporated in 1838. But some whispered that the manufacture was mostly a show to persuade the gullible to invest in mulberry trees, whose price increased tenfold in a few short years. The Northampton Silk Company burst with the mulberry bubble. Bankrupt, Whitmarsh withdrew in 1840. Out but not down, he tried, again unsuccessfully, to establish a silk industry in Jamaica a few years later. At the time of his death, in Northampton in 1875, he was planning to raise silk in California...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to develop a carding <b>machine</b> and <b>twisting</b> <b>machine</b> for produce eri fiber and yarn. A carding machine decomposes degumming cocoons and forms it into cohesiveness silk filament. Silk filament was then spun and <b>twisted</b> in <b>twisting</b> <b>machine.</b> Factors to test machine functionality were teeth of carding head which were aligned in straight and zigzag pattern. Speeds of fiber feeding were 0. 24, 0. 32, and 0. 4 meter per minute. From the experiments of carding machine, it can be found that almost cocoons were decomposed when using zigzag pattern. Speed of cocoon feeder was about 0. 24 meter per minute. From <b>twisting</b> <b>machine</b> testing, results pointed out different speed of fiber feeding provided different size of yarn. The properties of eri silk obtained from machine were similar with eri silk produced from traditional method. Therefore, carding <b>machine</b> and <b>twisting</b> <b>machine</b> developed in this research can help farmers to increase production and support the eri silk industry development...|$|R

40|$|Winding {{movement}} of <b>twisting</b> <b>machine</b> {{is closely related}} to the package build, package density and yarn quality. The requirements are that the package build is good shaped and the winding tension is proper technically. Namely the angle of winding is fine and there is no overlapping and convex, hard edge on the package. The winding density is same and reasonable on the whole package build. And the fluctuation of winding tension is small. It is becoming development trend that driving of multiple-motors is used on <b>twisting</b> <b>machine.</b> There are many parameters to be controlled such as degree of twist, direction of twist, winding angle and spindle speed and so on.

50|$|The {{stellarator}} {{was invented}} by Lyman Spitzer of Princeton University in 1951, and much of its early development {{was carried out by}} his team at what became the Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory (PPPL).

This would keep the fuel confined long enough to allow it to be heated to the point where fusion would take place.

30|$|The paper yarns {{used in the}} weft {{were made}} into two types, single yarn and {{combination}} yarn. First, in the manufacturing process of a single yarn, a paper sheet was cut to a pre-determined width to make a tape yarn, and after that the single yarn was produced by adding a proper twist to the tape yarn through a <b>twisting</b> <b>machine.</b> In other words, the Hanji paper sheet, {{with the weight of}} 13  g/m 2, was cut into the tape yarn in the width of 2.75 and 3.75  mm. Then, the Hanji paper yarns, count of 16 and 11  Ne, were produced after twisting 600 and 520  tpm (Z-twist), respectively, using a <b>twisting</b> <b>machine</b> (Murata® 363). The combination yarn was manufactured by combining paper yarn and core spun yarn. In this study, Hanji paper yarn of 16 or 30  Ne was plied in S-twist with the core spun yarn [cotton (sheath)/spandex (core)]. After that, the structures of Hanji combination yarns were stabilized through the steam setting for 14  min at 105  °C. With this process, the count of Hanji combination yarn produced was 10 and 15  Ne, respectively.|$|R
50|$|Hard candies {{were popular}} {{during the late}} 1940s, but high {{humidity}} in southern Georgia caused production, shipping and shelf-life problems. Production issues were addressed in 1946 by installing large air conditioners to de-humidify the company's wrapping room. Shelf-life and shipping issues were addressed in 1949 with a new machine that sealed candy stick in moisture-proof wrappers. Increasing production rates via automating the production was accomplished with a creation of Father Harding Keller, a Roman Catholic priest of the Diocese of Little Rock, and McCormack's brother-in-law. Fr. Keller first invented a machine to dispense ribbons of peanut butter on the company's peanut butter crackers. In 1950, Keller invented a <b>machine</b> that <b>twisted</b> soft candy into the spiral striping that defined the look of candy canes and then cutting the canes in precise lengths. Fr. Keller patented his invention, the Keller Machine. Fr. Keller and his machine gained national fame in the 1960s {{when he was a}} contestant on the popular TV show What's My Line.|$|R

40|$|Elastic {{warp-knitted}} composite fabrics with far-infrared emissivity and an anion-releasing property {{were prepared}} using bamboo charcoal (BC), copper (Cu), and phase-change material (PCM). The functional composite fabric, which {{was composed of}} self-made complex yarns with various twisting degrees and material composition, were created using a rotor twister and ring-spinning technique. The fabric structure was diversified by the feeding modes of weft yarn into a crochet-knitting <b>machine.</b> The <b>twist</b> number of complex yarns was optimized by tensile tenacity, twist contraction, and hairiness, and analysis showed that twisting at 12 twists per inch produced the highest tensile tenacity and appropriate twist contraction and hairiness. Comfort evaluation showed that the elastic composite fabrics with BC weft yarns exhibited higher water–vapor transmission rate and air permeability, reaching 876 g/m 2 ∙ day and 73. 2 cm 3 /s/cm 2, respectively. Three structures of composite fabric with various weft yarns had > 0. 85 ε far-infrared emissivity and 350 – 420 counts/cm 3 anion amount.
