25|$|In {{the eastern}} part of the state, near the border with the State of Mexico, is the town of Tlalpujahua. This {{community}} is known for Christmas ornaments that are blown from glass then hand-painted. This craft began after Joaquin Muñoz Orta returned from the United States, where he became familiar with the tradition of using glass balls to decorate trees. They began creating them in Mexico City but returned to his hometown to continue in 1964, where his business grew to <b>make</b> <b>millions</b> of the balls each year, exporting most. Today, the making of ornaments remains the main generator of employment for this area.|$|E

500|$|DiCaprio's {{first film}} of 2002 was the biographical crime drama film Catch Me If You Can, {{based on the}} life of Frank Abagnale Jr., who, before his 19th birthday, used his charm, confidence, and several {{different}} personas, to <b>make</b> <b>millions</b> in the 1960s writing bad checks. Directed by Steven Spielberg, the film was shot in 147 different locations in only 52 days, making it [...] "the most adventurous, super-charged movie-making" [...] DiCaprio had experienced yet. Catch Me If You Can received favorable reviews and proved to be an international success, becoming DiCaprio's highest-grossing film since Titanic with a total of US$351.1 million worldwide. Roger Ebert praised his performance, and noted that while [...] "DiCaprio, who in recent films [...] has played dark and troubled characters, is breezy and charming here, playing a boy who discovers what he is good at, and does it." [...] The following year, DiCaprio received his third Golden Globe nomination for his work in the film.|$|E
500|$|Rhodes capitalised the Company at £1,000,000, {{split into}} £1 shares, {{and used his}} other {{business}} interests to pump capital into it. Rhodes's diamond concern, De Beers, invested more than £200,000, while his gold firm, Gold Fields, put in nearly £100,000. He himself put in £45,000, along with another £11,000 jointly with Beit. Overall, {{about half of the}} Chartered Company's capital was held by its main actors, particularly Rhodes, Beit, Rudd and their confederates. During the Company's early days, Rhodes and his associates set themselves up to <b>make</b> <b>millions</b> over the coming years through what Robert Blake describes as a [...] "... which must be regarded as one of Rhodes's least creditable actions". Contrary to what Whitehall and the public had been allowed to think, the Rudd Concession was not vested in the British South Africa Company, but in a short-lived ancillary concern of Rhodes, Rudd and others called the Central Search Association, which was quietly formed in London in 1889. This entity renamed itself the United Concessions Company in 1890, and soon after sold the Rudd Concession to the Chartered Company for 1,000,000 shares. When Colonial Office functionaries discovered this chicanery in 1891, they advised Knutsford to consider revoking the concession, but no action was taken.|$|E
500|$|The {{opening track}} [...] "Doo Rags" [...] contemplates Nas' youth and society's {{cyclical}} nature. It features a contemporary piano loop and jazz tones. Richard Hazell from HipHopDX describes the song as [...] "a piano propelled painting {{of time and}} space as seen through the third eye of Nas, which can easily be envisioned by any New York City dweller." [...] On [...] "My Way", he meditates over his rise out of poverty to the [...] "life of a rich thug", recalls the death of his childhood friend Ill Will, and concedes that he [...] "still feels broke with millions in the bank." [...] On [...] "U Gotta Love It", Nas makes reference to the [...] "'86 crack blitz" [...] and discusses his own significance: [...] "This thug life you claimed it, I <b>make</b> <b>millions</b> from entertainment / Now back in the , certain cats they wanna kill me / They ice-grill me, but on the low, niggas feel me." [...] "Nothing Lasts Forever" [...] advises to appreciate life's small epiphanies and be optimistic about the future. On [...] "No Idea's Original", Nas notes the similarities of people in life and views other rappers as creatively derivative, while distinguishing himself from them: [...] "No idea's original, there's nothin new under the sun / It's never what you do, but how it's done / What you base your happiness around material, women, and large paper / That means you inferior, not major." [...] He references the line [...] "there's nothing new under the sun" [...] from the Book of Ecclesiastes in the song's chorus. [...] "No Idea's Original" [...] samples Barry White's 1973 song [...] "I'm Gonna Love You Just a Little More Baby", a frequently sampled recording in hip hop music.|$|E

500|$|Production {{was delayed}} when the actors, {{directors}} and writers guilds refused {{to support the}} spin-off. [...] A deal previously unheard of was negotiated in April, which allowed guild members involved to collect residuals. [...] This agreement prompted Lindelof and Cuse to develop a storyline for the Video Diaries that would include Losts regular characters, although not all of Losts regular cast signed contracts. [...] According to Touchstone's {{executive vice president for}} production Barry Jossen, who would eventually serve as an executive producer on the mobisodes, [...] "They seem to be under the impression that we'll <b>make</b> <b>millions</b> of dollars and they won't". [...] Variety reported that the mobisodes would be produced and aired alongside the third season of Lost. [...] At Comic-Con International in July, Lindelof and Cuse announced that only thirteen mobisodes would be produced. [...] They would run during the third season's winter hiatus, with none saved exclusively for the third season's DVD set. [...] A sneak peek of the Video Diaries was also shown at Comic-Con. [...] The new premise featured Hurley Reyes (played by Jorge Garcia) finding a functional Dharma Initiative video camcorder that had Dharma orientation films on it. [...] In the clip, he films Kate Austen (Evangeline Lilly) and James [...] "Sawyer" [...] Ford (Josh Holloway). [...] During the hiatus, no mobisodes were to be found and clips from upcoming episodes called Lost Moments aired instead, on television and then ABC.com. [...] In January 2007, Wizard discovered that ABC was still negotiating the actors' contracts; thus, no mobisodes had been produced, aside from the Comic-Con teaser. [...] In February, Losts script coordinator, responding to a fan question, suspected the mobisodes had seemingly been put on hold indefinitely due to an inability to reach a contract agreement.|$|E

Fisher hired away Capp's top assistant, Moe Leff. After Fisher underwent plastic surgery, Capp included a racehorse in Li'l Abner named [...] "Ham's Nose-Bob." [...] In 1950, Capp introduced a cartoonist character named [...] "Happy Vermin"—a caricature of Fisher—who hired Abner to draw his comic strip in a dimly lit closet, (after sacking his previous [...] "temporary" [...] assistant of 20 years, who had been cut off from all his friends in the process). Instead of using Vermin's tired characters, Abner inventively peopled the strip with hillbillies. A bighearted Vermin told his slaving assistant: [...] "I'm proud of having created these characters!!

60|$|Hartford {{had its own}} {{literary}} group. Mrs. Harriet Beecher Stowe {{lived near}} the Clemens home; also Charles Dudley Warner. The Clemens and Warner families were constantly associated, and The Gilded Age, published in 1873, resulted from the friendship of Warner and Mark Twain. The character of Colonel Sellers in that book has become immortal, {{and it is a}} character that only Mark Twain could create, for, though drawn from his mother's cousin, James Lampton, it embodies--and in no very exaggerated degree--characteristics that were his own. The tendency to <b>make</b> <b>millions</b> was always imminent; temptation was always hard to resist. Money-making schemes are continually being placed before men of means and prominence, and Mark Twain, to the day of his death, found such schemes fatally attractive.|$|E

You may think such a view prejudiced; but I violently deny that any democrat has a right to override such prejudices, if they are popular and positive. Thus he would not have a right to <b>make</b> <b>millions</b> of Moslems vote with a cross if they had a prejudice in favor of voting with a crescent. Unless this is admitted, democracy is a farce we need scarcely keep up. If it is admitted, the Suffragists have not merely to awaken an indifferent, but to convert a hostile majority.|$|E
