40|$|This article {{describes}} {{a combination of}} experimental and mathematical methods for the determination of undissolved air content in hydraulic oil. The experimental part consists of {{the determination of the}} oil bulk modulus, considering the influence of undissolved air by means of a volume compression method in a steel pipe. A multiphase model of an oil/undissolved air mixture is subsequently defined using Matlab SimHydraulics software. The multiphase model permits the volume compression of oil and air bubbles independently of each other. Furthermore, time dependencies of pressures are mathematically simulated during the compression of the <b>multiphase</b> <b>mixture</b> <b>of</b> <b>oil</b> and undissolved air for different concentrations of the latter. The undissolved air content is determined by comparing the mathematically simulated and experimentally measured time dependencies of pressure increases. Web of Science 617 - 848547...|$|E
40|$|A {{study has}} been {{completed}} which examined the technical, operational and safety issues associated with subsea production and subsea well systems. The rapidly accelerating shift to subsea production represents {{a significant departure from}} conventional production operations. The subsea environment is perhaps the most remote and unexplored on earth. This remoteness makes monitoring and intervention much more difficult and raises unique environmental issues. Historically, subsea production and subsea well systems have had a good track record. However, these systems are now being deployed in ways rarely encountered in previous development schemes, presenting a number of technical challenges. One of the key challenges is to address the expected poor primary recoveries from subsea wells. Subsea production systems require the transportation of a <b>multiphase</b> <b>mixture</b> <b>of</b> <b>oil,</b> water and gas for many miles from the producing well to a distant processing facility. Industry and regulators are increasingly becoming aware that, while reducing up-front capital outlays, long, multiphase flowlines add additional backpressure, reducing flow rates and ultimate recoveries. For example, conventional production operations routinely drawdown wellhead pressures to 10 - 20 bar, while subsea completed wells may have abandonment wellhead pressures over 100 bar due to the backpressure added by the long multiphase flowline. One of the challenges posed by subsea production is how to reduce wellhead pressure to allow effective recovery of hydrocarbon resources. To address this issue, there is growing interest in processing the produced fluids subsea, to achieve improved recoveries and greater efficiencies. A goal {{of this study is to}} provide decision makers with the information necessary to assess the conservation impact associated with various subsea production strategies; strategies that may or may not consider subsea processing or subsea multiphase pumping. The objectives of this study are shown to th...|$|E

40|$|Tumour hypoxia is {{associated}} with poor drug delivery and low rates of cell proliferation, factors that limit the efficacy of therapies that target proliferating cells. Since macrophages localise within hypoxic regions, a promising way to target hypoxic tumour cells involves engineering macrophages to express therapeutic genes under hypoxia. In this paper we develop mathematical models to compare the responses of avascular tumour spheroids to two modes of action: either the macrophages deliver an enzyme that activates an externally applied prodrug (bystander model), or they deliver cytotoxic factors directly (local model). The models we develop comprise partial differential equations for a <b>multiphase</b> <b>mixture</b> <b>of</b> tumour cells, macrophages and extracellular fluid, coupled to a moving boundary representing the spheroid surface. Chemical constituents, such as oxygen and drugs, diffuse within the <b>multiphase</b> <b>mixture.</b> Simulations <b>of</b> both models show the spheroid evolving to an equilibrium or to a travelling wave (multiple stable solutions are also possible). We uncover the parameter dependence of the wave speed and steady-state tumour size, and bifurcations between these solution forms. For some parameter sets, adding extra macrophages has a counterintuitive deleterious effect, triggering a bifurcation from bounded to unbounded tumour growth. While these features are common to the bystander and local models, the crucial difference is where cell death occurs. The bystander model is comparable to traditional chemotherapy, with poor targeting of hypoxic tumour cells; however, the local mode of action is more selective for hypoxic regions. We conclude that effective targeting of hypoxic tumour cells may {{require the use of}} drugs with limited mobility or whose action does not depend on cell proliferation...|$|R
