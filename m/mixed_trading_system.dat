40|$|The Kyoto {{protocol}} allows {{developed countries}} to achieve cost-effective {{greenhouse gas emission}} reductions abroad by means of international emissions trading (IET), joint implementation (JI) and the clean development mechanism (CDM). The article argues that JI and CDM projects will be more effective, efficient and politically acceptable than an IET system. Firstly, ex post baselines will ensure real abatement for JI and CDM projects, while the allocation of 'hot air' entails the trading of fake emission reductions under IET. Secondly, region-by-project baseline matrices will reduce transaction costs for JI and CDM, while transaction costs may increase for IET both under various trading rules and in an upstream, hybrid, or <b>mixed</b> domestic <b>trading</b> <b>system</b> design. Thirdly, JI and CDM have more competitive advantages than IET, for example the possibility of pre-budget banking for CDM. Fourthly, analyses of about one hundred pilot phase projects and twenty permit trading simulation studies indicate that JI and CDM will be cheaper than IET. Fifthly, JI and CDM will be more politically acceptable than IET, since they avoid the macro-level (re) distribution of property or user rights. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

40|$|Abstract: The {{last decade}} has {{witnessed}} {{a dramatic increase}} in both the number and the market share of screen-based <b>trading</b> <b>systems.</b> Electronic <b>trading</b> <b>systems</b> do offer lower operating costs and the possibility of remote access to the market. On the other hand, arguments based on the anonymity of electronic <b>trading</b> <b>systems</b> suggest that adverse selection may be a more severe problem and that, therefore, bid-ask spreads may be higher. The present paper addresses the issue of transaction costs in floor and computerized <b>trading</b> <b>systems</b> empirically. In Germany, floor and screen trading for the same stocks exist in parallel. Both markets are liquid and operate simultaneously for several hours each day. An analysis of the bid-ask spreads reveals that the electronic <b>trading</b> <b>system</b> is relatively less attractive for less liquid stocks. The market shares of the competing systems reveal a similar pattern. The market share of the electronic <b>trading</b> <b>system</b> is negatively related to the total trading volume of the stock, is positively related to the difference between spreads on the floor and in the screen <b>trading</b> <b>system</b> and is at least partially negatively related to return volatility. We further document that spreads in the electronic <b>trading</b> <b>system</b> respond more heavily to changes in return volatility and that the adverse selection component of the spread is larger.
