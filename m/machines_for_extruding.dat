40|$|An {{experiment}} {{was conducted to}} evaluate, the use of extruded chickpea, common bean and red lentil meals as dietary protein source for juvenile rainbow trout. Three experimental diets were formulated based on a reference diet, which composed of 70 % reference diet and 30 % test ingredient. The diets were given as triplicate groups of juvenile rainbow trout (initial weight of 50 g) to apparent satiation twice daily. There {{were no significant differences}} among the groups fed chickpea, common bean and reference diet, for weight gain, specific growth rate and feed conversion ratio, but there were significant differences among these groups and red lentil group in these respects. There {{were no significant differences in}} digestibility of protein between the fish fed chickpea and reference diets and chickpea and common bean diets, but the red lentil diet gave lower protein digestibility. Apparent protein digestibility coefficients of the ingredients were determined high <b>for</b> <b>extruded</b> chickpea (80. 65 %), mid-range <b>for</b> <b>extruded</b> common bean (72. 91 %) and low <b>for</b> <b>extruded</b> red lentil meals (50. 07 %).

Treatments were 1) soybean meal, 2) roasted soybeans, 3) extruded soybeans, and 4) soybeans extruded with an extrusion enhancer (sodium sulfite). The soybean meal and soybeans were mill-run. The control diet was cornstarch-based, with. 9 % lysine,. 65 % Ca, and. 55 % P for the growing pigs and. 75 % lysine,. 55 % Ca, and. 45 % P for the finishing pigs. For the growing pigs, apparent total tract digestibilities of DM and GE were greater for soybean meal than full-fat soy products. However, ileal digestibilities of DM, GE, N, and amino acids generally were greatest <b>for</b> <b>extruded</b> soybeans and lowest for roasted soybeans, with soybean meal intermediate. Differences at the terminal ileum were more pronounced than for the total tract, thus indicating that hind-gut fermentation is likely to mask many of the true nutritional differences in feedstuffs. For finishing pigs, total tract digestibilities of DM and GE were greater for soybean meal than for the full-fat soy products because of the relatively low digestibility coefficients for roasted soybeans. Ileal digestibilities of DM, GE, and N were greater <b>for</b> the <b>extruded</b> soybeans and extruded soybeans with sodium sulfite than for the roasted soybeans. Availabilities of the indispensable amino acids measured at the terminal ileum were greatest <b>for</b> <b>extruded</b> soybeans, intermediate <b>for</b> soybean meal, and lowest for roasted soybeans.
