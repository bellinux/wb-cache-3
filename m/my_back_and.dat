500|$|St-Pierre's trainer Greg Jackson {{denied any}} wrongdoing, stating that Nurse was rubbing and tapping on St-Pierre's body {{as part of}} a drill to aid in his {{breathing}} techniques. [...] Jackson said that any Vaseline transferred from residue on Nurse's fingers was accidental and wiped off when pointed out. [...] Georges St-Pierre spoke to Sports Illustrated with regard to the controversy stating, [...] "I haven't seen the fight yet, but I remember at some point something happened and the athletic commission was complaining. [...] They used a towel to wet <b>my</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> wipe it off. [...] I don't mind. [...] I didn't put Vaseline on myself and I'm not a cheater." [...] However, St-Pierre offered Penn a rematch in the summer that Penn verbally accepted but is unlikely to happen due to the fact they have both since been scheduled for title defenses.|$|E
500|$|Stage two (self-interest driven) {{expresses the}} [...] "what's {{in it for}} me" [...] position, in which right {{behavior}} is defined by whatever the individual believes {{to be in their}} best interest but understood in a narrow way which does not consider one's reputation or relationships to groups of people. Stage two reasoning shows a limited interest in the needs of others, but only to a point where it might further the individual's own interests. As a result, concern for others is not based on loyalty or intrinsic respect, but rather a [...] "You scratch <b>my</b> <b>back,</b> <b>and</b> I'll scratch yours" [...] mentality. The lack of a societal perspective in the pre-conventional level {{is quite different from the}} social contract (stage five), as all actions at this stage have the purpose of serving the individual's own needs or interests. For the stage two theorist, the world's perspective is often seen as morally relative.|$|E

500|$|A {{pioneer of}} rock and roll, Berry was a {{significant}} influence {{on the development of}} both the music and the attitude associated with the rock music lifestyle. With songs such as [...] "Maybellene" [...] (1955), [...] "Roll Over Beethoven" [...] (1956), [...] "Rock and Roll Music" [...] (1957) and [...] "Johnny B. Goode" [...] (1958), Berry refined and developed rhythm and blues into the major elements that made rock and roll distinctive, with lyrics successfully aimed to appeal to the early teenage market by using graphic and humorous descriptions of teen dances, fast cars, high school life, and consumer culture, and utilizing guitar solos and showmanship that would be a major influence on subsequent rock music. [...] Thus Berry, the songwriter, invented rock as [...] "a music of teenage wishes fulfilled and good times (even with cops in pursuit)." [...] Berry contributed three things to rock music: an irresistible swagger, a focus on the guitar riff as the primary melodic element and an emphasis on songwriting as storytelling. His records are a rich storehouse of the essential lyrical, showmanship and musical components {{of rock and}} roll. In addition to the Beatles and the Rolling Stones, a large number of significant popular-music performers have recorded Berry's songs. Though not technically accomplished, his guitar style is distinctive—he incorporated electronic effects to mimic the sound of bottleneck blues guitarists and drew on the influence of guitar players such as Carl Hogan, and T-Bone Walker to produce a clear and exciting sound that many later guitarists would acknowledge as an influence in their own style. Berry's showmanship has been influential on other rock guitarists, particularly his one-legged hop routine, and the [...] "duck walk", which he first used as a child when he walked [...] "stooping with full-bended knees, but with <b>my</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> head vertical" [...] under a table to retrieve a ball and his family found it entertaining; he used it when [...] "performing in New York {{for the first time and}} some journalist branded it the duck walk." ...|$|E

Trendafil went to collect them from the villagers. When he surrendered the arms, they shot him with a gun and the bullet scratched his eye. Then I heard Ahmet Aga command with his own mouth for Trendafil to be impaled and burnt. The words he used were [...] "Shishak aor" [...] which is Turkish for [...] "to put on a skewer (as a shish kebab). After that, they took all the money he had, undressed him, gouged his eyes, pulled out his teeth and impaled him slowly on a stake, until it came out of his mouth. Then they roasted him while he was still alive. He lived for half-an-hour during this terrible scene. At the time, I was near Ahmet Aga with other Bulgarian women. We were surrounded by Bashi-Bozouk, who had us surrounded, and forced us to watch what was happening to Trendafil.“ One of her children, Vladimir, who was still a baby at his mother's breast, was impaled on a sword in front of her eyes. “At the time this was happening, Ahmet Aga's son took my child from <b>my</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> cut him to pieces, there in front of me.

2500|$|The {{history of}} {{chiropractic}} began in 1895 when Daniel David Palmer of Iowa performed the first chiropractic adjustment on a partially deaf janitor, Harvey Lillard. While Lillard was working without his shirt on in Palmers office, Lillard {{bent over to}} empty the trash can. Palmer noticed that Lillard had a vertebra out of position. He asked Lillard what happened, and Lillard replied, [...] "I moved the wrong way, and I heard a 'pop' in <b>my</b> <b>back,</b> <b>and</b> that's when I lost my hearing." [...] Palmer, who was also involved in many other natural healing philosophies, had Lillard lie {{face down on the}} floor and proceeded with the adjustment. The next day, Lillard told Palmer, [...] "I can hear that rackets on the streets." [...] This experience led Palmer to open a school of chiropractic two years later. Rev. Samel Weed coined the word [...] "chiropractic" [...] from Greek roots. Chiropractic's early philosophy was rooted in vitalism, naturalism, magnetism, spiritualism and other constructs that are not amenable to the scientific method, although Palmer tried to merge science and metaphysics. In 1896, Palmer's first descriptions and underlying philosophy of chiropractic echoed Andrew Still's principles of osteopathy established a decade earlier. Both described the body as a [...] "machine" [...] whose parts could be manipulated to produce a drugless cure. Both professed the use of spinal manipulation on joint dysfunction/subluxation to improve health. Palmer distinguished his work by noting that he was the first to use short-lever HVLA manipulative techniques using the spinous process and transverse processes as mechanical levers. He described the effects of chiropractic spinal manipulation as being mediated primarily by the nervous system.|$|E
