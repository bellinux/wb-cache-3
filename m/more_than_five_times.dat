5|$|This result suffices to {{show that}} the number of steps in Euclid's {{algorithm}} can never be <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>five</b> <b>times</b> the number of its digits (base 10). For if the algorithm requires N steps, then b is {{greater than or equal to}} F'N+1 which in turn is greater than or equal to φ'N1, where φ is the golden ratio. Since b≥φ'N1, then N1≤logφ'b. Since log10φ>1/5, (N1)/5< log10φ logφ'b = log10b. Thus, N ≤ 5 log10b. Thus, the Euclidean algorithm always needs less than O(h) divisions, where h is the number of digits in the smaller number b.|$|E

Canadian and international studies have suggested this may be partly due to firm-level determinants. A chance to study this hypothesis has arisen from the improved availability of firm-level data through the Canadian Centre for Data Development and Economic Research. We argue that this creates an important opportunity for researchers and describe one attempt to capitalize on it by developing a research network.

5|$|For {{large-scale}} use, helium {{is extracted}} by fractional distillation from natural gas, which can contain {{as much as}} 7% helium. Since helium has a lower boiling point than any other element, low temperature and high pressure are used to liquefy nearly all the other gases (mostly nitrogen and methane). The resulting crude helium gas is purified by successive exposures to lowering temperatures, in which {{almost all of the}} remaining nitrogen and other gases are precipitated out of the gaseous mixture. Activated charcoal is used as a final purification step, usually resulting in 99.995% pure Grade-A helium. The principal impurity in Grade-A helium is neon. In a final production step, most of the helium that is produced is liquefied via a cryogenic process. This is necessary for applications requiring liquid helium and also allows helium suppliers to reduce the cost of long distance transportation, as the largest liquid helium containers have <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>five</b> <b>times</b> the capacity of the largest gaseous helium tube trailers.|$|E
5|$|The {{computational}} {{efficiency of}} Euclid's algorithm {{has been studied}} thoroughly. This efficiency can be described {{by the number of}} division steps the algorithm requires, multiplied by the computational expense of each step. The first known analysis of Euclid's algorithm is due to A. A. L. Reynaud in 1811, who showed that the number of division steps on input (u, v) is bounded by v; later he improved this to v/2 +2. Later, in 1841, P. J. E. Finck showed that the number of division steps is at most 2log2v+1, and hence Euclid's algorithm runs in time polynomial {{in the size of the}} input. Émile Léger, in 1837, studied the worst case, which is when the inputs are consecutive Fibonacci numbers. Finck's analysis was refined by Gabriel Lamé in 1844, who showed that the number of steps required for completion is never <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>five</b> <b>times</b> the number h of base-10 digits of the smaller numberb.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} the {{top-down}} design {{of an active}} pixel sensor (APS) circuit using an analytical model of its architecture. The model is applied to compare the performances of bulk versus silicon-on-insulator (SOI) CMOS processes and devices on the designs and performance of several 50 -frames/s imagers in 2 -mum and 0, 25 -mum CMOS with different pixels array sizes. For 2 -mum SOI, results show a reduction {{by two of the}} power consumption and a dynamic range increase of 0. 85 V under a 3 -V supply. This results in an SNR of 79 dB instead of 76. Fixed pattern noise (FPN) is also reduced from 2. 7 to 1. 8 mV which represents 0. 26 % and 0. 08 % of the dynamic range, respectively. For 0. 25 -mum CMOS SOI, results show a reduction by 6. 5 of the power consumption, FPN <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>five</b> <b>time</b> better, and a dynamic range increase of 0. 29 V under a 1. 5 -V supply. However because of the increase of the thermal noise due to the particular design choice, an SNR of 60. 3 dB is achieved compared to 63 in bulk. A better SNR in SOI than in bulk can be achieved but at the expense of power consumption and FPN. However, this could be combined with an increase in pixels number in SOI compared to bulk. Potential results achievable in SOI have to our knowledge never been reached by bulk APS imagers up to now...|$|R
