40|$|A new {{approach}} {{to the development of}} low-order dynamic models for multicomponent distillation processes is presented. This approach makes direct use of well known spatio-temporal pattern formation phenomena also termed as nonlinear wave propagation. It takes into account the typical features of multicomponent systems, i. e. coexistence of different constant pattern waves within a single section of a distillation column and the resulting wave interactions. In a first step, constant <b>molar</b> holdups and <b>flow</b> <b>rates,</b> constant pressure and constant relative volatilities are assumed. Under these conditions a rigorous analytical treatment is possible and a comparably simple but sound and robust method for nonlinear model reduction is developed. The approach applies to packed as well as staged columns provided the number of column stages is sudfficiently large. Application is demonstrated for two different distillation processes with a three and a five component mixture, respectively. It is shown that the dynamic behaviour of the low-order modelis in good agreement with corresponding reference model for a large set of operating conditions.

40|$|This report {{covers the}} third year of this {{research}} grant under the University Coal Research program. The overall objective of this project is to develop a comprehensive kinetic model for slurry phase Fischer-Tropsch synthesis (FTS) on iron catalysts. This model will be validated with experimental data obtained in a stirred tank slurry reactor (STSR) over a wide range of process conditions. The model will be able to predict <b>molar</b> <b>flow</b> <b>rates</b> and concentrations of all reactants and major product species (H{sub 2 }O, CO{sub 2 }, linear 1 - and 2 -olefins, and linear paraffins) as a function of reaction conditions in the STSR. During the reporting period we utilized experimental data from the STSR, that were obtained during {{the first two years of}} the project, to perform vapor-liquid equilibrium (VLE) calculations and estimate kinetic parameters. We used a modified Peng-Robinson (PR) equation of state (EOS) with estimated values of binary interaction coefficients for the VLE calculations. Calculated vapor phase compositions were in excellent agreement with experimental values from the STSR under reaction conditions. Occasional discrepancies (for some of the experimental data) between calculated and experimental values of the liquid phase composition were ascribed to experimental errors. The VLE calculations show that the vapor and the liquid are in thermodynamic equilibrium under reaction conditions. Also, we have successfully applied the Levenberg-Marquardt method (Marquardt, 1963) to estimate parameters of a kinetic model proposed earlier by Lox and Froment (1993 b) for FTS on an iron catalyst. This kinetic model is well suited for initial studies where the main goal is to learn techniques for parameter estimation and statistical analysis of estimated values of model parameters. It predicts that the chain growth parameter ({alpha}) and olefin to paraffin ratio are independent of carbon number, whereas our experimental data show that they vary with the carbon number.

In this paper, we have presented an approach for circumventing these types of problems.

40|$|To satisfy {{high power}} density demand in proton {{exchange}} membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs), a robust control strategy is essential. A linear ratio control strategy is {{examined in this}} work. The manipulated variables are selected using steady-state relative gain array (RGA) analysis to be the inlet molar flow rates of hydrogen and coolant, and the controlled variables are average power density and average solid temperature, respectively. By selecting proper manipulated variables, the PEMFC does not exhibit sign change in gain and hence can be controlled by using a linear controller. Transfer function models obtained from step tests on the distributed parameter PEMFC model are used to design controllers for the multiple input–multiple output (MIMO) system.
