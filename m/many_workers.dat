5|$|Although practised in Basse Casamance for centuries, rice {{cultivation}} has been threatened {{since the late}} 1960s. Productivity has declined because <b>many</b> <b>workers</b> have opted for life in the city, even though they continue to support their community. The drought of the 1970s and 1980s further aggravated the situation.|$|E
5|$|At 6:35pm, as <b>many</b> <b>workers</b> in {{the city}} were {{finishing}} their shifts, the alarm was sounded to gather the troops of the 5th and 6th Regiments. This {{was the first time}} such an alarm had been used {{in the city}}, and it caused a great deal of excitement, and attracted yet more citizens into the streets to witness events.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the strong}} economy, the Bay Area's housing market {{and cost of}} living is {{becoming}} increasingly expensive. As of 2017, the average income {{needed in order to}} purchase a house in the region was $179,390, while the median price for a house was $895,000. Because of the high cost of living, <b>many</b> <b>workers</b> in the Bay Area live far from their place of employment, contributing to one of the highest percentages of extreme commuters in the United States, or commutes that take over ninety minutes in one direction. For example, about 50,000 people commute from neighboring San Joaquin county into the nine-county Bay Area daily.|$|E

50|$|<b>Many</b> {{knowledge}} <b>workers</b> do {{not have}} experience with IT tools to develop a selfsourcing system. This is due to their lack the knowledge and expertise with IT tools. As a result, many systems become uncompleted and potentially good ideas are thrown away. With uncompleted projects <b>many</b> <b>worker</b> hours were also wasted which draw workers away from their primary duties.|$|R
50|$|Numerous {{buildings}} in the Loire Valley, from the most modest to the most grandiose, were built from blocks of tuffeau stone, including the Château de Beaulieu near Saumur, the Château d'Ussé and the Château de la Motte d'Usseau, and <b>many</b> <b>worker's</b> cottages at Longères.|$|R
5|$|World WarII {{marked the}} {{beginning}} of a long period of Australian economic growth. The war greatly increased the size and importance of the Australian manufacturing sector and stimulated the development of more technologically advanced industries. As part of this trend <b>many</b> <b>workers</b> acquired relatively high skill levels and female labour force participation rates greatly increased. Many women were forced out of traditionally male-dominated industries after the war, however.|$|E
5|$|Attitudes of the Russian {{space program}} and NASA towards Phase One were also {{of concern to}} the astronauts involved. Because of Russia's {{financial}} issues, <b>many</b> <b>workers</b> at the TsUP felt that the mission hardware and continuation of Mir {{was more important than}} the lives of the cosmonauts aboard the station. As such the program was run very differently compared to American programs: cosmonauts had their days being planned for them to the minute, actions (such as docking) which would be performed manually by shuttle pilots were all carried out automatically, and cosmonauts had their pay docked if they made any errors during their flights. Americans learned aboard Skylab and earlier space missions that this level of control was not productive and had since made mission plans more flexible. The Russians, however, would not budge, and many felt that significant work time was lost because of this.|$|E
5|$|Feminist economists' work on {{globalization}} is diverse and multifaceted. But {{much of it}} is tied together through detailed and nuanced studies {{of the ways in which}} globalization affects women in particular and how these effects relate to socially just outcomes. Often country case studies are used for these data. Some feminist economists focus on policies involving the development of globalization. For example, Lourdes Benería argues that economic development in the Global South depends in large part on improved reproductive rights, gender equitable laws on ownership and inheritance, and policies that are sensitive to the proportion of women in the informal economy. Additionally, Nalia Kabeer discusses the impacts of a social clause that would enforce global labor standards through international trade agreements, drawing on fieldwork from Bangladesh. She argues that although these jobs may appear exploitative, for <b>many</b> <b>workers</b> in those areas they present opportunities and ways to avoid more exploitative situations in the informal economy.|$|E
25|$|A {{recent study}} {{indicated}} that major cities like Karachi, Lahore, Faisalabad and Multan have large population of sex <b>workers.</b> <b>Many</b> sex <b>workers</b> in these cities operate from hotels or homes. Some cities have red-light districts, but due to illegal status of prostitution, <b>many</b> sex <b>workers</b> work in homes and other private facilities. There are very few identifiable traditional red-light districts in the cities in Pakistan. Prostitution in Pakistan is dispersed throughout urban areas in residential suburbs.|$|R

5000|$|Economic reforms {{initiated}} by Deng Xiaoping had improved the living standard of <b>many</b> urban <b>workers,</b> but by 1988, <b>many</b> such <b>workers</b> considered themselves [...] "losers {{in the decade}} of economic reform." [...] Corruption and inflation especially angered workers, and some responded with slowdowns and wildcat strikes in 1988 to 1989.|$|R
5|$|In 1976, workers' pay {{averaged}} between $11 and $18 per hour, {{depending on}} the position. With workweeks averaging between 70 and 84 hours per week, the problem for <b>many</b> <b>workers</b> became {{what to do with}} so much extra money. Teamster Jerry Thornhill, a typical worker, wrote to Money magazine, asking for advice. Thornhill detailed a pay rate of $57,000 per year at a time when members of Congress earned $42,500 annually, professional football players averaged $40,000, and U.S. vice president Nelson Rockefeller earned $62,500. The large amounts of money in the pipeline camps and a lack of entertainment caused frequent gambling games that sometimes involved tens of thousands of dollars. Instead of gambling, other workers saved their money for monthlong vacations to Hawaii or other warm climates, then returned to work with no money remaining.|$|E
5|$|In 2009, the {{university}} {{responded to a}} series of New York Times interviews that showed a pattern of labor abuses in its fledgling Abu Dhabi location, creating a statement of labor values for Abu Dhabi campus workers. A 2014 follow-up article found that while some conditions had improved, contractors for the multibillion-endowment university were still frequently subjecting their workers to third-world labor conditions. The article documented that these conditions included confiscation of worker passports, forced overtime, recruitment fees and cockroach-filled dorms where workers had to sleep under beds. According to the article, workers who attempted to protest the NYU contractors' conditions were promptly arrested. Reports also claimed that those arrested by police were later abused at the police station. <b>Many</b> <b>workers</b> who were not local were then deported to their home countries. The university quickly responded to the reports with an apology to the workers. In 2015, NYU compensated thousands of migrant workers on its Abu Dhabi complex.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} years of the project, workers were {{regularly}} treated to prime rib, steak dinners, and other exotic fare due to a cost-plus contract between the food preparers and the subcontractors. In later years, these cost-plus contracts were replaced, and institutional cooking and box lunches became common, but the food on the project was prized by <b>many</b> <b>workers.</b> As soon as the haul road, later named the Dalton Highway, was built, the food and the overtime for some unions changed. The highway construction was charged to the federal and state governments and was supposed to be cost plus. There were no more steak nights one to two times a week and the Australian rock lobster tails disappeared. The International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (IBEW) LU 1547 was one union that had overtime on Sundays changed from double time to time-and-one-half upon completion of the haul road.|$|E

50|$|With {{the social}} and working {{conditions}} of <b>many</b> Black <b>workers</b> deteriorating, <b>many</b> Black <b>workers</b> concentrated in the auto industry, an unrepresentative and, at times, even hostile union, and a growing spirit of militancy of revolutionary vision among these workers, the conditions were ripe {{for the development of}} a working-class movement to directly engage Black workers and to build a political organization to fight for their interests.|$|R
50|$|Worker {{centers are}} {{non-profit}} community-based mediating organizations that organize and provide support to communities of low wage {{workers who are}} not already members of a collective bargaining organization (such as a trade union) or have been legally excluded from coverage by U.S. labor laws. <b>Many</b> <b>worker</b> centers in the United States focus on immigrant and low-wage workers in sectors such as restaurant, construction, day labor and agriculture.|$|R
5|$|Industrial {{conscription}} and {{the drive}} to increase productivity led to an increasing degree of industrial unrest over time. <b>Many</b> <b>workers</b> were required to work long hours in poor conditions and {{were not able to}} change their employment due to the manpower laws. Poor work conditions were exacerbated by the Government's austerity measures reducing workers' standards of living. As a result, strikes and other forms of protest disrupted Australian production, especially from 1943 onwards. These protests attracted considerable criticism from other civilians and members of the military. In May 1943 the Government introduced policies which enabled workers who were undertaking unlawful industrial action to be conscripted into the military, but this had little impact due to the shortage of skilled labour in the industries most prone to industrial disputes.|$|E
5|$|<b>Many</b> <b>workers</b> {{seen in the}} {{background}} of the first season are developed into secondary characters, and romantic relationships begin to develop between some of the characters. Michael spends the night with his boss Jan, {{in the wake of the}} latter's divorce, but does not sleep with her. Dwight and Angela become romantically involved, but keep the relationship a secret from everyone else. Kelly develops a crush on Ryan, and they start dating. When Roy sets a date for his wedding to Pam, Jim grows depressed and considers transferring to the Stamford, Connecticut branch, but tells Pam in the season finale that he loves her, even though Pam still insists she will marry Roy. The two kiss, but Jim transfers to the Stamford branch soon after. The general threat of downsizing continues throughout the season as well.|$|E
5|$|The {{exact number}} {{killed by the}} {{disaster}} is unknown. The Halifax Explosion Remembrance Book, an official database compiled in 2002 by the Nova Scotia Archives and Records Management, identified 1,950 victims. As many as 1,600 people died immediately in the blast, tsunami, and collapse of buildings. The last body, a caretaker killed at the Exhibition Grounds, was not recovered until the summer of 1919. An additional 9,000 were injured. 1,630 homes were destroyed in the explosion and fires, and another 12,000 damaged; roughly 6,000 people were left homeless and 25,000 had insufficient shelter. The city's industrial sector was in large part gone, with <b>many</b> <b>workers</b> among the casualties and the dockyard heavily damaged.|$|E

5|$|Occupational {{health and}} safety {{presented}} a challenge, because workers were handling a variety of toxic chemicals, using hazardous liquids and gases under high pressures, and working with high voltages, {{not to mention the}} largely unknown dangers presented by radioactivity and handling fissile materials. Accidents represented unacceptable numbers of work days lost, and a vigorous safety program was instituted. Since it did not matter where accidents occurred, this included safety off the job, in homes and in the schools. Safety indoctrination was included in job training, and safety training courses were held. Safety posters, manuals and films were distributed. In December 1945, the National Safety Council presented the Manhattan Project with the Award of Honor for Distinguished Service to Safety in recognition of its safety record. The Clinton Engineer Works also received an award of merit in the National Traffic Safety Contest. <b>Many</b> <b>workers</b> had to drive long distances over poorly built and inadequately maintained roads. There were 21 deaths from motor vehicles at the Clinton Engineer Works: two in 1943, nine in 1944, eight in 1945 and two in 1946. This represented a better road safety record than other towns of comparable size.|$|E
5|$|Similar {{to other}} {{industrial}} {{cities in the}} U.S., Omaha suffered severe job losses in the 1950s, more than 10,000 in total, as both the railroad and meatpacking industries restructured. Stockyards and packing plants were located closer to ranches, and union achievements were lost as wages declined in surviving jobs. <b>Many</b> <b>workers</b> left the area {{if they could get}} to other jobs. Poverty deepened in areas of the city whose residents had depended on those jobs, specifically North and South Omaha. At the same time, with reduced revenues, the city had less financial ability to respond to longstanding problems. Despair after the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. in April 1968 contributed to riots in North Omaha, including one at the Logan Fontenelle Housing Project. For some, the Civil Rights Movement in Omaha, Nebraska evolved towards black nationalism, as the Black Panther Party was involved in tensions in the late 1960s. Organizations such as the Black Association for Nationalism Through Unity became popular among the city's African-American youth. This tension culminated in the cause célèbre trial of the Rice/Poindexter Case, in which an Omaha Police Department officer was killed by a bomb while answering an emergency call.|$|E
5|$|The rioting {{impacted}} Chicago's economy. Some of the South Side's {{industry was}} closed during the riot. Businesses in the Loop were also affected by {{closure of the}} street cars. <b>Many</b> <b>workers</b> stayed away from affected areas. At the Union Stock Yard, one of Chicago's largest employers, all 15,000 African-American workers were initially expected {{to return to work}} on Monday, August 4, 1919. But after arson near white employees' homes near the Stock Yards on August 3, the management banned African-American employees from the stockyards in fear of further rioting. Governor Lowden noted his opinion that the troubles were related to labor issues rather than race. Nearly one-third of the African-American employees were non-union, and were resented by union employees for that reason. African-American workers were kept out of the stockyards for ten days {{after the end of the}} riot because of continued unrest. On August 8, 1919, about 3,000 non-union African Americans showed up for work under protection of special police, deputy sheriffs, and militia. The white union employees threatened to strike unless such security forces were discontinued. Their main grievance against African Americans was that they were non-union and had been used by management as strikebreakers in earlier years. Many African Americans fled the city as a result of the riots and damage.|$|E
