5|$|Fallout 3 is {{an action}} {{role-playing}} open world video game developed by Bethesda Game Studios {{and published by}} Bethesda Softworks. The third major installment in the Fallout series, {{it is the first}} game to be created by Bethesda since it bought the franchise from Interplay Entertainment. The game marks a <b>major</b> <b>shift</b> in the series by using 3D graphics and real-time combat, replacing the 2D isometric graphics and turn-based combat of previous installments. It was released worldwide in October 2008 for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3, and Xbox 360.|$|E
5|$|After {{the end of}} {{the promotional}} period, Burger King {{received}} numerous complaints from fans of Chicken Fries through social media sites such as Twitter and Facebook. One of the major ways the company responded was through personalized responses to these posts. Instead of using an automated response that would paste a standardized message on people's Twitter feeds, the company instead employed several staff to personally respond to customers voicing displeasure on the LTO nature of the 2014 introduction. The entire 2014 Chicken Fries promotion represented a <b>major</b> <b>shift</b> in the attitude towards advertising for Burger King, moving from a more traditional advertising structure to one focused almost entirely on digitally-based media. This change happened fairly quickly, falling into place over the twelve to eighteen-month period preceding the reintroduction of Chicken Fries to the chain's menu. Along with the new advertising firm, a new director of digital marketing and social media was newly hired from cosmetics firm L'Oréal was added, increasing the clout of the digital advertising team within the chain.|$|E

5|$|Another {{link between}} Europe and the Mongols was {{attempted}} in 1290, when the Genoese endeavored {{to assist the}} Mongols with naval operations. The plan was to construct and man two galleys to attack Mamluk ships in the Red Sea, and operate a blockade of Egypt's trade with India. As the Genoese were traditional supporters of the Mamluks, this was a <b>major</b> <b>shift</b> in policy, apparently motivated by the attack of the Egyptian Sultan Qalawun on the Cilician Armenians in 1285. To build and man the fleet, a squadron of 800 Genoese carpenters, sailors and crossbowmen went to Baghdad, working on the Tigris. However, due to a feud between the Guelphs and Ghibellines, the Genoese soon degenerated into internal bickering, and killed each other in Basra, {{putting an end to}} the project. Genoa finally cancelled the agreement and signed a new treaty with the Mamluks instead.|$|E
5|$|In North America {{and most}} of Europe, voles predominate in the diet and shrews are {{the second most common}} food choice. Mice and rats form the main {{foodstuffs}} in the Mediterranean region, the tropics, sub-tropics and Australia. Barn owls are usually more specialist feeders in productive areas and generalists in drier areas. On the Cape Verde Islands, geckos are the mainstay of the diet, supplemented by birds such as plovers, godwits, turnstones, weavers and pratincoles, and on a rocky islet off the coast of California, a clutch of four young were being reared on a diet of Leach's storm petrel (Oceanodroma leucorhoa). In Ireland, the accidental introduction of the bank vole in the 1950s led to a <b>major</b> <b>shift</b> in the barn owl's diet: where their ranges overlap, the vole is now by far the largest prey item. Locally superabundant rodent species in the weight class of several grams per individual usually make up the single largest proportion of prey. In the United States, rodents and other small mammals usually make up ninety-five percent of the diet and worldwide, over ninety percent of the prey caught.|$|E
5|$|In late 1796, {{with the}} French Revolutionary Wars three years old, a <b>major</b> <b>shift</b> {{occurred}} in the conflict when the Kingdom of Spain, until that point {{an enemy of the}} French Republic, abruptly changed sides following the signing of the Treaty of San Ildefonso. This reversal forced the British Royal Navy to retire from the Mediterranean Sea to preserve its lines of communication, falling back to the mouth of the Tagus River near Lisbon. From the Tagus, pressure was placed on the Spanish Navy by the erstwhile British Mediterranean Fleet under Vice-Admiral Sir John Jervis, who organised a blockade of the main Spanish fleet base at Cádiz on the country's Southern Atlantic coast. This resulted in the Battle of Cape St. Vincent on 14 February 1797, when Jervis inflicted a stinging defeat on the Spanish fleet. The surviving Spanish ships limped back to Cádiz after the battle, and to ensure that they could not sail again without risking a repeat action, Jervis arranged a close blockade of the port so that by April there were 21 British ships of the line and numerous frigates watching the Spanish fleet at anchor.|$|E

40|$|Ehrlich and Raven {{proposed}} {{a model of}} coevolution where <b>major</b> host plant <b>shifts</b> of butterflies facilitate a burst of diversification driven by their arrival to a new adaptive zone. One prediction of this model is that reconstructions of historical diversification of butterflies should indicate an increase in diversification rate following <b>major</b> host <b>shifts.</b> Using reconstructed histories of 15 butterfly groups, I tested this prediction and found general agreement with Ehrlich and Raven's model. Butterfly lineages with an inferred <b>major</b> historical host <b>shift</b> showed evidence of diversification rate variation, with a significant acceleration following the host shift. Lineages without an inferred <b>major</b> host <b>shift</b> generally agreed with a constant-rate model of diversification. These {{results are consistent with}} the view that host plant associations have played a profound role in the evolutionary history of butterflies, and show that <b>major</b> <b>shifts</b> to chemically distinct plant groups leave a historical footprint that remains detectable today...|$|R
5|$|The {{economic}} {{importance of}} Gibraltar changed following {{the invention of}} steamships; {{the first one to}} reach Gibraltar's harbour arrived there in 1823. The advent of steamships caused a <b>major</b> <b>shift</b> in trade patterns in the Mediterranean. Transshipment, which had previously been Gibraltar's principal economic mainstay, was largely replaced by the much less lucrative work of servicing visiting steamships through coaling, victualling and ferrying of goods. Although Gibraltar became a key coaling station where British steamships refuelled on the way to Alexandria or Cape Horn, the economic changes resulted in a prolonged depression that lasted until {{near the end of the}} century. The demand for labour for coaling was such that Gibraltar instituted the practice of relying on large numbers of imported Spanish workers. A shanty town sprang up on the site of the old Spanish fortifications just across the border, which became the workers' town of La Línea de la Concepción. The poor economy meant that Gibraltar's population barely changed between 1830 and 1880, but it was still relatively more prosperous than the severely impoverished south of Spain. As a consequence, La Línea's population doubled over the same period and then doubled again in the following 20 years.|$|E
5|$|In Qinghai, the Salar Muslims voluntarily {{came under}} Ming rule, their clan leaders capitulating around 1370. Uyghur troops under Uyghur general Hala Bashi {{suppressed}} the Miao Rebellions of the 1370s {{and settled in}} Changde, Hunan. Hui Muslim troops also settled in Changde, Hunan after serving the Ming in campaigns against other aboriginal tribes. In 1381, the Ming dynasty annexed {{the areas of the}} southwest that had once been part of the Kingdom of Dali following the successful effort by Hui Muslim Ming armies to defeat Yuan-loyalist Mongol and Hui Muslim troops holding out in Yunnan province. The Hui troops under General Mu Ying, who was appointed Governor of Yunnan, were resettled in the region as part of a colonization effort. By the end of the 14th century, some 200,000 military colonists settled some 2,000,000 mu (350,000 acres) of land in what is now Yunnan and Guizhou. Roughly half a million more Chinese settlers came in later periods; these migrations caused a <b>major</b> <b>shift</b> in the ethnic make-up of the region, since formerly {{more than half of the}} population were non-Han peoples. Resentment over such massive changes in population and the resulting government presence and policies sparked more Miao and Yao revolts in 1464 to 1466, which were crushed by an army of 30,000 Ming troops (including 1,000 Mongols) joining the 160,000 local Guangxi (see Miao Rebellions (Ming dynasty)). After the scholar and philosopher Wang Yangming (1472–1529) suppressed another rebellion in the region, he advocated single, unitary administration of Chinese and indigenous ethnic groups in order to bring about sinification of the local peoples.|$|E
5|$|Old-style serif typefaces by Garamond and {{his colleagues}} finally fell out of use {{altogether}} {{with the arrival of}} what is now called the Didone style of printing in the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, promoted by the Didot family in France and others. This favoured a much more geometric, constructed style of letter which could show off the increasingly refined paper and printing technologies of the period. Mosley comments: The upheavals of the Revolution coincided with the <b>major</b> <b>shift</b> in the style of printing types that is associated with the family of Didot, and the stock of old materials abruptly lost its value, except as scrap. Punches rust, and the copper of matrices is recyclable. All traces of the early types that had been {{in the hands of the}} trade typefounders like Le Bé, Sanlecque and Lamesle in Paris vanished completely. No relics of them were saved anywhere, except in commercial centres that had become relative backwaters, like Antwerp, where the Plantin-Moretus printing office piously preserved the collection of its founder... the term caractères de l'Université became attached by default to the set of apparently early matrices that had survived, its provenance forgotten, in the mixed stock of materials of the national printing-office.|$|E

5|$|With {{the onset}} of the Great Depression in the 1930s, the {{governors}} again began to reassert authority. The Executive Reorganization Act was passed, returning the governor to a considerable level of appointment power. New state welfare and regulatory agencies were placed directly under the governor's control, greatly expanding his role in running the state and creating a large number of patronage positions. The legislature responded by trying to create a merit system for public offices, but it was largely unable to effectively enforce it given the new scope of government agencies. The battle with the governor continued until 1941, when the legislature rescinded the Executive Reorganization Act and replaced it with the State Administration Act, which placed most of the government under the control of elected commissioners and reduced the governor's practical executive authority to commander of the militia and the executor of legislation. The matter was taken to the Indiana Supreme Court in the case of Tucker v. State. The court ruled {{for the first time that}} the governor was in fact the Chief Executive of the state, and that the legislature could pass no law that infringed upon that right. The decision was a <b>major</b> <b>shift</b> from previous court decisions and granted governors a legal basis to resist future encroachment on their powers.|$|E
