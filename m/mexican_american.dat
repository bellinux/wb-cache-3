40|$|Using Census and CPS data, we {{show that}} U.

In addition, the non-Mexican spouses of intermarried <b>Mexican</b> <b>Americans</b> possess relatively high levels of schooling and English proficiency, compared to the spouses of endogamously married <b>Mexican</b> <b>Americans.</b> The human capital selectivity of Mexican intermarriage generates corresponding differences in the employment and earnings of <b>Mexican</b> <b>Americans</b> and their spouses. Moreover, the children of intermarried <b>Mexican</b> <b>Americans</b> are {{much less likely to}} be identified as Mexican than are the children of endogamous Mexican marriages. These forces combine to produce strong negative correlations between the education, English proficiency, employment, and earnings of Mexican-American parents and the chances that their children retain a Mexican ethnicity. Such findings raise the possibility that selective ethnic "attrition" might bias observed measures of intergenerational progress for <b>Mexican</b> <b>Americans.</b> Migration...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{reports the}} {{findings}} from an epidemiological survey conducted in California using the Health Opinion Survey (HOS), a measure of psychoneuroticism, {{as well as other}} scales and inventories. Uncontrolled results indicate that <b>Mexican</b> <b>Americans</b> have higher symptom and case levels, but that these differences are found primarily among marginally acculturated and immigrant respondents. HOS caseness levels were 15. 4 for Spanish-speaking <b>Mexican</b> <b>Americans,</b> 6. 6 for English-speaking <b>Mexican</b> <b>Americans,</b> and 5. 5 for other Whites. Joint effects of ethnicity for sex, age, education, and marital status were substantial, however there were differences in caseness between Spanish-speaking <b>Mexican</b> <b>Americans,</b> English-speaking <b>Mexican</b> <b>Americans,</b> and other Whites on four measures of psychological distress. The results indicate the importance of acculturation-related factors, including educational attainment, language preference, and nativity for predicting symptomatology among <b>Mexican</b> <b>Americans...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this ethnographic {{study was to explore}} the {{understanding}} of pre-diabetes and the possibility of developing diabetes among <b>Mexican</b> <b>Americans</b> at the U. S. -Mexico border. This study also explored how <b>Mexican</b> <b>Americans</b> adjust to living with pre-diabetes. While extensive research has been conducted regarding pre-diabetes, diabetes, and how individuals perceive their susceptibility to these illnesses, few studies have examined how <b>Mexican</b> <b>Americans</b> understand pre-diabetes and the possibility of developing diabetes. The increased prevalence of diabetes among this population, the divergent understandings of risk held by diverse cultural groups, and the large presence of <b>Mexican</b> <b>Americans</b> in the U. S. -Mexico border region prompted this study. There are gaps in the literature about how <b>Mexican</b> <b>Americans</b> understand pre-diabetes and their possibility of developing diabetes. Current literature focuses on studies of causality, folk beliefs, symptoms, and treatments. Current studies do not provide a framework in which healthcare professionals can identify how <b>Mexican</b> <b>Americans</b> understand pre-diabetes and the possibility for developing diabetes or how to incorporate these lay understandings into their practice, research, and education. An ethnographic study, guided by Freire's framework (2000) was conducted to provide insight into the understanding of pre-diabetes and the possibility of developing diabetes among <b>Mexican</b> <b>Americans</b> living at the U. S. -Mexico border. An overarching theme Living with Pre-diabetes emerged. This theme emerged from two major themes: 1) Awareness; and 2) Adjusting to Living with Pre-diabetes. This study revealed that <b>Mexican</b> <b>Americans</b> may not understand pre-diabetes or their possibility of developing diabetes until told of having pre-diabetes by a healthcare provider. Becoming aware of pre-diabetes may not necessarily imply understanding of what pre-diabetes is. The study also revealed that an awareness of having pre-diabetes may lead to changes in lifestyle, but may not always make these changes sustainable. The use of Freire's framework may prove useful when addressing the needs of <b>Mexican</b> <b>Americans</b> with pre-diabetes...|$|R
5|$|Chicago-area Latino groups contested the {{legislative}} district {{map of the}} Illinois General Assembly in United States federal court.

Berrios {{was one of three}} candidates who filed nominating petitions to run in the Democratic primary, but Berrios ran unopposed when the petitions of the other two candidates were successfully challenged. Republicans fielded no candidate in their primary, so Berrios ran unopposed in the general election, and at the age of 30 became the first Hispanic American to serve in the Illinois General Assembly. Berrios ran for re-election unopposed in the Fall 1986 general election. He won re-election twice, serving three two-year terms.|$|E

Her principal Mr. Welch suggests that she {{sign up for the}} Crenshaw Schoolwide Spelling Bee. She follows his advice and wins. Soon after, Dr. Joshua Larabee, a visiting English professor and Mr. Welch's friend from college, tests Akeelah and decides that she is good enough to compete in the National Spelling Bee. Nevertheless, Dr. Larabee declines to coach her because she is rude to him. As a result, Akeelah studies on her own to prepare for the district spelling bee. Although Akeelah misspells her word during the final round of the bee, she qualifies for the regional bee when Kiana catches the other finalist cheating. Akeelah also meets and befriends Javier Mendez, a 12-year-old <b>Mexican</b> <b>American</b> boy and fellow speller.

40|$|This study {{evaluates the}} effects of {{prenatal}} care classification and levels of maternal risk status on pregnancy outcomes in <b>Mexican</b> <b>Americans</b> and non-Hispanic whites in Arizona. All live birth certificates from 1986 and 1987 were reviewed yielding a total population of 101, 206 (26, 827 <b>Mexican</b> <b>Americans).</b> The adequacy of prenatal care was evaluated based on an index that includes six prenatal care groups. Two levels of maternal risk status (low and high) were defined based {{on a series of}} maternal risk factors. Overall, <b>Mexican</b> <b>Americans</b> had a greater proportion of maternal risk factors and a greater proportion of mothers with inadequate or no prenatal care compared with non-Hispanic whites. Prematurity and macrosomia were more prevalent than low birthweight in <b>Mexican</b> <b>Americans.</b> Low-risk status and adequate prenatal care regardless of ethnicity were found to be associated with a lower prevalence of low birthweight and preterm delivery. Whites, however, had a greater variation in the prevalence of low birthweight associated with changes in prenatal care utilization and maternal risk status compared with <b>Mexican</b> <b>Americans.</b> Finally, logistic regression analysis showed an independent effect of prenatal care, maternal risk status, maternal age, and maternal birthplace in predicting the overall low birthweight rate in <b>Mexican</b> <b>Americans.</b> The implications of these results are discussed relative to the usefulness of prenatal care as a health-care intervention in <b>Mexican</b> <b>Americans...</b>|$|R

5|$|Both fighters' {{victories}} on April 12 {{cleared the}} way for a July 26 showdown between Cotto and Margarito. The WBA welterweight title fight took place at the MGM Grand Las Vegas, marking the first time Cotto headlined a Las Vegas card. It was Cotto's first fight in Las Vegas since December 11, 2004, on the undercard of Vitali Klitschko's bout with Danny Williams. According to Bob Arum, the match took place in Las Vegas to promote Cotto to a new audience while also appealing to Margarito's <b>Mexican</b> <b>American</b> fans in California. The Las Vegas notion gained momentum in the previous month when the Nevada Athletic Commission amended its provisional rules on glove size, allowing welterweights to wear 8ounce (227g) gloves instead of the previously mandated 10ounce (284g) gloves. Nearly every other boxing jurisdiction in the United States allows welterweights to fight with 8ounce gloves, and both Cotto and Margarito likely would have refused to fight in Las Vegas without their usual glove size. Margarito had to vacate the IBF welterweight title after the IBF mandated him to defend the title against Joshua Clottey. Press conferences were held in Mexico, Los Angeles, New York City, and Puerto Rico to promote the world title bout.|$|E

5|$|William Lindsay Brandon {{was born}} to Irishman Gerard Brandon, {{a veteran of the}} American Revolution, in either 1801 or 1802 in Adams County, Mississippi. Brandon's exact birth date cannot be {{determined}} as his family records were destroyed in an 1831 fire. He settled in Wilkinson County, Mississippi near Pinckneyville in 1824. The following year, Brandon married Ann Davis. This union produced two children, however, both Davis and her children would soon die. Brandon was educated at Washington College (now Washington and Lee University) in Virginia, and the College of New Jersey (now Princeton University) where he studied medicine. In his antebellum career, he became a planter, highly interested in horses and hunting. In 1826, Brandon served in the Mississippi State Legislature, around the same time that his brother Gerard Brandon was serving as the governor of Mississippi. In 1828, Brandon founded the Kelter Club, a gentlemen's club populated by propertied men from the Natchez area of Mississippi and from West Feliciana Parish in Louisiana. In 1833, Brandon married Ann Eliza Ratliff, having three sons, William, Lane William and Robert, all of whom later served in the Confederate States Army. A fourth son, Eugene, {{died at the age of}} two. Brandon enlisted for service in the <b>Mexican</b> <b>American</b> War, and become a major general in the local militia. Because of his medicinal expertise, Brandon was consulted often by professionals in the field. When Brandon's wife died in 1840, he continued to take care of her plantation, as well as his own Arcole Plantation. By 1860, Brandon owned a considerable amount of property, including $14,000 in real estate and $64,000 in personal property, as well as 63 slaves and 16 slave quarters.|$|E
