5|$|In {{order to}} give its astronauts {{experience}} before these programs started, the Blue Gemini program was proposed, which would have seen USAF astronauts fly on NASA <b>missions</b> in order to practice various techniques required for their own <b>missions.</b> This would have first seen cooperative <b>missions</b> between NASA and the US Air Force, with two <b>missions</b> flying with crews composed of one astronaut from NASA, and one from the USAF, followed by two <b>missions</b> with all-USAF crews, but performing <b>missions</b> for NASA. After these flights, the US Air Force would have flown a number of <b>missions</b> of its own. Firstly, it would have flown a two-man Agena rendezvous and docking mission, followed by two one-man scientific or technology research <b>missions.</b> Other proposed <b>missions</b> included tests of the Astronaut Mobility Unit {{which was designed to}} assist with EVAs, inertial navigation systems, and flying a radar imaging system.|$|E

Characters also typically have cell phones which they sometimes receive calls on during <b>missions.</b> Some <b>missions</b> involve sniping using first-person shooter gameplay. These <b>missions</b> resemble the use of a sniper rifle during normal <b>missions</b> but the player cannot switch to a third-person view.|$|E

5|$|Just Cause 2 is a third-person action-adventure game {{in which}} players control Rico Rodriguez, a major {{operative}} of the Agency, {{in an effort to}} overthrow the island dictatorship of Panau: an open world for players to explore. The game has three types of <b>missions.</b> Agency <b>missions</b> advance the story and are the game's main campaign; faction <b>missions</b> task players to assist the game's three factions, and stronghold <b>missions</b> task players to infiltrate government bases and liberate them for the factions. To advance through the campaign <b>missions</b> a player must earn chaos points, a progression system introduced in the game. Players earn chaos points for completing <b>missions</b> and destroying designated government property. As the number of chaos points increases, the factions gain influence and the government begins to collapse. In addition to typical <b>missions,</b> Just Cause 2 has race challenges which give players cash.|$|E
5|$|<b>Missions</b> are tasks {{undertaken}} by a clan. There are {{four types of}} missions: regular, encounter, dispatch, and area. In regular <b>missions,</b> Marche's entire party ventures to a particular location to do battle. Many of these <b>missions</b> are used to advance the story. In encounter <b>missions,</b> Marche's group battles a rival mercenary clan by purchasing a mission or meeting them on the map. In dispatch <b>missions,</b> which do not involve battle, Marche temporarily sends away one member from his party. Area <b>missions</b> are usually a dispatch mission where Marche's clan can liberate certain regions to obtain bonuses and discounts at shops.|$|E

5|$|Of necessity, the RAAF's two northerly area {{commands}} {{were primarily}} responsible for bombing and air defence, while the other commands focussed on maritime patrol and anti-submarine warfare.

By April, the command was operating seven combat units: No.5 Squadron, flying army cooperation <b>missions</b> with CAC Wirraways out of Kingaroy, Queensland; No.23 Squadron, flying dive-bombing <b>missions</b> with Wirraways from Lowood, Queensland; No.24 Squadron, flying dive-bombing <b>missions</b> with Wirraways from Bankstown, New South Wales; No.32 Squadron, flying reconnaissance and bombing <b>missions</b> with Lockheed Hudsons from Camden, New South Wales; No.71 Squadron, flying maritime reconnaissance and anti-submarine <b>missions</b> with Avro Ansons from Lowood; No.73 Squadron, flying maritime reconnaissance and anti-submarine <b>missions</b> with Ansons from Nowra, New South Wales; and No.83 Squadron, flying fighter <b>missions</b> with Wirraways from Strathpine, Queensland. Area headquarters staff numbered 626, including ninety-nine officers. Bristol Beauforts of No.32 Squadron were credited with damaging a Japanese submarine on 19June, but neither the RAAF nor the Royal Australian Navy was able to destroy any enemy submarines in coastal waters during 1943.|$|E

5|$|The single-player mode lets players control three characters: Michael De Santa, Trevor Philips and Franklin Clinton—criminals whose stories {{interconnect}} as they complete <b>missions.</b> Some <b>missions</b> {{are completed}} {{with only one}} character and others feature two or three.

The game may switch characters automatically during <b>missions</b> to complete certain objectives. A character's compass avatar will flash red if he is in danger and needs help, and flash white if he has a strategic advantage. Though players complete <b>missions</b> as any of the three protagonists, the more difficult heist <b>missions</b> require aid from AI-controlled accomplices with unique skill sets like computer hacking and driving. If an accomplice survives a successful heist, they take a cut from the cash reward and may be available for later <b>missions</b> with improvements to their unique skills. There are multiple options for completing heists; in a holdup mission, players may either stealthily subdue civilians with an incapacitating agent or conspicuously storm the venue with guns drawn.|$|E
