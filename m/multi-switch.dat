30|$|Considering the {{significance}} of crowbar switching time, various switching schemes are proposed [5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11]. In [5], switching-off before fault recovery is recommended to reduce the crowbar operation time and quickly restore {{the control of the}} RSC, but the risk of DC-link over voltage still exists. The switching scheme proposed in [6] activates the crowbar both at the occurrence and recovery of the grid fault respectively, and each time the crowbar operation is limited by a minimum current threshold to reduce the total operation time. The switching schemes proposed in [7, 8] enable <b>multi-switching</b> of the crowbar, and the activation and the deactivation of the crowbar are dependent on the rotor current [7] or the DC-link voltage [8]. The crowbar only operates for several times when the current or voltage exceeds the pre-set threshold to limit the total operation time. According to the codes of the power grid, if a grid fault is very severe, the time for the wind turbines maintaining their connection is relatively short. Hence some other schemes for short fault conditions, such as [9, 10, 11], suggest switching-off after the voltage recovery. Due to the relatively short crowbar activation time, these schemes can obtain preferable transient performance at the acceptable cost of reactive power consumption. Reference [9] reveals that the switching-off after the voltage recovery for 1 or 2 cycles could obtain ideal dynamic performance. And different switching schemes are compared in [10]. In order to further reduce reactive power consumption, the grid side converter (GSC), together with DC-link, can supply reactive power supply during the crowbar operation [10, 11].|$|R
40|$|Membrane {{guanylate}} cyclase (MGC) is a ubiquitous <b>multi-switching</b> cyclic GMP generating signaling machine linked with countless physiological processes. In mammals it is encoded by seven distinct homologous genes. It {{is a single}} transmembrane spanning multi-modular protein; composed of integrated blocks and existing in homo-dimeric form. Its core catalytic domain (CCD) module is a common transduction center where all incoming signals are translated into the production of cyclic GMP, a cellular signal second messenger.

Here, we define it at a sub-molecular level for the phototransduction-linked MGC, the rod outer segment {{guanylate cyclase}} type 1, ROS-GC 1. (1) The CCD is a conserved 145 -residue structural unit, represented by the segment V 820 -P 964. (2) It exists as a homo-dimer and contains seven conserved catalytic elements (CEs) wedged into seven conserved motifs. (3) It also contains a conserved 21 -residue neurocalcin δ-modulated structural domain, V 836 -L 857. (4) Site-directed mutagenesis documents {{that each of the}} seven CEs governs the cyclase’s catalytic activity. (5) In contrast to the soluble and the bacterium MGC which use Mn 2 +-GTP substrate for catalysis, MGC CCD uses the natural Mg 2 +-GTP substrate. (6) Strikingly, the MGC CCD requires anchoring by the Transmembrane Domain (TMD) to exhibit its major (∼ 92 %) catalytic activity; in isolated form the activity is only marginal.

40|$|Parity games form an {{intriguing}} family of infinitary payoff games whose solution {{is equivalent to}} the solution of important problems in automatic verification and automata theory. They also form a very natural subclass of mean and discounted payoff games, which in turn are very natural subclasses of turn-based stochastic payoff games. From a theoretical point of view, solving these games {{is one of the few}} problems that belong to the complexity class NP intersect coNP, and even more interestingly, solving has been shown to belong to UP intersect coUP, and also to PLS. It is a major open problem whether these game families can be solved in deterministic polynomial time. Policy iteration is one of the most important algorithmic schemes for solving infinitary payoff games. It is parameterized by an improvement rule that determines how to proceed in the iteration from one policy to the next. It is a major open problem whether there is an improvement rule that results in a polynomial time algorithm for solving one of the considered game classes. Linear programming is one of the most important computational problems studied by researchers in computer science, mathematics and operations research. Perhaps more articles and books are written about linear programming than on all other computational problems combined. The simplex and the dual-simplex algorithms are among the most widely used algorithms for solving linear programs in practice. Simplex algorithms for solving linear programs are closely related to policy iteration algorithms. Like policy iteration, the simplex algorithm is parameterized by a pivoting rule that describes how to proceed from one basic feasible solution in the linear program to the next. It is a major open problem whether there is a pivoting rule that results in a (strongly) polynomial time algorithm for solving linear programs. We contribute to both the policy iteration and the simplex algorithm by proving exponential lower bounds for several improvement resp. pivoting rules. For every considered improvement rule, we start by building 2 -player parity games on which the respective policy iteration algorithm performs an exponential number of iterations. We then transform these 2 -player games into 1 -player Markov decision processes ii which correspond almost immediately to concrete linear programs on which the respective simplex algorithm requires the same number of iterations. Additionally, we show how to transfer the lower bound results to more expressive game classes like payoff and turn-based stochastic games. Particularly, we prove exponential lower bounds for the deterministic switch all and switch best improvement rules for solving games, for which no non-trivial lower bounds have been known since the introduction of Howard’s policy iteration algorithm in 1960. Moreover, we prove exponential lower bounds for the two most natural and most studied randomized pivoting rules suggested to date, namely the random facet and random edge rules for solving games and linear programs, for which no non-trivial lower bounds have been known for several decades. Furthermore, we prove an exponential lower bound for the switch half randomized improvement rule for solving games, which is considered to be the most important <b>multi-switching</b> randomized rule.

Explicit forms of outer and inner bounds of the rate regions are derived by assuming additional side information, and they are shown to be tight in some special cases. An optimal rate and power allocation scheme that maximizes the sum rate is also proposed. The numerical results reveal the impacts of side information, channel correlation and PU activity on the achievable rates, and also verify the effectiveness of our rate and power allocation scheme.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedIn contrast to traditional networks, Software Defined Networking (SDN) allows the programming of network functions via an Application Programming Interface (API). The ability {{to implement the}} APIs in software is advantageous for traffic manipulation in SDN. With automated logic being programmed into a centralized component of the SDN, network operators are presented with new and scalable methods for traffic manipulation. Enterprises and Internet Service Providers of all sizes can implement these techniques to great effect. Of particular concern are large state-owned providers. A motivation for this thesis came from a case study on China's Great Cannon and how the operators redirect benign traffic via content injection. In a technically similar fashion, we implemented targeted redirection on a software-defined network. Our experimentation demonstrates how an owner of the network can use man-in-the-middle (MiTM) techniques to redirect the traffic of unknowing users. To enable these techniques we wrote a MiTM application to redirect targeted users to a malicious server. Within a <b>multi-switch</b> test bed, our experimental results show that forcing our MiTM application to pass the injected response packet on a directed path to the switch closest to the targeted destination reduces the overall response time. In addition to testing for a route that would reduce overall HTTP response times, we illustrate the technical requirements of the attack in our MiTM taxonomy.

40|$|Previous {{research}} on consistent updates for distributed network configurations {{has focused on}} solutions for centralized networkconfiguration controllers. However, such work {{does not address the}} complexity of modern switch datapaths. Modern commodity switches expose opaque configuration mechanisms, with minimal guarantees for datapath consistency and with unclear configuration semantics. Furthermore, would-be solutions for distributed consistent updates must take into account the configuration guarantees provided by each individual switch - plus the compositional problems of distributed control and <b>multi-switch</b> configurations that considerably transcend the single-switch problems. In this paper, we focus on the behavior of individual switches, and demonstrate that even simple rule updates result in inconsistent packet switching in multi-table datapaths. We demonstrate that consistent configuration updates require guarantees of strong switch-level atomicity from both hardware and software layers of switches - even in a single switch. In short, the multiple-switch problems cannot be reasonably approached until single-switch consistency can be resolved. We present a hardware design that supports a transactional configuration mechanism, and provides packet-consistent configuration: all packets traversing the datapath will encounter either the old configuration or the new one, and never an inconsistent mix of the two. Unlike previous work, our design does not require modifications to network packets. We precisely specify the hardwaresoftware protocol for switch configuration; this enables us to prove the correctness of the design, and to provide well-specified invariants that the software driver must maintain for correctness. We implement our prototype switch design using the NetFPGA- 10 G hardware platform, and evaluate our prototype against commercial off-the-shelf switches...|$|E
