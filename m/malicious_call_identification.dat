50|$|Malicious caller <b>identification</b> facility, also <b>called</b> <b>malicious</b> <b>call</b> trace or caller {{activated}} <b>malicious</b> <b>call</b> trace, when subscribed or enabled, {{works by}} allowing {{a phone call}} recipient to mark or flag the preceding phone <b>call</b> connection as <b>malicious</b> (i.e. harassing, threatening, obscene, etc.) The phone system will then automatically trace the call by flagging station to station billing and routing data including start and end times. The call trace is not dependent upon call duration (as envisioned in dramatic movie plots) and will record all meta-data regardless of source conditions - even if the call was made from an unlisted number, a payphone or a number with caller identification disabled. To protect privacy the resulting trace data is only made available to law enforcement.|$|R
50|$|Many {{application}} developers compose SQL {{statements by}} concatenating strings {{and do not}} use prepared statement; {{in this case the}} application is susceptible to a SQL injection attack. The technique transforms an application SQL statement from an innocent SQL <b>call</b> to a <b>malicious</b> <b>call</b> that can cause unauthorized access, deletion of data, or theft of information.|$|R
50|$|Malicious caller identification, {{activated}} by Vertical service code Star codes *57, is an upcharge fee subscription service offered by telephone company providers which, when dialed immediately after a <b>malicious</b> <b>call,</b> records meta-data for police follow-up. A police report must be filed after each use, as law enforcement will only {{act on the}} trace once a formal police report is filed {{in regard to the}} call.|$|R
50|$|There {{are four}} fire {{stations}} within the London Borough of Ealing. Southall and Northolt have similar-sized station grounds and both house two pumping appliances. Southall attended some 700 incidents {{more than their}} Northolt counterparts in 2006/07. Ealing, with two pumping appliances, and Acton, one pump and two fire investigation units, are the other two appliances in the area. Interestingly, the ward of Northfield had over forty <b>malicious</b> <b>calls</b> made from it, {{more than twice as}} any other ward within Ealing.|$|R
30|$|Recently, {{telecommunications}} fraud detection {{has become}} a hot research direction gradually. Some researchers have used blacklisting and whitelisting methods to prevent telecommunications fraud (Jiang et al. 2012; Zhang & Fischer-Hubner  2011; Patankar et al.  2008; Wang et al. 2007). More researchers use machine learning techniques {{to determine if they}} are malicious. They extract a variety of features for <b>malicious</b> <b>call</b> detection, and most of the features include telephone numbers, call-time, domain names, call networks, and the actions of listeners and callers, etc. (Kolan et al. 2008; Azad & Morla  2011; Azad & Morla 2013; Jiang et al  2013; Leontjeva et al. 2013; Rebahi & Sisalem 2005; Rebahi et al. 2006; Sorge & Seedorf 2009; Srivastava & Schulzrinne 2004; Wang et al. 2013; Wu et al. 2009; Zhang and Gurtov 2009). In 2015, Subudhi and Panigrahi (2015) published their research on telecommunication fraud using the features of a telephony communication as the input and Quarter-Sphere Support Vector Machine to distinguish fraudulent calls. The input features include call duration, call type, call frequency, location and time, and it has achieved good recognition accuracy. Then, in 2017, they used a type of C-means clustering for telecommunication fraud detection again (Subudhi and Panigrahi 2017), and got a good result as well. Coincidently, Li et al. (2018) published an article on telecommunication fraud detection in recently as well. They used machine learning algorithm to detect <b>malicious</b> <b>calls,</b> and they extracted features of calls just similar to S. Subudhi et al. It seems difficult for these approaches to detect fraudulent calls with unlabeled new numbers. On the other hand, the researches on the content of conversations are rare. The work of Miramirkhani et al. (2017) is representative, and they conducted the research on the technical support scams. They recorded and analyzed the voice content of the phishing telephone fraud and malicious webpages which triggered such scams. Though they eventually put forward simple functions to help users keep away from malicious web pages, their approach did not help avoiding <b>malicious</b> <b>calls</b> directly.|$|R

To make it more manageable, we follow [17] and divide identification into two subcategories: identification with radical action and identification with a role model. Group identification is considered {{an essential part of the}} radicalization of lone wolves as well as organized terrorists.|$|R

30|$|A novel {{two-stage}} fraud {{detection system}} in mobile telecom networks {{has been presented}} in this paper that identifies the <b>malicious</b> <b>calls</b> among the normal ones in two stages. Initially, a genetic algorithm-based optimized fuzzy c-means clustering is applied to the user’s historical call records for constructing the calling profile. Thereafter, the identification of the fraudulent calls occurs in two stages. In the first stage, each incoming call is passed to the clustering module that identifies the <b>call</b> as genuine, <b>malicious</b> or suspicious. This is done by comparing the distance value of the new calling instance from the profile cluster centers against two predefined threshold values. The calls detected as genuine or malicious are not further processed. However, the call records that are found to be suspicious are additionally scrutinized in the second stage by a previously trained group method of data handling model for final decision making. The legitimate and forged labeled call records generated out of the clustering module are utilized for training the supervised classifier. Experimentation is done on a real-world call dataset to exhibit the effectiveness of the proposed model. A comparative analysis of the current approach with one of our earlier propositions and another recent fraud detection system clearly illustrates the efficacy of the developed model.|$|R
