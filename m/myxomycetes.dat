5|$|Twenty-one {{species from}} several orders of slime molds (<b>myxomycetes)</b> have been {{isolated}} from the bark of Banksia menziesii. Over half (13) were from the order Stemonitales, and Echinosteliales and Liceales were also common. The abundance {{of the first two}} orders {{may be due to the}} acidity of the bark.

5|$|Unlike true fungi, {{the cell}} walls of oomycetes contain {{cellulose}} and lack chitin. Hyphochytrids have both chitin and cellulose. Slime molds lack a cell wall during the assimilative phase (except labyrinthulids, {{which have a}} wall of scales), and ingest nutrients by ingestion (phagocytosis, except labyrinthulids) rather than absorption (osmotrophy, as fungi, labyrinthulids, oomycetes and hyphochytrids). Neither water molds nor slime molds {{are closely related to}} the true fungi, and, therefore, taxonomists no longer group them in the kingdom Fungi. Nonetheless, studies of the oomycetes and <b>myxomycetes</b> are still often included in mycology textbooks and primary research literature.|$|E

5|$|The species grows only on {{slightly}} to heavily rotten and barkless deadwood in coniferous forests in cool, moist areas. The wood is about 40 to 100% overgrown with Marchantiophyta, {{especially of the}} genera Nowellia or Cephalozia. B.minutissima has been found growing on the liverwort Lepidozia reptans, although Nowellia curvifolia is the main indicator for the slime mould. In addition to liverworts, Barbeyella is found socialised with monocellular algae. It is assumed that the protoplasmodium phagocytises either the algae or the bacteria on their surface. Other Myxogastria species are often found together with Barbeyella, especially Lepidoderma tigrinum, Lamproderma columbinum and Colloderma oculatum. Aphanocladium album is a myxomyceticolous fungus (i.e., living on or within the fruit bodies of <b>myxomycetes)</b> that has been reported growing on specimens of B.minutissima collected from North Carolina.|$|E
5|$|Fossil {{records of}} Myxogastria are {{extremely}} rare. Due to their short lifespan and the fragile {{structures of the}} plasmodia and the fruit body, fossilisation and similar processes are not possible. Only their spores can be mineralised. The few known examples of fossilised living states are preserved in amber. Up to 2010, three fruit bodies, two spores and one plasmodium have been described. Two older taxaCharles Eugène Bertrand's <b>Myxomycetes</b> mangini and Bretonia hardingheni from 1892are now considered dubious and are today often disregarded. Friedrich Walter Domke described in 1952 a 35 to 40million year old find in Baltic amber of Stemonitis splendens, an extant species. The state and completeness of the fruit bodies are remarkable, enabling accurate determination. From the same period, location and material is an Arcyria sulcata, first described in 2003 by Heinrich Dörfelt and Alexander Schmidt, a species very similar to today's Arcyria denudata. Both discoveries imply that the fruit bodies of the Myxogastria have changed only slightly in the last 35 to 40million years.|$|E

25|$|Slugs from {{different}} families are fungivores. It {{is the case}} in the Philomycidae (e. g. Philomycus carolinianus and Phylomicus flexuolaris) and Ariolimacidae (Ariolimax californianus), which respectively feed on slime molds (<b>myxomycetes)</b> and mushrooms (basidiomycetes). Species of mushroom producing fungi used as food source by slugs include milk-caps, Lactarius spp., the oyster mushroom, Pleurotus ostreatus and the penny bun, Boletus edulis. Other species pertaining to different genera, such as Agaricus, Pleurocybella and Russula, are also eaten by slugs. Slime molds used as food source by slugs include Stemonitis axifera and Symphytocarpus flaccidus. Some slugs are selective towards certain parts or developmental stages of the fungi they eat, though this is very variable. Depending on the species and other factors, slugs eat only fungi at specific stages of development. Moreover, in other cases, whole mushrooms can be eaten, without any selection or bias towards ontogenetic stages.|$|E

500|$|From 1874 to 1876, Jósef Tomasz Rostafinski, {{a student}} of Anton de Bary, {{published}} the first extensive monography of the group.

These were groundbreaking works about the Myxogastria, as was the 1934 book The <b>Myxomycetes</b> by Thomas H. Macbride and George Willard Martin. Important works in the late 20th century were the 1969 monographs by George Willard Martin and Constantine John Alexopoulos, and the 1975 monograph by Lindsay Shepherd Olive.

500|$|A {{characteristic}} that places fungi {{in a different}} kingdom from plants, bacteria, and some protists is chitin in their cell walls. Similar to animals, fungi are heterotrophs; they acquire their food by absorbing dissolved molecules, typically by secreting digestive enzymes into their environment. Fungi do not photosynthesise. Growth is their means of mobility, except for spores (a few of which are flagellated), which may travel through the air or water. Fungi are the principal decomposers in ecological systems. These and other differences place fungi in a single group of related organisms, named the Eumycota (true fungi or Eumycetes), which share a common ancestor (form a monophyletic group), an interpretation that is also strongly supported by molecular phylogenetics. This fungal group is distinct from the structurally similar <b>myxomycetes</b> (slime molds) and oomycetes (water molds). The discipline of biology devoted {{to the study of}} fungi is known as mycology (from the Greek μύκης mykes, meaning [...] "fungus").

Ethionine and S-ethyl cysteine were good methionine antagonists.

40|$|A new, {{simple method}} for the {{isolation}} of actin from <b>myxomycete</b> plasmodia has been devel-oped. Plasmodium myosin B was incubated at 55 °C for 15 min {{in the presence of}} ATP or was treated with 90 % acetone. By this treatment myosin was denatured completely. Actin was then extracted with a dilute ATP and cysteine solution from the heat- or acetone-treated myosin B. The method is simple and almost pure actin was obtained in high yield. The purified G-actin polymerized to F-actin on addition of 0. 1 M KC 1 or 2 mM MgCli. The viscosity of the purified F-actin was 8 - 10 dl/g. The F-actin activated muscle myosin ATPase, and actomyosin synthesized from the F-actin and muscle myosin showed superprecipi-tation on addition of ATP. We have isolated actin from acetone-dried plas-modia of a <b>myxomycete</b> (Physarum polycephalum) using the specific binding of plasmodium actin to muscle myosin (7, 2).

60|$|IV. Professor Haeckel {{proposes a}} number of {{modifications}} in Taxonomy, {{all of which are}} well worthy of consideration. Thus he establishes a third primary division of the living world, distinct from both animals and plants, under the name of the Protista, to include the <b>Myxomycetes,</b> the Diatomaceae, and the Labyrinthulae, which are commonly regarded as plants, with the Noctilucae, the Flagellata, the Rhizopoda, the Protoplasta, and the Monera, which are most generally included within the animal world. A like attempt has been made, by other writers, to escape the inconvenience of calling these dubious organisms by the name of plant or animal; but I confess, it appears to me, that the inconvenience which is eluded in one direction, by this step, is met in two others. Professor Haeckel himself doubts whether the Fungi ought not to be removed into his Protista. If they are not, indeed, the <b>Myxomycetes</b> render the drawing of every line of demarcation between Protista and Plants impossible. But if they are, who is to define the Fungi from the Algae? Yet the sea-weeds are surely, in every respect, plants. On the other hand, Professor Haeckel puts the sponges among the Coelenterata (or polypes and corals), with the double inconvenience, as it appears to me, of separating the sponges from their immediate kindred, the Protoplasta, and destroying the definition of the Coelenterata. So again, the Infusoria possess all the characters of animality, but it can hardly be said that they are as clearly allied to the worms as they are to the Noctilucae.|$|E
60|$|What {{is meant}} by my being caught by a {{generalisation}} about the physical basis of life I do not know; still less can I understand the assertion that Bathybius was accepted because of its supposed harmony with Darwin's speculations. That which interested me in the matter was the apparent analogy of Bathybius with other well-known forms of lower life, such as the plasmodia of the <b>Myxomycetes</b> and the Rhizopods. Speculative hopes or fears {{had nothing to do}} with the matter; and if Bathybius were brought up alive from the bottom of the Atlantic to-morrow, the fact would not have the slightest bearing, that I can discern, upon Mr. Darwin's speculations, or upon any of the disputed problems of biology. It would merely be one elementary organism the more added to the thousands already known.|$|E
60|$|There {{is reason}} to think that certain organisms which pass through a monad stage of existence, such as the <b>Myxomycetes,</b> are, at one time of their lives, {{dependent}} upon external sources for their protein matter, or are animals; and, at another period, manufacture it, or are plants. And seeing that the whole progress of modern investigation is in favour of the doctrine of continuity, it is a fair and probable speculation--though only a speculation--that, as there are some plants which can manufacture protein out of such apparently intractable mineral matters as carbonic acid, water, nitrate of ammonia, metallic and earthy salts; while others need to be supplied with their carbon and nitrogen in the somewhat less raw form of tartrate of ammonia and allied compounds; so there may be yet others, as is possibly the case with the true parasitic plants, which can only manage to put together materials still better prepared--still more nearly approximated to protein--until we arrive at such organisms as the Psorospermioe and the Panhistophyton, which are as much animal as vegetable in structure, but are animal in their dependence on other organisms for their food.|$|E
40|$|Unlike other bacteria, aerobic {{members of}} the order Actinomycetales show a close {{biochemical}} relationship to the fungi by their capacity to synthesize hercynine and ergothioneine.

40|$|The {{content of}} myosin in plasmodia of the <b>myxomycete</b> Physarum polycephalum was {{measured}} by an immunological technique, quantitative microcomplement (C') fixation.
