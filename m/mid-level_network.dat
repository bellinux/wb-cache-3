The following year the National Science Foundation also awarded Global SchoolNet a grant to introduce a desktop video-conferencing program called CU-SeeMe. CU-SeeMe was used for many educational video-conferences and in 1995 by World News Now for the first television broadcast live on the Internet, which featured an interview by World News Now anchor Kevin Newman and Yvonne Andrés.|$|E

The CERFnet network was founded in January 1988 by Susan Estrada, received partial funding of $2.8 million by the National Science Foundation a year later, and was fully operational by November 1989, linking together 38 California research centers. The network was operated by the SDSC and General Atomics.|$|E

40|$|Tese doutoramento do Programa Doutoral em TelecomunicaçõesDecades of {{evolution}} in communication network’s {{resulted in a}} high diversity of solutions, {{not only in terms}} of network elements but also in terms of the way they are managed. From a management perspective, having heterogeneous elements was a feasible scenario over the last decades, where management activities were mostly considered as additional features. However, with the most recent advances on network technology, that includes proposals for future Internet as well as requirements for automation, scale and efficiency, new management methods are required and integrated network management became an essential issue. Most recent solutions aiming to integrate the management of heterogeneous network elements, rely on the application of semantic data translations to obtain a common representation between heterogeneous managed elements, thus enabling their management integration. However, the realization of semantic translations is very complex to be effectively achieved, requiring extensive processing of data to find equivalent representation, besides requiring the administrator’s intervention to create and validate conversions, since contemporary data models lack a formal semantic representation. From these constrains a research question arose: Is it possible to integrate the con g- uration management of heterogeneous network elements overcoming the use of manage- ment translations? In this thesis the author uses a network service abstraction to propose a framework for network service management, which comprehends the two essential management operations: monitoring and configuring. This thesis focus on describing and experimenting the subsystem responsible for the network services configurations management, named <b>Mid-level</b> <b>Network</b> Service Configuration (MiNSC), being the thesis most important contribution. The MiNSC subsystem proposes a new configuration management interface for integrated network service management based on standard technologies that includes an universal information model implemented on unique data models. This overcomes the use of management translations while providing advanced management functionalities, only available in more advanced research projects, that includes scalability and resilience improvement methods. Such functionalities are provided by using a two-layer distributed architecture, as well as over-provisioning of network elements. To demonstrate MiNSC’s management capabilities, a group of experiments was conducted, that included, configuration deployment, instance migration and expansion using a DNS management system as test bed. Since MiNSC represents a new architectural approach, with no direct reference for a quantitative evaluation, a theoretical analysis was conducted in order to evaluate it against important integrated network management perspectives. It was concluded that there is a tendency to apply management translations, being the most straightforward solution when integrating the management of heterogeneous management interfaces and/or data models. However, management translations are very complex to be realized, being its effectiveness questionable for highly heterogeneous environments. The implementation of MiNSC’s standard configuration management interface provides a simplified perspective that, by using universal configurations, removes translations from the management system. Its distributed architecture uses independent/universal configurations and over-provisioning of network elements to improve the service’s resilience and scalability, enabling as well a more efficient resource management by dynamically allocating resources as needed...|$|E

It defines electronic mail, explains how it works, and describes academic networks that provide electronic mail services, especially BITNET and NSFNET. It explains how university administrators use electronic mail and networks for day-to-day communication, for making data requests, for conducting surveys of colleagues, and for exchanging information with interest groups. Also explained are procedures for getting connected to a network, costs of network membership, and suggestions for using the networks efficiently and eZfectively.

40|$|The Carnatic and Tamil {{music scene}} in London {{is the result}} of the {{migration}} and diasporic formation of a displaced Sri Lankan Tamil demographic. From the 'scattering' of displaced people and culture to various localities around the world, diasporic 'regatherings' – understood as 'becoming one again' - are facilitated by musical learning, performance and transnational interactions. Through the process of 'becoming one again' and the on-going connections between South Asia and the diaspora, a musical scene has emerged, which relies on various transnational networks and constructions of collective identity. The thesis examines the transnational networks and identities in the Sri Lankan Tamil diaspora, focusing on musicians, music students and audiences based in London, and their connections with South Asia and other parts of the world. Drawing on detailed ethnographic research in the UK, South India and Sri Lanka, it considers how music enables deep connections to be formed within a diasporic group, both in terms of physical networks and within the imaginations of musicians. The relevance of the terms 'diaspora' and 'transnationalism' are examined in relation to the musical networks and processes in the Carnatic music scene in chapter one, before considering the historical trajectory of cultural identity, migration and the emergence of the music scene in London in chapter two. Chapter three identifies the scope of transnational networks at three different levels – the macro-level transnational <b>networks,</b> <b>mid-level</b> local manifestations of these networks and finally the micro-level interactions between individuals and within a performance. These levels ground broader globalising processes in localised ethnography. Across the multiple levels explored in the third chapter it is clear that the connections with Chennai in South India create a cultural centre and alternative homeland for displaced Sri Lankan Tamil musicians. Chapter four positions Chennai as the centre of this musical network from where aesthetics are negotiated and projected outwards into diasporic localities. Chapter five considers the London locality and the performance contexts, conventions and audiences within the city. In London, there are two clear spheres of local engagement – the diasporic and multicultural mainstream, contrasting in contexts, publics and functions. Chapters six and seven reflect on connectivity through historically situated narratives and transnational synchrony. These issues are ethnographically explored through the arangetram music graduation ceremony and through embodied experiences of transnational musical learning and performance. It is argued that transnational connectivity - with the cultural centre, other diasporic sites and the transnational carnatic music world - is maintained through ritualised practices of musical learning and performance. The thesis highlights the ways in which connectivity is maintained through the construction of an essentialised, yet empowered, transnational cultural identity in which South Indian classical music is a key component. It aims to contribute to the study of diasporas and musical transnationalism through shifting the focus from the 'homeland' to other cultural centres, and by emphasising the importance of ritualised musical practice in attaining diasporic connectivity...|$|R
