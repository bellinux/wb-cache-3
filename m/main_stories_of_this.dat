The 2-1/2 <b>story</b> <b>main</b> block <b>of</b> <b>this</b> wood frame house was built c. 1750, and is a typical Georgian five-bay center-chimney structure.

50|$|The decor is 20th-century small-town America {{from about}} the years 1890-1910. Though being {{very similar to}} Anaheim's <b>main</b> street, the <b>story</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> street is heavily {{influenced}} by European immigrants.

40|$|Lillian Hellman is {{well known}} as a moral writer. In her work of art, she used to {{describe}} human evil and injustice. She was deeply stirred by all injustice and spoke out against them (Mc Graw). In most of her works, the good one is always defeated by the evil, {{not the other way}} around. It makes her being called as `'The Hanging Judge of The American Theatre" (Vinson, p. 376). In this thesis, the writer uses The Children's Hour as her primary source. The play is very interesting since it is about a little girl whose name is Mary who likes to tell lies. One of her lies is accusing her teachers as lesbian couple that destroys their lives. That is why the writer wants to know the motives of Mary's lies. Then, the writer is also curious to find out the effects of her lies to the main and minor characters in the play. In order to help the thesis writer in writing the thesis, literary tools, like characterization and conflict are needed as the main data. The characterization is important to understand the real character of the main central character. Meanwhile, conflict is needed to develop further about the characterization through the characters' interaction toward each other. Moreover, since the <b>main</b> <b>story</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> play is about lies, some psychological tools are also needed as supporting data to know the motives of Mary's lies, such as lies, freedom, and punishment. Finally, it is seen that Man_- is motivated to tell lies, because she wants to be sent back home since she feels that she is not free, she wants to take revenge on her teachers for being punished all the time, and her efforts to get sympathy from other people. All the reasons above ruin the main and minor characters' lives. Karen's, Joseph's, Mary's friends, and Martha's futures are destroyed, moreover, they are looked down and isolated by the society, Mrs. Mortar is also encouraged to take revenge to Martha, Martha's hatred to her aunt gets stronger, then she finally decides to end her life. Finally, Mary's lies put Mrs. Tilford's life in darkness {{for the rest of her}} life...|$|R

[...] Spector also revealed that the game was to include voice acting and musical numbers, both of which were absent in the first game. Spector said: [...] "I'm such a geek about musicals, I love the co-op and next-gen stuff, but for me, when a character breaks into song, which they do on a regular basis in this game, it's magic." [...] Spector also commented on the sequel's co-op features, stating that: [...] "It's drop-in, drop-out co-op, you can sit down at any time with a friend who is playing as Mickey, and you can take control of Oswald. If you're playing as a single player, Oswald will be there every second of the game. He's not just a multiplayer character. He's a helper, whether you're playing alone or with a friend or family member." [...] Wasteland itself will feature old areas ruined by earthquakes and other natural disasters, as well as new areas such as one based on Disneyland's Frontierland.|$|R
50|$|Liu Yongfu outlived the Qing dynasty {{and survived}} {{into the second}} {{decade of the twentieth}} century, his {{reputation}} growing with the passing years:He continued until the closing years of the dynasty in the employment of the Kwangtung provincial administration, and {{is said to have been}} a notable suppressor of bandits and a pacifier of clan feuds, those twin curses of the south China countryside. The advent of the Republic in 1912 found him in retirement, listening with interest to the news of public affairs as others related it to him from the papers, for he himself never learned to read. Most of the time, though, his mind dwelt in the past. He would take out Garnier’s watch and show the picture of the young wife inside the cover. He would tell of his challenge to Rivière and describe the battle at Paper Bridge. But he soon wearied of the incomprehensible foreign devils, and turned instead to what for him had been beyond comparison the most serious business of his life. The talk would then be all of the Black and Yellow Flags, and of the long years of feuds and hatreds in the steaming malarial jungle and on the silent reaches of the great river. His published memoirs, for his reminiscences were reverently taken down in writing, have as their <b>main</b> theme the <b>story</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> interminable vendetta between expatriate Chinese. But when he died, in January 1917, it was as the scourge of a foreign enemy, the hero whose achievements were nullified by the cowardice of his own government, that he was mourned by his countrymen, and that is the way they still remember him.|$|R
