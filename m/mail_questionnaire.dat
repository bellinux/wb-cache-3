Participants from both countries were divided into a <b>mail</b> <b>questionnaire</b> group of 300 each and a structured interview group of 12 each. Despite the relatively low response rates of 20 % in the <b>mail</b> <b>questionnaire</b> group, the major findings were supported from the structured interviews. Results showed that there were similarities in practitioner training, applicability of therapy models, handling of religious issues and self-disclosure.

40|$|Two {{purposes}} of this study were to describe selected characteristics of cooperating teachers/ schools and to identify teachers ’ perceptions about important elements of student teaching. Some researchers contend that to better understand complex phenomena, a “soft systems” approach (e. g., focus groups) may be more appropriate than quantitative methodologies. So, another purpose was to compare teachers ’ perceptions when determined by focus groups and by a <b>mail</b> <b>questionnaire.</b> Five teacher focus groups provided the perceptions (35 teachers; 23 schools); each group represented a “core ” area of student teaching. Thirty-four elements were identified as being “important. ” Then, via a <b>mail</b> <b>questionnaire,</b> teachers rated the elements using a Likert-type rating scale (“ 5 ” = “High Importance,”…“ 1 ” = “No Importance”); return rate was 89 % for teachers. Cronbach’s reliability estimates for importance ratings of the “core areas ” ranged from. 49 to. 86; overall reliability was. 91. Items were perceived to have “much ” or “high importance ” (overall M = 4. 54). “A well rounded program emphasizing instruction, SAEs, and youth leadership activities ” received the highest rating (M = 5. 00). Teachers ’ ratings by <b>mail</b> <b>questionnaire</b> confirmed their earlier perceptions, thus supporting the assertion that a “soft systems ” approach can be useful when examining a complex phenomenon...|$|E

40|$|The <b>mailed</b> <b>questionnaire</b> {{research}} process developed historically {{as part of}} the survey research movement, with guidelines and models drawn from an array of scientific research methods and disciplines. Although the <b>mailed</b> <b>questionnaire</b> {{has become one of the}} most popular research instruments for obtaining data beyond the reach of the observer, the response bias generated from the generally low return rate of the <b>mailed</b> <b>questionnaire</b> survey has remained a problem. For over three decades researchers have generated a plethora of research on the effectiveness of the various aspects of the <b>mailed</b> <b>questionnaire</b> process and the resultant impact of various constructs on survey return. But despite these efforts, researchers have not succeeded collectively in producing a clear, compelling, or consistent set of principles that, if followed, will produce high response rates in <b>mailed</b> <b>questionnaire</b> research. With the certainty that more knowledge and constructs will be generated in all areas of the <b>mailed</b> <b>questionnaire</b> process, scholars have issued a call for a viable theory to direct future research efforts on response rates. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to address that need. The dissertation research reported in this paper accomplished five major objectives. It (a) developed an interdisciplinary theoretical framework for the <b>mailed</b> <b>questionnaire</b> process; (b) identified 13 determinants of response costs in the <b>mailed</b> <b>questionnaire</b> process; (c) proposed immediacy and salience as the most significant determinant variables of response rates, from a synthesis of the research literature with the theoretical framework; (d) proposed a theory and theoretical model that explain and illustrate the interaction of immediacy and salience in determining response rate levels; and (e) recommended a method for testing the proposed theory and for utilizing the proposed theory to achieve high response rates in future <b>mailed</b> <b>questionnaire</b> studies...|$|R
40|$|The {{comparability}} {{of information}} collected through telephone interviews and information collected through <b>mailed</b> <b>questionnaires</b> has not been well studied. As {{part of the first}} phase of a randomized controlled trial of population screening for melanoma in Queensland, Australia, the authors compared histories of skin examination reported in telephone interviews and self-administered <b>mailed</b> <b>questionnaires.</b> A total of 1, 270 subjects each completed a telephone interview and a <b>mailed</b> <b>questionnaire</b> 1 month apart in 1999; 564 subjects received the interview first, and 706 received the <b>mailed</b> <b>questionnaire</b> first. Agreement between the two methods was 91. 2 % and 88. 6 % for whole-body skin examination by a physician in the last 12 months and the last 3 years, respectively, and 81. 9 % for whole-body skin self-examination in the last 12 months. Agreement was lower for "any" skin self-examination. Agreement between the two methods was similar regardless of whether the interview or the questionnaire was administered first. Missing data were less frequent for interviews (0. 5 %) than for <b>mailed</b> <b>questionnaires</b> (3. 8 %). Costs were estimated at A$ 9. 55 (US$ 6. 21) per completed interview and A$ 3. 01 (US$ 1. 96) per questionnaire.

In addition, the study assessed whether the intention to complete the questionnaire and its eventual return by mail would increase donations through a "foot-in-the-door" (FITD) effect during Heart and Stroke Month. Three study groups which included an experimental group (the Heart Group) and two control groups (the Bell and Mail Only Groups) were established by random assignment from a randomized cluster-sample of 910 households in the City of Kanata, a satellite community west of Ottawa, Ontario.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. This study utilised both <b>mail</b> <b>questionnaire</b> and case study approaches to investigate propositions related to information technology (IT) in small firms. The major proposition investigated IT Sophistication as one cause of small firm success. Data was collected from 289 engineering firms by <b>mail</b> <b>questionnaire,</b> including 120 {{with at least one}} computer. Multiple regression analysis gave no support to IT as a success factor. Similarly, non-parametric statistical tests suggested that firms with more sophisticated IT performed no better than firms with no or less sophisticated IT. Furthermore, among only the firms with computers, many negative rather than positive correlations were found between IT variables and financial performance. Therefore, rather than support the major proposition that IT was a success factor for small firms, the <b>mail</b> <b>questionnaire</b> provided evidence to the contrary. An indepth analysis of six firms provided evidence that developing IT had, in some firms, increased operating costs and consumed important managerial time. Furthermore, there was evidence to suggest that some factors tended to encourage both IT growth and poorer performance simultaneously, which would explain the negative correlations found between IT and financial performance. Two further propositions were investigated, both relating to IT success. Using path analysis, the following factors were found to influence IT success: external assistance in identifying IT requirements, owner involvement in IT planning and in control, planning IT development, and the use of IT for many applications. However, the measure of IT success was not found to be correlated with financial performance, and this must put in question how MIS researchers should measure "success"...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} assess the {{advantages}} and disadvantages of face-to-face interviews, telephone interviews, and <b>mailed</b> <b>questionnaires,</b> 1100 clients were randomly assigned to one of these follow-up methods. All participating clients were contacted approximately 180 days after intake using a well-documented treatment outcome measure. Response rates for the telephone interview and <b>mailed</b> <b>questionnaire</b> were approximately one-half as high as the face-to-face interview, yet for each method very few client background variables were related to whether or not clients responded. The <b>mailed</b> <b>questionnaire</b> was least affected by socially desirable responses, and also cost less to administer than either of the interview methods. ver the past decade, mental health professionals have expendedagreat deal of effort to develop data collection instruments that are administered to clients upon completion of treatment (Hagedorn et al., 1976).

Those objectives were chosen because certification is a developing phenomenon of which there are some aspects that remain unknown. The survey consisted of a <b>mail</b> <b>questionnaire</b> that was sent to more than 250 hardwood flooring manufacturers.

40|$|<b>Mail</b> <b>questionnaires</b> are {{a popular}} and {{valuable}} method of data collection. Nonresponse bias is, however, a potentially {{serious threat to}} their validity. The best way to combat this threat is to obtain the highest possible return rate. To this end, many factors that are believed to influence return rates have been empirically studied. One factor {{that has not been}} empirically examined is the impact of item response effort on return rates, where response effort is defined as the amount of effort that is required by a respondent to answer questionnaire items. The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine if the type of item response effort required to complete a questionnaire had any differential impact on the response rate of a <b>mailed</b> <b>questionnaire.</b> For this study, two questionnaires that differed only in the level of item response effort were sent to two randomly selected and assigned groups. The first group received a <b>mailed</b> <b>questionnaire</b> with seven questions that were answered by a simple item response type (5 -point Likert scale). The second group received a <b>mailed</b> <b>questionnaire</b> with seven questions that required a more difficult item response type (short answer). A large difference between the return rates of the two questionnaires was observed, with the questionnaire containing questions that could be answered on a Likert scale having a higher return rate (56 %) than the questionnaire containing questions requiring a short written response (30 %). The results of this study provide evidence that the difficulty of item response effort affects the response rate of <b>mailed</b> <b>questionnaires.</b> The practical application of this finding is that researchers should endeavor to keep the types of item response on <b>mailed</b> <b>questionnaires</b> as simple as possible, to maximize response rates (unless, of course, the needed information can only be elicited by providing written responses) ...|$|R

Design: The study consisted of a <b>mail</b> <b>questionnaire</b> supplemented by face-to-face interviews. Participants: Forty-five physicians who follow up patients with DMD through Canadian neuromuscular clinics. Measurements: A <b>mail</b> <b>questionnaire</b> of 66 closed-ended questions related to practice and attitudes was completed by all respondents.

Results: The results indicated that 25. 0 % of physicians do not discuss LTV with all of their DMD patients. The most frequently cited reason for advising against LTV was poor patient quality of life (52. 6 %). Three themes emerged from the qualitative data: mentioning and discussing LTV are discrete events with different purposes, nighttime and full-time LTV decisions are approached differently, and physicians modify their discussions to influence outcome...|$|E
