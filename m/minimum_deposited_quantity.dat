50|$|On 10 December, De Nederlandse Bank (DNB, the Dutch central bank) {{started to}} refund the {{deposited}} amounts to depositors up {{to a maximum}} amount of €100,000 per person. For this operation, DNB hired sixty temporary employees who were housed {{on the second floor}} of the Bank's headquarters. With around 120,000 paper files being handled on this floor, lying around in crates, DNB realised the floor was not capable of holding this amount of weight and the entire department had to be moved. The repayment liability for the Dutch state according to the Dutch <b>minimum</b> <b>deposit</b> guarantee scheme equalled €1.6bn out of a total of €1.67bn being lost by Dutch retail customers (of which €1.33bn equalled the Icelandic <b>minimum</b> <b>deposit</b> guarantee liabilities, ultimately to be covered by either Tryggingarsjóður or the Icelandic state). The repayment liability for the British state according to the British <b>minimum</b> <b>deposit</b> guarantee scheme equalled £3.5bn out of a total of £4.53bn being lost by British retail customers (of which £2.2bn equalled the Icelandic <b>minimum</b> <b>deposit</b> guarantee liabilities, ultimately to be covered by either Tryggingarsjóður or the Icelandic state).|$|R

50|$|In {{addition}} to the offered bailout loans for the Icelandic state, there was also at that point of time three special loans from Germany + UK + Netherlands, being offered to Iceland and earmarked for the repayment of <b>minimum</b> <b>deposit</b> guarantees to those account-holders having lost their private savings because of the systemic bankruptcy of Icelands three leading banks. It was rumoured that Iceland would refuse the loan offered by the UK and Netherlands, as those two loans were only earmarked for the repayment of <b>minimum</b> <b>deposit</b> guarantees to the Icesave bank, which was a foreign branch of the now bankrupt Landsbanki, and thus Iceland felt {{it was not the}} Icelandic states responsibility to guarantee/pay for the payment of such <b>minimum</b> <b>deposit</b> guarantees to the British and Dutch savers, and apparently instead preferred to leave them unpaid while referring them to legal proceedings over the alleged failure of British and Dutch watchdogs for the financial services sector.|$|R
50|$|On 18 November, {{once the}} IMF Board had {{approved}} its emergency loan, the UK and Netherlands agreed {{in addition to}} lend Iceland respectively £2.2 billion (€2.6bn) and €1.3 billion, earmarked for the coverage of Icelandic <b>minimum</b> <b>deposit</b> guarantees for the UK and Dutch Icesave retail depositors. Likewise, Germany also agreed to lend Iceland €1.1 billion, earmarked for the coverage of Icelandic <b>minimum</b> <b>deposit</b> guarantees for the German Kaupthing Edge retail depositors. The repayment conditions were however still subject of further negotiation with EU involvement. The Dutch government confirmed on 20 November that its loan to Iceland had been finalised. The settlement of the €5bn earmarked <b>minimum</b> <b>deposit</b> guarantee loans, {{at the same time}} paved the way not only for the US$2.1bn IMF bailout loan, but also for a transfer of some bilateral bailout loans for the Icelandic state, with $2.5bn being transferred by Denmark + Sweden + Norway + Finland, $0.2bn from Poland, $0.05bn from Faroes Island.|$|R

50|$|In December 2009, the Althing, voting almost {{strictly}} by {{party lines}} (with two defections from the governing {{parties to the}} opposition), narrowly (33-30) passed {{a new version of}} the Icesave bill formally entitled Act 1/2010 being an amendment of the former Act 96/2009, to agree with British and Dutch demands in the Icesave dispute. The bill would make it possible for Britain and the Netherlands to recoup the €4bn of <b>minimum</b> <b>deposit</b> guarantees, which they had paid on behalf of the money drained Icelandic <b>minimum</b> <b>deposit</b> guarantee fund to the British and UK Icesave customers who had lost all their savings with the bankruptcy of Landsbanki in October 2008. The two governments would receive payments over the next 14 years after compensating the losses of more than 320,000 of the bank's customers. In the UK, deposits of up to £50,000 per account holder had been guaranteed by the British government under the Financial Services Compensation Scheme. The British and Dutch governments had in fact at this point of time already repaid in full, all the lost €6.7bn of deposits belonging to UK and Dutch retail customers, which was beyond the liability stipulated by their <b>minimum</b> <b>deposit</b> guarantee schemes, and now with Icesave bill 2 only requested the Icelandic state to guarantee, that the British and Dutch government over a 15-year period at least would receive a repayment equal to the applying Icelandic <b>minimum</b> <b>deposit</b> guarantees, which totaled €4bn.|$|R
5000|$|One month {{ahead of}} the vote, the Landsbanki {{receivership}} (LBI) published a quarterly financial status, where its total recovery of assets was estimated to equal roughly 96% (ISK 1263bn/1319bn) of all priority claims towards the receivership, which implied a full repayment of all <b>minimum</b> <b>deposit</b> guarantees already {{by the end of}} 2013, due to their first priority status within the [...] "priority claims". Assuming this estimate was correct, then the Icelandic state with Icesave bill 3 would only be liable in 2016 to conduct repayments to the British and Dutch states, for the accrued 3.2% interests related to the delayed repayment of <b>minimum</b> <b>deposit</b> guarantees in 2009-13.|$|R
50|$|The dispute {{centred on}} the demand by the British and Dutch {{states that the}} Icelandic state should repay the Icelandic <b>minimum</b> <b>deposit</b> {{guarantees}} (up to €20,887 per account holder), equal to £2.35bn (€2.7bn) repaid to the UK and €1.3bn repaid to the Netherlands.|$|R
50|$|As the {{bankruptcy}} of Landsbanki was one of 3 big systemically important financial institutions going bankrupt {{within a few days}} in Iceland, the Tryggingarsjóður however had already been drained from capital reserves, and had no money left to repay the legally required €4.0bn of <b>minimum</b> <b>deposit</b> guarantees to the 343,306 foreign retail customers from United Kingdom and Netherlands, who had lost all their €6.7bn of deposits in the Icesave branch of Landsbanki. Because nothing was expected immediately to be repaid by any Icelandic institutions/authorities, both the Dutch and British state decided to step in and cover all these account losses in full; while however at the same time demanding the Icelandic state should sign a loan guarantee agreement concerning repayment of the €4.0bn of Icelandic <b>minimum</b> <b>deposit</b> guarantees plus accrued interests. Subsequently the terms for these loan guarantee agreements were negotiated between the states in the so-called Icesave bills, where Iceland to meet its obligations was offered a £2.35bn (€2.7bn) loan by UK and a €1.3bn loan by the Netherlands. Repayment of the €4.0bn of <b>minimum</b> <b>deposit</b> guarantees, was supposed to happen partly/entirely through the liquidation of remaining positive assets by the Landsbanki receivership in 2009-2015, with the Icelandic state only to overtake/guarantee for the potential remaining repayments in 2016.|$|R

40|$|This study explores how {{price and}} non-price factors {{influence}} {{change in the}} quantity of short-term retail deposits held by depository institutions. The analysis is undertaken for a sample of UK building societies over 23 years using a disaggregated data set with a two-stage econometric procedure involving system estimators in a panel framework using seemingly unrelated regression, generalised method of moments and an ordinary least-square fixed effects estimators to control for contemporaneous correlation and endogeneity concerns. Price factors examined include the policy or base rate and retail deposit interest rates set by individual building societies and non-price factors including the branch network {{and the number of}} deposit accounts offered by individual building societies. The cost of funds, one non-price factor and occurrence of mergers are consistently significant influences of retail <b>deposit</b> <b>quantities.</b> We conclude risk assessment of retail <b>deposit</b> <b>quantity</b> and monetary policy transmission would benefit from considering both price and non-price factors, rather than only price factors...|$|R

5000|$|Icelandic {{voters were}} asked to vote yes/no for Icesave bill 3. Ahead of the vote, the Landsbanki {{receivership}} (LBI) published a quarterly financial status, that estimated its total recovery of assets would equal roughly 96% (ISK 1263bn/1319bn) of all priority claims towards the receivership, which implied a full repayment of all <b>minimum</b> <b>deposit</b> guarantees already {{by the end of}} 2013, due to their first priority status within the [...] "priority claims".

50|$|In regards of the {{responsible}} {{authority for the}} monitoring and control of financial activities performed by the Icesave bank, it was however later established this {{had always been the}} sole responsibility of the Icelandic Financial Supervisory Authority (FME) with the <b>minimum</b> <b>deposit</b> guarantees also to be covered by the Icelandic Depositors' and Investors' Guarantee Fund, because the Icesave bank had been established as a foreign branch by the Icelandic Landsbanki. The foreign authorities would only have had the responsibility to monitor and control the Icesave bank, if it had been established as an independent UK/Dutch subsidiary being fully owned by Landsbanki. Thus it was only the Icelandic authorities having a legal responsibility in the case, and this fact alone emphasized the need for a solution about the payment of <b>minimum</b> <b>deposit</b> guarantees to the Dutch and British Icesave account holders, either to be reached with the Icelandic state or the Icelandic Depositors' and Investors' Guarantee Fund.|$|R
30|$|MECHANISM is {{a measure}} of the {{interest}} rate on deposits (price based), a measure of the amount of <b>deposits</b> (<b>quantity</b> based), or a measure of time terms (maturity based). The main explanatory variable is bank risk, usually based on the five categories of the CAMEL methodology: capital adequacy, asset quality, management quality, earnings and liquidity. X represents other control variables. Thus, a significant coefficient of bank risk, with the theoretical expected sign, indicates the presence of market discipline.|$|R

40|$|Despite the Central Bank of Nigeria’s (CBN) {{initiatives}} to encourage banks {{to extend their}} services and facilities to rural areas, {{a high percentage of}} the rural dwellers still remain unbanked and as such, the initiatives appear not to promote financial inclusion services among the poor in Nigeria. As a result, small entrepreneurs often lack enabling financial environment to grow. The study undertakes an empirical analysis of the impact of microfinance in promoting financial inclusion in Nigeria between 1990 and 2014 using OLS regression method. Unit root test was conducted on the variables to examine their level of stationary to avoid spurious regression results. The findings showed that <b>minimum</b> <b>deposit</b> amount have a positive and significant relationship with saving.

50|$|In their {{evaluation}} of the ongoing IceSave dispute, the EFTA Surveillance Authority (ESA) decided on 26 May 2010, that the Icelandic government was bound to pay the (<b>minimum)</b> <b>deposit</b> guarantee to all Icesave customers. As the UK and Dutch governments had already paid savers in their countries, Iceland was therefore liable to reimburse these governments. Additionally, EFTA criticised Iceland for the difference in treatment of international and domestic accounts. Iceland was given two months to respond.
