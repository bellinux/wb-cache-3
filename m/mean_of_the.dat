25|$|Often, {{outliers}} are erroneous data {{caused by}} artifacts. In this case, {{one can use}} a truncated mean.

25|$|This is an {{approximate}} equation, but holds with good accuracy.

25|$|To empirically {{estimate}} the expected {{value of a}} random variable, one repeatedly measures observations of the variable and computes the arithmetic <b>mean</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> results.

The law of large numbers demonstrates (under fairly mild conditions) that, as the size of the sample gets larger, the variance of this estimate gets smaller.|$|E
