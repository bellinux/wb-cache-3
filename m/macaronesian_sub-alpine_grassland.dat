40|$|Abstract: The {{texture of}} a plant community, i. e. the range of values in {{functional}} characters across the species present, integrates the ecological and evolutionary processes {{that have led to}} that community’s present species composition. The idealistic prediction of ecological theory is that selection for co-adaptation and competitive sorting will lead to convergence in texture between different patches of vegetation with the same environment. This concept has previously been applied at the continental scale; here it is applied {{for the first time at}} a withincommunity scale. Three communities were sampled, all in Fiordland, New Zealand: a predominantly native heathland, a floodplain grassland largely dominated by exotic species but with a considerable native component, and a native <b>sub-alpine</b> <b>grassland</b> with shrubs. The same five functional characters were measured in each community: height, leaf area, specific leaf area, leaf thickness and support fraction. In all three communities, to varying degrees, there was evidence of texture divergence in height, either in the mean or in the distribution. Tall species tended to associate with other tall species, and short species with other short ones. In the <b>sub-alpine</b> <b>grassland,</b> significant texture convergence occurred in leaf area, i. e. each patch tended to comprise a mixture of some small-leaved species and some large-leaved species.

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to {{investigate}} how plant species’ composition, soil parameters and nutrient concentrations in plant biomass differ between fertilized and control plots 62 years after the last fertilizer application on a <b>sub-alpine</b> <b>grassland.</b> A piece of land called the Grass Garden (GG), fertilized with wood ash and manure for at least 200 years, was rediscovered in the Giant Mts. (Krkonoše, Karkonosze) in 2006. The last fertilization was applied in 1944. The central part of GG (treatment A), the edge of GG (treatment B) and never-fertilized control plots outside of GG (treatment C) were distinguished. Sixty-two years after the last fertilization Nardus stricta was dominant in treatment C and Deschampsia cespitosa and Avenella flexuosa in treatments A and B. The predominance of these grasses was first described in 1786 and repeatedly during the 19 th and 20 th centuries and indicated the long-term stability of plant species’ composition in the <b>sub-alpine</b> <b>grassland.</b> In the case of GG, long-term fertilization has had a long-term “stable after-effect” upon differences in plant species’ composition. Ca concentration in the soil was more than two times higher in treatments A and B than in the control, indicating that it was very difficult to deplete applied Ca even on extreme podzol soils and under the climatic conditions of the sub-alpine vegetation belt.

Plant growth and consequently grassland yields depend strongly on water supply {{during the growing}} season, which is projected {{to change in the}} future. We therefore investigated the effect of summer drought on the water uptake of an intensively managed lowland and an extensively managed <b>sub-alpine</b> <b>grassland</b> in Switzerland. Summer drought was simulated by using transparent shelters. Standing above- and belowground biomass was sampled during three growing seasons. Soil and plant xylem waters were analyzed for oxygen (and hydrogen) stable isotope ratios, and the depths of plant water uptake were estimated by two different approaches: (1) linear interpolation method and (2) Bayesian calibrated mixing model. Relative to the control, aboveground biomass was reduced under drought conditions. In contrast to our expectations, lowland grassland plants subjected to summer drought were more likely (43 - 68 %) to rely on water in the topsoil (0 - 10 cm), whereas control plants relied less on the topsoil (4 - 37 %) and shifted to deeper soil layers (20 - 35 cm) during the drought period (29 - 48 %). <b>Sub-alpine</b> <b>grassland</b> plants did not differ significantly in uptake depth between drought and control plots during the drought period. Both approaches yielded similar results and showed that the drought treatment in the two grasslands did not induce a shift to deeper uptake depths, but rather continued or shifted water uptake to even more shallower soil depths.

From 2011 to 2015, their effects on vegetation structure and pastoral value of forage were assessed along permanent transects. Four years after treatments, both practices were effective in reducing the shrub cover and increasing the cover and average height of the herbaceous layer, but changes were more remarkable within TNCA. Moreover, the arrangement of TNCA decreased the cover of nanophanerophytes and increased the cover of graminoids and high quality species, as well as the overall forage pastoral value.

The present study assessed the spatiotemporal patterns and trends of rangelands using satellite remote-sensing time-series data. Moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) -based normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) data, collected at fortnightly intervals over 12 years (2001 - 2012), were used as a proxy for the vegetation conditions of the grasslands. The analysis revealed that rangeland productivity increased with increasing elevation up to the sub-alpine zone, which had a higher productivity than the moist temperate zone and humid sub-tropical zone. The high sub-alpine productivity was attributed to seasonal amplitude and the extended length of the growing season in the phenological cycle. In the temporal analysis of productivity, the majority of the area exhibited improvements in vegetation conditions, which were strongest in the humid sub-tropical zones and weakest in the alpine zones. The <b>sub-alpine</b> <b>grasslands</b> were found to be the most productive and heterogeneous habitat; however, the relatively strong negative temporal trend in productivity in this zone indicates ongoing degradation in these rangelands.

40|$|Of all the {{suggested}} causes of extinction or near extinction of certain species of avifauna only that invoking alteration of habitat following upon climatic change is satisfactory {{to explain the}} shrinkage of takahe range (G. R. Williams, 1960). Summary: The takahe (Notornis mantelli), an endangered rail once widely distributed through New Zealand, had become restricted to Fiordland, and possibly Nelson and the Ruahine Ranges, by European times. Two contentious viewpoints have been advanced to explain the decline: climate and vegetational changes in the late Pleistocene and Holocene; and ecological changes induced by early Polynesians. These theories are examined {{in relation to the}} habitat requirements of takahe in its present restricted range, the historical and sub-fossil record, and the possible age of the sub-fossils. We conclude that the takahe is a specialised tussock grassland feeder adapted to the alpine region and that it is unlikely to have changed these feeding adaptations since the last glacial period of the Pleistocene; that the widespread sub-fossil distribution occurred in the glacial periods of the Pleistocene when alpine and <b>sub-alpine</b> <b>grassland</b> covered most of New Zealand; and that replacement of grassland and scrubland by forest when the climate ameliorated in the late Pleistocene-Holocene would have reduced takahe habitat restricting the bird to certain localities where it was vulnerable to hunting by Polynesians when they colonised New Zealand...|$|R
40|$|The {{exchange}} of gaseous elemental mercury (GEM) over a <b>sub-alpine</b> <b>grassland</b> in central Switzerland was measured over a full year. Seasonal and diurnal variability were measured with two micrometeorological techniques: the aerodynamic method and the modified Bowen ratio method. With these two methods mean deposition rates of 4. 3 and 1. 7 ng m(- 2) h(- 1) were calculated throughout the vegetation period. As no significant GEM exchange occurred under snow covered conditions the mean annual deposition fluxes reached 2. 9 and 1. 1 ng m(- 2) h(- 1), respectively. A fair weather period in October 2005 {{was selected to}} specifically study diurnal patterns of GEM exchange. During this time vertical day-time GEM gradients averaged 0. 01 ng m(- 4) and night-time gradients 0. 07 ng m(- 4), but no clear diurnal pattern of the GEM fluxes was observed. The measured gradients were very small, which entailed considerable uncertainties in the calculated GEM fluxes. However, the observed exchange pattern is verified by the agreement of the applied methods regarding {{the direction of the}} flux and the pronounced seasonal trends. Complementary measurements of total mercury in precipitation during three rain events revealed that dry deposition of GEM would account for 67 % of a total annual input of 0. 26 g ha(- 1) and would therefore constitute a major deposition pathway.

Location: Sub-alpine pastures of the northern French Alps. Methods: Competition intensity measures how much competition decreases the performances of an organism. Competition importance measures how much competition contributes to affect performance, among other processes (such as environmental stress or disturbance). Competition intensity and importance were measured on three co-occurring species: Festuca rubra, a perennial grass, and two forbs of contrasting basal area, Chaerophyllum hirsutum and Alchemilla xanthochlora. A neighbour removal experiment was performed on Festuca rubra in three <b>sub-alpine</b> <b>grassland</b> communities differing in fertility and on Chaerophyllum hirsutum and Alchemilla xanthochlora in the two more fertile of these communities. The importance of competition was quantified using an index proposed by Brooker et al. (2005). Results: Competition intensity and importance showed different patterns of variation along the fertility gradient for Festuca rubra: competition importance decreased with decreasing fertility whereas competition intensity did not change. The largest forb was the least affected by competition. Our results suggest that {{the importance}} of competition for all three species depended on their individual tolerance to low nutrient availability. Conclusions: 1.

Some processes, such as intensive recreational use, forest fires or the expansion of artificial areas taking place inside and around them in response to their appeal, question their environmental sustainability and their efficiency. In this paper, we analyze the LUCCs that took place between 1990 and 2006 in two National Parks (NPs) belonging to the Spanish network and in their surroundings: Ordesa and Monte Perdido (Ordesa NP) and Sierra de Guadarrama (Guadarrama NP). We also simulate land use changes between 2006 and 2030 by means of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), taking into account two scenarios: trend and green. Finally, we perform a multi-temporal analysis of natural habitat fragmentation in each NP. The results show that the NPs analyzed are well-preserved and have seen hardly any significant LUCCs inside them. However, Socioeconomic Influence Zones (SIZs) and buffers are subject to different dynamics. In the SIZ and buffer of the Ordesa NP, there has been an expansion of built-up areas (annual rate of change = + 1. 19) around small urban hubs and ski resorts. There has also been a gradual recovery of natural areas, which had been interrupted by forest fires. The invasion of <b>sub-alpine</b> <b>grasslands</b> by shrubs is clear (+ 2735 ha). The SIZ and buffer of the Guadarrama NP are subject to urban sprawl in forest areas and to the construction of road infrastructures (+ 5549 ha and an annual rate of change = + 1. 20). Industrial area has multiplied by 3. 3 in 20 years. The consequences are an increase in the Wildland-Urban Interface (WUI), greater risk of forest fires and greater fragmentation of natural habitats (+ 0. 04 in SIZ). In the change scenarios, if conditions change as expected, the specific threats facing each NP can be expected to increase.

Festuca novae-zealandiae {{possesses}} some structural adaptions such as curled laminae, limited stomatal distribution, and dense trichomes characteristic of dry-land adapted species. These features {{were compared with}} those of a mesophyte, F. arundinacea. In addition to structural adaptions, evidence that metabolic changes contribute to the drought tolerance of F. novae-zealandiae was sought. Plants of F. arundinacea and F. novae-zealandiae were grown in glasshouse pots and were subjected to water-deficit. Concentrations of the phytohormone ABA and the osmoprotectants proline and glycine-betaine increased in mature laminae of F. arundinacea as SWC declined to 8 %. In F. novac-zealandiae, ABA concentration increased from 25 - 50 ng/gDW in two steps. At the first step (at 9 - 10 % SWC), the increase was greatest in leaf bases (to 150 ng/gDW), and the second increase (at 6 % SWC) was greatest in laminae (to 320 ng/gDW) and non-existent in leaf bases. In water-sufficient tillers, proline concentration was elevated in leaf bases (5 - 8 mg/ g DW) compared to laminae (2 mg/ g DW) and increased to 28 mg/ g DW in leaf bases, and to 14 mg/ g DW in laminae as SWC declined to 8 - 9 %. Glycine-betaine concentration (40 - 100 µmol/ gDW) was unchanged by water-deficit stress. Leaf and tiller counts, and estimates of leaf tip scorching indicated that leaf death progressed with increasing water-deficit. Although leaf elongation declined, it did not cease until the last tillers had died. SDS-PAGE and Western analysis of soluble proteins using antisera to ubiquitin indicated that protein turnover increased in lamina, but not in leaf bases in response to water-deficit. It was concluded that in response to water-deficit stress, leaf bases of F. novae-zealandiae retained turgor and remained viable at the expense of existing leaf laminae, which died back. Southern analysis suggested that the F. novae-zealandiae genome contains sequence(s) with homology to group 2 LEA proteins. Western analysis using antisera raised against the dehydrin consensus sequence KIKEKLPG revealed several related proteins in seeds of F. novae-zealandiae, but these were not induced by water-deficit stress in leaves...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} the impact of {{elevated}} ozone (O 3) and/or nitrogen (N) on semi-natural vegetation, with an emphasis on C-partitioning within and between plant and soil. The project reports several studies allied to the exploration of the impacts of elevated O 3 and N employing short-term studies in laboratory-based controlled-environment chambers and solardomes plus long-term studies at free-air O 3 fumigation sites in the Swiss Alps and at Keenley Fell, Northumberland, UK. A solardome study indicated that both the grass Dactylis glomerata, and the forb Ranunculus acris exhibited increased senescence, and reduced C-allocation below-ground, when exposed to elevated [O 3]. Furthermore, N exacerbated the O 3 -induced reduction in the root biomass of D. glomerata. This finding led to a mechanistic exploration of C-partitioning in response to short-term (three week) exposure of D. glomerata to a combination of elevated O 3 and N inputs in self-built fumigation chambers. Plants were pulse-labelled with 14 C, and the fate of the recent photosynthate then traced in nine plant and soil C-pools. The study revealed a reduction in below-ground respiration (incorporating root and soil microbial respiration) in high N treated plants, and a significant antagonistic interaction between O 3 and N effects on soil microbial biomass. To relate the findings to below-ground responses in an intact ecosystem, impacts of long-term O 3 and N exposure on soil microbial community diversity and C metabolism were investigated in a <b>sub-alpine</b> <b>grassland.</b> Terminal Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism (T-RFLP) analysis and Community Level Physiological Profiling (CLPP) using 14 C labelled root exudate substrates and leaf litter, revealed no effects of O 3 and N on the soil bacterial diversity, and limited impacts on C substrate turnover. Moreover, in a long-term study on a traditional UK haymeadow, three years of elevated O 3 and N inputs did not result in significant changes in above-ground biomass of any plant functional group. However, a significant O 3 x N interaction on below-ground biomass of the sward was observed with reduced root biomass in high [O 3] plots. The variation in cover of individual plant species was not explained by either O 3 or N when analysed by redundancy analysis (RDA). Overall, this study suggests that N deposition subtly modifies vegetation responses to O 3 stress and highlights the potentially significant role played by rising levels of N deposition and O 3 as drivers of changes in carbon allocation in the natural environment.

This study, conducted on <b>sub-alpine</b> <b>grasslands</b> in Gansu, China, deals with the impacts of land use on soil fertility, P dynamics, soil erosion, and above ground vegetation. Land uses include three magnitudes of pasture degradation, lightly (LDGP), moderately (MDGP), and heavily degraded pasture (HDGP), and cultivated fields varying 1 to 50 years of cultivation. Soil samples were collected from 18 sites at seven locations, from either Chemozemic or Castanozemic (Chestnut) soils lying between 2, 600 to 3, 000 in above sea level (ASL). To determine if there were any influences of pasture degradation and cultivation on soil fertility and soil erosion, nutrients-associated with macro-organic matter,total N, P, K, CEC, pH and EC were analyzed. The activity of 137 Cs was determined to estimate soil erosion as well. In HDGP, soil CEC, total C and total N dropped by 18 %, 33 %, and 28 %, respectively, on a regional scale compared to LDGP. Furthermore, cultivating grasslands significantly decreased soil CEC, organic C and total N by 21 %, 59 % and 52 %, respectively, after 30 to 50 years' cultivation. Soil pH also significantly increased with longer cultivation. With soil degradation, soil EC increased in previously saline soils, but decreased in non-saline soil. Cultivation also increased the proportion of water-soluble Na from 7 % in LDGP to 22 % of total soluble cations after 41 years' cultivation at Tianzhu-A/B. Soil erosion and mineralization of organic matter were responsible for lower soil CEC, organic C, total N, and soil macro-organic matter. The concentration of 137 CS was significantly reduced when pasture was heavily degraded, or was put into crop production. More than half of 137 Cs activity in soil was lost with 30 to 50 years' cultivation compared to LDGP. Topography and climatic differences had a great influence on soil erosion. Pasture degradation, cultivation and erosion also caused changes in soil P dynamics. Phosphorus fractionation showed that more labile P was found in LDGP compared to HDGP. Cultivation and fertilization significantly raised labile P and Ca-Pi levels. Mineralization of organic P, incorporation of sub-soil by tillage following erosion, and fertilization were major sources of Ca-Pi in cultivated fields. In general, Fe- and Al-associated Pi was higher after pasture was cultivated. Soil organic P, especially the moderately labile fraction extracted by NaOH, declined with pasture degradation and cultivation. Once pasture became heavily degraded, changes in plant species composition and plant cover were observed. A 99 % plant cover was found in LDGP, while the lowest plant cover of 62 % was observed in HDGP. The plant palatability index (PI) was developed in this study based on numbers of individual plants inside of the quadrat and their assigned numerical values. Results showed that the PI decreased from 205 in LDGP to 173 in MDGP, and then to 151 in HDGP, implying that the abundance of more palatable plants may decrease with pasture degradation, while plants with lower forage value tended to increase. Research results were extrapolated to the whole area between 2, 600 to 3, 000 m ASL in Gansu based on area estimation and land use patterns. Grassland was the major land use, accounting for 85 % of the total. Cultivated land occupied only 3. 5 % of the total, but the latter was vital to local farmers for food and feed production. Lands between 2, 600 to 3, 000 m ASL had a great potential for soil degradation. About half of the 1. 9 million ha grassland had been either moderately or heavily degraded, resulting in 22. 7 and 1. 8 million tons of C and N losses, respectively. Potentially available P loss reached 25. 8 thousand tons on grassland. Cultivating 80, 000 ha of grasslands resulted in 3. 8 million tons of C, 0. 31 million tons of N and 11. 6 thousand tons of P losses in the region...|$|R
40|$|The {{analysis}} of the vegetation and {{the landscape of the}} Simbruini mountains is presented. The Simbruini mountains are located on the Tyrrhenian side of the Central Apennines, on the border between the Lazio and Abruzzi regions; the mountain chain has a NW-SE orientation and is characterized by several peaks: Autore (1853 m), Cotento (2014 m), Tarino (1959), Viglio (2176 m) and Crepacuore (1997 m). The paper is composed of three sections. In the first one, the phytosociological and synphytosociological {{analysis of}} the vegetation is presented. In the second one, the results of an ecological classification of the landscape, aimed at identifying the main land units of the Simbruini mountains, are discussed and in the last one the landscape changes occurred between 1950 and 2000 are analysed. From a phytosociological point of view, beech woods are the most important and wider forest type of the area. Their floristic composition is typical of the calcicolous Central-Southern Apennine mountain beech woods (Cardamino kitaibelii-Fagetum sylvaticae). At lower altitudes, deciduous woods dominated by Ostrya carpinifolia with Fraxinus ornus and Acer opalus ssp. obtusatum (Melittio melissophyllae-Ostryetum carpinifoliae), or by Quercus pubescens (Cytiso sessilifolii-Quercetum pubescentis) occur, whereas at the same altitudes, on the rocky or steep slopes, Quercus ilex woods can be found. Mesophilous woods with Carpinus betulus and Corylus avellana (Carpino betuli-Coryletum avellanae) were found along deeply embanked valleys, sometimes surrounded by Quercus cerris woods with Acer opalus ssp. obtusatum (Aceri obtusati-Quercetum cerridis) on deep soils. Along the Simbrivio river banks, small patches of broadleaf ravine woods, classified in the alliance Tilio-Acerion (Aceretum obtusatipseudoplatani), can be found. The shrub vegetation is characterised by different communities dynamically linked to the woody types. In fact, shrubs characterised by Spartium junceum and Rubus ulmifolius (Spartio juncei-Cytisetum sessilifolii and Roso sempervirenti-Rubetum ulmifolii) were identified in the hilly-sub-mountain belt, whereas at higher latitudes, the pre-forest stage, characterised by Ribes uva-crispa and several species of Rosa (Ribeso uvae-crispae-Rosetum dumalis) can be found. Two kinds of juniper shrubs were identified: the first one in the sub-alpine belt with Daphne oleoides and Arctostaphylos uva-ursi (Daphno oleoidis-Juniperetum alpinae), and the second one with Juniperus communis ssp. communis in the lower mountain belt (Viburno lantanae-Juniperetum communis). The following grassland types were identified: three associations of the mountain and sub-mountain belts belonging to the endemic Apennine syntaxonomical alliance Phleo ambigui-Bromion erecti (Saturejo montanae-Brometum erecti, Anthoxantho odorati-Brachypodietum genuensis and Koelerio splendentis-Brometum erecti), therophytic grasslands (Trifolio scabri-Hypochoeridetum achyrophori), mesophilous meadows of the Molinio-Arrhenatheretea class (Colchico lusitanici-Cynosuretum cristati community with Arrhenatherium elatius), <b>sub-alpine</b> xerophytic <b>grasslands</b> with Sesleria juncifolia ssp. juncifolia and Carex kitaibeliana (Pediculari elegantis- Seslerietum tenuifoliae), sub-acid communities of the same belt belonging to the Nardetea strictae (Luzulo italicae-Nardetum strictae and Trifolio thalii-Festucetum microphyllae) and scree vegetation characterised by Galium magellense and Festuca dimorpha (Galio magellensis-Festucetum dimorphae). Moreover, two associations of the chasmophytic vegetation and calcareous rocky crevices were found (Saxifrago australis-Trisetetum bertolonii and Arenario bertolonii-Cystopteridetum alpinae). The vegetation of the woody edges was also analysed (community with Salvia glutinosa and Aegopodium podagraria), although further investigations are needed. The synphytosociological {{analysis of the}} plant communities allowed the identification of the main vegetation series: Cytiso-Querceto pubescentis sigmetum, Ciclamino Hederifolii-Querceto ilicis sigmetum, Melittio melissophyllae-Ostryeto carpinifoliae sigmetum, Cardamino kitaibelii-Fageto sylvaticae sigmetum, Carpino betuli-Coryleto avellanae sigmetum and Daphno-Junipereto alpinae sigmetum. In the second section of the paper, an ecological classification of the landscape aimed at identifying the main land units of Simbruini mountains was applied, based on a new methodology. In particular, a maximum likelihoods classifier, applied to topographical, climatic and land use variables, allowed the identification of 8 Land Units characterised by environmental, vegetational and land use variables. Finally, the landscape change of the Simbruini mountains between 1950 and 2000 was analysed. This change was analysed and quantified through the photointepretation of digital, georeferenced aero photographs of the years 1954 and 2000 and application of several landscape indexes. A significant expansion of forests common to all the Apennine chain was highlighted. This process, linked to the abandonment of the traditional selvicoltural practices, in turn, determined by the emigration of the population, in search of economic opportunities, towards the coastal areas,. The current reforestation processes can determine the homogeneity of the landscape and the disappearance of semi-natural and cultural habitats, thus threatening the survival of many species. The integrated methodological approach we presented, being based on the phytosociological and synphytosociological analysis, the ecological classification of the landscape and the analysis of its historical transformations, provides a comprehensive analysis useful for guiding environmental planning activities and for implementing conservation strategies and actions. © Italian Society for Vegetation Science...|$|R
40|$|The {{forests of}} {{south-eastern}} Australia, having evolved {{in one of}} the most fire-prone environments in the world, are characterized by many adaptations to recovery following burning. Thus forest ecosystems are characterized by rapid regenerative capacity, from either seed or re-sprouting, and mechanisms to recover nutrients volatilized, including an abundance of N 2 fixing plants in natural assemblages. Soil physical, chemical and biological properties are directly altered during fire due to heating and oxidation of soil organic matter, and after fire due to changes in heat, light and moisture inputs. In natural ecosystems, carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) lost from soil due to fires are recovered through photosynthesis and biological N 2 fixation (BNF) by regenerating vegetation and soil microbes. This study investigated post-fire recovery of soil C and N in four structurally different <b>sub-alpine</b> plant communities (<b>grassland,</b> heathland, Snowgum and Alpine ash) of south-eastern Australia which were extensively burnt by landscape-scale fires in 2003. The amount and isotopic concentration of C and N in soils to a depth of 20 cm from Alpine ash forest were assessed five years after fire in 2008 and results were integrated with measurements taken immediately prior to burning (2002) and annually afterwards. Because the historical data set, comprised of three soil samplings over the years 2002 to 2005, consisted of soil total C and N values which were determined as an adjunct to 13 C and 15 N isotopic studies, it was necessary to establish the accuracy of these IRMS-derived measurements prior to further analysis of the dataset. Two well-established and robust methods for determining soil C (total C by LECO and oxidizable C by the Walkley-Black method) were compared with the IRMS total C measurement in a one-off sampling to establish equivalence prior to assembling a time-course change in soil C from immediately pre-fire to five years post-fire. The LECO and IRMS dry combustion measurements were essentially the same (r 2 > 0. 99), while soil oxidizable C recovery by the Walkley-Black method (wet digestion) was 68 % compared to the LECO/IRMS measurements of total C. Thus the total C measurement derived from the much smaller sample size (approximately 15 mg) combusted during IRMS are equivalent to LECO measurement which require about 150 mg of sample. Both total C and N in the soil of Alpine ash forests were significantly higher than soils from Snowgum, heathland and grassland communities. The ratio of soil NH 4 + to NO 3 - concentration was greater for Alpine ash forest and Snow gum woodland but both N-fractions were similar for heathland and grassland soils. The abundance of soil 15 N and 13 C was significantly depleted in Alpine ash but both isotopes were enriched in the heathland compared to the other ecosystems. Abundance of both 15 N and 13 C increased with soil depth. The natural abundance of 15 N and 13 C in the foliage of a subset of non-N 2 fixing and N 2 fixing plants was measured as a guide to estimate BNF inputs. Foliage N concentration was significantly greater in N 2 fixers than non-N 2 fixers while C content and 13 C abundance were similar in both functional groups. Abundance of 15 N was depleted in the N 2 fixing species but was not significantly different from the non-N 2 fixers to confidently calculate BNF inputs based on the 15 N abundance in the leaves. The total C pool in soil (to 20 cm depth) had not yet returned to the pre-fire levels in 2008 and it was estimated that such levels of C would be reached in another 6 - 7 years (about 12 years after the fire). The C and N of soil organic matter were significantly enriched in 15 N and 13 C isotopes after fire and had not returned to the pre-fire levels five years after the fire. It is concluded that the soil organic N pool can recover faster than the total C pool after the fire in the Alpine ash forests.
