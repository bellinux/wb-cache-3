In the present study, we hypothesized that porous aqueous-derived silk protein scaffolds would be suitable for chondrogenic differentiation of human adipose-derived stem cells. Human adipose-derived stem cells were cultured up to 6 weeks, and cell proliferation and chondrogenic differentiation were investigated and compared with those in conventional <b>micromass</b> <b>culture.</b> Cell proliferation, glycosaminoglycan, and collagen levels in aqueous-derived silk scaffolds {{were significantly higher than}} in <b>micromass</b> <b>culture.</b> Transcript levels of SOX 9 and type II collagen were also upregulated in the cell–silk constructs at 6 weeks. Histological examination revealed that the pores of the silk scaffolds were filled with cells uniformly distributed.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Numerous {{experimental}} {{efforts have}} been undertaken to induce the healing of lesions within articular cartilage by re-establishing competent repair tissue. Adult mesenchymal stem cells have attracted attention {{as a source of}} cells for cartilage tissue engineering. The {{purpose of this study was}} to investigate chondrogenesis employing periosteal mesenchymal cells. METHODS: Periosteum was harvested from patients who underwent orthopedic surgeries. Mesenchymal stem cells were characterized through flow cytometry using specific antibodies. The stem cells were divided into four groups. Two groups were stimulated with transforming growth factor &# 946; 3 (TGF-&# 946; 3), of which one group was cultivated in a monolayer culture and the other was cultured in a <b>micromass</b> <b>culture.</b> The remaining two groups were cultivated in monolayer or micromass cultures in the absence of TGF-&# 946; 3. Cell differentiation was verified through quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and using western blot analysis. RESULT: In the groups cultured without TGF-&# 946; 3, only the cells maintained in the <b>micromass</b> <b>culture</b> expressed type II collagen. Both the monolayer and the micromass groups that were stimulated with TGF-&# 946; 3 expressed type II collagen, which was observed in both quantitative RT-PCR and western blot analysis. The expression of type II collagen was significantly greater in the micromass system than in the monolayer system. CONCLUSION: The results of this study demonstrate that the interactions between the cells in the <b>micromass</b> <b>culture</b> system can regulate the proliferation and differentiation of periosteal mesenchymal cells during chondrogenesis and that this effect is enhanced by TGF-&# 946; 3...|$|E

However, the function of COMP in chondrogenic differentiation is largely unknown. Our investigation focuses on analyzing the function of normal COMP protein in cartilage biology. Methods and results: To explore the function of COMP we make use of an in vitro model system for chondrogenesis, consisting of murine C 3 H 10 T 1 / 2 mesenchymal cells maintained as a high-density <b>micromass</b> <b>culture</b> and stimulated with bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP- 2). Under these culture conditions, C 3 H 10 T 1 / 2 cells undergo active chondrogenesis in a manner analogous to that of embryonic limb mesenchymal cells, and have been shown to serve as a valid model system to investigate the mechanisms regulating mesenchymal chondrogenesis. Our results indicate that ectopic COMP expression enhances several early aspects of chondrogenesis induced by BMP- 2 in this system, indicating that COMP functions in part to positively regulate chondrogenesis. Additionally, COMP has inhibitory effects on proliferation of cells in monolayer. However, at later times in <b>micromass</b> <b>culture,</b> ectopic COMP expression in the presence of BMP- 2 causes an increase in apoptosis, with an accompanying reduction in cell numbers in the <b>micromass</b> <b>culture.</b> However, the remaining cells retain their chondrogenic phenotype.

40|$|AbstractWe {{present a}} {{stochastic}} cellular automaton {{model for the}} behavior of limb bud precartilage mesenchymal cells undergoing chondrogenic patterning. This “agent-oriented” model represents cells by points on a lattice that obey rules motivated by experimental findings. The “cells” follow these rules as autonomous agents, interacting with other cells and with the microenvironments cell activities produce. The rules include random cell motion, production and lateral deposition of a substrate adhesion molecule (SAM, corresponding to fibronectin), production and release of a diffusible growth factor (“activator,” corresponding to TGF-β) that stimulates production of the SAM, and another diffusible factor (“inhibitor”) that suppresses {{the activity of the}} activator. We implemented the cellular automaton on a two-dimensional (2 D) square lattice to emulate the quasi- 2 D <b>micromass</b> <b>culture</b> extensively used to study patterning in avian limb bud precartilage cells. We identified parameters that produce nodular patterns that resemble, in size and distribution, cell condensations in leg-cell cultures, thus establishing a correspondence between in vitro and in silico results.

We altered the standard in vitro <b>micromass</b> <b>culture</b> by diluting the initial cell density, transiently exposing it to exogenous activator, suppressing the inhibitor, and constitutively activating fibronectin production. We altered the standard in silico <b>micromass</b> <b>culture</b> in each case by changing the corresponding parameter. In vitro and in silico experiments agreed well. We also used the model to test hypotheses for differences in the in vitro patterns of cells derived from chick embryo forelimb and hindlimb.

Here, we show that dual chondro-osteogenic differentiation can be obtained in the same <b>micromass</b> <b>culture</b> of human bone-marrow stromal cells. Human bone-marrow stromal cells were pellet cultured for 4 weeks in chondro-inductive medium.

The overexpression of Fgf 10 induced by the electroporation of an FGF 10 expression vector not only altered {{the size and shape of}} Meckel's cartilage, but also upregulated the expression of the cartilage characteristic genes Col 2 a 1 and Sox 9 in a mandibular organ culture system.

Methods—Matrix-metalloproteinase- 13 (MMP- 13) expression was ablated in primary human chondrocytes by stable retrotransduction of short-hairpin RNAs. The effects of MMP- 13 KD on key regulators of chondrocyte differentiation (Sox 9, Runx 2 and β-catenin), and angiogenesis (VEGF) were scored at the protein (immunohistochemistry or western blot) and RNA (real time PCR) levels in high density monolayer and <b>micromass</b> <b>cultures</b> under mineralizing conditions. Effects on cellular viability in conjunction with chondrocyte progression towards a hypertrophiclike state were assessed in <b>micromass</b> <b>cultures.</b> Alterations in Sox 9 subcellular distribution were assessed by confocal microscopy in <b>micromass</b> <b>cultures</b> and also in OA cartilage. Results—Differentiation of control chondrocyte micromasses progressed up to a terminal phase, with calcium deposition in conjunction with reduced cell viability and scant ECM. MMP- 13 knock-down (KD) impaired ECM remodeling and suppressed differentiation in conjunction with reduced levels of Runx 2, β-catenin and VEGF. MMP- 13 levels in vitro and ECM remodeling in vitro and in vivo were linked to changes in Sox 9 sub-cellular localization. Sox 9 was largely excluded from the nuclei of chondrocytes with MMP- 13 remodeled or degraded ECM, and exhibited an intranuclear staining pattern in chondrocytes with impaired MMP- 13 activity in vitro or with more intact ECM in vivo.

One of the best and easily accessible cell sources for this purpose is adipose-derived stem cells which can be differentiated into chondrocytes by tissue engineering techniques. Chemical and physical inducers have a key role in stem cell – chondrocyte differentiation. We have tried to determine the role of electric fields (EF) in promoting this kind of chondrogenesis process.

Human OA articular cartilage explants show decreased LXR expression, and LXRβ-null mice display OA-like symptoms. LXR agonist administration to OA articular cartilage explants suppresses proteoglycan degradation and restores LXR-activated transcription. We aimed to investigate the effect of LXR activation on chondrocyte differentiation to elucidate the molecular mechanisms behind its protection against OA. MethodThe specific LXR agonist, GW 3965, was used to examine the effect of LXR activation on chondrocyte differentiation. Tibia organ cultures were used to examine the effect of LXR activation on bone growth and growth plate morphology, followed by immunohistochemical analysis. In ATDC 5 and <b>micromass</b> <b>cultures,</b> chondrocyte differentiation was examined through cellular staining and proliferation assays. Various chondrogenic markers were analyzed by real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) in micromass RNA. ResultsChondrocyte hypertrophy was suppressed by GW 3965 treatment, as shown by decreased hypertrophic zone length in the tibial growth plate, decreased alkaline phosphatase staining in ATDC 5 and <b>micromass</b> <b>cultures,</b> and down regulation of Col 10 a 1, Mmp 13 and Runx 2 expression. Increased proliferation in treated ATDC 5 cells and up-regulation of Col 2 a 1 expression in treated <b>micromass</b> <b>cultures</b> suggest hypertrophy is suppressed secondary to prolonged proliferation. Decreased p 57 levels in treated growth plates suggest this to be due to cell-cycle exit delay.

In the developing limb bud, the expression of HMGN 1 is complementary to Sox 9, a master regulator of the chondrocyte lineage. In limb bud <b>micromass</b> <b>cultures,</b> which faithfully mimic in vivo chondrogenic differentiation, loss of HMGN 1 accelerates differentiation.

40|$|Increasing {{evidence}} indicates that heparan sulfate (HS) is an integral component of many morphogen signaling pathways. However, its mechanisms of action appear to be diverse, {{depending on the type}} of morphogen and the developmental contexts. To define the function of HS in skeletal development, we conditionally ablated Ext 1, which encodes an essential glycosyltransferase for HS synthesis, in limb bud mesenchyme using the Prx 1 -Cre transgene. These conditional Ext 1 mutant mice display severe limb skeletal defects, including shortened and malformed limb bones, oligodactyly, and fusion of joints. In developing limb buds of mutant mice, chondrogenic differentiation of mesenchymal condensations is delayed and impaired, whereas the area of differentiation is diffusely expanded. Correspondingly, the distribution of both bone morphogenic protein (BMP) signaling domains and BMP 2 immunoreactivity in the mutant limb mesenchyme is broadened and diffuse. In <b>micromass</b> <b>cultures,</b> chondrogenic differentiation of mutant chondrocytes is delayed, and the responsiveness to exogenous BMPs is attenuated.

The TGF-alpha transcripts were first detected in the neural fold of embryonic d 9 and 10 embryos. In the craniofacial region, the TGF-alpha transcripts were not detected until embryonic d 16 in mesenchyme surrounding the olfactory bulb, within the olfactory bulb, the nasal capsule, vomeronasal organ, and vibrissal follicle. In addition, TGF-alpha message was detected in mesenchyme in the vicinity of Meckel's cartilage, and in the dental epithelium and lamina. This expression pattern of TGF-alpha transcripts persisted until embryonic d 17 but disappeared by d 18. The presence of TGF-alpha protein largely coincided with TGF-alpha message although, unlike the message, it persisted throughout later embryogenesis in the craniofacial region.

Cartilage nodule formation in mesenchymal cells cultured from rat mandibles in the presence of TGF-alpha was significantly inhibited. This inhibitory effect of TGF-alpha on chondrogenesis was reversed by addition of antibody against the EGF receptor, which crossreacts with the TGF-alpha receptor. The inhibitory effect of TGF-alpha on chondrogenesis in vitro was further confirmed by <b>micromass</b> <b>culture</b> using mesenchymal cells from rat embryonic limb bud. Taken together, these results demonstrate the involvement of TGF-alpha in chondrogenesis during embryonic development, possibly by way of a specific inhibition of cartilage formation from mesenchymal precursor cells...|$|E

The main {{objective of this}} paper was to focus on the differentiation capacity of ovine [oMSCs] and equine MSCs [eMSCs]. Bone marrow [BM] MSCs were isolated from ovine and equine patients, expanded in monolayer culture and induced into osteogenic, adipogenic and chondrogenic differentiation. For chondrogenic differentiation, cells were cultured in <b>micromass</b> <b>culture.</b> Also, their ultrastructural phenotypes were studied by transmission electron microscopy [TEM]. This study was aimed to provide an indepth morphological description of BM-derived ovine and equine MSCs induced towards three lineages, it demonstrated that TEM analysis is useful in elucidating detailed structural information...|$|E

Cr {{was added to}} the medium at concentrations of either 10 or 20 mM. At various time points, the cell cultures were analyzed morphologically, metabolically and biochemically. The degree of differentiation of primary osteoblast-like cell cultures was higher in <b>micromass</b> <b>cultures</b> compared to monolayer cultures, as judged by alkaline phosphatase (;ALP) activity and extent of mineralization. In both culture systems, Cr supplementation showed positive effects, which were dependent on the organizational level of the osteoblast-like cells {{in such a way that}} the cells in monolayer culture showed significantly increased metabolic activity, ALP activity and mineralization in the presence of Cr than without the supplement. In <b>micromass</b> <b>cultures,</b> Cr also significantly enhanced ALP activity and mineralization, without affecting metabolic activity. The effect of Cr on ALP activity was more pronounced at higher concentrations of Cr, but 20 mM Cr already showed some adverse effects on cell viability. In conclusion, chemically pure Cr added to low serum cell culture medium has a stimulatory effect on metabolic activity, differentiation and mineralization of osteoblast-like cells indicating that Cr supplementation could also be used as a potential clinical intervention to stimulate cell growth, differentiation and mineralization during bone repair in vivo...|$|R
40|$|Longitudinal {{growth of}} endochondral bones is {{accomplished}} through the co-ordinated proliferation and hypertrophic differentiation of growth plate chondrocytes. The molecular mechanisms and signalling cascades controlling these processes {{are not well}} understood. To analyse the expression and roles of p 38 mitogen-activated protein kinases in this process, we have established a micromass system for the reproducible hypertrophic differentiation of mouse mesenchymal limb bud cells. Our results show that all four mammalian p 38 kinase genes are expressed during the chondrogenic programme, {{as well as their}} upstream regulators MKK 3 (mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 3) and MKK 6. Treatment of <b>micromass</b> <b>cultures</b> with pharmacological inhibitors of p 38 results in a marked delay in hypertrophic differentiation in <b>micromass</b> <b>cultures,</b> indicating a requirement for p 38 signalling in chondrocyte differentiation. Inhibition of p 38 kinase activity leads to reduced and delayed induction of alkaline phosphatase activity and matrix mineralization. In addition, p 38 inhibition causes reduced expression of hypertrophic marker genes such as collagen X, matrix metalloproteinase 13 and bone sialoprotein. The function of p 38 in hypertrophic differentiation appears to be mediated, at least in part, by the transcription factor myocyte enhancer factor 2 C. In summary, we have demonstrated a novel requirement for p 38 signalling in hypertrophic differentiation of chondrocytes and identified myocyte enhancer factor 2 C as an important regulator of chondrocyte gene expression...|$|R

40|$|Adhesive {{signaling}} plays a {{key role}} in cellular differentiation, including in chondrogenesis. Herein, we probe the contribution to early chondrogenesis of two key modulators of adhesion, namely focal adhesion kinase (FAK) /Src and CCN 2 (connective tissue growth factor, CTGF). We use the micromass model of chondrogenesis to show that FAK/Src signaling, which mediates cell/matrix attachment, suppresses early chondrogenesis, including the induction of Ccn 2, Agc, and Sox 6. The FAK/Src inhibitor PP 2 elevates Ccn 2, Agc, and Sox 6 expression in wild-type mesenchymal cells in <b>micromass</b> <b>culture,</b> but not in cells lacking CCN 2. Our results suggest a reduction in FAK/Src signaling is a critical feature permitting chondrogenic differentiation and that CCN 2 operates downstream of this loss to promote chondrogenesis...|$|E

Human {{embryonic stem cells}} (hESCs) are a highly potent cell source for cartilage regeneration owing to their infinite proliferation capacity and pluripotency. Thus, lineage-specific differentiation of hESCs often results in populations with cellular heterogeneity. Chondrogenesis was in-duced through high-density <b>micromass</b> <b>culture</b> of hESCs and by addition of chondrogenic medium; 1 : 100 ITS +, 100 nM dexamethasone, 40 lg/ml L-proline, 50 lg/mL ascorbic acid- 2 -phosphate, 1 : 100 Knockout serum, and 10 ng/mL TGFb 3. At day 14 micromasses were dissociated and chondrogenically committed cell separated in a fraction-based discontinuous density gradient. After fractionation the chondrogenically committed cells were analyzed with regard to embryonic- and chondrogenic gene expression and fraction F 3 and F 4 with his-tology. In general, {{we found that the}} chondrogenic condition compared with the control condition had a sig-nificant effect on the following gene expression levels: NANOG, OCT 4, SOX 5, SOX 9, ACAN, and COL 2 A 1 in all fractions. Furthermore, we found in the chondrogenic condition that NANOG, OCT 4, and SOX 9 were significantly higher in F 4 compared with F 3, whereas COL 2 A 1 and the ratio COL 2 A 1 :COL 1 A 1 were significantly lower. Addi-tionally, toluidine blue pH 4 stains of pellet cultures of F 3 and F 4 revealed that cells from F 3 were more homog-enous in morphology than F 4. In conclusion, we propose a simple strategy to obtain more homogenous population of chondrogenically committed cells from hESCs using <b>micromass</b> <b>culture</b> and discontinuous density gradient separation.

In <b>micromass</b> <b>cultures,</b> dissociated mesenchymal cells interact to form cartilage nodules. Cells first form small aggregates, then bigger clusters.

40|$|AbstractChondrogenesis during {{embryonic}} skeletal development {{involves the}} condensation of mesenchymal cells followed by their differentiation into chondrocytes. We describe herein a previously unrecognized regulator of mammalian chondrogenesis encoded by a murine growth factor-inducible immediate-early gene,cyr 61. The Cyr 61 protein is a secreted, heparin-binding protein (379 amino acids with 38 conserved cysteines) that promotes cell adhesion, migration, and proliferation. The expression pattern of thecyr 61 gene during embryogenesis is tissue specific and temporally regulated. Most notably,cyr 61 is transiently expressed in mesenchymal cells of both mesodermal and neuroectodermal origins undergoing chondrogenesis, suggesting that Cyr 61 {{may play a}} role in the development of the embryonic skeleton. In this communication, we demonstrate that the Cyr 61 protein promotes chondrogenesis in <b>micromass</b> <b>cultures</b> of limb bud mesenchymal cellsin vitroand is likely to play a similar rolein vivobased on the following observations: (1) Cyr 61 is present in the embryonic limb mesenchyme during chondrogenesisin vivoandin vitro;(2) purified recombinant Cyr 61 protein added exogenously to <b>micromass</b> <b>cultures</b> promotes chondrogenesis as judged by precocious expression of type II collagen, increased [35 S]sulfate incorporation, and larger Alcian blue-staining cartilage nodules; (3) Cyr 61 enhances cell–cell aggregation, an initial step in chondrogenesis, and promotes chondrogenic differentiation in cultures plated at subthreshold cell densities that are otherwise unable to support differentiation; and (4) neutralization of the endogenous Cyr 61 with specific antibodies inhibits chondrogenesis. Taken together, these results identify Cyr 61 as a novel player in chondrogenesis that contributes to the development of the mammalian embryonic skeleton...|$|R

During intramembranous bone formation, preosteoblasts condense, differentiate into osteoblasts and deposit bone matrix. We compared the differentiation process of rat calvarial osteoblast-like cells inoculated as micromasses, which mimic the in vivo condensation process, with cells inoculated as monolayers. The cells were analysed morphologically at 1, 2 and 3 weeks by light microscopy (alkaline phosphatase activity, mineralization), by transmission electron microscopy, and biochemically (collagen typing, alkaline phosphatase activity, protein and DNA content). The cells inoculated as monolayers formed alkaline phosphatase positive and mineralized nodules during the culture period. The cells inoculated as a micromass formed a large mineralized area consisting of smaller nodules. The ultrastructure {{of the cells}} in both culture systems showed the typical features of osteoblasts and osteocytes. The main difference between monolayer and <b>micromass</b> <b>cultures</b> was found after 1 week in culture. The cells inoculated as a micromass formed a multilayer of cells. The cytoplasm contained rER, mitochondria, vesicles and ribosomes. There were abundant collagen fibrils in membrane folds and in the extracellular matrix. This was {{in contrast to the}} cells in monolayer culture which showed hardly any collagen fibrils in the extracellular matrix. The promotion of the differentiation was also confirmed by biochemical data showing that the DNA content was lower in the micromass than in the monolayer cultures during the culture period.
