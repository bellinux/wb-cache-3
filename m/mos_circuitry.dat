40|$|Abstract. We propose an {{associative}} memory based on minimization of a free-energy function {{determined by the}} library vectors to be stored. When the library vectors are bipolar, the energy function contains minima at the library vector location. The minima can be sought by search techniques such as gradient descent. Significantly, if the correlation nonlinearity is chosen to be sufficiently strong, then convergence occurs in a single step. We demonstrate how the algorithm can be implemented using <b>MOS</b> <b>circuitry.</b> 1...|$|E
40|$|The {{parallel}} {{approach to}} speeding up simulation is studied, specifically the simulation of digital LSI <b>MOS</b> <b>circuitry</b> on the Intel iPSC/ 2 hypercube. The simulation algorithm {{is based on}} RSIM, an event driven switch-level simulator that incorporates a linear transistor model for simulating digital MOS circuits. Parallel processing techniques based on the concepts of Virtual Time and rollback are utilized so that portions of the circuit may be simulated on separate processors, in parallel for as large an increase in speed as possible. A partitioning algorithm is also developed in order to subdivide the circuit for parallel processing...|$|E
40|$|Circuit {{designs that}} employ only CMOS {{technology}} {{are becoming more}} desirable than those using traditional bipolar integrated circuit technology. This technology offers a high density of <b>MOS</b> <b>circuitry,</b> good capacitor accuracy and high stability. The availability of techniques for the design and realization of precision filters in fully integrated form has many applications in signal processing VLSI circuits. The design, simulation and compensation of MOS transistor filters are presented. The MOS transistor {{is used as a}} voltage controlled resistor. The resulting "MOSFET-C" filters can then be built of MOS transistors, capacitors and operational amplifiers fabricated in MOS technology. The advantages of MOSFET-C filters over other integrated filters are discussed. Desirable MOS transistor circuit configurations for use in these filter designs are also presented. High-order, high-frequency, narrow-band bandpass filters are designed and simulated to give a systematic step-by-step design procedure for realizing MOSFET-C filters. These steps include modifying existing well established and studied filter building blocks for use in this method. The nonidealities associated with MOS transistors, especially at high frequencies, are studied and modeled for simulation. Compensation techniques for these nonidealities, together with those of operational amplifiers are presented and applied to both RC and MOSFET-C filters. A compensation scheme is developed which cancels the op amp effects in second-order filter building blocks...|$|E
40|$|Smart power {{technologies}} combine {{low voltage}} circuitry, mostly CMOS, with high voltage, high currently switching devices {{on a single}} chip. A broad range of applications opens up to the circuit designer: automotive or industrial electronics, off line circuits, motor drives and others. In this paper after comparing different power switching devices special emphasis is given to dielectric insulation {{as a means to}} seperate high voltage/high power sections on a chip from low voltage, high density circuitry. Several process options in the voltage range from 50 V to 500 V are reviewed. A circuit application is given utilising a 500 V, 10 A DMOS switch monolithically integrated with <b>MOS</b> analogue/digital <b>circuitry...</b>|$|R
40|$|This paper {{reports a}} process for the {{formation}} of very high quality single-crystal silicon films on glass substrates. The process utilizes the electrostatic bonding of silicon and glass wafers, with subsequent etching of the silicon to form siliconon-insulator (SOI) films having thicknesses controlled from less than 2. [mu]m to over 20,[mu]m with better than 10 % uniformity. The use of Corning type 1729 glass substrates yields an excellent thermal expansion match to the silicon film and allows the use of post-bond processing temperatures as high as 850 [deg]C, permitting the formation of both transducer and transistor structures in the film after bonding and etch-back. Thus, the process offers one means of integrating <b>MOS</b> or bipolar <b>circuitry</b> into dissolved-wafer sensing structures. MOS devices formed in such films show characteristics similar to those in standard bulk silicon, including n-channel mobilities of 640 cm 2 /V s, the highest ever reported for SOI on glass. A variety of related processes are also possible, where {{some or all of the}} high-temperature silicon device processing is performed before bonding to the glass substrate...|$|R
40|$|Since the mid-seventies, when metal-oxide-semiconductor (<b>MOS)</b> <b>circuitry</b> {{replaced}} bipolar circuitry {{for nearly}} all integrated circuits, shrinking lateral dimensions {{through the use of}} continuously improving lithographic technology became the route to keeping Moore’s Law valid. By the mid-nineties this route had become increasingly difficult as minimum features of 200 nm approached the so-called ‘Rayleigh limit ’ (although Rayleigh himself used the term ‘criterion’) and alternatives to ultra-violet optical lithography were being expensively developed. Consequently when Chou and his co –workers, then at the University of Minnesota published their classic papers [1, 2] on ‘Nanoimprint Lithography (NIL) ’ it was clear that this demonstration of 10 nm features size and virtually unlimited throughput represented an extraordinary advance in patterning technology. The technique used was a modification of the manufacturing process for compact disks and involved a heating step and a compressible layer to act as a resist and was similar to a molding process developed in NTT Laboratories in Japan in the seventies [3]. Different from the ‘soft lithography ’ technique which used an elastomer stamp to contact print a self-assembled monolayer (SAM) of ink on a substrate [4], NIL used a hard mold to deform a resist and achieved higher resolution. Others had also been looking at imprin...|$|E
40|$|This work is {{directed}} towards {{a study of}} full-slice or "wafer-scale integrated" - semiconductor memory. Previous approaches to full slice technology are studied and critically compared. It is shown that a fault-tolerant, fixed-interconnection approach offers many advantages; such a technique forms {{the basis of the}} experimental work. The disadvantages of the conventional technology are reviewed to illustrate the potential improvements in cost, packing density and reliability obtainable with wafer-scale integration (W. S. l). Iterative chip arrays are modelled by a pseudorandom fault distribution; algorithms to control the linking of adjacent good - chips into linear chains are proposed and investigated by computer simulation. It is demonstrated that long chains may be produced at practicable yield levels. The on-chip control circuitry and the external control electronics required to implement one particular algorithm are described in relation to a TTL simulation of an array of 4 X 4 integrated circuit chips. A layout of the on-chip control logic is shown to require (in 40 dynamic <b>MOS</b> <b>circuitry)</b> an area equivalent to 250 shift register stages -a reasonable overhead on large memories. Structures are proposed to extend the fixed-interconnection, fault-tolerant concept to parallel/serial organised memory - covering RAM, ROM and Associative Memory applications requiring up to 2 M bits of storage. Potential problem areas in implementing W. S. I are discussed and it is concluded that current technology is capable of manufacturing such devices. A detailed cost comparison of the conventional and W. S. I approaches to large serial memories illustrates the potential savings available with wafer-scale integration. The problem of gaining industrial acceptance for W. S. I is discussed in relation to known and anticipated views- of new technology. The thesis concludes with suggestions for further work in the general field of wafer-scale integration...|$|E
