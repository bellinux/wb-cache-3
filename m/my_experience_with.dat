While he proposed no major changes to the operation of the agriculture department, Farmer emphasized teamwork as a means to improve the state's agricultural sector, cited the need to find new markets for Kentucky agricultural products, and expressed a desire to improve the public perception of the agriculture industry, saying [...] "Farmers have a great story to tell, and I will use any name recognition I have gained through <b>my</b> <b>experience</b> <b>with</b> UK basketball to help them tell it."

Isham praised Spears' attitude to the filming of the scene, claiming that she [...] "had not a blink of fear" [...] during the shoot, Spears is sitting on top of a cliff, surrounded by cliffs. Isham also considered the music video one of his favorites, commenting that he had [...] "nothing but positive things to say about <b>my</b> <b>experience</b> <b>with</b> her and what she's doing right now" [...] and that Spears [...] "stepped into it with positive energy.

500|$|The {{principal}} photography {{produced a}} high demand for extras as zombies. In {{an interview with}} MTV News, special effects artist Greg Nicotero stated that while anyone was welcome to audition, the producers of the show were looking specifically for people who possessed exceptional height and thin features. Casting for extras took approximately three days. Once accepted, the extras {{would be sent to}} [...] "zombie school" [...] for training and preparing for filming. Nicotero stated that [...] "it was interesting because I initially thought <b>my</b> <b>experience</b> <b>with</b> zombie movies is you just let them do whatever they want to do. George [...] always said, 'You show 50 people one movement, then you have 50 people doing all the same thing.' So we sort of just lined them up and said, 'Let's see what your zombie walk would look like,' and then they would do it and we would say, 'Try this or try that.' You know, sort of fine tuning everybody." [...] Alongside with Darabont, Nicotero had previously collaborated with Romero on several occasions, and looked at the structure of the zombies in his films for inspiration. [...] "It's not that I'm against [...] It's just not what I grew up with. It's interesting, too, because a couple takes we did, where a couple of the zombies kind of broke into a run, and after one take Frank's like, 'Did they run too fast? They shouldn't be running. Slow them down.' This is trying to be creepy and moody and, you know, you're building up all this kind of scary tension." ...|$|E

2500|$|On October 9, 2007, Weitz {{revealed}} that the final three chapters from Northern Lights had been moved to the film's potential sequel, The Subtle Knife, {{in order to provide}} [...] "the most promising conclusion to the first film and the best possible beginning to the second," [...] though he also said less than a month later that there had been [...] "tremendous marketing pressure" [...] to create [...] "an upbeat ending." [...] (The San Francisco Chronicle found this [...] "truncated" [...] ending abrupt.) [...] Author Pullman publicly supported these changes, saying that [...] "every film has to make changes to the story that the original book tells— not to change the outcome, but to make it fit the dimensions and the medium of film". In addition to removing the novel's unsettling ending, the film reverses the order in which Lyra travels to Bolvangar, the Gobbler's outpost, and then Svalbard, the armoured bears' kingdom. (Neither deviation from the book features in Scholastic Publishing's The Golden Compass: The Story of the Movie novelization.) In July 2009, Weitz told a Comic Con audience that the film had been [...] "recut by , and <b>my</b> <b>experience</b> <b>with</b> it ended being quite a terrible one”; he also told Time.com that he had felt that by [...] "being faithful to the book I was working at odds with the studio". In 2011, Pullman told an audience at the British Humanist Association annual conference that he was also disappointed by this decision, and hoped that a director's cut of the film would be released some day including the footage cut by New Line.|$|E
