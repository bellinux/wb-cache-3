In addition to the induction of point mutations, DEP induces a low frequency (7. 5 %) of multilocus deletions, whereas DEO induces an extremely high frequency (42. 0 %). The distribution of the different classes of ad- 3 mutants {{and the frequency of}} multilocus deletion mutants among DEP-induced mutants are not significantly different from those induced by the <b>monofunctional</b> <b>alkylating</b> <b>agents</b> EI, EMS and ICR- 177 at comparable forward-mutation frequencies.

Similar to another inducer of cellular stress, UV irradiation, damage of nuclear DNA by alkylation {{is not involved in}} the MMS-induced response.

In light of the JNK/SAPK-dependent induction of c-jun and c-fos transcription, and the Jun/Fos-induced transcription of xenobiotic-metabolizing enzymes, these data provide a potential critical role of JNK/SAPK and p 38 in the induction of a cellular defense program against cytotoxic xenobiotics such as MMS...|$|R
40|$|In eukaryotes, DNA damage {{induced by}} {{ultraviolet}} light and other agents which distort the helix is removed by nucleotide excision repair (NER) in a fragment ∼ 25 to 30 nucleotides long. In humans, a deficiency in NER causes xeroderma pigmentosum (XP), characterized by extreme sensitivity to sunlight {{and a high}} incidence of skin cancers. Abasic (AP) sites are formed in DNA as a result of spontaneous base loss and from the action of DNA glycosylases involved in base excision repair. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, AP sites are removed via the action of two class II AP endonucleases, Apn 1 and Apn 2. Here, we provide evidence for the involvement of NER in the removal of AP sites and show that NER competes with Apn 1 and Apn 2 in this repair process.

We report that levetiracetam (LEV) is the most potent MGMT inhibitor among several AEDs with diverse MGMT regulatory actions. In vitro, when used at concentrations within the human therapeutic range for seizure prophylaxis, LEV decreases MGMT protein and mRNA expression levels. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis reveals that LEV enhances p 53 binding on the MGMT promoter by recruiting the mSin 3 A/histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC 1) corepressor complex. However, LEV does not exert any MGMT inhibitory activity when the expression of either p 53, mSin 3 A, or HDAC 1 is abrogated. LEV inhibits malignant glioma cell proliferation and increases glioma cell sensitivity to the <b>monofunctional</b> <b>alkylating</b> <b>agent</b> temozolomide. In 4 newly diagnosed patients who had 2 craniotomies 7 – 14 days apart, prior to the initiation of any tumor-specific treatment, samples obtained before and after LEV treatment showed the inhibition of MGMT expression.

Here we examine the biological significance of this interaction. Inactivation of the PCNA-binding site of DNA ligase I {{had no effect on}} its catalytic activity or its interaction with DNA polymerase β. In contrast, the loss of PCNA binding severely compromised the ability of DNA ligase I to join Okazaki fragments. Thus, the interaction between PCNA and DNA ligase I is not only critical for the subnuclear targeting of the ligase, but also for coordination of the molecular transactions that occur during lagging-strand synthesis.

PARP- 1, the best characterized member of the PARP family, that presently includes six members, is an abundant nuclear enzyme implicated in cellular responses to DNA injury provoked by genotoxic stress (oxygen radicals, ionizing radiations and <b>monofunctional</b> <b>alkylating</b> <b>agents).</b> Due to its involvement either in DNA repair or in cell death, PARP- 1 is regarded as a double-edged regulator of cellular functions. In fact, when the DNA damage is moderate, PARP- 1 participates in the DNA repair process.

Excessive PARP- 1 activity has been implicated in the pathogenesis of numerous clinical conditions such as stroke, myocardial infarction, shock, diabetes and neurodegenerative disorders. PARP- 1 could therefore be considered as a potential target for the development of pharmacological strategies to enhance the antitumor efficacy of radio- and chemotherapy or to treat a number of clinical conditions characterized by oxidative or NO-induced stress and consequent PARP- 1 activation.

To assess the feasibility of enhancing the efficacy of chemotherapy by an antisense approach and to confirm a role for beta-pol in cellular DNA repair, we looked for increased sensitivity to DNA damaging agents under conditions where beta-pol is down-regulated in the antisense cell line. Such a sensitization is anticipated only where beta-pol is rate-limiting in a DNA repair pathway. A number of agents were tested: cis-diamminedichloroplatinum II (cisplatin); 1, 3 -bis(2 -chloroethyl) - 1 - nitrosourea (BCNU); ionizing radiation and the radio-mimetic drug bleomycin; the bifunctional alkylating agents nitrogen mustard and L-phenylalanine mustard (melphalan); the <b>monofunctional</b> <b>alkylating</b> <b>agent</b> methyl methane sulfonate (MMS) and ultraviolet (UV) radiation.

This toxicity is substantially {{greater than that}} of misonidazole, a compound of similar electron affinity. Reductive processes are important for hypoxic toxicity; this is demonstrated by the fact that misonidazole, in excess, can protect against the hypoxic but not aerobic toxicity of RSU 1069. The importance of the interaction of RSU 1069 with DNA, suggested initially by molecular studies, is supported by the fact that cells containing 5 -bromodeoxyuridine (5 -BUdR) incorporated into their DNA show greater sensitivity towards the lethal effects of RSU 1069 both in air and nitrogen, compared to cells not treated with 5 -BUdR. Experiments with RSU 1069 and 3 -aminobenzamide (3 -AB) show the latter compound to potentiate aerobic toxicity, consistent with monofunctional alkylation by RSU 1069. In contrast, 3 -AB has no effect on the hypoxic cytotoxicity of RSU 1069, which would be predicted if RSU 1069 is functioning as a bifunctional agent under these conditions. It is our contention that in air, RSU 1069 functions as a typical <b>monofunctional</b> <b>alkylating</b> <b>agent,</b> presumably due to the presence of the aziridine group whereas, in hypoxia, reduction of the nitro group provides an additional alkylating species, converting the compound into a bifunctional agent...|$|E

Previous work has shown that expanded simple tandem repeat (ESTR) loci provide a sensitive system for monitoring radiation-induced mutation in the mouse germline. Here, the results of the first systematic study on germline mutation induction at mouse ESTR loci by chemical mutagens are presented. Mutation rates at two ESTR loci were studied in the germline of male mice exposed to two <b>monofunctional</b> <b>alkylating</b> <b>agents,</b> ethyl-nitrosourea (ENU) and isopropyl methanesulfonate (iPMS), {{as well as to the}} topoisomerase-II inhibitor, etoposide (ET). Pre-meiotic exposure to <b>alkylating</b> <b>agents</b> resulted in a highly significant increase in ESTR mutation rate, but did not alter post-meiotically exposed cells. Pre-meiotic mutation induction by ENU and iPMS was linear within the interval of doses from 12. 5 mg/kg to 25 mg/kg and reached a plateau at higher concentrations. Paternal exposure to etoposide resulted in ESTR mutation induction at meiotic stages but did not affect post- or pre-meiotic cells. The pattern of ESTR mutation induction after pre-meiotic and meiotic exposure to chemical mutagens was similar to that previously obtained by various traditional approaches for monitoring germline mutation in mice. Using microarrays, the analysis of the pattern of changes in gene expression in the testis of male mice exposed to ENU was studied. This analysis revealed that exposure to this chemical mutagen does not result in detectable changes in gene expression.

Here we {{examine the relationship between}} oxidative stress, cellular levels of DNA polymerase beta and base excision repair capacity in vitro, using mouse monocytes and either wild-type mouse fibroblasts or those deleted of the DNA polymerase beta gene. Treatment with an oxidative stress-inducing agent such as hydrogen peroxide, 3 -morpholinosydnonimine, xanthine/xanthine oxidase or lipopolysaccharide was found to increase the level of DNA polymerase beta in both monocytes and fibroblasts. Base excision repair capacity in vitro, as measured in crude cell extracts, was also increased by lipopolysaccharide treatment in both cell types. In monocytes lipopolysaccharide-mediated up-regulation of the base excision repair system correlated with increased resistance to the <b>monofunctional</b> DNA <b>alkylating</b> <b>agent</b> methyl methanesulfonate. By making use of a quantitative PCR assay to detect lesions in genomic DNA we show that lipopolysaccharide treatment of fibroblast cells reduces the incidence of spontaneous DNA lesions. This effect {{may be due to the}} enhanced DNA polymerase beta-dependent base excision repair capacity of the cells, because a similar decrease in DNA lesions was not observed in cells deficient in base excision repair by virtue of DNA polymerase beta gene deletion. Similarly, fibroblasts treated with lipopolysaccharide were more resistant to methyl methanesulfonate than untreated cells. This effect was not observed in cells deleted of the DNA polymerase beta gene. These results suggest that the DNA polymerase beta-dependent base excision repair pathway can be up-regulated by oxidative stress-inducing agents in mouse cell lines...|$|R
40|$|Breast {{cancer is}} the second leading cause of cancer deaths among women in the United States. Research has linked genetic and {{lifestyle}} factors to increased risks of developing this disease. However, in spite of recent advances, there continue to be significant gaps {{in our understanding of}} the causes, susceptibility factors and mechanisms underlying the etiology of breast cancer. Environmental factors also contribute and it is believed that unintentional exposures to various physical and chemical agents {{play a major role in}} the etiology of this and other types of cancer. !Studies have reported that women with increased size variability of the constitutive heterochromatin regions of chromosomes 1 and 9 in normal peripheral blood cells are at increased risk of developing breast cancer. Previous work in our laboratory using a novel technique integrating fluorescence in-situ hybridization (FISH) with probes specific for the classical satellite regions located at the heterochromatin regions of chromosomes 1 and 9 was applied to lymphoblastoid cells lines derived from breast cancer patients and age-, ethnicity- and sex-matched controls. These results corroborated early studies reporting that the paracentromeric heterochromatin regions of chromosomes 1 and 9 were significantly more variable in size than those from the matched controls. The mechanisms underlying the increase in variability are unknown. The objectives of this research were to first, confirm and extend the earlier results from our laboratory, and secondly, to investigate the hypothesis that the increased variability observed is due to inefficient DNA repair of DNA inter-strand crosslinks. In comparing the results of the new and the earlier studies, similar results were seen, and as a result, the data were combined to enlarge the sample size and increase the accuracy of the results. The combined analyses confirmed that the size of the constitutive heterochromatin was significantly more variable in most cells obtained from the breast cancer patients when compared with the matched controls; the constitutive heterochromatin region was significantly more variable in 7 of the 10 breast cancer patient-derived cell lines when examining both chromosomes 1 and 9. To assess the role of DNA damage, we exposed six breast cancer patient cell lines to the <b>alkylating</b> <b>agents,</b> mitomycin C, melphalan and 2 -chloroethylamine to investigate changes in the heterochromatin regions that occurred following treatment. Two of the six cell lines showed variability in the heterochromatin region of chromosome 9 that was strikingly greater following treatment than that seen in the matched controls. Interestingly, a similar trend was not seen with chromosome 1. The increase in heterochromatin variability was seen following treatment with both bifunctional and <b>monofunctional</b> <b>alkylating</b> <b>agents</b> indicating that the increase was not dependent upon the formation of DNA crosslinks. Of note, the two particularly sensitive cell lines did not exhibit major increases in alkylating agent-induced chromosome breakage in the micronucleus assay indicating that variability is not likely to be due to inefficient repair of genome-wide DNA breaks. Lastly, in a time-course experiment, the increases in heterochromatin variability in the two sensitive cell lines were seen at both 24 and 48 hr after treatment with mitomycin C, a potent cross linking agent. Interestingly, similar but only transient increases (at 24 hr. only) were also seen with DMSO treatment in the sensitive cells, but not controls, suggesting that the observed increases are not due to changes in DNA sequence but are more likely due to epigenetic changes occurring in the sensitive cell lines...|$|R
40|$|Sister {{chromatid}} exchanges, {{which may}} reflect chromosome repair {{in response to}} certain types of DNA damage, provide a means of investigating the increased chromosome fragility characteristic of Fanconi's anemia. By a recently developed technique using 33258 Hoechst and 5 -bromodeoxyuridine, {{it was observed that}} the baseline frequency of sister chromatid exchanges in phytohemagglutinin-stimulated lymphocytes from four males with Fanconi's anemia differed little from that of normal lymphocytes. However, addition of the bifunctional alkylating agent mitomycin C (0. 01 or 0. 03 mug/ml) to the Fanconi's anemia cells during culture induces {{less than half of the}} increase in exchanges found in identically treated normal lymphocytes. This reduced increment in exchanges in accompanied by a partial suppression of mitosis and a marked increase in chromatid breaks and rearrangements. Many of these events occur at sites of incomplete chromatid interchange. The increase in sister chromatid exchanges induced in Fanconi's anemia lymphocytes by the <b>monofunctional</b> <b>alkylating</b> <b>agent</b> ethylmethane sulfonate (0. 25 mg/ml) was slightly less than that in normal cells. Lymphocytes from two sets of parents of the patients with Fanconi's anemia exhibited a normal response to alkylating agents, while dermal fibroblasts from two different patients with Fanconi's anemia reacted to mitomycin C with an increase in chromatid breaks, but a nearly normal increment of sister chromatid exchanges. The results suggest that chromosomal breaks and rearrangements in Fanconi's anemia lymphocytes may result from a defect in a form of repair of DNA damage...|$|E
40|$|Summary The hypoxic cell radiosensitizer RSU 1069 (1 -(2 -nitro- 1 -imidazolyl) - 3 -(1 -aziridinyl) - 2 -propanol) shows, on a {{concentration}} basis, a 100 -fold greater toxicity towards hypoxic relative to aerobic cells. This toxicity is substantially {{greater than that}} of misonidazole, a compound of similar electron affinity. Reductive processes are important for hypoxic toxicity; this is demonstrated by the fact that misonidazole, in excess, can protect against the hypoxic but not aerobic toxicity of RSU 1069. The importance of the interaction of RSU 1069 with DNA, suggested initially by molecular studies, is supported by the fact that cells containing 5 -bromodeoxyuridine (5 -BUdR) incorporated into their DNA show greater sensitivity towards the lethal effects of RSU 1069 both in air and nitrogen, compared to cells not treated with 5 -BUdR. Experiments with RSU 1069 and 3 -aminobenzamide (3 -AB) show the latter compound to potentiate aerobic toxicity, consistent with monofunctional alkylation by RSU 1069. In contrast, 3 -AB has no effect on the hypoxic cytotoxicity of RSU 1069, which would be predicted if RSU 1069 is functioning as a bifunctional agent under these conditions. It is our contention that in air, RSU 1069 functions as a typical <b>monofunctional</b> <b>alkylating</b> <b>agent,</b> presumably due to the presence of the aziridine group whereas, in hypoxia, reduction of the nitro group provides an additional alkylating species, converting the compound into a bifunctional agent. The compound RSU 1069 (NSC 347503), 1 -(2 nitro-l-imidazolyl) - 3 -(1 -aziridinyl) - 2 -propanol...|$|E
40|$|Mutations in the Drosophila mus 308 gene confer {{specific}} hypersensitivity to DNA-cross-linking agents as {{a consequence}} of defects in DNA repair. The mus 308 gene is shown here to encode a 229 -kDa protein in which the amino-terminal domain contains the seven conserved motifs characteristic of DNA and RNA helicases and the carboxy-terminal domain shares over 55 % sequence similarity with the polymerase domains of prokaryotic DNA polymerase I-like enzymes. This is the first reported member of this family of DNA polymerases in a eukaryotic organism, as well as the first example of a single polypeptide with homology to both DNA polymerase and helicase motifs. Identification of a closely related gene in the genome of Caenorhabditis elegans suggests that this novel polypeptide may play an evolutionarily conserved role in the repair of DNA damage in eukaryotic organisms. The mus 308 gene is one of over 30 identified Drosophila genes required for resistance to DNA-damaging agents (10, 11, 27, 48). Mutant alleles of mus 308 are, however, unique in conferring strong hypersensitivity to DNA interstrand crosslinking agents such as photoactivated psoralen, diepoxybutane, and nitrogen mustard without conferring hypersensitivity to the <b>monofunctional</b> <b>alkylating</b> <b>agent</b> methyl methanesulfonate (13). It thus seems probable that the wild-type mus 308 gene product functions in a repair pathway that targets DNA crosslinks but is not required for either base excision repair of alkylated bases or the repair of DNA strand breaks occurring as a result of methyl methanesulfonate treatment. Very {{little is known about the}} mechanism by which interstrand cross-links are repaired in multicellular eukaryotes, and characterization of the mus 308 gene represents an important step toward identifying the essential components involved in this repair pathway...|$|E

Their {{functionality}} {{has been}} found to be limited when in the presence of the DNA-repair enzyme O-6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT).
