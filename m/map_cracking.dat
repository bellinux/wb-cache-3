40|$|This {{research}} aims {{to model}} Alkali-Silica Reaction gel expansion in concrete {{under the influence}} of hygral and thermal loading, based on experimental results. ASR provokes a heterogeneous expansion in concrete leading to dimensional changes and eventually the premature failure of the concrete structure. This can result in <b>map</b> <b>cracking</b> on the concrete surface which will decrease the concrete stiffness. Factors that influence ASR are parameters such as the cement alkalinity, the number of deleterious silica from the aggregate used, concrete porosity, and external factors like temperature, humidity and external source of alkali from ingression of deicing salts. Uncertainties of the influential factors make ASR a difficult phenomenon to solve; hence my approach to this matter is to solve the problem using stochastic modelling, where a numerical simulation of concrete cross-section with integration of experimental results from Finger-Institute for Building Materials Science at the Bauhaus-Universität Weimar. The problem is formulated as a multi-field problem, combining heat transfer, fluid transfer and the reaction rate model with the mechanical stress field. Simulation is performed as a mesoscale model considering aggregates and mortar matrix. The reaction rate model will be conducted using experimental results from concrete expansions due to ASR gained from concrete prism tests.

40|$|Many bridges in {{the state}} of Indiana have been {{identified}} to have cracking in the concrete deck. Cracking has been identified in the negative and positive moment regions of bridges on both the top and bottom surfaces and can appear before or shortly after the opening of the structure to live loads. Significant crack widths and various degrees of cracking exist in different bridge systems including both concrete and steel superstructures. This research project was divided into five phases to determine the factors affecting transverse and longitudinal bridge deck cracking, as well as, to develop design recommendations that minimize or prevent these types of bridge deck cracking. The research focused on the design and construction of new bridge decks. However, an overview of overlay cracking is also presented. The first phase was a field evaluation to investigate the scope of the problem. Using the information gathered from the first phase, the second phase instrumented a typical bridge structure to provide an understanding of the behavior of transverse cracks in a concrete bridge deck. With the findings from the previous two phases, the third phase conducted a laboratory investigation to study the effects of shrinkage and restraint of a concrete deck and to determine the contribution of stay-in-place steel forms to the formation of transverse cracking. The fourth phase evaluated the effect of formwork type on restrained shrinkage. In the final phase, the effect of reinforcing bar spacings and epoxy thickness on crack width and spacings were evaluated. Based on the research investigation, transverse deck cracking is caused by restrained shrinkage of the concrete deck while longitudinal cracking is caused by a combination of factors including restrained shrinkage and a construction detail that turns the leg of an angle used to support stay-in-place formwork into the deck.

40|$|University of Minnesota M. S. thesis. November 2012. Major: Civil Engineering. Advisors: Catherine W. French, Carol K. Shield. xi, 215 pages, {{appendices}} A-D. The Minnesota Department of Transportation (MnDOT) {{developed a}} {{design for a}} precast composite slab span system (PCSSS) {{to be used in}} accelerated bridge construction. The system consists of shallow inverted-tee precast beams placed between supports with cast-in-place (CIP) concrete placed on top, forming a composite slab span system. Suitable for spans between 20 and 60 ft., the MnDOT PCSSS is useful for replacing a large number of aging conventional slab-span bridges throughout the United States highway system. Originally developed in 2005, the PCSSS had three distinct design generations in the 12 bridges that were constructed by MnDOT between 2005 and 2011. The objective of this investigation was to evaluate the field performance of a sample of the existing bridges through detailed crack mapping and core analysis and through continued monitoring of data obtained from one of the original PCSSS bridges (Bridge No. 13004) instrumented during construction in 2005. A parametric design study was also conducted to investigate the effects of continuity design on the economy of the PCSSS. Five of the 12 PCSSS bridges, constructed between 2005 and 2011, were selected as the sample set to conduct detailed surveys of surface cracking and examinations of extracted core specimens to evaluate effects of the design changes. Surface cracking was recorded over three different inspections between the fall of 2009 and the summer of 2011. Each inspection was done using a systematic procedure of documenting crack locations and measuring crack widths. The result was a series of crack maps for each bridge, showing the surface cracking compared to major design features. Different line types were used to distinguish relative crack widths. Core specimens were taken from each of the five inspected bridges based on anticipated reflective crack locations. The cores were partial depth through the CIP concrete, taken over either the longitudinal joint between precast panels or over the precast web corner. Each core was examined under a digital microscope for cracking with particular attention paid to the regions above the longitudinal joints and web corners. The results of the core investigation were compared to the corresponding crack maps. Overall, the field inspections indicated that the changes made between each design generation improved the performance of the PCSSS. Bridge No. 13004 in Center City, MN from the first design generation showed many short, longitudinal cracks on the deck surface with very little transverse and <b>map</b> <b>cracking.</b> The longitudinal cracks were located primarily over the precast beam web, corresponding to what appeared to be insufficient consolidation of the CIP concrete around the stirrups projecting vertically from the section to facilitate composite action, which had little clearance above the precast webs. In the second generation, more clearance was provided under the stirrups projecting from the surface. Bridge Nos. 33005 and 33008 near Mora, MN from the second generation did not show the short cracks over the webs from the first generation, but more transverse cracks and longer longitudinal cracks were observed. Bridge No. 33008 showed significantly more longitudinal cracking {{than any of the other}} bridges. Significant longitudinal cracks were noted along several joints between the precast beams. Core specimens showed that these cracks were full-depth reflective cracks. The only other bridge to show reflective cracking from the core specimens was Bridge No. 13004, but these were not full-depth cracks. It was unclear from the design details of Bridge No. 33008 why it was in worse condition than the other bridges. This bridge also had noticeably different cambers between adjacent beams observed from the underside of the bridge, although it was unclear how this might be associated with the observed longitudinal cracking. For the third design generation, the thickness of the precast beam flanges was decreased and the trough reinforcement spacing (consisting of trough hooks projecting horizontally from the beams across the joint, as well as a drop-in cage) was decreased from a maximum 10 in. center-to-center to 6 in. center-to-center to better control reflective cracking. The decreased spacing was accomplished by staggering the trough hooks from adjacent precast beams. Bridge Nos. 49007 and 49036 near Little Falls, MN from the third generation did not exhibit longitudinal cracking over the precast beam joints, indicating that the design changes may have had a positive impact, though not conclusively. The most significant issue observed with the third generation was shrinkage cracking, indicated by longitudinal cracks located over the precast beam webs and more extensive transverse and <b>map</b> <b>cracking.</b> Generally, bridges with a larger length to width aspect ratio (i. e., L/W) had more transverse cracking, which could be related to more longitudinal shrinkage restraint. In addition to the field inspections, strain data from the instrumentation of Bridge No. 13004 was analyzed to evaluate performance. The bridge was instrumented in 2005 to monitor reflective cracking and continuous system behavior. Six years of strain and temperature data showed a progression of reflective cracking in several locations and significant cracking due to thermally induced restraint moments. The reflective cracking from the strain data was confirmed by observed cracks in the core specimens near the locations of the strain gauges. While the width of the reflective cracks appeared to increase over time from the strain measurements, the measurements began to plateau by the end of the six-year monitoring period. Restraint moment cracking was indicated by strain gauges attached to continuity connection reinforcement. The measured restraint moment strains were large enough for fatigue to be of potential concern, although the strains were associated with environmental effects which have a low number of cycles at once per day. Measured strains associated with both reflective cracking and restraint moments were primarily driven by seasonal and daily temperature variations, highlighting the important role of thermal effects in design. Besides the detailed field investigations, a parametric study of PCSSS designs was conducted to determine whether there was an economic benefit of continuous system design. In particular, design implications of time-dependent and thermal gradient restraint moments and their effects on continuity were studied. Because the PCSSS is a simple-span system made continuous with a CIP deck, the effects of restraint moments must be considered in the design of continuous systems. The restraint moments are those that arise from continuity, or end restraint, over the piers due to beam creep, differential shrinkage between the CIP deck and beam, and thermal gradient. Restraint moments would not develop if PCSSS were built as a series of simple spans with no continuity provided between the spans. Eight bridges covering the feasible range of span configurations were designed as both simple and continuous systems. Flexural design was performed for each case, resulting in optimized precast sections within practical design constraints. Primary design parameters were strand number, section depth, and precast concrete strength. These design parameters were compared between the continuous and simple-span designs for each configuration to evaluate economic benefit. Generally, continuous PCSSS designs were equally or less economical than simple-span designs. Spans less than 30 feet had a slight economic benefit with continuous design because large restraint moments did not develop. However, spans greater than 30 feet developed large restraint moments in continuous design, particularly due to thermal gradient effects. In addition, the restraint moments greatly reduced continuity, effectively negating the benefit to live-load capacity. It was recommended that the PCSSS be designed as a simply-supported system for live load. Furthermore, because most continuous system designs were less economical than the corresponding simply-supported designs, it was concluded that designing the PCSSS as simply-supported while also including a continuity connection would be unconservative without accounting for restraint moments. A simple method was developed to account for restraint moments for this case without time-intensive calculations. Further recommendations related to the analysis of negative moments over PCSSS bridge piers were also provided. A review of current design methods and details concluded that the current PCSSS design was generally sufficient, and recommendations for future PCSSS designs were provided. Items reviewed were related to shrinkage restraint, reflective crack control, composite action, and defining tolerances for the PCSSS. In order to try to better control top surface deck cracking, recommendations included increasing the transverse reinforcement in the CIP deck to provide a gross reinforcement ratio, ρg, of 0. 0063 with a spacing no greater than 9 in., based on the work of Frosch (2006). This would translate to increasing the current transverse deck reinforcement from No. 4 bars at 6 in. (ρg = 0. 0056) to No. 5 bars at 6 in. (ρg = 0. 0086) or No. 5 bars at an increased spacing of 8 in. (ρg = 0. 0065) to provide the needed volumetric ratio while maintaining the maximum spacing for surface crack control. The recommendations of NCHRP 10 - 71 for reinforcement in the trough are adopted in order to control reflective cracking In addition, it was recommended that composite action stirrups need not be used if the required shear stress transferred between the CIP concrete deck and precast beam is less than 135 psi...|$|E

Dimensional scaling included that of the effective depth of the cross section, which is a key parameter associated with the scaling of shear strength; and maximum aggregate size, which affects the shear-resisting mechanism of aggregate interlock along shear (inclined) cracks. Five GFRP reinforced concrete (RC) beams with effective depth up to 290 mm and constant shear span-to-effective depth ratio of 3. 1 were load tested under four-point bending. Two types of failures were observed: flexural, due to rupture of the GFRP reinforcement in the constant moment region; and shear, due to inclined cracking in either constant shear region through the entire section depth. Acoustic emission (AE) analyses were performed to classify crack types occurring at different points in the load history.

Solution of the direct problem that <b>maps</b> <b>crack</b> bridging stresses into crack opening displacements (COD) is straightforward, but the inverse problem is ill-posed, and better solved by the theory of inverse problems. This paper exploits the Tikhonov regularization method to solve the inverse problem, and estimates the force and location of rebar in buried concrete from CODs. Bending tests are carried out on model RC beams in the laboratory to demonstrate {{the applicability of the}} method. During the tests, a microscopic camera snaps high resolution digital pictures of cracked concrete surface.

In addition, sunlight intensity and capacity of concrete bleeding were factors investigated with regard to concrete surface evaporation rate. The monitoring of plastic shrinkage crack initiation and development is an important task in the research of concrete slabs. The research on plastic shrinkage cracking of the slab surface resulted {{in the development of a}} digital image analysis method. This method focuses on <b>mapping</b> <b>cracks</b> (MC) and measuring crack width (MCW). Other information such as crack growth over time can also be obtained based on MC and MCW. An accurate method for the measurement of crack width has been developed based on sliced crack image data. Therefore, this method can determine the location of the maximum crack width and measure it with a desired precision...|$|R
40|$|Traditional {{pavement}} crack {{detection methods}} can not cope {{well with the}} complexity and diversity of noises in large image area. To solve this problem, we propose a novel unsupervised crack detection approach based on saliency and statistical features. The saliency is initially represented by a conspicuity map built from the intensity rarity and local contrast of image regions. Then spatial continuity of candidate crack pixels is measured based on the statistical features extracted in their neighborhood. This {{is followed by a}} Bayesian model to automatically update the saliency <b>map.</b> Finally, <b>cracks</b> are extracted after adaptive saliency map binarization. Experiments show that proposed method has generated consistent results as those by human visual inspection. The results have also proved the effectiveness of the proposed method in suppressing noises compared with several alternative methods. Full Tex...|$|R

40|$|Lug joints arc {{considered}} as fatigue critical {{and the consequences}} of their failure can be severe aircraft structure. Application of fracture mechanics concepts to assess the damage tolerance of lug joints requires estimates of stress intensity factor as a function of crack size and shape. During experimental studies on fatigue crack growth behavior of lug joints, it is possible to estimate the surface crack length of fatigue cracks {{as a function of the}} cycles of loading. Information on growth kinetics is incomplete in the absence of clear information on the goowth of cracks within the lug bore. The above limitation restricts the capability of fatigue life prediction in lug joints. 13; In an effort to find a way of determining crack front shape and size for a lug joint subjected to constant amplitude loading, a fractographic technique was evolved for <b>mapping</b> the <b>crack</b> front at various intervals of fatigue cycling prior to final failure. This report presents the details of the <b>crack</b> front <b>mapping</b> technique...|$|R
40|$|Abstract This article {{describes}} a miniaturised electrical imaging (resistivity tomography) technique to <b>map</b> the <b>cracking</b> pattern of a clay model. The clay used {{was taken from}} a scaled flood embankment built to study the fine fissuring due to desiccation and breaching process in flooding conditions. The potential of using a miniature array of electrodes to follow {{the evolution of the}} vertical cracks and number them during the drying process was explored. The imaging technique generated two-dimensional contoured plots of the resistivity distribution within the model before and at different stages of the desiccation process. The change in resistivity associated with the widening of the cracks were monitored as a function of time. Experiments were also carried out using a selected conductive gel to slow down the transport process into the cracks to improve the scanning capabilities of the equipment. The main vertical clay fissuring network was obtained after inversion of the experimental resistivity measurements and validated by direct observations...|$|R
40|$|The nanoindentation {{fracture}} {{behavior of}} gallium arsenide (GaAs) is examined from two perspectives in two parent papers. The first paper (part I) focuses on in situ nanoindentation within a {{scanning electron microscope}} (SEM) and on fractographic observations of cleaved cross-sections of indented regions to investigate the crack field under various indenter geometries. In the second parent paper (part II), cathodoluminescence and transmission electron microscopy are used to investigate the relationship between dislocation and crack fields. The combination of instrumented in situ scanning electron microscopy nanoindentations and cleavage cross-sectioning allows us to establish a detailed <b>map</b> of <b>cracking</b> in the indented region and cracking kinetics for conical and wedge indenter shapes. For wedge nanoindentations, {{the evolution of the}} half-penny crack size with the indentation load is interpreted using a simple linear elastic fracture model based on weight functions. Fracture toughness estimates obtained by this technique fall within the range of usual values quoted for GaA...|$|R
40|$|We {{present an}} image filter that {{transforms}} an input line drawing into {{an image of}} a fractured surface, where the cracks echo the input drawing. The basis of our algorithm is the Voronoi diagram of a weighted graph, where the distance between nodes is path cost in the graph. Modifying the edge costs gives us control over the placement of region boundaries; we interpret region boundaries as cracks. The rendering of our <b>crack</b> <b>maps</b> into final images is accomplished either by image analogies or by modulation of an uncracked texture. Key words: Non-photorealistic rendering, fracture, texture synthesi...|$|R

An in‐situ phased array sector scan is described for the monitoring of crack responses under load, and results are presented showing the anticipated dependence of signal amplitude on crack closure. Acoustic microscopy <b>mapping</b> of actual <b>crack</b> morphology is outlined. A measurement model is presented for prediction of responses using the measured crack morphology as input. Results are shown demonstrating the reduction in inspection signal amplitude arising from the deviation of measured crack morphology from the ideal planar geometry...|$|R
