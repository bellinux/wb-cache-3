5|$|In most cells, the {{disassembly}} of {{the nuclear}} envelope {{marks the end of}} the prophase of mitosis. However, this disassembly of the nucleus is not a universal feature of mitosis and does not occur in all cells. Some unicellular eukaryotes (e.g., yeasts) undergo so-called closed mitosis, in which the nuclear envelope remains intact. In closed mitosis, the daughter chromosomes migrate to opposite poles of the nucleus, which then divides in two. The cells of higher eukaryotes, however, usually undergo open mitosis, which is characterized by breakdown {{of the nuclear}} envelope. The daughter chromosomes then migrate to opposite poles of the <b>mitotic</b> <b>spindle,</b> and new nuclei reassemble around them.|$|E

We have previously reported that the viral origin binding protein E 2 of human papillomavirus types 11 (HPV- 11), 16, and 18 colocalized with the <b>mitotic</b> <b>spindles.</b> In this study, we show the localization of the HPV- 11 E 2 protein to be dynamic. It colocalized with the <b>mitotic</b> <b>spindles</b> during prophase and metaphase. At anaphase, it began to migrate to the central spindle microtubules, where it remained through telophase and cytokinesis. It was additionally observed in the midbody at cytokinesis. A peptide spanning residues 285 to 308 in the carboxyl-terminal domain of HPV- 11 E 2 (E 2 C) is necessary and sufficient to confer localization on the <b>mitotic</b> <b>spindles.</b> This region is conserved in HPV- 11, - 16, and - 18 and bovine papillomavirus type 4 (BPV- 4) E 2 and is also required for the respective E 2 C to colocalize with the <b>mitotic</b> <b>spindles.</b> The E 2 protein of bovine papillomavirus type 1 is tethered to the mitotic chromosomes via the cellular protein Brd 4. However, the HPV- 11 E 2 protein did not associate with Brd 4 during mitosis. Lastly, a chimeric BPV- 1 E 2 C containing the spindle localization domain from HPV- 11 E 2 C gained the ability to localize to the <b>mitotic</b> <b>spindles,</b> whereas the reciprocal chimera lost the ability. We conclude that this region of HPV E 2 C is critical for localization with the mitotic apparatus, enabling the HPV DNA to sustain persistent infections...|$|R

Resistance to paclitaxel or anthracycline doxorubicin does not necessarily indicate resistance to docetaxel. Microtubules formed {{in the presence of}} docetaxel are of a larger size than those formed in the presence of paclitaxel, which may result in improved cytotoxic efficacy. Abundant formation of microtubules and the prevention to replicate caused by the presence of docetaxel leads to apoptosis of tumour cells and is the basis of docetaxel use as a cancer treatment. It is unknown if pathophysiological interactions with docetaxel exist at this stage, however tumour type has been shown to have efficacy on cellular activity.

25|$|There are 4 {{confirmed}} SUMO isoforms in humans; SUMO-1, SUMO-2, SUMO-3 and SUMO-4. SUMO-2/3 show a {{high degree}} of similarity to each other and are distinct from SUMO-1. SUMO-4 shows similarity to SUMO-2/3 but differs in having a Proline instead of Glutamine at position 90. As a result, SUMO-4 isn't processed and conjugated under normal conditions, but is used for modification of proteins under stress-conditions like starvation. During mitosis, SUMO-2/3 localize to centromeres and condensed chromosomes, whereas SUMO-1 localizes to the <b>mitotic</b> <b>spindle</b> and spindle midzone, indicating that SUMO paralogs regulate distinct mitotic processes in mammalian cells. One of the major SUMO conjugation products associated with mitotic chromosomes arose from SUMO-2/3 conjugation of topoisomerase II, which is modified exclusively by SUMO-2/3 during mitosis. SUMO-2/3 modifications seem to be involved specifically in the stress response. SUMO-1 and SUMO-2/3 can form mixed chains, however, because SUMO-1 does not contain the internal SUMO consensus sites found in SUMO-2/3, it is thought to terminate these poly-SUMO chains.|$|E

Here, we describe the structure, distribution, and function of KLP- 18, a Caenorhabditis elegans Klp 2 kinesin. Previous reports of Klp 2 kinesins agree that it concentrates in spindles, but do not provide a clear view of its function. During prometaphase, metaphase, and anaphase, KLP- 18 concentrates toward the poles in both meiotic and <b>mitotic</b> <b>spindles.</b> Depletion of KLP- 18 by RNA-mediated interference prevents parallel bundling/bipolar organization of the MTs that accumulate around female meiotic chromosomes.
