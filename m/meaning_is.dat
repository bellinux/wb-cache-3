5|$|People from Plymouth {{are known}} as Plymothians or less {{formally}} as Janners. Its <b>meaning</b> <b>is</b> described as a person from Devon, deriving from Cousin Jan (the Devon form of John), but more particularly in naval circles anyone from the Plymouth area.|$|E

5|$|It {{has also}} been argued against folk {{psychology}} that the intentionality of mental states like belief imply that they have semantic qualities.

This makes it difficult to explain how they can play the causal roles that they are supposed to in cognitive processes.|$|E
30|$|To summarize, intercultural {{differences}} in affective <b>meaning</b> <b>are</b> very large {{for a few}} concepts and very small for a few concepts, while {{the vast majority of}} intercultural {{differences in}} affective <b>meanings</b> <b>are</b> moderate. Even the moderate intercultural differences in affective <b>meaning</b> <b>are</b> relatively small compared to differences in affective meaning for different concepts. The implication <b>is</b> that affective <b>meanings</b> <b>are</b> shared across cultures to a large extent, and a series of factor analyses of intercultural correlations within each of the EPA dimensions revealed considerable pllelism.|$|R

40|$|The {{present study}} investigates the {{meanings}} of the Chinese word "Huka"（風化）. Huka has three main meanings: (1) to lead people by an instruction; (2) to change appearance by the effect of air, sun, or water; and (3) to make one's memory or impression fade with time. The first <b>meaning</b> <b>was</b> discovered in ancient Chinese literature and was used in Japan. The second was discovered in the Chinese botany (Honzogaku) of the 11 th century and is especially {{used to describe the}} weathering of lime. This <b>meaning</b> <b>was</b> introduced and established in Japan by researchers of Dutch learning (Rangaku) in the 19 th century. The third <b>meaning</b> <b>was</b> derived figuratively from the second meaning in Japan. It is widely used in the Japanese language at present. However, this <b>meaning</b> <b>was</b> not found in Chinese. The occurrence and transition of these <b>meanings</b> <b>are</b> discussed in terms of their usages...|$|R
5|$|Many Māori {{place names}} possess either {{historical}} or mythological significance. Their <b>meaning</b> <b>is</b> not always apparent from literal translations {{and they have}} been passed down through oral tradition. Before European arrival, place names commemorated notable or historical incidents, described features of the location or were derived from traditional Hawaiki names or myths. After European arrival many locations became known as Māori versions of European words or poorly pronounced contractions of the original Māori names.|$|E
5|$|The reading 'Avete vos' is {{from the}} fifteenth century manuscripts and editions. In this case the emperor is simply {{returning}} the salutation. The literal <b>meaning</b> <b>is,</b> however, 'be well', 'be safe', or 'be sound', and the gladiators understood it as dismissing them.|$|E
5|$|The term is controversial, and its precise <b>meaning</b> <b>is</b> hard to define. Some {{minority}} students are discouraged from achieving in school by the negative prejudices of ethnic peers; {{such a view}} has been expressed in articles in The New York Times, Time magazine, and The Wall Street Journal—and by public figures and academics across the political spectrum.|$|E

50|$|Sexual <b>meanings</b> <b>are</b> the <b>meanings</b> that <b>are</b> attributed, by a {{particular}} cultural-social-historical context, to sexual acts and broadly to all the aspects of the erotic dimension of human sexual experience. This also include the beliefs on what is considered sexual and what <b>is</b> not. Sexual <b>meanings</b> <b>are</b> social and cultural constructs, and they are metabolized and subjectivized by the individual only after cultural and social mediation.|$|R
5|$|Depending on modality, {{language}} structure can {{be based}} on systems of sounds (speech), gestures (sign languages), or graphic or tactile symbols (writing). The ways in which languages use sounds or signs to construct meaning are studied in phonology. The study of how humans produce and perceive vocal sounds is called phonetics. In spoken language, <b>meaning</b> <b>is</b> produced when sounds {{become part of a}} system in which some sounds can contribute to expressing meaning and others do not. In any given language, {{only a limited number of}} the many distinct sounds that can be created by the human vocal apparatus contribute to constructing meaning.|$|E
5|$|However, {{the sort}} of {{authority}} accorded by this position is widely discussed. The problem arise from the word MTQNNʿ; its exact <b>meaning</b> <b>is</b> debated. The word is translated to Latin as corrector but restitutor is another possible translation; the latter title was an honorary one meant to praise the bearer for driving enemies out of Roman territories. However, the inscription of Vaballathus is clearer as the word PNRTTʿ is not a Palmyrene word but a direct Palmyrene translation of the Greek term Epanorthotes which is usually an equivalent to corrector.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the more}} notable uses of this <b>meaning</b> <b>is</b> found in The Wonderful Wizard of Oz. The Emerald City in this story {{is a place where}} {{everyone}} wears tinted glasses that make everything appear green. According to the populist interpretation of the story, the city’s color is used by the author, L. Frank Baum, to illustrate the financial system of America in his day, as he lived in a time when America was debating the use of paper money versus gold.|$|E

5|$|Shaw is {{the only}} {{religious}} believer in the crew and openly displays her religious belief with a necklace of a Christian cross. Lindelof said that with her scientific knowledge, her beliefs felt outdated in 2093. Shaw is excited when she learns that she {{was created by the}} Engineers and not a supernatural deity, but rather than cause her to lose her faith, it reinforces it. Lindelof said that asking questions and searching for <b>meaning</b> <b>is</b> the point of being alive, and so the audience is left to question whether Shaw was protected by God because of her faith. Scott wanted the film to end with Shaw's declaration that she is still searching for definitive answers. In addition to the religious themes, Lindelof said that Prometheus is pro-science and explores whether scientific knowledge and faith in God can co-exist.|$|E
5|$|The Gaelic overkingdom of Dál Riata was on {{the western}} coast of modern Scotland, with some {{territory}} on the northern coasts of Ireland. It probably ruled from the fortress of Dunadd, now near Kilmartin in Argyll and Bute. In the late 6th and early 7th centuries, it encompassed roughly what is now Argyll and Bute and Lochaber in Scotland, and also County Antrim in Ireland. Dál Riata is commonly viewed as having been an Irish Gaelic colony in Scotland, although some archaeologists have recently argued against this. The inhabitants of Dál Riata are {{often referred to as}} Scots, from Latin scotti, a name used by Latin writers for the inhabitants of Ireland. Its original <b>meaning</b> <b>is</b> uncertain, but it later refers to Gaelic-speakers, whether from Ireland or elsewhere.|$|E
5|$|The logical {{positivism}} movement {{originated in the}} Vienna Circle and was continued by British philosopher A. J. Ayer. The Vienna Circle adopted the distinction between analytic and synthetic statements: analytic statements are those whose <b>meaning</b> <b>is</b> contained within the words themselves, such as definitions, tautologies or mathematical statements, while synthetic statements make claims about reality. To determine whether a synthetic statement is meaningful, the Vienna Circle developed a verifiability theory of meaning, which proposed that for a synthetic statement to have cognitive meaning, its truthfulness must be empirically verifiable. Because claims about God cannot be empirically verified, the logical positivists argued that religious propositions are meaningless.|$|E
40|$|It's {{sometimes}} {{thought that}} context-invariant linguistic <b>meaning</b> must <b>be</b> a character (a function from context types to contents) i. e. that linguistic meaning must {{determine how the}} content of an expression is fixed in context.

5|$|The {{object of}} the compilers of these {{charters}} was to express their meaning {{by the use of}} the greatest possible number of words and by the choice of the most grandiloquent, bombastic words they could find. Every sentence is so overloaded by the heaping up of unnecessary words that the <b>meaning</b> <b>is</b> almost buried out of sight. The invocation with its appended clauses, opening with pompous and partly alliterative words, will proceed amongst a blaze of verbal fireworks throughout twenty lines of smallish type, and the pyrotechnic display will be maintained with equal magnificence throughout the whole charter, leaving the reader, dazzled by the glaze and blinded by the smoke, in a state of uncertainty as to the meaning of these frequently untranslatable and usually interminable sentences.|$|E
5|$|This view of {{language}} {{is associated with}} the study {{of language}} in pragmatic, cognitive, and interactive frameworks, as well as in sociolinguistics and linguistic anthropology. Functionalist theories tend to study grammar as dynamic phenomena, as structures that are always in the process of changing as they are employed by their speakers. This view places importance on the study of linguistic typology, or the classification of languages according to structural features, as it can be shown that processes of grammaticalization tend to follow trajectories that are partly dependent on typology. In the philosophy of language, the view of pragmatics as being central to language and <b>meaning</b> <b>is</b> often associated with Wittgenstein's later works and with ordinary language philosophers such as J. L. Austin, Paul Grice, John Searle, and W. O. Quine.|$|E
5|$|The {{first story}} is about the opening of Shiva's third eye when he visits Madurai, {{the capital city of}} the Pandya Kingdom, ruled at that time by Shenbagapandian. Shenbagapandian wants to find the answer to a {{question}} posed by his wife— whether the fragrance from a woman's hair is natural or artificial— and announces a reward of 1000gold coins to anyone who can come up with the answer. A poor poet named Dharumi desperately wants the reward and starts to break down in the Meenakshi Amman Temple. Shiva, hearing his cries, {{takes the form of a}} poet and gives Dharumi a poem containing the answer. Overjoyed, Dharumi takes the poem to Shenbagapandian's court and recites it, but Nakkeerar, the court's head poet, claims the poem's <b>meaning</b> <b>is</b> incorrect. On hearing this, Shiva argues with Nakkeerar about the poem's accuracy, burning him to ashes when he refuses to relent. Later, Shiva revives Nakkeerar, and says that he only wanted to test his knowledge. Nakkeerar asks the king to give the reward to Dharumi.|$|E

5|$|Stelae {{have become}} {{threatened}} {{in modern times}} by plundering for sale on the international art market. Many stelae are found in remote areas and their size and weight prevents them from being removed intact. Various methods are used to cut or break a stela for easier transport, including power saws, chisels, acid and heat. When a monument is well preserved, the looters attempt to cut off its face for transport. Even when successful, this results in damage to inscriptions {{on the sides of}} the stela. At worst, this method results in complete fragmentation of the stela face with any recoverable sculpture removed for sale. Traceable fragments of well known monuments have been purchased by American museums and private collectors in the past. When such monuments are removed from their original context, their historical <b>meaning</b> <b>is</b> lost. Although museums have justified their acquisition of stelae fragments with the argument that such objects are better preserved in an institution, no stela has been sold in as good a condition as it was in its original location. After 1970 there was a sharp drop in Maya stelae available on the New York art market due to the ratification of a treaty with Mexico that guarantees the return of stolen pre-Columbian sculpture that was removed from the country after the ratification date. In the early 1970s some museums, such as that of the University of Pennsylvania, responded to international criticism by no longer purchasing archaeological artefacts that lack a legally documented history, including place of origin, previous owners and an export license. Harvard University also instituted a similar policy in the early 1970s.|$|E
