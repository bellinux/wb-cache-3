5|$|At the docks, {{the company}} ran {{a total of}} 41 tips of various kinds, 47 <b>mooring</b> buoys, and kept tugs, launches, a dredger, a firefloat, and even had its own diver and police force.|$|E
5|$|Ships {{were ordered}} to make for the open ocean. Chicago left her {{anchorage}} at 02:14, leaving a sailor behind on the <b>mooring</b> buoy in her haste to depart. Bombay, Whyalla, Canberra, and Perkins began their preparations to depart.|$|E
5|$|At around 1:30am {{the tide}} had risen {{enough to allow}} the LFEE's {{floating}} fire engine to arrive on the scene. Braidwood had called for the engine five hours previously, but the low tide had hampered its progress from its downriver <b>mooring</b> at Rotherhithe. Once it arrived it was effective in bringing under control the fire that had taken hold in the Speaker's House.|$|E

5|$|August 27–28, 1878 – Streets are {{clogged with}} fallen trees as a {{hurricane}} passes to the north. At {{the height of}} a storm, a floating dry dock—the largest ever built at the time—is damaged after breaking from its moorings at HM Dockyard, crushing wharves and a <b>mooring</b> bridge. The dock came to rest on a breakwater.|$|E
5|$|In 1907, John Clark Udall oversaw {{construction}} of a north wing, {{increasing the number of}} rooms to 150. In 1909, Udall oversaw a 72-room seven-story west wing, further increasing the rooms to 221. In Germany, it was advertised in January 1909 that the management of the Briarcliff Lodge and its architect Guy King planned to construct the platform to launch and dock airships, to cost $100,000. The platform would extend over the whole roof, and the tracks for the airship launch would be on an incline 105 meters long. The plans also included the purchase of a searchlight to guide the airships. A <b>mooring</b> mast for docking airships was constructed on top of the west wing, however no record exists of it having been used. The <b>mooring</b> mast nonetheless was the first built for docking airships.|$|E
5|$|On March 17, 2017, archaeologists {{announced}} that they have uncovered the partially submerged remains of the anchorage used by the Greek warships prior to the Battle of Salamis.

5|$|Operations aboard oil tankers {{are governed}} by an {{established}} body of best practices and {{a large body of}} international law. Cargo can be moved on or off of an oil tanker in several ways. One method is for the ship to moor alongside a pier, connect with cargo hoses or marine loading arms. Another method involves <b>mooring</b> to offshore buoys, such as a single point <b>mooring,</b> and making a cargo connection via underwater cargo hoses. A third method is by ship-to-ship transfer, also known as lightering. In this method, two ships come alongside in open sea and oil is transferred manifold to manifold via flexible hoses. Lightering is sometimes used where a loaded tanker is too large to enter a specific port.|$|E
5|$|The ferry {{currently}} operates {{between a}} floating boathouse {{on the north}} bank of the Thames and a rudimentary jetty on the south bank. The boathouse is also in use as a private <b>mooring</b> for leisure craft. The ferry operates on all weekends, and weekdays between February and October. As well as the ferry service, rowboats, canoes and motorboats can also be hired from the boathouse.|$|E
5|$|In 1761 John Griffin {{published}} {{a letter in}} the London Chronicle recommending methods for entering the Camel estuary during rough weather, particularly while north-northwest winds were blowing and described the bolts and rings he had fixed to the cliffs to assist ships trying to enter the harbour. <b>Mooring</b> rings were still there in 1824, and around 1830, three capstans {{at the base of}} the cliffs and bollards along the cliffs, by which means boats could be warped safely past the bar were installed.|$|E

The two ships then journeyed to several German ports: both put in at Wilhelmshaven before Rivadavia went to Hamburg and Moreno to Bremen. They returned to Argentina on 29 June.|$|E
5|$|In September 1929 Casey was {{assigned}} to the Rivers and Harbors Section of the Office of the Chief of Engineers in Washington, DC. This job involved reviewing the project studies, plans and specifications of all river and harbor projects throughout the United States, including flood control and hydroelectric power projects. He also had responsibility for correspondence with U.S. senators and congressmen. During this time he co-designed and patented the Kingman-Casey Floating <b>Mooring</b> Bit for navigation locks. He was promoted to the substantive rank of captain on 1 May 1933.|$|E
5|$|The committee's {{final report}} {{determined}} that along {{the whole of}} the rocky coast between Land's End and Hartland Point, Padstow was the only potentially safe harbour for the coasting trade when the most dangerous north-westerly onshore gales were blowing. It noted that Padstow's safety was compromised by the Doom Bar and by the eddy-forming effect of Stepper Point. The report recommended initial expenditure of £20,000 to cut down the outer part of Stepper Point, which, in conjunction with the capstans, bollards and <b>mooring</b> rings, would significantly reduce the risk to shipping.|$|E
50|$|Before the 1911 Ceylon Census <b>Moors</b> in Sri Lanka {{were counted}} as one. From the census onwards they {{were divided into}} Indian <b>Moors</b> and Sri Lankan <b>Moors.</b> Indian <b>Moors</b> were brought to Sri Lanka {{for the same reasons}} as the Indian Tamils, as labourers to the plantations. In 1971 Indian <b>Moors</b> {{numbered}} 29,416 declining from 55,400 in 1963. Their decline was partly due to returning to India and some declaring themselves and being enumerated as Sri Lankan <b>Moors.</b> Indian <b>Moors</b> were mostly found in the Colombo and Kandy Districts.|$|R

5|$|From 1927 to 1942, Kasuga {{was used}} as a {{training}} vessel for navigators and engineers. On 27 July 1928 she rescued the crew of the semi-rigid airship N3 after it exploded in heavy weather during fleet maneuvers. In January–February 1934, Kasuga ferried 40 scientists to Truk to observe a total solar eclipse on 14 February. She was hulked and disarmed in July 1942 and used as a floating barracks {{for the rest of the}} Pacific War. Kasuga capsized at her <b>mooring</b> at Yokosuka on 18 July 1945 during an air raid by United States Navy aircraft from TF-38. Her wreck was salvaged in August 1948 and broken up for scrap by the Uraga Dock Company.|$|E

50|$|The native {{population}} of the island at this time was predominately Buddhist mostly from the ethnic group Sinhalese. There existed a Muslim minority known as the <b>Moors.</b> The <b>Moor</b> community consisted of two segments, the Ceylon <b>Moors</b> who originated from the Arab traders who settled in the Island {{about five or six}} centuries before and the Indian <b>Moors</b> who were at the time natives and residents of South India, who had come to Ceylon for trade. By 1915, the Ceylon <b>Moors</b> who had controlled trade {{in most parts of the}} island had been ousted by the Indian <b>Moors.</b> The 1911 Census indicates that Ceylon <b>Moors</b> numbered 232,927 and Indian <b>Moors</b> 33,527.

50|$|The Black <b>Moor,</b> {{along with}} the Red <b>Moor,</b> {{is one of the}} larger <b>moors</b> in the High Rhön, whose name, {{according}} to tradition, comes from the colour of the original vegetation. The vicar cooperator of Simmershausen, Franz Anton Jäger, a keen naturalist, wrote in his letters about the High Rhoene of Franconia, published in 1803, that the Black <b>Moor</b> was much wetter than the Red <b>Moor.</b> As a result, the red Magellan's Peatmoss (Sphagnum magellanicum), the plant that gave the Red <b>Moor</b> its name and which also grew in the Black <b>Moor,</b> became waterlogged as soon as it germinated, became mouldy and black, thus giving rise to the name of the Black <b>Moor.</b> Even today the name appears apt.|$|R
5|$|High relates {{that the}} great serpent Jörmungandr, also {{described}} as a child of Loki in the same source, will breach land as the sea violently swells onto it. The ship Naglfar, described in the Prose Edda as being made from the human nails of the dead, is released from its <b>mooring,</b> and sets sail on the surging sea, steered by a jötunn named Hrym. At the same time, Fenrir, eyes and nostrils spraying flames, charges forward with his mouth wide open, his upper jaw reaching to the heavens, his lower jaw touching the earth. At Fenrir's side, Jörmungandr sprays venom throughout {{the air and the}} sea.|$|E
5|$|In {{an attempt}} to lure out and destroy {{a portion of the}} Grand Fleet, the High Seas Fleet, {{composed}} of 16 dreadnoughts, 6 pre-dreadnoughts, 6 light cruisers, and 31 torpedo boats, departed the Jade early on the morning of 31 May. The fleet sailed in concert with Rear Admiral Franz von Hipper's five battlecruisers and supporting cruisers and torpedo boats. The Royal Navy's Room 40 had intercepted and decrypted German radio traffic containing plans of the operation. In response the Admiralty ordered the Grand Fleet, totalling some 28 dreadnoughts and 9 battlecruisers, to sortie the night before to cut off and destroy the High Seas Fleet. Barham slipped her <b>mooring</b> at 22:08 and was followed by the rest of Beatty's ships.|$|E
5|$|Komet {{returned}} to Nauru following the unsuccessful attempt to mine Rabaul, and arrived {{off the island}} at 05:45 {{on the morning of}} 27December. After issuing a warning for those on shore to not use radio and signalling her intent to destroy the phosphate loading plant, she opened fire at 06:40. The bombardment lasted for about an hour, during which time the raider wrecked the loading plant, oil tanks, boats, buildings and <b>mooring</b> buoys. Following this attack, she sailed to the south-east and Nauru broadcast news of the attack to Australia. This was the last visit of German ships to Nauru during the war, and Komet transferred her activities to the Indian Ocean.|$|E
50|$|The Red <b>Moor</b> is {{the largest}} raised bog in Hesse, {{followed}} by the <b>moor</b> in the Breungeshain Heath (4 ha) on the uplands of the Vogelsberg.

As a result of centuries of peat extraction, which lasted until the 1980s, only an area of about five hectares is left as a core zone. The Red <b>Moor</b> is divided into two areas: The Great Red <b>Moor</b> (Großes Rotes <b>Moor,</b> formerly 32 hectares of raised bog - today just under 11 ha) and the Little Red <b>Moor</b> (Kleines Rotes <b>Moor,</b> formerly 7 hectares of raised bog - today 1.7 ha).
