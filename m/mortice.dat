5|$|The {{bones and}} joints form a {{mechanical}} structure with features comparable to hinges, <b>mortice</b> and tenon and {{ball and socket}} joints, etc, to provide both support and suitable flexibility. He compares the spine to The Iron Bridge at Bishop Wearmouth.|$|E
5|$|The {{house is}} built with stone foundations, {{and the main}} {{structure}} is made of oak timbers, joined together using <b>mortice</b> and tenon joints, and held in place with oak pegs. Wattle and daub or lath and plaster are used to fill the spaces between the timbers. The black and white appearance from the timber framing construction dates from the Tudor period, though some parts have been repaired in later years.|$|E
25|$|The corr had a brass strap {{nailed to}} each side, pierced by tapered brass tuning pins. The treble end had a tenon which fitted {{into the top}} of the com (soundbox). On a low-headed harp the corr was morticed at the bass end to receive a tenon on the làmh-chrann; on a high-headed harp this tenon fitted into a <b>mortice</b> {{on the back of the}} làmh-chrann.|$|E

2500|$|The other {{remarkable}} {{item was}} the torc or collar which is [...] in diameter with buffer terminals, using a <b>mortice</b> and tenon fastening.

60|$|Feeling safe in a {{conclusion}} {{that he did not}} intend to return to the bedroom again, she arose, and hastily dressed herself. On going {{to the door of the}} apartment she found that he had locked it behind him. 'A precaution--it can be no more,' she muttered. Yet she was all the more perplexed and excited on this account. Had he been going to leave home immediately, he would scarcely have taken the trouble to lock her in, holding the belief that she was in a drugged sleep. The lock shot into a <b>mortice,</b> so that there was no possibility of her pushing back the bolt. How should she follow him? Easily. An inner closet opened from the bedroom: it was large, and had some time heretofore been used as a dressing or bath room, but had been found inconvenient from having no other outlet to the landing. The window of this little room looked out upon the roof of the porch, which was flat and covered with lead. Anne took a pillow from the bed, gently opened the casement of the inner room and stepped forth on the flat. There, leaning over the edge of the small parapet that ornamented the porch, she dropped the pillow upon the gravel path, and let herself down over the parapet by her hands till her toes swung about two feet from the ground. From this position she adroitly alighted upon the pillow, and stood in the path.|$|E
50|$|Chain mortisers, used {{to cut the}} <b>mortice</b> {{of large}} <b>mortice</b> and tenon timber framing use a number of chains, riveted side-by-side. They are used with a {{vertical}} tip-first plunge. Owing {{to the difficulty of}} resharpening the multiple teeth, these are usually made of long-lasting tungsten carbide.|$|E
50|$|The Brake Wheel {{has been}} {{converted}} from Compass arm construction to clasp arm construction, it is 7 ft diameter with 63 cogs. The mill was originally built with {{a single pair of}} millstones in the breast, but now has two pairs. The Upright Shaft is cast iron, and carries three wheels. There is a cast iron <b>mortice</b> wheel with 66 cogs drives a flour dresser. The Wallower is an iron <b>mortice</b> gear with 24 cogs, and the Spur Wheel is also an iron <b>mortice</b> gear, with 63 cogs. The stone nuts have 20 cogs each.|$|E
50|$|Ribs are 3/8 {{inch thick}} {{rather than the}} more common 5/16 inch and are tapered to about 1-1/8 inch wide at the tip. In closed gunwale canoes, the ends of ribs are {{inserted}} into <b>mortices</b> in the inwale.|$|R
50|$|In 1946 a {{programme}} {{was introduced}} to modify the gun's breech ring by <b>morticing</b> the rear corners. A corresponding modification was made to the rear corners of the breech block. This was to reduce the instances of cracking the ring.|$|R
50|$|The {{ground floor}} stone walling was an {{original}} {{feature of the}} building (there were no peg holes or <b>mortices</b> {{to show that it}} replaced earlier timbering), though the windows in it were timber-mullioned. The first-floor windows projected from the walls.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Mortice</b> {{the blocks}} by a {{self-acting}} machine. The morticing chisel reciprocated vertically, {{and at the}} same time the vice gripping the block was gradually moved each cut. Once the length of the <b>mortice</b> had been cut the machine automatically stopped to allow the block to be replaced with a new one.|$|E

50|$|The {{machines}} were of 22 types and totalled 45. They were driven by two 30 hp (22.4 kW) steam engines. The machines included circular saws, pin turning machines and <b>morticing</b> machines. With these machines 10 men could produce as many blocks as 110 skilled craftsmen.|$|R
50|$|Finally, {{there is}} the concealed, jamb-mounted door closer, which fits in <b>morticed</b> {{recesses}} {{in the door and}} door frame and is totally concealed when the door is closed.

25|$|From the Bf 109 G-5 on an {{enlarged}} wooden tail unit (identifiable by a taller vertical stabilizer and rudder with a <b>morticed</b> balance tab, {{rather than the}} angled shape) was often fitted. This tail unit was standardised on G-10s and K-4s. Although the enlarged tail unit improved handling, especially on the ground, it weighed more than the standard metal tail unit and required that a counterweight was fitted in the nose, increasing the variant's overall weight.|$|R
50|$|The {{technique}} {{was described by}} Julius Caesar in his Commentaries on the Gallic Wars:But this is usually the form of all the Gallic walls. Straight beams, connected lengthwise and two feet distant from each other at equal intervals, are placed together on the ground; these are <b>morticed</b> on the inside, and covered with plenty of earth. But the intervals which we have mentioned, are closed up in front by large stones. These being thus laid and cemented together, another row is added above, in such a manner, that the same interval may be observed, and that the beams may not touch one another, but equal spaces intervening, each row of beams is kept firmly in its place by a row of stones. In this manner the whole wall is consolidated, until the regular height of the wall be completed.... it possesses great advantages as regards utility and the defence of cities; for the stone protects it from fire, and the wood from the battering ram, since it wood being <b>morticed</b> in the inside with rows of beams, generally forty feet each in length, can neither be broken through nor torn asunder.|$|R
50|$|At {{various times}} {{low and high}} level {{partitions}} have been added. Evidence of this activity is present in chisel work, nail holes, <b>mortices</b> and the impression of boards in remaining timbers. Most of the floor is nineteenth century concrete with drainage channels. This appears {{to be associated with}} the housing of cattle. In other parts of the barn earthen and chalk floors can be found. In bays 8 and 9 worn cobbles and granite setts are again associated with animals, particularly with a nearby stable door and chewed timbers.|$|R
