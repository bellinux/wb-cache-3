A four year study to (i) evaluate water and sediment fluxes at different spatio-temporal scales and (ii) interpret the results in terms of processes involved and the controlling factors, was conducted in Thukela basin, South Africa. Five hierarchically nested catchments; namely <b>microcatchment</b> (0. 23 km 2), subcatchment (1. 20 km 2), catchment (9. 75 km 2), sub-basin (253 km 2) and basin (29, 038 km 2), were used in addition to fifteen (1 m 2) microplots and ten (10 m 2) plots on five locations within the <b>microcatchment.</b> The results showed 19 % decrease of unit-area runoff (q) from 3. 1 L m? 2 day? 1 at microplot to 2. 5 L m? 2 day? 1 at plot scale followed by steeper (56 %) decrease at <b>microcatchment</b> scale. The q decreased in downstream direction to very low level (q ? 0. 26 L m? 2 day? 1). The changes in q were accompanied by initial 1 % increase of soil loss (SL) from 18. 8 g m? 2 day? 1 at microplot to 19. 1 g m? 2 day? 1 at plot scale. The SL also decreased sharply (by 39 fold) to 0. 50 g m? 2 day? 1 at <b>microcatchment</b> scale, followed by further decrease in downstream direction. The decrease of q with spatial scale was attributed to infiltration losses, while initial increase of SL signified greater competence of sheet than splash erosion. The decrease of SL beyond the plot scale was attributed to redistribution of the soil on the hillslope and deposition on the stream channel upstream of the <b>microcatchment</b> outlet. Therefore, erosion control strategies focussing on the recovery of vegetation on the slope and stabilisation of gullies are recommended...|$|E

40|$|Globally {{agricultural}} rangelands {{have been}} subjected to degradation through over-utilization. The loss of productivity of agricultural rangelands around the world has {{led to the development of}} methods to restore the productivity of these areas. In South Africa, extensive areas of the Nama-Karoo have been degraded or transformed due in part to unsustainable agricultural activities. The development of restoration methods which are easily implementable and financially viable could increase the probability of stakeholders implementing restoration activities on privately owned land. The removal of the degrading factor is not sufficient to reverse the degradative trend in dryland environments. Active measures must be implemented to arrest the degradation cascade. The climatic conditions of the rangelands of South Africa are limiting to plant performance and the favourable conditions are sporadic. The translocation of plants should be combined with the amelioration of the local conditions. This study tested the restoration technique of <b>microcatchments</b> in association with plant translocation. The effects of <b>microcatchments</b> and planting combinations which were best suited to the survival and performance of the transplants were determined through a field trail. The results showed that <b>microcatchments</b> created microsites which were conducive to transplant survival and growth, including nutrient accumulation and increased soil moisture. The success of the method was dependent on the planting combination used. Plants which are adapted to inundation and the saline conditions of the site performed better. Plants which were older at the time of translocation had higher survival rates than younger transplants. In the conditions of this site, planting adjacent to the <b>microcatchments</b> was necessary to avoid inundation induced mortalities.

40|$|Water erosion {{provides}} major {{links in}} global cycles of carbon (C), nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P). Although significant research on erosion mechanisms has been done, {{there is still}} little knowledge on C, N and P fluxes across landscapes to the ocean and their controlling factors in subtropical climates. A four-year study quantifying and comparing particulate and dissolved C, N and P from multiple scales (microplot, plot, <b>microcatchment,</b> subcatchment, catchment, sub-basin and basin) was performed in Thukela basin (≈ 30 000 [*]km 2), South Africa. The basin climate was largely subtropical-humid [mean annual precipitation (MAP) > 980 [*]mm yr- 1], but temperate (MAP > 2000 [*]mm yr- 1) on the highlands. Open grassland, cropland and bushland were the major land uses. On average, 65, 24 and 4 [*]g m- 2 [*]yr- 1 C, N and P were displaced from original topsoil positions, but only 0. 33, 0. 005 and 0. 002 [*]mg m- 2 [*]yr- 1 were, respectively, exported to the ocean. The fluxes decreased by 95, 97 and 84 %, respectively, from plot to <b>microcatchment</b> outlet; and decreased further in downstream direction by > 99 % from <b>microcatchment</b> to basin outlet. The hillslope (microplot to <b>microcatchment)</b> fluxes correlated strongly with rainfall parameters. Particulate contributions dominated hillslope fluxes at 73, 81 and 76 % of total annual C, N and P, respectively. Although particulate C dominated in the microcatchment-catchment reach (55 %), N (54 %) and P (69 %) were dominated by dissolved forms. The lower basin zone was dominated by dissolved flux contributions at 93, 81 and 78 % for C, N and P for the sub-basin outlet. These results suggested spatially varying drivers of C, N and P losses from the landscape to the ocean, via the river network. Deposition was envisaged the dominant hillslope level loss process, which gradually gave way to mineralization and biotic uptake in the river network as flux contributions shifted from being predominantly particulate to dissolved forms...|$|E
40|$|Water {{harvesting}} {{techniques were}} used for increasing water availability for rainfed agriculture and for human consumption. The treatments involving soil and water management for cropping were as follows: (1) traditional; (2) microcatchment; (3) <b>microcatchment</b> plus fertilization with ordinary superphosphate (OSP); (4) <b>microcatchment</b> plus fertilization with manure; and (5) supplemental tank irrigation. A cistern with 50 m³ capacity was constructed to provide drinking water. The crop enterprises were cowpeas (Vigna unguiculata) /corn (Zea mays), and sorghum (Sorghum bicolor) /cactus (Opuntia spp.) /algaroba (Prosopis juliflora). Both were intercropped. The overall objectives of the study were: (1) to {{examine the impact of}} the application of water harvesting techniques together with crop management, with and 14 without fertilization on: farmer, (ii) profitability cropping, and (iii) labor benefit of a cistern based (i) financial position of the of each individual enterprise in utilization; (2) to estimate the on the costs of carrying water. All analysis were developed with the aid of Supercalc 4 spreadsheet software. Farm performance measures were: crop production; cash flows; income statements, net worth; cost and returns statements; and labor utilization. The impact of the household cistern was assessed through a benefit cost approach. From the results the following main conclusions were drawn: (1) <b>microcatchment</b> contributed marginally to increased yields; (2) <b>microcatchment</b> combined with OSP produced yield increases which were twice those of the traditional process; (3) tank irrigation with OSP quadrupled the traditional productivities; (4) the sorghum/cactus/algaroba enterprise presented a better cash position than cowpeas/ corn; (5) the farm can support the investments necessary for the application of water harvesting since it is financially liquid and solvent; (6) significant increase in net income was achieved when water harvesting was combined with fertilization for both enterprises; (7) the existing family labor potential on the farm is enough to supply the demand imposed by any one of the soil and water management treatment; (8) if opportunity cost of labor is involved in assessing the profitability of cropping, the most profitable soil and water management practice was tank irrigation; and (9) the construction of a cistern is an economical and feasible decision...|$|E
40|$|Soil loss is {{commonly}} estimated using the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE). Since RUSLE is an empirically based soil-loss model derived from surveys on plots, the high {{spatial and temporal}} variability of erosion in Mediterranean environments and scale effects mean {{that it is necessary}} to evaluate the model in other spatial units such as the <b>microcatchment.</b> In this study, a series of topographic and soil surveys was carried out on a <b>microcatchment</b> of 6. 7 ha in a mountainous area under no-tillage farming with bare soil in order to examine spatial and temporal results produced by RUSLE. GPS measurements of the microrelief height differences were used in a control area in the <b>microcatchment</b> to compare observed erosion and deposition with RUSLE predictions. Erosion points located in certain areas correlate very closely with RUSLE predictions, while the distribution of deposition points showed no correlations with RUSLE predictions. Secondly, a time series of daily rainfall data was used to calculate annual erosivity values, which were fitted to an appropriate distribution function. It was determined that the rainfall distribution best fitted the Pearson type III distribution function. Next, efforts were made to quantify the long term erosion and to check the suitability of the land-use and management under different thresholds of tolerance. It was found that values of erosivity in the study area with a return period of 10 years generate a mean annual erosion of 5 t ha− 1 yr− 1 . On the study scale, RUSLE allowed us to locate the most erosive areas and to combine the suitability of the soil land-use and the management with the frequency of the annual erosivity. In addition, an annual sediment delivery ratio of approximately 47 % was estimated for the period 2005 – 2006...|$|E
30|$|Micro basins, {{also called}} earth basins {{have also been}} used in {{semi-arid}} regions of Africa to capture and hold rainwater (Kassougue et al. 1996). Micro basins are constructed by making low earth ridges on all sides, they are normally circular, and square or diamond shaped micro-catchments which are 1 - 2  m in width and about 0.5  m depth (Mati 2005). In addition, earthen bunds which are of various forms of earth-shapings created for ponding runoff water {{have been used for}} water harvesting in semi arid regions of Africa (Ibraimo and Munguambe 2007). The variations of earthen bunds include contour bunds, semi-circular bunds and Negarims <b>microcatchments</b> which have been used in arid and semi-arid regions where the seasonal rainfall can be as low as 150  mm (Mati 2005). These earthen bunds have been used widely in Kenya, for example in Busia, district of Kenya, while semi-circular bunds are made by digging out holes along the contours. Negarims <b>microcatchments</b> are regular square earth bunds, which have been turned 45 degrees from the contour to concentrate surface runoff at the lowest corner of the square where there is an infiltration pit dug. Fruit trees can be grown in the pits were all the runoff is concentrated.|$|R
40|$|AbstractDemographic {{growth and}} climatic {{change in the}} sub-Sahelian region {{threaten}} the sustainability of environmental resources. Modifying farming practices could help to compensate for harmful changes in environmental conditions. A research program was carried out between 1980 and 1987 in Ziga, in the Yatenga region of Burkina Faso, to identify and evaluate changes in farming practices made to ensure the development of agriculture. In 2005, a survey {{was carried out in}} the same village to assess the changes made to farming practices. This revealed two practices - zaï and djengo - that had not been previously observed or evaluated and which were widely applied in the cultivation systems. Zaï is a traditional technique for restoring degraded soil by capturing runoff using <b>microcatchments</b> and a localized supply of organic matter around the plants. Djengo is based on the same principle as zaï but it is applied on sandy soils whereas zaï is usually applied on degraded, crusty soils. These two practices could increase grain yields and limit the risk of crop failure. Observations also showed that there was frequent tree regeneration in plots and <b>microcatchments</b> where zaï or djengo practices were used. This study highlighted an example of ecological engineering carried out by farmers in sub-Saharan Africa. The development of these practices indicates the importance of the spatial organization of the determining components that drive an ecological system. Further research should be carried out into this concept to help to improve soil fertility management and farming systems in savanna agrosystems...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} soil {{moisture}} dynamics for two subcatchments (Stanley and Krui) in the Goulburn River in NSW during a three year period (2005 - 2007) using the Hydrus 1 -D unsaturated soil water flow model. The model was calibrated on the Stanley <b>microcatchment</b> sites {{with a single}} point rainfall record from this <b>microcatchment</b> for both surface 30 cm and full profile soil moisture measurement. Soil type, leaf area index and soil depth {{were found to be}} the key parameters affecting model performance by shifting the soil moisture time series up and down, changing the steepness of dry-down recessions and driving the lowest point of soil moisture dry-down respectively. Good correlations were obtained between observed and simulated soil water storage (R= 0. 8 ~ 0. 9; RMSE= 1. 8 ~ 3. 0 cm) when calibrated parameters for one site were applied to the other sites. A compromise parameter set that fit all the Stanley sites was obtained by simply altering the soil type slightly. Soil type was also found to be the main determinant (after rainfall) of the mean of modelled soil moisture time series. A consistently observed result was that simulations of topsoil 30 cm were better than those of the whole profile soil. Within the Stanley <b>microcatchment</b> excellent soil moisture matches could be generated simply by adjusting the mean of soil moisture up or down slightly. Our observation that soil type drives the mean soil moisture was confirmed by noting that the soil type needed only minor modification from site to site to enable good prediction for all of the sites within Stanley. Both of the adjustment methods (by changing mean, or soil type) turned out to be good, although the correction by the mean showed slightly better statistical results. We extended the predictions of soil moisture to a larger spatial scale using soil and vegetation parameters from Stanley to the sites in the Krui catchment where soil moisture measurement sites were up to 30 km distant from Stanley. The results showed promising predictability (R= 0. 7 ~ 0. 8; RMSE= 1. 9 ~ 4. 5) if considering the different measured rainfall at the sites.

40|$|Magister Scientiae (Biodiversity and Conservation Biology) Heavy grazing of rangelands in the {{succulent}} karoo {{has placed}} the biodiversity {{of these areas}} at risk. In Paulshoek, overgrazing {{has resulted in the}} removal of much of the palatable vegetation from low lying areas. The remaining vegetation is dominated by Galenia africana, an unpalatable shrub. Loss of favourable microsites, competition from Galenia africana, as well as loss of seed banks, may be the cause of poor seedling establishment of palatable species. I explored how high grazing pressure has changed this system by comparing with surrounding private farms, which have a history of less concentrated grazing pressure. I found that heavy grazing increased the seed bank of Galenia africana in the soil and reduced that of palatable perennials. Vegetation cover was significantly lower (p< 0. 0001) under heavy grazing and consisted mainly of Galenia africana and few palatable perennials. The aim {{of this study was to}} test techniques that could restore this area to a more productive palatable shrubland. I propose that rehabilitation can be used to gain an understanding of the ecological factors that may be sustaining this altered vegetation state. My methodology involved biophysical interventions to manipulate this system. Grazing pressure was removed from the study area and vegetation changes were monitored under grazed and protected regimes. No change in plant cover was found after two years. However, there was an increase in cover of palatable perennials in relation to overall cover. I physically manipulated the environment by introducing <b>microcatchments</b> and brushpacks to act as traps for water, seed and organic material. These interventions resulted in few changes, however, I found higher soil moisture levels in <b>microcatchments</b> and under brushpacks than open positions. Cover of ephemerals was also significantly higher (p< 0. 001) in areas that had been brushpacked. In the absence of a seedbank, I tested whether the introduction of seed would result in recruitment. Seed of four palatable perennial species was sown into open, packed and tilled soil. A low number of seeds germinated in the first year and most seedlings died. Further germination occurred after a rainfall event in the second year, but still in very low numbers. Various microhabitats were implemented to assess seedling establishment requirements. Seedlings were transplanted in <b>microcatchments</b> and open positions; in areas cleared of Galenia, under adult Galenia and brush packs and in bare soil. Microhabitats did not facilitate seedling establishment, and few seedlings survived. Survival of seedlings was influenced by the size of seedling at transplantation and site differences. I conclude that the factors underlying vegetation change are complex. Individual physical and biological interventions offered no immediate change in vegetation cover and composition. However, a combination of interventions may over time and under favourable climatic conditions allow the return of a viable palatable shrubland. South Afric...|$|R

Survey data for 1993 and 1994 are used to estimate Tobit functions, compute elasticities of adoption and intensity of use, perform robustness tests and estimate alternative models. Controlling for land and labor abundance and other factors we find that those who have more ownership rights over farmland, and who do more controlled feeding of livestock, tend to invest more in both technologies. The result suggests that responding to land scarcity with clearer property rights over cropland and pasture could help promote investment in soil conservation, and raise the productivity of factors applied to land.

40|$|Despite {{the fact}} that the <b>microcatchment</b> scale allows us to {{evaluate}} the real complexity of soil protection in fields, few studies have been carried out in olive groves. This paper explores, on annual and event scales, the hydrological and erosive patterns observed in an olive <b>microcatchment</b> of about 6. ha under non-tillage with spontaneous grass cover, where data series of runoff and sediment load have been measured in a contrasting hydrological period of over 5. years. Firstly, the features of the data series acquired in the study station and its temporal context were explored through statistical analysis (statistics, histograms and correlation test), the intensity-duration-frequency relationships and the annual values of MOPREDAS dataset (1946 - 2005). In addition, annual and seasonal patterns were checked through Principal Components Analysis (PCA) to characterize the impact of rainfall variability and management techniques. Events with return periods of under 3. years caused sediment loads between 7. 2 and 17. 0. Mg., which implies that very high soil losses can be expected from frequent events. Although the contribution of a few events to the annual runoff and sediment load is substantial, a different distribution characterized by prolonged rainfall periods and very high soil losses was observed for a >rainy year> 2009 - 2010 (with an accumulated frequency of annual rainfall close to 79 %). The PCA illustrated a seasonal pattern of events where low values of soil losses and sediment concentration were observed in spring. This is probably associated to lower soil moisture and to sediment being trapped by the grass cover. Finally, the minimal cost of the spontaneous cover for soil protection encourages its use, despite {{the fact that}} could be inefficient when inter-rill erosion is either not the main source of sediment in the catchment or it is not well-established. © 2013 Elsevier B.

40|$|Olive {{orchards}} {{located in}} mountainous or hilly landscapes in Southern Spain {{have been identified}} as one of the major sources of sediments for streams in the region. This paper presents a modeling study of the magnitude and spatial distribution of sources of sediment within a small 6. 1 ha olive orchard forming a <b>microcatchment</b> in a mountainous area. The model used was SEDD, which was calibrated using rainfall, runoff and soil erosion patterns monitored over a 3 -year period. Although the data series are incomplete, 46 events were observed. SEDD permitted an analysis of the erosive behavior and the sediment delivery ratio (SDR) in the catchment on an event scale. High variability in catchment responses was observed, due to differences in the characteristics of storms and the seasonal ground cover. A small group of two or three erosive events, occurring mainly in autumn, were responsible for most annual runoff and sediment loads, while the impact of spontaneous grass cover was apparent in events occurring in spring, where, despite high runoff depth, the sediment loss was low. This bimodal tendency justified the calibration of the SEDD model through the medians of β-values in both the periods September-January and February-June. The results of the calibration (E= 0. 97 and RMSE= 0. 03 tha- 1) confirmed the applicability of SEDD to predict soil loss in the <b>microcatchment</b> and to allow us to complete the data series. Although the annual mean of SDR in the catchment for the study period was 3. 8 %, high spatial variability was found in the geomorphological units identified, with SDR values between 0. 3 % and 21. 7 %. On the event scale, probabilities of 50 % for surpassing an SDR value of 10 % were calculated for only 6 % of the catchment area. The location of these most significant sources of sediment will permit the design of more efficient management plans in order to reduce sediment discharge into streams. © 2011 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|In three steep <b>microcatchments</b> under {{tropical}} montane forest, {{samples of}} rainfall, throughfall, organic layer solution (lateral flow), mineral soil solution, and stream water were collected between 23 August 2000 and 15 August 2001. Water samples were analysed for O and partly H isotopes to elucidate the preferential directions — vertical versus lateral — of water flow paths in soils {{and how they}} are linked to the precipitation and soil water regime. Additional soil moisture measurements were conducted to support the isotope study. The δ 18 O of rainfall shows large variations (− 12. 6 to + 2. 1 ‰) related to different air-masses. There is no correlation between δ 18 O values in rainfall, temperature, and rainfall amount. Local meteoric water lines for rainfall and throughfall suggested that evaporation was minimal. The δ 18 O values of throughfall and lateral flow are similar to those in rainfall. Variations in δ 18 O values of the soil solution and the stream water are smaller (− 9. 1 to − 3. 0 and − 8. 7 to − 5. 8 ‰) than those of rainfall, throughfall, and lateral flow. The δ 18 O values in stream water increased immediately after an intense rainstorm event to isotope values similar to those of rainfall and lateral flow indicating that during elevated rainfall the water flows rapidly in the organic layers to the stream channel paralleling the surface. This finding was confirmed by the higher volume of water in the organic layer than in the upper mineral soil during the rainstorm event. Our findings suggest that water flow paths through the ecosystem are dominated by vertical directions through the soil profile to the stream channels during normal wet conditions, interrupted by short-term flow direction changes to lateral pathways mainly in the organic layers during rainstorm events. Results from an isotope two-component hydrograph separation for the three <b>microcatchments</b> showed that new rain water (‘event water’) contributed 81, 44, and 78...|$|R

In this paper a comparison is made between the impact {{of land use}} methods {{on the quality of}} water in the streams which drain various catchment areas. For this purpose three microcatchments were selected which are located in agricultural, rural settlements, and forested areas. Water samples were physically and chemically analysed in order to determine: nitrates, nitrites, ammonia, phosphates, sulphates, chlorides, calcium, magnesium, dissolved oxygen, reaction and conductivity. The above studies were conducted in the 2006 and 2007. Our analysis of the collected materials allows us to affi rm that land use methods have a signifi cant impact on the water quality of the streams which drain the area. Rural settlement has the most negative infl uence on the water quality, followed by typical agricultural use. Based on the direct quality evaluations of single water samples, it has been found that only water from forested areas can be qualifi ed as belonging to the 1 st cleanness class.

40|$|A {{conceptual}} and experimental analysis of rainfall-runoff hydraulics on a natural <b>microcatchment</b> {{was conducted in}} the Negev Desert, Israel. The kinematic wave equations were utilized as a physically-based, hydrodynamic model because they can mathematically describe the simultaneous processes of rainfall, infiltration, and runoff. Model inputs are rainfall and infiltration rates, catchment response time, and flow velocity. A series of experiments was conducted over a range of rainfall intensities using a rainfall simulator. The slope of the infiltration curve, time when runoff begins, time to peak, and peak discharge {{were found to be}} dependent on rainfall intensity. Owing to its effects on infiltration, the highest rainfall intensity did not produce the largest water yield. Velocity was found to be independent of flow depth and a linear function of rainfall intensity. The concept of constant velocity linearized the kinematic wave equation and enabled analytic solutions to be developed. These solutions are not unique; graphical fitting or multiple regression should be used to identify optimal parameter values. Model equations can be used to calculate the catchment size necessary to supply the water requirements of a given tree species and can be applied in regions where computer use is not feasible...|$|E

Five varieties, Gola, Ben Gurion, Seb, Umran and Kaithli, were grafted on six rootstocks of Z. mauritiana from various agroecological zones of Niger. Trees were planted inside <b>microcatchments</b> at 8 × 8 m spacing. Over a period of six years, the variety Umran gave the highest fruit yield (3600 kg·ha− 1) and the lowest fruit yield was documented for variety Seb (1970 kg·ha− 1). Individual fruit weight ranged from 25. 8 g for ‘Umran’ to 9. 5 g for ‘Seb’. The rootstocks had no effect on average fruits yields and fruit size. There was a significant linear correlation between fruit yield and annual rainfall. In a rainy year (680 mm), the average yield of the five varieties was 7580 kg·ha− 1.

40|$|The {{conversion}} of natural grasslands to both pine plantations and cultivation was {{studied in the}} South American tropical alpine ecosystem called páramo. Hydrological and meteorological {{data were collected from}} four <b>microcatchments,</b> each with predominant vegetation,. The water balance was analysed in order to obtain the evapotranspiration of each catchment. The natural grasslands catchments had the lowest evapotranspiration. Evaporation in the cultivated catchment was about 20 - 40 % higher, compared to 40 - 70 % in the pine catchment. Flow duration curves were derived from the discharge time series and used to assess differences in the hydrological response of the catchments. The cultivated catchment is characterized by a significantly faster hydrological response than the natural catchment. The flow duration curves show higher peak flows and lower base flows. In the pine catchment, both peak and base flow are drastically lower because of higher local consumption. In the past, pine plantations have been widely considered as a viable method to improve the economic return of the páramo.

40|$|Wildfires and {{agricultural}} activities are relevant factors affecting soil quality, hydrological cycle and sedimentary dynamics. Land abandonment leads to afforestation, which increases fire risk and land degradation. However, no studies have yet evaluated {{the effect of}} combining the two factors, which occur frequently in Mediterranean ecosystems. This study assessed the changes in soil quality caused by the abandonment of terraces in two microcatchments (< 2. 5 ha) affected distinctly by wildfires (once and twice burned) and in an unburned control <b>microcatchment</b> by analyzing soil quality parameters, biochemical indices and spatial patterns of hydrological and sediment connectivity. Soil samples were collected in thirty-six plots (25 m 2) representing terraced and non-terraced areas within these microcatchments. Unburned non-terraced plots had higher organic matter content and higher microbiological and enzymatic activities than other plots. Plots in abandoned terraces had lower soil quality indices, regardless of the fire effect. Land abandonment induced changes in the spatial patterns of hydrological connectivity, leading to concentrated runoff, enhanced erosion and soil degradation. Fire also negatively affected soil quality in both terraced and non-terraced plots.

However, work carried out on others land uses in the Mediterranean area have justified that the description of soil losses resulting from concentrated flow is essential since it can jeopardise production and sustainability of commercial farms (e. g.

The classes are distinguished in the field by the 'textural feel' which can be further clarified by separating the relative proportions of sand, silt and clay using grading sieves, the particle size distribution. The class is then used to determine crop suitability and to approximate the soils responses to environmental and management conditions such as drought or calcium (lime) requirements. Rainfall – runoff processes in tropical <b>microcatchments</b> are driven by a combination of factors like rainfall characteristics, soil physical conditions, slope gradients and vegetation types.

Such practices fall into three gen-eral categories: (a) construction of physical structures, such as rock barriers, contour bunds, bench terraces and surface drainage ways; (b) establishing vegetative barriers, such as cover crops, residue mulches, and tree or grass contour barriers; and (c) implementing integrated wa-tershed management plans that harmonize {{upstream and downstream}} land use systems within a watershed.
