40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with the development of new mathematical models for the IEEE 802. 11 &# 146;s access mechanisms, with a particular focus on DCF and EDCA. Accurate mathematical models for the DCF and EDCA access mechanisms provide many benefits, such as improved performance analysis, easier network capacity planning, and robust network design. A feature that permeates the work presented in this thesis is the application of our new models to network environments where both saturated and non-saturated traffic sources are present. The scenario in which multiple traffic sources are present is more technically challenging, but provides for a more realistic setting. Our first contribution is {{the development of a new}} Markov model for non-saturated DCF in order to predict the network throughput. This model takes into account several details of the protocol that have been hitherto neglected. In addition, we apply a novel treatment of the packet service time within our model. We show how the inclusion of these effects provides more accurate predictions of network throughput than earlier works. Our second contribution is the development of a new analytical model for EDCA, again in order to predict network throughput. Our new EDCA model is based on a replacement of the normal AIFS parameter of EDCA with a new parameter more closely associated with DCF. This novel procedure allows EDCA to be viewed as a modified multi-mode version of DCF. Our third contribution is the simultaneous application of our new Markov models to both the non-saturated and the saturated regime. Hitherto, network throughput predictions for these regimes have required completely separate mathematical models. The convergence property of our model in the two regimes provides a new method to estimate the network capacity of the network. Our fourth contribution relates to predictions for the <b>multimedia</b> <b>capacity</b> of 802. 11 networks. Our <b>multimedia</b> <b>capacity</b> analysis, which is based on modifications to our Markov model, is new in that it can be applied to a broad range of quality of service requirements.

40|$|Abstract — A closed-form {{capacity}} quasi-optimal power alloca-tion {{scheme is}} presented for the uplink of multimedia CDMA systems with randomized received SIR {{resulted from the}} errors of power control. The optimality in capacity comes from that this scheme provides class-dependent SIR margins subject to the constraint of differentiated outage requirements. The statistics of signal under imperfect power control is modeled as log-normal random variable. The objective of capacity maximization is formulated as the minimization of total average received powers since the capacity of a CDMA system is interference limited. Under this model, we first derive the necessary conditions that a capacity-optimal power allocation should satisfy. By using con-servative bounds, we provide a closed-form approximate solution to this optimization problem. This approximate solution provides nearly the same admissible region for multimedia traffic under imperfect power control as the accurate solution (the optimal one) does. The closed-form quasi-optimal power allocation scheme proposed in this paper is just based on this approximate solution. By numerical example we verify our analysis and show that great capacity gain (e. g. 92 % as a maximum in the example) {{can be achieved by}} our scheme over its counterpart.

Since streaming applications tend to be long running, wireless network interface card’s (WNIC) energy consumption is particularly an acute problem. In this work, we explore the WNIC energy consumption implications of popular multimedia streaming formats from Microsoft (Windows media), Real (Real media) and Apple (Quick Time). We investigate the energy consumption under varying stream bandwidth and network loss rates. We also explore history-based client-side strategies to reduce the energy consumed by transitioning the WNICs to a lower power consuming sleep state. We show that Microsoft media tends to transmit packets at regular intervals; streams optimized for 28. 8 Kbps can save over 80 % in energy consumption with 2 % data loss. A high bandwidth stream (768 Kbps) can still save 57 % in energy consumption with less than 0. 3 % data loss. For high bandwidth streams, Microsoft media exploits network-level packet fragmentation, {{which can lead to}} excessive packet loss (and wasted energy) in a lossy network. Real stream packets tend to be sent closer to each other, especially at higher bandwidths. Quicktime packets sometimes arrive in quick succession; most likely an application level fragmentation mechanism.

Considering the rising popularity of power hungry applications (e. g., <b>multimedia),</b> battery power <b>capacity</b> is an important concern—as upgrades are not keeping up with the advances in other technologies (e. g., central processing unit and memory).

This paper conducts a realistic performance evaluation of a number of widely used multi attribute decision making (MADM) -based methods for network selection that aim at keeping the mobile users Always Best Connected anywhere and anytime. The main trade-off parameters considered include energy efficiency and user perceived quality levels for multimedia streaming.

40|$|Studies of {{computers}} and education have failed {{to account for the}} relevance and importance of tacit assumptions and unquestioned expectations that underlie educational technology practices. A major premise of this dissertation is that it is these taken-for-granted interpretations of technology that most significantly influence how technology is used in the sphere of education. It is thus analytically useful to examine technology use in education by investigating the assumptions on which currently pervasive educational technology practices are built. I employ the concept of "mental models" to study current educational technology practices. An examination of the literature revealed key elements of the prevailing mental model of technology in education, which I call the mental model {{of computers}} as information technology and multimedia machines. In this mental model, computer technology is viewed as a means to provide students and teachers with Internet connectivity and access to extensive, up-to-date information. The computer's <b>multimedia</b> authoring <b>capacity</b> can then be utilized to synthesize the wealth of information culled from Internet sources into presentations with integrated text, graphics, sound, and video. I investigated how this mental model organizes thinking about technology use and education within a large-scale initiative to implement one-to-one computing in public schools, the Maine Learning Technology Initiative (MLTI) The MLTI study highlights the pervasive influence and inherent inertia of an entrenched mental model. (cont.) When users of technology draw upon a well- established and widely-shared mental model to drive their actions around technology, they will likely develop the tendency to view the particular mental model as the way technology is supposed to be used. Their technology experience and pattern of use, guided by the existing mental model, in turn reinforce the community's established mental model of technology use, institutionalizing a set of technology practices and routines. An entrenched mental model can have pervasive influence in limiting individual and collective capacities to pursue possibilities outside of the established approach, or to recognize the need for such pursuit. This was observed during {{the first years of the}} MLTI, and is happening on a larger scale in the education system as more and more computers become available in classrooms. Savalai Vaikakul.

Since streaming applications tend to be long running, wireless network interface card’s (WNIC) energy consumption is particularly an acute problem. In this work, we explore various mechanisms to conserve client WNIC energy consumption for popular streaming formats such as Microsoft Windows media, Real and Apple Quicktime. First, we investigate the WNIC energy consumption characteristics for these popular multimedia streaming formats under varying stream bandwidth and network loss rates. We show that even for a high bandwidth 2000 kbps stream, the WNIC unnecessarily spent over 56 % {{of the time in}} idle state; illustrating the potential for significant energy savings. Based on these observations, we explore two mechanisms to conserve the client WNIC energy consumption. First we show the limitations of IEEE 802. 11 power saving mode for such isochronous multimedia streams. Without an understanding of the stream requirements, these scheduled rendezvous mechanisms do not offer any energy savings for multimedia streams over 56 kbps. We also develop history-based client-side strategies to reduce the energy consumed by transitioning the WNICs to a lower power consuming sleep state. We show that streams optimized for 28. 8 kbps can save over 80 % in energy consumption with 2 % data loss. A high 2 Surendar Chandra bandwidth stream (768 kbps) can still save 57 % in energy consumption with less than 0. 3 % data loss. We also show that Real and Quicktime packets are harder to predict at the network level without understanding the packet semantics.

40|$|Virtualization can be {{accomplished}} at different layers in the computational stack and with different goals (servers, desktops, applications, storage and network). This research focuses on server-based desktop virtualization. According to the Gartner group, the main business drivers for adopting desktop virtualization are: application compatibility, business continuity, security and compliance, mobility and improved productivity [15]. Despite these business drivers, desktop virtualization has not been widely adopted. According to a survey conducted by Matrix 42, only 5 % of desktop computers are virtualized [37]. The research deals with the challenges preventing the wider adoption of server-based desktop virtualization while focusing {{on two of the}} main virtualization architectures: session-based desktop virtualization (SBDV) and virtual desktop infrastructure (VDI). The first chapter introduces some of the challenges faced by large organizations in their efforts to create a cost effective and manageable desktop computing environment. The second chapter discusses two of the main server-based desktop virtualizations (VDI and SBDV), illustrating some of the advantages and disadvantages in these different architectures. The third chapter focuses on some of the technical challenges and provides recommendations regarding server-based desktop virtualization. In the fourth chapter, measurements are conducted for the utilization and performance of SBDV on different 3 user profiles (light, heavy and multimedia). Data and results collected from desktop assessment and lab are used to formulate baselines and metrics for capacity planning. According to the conducted measurements, it is concluded that light and heavy profiles can be virtualized using SBDV, while for <b>multimedia</b> profiles, additional <b>capacity</b> planning and resource allocation are required. Multimedia profiles can be virtualized with VDI considering client-side rendering to avoid network bandwidth congestion. While the research focuses on VDI and SBDV, it highlights few points related to client access devices (CADs). CADs are one of the main components in the desktop virtualization stack (OS virtualization, session virtualization, application virtualization, connection broker, CADs and user data and profiles). The latter chapter of the research focuses on conclusions and future work toward greater levels of adoption of VDI and SBDV...|$|R

International audienceA digital museum {{designer}} implements {{the virtual}} exhibitions using digital images, web pages, animation, video clips, and other multimedia gadgets. Although {{there is no}} space and related limitations in the cyber world, {{there are other factors}} that a digital designer needs to consider. For instance, the bandwidth that is available to different users can vary tremendously. Attention span is another factor. While an adult may be willing to go through long explanations in text, a child may prefer graphic-intensive slideshows. Furthermore, the sophistication of users should also be considered. An expert and a novice apparently will expect different experiences when browsing through a digital museum. With the flexibility allowed to the digital form of media presentation, a digital museum should try to accommodate as many different user needs as possible. And a user, when browsing through an exhibition, can simply click and choose the style most suitable. While most people might agree that such a multi-style exhibition scheme for different users is desirable, there are not so many such exhibitions on the Web today. The reason is that using current techniques, each style of the same exhibition needs to be constructed separately. For online exhibitions involving video, animation, or SMIL -based shows, the realization of an exhibition scenario usually requires tedious multimedia composing, and is thereby very time-consuming. It is also quite cumbersome to modify the information content afterwards. If an online exhibition uses mainly HTML-based web pages, the resulting pages are relatively easy to compose, but they are also tight up with the visual art design and are thereby difficult to be modified by the content-provider alone. Furthermore, once the information content grows to a significant amount, the ? hyperlinks? Between associated exhibitions web pages are difficult to track and maintain. The second problem with the handcrafted online exhibition approach is that the content can only be presented to the user in a fixed presentation style. Since the Web users may have different <b>multimedia</b> and bandwidth <b>capacities,</b> it is difficult to design a one-size-fit-all exhibition. In the literature, while large and coordinated efforts have focused on standardizing media formats, providing shared access to museum databases, and developing search mechanisms for data retrieval, little emphasis is placed on designing mechanisms for turning the digitised museum collection into educational experiences for users. Our goal is to design an optimal solution for building online digital museum exhibitions...|$|R
