5|$|Einstein and De Haas {{demonstrated}} that <b>magnetization</b> {{is due to}} the motion of electrons, nowadays known to be the spin. In order to show this, they reversed the <b>magnetization</b> in an iron bar suspended on a torsion pendulum. They confirmed that this leads the bar to rotate, because the electron's angular momentum changes as the <b>magnetization</b> changes. This experiment needed to be sensitive, because the angular momentum associated with electrons is small, but it definitively established that electron motion of some kind is responsible for <b>magnetization.</b>|$|E
5|$|Magnetism as a {{property}} of matter {{has been known}} in China since 4000 BC. However, the first modern studies of magnetism only started {{with the development of}} electrodynamics by Faraday, Maxwell and others in the nineteenth century, which included classifying materials as ferromagnetic, paramagnetic and diamagnetic based on their response to <b>magnetization.</b> Pierre Curie studied the dependence of <b>magnetization</b> on temperature and discovered the Curie point phase transition in ferromagnetic materials. In 1906, Pierre Weiss introduced the concept of magnetic domains to explain the main properties of ferromagnets. The first attempt at a microscopic description of magnetism was by Wilhelm Lenz and Ernst Ising through the Ising model that described magnetic materials as consisting of a periodic lattice of spins that collectively acquired <b>magnetization.</b> The Ising model was solved exactly to show that spontaneous <b>magnetization</b> cannot occur in one dimension but is possible in higher-dimensional lattices. Further research such as by Bloch on spin waves and Néel on antiferromagnetism led to developing new magnetic materials with applications to magnetic storage devices.|$|E
5|$|The Moon has an {{external}} magnetic field of about 1–100 nanoteslas, less than one-hundredth that of Earth. It does not currently have a global dipolar magnetic field and only has crustal <b>magnetization,</b> probably acquired early in lunar history when a dynamo was still operating. Alternatively, some of the remnant <b>magnetization</b> may be from transient magnetic fields generated during large impact events through the expansion of an impact-generated plasma cloud {{in the presence of}} an ambient magnetic field. This is supported by the apparent location of the largest crustal magnetizations near the antipodes of the giant impact basins.|$|E
40|$|We {{document}} {{three cases}} of observed Quaternary or much older secondary <b>magnetizations</b> in red beds. A better than usual knowledge about {{past and present}} temperature conditions enables us to compare these secondary <b>magnetizations</b> with theoretical relationships between relaxation time and the temperature of acquisition of viscous partial thermo remanent <b>magnetizations</b> (VpTRM's). Arguments {{can be made for}} a viscous-thermal origin of the secondary <b>magnetizations</b> in two of the red bed collections, involving Beltian argillites from Montana and Late Precambrian red beds from the Michigan basin. In the third cases, involving Upper Keweenawan sediments from the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, a chemical origin must be assigned to the secondary <b>magnetizations,</b> because thermal and viscous cuases can be ruled out. Stability, blocking-temperature ranges, and discreteness of secondary and characteristics <b>magnetizations</b> are very similar for all three of the red bed collections, so that apparently no magnetic criteria exist to distinguish between partial remagnetizations of thermal or chemical origin in red beds. However, when thermal causes can be documented the theory of VpTRM acquisition offers possibilities for palaeo-heat-flow determinations...|$|R

In the asynchronously updated model, the TAP equations determine the time derivatives of the <b>magnetizations</b> at each time, again via self consistent equations, given the current values of the <b>magnetizations.</b> Numerical simulations suggest that the TAP equations become exact for large systems.

40|$|We {{study the}} Josephson current through a {{ferromagnetic}} trilayer, {{both in the}} diffusive and clean limits.

50|$|The {{direction}} of the two <b>magnetizations</b> of the ferromagnetic films can be switched individually by an external magnetic field. If the <b>magnetizations</b> are in a parallel orientation {{it is more likely}} that electrons will tunnel through the insulating film than if they are in the oppositional (antiparallel) orientation.

50|$|Compared {{with that}} of Earth, the Moon has only a very weak {{external}} magnetic field.

We obtained a magnet of Dy (30 mol%) glass with optically transparent and adhesive to conventional magnet at the room temperature.

25|$|A {{familiar}} {{example of}} SSB is in ferromagnetic materials. Microscopically, the material consists of atoms with a non-vanishing spin, {{each of which}} acts like a tiny bar magnet, i.e., a magnetic dipole. The Hamiltonian of the material, describing the interaction of neighbouring dipoles, is invariant under rotations. At high temperature, there is no <b>magnetization</b> of a large sample of the material. Then one says that the symmetry of the Hamiltonian is realized by the system. However, at low temperature, there could be an overall <b>magnetization.</b> This <b>magnetization</b> has a preferred direction, since one can tell the north magnetic pole of the sample from the south magnetic pole. In this case, there is spontaneous symmetry breaking of the rotational symmetry of the Hamiltonian.|$|E
40|$|Voltage {{controlled}} {{magnetic anisotropy}} (VCMA) {{is a novel}} method to switch <b>magnetizations</b> in low-power and ultra-fast applications based on magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs).

We quantify VCMA in CoFeB/MgO/CoFeB MTJ nanopillars with in-plane <b>magnetizations</b> where our FMR method is unique in providing direct information about VCMA. We observe a quadratic shift of the FMR resonance field when a voltage bias is applied across the MTJ. The VCMA energy corresponding to the quadratic shift varies with an energy factor of 8. 2 μJ/m 2 for 1 V 2 /nm 2. These results are important for understanding magnetodynamics in MTJ-based applications with in-plane <b>magnetizations...</b>|$|R

25|$|Unlike ferromagnets, paramagnets do not retain any <b>magnetization</b> in {{the absence}} of an {{externally}} applied magnetic field because thermal motion randomizes the spin orientations. (Some paramagnetic materials retain spin disorder even at absolute zero, meaning they are paramagnetic in the ground state, i.e. {{in the absence}} of thermal motion.) Thus the total <b>magnetization</b> drops to zero when the applied field is removed. Even in the presence of the field there is only a small induced <b>magnetization</b> because only a small fraction of the spins will be oriented by the field. This fraction is proportional to the field strength and this explains the linear dependency. The attraction experienced by ferromagnetic materials is non-linear and much stronger, so that it is easily observed, for instance, in the attraction between a refrigerator magnet and the iron of the refrigerator itself.|$|E

40|$|In {{the past}} year, several groups have {{observed}} evidence for long-range spin-triplet supercurrent in Josephson junctions containing ferromagnetic (F) materials. In our work, the spin-triplet pair correlations {{are created by}} non-collinear <b>magnetizations</b> between a central Co/Ru/Co "synthetic antiferromagnet" (SAF) and two outer thin F layers. Here we present data showing that the spin-triplet supercurrent is enhanced up to 20 times after our samples are subject to a large in-plane magnetizing field. This surprising result can be explained if the Co/Ru/Co SAF undergoes a "spin-flop" transition, whereby the two Co layer <b>magnetizations</b> end up perpendicular to the <b>magnetizations</b> of the two thin F layers. Direct experimental evidence for the spin-flop transition comes from scanning electron microscopy with polarization analysis and from spin-polarized neutron reflectometry.
