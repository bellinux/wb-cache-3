In July 1919 he was appointed Verbindungsmann (intelligence agent) of an Aufklärungskommando (reconnaissance unit) of the Reichswehr, assigned to influence other soldiers and to infiltrate the German Workers' Party (DAP). At a DAP meeting on 12 September 1919, Party Chairman Anton Drexler was impressed with Hitler's oratorical skills. He gave him {{a copy of his}} pamphlet <b>My</b> <b>Political</b> Awakening, which contained anti-Semitic, nationalist, anti-capitalist, and anti-Marxist ideas. On the orders of his army superiors, Hitler applied to join the party, and within a week was accepted as party member 555 (the party began counting membership at 500 to give the impression they were a much larger party).|$|E

As eldest {{brother of the}} king, Louis Stanislas received the title Monsieur. Louis Stanislas longed for political influence. He attempted to gain admittance to the king's council in 1774, but failed. Louis Stanislas was left in a political limbo that he called [...] "a gap of 12 years in <b>my</b> <b>political</b> life". Louis XVI granted Louis Stanislas revenues from the Duchy of Alençon in December 1774. The duchy was given to enhance Louis Stanislas' prestige, however, the appanage generated only 300,000 livres per annum, an amount much lower {{than it had been}} at its peak in the fourteenth century.|$|E

Clinton registered for the draft and received a high number (311), meaning that those whose birthdays had been drawn as numbers 1 to 310 would have to be drafted before him, making it unlikely that he would be drafted.

Brannon Braga said that Roddenberry made it known to the writers of Star Trek and Star Trek: The Next Generation that religion, superstition, and mystical thinking {{were not to be}} included. Even a mention of marriage in a script for an early episode of The Next Generation resulted in Roddenberry's chastising the writers. Nicholas Meyer said that Star Trek had evolved [...] "into sort of a secular parallel to the Catholic Mass". Roddenberry compared the franchise to his own philosophy by saying: [...] "Understand that Star Trek is more than just <b>my</b> <b>political</b> philosophy, my racial philosophy, my overview on life and the human condition."

500|$|Nixon {{celebrated the}} anniversary of the speech each year. The future {{president}} disliked the fact that the address soon became popularly known as the [...] "Checkers speech." [...] In his 1962 book, Six Crises (the Fund crisis being one of the six), he would object to the term, [...] "as though the mention of my dog {{was the only thing that}} saved <b>my</b> <b>political</b> career." [...] Nixon preferred to call the address [...] "the Fund speech," [...] and made it required reading for his speechwriters. As time passed, the Checkers speech became denigrated, and Nixon biographer Earl Mazo suggested that much of the attitude of [...] "I don't like Nixon, but I don't know why," [...] which contributed to the failure of his 1960 presidential run, can be traced to the Checkers speech. Other commentators suggested that had he not made the Checkers speech, Nixon might have won in 1960. Nixon retorted that without the Checkers speech, he would not have been around to run in 1960.|$|E

Senator Thomas Hart Benton of Missouri had introduced a bill expunging the censure of Jackson. By resolution of the Democratic-controlled legislature, Tyler could be instructed to vote for the bill. If he disregarded the instructions, he would be violating his own principles: [...] "the first act of <b>my</b> <b>political</b> life was a censure on Messrs.

García Márquez's political and ideological views were shaped by his grandfather's stories. In an interview, García Márquez told his friend Plinio Apuleyo Mendoza, [...] "my grandfather the Colonel was a Liberal. <b>My</b> <b>political</b> ideas probably came from him to begin with because, instead of telling me fairy tales when I was young, he would regale me with horrifying accounts of the last civil war that free-thinkers and anti-clerics waged against the Conservative government." [...] This influenced his political views and his literary technique so that [...] "in the same way that his writing career initially took shape in conscious opposition to the Colombian literary status quo, García Márquez's socialist and anti-imperialist views are in principled opposition to the global status quo dominated by the United States." ...|$|E
500|$|Livingstone {{intended}} to stand again as Labour {{candidate in the}} London Mayoral election, 2008, this time against Conservative candidate Boris Johnson. At {{the start of the}} campaign Livingstone took Johnson more seriously than many others were doing, referring to him as [...] "the most formidable opponent I will face in <b>my</b> <b>political</b> career." [...] Much of Labour's campaign revolved around criticising Johnson for perceived racist and homophobic comments that he had made in the past, although Johnson strenuously denied that he was bigoted. Livingstone also proposed that if he were to win a third term he would increase the congestion charge fee to £25 for the most polluting vehicles, while removing it for the least, and that he would also introduce a cycling scheme based on the Vélib' system in Paris. As part of his campaign, Livingstone highlighted that by 2008, the Metropolitan Police had 35,000 officers, 10,000 more than it had had in 2000, also highlighting statistics to indicate falling crime rates across the city during his Mayorship. Nevertheless, there had been a recent rise in gang killing among young people, with 27 teenagers having been killed in gang warfare during 2007, a statistic used by Johnson's campaign who emphasised the idea that a Johnson administration would be far tougher on youth crime and anti-social behaviour.|$|E
