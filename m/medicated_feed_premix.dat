The recommended dose of Aquaflor to control ESC is 10 mg/kg body weight (BW) /day for 10 days. The study objective {{was to determine the}} safety of Aquaflor administered in feed to channel catfish at doses of 0 (control), 10, 30, and 50 mg/kg BW/day for 20 consecutive days. Parameters evaluated included daily mortality, behavioral (appetite, distribution, flight/fright response), and water chemistry observations, initial and terminal weight measurements, and gross and microscopic pathology. <b>Medicated</b> <b>feed</b> consumption was 67 – 86 % of target with group mean doses of 8. 5 mg/kg BW/day, 24. 6 mg/kg BW/day, and 34. 9 mg/kg BW/day. There were no mortalities or clinically observable changes noted at any of the dose levels tested. Aquaflor-related changes were limited to the food consumption and histopathology data. Although Aquaflor-related decreased feed consumption was noted in the 30 and 50 mg/kg BW/day groups, there were no differences in fish growth among the treatment groups. Aquaflor-related histopathology findings were limited to a histomorphologically evident dose-dependent decrease in hematopoietic/lymphopoietic tissue in the anterior kidneys, posterior kidneys, and spleens of channel catfish.

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to enhance the {{bioavailability}} of erythromycin base when administered orally in rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss). Since erythromicin is normally given {{in the form of}} <b>medicated</b> <b>feed,</b> in this study 3 new types of feed formulation were developed. A self-emulsifying system and two types of double microemulsions (O/W/O) were prepared, characterised and adsorbed on a commercial extruded diet for fish. The emulsified systems were based on saturated polyglycolized glycerides and mono- and diglycerides of medium chain fatty acids (as oily phase), Tweenr 80 (as surfactant) and, in the case of double microemulsions, distilled water. The systems differed in percentage composition and for the amount and position of erythromycin in different phases. The three <b>medicated</b> <b>feed</b> were then administered orally by means of a gastric probe to rainbow trout and their relative bioavailability was estimated in comparison to that obtained after oral administration of feed with erythromycin powder. For each <b>medicated</b> <b>feed,</b> 80 fish were tested. Finally, plasma profiles of erythromycin after single administration of <b>medicated</b> <b>feeds</b> were used to predict profiles obtainable by administering once daily <b>medicated</b> <b>feeds</b> for 7 consecutive days.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to develop a {{self-emulsifying}} system (SES) with practical applications in fish farming. In particular, the lipid vehicle was developed in order to deliver oxytetracycline hydrocloride to rainbow trout (RT) and European sea bass (ESB) so as to improve the drug’ s oral bioavailability. The developed formulation was assessed in comparison to an aqueous solution working with two fish species (one fresh-water and one salt-water), after oral administration with a gastric probe. Results indicated an enhancement of bioavailability of 5. 86 and 5. 41 times over the aqueous solution, in RT and ESB, respectively. SES was then used to prepare <b>medicated</b> <b>feed</b> containing the formulation. The pharmacokinetic of this feed was evaluated after oral administration and compared to that of commercial OTC <b>medicated</b> <b>feed.</b> The bioavailability of OTC delivered in SES was 3. 2 times higher in RT and 2. 7 times higher in ESB, than OTC supplied by commercial <b>medicated</b> <b>feed.</b> This bioavailability enhancement was confirmed when RT were fed by classical administration in fish tanks of single and repeated administration of OTC delivered in SES and commercial <b>medicated</b> <b>feed,</b> attesting to better absorption of the SES formulation...|$|R

40|$|The {{cross-contamination}} of non-medicated feed with residues of antimicrobials causes {{an animal}} {{and public health}} concern associated {{with the potential for}} the selection and dissemination of resistance in commensal bacteria and potentially zoonotic bacteria. To identify the extent of this situation, we built a risk model that provides a way to estimate the percentage of cross-contaminated feed in total and at the different levels at which cross-contamination may occur (i. e. the feed mill, the transport truck, the farm), for different levels of antimicrobial <b>medicated</b> <b>feed</b> produced in a country per year. The model, estimated that when antimicrobial <b>medicated</b> <b>feed</b> represents a hypothetical x(i) = 2 % of the total feed produced in a country per year, then 5. 5 % (95 % CI = 3. 4 %; 11. 4 %) of the total feed produced in a year could be cross-contaminated with different levels of antimicrobials due to practices related to <b>medicated</b> <b>feed.</b> In detail, 1. 80 % (95 % CI = 0. 2 %; 7. 7 %) of the total feed produced in such a country would be cross-contaminated due to antimicrobial carryover occurring at the feed mill level, 1. 83 % (95 % CI = 1. 3 %; 2. 0 %) at the transport truck level and 1. 84 % (95 % CI = 1. 2 %; 2. 0 %) at the farm level. The model also demonstrated that even in cases where antimicrobial <b>medicated</b> <b>feed</b> would be produced in end-of-line mixers or a fine dosing system on trucks, the risk of cross-contamination would not be negligible; the percentage of cross-contaminated feed produced in a country (where x(i) = 2 %) per year would be 3. 7 % (95 % CI = 2. 9 %; 4. 0 %) and 2. 4 % (95 % CI = 1. 6 %; 2. 7 %), respectively.

40|$|Ba c k g r o u n d: Industrial food animal {{production}} employs {{many of the}} same antibiotics or classes of antibiotics that are used in human medicine. These drugs can be administered to food animals in the form of free-choice <b>medicated</b> <b>feeds</b> (FCMF), where animals choose how much feed to consume. Routine administration of these drugs to livestock selects for microorganisms that are resistant to medications critical to the treatment of clinical infections in humans. Objectives: In this commentary, we discuss the history of <b>medicated</b> <b>feeds,</b> the nature of FCMF use with regard to dose delivery, and U. S. policies that address antimicrobial drug use in food animals. Discussion: FCMF makes delivering a predictable, accurate, and intended dose difficult. Overdosing can lead to animal toxicity; underdosing or inconsistent dosing can result in a failure to resolve animal diseases and in the development of antimicrobial-resistant microorganisms.

40|$|A {{ranking system}} for {{veterinary}} medicinal products and <b>medicated</b> <b>feed</b> additives has been developed {{as a tool to}} be applied in a risk-based approach to the residue testing programme for foods of animal origin in the National Residue Control Plan. In the context of food sampling and residue testing for the National Residue Control Plan, there is firstly, the risk to human health from residues of chemical substances in food and secondly, the issue of non-compliance with regulations relating to residues in food due to improper farm practices; both these elements are included in the developed risk-ranking of substances. Three characteristics of substances that may occur as residues in food are included in the developed risk-ranking system: ‘Potency’, as measured by the acceptable daily intake value assigned to each substance; ‘Usage’, as measured by the three factors of number of doses, use on individual animals or for group treatment, and withdrawal period; ‘Residue Occurrence’, as measured by non-compliant samples in the National Residue Control Plan. The risk-ranking system for substances has been developed using a scoring system applied to the various parameters to give an overall score. It is a relatively simple system, designed to provide a basis for selecting the {{veterinary medicinal products}} and <b>medicated</b> <b>feed</b> additives that might be prioritised for residue testing. However, a number of limitations are associated with the system and this risk-ranking of substances represents only one component of a total risk-based approach to designing the residue testing programme. Other factors which should be taken into account include issues such as evidence of misuse of veterinary medicinal products and <b>medicated</b> <b>feed</b> additives and changes to maximum residue limits in the specifications for particular veterinary medicinal products and <b>medicated</b> <b>feed</b> additives.

40|$|Master of ScienceDepartment of Grain Science and IndustryLeland McKinneyCarryover of <b>medicated</b> <b>feed</b> {{additives}} between {{batches of}} feed can potentially result in harmful drug residues in the edible tissues of food-animals. Flushing the equipment with an ingredient, such as ground grain, is one method used {{to remove any}} residual <b>medicated</b> <b>feed</b> from the system. It is generally recommended that the quantity of flush used be between 5 and 10 % of the mixer's capacity. However, there is little data that supports this recommendation. Therefore, two experiments were conducted to 1.) determine which manufacturing equipment is {{the major source of}} carryover, 2.) evaluate which flush size adequately prevents drug carryover, and 3.) quantify the interrelationship between flush size and drug concentration. In Experiment 1, <b>feed</b> <b>medicated</b> with nicarbazin (Nicarb 25 %®; 0. 0125 %) was manufactured and conveyed from the mixer, through a drag conveyor and bucket elevator, and then into a finished product bin. The system was then flushed using ground corn in the amount of 2. 5, 5, 10, 15, or 20 % of the mixer's capacity (454. 5 kg). Subsequently, a non-medicated diet was conveyed through the system and samples were collected and analyzed for nicarbazin. No significant (P > 0. 05) differences were detected among the flush treatments, and all treatments were effective in preventing nicarbazin carryover to the non-medicated diet. In Experiment 2, <b>feed</b> <b>medicated</b> with three levels of monensin (Rumensin® 80; 100, 600, and 1, 200 g/ton) was manufactured and handled {{in the same manner as}} in Experiment 1.

There was significant interaction (P < 0. 05) between drug level and sampling location between treatments. As the drug level in the medicated diet increased, higher concentrations of monensin were detected in the non-medicated diet. Collectively, these studies demonstrate that a 2. 5 %, even a 1 % flush size, is effective in preventing carryover of <b>medicated</b> <b>feed</b> additives.

40|$|Different {{compound}} feeds {{have to be}} manufactured in the same production line. As a consequence, traces of the first produced feed may remain in the production and get mixed with the next feed batches. This "carry-over" is unavoidable, and so non-medicated feed can be contaminated with veterinary drugs like antibiotics added to the previous batch of <b>medicated</b> <b>feed.</b> To monitor the carry-over of antibiotics in the Netherlands, 21 feed mills were visited and 140 samples of flushing feeds were collected and analysed for containing residues of antibiotics. Results show that 87 % of all samples contain concentrations of antibiotics {{in the range of}} 0. 1 - 154 mg/kg. It is expected that these levels - which are in the same range as previously found for the nowadays banned antimicrobial growth promoters (AMGPs) - {{have an effect on the}} occurrence of microbial resistance. Analysis of a second set of samples collected at four different feed mills directly after the production of oxytetracycline-medicated feed demonstrated that the first part of a flushing feed has much higher contamination than the last part of the batch. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that the carry-over percentage shows no correlation with the carry-over determined by one of the standard GMP+ procedures.

40|$|AbstractWhen {{oxytetracycline}} (OTC) <b>medicated</b> <b>feed</b> is fed to {{fish in a}} recirculating aquaculture system, antibiotic residues could {{accumulate in}} fish tissue, water, biofilter sand and sediment {{to a greater extent}} than in single pass or serial reuse aquaculture systems. In two trials, oxytetracycline-medicated feed (3 g active ingredient per pound of feed) was fed to adult rainbow trout at 1 % b. w. per day for 10 days. OTC residues were assayed in fish muscle (with skin attached), water, sediment (e. g., fish feces, uneaten feed) and biofilter sand. For both trials, oxytetracycline was detected during the 10 days of treatment in all matrices assayed. In trout muscle, OTC concentrations increased to an average of 1. 8 μg/g by day 10 of treatment and then declined to < 0. 2 μg/g by 21 days post-treatment. For water entering and exiting the biofilter, OTC concentrations increased to 0. 5 μg/ml by day 10 and was not detectable (< 0. 001 μg/ml) by 21 days post-treatment. For biofilter sand, OTC concentration was approximately 14 μg/g by day 10 and decreased to < 2 μg/g by 21 days post-treatment. In sediment samples, OTC concentrations increased to 1900 μg/g by day 10 and declined to < 2 μg/g by 21 days post-treatment. In this system, OTC concentrations in trout muscle were well below 2 μg/g by 21 days after withdrawal of the drug. After input of <b>medicated</b> <b>feed</b> to the system was stopped, OTC concentrations in water, sediment and the biofilter declined and did not increase during the post-treatment period...|$|R
40|$|A labour- and time-effective {{analytical}} procedure for determination of ivermectin in <b>medicated</b> <b>feed</b> at recommended level of 2. 0 [*]mg[*]kg− 1 {{has been developed}} and validated. The analyte was extracted from grinded feed samples with acetonitrile and derivatisated with N-methylimidazole and trifluoracetic anhydride. The fluorescent derivatives were analysed by liquid chromatography method using C 8 column. The isocratic conditions using acetonitrile, methanol, water, and tetrahydrofuran were applied. Fluorescence detection was performed at 365 [*]nm (excitation) and 475 [*]nm (emission) wavelengths. The total analysis time was 10 [*]min. The validation results of the method (within-laboratory reproducibility 4. 0 % CV, mean recovery 100. 1 %) confirm the appropriate precision and accuracy of the developed method...|$|R
40|$|Antimicrobial use was {{measured}} for 17 months on dairy farms {{that participated in}} the Canadian Bovine Mastitis Research Network in Alberta. In total, 1490 cows were present on 13 farms. Forty different products were found that contained 19 different ingredients. In total, 14. 5 grams of active ingredient was used per cow per year and 65. 1 % was administered by injection and 25. 1 % was used for intra uterine infusion. The remaining part was infused intramammarily, used as <b>medicated</b> <b>feed,</b> or applied orally. The most frequently used active ingredient were Trimetroprim Sulfonamid (30 %), tetracyclines and oxytetracyclines (38 %). Penicillins contributed 11 % to the total amount.

40|$|High-performance liquid {{chromatography}} {{was used to}} quantify residues of oxolinic acid and flumequine in muscle of wild fish caught {{in the vicinity of}} fish farms using the LiftUp feed collector system or a hydroacoustic feed detector during medication. Both systems are designed to minimise feed waste and thereby the amount of <b>medicated</b> <b>feed</b> entering the surroundings. The result indicates that both systems decrease the supply of medicated pellets to the wild fish during medication, since the mean and maximum concentrations of drugs in muscle of wild fish were reduced compared to fish farms not using this equipment. Therefore, the equipment will reduce the environmental impact of antibacterial agents used in fish farming...|$|R
40|$|Commercial feed rations {{containing}} sulfamethazine at {{the level}} of 110 ppm were fed for a period of 65 days to market pigs in a study simulating normal farm practices. The levels of sulfamethazine at the end of medication were in excess of 10 ppm in liver and kidney and up to 2. 6 ppm in muscle tissues. Concentrations of sulfamethazine in tissues from pigs after withdrawal of <b>medicated</b> <b>feed</b> depleted to 0. 1 ppm within nine days. The rate of depletion was similar for all tissues. It was observed that storage of tissue samples at freezer temperature (- 20 degrees C) for 30 days further reduces sulfamethazine levels by 3 to 20 % of their original value...|$|R
40|$|A {{confirmatory method}} has been {{developed}} {{to allow for the}} analysis of fourteen prohibited medicinal additives in pig and poultry compound feed. These compounds are prohibited for use as feed additives although some are still authorised for use in <b>medicated</b> <b>feed.</b> Feed samples are extracted by acetonitrile with addition of sodium sulphate. The extracts undergo a hexane wash to aid with sample purification. The extracts are then evaporated to dryness and reconstituted in initial mobile phase. The samples undergo an ultracentrifugation step prior to injection onto the LC-MS/MS system and are analysed in a run time of 26 minutes. The LC-MS/MS system is run in MRM mode with both positive and negative electrospray ionisation. The method was validated over three days and is capable of quantitatively analysing for metronidazole, dimetridazole, ronidazole, ipronidazole, chloramphenicol, sulfadiazine, sulfamethazine, dinitolimide, ethopabate, carbadox and clopidol. The method is also capable of qualitatively analysing for tylosin, virginiamycin and avilamycin. A level of 100 μg kg- 1 was used for validation purposes and the method is capable of analysing to this level for all the compounds. Validation criteria of trueness, precision, repeatability and reproducibility along with measurement uncertainty are calculated for all analytes...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the outcome of}} two proficiency tests (IMEP- 114 / 36) running in parallel, which focused on the determination of total As, Cd, Pb, Hg and Sn in <b>feed</b> <b>premixes.</b> Both exercises aimed to test the performance of laboratories measuring trace elements in feed, in compliance with Directive 2002 / 32 /EC of the European Parliament and of the Council on undesirable substances in animal feed. IMEP- 114 was run for the European Union National Reference Laboratories, while IMEP- 36 was open to all food control laboratories that wished to participate. In total 80 laboratories from 37 countries registered to both proficiency tests, from which 75 laboratories reported results. The test material used in this exercise was commercially available <b>feed</b> <b>premix,</b> which was processed, bottled, labelled and dispatched to participants. The performance of the participating laboratories was similar in both proficiency tests and was very good {{in the case of}} total Cd and less satisfactory for total As and total Pb. For total Sn only one-third of the participants reported results, from which 33 % performed satisfactorily. Thirty-four participants reported results for total Hg, although the expert laboratories stated that the mass fraction for that measurand was below the limit of detection of the method used. An evaluation of the reasons that could be at the basis of unsatisfactory results has been carried out and is presented here. JRC. D. 5 -Standards for Food Bioscienc...|$|R

40|$|Specific {{problems}} are posed by medicated premixes : {{stability of the}} active ingredient, homogeneity of the medicated premix distribution in the feed and cross-contammation due to dust emission These problems can have two major consequences· a treatment failure and a risk for human health with selection of res 1 stant strains CEVA Matrix Technology, an exclusive CEVA Sante Ammale manufacturing process, matches all expectations of an effective and modern medicated premix. CEVA Matrix Technology consists of an innovative protective granulation technology. Most non-protected medicated premixes available in the market do not provide good stability and may not reach efficient concentration as the active ingredient is not protected enough. First, the CEVA Matrix Technology guarantees that the active ingredient is protected during manufacture (pelleting) and storage of the <b>medicated</b> <b>feed</b> without altenng its bioavailability. Secondly, the particle size of CEVA Matrix Technology premixes {{is similar to the}} feed in which it is to be blended. Therefore the active ingredient is mixed homogeneously into the feed and remains homogeneous even after transportation and storage. This perfect mixability ensures the right active ingredient concentration and dosage in feed every time. Consequently, treatment failure resulting from unequal dosage distribution of the active ingredient in the feed is considerably limited. Thirdly, CEVA Matrix Technology guarantees that the premix does not release dust. Therefore, it reduces risks such as cross contamination between two <b>medicated</b> <b>feed</b> batches in mills and inhalation of antimicrobial by users. It protects the workforce and reduces the risk of selecting resistant strams. This article validates all these points by comparing a tiamulin medicated premix manufactured with the CEVA Matrix Technology and some non-protected tiamulin...|$|R
40|$|Depletion of the {{nitrofuran}} antibiotics furazolidone, furaltadone, nitrofurantoin and nitrofurazone {{and their}} tissue-bound metabolites AOZ, AMOZ, AHD and SEM from pig muscle, {{liver and kidney}} tissues is described. Groups of pigs were given <b>feed</b> <b>medicated</b> {{with one of the}} nitrofuran drugs at a therapeutic concentration (400 ?mg?kg - 1) for ten days. Animals were slaughtered at intervals and tissue samples collected for analysis for six weeks following withdrawal of <b>medicated</b> <b>feed.</b> These samples were analysed both for parent nitrofurans (using LC-MS/MS and HPLC-UV), and for tissue-bound metabolites (using LC-MS/MS). The parent drugs were detectable only sporadically and only in pigs subjected to no withdrawal period whatsoever. This confirms the instability of the four major nitrofuran antibiotics in edible tissues. In contrast, the metabolites accumulated to high concentrations in tissues (ppm levels) and had depletion half lives of between 5. 5 and 15. 5 days. The metabolites of all four drugs were still readily detectable in tissues six weeks after cessation of treatment. This emphasizes the benefits of monitoring for the stable metabolites of the nitrofuran...|$|R
