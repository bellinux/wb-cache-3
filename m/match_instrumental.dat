The emphasis is laid on selection problems (how to disentangle the real effect of a policy from the personal features of the affected people), and on the practical issues of a policy evaluation (access to relevant data, identification hypotheses, interpretation of the results) illustrated by examples provided by recent empirical articles.

40|$|Employers and {{job seekers}} rely {{extensively}} on job informational networks to fill vacancies or {{to find a}} job. The widespread use of job contacts to find work has been largely associated with labor outcomes, such as finding a job or even affecting wages. Some scholars have claimed that informal referrals play a determinant role in reducing informational mismatches between potential employers and job seekers. Although several {{studies have shown that}} the use of friends and relatives is correlated with labor outcomes, little is known about the causal effect. In this article, I aim to identify whether there is a causal effect of using informal referrals on two main outcomes: the probability of being employed and hourly wages. I use a large data set from Colombia, the Living Standard Survey 2003, to contrast the results from three main methodologies: standard OLS estimation, propensity-score <b>matching,</b> and <b>instrumental</b> variables. Results suggest that much of the positive effect of using informal referrals on employment reflects the prevalence of informal-sector jobs to be filled through this method rather than a causal effect. On the contrary, the results for hourly wages suggest a negative causal effect of using job informational networks, which is explained by the low-quality/poor matches theory. Yet, this is only true in formal-sector firms. informal referrals, job search methods, employment rates, hourly wages, selec- tion bias, OLS, Propensity-Score <b>Matching,</b> <b>Instrumental</b> Variables, Roy Model...|$|R
40|$|The {{possibility}} that actors strategically condition their behavior on partially unobservable factors poses a grave challenge to causal inference, particularly if {{only some of}} the actors whose behavior we analyze are at risk of experiencing the outcome of interest. We present a crisis bargaining model that indicates that targets can generally prevent war by arming. We then create a simulated data set where the model is assumed to perfectly describe interactions for those states engaged in crisis bargaining, which we assume most pairs of states are not. We further assume researchers cannot observe which states are engaged in crisis bargaining, although observable variables might serve as proxies. We demonstrate that a naïve design would falsely (and unsurprisingly) indicate a positive relationship between arming and war. More importantly, we then evaluate the performance of <b>matching,</b> <b>instrumental</b> variables, and statistical backwards induction.

40|$|We {{find that}} {{repeated}} borrowing {{from the same}} lender translates into a 10 [...] 17 bps lowering of loan spreads and that relationships are especially valuable when borrower transparency is low. These results hold using multiple approaches (propensity score <b>matching,</b> <b>instrumental</b> variables, and treatment effects model) that control for the endogeneity of relationships. We also provide a demarcation line between relationship and transactional lending. Spreads charged for relationship loans and nonrelationship loans are statistically identical if the borrower is in the largest 30 % by asset size; has public rated debt; or {{is part of the}} S&P 500 index. Past relationships reduce collateral requirements and are also associated with obtaining larger loans. Our results imply that, even for firms that have multiple sources of outside financing, borrowing from a prior lender obtains better loan terms. The Author 2009.

40|$|This chapter {{uses the}} {{marginal}} treatment effect (MTE) to unify and organize the econometric {{literature on the}} evaluation of social programs. The marginal treatment effect is a choice-theoretic parameter that {{can be interpreted as}} a willingness to pay parameter for persons at a margin of indifference between participating in an activity or not. All of the conventional treatment parameters as well as the more economically motivated treatment effects can be generated from a baseline marginal treatment effect. All of the estimation methods used in the applied evaluation literature, such as <b>matching,</b> <b>instrumental</b> variables, regression discontinuity methods, selection and control function methods, make assumptions about the marginal treatment effect which we exposit. Models for multiple outcomes are developed. Empirical examples of the leading methods are presented. Methods are presented for bounding treatment effects in partially identified models, when the marginal treatment effect is known only over a limited support. We show how to use the marginal treatment in econometric cost benefit analysis, in defining limits of policy experiments, in constructing the average marginal treatment effect, and in forecasting the effects of programs in new environments. ...|$|R

40|$|Does {{repeated}} {{borrowing from}} the same lender affect loan contract terms? We find that such borrowing translates into a 10 to 17 bps lowering of loan spreads. These results hold using multiple approaches (Propensity Score <b>Matching,</b> <b>Instrumental</b> Variables, and Treatment Effects Model) that control for the endogeneity of relationships. We find that relationships are especially valuable when borrower transparency is low and the moral hazard among lending syndicate members is high. We also provide a demarcation line between relationship and transactional lending. We find that spreads charged for relationship loans and non-relationship loans become indistinguishable if the borrower is in the top 30 % when ranked by asset size. Similar dissipation of relationship benefits occurs if the borrower has public rated debt or {{is part of the}} S&P 500 index. We find that past relationships reduce collateral requirements. Relationships are also associated with shorter debt maturity especially for the lowest quality borrowers. Our results are robust to an estimation methodology which allows loan spread, collateral requirements, and loan maturity to be determined jointly using an instrumental variables approach. We also find relationship borrowers obtain larger loans (scaled by the borrower’s asset size) compared to non-relationship borrowers. Our results imply that, even for firms that hav...|$|R

M. W. Musson and M. J. Jimenez) {{have been}} proposed for estimating an earthquake location and magnitude from intensity data alone. The locations and magnitudes obtained for a given set of intensity data are almost always different, and no one technique is consistently best at <b>matching</b> <b>instrumental</b> locations and magnitudes of recent well-recorded earthquakes in Italy. Rather than attempting to select {{one of the three}} solutions as best, we use all three techniques to estimate the location and the magnitude and the epistemic uncertainties among them. The estimates are calculated using bootstrap resampled data sets with Monte Carlo sampling of a decision tree. The decision-tree branch weights are based on goodness-of-fit measures of location and magnitude for recent earthquakes. The location estimates are based on the spatial distribution of locations calculated from the bootstrap resampled data. The preferred source location is the locus of the maximum bootstrap location spatial density. The location uncertainty is obtained from contours of the bootstrap spatial density: 68 % of the bootstrap locations are within the 68 % confidence region, and so on. For large earthquakes, our preferred location is not associated with the epicenter but with a location on the extended rupture surface. For small earthquakes, the epicenters are generally consistent with the location uncertainties inferred from the intensity data if an epicenter inaccuracy of 2 – 3 km is allowed. The preferred magnitude is the median of the distribution of bootstrap magnitudes. As with location uncertainties, the uncertainties in magnitude are obtained from the distribution of bootstrap magnitudes: the bounds of the 68 % uncertainty range enclose 68 % of the bootstrap magnitudes, and so on. The instrumental magnitudes for large and small earthquakes are generally consistent with the confidence intervals inferred from the distribution of bootstrap resampled magnitudes...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the evolution}} of the effects on educational inequality of early marriage by looking at the impact of whether women had married young on their children's schooling outcomes for 25 - 32 countries (Demographic and Health Surveys) in 2000 and 2010 for Sub Saharan Africa. We also explore indirect pathways −mother's education, health and empowerment as well as community channels− operating from early marriage to child schooling and assess the presence of negative externalities for non early married mothers and their children on education transmission in communities with large rates of child marriage. In our econometric analysis we employ OLS, <b>matching,</b> <b>instrumental</b> variables and pseudo-panel for a better understanding of changes over time. Our results show that early marriage is still a significant source of inequality, though its impact has decreased across time: girls born to early married mothers are between 6 %- 11 % more likely to never been to school and 1. 6 %- 1. 7 % to enter late, and 3. 3 %- 5. 1 % less likely to complete primary school, whereas boys are between 5. 2 %- 8. 8 % more likely to never been to school and 1 %- 1. 9 % to enter late, and 2. 3 %- 5. 5 % less likely to complete primary school. Second, child marriage increases gender inequality within household’s with girls losing an additional 0. 07 years of schooling as compared to boys if born to early married mothers. Third, our estimates show that mother's education and health mediate some of the effect of early marriage and that the large prevalence of child marriage in a community also impairs educational transmission for non-early married mothers. Fourth, empowering of young wives can weaken other channels of transmission of education inequalities. Overall, our findings highlight the need to target these children with the appropriate interventions and support to achieve the greater focus on equity in the global post- 2015 education agenda...|$|R
