40|$|Acetoin is {{a product}} of {{fermentation}} by C. acetobutylicum, and a component of several natural and artificial flavors, including butter flavor. Acetolactate synthase (ALS) catalyzes the production of acetolactate from pyruvate. Acetolactate is converted to acetoin enzymatically or chemically. A putative catabolic acetolactate synthase was cloned from C. acetobutylicum. The gene is 1692 nucleotides long. His-tagged ALS protein was purified from E. coli. In vivo experiments in E. coli and C. acetobutylicum and in vitro experiments failed to detect activity for the acetolactate synthase, though it probably is involved in Clostridial acetoin production. Introduction of a B. subtilis ALS under control of its own promoter into C. acetobutylicum cells was also found to have no effect on solvent production. Acetoin reductase (AR) catalyzes the production of 2, 3 -butanediol from acetoin. 2, 3 -butanediol is a compound of commercial interest for use in making polyurethane foams, <b>moistening</b> <b>agents,</b> carriers for pharmaceuticals, and liquid fuel, among other products. The K. pneumoniae CG 21 acetoin reductase gene was cloned into a Clostridial/E. coli shuffle vector and expressed in both hosts. The nucleotide sequence of the gene is 768 bp long. SDS-PAGE analysis of expressed protein indicates a molecular weight of 31, 000 Da. Activity of the K. pneumoniae acetoin reductase gene in C. acetobutylicum, did not result in 2, 3 -butanediol synthesis during fermentation, as determined by analysis of culture supernatants. However, addition of racemic acetoin to Clostridial cells expressing the ar, yielded small amounts of 2, 3 -butanediol. The stereoisomer of acetoin produced by C. acetobutylicum may be incompatible with the acetoin reductase or enzyme activity in cells may be too low. A B. subtilis oxidoreductase gene, ywrO, was cloned and analyzed as a putative acetoin reductase. In vitro and in vivo experiments conducted in E. coli suggest it is not an acetoin reductase. E. coli expressing the ar of K. pneumoniae grown in the presence of racemic acetoin make 2, 3 -butanediol.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{synthesize}} a new type of material, superporous hydrogel, and to explore its potential applications. Superporous hydrogels have numerous supersize pores inside them, and the typical pore sizes are several hundred micrometers. These unique structures give them distinctive properties from the traditional non-porous hydrogels and the macroporous hydrogels (pore size of several micrometers). ^ Superporous hydrogels were prepared by a gas blowing method. The crosslinking polymerization occurred when the foam was stabilized so that the pores were permanently captured in the polymer matrix. Various types of superporous hydrogels were synthesized in this study. ^ Superporous hydrogels can be used in various applications. In this study, four applications were explored. The first one was to make fast swelling superabsorbents. In aqueous solution, superporous hydrogels swelled several times larger and hundreds of times faster than the conventional non-porous hydrogels. The key factors for the fast swelling were well connected capillary channels and good polymer surface wettability. Ethanol dehydration, <b>moistening,</b> wetting <b>agent,</b> and superdisintegrants all improved the swelling rate of superporous hydrogels. The second application was to make degradable superporous hydrogels. Sucrose based superporous hydrogels were synthesized and they showed several times faster degradation than the non-porous hydrogels. The third application of superporous hydrogels was in the controlled drug delivery. Gastric retentive superporous hydrogels were synthesized for sustained oral drug delivery. The dosage forms had a small dry size, a large swollen size, a fast swelling time, strong mechanical properties, and were retained in the stomach for up to 4. 5 h in the fasted dog and up to 27 h in a dog that was fed in the first 6 h after the administration of the dosage form but was fasted thereafter. Factors attributed to the fast swelling and strong mechanical properties were studied. The fourth application was to make fast responsive thermo-reversible superporous hydrogels.
