50|$|Security <b>Electric</b> <b>Fences</b> are <b>electric</b> <b>fences</b> {{constructed}} using {{specialised equipment}} and built for perimeter security {{as opposed to}} animal management. Security <b>electric</b> <b>fences</b> consist of wires that carry pulses of electric current to provide a non-lethal shock to deter potential intruders. Tampering with the fence also results in an alarm that is logged by the security <b>electric</b> <b>fence</b> energiser, and can also trigger a siren, strobe, and/or notifications to a control room or directly to the owner via email or phone.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{the design of}} an <b>Electric</b> <b>Fence</b> Monitoring System (EFMS) which detects and announciates fence malfunctions indicating operational ineffectiveness. The EFMS consists of a master unit and up to sixteen slave units. Each slave unit monitors a single remote point on the fence. Slave units gain their power from the <b>electric</b> <b>fence</b> pulse itself. They use a unique transmission algorithm to transmit the peak <b>electric</b> <b>fence</b> voltage, to the master unit. The <b>electric</b> <b>fence</b> wire is used to convey this transmission. The master unit uses a non-linear switched capacitor filter with variable gain control, to detect the slave unit transmissions. This unit displays the peak voltage at each monitored point and allows the setting of alarm trigger points. This thesis includes modelling of the <b>electric</b> <b>fence</b> energiser and typical <b>electric</b> <b>fence</b> line, and the detailed design of the two units that makeup the EFMS...|$|R

We report a case study examining effectiveness of a baited <b>electric</b> <b>fence,</b> as an addition to an existing single woven-wire fence (2. 4 m high), for altering behavior and reducing fence-line contact between elk (Cervus elaphus). We used a video-surveillance system to monitor one 20 -m-long test fence at an elk ranch in north-central Colorado, USA from 2006 to 2007. We conducted 26 trials (11 without <b>electric</b> <b>fence</b> during 48. 2 total cumulative days and 15 with <b>electric</b> <b>fence</b> during 63. 7 days) with different levels of motivation for contact between groups of elk separated by the test fence. We documented 426 contacts between elk (direct transmission risk) or the woven-wire fence (indirect transmission risk) during trials without the <b>electric</b> <b>fence.</b> We documented 0 contacts between adult elk or the woven-wire fence during trials when the <b>electric</b> <b>fence</b> was in place. During our case study, 24 of 25 elk exposed to the <b>electric</b> <b>fence</b> were completely deterred. We emphasize that our approach targets behavior modification of farmed elk routinely exposed to the <b>electric</b> <b>fence,</b> not wild elk that may occasionally approach from the outside. Our results suggest that adding a baited <b>electric</b> <b>fence</b> inside an existing woven-wireâ€“fenced enclosure has potential to provide a cost-effective means to minimize contacts between farmed and wild elk...|$|R

40|$|This study {{assesses the}} {{effectiveness}} of <b>electric</b> <b>fences</b> in reducing conflict between elephants and humans in Sri Lanka. The study looked at five <b>electric</b> <b>fence</b> projects that {{have been set up}} to prevent elephants from straying out of protected wildlife areas into farmers' fields. This conflict between people and elephants is a key social and environmental problem for the country. A household survey gathered information about how effective the fences are and gauged local people's attitudes. The study also looked at why <b>electric</b> <b>fences</b> did not work. It found that, although <b>electric</b> <b>fences</b> do help mitigate conflicts between elephants and humans, they do not completely eliminate the problem and do not offer a 'stand alone' solution. In each survey area, technical as well as socio-economic factors were found to determine levels of success. Community support for the fences was found to be vital. Poor, ad-hoc decisions were a key factor determining success or failure: Fences were often unsuccessful because elephant behaviour had not been properly taken into account. The findings of the study indicate that a thorough appraisal is needed before an <b>electric</b> <b>fence</b> is set up and that adequate resources should be invested in their construction and maintenance. Local people should be involved in a fence's planning, construction and maintenance. The report highlights the need for an integrated approach to the problem of human elephant conflict. Such an approach should involve comprehensive land use planning and habitat enrichment alongside well-planned <b>electric</b> <b>fencing,</b> where appropriate. <b>Electric</b> <b>fences</b> {{are only part of the}} solution.

40|$|Since 1958, when {{details of}} {{electrified}} permanent fencing tried by Massey College became known, {{hundreds of miles}} of <b>electric</b> subdivision <b>fence</b> have been erected. The key to its popularity was the great saving in costs of materials, transport and labour. It was also easier to erect, so it became possible for farm labour to construct <b>electric</b> <b>fences</b> instead of waiting for contract fencers. This reduced the amount of cash to be raised still further. Six manufacturers are selling <b>electric</b> <b>fence</b> equipment, and all have well-illustrated leaflets or booklets giving details of erection. In addition, many farmers, encouraged by Massey College, have kept costs very low by using standard bobbin insulators (Type 436) or short pieces of polythene water-pipe as insulators. The success of <b>electric</b> <b>fencing</b> depends on: (a) Careful insulation of electrified wires. (b) A continuous earth-wire running the length of the fence and connected to the earth terminal of the <b>electric</b> <b>fence</b> unit. (c) Removal of stray wires and excessive green vegetation from the fenceline. In practice thistles, grass, clover, secondary growth and tussocks gradually reach the live wires and reduce the efficiency of the fence, particularly in wet or misty weather. Sometimes insulators slip, break or become coated with dirt, so that again electric leakage becomes serious. Further, the 'wind-chargerâ€™ units available for inaccessible places sometimes fail to keep the battery fully charged. Consequently a number of <b>electric</b> <b>fences</b> have become ineffective. On the other hand a 'mains' operated unit has been used, and the fence has been checked regularly, <b>electric</b> subdivision <b>fences</b> have been very effective. In fact once the stock learn to respect an <b>electric</b> <b>fence</b> over a period of months, they do not worry it if it happens to be off for some days. Nevertheless, ineffective <b>electric</b> <b>fences</b> are so prevalent that many people hesitate to regard them as permanent, and suggest that they should be reinforced or replaced by standard fences when finance becomes available. This makes it clear that there are definite requirements to be met and limits to its use as permanent fencing...|$|R
