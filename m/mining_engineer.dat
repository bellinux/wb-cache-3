5|$|The Mines Inspectorate {{began an}} enquiry, chaired by the <b>mining</b> <b>engineer</b> William Galloway. The report was {{published}} on 15 July. It {{stated that the}} mine was hot {{with high levels of}} coal dust present. The method used to load coal onto underground trucks created quantities of dust, which had aggravated a small explosion and created a chain reaction of related explosions throughout the workings. An inquest held in October concluded that various safety precautions had not been followed, and had the mine been sufficiently watered it would have reduced the coal dust held in the air. The colliery had further problems in October 1910 when a heavy roof fall in the Mafeking return released trapped firedamp, which caused the mine to be temporarily evacuated.|$|E

5|$|Angus McKinnon and Morris A. Ruffner {{filed the}} first copper mining claims at this {{location}} in 1876. In 1880, Frederick A.

In 1883, with the aid of eastern financiers including James A. MacDonald and Eugene Jerome of New York City, they created the United Verde Copper Company. The small adjacent mining camp on Cleopatra Hill was named Jerome in honor of Eugene Jerome, who became the company secretary. United Verde built a small smelter at Jerome and constructed wagon roads from it to Prescott, the Verde Valley, and the Atlantic and Pacific Railroad depot at Ash Fork. However, transport by wagon was expensive, and in late 1884 after the price of copper had fallen by 50percent, the company ceased all operations at the site.|$|E
5|$|David Watts Morgan {{was born}} in Skewen, Wales, in 1867 to Thomas and Margaret Morgan. He was educated at Skewen Elementary School {{until the age of}} eleven, when he began work as a pit boy, helping miners with the less strenuous work such as manning {{ventilation}} doors. At the age of seventeen he was employed as a coal miner in Ynyshir in the Rhondda. In 1880 Watts Morgan became a checkweighman at the newly opened National Colliery in Wattstown, a responsible position that involved tallying the weight of coal extracted by each miner when it reached the surface. During his time at Wattstown he took evening classes to become a <b>mining</b> <b>engineer.</b> He never practised once qualified, but the knowledge he gained was useful to him in his role as the leader of several mine rescues, and gave him a practical knowledge that informed his later political life.|$|E
50|$|In 1917 a {{lieutenant}} of Pancho Villa kidnapped {{a group of}} American <b>mining</b> <b>engineers</b> working in Mexico from a train.

Pedro Alvarado, Sr. had been friendly with Villa before his death, but Villa's men tried kidnapping Bond to hold him for ransom. The Villistas were unable to find Bond because instead of hiding in town he joined a group who fortified and supplied a nearby cave.|$|R

40|$|The {{initial stages}} of the {{development}} of a computerised support system for <b>mining</b> <b>engineers</b> dealing with the management of mine water is described. The need for a software engineering methodology within the work group is discussed together with the perceived attractions of the socalled object model. The results of the preliminary analysis of the tasks necessary for the management of mine water in the prospecting, exploration, feasibility and early planning stages of the life of a mineral property are described, together with the engineering processes which should be considered in parallel and which might benefit from sharing common parts of a computerised support system. The paper may be of particular value to future novices in the field of object-oriented analysis and design.

5|$|The Khewra Salt Mine (or Mayo Salt Mine) {{is located}} in Khewra, north of Pind Dadan Khan, an {{administrative}} subdivision of Jhelum District, Punjab Region, Pakistan, which rises from the Indo-Gangetic Plain. It is Pakistan's largest and oldest salt mine and the world's second largest. It is a major tourist attraction, drawing up to 250,000 visitors a year. Its history dates back to its discovery by Alexander's troops in 320 BC, but it started trading in the Mughal era. The main tunnel at ground level was developed by Dr. H. Warth, a <b>mining</b> <b>engineer,</b> in 1872 during British rule. After independence, the Pakistan Mineral Development Corporation took over the mine, which still remains the largest source of salt in the country, producing more than 350,000 tons per annum of about 99% pure halite. Estimates of the reserves of salt in the mine vary from 82 million tons to 600 million tons.|$|E
5|$|His brother Howard Burnham (1870–1918), born {{shortly before}} {{the family moved to}} Los Angeles, lost one leg at the age of 14 and {{suffered}} from tuberculosis. During his teenage years he lived with Fred in California and learned from his brother the art of Scoutcraft, how to shoot, and how to ride the range, all in spite of his wooden leg. Howard moved to Africa, became a <b>mining</b> <b>engineer</b> in the Johannesburg gold mines, and later wrote a text book on Modern Mine Valuation. He traveled the world and for a time teamed up with Fred on Yaqui River irrigation project in Mexico. During World War I, Howard worked as a spy for the French government, operating behind enemy lines in southwest Germany. Throughout the war he used his wooden leg to conceal tools he needed for spying. From his death bed, Howard returned to France via Switzerland and shared his vital data and secrets with the French government: the Germans were not opening a new front in the Alps and {{there was no need to}} move allied troops away from the Western Front. Howard was buried at Cannes, France, leaving behind his wife and four children. He had been named after his second cousin, Lieutenant Howard Mather Burnham who was killed in action in the American Civil War.|$|E

40|$|An {{analysis}} of development {{prospects for the}} world mining industry is presented, requirements to mining technologies are formulated, as well as key trends of technologic development in the mineral resources complex. The paper demonstrates the role of mining industry and professional education as essential components of sustainable territorial development. Global challenges have been formulated, which {{must be taken into}} account when forming general approaches to the development of mining education. Distinctions of mining education in Russia, Germany, USA and other leading mining countries have been analyzed. Professional standards for <b>mining</b> <b>engineers</b> have been reviewed for different countries, along with their relation to educational standards. It has been shown, what role professional communities play in the development of professional education and stimulation of continuous professional development of <b>mining</b> <b>engineers.</b> Authors point out the need for international integration in the issues of training and continuous professional development of mining specialists, as well as international accreditation of educational programs for <b>mining</b> <b>engineers</b> and their certification. Information is presented on international organizations, performing the function of international accreditation of engineering educational programs, history of their establishment and role within the context of economic globalization.
