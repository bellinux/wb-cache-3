5|$|The ride portion is {{four and}} a half minutes long. Riders with heart conditions, <b>motion</b> <b>sickness,</b> {{claustrophobia}} or similar conditions are not recommended to ride.|$|E
5|$|Because {{the filming}} {{was done by}} the actors using {{hand-held}} cameras, much of the footage is shaky, especially the final sequence in which a character is running down a set of stairs with the camera. Some audience members experienced <b>motion</b> <b>sickness</b> and even vomited as a result.|$|E
5|$|Concept {{work began}} {{during the middle}} of {{production}} on the Persona 2 duology. Featuring staff from the Megami Tensei franchise including artist Kazuma Kaneko and composer Shoji Meguro, development took approximately two years. It was the first game developed by Atlus to feature full voice acting, and one of the company's earliest fully 3D titles. The PS2 remake changed a number of gameplay elements, introduced further cutscenes, adjusted the music, and added the third-person perspective in response to a common trend in Japan of first-person games causing <b>motion</b> <b>sickness.</b> The game sold well in Japan, and was met with mixed to positive reviews worldwide.|$|E
5|$|During the Apollo 11 launch, Armstrong's heart {{reached a}} top rate of 110 beats per minute. He {{found the first}} stage to be the loudest—much noisier than the Gemini 8 Titan II launch—and the Apollo CSM was {{relatively}} roomy compared to the Gemini capsule. This ability to move around was suspected to be the reason why none of the Apollo 11 crew suffered from space sickness, while members of previous crews did. Armstrong was especially happy, {{as he had been}} prone to <b>motion</b> <b>sickness</b> as a child and could experience nausea after doing long periods of aerobatics.|$|E
5|$|Throughout history {{mandrake}}s (Mandragora officinarum) {{have been}} highly sought after for their reputed aphrodisiac properties. However, {{the roots of}} the mandrake plant also contain large quantities of the alkaloid scopolamine, which, at high doses, acts as a central nervous system depressant, and makes the plant highly toxic to herbivores. Scopolamine was later found to be medicinally used for pain management prior to and during labor; in smaller doses it is used to prevent <b>motion</b> <b>sickness.</b> One of the most well-known medicinally valuable terpenes is an anticancer drug, taxol, isolated from the bark of the Pacific yew, Taxus brevifolia, in the early 1960s.|$|E
5|$|Following release, {{some players}} {{reported}} getting <b>motion</b> <b>sickness</b> due {{a combination of}} the narrow field of view used by the game and the bobbing of the player's viewpoint simulating motions during walking. Blow stated they are working on a patch to allow players to adjust their field of view, disable the head bobbing, and enable faster movement options. In August 2016, the Microsoft Windows version was updated to provide support for Nvidia's Ansel extension, which allows players to compose shots to be rendered in ultra-high resolutions or for 3D and virtual reality devices. Following Sony's announcement of the PlayStation 4 Pro, Blow affirmed they will patch the game for that console to support 4k resolutions without sacrificing framerate. Blow is also working to support devices with high dynamic range (HDR) for both PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 4 Pro versions.|$|E
5|$|Humans evolved {{for life}} in Earth gravity, and {{exposure}} to weightlessness {{has been shown to}} have deleterious effects on the health of the human body. Initially, more than 50% of astronauts experience space <b>motion</b> <b>sickness.</b> This can cause nausea and vomiting, vertigo, headaches, lethargy, and overall malaise. The duration of space sickness varies, but it typically lasts for 1–3 days, after which the body adjusts to the new environment. Longer term exposure to weightlessness results in muscle atrophy and deterioration of the skeleton, or spaceflight osteopenia. These effects can be minimized through a regimen of exercise. Other effects include fluid redistribution, slowing of the cardiovascular system, decreased production of red blood cells, balance disorders, and a weakening of the immune system. Lesser symptoms include loss of body mass, nasal congestion, sleep disturbance, and puffiness of the face.|$|E
5|$|Ranked wing {{commander}} at {{the outbreak of}} World WarII, Wackett immediately faced major supply challenges {{in his role as}} Director of Technical Services. Spare parts for the RAAF's mainly British-built equipment were now in short supply, a fact complicated by the infancy of the local aircraft industry and a US arms embargo. His directorate made whatever use it could of civilian repair facilities, setting up central recovery depots to salvage spares from damaged aircraft and other equipment. He also drew on the advice and support of his brother Lawrence, who had established the RAAF's technical services organisation in the 1920s and now, having retired from the Air Force, headed the Commonwealth Aircraft Corporation (CAC). By late 1940, Wackett had been promoted temporary group captain, and joined the Flying Personnel Research Committee. Its members, drawn from the aviation, medical, scientific and technical disciplines, were to study and report upon such factors as aircrew safety, comfort, fatigue, survival, <b>motion</b> <b>sickness,</b> decompression and hypoxia.|$|E
25|$|As astronauts {{frequently}} have <b>motion</b> <b>sickness,</b> NASA has done extensive {{research on the}} causes and treatments for <b>motion</b> <b>sickness.</b> One very promising looking treatment is for the person suffering from <b>motion</b> <b>sickness</b> to wear LCD shutter glasses that create a stroboscopic vision of 4Hz with a dwell of 10 milliseconds.|$|E
25|$|Roughly {{one third}} of the {{population}} are highly susceptible to <b>motion</b> <b>sickness</b> and most of the rest may get <b>motion</b> <b>sickness</b> under extreme conditions. Several factors influence susceptibility to <b>motion</b> <b>sickness.</b> Statistics indicate that {{women are more likely to}} be affected than men and that the risk decreases with advancing age. There is some evidence that people with Asian ancestry get <b>motion</b> <b>sickness</b> more frequently compared with people of European ancestry, and there are situational and behavioral factors, such as whether a passenger has a view of the road ahead, and diet and eating behavior.|$|E
25|$|Current {{evidence}} suggests that 5-HT3 antagonists are ineffective in controlling <b>motion</b> <b>sickness.</b> A randomized, placebo-controlled trial of ondansetron to treat <b>motion</b> <b>sickness</b> in air ambulance personnel showed subjective improvement, {{but it was not}} statistically significant.|$|E
25|$|Roughness: Deviations from a true planar {{pavement}} surface, {{which affects}} vehicle suspension deflection, dynamic loading, ride quality, surface drainage and winter operations. Roughness have wavelengths ranging from 500mm {{up to some}} 40 m. The upper limit may {{be as high as}} 350 m when considering <b>motion</b> <b>sickness</b> aspects; <b>motion</b> <b>sickness</b> is generated by motion with down to 0.1Hz frequency; in an ambulance car driving 35m/s (126km/h), waves with up to 350 m will excite <b>motion</b> <b>sickness.</b>|$|E
25|$|Many cures and preventatives for <b>motion</b> <b>sickness</b> {{have been}} proposed.|$|E
25|$|An airsickness bag, {{also known}} as a barf bag, airsick bag, sick bag, or <b>motion</b> <b>sickness</b> bag, is a small bag {{commonly}} provided to passengers on board airplanes and boats to collect and contain vomit in the event of <b>motion</b> <b>sickness.</b> The airsickness bag was invented by Gilmore Schjeldahl in 1949 for Northwest Orient Airlines.|$|E
25|$|<b>Motion</b> <b>sickness</b> caused {{when both}} systems detect motion {{but they do}} not correspond.|$|E
25|$|Ginger root is {{commonly}} {{thought to be}} an effective anti-emetic, but it is ineffective in treating <b>motion</b> <b>sickness.</b>|$|E
25|$|Diphenhydramine {{also has}} {{antiemetic}} properties, which make it useful in treating the nausea {{that occurs in}} vertigo and <b>motion</b> <b>sickness.</b>|$|E
25|$|Anti-nauseants, {{like those}} {{prescribed}} for <b>motion</b> <b>sickness,</b> are also often prescribed {{but do not}} affect the prognosis of the disorder.|$|E
25|$|Many {{pharmacological}} treatments {{which are}} effective for nausea and vomiting in some medical conditions {{may not be}} effective for <b>motion</b> <b>sickness.</b> For example, metoclopramide and prochlorperazine, although widely used for nausea, are ineffective for motion-sickness prevention and treatment. This {{is due to the}} physiology of the CNS vomiting centre and its inputs from the chemoreceptor trigger zone versus the inner ear. Sedating anti-histamine medications such as promethazine work quite well for <b>motion</b> <b>sickness,</b> although they can cause significant drowsiness.|$|E
25|$|Fresh, {{cool air}} can also relieve <b>motion</b> <b>sickness</b> slightly, {{although}} it is likely this is related to avoiding foul odors which can worsen nausea.|$|E
25|$|A head-worn, {{computer}} device with a transparent display {{can be used}} to mitigate the effects of <b>motion</b> <b>sickness</b> (and spatial disorientation) if visual indicators of the wearer’s head position are shown. Such a device functions by providing the wearer with digital reference lines in their field of vision that indicate the horizon’s position relative to the user’s head. This is accomplished by combining readings from accelerometers and gyroscopes mounted in the device (US Patent 5,966,680). This technology has been implemented in both standalone devices and Google Glass. In two NIH-backed studies, greater than 90% of patients experienced a reduction in the symptoms of <b>motion</b> <b>sickness</b> while using this technology.|$|E
25|$|The {{attraction}} exposes {{riders to}} forces up to 2.5G, {{more than twice}} the force of gravity at the Earth's surface (effectively multiplying a rider's weight by 2.5). A few months after the ride's opening, <b>motion</b> <b>sickness</b> bags were added within easy reach of riders.|$|E
25|$|Diphenhydramine is a first-generation {{antihistamine}} used {{to treat}} a number of conditions including allergic symptoms and itchiness, the common cold, insomnia, <b>motion</b> <b>sickness,</b> and extrapyramidal symptoms. Diphenhydramine also has local anesthetic properties, and {{has been used as}} such in people allergic to common local anesthetics such as lidocaine.|$|E
25|$|In a soda to {{be mixed}} with water {{it is used}} to obtain a very low alcohol drink or pure (brand Ricqlès which {{contains}} 80% alcohol in France); the alcohol is also used to alleviate nausea, in particular <b>motion</b> <b>sickness,</b> by pouring a few drops on a lump of sugar.|$|E
25|$|The {{minimum height}} {{requirement}} for Mission: Space is 44inches (112cm). Spiels and warnings throughout the attraction caution {{that people who}} do not like enclosed dark spaces, simulators, spinning, or are prone to <b>motion</b> <b>sickness</b> should not ride. Signs also warn that the ride may cause nausea, headache, dizziness, or disorientation, and that people prone to <b>motion</b> <b>sickness,</b> or who have a headache or an inner ear problem, or who have a history of migraines, vertigo, or elevated anxiety also should not ride. These signs are similar to those present at considerably less-intense rides in the same park, such as Soarin'. There are also signs which instruct the rider to keep their head flat against the headrest, stating that if one ignores this, the centrifugal motion acting on one's head can cause undesirable effects such as dizziness and/or headaches, or possibly even more serious effects.|$|E
25|$|Ondansetron, marketed {{under the}} brand name Zofran, is a {{medication}} used to prevent nausea and vomiting caused by cancer chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or surgery. It is also useful in gastroenteritis. It has little effect on vomiting caused by <b>motion</b> <b>sickness.</b> It can be given by mouth, or by injection into a muscle or into a vein.|$|E
25|$|<b>Motion</b> <b>sickness</b> {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{prominent}} symptoms of vertigo and develops most often in persons with inner ear problems. The feeling of dizziness and lightheadedness is often accompanied by nystagmus (an involuntary movement of the eye characterized by a smooth pursuit eye movement followed by a rapid saccade in the opposite direction of the smooth pursuit eye movement). During a single episode of vertigo, this action will occur repeatedly. Symptoms can fade while sitting still with the eyes closed.|$|E
25|$|The {{most common}} {{hypothesis}} {{for the cause}} of <b>motion</b> <b>sickness</b> is that it functions as a defense mechanism against neurotoxins. The area postrema in the brain is responsible for inducing vomiting when poisons are detected, and for resolving conflicts between vision and balance. When feeling motion but not seeing it (for example, in a ship with no windows), the inner ear transmits to the brain that it senses motion, but the eyes tell the brain that everything is still. As a result of the discordance, the brain will {{come to the conclusion that}} the individual is hallucinating and further conclude that the hallucination is due to poison ingestion. The brain responds by inducing vomiting, to clear the supposed toxin. Treisman's indirect argument has recently been questioned via an alternative direct evolutionary hypothesis, as well as modified and extended via a direct poison hypothesis. The direct evolutionary hypothesis essentially argues that there are plausible means by which ancient real or apparent motion could have contributed directly to the evolution of aversive reactions, without the need for the co-opting of a poison response as posited by Treisman. Nevertheless, the direct poison hypothesis argues that there still are plausible ways in which the body's poison response system may have played a role in shaping the evolution of some of the signature symptoms that characterize <b>motion</b> <b>sickness.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{most common}} problem {{experienced}} by humans {{in the initial}} hours of weightlessness is known as space adaptation syndrome or SAS, {{commonly referred to as}} space sickness. It is related to <b>motion</b> <b>sickness,</b> and arises as the vestibular system adapts to weightlessness. Symptoms of SAS include nausea and vomiting, vertigo, headaches, lethargy, and overall malaise. The first case of SAS was reported by cosmonaut Gherman Titov in 1961. Since then, roughly 45% of all people who have flown in space have suffered from this condition. The duration of space sickness varies, but rarely has it lasted for more than 72 hours, after which the body adjusts to the new environment.|$|E
25|$|Sensory and {{sensorimotor}} disturbances when {{arriving in}} low Earth orbit are well documented, the most known of these being space <b>motion</b> <b>sickness</b> (SMS). Individual differences, spacecraft size, and body movements cause SMS symptoms. Typically lasting {{the first three}} or four days of weightlessness, symptoms range from headaches and fatigue to nausea and vomiting. The consequences vary from simple discomfort to possible incapacitation, creating potential problems during extra-vehicular activity, re-entry, and emergency egress from the spacecraft. The body receives a variety of conflicting signals from the visual, somato-sensory, and vestibular organs in weightlessness. These conflicting inputs are thought to be the primary cause of SMS, but the precise mechanisms of the conflict are not well understood. Medications currently used to alleviate the symptoms produce undesirable side effects.|$|E
25|$|Space {{neuroscience}} is {{the scientific}} study of the central nervous system (CNS) functions during spaceflight. Living systems can integrate the inputs from the senses to navigate in their environment and to coordinate posture, locomotion, and eye movements. Gravity has a fundamental role in controlling these functions. In weightlessness during spaceflight, integrating the sensory inputs and coordinating motor responses is harder to do because gravity is no longer sensed during free-fall. For example, the otolith organs of the vestibular system no longer signal head tilt relative to gravity when standing. However, they can still sense head translation during body motion. Ambiguities and changes in how the gravitational input is processed can lead to potential errors in perception, which affects spatial orientation and mental representation. Dysfunctions of the vestibular system are common during and immediately after spaceflight, such as space <b>motion</b> <b>sickness</b> in orbit and balance disorders after return to Earth.|$|E
25|$|The neurobehavioral {{assessment}} battery {{that was}} used in the Van Dongen et al. study included the psychomotor vigilance task (PVT). The PVT - which determines alertness and the effects of fatigue on cognitive performance (as determined by lapses in response time and accuracy of responses) by measuring the speed with which subjects respond to a visual or auditory stimulus (by pressing a response button) - has become a standard laboratory tool for the assessment of sustained performance in a variety of experimental conditions. The PVT detects changes in basic neurobehavioral performance that involve vigilant attention, response speed, and impulsivity; and it has been extensively validated in ground-based laboratory studies to detect cognitive deficits that are caused by a variety of factors (e.g., restricted sleep, sleep/wake shifts, <b>motion</b> <b>sickness,</b> residual sedation from sleep medications). The PVT is an optimal tool for repeated use, in contrast to some other cognitive measures, as studies have shown no minimal learning effects and aptitude differences when using the PVT.|$|E
25|$|Tullio phenomenon, {{another of}} the more {{identifiable}} symptoms leading to a positive SCD diagnosis is sound-induced loss of balance. Patients showing this symptom may experience a loss of equilibrium, a feeling of <b>motion</b> <b>sickness</b> or even actual nausea, triggered by normal everyday sounds. Although this {{is often associated with}} loud noises, volume is not necessarily a factor. Patients describe a wide range of sounds that affect balance: the 'rattle' of a plastic bag; a cashier tossing coins into the register; a telephone ringing; a knock at the door; music; the sound of children playing and even the patient's own voice are typical examples of sounds that can cause a loss of balance when this condition is present, although there are countless others. The presence of Tullio may also mean that involuntary eye movements (nystagmus), sometimes rotational, are set off by sound, giving the sufferer the impression that the world is tipping, clockwise or anticlockwise, depending {{on the site of the}} dehiscence. Some patients report this tilt as being as much as 15°. For such persons, a visit to the concert hall or to a noisy playground may seem like being at the epicenter of an earthquake. A change of pressure within the middle ear (for example when flying or nose-blowing) may equally set off a bout of disequilibrium or nystagmus.|$|E
500|$|Thornton's {{research}} into space adaptation sickness {{noted that the}} STS-8 astronauts had escaped severe cases, with none suffering loss of motor control; Gardner suffered a [...] "mild case", but {{was still able to}} manage effectively, while Brandenstein – who had suffered from induced <b>motion</b> <b>sickness</b> during training operations – was entirely unaffected. The symptoms were found to abate within three days of launch.|$|E
500|$|U2 {{developed}} {{a style of}} editing in their previous concert films that involved fast cutting between shots, which Owens wanted to retain in U2 3D. Because fast cutting in 3D would lead to <b>motion</b> <b>sickness</b> or eye strain, the film was edited to incorporate dissolves of at least four frames between shots. Many of the transitions were created by layering several frames of footage {{on top of one}} another into composite images. Each of the layered frames featured a different depth of field to enhance the 3D effects, and up to five images were layered together in a single shot. This made U2 3D the first 3D film to feature composite images with more than two layers, and the first to be edited specifically to prevent the viewer from experiencing <b>motion</b> <b>sickness</b> or eye strain. Software did not exist at the time to layer the 3D images, so new software had to be developed. [...] Because the project was captured in high-definition video, each frame used nearly 20 megabytes of data on 3ality Digital's servers, and the entire film used almost a petabyte (1015 bytes). The 3D editing process took longer than Owens expected, and consequently, the project went over budget, costing $15million to produce. Video editing took 17months, and the final film was cut to a length of 85minutes—seven shorter than originally announced.|$|E
500|$|James Berardinelli, {{reviewing}} {{the film in}} 1996, felt that the pace dragged and the plot bore too close a resemblance to the original series episode [...] "", but considered the start {{and end of the}} film to be strong. Terry Lee Rioux, Kelley's biographer, noted that the film proved [...] "that it was the character-driven play that made all the difference in Star Trek". The slow pacing, extended reaction shots, and the film's lack of action scenes led fans and critics to give the film a variety of nicknames, including The Motionless Picture, The Slow Motion Picture, The <b>Motion</b> <b>Sickness,</b> and Where Nomad [...] Has Gone Before.|$|E
