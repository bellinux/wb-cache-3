5|$|Following Andriamihaja's death, the {{influence}} of Radama's old guard of progressives was eclipsed by that of conservative advisers at court, who grew ever closer to the queen, eventually resulting in Ranavalona's marriage to sampy guardian and conservative figurehead Field Marshal Rainiharo (also called Ravoninahitriniarivo) of Ilafy in 1833.

5|$|From 1785 to 1799, Garrard {{served as}} a trustee of Transylvania Seminary (now Transylvania University). In 1794, the Baptist and more liberal {{trustees}} united against the orthodox Presbyterian {{members of the board}} to elect the seminary's first non-Presbyterian president. That president was Harry Toulmin, a Unitarian <b>minister</b> <b>from</b> England. Toulmin's daughter Lucinda would later marry Garrard's son Daniel. As a result of Garrard's relationship with Toulmin, he began to accept some tenets of Unitarianism, specifically the doctrines of Socinianism. By 1802, Garrard and Augustine Eastin had not only adopted these beliefs, but had indoctrinated their Baptist congregations with them. The Elkhorn Baptist Association condemned these beliefs as heretical and encouraged Garrard and Eastin to abandon them. When that effort failed, the Association ceased correspondence and association with both men. This event ended Garrard's ministry and his association with the Baptist church.|$|E
