50|$|Since {{the early}} 1990s, {{electronic}} flicker-free (or Square-Wave) ballasts {{have become increasingly}} popular and affordable {{as an alternative to}} magnetic ballasts by eliminating most of the problems associated with HMI flicker. Unfortunately, their operation is not as simple as a magnetic ballast. Electronic ballasts {{can be thought of as}} operating in three stages—a DC intermediate converter, a power module, and an AC inverter. Power initially flows through the main breakers into an RF <b>mains</b> <b>filter</b> that prevents the flow of noise back onto the incoming power line. Then, rectifiers and capacitors charge and discharge to invert the negative half of the AC cycle and convert the line to positive DC voltage. This is called the DC intermediate. In the second stage, a buck converter draws from the DC intermediate and regulates current to the final power electronics via an electronic control board. This control board carefully adjusts the high frequency duty cycle of its transistors to maintain optimum color and light output as the lamp ages. Finally, the regulated current is inverted by an LF-converter board that uses four Insulated Gate Bipolar Transistors (IGBTs) to switch the DC at precisely 60 Hz into a square wave AC (unlike the sinusoidal pattern of line AC). Leaders in this field include Power Gems Corp, B&S, & Mytronic.|$|E

In this paper, a matching filter topology is presented, which can overcome all these limitations. It is shown, that the optimal adaptation of the presented structure leads to a simple, insensitive, {{easy to use and}} very robust solution.

5|$|LC filters at low {{frequencies}} become awkward; the components, especially the inductors, become expensive, bulky, heavy, and non-ideal. Practical 1H inductors require many {{turns on a}} high-permeability core; that material will have high losses and stability issues (e.g., a large temperature coefficient). For applications such as a <b>mains</b> <b>filters,</b> the awkwardness must be tolerated. For low-level, low-frequency, applications, RC filters are possible, but they cannot implement filters with complex poles or zeros. If the application can use power, then amplifiers {{can be used to}} make RC active filters that can have complex poles and zeros. In the 1950s, Sallen–Key active RC filters were made with vacuum tube amplifiers; these filters replaced the bulky inductors with bulky and hot vacuum tubes. Transistors offered more power-efficient active filter designs. Later, inexpensive operational amplifiers enabled other active RC filter design topologies. Although active filter designs were commonplace at {{low frequencies}}, they were impractical at high frequencies where the amplifiers were not ideal; LC (and transmission line) filters were still used at radio frequencies.|$|R
40|$|This chapter {{provides}} {{an introduction to}} the modeling and control of power generation from wind turbine systems. In modeling, {{the focus is on the}} electrical components: electrical machine (e. g. permanent-magnet synchronous generators), back-to-back converter (consisting of machine-side and grid-side converter sharing a common DC-link), <b>mains</b> <b>filters</b> and ideal (balanced) power grid. The aerodynamics and the torque generation of the wind turbine are explained in simplified terms using a so-called power coefficient. The overall control system is considered. In particular, the phase-locked loop system for grid-side voltage orientation, the nonlinear speed control system for the generator (and turbine), and the non-minimum phase DC-link voltage control system are discussed in detail; based on a brief derivation of the underlying machine-side and grid-side current control systems. With the help of the power balance of the wind turbine, the operation management and the control of the power flow are explained. Concluding simulation results illustrate the overall system behavior of a controlled wind turbine with a permanent-magnet synchronous generator.

5000|$|The {{power supply}} {{circuits}} in electronic equipment that produce direct current (DC) {{needed by the}} device from the alternating current (AC) supplied by <b>mains</b> use <b>filter</b> capacitors to smooth the DC current. A large electric charge can remain in these capacitors after the unit is turned off, constituting a shock hazard. For example switching mode power supplies use a bridge rectifier to convert mains AC power into DC at 320 V (for 220 V mains) or 160 V (for 115 V. mains), before the voltage is reduced by the chopper. These incorporate one or more filter capacitors to smooth the pulsing output voltage from the rectifier. These must typically store enough energy at this high voltage to power the load during the zero crossings of the AC input. In addition, the capacitors in many supplies are made large enough to supply the load during AC outages lasting for a significant fraction of a second. This stored charge is often enough to deliver a lethal shock. The capacitors in high voltage DC power supplies used in devices such as lasers, x-ray machines, radio transmitters and old style CRT computer monitors and televisions can have higher, more dangerous voltages.|$|R
40|$|In {{power supply}} networks, {{the quality of}} the voltage is {{becoming}} more and more of a determining factor. Non-linear loads such as diode or thyristor converters contribute to the degradation of the supply voltage quality. Non-sinusoidal currents of the non-linear loads result in the distortion of the supply voltage wave form at the point of common coupling due to the finite supply impedance. To improve the power quality of the supply voltage active filters and reactive current compensators are used. The optimal power rating and topology of these units are very important, but also the determination of the best compensation strategy for a specific application is very important as well. Different topologies and strategies can often perform related compensation functions, resulting in a situation where financial implications determine the best solution. In this situation the power quality analysis in network using simulation tools is very useful. power factor correction devices (passive <b>filters)</b> <b>mains</b> active restoring devices using semiconductors (active filters) measuring instruments: true rms voltmeter and amperemeter, digital frequency analyse...|$|R
40|$|It is well {{established}} that electrode amplifiers for myoelectric control require high input impedances, high common-mode rejection ratio (CMRR) and <b>mains</b> frequency notch <b>filters</b> to cut out unwanted noise. Further, they generally offer {{a high degree of}} d. c. isolation. However, it is not generally recognised that the isolation between the skin ground electrode and the common lead may reduce at higher frequencies, and this can create a path for interfering common-mode signals. Harmonics of the mains frequency may be a particular concern as they are not rejected by the notch filter. Common-mode interference can adversely affect prostheses in electrically noisy environments, as long lead runs may act as antennas. Moreover, {{because of the nature of}} common-mode, screening the leads may have little effect. Measurements were made on a commercially available electrode amplifier to quantify the effect of injected common-mode signals with and without imbalance in the electrode contact impedances. The results presented here indicate that a low impedance a. c. path between input and output can contribute to the effect of common-mode injection. Analysis of the common mode mechanism is presented and possible alternatives are discussed. ...|$|R
