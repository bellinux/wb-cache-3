40|$|Portions of a {{four-year}} analytical and experimental investigation relative to noise radiation from engine internal components in turbulent flow are summarized. Spectra measured for such airfoils over {{a range of}} chord, thickness ratio, flow velocity, and turbulence level were compared with predictions made by an available rigorous thin-airfoil analytical method.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. An experimental investigation {{has been carried out}} to determine the aerodynamic performance of an annular S-shaped duct representative of that used to connect the compressor spools of aircraft gas turbine engines. Measurements of both the mean flow and turbulent structure have been obtained using both 5 hole pressure probes and a 3 component Laser Doppler Anemometry (LDA) system. The measurements indicate that development of the flow within the duct is complex and significantly influenced by the combined effects of streamwise pressure gradients and flow curvature. For inlet conditions in which boundary layers are developed along an upstream entry length the static pressure, shear stress and velocity distributions are presented. The data shows {{that as a result of}} flow curvature significant streamwise pressure gradients exist within the duct, with this curvature also affecting the generation and suppression of turbulence. The stagnation pressure loss within the duct is also assessed and is consistent with the measured distributions of shear stress. More engine representative conditions are provided by locating a single stage compressor at inlet to the duct. Relative to the naturally developed inlet conditions the flow within the duct is less likely to separate, but mixing out of the compressor blade wakes increases the measured duct loss. With both types of inlet conditions the effect of a <b>radial</b> <b>strut,</b> such as that used for carrying loads and engine services, is also described both in terms of the static pressure distribution along the strut and its contribution to overall loss. The effects of inlet swirl on the flow field that develops within an annular S-shaped duct have also been investigated. By removing the outlet guide vanes from an upstream single stage compressor swirl angles in excess of 30 ° were generated. Results show that within the S-shaped duct tangential momentum is conserved, leading to increasing swirl velocities through the duct as its radius decreases. Furthermore, this component influences the streamwise velocity as pressure gradients are established to ensure the mean flow follows the duct curvature. Consequently in the critical region adjacent to the inner casing, where separation is most likely to occur, higher streamwise velocities are observed. Within the duct substantial changes also occur to the turbulence field which results in an increased stagnation pressure loss between duct inlet and exit. Data is also presented showing the increasing swirl angles through the duct which has consequences both for the design of the downstream compressor spool and of any <b>radial</b> <b>struts</b> which may be located within the duct...|$|R

40|$|Nanoporous (NP) metal foams combine {{desirable}} {{characteristics of}} metals with unique nanoarchitectural features to yield weight normalized properties far superior than either dense metals or bulk metal foams. Due to their high surface to volume ratios these structures show great promise as components of fuel cells, as sensors {{and have been}} suggested for use in biological applications, for example as antimicrobial scaffolds or as platforms on which to explore biological material behavior. While most NP metal foams are isotropic, structures with anisotropic features spanning different length scales can further extend applications. This work examines the parameters controlling the synthesis of transversely isotropic NP Platinum foam by dealloying an amorphous Pt-Si alloy. The structure that is examined in this work is hierarchical with Voronoi polyhedra that form on the free surface and under each polyhedral hyper-structure, nanocrystalline NP Pt foam forms with <b>radial</b> <b>struts</b> of length ~ 60 nm and grain size of 5 nm. The size of the polyhedra can be tailored by changing the dealloying potential.

Finally, the initiation location of these structures {{and the relationship between}} electrochemical parameters and dealloying front evolution is examined.

40|$|Regular {{polygonal}} {{networks have}} been found in explants and dissociated cells of early chick embryos. These networks are readily observable in live cells with phase-contrast optics thus allowing time-lapse cinemicroscopy. They consisted of a regular pattern of nodes and radiating struts found predominantly in the lamelliplasm of the free edges of the cells bordering explants. At the outer edge, the network was terminated by <b>radial</b> <b>struts</b> associated with substrate-attached retraction processes whilst toward the centre of the cells it faded out. The network was also associated with stress fibres running across the cell and with micro-extensions on the dorsal surface. Even within one cell the network varied in size. Time-lapse films showed that microvilli were protruded from the dorsal surface over the nodes. Although the cells containing the networks were poorly motile the network itself was a mobile structure. Many explants from regions differing in prospective fates developed these networks after 2 - 4 days in culture. They appeared earlier in the smaller less yolky cells of definitive endoblast and epiblast. Experiments with dissociated and reaggregated cells confirmed their occurrence mainly in free edges of cells.

Area traverses of a miniature five-hole probe were conducted at various locations within the combustion system providing information on both flow uniformity and total pressure loss.
