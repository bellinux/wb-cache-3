5|$|After World War II, {{industrial}} development quickened. New technology increased farm productivity through automation of feedlots for hogs and cattle, machine <b>milking</b> at dairy farms, and raising chickens in large buildings. Planting became more specialized with hybridization {{of corn and}} wheat, {{and the use of}} farm machinery such as tractors and combines became the norm. University of Minnesota professor Norman Borlaug contributed to these developments as part of the Green Revolution. Suburban development accelerated due to increased postwar housing demand and convenient transportation. Increased mobility, in turn, enabled more specialized jobs.|$|E

5|$|Conversely, DST can {{adversely}} affect farmers, parents of young children, and others whose hours are {{set by the}} sun and they have traditionally opposed the practice, although some farmers are neutral. One reason why farmers oppose DST is that grain is best harvested after dew evaporates, so when field hands arrive and leave earlier in summer their labor is less valuable. Dairy farmers are another group who complain of the change. Their cows {{are sensitive to the}} timing of <b>milking,</b> so delivering milk earlier disrupts their systems. Today some farmers' groups are in favor of DST.|$|E
5|$|O'Flaherty {{interprets the}} myth of Prithu—his {{transformation}} from a hunter who chased the earth-cow to the herdsman-farmer—as a transition in Vedic or Hindu people from eating beef to having cow's milk and cultivated vegetables and grain instead of beef. David Shulman compares Prithu with the Vedic deity Rudra-Shiva. Prithu, like Rudra, is an ideal king, but with a violent side. Prithu's actions of chasing the earth-cow as a hunter and finally <b>milking</b> her, display this terrifying side of the king. Both, Prithu and Rudra, are closely associated with sacrifice.|$|E

5|$|Driessen explores ways {{in which}} nonhuman animals might be {{understood}} to be engaging in political deliberation. His claim is empirical rather than normative, as he presents nonhuman animals as already being in political dialogue with humans; rather than arguing that rights should be extended to animals, he calls for a recognition of how interactions with animals have always been political. This is particularly noticeable, he argues, when humans {{are involved in the}} development of new technologies, analysing the example (following Bruno Latour) of Gaston Lagaffe building a door in dialogue with his boss and the office cat, and of farmers and cows using <b>milking</b> robots. He argues that a recognition of this animal deliberation can lead to more thoughtful forms of both environmentalism and democracy.|$|E
5|$|Governor Deane C. Davis of Vermont {{declared}} a state of emergency and ordered the National Guard to assist with cleanup efforts. Blowing snow continuously blocked roads after being cleared, and snow removal vehicles, not equipped to withstand the excessive snow, began experiencing mechanical issues. The storm left some communities without power or telephone service for up to two days, although isolated outages persisted longer. One person died in Saxtons River. With roads impassable in both New York and New England, tank trucks could not reach dairy farmers, who were in some cases forced to discard thousands of gallons of milk. In other cases, power outages rendered equipment useless, requiring <b>milking</b> to be done manually. One person in New Hampshire died of exhaustion during the storm.|$|E

5|$|Redback {{antivenom}} {{was developed}} by Commonwealth Serum Laboratories, then a government body involved with discovering antivenoms for many venomous Australian creatures. Production involves the <b>milking</b> of venom from redbacks and repeatedly inoculating horses with non-lethal doses. The horse immune systems makes polyclonal antibodies. Blood plasma, containing the antibodies, is extracted by plasmapheresis. The plasma is treated with pepsin, and the active F(ab')2 fragments are separated and purified. Each vial contains 500 units of redback antivenom in approximately 1.5 ml, which is enough to inactivate 5mg of redback spider venom in a test tube. The antivenom has been safely administered to women {{in various stages of}} pregnancy. Redback antivenom has been widely used in Australia since 1956, although evidence from controlled studies for its effectiveness has been lacking. Recent trials show antivenom has a low response rate little better than placebo, and any effect is less than might be achieved with optimal use of standard analgesics. Further studies are needed to confirm or refute its effectiveness. It appears clinically active against arachnidism caused by Steatoda spiders; however, as these cases are often mild and the evidence of its effectiveness is limited, this treatment is not recommended. Similarly, the antivenom has been reported as effective with bites of L. katipo, and L. tredecimguttatus. Animal studies also support its use against envenomation from other widow spiders, having successfully been tested against venom from L. mactans, L. hesperus, and L. tredecimguttatus (synonym L.lugubris).|$|E

40|$|Background: As <b>milk</b> is an {{excellent}} medium for growth of microorganisms, <b>milk</b> gets contaminated very easily leading to its early spoilage and to milk-borne diseases. Objectives: To compare the quality of pasteurized <b>milk</b> with <b>milk</b> cooker-treated <b>milk</b> and to compare the quality of fresh ultra-high-temperature (UHT) <b>milk</b> with that of UHT <b>milk</b> close to expiry date. Materials and Methods: Samples of pasteurized <b>milk,</b> <b>milk</b> heated in <b>milk</b> cooker, fresh UHT <b>milk,</b> and UHT <b>milk</b> nearing expiry date were tested by methylene blue reduction test, coliform test, and colony count test. The results were analyzed statistically using Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 11. 5. Results: All <b>milk</b> samples passed the methylene blue test and UHT-treated <b>milk</b> passed the coliform test also. Out of the 30 fresh pasteurized <b>milk</b> samples, seven (23. 3 %) passed the coliform test; but the same after <b>milk</b> cooker treatment, 16 (53. 3 %) passed the coliform test (P < 0. 05). Fourteen (46. 6 %) out of 30 fresh pasteurized <b>milk</b> samples failed the colony count test, but the same after <b>milk</b> cooker treatment only eight (26. 6 %) failed the test (P = 0. 583). Only seven out of the 60 UHT <b>milk</b> samples failed the colony count test and out of these six (20 %) were close to expiry date (P < 0. 05). Conclusions: <b>Milk</b> cooker-treated <b>milk</b> appears to be safer than the fresh pasteurized <b>milk.</b> Fresh UHT-treated <b>milk</b> is safer then UHT <b>milk</b> close to expiry date...|$|R
40|$|Aim: The {{study was}} {{undertaken}} {{to find out}} the gross composition, nitrogen distribution, and selected mineral content in Surti goat <b>milk,</b> and its comparison was made between cow and buffalo <b>milk.</b> Materials and Methods: Goat <b>milk</b> samples of Surti breed and buffalo <b>milk</b> samples were collected during the period from July to January 2014 at Reproductive Biology Research Unit, Anand Agricultural University (AAU), Anand. Cow <b>milk</b> samples of Kankrej breed were collected from Livestock Research Station, AAU, Anand. Samples were analyzed for gross composition such as total solids (TS), fat, solid not fat (SNF), protein, lactose, and ash. Samples were also analyzed for nitrogen distribution such as total nitrogen (TN), non-casein nitrogen (NCN), non-protein nitrogen (NPN), and selected minerals content such as calcium, magnesium, phosphorous, and chloride. Total five replications were carried out. Results: Goat <b>milk</b> had the lowest TS, fat, protein, and lactose content among all three types of <b>milk</b> studied in the presentinvestigation. On the other hand, the highest TS, fat, protein, and lactose content were found in buffalo <b>milk.</b> Buffalo <b>milk</b> had the highest SNF, calcium, magnesium, and phosphorous content, which was followed by goat <b>milk</b> and lowest in cow <b>milk.</b> The SNF, protein, TN, and calcium content of goat <b>milk</b> were statistically non-significant (p 0. 05) than that of the cow <b>milk</b> as well as buffalo <b>milk.</b> The goat <b>milk</b> had the highest ash and NCN content, which were followed by buffalo <b>milk</b> and lowest in cow <b>milk.</b> However,the differences in ash, NPN, and phosphorous content of three types of <b>milk</b> studied, viz., goat <b>milk,</b> cow <b>milk,</b> and buffalo <b>milk</b> were found statistically non-significant (p 0. 05) than that of the cow <b>milk.</b> The magnesium content of goat <b>milk</b> was statistically non-significant (p 0. 05) than that of the buffalo <b>milk</b> as well as cow <b>milk.</b> Conclusion: It can be concluded from the study that the goat <b>milk</b> has lower TS, fat, lactose, protein content, TN aswell as NPN but higher ash and NCN content compared to cow <b>milk</b> and buffalo <b>milk.</b> The goat <b>milk</b> has lower calcium, phosphorous compared to buffalo <b>milk</b> while it has higher calcium, phosphorous compared to cow <b>milk,</b> and it has higher magnesium, chloride content compared to cow <b>milk</b> and buffalo <b>milk...</b>|$|R

25|$|<b>Milking</b> is now {{performed}} {{almost exclusively}} by machine, though human technicians are still essential on most facilities. The most common <b>milking</b> machine {{is called a}} cluster milker. This milker consists of four metal cups—one per teat—each lined with rubber or silicon. The cluster is attached to both a milk collection system and a pulsating vacuum system. When the vacuum is on, it pulls air from between the outer metal cup and the liner, drawing milk out of the teat. When the vacuum turns off, it gives the teat an opportunity to refill with milk. In most <b>milking</b> systems, a <b>milking</b> technician must attach the cluster to each cow, but the machine senses when the cow has been fully milked and drops off independently.|$|E
25|$|The first <b>milking</b> {{machines}} were {{an extension of}} the traditional <b>milking</b> pail. The early milker device fit on top of a regular milk pail and sat on the floor under the cow.
