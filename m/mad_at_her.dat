2500|$|Following Libra's eviction, HouseGuests {{competed in}} the [...] "Diary Room Confessionals" [...] Head of Household competition. For this competition, HouseGuests were given quotes made by the first four evicted HouseGuests and were {{required}} {{to be the first}} to correctly guess who had made the comment; a correct answer allowed that HouseGuest to eliminate someone from the competition, while an incorrect answer resulted in their own elimination.

On Day 40, HouseGuests competed in the [...] "Haunted Yard" [...] Power of Veto competition. For this competition, HouseGuests had to determine the quantity of an object used to make an object. Each round, HouseGuests could either stay or fold; folding would allow them to continue in the game, but could not get a point whereas the HouseGuest with the answer closest to the correct one would earn a point, though the farthest was eliminated. Dan was the winner of the Power of Veto. Dan, upset with Renny's decision to not nominate April and Ollie together, later debated using the Power of Veto to save Jerry. On Day 42, Dan chose not to use the Power of Veto on either nominee. On Day 45, April became the sixth HouseGuest to be evicted from the house in a vote of four to one. She became the second member of the Jury of Seven.|$|E
