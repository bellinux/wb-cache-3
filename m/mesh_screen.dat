5|$|Sea turtles nest {{on island}} beaches in the park. Park staff {{actively}} assist turtle nesting by removing debris from beaches that might pose {{an obstacle to}} adults and hatchlings. Loggerhead turtles {{are the most common}} sea turtle species and account for nearly all of the turtle nests in the park. Nest sites are identified by daily morning beach patrols and are protected with <b>mesh</b> <b>screen</b> against the predation by abundant raccoon population. Nest protection efforts have reduced predation from 100% of nests disturbed per year to no disturbed nests in 2007, with a more usual average of more than 50% nest disturbance in most years. In 2012 one undisturbed nest was found and protected, five partially disturbed nests were protected, and one nest was destroyed by predators. The threatened eastern indigo snake is also present on the island.|$|E
25|$|Since then, the {{telescope}} has been upgraded several times. Initially, when the maximum expected operating frequency was about 500MHz, the surface consisted of half-inch galvanized wire mesh laid {{directly on the}} support cables. In 1974, a high-precision surface consisting of 40,000 individually adjustable aluminum panels replaced the old wire mesh, and the highest usable frequency rose to about 5000MHz. A Gregorian reflector system was installed in 1997, incorporating secondary and tertiary reflectors to focus radio waves at one point. This allowed installing a suite of receivers, covering the full 1–10GHz range, that could be easily moved to the focal point, giving Arecibo more flexibility. A metal <b>mesh</b> <b>screen</b> was also installed around the perimeter to block the ground's thermal radiation from reaching the feed antennas. Finally, a more powerful 2400MHz transmitter was added.|$|E
25|$|A {{major problem}} left to solve {{was that the}} new {{autorack}} cars did not provide any protection from theft, vandalism, or from severe weather. Individual railroads began installing mesh side screens and solid panels to their racks to protect the vehicles from impact and debris in the late 1960s, and by the early 1970s new racks were being delivered with these side panels. However, thieves and vagrants could still {{gain access to the}} automobiles. In 1973 the first fully enclosed racks with continuous side panels, end doors, and roofs were developed to address this problem. Whitehead & Kales, Ford, N and DT jointly developed a Snap-Pak prototype enclosed tri-level car, NW 400000. The car side was made up of overlapping perforated steel sheets. The ends were protected with two trifold doors, and a corrugated steel roof extended the full length of the car. A competing RailPac prototype was developed by Portec-Paragon, Chrysler, and several railroads. It featured <b>mesh</b> <b>screen</b> side panels, vertically sliding three-piece doors, and a similar roof. The Southern Railway and Greenville Steel Car developed a unique 124-foot articulated three-unit Autoguard car with single axle trucks, SOU 599000-599001.|$|E

The pressure drop across the screens was found to increase linearly with superficial velocity. The collection efficiency of the screens was found to vary by less than 4...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to identify the chemical components of sandalwood oil by using the Gas Chromato- graphy. The sandalwood oil was obtained by steam and water distillation of sandalwood particles which are passina and not passing through a 40 <b>mesh</b> <b>screener,</b> each for 18 and 24 hours distilling times. The identification of the peak of chemical components were done by comparing. the relatioe retention time of the peak of chemical components to that of the chemical so. lution standard, The peak area of each chemical component was calculated. by normalizaion method. The result showed that the distilling of sandalwood particles not passing 40 <b>mesh</b> <b>screener</b> for 18 and 24 hour distilling times each produced oils having as many as 26 and 28 peaks of chemical components respect wely.

2500|$|At {{first the}} worst {{fears of the}} media seemed to be justified. In {{the first week of}} play at the Coliseum, 24 home runs were hit, most of them over the left field fence and screen. Chicago Cubs outfielder Lee Walls, not {{especially}} distinguished as a hitter, was responsible for three of them — in a single game. Commissioner Ford Frick, who had defended the Coliseum's dimensions during the preseason, quickly proposed that a second, [...] <b>mesh</b> <b>screen</b> be established in the stands at [...] from the plate, with any balls that fell between the two a ground rule double; however, that turned to be impossible under earthquake-safety provisions of the Los Angeles building code.|$|E
2500|$|Enclosures for snails {{are usually}} long and thin instead of square. This allows the workers {{to walk around}} (without harming the snails) and reach into the whole pen. The {{enclosure}} may be a trough with sides made of wood, block, fiber cement sheets, or galvanized sheet steel. Cover it with screen or netting. The covering confines the snails and keeps out birds and other predators. Fences or walls are usually [...] high plus at least 5inches into the ground. Fencing made of galvanized metal or hard-plastic sheets helps keep out some predators. A cover will protect against heavy rain. Shade (which may be a fine <b>mesh</b> <b>screen)</b> on warm winter days helps keep the snails dormant. 5mm mesh or finer is used for pen screens or fences.

However, {{in the event that}} one people-seed finds its way through her window screens, unwelcome as it may be, does the simple fact that the woman knowingly risked such an occurrence when opening her window deny her the ability to rid her house of the intruder? [...] Thomson notes that some may argue the affirmative to this question, claiming that [...] "...after all you could have lived out your life with bare floors and furniture, or with sealed windows and doors". But by this logic, she says, any woman could avoid pregnancy due to rape by simply having a hysterectomy – an extreme procedure simply to safeguard against such a possibility. [...] Thomson concludes that although there may be times when the fetus does have a right to the mother's body, certainly in most cases the fetus does not have a right to the mother's body. This analogy raises the issue of whether all abortions are unjust killing.|$|E
2500|$|Since 1971, Serra {{has made}} {{large-scale}} drawings on handmade Hitomi paper or Belgian linen using various techniques. In the early 1970s he drew primarily with ink, charcoal, and lithographic crayon on paper. His primary drawing material {{has been the}} paintstick, a wax-like grease crayon. Serra melts several paintsticks to form large pigment blocks. The drawings do not function as preparatory studies but typically come after a sculpture has been completed, {{as a form of}} notating its spatial relationships. Drawings After Circuit (1972), for instance, followed an installation for documenta of four huge steel plates (8 by 24 feet each) jutting in from the corners of a room, stopping short of meeting in the center. In the mid-1970s, Serra made his first [...] "Installation Drawings" [...] — monumental works on canvas or linen pinned directly to the wall and thickly covered with black paintstick, such as Abstract Slavery (1974), Taraval Beach (1977), Pacific Judson Murphy (1978), and Blank (1978). The drawings Serra has executed since the 1980s continue the experiments with innovative techniques but are less monumental physically. In the late 1980s he explored how to further articulate the tension of weight and gravity by placing pairs of overlapping sheets of paper saturated with paintstick in horizontal and vertical compositions, often working on the floor and using a <b>mesh</b> <b>screen</b> as an intermediary between the gesture and the transfer of pigment to the paper.|$|E
