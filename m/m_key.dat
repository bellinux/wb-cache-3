Key discussed other matters with Cobb beyond the topic of prisoners, and in reply, Secretary of War Edwin Stanton fired a sharp comment to McClellan thatit is not deemed proper for officers bearing flags of truce in respect to the exchange of prisoners to hold any conference with the rebel officers upon the general subject of the existing contest or upon any other subject than what relates to the exchange of prisoners.|$|E
25|$|In {{choosing}} {{the members of}} his cabinet, Hayes spurned Radical Republicans in favor of moderates, and also disregarded anyone whom he considered a potential presidential contender. Among those selected were: William M. Evarts, who had defended President Andrew Johnson against impeachment, as Secretary of State; George W. McCrary, who had helped establish the Electoral Commission of 1877, as Secretary of War; and Carl Schurz, who had supported the Liberal Republican ticket in 1872, as Secretary of the Interior. Additionally, in an effort to reach out to Southern moderates, Hayes selected David <b>M.</b> <b>Key,</b> a former Confederate soldier, to serve as Postmaster General. John Sherman, a close ally and currency issues expert, became Secretary of the Treasury, while Richard W. Thompson was selected to reward Oliver P. Morton for the latter's support at the 1876 Republican National Convention. The Schurz and Evarts nominations alienated both the Stalwart and the Half-Breed factions of the Republican Party. Despite this, his initial Cabinet won confirmation in the Senate with the help of some Southern Senators.|$|E
