The objective of the scientific reports and discussions was {{to gain a better understanding}} of the problems of economic integration of consumers’ demand and forestry production and possible solutions of forest-based entrepreneurship in small-scale forestry, wood processing and non-wood forest products and services. The defined suggestions are directed to further development of the theory and to practical solutions for planning and implementation of rural development activities such as structural funds in many sparsely populated regions in Europe. The results contribute to a better understanding of similarities and differences in challenges for enterprise development in forestry, wood processing and non-wood products and services in EU <b>member</b> <b>states,</b> <b>Associate</b> candidate <b>states</b> and other countries from Central and South-Eastern Europe. ...|$|R
