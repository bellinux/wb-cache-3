He would become an ardent critic of restricted computer access in the lab, which {{at that time was}} funded primarily by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency. When MIT's Laboratory for Computer Science (LCS) installed a password control system in 1977, Stallman found a way to decrypt the passwords and sent users messages containing their decoded password, with a suggestion to change it to the empty string (that is, no password) instead, to re-enable anonymous access to the systems. Around 20% of the users followed his advice at the time, although passwords ultimately prevailed. Stallman boasted of the success of his campaign for many years afterward.|$|E
500|$|With chess it is possible, in principle, to play {{a perfect}} game or {{construct}} a machine to do so as follows: One considers in a given position all possible moves, then all moves for the opponent, etc., {{to the end of}} the game (in each variation). The end must occur, by the rules of the games after a finite number of moves (remembering the 50 move drawing rule). Each of these variations ends in win, loss or draw. By working backward from the end one can determine whether there is a forced win, the position is a draw or is lost. It is easy to show, however, even with the high computing speed available in electronic calculators this computation is impractical. In typical chess positions there will be of the order of 30 legal moves. The number holds fairly constant until the game is nearly finished as shown ... by De Groot, who averaged the number of legal moves in a large number of master games. Thus a move for White and then one for Black gives about 103 possibilities. A typical game lasts about 40 moves to resignation of one party. This is conservative for our calculation since the machine would calculate out to checkmate, not resignation. However, even at this figure there will be 10120 variations to be calculated from the initial position. A <b>machine</b> <b>operating</b> at the rate of one variation per microsecond would require over 1090 years to calculate the first move! ...|$|E
2500|$|For {{a precise}} {{definition}} {{of what it means}} to solve a problem using a given amount of time and space, a computational model such as the deterministic Turing machine is used. The time required by a deterministic Turing machine M on input x is the total number of state transitions, or steps, the machine makes before it halts and outputs the answer ("yes" [...] or [...] "no"). A Turing machine M is said to operate within time f(n), if the time required by M on each input of length n is at most f(n). A decision problem A can be solved in time f(n) if there exists a Turing <b>machine</b> <b>operating</b> in time f(n) that solves the problem. Since complexity theory is interested in classifying problems based on their difficulty, one defines sets of problems based on some criteria. For instance, the set of problems solvable within time f(n) on a deterministic Turing machine is then denoted by DTIME(f(n)).|$|E

2500|$|The {{scientific}} revolution [...] "nurtured {{a growing}} awareness" [...] that [...] "there were universal {{laws of nature}} at work that ordered {{the movement of the}} world and its parts." [...] James K. A. Smith and Amos Yong write that in [...] "astronomy, the Copernican revolution regarding the heliocentrism of the solar system, Johannes Kepler's (1571–1630) three laws of planetary motion, and Isaac Newton's (1642–1727) law of universal gravitation—laws of gravitation and of motion, and notions of absolute space and time—all combined to establish the regularities of heavenly and earthly bodies." [...] With such a backdrop, [...] "deists suggested the watchmaker analogy: just as watches are set in motion by watchmakers, after which they operate according to their pre-established mechanisms, so also was the world begun by the God as creator, after which it and all its parts have operated according to their pre-established natural laws. With these laws perfectly in place, events have unfolded according to the prescribed plan." [...] For Sir Isaac Newton, [...] "the regular motion of the planets made it reasonable to believe in the continued existence of God." [...] Newton also upheld the idea that [...] "like a watchmaker, God was forced to intervene in the universe and tinker with the mechanism {{from time to time to}} ensure that it continued operating in good working order." [...] Like Newton, René Descartes viewed [...] "the cosmos as a great time <b>machine</b> <b>operating</b> according to fixed laws, a watch created and wound up by the great watchmaker." ...|$|E
