40|$|Ultrasonic {{irradiation}} applied either {{above the}} surface of a chromic acid plating bath or through the plating bath itself during the process of chromium electroplating reduces the emissions of hazardous chromic acid mist. The use of ultrasound is particularly effective at high current densities. The results suggest that sonication during the electroplating of chromium may provide a useful method of controlling chrome mist emission without the need for a chemical additive (<b>mist</b> <b>suppressant).</b> In conjunction with lip extraction this could lead to a more efficient process since the use of ultrasound {{has been shown to be}} of benefit in the electroplating process itself...|$|E
40|$|Acid mist is {{generated}} {{during the final}} stage of hydrometallurgical metal refining processes including the electrowinning of copper. In this study, the effect of five process parameters and their interactions on the amount of acid mist generated is analysed quantitatively. The amount of acid mist generated was measured under 32 different operating conditions. It was found that solution's temperature and <b>mist</b> <b>suppressant</b> chemical FC- 1100 had significant effect on the amount of acid mist generated. More than 90 % of the variations in the acid mist generation can be explained by changes in these two parameters and their interaction. To a lesser extent, electrical current density and solution acidity also affected the total amount of acid mist generated. The anode's age and most of the 3, 4, and 5 -way parameter interactions were found to have negligible influence on the amount of acid mist. Overall, acid mist was found to increase with temperature and current density. In contrast, increasing the viscosity of the solutions tends to decrease the amount of acid mist...|$|E
40|$|A 6 : 2 {{chlorinated}} polyfluorinated ether sulfonate (6 : 2 Cl-PFAES) {{with the}} trade name F- 53 B, {{is an alternative}} to perfluorooctanesulfonate (PFOS) in electroplating industry that is uniquely used in China. It was developed as a <b>mist</b> <b>suppressant</b> initially in the 1970 s, but the environmental behaviors and potential adverse effects of the 6 : 2 Cl-PFAES have only recently been investigated. In this work, the occurrence and distribution of perfluoroalkyl sulfonate (PFSA), fluorotelomer sulfonate (FTSA), and PFAES analogues were investigated in municipal sewage sludge samples collected around China. Perfluorobutane, perfluorohexane, perfluorooctane, and perfluorodecanesulfonates, 6 : 2 and 8 : 2 FTSAs, and the emerging 6 : 2 Cl-PFAES were detected. Moreover, 8 : 2 and 10 : 2 Cl-PFAESs were identified {{for the first time}} as new polyfluorinated contaminants using high resolution mass spectrometry. These fluorinated analytes were further quantified with the aid of commercial and laboratory-purified standards. PFOS was the predominant contaminant with a geometric mean (GM) value of 3. 19 ng/g dry weight (d. w.), which was subsequently followed by 6 : 2 Cl-PFAES and 8 : 2 Cl-PFAES (GM: 2. 15 and 0. 50 ng/g d. w., respectively). Both 6 : 2 and 8 : 2 Cl-PFAES were positively detected as the major components in the F- 53 B commercial product, and discrete 6 : 2 Cl-PFAES/ 8 : 2 Cl-PFAES ratios in the product and sludge samples might suggest 8 : 2 Cl-PFAES had enhanced sorption behavior in the sludge due to the increase in hydrophobicity...|$|E
50|$|Based on an OECD {{study on}} PFOS and a risk {{assessment}} by Europe's Scientific Committee on Health and Environmental Risks the European Union practically banned the use of PFOS in finished and semi-finished products in 2006 (maximum content of PFOS: 0.005% by weight). However, PFOS use for industrial applications (e.g. photolithography, <b>mist</b> <b>suppressants</b> for hard chromium plating, hydraulic fluids for aviation) was exempted.In 2009 this directive was incorporated into the REACH regulation. In the summer of 2010 PFOS {{was added to the}} regulation on persistent organic pollutants and the threshold was lowered to max. 0.001% by weight (10 mg/kg).|$|R
40|$|Generation of {{acid mist}} {{is a major}} concern in zinc {{electrowinning}} (EW) due to its detrimental effects on worker's health, the environment and plant infrastructure. One of the effective methods for acid mist control is to form a foam layer above the electrolyte surface by using surfactants. In this work, two saponin-rich products (Mistop® and QLZinc®) and a commercial Licorice product were evaluated and compared as acid <b>mist</b> <b>suppressants</b> in zinc EW. Foam properties, acid mist suppression, phase separation in solvent extraction, cathodic current efficiency (CE) and cathode quality were correlated to the addition of these surfactants. Foam properties studied included minimum soluble solids dosage for 100 % foam coverage, time required to achieve 100 % foam coverage and foam persistence time. The two saponin-rich products were found to be more effective foaming agents than Licorice. Based on foam property tests, the recommended soluble solids dosage was 1. 8, 3. 8 and 21. 6 ppm for Mistop®, QLZinc® and Licorice, respectively. At these dosages, acid mist suppression was 99 % for both Quillaja products and 94 % for Licorice. Foam coverage of 100 % was achieved with 1. 0 ppm of saponins when Mistop® was added, compared with 0. 5 ppm of saponins when QLZinc® was added, suggesting that QLZinc® contains other Quillaja solids which are surface active and positively contribute {{to improve the quality of}} foam produced. For all three acid <b>mist</b> <b>suppressants</b> tested, no significant changes in phase disengagement time and interfacial tension were detected when an organic solution was separately contacted with the zinc electrolytes containing the three agents. The CE for the solutions containing 1. 8, 3. 8 and 21. 6 ppm soluble solids of Mistop®, QLZinc® and Licorice were 91. 4 %, 92. 5 % and 92. 6 %, respectively. These values were slightly lower than for the blank solution (92. 8 %). Zinc deposit quality was also affected slightly by all three agents tested. Overall, it is concluded that under the current testing conditions, Quillaja products, at much lower soluble solids dosage, performed very well and better than Licorice...|$|R
40|$|An {{investigation}} {{of the effect of}} water mists on premixed flame propagation has been conducted onboard the Space Shuttle {{to take advantage of the}} prolonged microgravity environment to study the effect of uniformly distributed clouds of polydisperse water mists on the speed and shape of propagating propane-air premixed flames. The suspension of a quiescent and uniform water mist cloud was confirmed during the microgravity tests. Preliminary results show good agreement with trends obtained by the numerical predictions of a computational model that uses a hybrid Eulerian-Lagrangian formulation to simulate the two-phase, flame/mist interaction. Effective flame suppression is observed at progressively higher water loadings and smaller water droplet sizes. Other unusual flame behavior, such as flame front breakup and pulsating flames, is still under investigation. The promising results from the microgravity tests will be used to assess the feasibility of using water <b>mists</b> as fire <b>suppressants</b> on Earth and on spacecraft...|$|R
40|$|PFOS {{has been}} {{assessed}} CEPA toxic under the Canadian Environmental Protection Act (CEPA, 1999) and {{was added to}} CEPA 1999 Schedule 1 - List of Toxic Substances in 2006. 1 A key element of the Chemicals Management Plan (CMP) involves taking immediate action on five substance categories including PFOS. 2 The Canadian Government has proposed to prohibit uses of 50 PFOS substances because there is strong evidence that they pose a risk to the environment or human health. 3 PFOS {{is included in the}} monitoring plan for the CMP (either Year 1 or Year 2). 4 United States PFOS is not included in EPA’s High Production Volume (HPV) Program. 3 M, the principal global manufacturer of PFOS, working in partnership with EPA, announced in 2000 that it would voluntarily phase out production by the end of 2002. Following the voluntary phaseout of PFOS by 3 M, EPA took prompt regulatory action on March 11, 2002, 5 and December 9, 2002, 6 by publishing two significant new use rules (SNURs) under the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) to limit any future manufacture or importation of 88 PFAS chemicals specifically included in that phaseout. Furthermore, on October 9, 2007, 7 EPA published another SNUR on 183 additional PFAS chemicals. These SNURs recognized the continuation of a few specifically limited, highly technical uses of these chemicals for which alternatives were not available, and which were characterized by very low volume, low exposure, and low releases. Any other uses of these chemicals would require prior notice to and review by the USEPA. The October 2007 SNUR allowed for one existing use of one PFOS salt as a <b>mist</b> <b>suppressant</b> in chromium plating, especially to promote compliance with a Clean Air Act MACT standard and the OSHA permissible exposure limit (PEL) for hexavalent chromium. The preamble to the final rule noted EPA’s concern about ongoing PFOS releases to wastewater, and the Agency’s interest in ways to minimize and/or prevent these releases...|$|E
40|$|A {{preliminary}} investigation {{on the effectiveness}} of water <b>mist</b> as a <b>suppressant</b> in electrical fires under normal-gravity conditions for spacecraft applications is presented. Water-mist suppression experiments of a fire involving an overheated wire are conducted inside a container similar to the Space Shuttle mid-deck locker. Direct and indirect water-mist injection is used with various droplet-size distributions and flow rates. Water mist quickly extinguishes a fire that is directly impacted by the droplets, while much longer spraying times and larger amounts of water are required to suppress fires burning behind a baffle. Smaller droplet size distributions appear to be the most effective. A numerical model enables the simulation of a polydispersed spray, while still providing enough droplet scale resolution for the high-gradient fire suppression scenarios. The preliminary numerical results accurately predict droplet penetration, evaporation, and dispersion into the container as observed in the normal-gravity tests. These qualitative comparisons contribute to the on-going validation process of the model...|$|R
