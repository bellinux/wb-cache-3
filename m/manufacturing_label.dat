40|$|We {{aimed to}} study the {{composition}} and availability of various vitamin preparations in the Indian market, data about which was collected from an annual Drug Compendium. The preparations were assessed for total number, different formulations, constituents and amount of each constituent present in the formulation. A large number of vitamin supplements {{are available in the}} Indian market. It includes single-ingredient products and various combinations of vitamins, minerals, and other constituents. Among single products, the maximum number was that of vitamin D 3 (n= 150). Most of the supplements are available as combinations (76. 49 %), with vitamin-minerals combinations constituting the maximum number. In a large number of products, amount of the vitamins was not specified. The most common formulation for oral administration was capsules (34. 1 %). In our research, majority of the supplements contained nutrient amounts higher than the recommended intakes recommended dietary allowance. Unsupervised intake of vitamins can pose a serious health risk in the susceptible population.

40|$|There are binding {{regulations}} requiring {{safety and}} efficacy aspects of medical devices. The requirements ask for documentation that the devices are safe and effective for their intended use, i. e. if a device has a measuring function it must be correct. In addition to this there are demands for quality systems describing development, <b>manufacturing,</b> <b>labelling,</b> and <b>manufacturing</b> of a device. The requirements are established to guarantee that non-defective medical devices {{are used in the}} routine clinical practice. The fast rates in which the imaging modalities have evolved during the last decades have resulted in numerous new diagnostic tools, such as velocity and deformation imaging in ultrasound imaging. However, {{it seems as if the}} development of evaluation methods and test routines has not been able to keep up the same pace. Two of the studies in this thesis, Study I and IV, showed that computed tomography-based and ultrasound based volume measurements can yield very disparate measurements, and that tissue Doppler imaging-based ultrasound measurements can be unreliable. Furthermore, the new ultrasound modalities impose higher demands on the ultrasound transducers. Transducers are known to be fragile, but defective transducers were less of a problem earlier when the ultrasound systems to a lesser extent were used for measurements. The two other studies, Study II and III, showed that serious transducer errors are very common, and that annual testing of the transducers is not sufficient to guarantee an error free function. The studies in the thesis indicate that the system with Notified Bodies, in accordance with the EU’s Medical Device Directive, checking the function and manufacturing of medical devices does not work entirely satisfactory. They also show that the evaluation of new methods have led to the undesirable situation, where new measuring tools, such as volume rendering from imaging systems, and tissue Doppler-based velocity and deformation imaging in echocardiography are available for clinicians without proven knowledge about their accuracy.

"May 2011 "[ACCESS RESTRICTED TO THE UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI AT AUTHOR'S REQUEST. ] This study examined the effect of country of origin labels on consumers' perceptions of apparel quality, price and purchase intention. This study particularly focused on country of design, parts, and <b>manufacturing</b> <b>labels</b> as potential cues that consumers use when evaluating the quality, price and purchase intention of apparel products. In this study, two countries were used: the United States and China. A literature review was provided to show the link and evolution of country of origin literature and the increase of multinational products in today's marketplace. The Information Processing theory provided the theoretical framework for understanding why consumers use extrinsic cues such as country of origin information when forming their opinions and purchasing products. The results of this study concluded that consumers rated US components that were designed and manufactured also in the U. S. the highest in quality, while Chinese components that were manufactured and designed in China were rated the lowest in quality. Results also indicated that consumers have some confusion when attempting to place a difference between the products made in the U. S with Chinese materials and the products made in China with U. S. materials. This study showed that the extent of country of origin information on product labels does play a large role when consumers' are making inferences about the quality, price and purchase intention of an apparel item...|$|R
