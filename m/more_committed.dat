5|$|Braun herself {{attempted}} suicide on 10 or 11 August 1932 by shooting {{herself in the}} chest with her father's pistol. Historians feel the attempt was not serious, but was a bid for Hitler's attention. After Braun's recovery, Hitler became <b>more</b> <b>committed</b> to her {{and by the end}} of 1932 they had become lovers. She often stayed overnight at his Munich apartment when he was in town. Beginning in 1933, Braun worked as a photographer for Hoffmann. This position enabled her to travel—accompanied by Hoffmann—with Hitler's entourage as a photographer for the Nazi Party. Later in her career she worked for Hoffman's art press.|$|E

The couple later divorce. Paul faces financial troubles when Hilary Robinson (Anne Scott-Pendlebury) withdraws her funding of the Daniels Corporation.|$|E
5|$|Theistic {{evolution}} was {{the idea}} that God intervened in the process of evolution, to guide {{it in such a way}} that the living world could still be considered to be designed. The term was promoted by Charles Darwin's greatest American advocate Asa Gray. However, this idea gradually fell out of favor among scientists, as they became more and <b>more</b> <b>committed</b> to the idea of methodological naturalism and came to believe that direct appeals to supernatural involvement were scientifically unproductive. By 1900, theistic evolution had largely disappeared from professional scientific discussions, although it retained a strong popular following.|$|E

25|$|Linking {{real-world}} {{and virtual}} economies {{is rare in}} MMORPGs, as it is generally believed to be detrimental to gameplay. If real-world wealth {{can be used to}} obtain greater, more immediate rewards than skillful gameplay, the incentive for strategic roleplay and real game involvement is diminished. It could also easily lead to a skewed hierarchy where richer players gain better items, allowing them to take on stronger opponents and level up more quickly than less wealthy but <b>more</b> <b>committed</b> players.|$|E

40|$|Aim of the study: {{to study}} {{hospital}} employees‘ {{job satisfaction and}} organizational commitment in Šilalė district hospital and Klaipėda county hospital. The methods of the study. The anonymous questionnaire, containing 23 questions, was developed for the survey. The {{respondents were asked to}} score responses on a 7 -point Likert scale where 1 stood for „completely disagree/completely dissatisfied“ and 7 – „completely agree/completely satisfied“. The response rate of Šilalė hospital employees‘ was 91 % (N = 117) and of Klaipėda hospital – 60 % (N = 378). The collected survey data was analysed using SPSS statistical analysis package, version 11. 0. Results. Employees‘ overall job satisfaction (5, 5) and the level of organizational commitment (4, 2) is not high. Šilalė hospital employees, comparing them with Klaipėda, are more satisfied with the job (accordingly 5, 9 ir 5, 3) and are <b>more</b> <b>commited</b> to the organization (accordingly 4, 7 ir 4, 0). Health professionals are mostly satisfied with such job dimensions as relationship with their colleagues (5, 7), opportunity for professional growth (5, 1) and possibility for using their skills at work (4, 9). The main dissatisfiers are salary (2, 8), opportunity for advancement (3, 7), social security (3, 9). The level of affective and continuance commitment is not high (accordingly 4, 7 and 4, 4), and normative commitment – low (3, 6). The strongest correlation (Spearmen‘s ratio) was observed between overall job satisfaction and satisfaction with proffesion - 0, 464, satisfaction with career - 0, 487. Hospital employees‘ satisfaction with their profession is not high (4, 4) – doctors and nurses are not likely to recommend their proffesion for the children (2, 8). Elder emloyees and these having big job experience are more satisfied with their profession and <b>more</b> <b>commited</b> to the organization. Doctors and nurses who has less workload are more satisfied with their job and <b>more</b> <b>commited</b> to the organization. Conclusions. Hospital employees are satisfied with the job but their organizational commitment is relatively low. The doctors and nurses are mostly satisfied with relationship with colleagues, opportunity for professional growth and possibility for using their skills at work. The main factors influencing job dissatisfaction are salary, opportunity for advancement, social security. Elder emloyees and these having big job experience and less workload are <b>more</b> <b>more</b> <b>commited</b> to the organization...|$|R

25|$|Alcohol myopia {{has also}} been found to affect one’s level of {{commitment}} to a personal goal. Individual commitment to a goal is dependent upon level of personal desire and feasibility of the goal. A person’s ability to appropriately interpret feasibility is inhibited by alcohol myopia. This is because desire is a more salient stimulus than feasibility, causing those experiencing alcohol myopia to ignore the less salient stimulant of feasibility. Because one is less inhibited {{by the prospect of}} unfeasible goals, those under the influences of alcohol myopia tend to feel <b>more</b> <b>committed</b> to their goals than sober individuals. Studies testing the relationship between intoxication and level of commitment to goals support the theory that increased goal commitment (despite level of feasibility) is a side effect of alcohol myopia.|$|E
25|$|Tissue-specific {{stem cells}} produce {{differentiated}} cells {{through a series}} of increasingly <b>more</b> <b>committed</b> progenitor intermediates. In hematopoiesis (blood cell formation), the process begins with long-term hematopoietic stem cells that self-renew and also produce progeny cells that upon further replication go {{through a series of}} stages leading to differentiated cells without self-renewal capacity. In mice, deficiencies in DNA repair appear to limit the capacity of hematopoietic stem cells to proliferate and self-renew with age. Sharpless and Depinho reviewed evidence that hematopoietic stem cells, as well as stem cells in other tissues, undergo intrinsic aging. They speculated that stem cells grow old, in part, as a result of DNA damage. DNA damage may trigger signalling pathways, such as apoptosis, that contribute to depletion of stem cell stocks. This has been observed in several cases of accelerated aging and may occur in normal aging too.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Processes {{involving}} {{conversion of}} mature adult cells into undifferentiated cells have tremendous therapeutic potential in treating {{a variety of}} malignant and non-malignant disorders, including degenerative diseases. This can be achieved in autologous or allogeneic settings, by replacing either defective cells or regenerating those that are in deficit through reprogramming <b>more</b> <b>commited</b> cells into stem cells. The concept behind reprogramming differentiated cells to a stem cell state is to enable the switching of development towards the required cell lineage {{that is capable of}} correcting the underlying cellular dysfunction. The techniques by which differentiated cells can reverse their development, become pluripotent stem cells and transdifferentiate to give rise to new tissue or an entire organism are currently under intense investigation. Examples of reprogramming differentiation in mature adult cells include nuclear reprogramming of <b>more</b> <b>commited</b> cells using the cytoplasm of empty oocytes obtained from a variety of animal species, or cell surface contact of differentiated cells through receptor ligand interaction. Such ligands include monoclonal antibodies, cytokines or synthetic chemical compounds. Despite controversies surrounding such techniques, the concept behind identification and design/screening of biological or pharmacological compounds to enable re-switching of cell fate in-vivo or ex-vivo is paramount for current drug therapies to be able to target more specifically cellular dysfunction at the tissue/organ level. Herein, this review discusses current research in cellular reprogramming and its potential application in regenerative medicine...|$|R

Nepenthe, the fictional island setting of South Wind, is Capri in light disguise. There he was friends with the eccentric community and opium addict Baron Jacques d'Adelswärd-Fersen. In 1912–1914 he worked for The English Review. He met D. H. Lawrence through this connection. This led to a feud, after Lawrence in his 1922 novel, Aaron's Rod based a character on Douglas. In late 1916 he jumped bail in London {{on a charge of}} indecent assault on a sixteen-year-old boy, and effectively then lived in exile. He himself wrote of this in self-exculpation: 'Norman Douglas of Capri, and of Naples and Florence, was formerly of England, which he fled during the war to avoid persecution for kissing a boy and giving him some cakes and a shilling'. (The boy in fact complained to the police).|$|E

500|$|It is indisputable that Garrow massively {{affected}} the modern, adversarial court system used in several western {{nations and the}} rules of evidence, although he was barely aware of it. Prior to Garrow's time, defendants in felony cases {{were not allowed to}} have defence counsel; as a result, every defendant for arson, rape, robbery, murder and most forms of theft was forced to defend themselves. The first step away from this was with the Trials Act 1696, which allowed treason defendants the right to a counsel. Garrow's practice was a further step forward; with his aggressive and forthright style of cross-examination, he promoted a <b>more</b> <b>committed</b> defence of clients, and indirectly reformed the process of advocacy in the 18th century. His area of advocacy (he was counsel for the defence in 83% of his cases) and style is considered key by Beattie in establishing the [...] "new school" [...] of advocacy; his aggressive style in defence set a new style for advocates to follow that assisted in counteracting a legal system biased against the defendant. While he was not the sole cause of this reform, his position {{at the head of the}} Bar meant that he served as a highly visible example for new barristers to take after. In some ways Garrow was far ahead of his time; he coined the phrase [...] "innocent until proven guilty" [...] in 1791, although the jury refused to accept this principle and it was not confirmed by the courts until much later.|$|E
