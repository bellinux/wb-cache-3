5|$|Telecommunications {{in which}} {{multiple}} transmitters and multiple receivers {{have been designed}} to cooperate and to share the same physical channel are called multiplex systems. The sharing of physical channels using multiplexing often gives very large reductions in costs. <b>Multiplexed</b> systems are laid out in telecommunication networks, and the <b>multiplexed</b> signals are switched at nodes through to the correct destination terminal receiver.|$|E
5|$|Processor–processor and processor–memory {{communication}} can {{be implemented}} in hardware in several ways, including via shared (either multiported or <b>multiplexed)</b> memory, a crossbar switch, a shared bus or an interconnect network of a myriad of topologies including star, ring, tree, hypercube, fat hypercube (a hypercube {{with more than one}} processor at a node), or n-dimensional mesh.|$|E

2500|$|A notable {{feature of}} the former system was <b>multiplexing</b> (or concurrency), where a section of road was {{designated}} by two or more route numbers. [...] Examples of <b>multiplexes</b> include the T7/T12 <b>multiplex</b> between New Ross and Waterford, the T6/T13 <b>multiplex</b> between Cahir and Kilheffernan (east of Clonmel), the T28/T36 <b>multiplex</b> between Newcastlewest and Abbeyfeale and the short T19/T21 <b>multiplex</b> between Thurles and Toor.

5|$|The filters were {{designed}} by Campbell {{for the purpose of}} separating <b>multiplexed</b> telephone channels on transmission lines, but their subsequent use has been much more widespread than that. The design techniques used by Campbell have largely been superseded. However, the ladder topology used by Campbell with the constant k is still in use today with implementations of modern filter designs such as the Tchebyscheff filter. Campbell gave constant k designs for low-pass, high-pass and band-pass filters. Band-stop and multiple band filters are also possible.|$|E
5|$|Three federal {{highways}} {{pass through}} Grand Forks: U.S. Route 2, Interstate 29, and U.S. Highway 81. U.S. Highway 2, known as Gateway Drive in the city, runs {{east to west}} through {{the northern part of}} town and is a four-lane highway. The highway is the primary connection between Grand Forks, East Grand Forks, the Grand Forks Air Force Base, Grand Forks International Airport, and nearby Crookston, Minnesota.

5|$|At {{the turn}} of the century as {{telephone}} lines became available, it became popular to add telegraph onto telephone lines with an earth return phantom circuit. An LC filter was required to prevent telegraph clicks being heard on the telephone line. From the 1920s onwards, telephone lines, or balanced lines dedicated to the purpose, were used for FDM telegraph at audio frequencies. The first of these systems in the UK was a Siemens and Halske installation between London and Manchester. GEC and AT also had FDM systems. Separate pairs were used for the send and receive signals. The Siemens and GEC systems had six channels of telegraph in each direction, the AT system had twelve. All of these systems used electronic oscillators to generate a different carrier for each telegraph signal and required a bank of band-pass filters to separate out the <b>multiplexed</b> signal at the receiving end.|$|E

25|$|By late 2009, <b>multiplexes</b> 2 and A used 64-QAM {{and were}} {{consequently}} {{more prone to}} poor reception, while the other <b>multiplexes</b> used 16-QAM. At switchover the transmission mode was changed from 16-QAM to 64-QAM on <b>Multiplex</b> 1 (PSB1), increasing the effective bandwidth of the <b>multiplex.</b> The switch to 64-QAM mode also provided extra bandwidth on <b>Multiplexes</b> C (COM5) and D (COM6).|$|R
5|$|The first EC-137 {{made its}} maiden flight on 9 February 1972, with the fly-off {{between the two}} radars taking place during March–July that year. Favorable test results led to the {{selection}} of Westinghouse's radar for the production aircraft. Hughes's radar was initially {{thought to be a}} certain winner, simply because much of its design was also going into the new F-15 Eagle's radar program. The Westinghouse radar used a pipelined fast fourier transform (FFT) to digitally resolve 128 Doppler frequencies, while Hughes's radars used analog filters based on the design for the F-15 fighter. Westinghouse's engineering team won this competition by using a programmable 18-bit computer whose software could be modified before each mission. This computer was the AN/AYK-8 design from the B-57G program, and designated AYK-8-EP1 for its much expanded memory. This radar also <b>multiplexed</b> a beyond-the-horizon (BTH) pulse mode that could complement the pulse-Doppler radar mode. This proved to be beneficial especially when the BTH mode is used to detect ships at sea when the radar beam is directed below the horizon.|$|E
5|$|After {{the work}} of John R. Carson in 1915 {{it became clear that}} <b>multiplexed</b> {{telephone}} transmissions could be greatly improved by the use of single sideband suppressed carrier (SSB) transmission. Compared to basic amplitude modulation (AM) SSB has the advantage of half the bandwidth and a fraction of the power (one sideband can have no more than 1/6 of the total power and would typically be a lot less). AM analysed in the frequency domain consists of a carrier and two sidebands. The carrier wave in AM represents the majority of the transmitted power but contains no information whatsoever. The two sidebands both contain identical information so only one is required, at least from an information transmission point of view. Up to this point filtering had been by simple tuned circuits. However, SSB required a flat response over the sideband of interest and maximum rejection of the other sideband with a very sharp transition between the two. As the idea was to put another (completely different) signal in the slot vacated by the unwanted sideband it was important that all traces of it were removed to prevent crosstalk. At the same time minimum distortion (i.e. flat response) is obviously desirable for the sideband being retained. This requirement led to a big research effort in the design of electric wave filters.|$|E

50|$|Carrier systems {{typically}} transmit multiple {{channels of}} communication simultaneously over the shared medium using various forms of <b>multiplexing.</b> Prominent <b>multiplexing</b> methods of the carrier signal are time-division <b>multiplexing</b> (TDM) and frequency-division <b>multiplexing</b> (FDM). A cable television system {{is an example of}} frequency-division <b>multiplexing.</b> Many television programs are carried simultaneously on the same coaxial cable by sending each at a different frequency. Multiple layers of <b>multiplexing</b> may ultimately be performed upon a given input signal. For example, in the public switched telephone network, many telephone calls are sent over shared trunk lines by time-division <b>multiplexing.</b> For long distance calls several of these channels may be sent over a communications satellite link by frequency-division <b>multiplexing.</b> At a given receiving node, specific channels may be demultiplexed individually.|$|R

25|$|Dense {{wavelength}} division multiplexing (DWDM) refers originally to optical signals <b>multiplexed</b> {{within the}} 1550nm band so as to leverage the capabilities (and cost) of erbium doped fiber amplifiers (EDFAs), which are effective for wavelengths between approximately 1525–1565nm (C band), or 1570–1610nm (L band). EDFAs were originally developed to replace SONET/SDH optical-electrical-optical (OEO) re-generators, which they have made practically obsolete. EDFAs can amplify any optical signal in their operating range, regardless of the modulated bit rate. In terms of multi-wavelength signals, {{so long as the}} EDFA has enough pump energy available to it, it can amplify as many optical signals as can be <b>multiplexed</b> into its amplification band (though signal densities are limited by choice of modulation format). EDFAs therefore allow a single-channel optical link to be upgraded in bit rate by replacing only equipment at the ends of the link, while retaining the existing EDFA or series of EDFAs through a long haul route. Furthermore, single-wavelength links using EDFAs can similarly be upgraded to WDM links at reasonable cost. The EDFA's cost is thus leveraged across as many channels as can be <b>multiplexed</b> into the 1550nm band.|$|E
