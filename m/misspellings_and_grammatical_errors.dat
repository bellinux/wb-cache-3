5000|$|Feynman {{attended}} Far Rockaway High School, {{a school}} in Far Rockaway, Queens, which was also attended by fellow Nobel laureates Burton Richter and Baruch Samuel Blumberg. Upon starting high school, Feynman was quickly promoted into a higher math class. A high-school-administered IQ test estimated his IQ at 125—high, but [...] "merely respectable" [...] according to biographer James Gleick. His sister Joan did better, allowing her to claim that she was smarter. Years later he declined to join Mensa International, saying that his IQ was too low. Physicist Steve Hsu stated of the test: [...] I suspect that this test emphasized verbal, as opposed to mathematical, ability. Feynman received {{the highest score in}} the United States by a large margin on the notoriously difficult Putnam mathematics competition exam... He also had the highest scores on record on the math/physics graduate admission exams at Princeton... Feynman's cognitive abilities might have been a bit lopsided... I recall looking at excerpts from a notebook Feynman kept while an undergraduate... it contained a number of <b>misspellings</b> <b>and</b> <b>grammatical</b> <b>errors.</b> I doubt Feynman cared very much about such things.|$|E

40|$|Twitter {{with over}} 500 million users globally, generates over 100, 000 tweets per minute. The 140 {{character}} limit per tweet, perhaps unintentionally, encourages users to use shorthand notations and to strip spellings to their bare minimum "syllables" or elisions e. g. "srsly". The analysis of twitter messages which typically contain <b>misspellings,</b> elisions, <b>and</b> <b>grammatical</b> <b>errors,</b> poses {{a challenge to}} established Natural Language Processing (NLP) tools which are generally designed {{with the assumption that}} the data conforms to the basic grammatical structure commonly used in English language. In order to make sense of Twitter messages it is necessary to first transform them into a canonical form, consistent with the dictionary or grammar. This process, performed at the level of individual tokens ("words"), is called lexical normalisation. This paper investigates various techniques for lexical normalisation of Twitter data and presents the findings as the techniques are applied to process raw data from Twitter.

500|$|In {{several places}} Leland {{provides}} the Italian he was translating. According to Mario Pazzaglini, {{author of the}} 1999 translation, the Italian contains <b>misspellings,</b> missing words, <b>and</b> <b>grammatical</b> <b>errors,</b> <b>and</b> is in a standardised Italian rather than the local dialect one might expect. Pazzaglini concludes that Aradia represents material translated from dialect to basic Italian and then into English, creating a summary of texts, {{some of which were}} mis-recorded. Leland himself called the text a [...] "collection of ceremonies, 'cantrips,' incantations, and traditions" [...] and described it as an attempt to gather material, [...] "valuable and curious remains of ancient Latin or Etruscan lore" [...] that he feared would be lost. There is no cohesive narrative even in the sections that Leland attributes to the Vangelo. This lack of cohesion, or [...] "inconsistency", is an argument for the text's authenticity, according to religious scholar Chas S. Clifton, since the text shows no signs of being [...] "massaged ... for future book buyers." ...|$|R

40|$|Despite {{the efforts}} exerted on error {{correction}} {{by teachers and}} students during English for Academic Purposes (EAP) courses, the literature is split about whether such instruction succeeds in reducing <b>grammatical</b> <b>and</b> lexical <b>errors</b> in student writing. In this study, a longitudinal corpus of essays and reports collected at three key data points along a tertiary EAP course (pre-course, immediate post-course and final assessment) totalling 205, 682 words was annotated for 12, 996 <b>errors</b> across 10 <b>grammatical</b> <b>and</b> lexical <b>error</b> types. The results, including a mixed-effects linear model, showed a general significant {{decline in the number}} of errors produced over the duration of the course. However, closer examination revealed that the frequencies of the majority of individual lexical <b>and</b> <b>grammatical</b> <b>error</b> categories remained unchanged over time, despite specific out-of-class instruction on these errors as well as numerous occasions where teachers provided written corrective feedback. The overall usefulness of the error correction feedback and instruction resulting from the EAP course in question therefore remains inconclusive, although students and other stakeholders may still call for the inclusion of such feedback and instruction on EAP curricula...|$|R
