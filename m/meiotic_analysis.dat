This study aimed to analyze the meiotic behavior of the two species, by <b>meiotic</b> <b>analysis,</b> meiotic index and pollen grain viability, using routine methodologies of the laboratory. By the <b>meiotic</b> <b>analysis,</b> the two species were diploid with 18 chromosomes, and nine bivalents were observed in diakinesis. Laggard chromosomes and fiber spindle problems were the abnormalities observed in both species. The recombination indices were 21. 6 and 18. 8 for P. cristalina and P. miniata, respectively. The most common abnormal post-meiotic products were triads. The meiotic index and the pollen grain viability for P. cristalina were 90. 6 % and 98. 9 %, respectively, and 91. 6 % and 82. 2 % for P. miniata, respectively.

In this report, we present a successful wide-cross between the cultivated pigeonpea and Cajanus lanceolatus, a wild relative from the secondary gene pool, native to Australia, with desirable traits such as frost and drought resistance. A range of F 1 progeny were obtained and the resultant F 1 hybrid plants set mature pods and seeds. The hybrids had intermediate morphology, sharing the traits of both the parents. All the F 1 hybrids flowered profusely. Some of the hybrids were completely male sterile and some were partially fertile with pollen fertility ranging from 35 to 50 %. <b>Meiotic</b> <b>analysis</b> of the fertile F 1 hybrids revealed a high degree of meiotic chromosome pairing between the two parental genomes. <b>Meiotic</b> <b>analysis</b> of the sterile F 1 hybrids revealed that the breakdown of microsporogenesis occurred at the post-meiotic stage after the formation of tetrads.

The relationship between the genus Vulpia and the Festuca rubra aggregate was investigated by the examination of both naturally occurring and artificially produced intergeneric hybrids. Embryo culture was used for both interspecific and intergeneric crosses and the germination of the hybrid embryos by this method proved successful. Of 47 cross combinations (including reciprocals) attempted hybrid plants were obtained for 20 different crosses. Crossability and hybrid fertility were {{not found to be}} obvious indicators of taxonomic distance and unilateral incompatibility was found both in crosses with a self-incompatible species as the female parent and a self-compatible species as the male parent and in crosses where both parental species were self-compatible. Analysis of bivalent pairing at meiosis revealed genome relationships in hybrids between diploid species.

It also identified the paternal X chromosome haplotype (P), indicating that origin of this X pentasomy resulted from two maternal, <b>meiotic</b> non-disjunctions. <b>Analysis</b> of the HUMANDREC region of the androgen receptor (AR) gene in the patient's mother showed a skewed inactivation pattern, while a similar analysis in the proband showed an active paternal X chromosome and preferentially inactivated X chromosomes carryin...|$|R
40|$|AbstractSearches of {{zebrafish}} EST {{and whole}} genome shotgun sequence databases for sequences encoding the sterol-sensing domain (SSD) protein motif identified {{two sets of}} DNA sequences with significant homology to the Drosophila dispatched gene required for release of secreted Hedgehog protein. Using morpholino antisense oligonucleotides, we found that inhibition {{of one of these}} genes, designated Disp 1, results in a phenotype {{similar to that of the}} “you-type” mutants, previously implicated in signalling by Hedgehog proteins in the zebrafish embryo. Injection of disp 1 mRNA into embryos homozygous for one such mutation, chameleon (con) results in rescue of the mutant phenotype. Radiation hybrid mapping localised disp 1 to the same region of LG 20 to which the con mutation was mapped by <b>meiotic</b> recombination <b>analysis.</b> Sequence analysis of disp 1 cDNA derived from homozygous con mutant embryos revealed that both mutant alleles are associated with premature termination codons in the disp 1 coding sequence. By analysing the expression of markers of specific cell types in the neural tube, pancreas and myotome of con mutant and Disp 1 morphant embryos, we conclude that Disp 1 activity is essential for the secretion of lipid-modified Hh proteins from midline structures...|$|R
