40|$|An {{analytical}} {{simulation of}} the dynamics of a gear transmission system is presented and compared to experimental results from a gear noise test rig at the NASA Lewis Research Center. The analytical procedure developed couples the dynamic behaviors of the rotor-bearing-gear system with the response of the gearbox structure. The modal synthesis method is used in solving the overall dynamics of the system. Locally each rotor-gear stage is modeled as an individual rotor-bearing system using the matrix transfer technique. The dynamics of each individual rotor are coupled with other rotor stages through the nonlinear gear mesh forces and with the gearbox structure through bearing support systems. The modal characteristics of the gearbox structure are evaluated using the finite element procedure. A variable time steping integration routine is used to calculate the overall time transient behavior of the system in modal coordinates. The global dynamic behavior of the system is expressed in a generalized coordinate system. Transient and steady state vibrations of the gearbox system are presented in the time and frequency domains. The vibration characteristics of a simple single <b>mesh</b> <b>gear</b> noise test rig is modeled. The numerical simulations are compared to experimental data measured under typical operating conditions.

40|$|Signatures are on file in the Graduate School. iii Fluctuation in static {{transmission}} error is the accepted principal cause of vibration excitation in <b>meshing</b> <b>gear</b> pairs and consequently gear noise.

40|$|AbstractAmong the {{techniques}} used in surface finish machining of gears, the honing {{process has been}} highlighted due to high efficiency in the finishing of hardened gears and ease of adjusting the involutes profile and incident angle in the counter-part. The gear honing process is used to eliminate errors that appears after the heat treatment on the tooth surface and. Although the material and cutting speed of the tool {{are similar to the}} grinding process, honing the process simulates true cinematic movement of the <b>mesh</b> <b>gear,</b> which provides a better surface roughness compared to the Hobbing process. Consequently, it is hard to correct anomalies in the gear teeth. This process has been used to improve the mechanisḿs hydraulic steering pinion / rack system. For the experiments, it were compared two processes, namely honing and hard Hobbing in order to assess the adequate strength in the direction of clockwise rotation and counter clockwise, which represents the actual effort exerted by the driver of the vehicle. The honing process was lead using a 400 Fassler HMX machine tool. In order to assess the significant difference between the experiments, it was used ANOVA and Tukey test. The results obtained from the experiments using the honing process were satisfactory as compared the results obtained from hard hobbing process. Thus, it can be concluded that this process provides an excellent surface finish of the sprockets having a direct impact on the returned vehicle steering syste...|$|E

40|$|A {{series of}} bench top {{experiments}} {{was conducted to}} determine the effects of metallic debris being dragged through <b>meshing</b> <b>gear</b> teeth. A test rig that is typically used to conduct contact fatigue experiments was used for these tests. Several sizes of drill material, shim stock, and pieces of gear teeth were introduced and then driven through the meshing region. The level of torque required to drive the "chip" through the <b>gear</b> <b>mesh</b> was measured. From the data gathered, chip size sufficient to jam the mechanism can be determined. INTRODUCTION In some space mechanisms the loading can be so high that there is some possibility that a gear chip might be liberated while in operation of the mechanism [1 - 5]. Also, due to the closely packed nature of some space mechanisms and the fact that a space grease is used for lubrication, chips that are released can then be introduced to other <b>gear</b> <b>meshes</b> within this mechanism. In this instance, it is desirable to know the consequences of a gear chip entering in between <b>meshing</b> <b>gear</b> teeth. To help provide some understanding, a series of bench-top experiments was conducted to engage chips of simulated and gear material fragments into a <b>meshing</b> <b>gear</b> pair. One purpose of the experiments was to determine the relationship of chip size to the torque required to rotate the gear set through the mesh cycle.
