5|$|Concerning the {{development}} of the much-discussed final scene intended to show the friends Korra and Asami becoming a romantic couple, Bryan Konietzko explained that at first he and DiMartino did not give the idea <b>much</b> <b>weight,</b> assuming they {{would not be able to}} get approval for portraying their relationship. But during the production of the finale they decided to test that assumption, approached the network and found them supportive up to a certain limit. They decided to change the final scene from Korra and Asami only holding hands to also facing each other in a pose referencing the marriage scene a few minutes prior.|$|E
5|$|The most {{important}} side effect {{is an increase}} in risk for epileptic seizures, which caused the drug to be withdrawn from the market for some time and then caused the recommended dosage to be reduced. In comparison to many other antidepressants, it does not cause as <b>much</b> <b>weight</b> gain, sexual dysfunction, or sleepiness. Bupropion acts as an norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitor (NDRI). It is an atypical antidepressant, different from most commonly prescribed antidepressants such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs).|$|E

5|$|During the snatch {{phase of}} the event, Hale was given three {{attempts}} to lift as <b>much</b> <b>weight</b> as she could in snatches. She successfully lifted 74kilograms on her first attempt and 78 kilograms on her second, but failed to lift 82kilograms on her third and final try. The second and {{last part of the}} event included lifting weights using the clean and jerk method. Hale successfully lifted 95kilograms in this manner on her first attempt, but failed to lift 100kilograms on her second and third tries. Her combined score was 173kilograms. This placed the Solomon Islander at twelfth place of the twelve athletes in the event, directly behind the Philippines' eleventh-place finalist Hidilyn Diaz (192kilograms), who in turn ranked behind Poland's tenth-place finalist Marieta Gotfryd (200kilograms). The gold medalist in the event was China's Chen Yanqing, who set an Olympic record with 244kilograms.|$|E
5|$|It {{took two}} hours of intense {{discussion}} to elect the presidium of the Seimas. Jonas Basanavičius, officially nonpartisan, was elected as the chairman and Steponas Kairys, leader of the Social Democrats, was chosen as vice-chairman. Other members were Antanas Smetona, priest Petras Būčys, and Juozas Stankūnas; the secretaries were Liudas Gira, Pranas Klimaitis, and Juozas Gabrys-Paršaitis. The organizational committee proposed a rather academic agenda geared toward cultural issues for the assembly; this initial agenda was vetoed by the delegates. They adopted a new schedule that was more political and highlighted two main goals: holding hearings on the current situation in Lithuania, and deciding which political demands should be submitted to the Tsarist authorities. A major portion of the first day's proceedings was devoted to reports presented by delegates from rural areas. The content of these reports was repetitious and did not carry <b>much</b> <b>weight.</b> The most important question was that of Lithuanian autonomy.|$|E
5|$|Constantin von Tischendorf, {{who worked}} with {{numerous}} Bible manuscripts, was known as somewhat flamboyant, and had ambitiously sought money from several royal families for his ventures, who had indeed funded his trips. Simonides, whose name may be a synonym mocking Tischendorf, had a somewhat obscure history, as he claimed he was at Mt. Athos in the years preceding Tischendorf's contact, making the claim at least plausible. Simonides also claimed his father had died and the invitation to Mt. Athos came from his uncle, a monk there, but subsequent letters to his father were found among his possessions at his death. While the word 'forgery' has been bandied about among scholars regarding the claims on the Sinaiticus by Tischendorf, perhaps a more accurate rendering would be recollation and 'adjusted' restoration as Simonides, an expert on hieroglyphics which are represented throughout the Sinaiticus. Simonides claimed the false nature of the document in The Guardian in an exchange of letters among scholars and others, at the time. Henry Bradshaw, a British librarian known to both men, defended the Tischendorf find of the Sinaiticus, casting aside the accusations of Simonides. Since Bradshaw was a social 'hub' among many diverse scholars of the day, his aiding of Tischendorf was given <b>much</b> <b>weight.</b> Simonides died shortly after, and the issue lay dormant for many years.|$|E

5|$|The Spanish Navy hired two salvage {{companies}} to refloat the battleship, but both declined after they surveyed the wreck. Unable to raise her, the Spanish decided to remove as <b>much</b> <b>weight</b> {{as possible from}} España {{in an attempt to}} lighten her to permit refloating. Her guns were removed and dropped overboard to be picked up later by the salvage vessel Kanguro. The battleship's armor, machinery, and ammunition stores were also removed to lighten her. Her hull was then sealed and partially drained in preparation for raising, but while waiting for the necessary equipment from Italy, several violent storms hit the ship and caused further damage. The battered hull could now no longer be raised, and in November 1924, she broke in half and was abandoned by the Spanish Navy. The 305mm and 102mm guns recovered from España were installed in coastal batteries, some of which remained in service until 1999 before they were retired from service. After the overthrow of King Alfonso XIII, his namesake ship Alfonso XIII, was renamed España in April 1931.|$|E

25|$|In 1802 {{there was}} a partial failure, {{probably}} due to the sides bowing and transferring too <b>much</b> <b>weight</b> to the base where they joined to the deck. After remedial work it failed again in 1812 and was reinforced with timber baulks. Although plans were prepared for replacement in stone, it survived until 1930, when the bottom plates were replaced by a wooden base, which was sealed by puddling.|$|E

25|$|It {{is claimed}} the US Air Force also ran a study effort {{throughout}} the 1950s {{and into the}} 1960s.

25|$|It is {{not entirely}} clear what factors proved most crucial, but some Conservative {{politicians}} felt that Curzon was unsuitable {{for the role of}} Prime Minister because {{he was a member of}} the House of Lords.
