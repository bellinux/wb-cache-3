40|$|Abstract-With ongoing {{attempts}} to reforest both cut-over and abandoned agricultural {{land in the}} lower Mississippi alluvial plain, it has become evident that there exists a need for an efficient regeneration system that makes biological and economic sense. Also, {{there is a need}} to address how to minimize oomoetitkm from invading weeds, to deter predation by small mammals, and to achieve adequate tree establishment. This study was designed as a randomized complete block experiment with treatments arranged as factors (3 species X 2 levels of protection X 4 weed control treatments) wlth three replications. to assess efficacy of seedling protection and weed control to improve seedling growth and survival. The study was conducted on a cleared area in the Delta Experimental Forest, Stoneville, MS. Three tree species, Nuttall oak (Quemus &&//ii Palmer), green ash (Fmxhus pennsylvanica Marsh.). and persimmon (Diospyros Virginia L) were planted as 1 -O bareroot seedlings in March 1997. Each treatment plot had 25 seedlings, spaced at 0. 75 meters X 0. 75 meters. Shelter protection was installed on half of the seedlings. Shelters were 1 meter tall, 15 centimeter diameter plastic tree shelters. Each shelter treatment (with or without shelter) received one of four weed control treatments: mechanical mowing (gas-powered weed ctilter), fabric mat (woven, black polypropylene material), chemical herbicide (Oust, suffometurcin-rnethyl at 210 grams per hectare), or undisturbed (control). Response of shelters and weed control treatments on seedling survival, height and diameter were followed for one growing season. Seedlings in shelters had greater survival (98 percent) than seedlings without shelters (93 percent). For all three species, height growth was significantly greater for sheltered seedlings (43 centimeters) compared to unsheltered seedlings (15 centimeters). For the unsheltered seedlings, fabric <b>mat</b> <b>weed</b> control increased survival relative to chemical weed control. All seedlings had significantly greater height and dieter growth under the fabric <b>mat</b> <b>weed</b> control compared to growth under’the other treatments except for unsheltered oak seedlings. ‘...|$|E

40|$|Hydrological changes {{associated}} with irrigation, {{in conjunction with}} increased nutrient concentrations and aquatic plant densities, have greatly impacted fish habitat values on the Burdekin River floodplain. The two most significant weeds in the Burdekin floodplain are water hyacinth (Eichhornia crassipes) and para grass (Urochloa mutica). Water hyacinth creates a base for the para grass (and then other weeds) to grow out into deeper water, creating <b>weed</b> <b>mats</b> that can then only be removed by mechanical means or floods of the largest magnitude. We attempted to rehabilitate floodplain lagoons by the mechanical removal of floating <b>weed</b> <b>mats</b> and monitored the result by measuring the subsequent effects on fish habitats and fish communities. Prior to weed removal, fish habitats were generally of poor quality, and fish community structure was skewed away from rich native assemblages to depauperate communities dominated in some instances by alien species. Poor water quality arising from floating <b>weed</b> <b>mats</b> {{is considered to be}} the main determinant of reduced fish abundance and diversity. After mechanical weed removal, recovery of water quality and physical habitat led to the re-establishment of many native fish species. Key refuge habitats within the distribution channels were a critical source of recruits for fishes dispersing during times of elevated seasonal flows into the newly rehabilitated reaches. This study demonstrates that floating alien <b>weed</b> <b>mats</b> have significant negative effects upon aquatic communities and that mechanical removal of these <b>weed</b> <b>mats</b> (as opposed to chemical removal) results in dramatic improvements in native fish species richness and abundance.

Treatment effects on biomass, C, and nutrient content, accumulation, and removal were assessed over 2 years in a mature organic trailing blackberry (Rubus L. subgenus Rubus, Watson) production system that was machine harvested for the processed market. Treatments included two irrigation options (no irrigation after harvest and continuous summer irrigation), three weed management strategies (<b>weed</b> <b>mat,</b> hand-weeded, and nonweeded), and two primocane training times (August and February) in two cultivars (Black Diamond and Marion). Floricanes comprised an average of 45 % of the total aboveground plant dry biomass, while primocanes and fruit comprised 30 % and 25 %, respectively. Depending on the treatment, the total aboveground dry biomass accumulation {{over the course of the}} season was 5. 0 – 6. 5 t·ha⁻¹ per year, while C stock of the planting was an estimated 0. 4 – 1. 1 t·ha⁻¹ in late winter. Carbon accounted for ≈ 50 % of the dry biomass of each aboveground plant part, including primocanes, floricanes, and fruit. Weed management had the largest impact on plant biomass and nutrient content. No weed control reduced aboveground dry biomass, the content of nutrients in the primocanes, floricanes, and fruit, and the annual accumulation of dry biomass and nutrients, whereas use of <b>weed</b> <b>mat</b> resulted in the most dry biomass and nutrient content. Nutrient accumulation was similar between the cultivars, although February-trained ‘Marion’ plants had a greater removal of most nutrients in 2014 than the year prior. The amount of nitrogen (N) removed in the fruit was 22, 18, and 12 kg·ha⁻¹ for <b>weed</b> <b>mat,</b> hand-weeded, and nonweeded plots, respectively, in 2013. In 2014, ‘Marion’ and ‘Black Diamond’ differed in N removed in harvested fruit when grown with <b>weed</b> <b>mat</b> at 18 and 24 kg·ha⁻¹, respectively, whereas there was no cultivar effect when plants were grown in hand-weeded or nonweeded plots. Plots with <b>weed</b> <b>mat</b> tended to have the most nutrients removed through harvested fruit in both years. In 2014, N removal from August-trained ‘Marion’ was 5 kg·ha⁻¹ N less than the other training time and cultivar combinations.

The study was conducted in trailing blackberry (Rubus L. subgenus Rubus Watson) planted in May 2010 and certified organic in May 2012. Treatments included two cultivars, Marion and Black Diamond, each with either no weed control after the first year after planting or with weeds managed by hand-weeding or the use of <b>weed</b> <b>mat.</b> Each treatment was amended with organically approved fertilizers at pre-plant and was drip-fertigated with fish emulsion each spring. Most primocane leaf nutrient concentrations were within the range recommended for blackberry. However, leaf nitrogen (N) was low in ‘Black Diamond’, especially when grown without weed control, whereas leaf boron (B) was low in all treatments. In many cases, leaf nutrient concentrations were affected by cultivar and weed management in both the primocanes and the floricanes. The concentration of several nutrients in the fruit differed between cultivars, including calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg), sulfur (S), B, and zinc (Zn), but only fruit Ca was affected by weed management and only in ‘Marion’. In this case, fruit Ca was higher when the cultivar was grown with <b>weed</b> <b>mat</b> than with hand-weeding or no weeding. Total biomass production of primocanes increased from an average of 0. 3 t·ha⁻¹ dry weight (DW) during the first year after planting to 2. 0 t·ha⁻¹ DW the next year. Plants were first cropped the third year after planting and gained an additional 3. 3 t·ha⁻¹ DW in total aboveground biomass (primocanes, floricanes, and fruit) by the end of the third season. Fruit DW averaged 1. 4 t·ha⁻¹ in non-weeded plots, 1. 9 t·ha⁻¹ in hand-weeded plots, and 2. 3 t·ha⁻¹ in <b>weed</b> <b>mat</b> plots. Biomass of senesced floricanes (removed after harvest) averaged 3. 2 t·ha⁻¹ DW and was similar between cultivars and among the weed management treatments. ‘Marion’ primocanes accumulated a higher content of N, phosphorus (P), potassium(K), Mg, S, iron (Fe), B, copper (Cu), and aluminum (Al) than in ‘Black Diamond’. Weeds, however, reduced nutrient accumulation in the primocanes in both cultivars, and accumulation of nutrients was greater in the floricanes than in the previous year’s primocanes. Total nutrient content declined from June to August in the floricanes, primarily through fruit removal at harvest and senescence of the floricanes after harvest. Depending on the cultivar and weed management strategy, nutrient loss from the fruit and floricanes averaged 34 to 79 kg·ha⁻¹ of N, 5 to 12 kg·ha⁻¹ of P, 36 to 84 kg·ha⁻¹ of K, 23 to 61 kg·ha⁻¹ of Ca, 5 to 15 kg·ha⁻¹ of Mg, 2 to 5 kg·ha⁻¹ of S, 380 to 810 g·ha⁻¹ of Fe, 70 to 300 g·ha⁻¹ of B, 15 to 36 g·ha⁻¹ of Cu, 610 to 1350 g·ha⁻¹ of manganese (Mn), 10 to 260 g·ha⁻¹ of Zn, and 410 to 950 g·ha⁻¹ of Al.

40|$|Graduation date: 2014 The {{study was}} {{conducted}} in an organic trailing blackberry (Rubus L. subgenus Rubus, Watson) planting established at the North Willamette Research and Extension Center in Aurora, OR on 26 May 2010. Three weed management systems were compared for 'Marion' and 'Black Diamond': 1) non-weeded; 2) hand-hoed two to three times per year (hand weed); and 3) black landscape fabric mulch (<b>weed</b> <b>mat).</b> The planting was certified organic in May 2012, the first fruiting year. Aboveground weed dry weight (DW) increased from 2010 through 2012 in the non-weeded plots. Findings suggest that nitrogen (N) was the major nutrient affecting blackberry cane growth and fruit development. Other nutrients were considered sufficient as evidenced by soil and plant tissue testing, with the exception of calcium (Ca) and boron, which were {{at the low end of}} the sufficiency range in some soil and tissue samples. Soil nutrients fluctuated a small amount by distance and location relative to the emitter and sampling depth. However overall nutrient concentrations were adequate for good blackberry growth. Given some of the observed nutrient trends, soil sampling should be completed in-row, under the drip emitters where fertilizer is applied, at a 0. 15 cm depth, to ensure proper long-term soil management. Total aboveground plant biomass increased from 0. 3 and 2. 0 t·ha⁻¹ in the non-fruiting years (2010 and 2011, respectively) to 3. 4 t·ha⁻¹ in the fruiting year (2012). Primocane number and plant DW were not affected by cultivar or weed management in 2010. In 2011, 'Black Diamond' had shorter primocanes and less biomass and macro- and micro-nutrient accumulation than 'Marion'. Plants grown without weed control produced fewer but longer primocanes with less biomass and lower nutrient content. In 2012, floricane biomass removed at pruning was greater for ‘Marion’ plants and was least for plants in non-weeded plots, and greatest for plants in <b>weed</b> <b>mat</b> plots. Floricanes had greater macro- and micronutrient concentrations than the primocanes, but less than when the floricane leaves were sampled in July, indicating nutrient loss to the fruit and possibly remobilization of some nutrients during cane senescence. Ultimately, floricanes were also a sink for nutrients, reducing primocane biomass in 2012. During the first harvest year (2012), the cultivars did not differ in the DW yield, however, 'Black Diamond' had a greater fresh yield than 'Marion' (6. 0 kg·plant⁻¹ and 5. 2 kg·plant⁻¹, respectively). The proportion of above-ground DW biomass allocated to fruit in weed controlled plots averaged 40 % in 'Marion' and 56 % in 'Black Diamond', suggesting a greater yield efficiency of 'Black Diamond' plants. Non-weeded plots produced approx. half the fresh yield (3. 65 kg·plant- 1), 39 % of the fruit DW biomass as <b>weed</b> <b>mat</b> plots, and the treatment had fruit with lower moisture content, higher percent soluble solids, and lower Ca concentrations, than the other treatments. Net gain of N averaged 41 kg·ha⁻¹ with weed control compared to 25 kg·ha⁻¹ without weed control. Both cultivars accumulated large quantities of N, potassium, and Ca for growth and yield. Nutrient gains may have exceeded fertilizer nutrients available in the fruit production year. Overall, cultivar and weed management strategies had inconsistent effects on tissue and soil nutrient status during the study, with the exception of N. 'Black Diamond' and 'Marion' performed similarly across all three weed management strategies and appeared well suited to organic production for high-value processed markets. <b>Weed</b> <b>mat</b> appeared best suited for organic systems, reducing labor required for weed control, enhancing nutrient uptake by plants, and producing the greatest amount of plant growth and yield. Weed management strategies affected nutrient accumulation and loss, indicating fertilization may need to be adjusted depending on the strategy used...|$|R
40|$|A commercially {{available}} paper mulch (EcoCover) was assessed for its persistence {{under field conditions}} {{and its ability to}} control weeds in vegetable crops and establishing trees. Weeds were controlled as effectively by EcoCover in autumn-planted cabbage and lettuce crops as by black polythene mulches. The paper mulch was beginning to break down by the time the crop was harvested. Paper mulch that was buried decayed much faster than when left on the soil surface. EcoCover was compared with residual herbicides, black <b>weed</b> <b>mat</b> and another paper mulch (Korromatt) for controlling weeds under trees planted in spring. Both types of paper mulch were prone to being dislodged by wind at exposed sites, but otherwise provided weed control for about 6 months after being laid.

40|$|A new control {{methodology}} {{that uses}} weevils {{has resulted in}} a near 80 % reduction of the notorious water hyacinth, Eichornia crassipes, in Uganda. As weevil damage reduces leaf area and root length, the affected plants cannot grow or produce new plants. Water hyacinth has been labelled the world's worst aquatic weed because of its detrimental effects. Floating in enormous <b>mats,</b> the <b>weed</b> chokes canals and harbours, blocks water intakes for hydropower plants and urban water supply, makes fishing virtually impossible, and provides a breeding ground for the vectors of such diseases as malaria and bilharzia. In eastern Africa, water hyacinth was first reported as a serious nuisance in the late 1980 s. Initial attempts in Uganda to control the weed by physical eradication failed. In 1993, UgandaÕs National Agricultural Research Organisation (NARO) started trials with Neochetina weevils, the hyacinth's natural enemies. Neochetina bruchi and Neochetina eichorniae were imported from Benin, and mass reared in tanks on the shores of Lake Kyoga and Lake Victoria. Periodically, adult weevils were released by fishermen, who {{played a key role in}} the rapid distribution of the weevils in the lakes.

40|$|Extract] Though {{located in}} an intensively {{developed}} agricultural area, surrounded by sugar cane, Lagoon Creek {{is one of the}} most important wetlands and fish habitats in the Herbert River floodplain. It consists of a number of deep connected lagoons and has previously been the subject of community action to restore its riparian vegetation. Lagoon Creek became significantly degraded during the 1990 's and suffered a number of high profile fish kills. Since that time, the entire water surface has been covered by dense mats of water hyacinth – a floating exotic <b>weed.</b> The hyacinth <b>mats</b> have also been secondarily colonised by a number of other plants growing on top of the mats.

40|$|Physical {{control of}} water {{hyacinth}} consists of removing the plants {{from the water}} by hand or machines. It is considered over effetive because it involves removing the whole plants from water. The first attempt on physical control was in 1992 when weed infestation was causing serious problems to the fishing communities in Lake Kyoga. The fishermen had problems of accessing the lake as huge masses of mobile weed blocked landing sites. Furthermore, the fishers lost their nets, which were swept away by mobile water hyacinth. As a result, an integrated control strategy involving physical control (manual and mechanical removal) was put in place. Through this method, the fishers were able to open up access routes to fishing grounds even though <b>weed</b> <b>mats</b> often reblocked the access routes. In the infested lakes, manual removal offered remedial relief to fish Iandings and other access sites. Sites of strategic importance such as hydro-electric power generation dam, water intake points and docking points which had large masses of water hyacinth required heavy machinery and mechanical harvesters were used at these sites...|$|R

The published article is copyrighted by the American Society for Horticultural Science and can be found at: [URL] impact of organic fertilizer source on the growth, fruit quality, and yield of blackberry (Rubus L. subgenus Rubus Watson) cultivars (Marion and Black Diamond) grown in a machine-harvested, organic production system for the processed market was evaluated from 2011 to 2013. The planting was established in Spring 2010 using approved practices for organic production and was certified in 2012. Plants were irrigated using a dripline under a woven polyethylene groundcover (<b>weed</b> <b>mat)</b> installed for <b>weed</b> management. Two sources of liquid fertilizer were evaluated: 1) a corn steep liquor and fish waste digestion blend (‘‘corn’’; 2. 5 N– 1. 1 P– 1. 2 K); and 2) a fish solubles and molasses blend (‘‘fish’’; 4 N– 0 P– 1. 7 K). Fertilizers were applied by fertigation through the drip system at rates of 56 kg·ha⁻¹ nitrogen (N) per year in 2011 – 12 and 90 kg·ha⁻¹ N in 2013. The impact of fertigation on drip system performance was evaluated with two maintenance options, ‘‘flushing’’ and ‘‘no flushing’’ of the driplines. Total yield differed among years, whereas fruit soluble solids concentration and firmness as well as floricane biomass at pruning showed a year 3 cultivar interaction. ‘Black Diamond’ had greater total yield and average fruit weight than ‘Marion’, but produced a greater proportion unmarketable fruit. There was no effect of fertilizer source on yield, fruit quality, primocane length, or primocanes/plant in any year with the exception of fruit weight,which was greater with corn than with fish. ‘Marion’ had a greater floricane biomass when fertilized with fish than with corn. Soil nutrients were within the recommended range, except for boron (B), which was below recommended levels. Only soil nitrate-N was affected by fertilizer source, which was greater in ‘Marion’ than in ‘Black Diamond’ when fertilized with fish. Primocane leaf tissue nutrient concentrations were within recommended levels for all nutrients, except for calcium (Ca) and B, which were below recommended standards in both cultivars. Primocane leaf potassium (K) and zinc (Zn) concentrations were greater with fish than with corn. There was no fertilizer source or maintenance effect on emitter flow rate of the drip system in either year. However, flow rates decreased an average of 4. 5...|$|R

The site (50  m by 50  m) was tilled before planting, <b>weed</b> <b>mat</b> laid to reduce competition from weeds, and trickle irrigation installed (to provide water during summer dry periods). The soil is free-draining Te Hapara sandy loam, a Typic Sandy Brown soil (Hewitt [1998]). The soil has no physical or chemical impediments to root development to about 1.2  m depth, other than a variable-depth water table that fluctuates between greater than 1.5  m depth to within about 0.2  m of the surface. The soil appeared to be relatively uniform across the site, with a sandy loamy texture and no distinct zonal structure in the upper parts reflecting a history of cultivation.

40|$|In Mozambique, {{establishment}} of aquatic weeds has been enhanced through the increased enrichment of water bodies by nutrient runoffs from human and agricultural wastes {{that lead to}} an increase in nitrate and phosphate in the water. The aquatic weeds, water hyacinth (Eichhornia crassipes), red water fern (Azolla microphylla), water lettuce (Pistia stratiotes) and salvinia (Salvinia molesta) were found in most watercourses in Mozambique and are becoming aggressive in some watercourses, especially in the Umbeluzi and Incomati rivers. Farmers and people living along the rivers are aware of the negative impact of the water weeds because the large <b>mats</b> of <b>weeds</b> cause loss of shoreline and navigability along the rivers. Other commonly perceived effects of aquatic invasive plants in Mozambique rivers include: reduced navigable surface area; difficulties for fishermen, which reduces income; increased prevalence of insects and insect-borne disease, and decreased aesthetic value. The methods currently used for the control and management of the aquatic weeds are mechanical and manual control. Both methods are costly, time consuming, and only provide a short-term solution to the problem. The study found that the weevils Neochetina eichhorniae and N. bruchi were effective biological control agents in the study area but their impact is too gradual compared to the aggressive proliferation of water hyacinth. The one year lab-experiment clearly demonstrated that the water lettuce weed {{had a significant impact on}} the recruitment of macro-invertebrates to the artificial substrates, and water lettuce contributed to the reduction of oxygen in the water and consequent reduction of macro-invertebrate abundance and diversity. The biodiversity recovered at the same time in the pools containing water lettuce controlled by N. affinis and water lettuce controlled by herbicide, but richness and diversity of macro-invertebrates was higher in the water lettuce controlled by N affinis during the first sampling occasion compared to the water lettuce in pools controlled by herbicide, where macro-invertebrates increased only when DO levels recovered after water lettuce mat decay. The number of taxa recorded in this study is an indication of the significance of macro-invertebrates in an aquatic environment. This therefore emphasizes the need for more research efforts into macrophyte and macro-invertebrate associations in the aquatic system to better understand the implications of habitat modification arising from human activities. It will also enable us to be better equipped with a more appropriate ecological understanding for aquatic resources management...|$|R

40|$|A {{survey was}} {{conducted}} in the Rift Valley water bodies of Ethiopia from 2009 to 2011 to (i) determine the prevalence, agro-ecological distribution and sources of infestation of water hyacinth, (ii) investigate the socio-economic impact of water hyacinth, and (iii) assess changes in its agro-ecological distribution. Water hyacinth was first introduced into the Rift Valley water bodies as an ornamental plant in the 1950 s around the Aba-Samuel Dam. Eventually, it spread into Lake Koka, Lake Ellen, Koka Dam and Wonji site via the Awash River. Now it is common in various water bodies located at low, mid and high altitudes. At Lake Koka, Lake Ellen, Aba-Samuel Dam and Koka Dam, an increase in water cover was observed during the study period. Univariate as well as PCA analysis indicated that rainfall, intensity of wave action on the water bodies, water depth, N and P content of the water bodies were the factors representing the majority of correlations with water hyacinth coverage. Interviews revealed that the <b>weed</b> <b>mats</b> had an adverse socioeconomic impact on the local communities and enterprises. The present assessment also noted that no major management strategy had been employed in the infested water bodies except at Wonji and Koka Dam where a significant reduction (i. e., < 7 % distribution) has been achieved. On the contrary, increasing trend of water hyacinth invasion had been observed in the upstream water bodies. Hence, effective management strategy should be implemented in the upstream water bodies so as sustain achievements in Wonji...|$|R
