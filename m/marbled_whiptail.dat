50|$|The <b>marbled</b> <b>whiptail</b> (Cnemidophorus marmoratus) is {{a species}} of lizard found in the United States, in {{southern}} New Mexico and Texas, and in northern Mexico, in Coahuila, Chihuahua and Durango.|$|E
50|$|The <b>marbled</b> <b>whiptail</b> grows from 8 to {{12 inches}} in length. It is grey or black overall in color with 4 to 8 yellow or white stripes, often with dark mottling, {{giving it a}} marbled appearance. Their {{underside}} is white or pale yellow, with a peach coloration on the throat. They are slender bodied, with long tails.|$|E
50|$|The {{checkered}} whiptail (Cnemidophorus tesselatus) is {{a species}} of lizard found in the southwestern United States in Colorado, Texas and New Mexico, and in northern Mexico in Chihuahua and Coahuila. Many sources believe that the species originated from the hybridization of the <b>marbled</b> <b>whiptail,</b> Cnemidophorus marmoratus, the plateau spotted whiptail, Cnemidophorus septemvittatus, and possibly the six-lined racerunner, Cnemidophorus sexlineatus. It {{is one of many}} lizard species known to be parthenogenic. It is sometimes referred to as the common checkered whiptail to differentiate it from several other species known as checkered whiptails.|$|E
40|$|Roads can {{fragment}} {{habitat and}} increase mortality rates of wildlife, potentially reducing population sizes and gene flow, {{which in turn}} can reduce genetic diversity through genetic drift. Although negative road impacts {{have been found in}} a variety of taxa, not all species are impacted. For instance, species that move less and rarely encounter roads and those that avoid the roads are predicted to not be negatively affected. Yet tests of these predictions are uncommon, especially for reptiles and particularly lizards. Side-blotched lizards (Uta stansburiana) are small sit-and-wait predators, while the larger <b>marbled</b> <b>whiptails</b> (Aspidoscelis marmorata) are active foragers. Their responses to roads were tested in populations inhabiting areas near a large high volume road and a smaller local road. Whiptails were hypothesized to encounter roads frequently, decreasing survival rates and abundance near roads. Conversely, side-blotched lizards should encounter roads less often and have less mortality. Potentially lower abundance of whiptails near roads should also lead to decreased genetic diversity, and the lack of movement across roads should lead to increased genetic differentiation. ^ Neither the abundance nor survival of either species was decreased near the roads. Both species crossed the smaller road less often than expected, and no individuals were found to have crossed the larger road. Genetic diversity was not correlated with distance to road and no divergence was detected. Both species were abundant at all sites, and some lizards crossed the small road, maintaining genetic connectivity. Although unlikely that lizards cross the larger road, the lack of differentiation is likely due to large populations where genetic drift acts slowly. Furthermore, the roads are relatively new, perhaps allowing insufficient time for detectable differentiation. Despite biological differences, these two lizard species do not appear to experience negative demographic or genetic effects of roads. Future studies should examine how lizard species with divergent life histories and behaviors respond to increasing road density. This study is the first on lizard road ecology in the desert Southwest, {{and one of the few}} studies that integrates demographic and genetic data to gain a better understanding of animal responses to roads. ...|$|R
50|$|Like {{most other}} species of whiptail lizards, the <b>marbled</b> <b>whiptail</b> is diurnal and insectivorous. It is wary, energetic, and fast moving, darting for cover if approached. Its {{preferred}} habitat is semiarid, sandy areas with sparse vegetation, or the open edges of wooded areas. Breeding {{takes place in the}} spring, with up to four eggs laid sometime in the month of May. The eggs hatch in six to eight weeks. A second clutch of eggs is occasionally laid in mid summer. Hatchlings look much like the adults, except they have bright blue colored tails.|$|E
40|$|The skin of {{reptiles}} {{is a complex}} organ with many sensory, regulatory and behavioral functions. Desert reptiles face a suite of challenges as their skin contacts hot-dry environmental surfaces. The <b>marbled</b> <b>whiptail</b> lizard, Cnemidophorus marmoratus (Lacertilia: Teiidae), is found in hot deserts of southeastern New Mexico and western Texas and is often above ground during the hottest times of the day. When active, these lizards encounter a broad range and intensity of visible and infrared wavelengths. The role of the integument in temperature regulation, although poorly understood, is critically important for these diurnal animals. Albedo, coloration, pattern, and in some circumstances color change, may be determined by placement and orientation of three distinct types of dermal chromatophores (xanthophores, iridophores, and melanophores). Here electron microscopy, brightfield microscopy, and reflectance spectroscopy is used to examine some of the structural-functional relationships of the chromatophores of these lizards with {{particular attention to the}} crystal containing iridophore...|$|E
40|$|The {{life history}} of a {{population}} of <b>marbled</b> <b>whiptail</b> lizard, Aspidoscelis marmorata, was examined from 1989 to 1994 in the sand dunes of the Biosphere Reserve of Mapimí, in Northern México. Lizards were studied using mark-recapture techniques. Reproduction in females occurred between May and August, with birth hatchlings matching the wet season in August. Reproductive activity was highest in the early wet season (July). Males and females reached adult size class at {{an average age of}} 1. 7 years and 1. 8 years, respectively. Body size of males attained an asymptote around 90 mm snout-vent length and females around 82 mm snout-vent length, at an age of approximately 3. 6 years and 3. 0 years, respectively. The density varied from 7 to 85 individuals / 1. 0 ha. The Mexican population had late maturity, relatively long life expectancy, and fewer offspring. Overall, the observed data for A. marmorata and the expectations of life history theory for a late maturing species (K - rate selection) are in agreement...|$|E
