40|$|Tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum) {{is one of}} the {{important}} vegetables in supplying vitamins, min- erals and fiber to human diets worldwide. Its successful production in the tropics is, however, constrained by environmental variations espe- cially under open field conditions. Two trials were conducted at the Horticulture Research and Teaching Field, Egerton University, Kenya to evaluate the effects of agricultural nets (ag- ronets) herein called eco-friendly nets (EFNs) and floating row covers (FRCs) on microclimate modification, yield, and quality of tomato. A ran- domized complete block design with five repli- cations was used. Tomato plants were grown under fine mesh EFN (0. 4 -mm pore diameter) cover, large mesh EFN (0. 9 -mm pore diameter) cover or FRC. The EFN and FRC were main- tained either permanently closed or opened thrice a week from 9 am to 3 pm. Two open con- trol treatments were used: unsprayed (untreated control) or sprayed with chemicals (treated con- trol). The use of EFN or FRC modified the micro- climate with higher temperatures, lower diurnal temperature ranges, and higher volumetric wa- ter content recorded compared with the controls. On the other hand, light quantity and photo- synthetic active radiation were reduced by the use of EFN and FRC compared with the controls. The use of FRC and EFN resulted in more fruit and higher percent in marketable yield com- pared with open field production. Fruit quality at harvest was also significantly improved by the use of EFN and FRC. Fruits with higher total soluble solids (TSS), lower titratable acidity (TA), and higher <b>sugar</b> <b>acid</b> <b>ratio</b> were obtained in EFN and FRC treatments compared with the controls. Fruits harvested from EFN and FRC were also firmer compared with control fruits. These find- ings demonstrate the potential of EFN and FRC in modifying microclimate conditions and im- proving yields and quality of tomato under tropi- cal field conditions. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|R

40|$|In this study, {{important}} quality properties such as firmness, <b>sugar</b> and <b>acid</b> {{levels were}} measured and analysed in tomatoes harvested from three greenhouses during a five month period and stored at 16 degrees C for over 20 days. Tomatoes were harvested from three identical, neighbouring, greenhouses which were either conventionally ventilated (open greenhouse) or mechanically cooled (semi-closed greenhouses). <b>Sugar</b> and <b>acids</b> levels were hardly affected by greenhouse type. Compared {{to the open}} greenhouse, semi-closed greenhouses produced heavier and less mature (firmer) fruit at the commercial harvesting stage based on colour. Fruit maturity differences could {{be linked to the}} vertical temperature gradient and to CO 2 levels in the different greenhouses. This indicates that CO 2 levels and temperature affect the synchronisation between colour and firmness maturity at harvest. The acceptance period, i. e., the time period both tomato colour and firmness are considered acceptable by consumers, will likely be positively affected when growers switch from conventionally ventilated to semi-closed production systems. Additional to greenhouse effects also effects of the harvest month were observed. The <b>sugar</b> to <b>acid</b> <b>ratio</b> was highest and glucose to fructose ratio was lowest in July, the month with the highest irradiance, irrespective of greenhouse type. The estimated value for the maximum firmness (F-max) varied from 17. 9 N in August to 31. 2 N in June. This monthly variation in F-max explains {{an important part of the}} variation found in the postharvest behaviour of tomatoes. Interestingly, the monthly variation in F-max showed the same trend as found for the monthly initial sugar levels. It might be hypothesised that the monthly variation in glucose and fructose levels causes variation in that part of firmness that is generated by cell turgor. The monthly variation in F-max, <b>sugar</b> and <b>acid</b> levels could not be linked to climate conditions and remains to be elucidated. (C) 2013 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|The common tomato of {{our garden}} {{belongs to the}} natural order Solanaceae and the genus Lycopersicum. The name from lykos, a wolf, and persica a peach, is given to {{it because of the}} {{supposed}} aphrodisiacal qualities, and the beauty of the fruit. By culture and use it is a vegetable, botanically it is a fruit and among the fruits, it is a berry being indehiscent, pulpy, with one or more seeds that are not stones. Though the tomato was not recognized as a valuable food until about a century ago, its merit is now universally accepted. Often it is referred to as 2 ̆ 2 the poor man 2 ̆ 7 s orange 2 ̆ 2 for it is rich in vitamins and in malic and citric acids, possessing besides, a fine appetizing flavor. The popularity of the tomato in man 2 ̆ 7 s diet {{is due to the fact}} that it is a most rewarding crop for the home garden. It grows well practically everywhere, affording high nutritional values. The demand for and acceptance of fresh tomato fruit is based largely on its nutritional value, flavor, aroma, taste, and other characteristics, such as color and texture. These quality criteria are dependent primarily on the structure and chemical composition of the fruit. The importance of quality in tomatoes beyond that which can be expressed in calories per gram, or even in vitamin content, is generally accepted in the United States. In order to meet this increasing demand throughout the year tomatoes often have to be grown in the greenhouses. Therefore, in commercial greenhouses, the tomato has replaced lettuce as the principal crop and it is likely to remain as an important underglass crop. Flavor is a composite of taste and odor. Odor is produced by many aromatic substances which are present in fruit. Flavor itself is a very complex sensation. The physiological basis of flavor perception is extremely complex and not clearly understood. Flavor chemistry is a comparatively new field of research. Tomato fruit quality is determined mainly by the <b>sugar</b> <b>acid</b> <b>ratio,</b> pectins, color, and flavor. Among these color and flavor are probably the most useful criteria for estimating maturity of tomato fruit. Higher quality is associated with redness of color and prominence of flavor. The flavor of a fruit becomes pronounced when the sugar content is at its maximum and the color of the skin acquires the richest shade. Isolation of volatile components from natural products is often difficult. Typical flavor and aroma of tomato fruit is primarily due to its volatile components. Neither complete analysis for nor synthesis of tomato flavor has been accomplished due to the marathon of problems associated with the extraction, separation, and identification techniques. The primary aim of this investigation was to separate and identify some of the major flavor and aroma components in the developing tomato fruit and also to assess the influence of certain physiological and biochemical changes on the biosynthesis of these components during fruit growth...|$|R
40|$|Syrah is an {{important}} wine grape in California but is potentially difficult to manage in the vineyard due to its excessive vigor. Vigorous grapevines require more labor for canopy management and tend to create excess shade, decreasing fruit quality. Winter pruning level, shoot thinning and leaf removal influence the overall density of the canopy and the subsequent degree of shade in the fruit zone. An experiment was conducted to assess the effects of two pruning levels with three degrees of labor-intensive canopy management techniques on berry maturation rate and harvest berry parameters for two growing seasons. In 2008, repeated measures analysis showed no significant effects of severe pruning, shoot thinning or both sides leaf removal on maturation rate of performance indicators. At harvest 2008, severe pruning caused a decrease in yield/meter trellis and Ravaz index. In 2009, repeated measures analysis showed significant effects of severe pruning increasing brix, pH and <b>sugar</b> to <b>acid</b> <b>ratio</b> while shoot thinning and both sides leaf removal had no significant effects on maturation rate of performance indicators. At harvest 2009, severe pruning increased brix, pH, tannin, anthocyanins, phenolics, color density, potassium, amino acid % of yeast assimilable nitrogen (YAN), and the following ratios: sugar/acid, amino acid/ammonium, tannin/anthocyanins and malic/tartaric acid. Additionally, severe pruning decreased tartaric acid, yield/meter trellis, ammonium % of YAN and Ravaz index. The findings presented in this thesis suggest that severe pruning {{could be used as}} a tool in viticultural areas with short growing seasons because of the increased ripening speed observed. However, because severe pruning generally increases berry size which is negative for vinification, it should be studied further with irrigation and management practices that decrease berry size...|$|R

40|$|The Escherichia coli eda gene, which encodes the Entner-Doudoroff aldolase, {{is central}} to the {{catabolism}} of several <b>sugar</b> <b>acids.</b> Here, we show that Eda synthesis is induced by growth on gluconate, glucuronate, or methyl [...] D-glucuronide; phosphate limitation; and carbon starvation. Transcription of eda initiates from three promoters, designated P 1, P 2, and P 4, each of which is responsible for induction under different growth conditions. P 1 controls eda induction on gluconate and is regulated by GntR. P 2 controls eda induction on glucuronate and galacturonate and is regulated by KdgR. P 4 is active under conditions of phosphate starvation and is directly controlled by PhoB. In addition, CsrA activates Eda synthesis, apparently by an indirect mechanism that may be involved in the modest changes in expression level that are associated with carbon starvation. The complex regulation of eda is discussed with respect to its several physiological roles, which apparently accommodate not only <b>sugar</b> <b>acid</b> catabolism but also detoxification of metabolites that could accumulate during starvation-induced stress. <b>Sugar</b> <b>acids</b> are metabolized via the Entner-Doudoroff and Ashwell pathways (1, 5, 8, 20).

Betaine-deficient inbreds are characterized by extremely low betaine: total free amino <b>acid</b> <b>ratios</b> (< 0. 0015). Highly significant correlations are demonstrated between the expected mid-parent and observed betaine:amino <b>acid</b> <b>ratios</b> of 30 hybrids of known pedigree. In 12 hybrids constructed from a betaine-deficient male parent (inbred 1506), the observed betaine:amino <b>acid</b> <b>ratios</b> of the hybrids are proportional to the betaine:amino <b>acid</b> <b>ratios</b> of the female parents (r = 0. 83). Two hybrids, 1146 × 1074 and 1146 × 1506, were chosen for further genetic analysis. The common female parent (1146) and inbred 1074 both exhibit betaine:amino <b>acid</b> <b>ratios</b> of 0. 090, a value which is approximately 90 -fold greater than the betaine:amino <b>acid</b> <b>ratio</b> of inbred 1506. Hybrid 1146 × 1074 exhibits almost exactly twice the betaine:amino <b>acid</b> <b>ratio</b> of hybrid 1146 × 1506. If inbred 1506 is homozygous recessive for a single nuclear gene responsible for the phenotype of betaine deficiency, and if inbreds 1146 and 1074 are homozygous dominant for this allele, then this twofold difference in betaine:amino <b>acid</b> <b>ratio</b> must {{be associated with the}} homozygous dominant and heterozygous conditions, respectively, for 1146 × 1074 and 1146 × 1506.

Approximately 25 % of the F 2 segregants from 1146 × 1506 exhibited extremely low betaine:amino <b>acid</b> <b>ratios</b> (< 0. 0015), whereas 0 % of the F 2 segregants from 1146 × 1074 exhibited this phenotype.

40|$|Plant growth regulators, {{regulating}} {{chemicals and}} growth manipulating techniques are important tools in horticulture. These techniques can regulate various physiological and biochemical aspects {{of growth and}} development, and improve growth, yield and nutritional quality of fruits. Currently, there is a limited report if any, describing how plant growth regulators (PGRs) affect the fruit quality of wax apple, an increasingly popular fruit in Asia. The present study was carried out to investigate the effects of plant growth regulators, gibberellic acid (GA 3) at 20, 50 and 100 mg/L, 2, 4 -dichlorophenoxy acetic acid (2, 4 -D) and naphthalene acetic acid (NAA) at 5, 10 and 20 mg/L, girdling practices (50 %, 100 %, I, C and V-shaped) and hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2) at 5, 20 and 50 mM on the growth, development {{and quality of the}} wax apple (Syzygium samarangense) var. Jambu Air Madu fruits Various physiological, biochemical and phytochemical parameters were monitored during three seasons of fruit growth between December, 2008 to May, 2011 at MARDI, Jalan Kebun, Klang, and a farm in Banting. The results showed that the application of GA 3 enhanced fruit growth, increased fruit length, diameter and color development, fruit number, weight and yield. GA 3 also increased the number of buds and fruit set and reduced bud and fruit drop. With regard to fruit quality, the application of GA 3 increased fruit juice, biomass, total soluble solids (TSS), glucose, fructose, sucrose, total <b>sugar,</b> <b>sugar</b> <b>acid</b> <b>ratio,</b> soluble protein and total flavonoids content in the fruits. In addition, anthocyanin content, total phenol, ascorbic acid and antioxidant activity was higher in GA 3 -treated fruits. Less titrable acidity was also recorded in treated fruits. Treatment with 2, 4 -D enhanced bud development, fruit growth, fruit length and diameter, peel color development and increased fruit set, yields, and fruit drymatter. The treatment also reduced bud and fruit drop. Chlorophyll fluorescence, photosynthetic yield, stomatal conductance and chlorophyll readings were also high in 2, 4 -D-treated branches. Fruit quality parameters such as TSS, total sugar and anthocyanin content were also high in the treated fruits. NAA treatments increased bud number and total number of fruits, enhanced faster fruit growth, fruit size and red color development. Furthermore, NAA treatment increased photosynthetic quantum yield, chlorophyll content, stomatal conductivity, fruit set, fruit weight and total yield in addition to decreasing fruit drop. With regard to fruit quality, NAA treatment increased TSS, fruit juice, total sugar, phenol, flavonoid contents and higher antioxidant activity in the fruits, in addition to a higher anthocyanin, protein content and phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL) activity. Girdling significantly increased fruit growth and development, and color development. Apart from improving leaf physiological characteristics, girdling also increased juice K+ content, TSS, total sugars, total phenolics, flavonoids and anthocyanin content. A higher antioxidant activity in the fruit was also observed. Leaf chlorophyll content and dry matter, total soluble solids and total sugar contents of fruits were significantly increased in wax apple after treatment with H 2 O 2. The application of H 2 O 2 significantly reduced bud drop and enhanced fruit growth, resulting in larger fruit size, increased fruit set, fruit number, fruit biomass and yield. H 2 O 2 treatment increased the K+, anthocyanin, carotenoid, flavonoid, phenolic and soluble protein content. Higher PAL and antioxidant activities were measured in the treated fruits. There was a positive correlation between peel color and TSS and anthocyanin, stomatal conductance with photosynthesis and yield, phenols and flavonoids with antioxidant activity, PAL activity and anthocyanin formation. Finally, net photosynthesis, stomatal conductance and transpiration, leaf chlorophyll and dry matter content in the leaves of the wax apple were significantly increased after GA 3 and H 2 O 2 treatments. Sucrose phosphate synthase (SPS) activity and rubisco expression was also high in GA 3 treatments. In addition, a higher soluble protein content, PAL and anthocyanin formation were recorded in the treated fruits. From this study, it can be concluded that spraying PGRs (50 mg/L GA 3, 10 mg/L NAA or 2, 4 -D), 20 mM H 2 O 2 and C-shaped girdling application results in better yield and quality of wax apple fruits under field conditions...|$|R
