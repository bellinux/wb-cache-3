40|$|This thesis {{analyzes}} in what respect human biosignals {{are suitable}} for communication among man and machine. An exemplary communication system is presented which provides the operation of a computer mouse by electro-oculographical signals (EOG) and head movements of the user. Special eyeglasses with integrated electrodes, amplifiers and acceleration sensors measure the biosignals and transfer them to computer-aided signal processing. In order to discuss here the relationship between 'biosignals' and 'information' {{it is necessary to}} define precisely these central quantities of man-machine communication. The applied information model with its five hierarchical levels statistics, syntax, semantics, pragmatics, and apobetics*, and empirically derived laws about information achieves this goal. Therefore, only under certain conditions the energetic-material biosignals of the individual are information carriers concurrently. It is compellingly concluded from the model that information can only be transmitted if the user of the <b>man-machine</b> <b>system</b> has voluntarily influenceable biosignals. Individually dependent, many bioelectric signals (among other biosignals) fulfil this condition: EOG, EMG and EEG signals, e. g [...] Therefore, they are potentially suitable for communication in various man-machine systems. The operational <b>man-machine</b> <b>system</b> is based on the principles of the above information model and so exemplarily confirms the general statements. Obviously, biological signals for realistic man-machine communication must generally correspond to this information model.

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to present {{research}} in the area of control method for the <b>man-machine</b> <b>systems</b> with brain machine interface (BMI). Concrete target system is, for instance, a car cruising system and so on. Design/methodology/approach – The improved receding horizon control (RHC) method for the sampled-data systems and the adaptive digital-to-analog (DA) converter which has the way to switch the sampling functions according to the system status are used. The feature selection method based on the kernel support vector machines with the backward stepwise selection for the BMI signals are also used. Findings – This paper proposes the new improved RHC method with the adaptive DA converter for the application of the BMI-based systems. The proposed method is illustrated as useful and effective method for the systems to which switch of control laws is indispensable by the simulations. Research limitations/implications – Although the proposed method is effective for the BMI-based systems with switching of control laws, the faster algorithm for RHC will be need to apply to the <b>man-machine</b> <b>systems</b> with the BMI in practical use. Practical implications – The basic concept or framework of the proposed method can be used for the real <b>man-machine</b> <b>systems</b> with the BMI, for examples, car crusing systems, wheel-chaired systems and so on.

40|$|AbstractIn a <b>man-machine</b> <b>system,</b> {{equipment}} reliability and human reliability {{are affected by}} many {{factors such as the}} environment in which equipment is operated and psychological stress imposed on a human operator.

In this paper the relation is expressed qualitatively. Furthermore, equipment reliability and human reliability are represented by failure possibility and error possibility, respectively, which are fuzzy sets on the interval [0, 1]. A method is presented to derive failure possibility and error possibility from subjective estimates of not only the basic failure rate or the basic error rate but also each factor that affects reliability. Fuzzy reasoning is used in this method.
