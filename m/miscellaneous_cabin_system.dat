40|$|Both {{stiffness}} and damping parameters of cabin suspension have important {{influences on the}} dynamic performance of <b>cabin</b> <b>system</b> for heavy truck. To theoretically study ride comfort of <b>cabin</b> <b>system,</b> the {{stiffness and}} damping parameter values of cabin suspension are often required. At present, there is no convenient method unless by bench test to accurately obtain all the stiffness and damping parameters; however, the cost of bench test is relatively high and inconvenient. In this article, according to the real <b>cabin</b> <b>system</b> of a heavy truck, a 3 [*]degree-of-freedom <b>cabin</b> <b>system</b> linear model was presented and its vibration equations were built. By the tested cabin suspension excitations and seat acceleration response, based on curve fitting method, a stiffness and damping parameter identification mathematical model was established. With a practical example of <b>cabin</b> <b>system,</b> the stiffness and damping parameters were identified and validated by bench test. The {{results show that the}} built model and the proposed method are workable and lay a good foundation for the theoretical analysis and/or optimal design of cabin suspension to improve ride comfort...|$|R

40|$|During {{the dynamic}} {{simulation}} of <b>cabin</b> <b>system,</b> the damping parameters values of cabin suspension {{are the key}} factors. In previous work, for obtaining all {{the parameters of the}} <b>cabin</b> <b>system</b> of trucks for long distance transport, a parameters identification model was built by minimizing the error of the root-mean-square acceleration between the tested and the measured. However, the identification precision is not high. In this paper, according to the real <b>cabin</b> <b>system</b> of a heavy duty truck for short distance transport, a 3 -DOF model of <b>cabin</b> <b>system</b> was built. Based on curve fitting method, a new identification model for damping parameters was established. At last, the bench test was done and the comparisons were conducted among the tested values, the values identified by the method built in this work, and those obtained by the method built in previous work. The results show that the model built and the method proposed are feasible, and the identification precision is higher than the previous work...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: In this paper, a {{hydropneumatic}} {{modeling and}} analysis of a heavy truck <b>cabin</b> air suspension <b>system</b> is presented. <b>Cabin</b> air suspension <b>system</b> is a system which improves ride comfort of a heavy truck and it can reduce vibration between truck frame and cabin. The components of the system, air spring, shock absorber, leveling valve and full <b>cabin</b> <b>system</b> are mathematically modelled using AMESim software. Simulation results of components and full <b>cabin</b> <b>system</b> are compared with experimental data of components and test results of a cabin using 6 axis simulation table. It is found that the simulation results are in good agreements with test results, and the hydropneumatic model can be used well to predict dynamic characteric of heavy truck <b>cabin</b> air suspension <b>system...</b>|$|R

5000|$|<b>Cabin</b> {{ejection}} <b>systems</b> {{are much}} more complex than ejection seats. They require devices to cut cables and conduits connecting the cabin and fuselage. The cabin must have aerodynamic stabilization devices to avoid tumbling after ejection. The large cabin weight mandates a very large parachute, with a more complex extraction sequence. Air bags must deploy beneath the cabin to cushion impact or provide flotation. To make on-the-pad ejections feasible, the separation rockets {{would have to be}} quite large. In short, many complex things must happen in a specific timed sequence for cabin ejection to be successful, and in a situation where the vehicle might be disintegrating. If the airframe twisted or warped, thus preventing cabin separation, or debris damaged the landing airbags, stabilization, or any other <b>cabin</b> <b>system,</b> the occupants would likely not survive.|$|R

40|$|Design {{requirements}} for the <b>cabin,</b> <b>cabin</b> <b>system,</b> flight controls, engine installation, and wing-fuselage interface that provide adequate interior volume for occupant seating, cabin ingress and egress, and safety are presented. The fuselage structure must be sufficient to meet the loadings specified in the appropriate sections of Federal Aviation Regulation Part 23. The critical structure must provide a safe life of 10 (exp 6) load cycles and 10, 000 operational mission cycles. The cabin seating and controls must provide adjustment to account for various pilot physiques and to aid in maintenance and operation of the aircraft. Seats and doors shall not bind or lockup under normal operation. <b>Cabin</b> <b>systems</b> such as heating and ventilation, electrical, lighting, intercom, and avionics must {{be included in the}} design. The control system will consist of ailerons, elevator, and rudders. The system must provide required deflections with a combination of push rods, bell cranks, pulleys, and linkages. The system will be free from slack and provide smooth operation without binding. Environmental considerations include variations in temperature and atmospheric pressure, protection against sand, dust, rain, humidity, ice, snow, salt/fog atmosphere, wind and gusts, and shock and vibration. The following design goals were set to meet the requirements of the statement of work: safety, performance, manufacturing and cost. To prevent the engine from penetrating the passenger area {{in the event of a}} crash was the primary safety concern. Weight and the fuselage aerodynamics were the primary performance concerns.

40|$|An {{algorithm}} is developed {{to predict the}} thermal response of aircraft ceiling materials during a post-crash fire scenario. The scenario involves an aircraft's emergency exit doorway which opens onto the flames of a fuel-spill fire which engulfs the fuselage. Data of near-ceiling temperatures acquired during full-scale, post-crash test simulations provide indirect validation of the algorithm. The post-crash time-to-ceiling-ignition is proposed {{as a measure of}} cabin fire safety. This measure would be used as a surrogate for the post-crash time avail-able for passengers to safely evacuate the cabin. In this sense, the {{algorithm is}} exercised in an example evaluation of the fire safety of a candidate honeycomb ceiling material used together in <b>cabin</b> <b>systems</b> involving polyurethane cushion seating...|$|R

5000|$|With {{the earlier}} {{introduction}} of the Stratoliner, a second generation of propliners ensued.

40|$|The {{worldwide}} {{stock of}} single-engined aircraft with pressurized cabin is uneconomical, uncomfortable and inefficient because of outdated system technologies. When using composite materials (hand laminate) and new technologies (pressurized <b>cabin,</b> de-icing <b>system</b> and power pack arrangement), {{the efficiency and}} thus the environmental pollution of aircraft will be reduced. Suitable ways have been explored. Through the manufacture of a test pressurized cabin, a PIIP de-icing system and an integrated exhaust system, system technologies have been investigated which had positive results {{in the case of}} pressurized <b>cabin,</b> de-icing <b>system</b> and lightning protection system. The investigation of the integrated exhaust systems showed in this area rather disadvantages than advantages. The use of the positive results will lead to more economic aircraft in future. (orig.)
