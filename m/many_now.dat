As part of this process, Rita Mae Brown and other lesbians who had been active in NOW were forced out. They staged a protest in 1970 at the Second Congress to Unite Women, and earned the support of <b>many</b> <b>NOW</b> members, finally gaining full acceptance in 1971.|$|E
5|$|Before {{the latter}} half of the 18th century, grain, timber and then coal were Plymouth's main imports. During this time the real source of wealth was from the {{neighbouring}} town of Plymouth Dock (renamed in 1824 to Devonport) and the major employer in the entire region was the dockyard. The Three Towns conurbation of Plymouth, Stonehouse and Devonport enjoyed some prosperity during the late 18th and early 19th century and were enriched by a series of neo-classical urban developments designed by London architect John Foulston. Foulston was important for both Devonport and Plymouth and was responsible for several grand public buildings, <b>many</b> <b>now</b> destroyed, including the Athenaeum, the Theatre Royal and Royal Hotel, and much of Union Street.|$|E

5|$|Sherman {{spent two}} months in the {{territory}} and was the primary author of the 1,188-page report filed on conditions there when they returned in April 1856. The report explained what anti-administration members already feared: that the principle of local control was being seriously undermined by the invasion of Missourians who, while not intending to settle there, used violence to coerce the Kansans to elect pro-slavery members to the territorial legislature. The House took no action on the reports, but they were widely distributed as campaign documents. That July, Sherman proposed an amendment to an army appropriation act to bar use of federal troops to enforce the acts of the Kansas territorial legislature, which <b>many</b> <b>now</b> viewed as an illegitimate body. The amendment narrowly passed the House, but was removed by the Senate; the House ultimately agreed to the change. In spite of this defeat, however, Sherman had achieved considerable prominence for a freshman representative.|$|E
5|$|The right panel (220 × 97.5cm, 87 × 38.4in) {{illustrates}} Hell, {{the setting}} {{of a number of}} Bosch paintings. Bosch depicts a world in which humans have succumbed to temptations that lead to evil and reap eternal damnation. The tone of this final panel strikes a harsh contrast to those preceding it. The scene is set at night, and the natural beauty that adorned the earlier panels is noticeably absent. Compared to the warmth of the center panel, the right wing possesses a chilling qualityrendered through cold colourisation and frozen waterwaysand presents a tableau that has shifted from the paradise of the center image to a spectacle of cruel torture and retribution. In a single, densely detailed scene, the viewer is made witness to cities on fire in the background; war, torture chambers, infernal taverns, and demons in the midground; and mutated animals feeding on human flesh in the foreground. The nakedness of the human figures has lost all its eroticism, and <b>many</b> <b>now</b> attempt to cover their genitalia and breasts with their hands.|$|E

The account is characterized by a great deal of literary license and contains references to hell where “great demons threw down lumps of fiery slag from an island with rivers of gold fire” and “great crystal pillars.” <b>Many</b> <b>now</b> believe these to be references to the volcanic activity around Iceland, and to icebergs.|$|E

25|$|This {{area has}} served the {{transport}} trade {{for more than}} a hundred years; most of the stables for New York's remaining horse cabs are located on its side streets, though <b>many</b> <b>now</b> store taxis and pedicabs. It is not uncommon to hear the clip clop of horses in the vicinity, as a result. The carriage horses live in historic stables originally built in the 19th century, but today boast the latest in barn design, such as fans, misting systems, box stalls, and state-of-the-art sprinkler systems. As horses always have in densely populated urban areas, the carriage horses live upstairs in their stables while the carriages are parked below on the ground floor.|$|E
25|$|William Schaw was {{master of}} works to King James VI of Scotland, {{and was also}} the general warden of all the lodges of Scottish stonemasons.

Schaw formalised the working of the lodges in two sets of statutes, set down on 28 December 1598 and 1599. <b>Many</b> <b>now</b> see these as the beginnings of modern Freemasonry.
