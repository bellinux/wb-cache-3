Some special <b>member</b> <b>state</b> <b>territories</b> such as Åland, Livigno and the Canary Islands, are within the EU but outside the EU tax union, and thus still continue duty-free sales for all travelers.|$|R
50|$|There are {{multiple}} Special <b>member</b> <b>state</b> <b>territories,</b> {{some of them}} are not fully covered by the EU treaties and apply EU law only partially, if at all. It is possible for a dependency to change its status regarding the EU and/or some particular treaty or law provision.

5000|$|Europe {{is often}} divided into regions based on geographical, {{cultural}} or historical criteria. Many European structures currently exist, some are cultural, economic, or political - {{examples include the}} Council of Europe, the European Broadcasting Union with the Eurovision Song Contest, and the European Olympic Committees with the European Games.

2500|$|The Reichsmark is the {{dominant}} world currency, and it is legal tender in the Greater German Reich, {{though most of the}} Reich's <b>member</b> <b>states,</b> <b>territories,</b> and allies (including the Empire of Japan, Latin America, Britain, and America) have national currencies. The Reich dictates favorable exchange rates, so the Reichsmark is readily accepted (and, apparently, welcome) even where it is not legal tender. Britain remains using its pre-decimal pound sterling currency, though the five-shilling Crown coin is struck in cheap aluminum, not silver, as [...] "silver" [...] coins were at least partly made of before World War II and briefly after.|$|R

25|$|Several European Union <b>member</b> <b>states</b> have <b>territories</b> which, for historical, geographical, or {{political}} reasons, enjoy special status within {{or outside the}} European Union.

5000|$|Furthermore, the Treaty {{stipulates}} [...] "that the above-named propriety be {{yielded to}} Great Britain without any territorial jurisdiction, {{and without any}} open communication by land with the country round about" [...] (although there is dispute over whether this disclaims territorial jurisdiction over Gibraltar, or over the [...] "country round about") and that no overland trade between Gibraltar and Spain is to take place, except for emergency provisions in the case that Gibraltar is unable to be resupplied by sea. The British Government and the Government of Gibraltar today argue that the membership of both Gibraltar and Spain in the European Union (EU) — Gibraltar was included as a Special <b>member</b> <b>state</b> <b>territory</b> when the United Kingdom joined the EU in 1973; Spain joined the EU in 1986 — supersedes such restrictions as the EU is committed to free movement of goods and services.|$|R
50|$|Additionally the {{autonomous}} and dependent territories, such {{as some of}} the EU <b>member</b> <b>state</b> special <b>territories,</b> are sometimes treated as separate customs territory from their mainland state or have varying arrangements of formal or de facto customs union, common market and currency union (or combinations thereof) with the mainland and in regards to third countries through the trade pacts signed by the mainland state.|$|R
5|$|The {{membership}} of the organization at this time remained largely static. In 1974, {{as a consequence of}} the Turkish invasion of Cyprus, Greece withdrew its forces from NATO's military command structure but, with Turkish cooperation, were readmitted in 1980. The Falklands War between the United Kingdom and Argentina did not result in NATO involvement because article 6 of the North Atlantic Treaty specifies that collective self-defence is only applicable to attacks on <b>member</b> <b>state</b> <b>territories</b> north of the Tropic of Cancer. On 30May 1982, NATO gained a new member when the newly democratic Spain joined the alliance; Spain's membership was confirmed by referendum in 1986. At the peak of the Cold War, 16 member nations maintained an approximate strength of 5,252,800 active military, including as many as 435,000 forward deployed US forces, under a command structure that reached a peak of 78 headquarters, organized into four echelons.|$|R

50|$|WMO has a {{membership}} of 191 <b>Member</b> <b>States</b> and <b>Territories</b> as of February 2014.
