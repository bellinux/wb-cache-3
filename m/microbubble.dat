25|$|An {{echocardiogram}} can, {{within certain}} limits, produce an accurate {{assessment of the}} direction of blood flow and the velocity of blood and cardiac tissue at any arbitrary point using the Doppler effect. One of the limitations is that the ultrasound beam should be as parallel to the blood flow as possible. Velocity measurements allow assessment of cardiac valve areas and function, abnormal communications between {{the left and right}} side of the heart, leaking of blood through the valves (valvular regurgitation), and calculation of the cardiac output. Contrast-enhanced ultrasound using gas-filled <b>microbubble</b> contrast media can be used to improve velocity or other flow-related medical measurements.|$|E
2500|$|Equilibrium {{of forces}} on the surface is {{required}} for a bubble to exist. The sum of the Ambient pressure and pressure due to tissue distortion, exerted {{on the outside of}} the surface, with surface tension of the liquid at the interface between the bubble and the surroundings must be balanced by the pressure on the inside of the bubble. This is the sum of the partial pressures of the gases inside due to the net diffusion of gas to and from the bubble. The force balance on the bubble may be modified by a layer of surface active molecules which can stabilise a <b>microbubble</b> at a size where surface tension on a clean bubble would cause it to collapse rapidly, and this surface layer may vary in permeability, so that if the bubble is sufficiently compressed it may become impermeable to diffusion. If the solvent outside the bubble is saturated or unsaturated, the partial pressure will be less than in the bubble, and the surface tension will be increasing the internal pressure in direct proportion to surface curvature, providing a pressure gradient to increase diffusion out of the bubble, effectively [...] "squeezing the gas out of the bubble", and the smaller the bubble the faster it will get squeezed out. A gas bubble can only grow at constant pressure if the surrounding solvent is sufficiently supersaturated to overcome the surface tension or if the surface layer provides sufficient reaction to overcome surface tension. Clean bubbles that are sufficiently small will collapse due to surface tension if the supersaturation is low. Bubbles with semipermeable surfaces will either stabilise at a specific radius depending on the pressure, the composition of the surface layer, and the supersaturation, or continue to grow indefinitely, if larger than the critical radius. Bubble formation can occur in the blood or other tissues.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: <b>Microbubbles</b> {{are used}} as {{contrast}} enhancing agents in ultrasound sonography and more recently have shown great potential as theranostic agents that enable both diagnostics and therapy. Conventional production methods lead to highly polydisperse <b>microbubbles,</b> which compromise the effectiveness of ultrasound imaging and therapy. Stabilizing <b>microbubbles</b> with surfactant molecules that can impart functionality and properties that are desirable for specific applications would enhance the utility of <b>microbubbles.</b> Here we generate monodisperse <b>microbubbles</b> with a large potential for functionalization by combining a microfluidic method and recombinant protein technology. Our microfluidic device uses an air-actuated membrane valve that enables production of monodisperse <b>microbubbles</b> with narrow size distribution. The size of <b>microbubbles</b> can be precisely tuned by dynamically changing the dimension of the channel using the valve. The <b>microbubbles</b> are stabilized by an amphiphilic protein, oleosin, which provides versatility in controlling the functionalization of <b>microbubbles</b> through recombinant biotechnology. We show that {{it is critical to}} control the composition of the stabilizing agents to enable formation of highly stable and monodisperse <b>microbubbles</b> that are echogenic under ultrasound insonation. Our protein-shelled <b>microbubbles</b> based on the combination of microfluidic generation and recombinant protein technology provide a promising platform for ultrasound-related applications. 1...|$|R

Air-filled <b>microbubbles</b> were produced with phospholipid 1, 2 -distearoyl-sn-glycero- 3 -phosphocholine (DSPC) in the presence or absence of cholesterol and/or polyethylene-glycol distearate (PEG-distearate). <b>Microbubbles</b> were also prepared containing a fluorinated phospholipid, perfluoroalkylated glycerol-phosphatidylcholine, F-GPC shells encompassing perfluorohexane-saturated nitrogen gas. These <b>microbubbles</b> were evaluated in terms of physico-chemical characteristics such as size and stability. In parallel to these studies, DSPC <b>microbubbles</b> were also formulated containing nitrogen (N 2) gas and compared to air-filled <b>microbubbles.</b> By preventing advection, signal drifts were used to assess their stability. DSPC <b>microbubbles</b> were found to have a drift of 20 % signal change per bar of applied pressure in contrast to the F-GPC <b>microbubbles</b> which are considerably more stable with a lower drift of 5 % signal change per bar of applied pressure. By increasing the pressure of the system and monitoring the MR signal intensity, the point at which the majority of the <b>microbubbles</b> have been damaged was determined. For the DSPC <b>microbubbles</b> this occurs at 1. 3 bar whilst the F-GPC <b>microbubbles</b> withstand pressures up to 2. 6 bar. For the comparison between air-filled and N 2 -filled <b>microbubbles,</b> the MRI sensitivity is assessed by cycling the pressure of the system and monitoring the MR signal intensity.

40|$|The {{control of}} the {{physical}} and functional properties of ultrasound responsive <b>microbubbles</b> is of interest because of their potential applications in therapeutic and diagnostic medicine. Crosslinked lysozyme <b>microbubbles,</b> synthesized using high intensity low frequency (20 kHz) ultrasound, possess long-term stability and retain bactericidal property. However, the relatively broader size distribution of these <b>microbubbles</b> may limit their use in some applications. In this article, we introduce a post-sonication technique for modifying the size distribution of lysozyme <b>microbubbles.</b> The post-sonication of these <b>microbubbles</b> at very high ultrasound frequencies (213, 355, 647, and 1056 kHz) led to the selective destruction of <b>microbubbles</b> of certain size range, leading {{to changes in the}} size distribution of <b>microbubbles.</b> An increase in acoustic power (10 W- 60 W) at a fixed frequency (1056 kHz) resulted in a relatively narrow size distribution of the <b>microbubbles.</b> Although the enzymatic activity of <b>microbubbles</b> was reduced by the post-sonication treatment, significant activity was still preserved...|$|R
5000|$|<b>Microbubble</b> shell: {{selection}} of shell material determines how easily the <b>microbubble</b> {{is taken up}} by the immune system. A more hydrophilic material tends to be taken up more easily, which reduces the <b>microbubble</b> residence time in the circulation. This reduces the time available for contrast imaging. The shell material also affects <b>microbubble</b> mechanical elasticity. The more elastic the material, the more acoustic energy it can withstand before bursting.

40|$|Background—We have {{previously}} shown that <b>microbubbles</b> adhere to leukocytes in regions of inflammation. We hypothesized that these <b>microbubbles</b> are phagocytosed by neutrophils and monocytes and remain acoustically active, permitting their detection in inflamed tissue. Methods and Results—In vitro studies were performed in which activated leukocytes were incubated with albumin or lipid <b>microbubbles</b> and observed under microscopy. <b>Microbubbles</b> {{attached to the}} surface of activated neutrophils and monocytes, were phagocytosed, and remained intact for up to 30 minutes. The rate of destruction of the phagocytosed <b>microbubbles</b> on exposure to ultrasound was less (P� 0. 05) than that of free <b>microbubbles</b> at all acoustic pressures applied. Intravital microscopy and simultaneous ultrasound imaging of the cremaster muscle was performed in 6 mice to determine whether phagocytosed <b>microbubbles</b> could be detected in vivo. Fifteen minutes after intravenous injection of fluorescein-labeled <b>microbubbles,</b> when the blood-pool concentration was negligible, the number of phagocytosed/ attached <b>microbubbles</b> within venules was 7 -fold greater in tumor necrosis factor- � (TNF-�) –treated animals than in control animals (P� 0. 01).

40|$|AbstractThe {{nonlinear}} {{property of}} <b>microbubbles</b> {{is important for}} ultrasound contrast imaging.

40|$|In {{the last}} years, {{research}} on ultrasound mediated drug delivery using <b>microbubbles</b> is vastly expanding. While some groups simply mix drugs and <b>microbubbles</b> (co-administration), {{other researchers have}} a major interest in the potential of drug-loaded <b>microbubbles.</b> However, today, little is known on {{the pros and cons}} of these two strategies. In this study we evaluated the delivery of nanoparticles (polystyrene nanospheres and mRNA-lipoplexes) to cells in vitro, in case the nanoparticles were mixed with unloaded <b>microbubbles</b> versus loaded onto the <b>microbubbles.</b> Flow cytometry experiments demonstrated that unloaded <b>microbubbles</b> did not enhance the cellular delivery of the nanospheres and mRNA-lipoplexes.

40|$|Ultrasound {{contrast}} agent <b>microbubbles</b> have gained widespread applications in diagnostic and therapeutic ultrasound. Animal studies of bioeffects induced by ultrasound-activated <b>microbubbles</b> {{have demonstrated that}} <b>microbubbles</b> can cause microvessel damage. Much scientific attention has been attracted to such microvascular bioeffects, {{not only because of}} the related safety concerns, but also because of the potential useful applications of <b>microbubbles</b> in the intravascular delivery of drugs and genetic materials into target tissues. A significant challenge in using <b>microbubbles</b> in medical ultrasound is the lack of knowledge about how the <b>microbubbles</b> behave in blood vessels when exposed to ultrasound and how their interactions with ultrasound cause vascular damage. Although extensive studies were performed in the past to study the dynamics of <b>microbubbles,</b> most of those studies were performed in vitro and did not directly address the clinical environment in which <b>microbubbles</b> are injected into blood vessels. In this thesis work, a synchronized optical-acoustic system was set up for ultra-high speed imaging of insonated <b>microbubbles</b> in microvessels. The recorded images revealed the formation of microjets penetrating the <b>microbubbles,</b> as well as vessel distention (motion outward against the surrounding tissue) and vessel invagination (motion inward toward the lumen) caused by the expansion and collapse of the <b>microbubbles,</b> respectively. Contrary to current paradigms which propose that <b>microbubbles</b> damage vessels either by distending them or by forming liquid jets impinging on them, <b>microbubbles</b> translation and jetting were in the direction away from the nearest vessel wall; furthermore, invagination typically exceeded distention in arterioles and venules. Vessel invagination was found to be associated with vascular damage. These studies suggest that vessel invagination may be a newly discovered potential mechanism for vascular damage by ultrasound-activated <b>microbubbles.</b> The dynamics of bubble-vessel interactions are coupled intimately with the viscoelastic properties of the microvessels. To probe these properties, a method based on the relaxation times of the invaginated microvessels was used to estimate the relaxation time constants of the microvessels. It was found that the time constants were on microsecond time scales, which provided insight into the unique and unknown viscoelastic properties of the microvessels. ...|$|R

In regions of inflammation, contrast agents are captured and phagocytosed by activated neutrophils adherent to the venular wall. Using direct optical observation with a high-speed camera and acoustical interrogation of individual bubbles and cells, we assessed the physical and acoustical responses of both phagocytosed and free <b>microbubbles.</b> Optical analysis of bubble radial oscillations during insonation demonstrated that phagocytosed <b>microbubbles</b> experience viscous damping within the cytoplasm and yet remain acoustically active and capable of large volumetric oscillations during an acoustic pulse. Fitting {{a modified version of}} the Rayleigh-Plesset equation that describes mechanical properties of thin shells to optical radius-time data of oscillating bubbles provided estimates of the apparent viscosity of the intracellular medium. Phagocytosed <b>microbubbles</b> experienced a viscous damping approximately sevenfold greater than free <b>microbubbles.</b> Acoustical comparison between free and phagocytosed <b>microbubbles</b> indicated that phagocytosed <b>microbubbles</b> produce an echo with a higher mean frequency than free <b>microbubbles</b> in response to a rarefaction-first single-cycle pulse. Moreover, this frequency increase is predicted using the modified Rayleigh-Plesset equation.
