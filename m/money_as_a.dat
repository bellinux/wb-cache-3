In viewing <b>money</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> active agent, we obscure the social relationships that actually give money its power. The Columbian peasants, seeking to explain how money could bear interest, turned to folk beliefs like the [...] "baptism of money" [...] to explain how money could grow. Dishonest individuals would have money baptized, which would then become an active agent; whenever used to buy goods, it would escape the till and return to its owner.|$|R
5|$|Two years later, in 1688, in {{response}} to counterfeiting and {{to raise money to}} support the Nine Years' War, Castaing proposed a method of reshaping and restriking existing coins, which was ultimately accepted. Castaing's edge lettering machine was used on the overstruck coins, and the Royal Mint supervisor Martin Masselin, the individual who undertook the process, was obligated to pay Castaing for its use. In 1691, Masselin was dismissed, as he and his clerks were found to have stolen from the Mint during the reformation of the coinage, and Castaing was appointed to perform the edge lettering and restriking in his place. A second reform took place in 1693. Castaing was imprisoned in 1700 on charges of using inaccurate scales to weigh the coins to be reminted; according to his wife, Marie Hippolyte Castaing (née Bosch), the allegations were false, originating from opponents who lost <b>money</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> result of his machine's introduction to the French Mint and the resulting monetary reforms.|$|E

Bowl {{officials}} said 65,463tickets were sold for the game, but many went unused, and that official figure {{was more than}} 9,000 below stadium capacity. The game was televised on ESPN, and the announcers were Mike Tirico, Ron Jaworski, Jon Gruden and Michele Tafoya. An estimated 8.23million viewers watched the broadcast, earning it a Nielsen rating of 7.1. That figure was the second-lowest mark to date for a BCS game. For contributing teams to the Orange Bowl, the Atlantic Coast Conference and Pacific-10 each received {{large amounts of money}} to be divided among their members. Because the Pac-10 had two BCS teams, that conference received $27.2million from the BCS. The ACC, which had only Virginia Tech in a BCS bowl, received $21.2million. In the ACC, Virginia Tech received a somewhat larger share of the <b>money</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> reward for winning the conference: All other ACC teams received $1.1million; Tech got $1.7million. Stanford received a similar amount, but the extra money was offset by the cost of sending 500 players, coaches, and staff to Miami.|$|E
5|$|The Anglo-Saxon kings {{built up}} a set of written laws, issued either as {{statutes}} or codes, but these laws were never written down in their entirety and were always supplemented by an extensive oral tradition of customary law. In {{the early part of}} the period local assemblies called moots were gathered to apply the laws to particular cases; in the 10th century these were replaced by hundred courts, serving local areas, and shire moots dealing with larger regions of the kingdom. Many churchmen and thegns were also given permission by the king to hold their own local courts. The legal system depended on a system of oaths, in which the value of different individuals swearing on behalf of the plaintiff or defendant varied according to their social status - the word of a companion of the king, for example, was worth twelve times that of a churl. If fines were imposed, their size similarly varied accord to the oath-value of the individual.
