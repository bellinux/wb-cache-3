A severe failure of the dam is considered by the Multi-jurisdictional Hazard Mitigation Plan to be the most dangerous threat to Montour County.|$|E
5|$|Tatars {{under the}} {{leadership}} of Kadan experienced a <b>major</b> <b>failure</b> in March 1242 at Klis Fortress, when they were hunting for Béla IV of Hungary. The Tatars believed that the king was in the Klis Fortress, and so they began to attack from all sides, launching arrows and hurling spears. However, the natural defenses of the fortress gave protection, and the Tatars could cause only limited harm. They dismounted from their horses and began to creep up hand over hand to higher ground. But the fortress defenders hurled huge stones at them, and managed to kill a great number. This setback only made the Tatars more ferocious, and they came right up to the great walls and fought hand to hand. They looted the houses in the outskirt of the fortress and took away much plunder, but failed to take Klis altogether. Upon learning that the king was not there, they abandoned their attack, and ascending their mounts rode off in the direction of Trogir, a number of them turning off toward Split.|$|E
5|$|Until 2001, {{participation}} in the festival was limited to a single night. The number of contestants ranged from five to twelve. A two-round system was used intermittently between 1981 and 1998, in which all but five of the contestants were eliminated in a first round of voting. Failure to reach the second round under this system {{was seen as a}} <b>major</b> <b>failure</b> for a prominent artist; when Elisabeth Andreassen failed to qualify in 1984, it almost ended her career. The introduction of weekly semifinals in 2002 increased the number of contestants to thirty-two. At least ten of the contestants must perform in Swedish. A CD of each year's competing songs has been released since 2001, and a DVD of the semifinals and final since 2003.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Glass-reinforced Plastics (GRP) {{has been}} {{considered}} as an alternative material to carbon steel for applications in corrosive environments. The main objective of utilizing GRE pipes is to prevent corrosion and leaks in the pipelines. This increases {{the reliability of the}} system by preventing leaks, and thereby also reducing life cycle costs. However, some premature failures had been found after the application of GRP pipes in oil fields. Such failures as fractures around the joint, wrinkles of the inner layer, and circumferential cracks on the body part of the pipeline are the top three <b>major</b> <b>failures</b> which usually appear in practice. This paper analyzes the main causes of these three <b>major</b> <b>failures</b> and attempts to offer several possible solutions to them...|$|R

It also strengthened the relations between Cuba and the Soviet Union. This {{eventually led to the}} events of the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962. The invasion was a <b>major</b> <b>failure</b> for US foreign policy; Kennedy ordered a number of internal investigations across Latin America. Cuban forces under Castro's leadership clashed directly with US forces during the Invasion of Grenada over 20 years later.|$|E

Designed as a family-oriented mini-pay service, Take 2 was essentially formatted {{as an alternative to}} HBO, without any R-rated program content. The channel was ultimately deemed a <b>major</b> <b>failure</b> due to low subscribership and limited carriage by cable providers, and ceased operations late that summer. HBO management analysized the mistakes that led to Take 2's downfall, which would result {{in the development of the}} network's second and more successful attempt at a secondary pay service, the movie-focused Cinemax, which launched on August 1, 1980.|$|E

The pilot declared an emergency and the aircraft returned to the airport safely on one engine. It was later found that an engine seal had failed, causing catastrophic engine failure and slight damage to the engine cowling and under-wing surface. The subsequent investigation uncovered design and manufacturing defects with the seals and led to the incorporation of new design seals in all future engines.|$|E
25|$|In the {{subsequent}} story, The Edge of Destruction, {{tensions between the}} TARDIS crew reach the point of overt conflict when he accuses them of trying to sabotage the TARDIS {{in an attempt to}} return to 1963. Barbara remains level-headed and logical, allowing the Doctor to trace the source of the distress to telepathic influences from the TARDIS (which is trying to warn them of a <b>major</b> <b>failure).</b> Seeing that Barbara has been hurt by his accusations, the Doctor apologises and begins to realise he can rely on the two teachers, sealing a friendship which lasts until their eventual departure from the TARDIS. Although mutually respectful and increasingly affectionate, the relationship between the Doctor and Barbara is often tested by their opposing viewpoints. In The Aztecs, Barbara is mistaken for the reincarnation of a high priest, Yetaxa, after they find her in possession of his bracelet. Barbara seizes this opportunity to change the course of history, and tries to persuade the Aztecs to abandon human sacrifice, so that by the time Hernán Cortés - who overthrew the Aztec empire - lands he will find a glorious civilisation. The Doctor warns Barbara that she cannot rewrite history, but his protests fall on deaf ears. Barbara fails and, although she has influenced some Aztecs, history remains on course.|$|E

Overall the operation was a <b>major</b> <b>failure.</b> With the large proportion of inexperienced, green pilots, flight coordination was extremely difficult and due to the extreme secrecy many pilots were shot down by their own FlaK antiaircraft, who were not pre-warned of the operation.

Despite winning a tactical victory at Pleasant Hill, Banks continued the retreat to Alexandria, his force rejoining part of Porter's Federal Inland Fleet. That naval force had joined the Red River Campaign to support the army and to take on cotton as a lucrative prize of war. Banks was accused of allowing [...] "hordes" [...] of private cotton speculators to accompany the expedition, but only a few did, and most of the cotton seized was taken by the army or navy. [...] Banks did little, however, to prevent unauthorized agents from working the area. [...] A cooperating land force launched from Little Rock, Arkansas was turned back in the Camden Expedition.|$|E
