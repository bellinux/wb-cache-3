5|$|Before 1932, the Cipher Bureau {{had succeeded}} in solving an earlier Enigma <b>machine</b> <b>that</b> functioned without a plugboard, but had been {{unsuccessful}} with the Enigma I, a new standard German cipher <b>machine</b> <b>that</b> was coming into widespread use. In late October or early November 1932, {{the head of the}} Cipher Bureau's German section, Captain Maksymilian Ciężki, tasked Rejewski to work alone on the German Enigma I machine {{for a couple of hours}} per day; Rejewski was not to tell his colleagues what he was doing.|$|E
5|$|A French fry {{vending machine}} is a vending <b>machine</b> <b>that</b> {{dispenses}} hot French fries, {{also known as}} chips. The first known french fry vending machine was developed circa 1982 by the defunct Precision Fry Foods Pty Ltd. in Australia. A few companies have developed and manufactured French fry vending machines and prototypes. Furthermore, a prototype machine was also developed at Wageningen University in the Netherlands.|$|E
5|$|A pancake {{machine is}} an electrically-powered <b>machine</b> <b>that</b> {{automatically}} produces cooked pancakes. It {{is believed that}} the earliest known pancake machine was invented in the United States in 1928. Several types of pancake machines exist that perform in various manners, for both commercial and home use. Some are fully automatic in operation, while others are semi-automatic. Some companies mass-produce pancake machines, and some have been homemade. The Happy Egg Company constructed a novelty pancake machine in 2013 in commemoration of Pancake Day in the United Kingdom.|$|E

5|$|According to Historian Alexander Mikaberidze, the French Army {{remained}} the finest army of its day {{by a good}} margin. It had been {{the legacy of the}} French King and its fusion with the formations of the French revolution and Napoleon's reforms had transformed it into a military <b>machine</b> <b>that</b> had dominated Europe since 1805. Each corps of the French Army was in fact its own mini-army capable of independent action.|$|E

When he hears of Fauxlivia's pregnancy with his grandchild, Walternate comforts her and offers his complete support for her, believing the child to be another way to bring Peter voluntarily back to the parallel universe.|$|E
5|$|Kilburn and Williams {{concluded}} that computers {{would be used}} more in scientific roles than pure maths, and decided {{to develop a new}} <b>machine</b> <b>that</b> would include a floating point unit. Work began in 1951, and the resulting machine, which ran its first program in May 1954, was known as Meg, or the megacycle machine. It was smaller and simpler than the Mark 1, and much faster for maths problems. Ferranti produced a version of Meg with the Williams tubes replaced by the more reliable core memory, marketed as the Ferranti Mercury.|$|E
5|$|No, if we {{make this}} screen <b>machine</b> <b>that</b> you are asking for, it will spoil everything. We are making these peep show {{machines}} and selling {{a lot of them}} at a good profit. If we put out a screen machine there will be a use for maybe about ten of them in the whole United States. With that many screen machines you could show the pictures to everybody in the country—and then it would be done. Let's not kill the goose that lays the golden egg.|$|E

5|$|After the Cortex Vortex, a {{space station}} owned by Doctor Neo Cortex, is {{destroyed}} by Doctor Nitrus Brio's laser beam device, pieces of the station crash into a tropical mountain. This sets free an entity known as Uka Uka, the mastermind behind Cortex's previous schemes. He derides Cortex for failing to retrieve the crystals and gems, {{both of which are}} vast sources of world energy. However, feeling generous after being freed from prison, Uka Uka recruits Doctor Nefarious Tropy to join him and Cortex in their latest plan. Tropy has created the Time-Twisting Machine, a time <b>machine</b> <b>that</b> allows the villains to travel through time to find more gems and crystals scattered across the timeline.|$|E

5|$|Approximately half of {{all known}} {{antibiotics}} interfere with the workings of a bacteria's ribosome, a large and complex biochemical <b>machine</b> <b>that</b> performs protein biosynthesis by translating messenger RNA into proteins. Macrolide antibiotics clog the ribosome's exit tunnel, preventing synthesis of essential bacterial proteins. In 2007, the Pande lab received a grant to study and design new antibiotics. In 2008, they used Folding@home to study the interior of this tunnel and how specific molecules may affect it. The full structure of the ribosome was determined only as of 2011, and Folding@home has also simulated ribosomal proteins, as many of their functions remain largely unknown.|$|E
5|$|At that point, {{the party}} reunites with Zola, who {{supplies}} a Mechat {{for them to}} pursue Nene. As the party goes after Nene in the Mechat, Nene initiates an ancient <b>machine</b> <b>that</b> splits the world into two hemispheres, with thousands of isolated cubes floating between the halves. The party follows Nene to the Primitive Cube {{at the core of}} the transformation. The party journeys through the cube eventually defeating General Szabo and ultimately engaging Nene. As the party weakens Nene, it is revealed that Zola was working for Nene all along, and she was the voice that told the others to swallow the spheres. When Zola was too weak to defend herself, Nene had given her a shadow and sent her to Jibral as a spy. Zola betrays and kills Nene choosing her friends over him.|$|E
5|$|Banjo-Kazooie {{is set in}} the Spiral Mountain {{and follows}} the story of Banjo, a male brown honey bear, and Kazooie, a female red-crested Breegull who is always kept in Banjo's backpack. The game begins when a foul-tempered witch named Gruntilda learns from her {{cauldron}} Dingpot that Tooty, Banjo's younger sister, is more beautiful than her. Jealous, Gruntilda creates a <b>machine</b> <b>that</b> can transfer a person's level of beauty to another, which she intends to use with Tooty. She then abducts Tooty from Banjo's house while he is sleeping. In response to the kidnapping, Kazooie wakes Banjo up and the two set out to rescue her. Banjo and Kazooie learn from Tooty's friend, Bottles the mole, that she was captured by Gruntilda and suggests they need some training to collect musical notes and jigsaw pieces to progress through Gruntilda's lair. Along the way, they are aided by Mumbo Jumbo, a shaman and Gruntilda's former teacher.|$|E

5|$|During a {{geological}} survey on Surata IV, Commander William Riker (Jonathan Frakes) {{is struck by}} a thorn growing on a motile vine plant. The away team immediately beams back to the Enterprise, where Dr. Katherine Pulaski (Diana Muldaur) finds out that the thorn has released a deadly virus into Riker's body. Within a matter of hours, the virus will reach Riker's brain, killing him. To try to save Riker's life, Pulaski puts him into a <b>machine</b> <b>that</b> will artificially stimulate his brain neurons, keeping them active and resisting the virus. This causes Riker to dream of his past adventures aboard the Enterprise. Riker's first dreams are of reasonably neutral occasions, such as {{his first meeting with}} Lieutenant Commander Data (Brent Spiner). He soon moves on to more passionate and even erotic dreams, such as meeting the cheerful young Edo women on Rubicon III, the matriarch Beata (Karen Montgomery) on Angel One, or the computer-generated holodeck woman Minuet (Carolyn McCormick).|$|E
