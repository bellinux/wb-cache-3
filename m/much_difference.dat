However, unlike the useful firehooks, these large pumps had rarely proved flexible or functional enough to make <b>much</b> <b>difference.</b> Only some of them had wheels; others were mounted on wheelless sleds. They had to be brought a long way, tended to arrive too late, and had limited reach, with spouts but no delivery hoses.|$|E

An oxygen tank explosion nearly resulted {{in the loss of}} the crew, and the moon landing was aborted. It became a joke between Shepard and Lovell, who would offer to give Shepard back the mission each time they bumped into each other. The failure of Apollo 13 delayed Apollo 14 until 1971 so that modifications could be made to the spacecraft. The target of the Apollo 14 mission was switched to the Fra Mauro formation, the intended destination of Apollo 13.|$|E
5|$|I don't see <b>much</b> <b>difference</b> {{between a}} {{communist}} regime and a fascist regime. In fact, I {{think one of}} the greatest intellectual confusions that many have had over these decades is the whole right and left thing -- fascists are on the right, communists are on the left. Nonsense! They come together and overlap, and we're seeing this in Russia today where the allies are the nationalistic chauvinists and the communists. They are natural allies because they are authoritarians by nature. And more than authoritarians, they tend to be totalitarians, which means that they tend to destroy all of the elements of the civil society. To me that's much more important than whether you're philosophically right or left. You know, are you willing to create and live in a civil society, in an open society, or not? That to me is the basic issue.|$|E

5|$|In {{a survey}} {{released}} by the Pew Research Center in April 2007, viewers who watch both The Colbert Report and The Daily Show {{tend to be more}} knowledgeable about news than audiences of other news sources. Approximately 54% of The Colbert Report and The Daily Show viewers scored in the high knowledge range, followed by Jim Lehrer's program at 53% and Bill O'Reilly's program at 51%, significantly higher than the 34% of network morning show viewers. The survey shows that changing news formats have not made <b>much</b> <b>difference</b> on how much the public knows about national and international affairs, but adds that there is no clear connection between news formats and what audiences know. The Project for Excellence in Journalism released a content analysis report suggesting that The Daily Show comes close to providing the complete daily news.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the first}} {{projects}} was to build equipment to transition from the British long-wave radar to the new microwave centimeter-band radar {{made possible by the}} cavity magnetron. In working on the Microwave Early Warning system (MEW), Alvarez invented a linear dipole array antenna that not only suppressed the unwanted side lobes of the radiation field, but also could be electronically scanned without the need for mechanical scanning. This was the first microwave phased-array antenna, and Alvarez used it not only in MEW but in two additional radar systems. The antenna enabled the Eagle precision bombing radar to support precision bombing in bad weather or through clouds. It was completed rather late in the war; although a number of B-29s were equipped with Eagle and it worked well, it came too late to make <b>much</b> <b>difference.</b>|$|E
5|$|Periyar's {{philosophy}} of self-respect {{was based on}} his image of an ideal world and a universally accepted one. His philosophy preaches that human actions {{should be based on}} rational thinking. Further, the outcome of the natural instinct of human beings is to examine every object and every action and even nature with a spirit of inquiry, and to refuse to submit to anything irrational as equivalent to slavery. Thus, the {{philosophy of}} self-respect taught that human actions should be guided by reason, right and wrong should follow from rational thinking and conclusions drawn from reason should be respected under circumstances. Freedom means respect to thoughts and actions considered 'right' by human beings on the basis of 'reason'. There is not <b>much</b> <b>difference</b> between 'freedom' and 'self-respect'.|$|E

5|$|At the {{conclusion}} of the 2009 regular season, Tennessee's offense was the 32nd most successful squad in the nation, scoring an average of 30.58 points per game. In terms of yardage gained, Tennessee was 48th. There wasn't <b>much</b> <b>difference</b> between the success of the rushing offense (43rd) and the passing offense (47th). Tennessee quarterback Jonathan Crompton, after struggling in 2008, improved significantly in 2009, when he passed for 2,565 yards and 26 touchdowns. In 2008, the Volunteers were 11th in the SEC in offense, averaging 145.8 yards per game. In 2009, they were third, averaging 225.6 yards per game. In addition to Crompton, running back Montario Hardesty also improved his performance from 2008 to 2009. In the season leading up to the Chick-fil-A Bowl, he had 1,306 rushing yards, just 158 short of the single-season Tennessee record, and 12 touchdowns. Entering the Chick-fil-A Bowl, Hardesty hoped to match the team's rushing record, but doubted {{he would be able to}} because of past knee injuries that made it difficult to run on artificial turf. Volunteers tight end Luke Stocker, who caught 27 passes for 370 yards and six touchdowns in 2009, was a player Virginia Tech's defense focused on in pregame preparation.|$|E
5|$|Pregame media {{coverage}} of the 2011 Orange Bowl focused on {{the manner in which the}} two teams involved had reversed their fortunes during the 2010 college football season. Stanford had its longest winning streak since 1991 its most wins in history, and was four years removed from a one-win season, while Virginia Tech became the first team in college football history to win 11 consecutive games in a season after losing its first two. The two teams had never played each other, but they shared a common 2010 opponent, Wake Forest. Before the Orange Bowl, Wake Forest head coach Jim Grobe said he didn't see <b>much</b> <b>difference</b> in quality. Another point of conversation was the poor performance of the ACC in nonconference games and Virginia Tech's poor past performance against teams ranked in the top 5. The Hokies had won just one of 27 games against teams in that category. Partially because of this factor, spread bettors favored Stanford by three points when the first odds were released December 10, a margin that various organizations either kept constant or raised to 3.5 points by the day of the game. It was the first time all season the Hokies were point spread underdogs.|$|E

We hypothesized that Liriodendron tulipifera, a species with rapid photosynthetic induction gain and slow induction loss, would have the least limitations to sunfleck photosynthesis relative to the other three species (Acer rubrum, Cornus florida, Liquidambar styraciflua). As a consequence, L. tulipifera shoul...|$|R
40|$|In this work, we have {{investigated}} the release and reduction of NOx (nitrates) stored on Rh–Ba/Al 2 O 3 and Pt–Rh–Ba/Al 2 O 3 catalysts and compared with Pt–Ba/Al 2 O 3.

Accordingly {{the presence of a}} reductant, that keeps the PGM sites in a reduced state by scavenging oxygen adatoms formed upon nitrate decomposition, greatly favors the release of NO and its subsequent reduction. In these steps, not <b>much</b> <b>differences</b> have been observed considering either Pt- or Rh-based samples...|$|R
