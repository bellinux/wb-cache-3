500|$|... "I am very {{grateful}} that <b>my</b> <b>show</b> was so well received {{all over the}} world. But {{there seems to be}} many misinterpretations about my appearance on the cross and I wanted to explain it myself once and for all. There is a segment in <b>my</b> <b>show</b> where three of my dancers 'confess' or share harrowing experiences from their childhood that they ultimately overcame. My 'confession' follows and takes place on a Crucifix that I ultimately come down from. This is not a mocking of the church. It is no different than a person wearing a Cross or 'Taking Up the Cross' as it says in the Bible. My performance is neither anti-Christian, sacrilegious or blasphemous. Rather, it is my plea to the audience to encourage mankind to help one another and to see the world as a unified whole. I believe in my heart that if Jesus were alive today he would be doing the same thing.|$|E

My specific intent is to bring attention to the millions of children in Africa who are dying every day, and are living without care, without medicine and without hope. I am asking people to open their hearts and minds to get involved in whatever way they can. The song ends with a quote from the Bible's Book of Matthew: 'For I was hungry and you gave me food. I was naked and you gave me clothing. I was sick and you took care of me and God replied, [...] "Whatever you did for the least of my brothers... you did it to me.'

500|$|UPN {{requested}} a modified ending to the episode, {{as the original}} version had Phlox and Archer disagreeing {{over what to do}} with the Valakians. Archer would have wanted to save the race, while Phlox would have wanted evolution to take its course. John Billingsley, who played Doctor Phlox in Enterprise, didn't agree with the changed version, saying [...] "the ending that had initially been created I was fairly comfortable with. But the head of the studio suggested some revisions on the ending. What do you do? I wasn't as happy with the revisions, but it's not <b>my</b> <b>show,</b> you have to sort of adjust, even if sometimes it does seem a bit of a contradiction in terms for what your character is supposed to be about." ...|$|E
500|$|In June 2009, West {{announced}} on The View {{he would be}} touring with Gaga, {{but she would not}} perform as an opening act. [...] "She's talented and so incredible that she's not an opening act", he said. [...] "We're doing it together, with no opening act." [...] In August, Gaga expressed her belief that the tour would be [...] "one of the most groundbreaking moments in touring history." [...] Before the singer agreed to collaborate with West, she demanded that the tour would remain accessible to her gay fans. [...] "I'm gay", she recalled telling West in an interview with Out magazine, [...] "my music is gay. <b>My</b> <b>show</b> is gay. And I love that it's gay. And I love my gay fans and they're all going to be coming to our show. And it's going to remain gay." ...|$|E
500|$|... "I am so {{mental and}} sleepless and excited for this tour, [...] This is so {{different}} than anything you've seen from me in the past year. What's fantastic about [...] was I was able to plan it while I was on another tour that was on a much smaller scale, opening for the Dolls. This is going to be, like, the ultimate creative orgasm for me 'cause I'm ready to move on. I'm not restricted to a certain structure for <b>my</b> <b>show</b> anymore. No limitations. I'm free. [...] I {{want to have a}} clear schedule of the dimensions for each venue so that we can properly execute all the technology and visuals. I need to mentally prepare days in advance if {{things are going to be}} taken out; otherwise, I won't have a good show...Every show's gonna be an A show by the time I'm done screaming at everyone– 'Hang it! Hang everything! Find a place to hang it!' That's gonna be my motto." ...|$|E

500|$|Kesha was {{inspired}} to write the song after continual rejection from the protagonist in the song, Stephen, who refused to call the singer. She told MTV [...] "I wrote [...] about this guy that I've been stalking since I was, like, 15, but he's a total loser, so I don't want to glorify him in any way, but I'm really excited for the song." [...] In February 2010, {{after the release of}} the song, Stephen attended one of the singer's concerts. Speaking to Total Access on 96.4FM The Wave, the singer recalled the experience saying [...] "he came to see <b>my</b> <b>show</b> at this huge gay bar in New York and it was totally off the chain. He gets up on stage, takes all his clothes off except his underwear and starts making out with a tranny. I was like, 'Wait a minute, have I been barking up the wrong genre of tree?'" ...|$|E
500|$|... "It's {{not really}} a tour, it's more of a {{traveling}} party. I {{want it to be}} an entire experience from [...] minute you walk in [...] front door to [...] minute I begin to sing. And when it's all over, everyone's going to press rewind and relive it again. [...] It's going to be as if you're walking into New York circa 1974: There's an art installation in the lobby, a DJ spinning your favorite records in the main room, and then the most haunting performance that you've ever seen on the stage. [...] I'm on the phone every minute of every day, talking to people, being creative, planning this Ball, and my tour manager is constantly saying, 'Come on, we have to go, we've got to go right now,' [...] But to me, the Ball is so important. I want so much to make every depression dollar that everyone spends on <b>my</b> <b>show</b> worth it. And, yeah, I'm paying a lot for it— out of my own pocket. But that's OK. I just don't care about money." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Circus" [...] {{was written}} by Dr. Luke, Benny Blanco and Claude Kelly, while {{produced}} by Luke and Blanco. Luke and Kelly were initially commissioned {{to work on a}} new track for Spears, and entered the studio with no concept prepared, as Kelly explained, [...] "just knowing her style and knowing what she does." [...] After Luke came up with the music, they based the song on the public's perception of her life at the time. Spears explained that after listening to [...] "Circus" [...] for the first time, she felt inspired and imagined a story behind it. She also stated, [...] " [...] put the whole album together as far as what I wanted <b>my</b> <b>show</b> to be like. You can play with a circus in so many different ways". [...] "Circus" [...] was recorded at Conway Recording Studios and Chalice Recording Studios in Los Angeles, California, and at Glenwood Place Studio in Burbank, California. Background vocals were provided by Cathy Dennis, Kelly and Myah Marie. Main instrumentation was done by Luke and Blanco. The song was mixed by Serban Ghenea at MixStar Studios in Virginia. [...] "Circus" [...] was announced on October 31, 2008, as the second single from the album, and was officially serviced to American radio stations on December 2, 2008.|$|E

500|$|At the {{conclusion}} of the presidential election, the image of McCain was removed from the video. During her performance at Petco Park, Madonna [...] congratulated Barack Obama, on his historic win for presidency of the United States. Madonna stated, [...] "This is a historical evening. This is a motherfucking important evening and we are lucky to be sharing it with the World [...] This {{is the beginning of a}} whole new world. Are you ready?! Are you fucking ready?!" [...] The video screens displayed images of Obama along with the message, [...] "We Won". Madonna also publicly voiced her opposition for Republican Vice Presidential candidate for 2008, Sarah Palin. While performing on the tour, Madonna shouted [...] "Sarah Palin can't come to my party. Sarah Palin can't come to <b>my</b> <b>show.</b> It's nothing personal. [...] Here's the sound of Sarah Palin's husband's snowmobile when it won't start. (followed by a loud screeching noise)." [...] While performing [...] "I Love New York" [...] during the request section, the line [...] "Get off my street" [...] was replaced by Madonna screaming [...] "You know who can get off of my street? Sarah Palin! I'm gonna kick her ass if she don't get off of my street." [...] Then she mocked Palin's accent and told the crowd that she loves her.|$|E
500|$|Spears's manager Adam Leber {{responded in}} his Twitter account, saying, [...] "It's unfortunate that one {{journalist}} in Perth didn't enjoy the show last night. Fortunately the other 18,272 fans in attendance did". Spears's official website also posted {{a list of}} positive reviews {{from a number of}} fans. Burswood Dome also issued a statament reading, [...] "Last night's concert (Friday) saw record crowds turn out for her first performance in Perth and from Burswood's perspective the event was a huge success. Early media reports that hundreds of fans left the concert early cannot be substantiated and Burswood has received no complaints about the concert". Finally, Spears addressed the situation according to BBC Online. She was quoted as saying, [...] "I hear {{there is a lot of}} controversy in the media about <b>my</b> <b>show.</b> Some reporters have said they love it and some don't. I came to Australia for my fans". The negative media attention continued after her show in Melbourne when it was alleged that fans had placed tickets for the remaining Australian shows on sale on the online shopping website eBay, for as little as 99 cents. However, Dainty said that the holders of the tickets were not Spears's fans, stating [...] "They're just profiteers. They buy tickets for $200 and think they that when the concerts sell-out they will offload them for $500".|$|E
500|$|The {{song was}} also {{added to the}} six song set list of the Hard Candy Promo Tour in 2008. Madonna wore a shiny black outfit with black tails, Adidas track pants and high-heeled, lace-up boots. [...] "Hung Up" [...] was the fourth song of the set list. It was re-invented as a heavy-metal version. As the {{performance}} of [...] "4 Minutes" [...] ended, Madonna picked up an electric guitar and played the first few chords of The Rolling Stones single [...] "(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction". She then asked the crowd whether {{they thought they had}} come to a Rolling Stones concert. When the crowd responded negatively, she started [...] "Hung Up", while dedicating it to all the people who had waited outside in the queue to watch the show. She declared that the noisy, metallic guitar breakdown of the song symbolised what waiting sounded like in the brain of all those who had waited. The song was performed in the futuristic rave with Japanese influences segment of the 2008 Sticky & Sweet Tour. Madonna wore a futuristic robotic outfit designed by Heatherette, with plates on her shoulder and a wig with long curled hair. The similar heavy-metal version of [...] "Hung Up" [...] was performed but it later gave way to the ABBA music. Before starting the performance, she played a capella versions of her older hit songs on audience demand, mostly [...] "Express Yourself" [...] and [...] "Like a Virgin". However, after that, the electric guitar was played to make noises, which Madonna dedicated to Republican vice-presidential nominee for the 2008 election, Sarah Palin. She said, [...] "I'd like to express myself to Sarah Palin right now. [...] This is the sound of Sarah Palin thinking. [...] Sarah Palin can't come to my party. Sarah Palin can't come to <b>my</b> <b>show.</b> It's nothing personal." [...] The performance ended with Madonna playing the guitar riff of [...] "A New Level" [...] by heavy-metal band Pantera. For the second European leg of the tour in 2009, [...] "Hung Up" [...] was removed from the setlist and was replaced by an up-beat version of [...] "Frozen".|$|E

2500|$|On September 5, 2008, the Drudge Report {{reported}} that Oprah staffers were [...] "sharply {{divided on the}} merits of booking Sarah Palin". Drudge said that he obtained the information from an anonymous source. Winfrey responded in a written statement to news outlets saying, [...] "The item in today’s Drudge Report is categorically untrue. There has been absolutely no discussion about having Sarah Palin on <b>my</b> <b>show.</b> At the beginning of this presidential campaign when I decided that I was going to take my first public stance in support of a candidate, I made the decision not to use <b>my</b> <b>show</b> as a platform for any of the candidates." [...] Oprah Winfrey's public statement came after she had already endorsed Barack Obama for president on Larry King Live in 2007. Drudge was accused by some commentators of planting a false story for political ends.|$|E

That's what I think happened...I just happen to know the facts...I'm not trying to get Amanda Knox's first interview because… <b>my</b> <b>show</b> does not pay for interviews...Second, I don't think she's going to tell the truth anyway, so what's the point?" ...|$|E

[...] Cramer revealed trepidation to Martha Stewart about his upcoming appearance that night: [...] "I'm a little nervous... How bad is it gonna be? Is he gonna kill me?" [...] Cramer continued that he had previously idolized Jon Stewart: [...] "The reason why it's been so hard for me, the attacks, is that early on I patterned <b>my</b> <b>show</b> off of his, which {{is that you can}} do an entertainment business show. And then suddenly to be attacked by a guy that's your idol makes it difficult." ...|$|E

At the 2000 Edinburgh Festival Fringe, the cast members of the television series were performing a special reading of dialog that featured their characters. When the producers found out that Miller was also at the festival, they invited him to a cast party. There he met The Simpsons creator Matt Groening, who had previously seen a video of MacHomer. According to Miller, [...] "next thing I knew, Matt Groening was shaking my hand, was giving me his blessing and was telling me he'd do all he could to help me continue <b>my</b> <b>show.</b> It's the best situation I could have dreamed of. No one is suing me, or asking for royalties, either." ...|$|E
