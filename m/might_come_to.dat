5|$|When Tsar Nicholas II of Russia, George's {{first cousin}} (their mothers were sisters), was overthrown in the Russian Revolution of 1917, the British {{government}} offered political asylum to the Tsar and his family, but worsening {{conditions for the}} British people, and fears that revolution <b>might</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> the British Isles, led George {{to think that the}} presence of the Romanovs would be seen as inappropriate. Despite the later claims of Lord Mountbatten of Burma that Prime Minister Lloyd George was opposed to the rescue of the Russian imperial family, the letters of Lord Stamfordham suggest that it was GeorgeV who opposed the idea against the advice of the government. Advanced planning for a rescue was undertaken by MI1, a branch of the British secret service, but because of the strengthening position of the Bolshevik revolutionaries and wider difficulties with the conduct of the war, the plan was never put into operation. The Tsar and his immediate family remained in Russia, where they were murdered by Bolsheviks in 1918. The following year, Nicholas's mother (George's aunt) Maria Feodorovna (Dagmar of Denmark) {{and other members of the}} extended Russian imperial family were rescued from the Crimea by a British warship.|$|E

60|$|Martin's soul grew quite sad. There {{were very}} good reasons {{to believe that this}} dear girl might sail away from Bridgetown, and from him. She <b>might</b> <b>come</b> back <b>to</b> the town, but she <b>might</b> not <b>come</b> back <b>to</b> him.|$|R

25|$|In this verse, {{the narrator}} {{states that he}} wishes God perform these various acts so that all might know that God is the most {{powerful}} entity and has sway over all the Earth. This verse, with verse 16, indicates that, although the bulk of the psalm is a prayer for the destruction of the enemies of Israel, there is some positive hope that the enemies of Israel <b>might</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> acknowledge the god of Israel.|$|E
25|$|Hershiser {{signed a}} one-year $3.45 million {{contract}} with the San Francisco Giants on December 7, 1997. He made 34 starts and was 11–10 with a 4.41 ERA in 1998. The contract contained an option for 1999 but the Giants declined the option after the season. At the time they said they <b>might</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> terms on a new deal. Instead he signed a minor league contract with the Indians on February 20, 1999.|$|E
25|$|The {{focus of}} the books is the trends through which a civilization might progress, {{specifically}} seeking to analyze their progress, using history as a precedent. Although many science fiction novels such as Nineteen Eighty-Four or Fahrenheit 451 do this, their focus is upon how current trends in society <b>might</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> fruition, and act as a moral allegory on the modern world. The Foundation series, on the other hand, looks at the trends in a wider scope, dealing with societal evolution and adaptation rather than the human and cultural qualities {{at one point in}} time.|$|E

25|$|The Druidic temple: A conical stone {{structure}} {{just east}} of the road south of the reservoir was said to be a site where local Druids practiced their rituals, and horrible things <b>might</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> pass for any intruder who looked too closely or came at the wrong time. The building is actually an iron smelter left over from the American Revolutionary War and the War of 1812 when the United States was forced into creating an economic independence to complement its political freedom. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places as Clinton Furnace in 1976. It is currently fenced off by the Newark water department to prevent any entrance and the liability for injury that might result.|$|E
25|$|If {{enough people}} do not think like free-riders, the private and {{voluntary}} provision of public goods may be successful. For example, a free rider <b>might</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> a public park to enjoy its beauty, yet discard litter that makes it less enjoyable for others. More public-spirited individuals don't do this (they might even pick up existing litter) – why? There could be several reasons. Perhaps they have lived nearby for years and derive pleasure from helping their community, or at least would feel ashamed if their neighbors or friends saw them. Perhaps they are emotionally attached to the environment, or the park is a national treasure; littering it would offend their patriotism. To the extent that most people behave like this (for any reason), a public good is produced: everyone enjoys a clean park, without the government needing to spend tax money on maintenance crews.|$|E
500|$|Yamamoto felt {{deception}} {{would be}} required to lure the U.S. fleet into a fatally compromised situation. To this end, he dispersed his forces so that their full extent (particularly his battleships) would be concealed from the Americans prior to battle. Critically, Yamamoto's supporting battleships and cruisers trailed Vice Admiral Chūichi Nagumo's carrier force by several hundred miles. They were intended to come up and destroy whatever elements of the U.S. fleet <b>might</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> Midway's defense once Nagumo's carriers had weakened them sufficiently for a daylight gun battle;. (This tactic was typical of the battle doctrine of most major navies at the time.) ...|$|E

500|$|Blythe summarises the marchers' {{anger and}} disillusionment: [...] "And that was that. The result of three months' excited {{preparation}} and one month's march {{has led to}} a few minutes of flaccid argument during which the Government speakers had hardly mustered enough energy to roll to their feet". A [...] "stay-in" [...] strike was briefly proposed, before Wilkinson arranged a meeting with a cross-party group of MPs. The marchers' case was heard sympathetically; the meeting was warned that, given international uncertainties, they <b>might</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> regret the dismantling of an important shipbuilding facility for reasons of private profit. Such statements, according to Wilkinson, made members [...] "distinctly uncomfortable". [...] The next day the marchers returned by train to Jarrow, where they received an ecstatic welcome from the town.|$|E
500|$|Thrale {{explains}} that her {{book is not}} for [...] "diary-keeping in the strict sense" [...] when she writes: [...] "It is many Years since Doctor Samuel Johnson advised {{me to get a}} little Book, and write in it all the little Anecdotes which <b>might</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> my Knowledge, all the Observations I might make or hear; all the Verses never likely to be published, and in fine ev'ry thing which struck me at the Time. Mr Thrale has now treated me with a Repository, - and provided it with the pompous Title of Thraliana; I must endeavour to fill it with Nonsense new and old." [...] These encouraging remarks from Johnson set the theme of the work as it became a new [...] "Johnsoniana" [...] collection. In particular, she transferred her previous notes and documentations about Johnson's life into the collection.|$|E
500|$|At {{the start}} of the game, Junpei wakes up in a cabin inside a cruise liner, wearing a {{bracelet}} displaying the number [...] "5". He escapes the room, and encounters eight people, including June. Zero announces over a loudspeaker that all nine are participants in the Nonary Game. Zero explains the rules, and states each carry an explosive in their stomach that will go off if they try to bypass the digital root door locks. The 9th Man still goes through a door by himself, and is killed. Fearing what harm <b>might</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> them, the group adopts code names, and splits up to explore the ship. The player has the option to select which group that Junpei travels with, which affects the story; several choices lead to Junpei's death. Through various choices, Junpei learns of a previous Nonary Game, played nine years earlier, and the connections of the other characters through that, as well as studies about morphic resonance and stories of the Egyptian priestess Alice, who is frozen in ice-9.|$|E

6000|$|She {{turned away}} her face further from him, {{and the look}} of it became even more sullen. Could it be {{possible}} that at such a moment she still had a hope that he <b>might</b> <b>come</b> back <b>to</b> her? ...|$|R

500|$|The final book {{describes}} {{what he considers}} to be the true Church and its ministry, authority, and sacraments. He denied the papal claim to primacy and the accusation that the reformers were schismatic. For Calvin, the Church {{was defined as the}} body of believers who placed Christ at its head. By definition, there was only one [...] "catholic" [...] or [...] "universal" [...] Church. Hence, he argued that the reformers [...] "had to leave them in order that we <b>might</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> Christ." [...] The ministers of the Church are described from a passage from Ephesians, and they consisted of apostles, prophets, evangelists, pastors, and doctors. Calvin regarded the first three offices as temporary, limited in their existence to the time of the New Testament. The latter two offices were established in the church in Geneva. Although Calvin respected the work of the ecumenical councils, he considered them to be subject to God's Word found in scripture. He also believed that the civil and church authorities were separate and should not interfere with each other.|$|E
2500|$|Tolkien himself {{might have}} {{disagreed}} with an allegorical interpretation. He wrote, in Letter 131 of The Letters of J. R. R. Tolkien, [...] "I dislike Allegory". In specific reference to Niggle, {{he wrote in}} Letter 241, [...] "It is not really or properly an 'allegory' so much as 'mythical'." [...] On the other hand, in Letter 153 he said, [...] "I tried to show allegorically how [...] <b>might</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> be taken up into Creation in some plane in my 'purgatorial' story Leaf by Niggle." ...|$|E
2500|$|Meir {{approved}} {{full scale}} mobilizing but sided with Dayan against a preemptive strike, citing Israel's need for foreign aid. She believed that Israel could {{not depend on}} European countries to supply Israel with military equipment, and the only country that <b>might</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> Israel's assistance was the United States. Fearing that the United States would be wary of intervening if Israel were perceived as initiating the hostilities, Meir decided early on October 6 against a preemptive strike. She made it a priority to inform Washington of her decision. U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger later confirmed Meir's assessment by stating that if Israel had launched a preemptive strike, Israel would not have received [...] "so much as a nail".|$|E

2500|$|On the ITV {{television}} series, Poirot died in October 1949 from {{complications of}} a heart condition {{at the end of}} [...] In Christie's novels, he lived into the late 1960s, perhaps even until 1975 when Curtain was published. In both the novel and the television adaptation, he had moved his amyl nitrite pills out of his own reach, possibly because of guilt. He thereby became the murderer in Curtain, although it was for the benefit of others. Poirot himself noted that he wanted to kill his victim shortly before his own death so that he could avoid succumbing to the arrogance of the murderer, concerned that he <b>might</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> view himself as entitled to kill those whom he deemed necessary to eliminate.|$|E
2500|$|Rabbi Meïr's attempt, however, {{seems to}} have led Judah I to fear that the Babylonian exilarch <b>might</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> the land of Israel to claim the office from Hillel's descendant. He {{discussed}} the subject with the Babylonian scholar Hiyya, a prominent member of his school , saying that he would pay due honor to the exilarch should the latter come, but {{that he would not}} renounce the office of nasi in his favor [...] When the body of the exilarch Huna, who was the first incumbent of that office explicitly mentioned as such in Talmudic literature, was brought to the land of Israel during the time of Judah I, Hiyya drew upon himself Judah's deep resentment by announcing the fact to him with the words [...] "Huna is here" [...] (Yerushalmi Kilayim 32b).|$|E
2500|$|In December 1948, the Egyptian {{government}} {{released a}} decree ordering {{the dissolution of}} the Society. [...] The police had discovered caches of bombs and other weapons accumulated by the secret apparatus, and though the Brothers insisted that these were for use in the Arab-Israeli war, the government suspected that the Brothers were planning revolution; it was also keen to remove what it saw as one of the main causes of the general political unrest that had become increasingly violent, and increasingly threatening to its authority, {{since the end of the}} Second World War. [...] Moreover, because the Brotherhood had its own hospitals, factories and schools, as well as an army in the form of the secret apparatus, the government saw it as a potential parallel state, which Egyptians <b>might</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> see as more legitimate than the official one.|$|E
5000|$|On July 30, 2010, Ella Pamfilova, Medvedev's human right's advisor, {{resigned}} over comments she made, {{saying that}} Nashi activists had [...] "pawned their souls to the devil" [...] {{and that she}} [...] "feared they <b>might</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> power one day", causing Nashi to sue for libel. The Russian opposition commented, claiming that Nashi assaulted and intimidated its leaders.|$|R
