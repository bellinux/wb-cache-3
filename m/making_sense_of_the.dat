25|$|In 1974, Tamiaki Yoneya {{discovered}} {{that all the}} known string theories included a massless spin-two particle that obeyed the correct Ward identities to be a graviton. John Schwarz and Joel Scherk came {{to the same conclusion}} and made the bold leap to suggest that string theory was a theory of gravity, not a theory of hadrons. They reintroduced Kaluza–Klein theory as a way of <b>making</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> extra dimensions. At the same time, quantum chromodynamics was recognized as the correct theory of hadrons, shifting the attention of physicists and apparently leaving the bootstrap program in the dustbin of history.|$|E
25|$|Decollectivization {{increased}} the {{options available to}} individual households and made household heads increasingly responsible for the economic success of their households. In 1987, for example, it was legally possible to leave the village and move into a nearby town {{to work in a}} small factory, open a noodle stand, or set up a machine repair business. Farmers, however, still could not legally move into medium-sized or large cities. The Chinese press reported an increased appreciation in the countryside for education and an increased desire for agriculturally oriented newspapers and journals, as well as clearly written manuals on such profitable trades as rabbit-raising and beekeeping. As specialization and division of labor increased, along with increasingly visible differences in income and living standards, it became more difficult to encompass most of the rural population in a few large categories. During the early 1980s, the pace of economic and social change in rural China was rapid, and the people caught up in the change had difficulty <b>making</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> process.|$|E
500|$|In {{his review}} of The Simpsons: The Complete Twelfth Season DVD box set, Colin Jacobson of DVD Movie Guide praised the episode. He wrote that, unlike other episodes in the season, [...] "The Great Money Caper" [...] did not [...] "rely on too many gimmicks" [...] and {{therefore}} felt more realistic, even though he does not consider grifting an [...] "everyday activity." [...] He concluded his review by writing that the episode [...] "does well for itself." [...] Jason Bailey of DVD Talk described the episode as {{being one of the}} season's highlights. On the other hand, Matt Haigh of Den of Geek cited [...] "The Great Money Caper" [...] as one of the worst episodes of the season, as well as the whole series. In his review, Haigh criticized the Simpsons writers for not <b>making</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> story, and denounced the episode's ending for being [...] "abrupt". He described the episode as [...] "a bad stain on an otherwise great franchise".|$|E

500|$|Critics {{consider}} García Márquez's book {{in terms}} of the historical novel, but differ over whether the label is appropriate. In his review of The General in his Labyrinth, Selden Rodman hesitated to call it a novel, since it was so heavily researched, giving Bolívar's views [...] "on everything from life and love to his chronic constipation and dislike of tobacco smoke". On the other hand, reviewer Robert Adams suggested that García Márquez had [...] "improved on history". According to critic Donald L. Shaw, The General in His Labyrinth is a [...] "New Historical Novel", a genre that he argues crosses between Boom, Post-Boom, and Postmodernist fiction in Latin American literature: [...] "New Historical Novels tend either to retell historical events from an unconventional perspective, but one which preserves their intelligibility, or to question the very possibility of <b>making</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> past at all." [...] Shaw believes that this novel belongs to the first category. García Márquez is presenting both a historical account and his own interpretation of events.|$|E
500|$|Briggs and Whittington started {{experimenting with}} cladistics in 1980 to 1981 and the results, while full of uncertainties, {{convinced}} them that cladistics offered reasonable prospects of <b>making</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Burgess Shale animals. Other fossil beds discovered since 1980 – some rather small and others rivalling the Burgess Shale – have also produced similar collections of fossils, {{and show that}} the types of animals they represent lived in seas all over the world. It appears {{that most of the}} major animal lineages had arisen before the time of the Burgess Shale, and before that of the Chengjiang and Sirius Passet lagerstätten about 15million years earlier, in which very similar fossils are found, and that the Cambrian explosion was complete by then. In the 1990s it was suggested that some Ediacaran fossils from , just {{before the start of the}} Cambrian, may have been primitive bilaterians, and one, Kimberella, may have been a primitive mollusc. By 1996, with new fossil discoveries filling in some of the gaps in the [...] "family tree", some Burgess Shale [...] "weird wonders" [...] such as Hallucinogenia and Opabinia were seen as stem members of a total group that included arthropods and some other living phyla.|$|E
500|$|... "The End" [...] {{received}} mixed {{to positive}} reviews from critics. Lon Grahnke of Chicago Sun-Times reacted positively towards the episode, describing it as [...] "pivotal". Paula Vitaris from Cinefantastique gave the episode a positive review and awarded it three stars out of four. She {{wrote that the}} episode [...] "is an effective, sometimes even moving, conclusion to a scattershot season." [...] Vitaris wrote that the entry was [...] "far superior" [...] to the season four season finale [...] "Gethsemane" [...] and praised the various character introductions, most notably that of Gibson Praise and Diana Fowley. She did, however, criticize the reappearance of Krycek {{and the fact that}} The Smoking Man was again working for the Syndicate. Critical Myth reviewer John Keegan gave the episode a 9 out 10 rating and wrote that, [...] "Overall, this episode was a very good season finale, <b>making</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> season’s character arcs while setting the stage for the feature film. While the effect was somewhat mitigated {{by the fact that the}} episode also had to set up situations for the sixth season, it highlights Cancer Man’s strategic strengths in a way that previous episodes didn’t fully exploit." [...] In a 2000 review of season five for the New Straits Times, Francis Dass called [...] "The End" [...] a [...] "gem" [...] and praised the acting of Jeff Gulka, noting that he was a [...] "great child actor".|$|E

500|$|Prior to {{creating}} Rain World, Joar Jakobsson was a graphic designer in Sweden who taught himself how to animate sprites. He had played few games {{and had little}} industry experience when development began in 2011. He began with a sketch of an elongated cat, which was named [...] "Slugcat" [...] {{by one of his}} YouTube viewers, though the character has no official name. Jakobsson had previous interest in derelict environments, and what they reveal about the humans who previously occupied them. Partly inspired by his feelings of foreignness while living as an exchange student in Seoul, South Korea, a core idea in the game's development was to recreate the life of [...] "the rat in Manhattan". This rat understands how to find food, hide, and live in the subway, but does not understand the subway's structuring purpose or why it was built. Jakobsson and his development partner, James Primate, hoped that players would similarly feel as if they were close to <b>making</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> game's abstraction of an industrial environment without fully understanding. Jakobsson designed Rain World enemies to live their own lives, in which they hunt for food and struggle to survive, rather than serve as obstacles for the player. Enemy placements are randomly generated, and in final playtests a week prior to release, the developers noted how some players became more or less interested in the game based on the luck of their enemy spawns. The developers expected players to learn to avoid combat and play the game primarily through stealth and flight.|$|E

2500|$|After {{a two-year}} break which saw Faith No More split, Mr. Bungle reconvened in 1998 to record new material. The band's third album, California, was {{released}} on July 13, 1999. Ground and Sky reviews have described California as Mr. Bungle's most accessible and, while the genre shifts are still present, they are less frequent, with succinct song formats resulting in an album that The Associated Press called [...] "surprisingly linear". AllMusic described the record as [...] "their most concise album to date; and while the song structures are far from traditional, they're edging more in that direction, and that greatly helps the listener in <b>making</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> often random-sounding juxtapositions of musical genres". On the different style of this album, Mike Patton explained that to the band [...] "the record is pop-y", before adding [...] "but to some fucking No Doubt fan in Ohio, they're not going to swallow that." [...] The album was generally well received, with music critic Robert Everett-Green stating, [...] "The band's newest and greatest album does not reveal itself quickly, but once the bug bites, there is no cure.

2500|$|The [...] "Allegory" [...] segment {{began with}} a recitation of a verse from Nobel Prize-winning Greek poet George Seferis' poem [...] "Mythistorema 3". As the verse is being recited on the speakers, the {{spotlights}} are focused upon a woman clad in a black gown looking out to the water. Holding a marble sculpture head, the woman seems to be entering into a dream. As she looks into the dark water, a centaur appears whose human and animal parts supposedly symbolize the duality of spirit and body. The centaur then walks about and then throws a spear of light {{into the center of}} the stadium, from which a giant statue that exemplified Cycladic art (and thus one of the first depictions of the human form in Greek art) emerged. This Cycladic head also represents one of the very first attempts of humanity to understand itself. With the use of lasers, geometrical shapes and other scientific images (such as a stylistic representation of the solar system) were displayed on the figure's face. The statue then broke into pieces that floated away, and from within it emerged a smaller kouros statue from the Archaic Period of Greek sculpture, which in turn broke apart to reveal the depiction of man in a sculpture of the classical period, symbolizing the dawn of individuality and extolling human scale, one of the principal themes of the 2004 Olympics. At the end of this sequence, a cube arises from the water, and a man starts slowly balancing himself on the rotating cube while representations of human kind's greatest achievements, contrasted to humanistic representations and images of men, women, and children of various ethnicities and ages, are projected onto the pieces of broken sculpture, which seem to be floating above the water. This last sequence is meant to symbolize the birth of logical thought, higher learning, and humanity finally <b>making</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> world in which it lives. After this sequence, the pieces of sculpture descend to the water, meant to symbolize the Greek isles.|$|E
