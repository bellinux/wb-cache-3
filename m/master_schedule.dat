40|$|Aggregate {{planning}} and <b>master</b> <b>scheduling</b> are two important levels of a hierarchical production planning process. They {{serve as the}} front end of production and operations {{planning and}} control systems. It is imperative to have the front end well planned and coordinated. In this study, we demonstrate that a rolling horizon feedback procedure can be an effective coordination mechanism for interfacing aggregate planning and <b>master</b> <b>scheduling.</b> Each time the schedule is rolled ahead, the feedback of performance results from <b>master</b> <b>scheduling</b> provides the aggregate planning subsystem useful information for improving its planning activities. Our experiments show that {{there are at least three}} factors that make a rolling horizon procedure attractive: (i) the use of a horizon with a fractional portion of a seasonal cycle, (ii) high smoothing costs, and (iii) high setup costs. Using rolling horizons reduces the total aggregate costs in these situations relative to not using rolling horizons. The potential impacts of the rolling-horizon strategy are greater under some circumstances than others. ...|$|R

This phenomenon is mainly caused by demand uncertainty and is propagated by decision rules at the different stages of the supply chain.

In particular, Sales and Operations Planning (S&OP) is the first level which consider demand in the planning process while <b>Master</b> <b>scheduling</b> allows to get item production schedules.

40|$|Hierarchical planning, {{scheduling}} and control in flexible manufacturing systems (FMS) provide a systematic way to effectively allocate resources along different time horizons. This paper describes {{the design and}} development of an intelligent hierarchical control model based on a proposed tool management method. The control model consists of four levels: the process plan selection, the <b>master</b> <b>scheduling,</b> the job sequencing and the control level.

The concept behind Foxnet served as the basis for The WB 100+ Station Group (launched in September 1998 as the cable-only feed of The WB) and The CW Plus (the immediate successor of The WB 100+, which launched in September 2006 as a cable-only/digital multicast feed of The CW), which both allow the customization of localized branding (which Foxnet did not allow its cable partners to do) in addition to allowing affiliates to sell local advertising.|$|E
50|$|Ion's current {{method of}} running predominately {{syndicated}} programming {{is very similar}} to the international model of broadcasting used in Europe, Canada, Latin America, Asia and Australia, which mixes imported and syndicated shows with original programming - a model used only in United States broadcast television by digital multicast services (particularly those that specialize in acquired programs such as MeTV), smaller English language entertainment-based networks (such as America One) and networks broadcasting in languages other than English (such as Univision and Telemundo). The major commercial broadcast networks in the U.S. - ABC, NBC, CBS, Fox and The CW - carry first-run programs produced for the network, while leaving the responsibility of acquiring shows from the syndication market to their owned-and-operated stations and affiliates to fill time not allotted to network and, where applicable, locally produced programs (MyNetworkTV, which is somewhat similar to Ion Television in its format, mixes elements of both models as acquired programs are supplied both during prime time by the service and by its stations at all other times). A limited number of non-Ion-owned stations that are merely affiliated with the network (such as Louisville outlet WBNA) do carry additional local or syndicated programming that, in some instances, pre-empts certain programs within the Ion <b>master</b> <b>schedule.</b>|$|E
