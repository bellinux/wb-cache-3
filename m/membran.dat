The Berg Violin Concerto he even recorded twice, under the baton of Dimitri Mitropoulos.

40|$|The {{duct system}} of the rabbit parotid gland {{constitutes}} about 5 % of gland tissue volume and is divisible into intercalated and striated ducts in a volumetric ratio of about 3 : 2. The intercalated duct consists of low cuboidal epithelial cells (375 micrometer 2) surrounded by a myoepithlium, and the cells contain a few small secretion granules, particularly at the proximal end of the duct. The cells of the striated duct are larger (531 micrometer 3), columnal in shape, and show a mitochondrial compartment three times that of intercalated duct cells (16. 5 % of cell volume). These mitochondria are concentrated in a basal and perinuclear position, but they are largely absent from the apical cytoplasm, which is permeated with microfilaments and contains numerous small smooth <b>membraned</b> vesicles, but no clearly recognisable secretion granules. The lateral plasmalemma of these cells is complexly folded, and basal processes interdigitate with those of adjacent cells. This results {{in an increase in}} the ratio of apical to lateral/basal plasmalemma from 1 : 5 in intercalated cells to 1 : 24 in striated cells. Some slight changes in cell morphology were detected following isoprenaline-induced secretion of the gland in vivo. These included a small increase in the volume fraction of nuclei and mitochondria in intercalated duct cells, and depletion of their secretion granules. Change in striated cells was confirmed to a small increase in the volume of smooth <b>membraned</b> cytoplasmic vesicles.

40|$|Two {{distinct}} {{interactions of}} Pomerons should occur in dense multi-string events. Besides the usual triple Pomeron processes transitions to <b>membraned</b> cylinders {{can be expected}} to contribute in a significant way. They offer an efficient mechanism for central baryon production and for the long range transport of initial baryons. The slope of such an exchange should be quite low as it is related to the Odderon known from the leading logarithmic approximation. Such a flat trajectory has to be suppressed by small coupling constants. It is argued that this strong suppression does not appear in diffractive events. In consequence there should be a tiny observable backward peak in the initial baryon distribution even in quite massive diffractive systems.

Based on these findings, technical solutions have been developped on a laboratory and pilot plant scale {{in order to avoid}} and exploit paint sludges containing paint solvents, water paint sludges, two-component varnish sludges and polluted solvents. Concerning paint sludges, it was necessary to apply separate processes for both flotating and sedimentary coagulates. In order to recycle polyols, a method has been developped for two-component varnishes. Considering water paints, practicabilities of ultrafiltration in dependence on paint formulation, types of <b>membrans</b> and modulus have been tested.

40|$|Recent {{studies in}} erythroid cells {{have shown that}} {{autophagy}} is an important process for the physiological clearance of mitochondria during terminal differentiation. However, autophagy also {{plays an important role}} in removing damaged and dysfunctional mitochondria. Defective mitochondria and impaired erythroid maturation are important characteristics of low-risk myelodysplasia. In this study we therefore questioned whether the autophagic clearance of mitochondria might be altered in erythroblasts from patients with refractory anemia (RA, n = 3) and RA with ringed sideroblasts (RARS, n = 6). Ultrastructurally, abnormal and iron-laden mitochondria were abundant, especially in RARS patients. A large proportion (52 +/- 16 %) of immature and mature myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) erythroblasts contained cytoplasmic vacuoles, partly double <b>membraned</b> and positive for lysosomal marker LAMP- 2 and mitochondrial markers, findings compatible with autophagic removal of dysfunctional mitochondria. In healthy controls only mature erythroblasts comprised these vacuoles (12 +/- 3 %).

40|$|Abstract Background The plasma {{membrane}} scavenger receptor, SR-BI, mediates the 'selective uptake' {{process by which}} cholesteryl esters (CE) from exogenously supplied HDL are taken up by target cells. Recent work suggests that dimer and higher order oligomeric forms of the SR-BI protein are important to this process. SR-BI {{has been shown to}} be particularly associated with microvilli and microvillar channels found at the cell surface of steroidogenic cells, and a study with the hormone stimulated adrenal gland has shown impressive changes in the size and complexity of the microvillar compartment as the mass of CE uptake (and accompanying steroidogenesis) fluctuates. In the present study, we examine a cell line in which we overexpress the SR-BI protein to determine if morphological, biochemical and functional events associated with SR-BI in a controlled cell system are similar to those observed in the intact mammalian adrenal which is responsive to systemic factors. Methods Y 1 -BS 1 mouse adrenocortical cells were transiently transfected using rat SR-BI-pcDNA 6 -V 5 -His, rat SR-BI-pcDNA 6 -cMyc-His or control pcDNA 6 -V 5 -His vector construct using a CaPO 4 precipitation technique. Twenty four hours after transfection, cells were treated with, or without, Bt 2 cAMP, and SR-BI expression, CE uptake, and steroidogenesis was measured. SR-BI dimerization and cell surface architectural changes were assessed using immunoelectron microscopic techniques. Results Overexpression of the scavenger receptor protein, SR-BI, in Y 1 -BS 1 cells results in major alterations in cell surface architecture designed to increase uptake of HDL supplied-CEs. Changes include 1 the formation of crater-like erosions of the surface with multiple double <b>membraned</b> channel structures lining the craters, and 2 dimerized formations of SR-BI lining the newly formed craters and associated double <b>membraned</b> channels. Conclusion These data show that overexpression of the scavenger receptor protein, SR-BI (accompanied by suitable hormone treatment and lipoproteins) in susceptible mammalian cells – is associated with increased cholesterol uptake and SR-BI dimerization within a much enlarged and architecturally complex microvillar compartment. These changes duplicate the structural, biochemical and functional changes related to the uptake of HDL CEs normally signaled by the action of ACTH on intact adrenal tissue. </p...|$|R

It is necessary to distinguish between long and short diabetes duration: concluding the mean blood glucose from glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA 1 c) for long-term diabetes has to follow in a different way as for short-term diabetes.
