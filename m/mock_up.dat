5|$|Various gliders {{are seen}} in the film and the protagonist, Nausicaä, uses a jet-assisted one-person glider-shaped machine with folding wings. According to the {{accompanying}} film book released in Japan, the glider is called , the German word meaning gull. An official scale model lists it as having an approximate wingspan of 5.8 meters (1/20 model measured to be 29cm), while the design notes indicate it has a mass of only 12kg. In 2004, the Japanese-led OpenSky Aircraft Project began attempts to build a real-life, working personal jet glider based on the glider from the film. Two full-size gliders with no power source carrying the code name M01 and M02, with a half-sized jet-powered remote controlled <b>mock</b> <b>up</b> called moewe 1/2 was built. The designer and tester of the project refused the official endorsement of the project by Studio Ghibli and Hayao Miyazaki, noting {{that he did not}} want to cause trouble for them if an accident occurred. A jet powered version (registration number JX0122) was finally able to take off under its own power for the first time on 3 September 2013.|$|E
25|$|The Mark IV DP845 first flew on 27 November 1941. It had the full-span C wing {{combined}} with a small tail unit and retractable tailwheel, and also had external bracket hinges under the wings, denoting the installation of braking flaps. These were soon removed and a <b>mock</b> <b>up</b> of a proposed six-cannon armament was fitted, three in each wing. The aircraft was soon renamed Mk XX, to avoid confusion with a renamed PR type, then it became the Mk XII.|$|E
25|$|Airbus {{suggested}} Boeing's use of {{composite materials}} for the 787 fuselage was premature, and that the new A350 XWB was to feature large carbon fibre panels for the main fuselage skin. After facing criticism for maintenance costs, Airbus confirmed in early September 2007 the adoption of composite fuselage frames for the aircraft structure. The composite frames would feature aluminium strips to ensure the electrical continuity of the fuselage (for dissipating lightning strikes). Airbus will use a full <b>mock</b> <b>up</b> fuselage to develop the wiring, a different approach from the A380, on which the wiring was all done on computers.|$|E

25|$|The trams are 33 metres {{long and}} 2.65 metres wide, have {{anti-slip}} flooring, are air-conditioned, have automatic audio-visual announcements and a passenger capacity of 210. A two-thirds <b>mock</b> <b>up,</b> produced for design input, was unveiled on 24 August 2011 and {{was displayed at}} the 2011 Royal Melbourne Show. Although originally anticipated to be delivered in 2012, design complexity slowed down construction, delaying delivery of the first tram. The first E-class tram arrived at Yarra Trams' Preston Workshops on 28 June. In September 2013, there were two E-class trams at Preston Workshops undergoing non-passenger testing in preparation for introduction to service in late 2013. The first two trams entered service on 4 November 2013, and were joined by a further three {{at the start of}} 2014.|$|E
25|$|During the 1993 Waco Siege of the Branch Davidians, {{elements}} of the Alabama and Texas Army National Guard were called in to assist the ATF and the follow on effort by the Federal Bureau of Investigation; the National Guard's involvement was limited to several specific areas; surveillance and reconnaissance, transport, maintenance and repairs, training and instruction, helicopters, unarmed tactical ground vehicles. The Army National Guard helicopters were also used to do photographic reconnaissance work. Training for ATF agents included such subjects as Close Quarters Combat, and combat medical instruction, and a <b>mock</b> <b>up</b> of the Mount Carmel complex was constructed at Fort Hood, Texas for rehearsals. ATF also received several surplus helmets, flack vests, canteens, first aid dressings, empty magazines, and some night-vision equipment, in addition to MREs and diesel fuel. The FBI would request and receive the use of Bradley Armored Fighting Vehicles, and tank retrieval vehicles, as well as overflights by UH-1 and CH-47 helicopters.|$|E
500|$|Star Fox Command was {{developed}} by Q-Games and directed by its founder, Dylan Cuthbert, who previously served as a lead programmer on Star Fox and Star Fox 2. Q-Games {{was working on a}} puzzle game called Digidrive for Nintendo when they were approached to do a <b>mock</b> <b>up</b> of the game demo. After three months, using the original Star Fox, it [...] was shown to Takaya Imamura at Nintendo who said that the company would redesign it for better compatibility with the Nintendo DS and add some ideas from Star Fox 2. Nintendo EAD was responsible for the music and production of the game, while Q-Games handled the main development.|$|E

500|$|Agni's Philosophy is a tech demo {{created by}} Square Enix {{to show off}} the {{capacities}} of Luminous Studio. The demo was a collaboration between the cinematic Visual Works division—a section of the company generally associated with CGI movie production for the company's video games—and Square Enix's R department, Advanced Technology Division, with a goal to create a real-time graphics tech demo that has a quality coming {{as close as possible to}} pre-rendered CGI. Development of the demo took approximately half a year. Unlike previous technology demos created by the company, which were based on pre-existing games, Square Enix decided to create something completely original. The demo was themed around the Final Fantasy series: during discussions, the team asked the question [...] "What is Final Fantasy?", broke down its basic components and used them, along with added unusual elements, in the demo. A focus during the demo's development was the creation of Agni, the central character. For the demo, as it was a work-in-progress, they optimized it for graphical performance. While the story and themes were created by the Japanese staff, many of the character designs were done by staff from their western subsidiaries. The technology to create the demo was all sourced from then-existing high-end PCs. An initial <b>mock</b> <b>up</b> of Agni's hair was created using a mannequin and wig styled by a professional make-up artist. Each character's face was constructed around mo-capped footage of live actors, then tweaked and expanded in post-production. The entire development process, from conception through development, took approximately a year. Agni's Philosophy was first shown at E3 2012 as part of a special presentation by Square Enix. As part of the presentation, guest speakers paused the demo and adjusted elements of the characters on the fly {{to show off the}} engine's customization features. It was also shown at SIGGRAPH 2012.|$|E
2500|$|Opened in 1991, the Africa Rainforest exhibit covers [...] and {{was built}} {{at a cost}} of $4.3 million. In {{addition}} to animals, the exhibit includes artwork and the Kongo Ranger Station, a <b>mock</b> <b>up</b> of a safari expedition. Animals in the exhibit include Rodriguez fruit bats, straw-colored fruit bats, Egyptian fruit bats, colobus monkeys, Allen's swamp monkey, hadada ibis, white-faced whistling ducks, slender-snouted crocodile, Nile monitor lizard, lungfish, cichlids, lesser flamingos, geckos, chameleons, African crested porcupines, African clawed frogs, and hooded vultures. The rainforest includes four main areas: the Bamba Du Jon Swamp, which houses the lungfish, cichlids, frogs and reptiles; the rainforest aviary, which houses the birds; the monkey habitat which houses the monkeys and chameleon; and the bat habitat.|$|E
2500|$|In 2007 a BBC {{documentary}} on Scientology by reporter John Sweeney came under scrutiny by Scientologists. Sweeney alleged that [...] "While making our BBC Panorama film Scientology and Me I have been shouted at, spied on, had my hotel invaded at midnight, denounced as a 'bigot' by star Scientologists, brain-washed—that {{is how it}} felt to me—in a <b>mock</b> <b>up</b> of a Nazi-style torture chamber and chased round the streets of Los Angeles by sinister strangers". This resulted in a video being distributed by Scientologists of a shouting match between Sweeney and Scientology spokesman Tommy Davis. The church has reportedly released a DVD that accuses the BBC of organising a demonstration outside a Scientology office in London, during which [...] "terrorist death threats" [...] were made against Scientologists. The BBC described the allegations as [...] "clearly laughable and utter nonsense". Sandy Smith, the BBC programme's producer, commented that the church of Scientology has [...] "no way of dealing with any kind of criticism at all".|$|E

2500|$|In August 2009, {{when asked}} {{if there would be}} a patch to add Trophies to the game, Kojima Productions' Sean Eyestone asked people to [...] "stay patient". This led to {{speculation}} that an updated version of the game in the vein of Substance or Subsistance would be released alongside a Trophy patch. In November 2010, an updated Greatest Hits box art of the game was released, which in the top right hand corner boasted the addition of [...] "Trophies" [...] to the game. This was later reported as a [...] "typo", and removed from later printings. False reports of an [...] "incoming Trophy Patch" [...] often appeared, usually on internet forums and on April Fools' Day, some even going to the extent of a <b>mock</b> <b>up</b> Trophy listing. In July 2012, a patch was announced which would include Trophies for the game, which would later be released on August 6, 2012. In addition to the support for Trophies, the patch also allowed a full install of the game on to the hard drive to remove the installs between acts.|$|E
2500|$|There was an {{exhibition}} about building research, town planning and architecture, the [...] "Live architecture" [...] exhibit of buildings, open spaces and {{streets in the}} Lansbury Estate, Poplar (named after the former Labour Party leader George Lansbury. Plans for social housing in the area had commenced in 1943. [...] By {{the end of the}} war nearly a quarter of the buildings in the area had been destroyed or badly damaged. In 1948, the Architecture Council decided that the Poplar site would make a good exhibition partly because it was near to the other Festival exhibitions. Despite funding problems, work began in December 1949 and by May 1950 was well advanced. The wet winter of 1950–51 delayed work, but the first houses were completed and occupied by February 1951. [...] The exhibition opened on 3 May 1951 along with the other Festival exhibitions. Visitors first went to the Building Research Pavilion, which displayed housing problems and their solutions, then to the Town Planning Pavilion, a large, red-and-white striped tent. [...] The Town Planning Pavilion demonstrated the principles of town planning and the urgent need for new towns, including a <b>mock</b> <b>up</b> of an imaginary town called [...] "Avoncaster". Visitors then saw the buildings of the Lansbury Estate. Attendance was disappointing, only 86,426 people visiting, compared to 8 million who visited the South Bank exhibition. Reaction to the development by industry professionals was lukewarm, some criticising its small scale [...] Subsequent local authorities concentrated on high rise, high density social housing rather than the Lansbury estate model. The estate remains popular with residents. [...] Among the remaining 1951 buildings are Trinity Independent Chapel, and The Festival Inn and Festive Briton (now Callaghans) pubs.|$|E
