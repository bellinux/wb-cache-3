6000|$|... 1188. The {{apparatus}} used may {{be described}} in general terms as consisting of two metallic spheres of unequal diameter, placed, the smaller within the larger, and concentric with it; the interval between the two being the space through which the induction was to take place. A section of it is given (Plate VII. fig. 104.) {{on a scale of}} one-half: a, a are the two halves of a brass sphere, with an air-tight joint at b, like that of the Magdeburg hemispheres, made perfectly flush and smooth inside so as to present no irregularity; c is a connecting piece by which the apparatus is joined to a good stop-cock d, which is itself attached either to the <b>metallic</b> <b>foot</b> e, or to an air-pump. The aperture within the hemisphere at f is very small: g is a brass collar fitted to the upper hemisphere, through which the shell-lac support of the inner ball and its stem passes; h is the inner ball, also of brass; it screws on to a brass stem i, terminated above by a brass ball B, l, l is a mass of shell-lac, moulded carefully on to i, and serving both to support and insulate it and its balls h, B. The shell-lac stem l is fitted into the socket g, by a little ordinary resinous cement, more fusible than shell-lac, applied at mm {{in such a way as}} to give sufficient strength and render the apparatus air-tight there, yet leave as much as possible of the lower part of the shell-lac stem untouched, as an insulation between the ball h and the surrounding sphere a, a. The ball h has a small aperture at n, so that when the apparatus is exhausted of one gas and filled with another, the ball h may itself also be exhausted and filled, that no variation of the gas in the interval o may occur during the course of an experiment.|$|E
40|$|A new {{optical sensor}} for the {{continuous}} {{monitoring of the}} dew formation inside organ pipes was designed. This aspect is particularly critical {{for the conservation of}} organs in unheated churches since the dew formation or the condensation on the pipe surfaces can contribute to many kinds of physical and chemical disruptive mechanisms. The working principle is based on the change in the reflectivity which is observed {{on the surface of the}} fibre tip, when a water layer is formed on its distal end. Intensity changes of the order of 35 % were measured, following the formation of the water layer on the distal end of a 400 / 430 [*]μm optical fibre. Long-term tests carried out placing the fibre tip inside the base of an in-house-made <b>metallic</b> <b>foot</b> of an organ pipe located in an external environment revealed the consistency of the proposed system...|$|E
30|$|The {{temperature}} difference, however, {{is still}} too high for practical applications, and the future studies will aim at lowering the required temperature. One of the possible {{ways to reduce the}} temperature difference is to improve the fixation of the bimetal sheet for better contact with the feet. Since the heat in the bimetal is dissipated to the <b>metallic</b> <b>feet,</b> better contact between the bimetal and the feet will help the heat dissipation and reduce the requirement for the temperature difference. Or, amplifying the body swing by using a mechanical resonance would be also effective to decrease the requirement. If the difference between the required temperature and the ambient temperature can be smaller than, e.g., 30 [*]°C, the walker would be able to walk on a hot ground during summer time.|$|R
