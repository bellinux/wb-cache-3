5000|$|The novel {{revolves}} around movie actress Suzanne Vale {{as she tries}} to put her life together after a drug overdose. The book is divided into five main sections:The prologue is in epistolary form, with postcards written by Suzanne to her brother, friend, and grandmother.The novel continues the epistolary form, consisting of first-person narrative excerpts from a journal Suzanne kept while coming to terms with her drug addiction and rehab experiences. ("Maybe I shouldn't have given the guy who pumped my stomach <b>my</b> <b>phone</b> <b>number,</b> but who cares? My life is over anyway.") In time Suzanne's entries begin to alternate with the experiences of Alex, another addict in the same clinic. This section ends with Suzanne being discharged after successfully completing treatment.The second section opens with dialogue between Suzanne and film producer Jack Burroughs on their first date. It then changes to alternating monologues from Suzanne (addressed to her therapist) and Jack (addressed to his lawyer, who serves much the same purpose as Suzanne's therapist). Their relationship continues in this vein - all dialogue/monologue.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the transformation of}} an industrial complex in the post-industrial city. I chose two study cases for research. Zollverein is an industrial complex and a World Heritage Site located {{in the city of}} Essen which is the 2010 European Capital of Culture. “ 798 ” art gallery in Beijing represents a clear example of the cultural movement, since 1990, for the renewal of art in China. (Greco and Santoro 2008) And this new cultural complex was created in what was once an industrial area. Through comparing the two areas Zollverein Coal Mine Industrial Complex in Essen and “ 798 ” art gallery in Beijing, I aim to highlight and discuss the similarities and differences of the process of transformation from an industrial area to a post-industrial one. After that, I can analyze some of the strengths, weakness, opportunities and threats from these two examples. Based on the conclusions drawn from the two cases, I will make a proposal for the reconstruction of Nanjing Jinsanli Rubber & Plastic Co., Ltd. I gave the new name “RUBBER SOUL” to this place. My design proposal for this area will bring the knowledge from the study-case analysis into practice. <b>My</b> <b>phone</b> <b>number</b> is 1377665701...|$|E
40|$|The problem {{about the}} {{vibration}} of vehicles and bridge is mainly {{the problem of}} coupling vibration between the vehicles dynamic system and bridge dynamic system. The vehicles running on the bridge at some speed can make the bridge vibrate, {{at the same time}} the vibration of the bridge will also affect the vibration of the vehicles. This problem with interaction and mutual effects is the problem of coupling vibration between vehicles and bridge. Because its close relation to practical application it is paid extensive attention by more and more people. In this thesis we construct the kinetic model of the bridge subsystem and the vehicle subsystem separately. Then according to the Euler–Bernoulli beam theory, mode superposition method and D’Alambert principle we get the functions of the two models. In addition we refer to the relationship of the geometric on the contact point and the static equilibrium conditions to construct the relation between the equation of the vehicle vibration and the equation of bridge vibration. Finally we use MATLAB to write the code according to the Newmark-beta method to handle the coupled equation.
