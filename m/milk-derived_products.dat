50|$|The term dairy {{came into}} common usage in New Zealand English to {{describe}} small shops {{by the late}} 1930s. Perishables such as milk and eggs were formerly delivered to city households from a dairy farm; by the late 1930s, small shops stocked such produce, and the term shifted to describe these shops. In addition to this meaning, New Zealand English retains the common meanings of dairy, referring to milk, <b>milk-derived</b> <b>products</b> and associated industries.|$|E
50|$|Yersinia is a genus of {{bacteria}} in the family Yersiniaceae. Yersinia species are Gram-negative, rod-shaped (bacillus) bacteria, a few micrometers long and fractions of a micrometer in diameter, and are facultative anaerobes. Some members of Yersinia are pathogenic in humans; in particular, Y. pestis is the causative agent of the plague. Rodents are the natural reservoirs of Yersinia; less frequently, other mammals serve as the host. Infection may occur either through blood (in the case of Y. pestis) or in an alimentary fashion, occasionally via consumption of food products (especially vegetables, <b>milk-derived</b> <b>products,</b> and meat) contaminated with infected urine or feces.|$|E

30|$|Dairy {{products}} play {{an important}} role in human food. Hence, their quality is of significant concern for consumers, governmental control authorities, and manufacturers. One of the most nutrient dairy products is whey. Whey or milk serum contains a large amount of required body nutrition, including about 4.5  % (weight over volume, or w/v) lactose, 0.8  % (w/v) protein, 1  % (w/v) salt, and 0.1 – 0.8  % (w/v) lactic acid. Whey is transparent, yellowish–green and has a slight tart flavor (Grba et al. 2002). During the production of cheese, milk curdles and subsequently coagulates. Through this process, the hard part (casein) and the liquid part (whey) separate from each other, such that the liquid part includes nearly half of the milk solid ingredients (Keramat et al. 2007). In the process of producing one kilogram of cheese, about eight kilograms of whey are obtained. Although whey constitutes a considerable portion, since its nutrition facts are not well-known, it is wasted as wastewater (Estrella et al. 2004). Therefore, it must be the focus of more studies (Farkhondeh 1980). In fact, whey is significantly rich in terms of lactose, minerals, vitamins and protein (Glass and Hedrick 1976). The importance of lactase enzyme and introducing new sources of lactose is even more pronounced, when taken into consideration the large population suffering from lactose intolerance problem. Lactose intolerance, also called lactase deficiency and hypolactasia, is the inability to digest lactose, a sugar found in milk and to a lesser extent <b>milk-derived</b> dairy <b>products.</b> Lactose intolerant individuals have insufficient levels of lactase, an enzyme that catalyzes hydrolysis of lactose into glucose and galactose, in their digestive system (NDDIC 2011).|$|R

The efficiency of free and encapsulated BLS P 34 {{to control the}} development of L.  monocytogenes and maintenance of antimicrobial activity was assessed over time in milk. The antimicrobial activity of free and encapsulated BLS P 34 decreased approximately 50 % after 4 days of storage (< 4  °C) in skim and whole milk. After this period there was not significant loss of activity up to 21 days. The viable counts of Listeria monocytogenes in skim and whole milk containing 3200  AU/ml of free or encapsulated BLS P 34 were always lower than those observed in controls without bacteriocin at both 30  °C and 7  °C. At 1600  AU/ml concentration, free and encapsulated BLS P 34 were inhibitory to L.  monocytogenes in skim milk, {{when compared with the}} control at 7 days.

40|$|Considerable evidences, mainly {{derived from}} {{epidemiological}} studies, but also supported by few intervention trials, confirm {{the role of}} breakfast {{as part of a}} healthful and balanced diet, and suggest that its benefits may be partly immediate and partly mediated by the macro and micro nutrients supplied with this meal. The regular consumption of breakfast providing about 15 - 20 % of the daily caloric intake is associated with a higher likelihood to reach the recommendeddietary levels of some micronutrients and with a reduced risk of developing obesity, cardiovascular events, and diabetes, possibly by controlling some of their risk factors. Children and adolescents who regularly have breakfast also exhibit short-term improvement in school performance. Grain-derived products such as bread, biscuits,toast bread and ready-to-eat breakfast cereals should provide the major proportion of carbohydrates. Milk and <b>milk-derived</b> <b>products</b> - within a balanced breakfast - represent the main sources of proteins, lipids, and some micronutrients.

40|$|The {{introduction}} of Listeria monocytogenes {{into the food}} production chain is a concern, with numerous grouped cases of listeriosis associated with <b>milk-derived</b> or pork-derived <b>products</b> have been documented. Management of this zoonotic pathogen considers all strains as an equal risk. Recently, a new perspective for characterisation of strain virulence was introduced {{with the discovery of}} the unaltered sequence of InlA as a determinant of strain virulence; this has also been reported as an infrequent finding among so-called environmental strains, that is, strains isolated from food or from surfaces in food industries. The aim {{of this study was to}} differentiate L monocytogenes strains isolated from animal cases versus those from human cases and to differentiate clinical strains from environmental ones using a Caenorhabditis elegans virulence testing model. In Quebec in 2013 / 2014, the surveillance of L monocytogenes clinical isolates registered a total of 20 strains of animal origin and 16 pulsed-field gel electrophoresis types isolated from human cases. The mixed PCR multiplex agglutination protocol used for geno-serotyping clearly discriminated genogroup IVB strains from bovine and human origins. The presence of a premature stop codon single nucleotide polymorphism in the inlA gene sequence in clinical strains and the identical behaviour of particular strains in the C elegans model are discussed in this paper from the perspective of industrial management of L monocytogenes risk...|$|R

40|$|Milk {{was a very}} {{significant}} food product in the Mediterranean. The present study is not devoted to milk as such, but to therapeutic galactology, galaktologia iatrike (γαλακτολογία ἰατρική), a version of which is extant in De medicina penned by a Roman encyclopaedist called Celsus. The author places milk and <b>milk-derived</b> <b>products</b> among therapeutic substances, indicates the methods of processing such substances, and also provides the readers with details on dietary and pharmacological characteristics of dairy foods as well as indicating their place {{in a number of}} cures.

This is a clear sign that milk was considered to be significant from the medical point of view and was as such very interesting both for the medical profession and for general public. Therefore De medicina appears as a typical work, and details contained in it are simply a testimony of the evolution of the doctrine that was already present in De Diaeta I–IV and later developed by the most prominent physicians...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: Iron is {{essential}} for development and growth in young children; unfortunately, iron deficiency (ID) is a significant public health problem in this population. Young Child Formulae (YCF), <b>milk-derived</b> <b>products</b> fortified with iron and ascorbic acid (AA, an enhancer of iron absorption) may be good sources of iron to help prevent ID. Furthermore, some YCF are supplemented with prebiotics, non-digestible carbohydrates suggested to enhance iron bioavailability. The aim of our study was to evaluate iron bioavailability of YCF relative to prebiotic and AA concentrations. We hypothesised that YCF with {{the highest levels of}} prebiotics and AA would have the most bioavail- able iron. Methods: We used the in vitro digestion/Caco- 2 cell model to measure iron bioavailability from 4 commercially available YCF with approximately equal amounts of iron, but varying amounts of: AA and the prebiotics fructo-and galacto-oligosaccharides. Caco- 2 cell ferritin formation was used as a surrogate marker for iron bioavailability. Results: The YCF with the highest concentration of prebiotics and AA had the highest iron bioavailability; conversely, the YCF with the lowest concentration of prebiotics and AA had the lowest. After the addition of exogenous prebi-otics, so that all tested YCF had equivalent amounts, there was no longer a significant difference between YCF iron bioavailability. Conclusion: Our results suggest that ascorbic acid and prebiotics in YCF improve iron bioavailability. Ensuring that iron is delivered in a bioavailable form would improve the nutritional benefits of YCF in relation to ID/IDA amongst young children; therefore, further exploration of our findings in vivo is warranted...|$|E
40|$|Clinical {{trials are}} reviewed, {{involving}} proteins and peptides derived from milk (predominantly bovine), {{with the exception}} of lactoferrin, which will be the subject of another article. The most explored milk fraction is α-lactalbumin (LA), which is often applied with glycomacropeptide (GMP) – a casein degradation product. These milk constituents are used in health-promoting infant and adult formulae as well as in a modified form (HAMLET) to treat cancer. Lactoperoxidase (LCP) is used as an additive to mouth hygiene products and as a salivary substitute. Casein derivatives are applied, in addition, in the dry mouth syndrome. On the other hand, casein hydrolysates, containing active tripeptides, found application in hypertension and in type 2 diabetes. Lysozyme is routinely used for food conservation and in pharmaceutical products. It was successfully used in premature infants with concomitant diseases to improve health parameters. When used as prophylaxis in patients with scheduled surgery, it significantly reduced the incidence of hepatitis resulting from blood transfusion. Lysozyme was also used in infected children as an antimicrobial agent showing synergistic effects in combination with different antibiotics. Proline-rich polypeptide (PRP) was introduced to therapy of Alzheimer’s disease patients. The therapeutic value of PRP was proved in several clinical trials and supported by studies on its mechanism of action. Concentrated immunoglobulin preparations from colostrum and milk of hyperimmunized cows showed efficacy in prevention of infections by bacteria, viruses and protozoa. A nutrition formula with milk-derived TGF-β 2 (Modulen IBD®) found application in treatment of pediatric Crohn’s disease. In conclusion, the preparations containing <b>milk-derived</b> <b>products</b> are safe and effective measures in prevention and treatment of infections as well as autoimmune and neoplastic diseases...|$|E
40|$|Humans {{learned to}} exploit {{ruminants}} {{as a source}} of milk about 10, 000 years ago. Since then, the use of domesticated ruminants {{as a source of}} milk and dairy products has expanded until today when the dairy industry {{has become one of the}} largest sectors in the modern food industry, including the spread at the present time to countries such as China and Japan. This review analyzes the reasons for this expansion and flourishing. As reviewed in detail, milk has numerous nutritional advantages, most important being almost an irreplaceable source of dietary calcium, hence justifying the effort required to increase its consumption. On the other hand, widespread lactose intolerance among the adult population is a considerable drawback to dairy-based foods consumption. Over the centuries, three factors allowed humans to overcome limitations imposed by lactose intolerance: (i) mutations, which occurred in particular populations, most notably in the north European Celtic societies and African nomads, in which carriers of the lactose intolerance gene converted from being lactose intolerant to lactose tolerant; (ii) the ability to develop low-lactose products such as cheese and yogurt; and (iii) colon microbiome adaptation, which allow lactose intolerant individuals to overcome its intolerance. However, in a few examples in the last decade, modern dairy products, such as the popular and widespread bio-cultured yogurts, were suspected to be unsuitable for lactose intolerant peoples. In addition, the use of lactose and <b>milk-derived</b> <b>products</b> containing lactose in non-dairy products has become widespread. For these reasons, it is concluded that it might be important and helpful to label food that may contain lactose because such information will allow lactose intolerant groups to control lactose intake within the physiological limitations of ~ 12 g per a single meal...|$|E
40|$|Pathogenic Shiga toxin-producing E. coli (STEC) are {{recognized}} worldwide as environment and foodborne pathogens {{which can be}} transmitted by ingestion of ready-to-eat food such as raw <b>milk-derived</b> <b>products.</b> STEC show a prevalence rate in dairy products of 0. 9 %, yet comparably few outbreaks have been related to dairy products consumption. In this study, we used rt-qPCR to identify the virulence potential of 0157, 026 and 0103 STEC strains isolated from raw-milk dairy products by analyzing virulence-related gene frequencies and associations with O-island (OI) 44, 01 - 48, 01 - 50, 01 - 57, 01 - 71 and 01 - 122. Results showed that 100 % of STEC strains investigated harbored genes associated with EHEC-related virulence profile patterns (eae and stx, with either espK, espy, ureD and/or Z 2098). We also found similarities in virulence-related gene content between O 157 :H 7 and O 103 :H 2 dairy and non-dairy STEC strains, especially isolates from human cases. The O 26 :H 11 -serotype STEC strains investigated harbor the arcA-allele 2 gene associated with specific genetic markers. These profiles are associated with high-virulence seropathotype-A STEC. However, the low frequency of stx 2 gene associated with absence of other virulence genes in dairy isolates of O 26 :H 11 remains a promising avenue of investigation to estimate their real pathogenicity. All O 26 :H 11 attaching-effacing E. coli (AEEC) strains carried CRISPRo 26 :rni SP 026 E but not genetic markers espK, espy, ureD and/or Z 2098 associated with the emerging potentially high -virulence "new French clone". These strains are potentially as "EHEC-like" strains because they may acquire (or have lost) stx gene. In this study, O 157 :H 7, O 103 :H 2 and O 26 :H 11 STEC strains isolated from dairy products were assigned as potential pathogens. However, research now needs to investigate the impact of dairy product environment and dairy processing on the expression of their pathogenicity...|$|E

40|$|Various {{methods for}} {{extraction}} {{and analysis of}} high value minor proteins (lactoferrin, lactoperoxidase and immunoglobulins) directly from raw milk were explored. Extraction, purification and analysis of high-value minor proteins directly from milk without pre-treatment are major challenges for dairy industry, {{largely due to the}} complexity of milk and the presence of colloidal solids (casein micelles and milk fat globules). To overcome some of these challenges, this work focused on three main objectives: 1) characterization of cryogel monolith chromatography for purification of lactoferrin (LF) and lactoperoxidase (LP) directly from raw milk in single step, 2) identification and characterization of Protein A Mimetic affinity ligands for purification of immunoglobulins (Igs) from milk and 3) development and validation of a surface plasmon resonance method for simultaneous quantification of five whey proteins in multiple samples. Results portrayed the possibility of 40 – 50 column volumes of various milk samples (whole milk, skim milk and acid whey) to pass through a 5 mL cryogel monolith chromatography column at 525 cm hr⁻¹ without exceeding its pressure limits if the processing temperature is maintained around 35 – 37 °C. Ideally, this should be the milk secretion temperature. The dynamic binding capacity obtained for the cryogel matrix (2. 1 mg mL⁻¹) was {{similar to that of the}} binding capacity (2. 01 mg mL⁻¹) at equilibrium with 0. 1 mg mL⁻¹ of lactoferrin in the feed samples. Lactoferrin and lactoperoxidase was selectively bound to the cryogel column with trivial leakage in flowthrough fractions. Lactoferrin was recovered from elution fractions with a yield of 85 % and a purity of 90 %. These results, together with the ease of manufacture, low cost and versatile surface chemistry of cryogels suggest that they may be a good alternative to packed-bed chromatography for direct capture of proteins from milk, provided that the binding capacity can be increased. A Protein A Mimetic (PAM) hexapeptide (HWRGWV) peptide ligand that binds to the Fc portion of antibody molecules was explored for affinity purification of immunoglobulins from milk. The peptide has the ability to purify IgG from various milk and whey samples with a purity of greater than 85 % in single step. More than 90 % bound IgG was recovered with 0. 2 M acetate buffer at pH 4. 0 and total column regeneration was successfully achieved by 2. 0 M guanidine-HCl. At 9. 0 mg mL⁻¹ of IgG feed concentration, an equilibrium binding capacity of 21. 7 mg mL⁻¹ and dynamic binding capacity of approximately 12. 0 mg mL⁻¹ of resin was obtained. Recoveries and yields of IgG were significantly influenced by the feed IgG concentration. PAM hexamer ligand also contributed a significant amount of cross-reactivity with casein, glycomacropeptides and β-lactoglobulin proteins, however majority of these proteins were recovered in the regeneration step, except β-lactoglobulin, which co-eluted with IgG. Higher IgG concentration in feed vastly reduced the amount of cross-reactivity whilst increasing the recoveries and purities in the final product. PAM affinity ligands also showed interactions towards other classes of bovine immunoglobulins. These findings established the possibility of using PAM hexamer peptide as an alternative to conventional Protein A/G affinity chromatography for the isolation of Igs from milk in single step process. A surface plasmon resonance (SPR) method was developed for simultaneous, quantitative determination of commercially important whey proteins in raw and processed milk samples, whey fractions and various <b>milk-derived</b> <b>products,</b> with six samples per assay. Immobilized antibody stability and reproducibility of analyses were studied over time for 25 independent runs (n= 300), giving a relative standard deviation (RSD) of < 4 %. Immobilized antibodies showed negligible non-specific interactions (< 2 – 4 SPR response units (RU)) and no cross-reactivity towards other milk components (< 1 RU). Regeneration of immobilised antibodies with glycine at pH 1. 75 was determined to be optimal for maintaining the SPR response between samples. This method compared and validated well with reversed phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) and standard enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) ...|$|E
