However, the diameter of Hela nuclei is as large as 7 – 10  μm and the electron beam cannot penetrate the vitrified sample with such a thickness. Cryo-ultramicrotomy sectioning of vitrified materials is a conventional method to acquire the sample for electron microscopic study, but this method inevitably suffers from distortions and deformations caused by the mechanical cutting process, and forms unavoidable sample compressions in the cutting direction, which introduce significant artifacts to the later ET analysis. In contrast to <b>mechanical</b> <b>sectioning,</b> cryo-FIB milling can be applied to the frozen-hydrated material to thin the native samples and make them transparent enough (50 – 200  nm) for TEM imaging (Rogort et al. 2012), without introducing heat-induced devitrification effect.|$|E

These methods should also be simple, inexpensive, and accessible to the greatest number of users possible. This dissertation explores several unconventional methods of forming micro- and nanostructures for electronic and optical applications. Chapter 1 provides an overview of the most prominent method of nanofabrication in this dissertation, nanoskiving, which is the use of <b>mechanical</b> <b>sectioning</b> of encapsulated thin films to generate nanostructures. Several ancillary techniques are used to prepare substrates for nanoskiving: shadow evaporation, chemical synthesis, electrodeposition, soft lithographic molding, spin-coating, and rolling. Chapter 2, Appendix I, II, and IV, survey the materials and methods of nanoskiving. Appendices III and VI describe combinations of nanoskiving with soft lithographic molding to generate and replicate two-dimensional structures for electronic and optical applications.

40|$|The {{preparation}} of biological cells for either scanning or {{transmission electron microscopy}} requires a complex process of fixation, dehydration and drying. Critical point drying is commonly used for samples investigated with a scanning electron beam, whereas resin-infiltration is typically used for transmission electron microscopy. Critical point drying may cause cracks at the cellular surface and a sponge-like morphology of nondistinguishable intracellular compartments. Resin-infiltrated biological samples result in a solid block of resin, which can be further processed by <b>mechanical</b> <b>sectioning,</b> however that does not allow a top view examination of small cell–cell and cell–surface contacts. Here, we propose a method for removing resin excess on biological samples before effective polymerization. In this way the cells result to be embedded in an ultra-thin layer of epoxy resin. This novel method highlights in contrast to standard methods the imaging of individual cells not only on nanostructured planar surfaces but also on topologically challenging substrates with high aspect ratio three-dimensional features by scanning electron microscopy...|$|E

In the past therapsid skulls were investigated by <b>mechanical</b> <b>sectioning</b> or serial grinding, which was a very time-consuming and destructive process and could only be applied to non-valuable or poorly preserved specimens. As most therapsid skulls are embedded in terrestrial iron-rich sediments of Late Permian or Triassic age, i. e. so called “Red beds”, a successful investigation with X-Rays is often not possible. We successfully investigated therapsid skulls by means of neutron tomography at the facility ANTARES at FRM II in Munich using cold neutron radiation. This kind of radiation is able to penetrate iron-rich substances in the range between 5 and 15 cm and produces a good contrast between matrix and bones, which enables segmentation of internal cranial structures such as bones, cavities and canals of nerves and blood vessels. In particular, neutron tomography combined with methods of 3 D modeling was used here for the investigation and reconstruction of the auditory apparatus of therapsids...|$|E

40|$|Impact {{responses}} and damage induced by a drop-weight instrument on GLARE 5 fiber-metal laminates (FMLs) with different thicknesses were studied. The effect of impactor mass was also considered. The damage characteristics were evaluated using both nondestructive ultrasonic and <b>mechanical</b> <b>sectioning</b> techniques. The ultrasonic C-scan technique could only assess the contour of entire damage area whereas more details of damage were obtained using the mechanical cross-sectioning technique. As expected, thicker GLARE 5 FMLs offered higher impact resistance. When {{subjected to the}} same impact energy, the entire damage contour enlarged as the specimen became thicker. Under the same impact condition, by reducing the impactor mass, the contact force escalated while the contact stiffness increased. Experimental {{results showed that the}} threshold cracking energy varied parabolically with respect to the impact velocity, metal volume fraction (MVF) and the specimen thickness. By increasing the metal volume fraction of the panels, the threshold cracking energy decreased parabolically.

Using this imaging technology, we rapidly obtain detailed three-dimensional (3 -D) reconstructions of individual hair follicles. No staining or <b>mechanical</b> <b>sectioning</b> is involved, since multiphoton microscopy coregisters two-photon excited fluorescence (TPF) from cells and second harmonic generation (SHG) signals from the extracellular matrix (ECM). These signals are ideally suited for estimating molecularly encoded hair follicular 3 -D geometries, including sizes of the follicular orifices and their angles relative to the skin surface. In the normal hair follicles, spectral separation of SHG signals generated by the ECM of the hair follicle from that of intrinsic cellular fluorescence revealed intricate spatial interaction of the cellular components with the surrounding connective tissue. In the pathological hair follicles, these were clearly modified. In particular, in the transgenic mice, we observed lack of cellular fluorescence and significantly shallower angles of follicular orifices {{with respect to the}} skin surface.

Recently, we developed a technique, called ‘‘bioskiving’’ to create novel 2 D and 3 D constructs from decellularized tendon, {{using a combination of}} <b>mechanical</b> <b>sectioning,</b> and layered stacking and rolling. The unidirectionally aligned collagen nanofibers (derived from sections of decellular-ized tendon) offer good mechanical properties to the con-structs compared with those fabricated from reconstituted collagen. In this paper, we studied the effect that several variables have on the mechanical properties of structures fabricated from tendon slices, including crosslinking den-sity and the orientation in which the fibers are stacked. We observed that following stacking and crosslinking, the strength of the constructs is significantly improved, with crosslinked sections having an ultimate tensile strength over 20 times greater than non-crosslinked samples, and a modulus nearly 50 times higher. The mechanism of the mechanical failure mode of the tendon constructs with or without crosslinking was also investigated. The strength and fiber organization, combined with the ability to intro-duce transversely isotropic mechanical properties makes the laminar tendon composites a biocompatible material that may find future use in a number of biomedical and tissue engineering applications...|$|E

Some structural units, {{such as the}} alveolar duct, appear to selectively participate in tissue regeneration. Here, we demonstrate an approach to conduct laser microdissection of the lung alveolar duct for single-cell PCR analysis. Our approach involved three steps. 1) The initial preparation used <b>mechanical</b> <b>sectioning</b> of the lung tissue with sufficient thickness to encompass the structure of interest.

The air-filled lung was sufficiently accessible by light microscopy that counterstains or fluorescent labels were unnecessary to identify the alveolar duct. 3) The enzymatic and microfluidic isolation of single cells allowed for the harvest of as few as several thousand cells for PCR analysis. Microfluidics based arrays were used to measure the expression of selected marker genes in individual cells to characterize different cell populations. Preliminary work suggests the unique value of this approach to understanding the intra- and intercellular interactions within the regenerating alveolar duct...|$|E
40|$|A {{sample of}} pre-painted metal was {{investigated}} using the dual beam system of a {{focused ion beam}} (FIB) and scanning electron microscope (SEM). The FIB {{was used to remove}} material (known as ‘milling’), clean and ‘polish’ the sample exposing a cross-section of the coating. SEM was then used to investigate and analyse the structure and composition of the coating system. However, preliminary trials showed that in order to have good compositional data the technique needs to be developed and optimised. This paper presents the experimental work that was carried out in order to achieve this. First the milling area was changed from the centre of sample {{to the edge of the}} sample. Second, the mill shape needed to be changed from a rectangle to an isosceles trapezoid to allow better detection of the characteristic X-rays for the detector. Finally the tilt and rotation of the stage were changed for further improvement in X-ray detection. Focused ion beam/scanning electron microscope (FIB/SEM) was found to be a useful technique to study the cross-sections of pre-painted metal. Information from secondary and backscatter electrons images can reveal the quality of the coating (for example adhesion to substrate, pigment dispersion, interfacial properties etc.) and also the thickness of the coating causing less damage to the sample compared to other <b>mechanical</b> <b>sectioning</b> techniques. Additionally it offers the ability to look at specific areas of interest such as defects, contamination and corroded areas. Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) analysis allows mapping of the elements which are shown distributed in the coating and also the quantification of those elements.

A range of surface conditions has been studied, namely polished and shot peened (with varying levels of intensity). In the polished (unpeened) condition, inclusions (alumina and manganese sulphide) {{played an important role in}} initiating and controlling early fatigue crack behaviour. When fatigue cracks initiated from an alumina stringer, the crack morphology was normally dominated by single stringers, which were always in the centre of the fatigue crack, indicating its primary role in initiation. Manganese sulphide inclusion groups however seemed to dominate and affect the crack path along both the surface and depth crack growth directions. The more intensely shot peened condition did not however evidence inclusion or stringer affected fatigue crack initiation or growth behaviour; sub-surface crack coalescence being clearly observed by both serial sectioning and CT (computed tomography) imaging techniques at a depth of about 150 ~ 180 ?m. These sub-surface crack coalescences can be linked to both the extent of the compressive residual stress as well as the depth of the plastic deformation arising from the intense shot peening process. Shot peening appears to provide a different defect population that initiates fatigue cracks and competes with the underlying metallurgical defect populations. The most beneficial shot peening process would in this case appear to “deactivate” the original metallurgical defect population and substitute a known defect distribution from the shot peening process from which fatigue cracks grow rather slowly in the strain hardened surface layer which also contains compressive residual stresses. A benefit to fatigue life in bending, even under Low Cycle Fatigue (LCF) conditions, has been observed in these tests if a sufficiently severe shot peening condition is applied in a constrained notch configuration...|$|E
