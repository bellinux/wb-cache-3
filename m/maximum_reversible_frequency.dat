50|$|Synaptic fatigue {{can affect}} many synapses of many {{different}} types of neurons. The existence and observations of synaptic fatigue are accepted universally, although the exact mechanisms underlying the phenomenon are not completely understood. It is generally seen in mature cells at high frequencies of stimuli (>1 Hz). One specific example is that the gill withdrawal reflex of the Aplysia is caused by homosynaptic depression. Although homosynaptic and heterosynaptic depression can lead to long-term depression and/or potentiation, this particular case is a short-term example of how homosynaptic depression causes synaptic fatigue. Perforant path-granule cells (PP-GC) in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus in adult rats have been shown to experience fatigue at lower frequencies (0.05-0.2 Hz). In the developing rat PP-GCs, two types of synaptic plasticity were shown to lead to synaptic fatigue.

40|$|Ni-Mn-Ga based {{ferromagnetic}} {{shape memory}} alloys (FSMAs) {{have emerged as}} a promising new class of active materials capable of producing a large (several %) magnetic-field-induced strain (MFIS). FSMAs still have several characteristic shortcomings that may limit their potential applications. A threshold field of 2 to 4 kOe must be overcome to initiate twin boundary motion and a larger field is required to achieve full actuation. The operating window of the stress output from FSMA actuators is narrow and limited to the range between 0. 5 and 2 MPa. Outside the operating range, the strain output diminishes significantly. This thesis addresses these limitations and reports potential techniques to decrease the required threshold field and increase the stress and strain output of FSMA actuation. The demagnetizing field due to magnetic poles {{on the surface of}} the sample is found to significantly influence the maximum field needed for full MFIS. The demagnetizing field decreases the effective internal field inside the FSMA sample; as a result, for a given external field, the magnetic driving force is reduced by the demagnetizing field. For a small demagnetization factor, full MFIS can be achieved at a field as low as 0. 5 kOe. However, for a high demagnetization factor, full MFIS may require a field as high as 3. 5 kOe. A phenomenological free energy model with an approximate magnetostatic term included properly describes this. The application of an acoustic assist from a 33 -mode piezoelectric stack is shown to improve MFIS of Ni-Mn-Ga single crystals by reducing the required threshold field and twinning-yield stress. Threshold field reductions of up to 1 kOe are observed, and the twinning-yield stress is reduced by up to 0. 5 MPa. The piezo assist on FSMA actuation can be understood as a form of time varying stress waves that facilitate twin boundary motion. (cont.) The stress-wave theory and FEM analyses, based on assumption of an elastic and isotropic material, are used to estimate the amplitude of stress waves. The stress values determined from the wave theory and FEM are comparable to the observed reduction in twinning-yield stress (0. 6 to 2 MPa). The empirical stress wave amplitude is generally lower than the calculated one, because the actual stress waves generated in FSMA are limited by inelastic and anisotropic nature of the FSMA samples. For FSMA samples with twin planes oriented 45 o to the elongation axis, longitudinal stress waves parallel to the elongation axis are the most effective type to facilitate twin boundary motion. Longitudinal stress waves impart uniaxial tensile/compressive stresses into the sample normal to its base, resulting in the maximum shear stresses along the 45 o twin planes. On the contrary, the transverse stress waves are the least effective type, because the resulting shear stresses along the twin planes are equal to zero. This is confirmed by the comparison of the effectiveness of the piezo-assist using the longitudinal 33 -mode and transverse 15 -mode piezo stacks. The maximum reduction of twinning-yield stress of 0. 5 MPa is observed with the longitudinal piezo assist, while a maximum twinning stress reduction of only 0. 05 MPa can be achieved by the transverse piezo assist. For FSMA cyclic actuation, both operating stress and strain outputs of the FSMA actuation are significantly enhanced by the piezo-assisted effect. Without the piezoassistance, the <b>maximum</b> <b>reversible</b> strain of the sample used here is 3 % and appears only in the limited external stress range between 0. 7 and 1 MPa. With the piezo-assistance, the <b>maximum</b> <b>reversible</b> strain increases to 4. 5 % and appears in a broader range of stress output between 0. 4 and 1. 2 MPa. (cont.) The reduction in the twinning-yield stress due to the acoustic-assistance obviously improves the FSMA cyclic actuation performance; any magnetic energy not used to drive twin boundary motion can potentially be utilized to work against a larger external stress. The magnetic stresses for a given magnetic field, calculated from the free energy model, appear to be larger than the empirical ones. The demagnetization effect is shown to be responsible for much of the deviation. The demagnetization effect reduces the internal field needed to move twin boundary and do external work. by Ratchatee Techapiesancharoenkij. Thesis (Ph. D.)

40|$|This thesis {{reports on}} the {{development}} of a new method for studying the growth of thin films and the dynamics of surface processes. Real-time photoelectron spectroscopy enabled by advances in electron detection technology has been applied to the study of metal overlayers on a p-type CVD (001) diamond single crystal and tin (II) phthalocyanine (SnPc) overlayers on Si (111), GaAs (001) and polycrystalline Au substrates. The performance of the Aberystwyth real-time electron spectroscopy (REES) system is also reviewed. Temperature-dependent real-time photoelectron studies of an oxygen-terminated boron-doped CVD (001) single crystal diamond is performed with a fully reversible temperature dependent Fermi level shift of 1 eV observed on the oxygen-terminated 1 x 1 surface up to a temperature of 700 ?C. This shift is found to correlate with oxygen coverage where the <b>maximum</b> <b>reversible</b> shift reduces in magnitude with decreasing oxygen coverage. The growth of aluminium contacts on the (001) diamond surface is investigated with the formation of a Schottky contact for which current-voltage measurements yield a barrier height of 1. 05 eV and an ideality factor of 1. 4. Real-time measurements monitor the formation of the contact revealing the transition from layered to clustered growth of the aluminium film during in vacuo deposition. During annealing of the contact to 860 ?C real-time measurements reveal a direct correlation between the transition from Schottky to Ohmic behaviour and the formation of interfacial carbide at 482 ?C. Deposition of iron on the (001) diamond surface is found to form an uniform layer with iron carbide species present at the interface. Subsequent annealing of the diamond to 850 ?C results in the formation of a graphite layer with iron acting as a catalyst for the graphitisation process. AFM and NEXAFS of the resulting graphite layer reveal an ordered surface. A mechanism is proposed for the graphitisation. Finally, the growth of SnPc is investigated on Si (111), GaAs (001) and polycrystalline Au. Growth is found to proceed in two stages and re-organisation of the molecules is detected by real-time measurements and found to continue after deposition for a period of up to 30 minutes. Studies also suggest that substrate temperature affects the angle of stacking and the rate of molecular re-organisation. A theoretical molecular model for this re-organisation was successfully developed. EPSRC; Aberystwyth University Garrod Thomas Scholarship Fund; Element Six Ltd, Ascot, U...|$|R

40|$|Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) of many Helicobacter pylori strains expresses Lewis antigens (Lex, Ley, Lea, Leb) {{which are}} similar to those {{expressed}} by gastric epithelial cells (“molecular mimicry”). 1 In addition,H pylori LPS displays phase variation in these antigens—that is, the high <b>frequency,</b> <b>reversible</b> switching of phenotype 2; for instance, a strain that expresses Lex may yield variants that express Ley. As yet, no definite role has been assigned to these Lewis antigens, nor to phase variation, in the pathogenesis of gastric disease.

Cu prefers {{to occupy the}} 2 c site in these alloys, which enlarges the volume of unit cell, lowers the c/a ratios and flattens the pressure-concentration-temperature (PCT) isotherm. The incorporation of Cu, decrease obviously the <b>maximum</b> and <b>reversible</b> hydrogen storage capacity, {{as well as the}} desorption pressure and PCT hysteresis. Meanwhile, the maximum hydrogen storage capacities decrease, whereas the reversible hydrogen storage capacities increase at elevated temperature, resulting in increase of reversible capacity ratio. All the alloy electrodes show high dischargeabilities above 300 mAh/g, and good high-rate recoverability properties at 238 K. The electrochemical capacity at low temperature is determined by the hydrogen absorption capacity and charge efficiency. In addition, the amount of Cu-content x= 0. 15 is recommended for the nickel/metal hydride battery used in terms of the maximum and high-rate dischargecapacity, and catalytic properties of the alloy electrodes at a temperature as low as 238 K.

40|$|The {{principal}} {{object of}} this thesis is {{the investigation of}} silicon oxycarbide (SiOC) ceramics as anode material for Li-ion batteries. The investigated materials are prepared by cross linking commercial polymer siloxanes via hydrosylilation reactions or hybrid alkoxide precursors via sol-gel. The cross linked polymer networks are then converted in to ceramic materials by a pyrolysis process in controlled argon atmosphere at 800 - 1300 °C. In details the influence of carbon content on lithium storage properties is addressed for SiOC with the same O/Si atomic ratio of about 1. Detailed structural characterization studies are performed using complementary techniques which aim correlating the electrochemical behavior with the microstructure of the SiOC anodes. Results suggest that SiOC anodes behave as a composite material consisting of a disordered silicon oxycarbide phase having a very high first insertion capacity of ca 1300 mAh g- 1 and a free C phase. However, the charge irreversibly trapped into the amorphous silicon oxycarbide network is also high. In consequence the <b>maximum</b> <b>reversible</b> lithium storage capacity of 650 mAh g- 1 is measured on high-C content SiOCs with the ratio between amorphous silicon oxycarbide and the free C phase of  1 : 1. The high carbon content SiOC shows also an excellent cycling stability and performance at high charging/discharging rate with the stable capacity at 2 C rate being around 200 mAh g- 1. Increasing the pyrolysis temperature has an opposite effect on the low-C and high-C materials: for the latter one the reversible capacity decreases following a known trend while the former shows an increase of xi the reversible capacity which has never been observed before for similar materials. The influence of pyrolysis atmosphere on lithium storage capacity is investigated as well. It is found that pyrolysis in Ar/H 2 mixtures, compared to the treatment under pure Ar, results into a decrease of the concentration of C dangling bonds as revealed by electron spin resonance (ESR) measurements. The sample prepared under Ar/H 2 mixture shows an excellent cycling stability {{with an increase in}} the specific capacity of about 150 mAh g- 1 compared to its analogues pyrolysed in pure argon atmosphere. In order to study the role of porosity towards the lithium storage properties, a comparison of dense and porous materials obtained using same starting precursors is made. Porous SiOC ceramics are prepared by HF etching of the SiOC ceramics. HF etching removes a part of the amorphous silica phase from SiOC nanostructure leaving a porous structure. Porous ceramics with surface areas up to 640 m 2 g- 1 is obtained. The electrochemical charging/discharging results indicate that the porosity can help to increase the lithium storage capacity and it also leads to an enhanced cycling stability. This work demonstrates clearly that silicon oxycarbide (SiOC) ceramics present excellent electrochemical properties to be applied as a promising anode material for lithium storage applications...|$|R

The SnO 2 {{thin films}} doped with traces of silicon were {{deposited}} on the p-type (100) Si substrate by the r. f. magnetron sputtering method from Sn 0. 94 Si 0. 06 O 2 {{target for the}} application of lithium secondary micro-battery anode. The crystal orientation of tin oxide thin films was changed from (110) to (101) or (211) with the increase of the substrate temperature. Contrarily, the crystallization of tin oxide thin films, which were heat-treated in the RTA furnace from 450 ℃ to 650 ℃ under the O 2 ambient, did not show significant difference. As a result of the electrochemical analysis, we could see that the irreversible capacity was reduced during the first discharge/charge cycle. Capacity increased with the increase of substrate temperature, but decreased with the increase of RTA temperatures. In particular, the <b>maximum</b> value of <b>reversible</b> capacity was 700 mAh/g under the deposition condition of the substrate temperature of 300 ℃ and the Ar:O 2 ratio of 7 : 3...|$|R
40|$|Neural {{stimulation}} is {{an established}} treatment methodology for {{an increasing number}} of diseases. Electrical Stimulation injects a stimulation signal through electrodes that are implanted in the target area of the central or peripheral nervous system in order to evoke a specific neuronal response that suppresses or treats pathological activity. This thesis discusses the design of neural stimulators: the device that is responsible for generating the stimulation signal in a safe, efficient and controlled manner. The design of such a device requires a highly multidisciplinary approach which involves disciplines such as neuroscience, electrophysiology, electrochemistry and electrical engineering. The first part of this thesis focuses on the processes associated with the neuronal recruitment. After describing the stimulation processes in detail at various levels, the discussion zooms in on the processes at the electrode-tissue interface and in particular the electrochemical behavior. Many neural stimulators include coupling capacitors between the stimulator and the electrodes {{to reduce the risk of}} potentially harmful electrochemical reactions. However, it is shown that coupling capacitors also have negative implications that need to be considered, such as a shift in the equilibrium potential of the electrode-tissue interface. Also, the reversibility of charge transfer processes at the electrode-tissue interface is analyzed. Most studies rely on monitoring the electrode-tissue interface potential to determine the <b>maximum</b> <b>reversible</b> charge injection limits. By measuring the reversible charge in a more direct way, it was found that under specific conditions the irreversible charge transfer processes already play a role for stimulation intensities that are well below the established charge injection limits. The extensive description of the stimulation process is furthermore used to introduce a fundamentally different stimulation paradigm. Instead of using a constant current or voltage to stimulate the electrodes, a high frequency, switched-mode stimulation signal is applied. The advantage of such a stimulation pattern is that it can be generated in a power efficient way by the neurostimulator circuit using switched-mode operation that is common in energy efficient amplifiers (class-D operation) or power management circuits. The efficacy of the proposed stimulation pattern is verified both using modeling as well as using in vitro measurements by analyzing the response of patch-clamped Purkinje cells. The second part of the thesis focuses on the electrical design of neural stimulators. The first system is designed to be used in a specific neuroscientific experiment and features arbitrary waveform stimulation. The user has full flexibility over the choice of stimulation waveform, while the stimulator circuit guarantees safety by ensuring charge balanced operation. The stimulator circuit is realized and included in a system implementation that is suitable for the specific in vivo experimental setup. The stimulation pulse (which uses a burst pattern) is synchronized with auditory stimulation in an attempt to recondition the neural pathways in a mouse that suffers from tinnitus. The second design implements the high-frequency switched-mode stimulation pattern that was introduced in the first part of the thesis. The system features an unfiltered forward buck-boost converter at its core to directly stimulate the target tissue. It is possible to operate the system with multiple independent channels that connect to an arbitrary electrode configuration, making the system well suited for current steering techniques. Furthermore, comprehensive control was implemented using a dual clock configuration that allows both autonomic tonic stimulation, as well as single shot stimulation. Each channel can be configured individually with tailored stimulation parameters and multiple channels can operate in a synchronized fashion. The system is power efficient, especially when compared with state-of-the-art constant current stimulators with an adaptive power supply that operate in multichannel mode. Efficiency improvements up to 200 % compared with state of the art constant current stimulators are demonstrated. Furthermore, the number of external components required is reduced to a single inductor. BioelectronicsElectrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Scienc...|$|R
