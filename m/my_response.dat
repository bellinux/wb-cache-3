25|$|A {{collaboration}} {{is like a}} good conversation, Nicola came to my studio {{a couple of times}} and I went to hers; we initially chatted about her music, the forthcoming album and how this related to her vision for the shoes. I went away and started designing <b>my</b> <b>response</b> to this. After our first meeting I was excited by her ideas and collaborating with people who have a strong vision is really fantastic. Nicola considers everything she does really carefully and has a totally clear view of what she wants to achieve. While the shoes are just a small part of this, I knew it would be interesting and fun to work together.|$|E
25|$|If {{you read}} my book, {{you find a}} certain ambivalence there. Journalistically, I {{thought it was an}} {{important}} story because it explained why the CIA would send Joe Wilson – a former Clinton White House aide with no track record in intelligence and no experience in Niger – on a fact-finding mission to Africa. From a personal point of view, I said in the book I probably should have ignored what I'd been told about Mrs. Wilson. Now I'm much less ambivalent. I'd go full speed ahead because of the hateful and beastly way in which my left-wing critics in the press and Congress tried to make a political affair out of it and tried to ruin me. <b>My</b> <b>response</b> now is this: The hell with you. They didn't ruin me. I have my faith, my family, and a good life. A lot of people love me – or like me. So they failed. I would do the same thing over again because I don't think I hurt Valerie Plame whatsoever.|$|E

Diamandis originally planned to release the record as a [...] "side project" [...] under an entity separate from Marina and the Diamonds, although her management disapproved. The track [...] "Living Dead" [...] was the first recorded during its production, and approximately 22 songs were recorded for potential inclusion on the album. She later commented that the record was dedicated to [...] "dysfunctional love", elaborating that [...] "rejection is a universally embarrassing topic and Electra Heart is <b>my</b> <b>response</b> to that." [...] Diamandis stated that Electra Heart was influenced by Madonna, Marilyn Monroe, and Queen of France Marie Antoinette; she described Madonna as being [...] "fearless" [...] and felt that she showcased {{a desire to be}} a successful artist beyond fame and wealth. Diamandis told Glamour that Britney Spears influenced a [...] "double-sided" [...] theme for the record of both [...] "innocence" [...] and [...] "darkness".

Saakashvili said that his first meeting with Medvedev in June 2008 in St. Petersburg was good; while at the next meeting with Medvedev in Astana in July 2008, the Russian president’s stance was changed and [...] "it was clear that they [...] were preparing for something bad." [...] Saakashvili said that Georgia had expected a Russian attack from Abkhazia, rather than from South Ossetia, so major forces of the Georgian army were deployed in the Georgia's west. He said that as the situation deteriorated on 7 August, [...] "we moved one brigade [...] closer to South Ossetia, and later another [...] as well." [...] "But our major forces were still deployed in the west; there was a brigade at Senaki [...] and we did not call back our brigade from Iraq, because I was deeply convinced up to the last minute that Russia would not engage in such a large-scale provocation," [...] he said. [...] "Although we were under fire from 120mm mortar launchers, I announced a unilateral ceasefire; at that time we already had one dead soldier in the village of Avnevi and four others were wounded; [...] Kezerashvili was begging me to let him open artillery fire, because, he was telling me, otherwise he was unable to bring [...] from [...] But <b>my</b> <b>response</b> was that we could not open fire whatever happened," [...] he said.
