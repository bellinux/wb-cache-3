5|$|In the 1880s, white colonists {{arrived with}} Cecil Rhodes's British South Africa Company (BSAC). In 1888, Rhodes {{obtained}} a concession for <b>mining</b> <b>rights</b> from King Lobengula of the Ndebele peoples. He presented this concession {{to persuade the}} government of the United Kingdom to grant a royal charter to the company over Matabeleland, and its subject states such as Mashonaland as well.|$|E
5|$|Having {{secured the}} Rudd Concession on <b>mining</b> <b>rights</b> from King Lobengula of Matabeleland on 30 October 1888, Cecil Rhodes and his British South Africa Company were granted a Royal Charter by Queen Victoria in October 1889. Under this charter, the Company was {{empowered}} {{to trade with}} indigenous rulers, form banks, own and manage land, and raise and run a police force. In return for these rights, the British South Africa Company would administer and develop any territory it acquired, while respecting laws enacted by extant African rulers, and upholding free trade within its borders. Though the Company made good on most of these pledges, the assent of Lobengula and other native leaders, particularly regarding <b>mining</b> <b>rights,</b> was often evaded, misrepresented or simply ignored. Lobengula reacted by making war on the new arrivals, their Tswana allies and the local Mashona people in 1893. The resulting conflict ended with Lobengula's torching of his own capital at Bulawayo, his death from smallpox in early 1894, and the subsequent submission of his izinDuna (advisors) to the Company. Violent rebellion to the north-east, in neighbouring Mashonaland, was forcibly put down by the Company during 1897.|$|E
5|$|Apart from organising the federation, Welensky won a {{significant}} political battle in Northern Rhodesia against the British South Africa Company (BSAC), which controlled mineral {{rights and the}} associated royalties throughout the territory. The company, and not the British crown, had signed the treaties with African kings that surrendered <b>mining</b> <b>rights,</b> but the BSAC had stopped administering Northern Rhodesia in 1924. Welensky argued that the territory {{had a right to}} the royalties, and petitioned the governor to take action. After many talks, the BSAC relented and agreed to surrender mineral rights in 1986, and to pay 20% of its profits from these rights to the government until then.|$|E

40|$|Thesis (LLM (Environmental Law and Governance)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2012. Since the {{enactment}} of the Mineral and Petroleum Resources Development Act 28 of 2002 (MPRDA) a fundamental conflict arose between the rights of a holder of either a prospecting or a <b>mining</b> <b>right,</b> and that of a landowner. On the one hand this can be explained by having regard to the impact the granting of a prospecting or a <b>mining</b> <b>right</b> may have {{on the rights of the}} landowner to whose land such a right relates. On the other hand, section 25 of the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa, 1996 (Constitution), provides for the protection of property to a certain extent. The protection that the Constitution affords to a landowner, together with the rights granted to the holder of a prospecting or a <b>mining</b> <b>right</b> by the MPRDA, is the cause of such a fundamental conflict. It is against this background that this study seeks to determine to what extent the MPRDA provides for the protection of a landowner's rights, having regard to the rights granted to the holder of a prospecting or a <b>mining</b> <b>right,</b> which is considered against the protection of property as afforded by the Constitution.

5|$|Rhodes outmanoeuvred {{his main}} {{opponent}} Barney Barnato and brought all the mines {{under the control}} of his company, De Beers, in 1888. On 30 October of that year, through the signing of the Rudd Concession by King Lobengula of Matabeleland, he obtained exclusive <b>mining</b> <b>rights</b> across all of Lobengula's territories in Matabeleland, Mashonaland and beyond for his soon-to-be-formed British South Africa Company (BSAC). Queen Victoria granted the BSAC a royal charter to administer and develop these territories on 29 October 1889, for an initial period of 25 years. This charter included the right to take possession of, deal with, and dispose of land. On 12 September 1890 Rhodes's Pioneer Column reached what was to become Salisbury.|$|E
5|$|The Rudd Concession, {{a written}} {{concession}} for exclusive <b>mining</b> <b>rights</b> in Matabeleland, Mashonaland and other adjoining territories {{in what is}} today Zimbabwe, was granted by King Lobengula of Matabeleland to Charles Rudd, James Rochfort Maguire and Francis Thompson, three agents {{acting on behalf of}} the South African-based politician and businessman Cecil Rhodes, on 30 October 1888. Despite Lobengula's retrospective attempts to disavow it, it proved the foundation for the royal charter granted by the United Kingdom to Rhodes's British South Africa Company in October 1889, and thereafter for the Pioneer Column's occupation of Mashonaland in 1890, which marked the beginning of white settlement, administration and development in the country that eventually became Rhodesia, named after Rhodes, in 1895.|$|E

40|$|The tax {{treatment}} of contingent liabilities assumed by a purchaser as part {{settlement of the}} purchase price for the acquisition of a business as a going concern has at the best of times been a contentious issue. During December 2013, SARS released a Discussion Document in which it set out its views in respect of the {{tax treatment}} of both the seller and the purchaser, where contingent liabilities are assumed as part settlement of the purchase consideration to be paid by the purchaser. The Discussion Document introduced two concepts in respect of contingent liabilities which are currently not recognised in South African tax law i. e. an embedded contingent liability and a free-standing contingent liability. These concepts were derived from the judgment delivered by the Supreme Court of Canada in the matter of Daishowa-Marubeni International Ltd v Canada, wherein the court found that the reforestation obligation attaching to a forest tenure is a future cost embedded in the forest tenure and as such cannot be assumed as a separate liability by a purchaser, but in fact, reduces the value of the forest tenure to which it relates i. e. the reforestation obligation is embedded in the forest tenure. In the same manner that the holder of a forest tenure in Canada is obligated to conduct reforestation activities in order to rehabilitate the land from which it had cut timber, the holder of a <b>mining</b> <b>right</b> in South Africa is obligated to rehabilitate the land on which it conducted its mining activities. The question that arises in this regard, {{is whether or not the}} mining rehabilitation obligation attaching to a <b>mining</b> <b>right</b> is, similarly to the reforestation obligation attaching to a forest tenure, so inextricably linked to the <b>mining</b> <b>right</b> that it becomes embedded in the <b>mining</b> <b>right</b> and as such reduces the value of the <b>mining</b> <b>right.</b> Should this be the case, the assumption of the mining rehabilitation obligation attaching to a <b>mining</b> <b>right</b> by a purchaser, when acquiring mining property and capital assets as part of a going concern, will not constitute consideration given for that property by the purchaser. This will in turn affect the application of section 37 of the Income Tax Act which determines the deemed capital expenditure incurred by the purchaser upon acquisition of the capital assets which will have an impact on the mining capital expenditure allowance the purchaser can claim in terms of section 15 (a), read with section 36 of the Income Tax Act. The purpose of this paper is to determine whether the concept of an embedded liability applies in a South African mining tax context and will consider the specific provisions contained in the Income Tax Act which deal with the taxation of mining companies, the nature of a <b>mining</b> <b>right</b> as opposed to that of a forest tenure, the factors impacting the value of a <b>mining</b> <b>right</b> as well as the application of the reasoning used and principles established in Daishowa-Marubeni International Ltd v Canada to a <b>mining</b> <b>right</b> and its corresponding mining rehabilitation obligation.

5|$|Under Canadian law, miners {{first had}} to get a license, either when they arrived at Dawson or en route from Victoria in Canada. They could then {{prospect}} for gold and, when they had found a suitable location, lay claim to <b>mining</b> <b>rights</b> over it. To stake a claim, a prospector would drive stakes into the ground a measured distance apart and then return to Dawson to register the claim for $15 ($410). This normally had to be done within three days, and by 1897 only one claim per person at a time was allowed in a district, although married couples could exploit a loophole that allowed the wife to register a claim in her own name, doubling their amount of land.|$|E
5|$|Arctic Bulk Minerals {{bought the}} <b>mining</b> <b>rights,</b> and {{operated}} a train once to {{twice a year}} to keep the track and rolling stock maintained. This company filed for bankruptcy in 2002. The mining company was then bought by the local power company Varanger Kraft and Sør-Varanger Municipality. In 2006, they sold the mining company to Tschudi Group for 102million Norwegian krone (NOK). The Tschudi Group established Northern Iron, registered in Perth, Australia, as a holding company to own the mining company. Operations in the mine and on the line resumed in 2009, after the price of iron had risen dramatically since {{the closing of the}} mine. With the opening of the mine, production is estimated at 3million tonnes of export per year.

5|$|Helm {{was painted}} as a {{suspicious}} figure {{by some of}} the izinDuna because all white visitors to Bulawayo met with him before seeing the king. This feeling was {{compounded by the fact that}} Helm had for some time acted as Lobengula's postmaster, and so handled all mail coming into Bulawayo. He was accused of having hidden the concession's true meaning from the king and of having knowingly sabotaged the prices being paid by traders for cattle, but neither of these charges could be proven either way. On the fourth day of the enquiry, Elliot and Rees, two missionaries based at Inyati, were asked if exclusive <b>mining</b> <b>rights</b> in other countries could be bought for similar sums, as Helm was claiming; they replied in the negative. The izinDuna concluded that either Helm or the missionaries must be lying. Elliot and Rees attempted to convince Lobengula that honest men did not necessarily always hold the same opinions, but had little success.|$|E

5|$|Rhodes's {{pursuit of}} the {{exclusive}} <b>mining</b> <b>rights</b> in Matabeleland, Mashonaland and the surrounding areas was motivated by his wish to annex them into the British Empire {{as part of his}} personal ambition for a Cape to Cairo Railway—winning the concession would enable him to gain a royal charter from the British government for a chartered company, empowered to annex and thereafter govern the Zambezi–Limpopo watershed on Britain's behalf. He laid the groundwork for concession negotiations during early 1888 by arranging a treaty of friendship between the British and Matabele peoples and then sent Rudd's team from South Africa to obtain the rights. Rudd succeeded following a race to the Matabele capital Bulawayo against Edward Arthur Maund, a bidding-rival employed by a London-based syndicate, and after long negotiations with the king and his council of izinDuna (tribal leaders).|$|E

25|$|For {{historical}} {{reasons the}} structure of the industry was different in the High Peak where, mainly because of very long leases, there had been a blurring of the Duchy's authority, and the two largest landowners, the Manners and Cavendish families, maintained claims to <b>mining</b> <b>rights</b> and dues. The miners fought hard, physically and in the courts, to obtain the free <b>mining</b> <b>rights</b> enjoyed in the Wirksworth Wapentake. The Manners family met them head-on, refused all attempts to establish free mining, and employed miners as day labourers in their mines. Their Cavendish neighbours at Chatsworth, after a period of conflict, adopted the same pattern as the Gells at Griffe Grange, collecting the dues from mines run by Duchy of Lancaster rules.|$|E

It was then managed by the Impulsora Minera de Angangueo, which continued mining here until 1991, when it was decided that the exploitation of the mines was no longer economically feasible. From then to the present, there have been disputes between the shareholders in the Impulsora and former miners and the state of Michoacan over the right to continue mining.
