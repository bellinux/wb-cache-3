50|$|These marks {{are used}} to set the {{corresponding}} cylinder to its maximum number, ready to be re-zeroed. To do so, the operator inserts the stylus in between these two spokes and turns the wheel {{all the way to}} the <b>stopping</b> <b>lever.</b> This works because each wheel is directly linked to its corresponding display cylinder (it automatically turns by one during a carry operation). To mark the spokes during manufacturing, one can move the cylinder so that its highest number is displayed and then mark the spoke under the <b>stopping</b> <b>lever</b> and the one to the right of it.|$|R

50|$|For a 10-digit wheel (N), {{the fixed}} outside wheel is {{numbered}} from 0 to 9 (N-1). The numbers are inscribed in a decreasing manner clockwise {{going from the}} bottom left to the bottom right of the <b>stop</b> <b>lever.</b> To add a 5, one must insert a stylus between the spokes that surround the number 5 and rotate the wheel clockwise {{all the way to}} the <b>stop</b> <b>lever.</b> The number displayed on the corresponding display register will be increased by 5 and, if a carry transfer takes place, the display register to the left of it will be increased by 1. To add 50, use the tens input wheel (second dial from the right on a decimal machine), to add 500, use the hundreds input wheel, etc...|$|R

50|$|Some of {{the very}} early GSPs were missing the slide <b>stop</b> <b>lever</b> which wasn't {{incorporated}} until the 1970s. The early model GSPs, from 1968 to 1977, had a manual safety catch {{on the left side}} of the frame. This feature was omitted in 1977 because it was an unnecessary feature on a competition pistol. Also throughout the years, the design of the ergonomic grips underwent several changes.|$|R

50|$|The PYa is a high-capacity, double-action, short-recoil {{semi-automatic}} pistol. Barrel/slide locking is {{a simplified}} Colt-Browning design, {{similar to that}} found in many modern pistols (for example the SIG Sauer and Glock families of pistols); the breech end of the barrel is rectangular in shape, rather than rounded, and fits into matching locking grooves within the slide, near the ejection port. The slide <b>stop</b> <b>lever</b> can be mounted {{on either side of}} the weapon to accommodate both left- and right-handed users. Likewise, the manual safety is ambidextrous, with safety catches on both sides of the weapon, where it is manipulated by the thumb. It is mounted on the frame, below the rear slide grooves, and directly behind the slide <b>stop</b> <b>lever.</b> The hammer is partially concealed at the sides to prevent catching on clothes and equipment. The magazine release catch is located in the base of the trigger guard on the left side, where it can be manipulated with the thumb (right-handed users) or index or middle finger (left-handed users). The front sight is formed as a fixed part of the slide and is non-adjustable. The back sight is drift adjustable for windage (dovetail type), but this requires a tool. Both feature white contrast elements to ease aiming in low-light conditions. The standard magazine capacity is 17 rounds, fed from a double-column, single feed magazine. Magazines with an 18 round capacity were produced after 2004.|$|R

The wheel displayed in the picture above has an inner wheel of complements but the numbers written on it are barely visible.

2500|$|The Glock 34 is a {{competition}} {{version of the}} Glock 17. It is similar to its predecessor, the Glock 17L, but with a slightly shorter slide and barrel, to meet the maximum size requirements for many sanctioned action pistol sporting events.

It has an extended magazine release, extended slide <b>stop</b> <b>lever,</b> [...] trigger pull, and an adjustable rear sight. The sides {{at the front of}} the slide are slanted instead of squared. Further, the top of the slide and parts of its inside are milled out, creating a conspicuous hole at the top designed to reduce front-end muzzle weight to better balance the pistol and reduce the overall weight of the slide.|$|R
50|$|The APS is a straight-blowback, select-fire, magazine-fed machine pistol. The {{weapon is}} fed through 20-round double-stack double-feed {{detachable}} steel box magazines. The APS shares common features with the Makarov service pistol, {{such as a}} heel-mounted magazine release, slide-mounted safety lever, and field-strip procedure. The rear sight is adjustable from 25, 50, 100 to 200 meters through an eccentric rotating drum/dial. The serrated front sight may be drifted for windage. The slide featured a textured strip on top to reduce aim-disturbing glare. The chrome-lined barrel serves as the recoil spring guide. The slide <b>stop</b> <b>lever</b> also acts as an ejector blade. The trigger guard pivots down for stripping and detents in position through a spring-loaded plunger. The checkered or serrated grips panels are made from wood (early models), reddish-brown bakelite or black plastic.|$|R
