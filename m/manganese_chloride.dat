40|$|The {{focus of}} work being {{performed}} on hot coal gas desulfurization at the Morgantown Energy Technology Center is {{primarily in the}} use of zinc titanate sorbents; however, prior studies indicated that an alternate sorbent, manganese dioxide-containing ore in mixture with alumina (75 wt% ore + 25 wt% Al{sub 2 }O{sub 3 }) appears to be a strong contender to zinc-based sorbents. Manganese, for example, has a lower vapor pressure in the elemental state than zinc; hence, it is not as likely to undergo zinc-depletion from the sorbent surface upon loading and regeneration cycles. Also manganese oxide is less readily reduced to the elemental state than iron; hence, the range of reduction potentials for oxygen is somewhat greater than for zinc ferrite. In addition, thermodynamic analysis of the manganese-oxygen-sulfur system shows it to be less amenable to sulfation than zinc ferrite. Also <b>manganese</b> <b>chlorides</b> are much less stable and volatile than zinc chlorides.

40|$|The {{approach}} taken was {{to examine}} the chemical data available on public water supplies based upon sample analyses by the Minnesota Department of Health. To utilize the published data and to establish relationships between some of the parameters, the data available were placed into a computer for easier retrieval. To characterize the quality of the various waters used as sources of supply in the State of Minnesota, a system for comparing existing quality with some accepted standards or criteria was developed. The chemical quality criteria used were based upon the U. S. Public Health Service Drinking Water Standards (USPHS/DWS) published in 1962, the Water Quality Goals Recommended by the American Water Works Association (AWWA), and the U. S.

40|$|The Bureau of Mines {{investigated}} {{the effects of}} HCI concentration and solution temperature on the solubility and crystal form of the chlorides of Co, Mn, and Ni when sparged with HCI gas at temperatures of 2020, 4020, and 6020 C. Increasing HCI concentration in solution caused the chlo-rides of Co, Mn, and Ni to crystallize (salt out) because of the common ion effect. The salting-out crystallization was most effective for NiCI 2, which had a solubility of 0. 7 pct at 2020 C and maximum HCI concentration. COCl 2 salted out to a minimum solubility of 9. 4 pct at 2020 C and 22 pct HCI concentration and increased in solubility at greater HCI concentrations because {{of the formation of}} chloride complexes. MnCl 2 was intermediate in behavior. The effect of temperature on solubility was greatest for CoCl 2 and least for NiCI 2, 15 and 7 pct change, respectively, over the temperature range of 2020 to 6020 C. The salted-out chlorides of cobalt and nickel formed the hexahydrates and those of manganese formed the tetrahydrate in saturated metal chlo-ride solutions at 2020 C and low concentrations of HCI. Increasing the temperature or the HCI concentration caused a 108 s in waters of hydra-tion.
