40|$|ABSTRACT. High-cycle fatigue {{behaviour}} of a ductile {{cast iron}} has been investigated under multiaxial out-of-phase loading. An experimental plan aimed to study the effect of both complex loadings and presence of imperfections in the materials was carried out. It {{has been found that}} the compressive stress decreases the shear stress amplitude limit. <b>Microshrinkages</b> formed in the casting process have also a detrimental effect on fatigue behaviour. Moreover, a hybrid approach which links together the influence of shrinkage porosity size on fatigue limit and multiaxial fatigue strength has been applied. The selected integral approach showed a good agreement with the experimental data for different loading conditions...|$|R

40|$|Casting defects like <b>microshrinkage</b> {{porosity}} or degenerate graphite play a {{major role}} in fatigue behaviour of ductile cast iron. This phenomenon is even more evident in heavy-section ductile iron castings where defects are more frequent and difficult to control. This work is aimed to investigate the fatigue behaviour of heavy-section pearlitic ductile iron castings obtained with different in-mould inoculation treatments. It has been found that the inoculation process modifies the microstructure of the alloy, dimension and morphology of defects. The higher the nodule count, the lower the <b>microshrinkage</b> cavities dimensions. The fracture surface of broken samples has been investigated by means of Scanning Electron Microscopy in order to identify crack initiation points and fracture mechanisms. Metallographic analyses have been carried out to measure nodule count and nodules dimensions and to identify the matrix microstructure. Statistics of extreme values and Murakami approach have been used to analyse the influence of defects on the fatigue behaviour of the materials analysed.

30|$|Nowadays, {{the only}} used {{methodology}} {{to guarantee a}} failure-free casting production (up to a given probability) consists in performing random quality controls (which is a common practice in many other industries). Such controls proceed in the following manner: moulds considered to be representative of a certain production time are extracted and examined with ultrasounds to detect microshrinkages (which is the error targeted by this application). In case it is failure-free, the whole lot is labeled as correct and dispatched. Yet, if a <b>microshrinkage</b> is found, then the failure procedure starts. The first step is {{the assessment of the}} damage, depending on the number of the pieces involved, the position of the defect, its size, and so on, a <b>microshrinkage</b> can be acceptable (i.e., the flaw is minor) and, therefore, the piece must not be discarded.

Note that a variable may represent for instance using one or another product in a certain phase of the process, applying one certain methodology or not, and so on. In this way, if a variable showed the type of cleaning method used and there were 3 choices, the sensitivity module was able to determine which one was the most convenient in terms of preventing the apparition of microshrinkages. That is, the SM evaluated the results obtained by the Bayesian network and calculated the causal relationship between each type of cleaning method (i.e., value of the variable cleaning method) and {{the probability that a}} certain <b>microshrinkage</b> risk appeared. Hence, the SM was able to recommend using only the one that presented the smallest probability, that is, prevent a certain (not desired) scenario to appear.|$|E

40|$|The paper {{presents}} and discusses {{the influence of}} structural characteristics such as content of effective ferrite, size of graphite particles and of <b>microshrinkages</b> on fatigue life of gas nitrided nodular cast irons (NCIs). A classical NCI melt and two synthetic melts obtained with addition of SiC to the liquid metal were produced. The surface of a NCI part may be modified for fatigue-critical applications by thermo-chemical surface treatments, such as nitriding with a corresponding increase of the fatigue limit. To quantify this increase, the rotating bending testing of smooth specimens was used because {{with this type of}} loading the material near the surface is subjected to the maximum stress. The quality of the nitrided layer, which has to be hard, elastic and compact, was controlled by measurement of the dynamical nanohardess according to Vickers. Results of fatigue behavior on the nitrided NCIs show a significant increase in fatigue limit and a different trend in the stress amplitude versus number of cycles to failure (S/N) curves in dependence of structural characteristics. Typically, fatigue endurance is reduced when the size of porosity increases. Therefore, the quality of the castings is related to porosity control. Optical microscopy was used to analyze the microstructure and defects of material after fatigue testing. The statistical method proposed by Murakami, based on the largest extreme value distribution (LEVD) was used to evaluate the porosity size population and to correlate with the fatigue data...|$|R

A second version (reported in [42]), extended the number of symbols at that layer to define risk models, which increased the accuracy of the predictions. This time, the Bayesian network was able to distinguish between valid and not valid microshrinkages. The risk levels modeled the sensitivity of the system and, in this way, helped better classify the outcome of each production situation (i.e., whether a <b>microshrinkage</b> will appear and whether it will be valid or invalid).|$|E

In order to study the influence of this complex 3 D microstructure on fatigue crack initiation and propagation at 250 [*]°C, an experimental protocol using laboratory and synchrotron tomography, finite element simulation and a new digital volume correlation platform have been used.

40|$|A {{study on}} the {{microstructure}} development of as-cast Cu-Mn alloys based around the congruent minimum at 34. 6 wt % Mn and 873 °C was performed. Initially, this was to evaluate the alloy {{as an alternative to}} wide freezing range Pb and Sn bronzes that are plagued with porosity. The shallow minimum and associated narrow freezing ranges around the congruent point result in a completely cellular (non-dendritic) solidification morphology for a composition range ~ 3 wt % Mn about the congruent composition (C c). The degree of cellular solidification was found to depend on the mold material. Increased mold conductivity lead to a narrower composition range of complete cellular solidification. By casting alloys of different compositions into a composite mold, the effect of the mold conductivity allowed an evaluation of the congruent point reported by Gokcen. These results fit well with the constitutional supercooling criterion. While solidification at a point ideally would be planar, this was not observed even with minor deviations from the Cc. An additional study of the microstructure development along the minimum trough in the liquidus surface between the Cu-Mn and Ni-Mn binary congruent points of the Cu-Mn-Ni ternary system was conducted. This study revealed that alloys near the binary congruent minima were more cellular than alloys near the middle of the phase diagram, along the trough. As the composition approached the center of the Cu-Mn-Ni diagram, the morphology became more dendritic, characteristic of an isomorphous system. Even though these alloys did not solidify in a completely cellular manner, they were free of any <b>microshrinkage</b> porosity. The alloys in this study (Cu-Mn and Cu-Mn-Ni) show promise for use in structural applications {{due to the lack of}} <b>microshrinkage</b> porosity, potent solution strengthening of manganese and strong aging response. ...|$|E

Therefore, fracture mechanics investigations were carried out to assess the crack resistance of the alloys AZ 91, AM 50 and AE 42 on the basis of the mul-tispecimen test method. The investigations occurred on SENB- and CT-specimens taken from plate-like components of the same dimensions. The results clearly reveal the correlation between crack resistance and microstructure concerning mainly the influence of the concentration and distribution of intermetallic phases. Because of the cast-induced defects like <b>microshrinkage</b> and gas inclusion the good intrinsic properties of the alloys are not exploited...|$|E

In order to improve the mechanical properties, a new design of test-bar permanent mould was evaluated and studied in this work by computer aided simulation. Numerical simulations have been performed to study the filling and solidification behaviour of an A 356 alloy, in order to predict the turbulence of the melt and the <b>microshrinkage</b> formation.

40|$|The fatigue {{strength}} of ductile iron {{is influenced by}} small defects such as graphite nodules and <b>microshrinkage</b> cavities existing in the structure. Rotating bending and combined axial and torsional fatigue tests were carried out on round-bar smooth JIS FCD 400, FCD 600 and FCD 700 specimens. A criterion for multiaxial fatigue failure of specimen with small defects is presented based on the observational results that the fatigue limit of specimens subjected to in-phase multiaxial stress {{is determined by the}} threshold condition for propagation of a mode I crack emanating from small defects.

40|$|International audienceHigh {{resolution}} synchrotron X-ray tomography {{has been}} used to obtain three-dimensional (3 D) images of the early stages of fatigue crack nucleation in a nodular cast iron. Microcracks were observed to initiate at casting defects (<b>microshrinkage)</b> and graphite nodules. The 3 D observations have shown that the microcracks form in the material ligament comprised between the specimen surface and the defect. The probability of a defect to initiate a crack was correlated with the size of the defect and its position with respect to the surface. This correlation has been explained on the basis of local stress concentrations {{in the vicinity of the}} defect. The 3 D observations of samples submitted to different fatigue cycles revealed that a large part of the fatigue life consisted in the progressive fracture of the ligament. The majority of the observed cracks stopped after this fracture process and, therefore, their size did not exceed the initiating defect size even if the crack seemed larger than the defect on the optical surface observations. Only few microcracks, nucleated on the largest defects, continued to grow with short-crack behaviour...|$|E
40|$|The {{design of}} a {{permanent}} Step mold {{for the evaluation of}} the mechanical properties of light alloys has been reviewed. An optimized Step die with a different runner and gating systems is proposed to minimize the amount of casting defects. Numerical simulations have been performed to study the filling and solidification behavior of an AM 60 B alloy to predict the turbulence of the melt and the <b>microshrinkage</b> formation. The results reveal how a correct design of the trap in the runners prevents the backwave of molten metal, which could eventually reverse out and enter the die cavity. The tapered runner in the optimized die configuration gently leads the molten metal to the ingate, avoiding turbulence and producing a balanced die cavity filling. The connection between the runner system and the die cavity by means of a fan ingate produces a laminar filling in contrast with a finger-type ingate. Solidification defects such as shrinkage induced microporosity, numerically predicted through a dimensionless version of the Niyama criterion, are considerably reduced in the optimized permanent Step mold...|$|E

Nowadays, the Lost Foam Casting process (LFC) replaces the conventional Die Casting (DC) process due to cost reduction and geometry optimization goals. However, aluminum alloy automotive parts produced by the LFC process have a coarser microstructure and more porosity defects than parts produced with conventional casting processes at faster cooling rates. In the cylinder heads produced by the LFC process, the microstructure consists of hard intermetallic phases and large gas and <b>microshrinkage</b> pores. In order to study the influence of this complex 3 D microstructure on fatigue crack initiation and propagation, an experimental protocol using laboratory, synchrotron tomography, SEM images and 3 D Digital Volume Correlation (DVC) has been used.

In the clad welds made by laser, cracks were identified mainly in the heat-affected zone and at the melted zone interface, crystals were formed on partially-melted grains. Cracks of this type were not identified in the clad welds made using the plasma-arc method.

40|$|During {{solidification}} of equiaxed dendritic alloys, the {{rheological behaviour}} changes {{from that of}} a fully liquid to a solid across a range of temperatures and therefore occurs over a significant period of time. Within the solidification range {{there are a number of}} characteristic transitions delineating different rheological responses. In commercial casting processes, solidifying metals usually experience deformation as they are subjected to stresses, thermal contraction, solidification shrinkage or flow. The deformation of partially solid alloys can lead to a variety of casting defects including hot tearing, <b>microshrinkage</b> porosity and many forms of macrosegregation. With the increased requirements of cast light metal components, there is a need for an improved understanding of the phenomena occurring during solidification. The rheology at high solid fraction where hot tearing occurs, usually fs > 0. 9, has received much attention and is reasonably well understood. Further, rheology of globular alloys for semi-solid metal processing with solid fractions fs∼ 0. 5, where the semi-solid behaves as a suspension, is also well investigated. However, much less work has been conducted to understand the rheology of equiaxed dendritic alloys during solidification in order to understand defect formation and its relation to the mechanical response of the alloys. This paper reports on the relationship between rheology and microstructural development during solidification of light metals for intermediate solid fractions where the partially solid alloys behave like granular materials.
