5|$|The {{principal}} {{goal of the}} fat acceptance {{movement is}} to decrease discrimination against people who are overweight and obese. However, some in the <b>movement</b> <b>are</b> also attempting to challenge the established relationship between obesity and negative health outcomes.|$|E
5|$|All {{surviving}} medieval {{accounts of}} the <b>movement</b> <b>are</b> by supporters of reform, who strongly condemned {{what they saw as}} the corruption and religious inadequacy of the secular clergy, but historians in the late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries have increasingly seen these accounts as unfairly biased against the secular clergy.|$|E
5|$|In {{cities and}} villages across Bulgaria, Levski's {{contributions}} to the liberation <b>movement</b> <b>are</b> commemorated with numerous monuments, and many streets bear his name. Monuments to Levski also exist outside Bulgaria—in Belgrade, Serbia, Dimitrovgrad, Serbia, Parcani, Transnistria, Moldova, Bucharest, Romania, Paris, France, Washington, D.C., United States, and Buenos Aires, Argentina. Three museums dedicated to Levski have been organised: one in Karlovo, one in Lovech and one in Kakrina. The Monument to Vasil Levski in Sofia was erected {{on the site of}} his execution.|$|E

5|$|The cantata {{is written}} in seven movements, with a {{symmetrical}} form: {{the first and last}} <b>movements</b> <b>are</b> for chorus and orchestra; the second and sixth <b>movements</b> <b>are</b> recitatives; the third and fifth <b>movements</b> <b>are</b> arias in two parts with da capo repeats only for the instrumental ritornello; and the central fourth <b>movement</b> <b>is</b> an accompanied solo. The metrical English translations below of the texts of the first six <b>movements</b> <b>are</b> by Henry Sandwith Drinker; and that of the seventh <b>movement</b> (chorale) <b>is</b> from the 1722 Psalmodica Germanica of John Christian Jacobi and Isaac Watts.|$|R
50|$|The piece follows {{standard}} concerto form. The first <b>movement</b> <b>is</b> brisk and in sonata form, {{the second}} <b>movement</b> <b>is</b> slow, {{and the third}} <b>movement</b> <b>is</b> fast. The length of the concerto is approximately 29 minutes.|$|R
5|$|Strength {{testing of}} these muscles can be {{measured}} during a neurological examination to assess function of the spinal accessory nerve. Poor strength or limited <b>movement</b> <b>are</b> suggestive of damage, which can result {{from a variety of}} causes. Injury to the spinal accessory nerve is most commonly caused by medical procedures that involve the head and neck. Injury can cause wasting of the shoulder muscles, winging of the scapula, and weakness of shoulder abduction and external rotation.|$|E
5|$|The {{denominations}} in the Latter Day Saint <b>movement</b> <b>are</b> sometimes collectively {{referred to}} as Mormonism. Although some denominations opposed {{the use of this}} term because they consider it to be derogatory, it is especially used when referring to the largest Latter Day Saint group, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), and offshoots of it. Denominations opposed {{to the use of the}} term consider it to be connected to the polygamy once practiced by the Utah church.|$|E
5|$|When both {{rates of}} <b>movement</b> <b>are</b> known, the space {{velocity}} of the star relative to the Sun or the galaxy can be computed. Among nearby stars, {{it has been found}} that younger population I stars have generally lower velocities than older, population II stars. The latter have elliptical orbits that are inclined to the plane of the galaxy. A comparison of the kinematics of nearby stars has allowed astronomers to trace their origin to common points in giant molecular clouds, and are referred to as stellar associations.|$|E
40|$|The anti-globalization <b>movement</b> <b>is</b> {{not against}} globalization, it opposes to the {{negative}} effects caused by globalization. The anti-globalization <b>movement</b> <b>is</b> an expanding social movement of protest. With democratic master framework, the anti-globalization <b>movement</b> <b>is</b> highly decentralized, and its organizations and groups ally loosely. The anti-globalization <b>movement</b> <b>is</b> a disparate and divided movement, and its members have varies motivation and different goals although anti-corporate globalization is the main target of anti-globalization movements. Furthermore, the anti-globalization <b>movement</b> <b>is</b> facing some serious challenges...|$|R
50|$|The {{intent of}} the <b>movement</b> <b>was</b> to obtain public support (money and votes) to elect officeholders who would repeal these liberal statutes. Ultimately, the <b>movement</b> <b>was</b> unsuccessful. In retrospect, the <b>movement</b> <b>was</b> part of the ongoing culture war.|$|R
5000|$|In most of Beethoven's four-movement sonatas, {{the third}} <b>movement</b> <b>is</b> in [...] and in ternary form, {{while the second}} <b>movement</b> <b>is</b> slow and in a {{different}} key from the other movements. In this sonata, {{the second and third}} movements have switched roles, where the second <b>movement</b> <b>is</b> the ternary scherzo and trio, while the third <b>movement</b> <b>is</b> the slow <b>movement</b> in the tonic minor.|$|R
5|$|Most {{churches in}} the {{prosperity}} <b>movement</b> <b>are</b> non-denominational and independent, though some groups have formed networks. Prosperity churches typically reject Presbyterian polity (or governance) {{and the idea that}} a pastor should be accountable to elders; it is common for pastors of prosperity churches to be the highest organizational authority figure. Critics, including Sarah Posner and Joe Conason, maintain that prosperity teachers cultivate authoritarian organizations. They argue that leaders attempt to control the lives of adherents by claiming divinely bestowed authority. Jenkins contends that prosperity theology is used as a tool to justify the high salaries of pastors.|$|E
5|$|Ornamentation {{assumes a}} preeminent role {{in much of}} Sorabji's music. His {{harmonic}} language, which frequently combines tonal and atonal elements, is thus freer than in the music of many other composers and less amenable to analysis. Like many other 20th-century composers, Sorabji displays a fondness for tritone and semitone relationships. The opening gesture of his Fourth Piano Sonata, for example, emphasises these two intervals, and the two long pedal points in its third <b>movement</b> <b>are</b> a tritone apart. However, some people have remarked that his music rarely contains the tension that is commonly associated with very dissonant music.|$|E
5|$|The game {{is played}} from a third person {{perspective}} with the camera at a variable height and capable of rotating 360°, enabling the player to quickly move across the planet's terrain. While the terrain's topology is a torus, the map is locally projected onto a sphere to give {{the illusion of a}} planet. On maps where there is no fog of war, players can see what opponents are doing at any time. Extensive support for 3D acceleration enables the player to view the game in 16-bit or 32-bit colour. The landscape and real-time structure building and follower <b>movement</b> <b>are</b> also shown.|$|E

The sixth and final <b>movement</b> <b>is</b> in multiple cycles of the preceding beat patterns.|$|R
50|$|This <b>movement</b> <b>is</b> a choral song {{of praise}} to Nicolas, briefly recounting several {{different}} {{stories of his}} mercy, charity, and kindness.

50|$|Overt {{orienting}} is {{the act of}} selectively {{attending to}} an item or location over others by moving the eyes to point in that direction. Overt orienting can be directly observed {{in the form of}} eye movements. Although overt eye <b>movements</b> <b>are</b> quite common, there is a distinction that can be made between two types of eye movements; reflexive and controlled. Reflexive <b>movements</b> <b>are</b> commanded by the superior colliculus of the midbrain. These <b>movements</b> <b>are</b> fast and are activated by the sudden appearance of stimuli. In contrast, controlled eye <b>movements</b> <b>are</b> commanded by areas in the frontal lobe. These <b>movements</b> <b>are</b> slow and voluntary.|$|R
25|$|The {{most recent}} National Societies {{to have been}} {{recognized}} within the <b>Movement</b> <b>are</b> the Maldives Red Crescent Society (9 November 2011), the Cyprus Red Cross Society and the South Sudan Red Cross Society (12 November 2013).|$|E
25|$|Although Brethren leaders {{throughout}} New Zealand unanimously {{rejected the}} Charismatic movement in 1964, attitudes today {{are much more}} diverse.

50|$|It is {{important}} that once the <b>movement</b> <b>is</b> selected, it should <b>be</b> completed: uncompleted <b>movements</b> <b>are</b> likely to be unbalanced. Thus a <b>movement</b> should <b>be</b> selected which has a high probability of being completed.|$|R

25|$|In the {{historical}} analysis of most modern movements such as Cubism {{there has been}} a tendency to suggest that sculpture trailed behind painting.
