5|$|The French Republican {{position}} {{became increasingly}} difficult. Compounding problems in international relations, French émigrés continued to agitate for {{support of a}} counter-revolution abroad. Chief among them were the Prince Condé, his son, the Duke de Bourbon, and his grandson, the Duke d'Enghien. From their base in Koblenz, immediately over the French border, they sought direct support for <b>military</b> <b>intervention</b> from the royal houses of Europe, and raised an army.|$|E

40|$|The {{move from}} {{territorial}} defence to ‘wars of choice’ has influenced the domestic politics of <b>military</b> <b>interventions.</b> This paper examines {{the extent to}} which both the substance and the procedure of <b>military</b> <b>interventions</b> are contested among political parties. Regarding the substance, our analysis of Chapel Hill Expert Survey data demonstrates that across European states political parties on the right are more supportive of military missions than those on the left. On the decision-making procedures, our case studies of Germany, France, Spain and the United Kingdom show that political parties on the left tend to favour strong parliamentary control whereas those on the right tend to prefer an unconstrained executive, although with differences across countries. These findings challenge the view that ‘politics stops at the water’s edge’ and contribute {{to a better understanding of}} how political parties and parliaments influence <b>military</b> <b>interventions...</b>|$|R
