For mixture 1, the method was based on isocratic elution using a mobile phase consisting of (Acetonitrile: 3 mM Sodium lauryl sulfate) (60 : 40, v/v) at a flow rate of 1 mlmin− 1. Quantitation was achieved applying dual wavelength detection where <b>mometasone</b> <b>furoate</b> and its degradation products were detected at 247 nm and formoterol fumarate and its degradation product were detected at 214 nm at 30 °C. For mixture 2 and for the forced degradation study, separation was based on isocratic elution of <b>mometasone</b> <b>furoate,</b> its degradation products and salicylic acid on a reversed phase C 8 column using a mobile phase consisting of acetonitrile:water:methanol:glacial acetic acid (60 : 30 : 10 : 0. 1, v/v) at a flow rate of 2 mLmin− 1.

40|$|Background Long-term {{treatments}} with topical corticosteroids, for {{diseases like}} vitiligo, {{are associated with}} the risk of skin atrophy. Objectives Recent studies suggest that administration of topical tretinoin, with a corticosteroid, diminishes skin atrophy without impacting the steroid’s anti-inflammatory effects. Patients and Methods A placebo-controlled, paired-comparison, left-right study was conducted for a period of 6 months on topical tretinoin 0. 05 % and <b>mometasone</b> <b>furoate</b> 0. 1 % with topical <b>mometasone</b> <b>furoate</b> 0. 1 % and eucerin in 16 patients, diagnosed with generalized vitiligo. Clinical responses and side effects were assessed after 3 and 6 months. Results After 6 months treatment with topical <b>mometasone</b> <b>furoate</b> 0. 1 % and tretinoin 0. 05 %, an excellent response was found in two (12. 50 %) patients, a moderate response in 13 (81. 25 %) and mild response in one (6. 25 %) patient. Two patients (12. 5 %) showed side effects. After 6 months treatment with topical <b>mometasone</b> <b>furoate</b> 0. 1 % and eucerin, an excellent response was observed in one (6. 25 %) patient, a moderate response in eight (50 %), mild response in six (37. 5 %), and no response in one (6. 25 %) of the patients. Eight (50 %) patients had side effects. After 6 months treatment, the topical tretinoin 0. 05 % and <b>mometasone</b> <b>furoate</b> 0. 1 % had more efficacy than <b>mometasone</b> <b>furoate</b> 0. 1 % and eucerin (P = 0. 02).

40|$|Objectives. To {{evaluate}} {{efficacy of}} short term intranasal corticosteroid (<b>mometasone</b> <b>furoate)</b> treatment in pediatric sleepdisordered breathing (SDB) patients. Methods. A prospective, observational study was done. A total of 41 children (2 - 11 years old) were enrolled into this study. All patients received 4 -weeks course of <b>mometasone</b> <b>furoate</b> 100 μg/day treatment.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate}} the efficacy {{and safety of}} <b>mometasone</b> <b>furoate</b> nasal spray (NS) {{for the treatment of}} nasal polyposis. DESIGN: Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, multicenter study. SETTING: A total of 24 centers in 17 countries. PATIENTS: A total of 310 subjects 18 years or older with bilateral nasal polyps. INTERVENTIONS: (1) A 200 -microg dose of <b>mometasone</b> <b>furoate</b> NS in the morning and matching placebo in the evening; (2) 200 -microg doses of <b>mometasone</b> <b>furoate</b> NS in the morning and evening; or (3) matching placebo in the morning and evening. All 3 regimens were administered as a nasal spray for 4 months. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary end points were change from baseline to last assessment in physician-assessed bilateral polyp grade and change from baseline in subject-assessed congestion and/or obstruction score averaged over the first month of treatment. Analysis of variance was used for all efficacy end points except for change in bilateral polyp grade, for which baseline polyp grade was added as a covariate to the analysis of variance model to account for any between-group baseline differences in this variable. RESULTS: <b>Mometasone</b> <b>furoate</b> NS doses of 200 microg administered once or twice daily produced greater reductions in bilateral polyp grade at the end point than placebo, with differences reaching statistical significance with twice-daily dosing (P =. 04). Over 1 month, both <b>mometasone</b> <b>furoate</b> NS regimens produced statistically superior improvements from baseline in congestion and/or obstruction score vs placebo (P =. 01 for once-daily dosing; P<. 001 for twice-daily dosing).
