50|$|By {{the mid-1990s}} these units were getting old {{and were in}} need of works attention. By this time, all the {{remaining}} 1959 Stock was concentrated on the Northern line. Minor refurbishment of the stock took place, painting the blue/grey interiors white and replacing some of the seat <b>moquettes.</b> This was done in a haphazard manner, the white interiors becoming very dirty inside by 1998, and with a failure rate that had risen to 1 in 1864 mi, the 1959 Stock was in urgent need of replacement.|$|R
50|$|Bus {{spotting}} is a pastime {{in which}} one seeks to see all buses in a particular fleet or those produced by a particular manufacturer. A person who engages in these activities {{is known as a}} bus spotter, bus fan (popular name in Hong Kong), bus nut (term popular in the UK) or bus enthusiast (although this term can also cover preservationists). Within the bus industry bus spotters are known as <b>moquettes,</b> from the material used to make the seat coverings. Like train and aircraft spotters, bus spotters spend much time outdoors with notepads, cameras or camcorders, monitoring bus routes.|$|R

25|$|Arriva Trains Wales {{services}} are operated by diesel trains only, {{as there are}} currently no electrified railway lines in Wales. As of March 2008, Arriva Trains Wales operates a fleet of 123 diesel multiple units. It also owns some Mark 3 coaching stock, used for locomotive-hauled express services between Holyhead and Cardiff, and has occasionally used hired-in locomotives to run extra services for sporting events. ATW inherited a fleet of Class 142, 143, 150, 153, 158 and 175s from Wales & Borders. The Class 175s were a common user fleet with 11 required by First TransPennine Express each day. In {{the early years of}} the franchise, ATW operated locomotive-hauled services using Mark 2 carriages on services from Cardiff Central to Rhymney and Fishguard Harbour hauled by English Welsh & Scottish Class 37s and FiftyFund Class 50s, and from Crewe and Manchester Piccadilly to Holyhead hauled by Freightliner Class 47s and Virgin Trains Class 57s. ATW built up a fleet of 20 Mark 2 carriages to operate these; all had been withdrawn by 2007, most of them being stored at Long Marston. ATW received 12 Class 150s cascaded from First ScotRail and another from One in 2004/05. In December 2006 another eight were transferred from First Great Western, notionally to provide stock for the Borderlands Line and Ebbw Valley Railway services. Following the delivery of new stock to First TransPennine Express in 2006, all of the Class 175s becoming available to ATW, resulting in 16 Class 158s being released for transfer to other operators. In 2006 heritage unit 121032 was purchased by ATW for use on the Cardiff Bay Shuttle. The unit was overhauled by LNWR, Crewe, entering service with ATW on 17 August 2006. In 2013, the unit suffered an engine failure. This could not be rectified, meaning that the unit was withdrawn. It was then used as a source of spare parts by sister company Chiltern Railways. In November 2007 another 9 Class 150s were transferred from Central Trains. From February 2008 5 Class 150s (150278-282) were subleased to First Great Western. This was later reduced to 4 and then 2, the last returning in 2011. In December 2008 the loco-hauled Holyhead to Cardiff Premier Service was inaugurated. It was hauled by Class 57s on hire from Virgin Trains, initially in top-and-tail formation and later singularly, hauling three standard class MK2s and a MK3 first/buffet. 4 Class 57s were repainted at Cardiff Canton and 6 MK2s were refreshed at Eastleigh Works. Class 67s took over from the Class 57s in March 2012, and MK3s refurbished by Pullman Rail from the MK2s in October 2012. From October 2011 until August 2012, 150280 was subleased to National Express East Anglia/Abellio Greater Anglia. In December 2014, a further MK3 set will be introduced on services from Manchester Piccadilly-Holyhead/Llandudno. All units, bar the 175s, are currently being refurbished in the new Arriva <b>moquette</b> and the new two tone, dark WAG livery.|$|E

2500|$|The Class 220 Voyagers and Class 221 Super Voyagers {{underwent}} refurbishment at Bombardier Transportation's Derby Litchurch Lane Works in 2008/09. This involved {{removing the}} shop, adding 25% extra luggage space and fourteen extra standard class seats to the Class 220 Voyagers and 20% extra luggage space and sixteen standard class seats to the Class 221 Super Voyagers. [...] The interiors {{were given a}} refresh in 2011/12 with the standard class seats recovered in the existing red and blue <b>moquette</b> and first class done with a maroon <b>moquette.</b> In summer 2014, CrossCountry began removing the quiet coach designation from such vehicles in its Voyager sets, believing them to be outdated and take up an excessive amount of space on a four-car unit.

2500|$|The {{interior}} {{appointments to}} the car focused both on driver involvement and comfort. A digital speedometer, surrounded by a tachometer and a boost gauge, replaced the regular analog instrument cluster, and was used until the March 1985 facelift, after which the analog assembly from the regular City was used. Form fitting, leather and <b>moquette</b> bucket seats were made standard as well and a special [...] "sonic seat" [...] was available, which responded to the audio system by a transducer sending sound and vibration to the user through the seat. An extra thick, three-spoke steering wheel was also standard Turbo fitment.|$|E
2500|$|Although the railcars {{had already}} {{received}} high-density seating, overcrowding of the [...] push–pull trains {{was such that}} the transverse seats were replaced by longitudinal ones to give more standing room. [...] Notoriously, the seating provided was similar to contemporaneous plastic stacking chairs in dingy shades of green and orange. In 1980, the driving trailers and connector cars typically had 58 seats, the standard intermediates 70 and the former powered intermediates 66; however, there were minor variations among the individual cars. Yet another modification took place in early 1984, when some cars intended for retention after electrification received [...] "more comfortable seating." [...] This consisted of the then standard class high backed bench seats, seating three and two passengers respectively. [...] The seats were upholstered in blue <b>moquette</b> with a vinyl headrest running {{along the top of}} the bench.|$|E
2500|$|The {{first batch}} of 44 Class 357/0 units were ordered {{at a cost}} of £200 million by Prism Rail in March 1997 to replace the Class 310 slam-door units, and allow the return of 18 hired Class 317 units to their other {{franchise}} West Anglia Great Northern. Construction started in 1999, and they are currently leased by c2c from Porterbrook. They were built in the green LTS Rail colour scheme, painted with a white livery with dark green doors and underskirt (bottom body panels). Their interior consists of dark green seat <b>moquette</b> with alternating rows of large flecks of light blue and light green, light green plastic seat tops with slots in the side for reservation tickets (which are not used) with dark green insets, a stone pattern linoleum floor, purple plastic interior, light green handrails and metal luggage racks with large circular perforations and light green edges, and dark green stickers on the inter-carriage gangway doors. The [...] "door out of order" [...] display is in between the interior door buttons, with the door close button above and the door open button below, unlike in the 357/2 units. These units were fitted with the voice of Julie Berry. See 1973 tube stock for info on her announcement career.|$|E
60|$|She {{was serving}} {{him with an}} after-dinner cup of tea, which she had brought into the drawing-room, and in putting the second lump of sugar into his saucer she paused again, thoughtfully, holding the little cube in the tongs. She was rather elaborately dressed for so simple an occasion, and her silken train coiled itself far out over the mossy depth of the <b>moquette</b> carpet; the pale blue satin of the furniture, and the {{delicate}} white and gold of the decorations, became her wonderfully.|$|E
50|$|When {{the fleet}} {{received}} life-extension refurbishment between 1999 and 2001, the interiors were also refurbished with new seat <b>moquette.</b> The reserved seating cars received red <b>moquette,</b> while the non-reserved seating cars received turquoise <b>moquette.</b>|$|E

50|$|The trains were {{originally}} delivered with seats with a mauve and grey <b>moquette.</b> They formed the letter J for Jubilee (the Northern line's <b>moquette</b> formed the letter N).
