What is the likelihood of having a successful market timing strategy? With an emphasis on modeling simplicity, I calculate the feasible set of market timing portfolios using index mutual fund data for perfectly timed (by hindsight) all or nothing quarterly switching between two asset classes, US stocks and bonds over the time period 1993 [...] 2017. The historical optimal timing path of switches is shown to be indistinguishable from a random sequence.

In Eqs. (5) and (6), r_i is the <b>median</b> of <b>return</b> for asset i, and σ_ij is the semi-covariance of the return for assets i and j. The median–downside risk formulations require that the median and semi-covariance of interval data be calculated as bounds. Bounds on median are estimated using Eq. (8), and the bounds on lower semi-covariance are estimated using Eqs. (7) and (9); these bounds are then used in Eqs. (5) and (6) to solve robust portfolio optimization problem under epistemic uncertainty.|$|R
40|$|The IS {{research}} literature has tested {{the applicability of}} option pricing models to IS projects mostly through detailed case studies. The current study complements this literature by considering a wide set of IS projects and assessing, albeit crudely, their optional value. We test the literature’s assumption that IS projects embed significant optional value. Our research site is a European plant of a leading multinational manufacturer of sophisticated products. The portfolio of current and recent IS projects is studied through a questionnaire administered to all project managers. Seventeen project managers were interviewed concerning thirty-one projects with median cost of $ 325 k and median benefit of $ 1. 2 m. We find strong support to the prediction that IS projects include considerable optional value. The thirty one projects we studied embed forty seven options, many of them with benefits comparable {{to the value of}} the original projects. Only four projects had no optional value. A comparison between a subset of the portfolio and the corresponding scale-up options shows that the exercise price of the options is 20 % of the original projects ’ cost, and that the value of these options is about 70 % of the original projects ’ value. This data also demonstrates the large return, of scale-up options – the <b>median</b> <b>return</b> is 1500 %, five fold the <b>median</b> <b>return</b> of projects. The main practical implication {{of this study is that}} real option evaluation is useful for IS projects in general, and should not be confined to special cases. A further implication is that real option thinking may be of particular value in recognising reduction and deferral options. The project managers in our study found such options difficult to identify and considered their time to expiration as relatively short. Proactive management of reduction and deferral options should thus increase the flexibility and value of IS projects. 1...|$|E
40|$|We {{present an}} {{extension}} of the traditional Sharpe ratio to allow for the evaluation of non-normal return distributions. Combining earlier work in this area with stochastic simulation, we develop a procedure that allows {{for the construction of a}} benchmark for the evaluation of the performance of funds with a non-normal return distribution, while maintaining the operational ease of the Sharpe ratio. Similar to the latter, our procedure only requires the risk-free rate of interest rate, the distribution of the market index and an assumption about the type of return distributions to be evaluated. Unlike the Sharpe ratio, however, we are not restricted to normality but are able to handle any reasonable type of distribution. Since our benchmarking procedure is based on the no-arbitrage assumption, it also provides insight into the conditional arbitrage-free value of one distributional parameter in terms of another. We show that in case of the Johnson Su distribution the relationship between skewness and mean return is more or less flat.

40|$|This study {{identifies}} three {{real option}} motivations for {{foreign direct investment}} (FDI) : Product-related growth options, industry-related growth options, and market-related flexibility options. This study further posits that the real option benefits are better realized by service MNEs, which are less encumbered operationally by hysteresis than manufacturer MNEs. For 235 cross-border acquisitions announced by U. S.

The soft service MNE <b>median</b> <b>return</b> is significantly greater than the manufacturer MNE median AR, and that of basic, electronics and instruments, and consumer products manufacturing firms. The regression results suggest that flexibility options and industry related growth options have a predicted, positive effect on shareholder value for the total sample and especially for service firms which are less subject to the muting effects of hysteresis. Product related acquisitions have an unpredicted, negative effect on shareholder value probably because the “liability of foreignness ” offsets the real option benefits provided by new products...|$|E
