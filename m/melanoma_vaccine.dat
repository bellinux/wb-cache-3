40|$|Abstract Background In {{recent years}} {{encouraging}} {{progress has been}} made in developing vaccine treatments for cancer, particularly with melanoma. However, the overall rate of clinically significant results has remained low. The present research used microarray datasets from previous investigations to examine gene expression patterns in cancer cell lines with the goal of better understanding the tumor microenvironment. Methods Principal Components Analyses with Promax rotational transformations were carried out with 90 cancer cell lines from 3 microarray datasets, which had been made available on the internet as supplementary information from prior publications. Results In each of the analyses a well defined melanoma component was identified that contained a gene coding for the enzyme, glutaminyl cyclase, which was as highly expressed as genes from a variety of well established biomarkers for melanoma, such as MAGE- 3 and MART- 1, which have frequently been used in clinical trials of <b>melanoma</b> <b>vaccines.</b> Conclusion Since glutaminyl cyclase converts glutamine and glutamic acid into a pyroglutamic form, it may interfere with the tumor destructive process of vaccines using peptides having glutamine or glutamic acid at their N-terminals. Finding ways of inhibiting the activity of glutaminyl cyclase in the tumor microenvironment may help to increase the effectiveness of some <b>melanoma</b> <b>vaccines.</b> </p...|$|R

Sixty-six patients who had received <b>melanoma</b> cell <b>vaccine</b> immunotherapy after surgical removal of regional metastatic melanoma were identified. Cryopreserved serum samples from these patients were used in an enzyme-linked immunsorbent assay to determine the IgM antibody levels to GM 2, GD 2, GM 3, and GD 3 prior to <b>melanoma</b> cell <b>vaccine</b> treatment and 4 wk after the first <b>melanoma</b> cell <b>vaccine</b> immunization.

Three immunotherapeutics have received regulatory approval for treating melanoma: interferon-alpha, interleukin- 2, and ipilimumab. The antitumor mechanisms of these products depend on enhancing existing immune responses, including autoimmune effects. The combination of autologous, cytotoxic T-lymphocytes plus high-dose interleukin- 2 is a promising patient-specific therapy, but has limited clinical application. Other approaches include vaccines targeting melanoma-associated antigens, and patient-specific vaccines that utilize autologous tumor. Non-patient-specific vaccine approaches target melanocyte differentiation antigens (eg, tyrosinase, Melan-A, gp 100), antigens identified by cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (eg, NY-Eso- 1, Melan-A/Mart- 1, Mage- 3), and antigens originally identified by murine monoclonal antibodies (gangliosides, gp 97, gp 225). Self-renewing cells in tumor cell lines may represent tumor stem cells, but vaccines derived from allogeneic tumor cell lines have yielded disappointing results in randomized trials. Patient-specific vaccines {{can be derived from}} bulk autologous tumor or autologous tumor cell lines, and intratumoral injections of immunostimulatory fusion products have shown promise. While technically more complex to manufacture, patient-specific vaccines derived from autologous tumor cell lines have the potential to target tumor stem cells and overcome interpatient tumor cell heterogeneity. This article reviews sources of melanoma-associated antigens, costimulatory agents, and clinical trial results for various <b>melanoma</b> <b>vaccines.</b> Comparing Phase II trials is difficult because of the wide range of vaccine strategies and the differences in study patient populations; therefore, randomized trials are necessary to prove the efficacy of such products. Therapeutic vaccines are more likely to enhance, rather than replace, other anti-melanoma immune therapies. In particular, effective vaccines may be synergistic with products that block T-cell immune checkpoint molecules such as ipilimumab and monoclonal antibodies that interfere with programmed death ligand-receptor interactions.

40|$|Immunotherapy of metastatic {{melanoma}} consists of various approaches leading to specific or non-specific immunomodulation. The use of FDA-approved interleukin (IL) - 2 alone, {{in combination with}} interferon alpha, and/or with various chemotherapeutic agents (biochemotherapy) is associated with significant toxicity and poor efficacy that does not improve overall survival of 96 % of patients.

40|$|Background: Recent {{advances}} in the staging and treatment of melanoma were reviewed. Methods: A literature-based review was performed. Results: The current American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) Staging system for melanoma has several drawbacks. Proposed changes in the staging system {{to take into account}} simplified tumor thickness categories, tumor ulceration, and the number (rather than size) of nodal metastases will allow stage groups with more uniform prognosis. The widespread application of sentinel lymph node biopsy for nodal staging allows accurate nodal staging with minimal morbidity. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is a very sensitive molecular staging test that may prove useful for identifying early metastatic disease. There is finally an effective adjuvant therapy for melanoma—interferon alfa- 2 b.

40|$|Background – Canine {{malignant}} melanoma (CMM) is a spontaneously occurring, highly aggressive tumour {{that has the}} propensity to metastasize. Active immunotherapy {{in the form of}} vaccines represents one potential therapeutic strategy for melanomas. Aim of study – To evaluate the influence of Oncept® <b>Melanoma</b> <b>vaccine</b> on the median survival time and quality of life in dogs with canine {{malignant melanoma}} (CMM), treated according to the standard procedure as formulated by the University Clinic for Companion Animals in Utrecht, The Netherlands. Animals – Forty-five dogs with malignant melanoma and a historical control group of 91 dogs with oral melanoma. Methods – All 45 patients were treated according to the standard procedure as formulated by the University Clinic for Companion Animals in Utrecht. A retrospective control group consisting of 91 dogs with oral CMM was used to compare the effects of the Oncept <b>Melanoma</b> <b>Vaccine</b> on MST. Results – For all 42 cases (excluding 3 dogs for various reasons), the median survival time (MST) was 282 days. The MST for dogs with oral melanoma was 242 days, that of the historical control group is 174 days. Vaccinated dogs did not have a significant longer survival time than non-vaccinated dogs (P =. 057). Significant variables with an influence on survival time (ST) within the vaccinated dogs are: oral versus cutaneous/digit melanomas (P =. 032), lymph node involvement (P =. 012), radiation therapy (P =. 023) and the number of doses (P =. 014). Significant variables with an influence on ST within the vaccinated dogs with oral melanoma are: lymph node involvement (P =. 000) and disease stage (P =. 035). Conclusion – No significant longer ST was found in dogs with CMM treated with the Oncept® <b>Melanoma</b> <b>vaccine</b> in the present study. More recent studies have implicated that the vaccine does not significantly improve survival time and therefore will not become available on the European veterinary market for commercial purposes. CMM, however, still is an aggressive tumour with a high propensity to metastasize and therefore research has to be continued. For future studies to adjuvant therapies of this disease, a recommendation is to set up a prospective, randomized and standardized clinical trial with, perhaps, a whole new and different <b>melanoma</b> <b>vaccine...</b>|$|E

40|$|Abstract The {{past three}} decades have seen {{substantial}} research on vaccines {{for the treatment of}} metastatic melanoma and the prevention of recurrence following resection. Despite their enormous promise, the actual results have been disappointing, with several high-profile vaccine clinical trials failing to show a benefit. Nonetheless, enthusiasm for <b>melanoma</b> <b>vaccines</b> remains and has increased with our expanding understanding of the immune response to tumor. Cellular vaccines can be divided into autologous, derived from the patient’s own tumor and allogeneic vaccines. Autologous vaccines have the advantage of containing all potentially relevant tumor-associated antigens for that particular patient. However, autologous vaccines are difficult to obtain from most patients with advanced disease and impossible to obtain from patients who present after resection of all clinically evident disease. No consensus exists for how tumors should be processed, preserved, modified, and delivered to serve as an effective vaccine. The amount of autologous tumor available is rarely enough to produce {{more than two or three}} vaccination doses, and the time between initial tumor harvest and ultimate availability of the vaccine may result in interval tumor progression that diminishes the likelihood of vaccine efficacy. All these drawbacks of autologous tumor vaccination limit its applicability and als...|$|R

40|$|Recently, {{the news}} about <b>melanoma</b> <b>{{vaccines}}</b> has been almost all bad. Available vaccines have uniformly failed to induce significant levels of objective tumor regression in patients with advanced measurable melanoma. In {{a review of the}} National Cancer Institute experience with 440 patients who received a total of 541 different vaccines (most of whom were melanoma patients), only 4 complete and 9 partial responses were seen, for an overall response rate of 3 %.

40|$|Autologous {{melanoma}} associated antigens (MAA) on murine melanoma {{cells can}} elicit a protective anti-tumor immune response following {{a variety of}} vaccine strategies. Most require effective uptake by antigen presenting cells (APC). APC transport and process internalized MAA for activation of anti-tumor T cells. One potential problem with clinical <b>melanoma</b> <b>vaccines</b> against autologous tumors may be that often tumor cells do not express surface markers that label them for uptake by APC. Effective uptake of melanoma cells by APC might be achieved by exploiting the natural anti-Gal antibody which constitutes ~ 1 % of immunoglobulins in humans. This approach has been developed in a syngeneic mouse model using mice capable of producing anti-Gal. Anti-Gal binds specifically to α-gal epitopes (Galα 1 - 3 Galα 1 - 4 GlcNAc-R). Injection of glycolipids carrying α-gal epitopes (α-gal glycolipids) into melanoma lesions results in glycolipid insertion into melanoma cell membranes, expression of α-gal epitopes on the tumor cells and binding of anti-Gal to these epitopes. Interaction between the Fc portions of bound anti-Gal and Fcγ receptors on APC induces effective uptake of tumor cells by APC. The resulting anti-MAA immune response can be potent enough to destroy distant micrometastases.

Syncytia activate macrophages and fusogenic membrane glycoprotein-mediated cell killing very efficiently promotes cross-priming of immature dendritic cells with a model tumor antigen.

40|$|Abstract Background <b>Melanoma</b> <b>vaccines</b> {{have not}} been optimized. Adjuvants are added to {{activate}} dendritic cells (DCs) and to induce a favourable immunologic milieu, however, {{little is known about}} their cellular and molecular effects in human skin. We hypothesized that a vaccine in incomplete Freund's adjuvant (IFA) would increase dermal Th 1 and Tc 1 -lymphocytes and mature DCs, but that repeated vaccination may increase regulatory cells. Methods During and after 6 weekly immunizations with a multipeptide vaccine, immunization sites were biopsied at weeks 0, 1, 3, 7, or 12. In 36 participants, we enumerated DCs and lymphocyte subsets by immunohistochemistry and characterized their location within skin compartments. Results Mature DCs aggregated with lymphocytes around superficial vessels, however, immature DCs were randomly distributed. Over time, there was no change in mature DCs. Increases in T and B-cells were noted. Th 2 cells outnumbered Th 1 lymphocytes after 1 vaccine 6. 6 : 1. Eosinophils and FoxP 3 + cells accumulated, especially after 3 vaccinations, the former cell population most abundantly in deeper layers. Conclusions A multipeptide/IFA vaccine may induce a Th 2 -dominant microenvironment, which is reversed with repeat vaccination. However, repeat vaccination may increase FoxP 3 + T-cells and eosinophils. These data suggest multiple opportunities to optimize vaccine regimens and potential endpoints for monitoring the effects of new adjuvants.

Peptide-specific CD 8 T cells in PBLs were analyzed ex vivo using fluorescent HLA-A 2 /Melan-A multimers and IFN-gamma ELISPOT assays. The vaccines were well tolerated. In vivo expansion of Melan-A-specific CD 8 T cells was observed in 13 patients (1 / 12 after vaccination with peptide in AS 02 B and 12 / 17 after vaccination with peptide in IFA). The T cells produced IFN-gamma and downregulated CD 45 RA and CD 28.

Twenty-six of 32 evaluable patients showed progressive disease, whereas 4 patients had stable disease. The two patients with the strongest Melan-A-specific T-cell responses experienced regression of metastases in skin, lymph nodes, and lung.

40|$|The {{expression}} of melanoma-associated antigens (MAA) being limited to normal melanocytes and melanomas, MAAs are ideal targets for immunotherapy and <b>melanoma</b> <b>vaccines.</b> As MAAs {{are derived from}} self, immune responses to these may be limited by thymic tolerance. The extent to which self-tolerance prevents efficient immune responses to MAAs remains unknown. The autoimmune regulator (AIRE) controls the {{expression of}} tissue-specific self-antigens in thymic epithelial cells (TECs). The level of antigens expressed in the TECs determines the fate of auto-reactive thymocytes. Deficiency in AIRE leads in both humans (APECED patients) and mice to enlarged autoreactive immune repertoires. Here we show increased IgG levels to melanoma cells in APECED patients correlating with autoimmune skin features. Similarly, the enlarged T cell repertoire in AIRE(-/-) mice enables them to mount anti-MAA and anti-melanoma responses as shown by increased anti-melanoma antibodies, and enhanced CD 4 (+) and MAA-specific CD 8 (+) T cell responses after melanoma challenge. We show that thymic expression of gp 100 is {{under the control of}} AIRE, leading to increased gp 100 -specific CD 8 (+) T cell frequencies in AIRE(-/-) mice. TRP- 2 (tyrosinase-related protein), on the other hand, is absent from TECs and consequently TRP- 2 specific CD 8 (+) T cells were found in both AIRE(-/-) and AIRE(+/+) mice. This study emphasizes the importance of investigating thymic expression of self-antigens prior to their inclusion in vaccination and immunotherapy strategies...|$|R
