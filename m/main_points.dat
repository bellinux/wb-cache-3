In the run-up to release, multiple demos were developed, and the team adjusted the game using feedback from players.

Common praise went to the gameplay's mixture of traditional mechanics and new elements, along with its storyline, graphics and music. <b>Main</b> <b>points</b> of criticism were its repetitive late-game stages and elements of its social gameplay and audio.

XIII also won an award for best graphics in GamesRadars 2012 Platinum Trophy Awards. XIII-2 received a positive reception overall, gaining perfect scores from Famitsu and Dengeki PlayStation, and high scores from most western sites. Common points of praise were its non-linear nature, improved battle system and graphics, while the <b>main</b> <b>points</b> of criticism were its story and characters, which were often called weak, confusing or both. Lightning Returns received mixed to positive reviews, with its combat being highly praised, its graphics and time limit mechanic drawing mixed responses, and the story and characters being cited as poorly developed.|$|E

Though former councillor William Harold Clark was urged to run by a group of citizens, Armstrong would be the only nominated mayoral candidate when nomination deadline day came, and thus he was acclaimed mayor; the first occurrence since Kenneth W. MacKenzie was acclaimed in 1900. Amongst his supporters for his candidacy were outgoing mayor Robert Lee and former mayor Charles May.|$|E

5|$|Since no {{documents}} {{exist to}} confirm {{the content of the}} Mise of Lewes, there has been much debate among historians over its content, and the circumstances under which it was written. Noël Denholm-Young, in an article published in 1933, made a conjecture on what the <b>main</b> <b>points</b> of the agreement were. The first point, according to Denholm-Young, was that Prince Edward and his cousin, Henry of Almain, should be given over to the barons as hostages. Secondly, those of the baronial party who had been taken hostage at Northampton were to be released. Thirdly, those who had taken hostages from the royalist party at the Battle of Lewes were to receive ransom. Finally, it was agreed that a committee of French clergy and nobles should arbitrate over a permanent settlement. This interpretation has been largely followed by later historians.|$|E
5|$|The breed {{standard}} {{is a set}} of guidelines which are used to ensure that the animals produced by a breeder or breeding facility conform to the specifics of the standardized breed.

There are four main parts to the standard: the head, the neck, the back and body, and the hair. Below is a concise list of the <b>main</b> <b>points</b> of the breed standard.

In 1975 an adaptation was made by Fred Young and Rempo Urip under the title Bunga Roos dari Cikembang. Although the <b>main</b> <b>points</b> of the story remained the same, several of the Chinese names were Indonesianised.

5|$|Until late 1939, A/S {{work had}} largely been ignored. In the opening {{months of the}} trade defence war, September 1939 to early 1940, three <b>main</b> <b>points</b> arose in this respect. Firstly, the Germans were {{incapable}} of maintaining a sustained anti-shipping campaign owing to {{a small number of}} U-boats. Second, the Air Staff's fear of massed air attacks on shipping did not take place and could be discarded. Thirdly, despite the first two points, losses to Allied shipping from U-boat attack was enough for importance of A/S to increase. The Royal Navy's belief in an ASDIC equipped surface fleet to effectively sweep the seas clear of U-boats proved unfounded (owing to the limitations of ASDIC and vulnerability of surface vessels). Coastal Command aircraft had proven best able to locate U-boats, but the flawed anti-submarine bombs (ASBs) meant that they could not inflict severe damage to enemy submarines.|$|E
5|$|The <b>main</b> <b>points</b> of historiographical {{dispute about}} the battle are {{whether or not the}} Egyptians were {{planning}} to advance northward toward Tel Aviv, and whether or not the battle was one of the turning points of the 1948 Arab–Israeli War. On June 18, after the first truce of the war took effect, Nahum Sarig said in a staff meeting, attended by the Minister of Defense, that at the time the Egyptian plans were not clear, but that now their plans were to penetrate the Negev. Ben Gurion, on the other hand, noted in his diary that the Egyptians were set on taking Tel Aviv and advancing north. In 1958, Major General Yitzhak Rabin addressed the issue; he felt that the Egyptian stop at Isdud was the result of technical difficulties, following fifteen days of continuous movement, including battles along the way. This, Rabin thought, along with ground and aerial counterattacks, eventually delayed their drive on Tel Aviv. Later, he said, the Egyptians tried to make contact with the Jordanian forces at Latrun and, after a failed pincer movement, tried to cut the Negev off from Israel. According to Israeli historian Reuven Aharoni, the battle's glorification and idealization suited the sentimental needs of the Israeli people. He believes that there is still no definite {{answer to the question of}} whether or not the Egyptians planning to drive on to Tel Aviv.|$|E
5|$|Acting on Ridgway's prediction, the ROK Army Headquarters {{ordered all}} units to full alert at dusk on December 31, {{but many of}} its {{soldiers}} were either drunk from the New Year celebration or had abandoned their posts in order to escape the cold. The Chinese artillery units began to shell the South Korean defenses at 16:30 on December 31. The first blow fell on the ROK 12th Regiment of the 1st Infantry Division, due to the unit's positioning as both {{the boundary between the}} ROK 1st and 6th Infantry Divisions and the boundary between US I and IX Corps. Because the river banks on ROK 12th Regiment's flanks were composed of high cliffs difficult for the attackers to scale, most of the regiment's strength were used to defend its center. Upon noticing this development, the PVA 39th Corps decided to use ROK 12th Regiment's flanks as the <b>main</b> <b>points</b> of attack in order to achieve maximum surprise. Following a feint attack on the ROK 12th Regiment's center, the PVA 116th and the 117th Divisions of the 38th Corps struck both flanks of the ROK 12th Regiment. The ROK 12th Regiment was caught off guard and offered little resistance, and within hours the regiment was cut to pieces with a battery of the US 9th Field Artillery Battalion seized by the Chinese. Under the cover of the fleeing Korean soldiers, the attacking Chinese forces then penetrated the ROK 15th Regiment's defense without firing a shot. Desperate to contain the Chinese breakthrough, Brigadier General Paik Sun Yup of the ROK 1st Infantry Division used the division's rear service personnel to form an assault battalion, but the battalion was unable to stop the Chinese advance. With only the ROK 11th Regiment remaining intact by the morning of January 1, the ROK 1st Infantry Division was forced to withdraw on January 2.|$|E
