5|$|Nuttin {{frames the}} cause {{in terms of}} ownership, which has roots in {{economic}} psychology. The endowment effect has found that people ascribe <b>more</b> <b>value</b> to things merely because they own them. Nuttin puts the name-letter effect down to people automatically liking and valuing anything that is connected to them. As such, the name-letter effect {{is just one example}} of a more general mere-ownership effect. In which case, various verifiable predictions follow.|$|E
5|$|The large centre canvas has {{not been}} {{positively}} identified. However both Koch and Campbell believe that a damaged Crucifixion, now in the Musées royaux des Beaux-Arts, Brussels, was probably the centrepiece. Its size (181×153.5cm) is exactly double that of the four wing panels. Campbell believes that the altarpiece was painted on commission for export, most likely to Venice. The altarpiece was probably broken up as large religious works {{had fallen out of}} fashion by the 17th century, and would have had <b>more</b> <b>value</b> as single panels.|$|E
5|$|This nuthatch's {{responses}} to predators {{may be linked}} to a reproductive strategy. A study compared the white-breasted nuthatch with the red-breasted nuthatch in terms of the willingness of males to feed incubating females on the nest when presented with models of predators. The models were of a sharp-shinned hawk, which hunts adult nuthatches, and a house wren, which destroys eggs. The white-breasted nuthatch is shorter-lived than the red-breasted nuthatch, but has more young, and was found to respond more strongly to the egg predator, whereas the red-breasted showed greater concern with the hawk. This supports the theory that longer-lived species benefit from adult survival and future breeding opportunities, while birds with shorter life spans place <b>more</b> <b>value</b> on the survival of their larger broods.|$|E

5|$|While {{financial}} backing was issued by NATO's Mutual Weapons Development Program to support {{development of the}} Pegasus engine, the British government were not forthcoming with funding. While HSA chose {{to go ahead with}} the P.1127 as a private venture, the Air Staff disagreed heavily over what requirements should be set out for a future RAF VTOL aircraft; some officers, such as the Chief of the Air Staff Sir Thomas Pike, advocated simplicity while others, such as the RAF operational requirements division, sought various performance demands of such an aircraft, particularly the capacity for supersonic flight. HSA was also interested in the prospects and feasibility of a more sophisticated development of the P.1127, knowing that a supersonic-capable VTOL aircraft would likely be more attractive to customers, there being a general perception at the time that supersonic aircraft held significantly <b>more</b> <b>value</b> their subsonic counterparts.|$|E
5|$|For the few {{species on}} which data are available, the average {{nuthatch}} lifespan {{in the wild}} is between 2 and 3.5years, although ages of up to 10 years have been recorded. The Eurasian nuthatch has an adult annual survival rate of 53% and the male Corsican nuthatch 61.6%. Nuthatches and other small woodland birds share the same predators: accipiters, owls, squirrels and woodpeckers. An American study showed that nuthatch responses to predators {{may be linked to}} reproductive strategies. It measured the willingness of males of two species to feed incubating females on the nest when presented with models of a sharp-shinned hawk, which hunts adult nuthatches, or a house wren, which destroys eggs. The white-breasted nuthatch is shorter-lived than the red-breasted nuthatch, but has more young, and was found to respond more strongly to the egg predator, whereas the red-breasted showed greater concern with the hawk. This supports the theory that longer-lived species benefit from adult survival and future breeding opportunities while birds with shorter life spans place <b>more</b> <b>value</b> on the survival of their larger broods.|$|E

Coins of this type are of a known purity and are in a convenient form to handle. People prefer trading in coins rather than in anonymous hunks of precious metal, so they attribute <b>more</b> <b>value</b> to the coins of equal weight.|$|E
25|$|Mirabilis is an Israeli {{start-up}} which pioneered {{instant messaging}} (IM) and {{was bought by}} America Online.

Because of the network effect, new IM users gained much <b>more</b> <b>value</b> by choosing to use the Mirabilis system (and join its large network of users) than they would using a competing system. As was typical for that era, the company never made any attempt to generate profits from their dominant position before selling the company.|$|E
25|$|Hoffa {{worked to}} defend the Teamsters unions from raids by other unions, {{including}} the CIO, and extended the Teamsters' influence in the Midwestern states, from the late 1930s to the late 1940s. Although he never actually worked as a truck driver, he became president of Local 299 in December 1946. He then rose to lead the combined group of Detroit-area locals shortly afterwards, and advanced to become head of the Michigan Teamsters groups sometime later. During this time, Hoffa obtained a deferment from military service in World War II, by successfully making a case for his union leadership skills being of <b>more</b> <b>value</b> to the nation, by keeping freight running smoothly to assist the war effort.|$|E

25|$|A common {{aspect of}} {{recovery}} {{is said to}} be the presence of others who believe in the person's potential to recover, and who stand by them. While mental health professionals can offer a particular limited kind of relationship and help foster hope, relationships with friends, family and the community are said to often be of wider and longer-term importance. Others who have experienced similar difficulties, who may be on a journey of recovery, can be of particular importance. Those who share the same values and outlooks more generally (not just in the area of mental health) may also be particularly important. It is said that one-way relationships based on being helped can actually be devaluing, and that reciprocal relationships and mutual support networks can be of <b>more</b> <b>value</b> to self-esteem and recovery.|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} stock market {{indicators}} in the United States {{and other countries}} provide {{an indication of the}} market value of publicly traded firms. The Survey of Consumer Finance in the US also includes an estimate of household ownership of stocks, including indirect ownership through mutual funds. The 2004 and 2007 SCF indicate a growing trend in stock ownership, with 51% of households indicating a direct or indirect ownership of stocks, with the majority of those respondents indicating indirect ownership through mutual funds. Few indications are available on the value of privately held firms. Anderson (2009) recently estimated the market value of U.S. privately held and publicly traded firms, using Internal Revenue Service and SCF data. He estimates that privately held firms produced more income for investors, and had <b>more</b> <b>value</b> than publicly held firms, in 2004.|$|E
25|$|From a more {{academic}} {{point of}} view, Barak Libai, Eitan Muller and Renana Peres constructed a {{research in the}} subject which is {{among the first to}} shed light on the actual value created by word of mouth programs and explore issues such as how targeting opinion leaders creates <b>more</b> <b>value</b> than targeting random customers. In seeding programs, word-of-mouth can gain customers who would not otherwise have bought the product, this is called expansion. However, word-of-mouth can also accelerate the purchase process of customers who would have purchased anyway, the faster the adoption, the greater the profits. These processes of expansion and acceleration integrate to create social value in a word-of-mouth seeding program for a new product. Furthermore, when deciding upon an optimal seeding program, the researchers conclude that “Influencer Seeding Programs” yield higher customer equity than “random Seeding Programs”. Of course, the decision about which program type to adopt depends on how much the company is willing to invest in discovering their influencers.|$|E

25|$|Allied codebreakers read much {{enciphered}} German message traffic, {{especially that}} encrypted with the Enigma machine. The Allies' Ultra programme was initially of limited value, {{as it took}} too long {{to get the information}} to the commanders in the field, and at times provided information that was less than helpful. In terms of anticipating the next move the Germans would make, reliance on Ultra sometimes backfired. Part of the reason the initial German attacks in March 1941 were so successful was that Ultra intercepts had informed Wavell that OKW had clearly directed Rommel not to take any offensive action, but to wait until he was further reinforced with the 15th Panzer Division in May. Rommel received this information, but placed <b>more</b> <b>value</b> on his own assessment of the situation. Trusting that the Germans had no intention of taking major action, the British command did not respond until it was too late. Furthermore, Rommel did not generally provide OKW or the Italian Comando Supremo details of his planned operations, for he thought the Italians too prone to leak the information. Thus on 21 January 1942, when Rommel struck out on his second offensive from El Agheila, Commando Supremo was just as surprised to learn of it as the British were. Ultra intercepts provided the British with such information as the name of the new German commander, his time of arrival, and the numbers and condition of the Axis forces, but they might not correctly reveal Rommel's intentions.|$|E
