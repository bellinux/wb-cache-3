500|$|Bowen has {{described}} Tippett as [...] "a composer of our time", one who [...] engaged with the social, {{political and cultural}} issues of his day. [...] Arnold Whittall sees the music as embodying Tippett's philosophy of [...] "ultimately optimistic humanism". [...] Rather than ignoring the barbarism of the 20th century, says Kemp, Tippett chose through his works [...] to seek [...] "to preserve or remake those values that have been perverted, {{while at the same}} time never losing sight of the contemporary reality". The key early work in this respect is A Child of Our Time, of which Clarke writes: [...] "he words of the oratorio's closing ensemble, 'I would know <b>my</b> <b>shadow</b> and my light, So shall I at last be whole', have become canonical in commentary on Tippett... this [...] statement crystallizes an ethic, and aesthetic, central to his world-view, and one which underlies all his text-based works". Sceptical critics such as the musicologist Derrick Puffett have argued that Tippett's craft as a composer was insufficient for him to deal adequately with the [...] task that he had set himself of [...] "transmut his personal and private agonies into... something universal and impersonal". Michael Kennedy has referred to Tippett's [...] "open‐eyed, even naive outlook on the world", while accepting the technical sophistication of his music. Others have acknowledged his creative ingenuity and his willingness to adopt whatever means or [...] techniques were necessary to fit his intentions.|$|E

500|$|Because of {{its large}} number (17) of {{generally}} short components, Part II {{is the most}} diffuse of the three parts, texturally and harmonically. The narrative is driven largely [...] by alternating choruses and comments from the Narrator, with two brief operatic scenas in which the four soloists participate. Kemp finds {{in one of the}} choruses an allusion to [...] "Sei gegrüsset" [...] from Bach's St John Passion, and hears traces of Elgar in the soprano's solo [...] "O my son!" [...] which begins the first scena. The narrative climax is reached with the [...] "Spiritual of Anger": [...] "Go Down, Moses", which Tippett arranges {{in the form of a}} chorale. This is followed by three short meditations from tenor, soprano and alto soloists, before a possible redemption is glimpsed in the spiritual which ends the Part, [...] "O by and by", with a soprano descant which Steinberg describes as [...] "ecstatic". Part III consists of only five numbers, each rather more extensive than most of those in the earlier sections of the oratorio. The Part has, on the whole, a greater unity than its predecessors. The musical and emotional climax to the whole work is the penultimate ensemble: [...] "I Would Know <b>my</b> <b>Shadow</b> and my Light". Kemp writes: [...] "The whole work has been leading to this moment ... the ensemble flows into a rapturous wordless benediction [...] a modulation leads into 'Deep River'". In this final spiritual, for the first time the full vocal and instrumental resources are deployed. The oratorio ends quietly, on an extended pianissimo [...] "Lord".|$|E
