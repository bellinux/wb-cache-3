Using <b>multiplicative</b> <b>interaction</b> <b>models</b> and regionally aggregated microeconomic data for more than 100 000 individuals in the European Union (EU), it addresses two main questions.

However, several studies have illustrated that interactions between different effects {{should be taken into}} account at stressing environmental conditions to achieve a more accurate description of the growth rate. In this research, a novel approach for modeling the interactions between the effects of environmental conditions on the microbial growth rate is introduced. As a case study, the effect of temperature and pH on the growth rate of Escherichia coli K 12 is modeled, based on a set of computer controlled bioreactor experiments performed under static environmental conditions.

On basis of AMMI II predicted yield, the genotypes OEB 56 and OEB 71 were better suited for early transplanting at Bhubaneswar and early direct-sown condition at Berhampur indicating that the genotype would be suitable for early cropping, but not late cropping. The genotype PES 110 showed better adaptation to both early and late transplanting conditions at Bhubaneswar, indicating that the genotype is suitable for transplanting condition and not for direct-sown condition.

40|$|Abstract. Suicide, {{the tenth}} {{leading cause of}} death worldwide, is a complex phenomenon. Models aiming to explain the {{interaction}} of ambient variables such as socioeconomic factors, lithium content of drinking water and altitude are poorly developed. While controlling for several risk factors, this research bridges two different, but complementary research lines by investigating statistically the relationship on suicide mortality between lithium levels in drinking water in response to altitude above sea level. Besides regression models with main effects, a <b>multiplicative</b> <b>interaction</b> <b>model</b> between lithium and altitude has been developed providing estimates at the district-level for Austria where spatial autocorrelation was accounted for through spatial filtering. The correlation results showed a negative association between lithium levels and altitude. The regression confirmed a negative association of lithium levels and suicide mortality. Altitude was found to be positively associated with suicide mortality. On the other hand, lithium effects on suicide mortality were found to be moderated by altitude. In lower altitude regions the effect turned out to be negatively related to suicide mortality, while lithium had a positive association in high-altitude regions. These results provide evidence {{for the fact that the}} relationship between lithium, altitude and suicide rates is more complex than hitherto assumed. Further research on the effects of ambient variables such as low levels of lithium on suicide is needed and particularly the lithium-altitude interaction is worth further investigation to understand possible underlying neurochemical processes...|$|E
