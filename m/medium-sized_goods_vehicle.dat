40|$|This paper {{provides}} a detailed estimate of fuel consumption rates for six representative vehicle classes on {{different types of}} rural roads in South Africa for use in macroscopic analysis during road planning. The vehicle classes are: Cars, light petrol-driven vehicles other than cars, light <b>goods</b> <b>vehicles,</b> <b>medium-sized</b> <b>goods</b> <b>vehicles,</b> heavy <b>goods</b> <b>vehicles</b> and buses. Measured and estimated fuel consumption rates on different paved and unpaved rural road types in flat, rolling and mountainous terrain are supplie...|$|R
5000|$|... 19 (Heavy <b>goods</b> <b>vehicles)</b> — <b>Goods</b> <b>vehicles</b> with maximum {{gross weight}} above 24 tonnes. Class 2 (light <b>goods</b> <b>vehicles)</b> and class 18 (medium <b>goods</b> <b>vehicles)</b> {{licences}} are issued in addition to class 19 after passing the test.|$|R
50|$|A heavy <b>goods</b> <b>vehicle</b> (HGV), also large <b>goods</b> <b>vehicle</b> (LGV) {{or medium}} <b>goods</b> <b>vehicle,</b> is the European Union (EU) term for any {{truck with a}} gross {{combination}} mass (GCM) of over 3500 kg. Sub-category N2 is used for vehicles between 3500 kg and 12000 kg and N3 for all <b>goods</b> <b>vehicles</b> over 12000 kg as defined in Directive 2001/116/EC. The term medium <b>goods</b> <b>vehicle</b> is used within parts of the UK government to refer to <b>goods</b> <b>vehicles</b> of between 3.5 and 7.5 tonnes which according to the EU are also 'large goods vehicles'.|$|R
5000|$|... 18 (Medium <b>goods</b> <b>vehicles)</b> — <b>Goods</b> <b>vehicles</b> with maximum {{gross weight}} above 5.5 tonnes and not {{exceeding}} 24 tonnes. Class 2 (light <b>goods</b> <b>vehicles)</b> licence is issued in addition to class 18 after passing the test.|$|R
50|$|SG: Government-owned buses {{operated}} by contracted bus operators under Bus Contracting Model. Originally <b>goods</b> <b>vehicles,</b> most <b>goods</b> <b>vehicles</b> were de-registered by 1998.|$|R
5000|$|... 21 (Special purpose vehicle) — Includes street washing vehicles, arrow vehicles, road {{maintenance}} vehicles, ice cream vehicles, etc. A driver has to apply with endorsement from his/her company, {{and holding a}} full licence of class 2 (light <b>goods</b> <b>vehicle),</b> 18 (medium <b>goods</b> <b>vehicles)</b> or 19 (heavy <b>goods</b> <b>vehicles).</b> Class 21 licence has {{to be used in}} conjunction with a class 2, 18 or 19 licence, allowing the driver to drive special purpose vehicles with maximum gross vehicle weight up to the <b>goods</b> <b>vehicle</b> licence the driver holds.|$|R

5000|$|... 20 (Articulated vehicle) — The driver has {{to obtain}} full licence of class 18 (medium <b>goods</b> <b>vehicles)</b> before applying. Class 19 (heavy <b>goods</b> <b>vehicles)</b> licence is issued in {{addition}} to class 20 after passing the test.|$|R
30|$|From the {{aggregate}} analysis (Table  7) emerges {{that the average}} vehicle share decreases with increasing of driving time for heavy <b>goods</b> <b>vehicles</b> (<b>goods</b> <b>vehicles</b> > 18  tons). For the other classes of vehicles we have the opposite.|$|R
30|$|Fatalities by {{traffic unit}} are {{presented}} above in Table 3. When a heavy <b>goods</b> <b>vehicle</b> {{is involved in}} a fatal accident, more than 90 % of killed people are in opposite traffic units. For light <b>goods</b> <b>vehicles</b> this share is around 60 % and for cars around 20 %. These results suggest that fatalities in counterpart units should also be considered when analysing the meaning of cars and especially heavy <b>goods</b> <b>vehicles</b> for road safety.|$|R
40|$|Demand {{elasticity}} {{for petrol}} or diesel {{is an important}} policy parameter, both from energy security and global warming perspective. Despite an abundance of literature on petrol demand, there are few studies on diesel demand, and even fewer on demand by different vehicle types. This paper aims to model diesel demand for different freight duty vehicle types (e. g. heavy vs. light <b>goods</b> <b>vehicles</b> and rigid vs. articulated trucks) in the UK. We argue that the switch to diesel from petrol engines in the light vehicles sectors could have biased earlier petrol or diesel demand elasticities in Europe, and show that it was indeed {{the case for the}} light <b>goods</b> <b>vehicle</b> sector. Results show that both light and heavy <b>goods</b> <b>vehicles</b> have similar income elasticities, although within the heavy duty sector, articulated trucks are more elastic than rigid trucks. Overall, heavy <b>goods</b> <b>vehicles</b> were responsive to fuel prices, but light <b>goods</b> <b>vehicles</b> were not. Within the heavy duty sector, rigid trucks showed statistically significant price elasticity, but articulated trucks did not respond to changes in fuel prices. Our results show that price-based policies to curb fuel consumption from the light or heavy <b>goods</b> <b>vehicles</b> are unlikely to be effective...|$|R
30|$|For Finland {{this would}} drop {{the number of}} {{fatalities}} per year in cars and <b>goods</b> <b>vehicles</b> from 174 to 100, suggesting a safety potential of 74. It {{should be noted that}} in Table 3, the total is not exactly equal to the sum of individual rows. This resulted from a different share of vehicle kilometres among traffic units. Vehicle kilometres per population are higher in Finland for cars and heavy <b>goods</b> <b>vehicles</b> but lower for light <b>goods</b> <b>vehicles</b> compared to Sweden.|$|R

40|$|M. Ing. (Transport Engineering) The {{background}} to goods loading in South-Africa are briefly discussed. Retail are classified and distinction are made between six different retail types. <b>Goods</b> <b>vehicles</b> are also classified and a design rigid and articulated <b>goods</b> <b>vehicle</b> (for retail) are determined. The {{results of the}} surveys at retail outlets are discussed and the characteristics of <b>goods</b> <b>vehicle</b> movement for example trip generation rates, typical total loading times, service times and <b>goods</b> <b>vehicle</b> composition at the different retail types are dealt with. Regression curves has been calculated for <b>goods</b> <b>vehicle</b> arrivals against trading area. Multiple channel queuing theory is {{used to determine the}} loading space requirements for the different types of retail. Theoretical methods. to describe the vehicle track and swept paths during maneuvering is dealt with and turning circle templates for the identified design vehicles are developed. Dimensions of a typical loading area are determined using the templates. The dimensions has also been verified with practical maneuvering tests involving two rigid and two articulated <b>goods</b> <b>vehicles.</b> The maneuvering tests showed that the driving (maneuvering) capabilities of a driver are playing {{a major role in the}} loading area needed. The basic principles involved when designing a loading dock are lastly briefly discussed...|$|R

40|$|A {{simplified}} method for estimating the risk level in unidirectional road tunnels {{is presented in}} this paper. It provides the estimation of the risk level, {{expressed in terms of}} the expected value EV, {{as a function of the}} tunnel length (L), the annual average daily traffic per lane (AADT), the percentage both of heavy <b>goods</b> <b>vehicles</b> (HGVs) and dangerous <b>goods</b> <b>vehicles</b> (DGVs). The method proposed might support Tunnels Management Agencies (TMAs) in making more appropriate decisions about the strategies of traffic control when the risk due to peak hours of traffic volume, including more especially dangerous <b>goods</b> <b>vehicles,</b> is considered to be excessive compared to normal standards of safety in tunnels. In this respect, in order to reduce the risk level, TMAs could permit the transit of dangerous <b>goods</b> <b>vehicles</b> through tunnel by night, and/or under escort, or an alternative route running completely in open air could be tested...|$|R
40|$|The Transport Act 1985, which de-regulated bus {{services}} in Great Britain, simultaneously provided that appeals against {{the refusal to}} grant a PSV Operators Licence, or its revocation, passed from the Secretary of State for Transport to the Transport Tribunal. The Tribunal has excercised this function in respect of <b>Goods</b> <b>Vehicle</b> Operators since 1968, and its decisions have established precedents. The research analyses the decisions in 31 PSV appeals to discover whether the Tribunal has applied these earlier precedents or built up a parallel but independant body of PSV Operator Licensing case law. Specifically, the hypothesis which was tested was that decisions In PSV Operator Licence appeals would increasingly reflect established case law in <b>Goods</b> <b>Vehicle</b> Operator Licence appeals, and that the two areas of law would tend to converge. There are considerable similarities in the legislation relating to <b>Goods</b> <b>Vehicle</b> and Passenger Vehicles Operator Licensing, and also a few significant differences. in particular, PSV Operators {{are not subject to}} the same environmental controls as <b>Goods</b> <b>Vehicle</b> Operators. Extensive textual analysis is made of the legislation, using a relational database, to establish the extent of any commonality. The PSV Operator Licence appeals heard since 1986, dealt with 24 separate issues of common concern to PSV and <b>Goods</b> <b>Vehicle</b> Operators. It has proved possible to isolate these by creating a database of PSV decisions, and to make comparisons with two existing similar databases of <b>Goods</b> <b>Vehicle</b> decisions. Using this data a profile analysis has been made of these issues to describe how frequently they occur, where parallel <b>goods</b> <b>vehicle</b> legislation or precedent exists or if the issue has attracted political attention. A legislative index and tribunal index for each issue has been conslicted to describe respectively the similarities / differences between the underlying legislation and the degree of convergence / divergence between the Tribunal's decisions relating to passenger and <b>goods</b> <b>vehicle</b> licensing. There is a strong correllation between the two indices. The proportion of appeals allowed, dismissed and remitted has also been analysed for both <b>goods</b> <b>vehicle</b> licensing appeals (before and after 1986) and PSY licensing appeals (after 1986) and found to be very similar. There have as yet been no <b>goods</b> <b>vehicle</b> licensing appeals in which a precedent established in a PSV licensing appeal has been persuasive, but the reverse has become commonplace since 1986. The research demonstrates {{that there has been a}} significant convergence of the two bodies of law since 1986, and suggests that there might be even greater convergence of the two systems some time in the future, with the long term prospects of their eventually merging as a single Commercial Vehicle Operators' Licence...|$|R
