5|$|The {{circumcision}} procedure causes pain, and for neonates {{this pain}} {{may interfere with}} mother-infant interaction or cause other behavioral changes, so the use of analgesia is advocated. Ordinary procedural pain may be managed in pharmacological and non-pharmacological ways. Pharmacological methods, such as localized or regional pain-blocking injections and topical analgesic creams, are safe and effective. The ring block and dorsal penile nerve block (DPNB) are the most effective at reducing pain, and the ring block may be <b>more</b> <b>effective</b> than the DPNB. They are <b>more</b> <b>effective</b> than EMLA (eutectic mixture of local anesthetics) cream, which is <b>more</b> <b>effective</b> than a placebo. Topical creams {{have been found to}} irritate the skin of low birth weight infants, so penile nerve block techniques are recommended in this group.|$|E

5|$|Although flat designs {{have the}} benefit of simplicity, other designs such as {{inverted}} pyramids and cones can be significantly <b>more</b> <b>effective.</b> This is probably because the designs shield the condensing surfaces from unwanted heat radiated by the lower atmosphere, and, being symmetrical, they are not sensitive to wind direction.|$|E
