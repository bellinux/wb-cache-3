Other critics wrote that Bolger's demand would imperil the settlement. Bolger did receive support from conservative columnists and was urged to continue his demand. Bolger held firm to his request, and unions - the first was The Michigan Building and Construction Trades Council - did agree to make material contributions towards health care costs to help with the Detroit bankruptcy settlement.

My empirical evidence suggests that prices are not determined by costs and thus inefficiencies must exist given the current market structure. Evidence on special agreements supports the hypothesis that market power is an important factor for price determination. ...|$|R

40|$|This article {{reports on}} a study of trade union {{involvement}} in Sydney Alliance–a broad-based community coalition organising for the ‘common good’. The paper explores 3 main issues: the factors motivating unions {{to get involved in}} community-based organising; whether unions have the resources and capabilities to maintain long-term involvement with organisations outside the labour movement; and whether or not engagement creates the potential for rethinking union organising. Findings suggest that taking part in Sydney Alliance has created opportunities for unions to reflect and act upon internal organisational change to facilitate revitalisation and member participation; to improve the public image of unions and their engagement with civil society networks; and to counteract the loss of political influence with the Labor Party. At the same time, <b>union</b> <b>contribution</b> to the coalition has also proved difficult to sustain, in the main {{because of the lack of}} strategic capability of unions...|$|R
