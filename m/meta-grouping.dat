40|$|We {{present a}} stream {{authentication}} framework featuring preemptive one-time signatures and reactive hash-graphs, thereby enabling simultaneous realisation of near-online performance and packet-loss tolerance. Stream authentication is executed on packet aggregations at three levels ie: (1) GM chaining of packets within groups, (2) WL star connectivity of GM authenticator nodes within <b>meta-groups,</b> and (3) signature m-chaining between <b>meta-groups.</b> The proposed framework leverages {{the most attractive}} functional attributes of the constituent mechanisms ie: (1) immediate verifiability of one-time signatures and WL star nodes, (2) robust loss-tolerance of WL stars, and (3) efficient loss-tolerance of GM chains; while compensating for various structural characteristics ie: (1) high overhead of one-time signatures and WL stars, and (2) loss-intolerance of the GM chain authenticators. The resultant scheme can be operated in various configurations based on: (1) ratio of GM chain to WL star occurence, (2) frequency of one-time signature affixation, and (3) redundancy and spacing of signature-chain...|$|R

It uses two types of comparisons in order to isolate the unique mechanisms characterizing transnational social mobility. One type of comparison is between immigrant minorities and the corresponding majority group from the same country {{and the other is}} between two <b>meta-groups</b> of immigrant minorities: black and non-black minorities.|$|R
50|$|In {{computer}} and video gaming, a clan, community, guild or faction is an organized group of players that regularly play {{together in one}} or more multiplayer games, but is focused on a particular game. These games range from groups of a few friends to 4000-person organizations, with a broad range of structures, goals and members. The lifespan of a clan also varies considerably, from a few weeks to over a decade. Numerous clans exist for nearly every online game available today, notably in first-person shooters, massively multiplayer games, role-playing video games, and strategy games. There are also <b>meta-groups</b> that span a wide variety of games. Some clans formed by groups of players have grown into multi-million dollar professional eSports teams.|$|R
30|$|The {{question}} is whether this explanation holds for immigrant minorities who are not refugees or under an enduring conflict. Thus, the aim here is to construct a third category that stands between the known dichotomy of economic and non-economic (refugee) immigrants (see Chiswick 2000), asking whether minorities succeed in performing social mobility across borders. This study explores this question by investigating migration of 14 groups of minorities from four different regions, Europe, the Middle East, North America, and South America, to the USA. This is {{in order to allow}} thorough examination and comparison. This research uses two types of comparisons in order to isolate the unique mechanisms characterizing transnational social mobility. One type of comparison is between immigrant minorities and the corresponding majority group from the same country. The second comparison is between two <b>meta-groups</b> of immigrant minorities: black and non-black minorities.|$|R
40|$|A {{ubiquitous}} goal in plasma-enhanced chemical {{vapour deposition}} (PECVD) is to describe the correlation between film properties and categorical and quantitative input variables. The correlations within the high-dimensional parameter space are described using a multivariate model. Bayesian group analysis is employed to assess the grouping structures of the set of data vectors. This allows to identify sub-groups or <b>meta-groups</b> of predefined groups of data sets, e. g. with respect to source gases. Outliers can be identified by the necessity to form a separate group. The Bayesian approach consistently allows the handling of missing data. The grouping probabilities were compared with classical approaches such as likelihood ratio tests, the Akaike information criterion and a Bayesian variant called Bayesian information criterion. The method was applied to PECVD data of rare-earth oxide film deposition and hydrocarbon film deposition to study the evidence of grouping structures attributed to categorical quantities such as rare-earth components or source gases and quantitative variates such as bias voltage...|$|R
40|$|One of the {{universal}} features of human sociality {{is the fact that}} our social networks are highly integrated – human societies exhibit several nested social layers including families, bands and communities. Several factors have been identified as creating disincentives for hostile intergroup relations, including economic interdependence (trade), intermarriage (exogamy), cooperative defence against external adversaries (warfare), and lack of patrilocal residential groups (absence of patrilocality with external war). We provide a preliminary test of hypotheses relating to the correlates of amicable relations between communities (i. e. absence of internal war) using the standard cross-cultural sample (SCCS) database. Intermarriage did not have any explanatory power, there is a nearly significant effect of trade on the establishment of intergroup tolerance, and the evidential basis for cooperative defence and patrilocal residence are strong when combed into a multiplicative effect. This analysis is complemented with an exploration of the evolutionary factors underlying elementary forms of <b>meta-group</b> organization in non-human primates. ...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to {{establish}} different socio-cultural models based on lithic raw material sourcing integrated with regional rock art distributions to infer social behaviours within the context of central Iberian Upper Palaeolithic societies. Specifically, we focus on Upper Palaeolithic hunter–gatherer mobility and social interaction in the Côa Valley. This study relies on a knowledge of regional geology and field work to identify the sources of the lithic raw material found at Côa Valley Upper Palaeolithic sites. We expose the context of use and discard of flint, which is naturally absent from the region, and other local materials. From this, we present a GIS based analysis concerning space, time and least-cost paths travelled. This analysis, along with the environmental data available, forms a baseline to evaluate different anthropological models on hunter–gatherer lithic use, mobility, and social networks. We conclude with a three-level model for social interaction, in the context of aggregation activities between different social <b>meta-groups,</b> which involves embedded procurement, long-distance raw material exchange, and symbolic community, reflected in the largest known open-air Upper Palaeolithic rock art concentration. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|R
40|$|Morphogeometric-based metrics are {{not always}} {{appropriate}} to describe high-level contents of images {{as well as to}} formulate complex queries. People often find that two pictures as similar because they share relational predicates rather than objects attributes. In particular, images can be related because they are analogous. Scientists, for example, use analogies to trace art influences across different paints. In this paper, we focus on analogous relationships between groups of objects. The model we propose combines primitive properties by mean of a logical reasoning engine to produce a hierarchical image description. Each picture is decomposed into its spatial relations (physical layer), cognitive relations between objects within a group (group layer), and relations between groups (<b>meta-group</b> layer). This new Analogy Based Indexing (ABI for short) for Content Image Retrieval, allows users to express complex queries such as search for functional associations or group membership relations. A proof-of-concept prototype is also discussed to verify the precision and the efficiency of the proposed system. Furthermore, an embedded visual language enables pictorial queries composition and simplifies image annotation. The experimental results show the effectiveness of ABI in terms of precision vs. recall curve diagrams...|$|R
40|$|People are {{increasingly}} using social media, especially online communities, to discuss {{mental health issues}} and seek supports. Understanding topics, interaction, sentiment and clustering structures of these communities informs important aspects of mental health. It can potentially add knowledge to the underlying cognitive dynamics, mood swings patterns, shared interests, and interaction. There has been growing research interest in analyzing online mental health communities; however sentiment analysis of these communities has been largely under-explored. This study presents an analysis of online Live Journal communities with and without mental health-related conditions including depression and autism. Latent topics for mood tags, affective words, and generic words {{in the content of}} the posts made in these communities were learned using nonparametric topic modelling. These representations were then input into a nonparametric clustering to discover <b>meta-groups</b> among the communities. The best performance results can be achieved on clustering communities with latent mood-based representation for such communities. The study also found significant differences in usage latent topics for mood tags and affective features between online communities with and without affective disorders. The findings reveal useful insights into hyper-group detection of online mental health-related communities...|$|R
40|$|Deficiency in {{traditional}} social policies and public investments has consolidated the increasing poverty of Latin American populations, {{bringing to the}} debate the universal or selective contexts of urban social policies. If on one hand, general social security systems are in crises all over the world, on the other hand, social assistance programs aimed at the poor are nothing new. What is new is the connection of strategies targeting <b>meta-groups</b> as a political expression of urban management. It {{is up to the}} cities, as stages of social struggle, to build a level of socio-cultural integration and the growth of basic quality indicators and income distribution in Latin America. Their contemporary growth and expansion modelis on a different level in comparison to European capital cities which, with their contemporary urban reforms, develop a concept of city as a strategic asset, promoting localized urban interventions that support ways of income concentration in more sophisticated consumption levels or post-industrial services. This paper discusses Curitiba as a paradigmatic example in Brazil, a city that assimilates urban simulations from other cities of the world, without being a city of the world itself...|$|R
40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} was to present the Turkish adaptation of the survey for Middle-School Students’ Attitudes toward Engineers and Scientists prepared by Lyons, Fralick and Kearn (2009) 32 items in a 5 -point Likert type scale. The questionnaire was administered to 707 students receiving education in the fifth, sixth, seventh and eighth grades in state schools in the Ministry of National Education. Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) and Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) were used to examine the structural validity of the questionnaire. SPSS 21 and LISREL 8. 7 software were used for EFA and CFA, respectively. A structure consisting of 22 items and two factors, and accounting for 41. 88 % of total variance was obtained after the EFA. To evaluate the questionnaire’s reliability, Cronbach’s Alpha internal consistency coefficient, corrected-item total correlation and the significance of differences between item averages of <b>meta-groups</b> and subgroups (27 %) were evaluated using t-test. Cronbach’s alpha internal consistency coefficient was found to be. 83 for the overall questionnaire. As a result of the study, the Turkish adaptation of the questionnaire, prepared for determination of secondary school students’ attitudes towards scientists and engineers, was conducted and a valid and reliable measurement tool was obtained...|$|R
40|$|International audienceOsteosarcoma (OS) is {{the most}} common bone sarcoma in adolescents, and has poor prognosis. A vicious cycle is {{established}} between OS cells and their microenvironment in order to facilitate the tumor growth and cell spreading. The present work aims to better characterize the tumor microenvironment in OS in order to identify new therapeutic targets relating to metastatic process. Tissue microarrays of pre-chemotherapy OS biopsies were used for characterizing the tumor niche by immunohistochemistry. Parameters studies included: immune cells (M 1, M 2 -subtypes of tumor-associated macrophages (TAM); T, B lymphocytes; mast cells), vascularization (endothelial, perivascular cells), OPG, RANKL, and mitotic index. Two groups of patients were defined, 22 localized OS (OS Meta-) and 28 metastatic OS (OS Meta+). The OS <b>Meta-group</b> was characterized by a higher infiltration of INOS + M 1 -polarized macrophages and upregulated OPG immunostaining. OS Meta+ tumors showed a significant increase in CD 146 + cells. INOS + M 1 -macrophages were correlated with OPG staining, and negatively with the presence of metastases. CD 163 + M 2 -macrophages were positively correlated with CD 146 + cells. In multivariate analysis, INOS and OPG were predictive factors for metastasis. An older age, non-metastatic tumor, good response to chemotherapy, and higher macrophage infiltration were significantly associated with better overall survival. TAMs are associated with better overall survival and a dysregulation of M 1 /M 2 polarized-macrophages in favor of M 1 subtype was observed in non-metastatic OS...|$|R
40|$|The portability, {{connectivity}} {{and wireless}} mobility {{of the new}} generation of camera phones, their ubiquitousness and user-friendliness, have advanced a new kind of constant alertness to the visual noteworthy. Wavering between the individual and the collective, the private and the public, these camera phone images lose the authorial signature of the individual author as they travel in the ether migrating from one social networking platform, moblog, group, and <b>meta-group</b> to another. Yet, it is this mobility and connectivity that may allow personal snaps to be viewed against a complex web of cultural interrelations, whose structure departs from the mainstream institutional power-knowledge model and can, in specific circumstances, form the intellectual basis for what Jacques Rancière sees as the potential for the “emancipation of the spectator”. As online counter culture is gradually infiltrated into the mainstream, such imagery also finds outlets outside the online realm: having captured the imagination of artists and curators alike, public generated snaps have, in recent years, been featuring in an increasing number of photography and art exhibitions. This paper discussed the abovementioned associations around the re/de/contextualization of public-generated snaps in art contexts, examining how their subjective, intimate nature, their amateurism and aesthetic of the anaesthetic, contribute to their social currency as authentic, ‘true-to-life’ records of the everyday. This analysis was pursued through contrasting case studies of artistic and curatorial practices embracing such imagery and the issues of originality, ownership, authorship, and intentionality they raise...|$|R
