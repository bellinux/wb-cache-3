40|$|AbstractIntroduction: <b>Major</b> <b>connectors</b> {{are used}} with {{removable}} partial dentures to connect all other parts to the denture. The use of titanium to fabricate removable partial dentures has recently increased. Objective: This study aimed {{to assess the}} effect of the titanium alloy and chrome cobalt to fabricate connectors of removable partial dentures on tooth mobility, bone loss and tissue reaction. Materials and methods: A non-randomized clinical-controlled trial was conducted at the Dental Clinic, Faculty of Dentistry at Al-Azhar University-Assiut Branch, from January 2013 to January 2015. Eighty patients were classified into two groups, which were provided with removable partial dentures comprising titanium alloy and chrome cobalt connectors respectively. Patientsâ€™ demographic and clinical data (tooth mobility, bone loss and tissue reaction) were evaluated via the questionnaires, and clinical observations by qualified medical dentists with panoramic X-rays. Both groups were examined at 6, 12, 18 and 24 months. Results: Tooth mobility, in all directions, ranged between 0 mm at enrollment and 0. 10 mm in the titanium alloy group and ranged from 0 mm to 0. 20 mm in the chrome cobalt group. The difference in tooth mobility between the two groups {{at the end of the}} study was statistically significant (p= 0. 04). The bone loss ranged from 0 mm at enrollment and 0. 05 mm in the titanium alloy group and ranged from 0. 04 mm to 0. 15 mm in the chrome cobalt group. The difference in bone loss between the two groups was statistically significant (p= 0. 01). The tissue reaction in the titanium alloy group ranged from 0 to 0. 02, and it ranged from 0 to 0. 16 in the chrome cobalt group. The difference in tissue reaction was statistically significant (p= 0. 02). Conclusion: Clinical observations suggest that titanium alloy is more suited than chrome cobalt for fabricating the <b>major</b> <b>connectors</b> in removable partial dentures...|$|R

40|$|Casting {{removable}} partial dentures (RPDs) without completely {{filling the}} sprue channels and generating casting buttons {{would result in}} saving metal and making more defect-free castings. This investigation tested whether a complete and sound RPD casting can be obtained when a minimal amount of metal is used, A factorial experimental design, three spruing methods, two metal feeding directions, and two different weights of metal were used to cast 60 Kennedy class II, modification 1 RPDs. The metal used to cast each framework was either enough {{to result in a}} full button or in no button. Visual and radiographic examinations and counting of defects were made by two independent operators who were unaware of the spruing method, feeding direction, or amount of metal used to make the framework. The completeness of the casting and the presence of porosities were evaluated for clasps, <b>major</b> <b>connectors,</b> and meshworks. The use of minimal metal to cast RPDs was equally as successful as using enough for a full button, provided that the appropriate spruing arrangement and metal feeding direction were chosen. Indirect metal feeding for maxillary RPDs was successful with the proper spruing arrangement. King Saud Universit...|$|R

40|$|Removable partial {{dentures}} (RPDs) (conventional and implant-supported) {{treatment is}} considered a viable option to replace missing teeth as inexpensively as possible, but it has limitations. Objectives: This study reports the effect of gender and location (maxilla vs. mandible) on the clinical performance of removable partial dentures (RPDs). Materials and Methods: A total of 100 Patients who had RPDs delivered between 1990 - 1995 were evaluated. A 4 -point scoring system {{was used to assess}} seventeen criteria. These criteria include acceptance, stability, support, retention, adaptation, occlusion, integrity, and design of the pros-theses, rest and rest seat preparation, occlusal wear, esthetics, phonetics, tissue condition, mobility of abutments, gingival and plaque indices. The data were analyzed using Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney U non-parametric statistical tests. Results: The results showed that acceptance of RPDs was rated the lowest. Other reasons for failure were poor retention, lack of integrity of the prostheses and inadequate adaptation. Retention and design of <b>major</b> <b>connectors</b> attributed to Mandibular RPD failure. Success rate of 75 % was observed in male compared with 67. 2 % for female. Maxillary RPDs showed a higher success rate (78 %) compared with the mandibular (70. 1 %). No significant statistical difference in Alpha scores between female and male patients and between maxillary and mandibular RPDs (p < 0. 05).

40|$|Little {{is known}} about the {{outcomes}} of treatment and patientâ€™s satisfaction with removable partial dentures in adult Croatian population. Therefore patientâ€™s satisfaction with their partial dentures in relation to some socio-economic variables was studied. Patientâ€™s satisfaction with denture retention, speech, aesthetics, comfort of wearing dentures, chewing ability was also studied in relation to different denture classification, construction, material, denture base shape (<b>major</b> <b>connectors),</b> denture support and the number of missing teeth. A total of 165 patients, 59 males and 105 females between 38 and 87 years took part in this study. A questionnaire, devised for a purpose of the study, was divided into three parts. In the first part, patients answered questions about age, gender, marital status, education, general health, socio-economic status, self-supporting life, period of tooth loss and number of previous denture experiences and in the second part, patients graded their partial dentures, depending on the level of satisfaction, by using a scale from 1 to 5. In the third part a dentist determined Kennedy classification and their modifications, denture material and denture support, denture base shape and the number of missing teeth and graded a denture construction. Influence of these factors on patientâ€™s satisfaction was analyzed. A majority of the examined patients were satisfied with the partial prosthesis, but a small amount of dissatisfaction existed. More then half of them scored all the examined parameters to the best score category. Considering chewing with lower partial dentures, women were more satisfied than men (p < 0. 05). Patients with more missing teeth gave lower grades for the comfort of wearing dentures (p< 0. 05). Patients of higher education gave lower grades (p< 0. 05) for the aesthetics. Patients were not satisfied with speech if the dentist graded a construction of alower partial denture low (p< 0. 05). Dissatisfaction was related to mastication, aesthetics, number of missing teeth and ability of speech. These findings can aid a clinician in discussing a treatment plan and help a patient understand the risk of dissatisfaction in the presence of certain factors...|$|R

A multiple-jointed connector assembly is a connector assembly where {{there is more than one}} closely spaced connection joining different fibers together. An example of a multiple-jointed connector assembly is a connector assembly that uses the stub-fiber type of connector plug.|$|R
40|$|This article {{examines}} parent perceptions of parapro-fessional roles and employment conditions. Nineteen mothers of 23 children who received {{special education services}} in general education classrooms with support from paraprofessionals participated in focus group in-terviews. This exploratory study revealed that these mothers identified closely with paraprofessionals and be-lieved that they were compassionate, dedicated people who functioned in four <b>major</b> roles: <b>connector,</b> team member, instructor, physical caregiver/health needs pro-vider. Participants also identified problems associated with paraprofessional employment including the lack of training, low pay, and {{lack of respect for}} the position, resulting in high levels of turnover. Respect for parapro-fessionals was ofparticular concern to the mothers, who believed that the respect accorded to paraprofessionals reflected the respect accorded to their children. DESCRIPTORS: paraprofessionals, parents, one-to-one assistance A growing trend toward inclusive education of chil-dren with disabilities has been seen in recent years. Increasingly, the literature shows that parents request inclusion for their children and that they believe that"a reasonably good inclusion program today is preferable to a perfect inclusion program tomorrow " (Marks, Schrader, & Levine, 1999, p. 316). The 1997 amend-ments to IDEA place a greater emphasis on inclusive opportunities as well. These amendments require that supplementary aids and services be provided in general education classes and specifically considered by teams that include parents while developing the individual-ized education plan (IEP) (Etscheidt & Bartlett, 1999). This guarantees parents {{an active role in the}} decision making process for the education of their children. The practice of employing paraprofessionals to facili-tate inclusive education of students with disabilities in general education has emerged out of perceived neces-sity and parental pressure (French & Pickett, 1997...|$|R
