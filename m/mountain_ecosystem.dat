40|$|While pitfall {{trapping}} {{is generally}} accepted {{as the standard}} method for sampling carabid beetles, this method has rarely been used in <b>mountain</b> <b>ecosystems,</b> mainly due to the high labour intensity it involves.

50|$|The Lodgepole Chipmunk is an omnivore, {{feeding on}} a {{multiple}} of both animal (mammals, birds, bird eggs, small invertebrates arthropods, and insects) and plant matter (leaves, flowers, pollen, forbs, fungi, and seeds). Like most rodents, this chipmunk engages in the foraging behavior of caching and storing food {{in order to survive}} the long winter hibernation. The Lodgepole Chipmunk is also known to serve two main ecological roles. Through its diet, this chipmunk ingests seeds, which are not broken down through the digestive process, and the seeds are then defecated and dispersed throughout its habitat, spreading variation and enhancing the range o f the seed-producing plant. Similarly, the Lodgepole Chipmunk also disperses ectomycorrhizal fungi. This kind of fungi is important to forests, allowing for trees to subsist by increasing their water and nutrient gains. By dispersing spores, seeds, and pollen, the Lodgepole Chipmunk {{plays an important role in}} the maintenance of the forest and <b>mountain</b> <b>ecosystem.</b>|$|E
50|$|After joining HNB Garhwal University, Purohit {{initiated}} work on {{high altitude}} plants.

The work conducted at this centre has revealed that high altitude species are less sensitive than the low altitude species to the environmental stresses. The germination studies of alpine plants made by Purohit and his associates have helped in germinating many endangered species and establishing them in nature in the alpine field station at Tungnath. He and his associates have come up with the cultivation technology for Aconites, alpine and sub-alpine plants of very high medicinal value, where yield is increased 10 to 12 fold.
