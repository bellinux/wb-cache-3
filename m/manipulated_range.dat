40|$|Abstract− − Range {{images have}} a key role for sur-face mapping in robot {{navigation}} and control. The robot control system can easily identify objects and obstacles by <b>manipulating</b> <b>range</b> images, however most of these range images are acquired in perspec-tive projection, thus object position may be incorrect due to distortion caused by the perspective effect. This paper proposes an easy and efficient way to acquire range images, with a single CCD camera in conjunction with laser stripes and afterwards these range images are orthorectified {{to turn out to}} sur-face maps. These orthorectified range images are very useful for biped and quadruped robots, orien-tating them when navigating among obstacles while robot manipulators can use them to find objects by setting up their joints and picking tools.

40|$|Indexing and {{retrieval}} {{techniques for}} large text databases are well developed, {{but most of}} the techniques developed to date assume that the text to be indexed has little or no structure. With the growth in the use of sophisticated markup languages for text, a database system for structured documents should use, not just document content, but structural information and attributes, and should support queries on content, structure and attributes. In this paper we review and compare two recent approaches for accessing document collections. For one of the approaches, position-based indexing, queries are resolved by <b>manipulating</b> <b>ranges</b> of word o sets while for the other, based on a path model, the position of a word is represented in terms of the structural components that enclose it.

40|$|Abstract. We {{introduce}} MEMORAX, a {{tool for}} the verification of control state reachability (i. e., safety properties) of concurrent programs <b>manipulating</b> finite <b>range</b> and integer variables and running on top of weak memory models. The verification task is non-trivial as it involves exploring state spaces of arbitrary or even infinite sizes. Even for programs that only <b>manipulate</b> finite <b>range</b> variables, the sizes of the store buffers could grow unboundedly, and hence the state spaces {{that need to be}} explored could be of infinite size. In addition, MEMORAX in-corporates an interpolation based CEGAR loop to make possible the verification of control state reachability for concurrent programs involving integer variables. The reachability procedure is used to automatically compute possible memory fence placements that guarantee the unreachability of bad control states under TSO. In fact, for programs only involving finite range variables and running on TSO, the fence insertion functionality is complete, i. e., it will find all minimal sets of memory fence placements (minimal in the sense that removing any fence would result in the reachability of the bad control states). This makes MEMORAX the first freely available, open source, push-button verification and fence insertion tool for programs running under TSO with integer variables. ...|$|R

Automatically checking such properties for these programs is beyond the capabilities of current verification techniques. For this purpose, we describe an original logic that mixes two sorts of variables: those shared and manipulated by the concurrent processes, and ghost variables refering to the number of processes satisfying predicates on shared and local program variables. We then combine existing works on counter, predicate, and constrained monotonic abstraction and nest two cooperating counter example based refinement loops for establishing correctness (safety expressed as non reachability of configurations satisfying formulas in our logic). We have implemented a tool (Pacman, for predicated constrained monotonic abstraction) and used it to perform parameterized verification for several programs whose correctness crucially depends on precisely capturing the number of synchronizing processes. ...|$|R

The relationship between the average wearer prickle score and known properties of constituent fibre, yarns and fabrics and fabric evaluation using the Wool ComfortMeter (WCM) was determined using linear modelling. After log transformation, the best model accounted for 87. 7 % of the variance. The major share of variation {{could be attributed to}} differences between mean fibre diameter (MFD) and WCM values. Low prickle scores were linearly associated with lower MFD, lower WCM and lower yarn linear density. There was an indication that yarn twist affected prickle scores and that fabrics composed of cotton evoked less prickle.

To examine the nature of the effect of interletter spacing in visual-word recognition (i. e., affecting encoding processes vs. quality of information), we fitted Ratcliff’s (1978) diffusion model to a lexical decision experiment in which we <b>manipulated</b> a <b>range</b> of five interletter spacings (from condensed [– 0. 5] to expanded [1. 5]). The results showed an effect of interletter spacing on latencies to word stimuli, which reflected a linear decreasing trend: Words presented with a more expanded interletter spacing were identified more rapidly than those with a narrower spacing. Fits from the diffusion model revealed that interletter spacing produces small changes in the encoding process rather than changes in the quality of lexical information. This finding opens a new window of opportunities to examine the role of interletter spacing in more applied settings...|$|R
40|$|We {{address the}} problem of {{automatically}} establishing correctness for programs generating an arbitrary number of concurrent processes and <b>manipulating</b> variables <b>ranging</b> over an infinite domain. The programs we consider can make use of the shared variables to count and synchronize the spawned processes. This allows them to implement intricate synchronization mechanisms, such as barriers. Automatically verifying correctness, and deadlock freedom, of such programs is beyond the capabilities of current techniques. For this purpose, we make use of counting predicates that mix counters referring to the number of processes satisfying certain properties and variables directly manipulated by the concurrent processes. We then combine existing works on counter, predicate, and constrained monotonic abstraction and build a nested counter example based refinement scheme for establishing correctness (expressed as non-reachability of configurations satisfying counting predicates formulas). We have implemented a tool (Pacman, for predicated constrained monotonic abstraction) and used it to perform parameterized verification on several programs whose correctness crucially depends on precisely capturing the number of processes synchronizing using shared variables.

30|$|To {{directly}} {{test this}} claim, Benjamin, Tullis, and Lee (2013) conducted a recognition experiment with words and <b>manipulated</b> the <b>range</b> {{of the scale}} for the recognition decision between subjects. Subjects provided recognition judgments using only two-value (i.e., binary yes/no) or four- or eight-value scales. On the four- and eight-value scales, the lowest value was labeled “sure no,” whereas the highest value was labeled “sure yes.” Benjamin et al. concluded that the more alternatives given, the poorer the performance: “Rating scales with more options led to lower estimates of recognition than did scales with fewer options” (p. 1601) (but see Kellen, Klauer, & Singmann, 2012). However, one important difference between the procedure in this experiment and that in most confidence-accuracy research is that, in the latter research, experimenters first asked subjects to make a binary yes/no recognition decision and then rated their confidence on a scale for that decision. Thus, in Benjamin et al.’s (2013) terms, the initial judgment is always on a binary scale. Still, this research does provide a reason to expect that in other settings subjects will not use widely varying confidence scales in the same way.|$|R

We hypothesised that decomposing litter improves {{the performance of}} a variety of tropical tree seedlings, and that this litter effect varies depending on the species of litter present in litter mixtures. We addressed these hypotheses with a large pot experiment <b>manipulating</b> a <b>range</b> of different litter mixtures of contrasting quality and using seedlings of four tree species from the Amazonian forest of French Guiana. In contrast to our initial hypothesis, decomposing litter had either neutral or negative impacts on seedling growth, despite strongly different growth rates, biomass allocation patterns and leaf and root traits among tree species. Tree species varied in their responses to litter additions, which were further modified by species identity of the added litter. Our data show litter species-specific effects on growth, biomass allocation and leaf and root traits of tropical tree seedlings. These results suggest that a net nutrient release from decomposing litter does not necessarily improve tree seedling growth, even under nutrient-limiting conditions. In conclusion, litter layer composition may affect seedling establishment and recruitment success beyond litter-derived plant nutrient availability, which may contribute to tree species composition and dynamics in the studied tropical forest...|$|R
