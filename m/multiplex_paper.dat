Today, because of their high technicality and cost, nucleic acid amplification tests (NAAT) are of benefit only to {{a small fraction of}} developing countries population. By reducing costs, simplifying procedures and enabling <b>multiplexing,</b> <b>paper</b> microfluidics has the potential to considerably facilitate their accessibility. However, most of the studies performed in this area have not quit the lab. This letter brings NAAT on paper closer to the field, by using clinical samples and operating in a resource-limited setting.

40|$|Recently, {{pathogenic}} microorganisms have aroused wide {{public concern}} for their potential to cause serious diseases in humans, animals and agricultural crops. Although DNA microarrays are commonly used for pathogen detection, the approach is sophisticated, time-consuming and requires expensive equipment, limiting its application in resource-poor settings. Herein we present a novel, low-cost, paper-based microfluidic approach for multiplexed DNA detection of Giardia Lamblia, S. aureus, and Entamoeba, by “on-chip” isothermal DNA amplification and hybridization. Paper-based microfluidics offers a novel, sensitive and low-cost alternative for Point-of-Care Diagnostics for the Developing Countries. The project described utilizes Loop-mediated Isothermal Amplification (LAMP), a novel isothermal DNA amplification method using six primers to amplify a target DNA sequence specific to each pathogen. ssDNA probes covalently-immobilized at three separate detection zones then bind their complementary CY 3 -labeled amplification products. Currently, the flow speed in our paper-based device has been optimized to reach the detection zones quickly after amplification and with as little as 15 µl of reagents. The integration of both the amplification and hybridization steps in one <b>multiplexed</b> <b>paper</b> device will allow for on-site testing of pathogens with minimal device fabrication costs, less reagent consumption, no need for expensive laboratory equipment, and minimal expertise requirements to retrieve highly-sensitive genetic testing.

40|$|The use of <b>multiplexed</b> <b>paper</b> sensors {{for health}} and {{environmental}} monitoring applications continues to rise. Multiplexed devices are capable of detecting multiple disease biomarkers or contaminants from a single sample. These devices make testing simpler, faster and at lower cost. However, challenges, such as the misinterpretation of test results, difficulty in signal quantitation and cross reactivity continue to exist. Misinterpretation is often due {{to the presence of}} multiple test lines (TLs), especially since the standard is that two lines indicate a positive test result (such as the home pregnancy test). Weak signals exacerbate the problem further, being misinterpreted as false positive or negative signals. In this work and that of others [1], the signal intensity of TLs on a multiplex lateral flow test were found to reduce the further away it is positioned from the colorimetric reporter element, regardless of the analyte concentration. This implies that the detection/test line placed furthest away on such devices may be at risk of developing a false negative test result. This could have negative consequences when such tests are used to diagnose illnesses or pathogens. This work studies the phenomenon of weakening signal intensities on multiplexed sensors. Little work has been found on this subject matter [2, 3]. A colorimetric paper based immuno-sensor for Salmonella (Fig. 1 B) and a multiplexed sensor for salmonella (SAL) and Escherichia coli (E. coli- EC) (Fig. 1 C) was used as a case study.
