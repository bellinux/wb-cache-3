50|$|His {{papers on}} inbreeding, mating systems, and genetic drift {{make him a}} {{principal}} founder of theoretical population genetics, along with R. A. Fisher and J. B. S. Haldane. Their theoretical work is {{the origin of the}} modern evolutionary synthesis or neodarwinian synthesis. Wright was the inventor/discoverer of the inbreeding coefficient and F-statistics, standard tools in population genetics. He was the chief developer of the mathematical theory of genetic drift, which is sometimes known as the Sewall Wright effect, cumulative stochastic changes in gene frequencies that arise from random births, deaths, and <b>Mendelian</b> <b>segregations</b> in reproduction. In this work he also introduced the concept of effective population size. Wright was convinced that the interaction of genetic drift and the other evolutionary forces was important in the process of adaptation. He described the relationship between genotype or phenotype and fitness as fitness surfaces or evolutionary landscapes. On these landscapes mean population fitness was the height, plotted against horizontal axes representing the allele frequencies or the average phenotypes of the population. Natural selection would lead to a population climbing the nearest peak, while genetic drift would cause random wandering.|$|R

Several attempts have since tried to test his <b>Mendelian</b> two-loci/two-alleles <b>segregation</b> hypothesis, but only recently a single gene crucial for sex determination in bees was evidenced to be sex-specifically spliced and also caste-specifically expressed in a Melipona species. Since alternative splicing is frequently associated with epigenetic marks, and the epigenetic status {{plays a major role}} in setting the caste phenotype in the honey bee, we investigated here epigenetic chromatin modification in the stingless bee Melipona scutellaris. We used an ELISA-based methodology to quantify global methylation status and western blot assays to reveal histone modifications. The results evidenced DNA methylation/demethylation events in larvae and pupae, and significant differences in histone methylation and phosphorylation between newly emerged adult queens and workers. The epigenetic dynamics seen in this stingless bee species represent a new facet in the caste determination process in Melipona bees and suggest a possible mechanism that is likely to link a genotype component to the larval diet and adult social behavior of these bees...|$|R

40|$|Recent {{advances}} in molecular biology have provided geneticists with ever-increasing numbers of highly polymorphic genetic markers {{that have made}} possible linkage mapping of loci responsible for many human diseases. However, nearly all diseases mapped to date follow clear <b>Mendelian,</b> single-locus <b>segregation</b> patterns. In contrast, many common familial diseases such as diabetes, psoriasis, several forms of cancer, and schizophrenia are familial and {{appear to have a}} genetic component but do not exhibit simple Mendelian transmission. More complex models are required to explain the genetics of these important diseases. In this paper, we explore two-trait-locus, two-marker-locus linkage analysis in which two trait loci are mapped simultaneously to separate genetic markers. We compare the utility of this approach to standard one-trait-locus, one-marker-locus linkage analysis with and without allowance for heterogeneity. We also compare the utility of the two-trait-locus, two-marker-locus analysis to two-trait-locus, one-marker-locus linkage analysis. For common diseases, pedigrees are often bilineal, with disease genes entering via two or more unrelated pedigree members. Since such pedigrees often are avoided in linkage studies, we also investigate the relative information content of unilineal and bilineal pedigrees. For the dominant-or-recessive and threshold models that we consider, we find that two-trait-locus, two-marker-locus linkage analysis can provide substantially more linkage information, as measured by expected maximum lod score, than standard one-trait-locus, one-marker-locus methods, even allowing for heterogeneity, while, for a dominant-or-dominant generating model, one-locus models that allow for heterogeneity extract essentially as much information as the two-trait-locus methods. For these three models, we also find that bilineal pedigrees provide sufficient linkage information to warrant their inclusion in such studies. We also discuss strategies for assessing the significance of the two linkages assumed in two-trait-locus, two-marker-locus models...|$|R

Three esterase-D enzyme loci (Est-D 1, Est-D 2 and Est-D 3) were examined and complemented with chromosomal data from 66 piranha specimens collected from Lake CatalÃ£o. For all specimens the Est-D 1 and Est-D 2 loci were monomorphic. In contrast, the Est-D 3 locus was polymorphic with genotypes and alleles being differentially distributed in the previously described cytotypes and served as the basis for detecting a new cytotype (2 n = 60 B). In cytotype 2 n = 58 the Est-D 3 locus was also polymorphic and presented <b>Mendelian</b> allelic <b>segregation</b> with four genotypes (Est-D 3 (11), Est-D 3 (12), Est-D 3 (22) and Est-D 3 (33)) out of six theoretically possible genotypes, presumably encoded by alleles Est-D 3 Â¹ (frequency = 0. 237), EsT-D 3 Â² (0. 710) and Est-D 3 Â³ (0. 053). A Chi-squared (chi 2) test for Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium was applied to the Est-D 3 locus and revealed a genetic unbalance in cytotype 2 n = 58, indicating the probable existence in the surveyed area of different stocks for that karyotypic structure. A silent null allele (Est-D 3 (0)) with a high frequency (0. 959) occurred exclusively in the 2 n = 60 cytotype. On the other hand, the new cytotype 2 n = 60 B described {{here for the first time}} was monomorphic for the presumably fixed Est-D 3 Â³ allele. The data as a whole should contribute to the better understanding the rhombeus complex taxonomic status definition in the Central Amazon...|$|R
