50|$|Allqamari (Quechua for <b>{{mountain}}</b> <b>caracara,</b> also spelled Alcamari) is a 4026 m {{mountain in}} the Bolivian Andes. It {{is located in the}} Chuquisaca Department, Nor Cinti Province, San Lucas Municipality. It lies near the Waylla Mayu.|$|E
50|$|<b>Mountain</b> <b>Caracaras</b> are {{endemic to}} South America and are found {{throughout}} several countries, including Bolivia, Chile, Peru and Argentina. They prefer unforested regions {{where they can}} perch on power poles or fence posts to overlook a large area. They are usually grouped near cities and along highways.|$|R
50|$|It {{is still}} unknown why some <b>Mountain</b> <b>Caracaras</b> use a group {{foraging}} method {{to hunt down}} food. Even though the hunting party {{may be able to}} overturn bigger rocks and cover more ground, the prey captured is usually not shared amongst the hunters and usually little to no benefit is received by the youngest in the group. The Caracara that decides on the most likely rock to move is usually the bird who grabs and eats the prey, though if enough food is available, all members could potentially receive a meal at some point during their forage.|$|R
50|$|A {{medium-sized}} caracara with a faintly blue beak tip {{turning to}} bright orange, strongly contrasted by the jet-black feathers of its head, back and chest. Its rump, belly and uppertail and undertail coverts are pure white, changing sharply from black to white between the belly and chest. Its black wings have small white shoulder patches {{and it has}} white spots on some of its outer primairies. In the 1960s, 17 individual birds were caught and measured and {{it was noted that}} the species wing length could range from 358 to 403 mm, giving them a medium-sized wing for a caracara, but a comparatively short tail. Despite an important food source being carcasses, the <b>Mountain</b> <b>Caracara's</b> head and throat remain feathered (unlike some vultures), and only its lores are kept naked. Its legs are yellow and the males and females look similar, while the juveniles are brown.|$|R
50|$|It {{resembles the}} closely related <b>mountain</b> <b>caracara,</b> but unlike that species its chest and upper belly is black with dense white streaks. Juveniles {{are far less}} {{distinctive}} than the orange-faced pied adults, being overall brown with dull pinkish-grey facial skin.|$|E
50|$|Other notable {{bird species}} {{present in the}} Colca include the giant hummingbird, the largest member of the hummingbird family, {{as well as the}} Andean goose, Chilean flamingo, and <b>mountain</b> <b>caracara.</b> Animals include vizcacha, a rabbit-sized {{relative}} of the chinchilla, zorrino, deer, fox, and vicu침a, the wild ancestor of the alpaca.|$|E
5000|$|Allqamarina (Aymara and Quechua allqamari <b>{{mountain}}</b> <b>caracara,</b> [...] -na a Quechua suffix, may be [...] "the {{place of}} the mountain caracara", Hispanicized spelling Alcamarina) is a 5085 m mountain in the Willkanuta mountain range in the Andes of Peru. It is situated in the Cusco Region, Canchis Province, Pitumarca District. Allqamarina lies northwest of Urqu Pu침una and west of Utt'a침a.|$|E
5000|$|Alcamarinayoc (possibly from Aymara and Quechua allqamari <b>{{mountain}}</b> <b>caracara,</b> [...] -na, -yuq Quechua suffixes, [...] "the {{one with}} a place of the mountain caracara") or Colque Cruz (possibly from Aymara and Quechua qullqi money, silver, Spanish cruz cross, [...] "silver cross") is a 6102 m mountain in the Vilcanota mountain range in the Andes of Peru. It is situated in the Cusco Region, Quispicanchi Province, Ocongate District. Alcamarinayoc lies northwest of the peak of Chumpe, north of Quevesere and northeast of Ichhu Ananta.|$|E
50|$|The <b>mountain</b> <b>caracara</b> (Phalcoboenus megalopterus, Spanish: corequenque) is {{a species}} of bird of prey in the family Falconidae. It is found in puna and p치ramo in the Andes, ranging from {{southern}} Ecuador, through Peru and Bolivia, to northern Argentina and Chile. It is generally uncommon to fairly common. It resembles the closely related Carunculated Caracara and White-throated Caracara, but unlike those species, its chest is uniform black. Juveniles are far less distinctive than the red-faced pied adults, being overall brown with dull pinkish-grey facial skin.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Mountain</b> <b>Caracara</b> {{is closely}} related to the other birds of the genus Phalcoboenus, a group which {{separated}} {{from the rest of the}} Caracaras around 1.9 million years ago. The White-throated Caracara (Phalcoboenus albogularis) is the Mountain Caracara's closest relative and there have been recordings of hybridization events between the two species. They differ mostly by the colour of their plumage and by their habitat preference. It is supposed that the Phalcoboenus taxa diverged within themselves roughly 0.6 million years ago when there was a large amount of glacial activity in the area.|$|E
50|$|The white-throated caracara (Phalcoboenus albogularis) is {{a species}} of bird of prey in the Falconidae family. It is found in grasslands and other barren {{habitats}} in the Andes of southern Chile and Argentina. It is generally uncommon to fairly common. A highly opportunistic bird commonly seen walking on the ground, it will feed on both carrion and virtually any small animal it can catch. It resembles the closely related <b>mountain</b> <b>caracara,</b> but unlike that species its underparts (including chest and throat) are entirely white. Juveniles are far less distinctive than the yellow-faced pied adults, being overall brown with dull pinkish-grey facial skin.|$|E
50|$|More than 1000 {{bird species}} have been {{estimated}} {{to exist in the}} park. Birds reported for the lowland rainforest in the park include: the great tinamou, Spix's guan, the rufescent tiger-heron, the blue-and-yellow macaw, the silvery grebe, the harpy eagle, the blue throated piping-guan, the long-billed starthroat, the snowy egret, the king vulture, the ladder-tailed nightjar, the scarlet macaw, the sapphire-spangled emerald, the roseate spoonbill, the stilt sandpiper, the blue-crowned trogon, the turquoise tanager, the Amazonian pygmy owl, the black-throated mango, the blue-headed parrot, etc. Birds present in the mountain zones in the park include: the Andean tinamou, the great horned owl, the torrent duck, the yellow-billed pintail, the amethyst-throated sunangel, the Andean guan, the puna ibis, the golden-collared tanager, the Andean condor, the collared inca, the solitary eagle, the Andean cock-of-the-rock, the masked flowerpiercer, the <b>mountain</b> <b>caracara,</b> the mitred parakeet, the sapphire-vented puffleg, the giant hummingbird, etc.|$|E
