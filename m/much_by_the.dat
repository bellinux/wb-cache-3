5|$|The ground teams carry {{equipment}} on their person {{that they use}} while in the field. This equipment includes flashlights, signal mirrors, tactical vests, safety vests, and food that will last them at least 24hours. The equipment carried by ground teams varies <b>much</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> mission at hand. Urban direction finding (UDF) missions necessitate only a small kit of gear. But intensive mountain search and rescue can require packs that provide for up to 72 hours of operational supplies and tool for the location, rescue and extraction of lost or crashed parties. This gear includes the above, plus additional water, meals, and survival gear. Although a standardized list {{is provided by the}} national command, many teams modify the list to match the needs of the mission.|$|E

This section ends with a chromatic descent in the accompaniment at quadruple piano dynamic, up to a dominant seventh of G major, to prepare the return of the second section A in the original key.|$|E
5|$|The wine gallon was {{abolished}} in Britain in 1826, {{and this}} system {{was replaced by}} a new one based on the newly introduced imperial gallon. Since the imperial gallon is 20% more than the liquid gallon, {{the same is true for}} the imperial pint in relation to the liquid pint. This explains why the number of fluid ounces per gallon had to be adjusted in the new system so that the fluid ounce was not changed too <b>much</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> reform. Even so, the modern UK fluid ounce is 4% less than the US fluid ounce, and the same is true for the smaller units. For some years both systems were used concurrently in the UK.|$|E

Houses were made of pine and spruce logs, with shingled roofs plastered with sod or covered by birch bark.

Much of the wooden city was replaced by buildings in the classical style.|$|E
25|$|The war's {{outcome was}} {{determined}} as <b>much</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> {{weakness of the}} Byzantines as {{the strengths of the}} Seljuqs. Nonetheless, the latter, just like the Arabs many years earlier, failed to destroy the Byzantine Empire. The Seljuq Turks, having originated from the steppes, possessed many advantages. At the Battle of Manzikert, the Byzantine heavy cavalry was defeated using simple hit and run tactics, with the faster light cavalry of the Turks outflanking and outmaneuvering the exhausted cavalry.|$|E

Shockley's biographer Joel Shurkin, a science writer {{on the staff of}} Stanford University during those years, sums this up as saying that the statement was defamatory, but Shockley's reputation was not worth <b>much</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> time the trial reached a verdict.|$|E

25|$|Kent started practising as an {{architect}} relatively late, in the 1730s. He is better remembered as {{an architect}} of the revived Palladian style in England. Burlington gave him the task of editing The Designs of Inigo Jones... with some additional designs in the Palladian/Jonesian taste by Burlington and Kent, which appeared in 1727. As he rose through the royal architectural establishment, the Board of Works, Kent applied this style to several public buildings in London, for which Burlington's patronage secured him the commissions: the Royal Mews at Charing Cross (1731–33, demolished in 1830), the Treasury buildings in Whitehall (1733–37), and the Horse Guards building in Whitehall (designed {{shortly before his death}} and built 1750–1759). These neo-antique buildings were inspired as <b>much</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> architecture of Raphael and Giulio Romano as by Palladio.|$|E
25|$|In summer, {{the coastal}} regions of Greenland {{experience}} temperatures {{similar to the}} islands in the Canadian Archipelago, averaging just a few degrees above freezing in July, with slightly higher temperatures {{in the south and}} west than in the north and east. The interior ice sheet remains snow-covered throughout the summer, though significant portions do experience some snow melt (Serreze and Barry, 2005). This snow cover, combined with the ice sheet's elevation, help to keep temperatures here lower, with July averages between −12°C and 0°C (10°F and 32°F). Along the coast, temperatures are kept from varying too <b>much</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> moderating influence of the nearby water or melting sea ice. In the interior, temperatures are kept from rising much above freezing because of the snow-covered surface but can drop to −30°C (−22°F) even in July. Temperatures above 20°C are rare but do sometimes occur in the far south and south-west coastal areas.|$|E
25|$|Löhe {{was born}} on 21 February 1808 {{in the town of}} Fürth in present-day Middle Franconia. The son of a shopkeeper, his father died in 1816 and he seemed to have had a very lonely childhood. He {{received}} his basic education from C. L. Roth’s gymnasium in Nuremberg and was admitted to theological study at the University of Erlangen in 1826. He was heavily influenced by the Reformed professors of theology Christian Krafft and Thomas von Kempen. Ultimately, he was introduced to the Lutheran Confessions and became a Lutheran under the teaching of David Hollaz. In 1828 he spent a term at the University of Berlin, attracted not so <b>much</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> lectures of the professors as by the sermons of the famous preachers. Löhe graduated from the Erlangen in 1830, but waited until 1831 before receiving a pastoral assignment to Kirchenlamitz in Upper Franconia (Northeastern Bavaria).|$|E

25|$|By July {{the tide}} was turning in the Parliamentarians' favour: bombardment, scurvy, lack of water, perhaps a {{shortage}} of gunpowder {{and the threat of}} starvation and only 25 men fit to fight meant that the castle surrendered on 25 July 1645. Only about half of the original 500 defenders emerged alive. Subsequently the castle was repaired and rearmed for Parliament with a company of 160. Matthew Boynton, the castle's new governor, declared for the king on 27 July 1648 when the soldiers went unpaid. This led to a second siege which brought the castle back under Parliamentary control on 19 December, when the garrison was defeated as <b>much</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> oncoming winter as by the Parliamentary forces. The castle changed hands seven times between 1642 and 1648. The castle was later used as a prison for those who were deemed to be enemies of the Commonwealth of England, the country's brief period of republicanism; the shell of the keep survives, minus the west wall, which was destroyed in the bombardment. The castle was returned to the Crown following the restoration of the monarchy in 1660.|$|E
25|$|Lloyd George wanted Russia {{persuaded to}} make the maximum {{possible}} effort, a necessity again stressed at the second Chantilly Conference in December 1916. Wilson was sent as Senior Military Representative (Robertson had refused to go) on a British mission to Russia in January 1917 (delayed from November 1916), the object of which {{was to keep the}} Russians holding down at least the forces now opposite them, to boost Russian morale and see what equipment they needed with a view to coordinating attacks. The party of 50 included British (led by Milner and including a banker and two munitions experts), French (led by de Castelnau) and Italian delegations. The War Office briefing advised that Russia was close to revolution. Wilson met the Tsar but thought him “as devoid of character & purpose as our own poor miserable King”. Even senior Russian officials were talking openly of assassinating the Tsar or perhaps just the Tsarina. Wilson was impressed by Generals Ruzski and Danilov, although he may have been influenced too <b>much</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> views of Knox, who had been British military attaché since 1911. He toured Petrograd, Moscow (where he was concerned at the food shortages) and Riga, which he predicted the “Boches” would never capture (they would do so in late 1917), and thought that even if Tsar and Tsarina were assassinated – the Tsar was toppled a few weeks after he left – Russia would not make a separate peace. His official report (3 March) said that Russia would remain in the war and that they would solve their “administrative chaos”. However, many other observers at the time, e.g. the young Archibald Wavell in the Caucasus, felt that the advent of democracy in Russia would reinvigorate her war effort, so Wilson’s views were not entirely unusual.|$|E

500|$|During dry periods, however, {{much of the}} Senne's {{water was}} {{diverted}} {{for the needs of}} the populace of the city as well as to maintain the water level in the Charleroi Canal. This left a flow too feeble to evacuate the filthy water, leaving the sewage, garbage, detritus and industrial waste that had been dumped into the river to accumulate in the stagnant water. The Senne, which a witness in 1853 described as [...] "the most nauseous little river in the world", had become an open-air sewer spreading pestilential odours throughout the city. Early {{in the second half of}} the 19th century, Brussels saw numerous dry periods, floods and a cholera epidemic, caused as <b>much</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> river itself as by the poverty and the lack of hygiene and potable water in the lower city.

500|$|Somerset had an {{extraordinary}} season in 1890, going unbeaten in their thirteen fixtures; winning twelve and tying the other. Though he {{was described in}} the Taunton Courier's summary of the season as [...] "one of Somerset's best bats", Roe was no longer relied upon so <b>much</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> team, which could now look to the batting of Hewett and Lionel Palairet. Roe finished the season sixth on the counties batting averages, having managed to play in eight of the county's fixtures. Due to their record in 1890, the county were admitted to the County Championship for 1891 after a unanimous vote, regaining their first-class status. He played infrequently, and without excelling himself, for Somerset over the subsequent few years. One of his highlights during this period was an innings against Gloucestershire in which he scored 75 runs to help Somerset set up a large victory. The Gloucestershire Chronicle praised him for the pace of his innings; he took an hour to patiently accrue his first 28 runs while the Somerset innings was in trouble, then added another 47 in just over half an hour.|$|E
