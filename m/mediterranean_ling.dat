Bac wrote that [...] "the soul of gardens shelters the greatest sum of serenity at man's disposal." [...] Bac wrote two books about his <b>Mediterranean</b> gardens, <b>Les</b> Colombières and Jardins enchantés. Created {{on the site of}} an olive grove, the gardens are set over several levels, studded with Mediterranean cypresses. The gardens reference classical literature such as Homer's Odyssey, including Nausicaa's fountain, a garden named for Ulysses, and a head of Medusa. At the centre of an avenue of large olive jars is a 600-year Caroub tree, said to have the oldest caroub tree in France. Twelve small buildings guide visitors through the garden. The site is located on a hillside above Menton's harbour. and noted for its fine views of the Bay of Menton and Menton's old city.|$|R
40|$|The polychaete Capitella sp. A, {{collected}} in a NW <b>Mediterranean</b> fish farm (<b>Les</b> Cases d’Alcanar, Tarragona, Spain), was cultured {{for the first time}} under experimental conditions with different organically enriched sediments to study the differences in development and growth. The species proved to be dioecious and had lecithotrophic development. Sizes of individuals and duration of the developmental stages varied widely, as in most known species of Capitella. In organically enriched sediments, the juveniles were seen one day after hatching and immature females (i. e. with yellow ovaries) after 52 days. Females may reach maturity (i. e. show white intra-coelomic oocytes) at about 64 days old, and the species had a life span of 167 days. According to its development, Capitella sp. A differs from all known lecithotrophic species of the genus. The results also proved that organically enrichment enhanced growth and survival, whereas lowering food can cause morphological alterations such as reduced size in male genital spines...|$|R

Circumstantial evidence suggests that domestication began about 8000 BP in the eastern <b>Mediterranean</b> (Zeuner 1958, <b>le</b> Brunet al. 1987) and continued until 4000 BP in the Middle East and perhaps also in the valley of the Indus (Baldwin 1975, Ahmad et al. 1980). Paintings and sculptures of cats from the Eighteenth Dynasty confirm that cats were fully domesticated and living in close association with humans in Egypt by 3600 BP (Clutton-Brock 1981, Serpell 1988). Domestic cats spread slowly from Egypt, but occupied much of Europe prior to the spread of the Roman Empire (Waldren et al. 1984, Kitchener 1991). In the last 2000 years domestic cats have been transported actively on sailing vessels to most parts of the world (Lumpkin 1993), either for food, their ability to control ship-borne rodents or as pets (Dickman 1995) ...|$|R
40|$|Mediterranean coastal {{ecosystems}} {{are known to}} be highly subject to natural and anthropic environmental stress. In this study, we examine the effects of anthracene as a common pollutant on the total microbial communities from a Pinus halepensis litter of a typical <b>Mediterranean</b> coastal site (<b>Les</b> Calanques, Marseille). The main objective was to identify the microbial factors leading the resilience of this ecosystem. Two questions were addressed: (i) how lignin-degrading enzymes (Laccase, Lignin-peroxidase and Mn-peroxidase) are affected by the presence of this molecule, (ii) whether the indigenous consortia are involved in its degradation in mesocosms under favorable incubation conditions (25 degrees C, 60 % WHC) and after different time intervals (1 and 3 month(s)). We found a strong increase in laccase production in the presence of anthracene after 3 months, together with anthracene degradation (28 % +/- 5). Moreover 9, 10 -anthraquinone is detected as the product of anthracene oxidation after 3 months. However neither lignin-peroxidase activity nor Mn-peroxidase activity is detected. Laccase proteins directly extracted from litter were sequenced via Nano-LC-MS/MS and reveal twelve different peptide sequences induced by the presence of anthracene in the mesocoms. Our study confirms the major detoxification role of this enzymatic system and highlights the high degradation potential of fungal species inhabiting P. halepensis litter, a factor in the resilience of Mediterranean ecosystems...|$|R
40|$|Mediterranean {{wetlands}} are characterised by two factors: (1) {{a remarkable}} seasonal fluctuation {{in the water}} table and (2) {{a long history of}} anthropisation. Being exceptional archives for palaeoenvironmental and archaeological research, humid areas have been thoroughly studied to assess the interplay between people and the environment during the Holocene. We present here the study of a sedimentary sequence from a <b>Mediterranean</b> wetland: the <b>Les</b> Arenes floodplain (Tortosa, NE Spain). Fully dry to date, Les Arenes is documented as a partially drained floodplain in the 12 th century records. With the aim of assessing the climatic and anthropic contribution to its desiccation, we report here the results of bulk sediment analyses, environmental magnetism, soil micromorphology and AMS dating of this sedimentary sequence, plus a review of the available historical records. The outcome is a clearer understanding of the evolution of this Mediterranean floodplain during the 1 st millennium AD, which implications may be extrapolated to other floodplain wetlands in the Iberian Peninsula and the Mediterranean. Wet conditions and a low to medium-energy depositional environment are attested in Les Arenes between the 1 st and 7 th centuries coinciding with the Iberian-Roman Humid Period (IRHP) and the Dark Age Humid Period (DAHP). Drier conditions between the 7 th and 10 th centuries concur with enhanced fluvial dynamics, the Medieval Climate Anomaly (MCA) and the first arrival of Arabic-Berber populations in the Iberian Peninsula (al-Andalus, starting in AD 711). Results suggest that although the shift from wet to dry conditions in Les Arenes complies with major climatic trends, the construction of the first drainage canals by Arab-Berber groups likely contributed to the enhancement of on-going climate-related environmental processes.

À procura dos princípios da dinâmica {{singular}} da obra de Balkrishna Doshi, este estudo coloca-se no lugar inquieto da concepção de um projecto construído em 1965 em Ahmedabad. Feita do deslocamento de elementos urbanos para o privado, a obra do arquitecto indiano absorve os pormenores construtivos de Louis Kahn e a agilidade de Le Corbusier — o dito acrobate que confere a Doshi o papel do mime — para desenvolver gestos silenciosos, aprendidos e contudo improvisados. Na Casa de Hóspedes da Ahmedabad Textile Industry's Research Association aparece em relevo o que inquietava o arquitecto: além da referência aos mestres modernos, ao familiarizar-se com o modelo rural da arquitectura popular indiana, era paradoxalmente a cidade, pela construção de habitação a custo mínimo, aquilo que o arquitecto interrogava — a cidade no seu sentido lato: o do lugar de convívio. Falar de um arquitecto como de um mime é já colocar pistas de investigação; implica traçar o seu percurso inicial e encontrar nele pontos de convergência entre a sua obra e os modelos conhecidos. É a época entre 1947 e 1965 que nos interessa: as datas correspondem, entre outros, à Independência da Índia e ao famoso banho no Mediterrâneo de Le Corbusier, o mestre adoptado por Doshi — dois eventos cuja justaposição numa só frase pode parecer incongruente, mas que o estudo, nas entrelinhas, pretenderá esclarecer. The {{present study}} explores the singular dynamic {{at work in}} the conception of one of the early housing project of the Indian architect Balkrishna Doshi, built in Ahmedabad in 1965. Made of the displacement of urban elements into the domestic domain, his work tends to absorb the construction details of Louis Kahn and the dexterity of Le Corbusier within the silent gestures the architect learnt — as if an improvised mime from a professed acrobat. However, beyond the obvious reference to the modern masters, the Guest House of the Ahmedabad Textile Industry's Research Association reflects the early concerns of the architect. Borrowing from rural models of popular Indian architecture, it was paradoxically the very construction of the city, through the realization of low-cost housing, which he questioned then — the city in its broader sense: a place for the community. To address an architect as a mime is to define ways of investigation: it implies a recollection of the early years of his practice, in which one may find points of convergence between his work and its referring models. It is the period from 1947 to 1965 that this document offers to study: both dates match, coincidentally, the Indian Independence and the final bath in the <b>Mediterranean</b> for <b>Le</b> Corbusier, the master Doshi adopted — a seemingly incongruous set of events that, eventually, weaves the backdrop of the study...|$|R
40|$|European {{sea bass}} (Dicentrarchus labrax) is an {{economically}} important marine species in European aquaculture. Althou gh sea bass population structure is well known, aquaculture does not benefit fr om selection programs, sea bass production being nearly completely based on wild-caught fishes reproducing in semi-controlled conditions. More knowl edge {{on the sea}} bass genome would help the breeding progress in this species, th e study of natural populations and their evolution {{as well as the}} management of fisheries. The generation of large collections of Expr essed Sequence Tags (ESTs) would provide genomic resources for discovering new genes and new markers, identifying intron-exon boundaries and studying genes expression profiles. In this thesis, efforts were concentrated on the di scovery of Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) within ESTs. SNPs are the most abundant source of variation in most eukaryotic and prokaryotic genomes and can have applications both in aquaculture and natural popula tions. Approximately 30, 000 ESTs from 14 libraries of five sea bass individuals have been sequenced. This large EST collection was described and compared to a similar set of ESTs generated for gilthead sea bream (S parus aurata), another economically important marine species. The processin g of ESTs led to the generation of 17, 716 and 18, 198 sea bass and sea bream u nique sequences, of which less than a third were common to both species. Autom atic annotation indicated that more protein coding sequences were generated f or sea bass than for sea bream. This was further confirmed by the prediction of Open Reading Frames (ORFs) and by the GC content of sea bass and sea bream un ique sequences. Gene Ontology (GO) annotation showed that the same categories were represented for both species. Six SNP discovery tools were used on sea bass ESTs and their performance was assessed by validating around 10 % of the SNP candidates. This analysis demonstrated that the selection of redundant candidate SNPs (mismatches detected at least twice in the ESTs) was a good mean of improving SNP di scovery performance. The selection of SNP candidates with a minimum allele frequency greater or equal to 0. 3 further enhanced SNP discovery performance although reducing the number of SNP candidates. Finally the selection of SNP candidates detect ed by several tools and the exclusion of indels were also good means of reduci ng the number of false positive candidate SNPs. Transition SNP candidates appea red to be less reliable than transversion SNP candidates due to the presence of RNA editing sites in EST collections. High quality of EST assembly and of th e flanking regions of SNP candidates revealed to be essential for an efficient SNP discovery. These conclusions {{led to the development of}} a pipeline integrating the six tes ted SNP discovery tools. This efficient and easy to use pipeline allows the detection of SNPs in any EST dataset, the selection of SNP candidates according to redundancy and/or minimum allel e frequency and the comparison of SNP candidates according to SNP discovery tool. It has been used successfully on EST collections of the fishes Dicentra rchus labrax, Sparus aurata, Anguilla anguilla and the waterflea Daphnia magna. The use of the six SNP discovery tools identified 1, 072 unique SNP candidates of which a subset was validated. A total of 360 SNPs were discovered in introns and ESTs, proving that resequencing the conti gs predicted to be polymorphic was an efficient way of discovering SNPs. The nucleotide diversity of sea bass was estimated to one SNP every 137 bp and was high er in introns than in ESTs. The Mendelian inheritance was checked on 17 SNPs polymorphic on the Venezia Fbis family used to produce sea bass linkage maps. Four of them did not follow Mendelian inheritance, suggesting the presence of null alleles. Finally, 22 wild sea bass populations were successfully genotyped at 49 SNPs. This set of SNPs sufficed to confirm the established sea bass popu lation structure, namely the differentiation of Atlantic and <b>Mediterranean</b> samp <b>les.</b> Adriatic samples were shown to be genetically distinct from Western and Eastern Mediterranean samples. Selection analyses pointed to a locus that could be under natural selection in the Atlantic Ocean. In conclusion, a bioinformatic approach to discover SNPs was proven to be very valuable. Meanwhile SNP genotyping technologi es have evolved, allowing the validation of SNP candidates on the samples to be investigated.
