40|$|Analysis {{and design}} of beam is still an {{important}} part in Structural Engineering practice. As a major component in structure, it demands due attention and accuracy. At the same time engineers need to achieve economy in time and cost in the design of beams. To assist designers <b>moment</b> <b>coefficients</b> are developed for continuous beams in this work. Existing ACI <b>moment</b> <b>coefficients</b> are applicable only under certain conditions and have some limitations. This study is an attempt to develop <b>moment</b> <b>coefficients</b> for beams which will be applicable beyond ACI limitations. Comparison of developed coefficients with corresponding ACI coefficients has been done and a satisfactory agreement is found. However, ACI coefficients are found to be conservative. Additionally design tables are developed for selection of RC beam section and reinforcement when design bending moment and shear are available. SAP 2000 has been used for analysis of beams during the study. Models are used to generate exact <b>moment</b> <b>coefficients</b> for beams of different span ratios and spans under uniform loading. The <b>moment</b> <b>coefficients</b> and design tables generated in this work will be useful for practicing engineers for quick design...|$|R

40|$|Moments can {{be viewed}} as {{powerful}} image descriptors that capture global characteristics of an image. The magnitude of the <b>moment</b> <b>coefficients</b> is said to be invariant under geometrical transformations like rotation which makes them suitable for most of the recognition applications. But in practice, the invariance of <b>moment</b> <b>coefficients</b> is compromised due to the errors in computation. This paper presents an empirical study of some popularly used moment functions to find out the robust coefficients under rotation. The selected robust coefficients are used in face recognition under in–plane rotation. Experimental results demonstrate that the performance of the proposed method comes at par with the performance of the traditional method by using lesser number of <b>moment</b> <b>coefficients</b> and thus results in significant saving in the feature extraction time...|$|R

40|$|Results are {{presented}} {{of the study}} of the Venusian atmosphere, Magellan aerodynamic <b>moment</b> <b>coefficients,</b> <b>moments</b> of inertia, and solar <b>moment</b> <b>coefficients.</b> This investigation is based upon the use of attitude control data in the form of reaction wheel speeds from the Magellan spacecraft. As the spacecraft enters the upper atmosphere of Venus, measurable torques are experienced due to aerodynamic effects. Solar and gravity gradient effects also cause additional torques throughout the orbit. In order to maintain an inertially fixed attitude, the control system counteracts these torques by changing the angular rates of three reaction wheels. Model reaction wheel speeds are compared to observed Magellan reaction wheel speeds through a differential correction procedure. This method determines aerodynamic, atmospheric, solar pressure and mass moments of inertia parameters. Atmospheric measurements include both base densities and scale heights. Atmospheric base density results confirm natural variability as measured by the standard orbital decay method.

50|$|In {{the case}} of a {{symmetric}} airfoil, the lift force acts through one point for all angles of attack, and the center of pressure does not move as it does in a cambered airfoil. Consequently the pitching <b>moment</b> <b>coefficient</b> for a symmetric airfoil is zero.|$|E

40|$|Mean and {{fluctuating}} torsional {{moments of}} tall buildings with various planform shapes have been measured in wind tunnel boundary layer flows for suburban terrain. The {{cause of the}} high torsional moments are seen to be {{the combination of a}} sharp-edged separation from a building edge providing a significant moment arm, and the building surface in the wake producing complementary areas with low pressures. The torsional moments are hence normalised in coefficient form with the maximum projected width and the maximum projected area of the building. These torsional <b>moment</b> <b>coefficients</b> are shown {{to be related to the}} ratio, f, of minimum projected width to the maximum projected width of the building planform in two categories: the slab-like structures (f 0. 3).

50|$|The lift on an airfoil is a {{distributed}} {{force that}} can be said to act at a point called the center of pressure. However, as angle of attack changes on a cambered airfoil, there is movement of the center of pressure forward and aft. This makes analysis difficult when attempting to use the concept of the center of pressure. One of the remarkable properties of a cambered airfoil is that, even though the center of pressure moves forward and aft, if the lift is imagined to act at a point called the aerodynamic center the moment of the lift force changes in proportion to the square of the airspeed. If the moment is divided by the dynamic pressure, the area and chord of the airfoil, to compute a pitching <b>moment</b> <b>coefficient,</b> this coefficient changes only a little over the operating range of angle of attack of the airfoil. The combination of the two concepts of aerodynamic center and pitching <b>moment</b> <b>coefficient</b> make it relatively simple to analyse some of the flight characteristics of an aircraft.|$|E
5000|$|The torques or moments {{acting on}} an airfoil moving through a fluid can be {{accounted}} for by the net lift applied at some point on the airfoil, and a separate net pitching moment about that point whose magnitude varies with the choice of where the lift is chosen to be applied.

40|$|The 5 %-static-margin {{requirement}} {{once used}} by {{the military has been}} removed in favor of dynamic requirements. However, static margin is still commonly used as a preliminary guideline for establishing adequate pitch stability in piloted airplanes. Here a dynamic margin is defined to be the distance that the airplane’s stick-fixed maneuver point lies aft of the center of gravity, expressed as a fraction of the pitch radius of gyration. A proposed minimum-dynamic-margin constraint is shown to agree with the short-period-frequency requirements used in recent military specifications to an accuracy of about 2 %. For some airplanes, this stability constraint is shown to differ from the 5 %-minimum-static-margin guideline by more than 400 %.
