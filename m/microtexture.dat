These so-called “tubular” and “granular” <b>microtextures</b> are widely interpreted to represent bona fide microbial trace fossils; however, possible nonbiological origins for these complex alteration <b>microtextures</b> have yet to be explored. Here, we reevaluate the origin of these enigmatic <b>microtextures</b> from a strictly nonbiological standpoint, using a case study on submarine glasses from the western North Atlantic Ocean (DSDP 418 A). By combining petrographic and SEM observations of corrosion <b>microtextures</b> at the glass-palagonite interface, considerations of the tectonic setting, measurement of U and Th concentrations of fresh basaltic glass by ICP-MS, and theoretical modelling of the present-day distribution of radiation damage in basaltic glass caused by radioactive decay of U and Th, we reinterpret these enigmatic <b>microtextures</b> as the end product of the preferential corrosion/dissolution of radiation damage (alpha-recoil tracks and fission tracks) in the glass by seawater, possibly combined with pressure solution etch-tunnelling. Our findings have important implications for geomicrobiology, astrobiological exploration of Mars, and understanding of the long-term breakdown of nuclear waste glass...|$|R

40|$|Subseafloor environments {{preserved}} in Archean greenstone belts provide an analogue for investigating potential subsurface habitats on Mars. The c. 3. 5 - 3. 4 Ga pillow lava metabasalts of the mid-Archean Barberton greenstone belt, South Africa, have been argued {{to contain the}} earliest evidence for microbial subseafloor life. This includes candidate trace fossils {{in the form of}} titanite <b>microtextures,</b> and sulfur isotopic signatures of pyrite {{preserved in}} metabasaltic glass of the c. 3. 472 Ga Hooggenoeg Formation. It has been contended that similar <b>microtextures</b> in altered martian basalts may represent potential extraterrestrial biosignatures of microbe-fluid-rock interaction. But despite numerous studies describing these putative early traces of life, a detailed metamorphic characterization of the <b>microtextures</b> and their host alteration conditions in the ancient pillow lava metabasites is lacking. Here, we present a new nondestructive technique with which to study the in situ metamorphic alteration conditions associated with potential biosignatures in mafic-ultramafic rocks of the Hooggenoeg Formation. Our approach combines quantitative microscale compositional mapping by electron microprobe with inverse thermodynamic modeling to derive low-temperature chlorite crystallization conditions. We found that the titanite <b>microtextures</b> formed under subgreenschist to greenschist facies conditions. Two chlorite temperature groups were identified in the maps surrounding the titanite <b>microtextures</b> and record peak metamorphic conditions at 315 ± 40 °C (XFe 3 +(chlorite) = 25 - 34 %) and lower-temperature chlorite veins/microdomains at T = 210 ± 40 °C (lower XFe 3 +(chlorite) = 40 - 45 %). These results provide the first metamorphic constraints in textural context on the Barberton titanite <b>microtextures</b> and thereby improve our understanding of the local preservation conditions of these potential biosignatures. We suggest that this approach may prove to be an important tool in future studies to assess the biogenicity of these earliest candidate traces of life on Earth. Furthermore, we propose that this mapping approach could also be used to investigate altered mafic-ultramafic extraterrestrial samples containing candidate biosignatures...|$|R

Expanded mountain ice, forming extensive to thin Valley glaciers with thicknesses of 500 m & 200 m, produces a range of fractures and abrasion features on quartz clasts as well as pounding, thinning and flattening of gold. On quartz grains these <b>microtextures</b> include conchoidal and subparallel linear fractures covering 10 - 40 % of grain surfaces, minor Crater and v-shaped percussion cracks, and abrasion features.

Uptumed plates on quartz, often considered to represent maximum cryostatic pressure, are also absent on quartz grains in mountain tills. Grain edge fractures and abrasion become relatively common on grains transported longer distances (50 km). in thicker Valley glaciers.

Under insufficient lubrication bubbly flow structures appeared to be in the micro channels. Cavitation and other possible reasons for their appearance and the correlation with tribological measurements are discussed.

50|$|Road surface textures are {{deviations}} from a planar and smooth surface, affecting the vehicle/tyre interaction.

50|$|Another type of {{profilograph}} {{system is}} {{for measuring the}} surface texture of a road and how {{it relates to the}} coefficient of friction and thus to skid resistance. Pavement texture is divided into three categories; megatexture, macrotexture, and <b>microtexture.</b> <b>Microtexture</b> cannot currently be measured directly, except in a laboratory. Megatexture is measured using a similar profiling method as when obtaining IRI values, while macrotexture is the measurement of the individual variations of the road within a small interval of a few centimeters. For example, a road which has gravel spread on top followed by an asphalt seal coat will have a high macrotexture, and a road built with concrete slabs will have low macrotexture. For this reason, concrete is often grooved or roughed up immediately after it is laid on the road bed to increase the friction between the tire and road.|$|E

Both the textures could be replicated by micromolding in different polymers, polydimethylsiloxane, polystyrene, and an organic resorcinol-formaldehyde (RF) gel.

40|$|The Indiana Department of Transportation has {{conducted}} annual network inventory friction testing using the locked wheel trailer to reduce wet pavement crashes. However, issues have arisen concerning the data credibility and field operation safety on high-speed highway facilities. Some researchers {{have investigated the}} evaluation of pavement friction using macrotexture measurements and found the relationship between friction and macrotexture is extremely weak. Currently, macrotexture can be readily measured at highway speeds, but <b>microtexture</b> is evaluated using friction at low speeds from a surrogate device. <b>Microtexture</b> {{plays an important role}} in friction force. The evaluation of pavement friction from texture measurements will be undermined without considering <b>microtexture.</b> This pilot study was conducted by the authors to examine the use of laser-based sensors in measuring pavement texture, in particular <b>microtexture.</b> The requirement for laser sampling frequency was established for choosing lasers during testing at highway speeds. <b>Microtexture</b> testing was conducted on cores taken from pavements. It was found that the <b>Microtexture</b> MPD, RMS and SV increased as the baseline length increased, regardless of the type of pavement, but tended to remain constant after the baseline length exceeded 12. 75 mm. It was recommended that the <b>microtexture</b> MPD, RMS and SV should be computed in terms of a baseline length used for computing macrotexture. When estimating friction from <b>microtexture</b> measurements, the use of SV was as effective as the use of RMS. It is not necessary to include both SV and RMS when estimating friction from <b>microtexture.</b> Correlation analysis indicated that wet pavement friction had a positive relationship with macrotexture MPD, <b>microtexture</b> MPD, and <b>microtexture</b> SV. The <b>microtexture</b> SV may play a more important role in wet pavement friction than the <b>microtexture</b> MPD. Dry pavement friction is not as sensitive to macrotexture as to <b>microtexture.</b> Regression analysis indicated that pavement friction is related to both macrotextrue and <b>microtexture,</b> not to macrotexture only. In addition, when pavement is wet, its surface friction is more sensitive to the slope variance than to the mean profile depth of the <b>microtexture</b> profile. It was recommended that more research effort is needed to investigate the characterization of <b>microtexture</b> and examine the effect of macrotexture slope variance.
