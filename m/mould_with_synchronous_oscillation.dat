40|$|Presented at 2 nd International Conference on Auditory Display (ICAD), Santa Fe, New Mexico, November 7 - 9, 1994. Perceptions {{of complex}} {{structures}} or other cognitive events are associated <b>with</b> <b>synchronous</b> <b>oscillation</b> of neural cell assemblies which {{take place in}} the 40 Hz domain and last for about 100 ms. We use EEG signals from 31 scalp electrodes to identify these short-term synchronization events. The challenge for audification applications is to make these relatively rare events perceptible in the background of incoherent signals from all electrodes. In a &st approach we use an "Orchestra Paradigm" by asigning a different standard musical instrument (piano, flute, violin, glocken) to four of these electrodes. We can clearly discriminate transitions between uncorrelated activities of these areas and the events of short-term synchronization. We expect a general resonance principle to apply also in the inverse problem. The nonlinear resonance hypothesis of music perception was tested in an experiment comparing a group of musically sophisticated and a group of less sophisticated subjects. The prediction that weakly chaotic music entrains less complex brain wave (EEG) oscillations at the prefrontal cortex was confirmed by using a correlational dimension algorithm. Strongly chaotic (stochastic) and periodic music both stimulated higher brain wave complexity. More sophisticated subjects who prefer classical music showed higher EEG dimensions while less sophisticated subjects responded with a drop in brain wave complexity to rhythmical weakly chaotic music. Subjects' ratings of perceived complexity of the musical pieces followed mathematical (objective) structure of the music and did not reflect the changes in brain wave complexity. The results are interpreted {{in the context of an}} associated (Hebbian) network theory of nonlinear brain dynamics...|$|R

This {{study investigated the}} extent to which corresponding oscillations may occur in ventricular action potential duration (APD). 14 ambulatory (outpatient) heart failure patients with biventricular pacing devices were studied while seated upright watching movie clips to maintain arousal. Activation recovery intervals (ARI) as a measure of ventricular APD were obtained from unipolar electrograms recorded from the LV epicardial pacing lead during steady state RV pacing from the device. Arterial blood pressure was measured non-invasively (Finapress) and respiration monitored. Oscillations were quantified using time frequency and coherence analysis. Oscillatory behaviour of ARI at the respiratory frequency was observed in all subjects. The magnitude of the ARI variation ranged from 2. 2 ms to 6. 9 ms (mean 5. 0 ms). Coherence analysis showed a correlation with respiratory oscillation for an average of 43 % of the recording time at a significance level of p < 0. 05. Oscillations in systolic blood pressure in the Mayer wave frequency range were observed in all subjects for whom blood pressure was recorded (n= 13). ARI oscillation in the Mayer wave frequency range was observed in 6 / 13 subjects (46 %) over a range of 2. 9 ms to 9. 2 ms. Coherence with Mayer waves at the p < 0. 05 significance level was present for an average of 29 % of the recording time. In ambulatory patients with heart failure during enhanced mental arousal, left ventricular epicardial APD (ARI) oscillated at the respiratory frequency (approx. 0. 25 Hz). In 6 patients (46 %) APD oscillated at the slower Mayer wave frequency (approx. 0. 1 Hz). These findings may be important in understanding sympathetic activity-related arrhythmogenesis...|$|R

40|$|Understanding <b>synchronous</b> and traveling-wave <b>oscillations,</b> {{particularly}} {{as they relate}} to transitions between different types of behavior, is a central problem in modeling biological systems. Here, we address this problem in the context of central pattern generators (CPGs). We use contraction theory to establish the global stability of a traveling-wave or <b>synchronous</b> <b>oscillation,</b> determined by the type of coupling. This opens the door to better design of coupling architectures to create the desired type of stable oscillations. We then use coupling that is both amplitude and phase dependent to create either globally stable synchronous or traveling-wave solutions. Using the CPG motor neuron network of a leech as an example, we show that while both traveling and <b>synchronous</b> <b>oscillations</b> can be achieved by several types of coupling, the transition between different types of behavior is dictated by a specific coupling architecture. In particular, it is only the “repulsive” but not the commonly used phase or rotational coupling that can explain the transition to high-frequency <b>synchronous</b> <b>oscillations</b> that have been observed in the heartbeat pattern generator of a leech. This shows that the overall dynamics of a CPG can be highly sensitive to the type of coupling used, even for coupling architectures that are widely believed to produce the same qualitative behavior...|$|R

Neurons {{within the}} intact {{respiratory}} network are synchronized on {{long and short}} time scales to generate respiratory rhythm and <b>synchronous</b> <b>oscillations</b> in spike firing during inspiration (Figure 1. 1), respectively. Such oscillations shape the pattern of inspiratory activity that leads to contractions of the inspiratory muscles. By recording inspiratory activity from the rhythmically mouse medullary slice, I investigated <b>synchronous</b> <b>oscillations</b> during postnatal development (P 0 - 11), the role of inhibitory synaptic transmission in generating oscillations and examined where in the slice oscillations are produced. I found that average oscillation frequency significantly increased with postnatal development. Bath application of GABAA and GlyR antagonists significantly reduced <b>synchronous</b> <b>oscillation</b> power and increased peak integrated activity of inspiratory bursts in both neonates and juveniles. Bath application of Substance P alone, while increasing peak integrated activity, had no significant effect on oscillation power. Prolonging {{the time course of}} GABAergic synaptic currents with zolpidem decreased the median oscillation frequency. These data demonstrate that oscillation frequency increases with postnatal development and that both GABAergic and glycinergic transmission contribute to synchronization of motoneuron activity. Further, the time course of synaptic GABAergic currents is a determinant of oscillation frequency. Next, I tested the PreBotzinger Complex (PBC) and the XII nucleus as candidate regions in which oscillations are produced. Unilateral excitation of the PBC, via local perfusion of ACSF containing high K+, increased inspiratory burst frequency bilaterally, but had no effect on oscillation power recorded bilaterally. In contrast, unilateral excitation of the XII nucleus increased peak integrated activity bilaterally and oscillation power in the ipsilateral XII rootlet. Crosscorrelation analysis of control inspiratory activity recorded from the left and right XII rootlets produced crosscorrelation histograms with broad, significant peaks centered around a time lag of zero and no harmonic peaks. Coherence analysis of control left and right XII rootlet recordings demonstrated that oscillations are only weakly coherent. Together these data indicate that inspiratory-phase <b>synchronous</b> <b>oscillations</b> are generated in or immediately upstream of the XII motor nucleus. Collectively, my thesis research demonstrates a mechanism underlying the generation of <b>synchronous</b> <b>oscillations</b> and proposes a region of the simplified respiratory network in which these oscillations are produced...|$|R

40|$|In {{the healthy}} primate, neurons of the {{external}} and internal segments of the globus pallidus (GP) present a primarily irregular firing pattern, and a negligible level of synchrony is observed between pairs of neurons. This holds even for neighboring cells, despite their higher probability to receive common inputs and to innervate each other via lateral connectivity. In the parkinsonian primate, this changes drastically, and many pairs of GP cells show <b>synchronous</b> <b>oscillations.</b> To address the relation between distance and synchrony in the parkinsonian state, we compared the synchrony of discharge of close pairs of neurons, recorded by the same electrode, with remote pairs, recorded by different ones. However, spike trains of neighboring cells recorded by the same extracellular electrode exhibit the shadowing effect; i. e., lack of detection of spikes that occur within a few milliseconds of each other. Here, we demonstrate that the shadowing artifact can both induce apparent correlations between non-correlated neurons, as well as conceal existing correlations between neighboring ones. We therefore introduced artificial shadowing in the remote pairs, similar to the effect we observed in the close ones. After the artificial shadowing, neighboring cells did not show a higher tendency to oscillate synchronously than remote ones. On the contrary, the average percentage (over all sessions) of artificially shadowed remote pairs exhibiting <b>synchronous</b> <b>oscillations</b> was 35. 4 % compared to 17. 2 % in the close ones. Similar trend was found when the unshadowed remote pairs were separated according to the estimated distance between electrode tips: 29. 9 % of pairs at approximate distance of less than 750 &# 181;m were significantly synchronized, in comparison with 28. 5 % of the pairs whose distance was more than 750 &# 181;m.

40|$|<b>Synchronous</b> <b>oscillations</b> {{have become}} a {{widespread}} hypothetical ‘‘mechanism’’ to explain how brain dynamics give rise to neural functions. By focusing on synchrony one leaves the phase relations during moments of desynchronous oscillations either without a clear functional role or with a secondary role such as a transition between functionally ‘‘relevant’’ synchronized states. In this work, rather than studying synchrony we focus on desynchronous oscillations and investigate their functional roles {{in the context of}} a sensorimotor coordination task. In particular, we address the questions: a) how does the informational content of the sensorimotor activity present in a complete dynamical description of phase relations change as such a description is reduced to the dynamics of <b>synchronous</b> <b>oscillations?</b> and b) to what extent are desynchronous oscillations as causally relevant as synchronous ones to the generation of functional sensorimotor coordination? These questions are addressed with a model of a simulated agent performing a functional sensorimotor coordination task controlled by an oscillatory network. The results suggest that: i) desynchronized phase relations carry as much information about sensorimotor activity as synchronized phase relations; and ii) phase relations between oscillators with near-zero frequency difference carry a relatively higher causal relevance than the rest of the phase relations to the sensorimotor coordination; however, overall a privileged functional causal contribution can not be attributed to either <b>synchronous</b> or desynchronous <b>oscillations...</b>|$|R
