The essential sexual organ is the testis (T.), a compact <b>mass</b> <b>of</b> <b>coiling</b> tubuli, which opens by a number of ducts, the vasa efferentia, into a looser and softer epididymis (ep.), which sends the sexual product onward through a vas deferens (v.d.), to open {{at the base of the}} uterus masculinus. The urinary bladder and ureters correspond with those of the female, and the common urogenital duct (= vestibule), the urethra, is prolonged into an erectile penis (P.) surrounded by a fold of skin, the prepuce. A prostate gland (pr.), contributes to the male sexual fluid. The character of the essential male element, the spermatozoon, the general nature of the reproductive process, will be conveniently deferred until the chapters upon development are reached.|$|R

Copper wire provides an easily manufactured, general purpose voice coil, at a reasonable cost.

40|$|The {{electromagnetic}} force on a helical coil becomes smaller by decreasing the coil pitch parameter {{which is the}} angle <b>of</b> the <b>coil</b> to the toroidal direction.

Another important item in a helical reactor is the distance between the helical coil and the plasma to gain enough space for blankets. In order to reduce the <b>mass</b> <b>of</b> the <b>coil</b> supports, a lower aspect ratio is advantageous, and an optimum value of the pitch parameter will exist around 1. 2 and 1. 0 for the helical systems of the pole numbers of 2 and 3, respectively...|$|R

In this work, a controllable growth of Ni particles was fulfilled by liquid phase reduction of nickel sulfate with hydrazine hydrate. The impacts of the reaction temperature, NaOH concentration, and reaction time on the particle size and purity were investigated. The as-deposited Ni particles were characterized by scanning electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction. In addition, these Ni particles were also applied in preparing high-purity CCFs both on graphite and ceramic substrates. The diameter of the as-grown carbon microcoil was about 500  nm, and the related growth mechanism was discussed.|$|R

She drifted forward as if scarcely conscious, her long blanched face lifted up, not to see the world. She was rich. She wore a dress of silky, frail velvet, of pale yellow colour, and she carried a lot of small rose-coloured cyclamens. Her shoes and stockings were of brownish grey, like the feathers on her hat, her hair was heavy, she drifted along with a peculiar fixity of the hips, a strange unwilling motion. She was impressive, in her lovely pale-yellow and brownish-rose, yet macabre, something repulsive.

40|$|The direct {{measurement}} of moment mobility, employing a twin exciter technique, is theoretically and experimentally examined. This is continued by a theoretical and experimental analysis of an improved technique using source signal filtering, for two degrees of freedom, for {{the measurement of}} multidirectional mobilities. Finally some application utilizing mobilities are presented. Special attention is given to moment mobility as {{this is the most}} difficult to measure and two measurement set-ups are studied, the I-like configuration and the T-like configuration. It is shown theoretically and experimentally that the <b>mass</b> <b>of</b> the measuring equipment can give large errors in moment mobility measurements and an approximate correction is given to improve measured results. One measure of excitation precision is found by forming a quotient between the two exciting forces. By theoretical examination, that includes the <b>mass</b> <b>of</b> exciter <b>coils,</b> the deviation <b>of</b> this force quotient from unity is explained. It is shown that the I-like configuration, due to its orientation, gives better results for beam-like structures. A sophisticated technique to measure multidirectional mobilities in two degrees of freedom, using source signal filtering to counteract mass loading and rotational inertia loading caused by the measuring equipment, is theoretically derived and experimentally tested on a freely suspended beam. The source signal filtering effects the force quotient to tend to unity thus ensuring proper force and moment excitations. The technique is shown to function in this initial work and can form the basis for a continued application to all six degrees of freedom of motion. Some examples in the application of multidirectional mobilities are presented for vibration isolation prediction and measurement, transfer path analysis, and energy flow propagation in a T-shaped beam.
