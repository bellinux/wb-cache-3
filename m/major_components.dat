5|$|The three <b>major</b> <b>components</b> of peat are humic acid, humins, and fulvic acid. Of these, humins {{give the}} most {{reliable}} date as they are insoluble in alkali {{and less likely to}} contain contaminants from the sample's environment. A particular difficulty with dried peat is the removal of rootlets, which are likely to be hard to distinguish from the sample material.|$|E
5|$|Its <b>major</b> <b>components</b> were a {{spaceplane}} orbiter with {{an external}} fuel tank and two solid-fuel launch rockets at its side. The external tank, which {{was bigger than}} the spacecraft itself, was the only major component that was not reused. The shuttle could orbit in altitudes of 185–643km (115–400 miles) and carry a maximum payload (to low orbit) of 24,400kg (54,000lb). Missions could last from 5 to 17 days and crews could be from 2 to 8 astronauts.|$|E

High tech, health services and biotechnology are other <b>major</b> <b>components</b> of the city's economy; numerous medical offices, laboratories, and associated companies are located in the city.

5|$|Another {{difficulty}} {{the engineers}} struggled with {{was how to}} deal with radioactive contamination. Once the canyons began processing irradiated slugs, the machinery would become so radioactive that it would be unsafe for humans ever to come in contact with it. The engineers therefore had to devise methods to allow for the replacement of any component via remote control. They came up with a modular cell concept, which allowed <b>major</b> <b>components</b> to be removed and replaced by an operator sitting in a heavily shielded overhead crane. This method required early practical application of two technologies that later gained widespread use: Teflon, used as a gasket material, and closed-circuit television, used to give the crane operator a better view of the process.|$|E

5|$|Even {{in studies}} {{restricted}} to postsynaptic events, investigators have not determined {{the location of}} the protein synthesis that underlies L-LTP. Specifically, it is unclear whether protein synthesis takes place in the postsynaptic cell body or in its dendrites. Despite having observed ribosomes (the <b>major</b> <b>components</b> of the protein synthesis machinery) in dendrites as early as the 1960s, prevailing wisdom was that the cell body was the predominant site of protein synthesis in neurons. This reasoning was not seriously challenged until the 1980s, when investigators reported observing protein synthesis in dendrites whose connection to their cell body had been severed. More recently, investigators have demonstrated that this type of local protein synthesis is necessary for some types of LTP.|$|E
5|$|In 2008, it was {{announced}} that I Corps was to deploy to Iraq in 2009, to replace XVIII Airborne Corps in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom. Soldiers of the corps trained for a year in preparation for the deployment, which began on 9 April 2009. I Corps filled the role of Multi-National Corps - Iraq at Al-Faw Palace. In January 2010, Multi-National Corps - Iraq integrated with Multi-National Forces - Iraq (MNF-I) and Multi-National Security Transition Command – Iraq (MNSTC-I) to form United States Forces - Iraq (USF-I). Over its one-year deployment, the corps oversaw the responsible drawdown of <b>major</b> <b>components</b> of US Forces in Iraq. I Corps returned from Iraq in March 2010 following their RIP/TOA with III Corps.|$|E
5|$|Promyelocytic leukaemia bodies (PML bodies) are spherical bodies found {{scattered}} throughout the nucleoplasm, measuring around 0.1–1.0 µm. They are known {{by a number of}} other names, including nuclear domain 10 (ND10), Kremer bodies, and PML oncogenic domains. PML bodies are named after one of their <b>major</b> <b>components,</b> the promyelocytic leukemia protein (PML). They are often seen in the nucleus in association with Cajal bodies and cleavage bodies. PML bodies belong to the nuclear matrix, an ill-defined super-structure of the nucleus proposed to anchor and regulate many nuclear functions, including DNA replication, transcription, or epigenetic silencing. The PML protein is the key organizer of these domains that recruits an ever-growing number of proteins, whose only common known feature to date is their ability to be SUMOylated. Yet, pml-/- mice (which have their PML gene deleted) cannot assemble nuclear bodies, develop normally and live well, demonstrating that PML bodies are dispensable for most basic biological functions.|$|E

No. 36002 was almost complete, No. 36003 was without its outer casing, and Nos. 360045 were little more than sets of frames, although most of their <b>major</b> <b>components</b> had been constructed at Eastleigh and Brighton and were stored ready for fitting. With no prospect of further money being allocated by the Railway Executive for their completion, the unfinished locomotives were put into store at various depots around the former Southern Railway network pending a decision on their future.|$|E
5|$|Vanajan Autotehdas Oy (VAT) was a {{producer}} of heavy vehicles based in Hämeenlinna, Finland. The company was founded as Yhteissisu Oy in 1943 by the Finnish government {{and a number of}} major Finnish companies with the aim of producing lorries and buses for the Finnish Defence Forces. World War II was over before the company could start series production; it was renamed Vanajan Autotehdas and the marque became Vanaja. Subsequently, the production consisted of outdated lorry models, partly built from military surplus materials. After overcoming initial difficulties, the company modernised its products, became profitable and grew until the mid 1950s. Many <b>major</b> <b>components,</b> including engines, were imported. Diesel engines became widely available in 1955, and in 1959 VAT introduced its most significant innovation, the full load lifting tandem axle mechanism, which improved off-road capability significantly; the system is now used in Sisu vehicles.|$|E
5|$|Wind blowing {{over the}} surface of the sea causes {{friction}} at the interface between air and sea. Not only does this cause waves to form but it also makes the surface seawater move {{in the same direction as}} the wind. Although winds are variable, in any one place they predominantly blow from a single direction and thus a surface current can be formed. Westerly winds are most frequent in the mid-latitudes while easterlies dominate the tropics. When water moves in this way, other water flows in to fill the gap and a circular movement of surface currents known as a gyre is formed. There are five main gyres in the world's oceans: two in the Pacific, two in the Atlantic, and one in the Indian Ocean. The North Atlantic gyre that produces the Sargasso Sea accumulates salinity levels as high as 38‰. Other smaller gyres are found in lesser seas and a single gyre flows around Antarctica. These gyres have followed the same routes for millennia, guided by the topography of the land, the wind direction, and the Coriolis effect. The surface currents flow in a clockwise direction in the Northern Hemisphere and anticlockwise in the Southern Hemisphere. The water moving away from the equator is warm, while that flowing towards it has lost most of its heat. These currents tend to moderate the Earth's climate, cooling the equatorial region, and warming regions at higher latitudes. Global climate and weather forecasts are powerfully affected by the world ocean, so global climate modelling makes use of ocean circulation models as well as models of other <b>major</b> <b>components</b> such as the atmosphere, land surfaces, aerosols, and sea ice. Ocean models make use of a branch of physics, geophysical fluid dynamics, that describes the large-scale flow of fluids such as seawater.|$|E
