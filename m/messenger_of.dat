5|$|A bronze-covered door, {{with relief}} panels {{depicting}} figures, opens onto the entrance hall. In Burges's time {{the door had}} a letterbox, {{in the form of}} Mercury, the <b>messenger</b> <b>of</b> the gods. The letterbox is now lost, but a contemporary copy is in the collection of The Higgins Art Gallery & Museum. The porch contains a white marble seat and column, and on the floor is a mosaic of Pinkie, a favourite poodle of Burges. Cartooned by H.W. Lonsdale, it resembles the cave canem floor at Pompei.|$|E
5|$|It {{is unclear}} when the Qedarites {{ceased to exist}} as a {{separately}} defined confederation or people. Allies with the Nabataeans, {{it is likely that}} they were absorbed into the Nabataean state around the 2nd century CE. In Islam, Isma'il is considered to be the ancestral forefather of the Arab people, and in traditional Islamic historiography, Muslim historians have assigned great importance in their accounts to his first two sons (Nebaioth and Qedar), with the genealogy of Muhammad, the <b>Messenger</b> <b>of</b> God in Islam, alternately assigned to one or the other son, depending on the scholar.|$|E

5|$|Sculptural {{fragments}} to Rodin were autonomous works, and {{he considered}} them {{the essence of}} his artistic statement. His fragments– perhaps lacking arms, legs, or a head– took sculpture further from its traditional role of portraying likenesses, and into a realm where forms existed for their own sake. Notable examples are The Walking Man, Meditation without Arms, and Iris, <b>Messenger</b> <b>of</b> the Gods.|$|E
5|$|The {{battle of}} Uhud {{is the second}} of the two main battles {{featured}} in Moustapha Akkad's 1976 film centering on the life of Muhammad, Mohammad, <b>Messenger</b> <b>of</b> God. The other battle featured is the battle of Badr. The battle of Uhud is also depicted in the 2004 animated film, , directed by Richard Rich, and in the 2012 TV series Farouk Omar. The cave in Mount Uhud where Muhammad rested temporarily during the battle has also received recent media attention in the light of proposals by some Islamic scholars for it to be destroyed.|$|E
5|$|The {{voice and}} {{appearance}} of the common loon has made it prominent in several Native American tales. These include an Ojibwe story of a loon that created the world, and a Micmac saga describing Kwee-moo, the loon who was a special <b>messenger</b> <b>of</b> Glooscap (Glu-skap), the tribal hero. The tale of the loon's necklace was handed down in many versions among Pacific Coast peoples. The Delaware in the east of North America and the Buryats of Siberia also had creation stories involving the loon.|$|E

5|$|Bahá'u'lláh {{stated that}} he was a <b>messenger</b> <b>of</b> God, and he used the term Manifestation of God to define the concept of an {{intermediary}} between humanity and God. In the Bahá'í writings, the Manifestations of God are a series of interrelated personages who speak with a divine voice and who reflect the attributes of the divine into the human world for the progress and advancement of human morals and civilization. The Manifestations of God, as explained by Bahá'u'lláh, are not incarnations of God, but have a two-fold station; one which is the divine in that they reveal God's attributes, but not God's essence, and one which is human in that they represent the physical qualities of common man, and have human limitations. Bahá'u'lláh wrote that God will never manifest his essence into the world.|$|E
5|$|Hermes– The former God of Speed and Commerce, the <b>Messenger</b> <b>of</b> the Gods, and {{the father}} of Ceryx. Hermes participated in the Olympian wager in the God of War comic series by {{choosing}} Danaus to be his champion. In God of War III, Hermes taunted Kratos about murdering his family during Kratos' assault on Mount Olympus, leading to a chase through the city of Olympia. Kratos eventually caught Hermes off guard, killed him, which released a plague on the world, and took his boots, the Boots of Hermes, as his own. The character was voiced by Greg Ellis in God of War III.|$|E

Vice President Coolidge was in Vermont visiting his family home, which had neither electricity nor a telephone, when he received word by <b>messenger</b> <b>of</b> Harding's death. He dressed, said a prayer, and came downstairs to greet the reporters who had assembled. His father, a notary public and justice of the peace, administered {{the oath of office}} in the family's parlor by the light of a kerosene lamp at 2:47a.m. on August 3, 1923; President Coolidge then went back to bed.|$|E

5|$|Shortly {{thereafter}} he {{was expelled}} from Tehran to Baghdad, in the Ottoman Empire; then to Constantinople (now Istanbul); and then to Adrianople (now Edirne). In 1863, {{at the time of}} his banishment from Baghdad to Constantinople, Bahá'u'lláh declared his claim to a divine mission to his family and followers. Tensions then grew between him and Subh-i-Azal, the appointed leader of the Bábís who did not recognize Bahá'u'lláh's claim. Throughout the rest of his life Bahá'u'lláh gained the allegiance of most of the Bábís, who came to be known as Bahá'ís. Beginning in 1866, he began declaring his mission as a <b>Messenger</b> <b>of</b> God in letters to the world's religious and secular rulers, including Pope Pius IX, Napoleon III, and Queen Victoria.|$|E
5|$|The ancient Greeks and Romans celebrated phallic {{festivals and}} built a shrine with an erect phallus to honor Hermes, <b>messenger</b> <b>of</b> the gods. Those figures {{may be related to}} the ancient Egyptian deity Min who was {{depicted}} holding his erect phallus. Figures of women with a phallus for a head have been found across Greece and Yugoslavia. Phallic symbolism was prevalent in the architectural tradition of ancient Babylon. The Romans, who were deeply superstitious, also often used phallic imagery in their architecture and domestic items. The ancient cultures of many parts of the Far East, including Indonesia, India (such as the Lingam), Korea and Japan, used the phallus as a symbol of fertility in motifs on their temples and in other areas of everyday life.|$|E
5|$|The second kingdom was {{attested to}} in {{contemporaneous}} sources; in an inscription, Gudea of Lagash asked for cedars {{to be brought}} from Urshu {{in the mountains of}} Ebla, indicating Ebla's territory included Urshu north of Carchemish in modern-day Turkey. Texts that dates to the seventh year of Amar-Sin (c. 2040 BC), a ruler of the Ur III empire, mention a <b>messenger</b> <b>of</b> the Ensí ("Megum") of Ebla. The second kingdom was considered a vassal by the Ur III government, but the nature of the relation is unknown and it included the payment of tribute. A formal recognition of Ur's overlordship appears to be a condition for the right of trade with that empire.|$|E

2500|$|In principle, a Bahá’í can {{certainly}} affirm that <b>Messengers</b> <b>of</b> God have indeed {{been sent to}} all peoples, according to Bahá’í belief, but that {{there is simply no}} conclusive way to attest legendary culture heroes individually. Under no circumstances does this prevent a real appreciation of such legends, and of the spiritual and cultural values enshrined in them. Thus, Bahá’í authorities may consider adding the category of (rather than names <b>of)</b> <b>Messengers</b> <b>of</b> God to First Nations, or <b>Messengers</b> <b>of</b> God to Indigenous Peoples. The problem now is no longer the principle, but rather the question of names.|$|R
5|$|The stamps were {{designed}} by Richard J. King and recess printed by Waterlow and Sons, London, until 1961, and thereafter by De La Rue & Co, Dublin. The designs feature the Flight of the Angel Victor– <b>Messenger</b> <b>of</b> St. Patrick– carrying the Voice of the Irish 'Vox Hiberniæ' over the world flying over four well-known Irish historical landmarks, one {{from each of the}} four provinces of Ireland: Lough Derg (3d and 8d values), Rock of Cashel (1d, 1/3 and 1/5 values), Glendalough (1/- value) and Croagh Patrick (6d value). These were printed in sheets of 60 stamps with an 'e' watermark.|$|E
5|$|A major {{figure in}} Islam, Jesus (commonly transliterated as ʾĪsā) is {{considered}} to be a <b>messenger</b> <b>of</b> God (Allah) and the Messiah (al-Masih) who was sent to guide the Children of Israel (Bani Isra'il) with a new scripture, the Gospel (referred to in Islam as Injil). Muslims regard the gospels of the New Testament as inauthentic, and believe that Jesus' original message was lost or altered and that Muhammad came later to restore it. Belief in Jesus (and all other messengers of God) is a requirement for being a Muslim. The Quran mentions Jesus by name 25 times—more often than Muhammad—and emphasizes that Jesus was a mortal human who, like all other prophets, had been divinely chosen to spread God's message. While the Qur'an acknowledges the Virgin birth of Jesus, he {{is considered to}} be neither the incarnation nor the son of God. Islamic texts emphasize a strict notion of monotheism (tawhid) and forbid the association of partners with God, which would be idolatry. Like all prophets in Islam, Jesus is considered a Muslim.|$|E
5|$|In 1918, Kolbe {{was ordained}} a priest. In July 1919 he {{returned}} to the newly independent Poland, where he was active in promoting the veneration of the Immaculate Virgin Mary. He was strongly opposed to leftist – in particular, communist – movements. From 1919 to 1922 he taught at the Kraków seminary. Around that time, as well as earlier in Rome, he suffered from tuberculosis, which forced him to take a lengthy leave of absence from his teaching duties. In January 1922 he founded the monthly periodical Rycerz Niepokalanej (Knight of the Immaculate), a devotional publication based on French Le Messager du Coeur de Jesus (<b>Messenger</b> <b>of</b> the Heart of Jesus). From 1922 to 1926 he operated a religious publishing press in Grodno. As his activities grew in scope, in 1927 he founded a new Conventual Franciscan monastery at Niepokalanów near Warsaw, which became a major religious publishing center. A junior seminary was opened there two years later.|$|E

5|$|In her dream, Trijata sees Rama and {{his brother}} Lakshmana riding the {{celestial}} elephant Airavata toward Sita. Rama takes Sita in his lap and rises high in the sky, allowing Sita to touch the Sun and the Moon. Then the trio ride to Lanka {{and get into the}} Pushpaka Vimana (aerial chariot of Ravana) to fly towards the north, while Ravana, drenched in oil and with a red complexion, lies on the ground. Ravana then heads south on a donkey and falls in a pit of dung. A black woman in a red saree, drags him to the south. Other members of Ravana's family, like his brother Kumbhakarna and son Indrajit, face similar fates. Ravana's brother Vibishana is seen in regal white garments, riding a four tusked elephant near the Pushpaka Vimana. The city of Lanka drowns in the ocean and a monkey (vanara) <b>messenger</b> <b>of</b> Rama burns the city. Trijata advises the rakshasis to take refuge in Sita and apologize to her; in turn, Sita promises that if Trijata's dream materializes, she will protect her rakshasi guards.|$|E
5|$|Mandodari is {{described}} as a beautiful woman in Valmiki's Ramayana. When Hanuman, the monkey <b>messenger</b> <b>of</b> Rama, comes to Lanka in search of Sita, he is stupefied by Mandodari's beauty when he enters Ravana's bed chambers and mistakes Mandodari for Sita. When Hanuman finally finds Sita, he finds Ravana threatening to kill Sita unless she marries him. Ravana raises his sword to behead Sita when she refuses. Mandodari saves Sita by holding Ravana's hand. Mandodari says that the murder of a woman is a heinous sin and thus Ravana should not kill Sita. She asks Ravana to entertain himself with his other wives and give up the idea of having Sita as his wife. Ravana spares Sita's life, but does not give up his wish to marry Sita. Though Mandodari considers Sita inferior to her in beauty and ancestry, Mandodari acknowledges Sita's devotion to Rama and compares her to goddesses like Sachi and Rohini.|$|E
5|$|Assisted in her {{investigations}} by , Arisa's classmate who learns Tsubasa's identity, she encounters , Arisa's {{best friend}} whom the King manipulates; , Arisa's boyfriend; , a transfer student whom Arisa had befriended online and {{who serves as}} the <b>messenger</b> <b>of</b> the King; and , Manabe's childhood friend who lost the use of her legs after a failed suicide attempt provoked by the King. Arisa awakens from her coma, but pretends to have amnesia and returns to Midori's side. She reveals {{that she was the}} original King: although she granted harmless wishes in the beginning, she eventually stole the answers to an exam for Mariko's wish, fearing disappointment if she refused. Midori caught her in the act, and she shared the task of granting the class's wishes with him, until he injured her mother, in an attempt to grant her wish. Midori then replaced her as King, using violence and bullying to grant wishes. Horrified by his cruelty and the perceived similarities between them, she then reached out to her twin, hoping that Tsubasa would be able to uncover the truth. Tsubasa learns that Midori suffered psychological trauma in his childhood after being abandoned by his mother and witnessing his twin, Akari, die of neglect. She later foils his attempt to kill her mother, as he hated his own mother and believed that Arisa hated hers as well. Arisa confesses that she loves him for noticing her loneliness, and he realizes that he loves her too. In the conclusion, Arisa's mother spends more time with her, and Arisa reconciles with Tsubasa.|$|E
