40|$|The Bhopal tragedy 25 (10 + 15) years after. Almost 25 {{years have}} passed after the world’s worst {{industrial}} accident: <b>methylisocyanate</b> gas leaked from a pesticide plant owned by the US company, Union Carbide (UC), into a densely populated area of Bhopal, in central India killing than 10000 people, and making hundreds of thousands disabled. After the recent and very mild sentence against Union Carbide against 7 administrator of UC (2 years of jail and a fine of little more than 2000 euros), a contribution published 10 years after the tragedy, that documented the efforts done and problems encountered in assessing responsibilities and setting up networks able to permanently document deaths, disabilities and suffering of people involved...|$|E
40|$|Cloretazine (VNP 40101 M) is a newly {{synthesized}} {{alkylating agent}} {{belonging to a}} novel class of alkylating agents called 1, 2 -bis(sulfonyl) hydrazines. Agents that belong to this class do not produce vinylating and chloroethylating species, and hence this class of alkylating agents {{is thought to have}} minimal systemic toxicity. Cloretazine produces two short-lived active species: 1, 2 -bis(methylsulfonyl) - 1 -(2 -chloroethyl) hydrazine (a chloroethylating species) and a thiophilic carbamoylating <b>methylisocyanate</b> species. The chloroethylating species preferentially produces lesions at the O 6 position of guanine. The <b>methylisocyanate</b> species may inhibit O 6 -alkylguanine-DNA alkyltransferase, an important mechanism of resistance against alkylating agents. The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine the efficacy and tolerability of Cloretazine in patients with recurrent glioblastoma multiforme. The basis for the determination of efficacy was the proportion of patients alive without evidence of disease progression six months after initiation of treatment. Patients with recurrent glioblastoma multiforme received Cloretazine (300 mg/m 2) intravenously every six weeks. Radiographic response, survival data, and toxicity were assessed. Thirty-two patients were enrolled. Median age was 56 years; 24 patients (75 %) were men. At six months, two patients were alive and progression free, so the six-month progression-free survival (PFS) was 6 %. The median PFS was 6. 3 weeks. There were no objective radiographic responses. Twelve patients had stable disease for at least one cycle, but only two patients received more than three cycles. Nine patients experienced grade 4 thrombocytopenia and three patients experienced grade 4 neutropenia. Cloretazine administered every six weeks was relatively well tolerated, although this schedule has insignificant activity for patients with recurrent glioblastoma multiform...|$|E
40|$|Prevent ion ConferenceEnvironmental {{regulations}} in the United States have grown dramatically since the 1960 ’s. The environmental movement gained significant momentum on April 22, 1970, when Earth Day was inaugurated {{to call attention}} {{to a wide range of}} severe environmental problems across our country. Out of that movement came a series of environmental laws that were aimed at stopping the flow of pollutants into the water, air, and soil. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) was formed to write national regulations and to develop environmental programs. Laws addressing clean air, clean water, and waste were passed in response to the public’s concern over issues like belching smokestacks, smog in large cities, fish kills, rivers on fire, and chemicals oozing out of the ground. The release of <b>methylisocyanate</b> in Bhopal, India, which resulted in the death and injury of thousands of workers and villagers, brought to reality the public’s fear of the hazards of living near a chemical factory. As a result, communities and governments required companies to look more closely at their processes and to be more open with their stakeholders. *More recently, incidents like the oil spill in Alaska, the clearing of rain forests, ozone depletion, abnormal frogs, and fish depletion have heightened public concerns globally. There is increased recognition that what happens in one area of the world can have impact across national and international borders, and that we all have a stake in protecting the environment. The impetuses for introducing environmental management standards was bolstered by the success of International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 9000 international quality management standards. These standards have been adopted in over 80 countries and in some instances have become a prerequisite for doing business. The combination of business and environmental aspects in the international arena began after the 1972 United Nations Conference on Human Environment, which established th...|$|E
40|$|The {{reactions}} of OH radicals with CH 3 NHCHO (N-methylformamide, MF) and (CH 3) 2 NCHO (N,N-dimethylformamide, DMF) {{have been studied}} by experimental and computational methods. Rate coefficients were determined {{as a function of}} temperature (T = 260 – 295 K) and pressure (P = 30 – 600 mbar) by the flash photolysis/laser-induced fluorescence technique. OH radicals were produced by laser flash photolysis of 2, 4 -pentanedione or tert-butyl hydroperoxide under pseudo-first order conditions in an excess of the corresponding amide. The rate coefficients obtained show negative temperature dependences that can be parameterized as follows: kOH+MF = (1. 3 ± 0. 4) × 10 − 12 exp(3. 7 kJ mol− 1 /(RT)) cm 3 s− 1 and kOH+DMF = (5. 5 ± 1. 7) × 10 − 13 exp(6. 6 kJ mol− 1 /(RT)) cm 3 s− 1. The rate coefficient kOH+MF shows very weak positive pressure dependence whereas kOH+DMF was found to be independent of pressure. The Arrhenius equations given, within their uncertainty, are valid for the entire pressure range of our experiments. Furthermore, MF and DMF smog-chamber photo-oxidation experiments were monitored by proton-transfer-reaction time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Atmospheric MF photo-oxidation results in 65 % CH 3 NCO (<b>methylisocyanate),</b> 16 % (CHO) 2 NH, and NOx-dependent amounts of CH 2 [double bond, length as m-dash]NH and CH 3 NHNO 2 as primary products, while DMF photo-oxidation results in around 35 % CH 3 N(CHO) 2 as primary product and 65 % meta-stable (CH 3) 2 NC(O) OONO 2 degrading to NOx-dependent amounts of CH 3 N[double bond, length as m-dash]CH 2 (N-methylmethanimine), (CH 3) 2 NNO (N-nitroso dimethylamine) and (CH 3) 2 NNO 2 (N-nitro dimethylamine). The potential for nitramine formation in MF photo-oxidation is comparable to that of methylamine whereas the potential to form nitrosamine and nitramine in DMF photo-oxidation is larger than for dimethylamine. Quantum chemistry supported atmospheric degradation mechanisms for MF and DMF are presented. Rate coefficients and initial branching ratios calculated with statistical rate theory based on molecular data from quantum chemical calculations at the CCSD(T*) -F 12 a/aug-cc-pVTZ//MP 2 /aug-cc-pVTZ level of theory show satisfactory agreement with the experimental results. It turned out that adjustment of calculated threshold energies by 0. 2 to 8. 8 kJ mol− 1 lead to agreement between experimental and predicted results...|$|E
