25|$|In a pooled {{analysis}} of 7 comparative trials with imipramine, <b>milnacipran</b> and imipramine {{were shown to}} have comparable efficacy while <b>milnacipran</b> was significantly better tolerated. A pooled {{analysis of}} studies comparing <b>milnacipran</b> and SSRIs concluded a superior efficacy for <b>milnacipran</b> with similar tolerability for <b>milnacipran</b> and SSRIs. A more recent meta-analysis of 6 studies involving more than 1,000 patients showed no distinction between <b>milnacipran</b> and SSRIs in efficacy or discontinuation rates, including discontinuation for side effects or lack of efficacy. A meta-analysis {{of a total of}} 16 randomized controlled trials with more than 2200 patients concluded that there were no statistically significant differences in efficacy, acceptability and tolerability when comparing <b>milnacipran</b> with other antidepressant agents. However, compared with TCAs, significantly fewer patients taking <b>milnacipran</b> dropped out due to adverse events. As with other antidepressants, 1 to 3 weeks may elapse before significant antidepressant action becomes clinically evident.|$|E
25|$|<b>Milnacipran</b> {{should not}} be used during {{pregnancy}} because it may cross the placenta barrier and no clinical data exists on harmful effects in humans and animal studies. <b>Milnacipran</b> is contraindicated during lactation because it is excreted in the milk, and it is not known if it is harmful to the newborn.|$|E
25|$|<b>Milnacipran</b> {{inhibits}} the reuptake of serotonin and norepinephrine in an approximately 1:3 ratio, respectively; {{in practical}} use {{this means a}} relatively balanced action upon both neurotransmitters. Increasing both neurotransmitters concentration simultaneously works synergistically to treat both depression and fibromyalgia. <b>Milnacipran</b> exerts no significant actions on H1, α1, D1, D2, and mACh receptors, nor on benzodiazepine and opioid binding sites.|$|E
25|$|In January 2009 the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) {{approved}} <b>milnacipran</b> (under {{the brand}} name Savella) only {{for the treatment of}} fibromyalgia, making it the third medication approved for this purpose in the United States. In July and November 2009, the European Medicines Agency refused marketing authorization for a <b>milnacipran</b> product (under {{the brand name}} Impulsor) for the treatment of fibromylagia.|$|E
25|$|During its {{development}} for fibromyalgia, <b>milnacipran</b> was evaluated utilizing a composite responder approach. To {{be considered as}} a responder for the composite ‘treatment of ﬁbromyalgia’ endpoint, each patient had to show concurrent and clinically meaningful improvements in pain, physical function and global impression of disease status. A systematic review in 2015 showed moderate relief for a minority of people with fibromyalgia. <b>Milnacipran</b> was associated with increased adverse events and discontinuing use of the drug.|$|E
25|$|<b>Milnacipran</b> is well absorbed after oral dosing {{and has a}} {{bioavailability}} of 85%. Meals do {{not have}} an influence on the rapidity and extent of absorption. Peak plasma concentrations are reached 2 hours after oral dosing. The elimination half-life of 8 hours is not increased by liver impairment and old age, but by significant renal disease. <b>Milnacipran</b> is conjugated to the inactive glucuronide and excreted in the urine as unchanged drug and conjugate. Only traces of active metabolites are found.|$|E
25|$|Triptans — {{there have}} been rare postmarketing reports of hyperserotonergia (serotonin syndrome). If {{concomitant}} treatment of <b>milnacipran</b> with a triptan is clinically warranted, careful observation of patient is advised when starting or increasing dosages.|$|E
25|$|Health Canada and the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) have {{approved}} pregabalin and duloxetine, {{for the management}} of fibromyalgia. The FDA also approved <b>milnacipran,</b> but the European Medicines Agency refused marketing authority.|$|E
25|$|<b>Milnacipran</b> (trade names Ixel, Savella, Dalcipran, Toledomin) is a serotonin–norepinephrine reuptake {{inhibitor}} (SNRI) used in {{the clinical}} treatment of fibromyalgia. It is not approved for the clinical treatment of major depressive disorder in the USA, {{but it is in}} other countries.|$|E
25|$|Dual serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors such as duloxetine, venlafaxine, and <b>milnacipran,</b> {{as well as}} {{tricyclic}} antidepressants such as amitriptyline, nortriptyline, and desipramine {{are considered}} first-line medications for this condition. While amitriptyline and desipramine {{have been used as}} first-line treatments, the quality of evidence to support their use is poor.|$|E
25|$|It {{can take}} up to three months to derive benefit from the {{antidepressant}} amitriptyline and between three and six months to gain the maximal response from duloxetine, <b>milnacipran,</b> and pregabalin. Some medications have the potential to cause withdrawal symptoms when stopping so gradual discontinuation may be warranted particularly for antidepressants and pregabalin.|$|E
25|$|Serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) such as {{venlafaxine}} {{have shown}} similar effectiveness to the SSRIs. In Japan, <b>Milnacipran</b> {{is used in}} the treatment of Taijin kyofusho, a Japanese variant of social anxiety disorder. The atypical antidepressants mirtazapine and bupropion have been studied for the treatment of social anxiety disorder, and rendered mixed results.|$|E
25|$|<b>Milnacipran</b> {{was first}} {{approved}} {{for the treatment}} of major depressive episodes in France in December 1996. It is currently marketed (as Ixel) for this indication in over 45 countries worldwide including several European countries such as Austria, Bulgaria, Finland, France, Portugal, and Russia. It is also available in Japan (as Toledomin) and Mexico (as Dalcipran). Cypress Bioscience bought the exclusive rights for approval and marketing of the drug for any purpose in the United States and Canada in 2003 from the manufacturer Laboratoires Pierre Fabre.|$|E
25|$|The {{treatment}} of fibromyalgia can be difficult. Recommendations often include getting enough sleep, exercising regularly, and eating a healthy diet. Cognitive behavioral therapy {{may also be}} helpful. The medications duloxetine, <b>milnacipran,</b> or pregabalin may be used. Use of opioid pain medication is controversial with some stating their use is poorly supported by evidence and others saying that weak opioids may be reasonable if other medications are not effective. Dietary supplements also lack evidence to support their use. While fibromyalgia can last a long time, it does not result in death or tissue damage.|$|E

2500|$|The most {{frequently}} occurring adverse reactions (≥ 5% and greater than placebo) were nausea, headache, constipation, dizziness, insomnia, hot flush, hyperhydrosis, vomiting, palpitations, heart rate increase, dry mouth, and hypertension [...] <b>Milnacipran</b> {{can have a}} significant impact on sexual functions, including both a decrease in sexual desire and ability. <b>Milnacipran</b> can cause pain of the testicles in men. [...] The incidence of cardiovascular and anticholinergic side effects was significantly lower compared to TCAs as a controlled study with over 3,300 patients revealed. Elevation of liver enzymes without signs of symptomatic liver disease has been infrequent. Mood swing to mania has also been seen and dictates termination of treatment. In psychotic patients emergence of delirium has been noticed. <b>Milnacipran</b> has a low incidence of sedation but improves sleep (both duration and quality) in depressed patients. In agitated patients or those with suicidal thoughts additive sedative/anxiolytic treatment is usually indicated.|$|E
2500|$|Recently, levomilnacipran, the {{levorotatory}} enantiomer of <b>milnacipran,</b> {{has been}} found to act as an inhibitor of beta-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme-1 (BACE-1), which is responsible for β-amyloid plaque formation, and hence may [...] be a potentially useful drug in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. Other BACE-1 inhibitors, such as CTS-21166 (ASP1720), MK-8931, and AZD3293 are currently in clinical trials for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.|$|E
2500|$|Antidepressants are [...] "associated with {{improvements}} in pain, depression, fatigue, sleep disturbances, and health-related {{quality of life}} in people with FMS." [...] The goal of antidepressants should be symptom reduction and if used long term, their effects should be evaluated against side effects. A small number of people benefit significantly from the SNRIs duloxetine and <b>milnacipran</b> and the tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), such as amitriptyline. However, many people experience more adverse effects than benefits. While amitriptyline {{has been used as a}} first line treatment, the quality of evidence to support this use is poor.|$|E
2500|$|A 2012 {{meta-analysis}} {{concluded that}} antidepressants treatment favorably affects pain, health-related quality of life, depression, {{and sleep in}} fibromyalgia syndrome.

The fraction of people experiencing a 30% pain reduction on tricyclics was 48% versus 28% for placebo. For SSRIs and SNRIs the fraction of people experiencing a 30% pain reduction was 36% (20% in the placebo comparator arms) and 42% (32% in the corresponding placebo comparator arms). Discontinuation of treatment due to side effects was common. Antidepressants including amitriptyline, fluoxetine, duloxetine, <b>milnacipran,</b> moclobemide, and pirlindole are recommended by the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) for the treatment of fibromyalgia based on [...] "limited evidence".|$|E

50|$|The {{conformation}} of <b>milnacipran</b> is {{an important}} part of its pharmacophore. Changing the SAR in <b>milnacipran</b> changes the stereochemistry of the compound and affects the norepinephrine and serotonin concentration. <b>Milnacipran</b> is marketed as a racemic mixture. Effects of <b>milnacipran</b> resides in the (1S,2R)-isomer and substitution of the phenyl group in the (1S,2R)-isomer has negative impact on norepinephrine concentration. <b>Milnacipran</b> has low molecular weight and low lipophilicity. Because of these properties, <b>milnacipran</b> exhibits almost ideal pharmacokinetics in humans such as high bioavailability, low inter-subject variability, limited liver enzyme interaction, moderate tissue distribution and a reasonably long elimination half-life. Milnacipran's lack of drug-drug interactions via cytochrome P450 enzymes is thought to be an attractive feature because many of the central nervous system drugs are highly lipophilic and are mainly eliminated by liver enzymes.|$|E

50|$|<b>Milnacipran</b> is {{structurally}} {{different from}} other SNRIs. The SAR of <b>milnacipran</b> derivatives at transporter level is still largely unclear {{and is based on}} in vivo efficacy that was reported in 1987. N-methylation of <b>milnacipran</b> in substituent group R4 and R5 reduces the norepinephrine and serotonin activity. Researches on different secondary amides in substitution groups R6 and R7 showed that π electrons {{play an important role in}} the interaction between transporters and ligands. A phenyl group in substituent R6 showed effect on norepinephrine transporters. Substituent groups in R6 and R7 with allylic double bond showed significant improved effect on both norepinephrine and serotonin transporters. Studies have shown that when introducing a 2-methyl group in substituent R3 the potency at norepinephrine and serotonin transporters are almost abolished. Methyl groups in substituent groups R1 and R2 also abolished the potency at norepinephrine and serotonin transporters. Researchers found that replacing one of the ethyl groups of <b>milnacipran</b> with an allyl moiety increases the norepinephrine potency. The pharmacophore of <b>milnacipran</b> derivatives is still largely unclear.|$|E
