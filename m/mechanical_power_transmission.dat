5000|$|Electrical power {{transmission}} has replaced <b>mechanical</b> <b>power</b> <b>transmission</b> {{in all but}} the very shortest distances. From the 16th century through the industrial revolution {{to the end of the}} 19th century <b>mechanical</b> <b>power</b> <b>transmission</b> was the norm. The oldest long-distance {{power transmission}} technology involved systems of push-rods (stängenkunst or feldstängen) connecting waterwheels to distant mine-drainage and brine-well pumps. A surviving example from 1780 exists at Bad Kösen that transmits power approximately 200 meters from a waterwheel to a salt well, and from there, an additional 150 meters to a brine evaporator. [...] This technology survived into the 21st century in a handful of oilfields in the US, transmitting power from a central pumping engine to the numerous pump-jacks in the oil field.|$|E

50|$|As is {{the case}} with any vehicle powered by an {{internal}} combustion engine, diesel locomotives require a power transmission system to couple the output of the prime mover to the driving wheels.

40|$|Hybrid {{electric}} vehicles (HEV) have attracted very much attention during the latest years.

50|$|Portable engines were {{in common}} use in industrialised {{countries}} {{from the early}} 19th through early 20th centuries, during an era when <b>mechanical</b> <b>power</b> <b>transmission</b> was widespread. Before that, most power generation and transmission were by animal, water, wind, or human; after that, a combination of electrification (including rural electrification) and modern vehicles and equipment (such as tractors, trucks, cars, engine-generators, and machines with their engines built in) displaced most use of portable engines. In developing countries today, portable engines still have some use (typically {{in the form of}} modern small engines mounted on boards), although the technologies mentioned above increasingly limit their demand there as well.

5000|$|The NuVinci CVT may be {{applicable}} to many different products using a <b>mechanical</b> <b>power</b> <b>transmission.</b> The only application currently commercialized is the internally geared bicycle hub. The NuVinci CVT replaces derailleurs and other internally geared hubs, and provides a gear ratio range of about 350%, similar to that on bicycles with 8- or 9-speed hub gears, or with double chain rings (most racing or fast road bicycles). [...] This range is somewhat less than the 526% range found on bicycles with a Rohloff 14-speed hub gear or most mountain/hybrid/touring bicycles with triple chainrings. By conventional standards, a NuVinci bicycle hub is considered heavy. The second generation model N171B weighs between 3.85 and 3.95 kg, including freewheel and mounting hardware. The N360 model announced early September 2010 weighs 2.45 kg. [...] That same article points out that [...] "the combined weight of Shimano SLX front and rear derailleurs, shifters, freehub and cassette comes out to about 1.3 kg". However, the NuVinci CVT is targeted towards the less weight-conscious (cruiser-, comfort-, and commuter) segments with the latest product introductions the N330 and N380 also being targeted at city, urban, trekking and eMTB (SUV) bikes. Their biggest advantage is the durability, while shifting under load and continuously, which is especially important with the powerful eBike drive systems.|$|E

Typical rotor–shaft assemblies are investigated, illustrating thereby the proce-dures involved.

Only a few hydraulic <b>power</b> <b>transmission</b> networks are still in use; modern hydraulic equipment has a pump built into the machine. In the late 19th century, a hydraulic network might {{have been used in}} a factory, with a central steam engine or water turbine driving a pump and a system of high-pressure pipes transmitting power to various machines.|$|R
40|$|Many a <b>mechanical</b> {{application}} involves <b>power</b> <b>transmission</b> from {{a high-speed}} motor to a low-speed load. However, existing speed-reduction mechanisms are usually a major sink {{of energy and}} information in mechanical transmissions. Energy and positioning information are lost through: (a) friction between sliding components; (b) compliance; and (c) backlash. A novel transmission for speed reduction, Speed-o-Cam, is currently under research at McGill University's Centre for Intelligent Machines (CIM). The transmission {{is based on the}} layout of pure-rolling indexing cam mechanisms, and hence, eliminates backlash and friction. Besides zero backlash and low friction losses, Speed-o-Cam also offers the possibility of high stiffness, another essential attribute for high-accuracy applications. This thesis focuses on the aspects of both model development and mechanical-parameter identification of a spherical prototype of Speed-o-Cam. Our main interest lies in identifying the mechanism stiffness. In order to conduct experiments on the prototype, a testbed was designed and fabricated. A mathematical model of the testbed is first formulated. Based on this model and the results of experiments, the parameters of the Speed-o-Cam prototype are identified. In the process, the stiffness and damping parameters of the couplings of the testbed are also identified. Power efficiency is an important indicator of speed reducing mechanisms. For the Speed-o-Cam prototype, this indicator is also estimated experimentally...|$|R
40|$|Gears {{are one of}} {{the most}} widely applied {{precision}} machine elements in <b>power</b> <b>transmission</b> systems employed in automotive, aerospace, marine, rail and industrial applications because of their reliability, precision, efficiency and versatility. Fundamentally, gears provide a very practical mechanism to transmit motion and <b>mechanical</b> <b>power</b> between two rotating shafts. However, their performance and accuracy are often hampered by tooth failure, vibrations and whine noise. This is most acute in high-speed, high power density geared rotor systems, which is the primary scope of this paper. The present study focuses on the development of a gear pair mathematical model for use to analyze the dynamics of <b>power</b> <b>transmission</b> systems. The theory includes the gear mesh representation derived from results of the quasi-static tooth contact analysis. This proposed gear mesh theory comprising of transmission error, mesh point, mesh stiffness and line-of-action nonlinear, time-varying parameters can be easily incorporated into a variety of transmission system models ranging from the lumped parameter type to detailed finite element representation. The gear dynamic analysis performed led to the discovery of the out-of-phase gear pair torsion modes that are responsible for much of the mechanical problems seen in gearing applications. The paper concludes with a discussion on effectual design approaches to minimize the influence of gear dynamics and to mitigate gear failure in practical <b>power</b> <b>transmission</b> systems...|$|R
