5|$|The site {{chosen for}} the {{construction}} of the power stations was close to the coal <b>mining</b> <b>town</b> of Cambois. Ordnance Survey maps as far back as 1860 show that before building work began the land had been used as open farmland, with fields of varying shapes and sizes.|$|E
5|$|Harold Oliver {{was born}} to Cornish {{immigrants}} James Oliver and Sarah Mill in the gold <b>mining</b> <b>town</b> of Waukaringa. It was common for Cornish people, where mining was a key industry, to move to Australia and use their knowledge to attempt a better life as the economy in Cornwall was waning. During Oliver's childhood in the 1890s the town was home to 600 people. Today it is a ghost town.|$|E
50|$|The towns formed {{unions and}} {{associations}} {{to defend their}} privileges and common interests. The most important unions were the Community of Saxons of Spiš (later reduced and known as the Province of twenty-four Spiš towns), the Lower Hungarian Mining <b>Towns</b> (<b>mining</b> <b>towns</b> in Central Slovakia), Pentapolis (alliance of free royal towns in present-day Eastern Slovakia) and the Upper Hungarian Mining <b>Towns</b> (<b>mining</b> <b>towns</b> in eastern Slovakia including two <b>mining</b> <b>towns</b> in present-day Hungary).|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{examine the}} {{wellbeing}} of families of male mine-workers living in remote <b>mining</b> <b>towns</b> in Australia. Methods: Through an extensive review of available (but limited) social science literature on <b>mining</b> <b>towns</b> this paper explores and identifies the key social issues {{and problems of}} <b>mining</b> <b>towns.</b> Social science and health-related research are used to argue that there are several factors that may negatively affect the relationship and psychological wellbeing of family members. Results: Atypical work schedules of the mining jobs could negatively affect the long-term health of the workers, and could constrain their qualitative participation in domestic roles. Limited availability of resources, services and flexi-time jobs in <b>mining</b> <b>towns</b> marginalise female partners to domestic chores. Higher level of alcohol consumption by workers and their preferred spending of leisure time with workmates symbolise patriarchal culture in <b>mining</b> <b>towns</b> that further marginalises women and could strain marital relationships. These factors could affect the social and emotional health of the children. Conclusion: Interdisciplinary {{studies are needed to}} gain realistic understanding of the dynamics of long-term impacts of long work hours/compressed work weeks, socio-cultural, motivational and environmental factors on the wellbeing of the workers and their families living in <b>mining</b> <b>towns.</b> Family counsellors and mental health professionals working in remote <b>mining</b> <b>towns</b> must take into consideration the likely negative impacts of work and community on individuals and families.

Just over 75% of Utah's population {{is concentrated in}} the four Wasatch Front counties of Salt Lake, Utah, Davis, and Weber. The largest city is the state's capital of Salt Lake City {{with a population of}} 186,440, and the former coal <b>mining</b> <b>town</b> of Scofield is the smallest town with 24 people.|$|E
5|$|At that time, Aspen was a faded <b>mining</b> <b>town</b> whose {{population}} had dwindled {{to fewer than}} a thousand. Later in the decade the first efforts to develop a ski resort began. They continued after World War II, and in the later decades of the 20th century the city began to grow again. Other than paving the road, CDOT was unable to undertake any significant improvements to the highway corridor due to its projects elsewhere {{in the state and}} the requirement to coordinate efforts with the Forest Service, which owns most of the damaged land.|$|E

5|$|In 2004, French {{officials}} {{decided to}} build a satellite museum {{on the site of}} an abandoned coal pit in the former <b>mining</b> <b>town</b> of Lens to relieve the crowded Paris Louvre, increase total museum visits, and improve the industrial north's economy. Six cities were considered for the project: Amiens, Arras, Boulogne-sur-Mer, Calais, Lens, and Valenciennes. In 2004, French Prime Minister Jean-Pierre Raffarin chose Lens to be the site of the new building, the Louvre-Lens. Japanese architects SANAA were selected to design the Lens project in 2005. Museum officials predicted that the new building, capable of receiving about 600works of art, would attract up to 500,000visitors a year when it opened in 2012.|$|E
5|$|In {{the summer}} of 1858, during the Pike's Peak Gold Rush, a group of gold prospectors from Lawrence, Kansas {{established}} Montana City as a <b>mining</b> <b>town</b> {{on the banks of}} the South Platte River in what was then western Kansas Territory. This was the first historical settlement in what was later to become the city of Denver. The site faded quickly, however, and by {{the summer of}} 1859 it was abandoned in favor of Auraria (named after the gold-mining town of Auraria, Georgia), and St. Charles City.|$|E
5|$|Ny-Ålesund is a {{permanent}} settlement based entirely around research. Formerly a <b>mining</b> <b>town,</b> {{it is still a}} company town operated by the Norwegian state-owned Kings Bay. While there is some tourism there, Norwegian authorities limit access to the outpost to minimize impact on the scientific work. Ny-Ålesund has a winter population of 35 and a summer population of 180. The Norwegian Meteorological Institute has outposts at Bjørnøya and Hopen, with respectively ten and four people stationed. Both outposts can also house temporary research staff. Poland operates the Polish Polar Station at Hornsund, with ten permanent residents.|$|E

The two books are an adaptation of the anime series, retelling the early events that trigger Gene and company's search for the Galactic Leyline. Another light novel, , was written by Miho Sakai, illustrated by Takuya Saitou, and released as a single volume on July 14, 2000. The novel features an original plot involving the Outlaw Star crew pursuing a serial killer named Billy McAglen in a <b>mining</b> <b>town</b> called El Dorado.|$|E
5|$|Between 1907 and 1913, a {{development}} boom occurred in Lethbridge, {{making it the}} main marketing, distribution and service centre in southern Alberta. Such municipal projects as a water treatment plant, a power plant, a streetcar system, and exhibition buildings — {{as well as a}} construction boom and rising real estate prices — transformed the <b>mining</b> <b>town</b> into a significant city. Between World WarI and World WarII, however, the city experienced an economic slump. Development slowed, drought drove farmers from their farms, and coal mining rapidly declined from its peak. After World WarII, irrigation of farmland near Lethbridge led to growth in the city's population and economy. Lethbridge College (previously Lethbridge Community College) opened in April 1957 and the University of Lethbridge in 1967.|$|E

40|$|The {{continuous}} mining {{development in}} Australia has been generating intense housing {{pressure in the}} resource boom towns, especially in the <b>mining</b> <b>towns</b> in Queensland and Western Australia. This has impacted on individuals and families with a negative flow on effect for the local and regional economy. This paper aims at exploring housing characteristics, actors and factors of housing demand management in Australian <b>mining</b> <b>towns</b> by using some examples from the Bowen Basin region, Queensland. First this study characterised some specific housing demand and supply issues around Australia and in the mining towns; then the study identified the supply and demand of housing in the Bowen Basin towns. Third this study identified the key actors and factors of housing demand management in the Bowen Basin <b>mining</b> <b>towns.</b> Finally the study provided some strategic guidelines for a better housing demand management in these towns. Such strategies would improve the liveability of these towns and thereby maintain regional sustainability. Lessons learned from this study could be applicable to other <b>mining</b> <b>towns</b> in Australia and elsewhere...|$|R

5|$|In 1986, Waters contributed {{songs and}} a score to the soundtrack of the {{animated}} movie When the Wind Blows, {{based on the}} Raymond Briggs book of the same name. His backing band featuring Paul Carrack was credited as The Bleeding Heart Band. In 1987, Waters released Radio K.A.O.S., a concept album based on a mute man named Billy from an impoverished Welsh <b>mining</b> <b>town</b> who {{has the ability to}} physically tune into radio waves in his head. Billy first learns to communicate with a radio DJ, and eventually to control the world's computers. Angry at the state {{of the world in which}} he lives, he simulates a nuclear attack. Waters followed the release with a supporting tour also in 1987.|$|E
5|$|In 1986–87, McNallen {{worked as}} a peace officer in Stephens County Texas sheriff's office jail and Sheila kept books for an oil company. In 1986, he and Sheila moved to a semi-deserted <b>mining</b> <b>town</b> in the {{mountains}} of California, and there he earned teaching credentials before teaching science and mathematics at a junior high school for six years. During his summer vacations he travelled abroad, during which he met with guerrilla groups active {{in various parts of the}} world, writing articles about them for magazines like Soldier of Fortune. He later related that this experience convinced him of the need for ethnonationalism and ethnic separatism across the world. McNallen also joined the U.S. National Guard and was called up during the 1992 Los Angeles riots.|$|E
5|$|Of Irish descent, O'Reilly's {{paternal}} grandfather Peter {{emigrated from}} Co Cavan, Ulster in 1865. Arriving in Sydney, {{he had been}} a policeman for four years in Ireland and continued in this line of work in New South Wales. After a period, he was sent to Deniliquin in the Riverina, where he settled and married another Irish immigrant Bridget O'Donoghue from Ballinasloe, Co. Galway. O'Reilly's father, Ernest, was a schoolteacher and moved around the areas surrounding the Murray River to study and teach. O'Reilly's mother Mina (née Welsh) was of mixed Irish and English descent, of a third generation family from Adelaide. O'Reilly was born in the opal <b>mining</b> <b>town</b> of White Cliffs, New South Wales. Ernest had been appointed to open the first school in the town, and had helped to build the school and its furniture himself. Bill was the fourth child in the family, with two elder brothers and a sister.|$|E

5|$|The Frank Slide was a rockslide that buried {{part of the}} <b>mining</b> <b>town</b> of Frank, Northwest Territories, Canada at 4:10 am on April 29, 1903. Over 82 {{million tonnes}} (90 million tons) of {{limestone}} rock slid down Turtle Mountain within 100 seconds, obliterating {{the eastern edge of}} Frank, the Canadian Pacific Railway line and the coal mine. It was one of the largest landslides in Canadian history and remains the deadliest, as between 70 and 90 of the town's residents were killed, most of whom remain buried in the rubble. Multiple factors led to the slide: Turtle Mountain's formation left it {{in a constant state of}} instability. Coal mining operations may have weakened the mountain's internal structure, as did a wet winter and cold snap on the night of the disaster.|$|E
5|$|The {{report of}} the Commissioners was not binding, and the rivalry between {{supporters}} of the two routes intensified. An independent Glasgow, Dumfries and Carlisle Railway was proposed, to build from Carlisle to meet the GPK, and the GPK itself proposed several branches, mostly for tactical reasons, to weaken or exclude the Caledonian Railway (CR), as the dominant supporter of the Annandale route. Of these only an extension from Kilmarnock to Horsecleugh, south of the <b>mining</b> <b>town</b> of Old Cumnock was authorised, by Act of 21 July 1845. The CR case was strengthened by its intended branch to Edinburgh; moreover locomotive designs were being improved, {{and the capacity to}} haul trains over the steep gradients of the Annandale route was diminishing in importance. In Parliamentary hearings in 1845, the Caledonian Railway passed the Commons and despite the GPK fighting on in the Lords, the Caledonian Railway was authorised, in preference to the Nithsdale route, on 31 July 1845.|$|E
5|$|As a result, {{the force}} {{was called in}} to manage {{industrial}} disputes on a range of occasions between 1887 and 1906. In the <b>mining</b> <b>town</b> of Lethbridge, for example, the Alberta Railway and Coal Company locked out its workforce in 1894 during an attempt to cut staff and reduce wages; a team of ten police was deployed to maintain order, in particular any risks posed by eastern European immigrants, and to mediate in the dispute. Police deployed there again in 1906 for nine months during a dispute between the company, now called the Alberta Railway and Irrigation Company, and the workforce over union recognition, pay and working conditions. A team of 82 regular police were reinforced by 11 special constables recruited from within the company, with an undercover constable deployed to infiltrate the strike and send back intelligence. Efforts were made to collect information on the earnings of the union leaders, probably intended for use in discrediting them. The police maintained order and escorted non-striking workers past the picket lines.|$|E
