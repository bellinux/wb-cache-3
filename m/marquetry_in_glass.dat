50|$|The classic {{illustrated}} {{description of}} 18th century marquetry-making was contributed by Roubo to the Encyclopédie des Arts et Métiers, 1770. The most thorough and dependable 20th-century accounts of <b>marquetry,</b> <b>in</b> {{the context of}} Parisian cabinet-making, are by Pierre Verlet.|$|R

50|$|Some of the cabinetmaking and <b>marquetry</b> <b>in</b> the Collections {{come from}} the Eger {{craftsmen}} who worked in Western Bohemia in the 17th century. Several Eger jewelry cabinets are considered among the finest ever produced. Other pieces include caskets, tables and games boards, which are lavishly inlaid with ivory, mother-of-pearl and tortoiseshell, depicting landscapes, animals and classical motifs.|$|R

The statue of Sant'Urio, the angels and the saints Thomas and Thaddeus are by Bernardo Falcone. The work of <b>marquetry</b> <b>in</b> polychromatic stones is by Corbarelli.|$|R
50|$|The Egyptian {{connections}} to Robert Stephenson were very considerable and {{a wealth of}} consequential artefacts are in Cairo Railway Museum. This includes what could well be the single most extravagant piece built by the Robert Stephenson Works. This is works number 1295 of 1862 whose artistic design was by Matthew Digby Wyatt.

The altarpiece is erected in green marble from Africa and Carrara white. The painting is an oil on canvas by Sebastiano Ricci representing Pope Gregory I who invokes the Virgin {{for the end of the}} plague in Rome at the beginning of the 18th century. Ricci's work replaced an initial painting by Carlo Cignani who [...] "went wrong." ...|$|R
50|$|Form follows {{function}} in that Taylor employs <b>marquetry</b> <b>in</b> {{the service of}} content. She subverts inlay's decorative status by constructing narratives that are neither decorative, nor memorial, nor facile, but rather freezing the abject, mundane and ordinary <b>in</b> time. <b>Marquetry</b> was first popularized under Louis XIV in the 17th century in the unprecedented luxury of Versailles. By portraying these subjects in a technique associated with opulence and privilege, the artist pays respect to the subject and challenges the expectations and connotations associated with the material.|$|R
5000|$|The chapel built {{during the}} first half of the 17th century was {{originally}} used for the Blessed Sacrament, which was transferred to one of the apsidal chapels. The present aspect dates from 1675 with the sanctuary for the relics of Saints Innocents (the remains of three victims of Herod). [...] "The disarray of Santa Rachel" [...] is by Giovanni Comin (1690); The two saints: James the Minor and John are attributed to Michele Fabris. The work of <b>marquetry</b> <b>in</b> polychrome stone is by Corbarelli.|$|R
5000|$|Patrice Lejeune again uses a {{technique}} he calls [...] "sprinkling": using waste - sawdust, shavings, scrapings etc. - as pigments {{to create a}} range of effects. Arguably {{this is no longer}} <b>marquetry</b> <b>in</b> the pure sense, since it spills over into textured painting, even collage to some extent. This technique also was invented by Georges Vriz, who employed it on a series of large panels exhibited in Paris at the arency. It has been used mainly in France by professionals and students of the École de la Bonne Graine in 1996.|$|R
50|$|Like Shudi, Kirkman built {{three models}} of harpsichord: single manual {{instruments}} with disposition 8' 8' or 8' 8' 4' and double manual instruments with disposition 8' 8' 4' and lute stop. The inner construction of Kirkman harpsichords {{was based on}} the Ruckers-type 17th-century Flemish harpsichord, though a distinctive outward appearance had been developed by English makers by the 1720s, featuring veneering inside and outside, detailed inlay and <b>marquetry</b> <b>in</b> the keywell. Key dip was stopped at the by a rail at the far end, which has led to English harpsichords having a reputation for the worst touch of any school of harpsichord building.|$|R
50|$|The École Boulle {{was founded}} in 1886 and is named after the cabinetmaker André-Charles Boulle, who is {{generally}} considered to be the preeminent artist in the field of <b>marquetry</b> <b>in</b> the century of Louis XIV. The school trains students from the Applied Arts « Baccalauréat » (French national secondary-school diploma required to pursue university studies for 18-year-old students) to the « DSAA » (4-year degree in applied arts after the « Baccalauréat », equivalent to a master's degree). There are three different DSAA (« Diplôme Supérieur d'Arts Appliqués »), relating to three different departments: Spatial Design, Communication Design and Product Design.|$|R

50|$|The son of {{a certain}} Walter Latz, Jean-Pierre was born near Cologne, where he must have {{received}} his training, for when he settled in Paris in 1719, where he was received into the cabinetmakers' guild, he was aged twenty-six. He always retained a certain German weightiness to his designs. When the practice of stamping the carcasses of furniture was introduced in Paris, Latz was already in full career. Nevertheless, his style is individual enough that a range of unstamped case furniture, writing tables and especially clock cases, his specialty, with close stylistic connections to stamped pieces, {{can be attributed to}} his workshop. In some cases, carcases by Latz were veneered with <b>marquetry</b> <b>in</b> the shop of Jean-François Oeben, or, possibly, by Roger Vandercruse Lacroix.|$|R
50|$|Suites on {{the first}} floor (101, 102 and 103) have been {{restored}} to reflect classical French and Italian Styles. Suite 101 has a French Neoclassical style, but with contemporary accents. Its decor features woven and printed silks, lacquered wood, and fine marbles. The bedroom has a Louis XV and Louis XVI style. The dining room presents a more eclectical French style of the 20th Century. This room contains an armoire with Boulle <b>marquetry,</b> <b>in</b> a Napoleon III style. The living room contains two small cupboards in Chinese lacquer with Coromandel panels. All of these pieces were made in Paris during the 19th Century. An exact replica of Louis XVI's library has been made for the living room. This room also contains a Louis XV desk.|$|R
5000|$|The 'Pleasure Wherry' {{evolved as}} {{railways}} {{took on the}} cargo business that had supported the traders. Enterprising owners realised that conversion to carry passengers {{was a way to}} replace the lost income, especially as the Broads were at the same time being discovered as a destination for tourism and recreation. Early examples simply featured hammocks and a stove in the hold of a trader, but boatbuilders soon began to make craft specifically for pleasure sailing and holidays, using the same hull and rig design but incorporating living quarters instead of a cargo hold. Some were fitted out to a very high standard indeed; for example, Hathor, built for the Colman family (of mustard fame), features highly detailed <b>marquetry</b> <b>in</b> Egyptian designs below decks.|$|R

5000|$|The ceiling for the Tapestry Room at Croome was {{designed}} by Robert Adam. Ince and Mayhew provided furniture {{for a number of}} Adam's other patrons: Sir John Whitwell at Audley End (1767), the Duchess of Northumberland (from 1771) the Earl of Kerry (from 1771). [...] In 1775 they constructed, to Adam's numerous and detailed designs, the celebrated Kimbolton Cabinet inlaid with Florentine pietra dura plaques for the Duchess of Manchester (now at the Victoria and Albert Museum); Boulton and Fothergill supplied the gilt-bronze mounts. For Lady Derby's Dressing Room at Derby House, London, they executed a demilune commode to Adam's design of October 1774, delivered in November 1775; it combined strongly contrasting richly engraved satinwood and harewood <b>marquetry</b> <b>in</b> an [...] "Etruscan" [...] taste with painted panels and gilt-bronze mounts; discovery of the commode enabled Hugh Roberts tentatively to identify a series of comparable demilune and serpentine-fronted marquetry commodes to the firm. Furnishings were also provided for the Duchess of Devonshire's private apartment at Chatsworth.|$|R
5000|$|Marquetry was not ordinarily {{a feature}} of {{furniture}} made outside large urban centers. Nevertheless, marquetry was introduced into London furniture at the Restoration of Charles II in 1660, the product of immigrant Dutch 'inlayers', whose craft traditions owed a lot to Antwerp. Panels of elaborately scrolling [...] "seaweed" [...] marquetry of box or holly contrasting with walnut appeared on table tops, cabinets, and long-case clocks. At {{the end of the}} 17th century, a new influx of French Huguenot craftsmen went to London, but <b>marquetry</b> <b>in</b> England had little appeal in the anti-French, more Chinese-inspired high-style English furniture (mis-called 'Queen Anne') after ca 1720. Marquetry was revived as a vehicle of Neoclassicism and a 'French taste' in London furniture, starting in the late 1760s. Cabinet-makers associated with London-made marquetry furniture, 1765-1790, include Thomas Chippendale and less familiar names, like John Linnell, the French craftsman Pierre Langlois, and the firm of William Ince and John Mayhew.|$|R

40|$|Progressive {{decreases}} in the Si‐O‐Si angles between corner‐shared silicate tetrahedra <b>in</b> <b>glasses</b> and melts with increasing pressure {{can lead to}} arrangements of oxygen atoms that {{can be described in}} terms of edge‐ or face‐shared octahedra. This mechanism of compression can account for the gradual, continuous increases <b>in</b> melt and <b>glass</b> densities from values at low pressure that indicate dominantly tetrahedral coordination of Si to values at several tens of GPa that suggest higher coordination. It also can explain the unquenchable nature of octahedrally coordinated Si <b>in</b> <b>glasses,</b> the absence of spectroscopically detectable octahedrally coordinated Si <b>in</b> <b>glasses</b> until they are highly compressed, the gradual and reversible transformation from tetrahedral to octahedral coordination <b>in</b> <b>glasses</b> once the transformation is detectable spectroscopically, and the fact that this transformation takes place <b>in</b> <b>glass</b> at room temperature. It may also have relevance to pressure‐induced transformations from crystalline to glassy phases, the difficulty in retrieving some metastable high pressure crystalline phases at low pressure, and the observed differences between the pressures required for phase transformations in shock wave experiments on glasses and crystals...|$|R
