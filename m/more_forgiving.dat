5|$|The game began {{development}} in 2010, carrying {{over a large}} portion of the work done on Valkyria Chronicles II. While it retained the standard features of the series, it also underwent multiple adjustments, such as making the game <b>more</b> <b>forgiving</b> for series newcomers. Character designer Raita Honjou and composer Hitoshi Sakimoto both returned from previous entries, along with Valkyria Chronicles II director Takeshi Ozawa. A large team of writers handled the script. The game's opening theme was sung by May'n.|$|E
5|$|Paris–Roubaix {{presents}} a technical challenge to riders, team personnel, and equipment. Special frames and wheels are often used. In the past, developments {{to cope with}} the demands of Paris–Roubaix have included the use of wider tires, cantilever brakes, and dual brake levers. More recently, manufacturers such as Specialized have developed new types of bike which are designed {{to cope with the}} demands on the cobbled classics: the best known being the Specialized Roubaix series, which has a longer wheelbase and is designed to offer the rider a <b>more</b> <b>forgiving</b> ride. Many teams disperse personnel along the course with spare wheels, equipment and bicycles to help in locations not accessible to the team car.|$|E
5|$|There {{are fewer}} records of {{elephants}} {{being used as}} straightforward executioners for the civil population. One such example is mentioned by Josephus and the deuterocanonical book of 3 Maccabees {{in connection with the}} Egyptian Jews, though the story is likely apocryphal. 3 Maccabees describes an attempt by Ptolemy IV Philopator (ruled 221–204 BC) to enslave and brand Egypt's Jews with the symbol of Dionysus. When the majority of the Jews resisted, the king is said to have rounded them up and ordered them to be trampled on by elephants. The mass execution was ultimately thwarted, supposedly by the intervention of angels, following which Ptolemy took an altogether <b>more</b> <b>forgiving</b> attitude towards his Jewish subjects.|$|E
25|$|Forgiveness {{may also}} lead to better {{perceived}} physical health. This correlation applies to both self-forgiveness and other-forgiveness but {{is especially true of}} self-forgiveness. Individuals who are <b>more</b> capable of <b>forgiving</b> themselves have better perceived physical health.|$|R
6000|$|But James felt in <b>more</b> of a <b>forgiving</b> mood than Henry. He did {{not like}} quarrelling, and he knew very well that peace-makers must be {{prepared}} to yield and forbear, even if they had not been themselves in the wrong. So he said, ...|$|R
2500|$|Lines 7 and 8 are {{sometimes}} {{seen as a}} crux, and are universally recognized as ambiguous. Knights notes the potential doubleness of line 7, either [...] "I corrupt myself by excusing you" [...] or [...] "I myself corrupt you <b>more</b> by <b>forgiving</b> you." [...] George Steevens glosses 8: [...] "Making the excuse more than proportioned to the offence", while Bullen has it [...] "Making this excuse: Their sins are more than thine." [...] Both Bullen and Steevens amended the quarto's [...] "their" [...] to [...] "thy," [...] as is now standard practice.|$|R
5|$|Injuries had {{devastated the}} Maryland roster the {{previous}} year, and while 2008 was <b>more</b> <b>forgiving</b> by comparison, several key players were injured. Starting cornerback Kevin Barnes suffered a season-ending scapular fracture against Wake Forest {{and missed the}} last six games. Sophomore LaQuan Williams and true freshman Kevin Dorsey, both wide receivers, sat out the entire season due to leg and foot injuries, respectively. Leading receiver Darrius Heyward-Bey sat out the Boston College game due to a calf injury, and leading rusher Da'Rel Scott suffered a left shoulder injury in the third game against California, which plagued him throughout the season, although he missed just one game. Running back Morgan Green, who had contended for the starting position during summer camp, had an injury-riddled season, before seeing his first real action in the bowl game. Starting quarterback Jordan Steffy was put {{out for the season}} by a thumb injury on his throwing hand in the first game.|$|E
5|$|Devil Summoner was {{the first}} Megami Tensei title to be {{released}} on a 32-bit fifth-generation home video game console, and the first Megami Tensei game to feature 3D graphics. The latter presented a new challenge for the development team: while they found adjusting to the new specifications a challenge, they also greatly enjoyed working with the Sega Saturn, the which was unlike anything previously experienced by the team. Among the design staff were Katsura Hashino, who focused on combat, and Shogo Isogai, who focused on coordination between gameplay events. The demon conversation system was conceived by Okada based on experiences with the multiple accents encountered in the Kansai region of Japan. Using this as a base, he created the response system to give demon negotiation a more realistic feeling than previous Megami Tensei games. It was also a means of equalizing the relationship between demons and the player party, which had previously been more akin to master and servant than equal partners. The Zoma demons, which could be freely tailored into different demon types, was created while the team was balancing out the game's difficulty. The gameplay difficulty, which by later standards would be considered quite high, was toned down from the difficulty of earlier Megami Tensei titles {{to appeal to a}} wider audience. This necessitated balancing a <b>more</b> <b>forgiving</b> difficulty with keeping traditional Megami Tensei gameplay elements.|$|E
5|$|The {{gameplay}} {{was inspired}} by the multi-character system of Before Crisis, while the naming of magic styles after weapons of war made reference to first-person shooters. The combat was designed to be filled with tension and portray each playable character's personality on the battlefield. The Eidolons were originally not controlled in realtime, but during the development of Ifrit, Tabata did some testing with real-time commands. The results impressed him enough that he decided to overcome the technical difficulties involved and make the Eidolons controllable. Due to technical restrictions and the presence of the Academy Assist function, the game's artificial intelligence for playable characters needed to be limited to healing, survival and other minor actions. The game's multiplayer was deliberately designed around restricted segments. Its development was still ongoing during the summer of 2011, with a temporary stoppage of PlayStation Network that year negatively affecting its development. Because {{of the size of the}} project, debugging the game took far longer than anticipated. Between the release of the demo and the full game, adjustments were made to gameplay mechanics and the in-game camera. In a post-release interview, Tabata commented that he would have liked to expand the multiplayer functions to include an ad-hoc function and expanded cooperative gameplay, and create a <b>more</b> <b>forgiving</b> learning curve for players.|$|E
5000|$|As {{the early}} Christian Church began to {{distinguish}} itself from Judaism, the [...] "Old Testament" [...] and a portrayal of God {{in it as}} violent and unforgiving were sometimes contrasted rhetorically with certain teachings of Jesus to portray an image of God as <b>more</b> loving and <b>forgiving,</b> which was framed as a new image.|$|R
60|$|Biddy said no <b>more.</b> Handsomely <b>forgiving</b> her, I soon {{exchanged}} {{an affectionate}} good night {{with her and}} Joe, {{and went up to}} bed. When I got into my little room, I sat down and took a long look at it, as a mean little room that I should soon be parted from and raised above, for ever. It was furnished with fresh young remembrances too, and even at the same moment I fell into much the same confused division of mind between it and the better rooms to which I was going, as I had been in so often between the forge and Miss Havisham's, and Biddy and Estella.|$|R

5|$|What makes Yoshi's Island DS {{different}} is {{the addition of}} five babies for Yoshi to carry, each bestowing a different ability — Baby Mario allows Yoshi to dash and makes special 'M' blocks appear, and can grab Super Stars to become Super Baby Mario, and grants ricocheting eggs; Baby Peach allows Yoshi to float and fly on wind currents and grants a <b>more</b> <b>forgiving</b> timing to use Yoshi's flutter jumping abilities effectively; Baby Donkey Kong can grab and swing on vines and ropes, grants a special dash attack, allows Yoshi's eggs to explode as per Yoshi's Story (but they do so on impact) and allows Yoshi to push objects faster; Baby Wario uses his magnet to attract metal objects and allows Yoshi's eggs to bounce; and Baby Bowser spits fireballs, but the Yoshi carrying him cannot make eggs, though the eggs Yoshi already carries can bounce. The last three babies tend to make the timing for Yoshi's flutter jumping less forgiving and slow down his movement a little bit. The need to switch babies at key points adds a puzzle element to the game.|$|E
25|$|Additionally, {{self-esteem}} {{has been}} found to be related to forgiveness in close relationships, in that people with high self-esteem will be <b>more</b> <b>forgiving</b> than people with low self-esteem.|$|E
25|$|Survey {{data from}} 2000 showed that 61% of {{participants}} {{that were part}} of a small religious group reported that the group helped them be <b>more</b> <b>forgiving.</b> Individuals reported that their religion groups which promote forgiveness was related to self-reports of success in overcoming addictions, guilt, and perceiving encouragement when feeling discouraged.|$|E

5000|$|In {{a similar}} vein, asset-numbering labels on {{corporate}} equipment (PCs and the like) are often designed to leave an imprint {{of either the}} serial number, or the word [...] "VOID" [...] if the label is peeled off. However, this can easily be defeated by warming up the label using a blow dryer {{so it will be}} <b>more</b> flexible and <b>forgiving</b> to removal (and reapplication).|$|R
60|$|Kenneth Forbes {{had always}} been an unusual boy. He {{had grown up in}} an unfriendly atmosphere, unloved and uncared for, and resented this neglect with all the force of his impetuous nature. He had hated Aunt Jane, and {{regarded}} her as cruel and selfish--a fair estimate of her character--until Aunt Jane's nieces taught him to be <b>more</b> considerate and <b>forgiving.</b> Patricia, especially, had exercised a gentler influence upon the arbitrary youth, and as a consequence they had become staunch friends.|$|R
25|$|Until recently, Unicode {{compliant}} fonts {{have been}} more difficult to type than Zawgyi, as they have a stricter, less forgiving and arguably less intuitive method for ordering diacritics. However, intelligent input software such as Keymagic and recent versions of smartphone soft-keyboards including Gboard and ttKeyboard allow for <b>more</b> <b>forgiving</b> input sequences and Zawgyi keyboard layouts which produce Unicode-compliant text.|$|E
25|$|In three {{separate}} studies, including one with Catholics and Protestants from Northern Ireland whose {{family members were}} murdered in the political violence, he {{found that people who}} are taught how to forgive become less angry, feel less hurt, are more optimistic, become <b>more</b> <b>forgiving</b> in a variety of situations, and become more compassionate and self-confident. His studies show a reduction in experience of stress, physical manifestations of stress, and an increase in vitality.|$|E
25|$|Studies {{show that}} people who forgive are happier and {{healthier}} than those who hold resentments. The first study {{to look at how}} forgiveness improves physical health discovered that when people think about forgiving an offender it leads to improved functioning in their cardiovascular and nervous systems. Another study at the University of Wisconsin found the <b>more</b> <b>forgiving</b> people were, the less they suffered {{from a wide range of}} illnesses. The less forgiving people reported a greater number of health problems.|$|E
5000|$|In 2004, essayist Phillip Lopate {{wrote that}} Scenes from a Marriage showed Bergman moving on from {{exploration}} of the silence of God {{to the subject of}} men, women, love and intimacy. Lopate found the film version [...] "more harrowing and theatrical," [...] while the miniseries [...] "has the tendency to intersect with and form a more quotidian relationship to viewers’ lives; its characters become members of the family, and their resilience over time, regardless of the incessant crises thrown them by the script, induces a <b>more</b> good-humored, <b>forgiving</b> atmosphere." [...] In 2007, Kristi McKim of Senses of Cinema wrote that the film [...] "stunningly exemplified" [...] the [...] "tension" [...] in [...] "the emotional causes and effects of feeling incompatible desires within the modern world." [...] The film has a 94% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 15 reviews.|$|R
50|$|Banishment {{or forced}} exile from a polity or {{society has been}} used as a {{punishment}} since at least Ancient Roman times. It removed the offender from society, possibly permanently, but was seen as a <b>more</b> merciful or <b>forgiving</b> punishment than execution. From the earliest days of English colonial schemes, new settlements beyond the seas were seen as a way to alleviate domestic social problems of criminals and the poor, as well as to increase the colonial labour force, production and overall benefit of the realm.|$|R
50|$|Forgiveness {{may also}} be {{correlated}} with physical health because hostility is associated with poor coronary performance. Unforgiveness is {{as an act of}} hostility, and forgiveness as an act of letting go of hostility. Heart patients who are treated with therapy that includes forgiveness to reduce hostility have improved cardiac health compared to those who are treated with medicine alone. Forgiveness may also lead to better perceived physical health. This correlation applies to both self-forgiveness and other-forgiveness but is especially true of self-forgiveness. Individuals who are <b>more</b> capable of <b>forgiving</b> themselves have better perceived physical health.|$|R
25|$|Including {{the lower}} bending stiffness, {{composite}} baseball bats {{have a higher}} damping rate. The damping rate corresponds to how quickly the material lessens the vibrations it is experiencing. Russell also states that composite bats have a damping rate anywhere from 2 to 10 times more than standard aluminum bat. Many ball players therefore refer to composite bats as <b>more</b> <b>forgiving</b> because {{if they do not}} make contact with the ball on the sweet spot, they will not feel the vibrations (sting) from the missed hit.|$|E
25|$|Suárez {{moved with}} his family to Montevideo when he was seven, and his parents {{separated}} when he was nine. In Montevideo, Suárez developed his football skills on the streets, while also taking up work as a street sweeper. The contrast between his life in Europe and the poverty he left behind has been cited as contributing to his periodic aggression on the field, as well as being a possible explanation for the <b>more</b> <b>forgiving</b> attitudes of the Uruguayan public and press towards such cases, compared to Europe.|$|E
25|$|This {{extra traffic}} on the Boston and Lowell Railroad, {{especially}} with the line still over granite, provided the extra impetus to double track and upgrade. In 1838, the B began two years of extensive track improvements, first laying a second track on wood, and with that one built, going back and re-laying the old track on the <b>more</b> <b>forgiving</b> wood as well. Boston and Lowell traffic continued to increase, and even with double tracks the schedule became tight enough that the Boston and Maine trains, as renters, began to be pushed around to annoying hours, often having to wait over an hour in Wilmington before being allowed to proceed on to Boston.|$|E
500|$|Richard Eder praised Any Human Heart in the New York Times: [...] "William Boyd, is {{multifaceted}} and inventive, and {{he plays}} a deep game under his agile card tricks." [...] Christopher Tayler, in the London Review of Books, called the characterisation of Mountstuart weak and {{wondered if he was}} merely a device through which Boyd could write pastiche about 20th-century writers, [...] "Boyd hustles you through to the end despite all this, but it’s hard not to wonder if it was really worth making the journey." [...] In The Atlantic Monthly, Brooke Allen liked the Mountstuart character: [...] "he is far <b>more</b> generous, <b>forgiving,</b> and free than most of us. He is also more amusing, and more amused by life", thus making an [...] "attractive central character" [...] and Boyd's writing showed [...] "a great natural vitality and an increasingly sophisticated humanism." [...] The Atlantic Monthly selected it as one of the [...] "books of the year".|$|R
40|$|The paper {{presents}} a specific {{analysis of the}} demographic aspects of forgiving among the until recently belligerent ethnic groups in war-effected areas of Western and Eastern Slavonia. It {{is based on an}} empirical survey, conducted {{towards the end of the}} year 2004. It examines the degree to which forgiving the enemy side is linked to the demographic traits of the population. Four demographic variables were applied. The empirical survey examined numerous indirect and direct variations of forgiving, and this paper treats the questions of who is to be forgiven, why should one forgive and it also attempts to determine what is the present level of forgiving. Unfortunately, in his scientific experience the author came across very few similar studies, and therefore it is difficult to make exact comparisons in regard to the progress of the process of forgiving and reconciliation. The paper tests six hypotheses. The analysis shows that the population of Western Slavonia is more ready to forgive than the population of Eastern Slavonia, that women are more ready to forgive than men, that older persons are <b>more</b> inclined to <b>forgiving</b> than younger ones, that the Serb population is <b>more</b> inclined towards <b>forgiving,</b> that the level of forgiving is not in direct correlation with the level of education and, partially, that the indigenous population was more ready to forgive than immigrants...|$|R

25|$|Lawson and Wooliscroft (2004) {{drew the}} link between human nature and the {{marketing}} concept, not explicitly biology, where they considered the contrasting views of Hobbes and Rousseau on mankind. Hobbes believed man had a self-serving nature whereas Rousseau was <b>more</b> <b>forgiving</b> towards the nature of man, suggesting them to be noble and dignified. Hobbes saw {{the need for a}} governing intermediary to control this selfish nature which provided a basis for the exchange theory, and also links to Mcgregor’s Theory of X and Y, relevant to management literature. He also considered cooperation and competition, relevant to game theory as an explanation of man’s motives and can be used for understanding the exercising of power in marketing channels. Pinker outlines why the nature debate has been suppressed by the nurture debate in his book The Blank Slate.|$|E
25|$|In the Second Test Ray Illingworth {{was put in}} to bat, but Rowan refused {{his request}} for the roller to be used on the wicket before play began. Rowan later {{realised}} his mistake and apologised in the lunch break. Even John Snow applauded when he and Tom Brooks refused to start play at Melbourne in the abandoned Third Test. Ian Johnson and the Melbourne authorities were desperate to get the game going, but the umpires refused to be pressured as the field was quite unfit for play. Snow found Max O'Connell 'a very reasonable and fair man, even if I {{did not agree with}} him' and that they could talk problems through. Brooks {{was the only one of}} the umpires who had played First Class Cricket – he had been a lively fast-medium bowler – and as a result was more able to connect with the Test players, and was <b>more</b> <b>forgiving</b> of short-pitched deliveries which he saw as a natural part of the game.|$|E
25|$|Regardless {{of the new}} {{government}} in Angola's overtures, Pedro II had not forgotten the invasion and planned to remove the Portuguese from the realm altogether. The king {{sent a letter to the}} Dutch Estates General proposing a joint military attack on Angola with a Kongo army and a Dutch fleet. He would pay the Dutch with gold, silver and ivory for their efforts. As planned, a Dutch fleet under the command of the celebrated admiral Piet Heyn arrive in Luanda to carry out its attack in 1624. The plan failed to come to fruition as, at that point, Pedro had died and his son Garcia Mvemba a Nkanga was elected king. King Garcia I was <b>more</b> <b>forgiving</b> of the Portuguese and had been successfully persuaded by their various gestures of conciliation. He was unwilling to press the attack on Angola at that time, contending that as a Catholic, he could not ally with non-Catholics to attack the city.|$|E
40|$|In a {{competitive}} market place where price is not a differentiator, customers are easily lost through indifferent services. Customers are becoming harder to please. They are smarter, more price conscious, <b>more</b> demanding, less <b>forgiving,</b> as they are approached by many more competitors with equal or better offers. Banks have realised that managing customer relationships {{is a very important}} factor for their success. Customer relationship management (CRM) is a strategy that can help them to build long-lasting relationships with their customers and increase their profits through the right management system and the application of customer-focused strategies.

5000|$|With this, Cotton became embattled {{with two}} {{different}} extremes. At one end were the Presbyterians who wanted more openness to church membership, while Williams {{thought that the}} church should completely separate from any church hierarchy and only allow membership to those who separated from the Anglican church. Cotton chose a middle ground between the two extremes. He felt that church members should [...] "hate what separates them from Christ, and not denounce those Christians {{who have not yet}} rejected all impure practices." [...] Cotton further felt that the policies of Williams were [...] "too demanding upon the Christian". In this regard, historian Everett Emerson suggests that [...] "Cotton's God is far <b>more</b> generous and <b>forgiving</b> than Williams's".|$|R
