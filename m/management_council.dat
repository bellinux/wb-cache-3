5|$|In 1994, {{the salmon}} catch {{was smaller than}} usual in the rivers of Oregon, Washington, and British Columbia, causing concern among {{commercial}} fishermen, government agencies, and tribal leaders. US government intervention, to which the states of Alaska, Idaho, and Oregon objected, included an 11-day closure of an Alaska fishery. In April 1994 the Pacific Fisheries <b>Management</b> <b>Council</b> unanimously approved the strictest regulations in 18years, banning all commercial salmon fishing for that year from Cape Falcon north to the Canada–US border. In the winter of 1994, the return of coho salmon far exceeded expectations, which was attributed {{in part to the}} fishing ban.|$|E
5|$|In the {{immediate}} aftermath of the storm and associated flooding, the Department of Agriculture readied for the distribution of 3million bangus fry, 250,000tilapia fry, and 315bags of rice seeds to affected regions. Furthermore, the National Food Authority allocated 200sacks of rice to Pangasinan. The National Disaster Risk Reduction and <b>Management</b> <b>Council</b> assisted in relief operations by allocating ₱10million (US$200,000) and 800bags of rice for such efforts. In addition, one of eight regional Filipino health offices distributed roughly ₱600,000 (US$10,000) worth of various medicines to Dagupan and Urdaneta, Pangasinan. According to the National Disaster Coordinating Council, ₱15.7million (US$300,000) worth in relief operations was allocated.|$|E
5|$|The United States manages common {{thresher}} fisheries via regulations such {{as commercial}} quotas and trip limits, and recreational minimum sizes and retention limits. Shark finning is illegal under U.S. federal law. The Atlantic common thresher fishery is {{regulated by the}} National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) Highly Migratory Species Management Division through the 2006 Consolidated Atlantic Highly Migratory Species (HMS) Fishery Management Plan (FMP), and the Pacific common thresher fishery is regulated by the Pacific Fishery <b>Management</b> <b>Council</b> through the Fishery Management Plan (FMP) for U.S. West Coast Fisheries for Highly Migratory Species (HMS). In the 1990s, after the depletion of common thresher stocks by the California gillnet fishery, the fleet was limited to 70 boats and restrictions were placed on season, operation range, and landings. There {{is evidence that the}} California subpopulation is recovering, and the potential population growth rate has been estimated to be 47% per year.|$|E

In 2014, the Parties to the Convention for the Protection and Development of the Marine Environment of the Wider Caribbean Region (Cartagena Convention) included queen conch in Annex III of its Protocol Concerning Specially Protected Areas and Wildlife (SPAW Protocol). Species included in the Annex III require special measures to be taken to ensure their protection and recovery, and their use is authorised and regulated accordingly.|$|E
5|$|The Pacific {{electric}} ray and its relatives {{are used as}} model organisms for biomedical research, because their electric organs contain an abundance of important nervous system proteins such as nicotinic acetylcholine receptor and acetylcholinesterase. In the 1970s and 1980s, acetylcholine receptors from this species and the marbled {{electric ray}} (T.marmorata) became the first neurotransmitter receptors to be isolated and sequenced, in what {{is considered to be}} a landmark success in the field of neurobiology. This led to a number of further advances, one of the most significant being the elucidation of the pathophysiology underlying the disease myasthenia gravis. A small commercial fishery in southern California supplies Pacific electric rays for research purposes; as of 2005 this fishery may have employed as few as two fishers. Otherwise, this ray has no economic value. It is caught incidentally by commercial trawl and gillnet fisheries, and on hook-and-line by sport anglers. These activities appear to have little impact on its population, leading it to be listed under Least Concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). Fishing for this ray is not managed by the Pacific Fishery <b>Management</b> <b>Council.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{flooding}} on Mangaia persisted {{for nearly}} a week before finally subsiding. Once the waters receded, {{the full extent of}} damage was revealed. Although only minor structural damage was sustained, the agricultural sector received extensive losses. Nearly 90% of the islands' staple crop was lost and about 60% of all the livestock perished. Following an assessment made by the Cook Islands National Disaster <b>Management</b> <b>Council,</b> it was determined that US$52,000 was needed to repair losses from Trina. International assistance from the United Nations was eventually requested on December12, allowing for relief funds from several agencies to be delivered to the area. Fears of food shortages also prompted the local government to begin stockpiling food should it become a necessary relief supply. A total of US$24,140 was committed in relief funds by New Zealand, Norway and the United Nations to assist the Cook Islands in recovering from the storm. By late-December, an additional F$20,000 (US$11,000) was distributed by the Pacific Islands Forum Secretariat to the affected islands. In the months following Cyclone Trina, debris removal and cleanup was relatively slow, delaying efforts to replant crops lost in the floods. Food shortage issues became apparent in February 2002, prompting the IFRC to distribute food to all of Mangaia's residents.|$|E

Without such action an imbalance could arise which would lead to their demise or subservience to federal authority and advice. ...|$|R

25|$|Ahead of {{the system}} {{impacting}} Vanuatu, the Vanuatu National Disaster <b>Management</b> <b>Council</b> issued various tropical cyclone alerts to warn residents about the approaching cyclone, which included a red alert for the Maewo, Pentecost and Ambae islands. Because of the upcoming cyclone the national radio station extended its programming to run throughout the night of January 5–6. Vanautu's domestic airline Vanair closed its airfields in the northern islands and cancelled all of its flights except for several direct flights between Santo Island and Port Vila {{the capital city of}} Vanuatu. All ships and small boats were advised to seek refuge due to the high seas and swells that were expected from Susan. However, during January 7, Susan moved south-eastwards and the Fijian islands and spared Vanuatu a direct hit. Despite being spared a direct hit, heavy rain and gale force winds caused minor damage to several Vanuatuan Islands, including on Ambrym Island, where a woman died after being hit by a falling coconut tree, while gathering supplies to secure her house with.

40|$|This essay {{analyzes}} {{the effectiveness of}} social participation on municipal <b>councils</b> in the <b>management</b> of public policies. The goal is to identify intersectorality in this field, because the reordering of socio-institutional relations after 1988 established countless challenges confronted in the routine activities of municipal <b>management</b> <b>councils</b> to process actions in this logic. The first section discusses some understandings and processes of intersectoral actions in the reality studied. An analysis is then made of the intersectoral and network action as local bases for protection and development. The paper concludes that intersectoriality, as a space for sharing knowledge and power and {{for the construction of}} new languages, practices and concepts, is currently not established or sufficiently experimented by municipal public-policy <b>management</b> <b>councils.</b> Intersectoriality is still a challenging process to be exercised, because it necessarily implies articulating the councils with various social levels...|$|R
