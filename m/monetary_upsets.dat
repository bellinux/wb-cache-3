The possible gains in terms of well-being associated with policy coordination are explored, {{in order to make a}} rational evaluation of the proposals calling for greater monetary coordination. An analysis is made of the problem of selecting the nominal anchor most suitable for serving as the basis for cooperative agreements, in an economy affected by real and <b>monetary</b> <b>upsets.</b> In view of the structural differences that exist among the economies that make up MERCOSUR, it is concluded that a flexible form of macroeconomic coordination is needed in the context of this regional bloc. Special attention is given, in the context of a centre-periphery monetary coordination model, to the problems of sustainability of an asymmetrical-type monetary coordination mechanism based on use of the exchange rate as a nominal anchor. A proposal is then set forth for a sustainable form of macroeconomic coordination under a flexible exchange agreement based on a system of ranges of fluctuation backed up by nominal convergence criteria, structural reforms designed to make markets more flexible, and possible moderate controls on capital movements. The study ends with some considerations on the design of a strategy providing for the gradual abandonment by Argentina of the quasi currency board mechanism, in order to permit macroeconomic coordination in MERCOSUR...|$|E
40|$|This paper aims to {{evaluate}} {{merits of the}} Austrian business cycle theory in explaining the 2001 - 2009 business cycle in the US economy. The theory postulates that a <b>monetary</b> shock <b>upsets</b> equilibrium {{in the market for}} loanable funds and adversely influences coordination mechanisms of the economy. The structure of relative prices is distorted and resources are misallocated as a result. The economy follows an unsustainable investment trajectory inconsistent with the amount of available resources and with the consumer preferences. When the inconsistencies are revealed, some of the investments are liquidated and costly correction follows. After providing exposition of the theory and description of the US economy in 2001 - 2009, the theory is confronted with the data. Although some deviations are conceded, mainly in development of the labor market, analysis presented in the paper supports the Austrian business cycle theory as a solid theoretical tool for explanation of the economic development throughout the examined period. The theory exhibits its main strengths in accounting for development of relative prices and linking them to conditions in the market for loanable funds...|$|R
