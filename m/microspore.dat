5|$|McClintock's {{cytogenetic}} research {{focused on}} developing ways to visualize and characterize maize chromosomes. This particular {{part of her}} work influenced a generation of students, as it was included in most textbooks. She also developed a technique using carmine staining to visualize maize chromosomes, and showed {{for the first time}} the morphology of the 10 maize chromosomes. This discovery was made because she observed cells from the <b>microspore</b> as opposed to the root tip. By studying the morphology of the chromosomes, McClintock was able to link specific chromosome groups of traits that were inherited together. Marcus Rhoades noted that McClintock's 1929 Genetics paper on the characterization of triploid maize chromosomes triggered scientific interest in maize cytogenetics, and attributed to her 10 of the 17 significant advances in the field that were made by Cornell scientists between 1929 and 1935.|$|E
25|$|As {{previously}} mentioned, the SI phenotype of {{the pollen}} {{is determined by}} the diploid genotype of the anther. In Brassica, the pollen coat, derived from the anther's tapetum tissue, carries the translation products of the two S alleles. These are small, cysteine-rich proteins. The male determinant is termed SCR or SP11, and is expressed in the anther tapetum {{as well as in the}} <b>microspore</b> and pollen (i.e. sporophytically). There are possibly up to 100 polymorphs of the S-haplotype in Brassica, and within these there is a dominance hierarchy.|$|E
25|$|Doubled haploids can be {{produced}} in vivo or in vitro. Haploid embryos are produced in vivo by parthenogenesis, pseudogamy, or chromosome elimination after wide crossing. The haploid embryo is rescued, cultured, and chromosome-doubling produces doubled haploids. The in vitro methods include gynogenesis (ovary and flower culture) and androgenesis (anther and <b>microspore</b> culture). Androgenesis is the preferred method. Another method of producing the haploids is wide crossing. In barley, haploids can {{be produced}} by wide crossing with the related species Hordeum bulbosum; fertilization is affected, but {{during the early stages}} of seed development the H. bulbosum chromosomes are eliminated leaving a haploid embryo. In tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum), wide crossing with Nicotiana africana is widely used. When N. africana is used to pollinate N. tabacum, 0.25 to 1.42 percent of the progeny survive and can readily be identified as either F1 hybrids or maternal haploids. Although these percentages appear small, the vast yield of tiny seeds and the early death of most seedlings provide significant numbers of viable hybrids and haploids in relatively small soil containers. This method of interspecific pollination serves as a practical way of producing seed-derived haploids of N. tabacum, either as an alternative method or complementary method to anther culture.|$|E

5000|$|Although {{it is not}} {{the usual}} route of a <b>microspore,</b> this process is the most {{effective}} way of yielding haploid and double haploid plants through the use of male sex hormones. Under certain stressors such as heat or starvation, plants select for <b>microspore</b> embryogenesis. It was found that over 250 different species of angiosperms responded this way. In the anther, after a <b>microspore</b> undergoes microsporogenesis, it can deviate towards embryogenesis and become star-like microspores.

50|$|When the {{microgametophyte}} {{is first}} formed inside the pollen grain {{four sets of}} fertile cells called sporogenous cells are apparent. These cells are surrounded by a wall of sterile cells called the tapetum, which supplies food to the cell and eventually becomes the cell wall for the pollen grain.

These <b>microspore</b> mother cells, also called microsporocytes, then undergo meiosis and become four <b>microspore</b> haploid cells.

40|$|Different {{aspects of}} {{androgenesis}} induction {{have been studied}} in detail, but {{little is known about}} the molecular mechanisms associated with this developmental switch. We have employed macroarrays containing 1421 expressed sequence tags covering the early stages of barley zygotic embryogenesis to compare the gene expression profiles of stress-induced androgenic <b>microspores</b> with those of uninucleate <b>microspores</b> as they progressed into binucleate stage during pollen development. Principal component analysis defined distinct sets of gene expression profiles that were associated with androgenesis induction and pollen development. During pollen development, uninucleate <b>microspores</b> were characterized by the expression of cell division-related genes and transcripts involved in lipid biosynthesis. Progress into binucleate stage resulted in the significant increase in the level of transcripts associated with starch biosynthesis and energy production. These transcripts were downregulated in androgenic <b>microspores.</b> These results indicate that stress blocks the expression of pollen-related genes. The induction of androgenesis by stress was marked by the upregulation of transcripts involved in sugar and starch hydrolysis, proteolysis, stress response, inhibition of programmed cell death, and signaling. Further expression analysis revealed that the induction of genes encoding alcohol dehydrogenase 3, metalloprotease FtsH, cysteine protease 1 precursor, phytepsin precursor (aspartic protease), and a 26 S proteasome regulatory subunit was associated with the androgenic potential of <b>microspores,</b> whereas the induction of transcripts involved in signaling and cytoprotection was associated with stress responses. Taken together, these expression profiles represent 'bio-markers' associated with the androgenic switch in <b>microspores,</b> providing a substantial contribution toward understanding the molecular events underlying stress-induced androgenesis.
