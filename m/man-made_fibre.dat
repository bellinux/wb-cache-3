25|$|In 1945 Courtaulds {{remained}} one of {{the four}} groups which dominated the <b>man-made</b> <b>fibre</b> industry in Europe (counting the German VGF and the Dutch AKU as one group, and including also the CTA—later merged into Rhone-Poulenc~-in France, and Snia Viscose in Italy). Courtaulds activities in continental Europe consisted in a wholly owned, one-factory viscose fibre business employing some 3,000 people in France, a 50% share in a similar business in Germany (of which the other 50% was owned by VGF, the major competitor), and a minority shareholding which controlled 20% of the voting capital in the Italian firm Snia Viscosa, also primarily a viscose fibre producer. This activity expanded until the 1960s, when these products were replaced by newer developments.|$|E

2500|$|Wishing {{to reduce}} their {{dependence}} on natural silk, [...] in 1904, Courtaulds acquired the Cross and Bevan patents to the viscose process for manufacturing artificial silk or rayon from dissolving pulp. [...] They set up the first factory to produce it in Coventry UK in 1905. [...] The early yarns were first woven into fabrics at the Halstead Mill in Essex in March 1906, but the process remained troublesome until further inventions improved yarn strength.

2500|$|Although {{prices were}} stable, {{the company had}} a {{potential}} revenue generator in Tencel, a <b>man-made</b> <b>fibre</b> Courtaulds had spent £100 million and 10 years bringing to market. Like viscose, Tencel is made from cellulose derived from dissolved wood pulp. While rayon production generates large amounts of sulfurous waste, Tencel is made with a [...] "closed loop" [...] chemical {{process in which the}} solvent can be filtered and reused. The final product is far stronger than rayon or cotton, which allows a huge variety of different forms and feels - from ultrasoft yet strong denim jeans, to shirts that feel like silk, to scarves that ape the texture of cashmere.|$|E

5000|$|Later, Edwin Beer became disgruntled {{by what he}} {{perceived}} as all the [...] "incorrect histories" [...] of the <b>man-made</b> <b>fibre</b> industries, and in 1962 {{he and his wife}} Phoebe published [...] "The Beginning of Rayon". This book evokes a world where the practice of science was not yet a respectable profession.

50|$|There are {{two main}} {{categories}} of fibres used: natural fibre and <b>man-made</b> <b>fibre</b> (synthetics or petroleum based).Some natural fibres are linen, the first used historically, hemp, cotton, the most used, ramie, wool, silk and more recently bamboo or soya. Some synthetic fibres are polyester, tencel, viscose, etc. Polyester mixed with cotton (poly-cotton) is often used. Fabrics for shirts are called shirtings. The four main weaves for shirtings are plain weave, oxford, twill and satin. Broadcloth, poplin and end-on-end are variations of the plain weave. After weaving, finishing {{can be applied to}} the fabric.|$|E

Evidence {{from a wide range}} of documentary sources used to understand their technology and cultural significance is evaluated and the issue of lacking corroborative data derived from artefacts is discussed.

50|$|In 1958/59 {{four-year}} degree programmes in Textile Technology & Textile Chemistry were started. Initially {{the institute}} was affiliated to Agra University.

In 1985 the three-year diploma programmes were shifted to Government Polytechnic Kanpur and thereafter the institute has been running graduate and postgraduate programmes with Ph.D. research facilities.

50|$|The {{three main}} types of fibres are natural {{vegetable}} fibres, animal protein fibres and artificial fibres. Natural vegetable fibres include cotton, linen, jute and hemp.

5000|$|The {{reason for}} the {{preference}} of polyester in a game situation is twofold: firstly, polyester is harder {{to get hold of}} in a tackle situation, as it is inherently more 'slippery' than cotton or a cotton-blend. In addition, the increasing use of skin tight shirts further enhances this effect, as there is no loose material for a tackler to get a grip of.The other benefit of <b>man-made</b> <b>fibre</b> over cotton is that it absorbs less water and mud. As rugby is a sport played mainly in winter and/or bad weather, a cotton rugby kit can weigh around 6 to 8 lb when wet. This extra weight has to be carried by the player, in addition to running in wet, heavy ground.|$|E
50|$|Since it {{is known}} for {{producing}} textiles, including silk, Surat {{is known as the}} textile hub of the nation or the Silk City of India. It is very famous for its cotton mills and Surat Zari Craft. Surat is the biggest centre of MMF (<b>man-made</b> <b>fibre)</b> in India. It has a total of 381 dyeing and printing mills and 41,100 powerloom units. There are over a hundred thousand units and mills in total. The overall annual turnover is around 5 billion rupees. There are over 800 cloth wholesalers in Surat. It is the largest manufacturer of clothes in India, and Surti dress material can be found in any state of India. Surat produces 9 million metres of fabric annually, which accounts for 60% of the total polyester cloth production in India. Now the city is focusing on increasing the exports of its textile.|$|E
