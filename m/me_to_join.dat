I didn't want to go back on my word to my wife that I'd retired from front-line politics. How would it all work? Was No 10 suitable for someone in a wheelchair? All these things go through one's mind. Then if Michael had won...he would have had to ask <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>join</b> his government, and I didn't want that. I asked myself: why am I risking all this? And I made my decision...I might have been an absolute disaster in the job. It's possible. So I am left there. You can't rewrite it. You can't rerun it.|$|E
500|$|In 1986, while Ars Amatoria was touring Bucharest with an {{adaptation}} of Ion Luca Caragiale's plays, Pascu met and befriended members of the comedic ensemble and student group Divertis, which performed subtle political satire against Nicolae Ceauşescu's communist rule. [...] Pascu had been a Divertis fan since 1982 and recalled, [...] "I met with the Divertis boys after a show. They liked me [...] asked <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>join</b> the group". His first performance with Divertis took place in 1987, at Izvoru Mureşului resort in Harghita County. Pascu resumed his musical career, and also in 1987, was invited by Partoş to sing at a summer festival in Deva.|$|E
500|$|From the outset, Dallas was {{centered}} around {{the lives of the}} wealthy Ewing family who lived in Dallas, Texas. Once the show became a success after the initial run as a five-episode miniseries, the producers decided to expand the roles of certain characters. They introduced the parents of [...] Lucy Ewing (Charlene Tilton), who had not been shown on-screen until that point. Actress Joan Van Ark was contacted by series creator David Jacobs about joining the show. Her husband, John Marshall, convinced her to take the opportunity. In an interview for an episode of Celebrity Weddings, Van Ark said: [...] "At the time Dallas came up, I was doing two different jobs. They offered <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>join</b> Dallas, which would be shot in Dallas, Texas at Southfork. I read the script and it was buzzed about already...they were saying this was the hot new show. I said to myself, 'How can I be in Los Angeles doing this, down in Dallas, and then back in New York doing two days worth of Estée Lauder commercials?' He (my husband) read it and said, 'You've got to. It's a wonderful part. So, my husband talked me into a role that would become a fifteen-year chapter in my life." ...|$|E

2500|$|Robertson {{replaced}} [...] "Fast" [...] Eddie Clarke as {{the lead}} guitarist of Motörhead in May 1982. He recorded the band's 1983 King Biscuit Flower Hour sessions andAnother Perfect Day, his only studio album with the group. [...] "That felt totally uncertain," [...] he told Classic Rock. [...] "It only came about because I was helping out some friends and, when they asked <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>join</b> officially, I said, 'Okay, but I'm not fucking rewriting the Ace of Spades." [...] His last appearance with Motörhead was at the Metropol in Berlin, on 11 November 1983. His resistance to playing [...] "classic" [...] Motörhead songs, coupled with a playing style that did not fit well with Motörhead's aggressive music, resulted in his departure. After leaving Motörhead, Robertson joined Gary Barden's band Statetrooper and remained until they disbanded.|$|E
2500|$|... "Had it {{not been}} for the Tartars I would not be alive today. They were the nomads of the Crimea, in what was then no man's land between the Russian and German fronts, and favoured neither side. I had already struck up a good {{relationship}} with them, and often wandered off to sit with them. ‘Du nix njemcky’ they would say, ‘du Tartar,’ and try to persuade <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>join</b> their clan. Their nomadic ways attracted me of course, although by that time their movements had been restricted. Yet, it was they who discovered me in the snow after the crash, when the German search parties had given up. I was still unconscious then and only came round completely after twelve days or so, and by then I was back in a German field hospital. So the memories I have of that time are images that penetrated my consciousness. The last thing I remember was that it was too late to jump, too late for the parachutes to open. That must have been a couple of seconds before hitting the ground. Luckily I was not strapped in – I always preferred free movement to safety belts… My friend was strapped in and he was atomized on impact – there was almost nothing to be found of him afterwards. But I must have shot through the windscreen as it flew back at the same speed as the plane hit the ground and that saved me, though I had bad skull and jaw injuries. Then the tail flipped over and I was completely buried in the snow. That's how the Tartars found me days later. I remember voices saying ‘Voda’ (Water), then the felt of their tents, and the dense pungent smell of cheese, fat and milk. They covered my body in fat to help it regenerate warmth, and wrapped it in felt as an insulator to keep warmth in." ...|$|E

2500|$|At King's College, Wilkins pursued, {{among other}} things, X-ray {{diffraction}} work on ram sperm and DNA {{that had been}} obtained from calf thymus by the Swiss scientist Rudolf Signer. The DNA from Signer's lab was much more intact than the DNA which had previously been isolated. Wilkins discovered {{that it was possible}} to produce thin threads from this concentrated DNA solution that contained highly ordered arrays of DNA suitable for the production of X-ray diffraction patterns. Using a carefully bundled group of these DNA threads and keeping them hydrated, Wilkins and a graduate student Raymond Gosling obtained X-ray photographs of DNA that showed that the long, thin DNA molecule in the sample from Signer had a regular, crystal-like structure in these threads. Gosling later said [...] "When... I first saw all those discrete diffraction spots ...emerging on the film in the developing dish was a truly eureka moment....we realised that if DNA was the gene material then we had just shown that genes could crystallize!" [...] This initial X-ray diffraction work at King's College was done in May or June 1950. It was one of the X-ray diffraction photographs taken in 1950, shown at a meeting in Naples a year later, that sparked James Watson’s interest in DNA causing him to write [...] "suddenly I was excited about chemistry.....I began to wonder whether it would be possible for <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>join</b> Wilkins in working on DNA". At that time Wilkins also introduced Francis Crick to the importance of DNA. Crick advised him to work on proteins telling Wilkins [...] "what you ought to do is find yourself a good protein". Wilkins knew that proper experiments on the threads of purified DNA would require better X-ray equipment. Wilkins ordered a new X-ray tube and a new microcamera. He also suggested to Randall that the soon-to-be-appointed Rosalind Franklin should be reassigned from work on protein solutions to join the DNA effort.|$|E
