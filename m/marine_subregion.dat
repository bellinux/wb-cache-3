The aim of the BIGORNO project (Intertidal Biodiversity of the south of the Bay of Biscay and Observation for New research and Monitoring for decision support), financed by the Agency of Marine Protected Areas (AAMP) and the Departmental Council (CD 64), is to respond to significant deficiencies on biocenosis in the southern <b>marine</b> <b>subregion</b> “Bay of Biscay”. Investigations carried out in the WFD, since 2008, constitute an important basis of work for integration of fauna. Field studies undertaken since 2015 consisting of a sampling design suited to the substrates heterogeneity and the presence of microhabitats were established on an intertidal area specifically on a "Boulder fields" habitat. Assessment was undertaken by sampling quadrats of 0. 1 m² drawn randomly from a spatially stratified sampling plan. Our study aims for a better understanding of stratification of this habitat and allowed us to highligh tindicator taxa of the "Boulder fields" habitat. Functions included in the package indicspecies (CRAN) were used to conduct indicator species analysis and to assess the significance of the relationship between taxa or taxa combinations and the habitat. It is therefore possible to describe some species or species groups which are specific to boulder fields through the assessment of their functional traits and local biodiversity. These various analyses allow for a sustainable way of monitoring the Basque intertidal rocky shore...|$|E
40|$|Biodiversity {{conservation}} and response of benthic communities to pressures, related to global change and human activities, are a research priority. They also constitute a useful indicator {{to define the}} environmental status of the Marine Strategy Framework Directive {{as part of the}} European Water Framework Directive (WFD). The biogeographic features of the Aquitanian coast (in terms of rocky substrate communities) induce the interest to have a monitoring and research site. Indeed, it includes the habitat characteristics as well as fauna and flora (the Habitats Directive). The aim of the BIGORNO project is to implement new tools to assess the rocky biocenosis in the southern <b>marine</b> <b>subregion</b> of the Bay of Biscay by integrating fauna communities assessment (flora communities already monitored in WFD). This provides further information about the intertidal biodiversity and the spatial distribution of benthic communities. A standardized procedure for collecting information on benthic communities provides relevant indicators of intertidal habitat. Global environmental change (including climate evolution) should be considered while entering these indicators in European framework in order to compare results over longer periods. Using a spatially stratified random sampling plan, the mobile fauna (true abundance), fixed fauna and macroalgae (percentage cover) were measured in quadrats of 0. 1 m² spread both on upper and lower mediolittoral zones. The analysis highlight dependent faunistic and floristic structuration according to microhabitats which confirms the need of a such stratification. Species/taxa or species associations were also identified as indicators of microhabitats. These various analysis improve knowledge for monitoring the Basque intertidal rocky shore in a sustainable way. Finally, within the Marine Strategy Framework Directive, these results allow to take into account biogeographic specificities to harmonize protocol metrics at the scale of the sub-area Bay of Biscay...|$|E
40|$|Ecological  {{indicators}} are useful to monitor environmental changes and assess ecological management and conservation. They provide information {{to understand the}} environment and its health status while also highlighting changes in the environment by giving early warning signals. Among them, the identification of indicator species add ecological meaning to studied sites and their use is an alternative to sampling the entire biodiversity. The northern Basque  coast (located in  the  South  of  the  Bay  of  Biscay marine sub-area  - France) is  dominated by remarkable rocky habitats as stable platforms and mobile boulder fields exposed to swells and freshwater incomes. Recently, {{the context of the}} Marine Strategy Framework Directive emphasized significant deficiencies regarding rocky fauna communities. As it is observed  for other  sub-areas,  boulder  fields  habitat  present a high benthic fauna diversity, but surprisingly, no previous studies had been conducted locally to consider and identify benthic fauna indicator in this habitat. Two independent  Indicator Species Analyses (ISA)   were carried out  on two taxa matrix (mobile and sessile fauna) using the R package “indicspecies”.   It provides a set of  functions to assess the strength and statistical significance of the relationship between species occurrence/abundance and  groups of sites representing habitat types or community types. These functions allow to highlight single and/or combination species; assess significance of the association species pattern/microhabitats with a permutation  test; and select significant species (Indicator Value index) by ordering  them through two components values A (specificity) and B (fidelity). It is therefore possible to describe some species or species groups which could be used to detect changes over time within intertidal boulder fields habitat of this specific <b>marine</b> <b>subregion.</b> These various analyses could allow to monitor rocky foreshore macrofauna in a sustainable way...|$|E
40|$|In {{accordance}} with the Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD; 2008 / 56 /EC), {{it is appropriate to}} make provision for the development of criteria and methodological standards to ensure consistency and to allow for comparison between <b>marine</b> regions or <b>subregions</b> {{of the extent to which}} good environmental status (GES) is being achieved. In this report, methodological standards are reviewed for (1) the assessment of the status of the marine environment and the determination of GES; (2) environmental targets; and (3) monitoring. Methodological standards are defined in general terms as all methods developed and agreed in the framework of European or international conventions. The screening of available methodological standards is restricted to the WFD (2000 / 60 /EC), EQS Directive (2008 / 105 /EC), Habitats Directive (92 / 43 /EEC), Birds Directive (2009 / 147 /EC), CFP, and Regional Sea Conventions covering European seas (OSPAR, HELCOM, UNEP MAP, Black Sea Commission).
