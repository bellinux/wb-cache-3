40|$|<b>Motivations</b> <b>for</b> sex are {{numerous}} and varied (Browning, 2004; Meston 2 ̆ 6 Buss, 2007). Using exploratory factor analytic methods, 21 theoretically distinct motivations {{have been proposed}} (Browning, 2004; Meston 2 ̆ 6 Buss, 2007). A comprehensive number of <b>motivations</b> <b>for</b> sex {{has yet to be}} examined with confirmatory techniques. Theoretical work related to the treatment of sexual dysfunction has suggested that motivations focused on individual and partner pleasure would positively relate to sexual functioning (e. g., Leiblum 2 ̆ 6 Rosen, 1992). <b>Motivations</b> <b>for</b> sex also appear to vary as a function of ethnocultural factors, as some motivations have only been uncovered utilizing qualitative methods with diverse samples (Browning, 2004) and some ethnic groups appear to differ in the average degree to which they endorse specific motivations (Browning; 2004; Cooper et al., 1998). The current study expanded on previous literature by examining four distinct aims: (1) to confirm a comprehensive number of <b>motivations</b> <b>for</b> sex, (2) to examine ethnic differences in <b>motivations</b> <b>for</b> sex among the four largest ethnic groups in the U. S., (3) to explore clinical correlates of <b>motivations</b> <b>for</b> sex, and (4) to examine ethnic differences in the relations between <b>motivations</b> <b>for</b> sex and clinical correlates.

The {{purpose of this}} research study was {{to better understand the}} motivations of graduate students at U. S. higher education institutions for involvement in public engagement. The study employed a mixed-methods research approach with a modified transformative sequential strategy to identify and analyze graduate student <b>motivations</b> <b>for</b> public engagement, and was guided by the typology of Dr. KerryAnn O'Meara (2008) on faculty <b>motivations</b> <b>for</b> public engagement in combination with the findings of Dr. Timothy Eatman (2012) on publicly-engaged graduate and early career scholars. This study contributes to extant literature on <b>motivations</b> <b>for</b> public engagement through its focus on a less-studied population (graduate students) and development of a conceptual model for understanding graduate student <b>motivations</b> <b>for</b> public engagement. On a more practical level, findings may also enhance institutional, departmental, and programmatic understanding of how to cultivate and sustain graduate student <b>motivations</b> <b>for</b> public engagement...|$|R
40|$|The objetive of {{the study}} was to {{identify}} a) the <b>motivations</b> <b>for</b> communicating about non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) in a publicly accessible online forum, b) The significance (if any) of the "publicness" of the behavior. Using a Thematic Analysis of 423 text-based posts from an online NSSI forum, 5 <b>motivations</b> <b>for</b> using the site were identified: confessional, marking a turning point, acting as a deterrent, dispelling myths and offering or seeking support. <b>Motivations</b> <b>for</b> using the site differ markedly from <b>motivations</b> <b>for</b> engaging in NSSI and tend to be more outwardly focused. The publicness of the site therefore seems to be significant in terms of bearing witness, providing the opportunity to confront negative stereotypes, and the ability to seek and offer support to like-minded individuals...|$|R

Versions for the Sega Saturn and Sony PlayStation were in development, but cancelled. The game received critical acclaim, with reviewers praising the uniqueness and depth. Dungeon Keeper was re-released on gog.com in 2011, and on Origin in 2016. A fan-made mod, KeeperFX, was released, which fixes bugs and adds features. Dungeon Keeper {{was followed by a}} sequel, Dungeon Keeper 2, in 1999, and influenced games such as Lego Rock Raiders and Ghost Master.|$|E

5|$|Early {{proposals}} {{made by the}} National Capital Park and Planning Commission {{involved a}} route that followed US1 north to MD198, then east to Fort Meade, but lack of funding led to simpler plans to widen US 1 instead. During the 1930s, the New Deal programs promulgated by President Franklin Roosevelt led to a heightened awareness of the parkway proposals; a 1937 report by the Maryland State Planning Commission increased awareness further. Increasing accident levels on US 1 (which was {{called one of the}} deadliest roads in the world at the time) along with awareness of the need to mobilize national defense before World War II provided additional <b>motivation</b> <b>for</b> construction of the parkway.|$|E
