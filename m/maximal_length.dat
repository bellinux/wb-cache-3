Thus an isodiametric function bounds the smallest diameter (with respect to the simplicial metric where every edge has length one) of a van Kampen diagram for a particular relation w in terms of the length of w. A filling length function the smallest filling length of a van Kampen diagram for a particular relation w in terms of the length of w. Here the filling length of a diagram is the minimum, over all combinatorial null-homotopies of the diagram, of the <b>maximal</b> <b>length</b> of intermediate loops bounding intermediate diagrams along such null-homotopies.

There are several general inequalities connecting the Dehn function, the optimal isodiametric function and the optimal filling length function, but the precise relationship between them is not yet understood.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: The human male urethra {{has great}} {{capacity}} to extend under traction. This extensi-bility {{is the principle}} of some surgical techniques used to overcome urethral defects and for penile lengthening. However, to our knowledge safe limits of urethral extensibility in reconstructive surgery have not been yet established by a morphological study. To this end we measured fresh human cadaveric urethras with and without traction. Materials and Methods: We analyzed the macroscopically normal, fresh cadaveric urethra from 25 men 6 months to 73 years old at death (mean age 30. 6). Penile length and length of the total, penile, bulbar and membranous urethra were measured. <b>Length</b> under <b>maximal</b> constant trac-tion and the <b>maximal</b> stretched <b>length</b> without penile curvature at artificial erection were determined. Extensibility is expressed as the percent {{of the variation in}} initial length at rest and <b>maximal</b> constant traction <b>length.</b> <b>Maximal</b> stretched <b>length</b> without penile curvature at artifi-cial erection is expressed as a percent of <b>maximal</b> constant traction <b>length.</b> Results: Total urethral extensibility was higher than penile extensibility (p 0. 001).

2500|$|During the {{synthesis}} phase (S phase) {{in the cell}} cycle, the centrosome starts to duplicate. Just {{at the beginning of}} mitosis, both centrioles in each centrosome reach their <b>maximal</b> <b>length,</b> centrosomes recruit additional material and their nucleation capacity for microtubules increases. As mitosis progresses, both centrosomes separate to establish the mitotic spindle. In this way, the spindle in a mitotic cell has two poles emanating microtubules. Microtubules are long proteic filaments with asymmetric extremes, a [...] "minus"(-) end [...] relatively stable next to the centrosome, and a [...] "plus"(+) end [...] enduring alternate phases of growing-shrinking, exploring the center of the cell. During this searching process, a microtubule may encounter and capture a chromosome through the kinetochore. Microtubules that find and attach a kinetochore become stabilized, whereas those microtubules remaining free are rapidly depolymerized. As chromosomes have two kinetochores associated back-to-back (one on each sister chromatid), when one of them becomes attached to the microtubules generated by one of the cellular poles, the kinetochore on the sister chromatid becomes exposed to the opposed pole; for this reason, most of the times the second kinetochore becomes attached to the microtubules emanating from the opposing pole, {{in such a way that}} chromosomes are now bi-oriented, one fundamental configuration (also termed amphitelic) to ensure the correct segregation of both chromatids when the cell will divide.|$|E

We used the quadratic regression model to describe the stem elongation responses to winter dormancy conditions, and the logistic function to describe the weekly stems elongation.

More than 4000 data for various (a) chilling constant temperatures during dormancy, (b) dormancy duration, and (c) germination duration, were used. The models were applied to determine the optimal number of chill units. For this purpose, two criteria were used in different versions of the model: the <b>maximal</b> stem <b>length</b> and the <b>maximal</b> profit of farmers. For the two chilling temperatures of 2 °C and 6 °C, the optimal values of chill units (in the models of a <b>maximal</b> stem <b>length</b> and <b>maximal</b> profit of farmers) are close to one another, and the values of a <b>maximal</b> stem <b>length</b> and <b>maximal</b> profit are significantly different.

40|$|Abstract Background Mini-open {{carpal tunnel}} release has become {{increasingly}} popular {{for the treatment of}} carpal tunnel surgery. The main advantages are shortening recovery time and return-to-work time. However, the risk of neurovascular injury still remains worrisome. Methods In this study, we developed a new retractor (herein called the PSU retractor) modified from the widely used Senn retractor, with the aim of decreasing the risk of neurovascular problems from normal procedure. 3 -Dimensional computer design software (SolidWorks ® Office Premium 2007 SP 3. 1) was used to construct a 3 -D PSU retractor prototype. An amputated arm from a 30 -year-old woman diagnosed as synovial sarcoma at the shoulder was used to test the <b>maximal</b> visual <b>length.</b> A mini-surgical incision was performed at 3 cm distal to the transverse wrist crease and a tiny flexible ruler was inserted through the tunnel beneath the skin to measure the <b>maximal</b> visual <b>length.</b> Results Our new retractor showed significantly better <b>maximal</b> visual <b>length</b> compared to the Senn retractor (47. 7 (8. 1) mm vs. 39. 2 (6. 5) mm). In addition, most assessors expressed a higher satisfaction rate with the PSU retractor than with the Senn retractor (7. 3 (1. 9) vs. 6. 3 (1. 1)). Conclusion In conclusion, we have developed a promising new retractor using a computer design program, which appears to be an improvement on the currently available equipment used for mini-open carpal tunnel surgery.
