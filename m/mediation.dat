5|$|Farmer's wife Rebecca {{filed for}} divorce on April 5, 2011, {{claiming}} in court documents {{that she had no}} access to the family's finances except the salary she earned as a teacher's aide. On April 12, Farmer petitioned the court to dismiss his wife's divorce petition, contesting the idea that their marriage was irretrievably broken. The divorce proceedings were put on hold by mutual consent on May 26, 2011, but in a July 12 hearing, Farmer's wife asked that the judge schedule a trial date; the judge ordered <b>mediation</b> within 30 days instead. The <b>mediation</b> failed, and a trial date was set for November 22, shortly after the gubernatorial election. A second round of <b>mediation</b> shortly before the scheduled hearing resulted in a settlement between the parties; terms of the settlement were kept private.|$|E

5|$|On 10 December 1936, Álvarez put the Republic's {{case to the}} League of Nations, further {{demanding}} that the League condemn Italy's and Germany's decision to recognise the Nationalists. He pointed {{to the risk of}} the Spanish war spreading, and suggested that the Non-Intervention Committee was ineffective. This charge was denied by Lord Cranborne and Édouard Viénot, the British and French representatives respectively, who appealed to the League to endorse the <b>mediation</b> plan. The League condemned intervention, urged its council's members to support non-intervention, and commended <b>mediation.</b> It then closed discussion on Spain, leaving it to the Committee. The <b>mediation</b> plan, however, was soon dropped. Britain and France continued to consider, and put forward, plans to prevent foreign volunteers, outside of the Committee.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study was to {{increase}} the understanding of, and extend the knowledge about realization of <b>mediations</b> and its consequences on family law divisions and family centres. Within this area, organisational, methodical, relational and social preventative aspects of <b>mediations</b> were illustrated. This scope was judged to be of major importance, as recent studies show that children often suffer psychologically due to parents’ lack of cooperation. <b>Mediations</b> are considered as a way of getting parents to agree. To fulfil the purpose, six qualitative interviews were conducted, three on each function. A multidimensional tool for interpretation was used, containing organization analysis, social constructionist theories, system theories with focus on roles, and a cognitive perspective. Several important circumstances concerning <b>mediations</b> could be identified, like the importance of flexibility and voluntariness, focus on the children, combination of <b>mediations</b> and complimentary parental support and also the importance of meeting families on an early stage. The results showed that <b>mediations</b> are a preventative way of working with families with children, and that family centres are considered to have greater possibilities of designing <b>mediations</b> according to the above-mentioned circumstances. Furthermore it was showed that <b>mediations</b> are a functional way of recreating the characteristic of the nuclear family triad mother-father-child...|$|R

5|$|After having {{displaced}} the British as {{the dominant}} outside power following the War of 1812, the United States had {{assumed the role of}} mediator in intertribal disputes. Before the Black Hawk War, U.S. policy discouraged intertribal warfare. This was not strictly for humanitarian reasons: intertribal warfare made it more difficult for the United States to acquire Indian land and move the tribes to the West, a policy known as Indian removal, which had become the primary goal by the late 1820s. U.S. efforts at <b>mediation</b> included multi-tribal treaty councils at Prairie du Chien in 1825 and 1830, in which tribal boundaries were drawn. Native Americans sometimes resented American <b>mediation,</b> especially young men, for whom warfare was an important avenue of social advancement.|$|E

5|$|Penn National wanted Rosecroft {{to begin}} {{simulcasting}} races in late August 2011. Disputes between tracks and simulcasters about revenues, however, {{led to a}} delay in reaching new agreements on broadcast rights. In the 2011, the Maryland legislature passed a bill that required all parties to enter into <b>mediation.</b> If <b>mediation</b> was not successful by October 1, 2011, then an arbitrator was required to help. To resolve a conflict of interest, Penn National sold its financial stake in the Maryland Jockey Club's in July 2011. In August 2011, Rosecroft made public its plans for adding a casino at Rosecroft. It planned to destroy the grandstand and build a casino with approximately 4,700 slot machines alongside the track.|$|E

5|$|Because of {{domestic}} opposition, internal demoralization, and international hostility, Gaddafi assumed a more conciliatory attitude following his defeat.

As a result, Mitterrand forced Habré to accept the <b>mediation</b> efforts of the Organization of African Unity's Zambian Chairman, Kenneth Kaunda, which resulted in a ceasefire on September 11.|$|E
