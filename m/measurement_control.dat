40|$|Abstract. A {{scheme for}} <b>measurement</b> and <b>control</b> system on grain {{situation}} {{is presented in}} this paper. This system is mainly composed of sensor network, <b>measurement</b> and <b>control</b> extension, communication host and host computer. <b>Measurement</b> and <b>control</b> extension centres on microcontroller C 8051 to accomplish the measurement of grain temperature and humidity in granary. Instruction is transferred to <b>measurement</b> and <b>control</b> extension by communication host, at the same time, transferring the data measured by extension to host computer. Host computer achieves the regimentation of whole system by applying PC. Compared with traditional ones, this measurement system is much more simple, low-cost, efficient and responsive, with profoundly immediate significance and wide prospect...|$|R

The {{real-time}} <b>measurement</b> and <b>control</b> of clean-energy power parameters {{provides a}} reliable {{platform for the}} performance test, a working state simulation of clean-energy power system and effective supports for the reasonable design of clean-energy power system. The whole <b>measurement</b> and <b>control</b> system is controlled by PLC and monitored by Kingview software.

50|$|The Obstructions series, {{presently}} comprising 16 works, {{was triggered}} {{by the idea of}} revisiting the fragments that made up Today stripped of their urban/spatial context; and expanded by incorporating other categories of production that were not included in Today. The majority of works in the Obstruction series have a focus on the effort human beings exert for the continuity, comfort, <b>measurement,</b> <b>control,</b> maintenance, repair etc. of the body. The field of execution, or the final product of such activities could either be a material object that supports or supplements the body (Jean Factory, Rolling Mills, Clock Master, Cuisine), while at other times the body becomes the site of performance (Dancer, Painter), or operation itself (Brain Surgeon).|$|E
