40|$|A new {{navigation}} method, {{called a}} Line of Sight Counteraction Navigation (LOSCAN) algorithm {{has been introduced}} to aid manoeuvre decision making for collision avoidance based on a two-ship encounter. The LOSCAN algorithm is derived from {{an extension of the}} basic principle of traditional missile proportional navigation, recognising that the objective of the latter is target capture rather than target avoidance. The basic concept is to derive an acceleration command so as to increase the misalignment between the ships' relative velocity and the line-of-sight. The algorithm includes a risk assessment and the generation of appropriate navigation commands to manoeuvre own ship free of collision if a risk of collision exists. Numerical examples have been used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm. The relationship between the distance at the closest point of approach with respect to early warning distance, and with the norm of the acceleration, has also been analysed. In operation, the collision avoidance decision making process is a complicated problem, with its solution subject to ship states, practical dynamic constraints, Collision Avoidance Regulations (COLREGS), encountering ship manoeuvre coordination and human decision making factors. The proposed algorithm provides a consistent <b>manoeuvre</b> <b>signal</b> to aid decision-making...|$|R

50|$|The {{electromagnetic}} {{parking sensor}} (EPS) was re-invented and patented in 1992 by Mauro Del Signore. Electromagnetic sensors {{rely on the}} vehicle moving slowly and smoothly towards the object to be avoided. Once detected, the obstacle, if the vehicle momentarily stops on its approach, the sensor continues to give signal of presence of the obstacle. If the vehicle then resumes its <b>manoeuvre</b> the alarm <b>signal</b> {{becomes more and more}} impressive as the obstacle approaches. Electromagnetic parking sensors are often sold as not requiring any holes to be drilled offering a unique design that discreetly mounts on the inner side of the bumper preserving the 'new factory look' of your vehicle. Now they also come equipped with a camera to go with the sensor. By 2018 the US is requiring back up camera with sensors on all cars.|$|R
2500|$|At around 17:00, Detmers {{instructed}} his wireless {{operators to}} send a distress signal indicating Straat Malakka was being approached by a suspicious ship. Transmitted at 17:03 and repeated at 17:05, it contained the distress call for a merchantman under attack from a raider, rather than a warship (QQQQ as opposed to RRRR), the latitude and longitude of the transmitting ship, the time per Greenwich Mean Time instead of local time (a deliberate error to let the Kriegsmarine know a raider was likely about to be lost), and her name. This message was partially received by the tugboat Uco ("QQQQ [...] 1000 GMT") and a shore station at Geraldton, Western Australia (" [...] 7C 11115E 1000 GMT"). The Geraldton station broadcast a message to all ships asking {{if there was anything}} to report, which was interpreted by the Germans as acknowledgement of their signal. During the exchanges and distress signal, Sydney positioned herself off the raider's starboard beam on a parallel course, approximately [...] from Kormoran. Her main guns and torpedoes trained on the raider, but secondary weapons {{did not appear to be}} manned, personnel were standing on the upper deck, and although the cruiser's seaplane had been readied for launch, it was soon stowed away. During her <b>manoeuvre,</b> Sydney <b>signalled</b> [...] "IK", which made no sense from the Germans' perspective, as that combination was shorthand for [...] "You should prepare for a cyclone, hurricane, or typhoon". However, those two letters were part of the real Straat Malakkas secret secondary callsign, and Sydney was expecting the ship to confirm her identity by responding with the callsign's other two letters.|$|R

40|$|The {{impact of}} blood {{pressure}} changes on {{cerebral blood flow}} is an important area of investigation. The cerebral autoregulation mechanism acts to maintain blood supply to the brain, despite changes in blood pressure. Blood flow alterations are closely linked to neuronal activation, and this activity can be visualised using blood oxygenation level dependent magnetic resonance imaging (BOLD MRI) â€“ functional MRI. The aim of this project is to investigate the effect of dynamic blood pressure stimuli on the BOLD MRI signal in the brain. Two blood pressure stimuli were employed; thigh cuff deflation and the Valsalva <b>manoeuvre.</b> BOLD MRI <b>signal</b> changes were measured throughout both challenges. Arterial and venous blood pressure and tympanic membrane displacement (TMD) measurements were also made during these challenges. Blood pressure data was used to drive two linked models. The first model represented cerebral vascular physiology (Ursino) and this fed into a second model (Buxton), which predicted the resulting BOLD signal changes. This allowed comparison with experimental BOLD data. TMD data was also compared to intracranial pressure changes predicted by the Ursino model. The experimental BOLD data was found to agree reasonably well with the BOLD signal changes predicted by the modelling. BOLD signal changes are most influenced by deoxyhaemoglobin changes, predominantly {{as a result of}} blood flow alterations during the blood pressure challenges, which are not immediately compensated for by the autoregulation mechanism. TMD changes did not reflect intracranial pressure changes predicted by the modelling. In conclusion, if such blood pressure changes do occur during a functional MRI experiment, they may cause changes in the BOLD signal that are not due to neuronal activation. These signal changes may be employed to investigate the cerebral autoregulation mechanism across the brain, or to correct for inaccuracies in functional MRI data in patients with impaired cerebral autoregulatio...|$|R
40|$|The work {{described}} in this thesis tested the feasibility of using a towed array of hydrophones to: 1. localise sources of underwater acoustic noise radiated by the towvessel, 2. determine the absolute amplitudes of these sources, and 3. determine the resulting far-field acoustic signature of the tow-vessel. The concept was for the towvessel {{to carry out a}} U-turn manoeuvre so as to bring the acoustic section of the array into a location suitable for beamforming {{along the length of the}} tow-vessel. All three of the above were shown to be feasible using both simulated and field data, although no independent field measurements were available to fully evaluate the accuracy of the far-field acoustic signature determinations. A computer program was written to simulate the acoustic signals received by moving hydrophones. This program had the ability to model a variety of acoustic sources and to deal with realistic acoustic propagation conditions, including shallow water propagation with significant bottom interactions. The latter was accomplished using both ray and wave methods and it was found that, for simple fluid half-space seabeds, a modified ray method gave results that were virtually identical to those obtained with a full wave method, even at very low frequencies, and with a substantial saving in execution time. A field experiment was carried out during which a tug towing a 60 -hydrophone array carried out a series of U-turn <b>manoeuvres.</b> The <b>signals</b> received by the array included noise radiated by the tow-vessel, signals from acoustic tracking beacons mounted on the tow-vessel, and transient signals generated by imploding sources deployed from a second vessel. Algorithms were developed to obtain snapshots of the vertical plane and horizontal plane shapes of the array from the transient data and to use range data derived from the tracking beacon signals to track the hydrophones in the horizontal plane. The latter was complicated by a high proportion of dropouts and outliers in the range data caused by the directionality of the hydrophones at the high frequencies emitted by the beacons. Despite this, excellent tracking performance was obtained. Matched field inversion was used to determine the vertical plane array shapes at times when no transient signals were available, and to provide information about the geoacoustic properties of the seabed. There was very good agreement between the inversion results and array shapes determined using transient <b>signals.</b> During trial <b>manoeuvres</b> the array was moving rapidly relative to the vessel and changing shape. A number of different array-processing algorithms were developed to provide source localisation and amplitude estimates in this situation: a timedomain beamformer; two frequency-domain, data independent beamformers; an adaptive frequency-domain beamformer; and an array processor based on a regularised least-squares inversion. The relative performance of each of these algorithms was assessed using simulated and field data. Data from three different manoeuvres were processed and in each case a calibrated source was localised to within 1 m of its known position at the source's fundamental frequency of 112 Hz. Localisation was also successful in most instances at 336 Hz, 560 Hz and 784 Hz, although with somewhat reduced accuracy due to lower signal to noise ratios. Localisation results for vessel noise sources were also consistent with the positions of the corresponding items of machinery. The estimated levels of the calibrated source obtained during the three manoeuvres were all within 4. 1 dB of the calibrated value, and varied by only 1. 3 dB between manoeuvres. Results at the higher frequencies had larger errors, with a maximum variation of 3. 8 dB between serials, and a maximum deviation from the calibrated value of 6. 8 dB. An algorithm was also developed to predict the far-field signature of the tow-vessel from the measured data and results were produced. This algorithm performed well with simulated data but no independent measurements were available to compare with the field results...|$|R
