40|$|Malaysia has {{invested}} multi-million ringgit on the Malaysia’s <b>Multipurpose</b> Identity <b>Card</b> (MyKad) initiative {{for the protection}} of citizens from terrorism as well as for effective and efficient government and private sector applications. If it is not used, the initiative is wasted. For the success of MyKad adoption, both individual and organizations need to accept this initiative. Prior studies have been conducted on individual acceptance (e. g. Yeow et al., 2007; Loo et al., 2011); however no study has been conducted on organization acceptance. This research investigates organizations (such as banks, insurance companies, unit trust agencies and hotels) acceptance of MyKad initiative. Organizations do not have MyKad; therefore, their MyKad acceptance (i. e., the dependent variable) can only be measured by their intention to use MyKad reader for identity verification of transactions such as opening a bank/unit trust account, making insurance claims and registering a hotel room. The independent variables were taken from UTAUT’s (Venkatesth, 2003) four constructs (i. e. performance expectancy, effort expectancy, social influence and facilitating conditions) and two other variables (i. e. anxiety and perceived credibility). In this preliminary study, fifty questionnaire samples were collected from two cities in Malaysia. The findings show that organizations did not have a high intention to use MyKad reader because of their lack of understanding about its benefits (performance expectancy), ease of use, social support and facilitating conditions.

40|$|This paper {{contrasts}} {{the success}} and failure of two electronic payment systems in Hong Kong, Octopus and Mondex, during 1996 - 2002. The case illustrates the new properties of electronic currencies, and provides insights for product designers and regulators. Mondex was endowed with the full legal status of money, launched by a mammoth banking group, with Mondex cards given away for free to consumers. Yet the Mondex system went into oblivion within five years. Octopus started as a modest stored value transport ticket that required a deposit. It ended up as a city-wide <b>multipurpose</b> payment <b>card</b> used by 95 % of the adult population. The system has saved significant transaction costs from the handling of coins, generating heavy transactions and turnover volume. The success of Octopus {{and the failure of}} Mondex cannot be explained by marketing strategies or technical merits alone. The two systems sought to overcome user resistance in different approaches: Mondex relied on voluntary uptake, but Octopus imposed a compulsory switch upon a large base of commuters. The case shows that in electronic currencies, large merchants and technology platforms are now {{in a better position to}} negotiate for what is valid money and what is not. Mondex, a legitimate and trustworthy source of money supply from the banking industry, failed to diffuse across the public. Meanwhile a large merchant group equipped with the point-of-sale device was able to define a new value token for the public. By controlling the material interface of electronic payment, the merchant side is playing a more active role in the loop of social consensus of money...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{increase}} of luminosity expected by LHC during Phase 1 will impose several constrains for rate reduction while maintaining high efficiency in the CMS Level 1 trigger system. The TwinMux {{system is the}} early layer of the muon barrel region that concentrates the information from different subdetectors DT, RPC and HO. It arranges and fan-out the slow optical trigger links from the detector chambers into faster links (10 Gbps) that are sent to the track finders. Results, from collision runs, that confirm the satisfactory operation of the trigger system up to {{the output of the}} barrel track finder, will be shown. SUMMARY: In view of the {{increase of}} luminosity during phase 1 upgrade of LHC, the muon trigger chain of the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) experiment underwent considerable improvements. The muon detector was designed for preserving the complementarity and redundancy of three separate muon detection systems, Cathode Strip Chambers (CSC), Drift Tubes (DT) and Resistive Plate Chambers (RPC), until they were combined at the input to the Global Trigger. The upgrade of the muon trigger aimed at exploiting the redundancy of the three muon detection systems earlier in the trigger processing chain in order to obtain a high-performance trigger with higher efficiency and better rate reduction. Since every additional hit along a muon trajectory further improves the fake rejection and muon momentum measurement, the upgrade seeks to combine muon hits at the input stage to the Muon Track-Finders layer rather than at its output. All the hits should then contribute to the track irrespectively of the sub-system that detects them. The upgrade introduced a regional segmentation that treats muon tracks separately depending on η. It distinguishes a barrel region (low η), an endcap region (high η) and a transition region between them (η∼ 1) called overlap. In the new muon trigger chain, the adaptive layer for the track finder in the barrel region is called TwinMux. It allows for bringing forward the merging of the DT, RPC and HO (the HCAL Outer barrel) trigger primitives, unburdening the trigger processors. TwinMux is charged of sending such combined primitive to the Barrel Muon Track Finder (BMTF) and, in addition, also the RPC and DT data uncombined are sent to the Overlap Muon Track Finder (OMTF) after applying a clusterization of the RPC hits. In both cases a scale up in the transmission rate, and hence a {{reduction in the number of}} links, is provided. TwinMux is also responsible for duplicating the trigger primitives in order to reduce connections between trigger processors increasing the reliability of the system. In the barrel region the combined primitives are sent to the BMTF that implements the legacy trigger algorithm of the DT track finder with the addition of several improvements n rate reduction at higher efficiency and quality. For instance BMTF implements an extension of the legacy algorithm for the Pt assignment that using the primitive bending angle obtains a factor 1. 5 gain in rate for typical thresholds and the same efficiency at plateau for prompt muons. Moreover the BMTF reduced the legacy algorithm latency running at a speed three times faster than the legacy hardware allowing the TwinMux to compute the superprimitive within the tight latency boundaries imposed by the total L 1 trigger latency. Both TwinMux and BMTF are single slot double-width and full-height μTCA board based around a Xilinx Virex- 7 FPGA and embedding the optics for high speed data transmission (up to 13 Gbps). The BMTF board is an MP 7 <b>card</b> (<b>multipurpose</b> hardware wide used in the trigger upgrade of CMS) while for the TwinMux a custom hardware development was necessary since the DT on-detector electronics transmit data at a low rate requiring a deserialization done by the standard I/O input of the FPGA...|$|R
