This study aims {{to learn more about}} other forms of distortions such as tadlis, gharar, maysir, ihtikar and bay 'najasy and to recognize its form at the process of transaction in the Islamic capital market, especially the secondary market so that the process securities transactions sharia truly reflects the activity of sharia economic transactions which has values of brotherhood, mutual interest, morality, the orientation of the hereafter and no exploitation. The approach taken is the approach of Jurisprudence and Islamic economics.

Tax policy is becom-ing {{the part of the}} EU integration policies. The main aim of the EU tax policy is to eliminate differences in individual tax systems of the EU member states mainly through minimization of disproportions in the impacts on competition and through enabling free movement of goods, services, persons and capital on the EU internal market. There was introduced the value added tax system with differentiated rates, which remained in competency of governments of the individual states in 1973. The primary effort, after the implementation of the value added tax, was to complete the structural harmonization at first and then to try to harmonize the tax rates. The aim of all the above introduced efforts is to contribute to smooth functioning of the internal market (Široký 2007). The long-term aim of the European Commission is to reduce the differences in national tax systems of the EU member states – either through tax harmoni-zation or through coordination, to not cause threats for smooth functioning of the single <b>market,</b> <b>market</b> <b>distortion,</b> or tax obstacles to the efficient allocation Selected problems of value added tax application in the agricultural sector of the European Union internal market Vybrané problémy aplikace daně z přidané hodnoty v zemědělském sektoru jednotného vnitřního trhu Evropské uni...|$|E

When unemployment arises from labor <b>market</b> <b>distortions,</b> <b>market</b> imperfections, or from information imperfections, labor-managed firms {{are superior to}} capitalist firms. The firm's governance and decision making structures then play an instrumental role {{in the level of}} unemployment.

In such cases, collective and coordinated efforts are needed to reduce the level of involuntary unemployment. ...|$|R
40|$|A popular {{view is that}} ageing populations {{increase}} {{health expenditure}} to GDP ratios because health expenditure correlates positively with age and because the concomitant shrinking of the labour force depresses GDP. The resulting increase in transfers from the young to the old then calls for a reform of health care policies. This article critically examines the arguments underlying this view. It gives credit to factors that counteract the expenditure effect, the effects upon health care <b>market</b> and labour <b>market</b> <b>distortions</b> and the effects upon intergenerational solidarity. Although important, these factors are found to have insufficient weight to invalidate the popular view. (JEL: H 21, I 10, J 10) Copyright 2006, Oxford University Press. ...|$|R
40|$|Should the {{government}} subsidize entry to promote competition? In theory, free entry {{does not guarantee}} the socially optimum number of entrants. In differentiated product <b>markets,</b> free entry can result either in excessive or insufficient entry. In this paper I propose an empirical framework {{to address this issue}} with a case study of the Medicare HMO <b>market</b> for 2003 and 2004. I perform counterfactual welfare simulations with different entry conditions and with different government payment rates to HMOs. The results indicate that uniformly raising the payment rate lowers national welfare, which supports {{the government}}'s efforts to contain the payment rate in my sample years. A comparison of the cases with and without entry and/or <b>market</b> power indicates that this welfare loss does not come from additional entry, but instead the oligopolistic <b>market</b> structure and <b>market</b> <b>distortion</b> from the payment rate subsidy. The number of entrants is likely to be insufficient. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{last decade}} {{has been marked}} by cycles of {{excessive}} boom and bust in the housing <b>market.</b> However, not all countries have experienced high volatility in their house prices. Indeed, Germany has been unique in retaining flat price levels over the whole period and failing to respond to any of the macroeconomic shocks. The main reason for this stability can be found in real estate finance and in the existence of a sophisticated rental <b>market.</b> While in other countries monetary stimuli are effectively transmitted to the real economy via the housing <b>market,</b> the German insistence on prudential lending isolates the housing <b>market</b> from financial <b>market</b> <b>distortions.</b> By demanding high deposits, aligning lending to the mortgage lending value instead of the <b>market</b> value and by offering predominantly fixed-rate mortgages, banks reduce the risk of defaults and thus contribute to stability in the <b>market.</b> This system has evolved as a result not of regulations but of a sophisticated rental <b>market</b> which enables households to save their own funds for house purchases. This, in turn, explains the preference for fixed-rate mortgages. ...|$|R

Although many in {{the movement}} oppose government regulation of business, believing it to be generally counterproductive, they contend that different legal and economic principles such as full-cost accounting or [...] "internalizing externalities" [...] - rather than government regulations - {{would be more effective}} at remedying problems such as pollution. A central tenet of a libertarian environmentalist stance is that corporate externalities are not priced into the <b>market</b> correctly, creating <b>market</b> <b>distortions</b> in the valuation and price of goods, healthy living and the value of the environment. Greenhouse gases should be taxed directly, according to a formula which calculates the negative costs to the global environment of burning more non-renewable fossil fuels. This approach, it is argued, also has the advantage of providing the correct price signals to utilities and other energy consumers so that they can rapidly convert to more environmentally friendly technologies.

The results of this paper {{cast doubt on the}} generality of the proposition on the sensitivity of economic efficiency to <b>market</b> <b>distortions.</b> Our results show that removing labor <b>market</b> <b>distortions</b> would increase output by less than 1 % of the base year GDP.

SAPs are based on neoclassical economic ideals which indicate, among other things, that <b>market</b> <b>distortions</b> create significant barriers to economic progress. Neoclassical economics is shown in this thesis to be based on gender bias, formal sector bias, and ethnocentric assumptions which prohibit the conceptualization that gender-based discrimination can make up <b>market</b> <b>distortions.</b> Given the specific cultural and economic role of women in SSA, this omission has lead to the inability of SAPs to target the full range of <b>market</b> <b>distortions</b> effectively.
