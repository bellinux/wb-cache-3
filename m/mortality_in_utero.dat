40|$|SUMMARY Familial data on neural tube malformations in Great Britain were {{submitted}} to segre-gation analysis under the mixed model. Maternal and fetal factors cannot be discriminated {{in the absence}} of substantial bodies of data on spina bifida survivors who reproduce or on half-sibs. Early abortion studies would allow differential <b>mortality</b> <b>in</b> <b>utero</b> to be taken into account. After fitting the mixed and generalised single locus models, it is concluded that the multifactorial model can provisionally be used for calculation of recurrence risks. Pathogenic hypotheses implicating twinning seem to rest on little evidence. Epidemiological features and the pattern of familial aggregation of neural tube malformations suggest genetic as well as environmental factors at play in their causation. Two large bodies of data from Britain are sub-mitted to segregation analysis under the mixed model (Morton and MacLean, 1974), and the best fitting model is used for calculation of specific recurrence risks. Neural tube malformations This term covers a variety of congenital malforma-tions-anencephaly, iniencephaly, encephalocele, myelocele, and meningocele (but not hydrocephalus) -sharing a number of epidemiological features which, together with their co-occurrence in families (Carter et al., 1968; Smith, 1976), suggest that they have a common aetiology. In family studies, it is usual to include encephalocele, meningocele, and myelocele with spina bifida cystica, and iniencephaly with anencephaly. EPIDEMIOLOGICAL FEATURES The frequency of neural tube malformations among all births, live and stillbirths, has been found to vary with time, space, ethnic group, socioeconomic status, sex, maternal age, and parity. This frequency varies by a factor of three in various communit...|$|E
40|$|The Trivers and Willard model (TWM) {{predicts that}} for {{polygynous}} ungulates, females of high phenotypic quality should produce more sons than daughters, whereas females of low phenotypic quality should produce more daughters. Kruuk et al. {{showed that in}} red deer the TWM only applied when the population was below carrying capacity, and they suggested that published examples supported their interpretation. More recently, Saltz proposed that mothers' age rather than condition could account for skewed sex ratios observed in ungulate populations. We tested these predictions by using data on maternal age, mass, kidney fat reserves (KFI), and fetal sex ratio in an invading population of Himalayan tahr (n = 252), a highly sexually dimorphic and polygynous ungulate introduced to New Zealand. Differences in the body mass and KFI of female tahr supported the prediction that the populations in areas colonized for less than 15 years were below carrying capacity, whereas those in areas colonized for more than 30 years were at, or near, carrying capacity. There was no trend for mothers either of larger mass or with greater KFI to produce more sons than daughters. There was also {{no evidence of a}} quadratic relationship between maternal age and the proportion of male fetuses. However, the proportion of male fetuses declined with increasing sampling date independent of maternal attributes. Among 1193 females checked for pregnancy, pregnancy rates increased to a maxima in mid-July. Thereafter, the proportion of females pregnant declined among the three age classes (1, 2, and 3 or more years). Our results therefore provide support for the idea that males experience greater <b>mortality</b> <b>in</b> <b>utero.</b> The role of differential fetal mortality in determining ungulate birth sex ratios deserves further investigation.

30|$|Reliable antenatal {{predictive}} {{criteria for}} critically progressive CHD justifying experimental fetal cardiac surgery {{still have to}} be established. A possible definition of critically progressive valvular disease could be the situation of a primarily biventricular heart progressively deteriorating into a univentricular anatomy due to increasing hypoplasia of one ventricular chamber. This would apply both to fetuses with critical pulmonary stenosis with intact ventricular septum deteriorating to pulmonary atresia as well as for fetuses with critical aortic stenosis and progressive hypoplasia of the left ventricle (Figs. 1, 2, 3). Unfortunately, the results of attempted intrauterine transcatheter relief techniques for left ventricular outflow tract obstruction or aortic valve stenosis have been inconsistent and mostly discouraging so far [16, 17, 26, 28, 31 – 33, 50, 51]. However, considering that the intrauterine evolution of some forms of congenital heart defects continues to have significant morbidity and <b>mortality</b> both <b>in</b> <b>utero</b> and <b>in</b> the early postnatal period, there seem to be numerous good clinical reasons to further assess the role of prenatal surgical approaches for ameliorating these conditions.|$|R
40|$|The {{increasing}} {{prevalence of}} heart disease and diabetes among aging populations in low and middle income countries leads to questions regarding the degree to which endogenous early life exposures (exposures <b>in</b> <b>utero)</b> are important determinants of these health conditions. We devised a test using infant mortality (IMR) to verify if season of birth is a good indicator of early life (<b>in</b> <b>utero)</b> conditions that precipitate adult onset of disease. We linked annual IMR at the municipality (municipio) level from the late 1920 s to early 1940 s with individual birth year and place using a representative sample of older Puerto Rican adults (n =  1447) from the Puerto Rican Elderly: Health Conditions (PREHCO) study. We estimated the effects of season of birth on adult heart disease and diabetes for all respondents and then for respondents according to whether they were born when IMR was lower or higher, controlling for age, gender, obesity, respondent's educational level, adult behavior (smoking and exercise) and other early life exposures (childhood health, knee height and childhood socioeconomic status (SES)). The pattern of effects suggests that season of birth reflects endogenous causes: (1) odds {{of heart disease}} and diabetes were strong and significant for those born during the lean season in years when IMR was lower; (2) effects remained consistent even after controlling for other childhood conditions and adult behavior; but (3) no seasonality effects on adult health for adults born when IMR was higher. We conclude that in this population of older Puerto Rican adults there is continued support that the timing of adverse endogenous (<b>in</b> <b>utero)</b> conditions such as poor nutrition and infectious diseases is associated with adult heart disease and diabetes. It will be important to test the validity of these findings in other similar populations in the developing world.

During the last decades and especially in developed countries, the incidence of cancer is increasing dramatically, with an incidence of 1 in 1, 000 pregnancies.

The aim of this study was to investigate the outcome of pregnancy in women with diagnosis of cancer; in particular, neonatal morbidity and <b>mortality,</b> after <b>in</b> <b>utero</b> exposure to chemotherapy, were evaluated. A total of 59 singletons and one twin pregnancy complicated by cancer were followed at our tertiary centre over the last 15 years. A different treatment, based on surgery and/or chemotherapy in pregnancy or delayed to the postpartum period, was employed. There were 59 live births (97 %), one foetal loss and one stillbirth at 28 weeks. The congenital malformation rate was 5 % (n = 3). The rate of preterm birth was 83 %. The mean birthweight and mean birthweight percentile were 2, 098 g (740 - 3930) and 46 (7 - 93), respectively; 32 % of neonates were small for gestational age (SGA). Dividing the population into treated or untreated with chemotherapy, the rate of SGA was not statistically significant different between the two groups.

40|$|Our {{objective}} was a retrospective evaluation of cranial US in survivors of twin pregnancy with feto-fetal transfusion syndrome (FFTS), {{with knowledge of}} prenatal treatment and neonatal/postnatal clinical data. In 18 pregnancies with FFTS (January 1996 to May 2000), pregnancy management and outcome, and neonatal clinical/neurological data and follow-up (age of 3 - 7 months) were documented when available. Postnatal cranial US abnormalities were differentiated in prenatal and peri/postnatal lesions, respectively, in "donor" and "recipient. " The statistical analysis used was Mann Whitney U test and Fisher's exact test. Overall pregnancy survival rate was 19 of 36 (53 %); mors <b>in</b> <b>utero</b> occurred <b>in</b> five twin members. Gestational age at birth was significantly lower in FFTS after laser coagulation (13 of 18; p< 0. 05). Initial (</= 4 days of age) postnatal cranial US was abnormal in 13 of 27 cases: antenatal brain lesion in 9 of 13 patients (7 of 13 donors, 2 of 14 recipients); after treatment: antenatal hemorrhage (n= 6), hydrocephaly (n= 1), subependymal germinolysis (n= 1), lenticulostriatal vasculopathy (n= 1), evidence for brain atrophy (n= 2), cystic periventricular leukomalacia in< 3 days (n= 1); peri/postnatal brain lesions in 4 of 13 patients (hemorrhage (n= 3), and periventricular leukomalacia (n= 1).

40|$|We {{demonstrate}} {{a role for}} the NAD-dependent deacetylase Sirt 1 in the regulation of autophagy. In particular, transient increased expression of Sirt 1 is sufficient to stimulate basal rates of autophagy. In addition, we show that Sirt 1 −/− mouse embryonic fibroblasts do not fully activate autophagy under starved conditions. Reconstitution with wild-type but not a deacetylase-inactive mutant of Sirt 1 restores autophagy in these cells. We further demonstrate that Sirt 1 can form a molecular complex with several essential components of the autophagy machinery, including autophagy genes (Atg) 5, Atg 7, and Atg 8. In vitro, Sirt 1 can, in an NAD-dependent fashion, directly deacetylate these components. The absence of Sirt 1 leads to markedly elevated acetylation of proteins known to be required for autophagy in both cultured cells and in embryonic and neonatal tissues. Finally, we show that Sirt 1 −/− mice partially resemble Atg 5 −/− mice, including the accumulation of damaged organelles, disruption of energy homeostasis, and early perinatal <b>mortality.</b> Furthermore, the <b>in</b> <b>utero</b> delivery of the metabolic substrate pyruvate extends the survival of Sirt 1 −/− pups.

Expression for over one year was demonstrated using reporter genes. In addition, it was shown previously that transgenes delivered by this method release protein into the general circulation. Given these results experiments were designed {{to test the hypothesis}} that <b>in</b> <b>utero</b> rAAV gene therapy could result in long term physiologic modification. Methods A rAAV recombinant expressing ciliary neurotrophic factor (cntf) and green fluorescent (gfp) in a polycistronic messenger was used to treat rat fetuses <b>in</b> <b>utero.</b> CNTF causes weight loss and decreased water consumption as a measurable physiologic effect. GFP was used as a marker of gene expression. Results <b>In</b> <b>utero</b> gene transfer with rAAV carrying human cntf and gfp resulted in long-term gene expression in rat. CNTF-specific physiologic effects of a decrease in weight and water intake were obtained. Expression of the GFP was documented in the treated animals at one year of age. Conclusion Given this data, <b>in</b> <b>utero</b> gene therapy with rAAV into multipotential stem cells resulted in long term systemic physiologic modification of the treated animals by the transgene product. <b>In</b> <b>utero</b> rAAV gene therapy potentially could be used for gene replacement therapy in metabolic disorders. </p...|$|R

Maternal tanezumab administration appeared to increase stillbirths and infant mortality, but no consistent pattern of gross and/or microscopic change was detected to explain the <b>mortality.</b> Offspring exposed <b>in</b> <b>utero</b> were evaluated at 12 months of age using light microscopy (all tissues), stereology (basal forebrain cholinergic and dorsal root ganglia neurons), and morphometry (sural nerve). Light microscopy revealed decreased number of neurons in sympathetic ganglia (superior mesenteric, cervicothoracic, and ganglia in the thoracic sympathetic trunk). Stereologic assessment indicated an overall decrease in dorsal root ganglion (thoracic) volume and number of neurons in animals exposed to tanezumab 4 mg/kg (n 9) and 30 mg/kg (n 1). At all tanezumab doses, the sural nerve was small due to decreases in myelinated and unmyelinated axons. Existing axons/ myelin sheaths appeared normal when viewed with light and transmission electron microscopy.
