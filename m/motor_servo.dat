40|$|This article {{presented}} an improved nonlinear {{sliding mode control}} based on disturbance observer for the permanent magnet synchronous <b>motor</b> <b>servo</b> system. The position transient response performances, such as fast response and non-overshoot, are enhanced {{by the introduction of}} novel nonlinear sliding surface in the design of sliding mode control law. In order to abolish the analysis necessity of changeable uncertainties and alleviate the system chattering, the nonlinear sliding mode control algorithm is improved by adaptive parameter estimation and saturation function. Since the improved nonlinear sliding mode control algorithm is sensitive to mismatched uncertainties which are mainly due to the load disturbance, a disturbance observer is put forward to estimate the mismatched uncertainties and is integrated into control law design to improve the positioning accuracy. The stability of improved nonlinear sliding mode control based on disturbance observer is proved based on the Lyapunov approach. The simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed improved nonlinear sliding mode control based on disturbance observer for permanent magnet synchronous <b>motor</b> <b>servo</b> system with stationary and dynamic trajectory tracking...|$|E

40|$|In this study, a {{composite}} adaptive {{sliding mode control}} using Multiple Models (MM-CASMC) is proposed for precision position control of an induction <b>motor</b> <b>servo</b> system with parametric uncertainties and external disturbance. The MM-CASMC is designed based on a classical sliding mode control frame. Robustness against parametric uncertainties and high-frequency extern disturbance are both obtained via online parameters estimation and switching control, respectively. A composite adaption law which combines direct and BGF-LS type indirect adaptive methods is developed to achieve both Globally Uniformly Ultimately Boundness (GUUB) and approximately exponential convergence in large range under persistent excitation, the later implies clearer transient behaviour which is of great importance but not provided by standard direct adaptive method. Moreover, a multiple model adaptive control design is further incorporated to achieve improvement in transient response by utilizing model switching and parameters estimates resetting and an noval method by means of dual-channel filtering is proposed for regessor filtering and model switching. For the proposed strategy, the GUUB stability and improvments in transient behaviour and adaptability to sudden changes in the parameter values are all proved in Lyapunov sense.

40|$|Abstract. One of {{the most}} {{important}} factors which influence on the dynamical behavior of the linear <b>motor</b> <b>servo</b> drives for CNC machine tools is position loop gain or Kv factor. From the magnitude of the Kv-factor depends tracking or following error. In multi-axis contouring the following errors along the different axes may cause form deviations of the machined contours. Generally position loop gain Kv should be high for faster system response and higher accuracy, but the maximum gains allowable are limited due to undesirable oscillatory responses at high gains and low damping factor. Usually Kv factor is experimentally tuned on the already assembled machine tool. This paper presents a simple method for analytically calculation of the position loop gain Kv. A combined digital-analog model of the 4 -th order of the position loop is presented. In order to ease the calculation, the 4 -th order system is simplified with a second order model. With this approach it is very easy to calculate the Kv factor for necessary position loop damping. The difference of the replacement of the 4 -th order system with second order system is presented with the simulation program MATLAB. Analytically calculated Kv factor is function of the nominal angular frequency ω and damping D of the linear <b>motor</b> <b>servo</b> drive electrical parts (motor and regulator), as well as sampling period T. The influence of nonlinearities was taken with the correction factor. Our investigations have proven that experimentally tuned Kv factor differs from analytically calculated Kv factor less than 10 %, which is completely acceptable...|$|E

The redundancy technique {{is one of the most}} effective methods to improve the reliability of <b>motor</b> <b>servo</b> systems. In this paper, the structure of dual-redundancy permanent magnet synchronous motor (DRPMSM) with weak thermal coupling and no electromagnetic coupling is analyzed and the mathematical model of this motor is established. However, there is little research on how to suppress the torque ripple caused by short-circuited coils in the DRPMSM. The main contribution of this paper is to present the advantages of DRPMSM and to find a way to suppress the torque ripple caused by the short circuit fault in DRPMSM. In order to improve operation quality and enhance the reliability of DRPMSM after a short circuit occurs, the torque ripple caused by the coils inter-turn short circuit fault in DRPMSM is analyzed in detail. Then, a control method for suppressing the electromagnetic torque ripple of a short-circuited coil is proposed for the first time by using an improved adaptive proportional resonant (PR) controller and a proportional integral (PI) controller in parallel. PR control is a method of controlling alternating components without steady-state error, and it can be used to suppress torque ripple. DRPMSM adopts speed and current double closed-loop control strategies. An improved adaptive PR controller and a PI controller are employed in parallel for the speed loop, while traditional PI control is adopted in current loop. From the simulation and experimental results, the torque ripple is reduced from 45. 4 to 5. 6 % when the torque ripple suppression strategy proposed in this paper is adopted, in the case that the speed is 600 r/min. The torque ripple suppression strategy based on the PR controller can quickly and effectively suppress the torque ripple caused by the short-circuited coils, which makes the motor speed more stable...|$|E
