In 2016, he remarked, [...] "as a film critic, it taught <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> a film really gets under your skin and really provokes a visceral reaction, {{you have to be very}} careful about {{assessing}} it... I didn't walk out on Blue Velvet because it was a bad film. I {{walked out on}} it because it was a really good film. The point was at the time I wasn't good enough for it." ...|$|E

One {{could ask for}} clarification, but to even hint that one disagreed with him, or worse yet, to contradict him, would result in an immediate and permanent order to leave. One was tempted to ask such forbidden questions because Victor lived in mythic time and was totally uninterested in other people's concepts of logic or consistency... Another student told <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> Victor read a new book and believed it was true, then he considered it to have always been true and would rethink his history accordingly." ...|$|E

The chorus says [...] "Now that you can't have <b>me,</b> <b>that's</b> <b>when</b> you want <b>me.</b> But baby, it's too late, time to set the record straight." [...] The song is woman-empowering and {{documents}} the heartache of a relationship breakdown before refusing to accept her ex-lover's apology.|$|R

2500|$|My husband told <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> {{he was a}} lad of {{seventeen}} a thought struck him suddenly, which became the foundation of all his future discoveries.

But by the help of a learned Jew in Lincoln he found out {{the true nature of the}} discovery which had dawned on him.

2500|$|... "Omichund, his {{confidential}} servant, as he thought, {{told his}} master {{of an agreement}} made between the English and Monsieur Duprée [...] to attack him, and received for that advice a sum of not less than four lacks of rupees. Finding {{this to be the}} man in whom the nawab entirely trusted, it soon became our object to consider him as a most material engine in the intended revolution. We therefore made such an agreement as was necessary for the purpose, and entered into a treaty with him to satisfy his demands. When all things were prepared, and the evening of the event was appointed, Omichund informed Mr. Watts, who was at the court of the nawab, that he insisted upon thirty lacks of rupees, and five per cent. upon all the treasure that should be found; that, unless that was immediately complied with, he would disclose the whole to the nawab; and that Mr. Watts, and the two other English gentlemen then at the court, should be cut off before the morning. Mr. Watts, immediately on this information, dispatched an express to me at the council. I did not hesitate to find out a stratagem to save the lives of these people, and secure success to the intended event. For this purpose we signed another treaty. The one was called the Red, the other the White treaty. This treaty was signed by every one, except admiral Watson; and I should have considered myself sufficiently authorised to put his name to it, by the conversation I had with him. As to the person who signed admiral Watson's name to the treaty, whether he did it in his presence or not, I cannot say; but this I know, that he thought he had sufficient authority for so doing. This treaty was immediately sent to Omichund, who did not suspect the stratagem. The event took place, and success attended it; and the House, I am fully persuaded, will agree with <b>me,</b> <b>that,</b> <b>when</b> the very existence of the Company was at stake, and the lives of these people so precariously situated, and so certain of being destroyed, {{it was a matter of}} true policy and of justice to deceive so great a villain." ...|$|E
