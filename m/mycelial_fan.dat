50|$|The fungus enters through wounds on {{susceptible}} {{trees and}} grows in {{and beneath the}} bark, eventually killing the cambium all the way round the twig, branch or trunk. The first symptom of C. parasitica infection is a small orange-brown area on the tree bark. A sunken canker then forms as the <b>mycelial</b> <b>fan</b> spreads under the bark. As the hyphae spread, they produce several toxic compounds, the most notable of which is oxalic acid. This acid lowers the pH of the infected tissue from around the normal 5.5 to approximately 2.8, which is toxic to plant cells. The canker eventually girdles the tree, killing everything above it. Distinctive yellow tendrils (cirrhi) of conidia can be seen extruding in wet weather.|$|E

GPS tracking can aid in the monitoring of these areas. However, sometimes distinct centers will be absent and diseased trees are scattered throughout the stand.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Incidence of Armillaria root {{disease and}} the {{population}} structure of associated Armillaria spp. were studied in 5 - 17 -year-old Scots pine plantations in west-central Poland. Two infection centres (1. 14 – 9. 30 ha) in each of three forest districts (Siemianice, Zielonka and Złotów) were intensively sampled. Root collars were examined for <b>mycelial</b> <b>fans,</b> decayed wood, and rhizomorphs. Twenty two isolates of Armillaria ostoyae collected from epiphytic rhizomorphs from 20 living and two dead trees in the six infection centres were identified with somatic incompatibility group. Only one somatic incompatibility group for A. ostoyae was found. Twenty one isolates produced rhizomorphs on oak-wood discs submerged in a sand-forest soil substrate. Isolates from Siemianice formed the smallest rhizomorph networks and those from Złotów the most abundant. There were 16 different genets among 22 isolates of A. ostoyae distinguished by RAPD analysis. Genetic similarity among genets was 25. 6 – 97. 5 %. The large diversity in A. ostoyae suggests that sexual reproduction may occur in nature more often than expected...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1976 Root rot {{caused by}} Armillariella mellea creates roughly {{circular}} disease centers of infected dead and dying {{trees in the}} younggrowth ponderosa pine forest under study. Research objectives concerning chemical control of the disease were: 1) to test the effectiveness of certain chemicals in protecting living pines adjacent to disease centers from lethal attack at the root collar by A. mellea and 2) to test the effectiveness of chemical fumigants in eradicating A. mellea from infected stubs and snags of trees killed by the fungus within disease centers. The literature revealed the inadequacy of trenching, ringbarking, uprooting, and biological control involving antagonistic organisms in effectively controlling Armillaria root rot in the field, but control with persistent and highly volatile fungicides used as protectants and eradicants holds promise for controlling this disease. Among seven root collar protectant chemicals tested in vitro, benomyl and copper sulfate were most toxic to A. mellea while captan, copper metal, and iron sulfate were less toxic. Vorlex and chloropicrin were also highly effective in reducing the growth of A. mellea at the concentration tested. One of three isolates of A. mellea tested was more tolerant of the chemicals than the other isolates. Protectants tested on potted seedlings showed that captan significantly promoted A. mellea infection. Chloropicrin, Vortex, and high dosages of copper sulfate were phytotoxic to the pine seedlings. Viability of A. mellea within alder inoculum segments and production of rhizomorphs was also differentially affected by the applied chemicals. The A. mellea isolate least inhibited in vitro was significantly more pathogenic than the other isolates. The seven chemicals under test as root collar protectants in the forest showed no conclusive differences because disease severity was too low for evaluation of the treatments at this time. In a preliminary study of A. mellea distribution in unfumigated stumps, the fungus was most frequently isolated from yellow stringy decay and from sound appearing wood primarily within the taproot (lower portion) of the stump. <b>Mycelial</b> <b>fans</b> beneath the bark also frequently yielded A. mellea. A. mellea was most frequently isolated from stumps lacking visible decay in fresh transverse cuts at the ground line. Isolation frequency declined as the proportion of decay to sound wood on these cuts increased. Recovery was poorest in stumps which were barely intact. Five chemical fumigants were tested on stumps of ponderosa pine killed by A. mellea in typical disease centers. Methyl bromide, Vorlex, chloropicrin, carbon disulfide, and Vapam apparently eradicated A. mellea from the treated stumps. The hyphomycete, Trichoderma, appeared to be unaffected by fumigants other than methyl bromide and Vorlex. With these, Trichoderma incidence increased over the controls. Differences in the effectiveness of fumigation method {{and the influence of}} stump size or degree of decay could not be determined at the concentrations of fumigants used. Because of the apparent effectiveness of all fumigants tested, reductions in amounts and simplification of application should reduce costs of both materials and treatment, bringing costs into the realm of economic feasibility, at least in special cases. Fumigation of A. mellea in the infected root residues of disease centers should eliminate disease development at the epidemic level by reducing the inoculum potential. This change should enable further pine production in reasonable safety...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1975 Root rot of {{ponderosa pine}} caused by Armillaria mellea was studied in a pine forest {{that had been}} under {{management}} for 30 years in Klickitat County, Washington. Information sources included disease survey, detailed observation and description of specific disease situations, and examination of roots in situ and removed. Roughly circular infection centers in stands of sapling and pole-sized pines appear to arise regularly from stumps of harvested old-growth trees, {{some of which have}} contained viable A. mellea for over 30 years. Distinctive concentric zones caused by the disease mark the infection centers. These zones differ in above-ground appearance, in degree of root decomposition, and in level of infection. Location of a specific zone depends on the interval since cutting of the old-growth tree, while zone width depends on tree sizes in the young stand. Distribution of root material in the interior zones is influenced most strongly by rooting characteristics of the former old-growth trees, and by activity of A. mellea and other decay agents over time, while in the young growth pines of the intermediate zones, time since lethal attack by A. mellea and tree size most influence root condition. Extensive examination of the outer zones disclosed that, in stands containing trees from 3 to 6 inches in diameter, infected root material extended into the healthy-appearing pines 11 ft beyond the outermost dead tree of the infection center, while in stands with trees up to 16 inches in diameter the extent reached 18 ft. A highly significant linear regression with good correlation was found between: 1) the extent of infected root material beyond the outermost dead tree; and 2) mean tree size of the affected stand. Infected root segments from beyond the outermost dead tree, within the region where infected and healthy roots intermingle, produced rhizomorphs, the assumed infection structures, when incubated in bags of moist quartz sand. The expansion rate of infection centers was calculated to be 2. 9 ft (0. 88 m) /year. Cross plating techniques indicated that the 1500 acre study area was occupied by a single strain of A. mellea, suggesting that spores are unimportant to the field disease cycle. Current loss to disease in the 1500 acre tract is 35 cu ft per acre per yr, three times the loss in 1957. From 1957 to 1971, the proportion of the area in which disease was detectable remained constant. The increased loss resulted from death of fewer, but larger, trees in 1971. In inoculation tests on ponderosa pine seedlings, A. mellea isolates from old-growth pine stumps and from young pine trees were pathogenic, while isolates from living hardwoods were weakly or nonpathogenic. Reliable methods are described for isolating A. mellea from infected tissues and of testing the capacity of naturally infected root materials to produce rhizomorphs. The abundance of A. mellea over a three year interval following five root removal treatments increased in missed root residues. Resinous lesions were commonly found at the site of A. mellea attack. Rarely does mycelium spread proximally along a living root from one of these lesions, but growth frequently occurs from the lesion toward the root tip following, or concurrent with death of the extremity. Girdling resinous lesions on lateral roots show little effect on tree vigor, while such lesions high on the tap root kill the tree. Soon after tree death, <b>mycelial</b> <b>fans</b> spread under the bark throughout the root system. To obtain insight on how the resinous lesions retard the fungus, tests were conducted on the effects of resin on growth of A. mellea in culture. Autoclaved resin, acetone extracts of resin, water extracts of resin, and non-sterilized resin all stimulated, rather than restricted, growth over non-resin containing media. Removal of phenols from the water extract of resin with polyvinylpyrrolidone destroyed the growth stimulating effect of the resin. Propylene oxide was effective for sterilization of granulated resin...|$|R
