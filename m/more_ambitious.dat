5|$|After {{the turn}} of the 19th century, {{architecture}} developed into the late Baroque style. Among the major proponents were Johan Conrad Ernst who built the Chancery Building or Kancellibygningen (1721) on Slotsholmen and Lauritz de Thurah who designed the Eremitage Palace (1734) in Dyrehaven, just north of Copenhagen. Even <b>more</b> <b>ambitious</b> was de Thurah's work at Ledreborg near Roskilde, where he succeeded in working the components into a well-balanced and cohesive Baroque palace.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of Kaloyan's death, Strez was in the capital Tarnovo, perhaps seeking to {{capitalize}} on his ancestral rights to the Bulgarian crown. However, Boril {{proved to be the}} <b>more</b> <b>ambitious</b> candidate. Boril persecuted the other candidates for the throne, and Alexius Slav, along with Ivan Asen's sons Ivan Asen II had to leave Bulgaria.|$|E

50|$|Instead {{of active}} {{influence}} through others, {{there are also}} a number of self-help techniques that are marketed and sold with the promise to help the customer alter his or her mindset towards a better (<b>more</b> relaxed, <b>ambitious,</b> etc.) attitude through meditation, self-suggestion, etc.|$|R
5|$|Fleischmann and Weissmandl's rescue group, the Working Group, {{devised a}} <b>more</b> <b>ambitious</b> {{proposal}} in November that year. Known as the Europa plan or Grossplan, {{the aim was}} to bribe the SS with money from Jews overseas, primarily the United States, to stop the deportation of all Jews to Poland. Various sums have been mentioned in connection with this, including $2–3 million. Nothing came of it, reportedly because Heinrich Himmler intervened in August 1943.|$|E
5|$|For the Japanese, {{the loss}} of the Admiralties meant {{the loss of}} their outpost line in the South Eastern Area. Imperial Headquarters now ordered the {{preparation}} of a new line in Western New Guinea. The Admiralties operation also indicated the Allies were becoming <b>more</b> <b>ambitious</b> and might bypass Hansa Bay. Accordingly, the Eighteenth Army in New Guinea was ordered to prepare to defend Aitape and Wewak as well.|$|E
5|$|In 1858, the {{government}} lifted the licensing {{restrictions on the}} number of performers, and Offenbach was able to present <b>more</b> <b>ambitious</b> works. His first full-length operetta, Orphée aux enfers ("Orpheus in the Underworld"), was presented in October 1858. Offenbach, as usual, spent freely on the production, with scenery by Gustave Doré, lavish costumes, a cast of twenty principals, and a large chorus and orchestra.|$|E
25|$|Elsewhere, {{the music}} on Pirates is often cinematic, with {{influences}} ranging from Leonard Bernstein to Bruce Springsteen and Laura Nyro. The album is <b>more</b> musically <b>ambitious</b> than its predecessor, and explores elements of jazz, R, bebop, pop and Broadway, with multiple changes in tempo and mood within most songs.|$|R
25|$|One of Beuys' <b>more</b> {{famous and}} <b>ambitious</b> pieces of social {{sculpture}} was the 7000 Oaks project. The project was of enormous scope, {{and met with}} some controversy.|$|R
50|$|On its release, Is Survived By {{received}} favorable {{reviews from}} music critics, with a 87/100 from review aggregate metacritic indicating universal acclaim. Citing the album's mature and personal lyric and vocalist Jeremy Bolm {{performance as the}} album highlights, it also received praise for the <b>more</b> mature <b>ambitious</b> approach to the bands songwriting, noting the expanding song lengths and musical variation {{as a sign of}} Touché Amorés growth as musicians.|$|R
5|$|In 1973, Ray Davies dived {{headlong into}} the {{theatrical}} style, {{beginning with the}} rock opera Preservation, a sprawling chronicle of social revolution, and a <b>more</b> <b>ambitious</b> outgrowth of the earlier Village Green Preservation Society ethos. In conjunction with the Preservation project, the Kinks' line-up was expanded to include a horn section and female backup singers, essentially reconfiguring {{the group as a}} theatrical troupe.|$|E
5|$|NATO's leaders invited their Mediterranean Dialogue (MD) {{partners}} (Algeria, Egypt, Israel, Jordan, Mauritania, Morocco and Tunisia) {{to elevate}} the MD to a genuine partnership by establishing a <b>more</b> <b>ambitious</b> and expanded framework for cooperation. This cooperation would be guided by the principle of joint ownership and taking into consideration their particular interests and needs.|$|E
5|$|Rosenborg Castle in Copenhagen, {{also built}} by Christian IV, {{is another example}} of the Dutch Renaissance style. In 1606, the king first had a two-storey summerhouse built on a site he used as a park for relaxation. He then decided to start work on a much <b>more</b> <b>ambitious</b> building, the castle, which {{developed}} in stages until a Dutch Renaissance masterpiece was completed in 1624. Predating the castle, the Renaissance-style park, is Denmark's oldest royal garden.|$|E
50|$|In the mid-1960s, {{science fiction}} writers were {{becoming}} <b>more</b> literarily <b>ambitious.</b> Frederik Pohl, then editing three science fiction magazines, offered Silverberg carte blanche in writing for them. Thus inspired, Silverberg {{returned to the}} field that gave him his start, paying far more attention to depth of character development and social background than {{he had in the}} past and mixing in elements of the modernist literature he had studied at Columbia.|$|R
5000|$|Watt's first bibliographical {{publication}} was {{a catalogue}} (1812) {{of his own}} medical library. Bibliotheca Britannica was a much <b>more</b> extravagantly <b>ambitious</b> project: [...] "A General Index on the Literature of Great Britain and Ireland Ancient and Modern including Such Foreign Books as have been translated into English or printed in the British Dominions, as also a copious selection from {{the writings of the}} most distinguished authors of all ages and nations." ...|$|R

5|$|A Marvel One-Shot {{featuring}} Peggy Carter was in {{the works}} for some time before Atwell signed on to star in it, reprising her role from the Captain America films. D'Esposito, co-president of Marvel Studios and an executive producer on the feature films, aimed to replicate the period setting of Captain America: The First Avenger, while also giving the short a more modern, superhero feel. The film was a <b>more</b> <b>ambitious</b> production than previous One-Shots, with more action scenes and visual effects required than previously. Several other characters from Marvel Cinematic Universe films also appear, including Cooper reprising his role of Howard Stark.|$|E
5|$|After {{acquiring}} {{their own}} recording studio, the duo immediately {{started working on}} new material and assimilated themselves with music recording and studio equipment, as they sought to become <b>more</b> <b>ambitious</b> artists and less dependent on other producers. The two also became more accustomed to playing live, particularly Big Boi, and André 3000 significantly changed his lifestyle, as he adopted a more eccentric fashion sense, became a vegetarian, and stopped smoking marijuana. Having dropped out months before graduation, André 3000 also returned to high school to earn his diploma during the recording of ATLiens.|$|E
5|$|Barton {{has been}} {{described}} as having a good work ethic and the ability to carry the ball and retain possession for the team. He has been praised for having a good passing range. This aspect of his game has shown improvement since the 2005–06 season, when he began to favour simpler passes over <b>more</b> <b>ambitious</b> ones, and his relatively high pass completion rate can be attributed to this change. Barton's passes have often proved to be crucial; in the past he has led the way in his team's assists.|$|E
50|$|Type A and Type B {{personality}} theory describes two contrasting personality types. In this theory, personalities {{that are}} <b>more</b> competitive, outgoing, <b>ambitious,</b> impatient and/or aggressive are labeled Type A, while more relaxed personalities are labeled Type B.|$|R
25|$|The California Sound {{gradually}} {{evolved to}} reflect a <b>more</b> musically <b>ambitious</b> and mature world view, becoming {{less to do with}} surfing and cars and more about social consciousness and political awareness. Between 1964 and 1969, it fueled innovation and transition, inspiring artists to tackle largely unmentioned themes such as sexual freedom, black pride, drugs, oppositional politics, other countercultural motifs, and war. A derivative form of the California Sound was later classified as sunshine pop.|$|R
40|$|Pre {{teaching}} practice prepares {{prospective teachers}} through teaching practice {{which has an}} important role to get prior experience of teaching. When the student teachers begin their career with a high self-efficency on the classroom instruction and using the teaching methods, teaching aids they are <b>more</b> concerned, <b>ambitious</b> for their task and work harder. The {{purpose of this study is}} to find impact of pre teaching on student teachers in terms of teaching qualities...|$|R
5|$|Leclerc learnt a {{great deal}} about how to handle and supply a force {{advancing}} across the desert, and was rewarded with the British Distinguished Service Order. He began planning a far <b>more</b> <b>ambitious</b> advance into Libya. This was delayed by a year due to Generalfeldmarschall Erwin Rommel's defeat of the British Eighth Army in the Battle of Gazala, and the subsequent German and Italian advance into Egypt. Leclerc was promoted to Général de brigade in August 1941, and pinned two metal stars captured from the Italians on his kepi.|$|E
5|$|The GWR began {{experimenting with}} the {{electric}} lighting in 1880, leading to Paddington being decorated with Christmas lights that year. Although {{the system was}} unreliable, it spurred the GWR on to a <b>more</b> <b>ambitious</b> lighting scheme in 1886, in which a 145V AC supply could light the terminus, office, goods yard and Royal Oak and Westbourne Park stations. It was praised for its scale and showing that electricity could compete with gas lighting on the same scale.|$|E
5|$|The second barcarolle, {{dedicated}} to the pianist Marie Poitevin, is a longer and <b>more</b> <b>ambitious</b> work than the first, with what Morrison calls an Italianate profusion of detail. Duchen writes of the work as complex and questing, harmonically and melodically, {{and points to the}} influence of Saint-Saëns, Liszt and even, unusually for Fauré, of Wagner. The work opens in 6/8 time like the first, but Fauré varies the time signature to an unexpected 9/8 {{in the middle of the}} piece.|$|E

50|$|Many {{conservative}} Christians did {{not approve}} of a gospel music video being shot at a night club, citing that it was inappropriate. Mary Mary's next music video (Thank You feat. Kirk Franklin) was a less <b>ambitious,</b> <b>more</b> conservative music video.|$|R
5|$|The success {{led to a}} much <b>more</b> <b>ambitious</b> {{offensive}} operation named Polyarnaya Zvezda (Polar Star) {{less than}} two weeks later. That operation had the aim of decisively defeating Army Group North, lifting the siege altogether, but it achieved only minimal progress. Soviet forces made several other attempts in 1943 to renew their offensive and completely lift the siege, but made only modest gains in each one. The corridor remained in range of German artillery and the siege was only over on January 27, 1944.|$|E
5|$|XX Bomber Command {{conducted}} {{its first}} combat operation on 5June 1944. On this day 98 B-29s were dispatched from bases in India to attack targets in Bangkok, Thailand, as a 'dress rehearsal' for <b>more</b> <b>ambitious</b> operations against Japan and targets in South East Asia. Although little {{damage was done}} and five B-29s were lost due to flying accidents and technical faults, the operation was rated a success by XX Bomber Command as it provided useful combat experience for the bomber crews as well as data on how the B-29 performed in action.|$|E
5|$|A <b>more</b> <b>ambitious</b> plan by Butlin {{was thought}} up {{on a trip}} to the Bahamas in 1946. Seeing {{potential}} for a camp in warmer climes, he formed a company under the chairmanship of Sir Bede Edmund Hugh Clifford and bought land in Grand Bahama. Butlin also purchased the Princess hotel in Bermuda and the Fort Montagu beach hotel in Nassau. The camp was intended to be complete and open on New Years Day of 1950. After an investment of US$5 million (2011:£) the camp opened, still only partially complete, in the winter of 1949. To celebrate its opening, Butlin ran a mystery flight, where guests, who had paid $129 (2011:£) each, were taken on a flight to the resort without being informed in advance.|$|E
