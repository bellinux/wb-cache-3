This paper compares an ANN based approach with a conventional on-off control {{applied to the}} operation of a ground source heat pump/photovoltaic thermal system serving a single house located in Ottawa (Canada) for heating and cooling purposes. The hybrid renewable <b>microgeneration</b> <b>system</b> was investigated using the dynamic simulation software TRNSYS. A controller for predicting the future room temperature {{was developed in the}} MATLAB environment and six ANN control logics were analyzed. The comparison was performed in terms of ability to maintain the desired indoor comfort levels, primary energy consumption, operating costs and carbon dioxide equivalent emissions during a week of the heating period and a week of the cooling period. The results showed that the ANN approach is potentially able to alleviate the intensity of thermal discomfort associated with overheating/overcooling phenomena, but it could cause an increase in unmet comfort hours. The analysis also highlighted that the ANNs based strategies could reduce the primary energy consumption (up to around 36 %), the operating costs (up to around 81 %) as well as the carbon dioxide equivalent emissions (up to around 36 %) ...|$|E
40|$|Lead-acid {{batteries}} are a suitable technology for on site storage of microgenerated electricity. In this paper, an algorithm is developed that will assess, with an appropriate temporal resolution of data, {{the ability of}} lead-acid battery storage in capturing AC and DC power generated from photovoltaic cells, {{combined heat and power}} and wind turbines. The assessment includes the impact that the storage element has on the import and export of energy from the electrical grid and is a valuable tool in determining an optimum storage capacity. Used effectively, storage can increase the versatility of a <b>microgeneration</b> <b>system</b> by satisfying the highly variable electrical load of an individual dwelling, thus changing usage patterns on the national grid. Empirical electrical load demands are considered with a 1 min temporal resolution and compared with microgeneration (and battery) supply profiles with a similar temporal accuracy. The results show that, when producing on site electricity through microgeneration, suitably sized storage can reduce export substantially (by over 90 % in some cases) and store this energy at a typical round trip efficiency of 70 - 72 %. The developed model accounts for typical losses in a battery storage system, including that associated with inverters, power electronics and the efficiency of charge/discharge cycles...|$|E
40|$|The rising {{energy demand}} and the {{increased}} saving needs in building sector pushed {{in the last years}} the development of hybrid systems combining different energy sources, which can optimize available renewable resources, exceeding limitation deriving from each source. Research and market pay particular attention on questions resulting from integration of different systems and technical solutions, with the aim of maximizing their viability in terms of yielded energy and compatibility with planning and environmental regulations in any specific installation site. Funded by Italian Ministry of Environment (MATTM) and developed by Department of Architecture of University of Naples Federico II in partnership with two private companies, the research project TeCNaRE experimented a hybrid micro-generation system that exploits soil thermal inertia and wind energy, merging two renewable sources generally not combined. The hybrid renewable <b>microgeneration</b> <b>system</b> investigated in this study is a ground source heat pump which is co-powered by energy provided by a ground mounted micro-wind turbine, to meet the heating and cooling demand of a small building in urban area.

In this work the potential to supply electricity to a rural community in Kenya using PV-based communal grids is explored. Results show that for a properly sized system, gridding many solar <b>microgeneration</b> <b>systems</b> together leads to better power management, and thus efficiency, than when each system operates individually in a stand-alone configuration.

40|$|Existing {{models of}} {{microgeneration}} systems with integrated lead-acid battery storage are {{combined with a}} battery lifetime algorithm to evaluate and predict suitable sized lead-acid battery storage for onsite energy capture. Three onsite generation portfolios are considered: rooftop photovoltaic (2. 5 kW), micro-wind turbine (1. 5 kW) and micro {{combined heat and power}} (1 kW). With no embedded energy storage, the dwelling exports energy when the <b>microgeneration</b> <b>system</b> generates excess power leading to a high level of generated export throughout the year. The impact that the size of installed battery has on the proportion of the generated export that is reserved onsite, along with the annual energy discharged per year by the energy store is assessed. In addition, the lifetime algorithm is utilised to predict corresponding lifetimes for the different scenarios of onsite generation and storage size, with design tables developed for expected cost and weight of batteries given a predicted generated export and lifetime specification. The results can be used to indicate optimum size batteries for using storage with onsite generation for domestic applications. The model facilitates the choice of battery size to meet a particular criteria, whether that be optimising size, cost and lifetime, reducing grid export or attempting to be self-sufficient. Suitable battery sizes are found to have lifetimes of 2 - 4 years for high production microgeneration scenarios. However, this is also found to be highly variable, depending on chosen microgeneration scenario and battery size...|$|E
40|$|AbstractA rapid {{increase}} in household solar PV uptake has caused concerns regarding intermittent exports of electricity to the grid and related balancing problems. A <b>microgeneration</b> <b>system</b> combining solar PV, {{combined heat and power}} plant (CHP) and battery storage could potentially mitigate these problems whilst improving household energy self-sufficiency. This research examines if this could also lead to lower environmental impacts compared to conventional supply of electricity and heat. Life cycle assessment has been carried out for these purposes simulating daily and seasonal energy demand of different household types. The results suggest that the impacts are reduced by 35 – 100 % compared to electricity from the grid and heat from gas boilers. The exception is depletion of elements which is 42 times higher owing to the antimony used for battery manufacture. There is a large variation in impacts with household energy demand, with higher consumption resulting in a far greater reduction in impacts compared to the conventional supply. CHP inefficiency caused by user maloperation can decrease the environmental benefits of the system significantly; for example, the global warming potential increases by 17 %. This highlights the need for consumer information and training to ensure maximum environmental benefits of microgeneration. Appropriate battery sizing is essential with the 10 – 20 kWh batteries providing greatest environmental benefits. However, any reduction in impacts from battery storage is heavily dependent on the assumptions for system credits for electricity export to the grid. Effective management of the battery operation is also required to maximise the battery lifetime: a reduction from 10 to five years increases depletion of elements by 45 % and acidification by 32 %. Increasing the recycling of metals from 0 % to 100 % reduces the impacts from 46 % to 179 %. If 90 % of antimony is recycled, the depletion of elements is reduced by three times compared to the use of virgin antimony. However, this impact is still 12 times higher than for the conventional system owing to the use of other metals in the system...|$|E

A variety of commercial small wind turbines and photovoltaic (PV) panels are considered and combined with raw energy data gathered from a variety of locations. Both residential and holiday home user profiles are available and options are selectable concerning feed-in tariffs (if available), government incentive schemes and the cost of capital borrowing. The configuration of the generation setup, which can consist of wind, PV and combination of wind/PV, is fully selectable by the user, with a range of appropriate default data provided. A numerical example, based on Irish data, is presented, which suggests that payback periods for solar and wind <b>microgeneration</b> <b>systems</b> can vary greatly (2. 5 – 500 years), depending on the location, installation and economic variables...|$|R
40|$|Efficient use of {{electricity}} in every sector {{of a national}} economy is becoming increasingly significant. Energy efficiency concerns climate and energy policy, {{but it is also}} a significant factor influencing manufacturing costs for enterprises (and thus their profits), as well as socio-economic development. Irrational energy consumption leads to excessive consumption of primary energy sources, problems attributable to environment pollution, and limited competitiveness of national companies in global markets. For an individual consumer, energy efficiency is one of the key methods of reducing the share {{of electricity}} costs in the household budget. In recent years, the European Commission has made a lot of effort aimed at reducing electricity consumption in households, by promoting energy-saving lighting, subsidising renewable <b>microgeneration</b> <b>systems,</b> enforcing labelling appliances for their energy consumption and liberalisation of the electricity market, among other things.

40|$|As {{the world}} moves towards a more {{sustainable}} development, the energy coming from fossil fuels still produces the greenhouse gases that threaten the world’s climate. The UK government has established {{targets for the}} penetration of renewable energy generation and low-carbon alternatives for the electricity production. One of these technologies is microgeneration. In 2006, the UK government launched the Microgeneration Strategy pushing forward micro and small-scale generation as a supplementary source of energy for the country’s growing electricity demand. The proposal is focused on several technologies, including micro-wind and micro-PV, among others. These microgeneration technologies are now a reality and widespread across the distribution networks. Therefore, {{the analysis of the}} impact of these systems connected to distribution grids and the benefits of these technologies, alongside with their negative effects on the network is an important research area. Correct modelling of micro and small-scale renewablebased generation technologies implemented in urban areas, however, is not a simple task, as it requires an adequate representation of highly dispersed and uncontrolled generation systems. These systems are small in size, but high in numbers and usually experience large variations in available renewable energy inputs. This thesis presents aggregate models of urban micro and small-scale PV and wind generation systems, which are connected to low-voltage networks. The thesis analyses impact of urban PV and wind generation on the steady-state network performance (power flows and voltage profiles), taking into account variability of energy inputs. The presented analysis is of particular importance for the analysis of the future of power system supplies, which will have significantly higher penetration levels of renewable-based distributed generation technologies, resulting in a much wider range of interactions between <b>microgeneration</b> <b>systems,</b> loads and transmission/distribution networks. In order to perform this analysis, the resource assessment for urban areas has to be carried out to both quantify the potential for each technology and help in their modelling. This has been a challenge since the aggregation of <b>microgeneration</b> <b>systems</b> is far from simple, as the parameters, performance and size varies between different technologies. A solution presented in this thesis is an approach for simple yet accurate aggregation of microgeneration technologies. This approach allows to quantify and analyse their impact and effect on the power supply systems directly in terms of penetration levels and general technology characteristics...|$|R
40|$|Development of {{electricity}} delivery infrastructures are path-dependent, meaning, each development decision and step affects subsequent steps, {{and the final}} outcome. Human actors are therefore the most important variables in any energy development plan as their decisions affect the way a system evolves. Proper policy-planning tools are therefore required to guide decision-makers on least-cost rural electrification topologies. Many factors influence choices of technologies used in rural electrification, the main ones being availability of resources, availability of necessary technical infrastructures, demand, investment costs, and local socio-political and cultural environments. Different modelling tools and techniques have been applied in planning rural electrification paths in many developing countries. However, these often view this problem as a question of expansion of grid coverage through extensions of existing transmission and distribution lines from central power generation stations and seldom address the unique and regionally-specific challenges presented by each developing nation. To {{the best of our}} knowledge, no work has captured, in one study, the unique socio-economic, cultural and political environments, and market and technical infrastructural challenges presented by different rural communities in developing nations. In this work decentralized power systems based on locally available renewable energy resources, in this case solar, are explored as cost-effective electrification alternatives to national utility grid extensions to rural developing communities. An agent-based model (ABM) is developed in Netlogo to provide decision-makers with a user-friendly tool for PV-based rural electrification policy development, planning, and implementation. The model takes into account the complexities and limitations of solar electricity microgeneration technologies, decisions by human actors, geographical factors, and interactions between the three factors in order to capture the overall macro-effects of different micro-decisions in a virtual world; ABMs seek to model individual entities within a complex system and the rules that govern the interactions of the entities within the system, to capture the overall effect of such interactions. The novelty of the model developed in this work is that it simultaneously simulates how technical, socio-economic, and political factors affect temporal diffusion of PV <b>microgeneration</b> <b>systems</b> in a typical rural developing community. The model further simulates how households with PV, driven by demand for more power and other factors, come together to form communal grids. Survey data from Kendu Bay area of Kenya are used to inform the model. Empirical data provided by the Kenyan government are used to validate the model. The model developed in this work could be used by developing nations in their rural electrification planning and implementations, and a test-implementation funded by the Kenyan government is currently underway. Results show that given various electrification options, households in rural developing communities would overwhelmingly choose small PV <b>microgeneration</b> <b>systems</b> as stepping stones to future grid electrification. This is mainly due to initial basic electricity needs, rapidly falling PV costs, and affordability of such small PV systems; these small PV <b>microgeneration</b> <b>systems</b> allow households to enjoy the benefits {{of electricity}} with modest investments while also allowing future modifications with increasing household incomes, increasing power demands, and changing technologies. Another key finding of this research is that as their power demands increase beyond what could be fulfilled by small stand-alone PV systems, most rural households opt for PV-based communal grids as opposed to connecting to the national grids due to low cost, control over a community’s own power source, increased reliability and availability, and security of power source. Results also show that increased PV installations, and correspondingly more connections to communal grids, could be realized with introduction of favourable government policies such as subsidies, introduction of favourable microcredit facilities, increased social pressure through advertisements and neighbourhood influence. Furthermore, results indicate that, based on control methods and architectures, start-up and maintenance and operations costs of communal grids could be minimized and thus become more attractive to would be consumers, compared to the national grids. ...|$|R
40|$|Microgeneration {{technologies}} are positioned to address future building {{energy efficiency requirements}} and facilitate the integration of renewables into buildings to ensure a sustainable, energy-secure future. This paper explores {{the development of a}} robust multi-input multi-output (MIMO) controller applicable to the control of hybrid renewable <b>microgeneration</b> <b>systems</b> with the objective of minimising the electrical grid utilisation of a building while fulfilling the thermal demands. The controller employs the inverse dynamics of the building, servicing systems, and energy storage with a robust control methodology. These inverse dynamics provides the control system with knowledge of the complex cause and effect relationships between the system, the controlled inputs, and the external disturbances, while an outer-loop control ensures robust, stable control in the presence of modelling deficiencies/uncertainty and unknown disturbances. Variable structure control compensates for the physical limitations of the systems whereby the control strategy employed switches depending on the current utilisation and availability of the energy supplies. Preliminary results presented for a system consisting of a micro-CHP unit, solar PV, and battery storage indicate that the control strategy is effective in minimising the interaction with the local electrical network and maximising the utilisation of the available renewable energy...|$|R
40|$|Over {{the last}} few decades, {{developments}} in technology have incrementally refined the way energy is produced and delivered to customers. But in fundamental ways the energy system remains {{much as it was}} in the 1950 s. Nuclear reactor technology has the potential to create a paradigm shift in the electric-generation sector, but because of public concerns about reactor safety and waste disposal, its promise has not been fully realized. Today technology development supported by government and the private sector that has been under way for decades has begun to yield <b>microgeneration</b> <b>systems</b> that are now available commercially and are beginning to penetrate energy markets. The emergence of microgeneration technologies could lead to paradigm shifts in two key elements of the energy delivery system: distributed generation and hydrogen systems. Distributed Generation. Based on a number of newly commercial technologies for power generation, such as fuel cells, as well as substantial refinements in traditional, engine-based systems, we can now envisage an electric system in which power is generated very close to the load being served; the generators will be several orders of magnitude smaller (i. e., 10 to 1, 000 kW) than traditional utility generation stations of 100 to 1, 000 MW.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an exploratory analysis of microgeneration installer {{businesses in the}} UK {{during a period of}} intense change in policies supporting microgeneration from 2010 to 2012. The research examines the influence of installer businesses on rates of uptake and standards of installation, and the interplay between business practices and the policy environment. The research developed new detailed datasets through a nationwide survey, to which 388 installers responded, and follow-up interviews with 22 installers. Focusing on solar photovoltaics and air source heat pumps installed in households, the results show the fundamental dependence of installer businesses on government financial incentives and on the quality assurance scheme in operation. Market confidence was compromised by the sharp reduction in the Feed-In Tariff (FIT) for residential solar PV in 2012 and long delays to the equivalent Renewable Heat Incentive for residential installations. Nevertheless, more modest FIT levels have reduced the risk of sub-optimal installations and inappropriate specification of <b>microgeneration</b> <b>systems.</b> The findings underline the need for consistent policy to allow installer businesses and their supply chains to develop and mature, and thus facilitate commercial deployment of microgeneration of high quality, raise its competiveness with incumbent forms of energy supply and contribute to decarbonisation goals...|$|R

These systems are generally suitable for the recovery of low grade heat at low pressure this is a major advantage of the system in terms of safety and management.

40|$|You {{only have}} to take a look around to realize how slow is the process through which the {{building}} trade meets the transformation of human demands. Maybe because of its close relation with primary and unchanged needs, such as resting, feeding, and in general carrying on life’s basic activities into a controlled environment. But despite this all, or probably because of it, our houses don’t seem so far from our ancestors’ dwellings. And still our lifestyle is extremely different from theirs, as well as diverse are the services available for our personal comfort. Many of the several elements characterising contemporary age (heating systems, plumbing, building materials, etc.) have been introduced somehow secretly, have been hidden, or have been camouflaged with ancient or traditional shapes. Maybe the new distributed <b>microgeneration</b> <b>systems</b> – small-scaled power plants to be placed on the territory nearby the consuming structures - will be the next intruders? On the one hand this approach to the energetic problem certainly seems to be promising because of its implied reduction of the use of non-renewable sources. But on the other hand, doesn’t it take the risk of clashing – with paralysing consequences - with the issues of landscape preservation? Or with the many troubles descending by the attempts of integration between new materials and “languages” and our well-established building traditions? Or simply with the dullness of certain urban planning law systems? This Doctorate thesis (in progress) deals with the issue of distributed microgeneration trying to point out its actual potential of application and diffusion, explaining both its weak points and the possible ways of relating with the existing built environment. The main questions this work is trying to answer, and according to which the future possible scenarios will develop, are the following: What is implied by the shifting from an energy distribution system organised in big poles, with the built environment as a terminal, to a system composed of a network of minor poles, each one consumer and producer at the same time? How will the technologies’ choice be determined? How wide will be the influence on urban fabric and building typologies? How will the most evident elements be integrated, and what can be meant by “integration”? Will the urban-scape change? Will these systems be able to nourish the architectural language of post-oil era?

40|$|The {{continuous}} {{advances in}} integrated circuit fabrication technologies, circuit design, and networking techniques enable {{the integration of}} an in-creasing number of functionalities in ever smaller devices. This trend de-termines the multiplication of possible application scenarios for tiny em-bedded systems such as wireless sensors, whose utilization has grown more and more pervasive. However, the operating life time of such sys-tems, when placed in locations not allowing a wired connection to a de-pendable power supply infrastructure, is still heavily limited by the finite capacity of currently available accumulators, whose technology has not improved at the same pace of the electronic systems they supply. Energy harvesting techniques constitute a real solution to power un-tethered computing platforms {{in this kind of}} spatially-distributed applica-tions. By converting part of the energy freely available in the surrounding environment to electrical energy, the operating life of the system can be extended considerably, potentially for an unlimited time. In recent years an increasing number of researchers have investigated this possibility. In this dissertation we discuss our results about the study and design of systems capable of harvesting energy from various regenerative sources. We start with the design of an airflow energy harvester, focusing on the optimization of its power generation and efficiency performances, and obtaining superior results with respect to similar works in literature. Then we deal with the improvement of this architecture to implement a fully autonomous vibrational harvester, featuring uncommon in-the-field configuration capabilities. Afterwards we investigate the applicability of self-powered wireless sensor nodes to heavy duty and agricultural machinery, finding attractive vibration sources capable of providing enough power to sustain remarkable data transmission rates. To address remote monitoring applications with stringent needs in terms of power supply availability, we present a truly flexible multi-source energy harvester, along with a simulation framework expressly developed to anticipate the harvester performance when placed in a specific operating environment. Furthermore, the design strategies allowing energy harvesters to fully exploit the locally generated power can be profitably applied in the field of distributed electricity generation from renewable energy sources, to enhance the self-consumption capabilities of <b>microgeneration</b> <b>systems.</b> Based on this motivation, we finally propose a grid-assisted photovoltaic power supply to improve the self-sustainability of ground-source heat pumps, and analyze original data on the consumption profiles of these systems to assess the effectiveness of the design. Energy harvesting techniques have the potential to enable many cut-ting-edge applications, especially in remote sensing and pervasive computing areas, which can bring innovations in several fields of human activity.

However, incorporating a substantial volume of <b>microgeneration</b> within a <b>system</b> that is not designed for such a paradigm could lead to conflicts in the operating strategies of the new and existing centralised generation technologies. So it becomes vital for such substantial amount of microgeneration among other decentralised resources to be controlled in the way that local constraints are mitigated and their aggregated response supports the wider system. In addition, the characteristic behaviour of connected microgeneration requires to be understood under different system conditions to ascertain measures of risk and resilience, and to ensure the benefits of microgeneration to be delivered. Therefore, this thesis provides three main valuable contributions of future attainment of sustainable power systems. Firstly, a new conceptual control structure for a system incorporating a high penetration of microgeneration and dynamic load is developed. Secondly, the resilience level of the host distribution network as well as the resilience levels of microgeneration during large transient disturbances is evaluated and quantified. Thirdly, a technical solution that can support enhanced transient stability of a large penetration of LV connected microgeneration is introduced and demonstrated. A control system structure concept based on “a cell concept” is introduced to manage the spread of heavy volumes of distributed energy resources (DERs) including microgeneration such that the useful features of DER units in support of the wider system can be exploited, and the threats to system performance presented by significant connection of passive and unpredictable DERs can be mitigated. The structure also provides simpler and better coordinated communication with DERs by allowing the inputs from DERs and groups of cells to be transferred as collective actions when it moves from a local to a wider system level. The anticipated transient performance problems surrounding the integration of microgeneration on a large basis within a typical urban distribution network are addressed. Three areas of studies are tackled; the increased fault level due to the present of microgeneration, the collective impact of LV connected microgeneration on traditional LV protection performance, and the system fault ride through capabilities of LV connected microgeneration interfaced by different technologies. The possible local impacts of unnecessary disconnection of large amount of microgeneration on the performance of the host distribution network are also quantified. The thesis proposes a network solution based on using resistive-type superconducting fault current limiters (RSFCLs) to prevent the impact of local transient disturbances from expanding and enhance the fault ride through capabilities of a high penetration of microgeneration connected to low voltage distribution networks. A new mathematical approach is developed within the thesis to identify at which condition RSFCL {{can be used as a}} significant device to maintain the transient stability of large numbers of LV connected microgeneration. The approach is based on equation solution to determine the minimum required value of the resistive element of RSFCL to maintain microgeneration transient stability, and at the same time additional headroom against switchgear short-circuit ratings is provided. Remote disturbances or a failure to clear remote faults quickly are shown to no longer result in complete unnecessary disconnection of substantial amount of microgeneration...|$|R
