25|$|Persephone ("Sephy") Hadley is a cross, {{with dark}} skin, and the {{daughter}} of a wealthy senior politician, Kamal. Callum McGregor is a nought, with light skin. They used to play together when Jasmine, Sephy's mother, employed Meggie, Callum's mother, as a nanny. However, Jasmine fires Meggie for being unable to provide an alibi for Jasmine when Kamal confronts Jasmine's about his suspicions of her infidelity: that is only strongly suggested for now but is made explicit later. Since then, Sephy and Callum's friendship has been secret. As best friends, their relationship is frowned upon by society, like interracial friendships in the Southern United States before the Civil Rights Movement but in reverse, as dark skin is considered <b>much</b> <b>better</b> <b>to</b> have than light skin.|$|E

500|$|In {{a speech}} given when she {{unveiled}} the design in January 1948, Ross indicated {{that she had}} been urged to put Franklin on the cent because of his association with the adage [...] "a penny saved is a penny earned" [...] (in Franklin's original, [...] "A penny saved is twopence dear".) [...] Ross stated, [...] "You will agree, I believe, that the fifty-cent piece, being larger and of silver, lends itself <b>much</b> <b>better</b> <b>to</b> the production of an impressive effect." [...] On April 29, 1948, the day before the coin's public release, Ross held a dinner party for 200 at the Franklin Institute in Philadelphia; each guest received a Franklin half dollar in a card signed by Ross.|$|E

500|$|DJ Diplo {{introduced}} {{elements of}} Brazilian baile funk to [...] "Bucky Done Gun". Fellow composer-producer Richard X {{worked on the}} track [...] "Hombre", which featured a drum pattern created from the sounds made by toys that M.I.A. had bought in India, augmented with sounds produced by objects such as pens and mobile phones. Steve Mackey and Ross Orton, known professionally as Cavemen, worked on [...] "Galang", which M.I.A. had initially produced with her 505 and a basic four-track tape recorder. Working with Cavemen in a professional studio, she added a bass line and new vocals to give the song [...] "a more analogue sound" [...] than was possible with the 505. The track was co-written by Frischmann, whose input M.I.A. described as [...] "refreshing". She initially hoped to feature guest vocalists on the album, but was unable due to budget constraints and other artists' unfamiliarity with her work. She chose to perform all the vocals herself, saying, [...] "I just quietly got on with it... I didn't wanna convince anyone it was good. I felt it was <b>much</b> <b>better</b> <b>to</b> prove that I could be an individual." ...|$|E
500|$|The ONA outline {{their views}} on human {{sacrifice}} {{in a number of}} documents: [...] "A Gift for the Prince [...] A Guide to Human Sacrifice", [...] "Culling [...] A Guide to Sacrifice II", [...] "Victims [...] A Sinister Exposé", and [...] "Guidelines for the Testing of Opfers". According to the ONA's beliefs, the killer must allow their victim to [...] "self-select" [...] themselves; this is achieved through testing the victim to see if they expose perceived character faults. If this proves to be the case, the victim is believed to have shown that they are worthy of death, and the sacrifice can commence. Those deemed ideal for sacrifice by the group include individuals perceived as being of low character, members of what they deem [...] "sham-Satanic groups" [...] like the Church of Satan and Temple of Set, as well as [...] "zealous, interfering Nazarenes", and journalists, business figures and political activists who disrupt the group's operations. The ONA explains that because of the need for such [...] "self-selection", children must never be victims of sacrifice. Similarly, the ONA [...] "despise animal sacrifice, maintaining that it is <b>much</b> <b>better</b> <b>to</b> sacrifice suitable mundanes given the abundance of human dross".|$|E
500|$|During 1931, NSS {{was busy}} closing shipyards {{elsewhere}} in the country, while an order from the Admiralty for two destroyers kept Palmer's working until mid-1932. The second of these ships, , was the last ship launched from the yard, on 19 July 1932. [...] By this time, Palmer's was insolvent, but retained a faint hope of further naval contracts. These failed to materialise, and in June 1933 the firm's creditors appointed a receiver. By December 1933 rumours of NSS interest in the yard were appearing in the press, and in the House of Commons Walter Runciman, the President of the Board of Trade, told members: [...] "There {{is nothing to be}} gained by giving Jarrow the impression that Palmer's can be revived". He continued: [...] "Would it not be very <b>much</b> <b>better</b> <b>to</b> make a clean sweep of that as a shipyard, and throw open to the world for sale what is one of the finest and most convenient sites anywhere in Europe?" [...] Despite efforts by management and workers to find an alternative solution, in the early summer of 1934 NSS acquired the yard, closed it, and began to dismantle its plant. Blythe wrote: [...] "The only sound to compete with the unfamiliar noise of the marsh birds... was the ring of the breakers' hammers." ...|$|E

2500|$|Larry Sabato of the University of Virginia {{said that}} it [...] "was a serious speech about the {{incendiary}} topic of race in America." [...] Sabato noted that a debate about race was [...] "inevitable" [...] in the campaign and that [...] "from Obama's perspective, it's <b>much</b> <b>better</b> <b>to</b> have this discussion now", rather than shortly before the November election (assuming he captured the Democratic nomination).|$|E
2500|$|Sky high {{salaries}} {{also changed}} {{many of the}} strategies of the game. Players rarely were [...] "sent" [...] down to the minors if they failed to perform. Who could justify paying a slumping player millions to sit in Toledo where the major league fans couldn't pay their way? Other players in the Triple-A level of the minor leagues, who used to rise on merit, became trapped under these overpaid [...] "stars." [...] Also, {{in order to make}} the media happy, trades, rather than call-ups, became the order of the day. It was <b>much</b> <b>better</b> <b>to</b> buy someone else's shortstop who was a known quantity to the national sports media than to take a chance on a player with no name value and no visibility if you were in a major market ballclub.|$|E

If the Great Spirit wanted men to stay in one place he would make the world stand still; but he made it to always change, so bird and animals can move and always have green grass and ripe berries, sunlight to work and play, and night to sleep; summer for flowers to bloom, and winter for them to sleep; always changing; everything for good; nothing for nothing." ...|$|E
2500|$|Carolyn Van Wyck wrote {{a column}} for Photoplay, an {{upmarket}} magazine that featured articles on pop culture, advice on fashion, and even articles on helping readers channel their inner celebrity. In March 1926 an anonymous young woman wrote in describing petting as a problem, explaining [...] "The boys all seem {{to do it and}} don't seem to come back if you don't do it also. We girls are at our wits' end to know what to do. ... I'm sure that I don't want to marry anyone who is too slow to want to pet. But I want to discover what is right. Please help me." [...] Van Wyck sympathized with the problem the writer faced and added, [...] "It seems to me <b>much</b> <b>better</b> <b>to</b> be known as a flat tire and keep romance in one's mind than to be called a hot date and have fear in one's heart." ...|$|E
2500|$|A {{historical}} note is necessary. The {{idea that}} the Schottky-Nordheim barrier needed a correction factor, as in eq. (9), was introduced by Nordheim in 1928, but his mathematical analysis of the factor was incorrect. A new (correct) function was introduced by Burgess, Kroemer and Houston in 1953, and its mathematics was developed further by Murphy and Good in 1956. This corrected function, sometimes known as a [...] "special field emission elliptic function", was expressed {{as a function of}} a mathematical variable y known as the [...] "Nordheim parameter". Only recently (2006 to 2008) has it been realized that, mathematically, it is <b>much</b> <b>better</b> <b>to</b> use the variable ℓ [...] And only recently has it been possible to complete the definition of ν(ℓ) by developing and proving the validity of an exact series expansion for this function (by starting from known special-case solutions of the Gauss hypergeometric differential equation). Also, approximation (11) has been found only recently. Approximation (11) outperforms, and will presumably eventually displace, all older approximations of equivalent complexity. These recent developments, and their implications, will probably {{have a significant impact on}} field emission research in due course.|$|E
