The Old Court party augmented their <b>majority</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> House and gained a <b>majority</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Senate. One legislator's proposition to resolve the controversy was to call for the resignation of the governor and lieutenant governor, the entire General Assembly, as well as the justices from both the Old and New Courts, essentially allowing the state to reset its entire government. This extreme measure was rejected. Instead, on December 29, 1826, the General Assembly repealed the reorganization act, and overrode Governor Desha's veto of the measure. They also repealed the replevin law that had touched off the controversy. On January 1, 1827, Francis Blair returned the court records in his possession to the Old Court.|$|E

40|$|The {{hypothesis}} of divided government {{is applied to}} the development of deficits <b>in</b> Germany. Since <b>the</b> party system is relatively stable, divided governments emerge not from coalitional governments, but rather from the bicameral structure of <b>the</b> country. Different <b>majorities</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> two chambers promote deficits, especially <b>in</b> <b>the</b> case of central government deficits. The results suggest that under different <b>majorities</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> two chambers deficits are more than 0. 5 %-Point higher. Further, it is indicated, that only ideological polarization, but not unstable majorities per se induces higher deficits.
