5|$|Despite his mixed legacy, Sargsyan is {{now widely}} {{recognized}} as a national hero {{across the political spectrum}} and by the public. Given the honorific Sparapet, he <b>made</b> <b>significant</b> <b>contributions</b> <b>to</b> the establishment of Armenia as independent state and ensuring its security as the founder of the Armenian Army. He has also been criticized by human rights organizations for being undemocratic, especially for his role in elections.

5|$|Gould <b>made</b> <b>significant</b> <b>contributions</b> <b>to</b> {{evolutionary}} developmental biology, {{especially in}} his work Ontogeny and Phylogeny. In this book he emphasized the process of heterochrony, which encompasses two distinct processes: neoteny and terminal additions. Neoteny is the process where ontogeny is slowed down and the organism does not {{reach the end of}} its development. Terminal addition is the process by which an organism adds to its development by speeding and shortening earlier stages in the developmental process. Gould's influence in the field of evolutionary developmental biology continues to be seen today in areas such as the evolution of feathers.|$|E

5|$|The CPS men served without {{wages and}} minimal {{support from the}} federal government. The cost of {{maintaining}} the CPS camps and providing {{for the needs of}} the men was the responsibility of their congregations and families. CPS men served longer than regular draftees and were not released until well {{after the end of the}} war. Initially skeptical of the program, government agencies learned to appreciate the men's service and requested more workers from the program. CPS <b>made</b> <b>significant</b> <b>contributions</b> <b>to</b> forest fire prevention, erosion and flood control, medical science and reform of the mental health system.|$|E
5|$|Burnet <b>made</b> <b>significant</b> <b>contributions</b> <b>to</b> {{influenza}} research; {{he developed}} techniques {{to grow and}} study the virus, including hemagglutination assays. He worked on a live vaccine against influenza, but the vaccine was unsuccessful when tested during World War II. His interest in the influenza receptor led him to discover the neuraminidase that is secreted by Vibrio cholerae, which later provided the foundation for Alfred Gottschalk's significant work on glycoproteins and the neuraminidase substrate, sialic acid. Between 1951 and 1956, Burnet worked on the genetics of influenza. He examined the genetic control of virulence and demonstrated that the virus recombined at high frequency; this observation was not fully appreciated until several years later, when the segmented genome of influenza was demonstrated.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to its scientific results, Hubble has also <b>made</b> <b>significant</b> <b>contributions</b> <b>to</b> aerospace engineering, in particular the performance of systems in low Earth orbit. These insights result from Hubble's long lifetime on orbit, extensive instrumentation, and return of assemblies to the Earth {{where they can be}} studied in detail. In particular, Hubble has contributed to studies of the behavior of graphite composite structures in vacuum, optical contamination from residual gas and human servicing, radiation damage to electronics and sensors, and the long term behavior of multi-layer insulation. One lesson learned was that gyros assembled using pressurized oxygen to deliver suspension fluid were prone to failure due to electric wire corrosion. Gyros are now assembled using pressurized nitrogen.|$|E

The school was established on September 9, 1944 as the Flight Test Training Unit at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base (AFB) in Dayton, Ohio. To {{take advantage of the}} uncongested skies and superb flying weather, the school was moved on February 4, 1951 to its present location at Edwards Air Force Base in the Mojave Desert of Southern California. Edwards AFB is the home of the Air Force Flight Test Center and has been an integral part of flight testing for over fifty years.|$|E
5|$|Von Neumann's {{results have}} been viewed as a special case of linear programming, where von Neumann's model uses only nonnegative matrices. The study of von Neumann's model of an {{expanding}} economy continues to interest mathematical economists with interests in computational economics. This paper {{has been called the}} greatest paper in mathematical economics by several authors, who recognized its introduction of fixed-point theorems, linear inequalities, complementary slackness, and saddlepoint duality. In the proceedings of a conference on von Neumann's growth model, Paul Samuelson said that many mathematicians had developed methods useful to economists, but that von Neumann was unique in having <b>made</b> <b>significant</b> <b>contributions</b> <b>to</b> economic theory itself.|$|E

5|$|Originally, {{the goal}} of the Wall of Fame was to induct the {{greatest}} players in Phillies and Athletics history; however, exceptions have been made for non-players who have <b>made</b> <b>significant</b> <b>contributions</b> <b>to</b> the organization. Mack, the Athletics' first inductee, had an 11-year playing career in the National League and the Players' League, but is most remembered for his managerial career, and was honored as such on the Wall. Members have been inducted for contributions in more than one area; Paul Owens, inducted in 1988, spent 48 years {{as a member of the}} Phillies organization, contributing as a scout, manager, general manager, and team executive. The Phillies have inducted four first basemen, four second basemen, five third basemen, three shortstops, one utility infielder, three catchers, 21 outfielders, 18 pitchers, seven managers, one general manager, one coach, two team executives, and two sportscasters. Twenty-one members of the Wall of Fame are also members of the Baseball Hall of Fame.

5|$|Longstreet's talents as {{a general}} <b>made</b> <b>significant</b> <b>contributions</b> <b>to</b> several {{important}} Confederate victories, mostly in the Eastern Theater as one of Robert E. Lee's chief subordinates in the Army of Northern Virginia. He performed poorly at Seven Pines, but {{played an important role}} in the success of the Seven Days Battles in the summer of 1862. Longstreet led a devastating counterattack that routed the Union army at Second Bull Run in August. His men held their ground in defensive roles at Antietam and Fredericksburg. Longstreet's most controversial service was at the Battle of Gettysburg in July 1863, where he openly disagreed with General Lee on the tactics to be employed and reluctantly supervised several attacks on Union forces, including the disastrous Pickett's Charge. Afterwards, Longstreet was, at his own request, sent to the Western Theater to fight under Braxton Bragg, where his troops launched a ferocious assault on the Union lines at Chickamauga, which carried the day. Afterwards, his performance in semiautonomous command during the Knoxville Campaign resulted in a Confederate defeat. Unhappy serving under Bragg, Longstreet and his men were sent back to Lee. He ably commanded troops during the Battle of the Wilderness in 1864, where he was seriously wounded by friendly fire. He later returned to the field, serving under Lee in the Siege of Petersburg and the Appomattox Campaign.|$|E
