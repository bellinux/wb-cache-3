5|$|The train {{stopped at}} a station that had no town, and {{a short while later}} it passed the only banana {{plantation}} along the route that had its name written over the gate: Macondo. This word had attracted my attention ever since the first trips I had made with my grandfather, but I discovered only as an adult that I liked its poetic resonance. I never heard anyone say it and did not even ask <b>myself</b> <b>what</b> it meant...I happened to read in an encyclopedia that it is a tropical tree resembling the Ceiba.|$|E
25|$|I {{put before}} the whole House my own views with an appalling frankness. From 1933, I {{and my friends}} were all very worried about what was {{happening}} in Europe. You will remember at that time the Disarmament Conference was sitting in Geneva. You will remember at that time there was probably a stronger pacifist feeling running through the country {{than at any time since}} the War. I am speaking of 1933 and 1934. You will remember the election at Fulham in the autumn of 1933...That was the feeling of the country in 1933. My position as a leader of a great party was not altogether a comfortable one. I asked <b>myself</b> <b>what</b> chance was there...within the next year or two of that feeling being so changed that the country would give a mandate for rearmament? Supposing I had gone to the country and said that Germany was rearming and we must rearm, does anybody think that this pacific democracy would have rallied to that cry at that moment! I cannot think of anything that would have made the loss of the election from my point of view more certain...We got from the country – with a large majority – a mandate for doing a thing that no one, twelve months before, would have believed possible.|$|E
500|$|In 1979, de Lucía, John McLaughlin, and Larry Coryell formed The Guitar Trio and {{together}} made {{a tour of}} Europe and released a video recorded at London's Royal Albert Hall entitled Meeting of the Spirits. Pohren said that de Lucía's decision to work with musicians like McLaughlin, Di Meola, Coryell, and Chick Corea {{must have been an}} [...] "exciting and stimulating" [...] experience for him, given their technical musical knowledge and ability to improvise and said that they carried him [...] "so far afield that at times he must have been profoundly confused, a man running the risk of losing his musical identity." [...] This concerned de Lucía, who said in a late 1990s interview, [...] "I have never lost the roots in my music, because I would lose <b>myself.</b> <b>What</b> I have tried to do is have a hand holding onto tradition and the other scratching, digging in other places, trying to find new things I can bring into flamenco." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{concept of}} a {{contract}} or covenant with God is fundamental to the Jewish religion. [...] The idea that God must uphold {{his end of the}} first commandment has been a subject of works such as Elie Wiesel's play The Trial of God (1979), made in response to the atrocities Wiesel witnessed at Auschwitz. [...] To art historian Matthew Baigell, Hershe's angst regarding his relationship with God is a modern response to the questions of Hillel the Elder's quoted in the Pirkei Avot: [...] "If I am not for myself, who will be for me? [...] But if I am only for <b>myself,</b> <b>what</b> am I? [...] And if not now, when?" [...] Literary scholar Susanne Klingenstein found Hersh's character unrealistic from the view of Jewish scholarship. [...] She wrote that [...] "the suffering of the righteous" [...] is [...] "one of the greatest problems in Jewish thought", and that a character as devoutly religious as Hersh would not have struggled with what she saw as elementary Jewish teaching.|$|E
500|$|The Nightfly is more unapologetically jazzy than Fagen's {{previous}} work with Steely Dan, and his lyrics are more wistful and nostalgic than biting. Fagen aimed for his lyrics to have [...] "as little irony as possible," [...] and {{his goal was}} to make an album that was fun to listen to. As many of the songs come from an adolescent viewpoint, he hoped for them to maintain [...] "a certain innocence." [...] Walter Becker was responsible for the more sardonic elements in Steely Dan, and many writers have considered his absence the reason for the album's [...] "warm and nostalgic" [...] tone. Another difference between The Nightfly and his work with Becker is that it maintains a focus on a [...] "certain period [...] motif," [...] according to Fagen. Though Fagen hints in the album's liner notes that it is an autobiographical piece, he downplayed this notion in a later interview: [...] "It is not me exactly. It is a composite character of <b>myself,</b> <b>what</b> I remember and people I knew. Plus, it includes my feelings in retrospect." ...|$|E
2500|$|In Avot, Hillel stated [...] "If I am not for myself, who is for me? And when I am for <b>myself,</b> <b>what</b> am [...] "I"? And if not now, when?"

5000|$|West told Madden {{that music}} was his {{favorite}} art and that he usually listened to music while writing. For the writing itself, he used an electric typewriter, which for him had a musical link: [...] "Sometimes I think I am playing the piano, which I cannot do, but I hear rhythms in my tapping and sometimes, Glenn Gould-like, I chant as I go to remind <b>myself</b> <b>what's</b> coming {{in the next few}} lines." ...|$|R

I have such respect for what he achieved. You can't take a personality like Fangio and compare him with what has happened today. There is not even the slightest comparison." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1910, {{his aunt}} adopted him, {{and they moved}} to Moscow, where he {{graduated}} from high school in 1920. Later that same year, Kolmogorov began to study at the Moscow State University and at the same time Mendeleev Moscow Institute of Chemistry and Technology. Kolmogorov writes about this time: [...] "I arrived at Moscow University with a fair knowledge of mathematics. I knew in particular the beginning of set theory. I studied many questions in articles in the Encyclopedia of Brockhaus and Efron, filling out for <b>myself</b> <b>what</b> was presented too concisely in these articles." ...|$|E

It's kinda awkward to be famous for a name that you've never been called before in your life. If you want me to know that you don't know me, call me T.I. It's the weirdest most awkward thing." [...] During the interview he also spoke on the benefit of not having to deal with a major label and how he couldn't have released Da' Nic if he wasn't independent.|$|E

Actually he came in earlier than expected on the same lap as <b>myself.</b> <b>What</b> we lost at the start we regained on the pit-stop, so our pit-stop crew, just did a fantastic job to just get me out ahead of Nico.

2500|$|According to Boyd, the album's title {{stems from}} his {{constant}} re-assessment of life; [...] "I'm {{addicted to the}} news. There's so much at play right now, so many important, catastrophic, beautiful things. This idea If Not Now, When? seems terribly poignant." [...] The singer told Spin the title refers to a quote from Hillel, the rabbi of the Mishnah, who said: [...] "If I am not for myself, who will be? And when I am for <b>myself,</b> <b>what</b> am 'I'? And if not now, when?" [...] (Avot 1:14) This third question, from which the album's title is derived, contains the admonition not to postpone any duties. It also echoes the admonition he gives with reference to study (Avot 2:4): [...] "Say not, 'When I have free time I shall study'; for you may perhaps never have any free time." ...|$|E

[...] Sparks joined Laura Bush at the Maamobi Polyclinic, where the Bush donated a number of treated bed nets to local female traders in order to help combat the scourge of malaria in Ghana. [...] While there, Sparks sang [...] "Amazing Grace" [...] to the durbar of chieftains who had gathered at the venue to give audience to Laura Bush.

2500|$|The Buccaneers {{defeated}} the St. Louis Cardinals, only recently eliminated from playoff contention, {{for their first}} home victory. Gary Huff completed 7 of 12 passes, including 61- and 62-yarders to Morris Owens, {{the first of which}} went for a touchdown. The improved offensive line allowed no sacks. Huff's average of 14.3 yards per pass attempt is the third-best in Buccaneer history, and stood as the record until broken by Vinny Testaverde in 1992. Said Coach McKay following the victory: [...] "I’m going to go home, take a shower, and tell <b>myself</b> <b>what</b> a great coach I am". Fans tore down the goalposts after the game, and a vendor outside the stadium began stamping the word [...] "Don’t" [...] {{at the top of the}} [...] "Throw McKay in Tampa Bay" [...] T-shirts he had been selling. The fifty points the Bucs scored in their final two games were nearly as many (53) they had put up in the entire rest of the season (twelve games). They had scored only three points at home until this game, being shut out in five consecutive home games.|$|E
2500|$|In October 2014, {{she took}} a public stand against cyberbullying, calling herself [...] "patient zero" [...] of online harassment. Speaking at a Forbes {{magazine}} [...] "30 Under 30" [...] summit about her experiences {{in the aftermath of}} the scandal, she said, [...] "Having survived <b>myself,</b> <b>what</b> I want to do now is help other victims of the shame game survive, too." [...] She said she was influenced by reading about the suicide of Tyler Clementi, a Rutgers University freshman, involving cyberbullying and joined Twitter to facilitate her efforts. In March 2015, Lewinsky continued to speak out publicly against cyberbullying, delivering a TED talk calling for a more compassionate Internet. In June 2015, she became an ambassador and strategic advisor for anti-bullying organization Bystander Revolution. The same month, she gave an anti-cyberbullying speech at the Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity. In September 2015, Lewinsky was interviewed by Amy Robach on Good Morning America, about Bystander Revolution's Month of Action campaign for National Bullying Prevention Month. [...] Lewinsky wrote the foreword to an October 2017 book by Sue Scheff and Melissa Schorr, Shame Nation: The Global Epidemic of Online Hate.|$|E
2500|$|Late Night with Conan O'Brien, {{originating}} from Studio 6A at 30 Rockefeller Plaza in New York City, premiered September 13, 1993 to unfavorable reviews from contemporary critics. This reception {{was not completely}} unsurprising; O'Brien wrote a self-deprecating New York Times piece titled [...] "O'Brien Flops!" [...] {{on the day of}} the show's premiere. Critics attacked O'Brien: Tom Shales of The Washington Post suggested that [...] "the host resume his previous identity, Conan O'Blivion." [...] Generally, critics viewed O'Brien as nervous and fidgety on-camera, and that he was [...] "too smart, too East Coast, too sophisticated, too young and even too tall to be successful." [...] The show was constantly at risk for cancellation; at one low point in 1994, NBC threatened to put him on a week-to-week contract. Executives were anxious to replace him with Greg Kinnear, who followed O'Brien with Later at 1:30am. Interns filled empty seats in the audience while affiliates began to inquire about replacement hosts. In one installment after a short stretch of reruns, sidekick Andy Richter described his vacation activities as follows: [...] "I sat back and reminded <b>myself</b> <b>what</b> it's like to be unemployed." [...] The in-joke referenced the rumors floating in the trades that NBC was near canceling the program.|$|E
