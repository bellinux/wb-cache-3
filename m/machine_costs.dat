40|$|AbstractMachining cost {{is a most}} {{important}} factor for manufacturing a product. The <b>machining</b> <b>cost</b> for each <b>machine</b> tool is often estimated from {{the total cost of}} a factory according to the conventional method used for industrial management. The total income and expenditure of a factory can be obtained, however the operation status of machine tools is different. That is to say that an accurate <b>machining</b> <b>cost</b> for each part can’t be estimated and then cutting conditions realizing minimum <b>machining</b> <b>cost</b> cannot be discussed before a real machining operation. Hence, an estimation method of <b>machining</b> <b>cost</b> is proposed with using ABC (activity-based costing). The activities related to electric consumption of a machine tool, coolant, lubricant oil, cutting tool and metal chip are considered for total <b>machining</b> <b>cost</b> in this research. Based on the estimation method, the calculation method of cutting conditions achieving minimum <b>machining</b> <b>cost</b> is introduced and discussed. An adequate cutting condition can be obtained by calculating an approximate equation with using least-square method and exploring a cutting condition achieving the minimum <b>machining</b> <b>cost</b> with using iterative calculation in this paper. The feasibility of the proposed estimation method of <b>machining</b> <b>cost</b> and the calculation method of cutting conditions achieving minimum <b>machining</b> <b>cost</b> is demonstrated through some case studies...|$|R

The Box-Cox methodology and multiyear data were used to facilitate this comparison.

Further, the more complex power transformation model formulations suggested by the Box-Cox methodology did not significantly outperform the more traditional and simpler double natural log model. More specifically, the results indicated that variables related to primary memory and microchip tedinology have the largest impact on <b>machine</b> <b>cost.</b> Additionally, variables related to madiine connectivity, machine expandability, and year of observation were also found to be significant explanatory variables for <b>machine</b> <b>cost...</b>|$|R

40|$|A new {{theoretical}} method {{which is}} used to define conditions of reducing the machinery cost price has been proposed. This method is based on functional interconnection between the major heads of expenditure. It has been analytically proved that the <b>machining</b> <b>cost</b> price, depending on production efficiency has its extremum (minimum) specified by the cutting tool wear rate. This fact made it possible to determine the optimal conditions of machining according to the criterion of the least cost price. By means of diamond grinding new conditions necessary for <b>machining</b> <b>cost</b> price reducing have been determined. They are maintenance of the optimal cutting relief of grinding wheel working face, that ensures its fast cutting capability and increase in product efficiency. The influence of dimensionless coefficient that determines the dulling degree of a single-point diamond on <b>machining</b> <b>cost</b> price has been demonstrated.

50|$|The CAD/CAM {{method of}} {{fabricating}} all-ceramic restorations is by electronically capturing and storing a photographic {{image of the}} prepared tooth and, using computer technology, crafting a 3D restoration design that conforms to all the necessary specifications of the proposed inlay, onlay or single-unit crown; there is no impression. After selecting the proper features and making various decisions on the computerized model, the dentist directs the computer to send the information to a local milling machine. This machine will then use its specially designed diamond burs to mill the restoration from a solid ingot of a ceramic of pre-determined shade to match the patient's tooth. After about 20 minutes, the restoration is complete, and the dentist sections it from {{the remainder of the}} unmilled ingot and tries it in the mouth. If the restoration fits well, the dentist can cement the restoration immediately. A dental CAD/CAM <b>machine</b> <b>costs</b> roughly $100,000, with continued purchase of ceramic ingots and milling burs. Because of high costs, the usual and customary fee for making a CAD/CAM crown in the dentist's office is commonly two to three times higher than having the same crown made in a dental laboratory.|$|E

This is known as the [...] "theoretical payout percentage" [...] or RTP, [...] "return to player".

40|$|In {{traditional}} {{aircraft wing}} structural design, the emphasis {{has been on}} pursuing the minimum weight or improved performance. The manufacturing complexity or cost assessments are rarely considered because it is usually assumed that the minimum weight design is also the minimum cost design. However, experience from industry has shown {{that this is not}} necessarily the case. It has been realised that in the cases where no manufacturing constraints are imposed, the extra <b>machining</b> <b>cost</b> can erode the advantages of the reduced weight. As manufacturing cost includes material <b>cost</b> and <b>machining</b> <b>cost,</b> whilst reducing weight can reduce the material cost, if the manufacturing complexity increases greatly as a result the overall cost may not go down.
