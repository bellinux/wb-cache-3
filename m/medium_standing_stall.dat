Questionnaires were sent to 3500 of its members and the results include data from 968 breeding enterprises, housing a total of 3965 FM. The quality of the husbandry of FM varies according to factors such as the altitude and the geographical situation of the farms and studs. Socio-economic parameters, such as the role of FM in the business, their use (breeding, driving, riding) and the age and level of professional education of the owners may also have an effect on standards of husbandry. The results show that the owners for whom FM represent a source of income more frequently keep their horses in <b>standing</b> <b>stalls,</b> but give them more time to exercise at liberty than the horses belonging to amateur breeders.

Prevalence appears higher in free stall housed dairy herds than in tie stall herds in Wisconsin, and is especially a problem in free stall herds using mat or mattress stall surfaces compared to those herds using sand. This article describes some of the behavioral differences which contribute to this difference. In particular, lame cows housed in mattress free stall barns appear to spend longer <b>standing</b> in the <b>stall,</b> compared to lame cows in sand stalls.

The aim of this research was to determine the physical and physico-chemical characteristics of waste of Abomey–Calavi city and to study the relationship between standard of living and average ratio of daily waste generated by each person. In this study the methodology used French standards to characterize particle size and typology of solid waste generated by the population of Calavi City in Benin, West Africa. According to home criteria, the study area was stratified into three distinct levels of standard of living called: high <b>standing,</b> <b>medium</b> <b>standing</b> and low standing; Waste from 60 households was weighed daily. The total waste produced by each household was collected seven (7) days a week, for a period of three weeks. Waste characterization was performed using ratio, size granulometry and typological composition. Physico- Chemical analysis including organic mater, pH, Total Organic Carbon, total Kjeldahl nitrogen and metal trace element were also performed. To better assess waste compostability, water extractable organic matter was quantified and qualitative identification was made with XAD 8 and XAD 4 resins. Results show that the amount of waste increases with the standard of living; the average ratio of daily waste generated is 0. 89 kg day- 1 person- 1 . Independently of the standard of living, fermentable compounds represent the largest proportion of waste materials (45 %). Qualitative difference of waste content in organic matter is shown {{as a function of the}} population’s living standards. These results could be explained by a higher consumption of meat in the households with a higher standard of living, reflecting a greater proportion of transphilic (TPI), and hydrophilic (HPI) fractions. The C/N ratio is lower in the high standing households than in low ones. Metal trace element analysis showed a low but still significant pollution, whereas high iron and alu minum concentrations were found in all standings. In conclusion we propose a strategy for waste management in Abomey-Calavi based on sorting at the source to eliminate plastic waste and valorization of wastes via composting...|$|R

25|$|Because of the party's pacifist-based {{opposition}} to the Gulf War, there was mass-media antipathy and negative publicity which some construed as poor media performance by Janet Powell, the party's <b>standing</b> having <b>stalled</b> at about 10%. Before 12 months of her leadership had passed, the South Australian and Queensland divisions were circulating the party's first-ever petition to criticise and oust the parliamentary leader. The explicit grounds related to Powell's alleged responsibility for poor AD ratings in Gallup and other media surveys of potential voting support. When this charge was deemed insufficient, interested party officers and senators reinforced it with negative media 'leaks' concerning her openly established relationship with Sid Spindler and exposure of administrative failings resulting in excessive overtime to a staff member. With National Executive blessing, the party room pre-empted the ballot by replacing the leader with deputy John Coulter. In the process, severe internal divisions were generated. One major collateral casualty was the party whip Paul McLean who resigned and quit the Senate in disgust at what he perceived as in-fighting between close friends. The casual NSW vacancy created by his resignation was filled by Karin Sowada. Powell duly left the party, along with many leading figures of the Victorian branch of the party, and unsuccessfully stood as an Independent candidate when her term expired.

40|$|AbstractTime budgets (TB) of {{lactating}} Holstein cows in a freestall {{loose housing}} system were recorded twice in {{early and late}} lactation to study genetic and phenotypic variation in TB. Time budget traits were recorded using focal animal scanning at 10 -min intervals for full 24 -h sessions. The study included 243 first-lactation cows, with 389 TB records in early lactation (50 to 123 d in milk) and 403 records in late lactation (152 to 248 d in milk). Milk was recorded at 3 -wk intervals during the same periods, and yield was expressed as energy-corrected milk. Time budget traits were analyzed with mixed linear models to obtain estimates of genetic variation (heritability) and permanent animal variance (repeatability). Correlations between TB traits and energy-corrected milk yield were estimated at the individual cow level. In early lactation, the cows spent, on average, 5. 0 h eating and 1. 8 h at feed gates without eating {{while they were still}} locked in the gates. Cows lay down for 10. 4 h and stood in stalls for 3. 2 h. The cows also spent 2. 8 h standing in aisles, but only 0. 5 h in the milking area. In late lactation, cows spent 1 h more lying, but less time <b>standing</b> in <b>stalls</b> and less time eating and at the feed gates. Time budget traits were moderately repeatable although highly consistent across lactation stages. Estimates of heritability were moderate for eating time (0. 20) but almost zero for lying time. Correlations showed that cows with higher yield spent more time eating and less time lying. As there is a trade-off between lying time and eating time, lying time approached lower limits for cows with highest yields. It is suggested that time is viewed as an important but restricted resource that cows may be short of while trying to maintain high yields...|$|R

These spherons exhibit properties which have analogues in the physical description of matter with rest mass, among them de Broglie like phase waves {{and at the same time}} "relativistic" effects such as contraction and a speed limit.

40|$|Non-motor symptoms, such as fear {{of falling}} and anxiety, are {{frequently}} reported in Parkinson's disease (PD). Recent evidence of anxiety and fear directly influencing balance control in healthy young and older adults, raises the question whether {{fear of falling}} and anxiety also directly contribute to the balance deficits observed in PD. The goal {{of the current study}} was to examine whether PD patients and controls responded similarly or differently to experimentally induced increases in anxiety. For this purpose, 14 PD patients (tested during a subjective optimal ON state) and 16 healthy age-matched control subjects stood in three conditions of different levels of postural threat: normal threat (quiet standing at ground level); <b>medium</b> threat (<b>standing</b> {{at the edge of a}} surface elevated to 80 cm); and high threat (same, but to 160 cm). Outcome measures included mean position, mean power of frequency (MPF) and root mean square (RMS) of centre of pressure (COP) displacements in the anterior-posterior (AP) and medial-lateral (ML) directions. Physiological and psychosocial measures of fear and anxiety were also recorded. Increased threat changed postural control similarly in PD patients and controls; MPF of AP and ML COP increased and the mean COP position was shifted backward in both groups. These results indicate that during the ON state, static balance in PD patients and controls is equally susceptible to the influence of anxiety. Significant correlations observed between COP changes and measures of fear and anxiety provide evidence to support the proposed neural links between structures controlling emotion and postural control. Future studies should further address this issue by including more severely affected patients, by testing the influence of dopaminergic medication, by including more anxious patients, and by using dynamic measures of balance...|$|R
40|$|The use {{of laser}} beams as {{excitation}} {{sources for the}} characterization of semiconductor nanowires (NWs) is largely extended. Raman spectroscopy and photoluminescence (PL) are currently applied {{to the study of}} NWs. However, NWs are systems with poor thermal conductivity and poor heat dissipation, which result in unintentional heating under the excitation with a focused laser beam with microscopic size, as those usually used in microRaman and microPL experiments. On the other hand, the NWs have subwavelength diameter, which changes the optical absorption with respect to the absorption in bulk materials. Furthermore, the NW diameter is smaller than the laser beam spot, which means that the optical power absorbed by the NW depends on its position inside the laser beam spot. A detailed analysis of the interaction between a microscopic focused laser beam and semiconductor NWs is necessary for the understanding of the experiments involving laser beam excitation of NWs. We present in this work a numerical analysis of the thermal transport in Si NWs, where the heat source is the laser energy locally absorbed by the NW.
