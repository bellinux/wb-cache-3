On March 26, Steinbeck first {{mentions}} Cathy to Covici: “This is a woman and you must know her; know her completely because she is a tremendously powerful force in the book.” The majority of these letters demonstrate that Steinbeck was <b>most</b> <b>fascinated</b> with Cathy’s character, mentioning once that he must get back to writing about his “dear Cathy”.|$|R

The strains of cacti, though not indigenous to the locale, have been carefully cultivated over the years, and now the town boasts one of the <b>most</b> <b>fascinating</b> and exhaustive collections of the Cactaceae family. The plants have adapted well to the altitude and environment, and now prove {{to be one of}} the chief draws of tourism to the township.|$|E
5|$|Truman {{ascended to}} the {{presidency}} when Roosevelt died in April 1945, just {{before the end of}} World War II. In the war's aftermath, Americans wanted to know why the U.S. seemed ill-prepared for the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. Barkley sponsored a resolution to create the Joint Committee on the Investigation of the Pearl Harbor Attack and was chosen as chairman of the ten-person committee. The committee's report, delivered on July 20, 1946, exonerated Roosevelt of any blame for the attack and highlighted weaknesses in communications between branches of the U.S. armed forces, leading {{to the creation of the}} United States Department of Defense. Barkley also helped ensure U.S. participation in the United Nations and advocated approval of billions of dollars in loans to rebuild Europe. Look magazine named him the second <b>most</b> <b>fascinating</b> person in the country behind Dwight D. Eisenhower.|$|E

25|$|The existentialist {{philosopher and}} nobel prize-winning author Albert Camus {{centered}} on a discussion of Ivan Karamazov's revolt in his 1951 book Rebel. According to the philosopher Charles B. Guignon, the novel's <b>most</b> <b>fascinating</b> character, Ivan Karamazov, had {{by the middle of}} the twentieth century become the icon of existentialist rebellion in the writings of Albert Camus and Jean-Paul Sartre. An important part of the novel is the poem The Grand Inquisitor, told by Ivan, which is one of the best-known passages in modern literature because of its ideas about human nature, freedom, power, authority, and religion, and for its fundamental ambiguity. A reference to the poem can be found in Aldous Huxley's novel Brave New World Revisited and David Foster Wallace's novel Infinite Jest.|$|E

40|$|As a man James Weldon Johnson is {{fascinating}} {{if only for}} his many careers: lawyer, counselor to Latin America, founding father of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, lecturer, teacher, elementary school principal, novelist, essayist, song writer, translator, and :poet. However, it is as a poet that he <b>most</b> <b>fascinates</b> me, and as a poet he has not received attention proportionate to his accomplishments. In this paper I wish to trace his development as it moved through four rather distinct stages from his early dialect poetry to his later religious poetry (as represented by God 2 ̆ 7 s Trombones: Seven Negro Sermons in Verse.) I believe my summary will show that Johnson gradually developed skill in handling problems of rhythm, imagery, and diction, {{as well as other}} poetic elements...|$|R

25|$|Similar to {{colleague}} Barbara Walters, Couric anchors specials for {{the network}} and for the newsmagazine 20/20. While she contributes to the news program all throughout the year, in 2011, Couric created her newly annual special The Year with Katie Couric, which is a program that {{marks the end of}} the year and covers some of the biggest newsmakers and news events of that year. This is a collaboration with People magazine, which also reflects events in the world of news, sports, politics, and major headlines that helped shape the world. This is very similar to that of Walters's iconic Barbara Walters' 10 <b>Most</b> <b>Fascinating</b> People, a year end program that marks {{the end of the year}} and acknowledges the people that had the most impact on the year at hand with interviews on their perspective of the year. As part of the special, Couric interviews fellow members of the media that can provide some insight on some events that occurred.|$|E

A Record Mirror review said [...] "I have to confess complete ignorance of precisely what Van der Graaf Generator are trying to achieve", though Melody Maker were more enthusiastic, saying [...] "A Plague of Lighthouse Keepers" [...] {{is one of the}} <b>most</b> <b>fascinating</b> and dramatic items I've ever heard". However, the album reached number one on the Italian album charts.|$|E

5000|$|Margaret Prior (also called [...] "Peggy" [...] and [...] "Aurora"), an {{unmarried}} woman from an upper-class family, visits the Millbank Prison in 1870s Victorian-era England. The protagonist is an overall unhappy person, recovering from her father's death and her subsequent failed suicide attempt, and struggling with {{her lack of}} power living {{at home with her}} over-involved mother despite being almost 30. She becomes a [...] "Lady Visitor" [...] of the prison, hoping to escape her troubles and be a guiding figure {{in the lives of the}} female prisoners. As she peers through a flap in the door, entranced by the sight of a young woman with a flower, she is reminded of a Carlo Crivelli painting. Of all the prisoners, she is <b>most</b> <b>fascinated</b> by this woman, whom she learns to be Selina Dawes, medium of spirits.|$|R

500|$|Stolen Innocence reached {{number six}} on the New York Times best seller list, and 400,000 copies were {{confirmed}} {{to have been}} printed by March 2013. Critically, it received mixed reactions. Dwight Garner from The New York Times found the story [...] "both creepy...and quite moving". Caroline Leavitt from People Magazine wrote, [...] "Coming {{on the heels of}} the raid on the FLDS compound in Eldorado, Wall's story couldn't be more timely. Her descriptions of the polygamous sect's rigidity are shocking, but what's <b>most</b> <b>fascinating</b> is the immensely likeable author's struggle to reconcile her longing for happiness with her terror of its consequences." ...|$|E
500|$|In December Harrison {{released}} Dark Horse, {{an album}} that {{earned him the}} least favourable reviews of his career. Rolling Stone called it [...] "the chronicle of a performer out of his element, working to a deadline, enfeebling his overtaxed talents by a rush to deliver a new 'LP product', rehearse a band, and assemble a cross-country tour, all within three weeks". The album reached number 4 on the Billboard chart and the single [...] "Dark Horse" [...] reached number 15, but they failed {{to make an impact}} in the UK. The music critic Mikal Gilmore described Dark Horse as [...] "one of Harrison's <b>most</b> <b>fascinating</b> works – a record about change and loss".|$|E
500|$|Oliver Sava of The A.V. Club {{called the}} [...] "Fionna and Cake" [...] one of [...] "the <b>most</b> <b>fascinating</b> {{aspects of the}} Adventure Time craze" [...] {{in a review of}} the fifth season episode [...] "Bad Little Boy". He wrote that [...] "'Fionna and Cake' was {{reminiscent}} of the series' earlier episodes, in regards to its bright animation, well-paced plot, music, its successful blend of fantasy action and comedy, and its focus on character-based drama. As a result, he felt that the entry was composed of elements that make the series as a whole great. In a separate article, Sava named the entry one of the ten most representative episodes of the series and wrote that it is also [...] "the most aggressively girl-friendly episode of the series".|$|E
40|$|Research {{interests}} My {{research interests}} {{are in the}} area of statistical genetics and cover many subtopics within the area. I am <b>most</b> <b>fascinated</b> by the use of inheritance in humans to understand human disease, health and associated quantitative traits. This is a running theme and motivation throughout my work. I love the interface between science and statistics and find that the best statistical methods come out of collaboration. My past work has included methods development in family-based association testing and genetics of gene expression studies. I have also worked over many other areas of statistical genetics from classical segregation studies to linkage and association studies. I am currently looking for a new area of methods work and am particularly interested in aspects of the human microbiome. Key interests: statistical genetics, genetic epidemiology, genetics of gene expression, variance components methods, multivariate linkage, linkage disequilibrium, family-based association tests, meta-analysis...|$|R

That is a broad statement and I hope I can prove it. I am prepared to state that I feel almost certain, if I spent another month bonefishing, I would become obsessed and perhaps lose my enthusiasm for other kinds of fish.|$|R
500|$|The 220-pages-long book {{features}} 53 chapters. Colbert {{writes about}} the connections between Rowling's novels and folklore, Greek mythology, and the cultures of Ancient Egypt, Ancient Rome, and the Aztec. For example, he explains that Rowling got the name for the character Draco Malfoy from the Latin word for dragon, draco. One of the connections to folklore that Colbert find the <b>most</b> <b>fascinating</b> {{is the name of}} the evil wizard family The Malfoys. They are named after the Latin word for [...] "evil-doer", maleficus, which was used in medieval times to describe witches. In addition, there is a chapter in the book that explains the origins of the names of the spells featured in the Harry Potter series. Expelliarmus, for example, is a spell that disarms the opponent; it comes from the Latin words expello and arma, which mean [...] "to drive out" [...] and [...] "weapon".|$|E
500|$|In Neuromancer, Gibson {{first used}} the term [...] "" [...] {{to refer to the}} visualized Internet, two years after the nascent Internet was formed in the early 1980s from the {{computer}} networks of the 1970s. Gibson thereby imagined a worldwide communications network years before the origin of the World Wide Web, although related notions had previously been imagined by others, including science fiction writers. At the time he wrote [...] "Burning Chrome", Gibson [...] "had a hunch that [...] would change things, {{in the same way that}} the ubiquity of the automobile changed things." [...] In 1995, he identified the advent, evolution and growth of the Internet as [...] "one of the <b>most</b> <b>fascinating</b> and unprecedented human achievements of the century", a new kind of civilization that is– in terms of significance — on a par with the birth of cities, and in 2000 predicted it would lead to the death of the nation state.|$|E
500|$|Live Through This was a {{commercial}} and critical success, hitting platinum RIAA certification in April 1995 and receiving numerous critical accolades. The {{success of the}} record combined with Cobain's suicide resulted in {{a high level of}} publicity for Love, and she was featured on Barbara Walters' 10 <b>Most</b> <b>Fascinating</b> People in 1995. At Hole's performance on August 26, 1994 at the Reading Festival— Love's first public performance following her husband's death— she appeared onstage with outstretched arms, mimicking crucifixion. A MTV review of their performance referred to it as [...] "by turns macabre, frightening and inspirational." [...] John Peel wrote in The Guardian that Love's disheveled appearance [...] "would have drawn whistles of astonishment in Bedlam", and that her performance [...] "verged on the heroic... Love steered her band through a set which dared you to pity either her recent history or that of the band... the band teetered on the edge of chaos, generating a tension which I cannot remember having felt before from any stage." ...|$|E
50|$|Frisch himself {{acknowledged}} that the part of writing a new play that <b>most</b> <b>fascinated</b> him was the first draft, when the piece was undefined, and the possibilities for its development were still wide open. The critic Hellmuth Karasek identified in Frisch's plays a mistrust of dramatic structure, apparent from {{the way in which}} Don Juan or the Love of Geometry applies theatrical method. Frisch prioritized the unbelievable aspects of theatre and valued transparency. Unlike his friend, the dramatist Friedrich Dürrenmatt, Frisch had little appetite for theatrical effects, which might distract from doubts and sceptical insights included in a script. For Frisch, effects came from a character being lost for words, from a moment of silence, or from a misunderstanding. And where a Dürrenmatt drama might lead, with ghastly inevitability, to a worst possible outcome, the dénouement in a Frisch play typically involved a return to the starting position: the destiny that awaited his protagonist might be to have no destiny.|$|R
