5|$|The story survives {{through the}} Hundred Rolls, the great {{survey of the}} English {{hundreds}} made by Edward I, in 1274-5, on returning to his new kingdom from crusade. The scheme, impractical as it <b>might</b> <b>seem,</b> was supposedly based on contemporary sagas of Viking heroes. But the complaints of the local community {{were based on the}} fact that Southchurch had taken all the supplies home to his own manor of Southchurch, received 200 marks from the exchequer, yet never paid out any of what the owners of the goods were entitled to.|$|E
5|$|Though it <b>might</b> <b>seem</b> {{as if the}} Bible {{translation}} set a {{very powerful}} precedent for orthographic standards, spelling actually became more inconsistent during {{the remainder of the}} century. It was not until the 17th century that spelling began to be discussed, around the time when the first grammars were written. The spelling debate raged on until the early 19th century, and {{it was not until the}} latter half of the 19th century that the orthography reached generally acknowledged standards.|$|E
5|$|The panel {{may have}} been {{conceived}} as either the left-hand wing of a since dismantled diptych, or as the front piece of a double-sided panel. Art historian Erwin Panofsky suggests that the Washington Saint George and the Dragon of 1432–35 {{is the most likely}} opposite wing. In that work, St. George, facing inwards and to the right, slays the dragon before a Libyan princess. Although the pairing <b>might</b> <b>seem</b> incongruous, his Madonna Standing is widely thought to have been attached with the St. Catherine of Alexandria in Vienna. In both panels, the saints face inwards and are within fully realised landscapes. In contrast, in both left-hand panels, the Madonna and Child are positioned frontally (although eye contact is avoided) and isolated within cold grisaille architectural spaces.|$|E

5|$|Amphibians <b>might</b> <b>seem</b> {{unlikely}} desert-dwellers, {{because of}} their need to keep their skins moist and their dependence on water for reproductive purposes. In fact, the few species that are found in this habitat have made some remarkable adaptations. Most of them are fossorial, spending the hot dry months aestivating in deep burrows. While there they shed their skins {{a number of times}} and retain the remnants around them as a waterproof cocoon to retain moisture. In the Sonoran Desert, Couch's spadefoot toad spends most of the year dormant in its burrow. Heavy rain is the trigger for emergence and the first male to find a suitable pool calls to attract others. Eggs are laid and the tadpoles grow rapidly as they must reach metamorphosis before the water evaporates. As the desert dries out, the adult toads rebury themselves. The juveniles stay on the surface for a while, feeding and growing, but soon dig themselves burrows. Few make it to adulthood. The water holding frog in Australia has a similar life cycle and may aestivate for as long as five years if no rain falls. The Desert rain frog of Namibia is nocturnal and survives because of the damp sea fogs that roll in from the Atlantic.|$|E
5|$|On average, {{the light}} that Gliese 581d {{receives}} from its star has about 30% of the intensity of light the Earth receives from the Sun. By comparison, sunlight on Mars has about 40% of the intensity of that on Earth. That <b>might</b> <b>seem</b> to suggest that Gliese 581d is too cold to support liquid water and hence is inhospitable to life. However, an atmospheric greenhouse effect can significantly raise planetary temperatures. For example, Earth's own mean temperature would be about −18°C without any greenhouse gases, ranging from around 100°C on the day side to −150°C at night, much like that found on the Moon. If the atmosphere of Gliese 581d produces a sufficiently large greenhouse effect, and the planet's geophysics stabilize the CO2 levels (as Earth's does via plate tectonics), then the surface temperature might permit a liquid water cycle, conceivably allowing the planet to support life. Calculations by Barnes et al. suggest, however, that tidal heating is too low to keep plate tectonics active on the planet, unless radiogenic heating is somewhat higher than expected.|$|E

25|$|In operant conditioning, {{the type}} and {{frequency}} of behavior is determined mainly by its consequences. If a certain behavior, {{in the presence of}} a certain stimulus, is followed by a desirable consequence (a reinforcer), the emitted behavior will increase in frequency in the future, in the presence of the stimulus that preceded the behavior (or a similar one). Conversely, if the behavior is followed by something undesirable (a punisher), the behavior is less likely to occur in the presence of the stimulus. In a similar manner, removal of a stimulus directly following the behavior might either increase or decrease the frequency of that behavior in the future (negative reinforcement or punishment). For instance, a student that gained praise and a good grade after turning in a paper, <b>might</b> <b>seem</b> more motivated in writing papers in the future (positive reinforcement); if the same student put in a lot of work on a task without getting any praise for it, he or she <b>might</b> <b>seem</b> less motivated to do school work in the future (negative punishment). If a student starts to cause trouble in class gets punished with something he or she dislikes, such as detention (positive punishment), that behavior would decrease in the future. The student <b>might</b> <b>seem</b> more motivated to behave in class, presumably in order to avoid further detention (negative reinforcement).|$|E

25|$|De la Gardie {{had been}} partly {{responsible}} for the treaty with France and had worked hard to increase the young King Charles's power. It <b>might</b> <b>seem</b> ironic that the treaty helped moving Sweden into a deep crisis financially, which, together with the level of power Charles had attained, in turn led to the reduction. Thus, De la Gardie contributions came to be a large factor behind his own fall from power and richness.|$|E
25|$|The supply {{transformer}} (T) {{secondary winding}} is connected across the primary tuned circuit. It <b>might</b> <b>seem</b> that the transformer {{would be a}} leakage path for the RF current, damping the oscillations. However its large inductance gives it a very high impedance at the resonant frequency, so it acts as an open circuit to the oscillating current. If the supply transformer has inadequate leakage inductance, radio frequency chokes are placed in its secondary leads to block the RF current.|$|E

25|$|Mathematics can, broadly speaking, be {{subdivided}} {{into the study}} of quantity, structure, space, and change (i.e. arithmetic, algebra, geometry, and analysis).

While some areas <b>might</b> <b>seem</b> unrelated, the Langlands program has found connections between areas previously thought unconnected, such as Galois groups, Riemann surfaces and number theory.|$|E

25|$|To decide {{exactly where}} a new topic or thought begins within a biblical text {{involves}} {{a degree of}} subjectivity {{on the part of}} the reader.

It may also explain why certain verses which <b>might</b> <b>seem</b> like introductions to a new topic lack a section division, or why such divisions sometimes appear in places where no new topic seems indicated.

25|$|The {{linguistic}} part {{traces the}} connections between the various Indo-European languages, and reconstructs the proto-Indo-European language. This is possible because the processes that change languages are not random, but follow strict patterns. Especially sound shifts, the changing of vowels and consonants, are important, although grammar (especially morphology) and the lexicon (vocabulary) may also be significant. Historical-comparative linguistics thus {{makes it possible to}} see great similarities between languages which at first sight <b>might</b> <b>seem</b> very different. Various characteristics of the Indo-European languages argue against an Indian origin of these languages, and point to a steppe origin of these languages.|$|E
25|$|In electromagnetism, {{permittivity}} or absolute permittivity, usually {{denoted by}} the Greek letter ε (epsilon), {{is the measure}} of resistance that is encountered when forming an electric field in a particular medium. More specifically, permittivity describes the amount of charge needed to generate one unit of electric flux in a particular medium. Accordingly, a charge will yield more electric flux in a medium with low permittivity than in a medium with high permittivity. Thus, permittivity is the measure of a material's ability to resist an electric field, not its ability to ‘permit’ it (as the name ‘permittivity’ <b>might</b> <b>seem</b> to suggest).|$|E
