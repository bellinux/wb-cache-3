30|$|Prasad et al. ([2002]) {{performed}} {{a large number}} of simulations with a CFD model, in order to study water-mist suppression in a compartment. The effects of various water <b>mist</b> <b>injection</b> parameters i.e. droplet diameter, <b>mist</b> <b>injection</b> velocity and injection density on the time to fire suppression were studied. The authors state that some of the values for the range of parameters used in the study would not be attainable experimentally because the nozzles needed were not commercially available. But with the CFD model it was possible to study general trends, when the droplet density or injection velocity or droplet diameter was varied systematically. The authors compared modelling results of the ceiling gas temperatures distribution with experimental data in a report issued by the US Naval Research Laboratory (Prasad et al. [2000]) and found the results to be favourable. However, the water-mist suppression modelling was not compared to traditional experiments due to lack of experimental data, and that is of course drawback of the study because it can raise questions about the external validity of the of the performed numerical experiment.|$|E
40|$|To {{meet the}} {{economic}} requirements of power output, the increased inlet temperature of modern gas turbines {{is above the}} melting point of the material. Therefore, high-efficient cooling technology is needed to protect the blades from the hot mainstream. In this study, film cooling was investigated in a simplified channel. A bulge located upstream of the film hole was numerically investigated by analysis of the film cooling effectiveness distribution downstream of the wall. The flow distribution in the plate channel is first presented. Comparing with a case without bulge, different cases with bulge heights of 0. 1 d, 0. 3 d and 0. 5 d were examined with blowing ratios of 0. 5 and 1. 0. Cases with 1 % <b>mist</b> <b>injection</b> were also included {{in order to obtain}} better cooling performance. Results show that the bulge configuration located upstream the film hole makes the cooling film more uniform, and enhanceslateral cooling effectiveness. Unlike other cases, the configuration with a 0. 3 d-height bulge shows a good balance in improving the downstream and lateral cooling effectiveness. Compared with the case without mist at M = 0. 5, the 0. 3 d-height bulge with 1 % <b>mist</b> <b>injection</b> increases lateral average effectiveness by 559 % at x/d = 55. In addition, a reduction of the thermal stress concentration can be obtained by increasing the height of the bulge configuration...|$|E
40|$|Necrosis at {{the leaf}} tips and margins of pearl millet (Pennisetum glaucum (L.) R. Br.) was {{observed}} in 1995 in a Pseudomonas syringae resistance screening nursery near Bulawayo, Zimbabwe. Straw-colored lesions with a chlorotic edge often extended the leaf length, and were atypical of the round spots, with a brown margin, caused by P. syringae (1). Bacteria were isolated from cut lesions macerated in water by dilution streaking onto King's medium B and nutrient agar. A gram-negative, nonfluorescent, fermentative, rod-shaped bacterium, forming yellow colonies on nutrient agar was consistently observed. Three pots of 10, 2 -to 3 -week-old seedlings of a susceptible cultivar, 852 B, were inoculated with a 108 CFU per ml suspension from cultures by <b>misting</b> or <b>injection</b> into the whorl.

40|$|Pinto {{breeding}} line NE 94 - 4 (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) showed seed coat yellowing in on-farm-field trials in Nebraska in 1996 and 1997. After reviewing field and weather {{data of the}} on-farm-trial sites, hail, high temperature and sprinkler irrigation appeared {{to be involved with}} the increase in seed coat yellowing. The goal of this research was to determine the cause(s) of testa yellowing. Moisture was the factor chosen for further exploration. Two greenhouse experiments (<b>misting</b> and <b>injection)</b> and one lab experiment (moistened filter paper) were conducted. The experimental design was a split-plot in the misting experiment, and a randomized complete block design in the injection and moistened filter paper experiments. In all experiments, {{breeding line}} NE 94 - 4 and Pinto bean variety UI 114 (control) were used. At the end of each experiment, yellowing was recorded visually. Data from all three experiments were analyzed using the mixed model procedure of SAS. In the misting experiment, only variety/line, and the interaction between variety/line and pod were significant. In the injection and moistened filter paper experiments, the treatment effects were significant with NE 94 - 4 showing more yellowing than UI 114. Thin layer paper chromatography (TLC) was used to identify the pigments in the Pinto bean seed testa. Some flavonoids and carotenes were identified. Sulpheritin (aurones, flavonoids) was found only in the seed coat of yellowed NE 94 - 4. On the other hand, daidzein and genistein (isoflavonoids) were identified only in the seed coat of UI 114...|$|R
40|$|This report {{provides}} the first high level look at system design, airplane performance, maintenance, and cost implications of using water <b>misting</b> and water <b>injection</b> technology in aircraft engines for takeoff and climb-out NOx emissions reduction. With an engine compressor inlet water misting rate of 2. 2 percent water-to-air ratio, a 47 percent NOx reduction was calculated. Combustor water injection could achieve greater reductions of about 85 percent, {{but with some}} performance penalties. For the water misting system on days above 59 F, a fuel efficiency benefit of about 3. 5 percent would be experienced. Reductions of up to 436 F in turbine inlet temperature were also estimated, {{which could lead to}} increased hot section life. A 0. 61 db noise reduction will occur. A nominal airplane weight penalty of less than 360 lb (no water) was estimated for a 305 passenger airplane.

40|$|Effective cooling of {{gas turbine}} {{combustor}} liners, combustor transition pieces, turbine vanes (nozzles) and blades (buckets) {{is a critical}} task to protect these components from the flue gas at extremely high temperature. Air film cooling has been successfully used to cool these hot sections for the last half century. However, the net benefits from the traditional methods seem to be marginally incremental, but the temperature of working gas is continuously increasing to achieve a high thermal efficiency. Therefore, new cooling techniques need to be developed. One of the promising techniques is to enhance film cooling with <b>mist</b> <b>injection.</b> While the previous study reported the effect of mist on the cooling effectiveness with an adiabatic wall, this paper focuses {{on the effect of}} <b>mist</b> <b>injection</b> on heat transfer of film cooling with a non-adiabatic flat wall, using commercial CFD software package Fluent. Both 2 -D and 3 -D cases are considered with a 2 -D slot and diffusive compound angle holes. Modellings of interaction of droplet with uniformly cooled wall as well as conjugate heat conduction inside the solid base are conducted. Different mist droplet sizes and mist concentrations are adopted. Both conditions at a gas turbine operating environment (15 atm and 1561 K) and in the laboratory environment (1 atm and 450 K) are considered. Results show that injecting 2 ~ 10 % mist successfully reduces the heat transfer coefficient and the wall temperature. Especially, mist has the prolonged effect of cooling the region downstream of 15 jet hole diameters, where the conventional air film cooling is not effective...|$|E

40|$|Air {{film cooling}} has been {{successfully}} used to cool gas turbine hot sections for the last half century. A promising technology is proposed to enhance air film cooling with water <b>mist</b> <b>injection.</b> Numerical simulations have shown that injecting {{a small amount of}} water droplets into the cooling air improves film-cooling performance significantly. However, previous studies were conducted at conditions of low Reynolds number, temperature, and pressure to allow comparisons with experimental data. As a continuous effort to develop a realistic mist film cooling scheme, this paper focuses on simulating mist film cooling under typical gas turbine operating conditions of high temperature and pressure. The mainstream flow is at 15 atm with a temperature of 1561 K.

40|$|The {{adiabatic}} film-cooling effectiveness on {{a thermal}} barrier coating surface is investigated numerically. A film-cooling hole with an inclination angle of 35 ° is placed upstream the deposition configuration. The depositions are arranged on the external wall with three different positions. For no-mist models, the cooling performances downstream the wall are investigated for the blowing ratios of 0. 5, 0. 75, and 1. 0. Results show that the adiabatic film-cooling effectiveness without surface deposition is decreased by increasing the blowing ratio. To investigate the effects of both different locations and 4. 4 % <b>mist</b> <b>injection</b> on the film cooling, a discrete phase model (DPM) is used. It is found that the film-cooling effectiveness is improved remarkably from the deposition position to the wall downstream. In addition, deposition formation at the middle location shows a good cooling effectiveness, but the lowest value of the film-cooling effectiveness occurs upstream the deposition position...|$|E
40|$|Numerical {{simulation}} {{is performed}} {{in this study}} to explore film-cooling enhancement by injecting mist into the cooling air {{with a focus on}} investigating the effect of various modeling schemes on the simulation results. The effect of turbulence models, dispersed-phase modeling, inclusion of different forces (Saffman, thermophoresis, and Brownian), trajectory tracking, and <b>mist</b> <b>injection</b> scheme is studied. The effect of flow inlet boundary conditions (with/without air supply plenum), inlet turbulence intensity, and the near-wall grid density on simulation results is also included. Using a 2 -D slot film cooling simulation with a fixed blowing angle and blowing ratio shows a 2 % mist injected into the cooling air can increase the cooling effectiveness about 45 %. The RNG k-ε model, RSM and the standard k-ε turbulence model with the enhanced wall treatment produce consistent and reasonable results while the turbulence dispersion has a significant effect on mist film cooling through the stochastic trajectory calculation. The thermophoretic force slightly increases the cooling effectiveness, but the effect of Brownian force and Saffman lift is imperceptible. The cooling performance is affected negatively by the plenum in this study, which alters the velocity profile and turbulence intensity at the jet exit plane. The results of this paper can serve as the qualification reference for future more complicated studies including 3 -D cooling holes, different blowing ratios, various density ratios, and rotational effect...|$|E
40|$|Cooling of {{gas turbine}} hot section {{components}} such as combustor liners, combustor transition pieces, turbine vanes (nozzles) and blades (buckets) {{is a critical}} task for improving the life and reliability of hot-section components. Conventional cooling techniques using air-film cooling, impingement jet cooling, and turbulators have significantly contributed to cooling enhancements in the past. However, the increased net benefits that can be continuously harnessed by using these conventional cooling techniques seem to be incremental and are about to approach their limit. Therefore, new cooling techniques are essential for surpassing these current limits. This paper investigates the potential of film cooling enhancement by injecting mist into the coolant. The computational results show that {{a small amount of}} injection (2 % of the coolant flow rate) can enhance the cooling effectiveness about 30 % ~ 50 %. The cooling enhancement takes place more strongly in the downstream region, where the single-phase film cooling becomes less powerful. Three different holes are used in this study including a 2 -D slot, a round hole, and a fan-shaped diffusion hole. A comprehensive study is performed on the effect of flue gas temperature, blowing angle, blowing ratio, <b>mist</b> <b>injection</b> rate, and droplet size on the cooling effectiveness with 2 -D cases. Analysis on droplet history (trajectory and size) is undertaken to interpret the mechanism of droplet dynamics...|$|E
40|$|Emulsion fuel is a {{fuel that}} {{combines}} {{two or more}} immiscible liquids to become a solution that can generate a micro-explosion effect during combustion which will leads to a complete combustion and reduce exhaust emissions. In order to combine these two or more immiscible liquids which will separated in nature and keep it stable {{for a long period}} of time, an additive know as surfactant need to be added. The cost of surfactant is very high and restrains emulsion fuel for further utilization as an alternative fuel. With the aim to remove dependency on surfactant to produce emulsion fuel, a mechanical approach concept has been considered. The concept named here as Real-Time Emulsion Fuel Supply System (RTES). A combination of high shear mixing, ultrasonic agitation and water <b>mist</b> <b>injection</b> could be arranged near to fuel pump of diesel engine. It is expected that further improvement of exhaust emissions and fuel consumption can be obtained with higher water percentage and optimum water droplet size of emulsion fuel. This research propose an investigation on the effect of emulsion fuel water droplet size and water percentage through variation of parameters towards diesel engine combustion performance and exhaust emissions. Droplet size will be measured using a super resolution digital microscope. Since the size of water droplet will change rapidly against time, a special experimental rig will be developed attached to the microscope...|$|E
40|$|A subgrid scale (SGS) {{model for}} {{partially}} premixed combustion has been implemented {{and applied to}} simulate the backdraft phenomena and its mitigation by watermist. The model {{is based on the}} coupling of independent approaches for non-premixed and premixed turbulent combustion. The "flame index" concept was used to separate the two different combustion regimes. This index describes the structure of the flame based on fuel and oxygen gradients. By using this approach, it is possible to implement individually the most suitable combustion models for each structure. In the current study, the Large Eddy Laminar Flamelet Model (LELFM) was used for non-premixed combustion and the flame surface density approach for premixed combustion. Simulations were conducted for the reduced scale backdraft tests of Weng and Fan [1]. The predicted pressure-time curve is in good agreement with the measurement. The predicted mass flow rate versus time has also captured the correct trend indicated by the measurement but quantitatively relatively larger discrepancies are found. For the simulation with watermist, a correlation for the laminar burning velocity of the methane-air-diluent-water vapor system was introduced following Stone and Clarke [2] and Liaio et al. [3]. In line with the experimental observation, the watermist was found to have mitigated the backdraft by reducing the prevailing laminar flame velocity, resulting in lower temperature and pressure distributions within the compartment. However, in this particular case, the mist did not completely suppress the turbulent deflagration. Further study to optimize the <b>mist</b> <b>injection</b> time, speed, quantity, and direction is needed to achieve this goal...|$|E
40|$|The {{demand for}} high power in {{aircraft}} gas turbine engines {{as well as}} industrial gas turbine prime mover promotes increasing the turbine entry temperature, the mass flow rate and the overall pressure ratio. High turbine entry temperature is however the most convenient way to increase the thrust without requiring a large change in the engine size. This research is focused on improving the internal cooling of high pressure turbine blade by investigating a range of solutions that {{can contribute to the}} more effective removal of heat when compared with existing configuration. The role played by the shape of the internal blade passages is investigated with numerical methods. In addition, the application of mist air as a means of enhanced heat removal is studied. The research covers three main area of investigation. The first one is concerned with the supply of mist on to the coolant flow as a mean to enhancing heat transfer. The second area of investigation is the manipulation of the secondary flow through cross-section variation as a means to augment heat transfer. Lastly a combination of a number of geometrical features in the passage is investigated. A promising technique to significantly improve heat transfer is to inject liquid droplets into the coolant flow. The droplets which will evaporate after travelling a certain distance, act as a cooling sink which consequently promote added heat removal. Due to the promising results of mist cooling in the literature, this research investigated its effect on a roughened cooling passage with five levels of mist mass percentages. In order to validate the numerical model, two stages were carried out. First, one single-phase flow case was validated against experimental results available in the open literature. Analysing the effect of the rotational force, on both flow physics and heat transfer, on the ribbed channel was the main concern of this investigation. Furthermore, the computational results using <b>mist</b> <b>injection</b> were also validated against the experimental results available in the literature. Injection of mist in the coolant flow helped achieve up to a 300 % increase in the average flow temperature of the stream, therefore in extracting significantly more heat from the wall. The Nusselt number increased by 97 % for the rotating leading edge at 5 % <b>mist</b> <b>injection.</b> In the case of air only, the heat transfers decrease in the second passage, while in the mist case, the heat transfer tends to increase in the second passage. Heat transfer increases quasi linearly with the increase of the mist percentage when there is no rotation. However, in the presence of rotation, the heat transfers increase with an increase in mist content up to 4 %, thereafter the heat transfer whilst still rising does so more gradually. The second part of this research studies the effect of non-uniform cross- section on the secondary flow and heat transfer in order to identify a preferential design for the blade cooling internal passage. Four different cross-sections were investigated. All cases start with square cross-section which then change all the way until it reaches the 180 degree turn before it changes back to square cross-section at the outlet. All cases were simulated at four different speeds. At low speeds the rectangle and trapezoidal cross-section achieved high heat transfer. At high speed the pentagonal and rectangular cross-sections achieved high heat transfer. Pressure loss is accounted for while making use of the thermal performance factor parameter which accounts for both heat transfer and pressure loss. The pentagonal cross-section showed high potential in terms of the thermal performance factor with a value over 0. 8 and higher by 33 % when compared to the rectangular case. In the final section multiple enhancement techniques are combined in the sudden expansion case, such as, ribs, slots and ribbed slot. The maximum heat enhancement is achieved once all previous techniques are used together. Under these circumstances the Nusselt number increased by 60 % in the proposed new design...|$|E
