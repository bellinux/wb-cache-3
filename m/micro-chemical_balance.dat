40|$|The former {{analyses}} of autunite {{have not given}} the definite value of water content. In this paper the microgravimetric estimation of the water content of autunite from Nagatare (Fukuoka District) is reported. A small amount (11. 573 mg) of the pure mineral was dehydrated by desiccating agents and by heating at increasing temperatures. Losses of each procedure were determined with the <b>micro-chemical</b> <b>balance.</b> Table 1. Loss of autunite in weight after being dehydrated by desiccating agents and by heating at various temperatures. [table] The results obtained are shown in Table 1. The ignition with a burner expelled the total content of water amounting to 19. 15 %, which corresponds to 10. 12 moles {{of water in the}} sample. The formula of autunite is therefore assurned to be CaOUO_ 3 „Éê_ 2 O_ 50 H_ 2 O, which derives the moles of dehydration in each procedure as shown in the same table. The fluorescent property of the mineral too was observed through the treatments...|$|E
