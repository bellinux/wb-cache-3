500|$|The band {{worked with}} {{multiple}} guest vocalists and musicians, {{many of which}} were not included on the album's final cut. In working with vocalists, the Avalanches wanted to create vocals that meshed seamlessly with the music as if they could be samples. Jonathan Donahue of Mercury Rev provided vocals and <b>musical</b> <b>saw</b> instrumentation on multiple tracks. In addition, Kevin Parker of Tame Impala provided additional drumming on [...] "Going Home" [...] and violinist Warren Ellis was featured on [...] "Stepkids". Jean-Michel Bernard also provided some orchestration to a handful of tracks.

For Brown's vocals on [...] "The Wozard of Iz", he visited Sing Sing Studios in Melbourne and had an all-night recording session with the group. Chater was a fan of MF DOOM, specifically the album Madvillainy (2004) he made with Madlib. He sent him a track and received a reply 18 months later from DOOM stating he loved the track and wanted to provide vocals. The group was thrilled to work with Camp Lo on the track [...] "Because I'm Me". The Avalanches would always play Camp Lo's first record, Uptown Saturday Night (1997), at shows and even sampled it on Since I Left You.

500|$|With Brown and Damiani's departure, McCrea felt [...] "freer to experiment" [...] {{with the}} next album, 1998's Prolonging the Magic; he wrote and {{produced}} every song. As {{a result of this}} experimentation, the album was noted as [...] "loaded with spiced-up instrumentation, including a few new ingredients like the pedal steel guitar and <b>musical</b> <b>saw</b> thrown in for extra flavour". McCrea stated that he deliberately [...] "approached writing this record without the guitar as the central assumption of all life in the universe". Music Week described it as an [...] "inspired collection of leftfield rock", while Thor Christensen of The Dallas Morning News said that it [...] "brims with the same dry humor the Sacramento band displayed in past hits such as 'The Distance' and 'Rock and Roll Lifestyle': The leadoff track, 'Satan Is My Motor,' puts a devilish new spin on the rock 'n' roll car-song tradition, while 'When You Sleep' revolves around the question of what your fingers do {{while the rest of the}} body snoozes". Other reviewers were less complimentary, with Mike Pattenden in The Times writing that [...] "Prolonging the Magic suggests that [...] may well be destined to go down as one-hit wonders...While a handful stand out – the country waltz Mexico, You Turn the Screws and Hem of Your Garment – Prolonging the Magic shows McRea and company to be little more than an above average bar-room act. Cake are surviving on songwriting crumbs". The album peaked at number33 on the Billboard 200, was listed in The Columbian as the second best album of 1998, and eventually went platinum after shipping over 1million units.|$|E

2500|$|Fluorescences {{followed}} a year later; {{it increases the}} orchestral density with more wind and brass, and an enormous percussion section of 32 instruments for six players including a Mexican güiro, typewriters, gongs and other unusual instruments. The piece was composed for the Donaueschingen Festival of contemporary music of 1962, and its performance was regarded as provocative and controversial. Even the score appeared revolutionary; the form of graphic notation that Penderecki had developed rejected the familiar look of notes on a staff, instead representing music as morphing sounds. His intentions at this stage were quite Cagean: [...] "All I'm interested in is liberating sound beyond all tradition." [...] This preoccupation with sound culminated in De Natura Sonoris I, which frequently calls upon the orchestra to use non-standard playing techniques to produce original sounds and colours. A sequel, De Natura Sonoris II, was composed in 1971: with its more limited orchestra, it incorporates more elements of post-Romanticism than its predecessor. This foreshadowed Penderecki's renunciation of the avant-garde in the mid-1970s, although both pieces feature dramatic glissandos, dense clusters, and a use of harmonics, and unusual instruments (the <b>musical</b> <b>saw</b> features in the second piece).|$|E

2500|$|Arnott was a {{founding}} member of the band Goodtime Washboard Three, characterized as a regional one-hit jug band and as a vaudeville band. Arnott played banjo, Bruce Bratton played washtub bass, and Wayne Pope played washboard and <b>musical</b> <b>saw.</b> In 1959, the band played Friday nights at the Monkey Inn in Berkeley, California. In 1963, when Arnott was absent from the group for two years working in Japan, the band wrote a humorous song about Oakland, appropriately entitled [...] "Oakland", which gained regional popularity. With Dick Fagarstrom covering banjo, the single 45rpm record [...] "Oakland" [...] was played on many of the San Francisco Bay Area radio stations for a brief period, and has since settled into cult status, with occasional plays on eclectic radio shows such as that of Dr. Demento. Of its 1960s popularity, Bratton said [...] "It got enormous airplay." [...] The Goodtime Washboard Three was asked to perform the song for the Oakland City Council, and the group (with Arnott on banjo) played it from atop the marquee of the Tribune Tower, a performance seen by thousands. The band's quirky style and fame resulted in invitations to the Bohemian Grove where they met powerful people such as Richard Nixon and Henry Kissinger. Bratton later joked that he organized a meeting of all the Bohemian Democrats, held in a telephone booth. The band's first full album was entitled Don't Blame PG, Pal, recorded in 1964 at Fantasy Studios in Berkeley and released in 1965 by Fantasy Records. On April 1, 1967, the band appeared on the television show The Hollywood Palace, with Bing Crosby as guest host. Crosby introduced them by saying that he first heard the group play at the Bohemian Grove. Crosby joined the band for the last chorus of Oh By Jingo!.|$|E
