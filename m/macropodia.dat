50|$|Reviewing studies {{conducted}} by different authors, Hultgren and Stachowicz showed that some species are highly specialised in their choices of camouflage. For example, Pelia tumida decorates itself only with sponges; <b>Macropodia</b> rostrata and Libinia dubia choose the noxious alga Dictyota menstrualis in some places, while Inachus phalangium chooses the same alga {{for the most}} exposed parts of its body; and Stenocionops furcata selects the stinging sea anemone Calliactis tricolor for its carapace. The choice of noxious or stinging organisms as decorations implies that attaching them provides protection from predators by aposematism rather than by crypsis, and there is direct observational evidence for this, e.g. that octopuses in tanks avoided decorated crabs. The relationship of crab and organisms such as sea anemones used as decoration may be mutualistic, offering protection to the crab and food to the anemone.|$|E

Sampling was carried out during 25 h cycles to ascertain the flux of megalopae in relation to the main environmental (diel, tidal, tidal amplitude) cycles. The hypothesis that megalopae of some species may be using tidal-stream transport as a mechanism of re-invading the inlet was tested and the relationship between megalopal behaviour and life history strategy was analysed. In general, the flux of megalopae was higher during spring tides, but such differences were only statistically significant for Pisidia longicornis and Liocarcinus sp. 2 due to the considerable interdate variation. With the exception of <b>Macropodia</b> sp., megalopae were more abundant close to the bottom. The diel/tidal flux of most abundant species suggested two different patterns of behaviour: megalopae of Liocarcinus spp., Panopeus africanus, Uca tangeri and Brachynotus sexdentatus seemed to be re-invading the inlet (specially at nocturnal floods), while megalopae of Ilia nucleus, Nepinnotheres pinnotheres and <b>Macropodia</b> sp. may have been just looking for a suitable place for settlement. The first group corresponded to the species whose zoeal development occurs in open sea, and the second one to species that complete their life cycle within the studied system, suggesting a relationship between the duration of the larval phase and the life cycle strategy of the species...|$|E
40|$|INTRODUCTION Since April 1972 an {{ecological}} trawl-survey programme has been {{undertaken by the}} Netherlands Institute for Sea Research (NIOZ), Texel, in the southern North Sea with the R. V. "Aurelia". The main object is to obtain information on distribution, density, biomass and fluctuations of crawling or swimming demersal (epibenthic) fauna such as small fishes, shrimps, prawns, crabs, asteroids, ophiuroids and some gastropods, {{for the evaluation of}} the role of these carnivores in the benthic ecosystem of the southern North Sea. Sedimentological aspects of the area are described by Creutzberg & Postma (1979). Within the context of the present paper the most important feature is the mesh of 5 x 5 mm 2 of the cod end of the 51 / 2 m beam-trawl used and the extensive area of 5000 - 10, 000 m 2 covered during each haul. These exceptional circumstances resulted into faunistically interesting catches which gave rise to a cooperation with taxonomic specialists of the Rijksmuseum van Natuurlijke Historie (RMNH), Leiden. The present paper deals with decapod crustaceans, collected during "Aurelia"-cruises, which are considered to be scarce or rare in the southern North Sea, completed with data from bottom-samples and other sources. The species in question are: Pandalina brevirostris, Spirontocaris lilljeborgii, Alpheus macrocheles, Pontophilus spinosus, Pontophilus bispinosus, Galathea dispersa, Ebalia tuberosa, Ebalia tumefacta, Ebalia cranchii, Atelecyclus rotundatus, Monodaeus couchii, Callianassa subterranea, Callianassa tyrrhena, Upogeb ia stellata and Upogebia deltaura.

40|$|During {{the last}} years DNA barcoding has become a popular method of choice for {{molecular}} specimen identification. Here we present a comprehensive DNA barcode library of various crustacean taxa found in the North Sea, {{one of the most}} extensively studied marine regions of the world. Our data set includes 1, 332 barcodes covering 205 species, including taxa of the Amphipoda, Copepoda, Decapoda, Isopoda, Thecostraca, and others. This dataset represents the most extensive DNA barcode library of the Crustacea in terms of species number to date. By using the Barcode of Life Data Systems (BOLD), unique BINs were identified for 198 (96. 6 %) of the analyzed species. Six species were characterized by two BINs (2. 9 %), and three BINs were found for the amphipod species Gammarus salinus Spooner, 1947 (0. 4 %). Intraspecific distances with values higher than 2. 2 % were revealed for 13 species (6. 3 %). Exceptionally high distances of up to 14. 87 % between two distinct but monophyletic clusters were found for the parasitic copepod Caligus elongatus Nordmann, 1832, supporting the results of previous studies that indicated the existence of an overlooked sea louse species. In contrast to these high distances, haplotype-sharing was observed for two decapod spider crab species, <b>Macropodia</b> parva Van Noort & Adema, 1985 and <b>Macropodia</b> rostrata (Linnaeus, 1761), underlining the need for a taxonomic revision of both species. Summarizing the results, our study confirms the application of DNA barcodes as highly effective identification system for the analyzed marine crustaceans of the North Sea and represents an important milestone for modern biodiversity assessment studies using barcode sequence...|$|E

40|$|Various {{aspects of}} the {{reproductive}} anatomy of the spider crab Inachus phalangium are investigated utilizing light and electron microscopy. Spermatozoal ultrastructure reveals {{the presence of a}} glycocalyx in the peripheral region of the periopercular rim, never recorded before in crustacean sperm cells. Sperm cell morphological traits such as semi-lunar acrosome shape, centrally perforate and flat operculum, and absence of a thickened ring, are shared only with <b>Macropodia</b> longirostris, confirming a close phylogenetic relationship of these species and their separation from {{the other members of the}} family Majidae. Spermatozoa are transferred to females inside spermatophores of different sizes, but during ejaculate transfer, larger spermatophores might be ruptured by tooth-like structures present on the ejaculatory canal of the male first gonopod, releasing free sperm cells. Such a mechanism could represent the first evidence of a second form of sperm competition in conflict with sperm displacement, the only mechanism of sperm competition known among Brachyura, enabling paternity for both dominant and smaller, non-dominant, males. In addition, we propose several hypotheses concerning the remote and proximal causes of the existence of large seminal receptacles in females of I. phalangium. Among these, genetically diverse progeny, reduction of sexual harassment and phylogenetic retention seem the most plausible, while acquisition of nutrients from seminal fluids, demonstrated in other arthropods, and suggested by previous studies, could be discarded on the basis of the presented data. © 2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

40|$|A {{total of}} 17 species, in 14 genera of majids have been {{examined}} for sperm ultrastructure. The present account describes the sperm of six of these species, in two subfamilies: Pisinae-Sphenocarcinus orbiculatus and Sphenocarcinus stuckiae and Inachinae-Cyrtomaia furici, Grypacheus hyalinus, Platymaia rebierei and <b>Macropodia</b> longirostris. M. longirostris has the only eubrachyuran sperm in which the acrosome is known to depart radically from a subspheroidal form. The acrosome is semilunar in shape and is bordered by a very thin layer of cytoplasm and an unusually uniform, narrow band of chromatin. The apical surface of the acrosome is almost flat, though slightly concave, whereas the posterior surface forms a hemisphere, and is almost completely occupied by the thin, centrally perforate, electron dense operculum. The bulk of the acrosome consists of a homogeneous, moderately electron dense outer acrosome zone. This surrounds a small inner acrosome zone internal to which is an ellipsoidal, pale perforatorium capped by a central acrosome zone. Majid sperm are distinguished by a flattened and/or centrally depressed operculum; a further characteristic is that the pointed perforatorium is relatively short and frequently does not reach the operculum. They vary inter alia with regard to {{presence or absence of}} a posterior median process and, apparently, of centrioles and of microtubules in the nuclear arms, and in the number of these arms. Perforation of the operculum, seen in the Pisinae, is not constant in the Inachinae.

40|$|All larval {{stages and}} the first crab instar of Paradasygyius depressus (Bell) were {{obtained}} in laboratory culture. Larval development consists of two zoeal stages, followed by the megalopa. Each larval stage is described in detail. Beginning with the first zoea, the duration of each stage was 4 [...] 7 (4. 5 +/- 0. 7), 4 - 5 (4. 5 +/- 0. 5), and 7 days, the megalopa and first crab instar appearing 11 +/- 1 and 15 days after hatching, respectively. A phylogenetic analysis of 21 genera of Majidae is provided based on 34 zoeal and three megalopal characters. The phylogenetic analysis resulted in four equally parsimonious trees 173 steps long (CI = 0. 66, RI = 0. 71, and RC = 0. 47) supporting the monophyly of Oregoniinae, Majinae, and Inachinae (with the exclusion of Macrocheira de Haan incertae sedis). Based on general agreement of sister-group hypotheses, we provide sets of larval characters that define Oregoniinae, Majinae, and Inachinae. Our phylogenetic hypothesis suggests that Oregoniinae is the most basal clade within the Majidae, and Majinae and the clade (Epialtus H. Milne Edwards + Inachinae [excluding Macrocheira incertae sedis]) are sister taxa. Within Inachinae, all trees suggest that Inachus Weber and <b>Macropodia</b> Leach are sister taxa nested as the most derived clade, followed by Achaeus Leach, Pyromaia Stimpson, Paradasygyius Garth, Anasimus A.

40|$|Knowledge about species biology, distributions, and autecologies {{is based}} on {{accumulated}} information provided by identifying observers from diverse time periods and from sometimes somewhat isolated scientific cultures. Traditional taxonomic revisions bear witness of the inherent challenges of specimen identification and the efforts to obtain concordant species observations that actually refer to the same natural units. “Mislabelled” species {{is a growing concern}} in population management and food industries. There is also an emerging alertness in macro-ecology of bias in estimators of species occurrences and in biodiversity assessment and modelling due to misidentifications. Open access databases with DNA-barcodes are potentially powerful tools to discover conflicting identifications and may help in species recognition and in harmonizing the use of species taxonomies across research groups. Barcodes may also give taxonomists alerts about a need for integrative re-evaluation of taxa and their distributions. Such ideas are the background motivation for our DNA-barcoding of benthic animals from recent sampling on the West-African shelf conducted by the EAF-Nansen programme. We prepared 470 specimens of Decapoda and five Stomatopoda, in sum representing 133 identified species, for DNA-sequencing using the BOLD v 3 system. Sequences were obtained from 351 samples, including 107 (80 %) of the identified species. The BOLD-system assigned the sequences to 113 BINS (RATNASTINHAM & HEBERT, 2013) of which 64 BINS were taxonomically concordant and 33 were singletons. Amongst 16 taxonomically discordant BINs, one was due to a previous record with a junior synonym, four due to identical sequences of subspecies taxa or identification to genus only. Interestingly, some of the discordant BINs, such as our sequences of the crab Menippe nodifrons (Menippidae) contained conspecific matches with West-Atlantic sequences in BOLD whereas another matching sequence from GenBank had been identified as a Pilumnidae. The most striking conflicting identifications in BOLD were observed with respect to the genus <b>Macropodia,</b> showing a need for taxonomic resolution and revision.
