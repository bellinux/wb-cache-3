40|$|Abstract â€” This paper {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} optical signal-to-noise ratio (OSNR) optimization in optical networks. An analytical OSNR network model is developed for a general <b>multi-link</b> <b>configuration,</b> that includes the contribution of amplified spontaneous emission and crosstalk accumulation. An network OSNR optimization problem is formulated such that all channels maintain a desired individual OSNR level, while input optical power is minimized. An iterative, distributed algorithm for channel power control is proposed, which is shown to converge geometrically to the optimal solution. Convergence is proved for both synchronous and asynchronous operation. I...|$|E
40|$|The joint {{characterization}} of the multiple links becomes important for mesh topologies, relaying, distributed antennas, cooperative transmission, virtual MIMO etc. For that purpose simultaneous measurements are needed. Since a suited measurement setup requires multiple channel sounders, a very few of such campaigns have been conducted. A single-sounder approach {{can be considered as}} an attractive, less expensive alternative as long as environment stationarity can be insured between consecutive measurement runs. This contribution investigates the variability of large-scale parameters, such as delay and directional spreads, derived from measurements at 2. 53 GHz in an outdoor macro-cell scenario. A mobile receiver has been moved twice over the same track whereas the transmitter has been fixed. The large-scale parameters are estimated as averages within local stationarity regions corresponding to areas with a constant multi-path structure. The observed differences between tw o large-scale parameter sets are used to evaluate stationarity of the outdoor environment between repeated measurements. The reasonably low decorrelation levels have indicated that large-scale {{characterization of}} <b>multi-link</b> <b>configuration</b> can be performed sequentially with single sounding device...|$|E
5000|$|The Ridgeline has a four-wheel {{independent}} suspension with MacPherson struts {{in the front}} and a <b>multi-link</b> trailing arm <b>configuration</b> in the rear. [...] It has a turning diameter of 42.6 ft using variable power-assisted rack-and-pinion steering. [...] It has four-wheel disk brakes with 13.1 in ventilated front disks with floating twin piston calipers and 12.6 in solid rear disks with integrated emergency/parking drum brakes; the rear brakes use floating single piston calipers for the disks and dual opposing brake shoes for the drums. [...] The disk brakes are controlled via a four-channel Anti-lock Braking System (ABS) with Electronic Brakeforce Distribution and Brake Assist. [...] Although 60 mph to 0 stopping distances of 117 ft to 195 ft have been reported, the average appears to be between 140 ft and 147 ft.|$|R
