40|$|Sewer misconnections lead {{to direct}} {{discharge}} of foul sewage to surface waters, which conflicts {{with one of}} the fundamental aims of a separate sewer system - to prevent discharge of foul sewage to surface waters. Though misconnections are often thought to be a threat to receiving water bodies, and to achieving Water Framework Directive targets, they have received little study to date, and their ecological impacts remain unknown. Review of current knowledge of misconnections and their potential impacts in receiving waters identified key areas of research which are required to improve understanding of the <b>misconnection</b> problem. To fully understand the impacts of <b>misconnection</b> effluents in receiving waters, their impacts in biological communities must be considered. Diatoms, a group of organisms which are commonly used for ecological assessments, {{play an important role in}} freshwater ecosystems and exhibit many characteristics which make them ideal for use in investigating response to intermittent stresses. This thesis investigates the impacts of <b>misconnection</b> effluents in the diatom communities of receiving waters. Current methods to identify <b>misconnection</b> effluents in sewer systems lack sensitivity to <b>misconnection</b> effluents specifically, and suffer from issues of low sampling frequency. An inexpensive, passive, method for detecting <b>misconnection</b> effluents in sewer systems using optical brighteners produced very promising results, and is highly appropriate for use by the Environment Agency and Water companies, pending further validation. Exposure of diatom communities to detergent effluents in a microcosm study show that detergents cause significant decrease of algal total abundance and notable change in community composition a closed laboratory system. These effects correlate well with high surfactant concentration and alkalinity in the detergents, leading to the conclusion that these are key drivers of responses in the diatom community. Specific diatom species are identified as potential indicators of detergent pollution, showing strong increases in abundance when exposed to high detergent concentrations. Diatom communities exposed to <b>misconnection</b> effluents in the field in one catchment showed a shift in community composition toward more motile species, indicative of exposure to organic pollution discharged from the misconnected outfalls, however communities in three other catchments did not show any such response. Common diatom based monitoring measures do not respond to effluents from misconnected sewer outfalls, and diatom communities do not show the decrease in abundance or shifts in species composition which were observed in the laboratory. <b>Misconnection</b> effluents have potential to cause significant impacts in diatom communities. However, low frequency of discharge, short exposure period, and high dilution of effluents, prevent significant responses in the diatom community. In the upland streams investigated, misconnections do not pose a significant threat to diatom communities...|$|E

40|$|In {{a typical}} hub airport, {{incoming}} flights from many origins feed outgoing flights to many destinations. If an incoming flight is late, outgoing flights which are fed by {{it may also}} be delayed eventually. Alternately, planes may leave before some feeding flights arrive, thereby incurring high <b>misconnection</b> penalties. Clearly, if we plan for very long scheduled ground time between the last incoming flight and the first outgoing one, we can reduce the risk of unscheduled delays or misconnections. However, such a schedule may cost the airline too much in terms of idle personnel and equipment and will not be attractive to the passenger either. On the other hand, if we plan for very short scheduled ground time, we run the risk of excessive unscheduled delays, and/or <b>misconnection</b> penalties. In this paper we develop models designed to optimize the scheduled ground time under two pure policies (i) to wait as long as necessary to ensure all connections, and (ii) not to wait at all (i. e., pay <b>misconnection</b> penalties rather than delay penalties). The models can also be applied to similar problems such as express parcel deliveries and ground transportation hubs.

40|$|The {{impacts of}} misconnections on the organic and {{nutrient}} loadings to surface waters are assessed using specific household appliance data for two urban sub-catchments {{located in the}} London metropolitan region {{and the city of}} Swansea. Potential loadings of biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), soluble reactive phosphorus (PO 4 -P) and ammoniacal nitrogen (NH 4 -N) due to misconnections are calculated for three different scenarios based on the measured daily flows from specific appliances and either measured daily pollutant concentrations or average pollutant concentrations for relevant greywater and black water sources obtained from an extensive review of the literature. Downstream receiving water concentrations, together with the associated uncertainties, are predicted from derived <b>misconnection</b> discharge concentrations and compared to existing freshwater standards for comparable river types. Consideration of dilution ratios indicates that these would need to be of the order of 50 – 100 : 1 to maintain high water quality with respect to BOD and NH 4 -N following typical <b>misconnection</b> discharges but only poor quality for PO 4 -P is likely to be achievable. The main pollutant loading contributions to misconnections arise from toilets (NH 4 -N and BOD), kitchen sinks (BOD and PO 4 -P) washing machines (PO 4 -P and BOD) and, to a lesser extent, dishwashers (PO 4 -P). By completely eliminating toilet misconnections and ensuring misconnections from all other appliances do not exceed 2 %, the potential pollution problems due to BOD and NH 4 -N discharges would be alleviated but this would not be the case for PO 4 -P. In the event of a treatment option being preferred to solve the <b>misconnection</b> problem, it is shown that for {{an area the size of}} metropolitan Greater London, a sewage treatment plant with a Population Equivalent value approaching 900, 000 would be required to efficiently remove BOD and NH 4 -N to safely dischargeable levels but such a plant is unlikely to have the capacity to deal satisfactorily with incoming PO 4 -P loads from misconnections...|$|E

We present {{the case of a}} fully trained home hemodialysis patient who exsanguinated at home {{as a result of an}} incorrect wash back procedure. Case presentation The case involves a 67 year old male with a history of well controlled hypertension and impaired glucose tolerance. He commenced on peritoneal dialysis in 2006 following the development of end stage kidney failure secondary to focal segmental glomerulosclerosis. He transferred to hemodialysis due to peritoneal membrane failure in 2010, and successfully trained for home hemodialysis over a 20 week period. Following one month of uncomplicated dialysis at home, he was found deceased on his machine at home in the midst of dialysis. His death occurred during the wash back procedure performed using the “open circuit” method, and resulted from <b>misconnection</b> of the saline bag to the venous end of the extracorporeal blood circuit instead of the arterial end. This led to approximately 2. 3 L of his blood being pumped into the saline bag resulting in hypovolaemic shock and death from exsanguination. Conclusions Despite successful training, critical procedural errors can still be made by patients on home hemodialysis. In this case, the error involved <b>misconnection</b> of the saline bag for wash back. This case should prompt providers of home hemodialysis to review their training protocols and manuals. Manufacturers of dialysis machinery should be encouraged to design machines specifically for home hemodialysis, and consider distinguishing the arterial and venous ends of the extracorporeal blood circuit with colour coding or incompatible connectivity, to prevent occurrences such as these in the future. </p...|$|E

The study revealed severe sewage connections to storm drains; meanwhile, <b>misconnections</b> between surface water and storm drains were found to drive frequent non-stormwater pumping discharges at the outfall, producing a much larger volume of outfall flows in a short period. This paper presented a methodology to estimate quantities of inappropriate sewage flow, groundwater infiltration and river water backflow into the storm drains. It was concluded that inappropriate sewage discharge and groundwater seepage into storm drains were approximately 17, 860 m 3 /d (i. e., up to 51 % of the total sewage flow in the catchment) and 3624 m 3 /d, respectively, and surface water backflow was up to an average 28, 593 m 3 /d. On {{the basis of this}} work, end-of-storm pipe interceptor sewers of 0. 25 m 3 /s (i. e., 21, 600 m 3 /d) would be effective to tackle the problem of sewage connections and groundwater seepage to storm drains. Under this circumstance, the follow-up non-stormwater outfall pumping events indicate <b>misconnections</b> between surface water and storm drains, featuring pumping discharge equivalent to surface water backflow; hence the <b>misconnections</b> should be repaired.
