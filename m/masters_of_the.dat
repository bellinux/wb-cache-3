50|$|In contrast, the illuminations reflect <b>the</b> work <b>of</b> {{at least}} six {{different}} hands. The art historian Walter Oakeshott first identified and named these artists in 1945, referring to them as <b>the</b> <b>Master</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Leaping Figures, <b>the</b> <b>Master</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Apocrypha Drawings, <b>the</b> <b>Master</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Genesis Initial, <b>the</b> <b>Master</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Amalekite, <b>the</b> <b>Master</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Morgan Leaf, and <b>the</b> <b>Master</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Gothic Majesty.

500|$|Each {{dictator}} {{appointed a}} <b>Master</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Horse (magister equitum or <b>Master</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Knights), {{to serve as}} his most senior lieutenant. <b>The</b> <b>Master</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Horse had constitutional command authority (imperium) equivalent to a praetor, and often, when they authorized <b>the</b> appointment <b>of</b> a dictator, <b>the</b> senate specified who was to be <b>the</b> <b>Master</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Horse. In many respects, he functioned more as a parallel magistrate (like an inferior co-consul) than he did as a direct subordinate. Whenever a dictator's term ended, <b>the</b> term <b>of</b> his <b>Master</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Horse ended as well. Often, the dictator functioned principally as <b>the</b> <b>master</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> infantry (and thus the legions), while <b>the</b> <b>Master</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Horse (as the name implies) functioned as <b>the</b> <b>master</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cavalry. The dictator, while not elected by the people, was technically a magistrate since he was nominated by an elected consul. <b>The</b> <b>Master</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Horse was also technically a magistrate, since he was nominated by the dictator. Thus, both of these magistrates were referred to as [...] "Extraordinary Magistrates".|$|R
5|$|His family's nobility {{and wealth}} {{allowed him to}} fully pursue his {{inclination}} toward education. He learned music from the <b>masters</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> time (Damon or Pythocleides could have been his teacher) and he is considered {{to have been the}} first politician to attribute importance to philosophy. He enjoyed the company of the philosophers Protagoras, Zeno of Elea, and Anaxagoras. Anaxagoras, in particular, became a close friend and influenced him greatly.|$|E
5|$|In Theosophy, it is {{believed}} the Seven Stars of the Pleiades transmit the spiritual energy of the Seven Rays from the Galactic Logos to the Seven Stars of the Great Bear, then to Sirius.

5|$|As {{with other}} forms {{with a long}} history in many languages, many {{variations}} have been developed, including forms with a quasi-musical poetic diction in Urdu. Ghazals have a classical affinity with Sufism, and a number of major Sufi religious works are written in ghazal form. The relatively steady meter {{and the use of the}} refrain produce an incantatory effect, which complements Sufi mystical themes well.

50|$|<b>The</b> roots <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Master</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Aachen Altar in Cologne {{painting}} is beyond question. His proximity to <b>the</b> <b>Master</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Holy Clan, which is clear both in stylistic matters and in <b>the</b> adoption <b>of</b> subjects and motifs, {{leads to the}} assumption that <b>the</b> <b>Master</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Aachen Altar was educated in <b>the</b> workshop <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Master</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Holy Clan. <b>The</b> <b>Master</b> <b>of</b> St Severin also had an important influence on <b>the</b> <b>Master</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Aachen Altar, as similarities in their figures and painting methods indicate. A partnership as journeymen in this workshop is possible. <b>The</b> mature works <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Master</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Aachen Altar, such as the Mary panels, show clear influence from <b>the</b> <b>Master</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Saint Bartholomew Altarpiece. Further afield, the painter has taken important hints from the Netherlandish painters, such as <b>the</b> art <b>of</b> Hugo van der Goes.|$|R

5|$|Krishna worship or reverence {{has been}} adopted by several new {{religious}} movements since the 19thcentury, and he is sometimes {{a member of an}} eclectic pantheon in occult texts, along with Greek, Buddhist, biblical, and even historical figures.

5|$|More recent {{research}} from art historians such as Lorne Campbell relies on X-ray and infrared photography {{to develop an}} understanding of the techniques and materials used by the painters. The conservation of the Ghent Altarpiece in the mid-1950s pioneered methodologies and scholarship in technical studies. Examination of paint layers and underlayers was later applied to other Netherlandish works, allowing for more accurate attributions. Van Eyck's work, for example, typically shows underdrawings unlike Christus' work. These discoveries, too, hint at the relationships between the <b>masters</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> first rank and those in the following generations, with Memling's underdrawings clearly showing van der Weyden's influence.|$|E
5|$|The crop produce {{from these}} {{plantations}} were generally exported {{to other countries}} from Singapore {{with the assistance of}} Chinese merchants based in that city. From the 1860s onwards, many of these Kangchu chalked up debts and began to sell their property rights to these merchants or to larger business magnates (Kongsi in Teochew) based in Singapore, who were known to the locals as Tuan Sungai (literally <b>Masters</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> River). The Kangchu then were often hired as supervisors or managers by the merchants to keep watch on the day-to-day operations of the gambier and pepper plantations. Temenggong Abu Bakar began to issue contract-style letters of recognition to these Kangchu; the letters were known by their Malay name Surat Tauliah.|$|E
5|$|By 1600, {{irrigated}} paddy {{fields were}} developed in the central highland Betsileo Kingdom, and were extended with terraced paddies throughout the neighboring Kingdom of Imerina a century later. The rising intensity of land cultivation and the ever-increasing demand for zebu pasturage had largely transformed the central highlands from a forest ecosystem to grassland by the 17th century. The oral histories of the Merina people, who may have arrived in the central highlands between 600 and 1000 years ago, describe encountering an established population they called the Vazimba. Probably the descendants of an earlier and less technologically advanced Austronesian settlement wave, the Vazimba were assimilated or expelled from the highlands by the Merina kings Andriamanelo, Ralambo and Andrianjaka in the 16th and early 17th centuries. Today, {{the spirits of the}} Vazimba are revered as tompontany (ancestral <b>masters</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> land) by many traditional Malagasy communities.|$|E

5|$|Famous {{painters}} included Ni Zan and Dong Qichang, {{as well as}} the Four <b>Masters</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Ming dynasty, Shen Zhou, Tang Yin, Wen Zhengming, and Qiu Ying. They drew {{upon the}} techniques, styles, and complexity in painting achieved by their Song and Yuan predecessors, but added techniques and styles. Well-known Ming artists could make a living simply by painting due to the high prices they demanded for their artworks and the great demand by the highly cultured community to collect precious works of art. The artist Qiu Ying was once paid 2.8kg (100oz) of silver to paint a long handscroll for the eightieth birthday celebration of the mother of a wealthy patron. Renowned artists often gathered an entourage of followers, some who were amateurs who painted while pursuing an official career and others who were full-time painters.|$|E
5|$|The Inn {{is run by}} Pension, its {{ultimate}} governing body. The name is peculiar to Gray's Inn—at Lincoln's Inn the governing body is called the Council, and at the Inner and Middle Temples {{it is called the}} Parliament. The name was used for the governing bodies of three of the Inns of Chancery—Barnard's Inn, Clement's Inn and New Inn. In Gray's Inn the Readers, when they existed, were required to attend Pension meetings, and other barristers were at one point welcome to, although only the Readers would be allowed to speak. Pension at Gray's Inn is made up of the <b>Masters</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Bench, and the Inn as a whole is headed by the Treasurer, a senior Bencher.

5|$|The bokuseki style {{developed}} from Song Dynasty calligraphy. It was brought from China to Japan, together with Zen Buddhism, starting with Eisai in 1191. Late-12th century works imported from China were highly regarded in Japan; subsequently Japanese priests began producing their own bokuseki in the 13th and 14th centuries. Later bokuseki {{became part of}} the zen practice and served as meditation help. They were often mounted on hanging scrolls, and displayed in temples and tea rooms. The master of the Japanese tea ceremony Sen no Rikyū considered them crucial to the tea ceremony {{in the sense that they}} put the participants in the right frame-of-mind. Bokuseki gained in importance through the chanoyu in the Muromachi and Momoyama periods. Daitō Kokushi and Musō Soseki, both from the Rinzai school of Zen Buddhism, were the most famous bokuseki <b>masters</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> time.|$|E
5|$|The two {{versions}} of Ernoul's chronicle tell different stories about John's ascent to the throne of Jerusalem. According to one version, the leading lords of Jerusalem sent envoys to France in 1208 asking Philip II to select a French nobleman as a husband for their queen Maria. Taking {{advantage of the opportunity}} to rid himself of John, Philip II suggested him. In the other version an unnamed knight encouraged the Jerusalemite lords to select John, who accepted their offer with Philip's consent. John visited Pope Innocent III in Rome. The pope donated 40,000 marks for the defence of the Holy Land, stipulating that John could spend the money only with the consent of the Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem and the grand <b>masters</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Knights Templar and the Knights Hospitaller.|$|E
5|$|Barry Lyndon (1975) is an {{adaptation}} of William Makepeace Thackeray's The Luck of Barry Lyndon (also known as Barry Lyndon), a picaresque novel about the adventures of an 18th-century Irish rogue and social climber. John Calley of Warner Bros. agreed in 1972 to invest $2.5 million into the film, on condition that Kubrick approach major Hollywood stars, to ensure it of success. Like previous films, Kubrick and his art department conducted {{an enormous amount of}} research, and he went from knowing very little about the 18th century {{at the start of the}} production to becoming an expert on it. Extensive photographs were taken of locations and artwork in particular, and paintings were meticulously replicated from works of the great <b>masters</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> period in the film. The film was shot on location in Ardmore, County Waterford, Ireland, beginning in the autumn of 1973, at a cost of $11 million with a cast and crew of 170. The decision to shoot in Ireland stemmed from the fact that it still retained many buildings from the 18th century period which England lacked. The production was problematic from the start, plagued with heavy rain and political strife involving Northern Ireland at the time. After Kubrick received death threats from the IRA in the New Year of 1974 due to the shooting scenes with English soldiers, he fled Ireland with his family on a ferry from Dún Laoghaire under an assumed identity, and filming resumed in England.|$|E
