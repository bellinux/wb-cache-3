50|$|The Mallock {{machine was}} an {{electrical}} analog computer built in 1933 to solve simultaneous linear differential equations. It used coupled transformers, with numbers of turns digitally {{set up to}} +/-1000 and solved sets of up to 10 linear differential equations. It was built by Rawlyn Richard Manconchy Mallock of Cambridge University. The Mallock machine was contemporary with the <b>mechanical</b> <b>differential</b> <b>analyser,</b> which was also used at Cambridge during the late 1930s and 1940s.|$|E
5000|$|Mechanical integrators were key {{elements}} in the <b>mechanical</b> <b>differential</b> <b>analyser,</b> used to solve practical physical problems. Mechanical integration mechanisms were also used in control systems such as regulating flows or temperature in industrial processes. Mechanisms such as the ball-and-disk integrator were used both for computation in differential analysers and as components of instruments such as naval gun directors, flow totalizers and others. A planimeter is a mechanical devices used for performing integration on data given in graphical form.|$|E
25|$|The <b>differential</b> <b>analyser,</b> a <b>mechanical</b> analog {{computer}} designed to solve differential equations by integration, used wheel-and-disc mechanisms {{to perform the}} integration. In 1876 James Thomson had already discussed the possible construction of such calculators, {{but he had been}} stymied by the limited output torque of the ball-and-disk integrators. In a differential analyzer, the output of one integrator drove the input of the next integrator, or a graphing output. The torque amplifier was the advance that allowed these machines to work. Starting in the 1920s, Vannevar Bush and others developed <b>mechanical</b> <b>differential</b> analyzers.|$|R
50|$|A <b>differential</b> <b>analyser</b> {{may have}} been used in the {{development}} of the bouncing bomb, used to attack German hydroelectric dams during World War II. <b>Differential</b> <b>analysers</b> have also been used in the calculation of soil erosion by river control authorities.|$|R
5000|$|It is {{estimated}} that [...] "about 15 Meccano model <b>Differential</b> <b>Analysers</b> were built for serious work by scientists and researchers around the world". More recently, building <b>differential</b> <b>analysers</b> with Meccano parts has become a popular project among serious Meccano hobbyists. An example is the <b>differential</b> <b>analyser</b> built at Marshall University, which is now used for educational purposes, in that a student not only solves a differential equation but also becomes the [...] "calculator" [...] by operating the machine, and so develops {{a better understanding of}} what a differential equation is.|$|R

5000|$|In the United States, further <b>differential</b> <b>analysers</b> {{were built}} at the Ballistic Research Laboratory in Maryland and in the {{basement}} of the Moore School of Electrical Engineering at the University of Pennsylvania during the early 1940s. The latter was used extensively in the computation of artillery firing tables prior to the invention of the ENIAC, which, in many ways, was modelled on the <b>differential</b> <b>analyser.</b> Also in the early 1940s, with Samuel H. Caldwell, one of the initial contributors during the early 1930s, Bush attempted an electrical, rather than mechanical, variation, but the digital computer built elsewhere had much greater promise and the project ceased. In 1947, UCLA installed a <b>differential</b> <b>analyser</b> built for them by General Electric at a cost of $125,000. By 1950, this machine had been joined by three more. The UCLA differential analyzer appeared in 1951's When Worlds Collide, where it was called, euphemistically, [...] "DA".|$|R

50|$|Although Manchester {{was later}} {{to be known}} as the birthplace of the {{electronic}} computer, Douglas Hartree made an earlier contribution building a <b>differential</b> <b>analyser</b> in 1933. The machine was used for ballistics calculations as well calculating railway timetables.|$|R

5000|$|In 1934, Meccano {{began to}} be used in the {{construction}} of <b>differential</b> <b>analysers,</b> a type of analogue computer used to solve differential equations which has long since become obsolete. Though invented on paper in the 19th century, the first such machine had only been built in 1931, and normally they would be built by specialist manufacturers, at great cost. For example, in 1947, UCLA in the US installed a <b>differential</b> <b>analyser</b> built for them by General Electric at a cost of $125,000. However, a [...] "proof of concept" [...] model of a <b>differential</b> <b>analyser</b> which made extensive use of Meccano parts was built at Manchester University, UK, in 1934, by Douglas Hartree and Arthur Porter: use of Meccano meant that the machine was cheap to build, and it proved [...] "accurate enough for the solution of many scientific problems". This machine is now in the Science Museum, Exhibition Road, London, England. A similar machine built by J.B. Bratt at Cambridge University in 1935 is now in the Museum of Transport and Technology (MOTAT) collection in Auckland, New Zealand. A memorandum written for the British military's Armament Research Department in 1944 describes how this same machine was modified during World War II for improved reliability and enhanced capability, and identifies its wartime applications as including research on the flow of heat, explosive detonations, and simulations of transmission lines. After a lengthy period of neglect, a restoration effort began in 2003, and a successful [...] "full run through" [...] of this machine was completed on December 16, 2008.|$|R

50|$|The ball-and-disk {{integrator}} is a {{key component}} of many advanced mechanical computers. Through simple mechanical means, it performs continual integration of the value of an input. Typical uses were the measurement of area or volume of material in industrial settings, range-keeping systems on ships, and tachometric bombsights. The addition of the torque amplifier by Vannevar Bush led to the <b>differential</b> <b>analysers</b> of the 1930s and 1940s.|$|R

He used a <b>differential</b> <b>analyser</b> in his PhD studies, an early form of computer, and purchased the machine in 1948 for £100.

Whale was invited by Bill Pickering to the Goddard Space Flight Center to undertake research on the reasons for loss of communication when rockets pass through the ionosphere.
