40|$|Cover crop use in {{vineyards}} {{can affect}} both vine vigor and must and wine quality {{because of the}} competition for soil nutrients and water. Our objective was to study the short-term effects of a cover crop on the nitrate (NO 3 -) -nitrogen (N) availability throughout the grapevine vegetative cycle, the grapevine and cover crop N uptake, and the yield and <b>must</b> <b>quality.</b> By short-term effects we mean the first crop cycle after planting the cover crop. The experiment was set in 2009 on a cv. Tempranillo vineyard planted in a Oxyaquic Xerorthent soil. The soil had not been fertilized with N since 2000, and two types of soil management were studied: (1) conventional tillage (CT) and (2) barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) cover crop (B). Soil samples were taken in March (bud break), June (bloom), July (setting), and August (veraison) of 2009, and the extractable NO 3 [...] N was determined. At bloom and veraison, N contents in both blade and petiole were determined. At bloom the grapevine N uptake was estimated using the aerial parts (leaves, shoots, and bunches), and for the cover crop N uptake was determined. Total yield, bunch, and shoot weight as well as must anthocyanin and polyphenol contents were determined. Soil NO 3 [...] N availability decreased in the cover crop from June until August, with the reduction being similar to the cover crop N uptake. Also N contents in both petiole and blade decreased in the cover crop at veraison. Regarding <b>must</b> <b>quality,</b> the cover crop increased the anthocyanin content.

40|$|ABSTRACT: In Europe, many {{autochthonous}} grapevines (Vitis vinifera L.) {{are only}} cultivated at local scale, but {{play a very}} important economic role due to their strict relation with terroir and wine tipicity. In this study, it was pursued to evaluate the influence of several factors on performance of Moll, the main autochthonous white variety of Majorca, {{by means of the}} data-base coming from a clonal preselection. The effects of multiple virus infections, vintage and vineyard components were studied by univariate linear models and principal component analy-sis, starting from measurement of production and <b>must</b> <b>quality</b> parameters of several vines located in 14 vineyards belonging to two appellations during four consecutive years (2001 - 2004). Absence of multiple virus infections, double cordon system, high clay content and Useful Water Reserve in soils have enhanced vine production without inducing considerable alterations in sugar accumulation in berries and acidity. Moll variety presented great viticultural and oenological potentials. Fertile and deep soils should be preferred in order to maximize production. Also, the use of certified propagation material is strongly recommended. However, further investigations are required to optimize <b>must</b> <b>quality</b> by opportune managements. This study does not provide only essential information to improve Moll cultivation in Majorca, but it also represents a useful example to analyze grapevine varieties that are endemically infected by viruses. In fact, in such situations, it may be supposed an insidious interference by viruses on terroir and wine tipicity...|$|E

40|$|Nitrogen (N) is {{the main}} {{nutrient}} affecting the yield of the grapevine and its must and wine quality. However, little information exists about the optimum nitrate (NO 3 -) -N levels for vineyard soils in semiarid climatic conditions. We selected 14 vineyards of the cultivar Tempranillo (Vitis vinifera L.), with ages ranging from 10 to 25 years and located in the lower Najerilla River area (Rioja AOC). There were no climatic variations within the study area. Soil was sampled at depths of 0 - 15 and 15 - 45 cm at vineyard bloom (29 June 2010) when the grapevines peaked in their N demand, and the extractable NO 3 [...] N in soil was determined. Nitrogen contents in both blade and petiole tissues were determined at veraison (23 August 2010). Anthocyanins and polyphenols content in the must were determined just before harvest. Finally, yield parameters such as grape weight per vine and shoot weight per vine were determined. The soil NO 3 [...] N was significantly correlated with the N content in blade and petiole tissues. Also the soil NO 3 [...] N contents had a significant correlation with yield parameters. Regarding must, the soil NO 3 [...] N was negatively correlated with anthocyanins and polyphenols concentrations, so it seems that a soil with high NO 3 [...] N availability decreases <b>must</b> <b>quality.</b> Therefore in these conditions, {{the determination of the}} available soil NO 3 [...] N at vine flowering could be an indicator of vine N nutritional status, potential yield, and <b>must</b> <b>quality.</b> These preliminary results indicate that more studies are needed to establish an adequate soil NO 3 [...] N content to obtain must of the highest quality. © 2013 Copyright Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

40|$|To {{obtain the}} best <b>must</b> <b>quality,</b> winegrowers must harvest uniform batches of grapes, thus they might define sub-units of the {{vineyard}} and {{treat them as}} separate management units for cultivation and harvest. The objectives of this work were {{to determine if there}} were variations of soil properties that could be arranged into different units of relative uniformity and separated from each other by discrete boundaries, and if there was a significant relationship between those units and the vegetative development and yield components of the grapevines. A soil index that is a linear combination of four soil characteristics was constructed and an interpolation method allowed the definition of soil areas with relative uniformity. These areas were significantly correlated with the vine growth that, in turn, had a significant correlation with the yield components of the vines. This methodology might prove useful to define areas within vineyards where the vegetative development and yields warrant a differentiated management within the vineyard.

Genes involved in hexose metabolism and transport, cell wall composition, and secondary metabolism (particularly the phenolic and terpene compound pathways) were similarly regulated in both processes. This work provides the first comprehensive analysis of the molecular events underpinning post-harvest withering and could help to define markers for different withering processes...|$|E

Seven cover crop treatments including a clean-cultivated control were {{applied in the}} fall of 2003 and their impact on vines was monitored in 2004 and 2005. Competition with grapevines was assessed by measuring soil moisture, vine growth, vine water status, vine nutrient status, yield, and <b>must</b> <b>quality</b> over two years with typical weather patterns for the region. Despite large treatment differences in cover crop biomass and N contributions to the soil from mowed residues, cover crops had little measurable influence on vine growth or fruit quality. Small differences in alleyway soil water content, leaf nitrogen, and juice YANC were found between different treatments; however, no cover-cropped treatment differed from the clean-cultivated control. Alleyway cover crops managed by spring and summer mowing do not appear to compete significantly with established ‘Pinot noir’ grapevines in western Oregon vineyards. Therefore, advantages of using cover crops (e. g. protection against soil erosion and addition to soil organic matter) can be realized without impacting vine productivity or juice quality. The long term impact of certain cover crops, including the clover mix we used, could result in the supply of too much N to vines and this aspect should be further examined...|$|E
40|$|Aluminium {{toxicity}} {{has been}} {{recognized as one of}} the most common causes of reduced grape yields in vineyard acid soils. The main aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of two liming materials, i. e. dolomitic lime and sugar foam, on a vineyard cultivated in an acid soil. The effects were studied in two soil layers (0 - 30 and 30 - 60 cm), as well as on leaf nutrient contents, <b>must</b> <b>quality</b> properties and grape yield, in an agricultural soil dedicated to Vitis vinifera L. cv. ‘Mencía’ cultivation. Data management and analysis were performed using analysis of variance (ANOVA). As liming material, sugar foam was more efficient than dolomitic limestone because sugar foam promoted the highest decrease in soil acidity properties at the same calcium carbonate equivalent dose. However, potassium contents in vines organs, including leaves and berries, seemed to decrease as a consequence of liming, with a concomitant increase in must total acidity. Soil available phosphorus also decreased as a consequence of liming, especially with sugar foam, though no effects were observed in plants. For these reasons fertilization of this soil with K and P is recommended along with liming. Grape yields in limed soils increased, although non-significantly, by 30 %. This research has therefore provided an important opportunity to advance in our understanding of the effects of liming on grape quality and production in acid soils...|$|E
