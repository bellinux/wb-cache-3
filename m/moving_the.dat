5|$|Prior to 1847, Detroit {{fought to}} {{maintain}} the Capitol within its jurisdiction, but communities in the growing {{western part of the}} state had many reasons for wanting a move inland, including the need to increase defensibility by <b>moving</b> <b>the</b> state government away from the Canada–US border. Detroit had been occupied during the War of 1812, and the border area of Michigan of less than a mile between Detroit and Windsor, Ontario, at the Detroit River continued to be occupied by British troops on both banks.

5|$|The {{office of}} {{governor}} {{was established by}} the first New York State Constitution in 1777. The governor was originally for a term of three years, though the constitution did not specify when the term began. A 1787 law set {{the start of the}} term at July 1. The New York State Constitutional Convention of 1821 amended the state constitution, reducing the term of office to two years, <b>moving</b> <b>the</b> election to November, and <b>moving</b> <b>the</b> beginning {{and the end of the}} term to coincide with the calendar year. An 1874 amendment extended the term of office back to three years, but the 1894 constitution again reduced it to two years.

In motorcycle racing, leaning the torso, <b>moving</b> <b>the</b> body, and projecting a knee {{to the inside of the}} turn relative to the bike can also cause an aerodynamic yawing moment that facilitates entering and rounding the turn.|$|E

40|$|The flash-lag {{effect is}} a visual misperception of a {{position}} of a flash relative {{to that of a}} moving object: Even when both are at the same position, the flash is reported to lag behind <b>the</b> <b>moving</b> object.

A further experiment revealed that this offset in the saccades to <b>the</b> <b>moving</b> object was eliminated when the whole background flashed. This result indicates that saccadic offsets to <b>the</b> <b>moving</b> stimulus critically depend on the spatially distinctive flash in the vicinity of <b>the</b> <b>moving</b> object. <b>The</b> results are incompatible with current theoretical explanations of the flash-lag effect, such as the motion extrapolation account.
