5|$|The {{growth of}} the new <b>middle</b> <b>class</b> in Syria fueled discontent since the {{traditional}} elite dominated the agrarian sector – the largest {{sector of the economy}} – and created most of the wealth.

40|$|The article {{deals with}} the {{problems}} of defining <b>middle</b> <b>classes.</b> Theoretical principles of social and <b>class</b> structures, including <b>middle</b> <b>classes,</b> are examined. The criteria of reckoning some hired workers as <b>middle</b> <b>classes</b> worked out on the basis of normative methodology (normative criteria) are submitted, the most important of them being educational qualifications, occupation, personal income and provision of housing. Methods of statistical and sociologic analysing data are applied. The results of analysing the conformity of the hired workers to the normative criteria of representing <b>middle</b> <b>classes</b> are produced. It is determined that today heads of organizations and their subdivisions as well as certified top and middle management specialists representing <b>middle</b> <b>classes</b> comprise only 2 - 3 per cent {{of the total number of}} the hired workers. It should be noted that there are practically no-one among them who has got a family with two and more children. The low level of wages is the main reason for that.

40|$|Purpose - The paper aims to {{discover}} {{the role of the}} <b>middle</b> <b>classes</b> {{in the development of the}} ethnic minorities of China, given the importance of the <b>middle</b> <b>classes</b> in international economic development in the modern age. Design/methodology/approach - The paper offers a definition of the "middle classes", including both the economic and political aspects. It looks at these classes among the ethnic minorities of China through fieldwork and printed statistics and materials. Findings - The ethnic minorities were 8. 41 per cent of the total population of China, according to the 2000 census. The paper finds that there are emerging <b>middle</b> <b>classes</b> among the ethnic minorities, especially some of them, including the Uygurs and Koreans of China. These <b>middle</b> <b>classes</b> are centres of entrepreneurship among the ethnic minorities, promoting development and modernization, but also intensifying inequalities. Their role is mainly economic, but also political; for example, there is some material on the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) in general and among the ethnic minorities in particular. There is some discussion on literacy and education among the ethnic minorities, on the grounds that <b>middle</b> <b>classes</b> do not emerge in the modern age without education. Originality/value - Although there is some research on the role of the <b>middle</b> <b>classes</b> in recent Chinese development, this is the first time that such a concept has been applied to the ethnic minorities.

40|$|This chapter {{examines}} changing {{social attitudes}} in post-apartheid South Africa, asking whether the African <b>middle</b> <b>classes</b> have distinctive social attitudes, relative to poorer or lower class African people, whether this {{has changed over}} the 2000 s, and thus how the rapid growth of the African <b>middle</b> <b>classes</b> is affecting social and political life. The chapter uses survey data (from the Institute for Justice and Reconciliation's South African Reconciliation Barometer) to show that the African <b>middle</b> <b>classes</b> assess much more positively than the poor the economic changes that have taken place in post-apartheid South Africa, and that this differential has grown over time. The <b>middle</b> <b>classes</b> are aware of their privilege, but may underestimate the challenges facing the poor. They are also more positive about improved inter-racial relations since 1994, perhaps because they enjoy very much more inter-racial interaction than do the poor. In terms of public policy, the <b>middle</b> <b>classes</b> support affirmative action more strongly, but {{are also more likely to}} say that the government does too much for people and probably see less need for active policies around employment creation. Simple multivariate models indicate uneven class and race effects on selected social attitudes. Overall, the growth of the African <b>middle</b> <b>classes</b> seems to be good for race relations but may reduce the likelihood of pro-poor policies to challenge inequalities of class...|$|R
5|$|Originally {{a working}} class town, {{there was an}} influx of <b>middle</b> <b>class</b> people in the mid-19th century when {{businessmen}} began using Sale as a commuter town. Since then, Sale has had {{a greater proportion of}} <b>middle</b> <b>class</b> residents than the national average. In 1931, 22.7% of Sale's population was <b>middle</b> <b>class</b> compared with 14% in England and Wales, and by 1971, this had increased to 36.3% compared with 24% nationally. Parallel to this increase in the middle classes of Sale was the decline of the working class population. In 1931, 20.3% were working class compared with 36% in England and Wales; by 1971, this had decreased to 15.4% in Sale and 26% nationwide. The rest of the population was made up of clerical workers and skilled manual workers.

40|$|The new Belgian Socialist Party, the {{successor}} to the Labour Party, expected the workers of all levels to join the socialist movement in October 1945, at the Victory Congress. Actually, the BSP was willing to extend its electorate to the <b>middle</b> <b>classes,</b> which had hitherto mainly voted for the SCP (the Christian Party). Yet, these classes' integration into the socialist movement still had to cross several obstacles. The <b>middle</b> <b>classes</b> were not receptive {{at all to the}} socialist message and they definitely did not trust a so-called Marxist, collectivist and control-minded party. They resented the socialist distributive justice that would support the labourers to the disadvantage of the independent employees. As a government party, the BSP is thought to have introduced many unpopular measures such as the reduction of the benefits, the reinforcement of price control, the creation of an establishment law, and the increase of the cost of salaries {{as a result of the}} introduction of a Social Security system. The opposition to a rapprochement was strong among members of the <b>middle</b> <b>classes</b> but also among socialists. Many socialists were loyal to the Marxist doctrine and to the co-operatives and they therefore refused to protect the interests of the <b>middle</b> <b>classes</b> by means of party rules. According to them, the BSP had to remain dedicated to the labour class. That is why the socialist decisions in favour of the <b>middle</b> <b>classes</b> were limited to earlier electoral declarations. No concrete decisions were considered. The electoral defeat following the elections of June 1949, however, led the BSP gradually to modify its attitude. The socialist leaders realised that the defeat was partly to be blamed on their failure to draw on the <b>middle</b> <b>classes.</b> At the socialist congress of November 1949, the party declared it would pay more attention to the independent employees so as to break the clerical monopoly in the <b>middle</b> <b>classes.</b> The congress avoided the problem generated by the doctrine and decided to create a Counter of deposits and credit for the <b>middle</b> <b>classes.</b> A first branch office was established in 1950 in the province of Brabant. And there were several to follow. At the same time, the socialist commission of the <b>middle</b> <b>classes</b> increased its activities and refined the propaganda among the <b>middle</b> <b>classes.</b> There were workshops for independent workers and the needs of the <b>middle</b> <b>classes</b> found a voice in the socialist party programme. Also, several socialist proposals of law were meant to secure pensions for the independent workers. The new pension legislation, passed in 1954, included an arrangement for independent workers. The eventual rapprochement between the <b>middle</b> <b>classes</b> and the BSP might not have come about if it had not been for the decline of the Common socialist action and the decline of the co-operatives. The excellent electoral results of the BSP in 1954 were the most salient proof of the success of this policy. SCOPUS: re. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R
