5|$|During the {{streaming}} of the series, Silverman {{criticized the}} animation {{because of the}} low lighting levels that might <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>hard</b> to understand. Hiroko Yamamura from Japanator noted the series' high budget and praised the animation style and the focus on details and technology. She was attracted by its premise and expected the quality to remain consistent across the entire series. Similarly, Jacob Hope Chapman from ANN praised the animation for its high quality. Episode 18, which {{is known for its}} flawed animation, was improved for the home media release of the series.|$|E

25|$|Restless legs {{syndrome}} (RLS) is {{a disorder}} that causes a strong urge to move one's legs. There {{is often an}} unpleasant feeling in the legs that improves somewhat with moving them. Occasionally the arms may also be affected. The feelings generally happen when at rest and therefore can <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>hard</b> to sleep. Due to the disturbance in sleep, people with RLS may have daytime sleepiness, low energy, irritability, and a depressed mood. Additionally, many have limb twitching during sleep.|$|E

25|$|In 1991, United States Attorney General Dick Thornburgh {{resigned}} {{to run for}} a Senate seat in Pennsylvania, one made vacant by John Heinz's death in a helicopter crash. Rove's company worked for the campaign, but it ended with an upset loss to Democrat Harris Wofford. Rove subsequently sued Thornburgh alleging non-payment for services rendered. The Republican National Committee, worried that the suit would <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>hard</b> to recruit good candidates, urged Rove to back off. When Rove refused, the RNC hired Kenneth Starr to write an amicus brief on Thornburgh's behalf. After a trial in Austin, Rove prevailed. Karl Rove & Co. v. Thornburgh was heard by U.S. Federal Judge Sam Sparks (who had been appointed by George H.W. Bush in 1991).|$|E
25|$|For {{many years}} from the 1950s onwards, vast dams and {{irrigation}} schemes were constructed, causing a massive rise in water-borne infections from schistosomiasis. The detailed specifications laid out in various UN documents since the 1950s could have minimized this problem. Irrigation schemes can be designed to <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>hard</b> for the snails to colonize the water and to reduce the contact with the local population. Even though guidelines on how to design these schemes to minimise {{the spread of the}} disease had been published years before, the designers were unaware of them. The dams appear to have reduced the population of the large migratory prawn Macrobrachium. After the construction of fourteen large dams, greater increases in schistosomiasis occurred in the historical habitats of native prawns than in other areas. Further, at the 1986 Diama Dam on the Senegal River, restoring prawns upstream of the dam reduced both snail density and the human schistosomiasis reinfection rate.|$|E
25|$|The fourth Test, {{in front}} of Hutton's home crowd, was Hutton's least {{successful}} of the series. Having been put into bat by Hassett, the first time an Australian captain had fielded first against England since 1909, Hutton was bowled second ball by a Yorker from Lindwall. England never recovered, batting very slowly to score 167 and after the first innings, Australia led by 99 with three days left. Hutton scored only 25 in the second innings but England batted for a long time, assisted by rain, leaving Australia 177 in 115 minutes to win the game. The tourists were winning easily when Hutton asked Bailey to use the negative tactic of leg theory, bowling wide of leg stump to <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>hard</b> to score runs, while using a long run-up to waste time. Only twelve overs were bowled in the last 45 minutes, then considered slow, Australia lost a wicket and the tactics resulted in Australia being 30 short of their target when the game ended. Wisden noted that only a defensive policy had prevented England losing. Hutton was criticised for negativity by the Australian press, but Bill Bowes wrote that {{the gravity of the}} situation justified Hutton's tactics.|$|E

25|$|Bureaucratic {{structures}} {{have many}} levels of management ranging from senior executives to regional managers, {{all the way}} to department store managers. Since there are many levels, decision-making authority has to pass through more layers than flatter organizations. A bureaucratic organization has rigid and tight procedures, policies and constraints. This kind of structure is reluctant to adapt or change what they have been doing since the company started. Organizational charts exist for every department, and everyone understands who is in charge and what their responsibilities are for every situation. Decisions are made through an organized process, and a strict command and control structure is present at all times.In bureaucratic structures, the authority is at the top and information is then flowed from top to bottom. This causes for more rules and standards for the company which operational process is watched with close supervision. Some advantages for bureaucratic structures for top-level managers are they have a tremendous control over organizational structure decisions. This works best for managers who have a command and control style of managing. Strategic decision-making is also faster because there are fewer people it has to go through to approve. Some disadvantages in bureaucratic structures are it can discourage creativity and innovation in the organization. This can <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>hard</b> for a company to adapt to changing conditions in the marketplace.|$|E

500|$|Several {{lines in}} the episode were re-recorded. During post-production, editors feared that Rich's mumbly voice would <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>hard</b> for viewers to {{understand}} what he was saying, so he was brought back in to re-record his dialogue, which was then dubbed over the footage. In addition, during the scene wherein Mulder tells Scully Bobby's nickname at school, the original version featured Mulder saying [...] "Dickweed". Fox's standards and practices department made the show change the name to [...] "Dorkweed", which required David Duchovny to re-dub his line.|$|E

On the review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes, the first season garnered a rating of 87%, based on 65 reviews, with an average rating of 8.8/10. The site's critical consensus reads, [...] "In True Detective, performances by Woody Harrelson and Matthew McConaughey reel the viewer in, while the style, vision and direction <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>hard</b> to turn away."

500|$|The {{constitution}} {{was to be}} ratified by state conventions, with nine approvals necessary for it to come into force.

500|$|On {{his first}} day for filming series three, Penry-Jones participated in a fight scene {{in the middle of}} the first episode. He felt a little wary {{replacing}} Matthew Macfadyen. After two months of filming, Penry-Jones began to feel more at ease with the role. He felt especially so after he started working for the fourth series. He returned to the fourth series because he thought his character took off by the end of the last series, and wanted to see which direction he would go to next.
