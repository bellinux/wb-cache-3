5|$|In 1964 Driberg {{published}} a critical study of <b>Moral</b> <b>Re-armament,</b> which brought him attacks from the {{movement on the}} basis of his homosexuality and communist past. Although he made money from this book, throughout the 1960s he was beset by financial problems. When Reynolds News, which had evolved into the Sunday Citizen, finally folded in 1967, he became fully dependent on his parliamentary salary and casual journalism. He had long considered selling Bradwell Lodge, preferably to the National Trust on a basis that would allow him to continue living there. However, the Trust required the property to be mortgage-free and endowed with a substantial fund to cover future repairs, neither of which terms could be arranged. In the event the house remained unsold until 1971. As the 1970 election approached, Driberg wished to retire from parliament, and asked Wilson to appoint him as ambassador to the Vatican. Wilson refused, citing Driberg's age—at 65 he was beyond the retirement age for senior diplomats. Against his will, but with few other sources of income available to him, Driberg fought the June 1970 General Election. He was returned for Barking with a comfortable though reduced majority; nationally, Wilson's government was defeated by Edward Heath's Conservatives.|$|E

25|$|When {{not playing}} cricket, Dodds worked for <b>Moral</b> <b>Re-Armament</b> in the East End of London, and then further afield. Playing cricket {{as an amateur}} in 1946, he turned {{professional}} – unusual for a former public schoolboy – from 1947 and he gave the money from his benefit match to <b>Moral</b> <b>Re-Armament</b> projects in India. He worked on projects worldwide for the group after he retired from cricket.|$|E
25|$|Around 1946 he disassociated {{himself from}} the Oxford Group (now called <b>Moral</b> <b>Re-Armament).</b> He would {{eventually}} (in 1982) reconcile with the group (renamed again as Initiatives of Change).|$|E
25|$|Around 1938, Faith at Work {{transformed}} into <b>Moral</b> <b>Re-Armament.</b> However, controversy grew because the latter dissociated from Christian churches and New Testament orientation. <b>Moral</b> <b>Re-Armament</b> also took an increasing share of Shoemaker's {{time and the}} facilities of Calvary House in New York. Shoemaker re-evaluated his priorities, including with Frank Buchman and the Oxford Group, {{as well as his}} commitment to evangelism, devotion to the Church of Christ in general and to the Episcopal Church. Efforts to work through these concerns in 1940 and 1941 proved fruitless. In the closing months of 1941, Calvary Church's vestry formally asked Moral Re Armament to stop using Calvary House.|$|E
25|$|Menzies {{married a}} D'Oyly Carte {{principal}} soprano, Elsie Griffin, {{but he left}} her repeatedly to go on extensive tours in Australia and New Zealand. Later, Menzies became {{a leader of the}} <b>Moral</b> <b>Re-Armament</b> movement in Australia and Britain, and he continued to perform on stage until 1962.|$|E
25|$|Dodds {{worked on}} <b>Moral</b> <b>Re-Armament</b> {{projects}} in the UK and overseas, and was also involved with West Indian cricketer Conrad Hunte in race relations work. The cricket writer Neville Cardus suggested that he write his autobiography, and Cardus contributed the foreword to the resulting book, which was entitled Hit Hard and Enjoy It; the foreword {{is thought to be}} the last work that Cardus did before his death.|$|E
25|$|Hunte was a {{committed}} Christian. The defining experience {{of his life}} was when in 1961, on the West Indies' tour of Australia, he saw the film The Crowning Experience, {{about the life of}} the black American educator Mary McLeod Bethune. This film was promoted by <b>Moral</b> <b>Re-Armament</b> (MRA), a multi-faith organisation promoting absolute moral and ethical standards of behaviour, to which Hunte committed the remainder of his life.|$|E
25|$|George Algernon West, MM (17 December 1893 – 25 May 1980) was a British Anglican missionary {{who spent}} many years in Burma, first as a missionary for the Society for Propagation of the Gospel and then as the Lord Bishop of Rangoon. In the latter {{position}} he served for nineteen years, and gradually became active involved with the <b>Moral</b> <b>Re-Armament</b> movement. After retiring from Burma in 1954 he became Assistant Bishop of Durham.|$|E
25|$|In 1926, Shoemaker {{founded the}} 'Faith at Work' {{movement}} (later called LUMUNOS and <b>Moral</b> <b>Re-Armament</b> {{in the years}} immediately preceding World War II) out of his passion for personal witness in the workplace. Faith at Work begun circa 1926 in a mission at Calvary. On Thursday evenings through approximately 1936, lay persons both presented their witness of their life as Christians in the workaday world and were trained to witness to that world.|$|E
25|$|Brian Boobbyer (25 February 1928 at Ealing, Middlesex – 17 January 2011 at Hereford) {{played in}} nine Test matches for England at rugby union between 1950 and 1952. He also played cricket at {{first-class}} level, and was awarded Blues for both sports by Oxford University for appearing against Cambridge. But in 1952, {{at the age}} of twenty-four, he gave up playing both games, in order to devote his life to working for the <b>Moral</b> <b>Re-Armament</b> (MRA) movement.|$|E
25|$|Hazard took Jung's advice {{seriously and}} set about seeking a {{personal}} spiritual experience. He returned home to the United States and joined a First-Century Christian evangelical movement known as the Oxford Group (later known as <b>Moral</b> <b>Re-Armament).</b> He also told other alcoholics what Jung {{had told him about}} the importance of a spiritual experience. One of the alcoholics he brought into the Oxford Group was Ebby Thacher, a long-time friend and drinking buddy of Bill Wilson, later co-founder of Alcoholics Anonymous (AA). Thacher told Wilson about the Oxford Group, and through them Wilson became aware of Hazard's experience with Jung. The influence of Jung thus indirectly found its way into the formation of Alcoholics Anonymous, the original twelve-step program.|$|E
500|$|Within a {{month of}} {{beginning}} his duties, Driberg achieved a scoop with the first national newspaper reports of the activities in Oxford of the American evangelist Frank Buchman, whose movement would in time be known as <b>Moral</b> <b>Re-Armament.</b> Driberg's reports were generally abrasive, even mocking in tone, and drew complaints from Buchman's organisation about news bias. The trial period at the Express was extended, and in July 1928 Driberg filed an exclusive report on a society party at the swimming baths in Buckingham Palace Road, where the guests included Lytton Strachey and Tallulah Bankhead. This evidence of Driberg's social contacts led to a permanent contract with the Express, as assistant to Percy Sewell who, under the name [...] "The Dragoman", wrote a daily feature called [...] "The Talk of London". Driberg later defended his association with an inconsequential society column by arguing that his approach was satirical, and that he deliberately exaggerated the doings of the idle rich {{as a way of}} enraging working-class opinion and helping the Communist Party.|$|E

2500|$|Later, Menzies and Griffin (who never divorced) {{appeared}} in the <b>Moral</b> <b>Re-Armament</b> musical, The Vanishing Island, in which they toured around the world from 1955 until 1957. [...] In 1962, Griffin's singing career was ended by a throat operation; Menzies {{had a heart attack}} the same year. They spent most of their remaining years living quietly in the London suburb of Barnes, although they continued to participate in <b>Moral</b> <b>Re-Armament</b> activities. In 1975, during the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company's centennial season, Menzies was {{invited to participate in the}} final performance of Trial by Jury, in which the company's regular chorus was augmented by fourteen former stars of the company.|$|E
2500|$|The {{son of a}} clergyman, Dodds was {{a strong}} {{supporter}} of the <b>Moral</b> <b>Re-Armament</b> movement and cricket was, in his view, [...] "a reflection of the Great Creator" [...] and should therefore be played in a suitably dashing and creative style.|$|E
2500|$|Back in Britain in 1934, he met Peggy Williams {{from the}} Oxford Group, later {{known as the}} <b>Moral</b> <b>Re-Armament,</b> a Christian {{movement}} founded at Oxford in the 1920s. [...] Williams persuaded Menzies to join the movement, and he resolved to change his life, adopting the group’s so-called four absolutes: honesty, purity, unselfishness and love. [...] He aggressively proselytized for the movement by giving lectures, when not performing onstage. When he returned for another Australian tour, he insultingly said that God had called him [...] "to pioneer {{in a country that}} had never known a major spiritual awakening".|$|E
2500|$|Having been {{introduced}} earlier to the Essex county cricket captain Tom Pearce, Dodds was de-mobbed {{from the army}} in 1946 and joined Essex. At about this time, according to his later account in his autobiography, he joined <b>Moral</b> <b>Re-Armament</b> and embraced a form of active Christianity in which he lived his life according to [...] "advice" [...] which he received in conversations with God: [...] "You have a quiet time, in which you put the problem to him, and you note what thoughts he puts into your mind in reply. You are not asking for anything, except advice." ...|$|E
2500|$|Nurse {{was part}} of the West Indies cricket team in India in 1966-67 but had limited opportunities, scoring 82 runs in the two Tests he played. [...] When Conrad Hunte retired from cricket to pursue his {{interest}} in <b>Moral</b> <b>Re-Armament,</b> Nurse was asked to replace him opening the batting for the West Indiesa position for which he was not suited. After making 41 and 42 in the first Test at Port of Spain, Nurse was pushed down the batting order for the second Test. In the fourth Test at Queen's Park Oval Nursebatting first wicket downshared a partnership of 273 with Kanhai that put the West Indies in a winning position but a controversial declaration by West Indian captain Sobers helped England to a win by seven wickets. England won the series by one Test to nil. [...] Wisden said of Nurse's efforts [...] "Nurse had a good series, though he was not entirely happy as an opener." ...|$|E
2500|$|With his Diocese {{overrun by}} the Imperial Japanese Army, West {{went to the}} United States. There, he became a leading member of the Oxford Group, a {{movement}} devoted to an [...] "ideology of democracy", which later became the <b>Moral</b> <b>Re-Armament</b> (MRA) movement. For a two-month period in 1942 West became the Bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of Atlanta. While in America {{he wrote a book}} called The World that Works (1944) devoted to the MRA ideals. While in the United States, he married Grace Hay in Tryon, North Carolina in April 1943. Soon after, fully recovered from his injuries, he returned to India to do what he could. With the eventual defeat of the Japanese in Burma, West {{was one of the first}} British civilian allowed back into the country, flying into Rangoon on 9 July 1945 to find the city in a parlous state and discovered that his Cathedral, St. Paul's, had been fitted out as a distillery by the Japanese occupiers.|$|E
2500|$|The {{building}} of the house began in 1907 for Bryan Leesmith, {{a director of the}} chemical firm of Brunner Mond, the architect being C. E. Mallows. [...] Before it was completed, Leesmith had to sell the house and its ownership passed to Brunner Mond. [...] It was then leased to Richard Henry Prestwich, who was a director of Burberry’s. [...] Prestwich’s daughter, Irene, continued to rent the property after her father’s death in 1940. [...] Irene {{was a member of the}} campaign for <b>Moral</b> <b>Re-Armament</b> (MRA) and in 1940 she invited the organisation to move here to shelter from the war. [...] In November 1940 36incendiary bombs fell in the garden and one on the house. [...] During the war the gardens were used for growing produce which was taken to the local markets. [...] After the war Irene bought the house and grounds from Imperial Chemical Industries, the successors of Brunner Mond, and presented it to MRA, establishing the Tirley Garth Trust in order to preserve it. [...] Irene Prestwich died in 1974. [...] In 2002, as the house and grounds were surplus to the requirements of MRA, they were sold to Mersey Television.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Moral</b> <b>Re-Armament</b> {{also became}} {{established}} {{in many countries}} of continental Europe, but it was suppressed in all the countries occupied by Nazi Germany. In Norway and elsewhere MRA leaders were imprisoned. In 1945, during the Allied invasion of Europe a 126-page Gestapo report on Buchman, the Oxford Group and <b>Moral</b> <b>Re-Armament</b> was discovered. Die Oxfordgruppenbewegung denounces Dr Buchman and <b>Moral</b> <b>Re-Armament</b> for [...] "uncompromisingly taking up a frontal position against National Socialism… It preaches revolution against the National State, and has quite evidently become its Christian opponent." ...|$|E
