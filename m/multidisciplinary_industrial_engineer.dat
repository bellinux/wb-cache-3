50|$|Modern <b>industrial</b> <b>engineers</b> {{typically}} use predetermined motion time system, {{computer simulation}} (especially discrete event simulation), along with extensive mathematical tools for modeling, such as mathematical optimization and queueing theory, and computational methods for system analysis, evaluation, and optimization. <b>Industrial</b> <b>engineers</b> {{also use the}} tools of data science and machine learning in their work owing to the strong relatedness of these disciplines with {{the field and the}} similar technical background required of <b>industrial</b> <b>engineers</b> (including a strong foundation in probability theory, linear algebra, and statistics, as well as having coding skills).|$|R

30|$|Using the KSAs {{for each}} occupation, we {{estimated}} the skills transferability by calculating {{the proportion of}} KSAs that would be transferred from one’s origin occupation to one’s destination occupation. We did so by computing the ratio of shared KSAs to total KSAs required within the origin occupation. Table  1 provides the knowledge score of an <b>industrial</b> <b>engineer</b> and human resource manager in “Administration and Management,” “Engineering and Technology,” and “Sales and Marketing” categories. For example, an <b>industrial</b> <b>engineer</b> uses 16.01 points of the administration and management knowledge area, while the human resource manager uses 19.68 points. Within this knowledge category, the two occupations share 16.01 points. While the <b>industrial</b> <b>engineer</b> can apply all 16.01 points of their “Administration and Management” knowledge in his/her role as an HR manager, the HR manager, on the other hand, can apply {{only a portion of}} his/her 19.68 points in a role as an <b>industrial</b> <b>engineer,</b> given the smaller requirement of “Administration and Management” knowledge in the engineering occupation. Using the transferability estimate outlined above, in this example, the transferability of the “Administration and Management” knowledge category from the <b>industrial</b> <b>engineer</b> position to the HR manager position is equal to 1 (16.01 / 16.01), while the transferability of the “Administration and Management” knowledge category from the HR manager position to the <b>industrial</b> <b>engineer</b> position is equal to 0.814 (16.01 / 19.68).|$|R

40|$|The {{industrial}} engineering discipline in South Africa is examined by introducing {{the context of}} the discipline and by revisiting its history. The drivers influencing the context and future of {{industrial engineering}} in South Africa are also considered, and the discipline is analysed in terms of the following aspects: university qualifications, employment in industry sectors, race and gender profiles, use and competence in industry, and income profiles. The analysis is based on a recent survey sent to practising <b>industrial</b> <b>engineers,</b> on membership data from the Southern African Institute for Industrial Engineering (SAIIE), and on two internal SAIIE investigations. The study concludes that the success of transformation, particularly in terms of race, has been limited. The results also indicate that there are an almost equal number of black and white <b>industrial</b> <b>engineers,</b> yet the majority of black <b>industrial</b> <b>engineers</b> have technical qualifications, while the majority of white <b>industrial</b> <b>engineers</b> have academic qualifications. The results indicate that this limits the use of black <b>industrial</b> <b>engineers</b> in industry and, consequently, the success of their careers. This in turn means that there are fewer black role models to attract young black students to the discipline. Some preliminary opportunities to unlock the increased transformation of the profession are identified...|$|R
