5|$|<b>Marble</b> is {{the most}} {{significant}} mineral deposit of Romblon and {{is the most}} renowned product of the province. Based on statistics, Romblon is the second biggest provincial <b>marble</b> producer of the country next to Bulacan. Romblon <b>marble</b> is of very high quality and comes in shades of white, green, pink, red and black. The Mines and Geosciences Bureau has estimated that Romblon is endowed with about 150 million metric tons of <b>marble.</b> At current rates of extraction, the supply may last for three more centuries. Tablas Island is also believed to have vast reserves of <b>marble.</b>|$|E
5|$|<b>Marble</b> {{quarrying}} {{and processing}} are major activities in Romblon. Among {{the most common}} <b>marble</b> products are categorized into the following: novelty items (gifts, ashtray, table bars), furniture (dining tables, baptismal fonts) and construction materials (tiles, balusters, <b>marble</b> chips). Other mineral resources with considerable quantity include nickel ore and gold mostly {{to be found in}} Sibuyan Island. Gold panning and small-scale mining is a lucrative undertaking in Magdiwang.|$|E

50|$|In the game, <b>marbles</b> of {{different}} colors roll down a spiral path towards a central goal, which the player must stop by shooting new <b>marbles</b> using a cannon into the oncoming ones. The <b>marbles</b> disappear if player matches three or more <b>marbles</b> of the same color. In addition, collecting bonus items attached to <b>marbles</b> can, for example, temporarily slow down the rate the <b>marbles</b> advance or cause all <b>marbles</b> of the same color to disappear.|$|R
50|$|In Lose Your <b>Marbles</b> {{the player}} moves each color of <b>marbles</b> to create matches {{on the playing}} field while the game drops new ones every few seconds.

5|$|A stuccoed brick {{fence with}} cast iron gates and an iron Star of David enclose the cemetery. Within the walls, {{there are two}} main {{pathways}} which meet {{in the center of the}} cemetery at a circular decorative piece including a fountain. The oldest graves are in the northern half of the cemetery while newer graves were added progressively south. Many grave sites are adorned with well-maintained Victorian era funerary art, which gives the cemetery its historic significance. Among the monuments include the grave enclosure of the Winner family, which includes a bronze bust of Mark Winner, and two <b>marble</b> angels at the entrance of the plot. Other examples include the grave of David L. Rosenbaum, topped with <b>marble</b> shoes and stockings, the grave of Julius Elson, marked by a carved <b>marble</b> fainting couch, and a memorial to Mattimore Meyer, featuring a <b>marble</b> angel.|$|E

50|$|By the 1960s, larger {{versions}} of the small glass <b>marbles</b> were being produced - about {{half the size of}} a golf ball - and these were called dobberts (sometimes abbreviated to a 'dob').

Both <b>marbles</b> and dobberts came with various swirling coloured patterns inside the hard glass sphere.|$|R

40|$|A 2 -yr {{study was}} {{conducted}} to determine the effect of EPD for <b>marbling</b> on <b>marbling</b> score, palatability traits, and carcass fatness in beef. Steer (n = 122) and heifer (n = 123) carcasses were obtained by mating Angus bulls having a high (3 ̆e. 4) or low (3 ̆c-. 16) EPD for <b>marbling</b> to MARC II cows (¼ Angus, ¼ Hereford, ¼ Simmental, and ¼ Gelbvieh). Carcass traits, composition of primals, quarters, and sides, palatability, and shear force data were obtained and adjusted to the mean number of days on feed, equal <b>marbling</b> score (Small 50), fat thickness (1. 0 cm), and carcass weight (318 kg) end points. Steer carcasses from the high <b>marbling</b> EPD group, adjusted to the mean number of days on feed, had significantly more <b>marbling</b> (P 3 ̆c. 01) and less subcutaneous fat in the side and the hindquarter (P 3 ̆c. 10) than their low <b>marbling</b> EPD counterparts. Adjusting steers to Small 50 <b>marbling</b> produced smaller longissimus muscle area (by 5 cm 2), less fat thickness (1. 15 vs 1. 28 cm), and lighter side weights (306 vs 333 kg) for high <b>marbling</b> vs low <b>marbling</b> EPD groups, indicating a faster rate of <b>marbling</b> deposition. Similar relationships of a greater magnitude were found for heifers, perhaps because the heifers were older than the steers at slaughter. No differences in taste panel ratings or shear force values were noted among steer carcasses. Heifer carcasses from the high <b>marbling</b> EPD group had better (P 3 ̆c. 05) ratings for juiciness, muscle fiber tenderness, and overall tenderness than the low <b>marbling</b> EPD group heifers. These results indicate that it is possible, using existing genetic resources, to maintain <b>marbling</b> score and decrease fat in other depots of the carcass without compromising palatability...|$|R
40|$|Today 2 ̆ 7 s diet {{conscious}} consumers {{continue to}} desire flavorful, tender meat, but increasingly avoid excess fat. Differences in USDA quality grades within similar aged cattle are determined primarily by differences in <b>marbling</b> scores {{which tend to}} be associated with overall fatness in beef carcasses. Previous studies (Cundiff et al., 1988) demonstrated an antagonism between lean yield in carcasses and degree of <b>marbling</b> associated with higher quality grades. Breeds that rank highest for retail product percentage rank lowest for <b>marbling.</b> High negative genetic correlations have been found within breeds between <b>marbling</b> and retail product percentage. Thus, only limited opportunity exists for genetically increasing <b>marbling</b> without increasing fat trim and reducing retail product percentage. Nevertheless, there is a large amount of variation in palatability characteristics among animals with the same degree of <b>marbling,</b> suggesting the importance of factors other than <b>marbling</b> have a large impact on eating qualities. Concern with the antagonism between <b>marbling</b> and retail product percentage is justified to the extent that a certain amount of <b>marbling</b> is required to ensure papatability of the retail product.
