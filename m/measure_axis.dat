40|$|Stigmatization {{is a major}} {{hindrance}} {{in adult}} psychiatric patients with Axis-I diagnoses, as shown consistently in most studies. Significantly fewer studies on the emergence of psychiatric stigma in adult patients with personality disorders exist, although the resulting evidence is conclusive. Some authors consider patients with personality disorders at risk for severe stigmatization because of intense difficulties during interpersonal contact, even in a psychotherapeutic relationship. The {{aim of this study}} was primarily the assessment of pre-existing stigma in patients referred for intensive treatment for personality disorders. The study enrolled 214 patients admitted to the adult department of a highly specialized mental health care institute offering psychotherapy for patients with severe and complex personality pathology. All patients underwent a standard assessment with self-report questionnaires and a semi-structured interview to <b>measure</b> <b>Axis</b> II personality disorders. The Stigma Consciousness Questionnaire (SCQ) and the Perceived Devaluation-Discrimination Questionnaire (DDQ), both validated instruments, were used to measure perceived and actual experiences of stigma. Independent sample t-tests were used to investigate differences in the mean total stigma scores for patients both with and without a personality disorder. One-way ANOVA’s were performed to assess the differences between having a borderline personality disorder, another personality disorder, or no personality disorder diagnosis. Multiple regression main effect analyses were conducted in order to explore the impact of the different personality disorder diagnosis on the level of stigma. The mean scores across all patient groups were consistent with rather low stigma. No differences were found for patients with or without a personality disorder diagnosis. Level of stigma in general was not associated with an accumulating number of personality disorders...|$|E
40|$|After {{having spent}} many years in researching about the {{topographical}} connections {{in the city and}} over the monumental sites and the main architectures of Rome (Palatino, Coliseum, Appia Antica are the areas where heis working as director of restoring for the Rome Soprintendenza Archeologica) the architect Piero Meogrossi confirms his personal thesis dealing with a strategic oriented direction showing a geomanthic dynamism able to drive the urban growth. A key <b>measure</b> <b>axis</b> used to plan the topography submits the urban shape and the design itself at different ages revealing a virtual matrix whose hidden identity remains astronomically and simbolically characterized by the specific season position of the sun accorded to the dies natalis of Rome, the famous april XXIth connected with the romulean age and the tradictional Squared Rome. Such recognition over the archeological city connects the legendary and historical tales to the main monuments of Rome whose architectonical centers become instrumental knots to control, to accord and to submit to a DNA topographical codex, a symbolical axis-decuimanus by which the romans drive rules of the earth and of the sky (natural perspectives and sundial measures). The utopian reconstruction of the “sun-city plan” has confirmed the quality of the project by Sixtus Vth, the XVIIth century pope who wanted to create, as a new Romulus, a town design able to make comparison with the dynamic shape of the roman antiquities, a “net-city” whose infrastructures (obelisques and streets, etc.) let understood the value of that ancient topographical axis linking each others the center of the optagonal labyrinth to the center of Palatino,to the center of arch of Costantine to the center of Coliseum, to the center of optagonal hall in the golden kingdome by Nero [...] and further on. Rome, as example of historical town due to the western culture globality, needs to discover and organise those phisical memories, hidden identies whose ancient shape which can yet offer opportunies for the future plans and projects but only if the reality will be pushed by an Utopian vision as the Roman Column 200 mt. high, accorded to the shapes upwritten, a Meogrossiis project winner of the Utopia award in a national competition for the Rome of third millennium...|$|E

40|$|To {{reduce the}} {{influence}} of the static unbalance on an infrared missile guidance system, a new static unbalance measure system for the gimbals axes has been developed. Considering the coupling effects caused by a mass eccentricity, the static balance condition and measure sequence for each gimbal axis are obtained. A novel static unbalance test approach is proposed after analyzing the dynamic model of the <b>measured</b> gimbal <b>axis.</b> This approach is to drive the <b>measured</b> gimbal <b>axis</b> to do sinusoidal reciprocating motion in a small angle and collect its drive currents in real time. Then the static unbalance of the <b>measured</b> gimbal <b>axis</b> can be obtained by the current multi-cycle integration. Also a measuring system using the proposed approach has been developed. A balanced simulator is used to verify the proposed approach by the load and repeatability tests. The results show the proposed approach enhances the efficiency of the static unbalance measurement, and the developed measuring system is able to achieve a high precision with a greater stability...|$|R

In the second step, a non asymptotically algebraic fast identification of the oscillatory behavior of the robot axis is introduced. Finally, the performances of the identification approach are exploited in order to improve the dynamic accuracy of a flexible robot axis. This is done experimentally by the combination of the adaptation of the jerk time profile to reduce the end-point vibration and the model-based precompensation of the end-point tracking error...|$|R

40|$|The pulsed {{discharge}} in xenon at pressures between 10 and 50 Torr and a {{peak current}} of 130 mA has been analysed {{by means of}} a time-dependent, spatially one-dimensional fluid model.

The analysis of the spatiotemporal variation of the pulsed discharge shows the formation of a constricted column plasma at increasing pressure.
