5|$|An even {{checkerboard}} plot model {{dominates the}} green landscape {{during the rainy}} season, which becomes more austere after harvest. The rice fields differ {{only in terms of}} soil type and location. Where mangroves are populous, such as in Carabane, the rice paddy fields between them <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>protected</b> from the channels of saltwater which overflow during high tide. Rice farmers must therefore build levees, dig ditches, and create ponds. The fish and shrimp which subsequently become trapped are harvested {{at the end of the}} rainy season, when the basins are emptied. The plots of land which were safeguarded from flooding are then cleared and ploughed. Several years of drainage are required to desalinate the soil.|$|E
5|$|In 1946, Magnusson {{established}} {{the use of}} stem cells from bone marrow with the first surgical debridement of an OCD lesion. These cells typically differentiate into fibrocartilage and rarely form hyaline cartilage. While small lesions can be resurfaced using this form of surgery, the repair tissue tends to have less strength than normal hyaline cartilage and <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>protected</b> for 6 to 12 months. Results for large lesions tend to diminish over time; this {{can be attributed to}} the decreased resilience and poor wear characteristics of the fibrocartilage.|$|E

5|$|RNAi in vivo {{delivery}} to tissues still eludes science—especially to tissues {{deep within the}} body. RNAi delivery is only easily accessible to surface tissues such as the eye and respiratory tract. In these instances, siRNA {{has been used in}} direct contact with the tissue for transport. The resulting RNAi successfully focused on target genes. When delivering siRNA to deep tissues, the siRNA <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>protected</b> from nucleases, but targeting specific areas becomes the main difficulty. This difficulty has been combatted with high dosage levels of siRNA to ensure the tissues have been reached, however in these cases hepatotoxicity was reported.|$|E
5|$|Based on the {{assumption}} that man is a social animal, Saint-Just argues that in nature {{there is no need for}} contracts, legislation, or acts of force. These constructs only become necessary when a society is in need of moral regeneration and serve merely as unsatisfactory substitutes for the natural bonds of free people. Such constructs permit small groups to assume unwarranted powers which, according to Saint-Just, leads to corruption within society. Because a return to the natural state is impossible, Saint-Just argues for a government composed of the most educated members of society, who could be expected to share an understanding of the larger social good. Outside the government itself, Saint-Just asserts there must be full equality between all men, including equal security in material possessions and personal independence. Property <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>protected</b> by the state but, in order to secure universal independence, all citizens (including women) must own property.|$|E
5|$|The Nueces estuary {{provides}} an ecosystem {{for a wide}} variety of wildlife. However, since the construction of Choke Canyon Reservoir in 1985, freshwater inflows have decreased from the Nueces River, increasing the bay's salinity, and hurting the natural oyster and shrimp habitat. In response, the City of Corpus Christi, Texas Parks and Wildlife Department and two additional state agencies have worked to restore the natural freshwater inflows into the bay. The Odem Bay extension is low in salinity and serves as a nursery for shrimp, which migrate to Nueces Bay in spring. Oyster beds are common throughout the bay and are known to be hiding spots for such fish as trout, black drum, flounder and redfish. Such finfish <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>protected</b> from excessive freshwater introduction for survival.|$|E

Ammunition {{is limited in}} the game and weapons must be reloaded, although additional ammunition can be collected. Players can also call out to enemies who will sometimes surrender and can then be captured (put in handcuffs) with their ammunition also collected. There are also civilians in the game who can also be called out to and then rescued by the player. Health bars for enemies, vehicles or friendly subjects that <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>protected</b> are also sometimes shown. There are health packs which can be picked up, as well as health stations mounted on walls which can be used. Body armor is also sometimes provided or found in levels. A small heads-up-display features a radar/map with an arrow showing the character's direction, red dots for enemies, green dots for civilians, and yellow stars for objectives. The direction and field of vision of enemies is shown on the radar.|$|E

25|$|Cryptography can {{introduce}} security problems {{when it is}} not implemented correctly. Cryptographic solutions need to be implemented using industry accepted solutions that have undergone rigorous peer review by independent experts in cryptography. The length and strength of the encryption key is also an important consideration. A key that is weak or too short will produce weak encryption. The keys used for encryption and decryption <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>protected</b> with the same degree of rigor as any other confidential information. They <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>protected</b> from unauthorized disclosure and destruction and they must be available when needed. Public key infrastructure (PKI) solutions address many of the problems that surround key management.|$|E
