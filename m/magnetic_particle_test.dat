40|$|This {{study was}} {{directed}} toward {{the question of whether}} recent advancements in radiation sources and test media offered significant improvements over {{the current state of the}} art. Included were experiments characterizing common penetrant and magnetic particle materials to determine their fluorescent excitation spectra, and a comparison between the fluorescent excitation spectra and the emission spectra of common excitation sources. The relationship between exciter and test medium directly controls the luminance of a defect indication. As indication luminance increases, the probability of it being detected by the inspector increases. Fluorescent penetrant and <b>magnetic</b> <b>particle</b> <b>test</b> media were originally designed around the widely available filtered medium pressure mercury vapor lamp, which remains the standard excitation radiation source. Test media properties, and the types of available excitation sources have changed with time, and it was unclear whether present-day media was still best excited by the historical standard ultraviolet radiation source. Predictions and experimental work was performed to determine the optimal excitation source for fluorescent nondestructive testing, and to determine which safety lens option would offer the highest probability of detection. Improvement in radiation sources was primarily judged by an increase in fluorophore luminance versus background, which led to an increase in signal-to-noise ratio facilitating better indication detectability. Other factors considered were improved health and safety, and ease of use...|$|E

Bridge element {{inspection}} is {{the first}} step to reach the general proper assessment about the condition of materials and deterioration grade. Visual and physical inspection duties arerequired to characterize both aspects, this is the reason why this project aims to give technical information about physical and functional real state of concrete decks and steel beams for five important bridges over the national highway called Ruta 27 from San José to Caldera that is managed by Autopistas del Sol S. A. In order to accomplish this purpose is important to determinate the appropriate test for concrete and steel members evaluation, based on results obtained, to distinguish materials and defects and finally give a diagnosis about the elements in study. The visual inspection work was possible through visits to the bridges to collect information about common concrete and steel defects while the physical one was the result of destructive and nondestructive test as core sampling, ultrasonic testing to verify the extent of defects on decks and <b>magnetic</b> <b>particle</b> <b>test</b> for weld analysis and thickness ultrasonic measurement for steel web beams. The general cracking orientation is longitudinal for concrete bridges and cross for steel bridges due to the unbraced length in each case because of flexion stress, the concrete strength got from cores was upper to the design strength and it was possible to measure some crack deeps in one of the decks. There is a partial loss of cross section due to corrosion that means [1 %- 9 %] of reduction in moment capacity for main beams while welds in connections are without cracks and do not have fatigue signs.

In order to detect cracks at carriage axles and to evaluate the quality of axles surfaced, ultrasonic and <b>magnetic</b> <b>particle</b> <b>testing</b> methods were used. Ultrasonic testing with normal and angle probes was used to detect internal cracks in the carriage axles using the distance gain size (DGS) diagram and the distance amplitude correction (DAC) method for reference specimens.

The tests performed at numerous railway carriages provided results, which make it possible to predict a premature axle fracture in further service. The non-destructive testing methods used permitted the detection of the cracks present, causes for the crack initiation were established, and the risks of crack propagation were evaluated. A critical evaluation of the carriage axles in terms of crack initiation and size is given.

An item analysis was conducted on the distribution of magnetic charges along the convex edges of a discontinuity on the ferromagnetic workpiece surface at magnetization and the magnetic force acting upon a <b>magnetic</b> <b>particle</b> near the corners. The principle finding of the item analysis was that around a large square hole, a parallelogram slot and near corners of a keyslot on the workpiece surface there sometimes will appear <b>magnetic</b> <b>particle</b> pattern in radiating long straight lines starting from the corners of them and spreading out along the 45 °lines.

Given by the relation of the electromagnetic skin depth, the thermal penetration depth and the crack dimensions to be detected, different regimes for defect detection are identified.

In ferritic steel, at induction frequencies of 100 - 200 kHz, perpendicular open cracks with a length of 7. 5 mm were detectable when their depth was minimum 0. 15 mm. For inclined cracks, the sensitivity is even higher. Experiments were performed on cold and warm forged steel components. The signal-to noise ratio obtained from defects was usually high, the critical limitation on technical surfaces is the background due to surface roughness and due to surface contamination.

On the basis of this finding, a drill stem for oil and gas field after its operation for a long time must be magnetized intensely and spontaneously.
