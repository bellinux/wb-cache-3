40|$|We have {{developed}} the multiband color imaging systems in the frame work of the IPA project as New Color Management System Based on Human Perception. This system consisted of multiband CCD camera, computer, CRT and projection type monitor. Five band images were taken by CCD camera with 2048 x 2048 pixels. Reflectance spectra of the object were esti-mated by the principal component analysis and Wiener estimation method. Spectral transmittance of separation filter was optimized by simulated annealing method based on Wiener estimation.

40|$|QC 351 A 7 no. 44 The primary {{intent of}} this {{monograph}} is to furnish the multiband experimentalist with a convenient source of current information on aerial photo- graphic films, spectral filters, and optical -mechanical tolerances for <b>multiband</b> <b>cameras.</b> An account is given {{of the various}} types of aerial cameras emphasizing their advantages and disadvantages in <b>multiband</b> use. Some <b>cameras</b> specially assembled as multiband systems are described fully. Electro-optical and optical multiplexing techniques for multiband photography are discussed. Finally, some predictions are made concerning <b>multiband</b> <b>cameras</b> of the future. The text of this monograph was initially written for inclusion as three chapters in a "Manual of Multiband Photography" coauthored by Dr. R. N. Colwell (editor) and Dr. E. F. Yost. Because of the high cost of reproduction of the many color photographs in the other chapters, the number of copies of the first edition of the manual will be limited. This is the reason for the separate publication of this monograph.

30|$|The {{advantage}} over the previous missions is the near-equatorial orbit of the spacecraft and a suite of <b>multiband</b> <b>cameras</b> dedicated to meteorological study (Nakamura et al., 2007, 2011). The planned orbit around Venus is a 30 hour-period elliptical orbit near the ecliptic plane with the periapsis latitude of ∼ 10.5 °S and the apoapsis latitude of ∼ 10.5 °N. The direction of orbital motion is westward, which coincides with {{the direction of the}} atmospheric super-rotation. The apoapsis altitude is chosen to be 78500 km, or 13 Venus radii (RV), so that the angular velocity of the spacecraft is roughly synchronized with the 60 -m s− 1 super-rotational flow near the cloud base (50 km) for ∼ 20 hours centered at the apoapsis. The periapsis altitude is ∼ 600 km.|$|R

In this paper, we primarily treat the thermal-optical analysis aspect of the design phase. The window is a pane of BK 7 glass 59. 18 cm by 44. 91 cm by 4. 06 cm. Though it must meet many mechanical specifications, the optical requirements, dictated by the high acuity, distortion-free S- 190 <b>multiband</b> <b>camera</b> system, are the most severe.

40|$|International audienceApplicability of an IR imaging/spectroscopy {{diagnostic}} {{was tested}} on a laboratory- scale flame. For this purpose, measurements {{were carried out}} on a V-shape flame developed along a wall, {{with the aim of}} evaluating the wall temperature and of identifying the flame properties (temperature and species concentrations). Infrared measurements with a <b>multiband</b> <b>camera</b> and a spectrometer were post-processed and compared, in particular, with thermocouple measurements carried out for the wall temperature. Simple evaluation involving a correction for the emissivity showed a quite good agreement when assessed against experimental data. An attempt to reconstruct a flame emission spectrum was also carried out, expecting a possible inverse identification of the flame properties. The method showed a promising behaviour on synthetic data built with a radiative transfer model for gas and wall radiation. However, the spectrum reconstruction method is not yet accurate enough to allow an identification of the flame properties in full confidence when applied to actual experimental data. First tests showed a correct qualitative behaviour, but model refinements are required at least for the flame radiation, before getting accurate flame properties...|$|E
30|$|The {{uniqueness}} of Akatsuki RS {{as compared to}} the previous radio occultation experiments at Venus is that low latitudes can be probed many times thanks to the near-equatorial orbit of the spacecraft. Systematic long-term sampling in the equatorial region provides a opportunity to observe the propagation of planetary-scale waves such as Kelvin waves and thermal tides, which might contribute to the maintenance of the super-rotation via eddy momentum transport. Covering the subsolar region is essential {{to the understanding of the}} cloud dynamics. Another advantage of Akatsuki RS is a suite of <b>multiband</b> <b>cameras</b> dedicated to meteorological study; the locations probed by RS will be observed by the cameras a short time before or after the occultations. The vertical profiles by RS and the horizontally-resolved information by the cameras complement each other in developing three-dimensional models of the atmosphere.|$|R

A physics based 3 D simulation of sea surfaces for the calculation of images for <b>multiband</b> <b>cameras</b> is presented here. Dynamic sea surfaces, composed of smooth wind-driven gravity waves, are generated by means of time dependent statistical models. In addition, choppy waves are modeled to improve the realism of the rough sea. The appearance of the sea in the visible and thermal bands is modeled. Sea surface radiance in the IR band is calculated {{with respect to the}} reflected sky radiance and the emitted sea surface radiance. Sun glint simulations in the visible and IR are presented. Polarization effects were incorporated to enhance the physical realism. As an example for an application a real-time animation of a sea surface with floating foreground objects is shown.

40|$|Data was {{collected}} at the Magdalena Ridge Observatory (MRO) with the Multi Lens Array (MLA) camera coupled to the MRO 2. 4 m telescope. MRO is located at 33. 985 o N, 252. 811 o E {{at an altitude of}} 3193 m, approximately 30 miles West of Socorro, NM. The MRO facilities are intended for both astronomical research and Resident Space Object (RSO) characterization. The purpose of the measurement campaign was to collect both resolved images and unresolved signatures of RSOs in 16 spectral bands, ranging from 414 nm to 845 nm. During the campaign, observations were made over five sessions for the period 21 - 27 September 2007. During that time we succeeded in observing and collecting data for 18 different calibration stars and 40 different RSOs, mostly those in Low Earth Orbit (LEO). A major objective of the measurement campaign is to collect RSO data {{that can be used to}} select spectral bands optimized for estimating surface material composition. The analysis results help determine the nominal spectral differences for typical RSO materials. The paper will discuss the potential of using a <b>multiband</b> <b>camera</b> for RSO identification and characterization...|$|E
40|$|We report 13 high-precision light {{curves of}} eight transits of the {{exoplanet}} WASP- 52 b, obtained by using four medium-class telescopes, through different filters, and adopting the defocussing technique. One transit was recorded simultaneously {{from two different}} observatories and another one from the same site but with two different instruments, including a <b>multiband</b> <b>camera.</b> Anomalies were clearly detected in five light curves and modelled as star-spots occulted by the planet during the transit events. We fitted the clean light curves with the jktebop code, and those with the anomalies with the prism+gemc codes in order to simultaneously model the photometric parameters of the transits and the position, size and contrast of each star-spot. We used these new light curves and some from the literature to revise the physical properties of the WASP- 52 system. Star-spots with similar characteristics were detected in four transits {{over a period of}} 43 d. In the hypothesis that we are dealing with the same star-spot, periodically occulted by the transiting planet, we estimated the projected orbital obliquity of WASP- 52 b to be λ = 3 ∘. 8. ∘ ± 8. ∘ 4. We also determined the true orbital obliquity, ψ = 20 ° ± 50 °, which is, although very uncertain, the first measurement of ψ purely from star-spot crossings. We finally assembled an optical transmission spectrum of the planet and searched for variations of its radius as a function of wavelength. Our analysis suggests a flat transmission spectrum within the experimental uncertainties...|$|E

40|$|Space <b>multiband</b> CCD <b>camera</b> {{compression}} encoder requires low-complexity, high-robustness, and high-performance {{because of}} its captured images information being very precious and also because it is usually working on the satellite where the resources, such as power, memory, and processing capacity, are limited.

The Consultative Committee for Space Data Systems-Image Data Compression (CCSDS-IDC) algorithm decreases the average PSNR by 2 [*]dB compared with JPEG 2000. In this paper, we proposed a low-complexity compression algorithm based on deep coupling algorithm among posttransform in wavelet domain, compressive sensing, and distributed source coding. In our algorithm, we integrate three low-complexity and high-performance approaches in a deeply coupled manner to remove the spatial redundant, spectral redundant, and bit information redundancy.

Our goal is to optimise SZ-Cluster extraction from our observed noisy maps. We wish to emphasize {{that none of the}} algorithms used in the detection chain is tuned on prior knowledge on the SZ -Cluster signal, or other astrophysical sources (Optical Spectrum, Noise Covariance Matrix, or covariance of SZ Cluster wavelet coefficients). First, a blind separation of the different astrophysical components which contribute to the observations is conducted using an Independent Component Analysis (ICA) method. Then, a recent non linear filtering technique in the wavelet domain, based on multiscale entropy and the False Discovery Rate (FDR) method, is used to detect and reconstruct the galaxy clusters. Finally, we use the Source Extractor software to identify the detected clusters. The proposed method was applied on realistic simulations of observations. As for global detection efficiency, this new method is impressive as it provides comparable results to Pierpaoli et al. method being however a blind algorithm.

The telescope is a modified two-corrector Ritchey-Chretien design which has a 2. 5 -m, f/ 2. 25 primary, a 1. 08 -m secondary, a Gascoigne astigmatism corrector, and one {{of a pair of}} interchangeable highly aspheric correctors near the focal focal plane, one for imaging and the other for spectroscopy. The final focal ratio is f/ 5. The telescope is instrumented by a wide-area, <b>multiband</b> CCD <b>camera</b> and a pair of fiber-fed double spectrographs. Novel features of the telescope include: (1) A 3 degree diameter (0. 65 m) focal plane that has excellent image quality and small geometrical distortions over a wide wavelength range (3000 to 10, 600 Angstroms) in the imaging mode, and good image quality combined with very small lateral and longitudinal color errors in the spectroscopic mode. The unusual requirement of very low distortion is set by the demands of time-delay-and-integrate (TDI) imaging; (2) Very high precision motion to support open loop TDI observations; and (3) A unique wind baffle/enclosure construction to maximize image quality and minimize construction costs.

AMIGA (Antarctic <b>Multiband</b> Infrared <b>CAmera)</b> is an instrument designed to perform astronomical imaging from Dome-C in the near- (1 - 5 μm) and mid- (5 - 27 μm) infrared wavelength regions.

Cryogenic devices will move a filter wheel and a sliding mirror, used to feed alternatively the two detectors. Fast control and readout, synchronized with the chopping secondary mirror of the telescope, will be required {{because of the large}} background expected at these wavelengths, especially beyond 10 μm.

40|$|This slide {{presentation}} {{reviews the}} development of Multiple Waveband Temperature Sensor (MWTS). The MWTS project {{will result in a}} highly stable, monolithically integrated, high resolution infrared detector array sensor that records registered thermal imagery in four infrared wavebands to infer dynamic temperature profiles on a laser-irradiated ground target. An accurate surface temperature measurement of a target in extreme environments in a non-intrusive manner is required. The development challenge is to: determine optimum wavebands (suitable for target temperatures, nature of the targets and environments) to measure accurate target surface temperature independent of the emissivity, integrate simultaneously readable multiband Quantum Well Infrared Photodetectors (QWIPs) in a single monolithic focal plane array (FPA) sensor and to integrate the hardware/software and system calibration for remote temperature measurements. The charge was therefore to develop and demonstrate a <b>multiband</b> infrared imaging <b>camera</b> with the detectors simultaneously sensitive to multiple distinct color bands for front surface temperature measurements Wavelength (m) measurements. Amongst the requirements are: that the measurement system will not affect target dynamics or response to the laser irradiation and that the simplest criterion for spectral band selection is to choose those practically feasible spectral bands that create the most contrast between the objects or scenes of interest in the expected environmental conditions.

40|$|International audienceIn this paper, an {{extensive}} {{survey of the}} star-forming complex Sh 2 - 252 has been undertaken with an aim to explore its hidden young stellar population {{as well as to}} understand the structure and star formation history for the first time. This complex is composed of five prominent embedded clusters associated with the subregions A, C, E, NGC 2175 s and Teu 136. We used Two Micron All Sky Survey-near-infrared and Spitzer-Infrared Array <b>Camera,</b> <b>Multiband</b> Imaging Photometer for Spitzer photometry to identify and classify the young stellar objects (YSOs) by their infrared (IR) excess emission. Using the IR colour-colour criteria, we identified 577 YSOs, of which, 163 are Class I, 400 are Class II and 14 are transition disc YSOs, suggesting a moderately rich number of YSOs in this complex. Spatial distribution of the candidate YSOs shows that they are mostly clustered around the subregions in the western half of the complex, suggesting enhanced star formation activity towards its west. Using the spectral energy distribution and optical colour-magnitude diagram-based age analyses, we derived probable evolutionary status of the subregions of Sh 2 - 252. Our analysis shows that the region A is the youngest (similar to 0. 5 Myr), the regions B, C and E are of similar evolutionary stage (similar to 1 - 2 Myr) and the clusters NGC 2175 s and Teu 136 are slightly evolved (similar to 2 - 3 Myr). Morphology of the region in the 1. 1 mm map shows a semicircular shaped molecular shell composed of several clumps and YSOs bordering the western ionization front of Sh 2 - 252. Our analyses suggest that next generation star formation is currently under way along this border and that possibly fragmentation of the matter collected during the expansion of the H ii region as one of the major processes is responsible for such stars. We observed the densest concentration of YSOs (mostly Class I, similar to 0. 5 Myr) at the western outskirts of the complex, within a molecular clump associated with water and methanol masers and we suggest that it is indeed a site of cluster formation at a very early evolutionary stage, sandwiched between the two relatively evolved CH ii regions A and B...|$|R
