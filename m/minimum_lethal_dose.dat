40|$|It is {{established}} that an approximately 70 -kb Lcr plasmid enables Yersinia pestis, the causative agent of bubonic plague, to multiply in focal necrotic lesions within visceral organs of mice by preventing net {{synthesis of the}} cytokines tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) and gamma interferon (IFN-gamma), thereby minimizing inflammation (Lcr+). Rabbit antiserum raised against cloned staphylococcal protein A-V antigen fusion peptide (PAV) is known to passively immunize mice against 10 <b>minimum</b> <b>lethal</b> <b>doses</b> of intravenously injected Lcr+ cells of Y. pestis. In this study, injected PAV suppressed TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma in mice challenged with avirulent V antigen-deficient Y. pestis (lcrV or Lcr-) and promoted survival in vivo of these isolates as well as salmonellae and Listeria monocytogenes (with which the outcome was lethal). Active immunization of mice with PAV protected against 1, 000 <b>minimum</b> <b>lethal</b> <b>doses</b> of intravenously injected Lcr+ cells of Y. pestis and Yersinia pseudotuberculosis but not Yersinia enterocolitica. The progressive necrosis provoked by Lcr+ cells of Y. pestis in visceral organs of nonimmunized mice was replaced after active immunization with PAV by massive infiltration of neutrophils and mononuclear cells (which generated protective granulomas indistinguishable from those formed against avirulent Lcr- mutants in nonimmunized mice). Distinct multiple abscesses typical of Lcr+ cells of Y. pseudotuberculosis were prevented by similar immunization. Significant synthesis of TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma occurred in spleens of mice actively immunized with PAV after challenge with Lcr+ cells of Y. pestis.

40|$|LcrV (V antigen), a known {{unstable}} 37. 3 -kDa monomeric peptide encoded on the ca. 70 -kb Lcr plasmid of Yersinia pestis, Yersinia pseudotuberculosis, and Yersinia enterocolitica, {{has been}} implicated as a regulator of the low-calcium response, virulence factor, and protective antigen. In this study, IcrV of Y. pestis was cloned into protease-deficient Escherichia coli BL 21. The resulting recombinant V antigen underwent marked degradation from the C-terminal end during purification, yielding major peptides of 36, 35, 34, and 32 to 29 kDa. Rabbit gamma globulin raised against this mixture of cleavage products provided significant protection against 10 <b>minimum</b> <b>lethal</b> <b>doses</b> of Y. pestis (P < 0. 01) and Y. pseudotuberculosis (P < 0. 02). To both stabilize V antigen and facilitate its purification, plasmid pPAV 13 was constructed {{so as to}} encode a fusion of krV and the structural gene for protein A (i. e., all but the first 67 N-terminal amino acids of V antigen plus the signal sequence and immunoglobulin G-binding domains but not the cell wall-associated region of protein A).

50|$|The {{toxicity}} of the spider’s venom {{is affected by}} the sex of the spider. The male funnel-web spider’s venom appears to be six times more powerful than that of the female spider, based on <b>minimum</b> <b>lethal</b> <b>dose</b> determinations. In addition, different species of animals tend to react to the venom in various ways. For example, rats, rabbits and cats are unaffected by the bite of a female funnel-web spider, whereas for 20 percent of mice and guinea pigs the bite of a female was fatal. A bite of a male funnel-web spider, though, led to the death of almost all mice and guinea pigs.

Administration of both cytokines was required for absolute survival, suggesting a synergistic rather than cumulative interaction. This protective effect entailed cytokine priming as judged by subsequent detection of substantial levels of endogenous IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha. Monospecific anti-V-antigen, known to provide passive immunity against 10 MLD of Lcr+ Y. pestis, permitted significant synthesis of endogenous IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha.
