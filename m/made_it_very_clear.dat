So I felt like, well, I've finally got this thing going but it's dead. Flood and I had to record Broken under a {{different}} band name, because if TVT found out we were recording, they could confiscate all our shit and release it. Jimmy Iovine got involved with Interscope, and we kind of got slave-traded. It wasn't my doing. I didn't know anything about Interscope. And I was real pissed off at him at first because it was going from one bad situation to potentially another one. But Interscope went into it like {{they really wanted to}} know what I wanted. It was good, after I put my raving lunatic act on.|$|E
25|$|November 23: After {{becoming}} {{a free agent}} following the conclusion to the 2011 season, the Braves decided to decline arbitration to shortstop Álex González. If the team had accepted his arbitration they would have received a compensatory draft pick {{between the first and}} second rounds of the 2012 MLB draft if González signed with another team. The move <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>very</b> <b>clear</b> that González would not return as the starting shortstop in 2012. González looked to receive a multi-year contract on the free agent market, something the Braves were not willing to offer due to rising prospects such as Tyler Pastornicky and Andrelton Simmons. On December 8, González signed a contract with the Milwaukee Brewers for one year and a vesting option for the 2013 season.|$|E
25|$|The WACs {{received}} the same pay, allowances, and benefits as regular army units, though time spent as a WAC did not count toward time served and the allowance for dependents was heavily restricted. The WACs were now disciplined, promoted, and given the same legal protections as regular Army units, and the 150,000 ceiling was lifted. While the legislators <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>very</b> <b>clear</b> they expected the WACs to be noncombatants, the bill contained no specific restrictions. Existing Army regulations still prohibited them from combat training with weapons, tactical exercises, duty assignments requiring weapons, supervising men, and jobs requiring great physical strength, unless waived by the United States Secretary of War; but of the 628 Army specialties, women now qualified for 406. Additional Army regulations were adopted to cover pregnancy, marriage, and maternity care.|$|E
40|$|In 1946 {{legislation}} {{was passed in}} the New Zealand parliament which created the body {{now known as the}} Ngai Tahu Maori Trust Board. Its function was to administer compensation from the Crown for land purchased in the mid-nineteenth century. In 1990 the Runanga Iwi Act was passed, devolving the functions and responsibilities formerly {{in the hands of the}} Maori Affairs Department to tribally-based groups. These groups are referred to as iwi authorities. The Ngai Tahu Maori Trust Board made submissions to the Select Committee in 1989 setting out a new tribal structure for Ngni Tahu which could act also as the Ngal Tahu iwi authority. Anthony Giddens and Michel Foucault supply the theory for this research. An attempt is made to move away from the tendency to view power solely in terms of dialectical relationships with the state. For groups such as the Ngal Tahu Maori Trust Board, power to achieve outcomes does not necessarily emanate from the state. Power in New Zealand society is not superstructural to the state, rather, it underlies all social relations. The state is simply one body which exercises power in relationships of domination with various groups in society. The research adopts categories of authoritative resources supplied by Giddens and uses these to examine the strategies and local forms of power relied on by the Trust Board at a time when the entire Maori population, like other segments of the New Zealand population, is being asked to take on greater responsibility to manage their own affairs. Observations <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>clear</b> <b>very</b> early that the Trust Board has developed strategies to achieve outcomes, independent of the state. The pursuit of mana and rangatlratanga for the Ngai Tahu iwi began long before the decision was made to disband the Department of Maori Affairs...|$|R

25|$|According to simulations, a two-lane {{roundabout}} {{with three}} right turns should offer 12–20% greater traffic flow than a conventional, three-lane roundabout {{of the same}} size. The reason is reduced weaving that makes entering and exiting more predictable. Because there are only ten points of conflict (compared with 8 for a conventional single lane roundabout, or between 32 and 64 with traffic signal control), this design is often safer as well. Research and experiments show that traffic accidents are reduced by 72% on turbo roundabouts compared to multi-lane roundabouts, which have 12 points of conflict. Research at Windesheim University also shows that turbo roundabouts reduce accidents including casualties by some 75% when compared to regular intersections, and by 61% compared to single-lane roundabouts. The same research <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>very</b> <b>clear</b> that it is safer for cyclists not to have priority over motor vehicles on the roundabout, than to have it.|$|E
25|$|Parker {{immediately}} {{went to work}} {{to find a new}} label for Presley. Both Mercury Records and Columbia Records showed interest, although their initial offers were nowhere near the $40,000 requirement. RCA Victor, Hank Snow's current label, was also showing an interest, but they were also put off by the cost of the contract. However, RCA Victor producer Steve Sholes was convinced that Presley's style of music would be a huge hit with the right label, and he began talks with Parker. RCA <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>very</b> <b>clear</b> they were unwilling to go above $25,000 for a practically unknown singer, but Parker persuaded them that Presley was no ordinary unknown singer. Around the same time, realizing the deal for Presley might fall through due to the cost of the contract, Parker attempted once again to sell Tommy Sands to RCA. He suggested to Sholes that Sands could record material similar to Presley's style. Sholes, remembering his previous experience with Sands, dismissed him as a viable replacement for Presley.|$|E
25|$|The Company <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>very</b> <b>clear</b> that {{published}} timetables {{were only}} {{to indicate the}} times before which a train would not depart and the specified times for each stop were only given as a rough guide. Trains normally made three regular and eight conditional stops, but 'expresses' did run which did not stop between Bideford and Westward Ho!. With two engines in steam the frequency could be every half-hour, but a train every hour or so was the norm in summer, normally taking about 20 minutes from Bideford to Northam or 15 minutes for the 'express'. Fifteen trains ran in each direction in the July 1906 Bideford to Northam timetable and lighter service of four ran on Sundays. The 1910 Bradshaw's Timetable shows trains taking thirty minutes for the journey from Bideford to Appledore, ten trains in each direction, with an extra run on the Market Days (Tuesdays and Saturdays) and no trains on Sundays. The winter timetable for 1 November 1917 to 30 April 1918, which was destined never to be used, was down to seven trains in each direction and no Sunday service. Horse-drawn buses ran from Westward Ho! to Clovelly and through tickets were issued from Instow to cover the journey by ferry, railway and road transport. The bus service cost £51 18s 0d (£51.90) {{to run for the}} six months ending 31 December 1906.|$|E

500|$|Sir Geoffrey Archer was {{appointed}} Governor-General of Sudan in 1925 {{in place of}} Sir Lee Stack. One of his early decisions was to initiate {{the formation of the}} Sudan Defence Force, with a command completely separate from the Egyptian army. He dropped the Egyptian title [...] "Sirdar" [...] for the supreme commander, and did not wear the Egyptian tarboush. He <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>very</b> <b>clear</b> that he was commander in chief of a purely Sudanese army, while reassuring Sudanese officers who had served in the Egyptian army that they would be retained if they had not taken part in the mutiny. The British authorities, who had again became hostile to Mahdism, banned enlistment of Ansar into the Sudanese Defence Force.|$|E
500|$|While in Italy, Madonna {{met some}} of her {{relatives}} from Pacentro, the village in which her grandfather and grandmother, Gaetano and Michelina Ciccone had been married. However, {{it was not the}} glorious home coming that she had expected; {{some of her}} relatives <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>very</b> <b>clear</b> that they were scandalized by her appearance and behavior. One good thing came from the visit, there were talks of making her an honorary citizen of the town. Ultimately, a statue of Madonna, wearing conical bra was elected in her name, {{at the center of the}} town. The Vatican was outraged by the plans of erecting the statue, with the Pope's spokesperson commenting: [...] "The statue would be too sexy and might corrupt the morals of Italy's fine young people." ...|$|E
500|$|Shortly {{before the}} film was due to air on British {{television}} in December 2012, Hedren gave an interview to the Daily Mail in which she repeated her claims about Hitchcock: [...] "He <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>very</b> <b>clear</b> {{what was expected of}} me, but I was equally clear that I wasn't interested...Nobody is denying that Hitchcock was a brilliant moviemaker and I enjoyed working with him before I realised he was starting to take an almost obsessive interest in me." [...] Other actresses have spoken about the close attention Hitchcock paid to details of the leading ladies' characters and appearances in his films, but they said that no harassment was involved. Eva Marie Saint, who starred in 1959's North by Northwest, told The Daily Telegraph [...] "Hitchcock was a gentleman, he was funny, he was so attentive to me, with the character, and he cared about everything my character Eve Kendall wore. He had an eye for the specifics of the character." ...|$|E

500|$|In {{addition}} to Luna as Reyes and Whitehead as James, guest stars for the episode include Mallory Jansen as Aida, José Zúñiga as Morrow, Kerr Smith as Joseph, Phil Tyler as watchdog #1, Sergio Enrique as guard, Tanner Fontana as Elliot and Lilli Birdsell as Lucy. Luna, Jansen, Whitehead, and Birdsell reprise their roles from {{earlier in the}} series. When asked whether the series still wanted to pursue stories about Inhumans such as James, Whedon said they are [...] "still in our world, so we still have {{some of these people}} in the mix ... but right now we’re on the Ghost Rider kick." [...] On having Johnson and Reyes join up with S.H.I.E.L.D., Whedon called it uneasy [...] "for everyone involved. Daisy has <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>very</b> <b>clear</b> that she doesn’t want to be with our team. There’s all that history and pain there. For Robbie, {{this is a guy who}} has never had a team, and probably doesn’t function well within one. We’ll see pretty quickly that it’s an uneasy alliance and it’s going to cause a lot of drama." ...|$|E
500|$|The Paris {{delegation}}, led by Bertrand Delanoë, {{argued that}} Tony Blair and the London delegation {{had broken the}} IOC rules. On 11 July 2005, Delanoë stated: [...] "They have not respected the rules established by the International Olympic Committee. I do not {{say that they were}} flirting with the yellow line, I say that they crossed the yellow line". A controversial move by the London bid team was its initiative to offer incentive packages for participating athletes, which included free flights, food, vouchers for long-distance calling and other financial accommodations. Immediately after announcing the initiative, London withdrew it, most likely as a result of Jacques Rogge raising concerns over its potential to start a [...] "bidding war". Paris also claimed that the lobbying by Tony Blair was illegal, an accusation that was strongly denied by Downing Street. It was not until 4 August 2005 that Jacques Rogge suppressed any further controversies by saying in a statement: [...] "I <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>very</b> <b>clear</b> that, in my opinion, the competition was fair. It was conducted according to the rules that we have set out". Delanoë's comments were criticised by Parisian political leaders; Claude Goasguen, president of the Union for a Popular Movement (UMP) party of the Council of Paris, stated: [...] "One cannot make such type of accusations without delivering any proof".|$|E
500|$|Producer Bob Ezrin {{had worked}} with Alice Cooper, Lou Reed, and Kiss, as well as {{producing}} Peter Gabriel's debut solo album. At the suggestion of Waters's then-girlfriend Lady Carolyne Christie, who had worked as Ezrin's secretary, the band hired him to co-produce the album. From the start, Waters <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>very</b> <b>clear</b> who was in charge: [...] "You can write anything you want. Just don't expect any credit". [...] Ezrin, Waters, and Gilmour read Waters's concept, keeping what they liked, and discarding {{what they thought was}} not good enough. Waters and Ezrin worked mostly on the story, improving the concept. [...] A 40-page script was presented {{to the rest of the}} band, with positive results: [...] "The next day at the studio, we had a table read, like you would with a play, but with the whole of the band, and their eyes all twinkled, because then they could see the album." [...] Ezrin broadened the storyline, distancing it from the autobiographical work Waters had written, and instead basing it on a composite, or gestalt character named Pink. Engineer Nick Griffiths later said of the Canadian producer, [...] "Ezrin was very good in The Wall, because he did manage to pull the whole thing together. He's a very forceful guy. There was a lot of argument about how it should sound between Roger and Dave, and he bridged the gap between them." [...] Waters wrote most of the album's material, with Gilmour co-writing [...] "Comfortably Numb", [...] "Run Like Hell", and [...] "Young Lust", and Ezrin co-writing [...] "The Trial".|$|E

500|$|Following their collision, Hamilton and Rosberg were {{summoned to}} the {{stewards}} after the race but neither received a penalty, as the stewards rated their crash as a racing incident, with no driver in particular to blame. It emerged that Rosberg had chosen the wrong engine mode for the start, being down on power which led to Hamilton going for a passing manoeuvre. However, Rosberg remained convinced {{that he had done}} nothing wrong, saying: [...] "I <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>very</b> <b>clear</b> I wasn't going to leave any space on the inside and I was very surprised he went for the gap". While Hamilton apologised to the team after the incident, he refused to accept blame for it. Opinions about the incident varied: While Mercedes's executive chairman Niki Lauda blamed Hamilton for the crash, former F1 driver Anthony Davidson said on Sky Sports F1 that Rosberg's move was [...] "very aggressive". Three-time world champion Jackie Stewart said after the race that Mercedes should fine Hamilton for the crash: [...] "Hamilton is to blame. Rosberg was allowed to protect himself. You don't go for it on the first lap." [...] Mercedes's head of motorsport Toto Wolff stressed after the race that the team would continue to let their drivers race against each other freely, a decision praised by former world champion Alain Prost. While Rosberg said after the race that he contemplated having a talk with Hamilton about the situation, Mercedes later decided that they did [...] "not need clear-the-air talks". However, it later emerged that the pair did have a conversation about the incident before the next race in Monaco, which, according to Hamilton, was marked by [...] "pure respect". It was Mercedes's first double retirement since the 2011 Australian Grand Prix, and the first time they failed to score a point since the 2012 United States Grand Prix, ending a 62-race long streak, the third longest in Formula One history.|$|E

2500|$|More {{criticism}} of perceived weakness {{came in the}} midst of an extended confirmation fight over Bush's pick for US ambassador to the United Nations, John R. Bolton. Twice Frist failed to garner the 60 votes to break cloture, getting fewer votes the second time and even losing the support of one moderate Republican (George Voinovich of Ohio). On June 21, 2005, Frist said the situation had been [...] "exhausted" [...] and there would be no more votes. Only an hour later, after speaking to the White House, Frist said: [...] "The president <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>very</b> <b>clear</b> he wants an up-or-down vote." [...] This sudden switch in strategy led to charges of flip-flopping in response to pressure from the Bush administration.
