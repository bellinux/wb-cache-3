5|$|Around 2000, {{the town}} saw a growth in {{residential}} {{drug and alcohol}} rehabilitation treatment centres, with attendant crime and social problems. These problems were highlighted by Weston's councillors and newspapers, and by the MP, John Penrose during his <b>maiden</b> <b>speech</b> in the House of Commons in 2005.|$|E
5|$|Gillard {{was first}} elected to the Australian House of Representatives at the 1998 federal {{election}} representing Lalor, a safe Labor seat near Melbourne, replacing Barry Jones who retired. She made her <b>maiden</b> <b>speech</b> to the House on 11 November 1998.|$|E
5|$|Although {{a member}} of the House of Lords, until the passage of the House of Lords Act in 1999, the 10th Earl of Shaftesbury rarely attended. His <b>maiden</b> <b>speech</b> was made on 10 November 1999. At this time, Shaftesbury made an eight-minute {{presentation}} in a debate regarding arts and sport, a portion of which is presented below.|$|E
40|$|Abstract- Dominique de Villepin’s Maiden Speech: This article {{analyzes}} the last 26 <b>maiden</b> parliamentary <b>speeches</b> (&laquo; d&eacute;clarations de politique g&eacute;n&eacute;rale &raquo;) of French prime ministers since that of J. Chirac, given on 5 June 1974, {{to that of}} Dominique de Villepin, on 8 June 2005. This corpus represents 181, 094 lexical forms, representing 2, 074 distinct forms. A statistical table is constructed by cross-tabulating the 2, 074 lexical forms as the lines and the 26 speeches as the columns to do a factorial correspondence analysis of the data. The resulting graph allows us to situate, in a chronological manner, each of the <b>maiden</b> <b>speechs</b> given by a French prime minister from 1974 to today...|$|R
50|$|Also elected for {{the first}} time in 1950 was another future Liberal leader Jo Grimond in Orkney & Shetland. He and Macdonald were the party's Scottish MPs and they worked {{together}} on Scottish issues. Notably both Grimond and MacDonald devoted their <b>maiden</b> <b>speeches</b> in the House of Commons to devolution. Grimond claimed that the subject would not have been raised in Parliament at that time if it had not been for him and Macdonald.|$|R
50|$|Sinn Féin leader Gerry Adams {{made his}} <b>maiden</b> Dáil <b>speech</b> at around 12:15, {{shortly before the}} role of Ceann Comhairle was decided.|$|R
5|$|Diefenbaker was {{appointed}} to the House Committee on the Defence of Canada Regulations, an all-party committee which examined the wartime rules which allowed arrest and detention without trial. On June 13, 1940, Diefenbaker made his <b>maiden</b> <b>speech</b> as an MP, supporting the regulations, and emphatically stating that most Canadians of German descent were loyal. When the Mackenzie King government sought to force Canadians of Japanese descent from the Pacific Coast, Diefenbaker fought against the government's actions. However, his efforts were unsuccessful, and the forced relocation and internment of many Japanese-Canadians proceeded.|$|E
5|$|During {{his student}} years in England, Jinnah was {{influenced}} by 19th-century British liberalism, like many other future Indian independence leaders. This political education included exposure {{to the idea of}} the democratic nation, and progressive politics. He became an admirer of the Parsi British Indian political leaders Dadabhai Naoroji and Sir Pherozeshah Mehta. Naoroji had become the first British Member of Parliament of Indian extraction shortly before Jinnah's arrival, triumphing with a majority of three votes in Finsbury Central. Jinnah listened to Naoroji's <b>maiden</b> <b>speech</b> in the House of Commons from the visitor's gallery.|$|E
5|$|Gordon Brown visited Doncaster North {{during the}} general {{election}} campaign to support his former adviser. Miliband was elected on 5 May 2005, with 55.5% of the vote {{and a majority of}} 12,656. He made his <b>maiden</b> <b>speech</b> in the House of Commons on 23 May, responding to comments made by future Speaker John Bercow. In Tony Blair's frontbench reshuffle in May 2006, he was made Parliamentary Secretary to the Cabinet Office, as Minister for the Third Sector, with responsibility for voluntary and charity organisations.|$|E
50|$|Returning to the Foreign Service, {{he became}} {{principal}} private secretary to two ministers {{and played a}} significant role in the Egyptian and Turkish crises in the early 1920s, before winning a seat in Parliament as a Conservative for Oldham in 1924. He gave one of the most acclaimed <b>maiden</b> <b>speeches</b> of the era and became a stalwart supporter of Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin, and a friend of Chancellor of the Exchequer, Winston Churchill. Cooper became Financial Secretary to the War Office in January 1928, before losing his seat in the 1929 election when the Conservative Party lost power.|$|R
50|$|Clark’s <b>maiden</b> {{parliamentary}} <b>speech</b> {{focused on}} his concern about rising inequality and his passion for social justice. In it, he argued that a more equal society will produce better outcomes, both socially and economically.|$|R
6000|$|But Archie {{certainly}} was unusually excited, and when someone remembered {{that it was}} the anniversary of Uncle Jem's wedding, and wished he was there to make a speech, his son electrified the family by trying to do it for him. It was rather incoherent and flowery, as <b>maiden</b> <b>speeches</b> are apt to be, but the end was considered superb; for, turning to his mother with a queer little choke in his voice, he said that she [...] "deserved to be blessed with peace and plenty, to be crowned with roses and lads'-love, and to receive the cargo of happiness sailing home to her in spite of wind or tide to add another Jem to the family jewels." ...|$|R
5|$|Hesketh was {{appointed}} High Sheriff of Lancashire in 1830. In 1831 {{he was invited}} to stand as a Tory Party candidate for the constituency of Preston. He had similar views to Tory statesman Robert Peel and readily agreed to stand. Hesketh-Fleetwood opposed monopolies, slavery and capital punishment and was in favour of reforming the Corn Laws. At the 1832 general election, he was elected—along with his friend, Henry Stanley—Member of Parliament for Preston, in the first parliament following the Reform Act. He made his <b>maiden</b> <b>speech</b> to parliament in 1834.|$|E
5|$|My Lords, I apologise to noble Lords {{for this}} {{dramatic}} last-minute but not opportunistic <b>maiden</b> <b>speech.</b> Although I inherited my title 30 {{years ago and}} have attended spasmodically, particularly during the early 1970s when we rigorously debated the Industrial Relations Bill and the European Community Bill of Accession, both in Committee and on Report until extremely late at night, my heart has not entirely been in the thrust and cut of politics, unlike my more distinguished ancestors.|$|E
5|$|After his <b>maiden</b> <b>speech,</b> Breckinridge took a {{more active}} role in the House. In debate with Ohio's Joshua Reed Giddings, he defended the Fugitive Slave Law's {{constitutionality}} and criticized Giddings for hindering the return of fugitive slaves. He opposed Tennessee Congressman Andrew Johnson's Homestead Bill, fearing it would create more territories that excluded slavery. Although generally opposed to funding local improvements, he supported the repair of two Potomac River bridges to avoid higher costs later. Other minor stands included supporting measures to benefit his district's hemp farmers, voting against giving the president ten more appointments to the U.S. Naval Academy, and opposing funds for a sculpture of George Washington because the sculptor proposed depicting Washington in a toga.|$|E
50|$|At the 2016 Auckland elections, Newman {{was elected}} to the Auckland Council, outpolling Cr Sir John Walker and {{defeating}} incumbent Calum Penrose. He was one of only two candidates to win election by defeating an incumbent councillor in 2016. He made his <b>maiden</b> council <b>speech</b> on 2 November 2016.|$|R
5000|$|Walker is a {{long term}} {{supporter}} of both Worcester RFC [...] "The Worcester Warriors" [...] and the Worcestershire County Cricket Club. He wore the Worcestershire CCC tie whilst delivering his <b>maiden</b> parliamentary <b>speech</b> in the House of Commons. On 9 April 2011, Walker married Charlotte Keenan, former Chief Executive of the Tony Blair Faith Foundation.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah!--I {{thought you}} had some such feeling as that, and {{therefore}} I was determined to speak to you. You may be sure, Finn, that I do not care to flatter you, and I {{think you ought to}} know that, as far as I am able, I will tell you the truth. Your speech, which was certainly nothing great, was about on a par with other <b>maiden</b> <b>speeches</b> in the House of Commons. You have done yourself neither good nor harm. Nor was it desirable that you should. My advice to you now is, never to avoid speaking on any subject that interests you, but never to speak for above three minutes till you find yourself as much at home on your legs as you are when sitting. But do not suppose that you have made an ass of yourself,--that is, in any special degree. Now, good-night." ...|$|R
5|$|On 2 July 1942 Driberg {{cast his}} first {{vote in the}} House of Commons, in support of Churchill against a rebel motion of censure on the government's conduct of the war. The rebels' case was put incompetently, which ensured that the motion gained only 25 votes, as against 477 cast for the government. Driberg {{delivered}} his <b>maiden</b> <b>speech</b> on 7 July, in a debate {{on the use of}} propaganda. He called for the lifting of the ban on the Communist Party's newspaper, the Daily Worker, which he saw as a potentially valuable weapon of home propaganda.|$|E
5|$|Since 1789, {{the press}} had been speculating that Garrow, a Whig, would enter Parliament; however {{he was first}} elected in 1805 for Gatton. This was a rotten borough, with Garrow {{appointed}} to {{serve the interests of}} his patron. After his entry into politics Garrow at first paid little attention, not making his <b>maiden</b> <b>speech</b> until 22 April 1806, when he opposed a charge for the impeachment of Marquess Wellesley. He spoke again on 18 June 1806 on a legal technicality, and after that did not intervene for another six years. Braby and other sources indicate that he did not enjoy his time in Parliament, and was rarely there unless required to conduct some business.|$|E
5|$|Because of Southern Rhodesia's {{small size}} {{and lack of}} major controversies, its unicameral {{parliament}} then sat only twice a year, for about three months in total, holding discussions in the afternoons {{either side of a}} half-hour break for tea on the lawn. Smith's early parliamentary commitments in Salisbury therefore did not detract greatly from his ranching. His <b>maiden</b> <b>speech</b> to the Legislative Assembly, in November 1948, concerned the Union of South Africa Trade Agreement Bill, then at its second reading. He was slow to make an impact in parliament—most of his early contributions related to farming and mining—but his exertions within the party won him Stockil's respect and confidence. Janet ran Gwenoro during Smith's absences, and gave birth to his only biological child, Alec, in Gwelo on 20 May 1949.|$|E
5000|$|Arun Jaitley, Finance Minister and Defence Minister, in his <b>maiden</b> Budget <b>Speech</b> in the parliament, says, [...] "We reaffirm our {{commitment}} to our brave soldiers. A policy of 'One Rank One Pension' has been adopted by the Government to address the pension disparities. We propose to set aside a further sum of [...] 1,000 crore to meet this year's requirement" ...|$|R
25|$|Helped by {{his second}} wife, {{who had been}} a popular music hall artiste under her maiden name of Betty Frankiss, Johnson won by 3,001 votes. He made his <b>maiden</b> Parliamentary <b>speech</b> in May 1950, on the subject of {{controls}} on housing, about which he had professional experience as a director of land and property development companies. Johnson opposed restrictions except to control the size of new homes. Taking up a constituency interest, in June 1950 he called for reform of the licensing laws.|$|R
50|$|He {{has made}} one <b>speech,</b> both his <b>maiden</b> and final <b>speech,</b> in the House of Lords on 25 November 1998, {{less than one}} year before his {{automatic}} right to sit in the House of Lords was removed by the House of Lords Act 1999.|$|R
5|$|In 1891, Fisher {{was elected}} {{as the first}} {{president}} of the Gympie branch of the Labour Party. In 1893, {{he was elected to the}} Legislative Assembly of Queensland as Labour member for Gympie and by the following year had become Labour's deputy leader in the Legislative Assembly. In his <b>maiden</b> <b>speech,</b> he pushed for a 50% decrease in military spending and declared support for a federation. Another policy area that captured his attention during this term, was the employment of workers from the Pacific Islands in sugar plantations, a practice that Fisher and Labour both strongly opposed. He lost his seat in 1896 following a campaign in which he was charged by his opponent Jacob Stumm with being a dangerous revolutionary and an anti-Catholic, accusations that were propagated by the newspaper Gympie Times.|$|E
5|$|When Borah went to Washington for the Senate's regular {{session in}} December 1907, he was {{immediately}} {{a figure of}} note, {{not only for the}} dramatic events in Idaho, but for keeping his Western habits, including wearing a ten-gallon hat. It was then the custom that junior senators wait perhaps a year before giving their <b>maiden</b> <b>speech,</b> but at Roosevelt's request, in April 1908, Borah spoke in defense of the president's dismissal of over a hundred African American soldiers in the Brownsville Affair, their cause pressed by the fiery Ohio senator, Joseph B. Foraker. The soldiers were supposed to have shot up a Texas town, and Borah stated that their alleged actions were as wrongful as the murder of Steunenberg. The accusations were later deemed to be motivated by racism, and in 1972, long after the deaths of Roosevelt, Borah, and most of the soldiers, the dismissals were reversed.|$|E
5|$|During her <b>maiden</b> <b>speech</b> on 17 May 1999, Lamont was {{the first}} MSP to use Gaelic at a sitting of the Parliament. She served {{on a number of}} the Parliament's {{committees}} during her first term in office, including the Equal Opportunities Committee, the Local Government Committee and the Social Justice Committee. She became convener of the Social Justice Committee in 2001. In 2000 she became the first Labour MSP to rebel against the Labour-led administration when she threatened to lead backbenchers in voting against a planned Scottish Executive attempt to block the Abolition of Poindings and Warrant Sales Bill, which had been introduced by Sheridan. The move resulted in the withdrawal of the amendment, and a crucial parliamentary vote in favour of the legislation. At a session of First Minister's Questions in 2002, she narrowly avoided becoming the first MSP to be ejected from the parliament after continuing to speak when Presiding Officer David Steel had told her to sit down. Steel felt her supplementary question about youth crime was too long, but the incident led to a heated parliamentary debate, and accusations from Lamont's colleague, Labour's Helen Eadie that the Presiding Officer was not treating male and female MSPs equally, an allegation he rejected.|$|E
50|$|Hare entered London life, {{where his}} status as a wit was {{generally}} recognised. He associated with the fashionable set of Frederick Howard, 5th Earl of Carlisle, Earl Fitzwilliam, General Richard FitzPatrick, Charles James Fox, and Anthony Morris Storer. He sat for the borough of , in Hampshire, from May 1772 to 1774, and then for , a constituency controlled by the Duke of Devonshire, from 3 July 1781 until his death in 1804. He broke down in his <b>maiden</b> parliamentary <b>speech,</b> and never made a second attempt.|$|R
50|$|During McMahon's {{period in}} office, Neville Bonner joined the Senate {{and became the}} first Indigenous Australian in the Australian Parliament. Bonner was chosen by the Liberal Party to fill a Senate vacancy in 1971 and celebrated his <b>maiden</b> {{parliamentary}} <b>speech</b> with a boomerang throwing display on the lawns of Parliament. Bonner went on to win election at the 1972 election and served as a Liberal Senator for 12 years. He worked on Indigenous and social welfare issues and proved an independent minded Senator, often crossing the floor on Parliamentary votes.|$|R
5000|$|Jayalalithaa denied {{claims that}} MGR, {{who had been}} chief {{minister}} for the state since 1977, was instrumental in introducing her to politics. In 1982, she joined the AIADMK, which was founded by MGR. Her <b>maiden</b> public <b>speech,</b> [...] "Pennin Perumai" [...] ("The Greatness of a Woman"), was delivered at the AIADMK's political conference {{in the same year}} and was well received, including by the then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi and the Rajya Sabha member Khushwant Singh. In 1983, she became propaganda secretary for the party and campaigned extensively for the party candidate in the by-election for the Tiruchendur Assembly constituency.|$|R
25|$|In his <b>maiden</b> <b>speech</b> on 24 February 2010, Hughes {{declared}} {{his support for}} a New Zealand republic.|$|E
25|$|Holt opposed socialism, but favoured a more {{equitable}} distribution of resources. From his <b>maiden</b> <b>speech</b> onwards, he emphasised the importance of physical fitness.|$|E
25|$|In 1830 the Marquess of Lansdowne invited Macaulay {{to become}} Member of Parliament for the pocket borough of Calne. His <b>maiden</b> <b>speech</b> was {{in favour of}} abolishing the civil disabilities of the Jews in the UK.|$|E
5000|$|In 1949, he {{was elected}} to the Australian House of Representatives as the Liberal member for North Sydney, a {{position}} he held until his retirement in 1966. During his parliamentary service, Jack earned the sobriquet [...] "Silent Billy" [...] because he only made five speeches in the House in 17 years, including his <b>maiden</b> and farewell <b>speeches.</b>|$|R
50|$|In his <b>maiden</b> {{election}} <b>speech,</b> Tan {{underscored the}} lack of a social safety net for the elderly in Singapore and the influx of foreigners that has diluted Singaporeans' identity. Other campaigning issues he took on included the state of overcrowding, cost of living and {{the lack of}} transparency and accountability in the national retirement fund, the Central Provident Fund, and the national reserves. In one of his speeches, Tan questioned Dr Vivian Balakrishnan about statements Balakrishnan had made about the government wealth fund GIC's portfolio having returned to pre-crisis levels and claimed that no statistics or figures were provided to back up the statements.|$|R
5000|$|Paech is {{the first}} openly gay {{indigenous}} MP in Australia. [...] He gave his <b>maiden</b> parliamentary <b>speech</b> on 19 October 2016, {{in which he said}} he entered the chamber [...] "eternally proud of who I am and where I come from ... I am young, I am gay, I am black; a true-blue Territorian. I am a proud face of the diversity and future of the great Australian Labor party." [...] He added: [...] "I look forward to the day when this country will recognise my rights as equal rights, when I too can marry in my country, on my country, as a recognised first Australian." ...|$|R
