Materials and Methods: The study was approved by the local Ethics Committee and all participants provided informed consent. The study included 152 consecutive patients with 173 breast lesions diagnosed on MG or CESM. All MG examinations and consults were conducted in one oncology centre.

40|$|One of {{the current}} methods in breast cancer {{detection}} is Sonography, also known as Ultrasound imaging. Sonography is effective for imaging soft tissues {{of the body and}} returns a high resolution image. Its operation is highly subjective depending on the operator and the images do vary with positioning. At the University of Sussex we have successfully built an automated and repeatable Ultrasound scanner and combined and reconstructed the data in 3 D. Ultrasound imaging does have its limitations when it comes to cancer detection and diagnosis.

40|$|Mammographic {{examination}} {{is highly}} important considering that {{breast cancer is}} the most frequent carcinoma in women in the Czech Republic. Of course, the quality of mammographic images depends on {{all parts of the}} imaging chain including a proper scanning technique and proper positioning of the patient as the breast should be sufficiently captured in the highest extent possible, including the pectoral muscle. Proper exposure and general quality of the images are also necessary in order to show discrete calcifications that may be the single sign of any pathological process in the breast.

40|$|Purpose: Contrast-enhanced digital {{mammography}} is {{an image}} subtraction technique that is able to improve the detectability of lesions in dense breasts. One of the main sources of error, when the technique is performed by means of commercial <b>mammography</b> <b>devices,</b> {{is represented by the}} intrinsic polychromaticity of the x-ray beams. The aim of the work is to propose an iterative procedure, which only assumes the knowledge of a small set of universal quantities, {{to take into account the}} polychromaticity and correct the subtraction results accordingly. Methods: In order to verify the procedure, it has been applied to an analytical simulation of a target containing a contrast medium and to actual radiographs of a breast phantom containing cavities filled with a solution of the same medium. Results: The reconstructed densities of contrast medium were compared, showing very good agreement between the theoretical predictions and the experimental results already after the first iteration. Furthermore, the convergence of the iterative procedure was studied, showing that only a small number of iterations is necessary to reach limiting values. Conclusions: The proposed procedure represents an efficient solution to the polychromaticity issue, qualifying therefore as a viable alternative to inverse-map functions...|$|E
40|$|Most nuclear {{medicine}} physicists were trained on devices aimed at functional neuroimaging. The clinical goals of brain-centered devices differ dramatically from the parameters {{needed to be}} useful in the breast clinic. We will discuss similarities and differences that impact on design considerations, and describe our latest generation of positron emission mammography and intraoperative products. Source of physiologic contrast: Clinical neuroimaging depends on flow agents to detect the presence of breaks in the blood-brain barrier. Breast flow agents are nonspecific, and may miss preinvasive lesions. Resolution: Brain cancers are generally diagnosed at late stages, so resolution is not so critical. Detecting early breast cancers, and specifying margins for surgery requires 3 mm spatial resolution or better. Prevalence: Primary brain cancer is uncommon, and lesions mimicking brain cancer are rare. Primary breast cancer is common, and benign lesions are even more common, so specificity and biopsy capability are very important. Anatomic references: Brain structure is standard, while breast structure is highly variable, requiring immobilization/compression for physiologic imaging and biopsy. Surgery: Complete cancer resections for brain are very rare, but are possible for breast with appropriate imaging guidance, implying the need for rapid and reliable imaging. To summarize, the breast clinic needs a rapid and highly sensitive method of assessing breast physiology, compatible with biopsy and surgery.

40|$|Here {{an image}} {{restoration}} {{on the basis}} of pixel simultaneous detection probabilities (PSDP) is proposed. These probabilities can be precisely determined by means of correlations measurement [NIMA 586 (2008) 314 - 326]. The proposed image restoration is based on the solution of matrix equation. Non-zero elements of Toeplitz block matrix with ones on the main diagonal, is determined using PSDP. The number of non zero descending diagonals depends on the detector construction and is not always smaller than 8. To solve the matrix equation, the Gaussian elimination algorithm is used. The proposed restoration algorithm is studied by means of the simulated images (with and without additive noise using PSDP for General Electric Senographe 2000 D <b>mammography</b> <b>device</b> detector) and a small area (160 x 160 pixels) of real images acquired by the above mentioned device. The estimation errors of PSDP and the additive noise magnitude permits to restore images with the precision better than 3 % for the above mentioned detector. The additive noise in the real image is present after restoration and almost has the same magnitude. In the restored small area (16 x 16 mm) of real images, the pixel responses are not correlated. The spatial resolution improvement is also analyzed by the image of an absorber edge.

40|$|Introduction One of {{the best}} methods in the {{diagnosis}} and control of breast cancer is mammography.  The importance of mammography {{is directly related to}} its value in the detection of breast cancer in the early stages, which leads to a more effective treatment. The purpose of this article was to calculate the X-ray spectrum in a mammography system with Monte Carlo codes, including MCNPX and MCNP 5. Materials and Methods The device, simulated using the MCNP code, was Planmed Nuance digital <b>mammography</b> <b>device</b> (Planmed Oy, Finland), equipped with an amorphous selenium detector. Different anode/filter materials, such as molybdenum-rhodium (Mo-Rh), molybdenum-molybdenum (Mo-Mo), tungsten-tin (W-Sn), tungsten-silver (W-Ag), tungsten-palladium (W-Pd), tungsten-aluminum (W-Al), tungsten-molybdenum (W-Mo), molybdenum-aluminum (Mo-Al), tungsten-rhodium (W-Rh), rhodium-aluminum (Rh-Al), and rhodium-rhodium (Rh-Rh), were simulated in this study. The voltage range of the X-ray tube was between 24 and 34 kV with a 2 kV interval. Results The charts of changing photon flux versus energy were plotted for different types of anode-filter combinations. The comparison with the findings reported by others indicated acceptable consistency. Also, the X-ray spectra, obtained from MCNP 5 and MCNPX codes for W-Ag and W-Rh combinations, were compared. We compared the present results with the reported data of MCNP 4 C and IPEM report No. 78 for Mo-Mo, Mo-Rh, and W-Al combinations. Conclusion The MCNPX calculation outcomes showed acceptable results in a low-energy X-ray beam range (10 - 35 keV). The obtained simulated spectra for different anode/filter combinations were in good conformity with the finding of previous research...|$|R

40|$|Objectives - Identify radiographers’ postures during {{frequent}} mammography procedures {{related to}} the mammography equipment and patient characteristics. Methods - A postural task analysis was performed using images acquired during the simulation of mammography positioning procedures. Simulations included craniocaudal/(CC) and mediolateral-oblique/(MLO) positioning in three different settings: radiographers and patients with similar statures, radiographers smaller than the patients and radiographers taller than the patients. Measurements of postural angles were performed by two raters using adequate software and classified according to the European Standard EN 1005 - 4 : 2005 + A 1 : 2008. Results - The simulations revealed that the most awkward posture in mammography is during the positioning of MLO projection in short-stature patients. Postures identified as causing work-related musculoskeletal disorder (WRMSD) risk were neck extension, arms elevated and the back stooped, presenting angles of 87. 2, 118. 6 and 63. 6, respectively. If radiographers were taller than patients, then the trunk and arm postures were not acceptable. Conclusions - Working in a mammography room leads to awkward postures that {{can have an impact}} on radiographers’ health, namely WRMSDs. The results in this study showed that there are non-acceptable postures associated with frequent working procedures in mammography. MLO is the most demanding procedure for radiographer postures and may be related to WRMSDs. <b>Mammography</b> <b>devices</b> should be redesigned considering adjustability for radiographers.

40|$|Breast {{cancer is}} {{currently}} the most common non-skin cancer and the second leading cause of cancer-related death in women here in the United States. X-ray mammography {{is currently the}} standard clinical imaging modality for breast cancer screening and diagnosis due to its high sensitivity and resolution at a low patient dose. With the advancement of breast imaging from analog to digital, quantitative measurements rather than qualitative assessments {{can be made from}} these images. One such measurement, mammographic breast density (i. e. the percentage of the entire breast volume that is taken up by dense glandular tissue), {{has been shown to be}} a biomarker well correlated with cancer risk. However, a digital mammogram still suffers from its projective nature. The resulting overlap of normal breast tissue can obscure lesions, limit quantitative measurement accuracy, and present false alarms leading to unnecessary recall studies. To address this key limitation, several 3 D imaging techniques have been developed such as breast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), dedicated breast computed tomography (CT), and digital breast tomosynthesis (tomo). Perhaps the most recently developed modality is tomo, which is a limited-angle cone-beam CT of the breast compressed in the same geometry as mammography. Because tomo retains all the aforementioned advantages of mammography but adds depth information and can be built based on an existing digital <b>mammography</b> <b>device,</b> measuring breast density and extracting other quantitative features from tomo images was a major focus of this study. Before attempting to measure breast density and other features from reconstructed tomo image volumes, the quantitative potential of this imaging modality was assessed. First, we explored a slice-by-slice technique that measures tissue density using only the information from a single slice from the reconstructed tomosynthesis volume with geometrically simple tissue-equivalent phantoms. Once this task has been satisfactorily performed, we studied a probabilistic approach toward quantitation of the entire 3 D volume. Some work has been done previously in the realm of 2 D hidden Markov random fields (HMRFs) to categorize mammograms according to their Wolf pattern, detect mammographic lesions, and segment satellite and mixed media (text/photograph) images. For this project, a 3 D hidden Markov model (HMM) method was developed and applied to tomo images under the simplified assumption that the possible tissue type of each tomo voxel is either adipose (fatty) or glandular (dense). Because adipose and glandular tissue is easily distinguished in MR images, patient breast MRIs were used to train, validate, and finally to assess the accuracy of our HMM segmentation algorithm when applied to tomo images by comparing the volumetric breast density to the MRI breast density for the same patient. Because they are so often studied conjunctively, several image texture features were calculated and compared between MRI and tomo as well. Another aim of our study was to investigate whether changes in macroscopic 3 D imaging features (texture and density) can accurately predict the chemoprevention response that was measured with Random Periareolar Fine Needle Aspiration (RPFNA) cytology for a uniquely young high-risk cohort of women. This aim to investigate the potential of combining multi-modality macroscopic 3 D imaging information with a cytological measure of risk and then investigating how response to tamoxifen and other chemoprevention treatment affects each of these risk biomarkers in young, high-risk women is completely novel in the fields of medical physics and biomedical engineering.

40|$|The Electrical Impedance <b>Mammography</b> (EIM) <b>device</b> is an {{imaging system}} {{developed}} at the University of Sussex {{for the detection of}} breast lesions in vivo using quadrature detection of impedance. The work describes a novel technique to integrate Ultrasound-guided Focused Ultrasound Surgery (USgFUS) with the existing EIM system. The benefits that such a system could provide include the possibility of non-invasive detection, diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer all within a single device and involving no radiation. Furthermore the timescales involved would allow the process to be considered an outpatient procedure such that a patient can be diagnosed and treated on the same day using the same device. Various geometries of transducer were investigated for physical compatibility as well as the ability to target the entire specified volume, based on the dimensions of the existing system. Simulations were performed using a custom written code based on Huygen’s principle, allowing minimum surface area and power requirements to be determined and feasibility of designs to be evaluated. The use of phase differences in the excitation signals applied to individual elements was also investigated, thus the effect of steering the simulated focus could be observed, an important factor to consider when attempting to incorporate a transducer into a device with restricted dimensions. Resulting simulated pressure fields were used to obtain acoustic intensity fields, which could then be used as inputs in the Pennes Bio-Heat Transfer Equation (BHTE) allowing temperature distributions to be observed. Preliminary studies proved the feasibility of using the suggested transducer design in conjunction with the existing EIM system. Pressure fields and heating patterns were all within acceptable limits, confirming the ability of the device to effectively ablate cancerous tissue. Additionally the capability to steer the resultant focal point was validated, and a thermal dose model was implemented allowing different heating patterns to be quantitatively compared...|$|R
40|$|Purpose, Objectives Differential phase {{contrast}} and scattering-based X-ray mammography {{is known to}} provide additional and complementary diagnostic information and may provide additional and complementary clinically relevant information compared with absorption-based mammography. This new diagnostic technology {{has the potential to}} {{play a crucial role in}} medical diagnostics. The preliminary results presented report on the first mammographic investigation of five native, i. e. - freshly dissected, breasts carried out with a grating interferometer and a conventional X-ray tube source. Four patients in this initial study had histopathologically-proven invasive breast cancer. One male patient, without the presence of any malignant formations within the resected breast, was included as a control specimen. Another investigation evaluated the method of differential {{phase contrast}} mammography to distinguish between benign and malignant microcalcifications with the benefit to increase accuracy of early breast cancer diagnosis. Two major types of microcalcifications may be distinguished within breast tissue. Type I microcalcifications consist of calcium oxalate dehydrate whereas type II microcalcifications are composed of calcium phosphates. Type I may most frequently be seen in benign lesions whereas type II may be indicative for proliferative lesions, including invasive carcinoma. The goal of this study is to distinguish the two types of microcalcifications by the use of a non-invasive approach. After these first evaluations of the mammographic investigation, in an additional step the new technology has been evaluated with regard to image quality and clinical relevance by the use of two blinded international multicenter reader studies. Patients and Methods We used a Talbot-Lau grating setup installed on a conventional, low-brilliance X-ray source: the interferometer operated at the 5 th Talbot distance, at a tube voltage of 40 kVp with mean energy of 28 keV and at a current of 25 mA. The device simultaneously recorded absorption, differential phase and small-angle scattering signals from the native breast tissue. These quantities were then combined into novel color- and high-frequency-enhanced radiographic images. Pre-surgical images (conventional mammography, ultrasonography and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)) supported the findings and clinical relevance was verified. Based on these results, indicating clinical relevance, we investigated non-fixed mastectomy samples of 33 patients with invasive breast cancer, using the described grating-based differential phase contrast <b>mammography</b> (mammoDPC) <b>device.</b> We simultaneously recorded absorption, differential phase contrast, and small-angle scattering signals that were combined into high-frequency-enhanced images with a dedicated image fusion algorithm. Six international, expert breast radiologists evaluated clinical digital and experimental mammograms in a two-part blinded reader study. The results were statistically analyzed in terms of image quality and clinical relevance. Results The first approach yielded complementary and otherwise inaccessible information on the electron density distribution and the small-angle scattering power of the breast samples at the microscopic scale. This information can be transferred into imaging improvement and may be used to address clinically-relevant, yet unresolved questions such as: unequivocally discerning between malignant and pre-malignant changes and post-operative scars and distinguishing cancer-invaded regions within healthy tissue. First unpublished results presented here of phase contrast mammography indicate that this technique implies the potential to distinguish between different types of microcalcifications and therefore may serve as a crucial step forward to improve early breast cancer diagnosis. On the basis of the presented results, the comparison of mammoDPC with clinical digital mammography by the blinded reader studies revealed the general quality of the images to be significantly superior (p< 0. 001), sharpness and lesion delineation as well as general visibility of calcifications to be significantly more assessable (p< 0. 001) and delineation of surface structures to be significantly sharper (p< 0. 001). Spiculations were significantly better identified by the readers and the overall clinically relevant information provided by mammoDPC was judged to be superior (p< 0. 001). Conclusions With the approaches described to investigate native breast tissue samples by the use of the differential phase contrast mammography the first and unique ex-vivo images of fresh, native breast tissue could be obtained from mastectomy specimens using grating interferometry. By the use of fusion algorithms, we demonstrate that fused images of absorption, phase contrast and scattering signals acquired with mammoDPC have the potential to deliver enhanced digital mammography. This technique allows to distinguish between different types of microcalcifications within breast tissue and therefore may serve as a new non-invasive tool in early breast cancer diagnosis. The complementary information gained by this technique yielded clinical images of generally superior quality and has the potential to lead to improved radiological breast diagnostics. The promising presented results advanced us toward the ultimate goal: using grating interferometry in-vivo on humans in a clinical setting...|$|R
