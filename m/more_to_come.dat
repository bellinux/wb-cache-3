5|$|The silver medals {{from the}} 2007 Osaka World Championships boosted Bolt's desire to run, {{and he took}} a more serious, more mature stance towards his career. Bolt {{continued}} to develop in the 100 m, and he entered to run in the event at the Jamaica Invitational in Kingston. On 3 May 2008, Bolt ran a time of 9.76 s, with a 1.8 m/s tail wind, improving his personal best from 10.03 s. This was the second-fastest legal performance {{in the history of the}} event, second only to compatriot Asafa Powell's 9.74 s record set the previous year in Rieti, Italy. Rival Tyson Gay lauded the performance, praising Bolt's form and technique especially. Michael Johnson, who was observing the race, said that he was shocked at how quickly he had improved over the 100 m distance.

25|$|Coen had an {{indifferent}} {{season in}} 1925–26, but in 1926–27 he suddenly {{emerged as one}} of the top cricketers in South Africa, with 737 runs in the season at an average of 73.70 and, having previously not taken a single wicket, 14 wickets as well. The runs and wickets came not just against the weaker sides: in the match against Transvaal, he took four wickets for 92 runs in Transvaal's first innings and then, when Orange Free State had been set an unlikely 559 to win, he made 172 in the second innings, so the game was lost by only 111 runs. The following match, against Natal he was promoted to open the innings and made 165, putting on 305 for the second wicket with Mick Commaille; this was then somewhat overshadowed by a first-wicket partnership of 424 for Natal, but it remains the highest second-wicket partnership in first-class cricket for Orange Free State. There was <b>more</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> in the next match. Coen made 87 in the first innings of the game against Eastern Province and then, again in partnership with Commaille, he hit 132 out of an unbroken first-wicket stand of 236 which also remains as an Orange Free State/Free State record and which won the match.|$|E
