5|$|The RAAF's C-17s {{responded to}} several other natural {{disasters}} between late 2011 and 2013. In October 2011 a Globemaster flew a {{water purification plant}} to Samoa, from where it was transported by Royal New Zealand Air Force aircraft to Tuvalu. C-17s also transported supplies to Fiji and Samoa in December 2012 following Cyclone Evan. In January 2013 two Globemasters flew power generators and transformers from Amberley to Hobart following the Tasmanian bushfires. Later that month C-17s were used to transport aviation fuel and other supplies into the Queensland town of Bundaberg after it was affected by heavy flooding. In November 2013 a Globemaster flew a civilian <b>medical</b> <b>team</b> and its equipment from Australia to Cebu in the Philippines {{as part of the}} relief effort following Typhoon Haiyan; an RAAF C-130 subsequently transported the <b>medical</b> <b>team</b> from Cebu to Tacloban in the disaster zone.|$|E
5|$|After the Sierra Leone Civil War {{began in}} 1991, the CDC closed their program in Segbwema. Conteh and his <b>medical</b> <b>team</b> moved from Segbwema to the Kenema Government Hospital (KGH), {{where he spent}} the next two decades running the only {{dedicated}} Lassa fever ward in the world. Conteh collaborated with the British charity Merlin to promote public health in Sierra Leone through education and awareness campaigns intended to prevent Lassa fever. With little funding and few supplies, Conteh successfully reduced mortality rates and saved many lives until an accidental needlestick injury led to his own death from the disease in 2004.|$|E

He was dragged back to the helicopter and flown to the <b>medical</b> <b>team</b> aboard the RFA Sir Percivale, dying despite intensive resuscitation attempts on board. The SAS proceeded to clear the village, engaging those West Side Boys who offered resistance and capturing those who surrendered, including Foday Kallay.|$|E

The crew could not shoot in Egypt because of the unstable political conditions. To avoid dehydration in the scorching heat of the Sahara, the production's <b>medical</b> <b>team</b> created a drink that the cast and crew had to consume every two hours. Sandstorms were daily inconveniences. Snakes, spiders and scorpions were a major problem, with many crew members having to be airlifted out after being bitten.|$|E

5|$|After the storm, {{communication}} disruptions on Socotra made {{it difficult}} for relief workers to determine the needs of the affected residents. Due to the main port being damaged, residents built a makeshift pathway to assist relief distribution from a ship carrying 700tons of supplies from the United Arab Emirates. Relief distribution was also disrupted by the heavy damage to Socotra's infrastructure, including damaged roads and minimal power or fuel supply. After the storm, displaced residents stayed in public buildings or outside damaged houses. Due to the collective impacts of Chapala and Megh, various Persian Gulf countries sent 43planes with supplies to the island by 19November. The United Arab Emirates sent a ship and a plane, carrying 500tons of food, 10tons of blankets and tents, and 1,200barrels of food. The local Red Cross gave cooked meals and tarps to the island's residents. The International Organization for Migration provided 2,000shelter kits as well as a <b>medical</b> <b>team</b> to Socotra.|$|E
5|$|The Yemeni Government {{declared}} a state of emergency for Socotra shortly after the storm's passage on 1November. The local Red Cross gave cooked meals and tarps to the island's residents.

The planes mostly carried food, as well as blankets and tents. The United Arab Emirates also sent a ship and a plane, carrying 500tons of food, 10tons of blankets and tents, and 1,200barrels of food.

5|$|The 2007 All-Africa Games {{represented}} a double landmark victory for Zersenay: {{he became the}} first Eritrean medallist in the competition's history, and won his first ever gold medal on the track, sealing victory in the 10,000 m final with a Games record time of 27:00.30. The following month he competed at the 2007 World Championships in Athletics, and he edged closer to a podium finish – he led the 10,000 m race up to the 8km mark, setting a fast pace, but ultimately ended up in fourth position. Preparing for the road championships that year, he ran the 10-mile Dam tot Damloop race in September and won in 45:51 (the world's fastest that season), finishing some distance ahead of runners up Bernard Kipyego and James Rotich. Zersenay emphasised his position as one of the world's most dominant half marathon runners with a second victory at the 2007 IAAF World Road Running Championships in Udine, Italy. Although he was close to world record pace at the 15km point, he slowed behind the leading pack of Makau Musyoki, Evans Kiprop Cheruiyot and Deriba Merga. In the final kilometre, he burst away to take the lead and the gold medal, setting a national and championship record time of 58:59 in the process. Following these achievements, a <b>medical</b> <b>team</b> did a study of his running economy and found him {{to be one of the}} most efficient runners ever to be tested.|$|E

40|$|Emergency <b>medical</b> <b>teams</b> {{operate under}} unusual circumstances. They {{assemble}} for a singular, temporary purpose, potentially change {{in size and}} composition, and their performance can influence whether a patient lives or dies. Although leadership is a critical component to team success, it is rarely investigated {{in the context of}} emergency <b>medical</b> <b>teams.</b> This study sought {{to examine the relationship between}} directive leadership behaviors and team performance outcomes. It was hypothesized that directive leadership would be particularly effective for emergency <b>medical</b> <b>teams.</b> In addition, a contingency model was proposed. Specifically, it was hypothesized that the effectiveness of directive leadership is contingent upon the complexity of the situation and the experience level of the team such that directive leadership is more effective when teams are inexperienced and the situation is complex. Neonatal resuscitation teams served as the emergency <b>medical</b> <b>teams</b> in this study. The proposed relationships were tested using observations from high-fidelity, neonatal resuscitation team training simulations. Hypotheses were not supported. Limitations and suggestions for future research for the development of leadership training curriculum are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Nowadays, data {{analysis}} {{is getting more}} and more important also in health environments, because <b>medical</b> <b>teams</b> need to obtain statistical information when monitoring patients’ conditions. This is especially true in e-health systems, where patients are de-hospitalized and followed through remote controls. In this context, the implementation of a data warehouse, which automatically collects daily monitoring data stored in medical records and, then, provides historical information about patients, supports <b>medical</b> <b>teams</b> when performing data analyses devoted both to discover hidden data correlations and to optimize health business processes. In this paper, we present the data warehouse developed for UBI-CARE, a project whose aim is to support <b>medical</b> <b>teams</b> in the remote management of patients affected by peritoneal dialysis and chronic heart failure...|$|R
5|$|The {{previous}} season's defeat to West Bromwich Albion led to Revie criticising referee Ray Tinkler. As punishment, Leeds {{were forced}} to play their first four home games of the 1971–72 season at a neutral venue; they played at Huddersfield's Leeds Road and boasted four wins and two draws from the opening seven matches. Leeds played good football, particularly winning praise for their 7–0 and 6–1 wins over Southampton and Nottingham Forest respectively, but again could only finish as runners-up after a late collapse and final day defeat at Wolves, allowing Derby County to claim the title by a single point. Revie had attempted to strengthen his squad before the final run-in with a £177,000 bid for Asa Hartford, but the deal was cancelled by the <b>medical</b> <b>team</b> who spotted a heart defect in the attacker's medical records.
