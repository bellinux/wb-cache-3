25|$|STS-129 {{focused on}} staging spare {{components}} outside the station. The 11-day flight included three spacewalks. The payload bay carried two large ExPRESS Logistics Carriers holding two spare gyroscopes, two nitrogen tank assemblies, two pump modules, an ammonia tank assembly, a spare latching end effector for the station's robotic arm, a spare trailing umbilical {{system for the}} <b>Mobile</b> <b>Transporter,</b> and a high-pressure gas tank. STS-129 was the first flight of an ExPRESS Logistics Carrier.

25|$|Astronauts Wolf and Marshburn began EVA 2 at 15:27 UTC {{out of the}} Quest airlock. The EVA was to {{transfer}} the spare components brought by the shuttle from the ICC-VLD to External Stowage Platform-3. The spares were handled by Wolf riding the station's robotic arm to the P3 truss stowage platform where he and Marshburn attached them for long term storage. The purpose of the spares was to provide redundancy to the station in the period following the shuttle's retirement. The spares unloaded include a Ku-Band Space-to-Ground antenna, a pump module for the coolant system and a drive unit for the station's robotic arm's <b>mobile</b> <b>transporter.</b> A planned installation of a camera on the Japanese Experiment Facility was postponed to a future EVA for want of time. Meanwhile, the malfunctioning toilet was set right with the replacement of internal parts and cleared for normal use after tests.|$|E

40|$|On {{the seventh}} day of STS- 110, Mission Specialists Steven Smith and Rex Walheim are shown {{preparing}} for their second extravehicular activity (EVA) and the third of the mission, {{with the assistance of}} Mission Specialist Jerry Ross. Following this mission, Ross and Smith will be the first and second most experienced spacewalkers, respectively, in history. A camera mounted on the Space Shuttle Atlantis shows footage of the International Space Station. While Smith and Walheim are on EVA, Mission Specialists Ross and Lee Morin will provide choreography from inside the Atlantis crew cabin, Pilot Stephen Frick will operate the robotic arm, and Commander Mike Bloom will control the cameras on the robotic arm. Smith and Walheim are shown exiting the airlock hatch and then installing an PFR (Portable Foot Restraint) {{on the end of the}} robotic arm, from which much of the work will be done. Following the switching off of a circuit breaker, the main EVA task of rewiring umbilical cables that provide power, commands, and video is begun. These cables will be connected to the <b>Mobile</b> <b>Transporter's</b> (MT) robotic arm. The MT, an external transportation system which runs on rails, is seen with a helmet mounted camera as the astronauts work to release bolts that had served to secure the MT during launch. After a final check of the umbilical connections mated, the Umbilical Reconfiguration Panel is fitted over the cables, and the astronauts make their way to the airlock hatch...|$|R

40|$|The {{respiratory}} electron {{transport chain}} (ETC) couples electron transfer from organic substrates onto molecular oxygen with proton translocation across the inner mitochondrial membrane. The resulting proton gradient {{is used by}} the ATP synthase complex for ATP formation. In plants, the ETC is especially intricate. Besides the "classical" oxidoreductase complexes (complex I-IV) and the <b>mobile</b> electron <b>transporters</b> cytochrome c and ubiguinone, it comprises numerous "alternative oxidoreductases. " Furthermore, several dehydrogenases localized in the mitochondrial matrix and the mitochondrial intermembrane space directly or indirectly provide electrons for the ETC. Entry of electrons into the system occurs via numerous pathways which are dynamically regulated in response to the metabolic state of a plant cell as well as environmental factors.

40|$|Assembly and {{maintenance}} of the International Space Station (ISS) relies heavily {{on the use of}} extravehicular robotic systems. When fully assembled the ISS robotics complement will include three main manipulators, two small dexterous arms, and a <b>mobile</b> base and <b>transporter</b> system. The complexity and mobility of the systems and limited opportunities for direct viewing of the Space Station’s exterior makes telerobotic operations an especially challenging task. Although fundamental manipulator design, control systems, and strategies for autonomous versus manual control vary greatly between the systems, commonality in the design of workstation controls and displays is considered essential to enhance operator performance and reduce the possibility of errors. Principal human factors opportunities are associated with workstation layout, human-computer interface considerations, adequacy of alignment cues for maintenance of safe approach corridors during mating tasks, spatial awareness challenges, integration of supplemental computer graphic displays to enhance operator global situational awareness, and training methodologies for preservation of critical skills during long-duration missions...|$|R

Instrumentation included over 100 accelerometers. Data was recorded for steady state speeds, start-ups and stops, and ambient wind excitations with the vehicle at idle. This paper will describe the operating deflection shape analysis performed using the measured acceleration response data. The response data for the steady state speed runs were dominated by harmonics of the forcing frequencies, which were proportional to the vehicle speed. Assuming a broadband excitation for the wind, analyses of the data sets with the vehicle at idle were used to estimate the natural frequencies and corresponding mode shapes. Comparisons of the measured modal properties with numerical predictions are presented...|$|R
40|$|A basic {{procedure}} for robotically constructing a manned Mars base is outlined. The research procedure {{was divided into}} three areas: environment, robotics, and habitat. The base as designed will consist of these components: two power plants, communication facilities, a habitat complex, and a hangar, a garage, recreation and manufacturing facilities. The power plants will be self-contained nuclear fission reactors placed approx. 1 km from the base for safety considerations. The base communication system will {{use a combination of}} orbiting satellites and surface relay stations. This system is necessary for robotic contact with Phobos and any future communication requirements. The habitat complex will consist of six self-contained modules: core, biosphere, science, living quarters, galley/storage, and a sick bay which will be brought from Phobos. The complex will be set into an excavated hole and covered with approximately 0. 5 m of sandbags to provide radiation protection for the astronauts. The recreation, hangar, garage, and manufacturing facilities will each be transformed from the four one-way landers. The complete complex will be built by autonomous, artificially intelligent robots. Robots incorporated into the design are as follows: Large Modular Construction Robots with detachable arms capable of large scale construction activities; Small Maneuverable Robotic Servicers capable of performing delicate tasks normally requiring a suited astronaut; and a trailer vehicle with modular type attachments to complete specific tasks; and finally, <b>Mobile</b> Autonomous Rechargeable <b>Transporters</b> capable of transferring air and water from the manufacturing facility to the habitat complex...|$|R
