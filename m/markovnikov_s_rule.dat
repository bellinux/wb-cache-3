40|$|It {{is widely}} {{accepted}} that modern humans conform to Bergmann 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>rule,</b> {{which holds that}} body size in endothermic species will increase as temperature decreases. However, {{there are reasons to}} question the reliability of the findings on which this consensus is based. One of these is that the main studies that have reported that modern humans conform to Bergmann 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>rule</b> have employed samples that contain a disproportionately large number of warm-climate and northern hemisphere groups. With this in mind, we used latitudinally-stratified and hemisphere-specific samples to re-assess the relationship between modern human body size and temperature.

However, when groups were separated by hemisphere, Bergmann 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>rule</b> was only supported in the northern hemisphere. In the course of exploring these results further, we found that the difference between our northern and southern hemisphere subsamples is due to the limited latitudinal and temperature range in the latter subsample. Thus, our study suggests that modern humans do conform to Bergmann 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>rule</b> but only when there are major differences in latitude and temperature among groups. Specifically, groups must span more than 50 degrees of latitude and/or more than 30 °C for it to hold.

40|$|What is {{the proper}} legal {{standard}} for product integration involving software? Because software is subject to low marginal costs, network effects, and rapid technological innovation, the Supreme Court 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> existing antitrust <b>rules</b> on tying arrangements, which evolved from industries not possessing such characteristics, are inappropriate. In this Article, I ask why firms integrate software products. Next, I review the Supreme Court 2 ̆ 7 s tying decisions in Jefferson Parish and Eastman Kodak. I propose an approach to judging the lawfulness of product integration in technologically dynamic markets that supplements the Supreme Court 2 ̆ 7 s current standard with four additional steps in cases of tying of computer software. Thereafter, I examine the D. C. Circuit 2 ̆ 7 s approach to software integration, which arose from that court 2 ̆ 7 s 1998 interpretation, in Microsoft II, of an antitrust consent decree between the US. Department of Justice and Microsoft Corporation. I argue that the D. C.

I show how my approach imparts greater clarity to the D. C. Circuit 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>rule.</b> I examine the competing product integration rule proposed in 2000 by Professor Lawrence Lessig as amicus curiae in the government 2 ̆ 7 s subsequent antitrust case against Microsoft, concerning the integration of Internet Explorer and Windows 98.

40|$|Rensch 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>rule</b> (RR) {{states that}} sexual size {{dimorphism}} (SSD) increases with body size in male-biased SSD taxa, and decreases with body size in female-biased SSD taxa. This pattern implies that males change body size faster than females through evolutionary time, and that sexual selection {{might be the}} main evolutionary force behind this pattern. Phenotypic plasticity has been proposed as a proximate potential mechanism of RR by affecting body growth in a differential manner in males and females. In this dissertation I studied the role of phenotypic plasticity as a mechanism affecting sexual size and shape dimorphism in two turtle species exhibiting contrasting SSD: Chelydra serpentina that exhibits male-biased SSD, and Podocnemis expansa that exhibits female-biased SSD. I found that males of the male-biased SSD species exhibited increased growth plasticity relative to females, thus supporting the differential plasticity hypothesis as a mechanism that facilitates body size enhancement and thus the evolution of SSD {{in a manner consistent}} with RR. Whether differential plasticity enhances body size of the larger sex in general, or of males in particular, was addressed in the second experiment. In this second experiment I found no differences in growth plasticity between males and females, thus failing to support the differential plasticity hypothesis in the female-biased SSD species. The combined evidence from both studies suggest that differential plasticity is neither specific to males nor to the larger sex, but instead that it is species-specific. Whether turtles follow Rensch 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>rule</b> or not was tested in a third analysis by correlating body size of males and females of 138 turtle species in a phylogenetic context and at multiple taxonomic levels. I found no support for Rensch 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>rule</b> in turtles at the order level and in most families. Instead, results suggest that SSD has evolved independently of the species average body size in those clades. I also found that the family Chelydridae and one subclade within the Testudinidae family follow Rensch 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>rule,</b> while the Podocnemididae family follows a pattern exactly opposite to Rensch 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>rule.</b> These results are in agreement with the result of the common garden experiments. Namely, I found support for sex-specific growth plasticity as a mechanism facilitating RR in C. serpentina, a species belonging to the family Chelydridae that follows RR. Furthermore, no support for sex-specific growth plasticity as a mechanism facilitating RR was detected in P. expansa, a species belonging to the family Podocnemididae that does not follow RR. Further research is warranted to test the role of the sex-specific growth plasticity in female-biased SSD species belonging to clades that follow Rensch 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>rule.</b> Likewise, similar studies should be conducted in male-biased SSD species belonging to clades that do not follow Rensch 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>rule...</b>|$|R

In addition, hypotheses based on sexual selection, which predict that sexual dimorphism should vary with population density and climatic conditions, have received little attention. Our goals were to characterize geographical variation in the coloration and morphology of golden-crowned kinglets, Regulus satrapa (Passeriformes, Regulidae), and to investigate possible ecological and sexual selection correlates of this variation. Location: The entire species range of golden-crowned kinglets, comprising North and Central America. Methods: We collected data from 511 museum specimens, dating from 1847 to 2006, encompassing all five subspecies of golden-crowned kinglets. We used reflectance spectrometry to quantify crown and mantle coloration, and measured wing-chord and tarsus length to approximate body size. We obtained geographical and climatic data from online databases, and population density estimates from the literature. Results: There were significant subspecific and gender differences in crown coloration and morphology: male kinglets were generally larger and more colourful. Our data revealed mixed support for Bergmann 2 ̆ 7 s rule: tarsus length decreased with increasing latitude, while patterns of variation in wing-chord and tarsus length showed conflicting results with temperature. Mantle coloration exhibited an opposite trend to that predicted by Gloger 2 ̆ 7 s rule: upper parts became lighter with increasing relative humidity. Crown coloration was negatively correlated with actual evapotranspiration, suggesting that levels of primary productivity are not directly linked to carotenoid abundance. Sexual dimorphism and dichromatism generally increased with greater population density, lower latitudes and elevations, and warmer temperatures, supporting a previously observed pattern of variation in sexual dimorphism. Main conclusions: Geographical variation in golden-crowned kinglets yielded mixed support for Bergmann 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>rule</b> and contradicted Gloger 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>rule,</b> suggesting that other mechanisms may be operating. Allen 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>rule</b> {{is likely to be a}} stronger factor influencing tarsus length.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{shows that}} Dillon 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Rule,</b> {{which holds that}} local governments have no powers except those conferred on them by state constitution or law, {{is no longer a}} reasonable basis for limiting the economic development powers of local government in the United States. The Rule was a nineteenth formulation. ^ Economic development, it is now understood, requires local governments to act creatively and be responsive to locally specific conditions and opportunities. However, according to Dillon 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Rule,</b> which is the fundamental expression of local government powers in the United States, local governments enjoy neither negative nor positive liberty; they cannot be creative except as authorized by the state. An express purpose of Dillon 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Rule</b> was to prevent local governments from fostering or engaging in economic activity that could be undertaken by the private sector. ^ Dillon 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Rule</b> was promulgated in the nineteenth century and definitively adopted by the U. S. Supreme Court in the early twentieth century. Judge John F. Dillon, architect of the Rule, argued that the Rule was historically correct, prudent, derived from sound theory, and consistent with precedent. This dissertation critically examines these four arguments in light of subsequent scholarship. It also questions whether the Rule remains useful and concludes that it does not. It contextualizes the Rule showing that its promulgation made sense in terms of the early history of Iowa local government, that its adoption was in keeping with laissez-faire capitalism and Progressivism, and that its acceptance was consistent with the cultural logic of the welfare state. ^ The dissertation uses history to provide a liberation from an embedded formulation. The dissertation is the first work to analyze Dillon 2 ̆ 7 s arguments supporting the Rule in the light of subsequent scholarship and participates in “unthinking” the nineteenth century. It contributes to the understanding both of the relationship between planning and power and of the constitutive role that economic development can play in the formation and maintenance of vibrant local communities. ...|$|R
