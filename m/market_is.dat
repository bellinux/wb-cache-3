5|$|The 17th century Yarn <b>Market</b> <b>is</b> {{a market}} cross which was {{probably}} built in 1609 by the Luttrell family who were the local lords of the manor to maintain {{the importance of the}} village as a market, particularly for wool and cloth. The Yarn <b>Market</b> <b>is</b> an octagonal building constructed around a central pier. The tiled roof provides shelter from the rain. The building contains a hole in one of the roof beams, a result of cannon fire in the Civil War. A bell at the top was rung to indicate the start of trading.|$|E

5|$|A second market cross, {{known as}} the Butter Cross, which {{was built in the}} 15th century used to stand near the Yarn Market but was moved to the {{outskirts}} of the village in the 18th or 19th centuries. The Yarn <b>Market</b> <b>is</b> in the guardianship of English Heritage but is managed by the National Trust. In 1951 the Ministry of Works took over various properties including the Yarn Market from the Crown Estate. They carried out restoration works, however this was controversial as the shape of the roof was changed to more closely resemble the appearance of the original building, rather than that produced by subsequent revisions.|$|E
5|$|A {{simplified}} {{version of}} the model was popularized by Paul Krugman in the 1990s in his book Peddling Prosperity. In this set up there are two firms, one foreign and one domestic which are considering entering a new export market in a third country (or possibly the whole world). The demand in the export <b>market</b> <b>is</b> such that if only one firm enters, {{it will make a}} profit, but if they both enter each will make a loss, perhaps because of initial set up, infrastructure, product development, marketing or other fixed costs of entry. The matrix below presents a stylized example of the game that the two firms are engaged in.|$|E
30|$|Pribadi and Kanai (2011) {{argue that}} {{performance}} <b>marketing</b> <b>is</b> an achievement that earned {{the company from}} <b>marketing</b> activities <b>are</b> done.

5|$|Another reason exports {{cannot be}} {{promoted}} is because in all likelihood, an underdeveloped country {{may only be}} skilled enough to promote the export of primary goods, say agricultural goods. However, since such commodities face inelastic demand, {{the extent to which}} they will sell in the <b>market</b> <b>is</b> limited. Although when population is at a rise, additional demand for exports may be created, Nurkse implicitly assumed that developed countries are operating at the replacement rate of population growth. For Nurkse, then, exports as a means of economic development are completely ruled out.|$|E

The products Key sells at Comiket are all related to the visual novels the brand produces.|$|E
