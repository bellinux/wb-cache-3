5000|$|A {{multi-part}} <b>molding</b> <b>box</b> (known as {{a casting}} flask, {{the top and}} bottom halves of which are known respectively as the cope and drag) is prepared to receive the pattern. Molding boxes are made in segments that may be latched {{to each other and to}} end closures. For a simple object - flat on one side - the lower portion of the box, closed at the bottom, will be filled with a molding sand. The sand is packed in through a vibratory process called ramming, and in this case, periodically screeded level. The surface of the sand may then be stabilized with a sizing compound. The pattern is placed on the sand and another <b>molding</b> <b>box</b> segment is added. Additional sand is rammed over and around the pattern. Finally a cover is placed on the box and it is turned and unlatched, so that the halves of the mold may be parted and the pattern with its sprue and vent patterns removed. Additional sizing may be added and any defects introduced by the removal of the pattern are corrected. The box is closed again. This forms a [...] "green" [...] mold which must be dried to receive the hot metal. If the mold is not sufficiently dried a steam explosion can occur that can throw molten metal about. In some cases, the sand may be oiled instead of moistened, which makes casting possible without waiting for the sand to dry. Sand may also be bonded by chemical binders, such as furane resins or amine-hardened resins.|$|E

40|$|Consistent {{mechanical}} and machining properties are essential in many applications where ductile irons {{offer the most}} cost-effective way to produce structural parts. In the production of hydraulic rotators, dimensional tolerances are typically 20 μm to obtain designated performance. For castings where intermediate strength and ductility is required, it is common knowledge that conventional ferritic-pearlitic ductile irons such as ISO 1083 / 500 - 7 show large hardness variations. These are mainly caused by the notoriously varying pearlite content, both at different locations within a part and between parts in the same or different batches. Cooling rate variations due to different wall thickness and position in the <b>molding</b> <b>box,</b> as well as varying amounts of pearlite-stabilizing elements, all contribute to detrimental hardness variations. The obvious remedy is to avoid pearlite formation, and instead obtain the necessary mechanical properties by solution strengthening of the ferritic matrix by increasing silicon content to 3. 7 wt% – 3. 8 wt%. The Swedish development in this fi eld 1998 resulted in a national standardization as SS 140725, followed in 2004 by ISO 1083 /JS/ 500 - 10. Indexator AB decided 2005 to specify JS/ 500 - 10 for all new ductile iron parts and to convert all existing parts. Improvements include reduction by 75 % in hardness variations and increase by 30 % in cutting tool life, combined with consistently better mechanical properties...|$|E

The strengths of <b>molded</b> <b>boxes</b> and flexural specimens cut from the boxes were compared with results of tests on standard test specimens molded from the respective materials. The nonuniformity of a material, which is indicated by the coefficient of variation, affects the results of tests made with specimens of different sizes and tests with different methods of loading. The strength values were found to depend on the relationship between size and shape of the molded specimen and size and shape of the fillers. The most significant variations observed within a diversified group of materials were found to depend on the orientation of fibrous fillers. Of secondary importance was the dependence of the variability of test results on the pieces of filler incorporated into the molding powder {{as well as on the}} size of the piece. Static breaking strength tests on <b>boxes</b> <b>molded</b> from six representative phenolic materials correlated well with falling-ball impact tests on specimens cut from molded flat sheets.

40|$|Objective: To {{develop a}} {{practical}} method of measuring shotcrete early strength ansite {{in the first}} six hours after application using a partial beam test standard, ASTM C 1 16 - 90. Determining the early-strength development of as-sprayed shotcrete can improve mine safety by identifying appropriate reentry times and providing a convenient means of quality control during application. A more thorough understanding of shotcrete early strength will lead to improvements in ground support practices, thereby preventing ground falls and reducing mine roof-fall accidents. Background: When shotcrete is used as part of a multi component ground support system, {{it is important to know}} when the material has developed enough strength to be self-supporting and allow for reentry and emplacement of the remaining support elements that require drilling of the shotcrete layer without degradation. Typical reported values for this threshold strength for North American mines range from 1 to 1. 6 MPa (145 to 233 psi) [O'Toole and Pope 2006], with a compressive strength equivalent to 1 MPa (145 psi) being the norm [Rispin et al. 2003; O'Toole and Pope 2006]. Typical ground control support includes a shotcrete flash coat 19 - to 25 -mm (3 / 4 - to 1 -in) thick, followed by screen, plates, bolts, and a second layer of shotcrete bringing the combined thickness to 75 to 100 mm (3 to 4 in). In areas requiring rehabilitation, the second layer of shotcrete is plated and bolted as well. While testing cored samples after 24 hours is standard, this is not practical for the one- to six-hour period following application when shotcrete unconfined compressive strengths are less than 10 MPa (1, 450 psi). Indirect methods are typically used to determine shotcrete strength during the early stages of curing because the partially cured or green material is difficult to sample and test. While problems with inconsistent test results have been reported with the penetrometer-type devices, beam molds have been used successfully for creating shotcrete test specimens in the United States and Canada. Operating the Partial Beam Test System: The test unit is a self-contained, servo-controlled, stiff-frame press. Partial beam test samples are obtained by spraying shotcrete into 102 - x 102 - x 152 -mm (4 - x 4 - x 6 -in) <b>mold</b> <b>boxes.</b> After the samples have been sprayed, tests are conducted at one-hour intervals over the next six hours (one- through six-hour tests). The shotcrete samples are carefully demolded by disassembling the mold fixtures and removing the enclosed sample. Next, a shotcrete sample is placed in a specialized testing fixture and centered under the loading head of the test machine. When the test sequence is initiated, a programmable-logic-controller- (PLC) driven press applies a fixed-rate load to the sample. The load profile is shown on a graphical output display, and the measured test parameters (time, displacement, and load) are stored on a thumb drive. Once the operator observes a well-defined peak in the load profile curve, the test is completed and the test machine's loading platen can be returned to its initial starting position. Peak load is typically reflected by the development of large vertically oriented cracks along the platen-to sample contact edges, which are indicative of the failure plane. There is a marked difference in early-strength gain between sprayed and cast shotcrete. The cast shotcrete samples have a similar strength gain profile to that of cast concrete samples.

Por apresentar alta resistência sob altas temperaturas, ligas à base de níquel são amplamente empregadas em componentes aeroespaciais e na indústria siderúrgica, mais especificamente em moldes que consistem em placas de cobre com níquel puro eletro depositado, montados sobre caixas de aço, no início do processo de lingotamento contínuo. O objetivo deste trabalho é avaliar a influência do ângulo de posição das ferramentas sobre as forças de usinagem, o acabamento da peça usinada, o processo de desgaste da ferramenta de corte e a taxa de remoção de material durante o fresamento frontal de níquel puro. Três geometrias de fresas foram utilizadas, variando o ângulo de posição r = 12 °, 45 ° e 90 °, tendo como princípio manter a espessura de corte constante igual a 0, 25 mm. Os testes compararam: as fresas com r = 90 ° e 45 ° utilizando ap = 1, 0 mm, a fresa com r = 45 ° com diferentes velocidades de corte e as fresas com r = 45 ° e 12 ° com ap = 0, 5 mm. Os resultados indicaram que a ferramenta com r = 12 ° apresentou maior taxa de remoção de material, e maiores forças de usinagem, ao passo que a ferramenta com r = 45 ° apresentou maior tempo de vida e valores de rugosidade Rz menores. Além da influência do ângulo de posição, o efeito do revestimento da ferramenta e da velocidade de corte foi investigado, mostrando maior tempo de vida para o inserto revestido com TiN-Al 2 O 3 -TiCN (CVD) em relação ao revestimento TiAlN (PVD) para fresa com r = 12 °, e maior taxa de crescimento do desgaste de cratera para maior velocidade de corte vc quando utilizada fresa com r = 45 °. Nickel {{is considered}} as a dificult-to-cut material, due to rapidly work hardening when machined. Because it shows high strength at high temperatures it is widely used as high temperature alloys in aerospacial components and more specifically is applied in the continuous casting industry, in molds which consist of a copper sheet with pure nickel electroplated, mounted over steel boxes, {{at the beginning of}} continuous cast process. The molten steel is poured into the tundish, then is driven to <b>molds</b> <b>box,</b> which must support the wear caused by steel sliding at high temperature. The principal aim of this work is to investigate the influence of the side cutting edge angle r on the cutting forces, wear mechanisms, surface finish and metal removal rate during face milling of pure nickel. Three types of milling cutters were used, with r = 12 °, 45 ° e 90, and keeping the cut thickness constant equal to 0, 25 mm.

The results indicated the milling cutter with r = 12 ° was superior with regard to metal removal rate and higher cutting forces, while the milling cutter with r = 45 ° was superior regard to tool life and smaller values to surface finish Rz. Beside the influence of the side cutting edge angle r, the effect of tools coating and the cutting speed were investigated, showing longer tool life to insert coated with TiN-Al 2 O 3 -TiCN (CVD) compared to TiAlN (PVD) coating when used milling cutter with r = 12 °, and bigger growing rate of crater wear at bigger surface speed when used milling cutter with r = 45 °...|$|R

The objectives of the testing were to obtain information concerning the southern limits of the casting shed and to explore additional areas of the casting shed floor.
