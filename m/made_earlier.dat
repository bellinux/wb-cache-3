5|$|The prisoners {{believe they}} have won the study, but the guards have tricked them into winning, {{allowing}} them to escape. Keith tells the police the story of Kendall and Cormac's deaths: Kendall gave Keith a valuable painting disguised as money in a case, and Cormac tried to kill Kendall and Keith to get the case's contents. Cormac killed Liam out of anger {{that there was no}} money. The episode concludes with Logan streaking through sociology class, fulfilling a bet <b>made</b> <b>earlier</b> in the episode.|$|E
5|$|HB1001 {{made its}} first flight on 1December1977 {{at the hands of}} Lockheed test pilot, Bill Park. He would fly the next four sorties, all chased by a T-38 piloted by Major (later Lieutenant Colonel) Ken Dyson. Dyson, an F-15 Eagle pilot, was {{previously}} approached by United States Air Force personnel about the project in 1976. He made his first flight on HB1001 on 17January1978, chased by Park. In fact, the two would be the only test pilots of Have Blue, alternating between the demonstrator and the chase plane. Flight test results allowed engineers to refine the FBW system. At the same time, they verified predictions <b>made</b> <b>earlier</b> by aerodynamic engineers on the aircraft's behavior.|$|E
5|$|In 893 Asser wrote a {{biography}} of Alfred, called the Life of King Alfred. The manuscript survived to modern times in only one copy, {{which was part of}} the Cotton library. That copy was destroyed in a fire in 1731, but transcriptions that had been <b>made</b> <b>earlier,</b> together with material from Asser's work which was included by other early writers, have enabled the work to be reconstructed. The biography is the main source of information about Alfred's life and provides far more information about Alfred than is known about any other early English ruler. Asser assisted Alfred in his translation of Gregory the Great's Pastoral Care, and possibly with other works.|$|E

5|$|The {{same day}} as the MPC publication, Brown's group {{announced}} the discovery of another Kuiper belt object, , more distant and brighter (and apparently larger) than Pluto, as the tenth planet. The announcement was <b>made</b> <b>earlier</b> than planned to forestall the possibility of similar events with that discovery, when the MPC told them that their observational data was publicly accessible, and they realized that not only Haumea data {{but by that time}} their Eris data had been publicly accessed. The same day Ortiz announced the discovery of Haumea, Brown submitted his own draft with the data on the first of its moons that he had discovered on January 26, 2005, to The Astrophysical Journal.|$|E
5|$|Coloured {{seats and}} a police room {{were added to the}} Kemlyn Road stand in 1987. After the Hillsborough {{disaster}} in 1989 when Police mismanagement led to overcrowding and the deaths of 96 Liverpool fans, the Taylor Report recommended that all grounds in the country should be converted into all-seater grounds by May 1994. A second tier was added to the Kemlyn Road stand in 1992, turning it into a double-decker layout. It included executive boxes and function suites as well as 11,000seating spaces. Plans to expand the stand had been <b>made</b> <b>earlier,</b> with the club buying up houses on Kemlyn Road during the 1970s, and 1980s, but had to be put on hold until 1990 because two sisters, Joan and Nora Mason, refused to sell their house. When the club reached an agreement with the sisters in 1990, the expansion plans were put into action. The stand—renamed the Centenary Stand—was officially opened on 1 September 1992 by UEFA president Lennart Johansson. The Kop was rebuilt in 1994 after the recommendations of the Taylor Report and became all seated; it is still a single tier, and the capacity was significantly reduced to 12,390.|$|E
5|$|During their suspension, Mulder and Scully {{venture to}} Hollywood {{to view the}} {{production}} of Federman's film. It is revealed that Federman's movie will be called The Lazarus Bowl, and Garry Shandling will play Mulder and Téa Leoni will play Scully. After filming is done, Mulder and Scully attend a screening of the film with Skinner, but are thoroughly disgusted at how their case, and they, are portrayed on the big screen. Mulder and Scully leave the set holding hands, presumably {{on their way to}} dinner with the FBI credit card Skinner gave them after watching the movie, hinting at the continued romantic relationship between Mulder and Scully that has been suggested in the last few episodes. As the agents leave, the dead who were resting underneath the film set are revived and begin to dance passionately, reinforcing a theory Mulder <b>made</b> <b>earlier</b> in the episode.|$|E

5|$|In February 1223, Maulay {{forfeited}} Upavon to the king. This {{was part}} of a string of confiscations that struck at supporters of des Roches, including William de Cantilupe, Breauté, and Robert de Vieuxpont, by taking back grants that had been <b>made</b> <b>earlier</b> and which were held at the king's will. The seizures were made to teach the nobles a lesson and curb their dissension from the royal government, which was in the hands of Roches' rival de Burgh. Most of the manors, including Upavon, were returned to their previous holders in April after a settlement between de Burgh and those who resented his government. Around this time Maulay began work on Mulgrave Castle, in Yorkshire, which {{was part of}} his wife's inheritance. In June and July 1224, Maulay was present at on the royal side at the siege of Bedford Castle, which was held by de Breauté against the government. In 1225 Maulay claimed that he had sworn to King John that he would not give up custody of the royal castles until after John's son came of age. Maulay lost Upavon to the king again in 1229, with the king regranting Upavon to Gilbert Basset. This grant to Basset was by charter, with the lands to be held in fee. Maulay claimed that he only gave up his tenure because of threats by de Burgh.|$|E
5|$|Julius Seelye Bixler {{reviewed}} the book twice, in 1952 and 1953. In his first review {{he wrote that}} he believed Stace was trying to have his {{cake and eat it}} with regards to the truth of both naturalism and mysticism. Bixler also wonders whether the revelation of God can really be free of concepts and thus whether time and eternity are utterly unrelated as Stace maintains. He identifies points in Stace’s thought where there is continuity between these two states and mystical language does appear to refer to concepts. Finally he rejects the book’s analogy of mystical experience to the evocative power of art, maintaining that art must be somewhat related to logic. Nonetheless, Bixler does concur that the book is a fascinating confessio fidei and personal statement. A year later, he reviewed Time and Eternity alongside Religion and the Modern Mind. As well as reiterating the points he had <b>made</b> <b>earlier,</b> Bixler judges the second book more favourably and recommends reading the two together to better understand the problems they address.|$|E
5|$|Presumably a {{few days}} later, Katy has since made friends with a monkey and uses her {{stiletto}} heel to form a spear. She uses it to shoot a banana, which she gives to the monkey. In another scene, she bathes in the lake, {{with the help of}} an elephant who sprays her with water from the lake using its trunk. Katy helps a crocodile by brushing its teeth using a toothbrush she has salvaged, and tries to reach her clothes which have been taken by the elephant. At night, she holds a torch and explores a cave. Inside, she watches an animated drawing on the wall in which humans try to kill a tiger with fire; attempting to burn it as it grows stronger and shooting spears which it sends firing back towards them with its roar. The next morning, Katy emerges from the cave, wearing a leopard-print bikini top, a grass skirt, laced up legs and bare feet, displaying a boost of confidence and holding the spear she <b>made</b> <b>earlier.</b> She stands on top of a waterfall, overlooking the jungle, and then swings across the sky on a vine.|$|E
