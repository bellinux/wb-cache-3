5|$|In {{addition}} to its scientific results, Hubble has also {{made significant contributions to}} aerospace engineering, in particular the performance of systems in low Earth orbit. These insights result from Hubble's long lifetime on orbit, extensive instrumentation, and return of assemblies to the Earth where they can be studied in detail. In particular, Hubble has contributed to studies of the behavior of graphite composite structures in vacuum, optical contamination from residual gas and human servicing, radiation damage to electronics and sensors, and the long term behavior of <b>multi-layer</b> insulation. One lesson learned was that gyros assembled using pressurized oxygen to deliver suspension fluid were prone to failure due to electric wire corrosion. Gyros are now assembled using pressurized nitrogen.|$|E
5|$|In fish {{such as the}} herring which live in {{shallower}} water, {{the mirrors}} must reflect a mixture of wavelengths, and the fish accordingly has crystal stacks {{with a range of}} different spacings. A further complication for fish with bodies that are rounded in cross-section is that the mirrors would be ineffective if laid flat on the skin, as they would fail to reflect horizontally. The overall mirror effect is achieved with many small reflectors, all oriented vertically. Silvering is found in other marine animals as well as fish.

5|$|The {{spacecraft}} {{in which}} the telescope and instruments were to be housed was another major engineering challenge. It would have to withstand frequent passages from direct sunlight {{into the darkness of}} Earth's shadow, which would cause major changes in temperature, while being stable enough to allow extremely accurate pointing of the telescope. A shroud of <b>multi-layer</b> insulation keeps the temperature within the telescope stable and surrounds a light aluminum shell {{in which the}} telescope and instruments sit. Within the shell, a graphite-epoxy frame keeps the working parts of the telescope firmly aligned. Because graphite composites are hygroscopic, there was a risk that water vapor absorbed by the truss while in Lockheed's clean room would later be expressed in the vacuum of space; resulting in the telescope's instruments being covered by ice. To reduce that risk, a nitrogen gas purge was performed before launching the telescope into space.|$|E

The sound absorption coefficient of <b>multi-layered</b> PFMs is calculated using impedance translation theorem.

40|$|We {{carry out}} a {{computational}} study on the geometric and electronic properties of <b>multi-layers</b> of silicene in different stacking configurations using a state-of-art abinitio density functional theory based calculations. In this work we investigate the evolution of these properties with increasing number of layers (n) ranging from 1 to 10. Though, mono-layer of silicene possesses properties {{similar to those of}} graphene, our results show that the geometric and electronic properties of <b>multi-layers</b> of silicene are strikingly different from those of <b>multi-layers</b> of graphene. We observe that there exist strong inter-layer covalent bondings between the layers in <b>multi-layers</b> of silicene as opposed to weak van der Waal's bonding which exists between the graphene layers. The inter-layer bonding strongly influences the geometric and electronic structures of these <b>multi-layers.</b> Like bi-layers of graphene, silicene with two different stacking configurations AA and AB exhibits linear and parabolic dispersions around the Fermi level, respectively. However, unlike graphene, for bi-layers of silicene, these dispersion curves are shifted in band diagram; {{this is due to the}} strong inter-layer bonding present in the latter. For n > 3, we study the geometric and electronic properties of <b>multi-layers</b> with four different stacking configurations namely, AAAA, AABB, ABAB and ABC. Our results on cohesive energy show that all the <b>multi-layers</b> considered are energetically stable. Furthermore, we find that the three stacking configurations (AAAA, AABB and ABC) containing tetrahedral coordination have much higher cohesive energy than that of Bernal (ABAB) stacking configuration.
