5|$|Although fantasy {{comes from}} an imaginative realm, Martin sees an honest {{necessity}} to reflect the real world where people die sometimes ugly deaths, even beloved people. Main characters are killed off so that the reader will not expect the supposed hero to survive, and instead will feel the same tension and fear that the characters <b>might.</b> <b>The</b> novels also reflect the substantial death rates in war. The deaths of supernumerary extras or orcs have no major effect on readers, whereas a friend's death has much more emotional impact. Martin prefers a hero's sacrifice to say something profound about human nature.|$|E
5|$|Built between 1079 and 1532, Winchester Cathedral has had {{an unusual}} {{architectural}} history. The exterior, apart from the modified windows, gives {{the impression of a}} massive Norman building and indeed, it is the longest medieval church in the world. However, the west front is now Perpendicular, with its huge window filled with fragments of medieval glass. Inside, only the crypt and the transepts have retained their Norman appearance. The spectacular Perpendicular nave with its tall arcade arches and strong vertical emphasis has been literally carved out of the original Norman interior. The Very Rev. Sykes wrote of it “Well <b>might</b> <b>the</b> visitor who enters … by the west door gasp with amazement.” Winchester is also famous for its carved wooden fittings of many different periods.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{endorsement}} of Admiral Sims, the Navy Department initially rejected the British request. Like other navies of the late-19th and early-20th centuries, the U.S. Navy rigidly adhered to the doctrine of Alfred Thayer Mahan, whose first tenet was that under no circumstances should a battle fleet be divided. U.S. Chief of Naval Operations Admiral William S. Benson and Admiral Henry T. Mayo—Commander of the U.S. Atlantic Fleet—were particularly worried that if Britain fell, as developments at sea suggested it <b>might,</b> <b>the</b> U.S. Navy would be left to face the German High Seas Fleet completely on its own.|$|E

Lord Hillsborough, {{secretary of state for}} the colonies, sent four regiments of the British Army to Boston to support embattled royal officials, and instructed Governor Bernard to order the Massachusetts legislature to revoke the Circular Letter. Hancock and the Massachusetts House voted against rescinding the letter, and instead drew up a petition demanding Governor Bernard's recall. When Bernard returned to England in 1769, Bostonians celebrated.|$|E

A total of ten fixtures were eventually arranged for the inaugural season: two against Wotton-under-Edge, two against Warmley, four against Bristol Wagon Works and Two against Right & <b>Might.</b> <b>The</b> club's first fixture was played on 1 December 1883 when the Black Arabs took to the field in a friendly match against Wotton-under-Edge, a team based in Gloucestershire. The game ended in a 6–0 defeat for the Bristolians, and although no team line-ups or detailed match reports have survived, a brief paragraph describing the game appeared in the Dursley Gazette two days later.|$|E

They never solved the sheer logistical issues of transporting and feeding large numbers of troops for sustained periods of time. Bayinnaung's persistence in sending troops year after year cost an untold number of lives, which at one point caused his senior advisers to murmur loudly. The conqueror king was fortunate that a charismatic guerrilla leader like King Setthathirath of Lan Xang (r. 1548–72) was assassinated by a local rival. After Bayinnaung, Lower Burma lost the manpower advantage over a far more populous Siam. Ayutthaya's larger, well-equipped armies not only repulsed Nanda's undermanned invasions but also ended up seizing the Tenasserim coast in the process.|$|E

500|$|Yorck was {{launched}} on 14 May 1904, and commissioned into the German navy on 21 November 1905.

[...] After her commissioning, Yorck served with the fleet in the cruiser squadron. In 19081909, Erich Raeder served aboard the ship as Yorcks navigation officer. From 1 October 1911 to 26 January 1912, Franz von Hipper, later commander-in-chief of the German navy, served as the ship's commanding officer.|$|E
500|$|Nicholas Seddon, {{a lawyer}} and {{academic}} specialising in commercial and government law, claimed the High Court's judgment leaves [...] "many uncertainties", particularly regarding whether derivative governmental immunity will extend to private sector providers carrying out governmental functions that have been contracted to them (as opposed to merely providing goods or services to the government).

Seddon also criticised the outcome of the case itself, arguing it is [...] "difficult to see how derivative immunity does not inevitably flow" [...] from the governmental immunity from the TPA. He suggested that the application of the TPA to a party that deals with a government compromises the intention of Parliament that State and Territory governments should be immune from the TPA.|$|E

500|$|In 1940, [...] Edmund Godfrey Burr, a Canadian {{professor}} at McGill University, serendipitously stumbled {{on the principle}} of counter-illumination, or as he called it [...] "diffused-lighting camouflage". Burr had been tasked by Canada's National Research Council (NRC) to evaluate night observation instruments. With these, he found that aircraft flying without navigation lights remained readily visible as silhouettes against the night sky, which was never completely black. Burr wondered if he could camouflage planes by somehow reducing this difference in brightness. One night in December 1940, Burr saw a plane coming in to land over snow suddenly vanish: light reflected from the snow had illuminated the underside of the plane just enough to cancel out the difference in brightness, camouflaging the plane perfectly. Burr informed the NRC, who told the RCN. They realized that the technique could help to hide ships from German submarines in the Battle of the Atlantic. Before the introduction of centimetre radar, submarines with their small profile could see convoy ships before they were themselves seen. Diffused lighting camouflage <b>might,</b> <b>the</b> RCN believed, redress the balance.|$|E
500|$|By 13:00 on 26 December, the {{flagship}} Superb was just [...] behind the rearmost French ship, with Spencer [...] further back and Agamemnon another [...] distant. The {{rest of the}} squadron was more than [...] behind the leaders, almost completely out of sight, with the rearmost ship, , more than [...] behind Superb. The more compact French squadron was therefore at an advantage. The British were too dispersed {{to be able to}} bring a powerful enough force to engage the French in equal battle and the distance between the individual British ships was too great to allow them to provide mutual support if Willaumez turned to face them. Therefore, to the fury of his officers, Duckworth called off the pursuit. This decision was heavily criticised, both at the time and subsequently: historian William James commenting that [...] "had the Superb brought to action, as {{in the course of a}} few hours she <b>might,</b> <b>the</b> sternmost French ship [...] [...] [...] the issue, in all reasonable calculation, would have been favourable to the British".|$|E
500|$|The {{history of}} the world of Krynn, and thus the {{settings}} for both the novels and gaming supplements, is roughly split into five separate ages. The first age is the time of creation, when the gods are born and Krynn is formed. The Age of Dreams, the second age, is marked by the rapid growth of the world's first great civilizations and the appearance of myriad new races. This era is also marked by three great wars between dragons and their minions. Following the Third Dragon War, in the Age of <b>Might,</b> <b>the</b> Cataclysm obliterates the great empire of Istar and changes almost the entire surface of Krynn. A three-hundred year depression follows this event, in what is called the Age of Despair. This period also marks the War of the Lance. When Dragonlance was first introduced to Dungeons & Dragons, events such as the Lost Wars happened during The Age of Despair. Later Age of Mortals novels and game supplements took Krynn into [...] the Fifth Age (the Age of Mortals).|$|E

500|$|On 22 June 1907, the Kaiser {{authorized}} {{construction of}} Cruiser F, {{to be named}} Von der Tann, after Ludwig Freiherr von und zu der Tann-Rathsamhausen, a Bavarian general who fought in the Franco-Prussian War of 1870. The contract was awarded to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg, on 26 September 1907. The keel was laid on 21 March 1908, and the ship was launched nearly a year later, on 20 March 1909. The source of the ship's name {{was the subject of}} much gratitude from the Bavarian aristocracy. Newspapers at the time reported that Luitpold, the prince regent and de facto ruler of Bavaria, telegraphed a message of thanks to the German emperor, and the launch ceremony was overseen by one of Von der Tann's descendants, also a general. He spoke to the assembled crowd, stating his hope that Von der Tann would, in his words, [...] "go out to protect Germany's might world-trade, or, at the command of his Majesty the Emperor, to ward off an enemy who attacked the vital interests or the honour of the Empire. <b>Might</b> <b>the</b> ship acquit herself upon the ocean as the General whose name she bore had acquitted himself upon the blood-drenched battlefield and bring her flag victorious out of the fight for the greatness and the honour of Germany."

Lee Butler of Young Adult Library Services Association commented how he was unusually hesitant to stock the Twilight books in his library because he felt the books were [...] "robbing [...] of agency and normalizing stalking and abusive behavior." [...] Many female-oriented and feminist media outlets, like Jezebel, The Frisky, and Salon.com have decried Twilight as promoting an anti-woman message. Bitch magazine stated the novels [...] "had created a new, popular genre of [...] "abstinence porn", concluding that, [...] "In reality, the abstinence message—wrapped in the genre of abstinence porn—objectifies Bella in the same ways that 'real' porn <b>might.</b> <b>The</b> Twilight books conflate Bella losing her virginity {{with the loss of}} other things, including her sense of self and her very life.
