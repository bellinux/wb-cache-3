25|$|Decades ago, Howard Stark {{worked with}} Anton Vanko {{to build the}} first arc reactor, but when Howard {{realized}} Vanko's greedy goals, he had him arrested and deported before, {{at the urging of}} Obadiah Stane, returning to the business of arms dealing that <b>made</b> <b>him</b> <b>so</b> successful in the past. In the present, Stark's son Tony uses the arc reactor technology to power his Iron Man armor, and after revealing this identity to the world, becomes a public hero. U.S. General Thaddeus Ross commissions Stark's business rival Justin Hammer to build a single-pilot vehicle to replace Iron Man, who has been interfering with and causing trouble for the military. When testing the new vehicle, the pilot crash lands in unfriendly territory, under attack from the Congolese army. Tony saves the airman, but, to the chagrin of Ross, refuses to return the Congolese soldiers' fire. Director Nick Fury and Agent Phil Coulson of S.H.I.E.L.D. later review Stark's actions.|$|E

The king preferred the Cumans' way of life, including their costumes and hairstyle, and took Cuman girls as his mistresses.

500|$|In 2011, a {{video of}} Coleman was posted to YouTube. Subsequently, Coleman gained a cult-following for the {{recording}} of him performing a move at the 2011 World Junior Championships that he calls [...] "The Flying Squirrel", which involves somersaulting over his opponent just before his takedown. He has performed the move at the 2009 Sunkist Open against Joe Betterman. [...] He also performed the move against Iran's Mehdi Zidvand at the 2011 World Junior Championships. Coleman claims he has used the [...] "Flying Squirrel" [...] move over a dozen times in competition. The move was ranked third on the ESPN 2011 Best of the Best Highlights. He appeared on ESPN's morning shows, such as ESPN First Take. The move <b>made</b> <b>him</b> <b>so</b> famous that he received lucrative offers to begin a professional wrestling career, but he declined in favor of continuing his Olympic dream. Coleman credits his brother for the move.|$|E

Watsuki drew references from several sources in Buso Renkin; from his past works Rurouni Kenshin and Gun Blaze West to American comics, and from films to other anime and manga. Despite dealing with alchemy, Watsuki initially avoided mentioning the philosopher's stone because he thought he could be accused of plagiarizing another series. He could not omit mentioning it, but he said that it is [...] "general knowledge". During the series' publication, Watsuki had four severe colds; the fourth cold <b>made</b> <b>him</b> <b>so</b> weak that he could not finish the chapter he was due to send to Weekly Shōnen Jump.|$|E
500|$|Meanwhile, Jack's fiftieth {{birthday}} is approaching {{and he has}} received home movies {{of some of his}} earlier birthdays from his mother, Collen Donaghy (Elaine Stritch). While watching the tapes, Jack discovers just how happy he was when he was younger, and is determined to reclaim that happiness and innocence. After examining a list he made while he was younger, he discovers that he has done all of the things but one, befriending Batman. Thus, he arranges for actor Adam West, who played Batman, to come to his birthday party. At the party, however, West calls Jack by the wrong name, leading him to realize that he is in fact unhappy, despite his accomplishments. [...] In an effort to reclaim his happiness, Jack attempts to find the same toy that <b>made</b> <b>him</b> <b>so</b> happy on his tenth birthday, a model of an Apollo Lunar Module. He buys one from a vintage toy store, but still remains unhappy.|$|E
500|$|The 2002 World Junior Championships {{were held}} before a home crowd in Kingston, Jamaica, and gave Bolt {{a chance to}} prove his {{credentials}} on the world stage. By the age of 15, he had grown to [...] tall, and he physically stood out among his peers. He won the 200 m, in a time of 20.61 s, 0.03 s slower than his personal best of 20.58 s, set in the 1st round. Bolt's 200 m win made him the youngest world-junior gold medallist ever. The expectation from the home crowd had <b>made</b> <b>him</b> <b>so</b> nervous that he had put his shoes on the wrong feet. However, {{it turned out to be}} a revelatory experience for Bolt, as he vowed never again to let himself be affected by pre-race nerves. As a member of the Jamaican sprint relay team, he also took two silver medals and set national junior records in the 4×100 metres and 4×400 metres relay, running times of 39.15 s and 3:04.06 minutes respectively.|$|E

500|$|A large well-built athlete (over [...] {{tall and}} strong and broad in proportion), Henry excelled at jousting and hunting. More than pastimes, they were {{political}} devices that served multiple goals, from enhancing his athletic royal image to impressing foreign emissaries and rulers, to conveying Henry's ability to suppress any rebellion. Thus he arranged a jousting tournament at Greenwich in 1517, where he wore gilded armour, gilded horse trappings, and outfits of velvet, satin and cloth of gold dripping with pearls and jewels. It suitably impressed foreign ambassadors, one of whom wrote home that, [...] "The wealth and civilisation {{of the world are}} here, and those who call the English barbarians appear to me to render themselves such". Henry finally retired from jousting in 1536 after a heavy fall from his horse left him unconscious for two hours, but he continued to sponsor two lavish tournaments a year. He then started adding weight and lost the trim, athletic figure that had <b>made</b> <b>him</b> <b>so</b> handsome; Henry's courtiers began dressing in heavily padded clothes to emulate – and flatter – their increasingly stout monarch. Towards the end of his reign his health rapidly declined.|$|E
500|$|Feminist {{literary}} {{critics argue that}} {{the blame for the}} family feud lies in Verona's patriarchal society. For Coppélia Kahn, for example, the strict, masculine code of violence imposed on Romeo is the main force driving the tragedy to its end. When Tybalt kills Mercutio, Romeo shifts into this violent mode, regretting that Juliet has <b>made</b> <b>him</b> <b>so</b> [...] "effeminate". In this view, the younger males [...] "become men" [...] by engaging in violence on behalf of their fathers, {{or in the case of}} the servants, their masters. The feud is also linked to male virility, as the numerous jokes about maidenheads aptly demonstrate. Juliet also submits to a female code of docility by allowing others, such as the Friar, to solve her problems for her. Other critics, such as Dympna Callaghan, look at the play's feminism from a historicist angle, stressing that when the play was written the feudal order was being challenged by increasingly centralised government and the advent of capitalism. At the same time, emerging Puritan ideas about marriage were less concerned with the [...] "evils of female sexuality" [...] than those of earlier eras and more sympathetic towards love-matches: when Juliet dodges her father's attempt to force her to marry a man she has no feeling for, she is challenging the patriarchal order in a way that would not have been possible at an earlier time.|$|E
500|$|Other storylines {{received}} a more mixed response. Canning disliked the focus placed on Sam and his thin, [...] "loveable dope" [...] characterization. He {{found that the}} love-triangle plot made little sense, and as such was hard to invest in. In contrast, Poniewozik called Sam's Bieber subplot the episode's strongest element, and deemed it fun if inessential. He praised Glee for capturing the [...] "disposable fun" [...] of Bieber's music, [...] "without either sneering at it or making it more than it is", and called it better in this respect than [...] "The Power of Madonna". Lauren received several positive reviews. While VanDerWerff found her relationship with Puck [...] "a lot less assured" [...] than in [...] "Silly Love Songs", Mullins and Gonzalez praised their [...] "endearing" [...] dynamic. Reiter felt that in [...] "Comeback", while new characters like Sam and Lauren [...] "managed to shine", established favorites fared less well: [...] "Finn continues to be dismayingly drained of all that once <b>made</b> <b>him</b> <b>so</b> adorable, and Rachel, too, has been deprived of the depth and sex appeal she so carefully developed over time." [...] Several critics raised similar criticism of Rachel—Gonzalez found her need for Brittany's help [...] "too much of a regression", and disliked her return to [...] "old, desperate habits" [...] after several episodes of personal growth. Canning felt that the storyline was forced, and Poniewozik observed that the episode [...] "seemed to be trying less to advance her character [...] simply to give her something to do." [...] VanDerWerff wrote that Rachel appeared to have five different subplots, none of which came together cohesively, and that it reflected the awkward construction of the episode.|$|E
