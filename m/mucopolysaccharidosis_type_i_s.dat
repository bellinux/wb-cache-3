40|$|BACKGROUND: <b>Mucopolysaccharidosis</b> <b>type</b> <b>I</b> is an {{autosomal}} recessive disorder caused by deficiency of α-L-iduronidase and {{characterized by a}} progressive course with multisystem involvement. Clinically, <b>Mucopolysaccharidosis</b> <b>type</b> <b>I</b> is classified into two forms: severe (Hurler syndrome), which presents in infancy and is characterized by rapid progressive neurological involvement and attenuated (Hurler/Scheie and Scheie syndromes), which presents with slower progression and absent to mild nervous system involvement. The specific treatment for attenuated <b>Mucopolysaccharidosis</b> <b>type</b> <b>I</b> consists of enzyme-replacement therapy with laronidase (human recombinant α-L-iduronidase, Aldurazyme). We present here the clinical and laboratory results in an 12 -year-old patient affected by the attenuated form of <b>Mucopolysaccharidosis</b> <b>type</b> <b>I</b> treated by enzyme-replacement therapy {{from the age of}} 5 months, compared with his 17 year old affected sister, who started therapy at 5 years of age. CASE PRESENTATION: Clinical evaluation of these siblings shows that initiation of therapy prior of the onset of clinically detectable disease resulted in considerable improvement in outcome in the young sibling. After 12 years of enzyme-replacement therapy, facial appearance, linear growth rate, and liver and spleen volumes were normal; moreover, the degree of joint disease, vertebral, and cardiac valvular involvement were only minimal compared with those of his sister. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that early diagnosis and early initiation of enzyme-replacement therapy substantially modify the natural history of the attenuated form of <b>Mucopolysaccharidosis</b> <b>type</b> <b>I...</b>|$|R
40|$|<b>Mucopolysaccharidosis</b> <b>Type</b> <b>I</b> is a {{lysosomal}} storage disorder {{with varying}} degrees of phenotypic severity caused by mutations in IDUA. Over 200 disease-causing variants in IDUA have been reported. We describe the profile of disease-causing variants in 291 individuals with <b>Mucopolysaccharidosis</b> <b>Type</b> <b>I</b> for whom IDUA sequencing was performed, focussing on the UK subset of the cohort. A total of 63 variants were identified, of which 20 were novel, and the functional significance of the novel variants is explored. The severe form of <b>Mucopolysaccharidosis</b> <b>Type</b> <b>I</b> is treated with haematopoietic stem cell transplantation, known to have improved outcomes with earlier age at treatment. Developing genotype-phenotype relationships would therefore have considerable clinical utility, especially {{in the light of the}} development of newborn screening programs for <b>Mucopolysaccharidosis</b> <b>Type</b> <b>I.</b> Associations between genotype and phenotype are examined in this cohort, particularly in the context of the profile of variants identified in UK individuals. Relevant associations can be made for the majority of UK individuals based on the presence of nonsense or truncating variants as well as other associations described in this report.

Few {{studies have examined the}} effects of α-L-iduronidase deficiency and subsequent glycosaminoglycan storage upon arterial gene expression to understand the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease. Gene expression in carotid artery, ascending, and descending aortas from four non-tolerized, non-enzyme treated 19 month-old <b>mucopolysaccharidosis</b> <b>type</b> <b>I</b> dogs was compared with expression in corresponding vascular segments from three normal, age-matched dogs. Data were analyzed using R and whole genome network correlation analysis, a bias-free method of categorizing expression level and significance into discrete modules. Genes were further categorized based on module-trait relationships. Expression of clusterin, a protein implicated in other etiologies of cardiovascular disease, was assessed in canine and murine <b>mucopolysaccharidosis</b> <b>type</b> <b>I</b> aortas via Western blot and in situ immunohistochemistry. Gene families with more than two-fold, significant increased expression involved lysosomal function, proteasome function, and immune regulation. Significantly downregulated genes were related to cellular adhesion, cytoskeletal elements, and calcium regulation. Clusterin gene overexpression (9 -fold) and protein overexpression (1. 3 to 1. 62 -fold) was confirmed and located specifically in arterial plaques of mucopolysaccharidosis-affected dogs and mice. Overexpression of lysosomal and proteasomal-related genes are expected responses to cellular stress induced by lysosomal storage in <b>mucopolysaccharidosis</b> <b>type</b> <b>I.</b> Upregulation of immunity-related genes implicates the potential involvement of glycosaminoglycan-induced inflammation in the pathogenesis of mucopolysaccharidosis-related arterial disease, for which clusterin represents a potential biomarker...|$|R

40|$|A {{previously}} healthy 10 -month-old boy {{was referred}} to our hospital because of coarse facial features that were suggestive of lysosomal storage disease. Apart from noisy respiration, there was no medical history. Elevated levels of urinary glycosaminoglycans and complete deficiency of leukocyte alpha-L-iduronidase indicated severe <b>mucopolysaccharidosis</b> <b>type</b> <b>I.</b> A chest radiograph revealed a markedly enlarged heart, and echocardiography revealed hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. While hematopoietic stem cell transplantation was being planned, progressive cardiac failure developed with a striking hypokinesia of the left-ventricle free wall. In combination with ischemic changes on the electrocardiogram, this was suggestive of coronary artery disease. Results of coronary echo Doppler interrogation were inconclusive, and intravascular ultrasound in this little infant was not feasible.

However, {{in previous studies}} we failed to attain reliable long-term alpha-L-iduronidase expression in immunocompetent mice. Here, we focused on achieving sustained high-level expression in immunocompetent C 57 BL/ 6 mice. In our standard liver-directed treatment we hydrodynamically infuse mice with plasmids containing a SB transposon-encoding human alpha-L-iduronidase, along with a source of SB transposase. We sought to 1) minimize expression of the therapeutic enzyme in antigen-presenting cells, while avoiding promoter shutdown and gender bias, 2) increase transposition efficiency and 3) improve immunosuppression. By using a liver-specific promoter to drive IDUA expression, the SB 100 X hyperactive transposase and transient cyclophosphamide immunosuppression we achieved therapeutic-level (> 100 wild-type) stabilized expression for 1 year in 50 % of C 57 BL/ 6 mice. To gain insights into the causes of variability in transgene expression, we quantified the rates of alpha-L-iduronidase activity decay vis-a-vis transposition and transgene maintenance using the data obtained in this and previous studies.

ResultsStatistically significant (P[*]<[*]. 001) reductions in mean urinary glycosaminoglycan levels relative to baseline were observed 6 months after treatment initiation and were sustained throughout follow-up. Disease remained stable after treatment initiation with no statistically significant changes in mean FVC, 6 MWT, or height-for-age Z score. At last assessments, mitral and aortic valve function remained stable in 65 % (22 / 34) of patients; corneal clouding remained stable in 78 % (18 / 23); visual acuity remained stable in 33 % (8 / 24) and improved in 42 % (10 / 24) of patients. Younger patients (< 10 years at treatment initiation) maintained disease measures closer to norms for age for FVC, 6 MWT, and height and showed fewer deteriorations in mitral and aortic valve disease and corneal clouding compared with patients aged ≥ 10 years at treatment initiation.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Tandem mass {{spectrometry}} for the multiplex and quantitative analysis of enzyme activities in dried blood spots on newborn screening cards {{has emerged as}} a powerful technique for early assessment of lysosomal storage diseases. Here we report the design and process-scale synthesis of substrates for the enzymes α-L-iduronidase, iduronate- 2 -sulfatase, and N-acetylgalactosamine- 4 -sulfatase that are used for newborn screening of <b>mucopolysaccharidosis</b> <b>types</b> <b>I,</b> II, and VI. The products contain a bisamide unit that is hypothesized to readily protonate in the gas phase, which improves detection sensitivity by tandem {{mass spectrometry}}. The products contain a benzoyl group, which provides a useful site for inexpensive deuteration, thus facilitating the prepara-tion of internal standards for the accurate quantification of enzymatic products. Finally, the reagents are designed with ease of synthesis in mind, thus permitting scale-up preparation to support worldwide newborn screening of lysosomal storage diseases...|$|R
40|$|Lysosomal storage {{disorders}} (LSDs) comprise {{more than}} 50 extremely rare, inherited metabolic diseases {{resulting from a}} deficiency of specific lysosomal enzymes required for normal macromolecular metabolism. The National Collaborative Study for Lysosomal Storage Disorders (NCS-LSD), was a longitudinal cohort study which collected prospective and retrospective clinical data, and patient-reported data from adults and children with a confirmed diagnosis of Gaucher disease, Fabry disease, <b>mucopolysaccharidosis</b> <b>type</b> <b>I</b> (MPS <b>I),</b> <b>mucopolysaccharidosis</b> <b>type</b> II (MPS II), Pompe disease and Niemann Pick disease type C (NPC) in the UK. The study aimed to determine {{the natural history of}} these conditions and estimate the effectiveness and cost of therapies. Clinical outcomes were chosen to reflect disease progression. Age- and gender-adjusted treatment effects were estimated using generalised linear mixed models. Treated patients contributed data before and during treatment while untreated patients contributed natural history data. A total of 711 adults and children were recruited to this study from the seven LSD treatment centres in England. Data was collected from 2008 to 2011. This paper describes the methods used to collect and analyse clinical data for this study. The clinical findings are reported separately in a series of condition-specific articles in this issue...|$|R
40|$|A {{group of}} 27 Italian {{patients}} was screened for -L-iduronidase <b>mucopolysaccharidosis</b> <b>type</b> <b>I</b> mutations. Mutations {{were found in}} 18 patients, with 28 alleles identified. The two most common mutations in northern Europeans (W 402 X and Q 70 X) accounted for 11 % and 13 % of the alleles, respectively. The R 89 Q mutation, uncommon in Europeans, was found only in one patient, accounting for 1 of 54 alleles (1. 9 %). The other mutations, P 533 R, A 327 P and G 51 D, accounted for 11 %, 5. 6 % and 9. 3 % of the total alleles, respectively. Interestingly, the high frequency of the P 533 R mutation seems to be confined to Sicily and {{is higher than the}} 3 % reported in a British/Australian study. R. Gatti, P. DiNatale, G. R. D.

40|$|Introduction: <b>Mucopolysaccharidosis</b> <b>type</b> <b>I</b> (MPS I) is a {{progressive}} lysosomal storage disease. Impaired degradation of glycosaminoglycans triggers complex pathophysiological cascades, {{leading to a}} heterogeneous multisystem disorder. Two treatment modalities are available: enzyme replacement therapy and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Despite these treatments, a significant residual disease burden is observed in most patients. Areas covered: This review {{provides an overview of}} the currently known pathophysiological mechanisms underlying disease manifestations in MPS I. Additionally, the clinical presentation of the wide phenotypic spectrum is discussed, as well as methods for the phenotypical classification of patients and available treatment options, with a special focus on the treatment of residual disease. Expert opinion: Residual disease is currently the most pressing issue in MPS I, often requiring multiple surgical interventions. Several strategies are being explored to decrease the residual disease burden including modifications to the current treatment regimens and new therapeutic approaches. Optimal management of disease manifestations requires international collaboration and a standardized follow-up to collect essential clinical dat...|$|R
