40|$|Necessity is {{the mother}} of invention. A unique method of {{processing}} stereo satellite photos, independent from the ground survey control, was developed not because the advantages of this approach were initially identified, but instead because the majority of PhotoSat's first stereo satellite elevation mapping projects had no accurately surveyed ground control. Conventional stereo photo elevation mapping begins by identifying numerous ground survey control points on the stereo photos. The east, north and elevation coordinates of these points are then applied to the many location points in the photos. The elevation data is processed using the combination of the stereo photos and the ground survey points. During the 2003 to 2008 resource boom, Vancouver based mining exploration companies worked many advanced exploration and development projects in remote parts of the world. These projects required accurate, high resolution elevation maps for development plans, feasibility studies and resource and reserve estimates. Many of these projects, particularly at their early stages, had no or very poor quality ground survey data.

40|$|We {{develop a}} new {{estimation}} technique for recovering depth-of-field from multiple stereo images. Depth-of-field is estimated by determining the shift in image location resulting from different camera viewpoints. When this shift is not divisible by pixel width, the multiple stereo images can be com-bined to form a super-resolution image. By modeling this super-resolution image as a realization of a random field, one can view the recovery of depth as a likelihood estimation problem. We apply these modeling techniques to the recovery of cloud height from multiple viewing angles provided by the MISR instrument on the Terra Satellite.

Parameters essential to evaluate the binocular vision quality were tested 6 weeks after surgery. Function of fusion was tested with a Bagolini-Maddox test with striped glasses and a cross at 6 <b>m</b> distance. <b>Stereo</b> vision was tested with the Titmus stereotest with polaroid glasses at 40 cm distance. Results. Unaided near visual acuity was significantly better in &ldquo;multi&rdquo; group, while unaided distance visual acuity was almost same in both groups. Analysis of intraocular implant influence on the basic binocular vision functions, showed that 42 (84 %) patients in &ldquo;multi&rdquo; and 36 (72 %) patients in &ldquo;mono&rdquo; group had normal finding {{and there was no}} statistically significant difference between the groups. In stereo vision test, threshold of 100 arc seconds was achieved in 34 (68 %) in &ldquo;multi&rdquo; and 11 (22 %) patients in &ldquo;mono&rdquo; group. This difference was statistically significant. Conclusion. Lower levels of binocular vision are better after implantation of multifocal IOL rather than those with implanted monofocal IOL, but not statistically significant. In higher level of binocular vision there is a statistically significant improvement in binocular vision in favor of the multifocal IOL...|$|R
40|$|This paper proposes ground-in-the-loop, model-based visual {{localization}} {{system based}} on transmitted images to ground, to aid rendezvous and docking maneuvers between a servicer and a target satellite. In particular, we assume {{to deal with a}} partially cooperative target, i. e. passive and without fiducial markers, but supposed at least to keep a controlled attitude, up to small fluctuations, so that the approach mainly involves translational motion. For the purpose of localization, video cameras provide an effective and relatively inexpensive solution, working at a wide range of distances with an increasing accuracy and robustness during the approach. However, illumination conditions in space are especially challenging, due to the direct sunlight exposure and to the glossy surface of a satellite, that creates strong reflections and saturations and therefore a high level of background clutter and missing detections. We employ a monocular camera for mid-range tracking View the MathML source(20 – 5 <b>m)</b> and <b>stereo</b> camera at close-range View the MathML source(5 – 0. 5 m), with the respective detection and tracking methods, both using intensity edges and robustly dealing with the above issues. Our tracking system has been extensively verified at the facility of the European Proximity Operations Simulator (EPOS) of DLR, which is a very realistic ground simulation able to reproduce sunlight conditions through a high power floodlight source, satellite surface properties using multilayer insulation foils, as well as orbital motion trajectories with ground-truth data, by means of two 6 DOF industrial robots. Results from this large dataset show the effectiveness and robustness of our method against the above difficulties...|$|R

40|$|The basaltic {{plains of}} the Moon contain lava {{channels}} on scales {{of tens of}} meters to hundreds of kilometers. Many of these channels are segmented, strongly suggesting that some portions include covered lava tubes. Lunar lava tubes are expected to provide unique environments below the harsh lunar surface, maintaining near-isothermal conditions and substantial shielding from solar and galactic radiation. A lava tube has often been suggested as natural shelter for a future human outpost. Previous searches for lunar lava tubes have been limited {{by a combination of}} image resolution and completeness of coverage. The five robotic Lunar Orbiter spacecraft combined to photograph essentially the entire lunar surface with a resolution of 60 m, and covered selected sites with resolutions as high as 2 m. The highest-resolution Apollo images, from the mapping and panoramic cameras, covered swaths totaling 16 % of the lunar surface, at resolutions of approximately 5 m. The Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter [...] launched in June 2009 to a polar orbit [...] carries a suite of instruments that will revolutionize lunar remote sensing, including the identification and characterization of lava tubes. The Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter Camera (LROC) system includes a multi-spectral wide-angle camera with a resolution of 70 m, allowing a comprehensive survey of the entire lunar surface. The LROC narrow-angle camera is providing targeted images at resolutions of 0. 5 - 2 <b>m,</b> including <b>stereo</b> coverage, which should allow detection of tube entrances and breakdown structures. The Lunar Orbiter Laser Altimeter is producing a global topographic map with a vertical resolution of 1 m and a horizontal resolution of 50 m. These data will be critical to understanding lava dynamics and tube emplacement...|$|R
40|$|Cartosat- 1 satellite, {{launched}} on 5 th May 2005, {{is designed to}} deliver high-resolution spatial data of better than 2. 5 <b>m</b> in <b>stereo</b> with ~ 27 km swath. The twin panchromatic cameras (Fore & Aft), with a fixed base-to-height ratio 0. 62, image the terrain through alongtrack stereo almost simultaneously. The primary mission goal of this Indian satellite is to generate Digital Elevation Model (DEM) of a geographic region of interest (e. g. country) to facilitate the user communities of remote sensing and cartography. Space Applications Centre, ISRO, India has developed & demonstrated a technology to extract DEM from Cartosat- 1 ’s high resolution stereo data based on geometric modelling of long stereo strips using a few Ground Control Points (GCPs). This geometric modelling technique has been termed as Stereo Strip Triangulation (SST) for which dual camera space resection software is the core. It utilizes GCP observations from Fore & Aft cameras and rigorous photogrammetric imaging geometry model in order to update spacecraft attitude parameters to the geometric accuracies of < 15 m in planimetry. The SST technique is advantageous due to robustness of modelling and reduction in GCP requirements. The reason is that, the same GCP is visible in both Fore & Aft images; thereby a single GCP contributes to two observations in the modelling process simultaneously. In addition to the updated satellite orientations, DEM over a strip as well as Triangulated Control Points (TCPs) are the outputs of SST software. This paper presents {{the outcome of the}} exercises aimed at demonstrating the SST performance for (i) modelling long stereo strips and (ii) extension feasibility of the model over those imaged areas which are devoid of GCPs. 1...|$|R
