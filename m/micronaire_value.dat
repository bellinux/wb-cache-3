40|$|The <b>micronaire</b> <b>value</b> for cotton {{is related}} to both fibre linear density (fineness) and {{maturity}} however it is desirable to have independent measures of both of these parameters as they are both important quality measures of cotton. The objective {{of this paper is}} to evaluate the technical potential of the Cottonscan instrument under development at CSIRO for measuring the average fibre linear density of cotton lint samples. A newly developed snippet preparation module for sampling lint is described and an inter-laboratory round trial (three laboratories) was used to assess the precision of the instrument. Results confirm that the new snippet preparation device is both effective and easy to use. The inter-laboratory trial of the complete Cottonscan system (incorporating the new snippet preparation device) found no significant difference between laboratories/instruments for samples with average fibre linear density values in the calibration region (within 50 mtex of the calibration cotton) and small statistically differences (typically 2 - 4 mtex) occurring only outside of this range. Overall the 95 % confidence limits for a single measurement was estimated to be ± 10. 4 mtex for average fibre linear density (fineness) and ± 0. 047 units for average fibre maturity values.

To study {{the effect of adding}} rice straw as an organic waste to saline soil with the inoculation of some bacterial strains as biofertilizer (PGPR) and tea compost both separately or together with or without rice straw on cotton fiber quality compared to the control. As well as, study the impact of these transactions on some soil chemical and biological properties. The {{experiment was}} laid out in a split plot design with four replicates. The rice straw (R) application was taken the main plot as a main factor with two methods (with rice straw, without rice straw), whereas; the others fertilizers Treatments (T) were distributed randomly in the sub plots. Results revealed that, treating saline soil by rice straw achieved the highest content of soil organic matter, fiber upper half mean, fiber uniformity index, fiber strength, fiber elongation percentage, <b>micronaire</b> <b>value,</b> fiber maturity ratio and fiber reflected percent. In contrast, the fiber yellowness degree (b+) decreased, compared with the soil untreated with rice straw.

40|$|Cotton fibre is {{multigenic}} trait {{controlled by}} number of genes. Previous {{studies suggest that}} one of these genes may be responsible for switching cotton fibre growth on and off to influence the fibre quality produced from a cotton seed. In the present study, the Gossypium hirsutum GhEXPA 8 fibre expansin gene cloned into a pGA 482 plant expression vector with a 2 X 35 S promoter and a CaMV terminator was introduced into local cotton variety NIAB 846 by using an Agrobacterium-mediated gene transformation. The neomycin phosphotransferase (NPTII) gene was used as a selection marker for screening of putative transgenic cotton plants. Integration and expression of the fibre expansin gene in cotton plants was confirmed with molecular techniques including Southern blot analyses, real-time PCR and cellulose assays.

40|$|Arizona has {{experienced}} a trend toward increasing fiber <b>micronaire</b> <b>values</b> in recent years resulting in substantial discounts on fiber value. There is some evidence to suggest management can impact fiber micronaire. Approximately 250 cases were identified in cotton production areas in Arizona ranging from the lower Colorado River Valley to near 2, 000 ft. elevation with grower cooperators in the 2000 season. Field records were developed for each field by use of the University of Arizona Cotton Monitoring System (UA-CMS) for points such as variety, planting date, fertility management, irrigation schedules, irrigation termination, defoliation, etc. Routine plant measurements were conducted to monitor crop growth and development and to identify fruiting patterns and retention through the season. As the crop has approached cutout and the lower bolls began to open, open boll samples have been collected from the lowest four, first position bolls (theoretically the bolls with the highest micronaire potential on the plant) from 10 plants, ginned, and the fiber analyzed for micronaire (low 4). From that point forward, total boll counts per unit area and percent open boll measurements are being made on 14 -day intervals until the crop is defoliated. Following defoliation, final plant maps were performed. Relationships among low 4 samples micronaire, irrigation termination (IT), defoliation, and final crop micronaire were analyzed...|$|R
40|$|Salinity {{is a big}} {{threat to}} world agriculture. It imposes a major setback in {{increasing}} the yield of cotton. This crop is very sensitive to salinity at germination and seedling stage. Salt stress adversely affects the biomass production, i. e., decrease in leaf area, stem thickness, shoot and root weight and ultimately brings about decrease in seed cotton yield. A threshold salinity level at which initial yield of cotton declines is 7. 7 dS m - 1 with a 50 % reduction in yield at 17. 0 dS m - 1 . Reduction in fibre length, fibre strength and <b>micronaire</b> <b>values,</b> whereas an increase in ginning out-turn have been reported under saline conditions in both Gossypium hirsutum and Gossypium barbadense. High salinity level adverse affects photosynthesis. Research studies indicate decrease in nitrogen of leaf cotton with increasing salinity levels. Salinity increases Na+ and Cl- and decreases K+, Ca 2 + and Mg 2 + in leaves of cotton. Slight increase in K+ and modest accumulation of Na+ with increase in salinity have also been found in literature. K+/Na+ ratio {{has been used as}} a successful selection criterion for salt tolerance in some crops. Generally salt tolerance in cotton has been associated with Na+ exclusion.

40|$|For {{precision}} agriculture to work, {{an automated}} process to collect spatial-variability data within a field is necessary. Otherwise, data collection is prohibitively expensive and time consuming. Furthermore, to minimize measurement error due to harvesting method, data-collection processes involving normal cotton harvesting and ginning operations must be used. For {{the case of}} cotton, an automated prototype system using image processing to measure the <b>micronaire</b> <b>value</b> of cotton fiber during harvest was designed and built in the laboratory. This system was tested with two image-processing algorithms to identify and remove the effects of objects present in the images that were not cotton fiber, and then measure the reflectivity in three Near-Infrared (NIR) wavebands. Both algorithms yielded similar results when used on seed cotton samples. The reflectivity measurement after removing the effects of foreign matter had a strong relationship to standard micronaire measurements (R^ 2 = 0. 73 and 0. 74 for the ratio-image and single-image algorithms, respectively) with a root mean squared error (RMSE) of 0. 28 and 0. 27, respectively. The ratio-image pixel classification method classified an average of 58 % of the pixels in an image as "cotton", while the single-image method classified an average of 81 % of the pixels in each image as cotton. These results do not show as strong a relationship between micronaire and NIR reflectivity of cotton samples as previous research done with very uniform lint cotton calibration samples. This is attributed to the higher content of foreign matter in seed cotton samples. With higher trash cotton and fiber {{that has not yet}} been cleaned, results obviously are not as good as when using calibration cotton samples. These results indicate the system can be adapted to perform in-situ measurement of cotton fiber quality, specifically micronaire, and enable harvesters to create quality maps of a field automatically to allow better crop management...|$|E

The {{experiment was}} conducted at four growth stages of cotton (seedling, squaring, flowering, and boll opening), and the waterlogging duration at each stage was set to five levels (2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 d) and the waterlogging depth was 5 cm. Twenty different treatment combinations were established, and one group without waterlogging throughout the whole growth period was used as the control (CK). The results showed that the waterlogging treatments at the different growth stages reduced the morphological and yield parameters of the cotton plants as well as the physiological parameters of the cotton leaves, and the extent of the reduction in these parameters increased with the extension of the waterlogging duration. The effect of waterlogging at different growth stages on the cotton decreased in the order of the flowering, squaring, seedling, and boll-opening stages, and the highest yield reduction rates for the four stages were 38. 8 %, 27. 9 %, 18. 3 %, and 7. 6 % respectively. Additionally, waterlogging decreased the quality parameters of cotton such as the upper-half mean length, uniformity index, <b>micronaire</b> <b>value,</b> elongation, yellowness, and lint percentage at the squaring, flowering, and boll-opening stages. Furthermore, at the seedling stage waterlogging for no more than 6 d allowed the morphological and yield parameters to recover in the boll-opening stage upon timely drainage, and these parameters showed no significant decreases compared with the CK level. The critical duration of waterlogging at the squaring stage was 4 d. However, at the flowering stage, even 2 d of waterlogging could lead to the stagnation of morphological development and prevent the recovery of the cotton yield to the CK level. Therefore, when waterlogging disasters occur in cotton fields, the implementation of appropriate surface and subsurface drainage schemes for the different growth stages is needed as soon as possible to mitigate the damage...|$|E

Our study was performed at Cotton Res. Inst., Agric. Res. Center, Egypt, during 2011 and 2012 seasons to study the effect of using cyanobacteria strain (Spirulina platensis) (Azolla pinnata) as biofertilizers and Humic acid as an organic fertilizer on the technological properties of the colored cotton. Split plot design with three replicates was used in this study. The cotton Type (T) was occupied the main plot as a main factor with two levels (green cotton, brown cotton), while; the fertilizers treatments (F) were distributed randomly in the sub plots. The effect of all factors under study and their interaction were significant for all characters under study except for the effect of the main factor and the interaction on the soil biological characters, the effect of the sub main factor and the interaction on fiber upper half mean (mm), fiber elongation%, the effect of all factors and their interaction on fiber uniformity index and the effect of the interaction on the color parameters on both years.

40|$|This {{investigation}} was into {{the processing of}} long, fine Australian cotton in high-mass throughput saw gins. The research was conducted at the Auscott Narrabri gin in New South Wales, Australia using Australian cotton with a UHML of 30. 9 mm and 31. 8 mm, with a <b>micronaire</b> <b>value</b> of 3. 85. Mass production rates trials ranged between 3200 and 3800 kg/h of lint. In particular, the feed and discharge of seed was investigated, and the results demonstrate that the gin stand motor load frequently fluctuates due to the varying mass input of seed cotton. Furthermore, the distribution of seed cotton presented to the gin stand is laterally non-uniform. It is thought that a non-uniform vertical feed results in elevated nep and seed-coat nep due to the changing seed-roll density. The source of the uneven lateral distribution of seed cotton to the gin stand lies within the design of distributor conveyor, which feeds seed cotton to the gin stand. Because of the high speed required to transport seed cotton in the conveyor distributor, the drop zone of seed cotton to each feed hopper is overshot. The trailing edge of the hopper is further seed cotton deficient. The auger blade together with the auger housing create a nip point allowing for the seed cotton to be {{pulled out of the}} feed hopper. Methods to overcome the problem were trialled,, including redirecting the seed cotton on the gin stand apron, modifying the conveyor distributor, and increasing the seed cotton mass in the affected areas to improve the uniformity of the seed roll density. The uneven input of seed cotton creates an uneven output of fuzzy seed. The region of the gin stand most affected was the corresponding delivery side. This output region expelled up to four times more fuzzy seed than other expulsion areas of the gin stand. The uneven fuzzy seed expulsion is attributed to the seed roll density, as the roll box is unevenly loaded with incoming seed cotton. Uneven loading of seed cotton creates areas within the roll box that experience a reduction in density, and this creates a movement of fuzzy seed from high-density areas to the neighbouring lower-density areas. Therefore, high levels of fuzzy seed expulsion occur in areas of lesser density. The output distribution curve of fuzzy seed equates approximately to the inverse curve of the seed cotton input. Elongation of the leading and trailing edge angle on the hopper of the gin stand was not finalised because of time constraints. This method is believed to enable the elimination of the uneven seed roll. The elongation length may be required up to 60 cm. Overcoming the uneven vertical flow can be achieved through electrical settings of the feed hopper motor. Eliminating the uneven lateral feed has the potential to increase production by approximately 12 per cent. It is envisaged that tight seed roll occurrence will reduce with an evenly loaded seed roll, further increasing productivity. Saw blade wear should also reduce, together with the event of fires as a result of tight seed rolls. Roll box geometry was also investigated, and this highlighted frictional properties, mechanical interaction of the saw teeth, and seed roll densities. Decreasing the time that the seed cotton is present in the roll box would reduce mechanical interaction. Further, the lint mass production rate was investigated, and results indicated that reducing mass production rates decreased nep and seed-coat nep because of a decrease in the seed roll density. Research was conducted on Continental Eagle 161 gin stands. ...|$|E

In order to do this, it is neces-sary to understand the opportunities that exist to improve the measurement of short fiber. Since the Advanced Fiber Information System (AFIS) is the most widely recognized method for determining short fiber content in cotton, it is the focus of this study. Hand sortings of fibers were collected by length groups from three bales of upland cotton with <b>micronaire</b> <b>values</b> of 3. 7, 4. 3, and 5. 4. These fibers were tested for micronaire and strength by the Fibronaire and Stelometer, respectively, and then tested on AFIS to determine the lengths of the fibers ranging from 9. 53 mm to 25. 44 mm. Although short fibers were not present in a sample prior to testing on AFIS, the machine reported a short fiber content measurement. In addition, frictional properties and convolutions of individual fibers were determined by the RotorRing and by Favimat, respectively, for each sample. These tests indicated that the high micronaire cottons exhibited more convolutions than the low micronaire counterparts, and that the longer fibers exhibited higher frictional properties than shorter fibers. Short fiber content, fibers less than 12. 7 mm (0. 5 in) long, in cotton has a significant influence on the marketability, processing, and end-product quality of cotton. The accurate and precise measurement of short fiber content in a given cotton sample has been the goal of many research efforts (Zeidman et al., 1991).

40|$|The {{increased}} cost {{of planting}} transgenic or stacked gene cotton cultivars has stimulated interest {{in determining the}} optimal planting density for commercial production. If seeding rates can be reduced without adversely affecting lint yield and fiber quality, producers could regulate initial inputs by fluctuating seeding rates. However, manipulating plant density per unit area can affect the growth {{and development of the}} crop. This altered growth throughout the season could potentially affect fiber quality. Fiber properties, which dictate price discounts, are determined by maturity, diameter and length, as well as by physiological activity at the cellular level. These fiber properties are also affected by genetics and environmental conditions, which ultimately can impact lint production as well as the location of bolls set throughout the plant and the maturation period. The objective {{of this study was to}} examine the impact of plant density (including high, ideal and low densities) on growth and development of transgenic cotton cultivars. Field experiments were conducted in 2003 and 2004 at the Texas Agricultural Experiment Station in Burleson County, Texas to assess the effects of plant density on lint yield and fiber quality. Experimental design was a spit-plot design with four replications of three cultivars (SG 215 BG/RR, DP 555 BG/RR, ST 4892 BG/RR) in densities ranging from 74 to 222 thousand plants hectare- 1. Plant density had no significant effect on lint yield in 2003 or 2004. However, low plant density treatments contained significantly more bolls plant- 1 as a result of the plant??s compensatory ability to produce the same number of bolls in a given area. These low density treatments also produced more vegetative biomass plant- 1. Due to lower boll numbers and lower ginout percentage, ST 4892 produced the lowest lint yield each year. Lint quality was not significantly affected by density or cultivar treatments either year.

In addition, the economic relationships of IT treatments were also evaluated. The experimental design was a split plot in a randomized complete block design with three replications. The main treatments included the five IT dates and the subunits consisted of 11 Upland varieties and a Pima variety. The first two IT treatments (IT 1 and IT 2) were imposed {{with the intention of}} terminating irrigations very early and pre-maturely at peak bloom. Based upon current UA recommendations for IT to complete a single cycle fruit set, the more optimal date of IT would have included one or two additional irrigations (beyond IT 1 and IT 2). In this experiment, IT 2 was structured to provide an additional (one) irrigation just past peak bloom. For the IT 3 plots, the intention was to attempt to time termination in advance of cutout. The 2004 and 2005 IT 4 and IT 5 were imposed to attempt to complete the primary fruiting cycle development and produce a second cycle fruit set that require irrigations until late August and late September, respectively. In general, lint yield and micronaire results revealed significant differences among the IT treatments and varieties. In a similar fashion to a previous set of IT experiments (2000 - 2002), lint yield and <b>micronaire</b> <b>values</b> consistently increased with later IT dates. The best combined lint yield and micronaire results were achieved with IT 4 date, which received 12 and 18 in. less irrigation water than IT 5 in 2004 and 2005, respectively. In 2004 and 2005, the 12 and 18 in. water saved equate to approximately 20 % and 30 % less water used under the conventional practice, respectively. The average marginal value of water for all eleven Upland varieties in going from IT 1 to IT 2, IT 2 to IT 3, IT 3 to IT 4, and IT 4 to IT 5 for November 2004 prices and low carrying costs is calculated at $ 320. 07, $ 150. 15, $ 100. 54, and -$ 28. 16 per acre-foot of water. If steeper mike discounts (November 1999), a lower base lint price (45 ¢/lb.), and higher costs (i. e., more costly insecticide and chemical costs) are imputed to extend the crop, the marginal value of an acre-foot of water for all Upland varieties and replications in going from IT 1 to IT 2, IT 2 to IT 3, IT 3 to IT 4, and IT 4 to IT 5 is estimated at $ 164. 04, $ 48. 15, $ 12. 97, and -$ 94. 79. Profitability and the value of water for extending the season varies quite markedly between different varieties and termination dates...|$|R
40|$|Twin line (two seed lines 7. 25 in apart per bed) and {{conventional}} single seed line per bed cotton production systems were compared at 18 sites across Arizona and the Palo Verde Valley near Blythe, Ca. in 2002 and 9 sites in 2003. Three experiments at the Chaffin site in 2002 compared twin line plant populations of 57, 000 (57 K), 75, 000 (75 K), and 90, 000 (90 K) plants per acre (ppa). In 2002, the twin line system produced more lint than the conventional single line system at 4 of 18 locations; the yields {{of the twin}} line and single line systems were 1273 and 1186 lb/acre, 1572 and 1461 lb/acre, 1478 and 1290 lb/acre, and 1309 and 1210 lb/acre, respectively, at the Grasty, Ramona, Rovey, and Wells sites, respectively. In 2003, none of the experiments resulted in higher twin line system lint yields. In 2002, {{there were no significant}} differences in yield or fiber micronaire in 7 of the 18 experiments. In 2003, {{there were no significant differences}} in yield in 3 of the 9 experiments. In 2002, the twin line system produced less lint than the conventional system at 5 of 18 locations; yields of the twin line and single line systems were 2019 and 2189 lb/acre, 1400 and 1489 lb/acre, 1537 and 1845 lb/acre, 1065 and 1200 lb/acre, and 1271 and 1431 lb/acre, respectively, at the Chaffin (75 K), Cooley, Hull, Papago, and Wakimoto sites, respectively. In 2003, the twin line system resulted in less yield in 6 of the 9 experiments; yields of the twin line and single line systems were 1154 and 1285 lb. /acre, 1906 and 2109 lb. /acre, 1797 and 1938 lb. /acre, 878 and 1114 lb. /acre, 726 and 821 lb. /acre, and 1230 and 1404 lb. /acre, respectively, at the Hull, Marlatt 1, 2,, 3, Murphy Late Plant, and the University of Arizona (UA) Marana Agricultural Center sites respectively. In 2002, fiber micronaire was reduced in five experiments; the <b>micronaire</b> <b>values</b> were 4. 25 and 4. 73, 4. 46 and 4. 78, 4. 60 and 4. 85, 4. 76 and 4. 98, and 4. 93 and 5. 15, in the twin line and single line systems, respectively, at the Rogers, Papago, Grasty, Hull, and Perry sites, respectively. In 2003, there were no significant differences in fiber micronaire at all 9 test locations. In 2003, visual observations suggested that the spindle pickers were unable to effectively harvest bolls the lowest bolls primarily below the cross-over point of the two 2 mainstems cross in the twin line system. Hand harvest comparisons of the twin and single line system resulted in yields of 1776 and 1661 lb. /acre respectively, a 6 % difference at the Maricopa Agricultural Center. It was concluded that tThe inability to effectively harvest the twin line cotton is the most significant system problem with this production system...|$|R
