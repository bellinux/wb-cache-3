5|$|In {{order to}} be effective, costly signals must fulfill {{specific}} criteria. Firstly, signallers must incur different levels of cost and benefit for signalling behaviour. Secondly, costs and benefits must reflect the signallers’ phenotypic quality. Thirdly, the information provided by a signal should be directed at and accessible to an audience. A receiver can be anyone who stands to benefit from information the signaller is sending, such as potential mates, allies, or competitors. Honesty is guaranteed when only individuals of high quality can pay the (high) costs of signalling. Hence, costly signals <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>impossible</b> <b>for</b> low-quality individuals to fake a signal and fool a receiver.|$|E
5|$|The {{regiment}} {{was split}} {{into three groups}} for the attack. Three battalions acted as spearheads for the 5th Division on land while two more battalions conducted the landings in Imwonjin. This 2,500 man force reassembled and then led the North Korean units south. In the meantime, the 3rd Battalion, 766th Regiment was detached and sent {{on a mission to}} infiltrate Pusan. Paired with additional support, it formed the 600-man 588th Unit. 588th Unit was tasked with raiding Pusan harbor, destroying vital facilities to <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>impossible</b> <b>for</b> UN forces to land troops there. However, the troop transport carrying the 588th Unit was discovered and sunk by United Nations ships outside Pusan harbor the morning of June 25, destroying the 3rd Battalion.|$|E

25|$|In March 2015, a {{document}} allegedly regarding a closure {{case against the}} Republican People's Party was leaked online, causing many opposition politicians to accuse the AKP of attempting to eliminate competition through anti-democratic practices. The party's leader Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu confirmed the claims, stating that he had known about the preparations for a closure case for some time. AKP leader Ahmet Davutoğlu denied the claims and called for Kılıçdaroğlu {{to meet with him}} to put forward a constitutional amendment that would <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>impossible</b> <b>for</b> a political party to be shut down by the courts.|$|E
25|$|The {{object of}} the wiring parties was {{to slow down the}} enemy’s attack, while {{speeding}} up their own. For this reason, workers attempted to <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>impossible</b> <b>for</b> the enemy to get to their trench, while sabotaging the enemy’s wire for their own benefit. In addition, though the distance between trenches varied between 7 and 500 yards, workers tried to erect barbed wire defences as far away from their trench as possible, to prevent the enemy from getting too close to the trench, or possibly lobbing in grenades.|$|E

25|$|For 17 months, {{the fort}} {{was able to}} harass French {{shipping}} trying to enter Fort-de-France. The guns on the rock completely dominated the channel {{between it and the}} main island, and because of their elevation, were able to fire far out to sea and forced vessels to give it a wide berth, with the result that the currents and strong winds would <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>impossible</b> <b>for</b> them to fetch in Port Royal. During this time the French troops on Martinique made several unsuccessful attempts to retake the rock.|$|E

He then traveled to Washington, D.C. and attempted to join the armed forces there. After passing the physical examination, he was again denied acceptance, for the same reason.

25|$|In an {{alternative}} scenario, wartime hysteria {{can be explained}} as the body’s suppression of normal physiological functioning {{in order to avoid}} the scenario which activates the danger instincts and releases the associated emotion of fear into consciousness. Hysterical soldiers often presented with symptoms of paralysis and diminished or lost sensory capacities, even in the absence of anxiety or depression.These physiological symptoms, although distressing in themselves, <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>impossible</b> <b>for</b> a soldier to be returned to the front line. Thus, the body compensates for its inability to suppress the danger instincts in the face of war by making it so that the soldier must avoid warfare altogether.|$|E
25|$|Fighting {{intensified}} the following Monday, May 21, when the police, augmented by several hundred newly deputized {{members of the}} Citizens Alliance, an employer organization, attempted {{to open up the}} market for trucking. Fighting began when a loaded truck began leaving a loading dock. The battle became a general melee when hundreds of pickets armed with clubs of all sorts rushed to the area to support the picketers; when the police drew their guns as if to shoot, the union sent a truck loaded with picketers into the mass of police and deputies in order to <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>impossible</b> <b>for</b> them to fire without shooting each other.|$|E

Others appreciated how Jelinek revealed that she suffers from agoraphobia and social phobia, paranoid conditions that developed when she first decided to write seriously. Both conditions are anxiety disorders which can be highly disruptive to everyday functioning yet are often concealed by those affected, out of shame, or feelings of inadequacy. She has said her anxiety disorders <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>impossible</b> <b>for</b> her to go to the cinema or board an airplane (in an interview she wished to be able to fly to New York to see the skyscrapers one day before dying), and incapable of taking part in any ceremony.|$|E

25|$|However, in {{individuals}} with SP, {{there is almost}} no blocking of exogenous stimuli, which means it is much easier for a stimulus to arouse the individual. There may also be a problem with the regulation of melatonin, which under normal circumstances regulates the serotonergic neural populations. Melatonin is typically at its lowest point during REM sleep. Inhibition of melatonin at an inappropriate time would <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>impossible</b> <b>for</b> the sleep off neural populations to depolarize when presented with a stimulus that would normally lead to complete arousal. The vestibular nuclei in particular has been identified as being closely related to dreaming during the REM stage of sleep. According to this hypothesis, vestibular-motor disorientation, unlike hallucinations, arise from completely endogenous sources of stimuli.|$|E
25|$|GGYC {{also argued}} that the rules that should apply to the race must be the SNG rules that were in force when GGYC filed its challenge. Otherwise, said GGYC, SNG could {{arbitrarily}} change the rules so as to <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>impossible</b> <b>for</b> the challenger to win. For example, said GGYC, the modified rules could specify that the challenger would have to race while dragging an anchor. According to GGYC, it did not make sense to envisage that the rules could be changed after the challenge was issued, since the challenger based its challenge on SNG's rules {{at the time of}} the challenge. GGYC also challenged certain provisions of the agreement between ISAF and SNG, in particular concerning the powers of the jury.|$|E
25|$|When a match {{ends with}} {{completion}} of the specified maximum number of rounds, and the judges of the match have awarded {{an equal amount of}} points to both contestants, or if there are three judges (as is the custom) and one judge awards the fight to one fighter, another awards the fight to the opposing fighter, and the third scores it a draw (split draw), the match is declared a draw. The contest would be scored a draw even if two of three judges score it a draw and the third does not (a majority draw). Draws are relatively rare in boxing: certain scoring systems <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>impossible</b> <b>for</b> a judge to award equal points for a match. If a championship bout ends in a draw, the champion usually retains the title.|$|E

25|$|Whitley was a {{longtime}} alcoholic, who began drinking {{early in his}} career at bluegrass gigs, long before he was legally allowed to drink alcohol. Many times, he had attempted to overcome his alcoholism, but failed; and his pre-existing depression made it more challenging for him to quit. Moreover, Whitley preferred to drink alone, making it difficult for anyone to detect that he had a problem. According to Lorrie Morgan, she tried to conceal all alcoholic beverages from him at the home they shared, even going to the extent of binding their legs together before going to bed to <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>impossible</b> <b>for</b> Whitley to awaken {{in the middle of the}} night to consume a drink without her knowledge - only to discover that he would drink various items such as perfume and nail polish remover to get intoxicated.|$|E
25|$|The British {{telephone}} system proved vulnerable to German artillery-fire {{and the movement}} of troops along communication trenches was delayed by far more than the most pessimistic expectations. An equilibrium between attack and defence quickly resumed, which could only be upset by another set-piece attack, after a delay for preparation which gave the defenders just as much time to reorganise. The attack front was found to have been wide enough to <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>impossible</b> <b>for</b> the small number of German reserves to defeat the attack but the attackers had not been ordered to assist units which had been held up and reinforcements were sent to renew failed attacks rather than reinforce success. Small numbers of German troops in strong-points and isolated trenches, had been able to maintain a volume of small-arms fire sufficient to stop the advance of far greater numbers of attackers.|$|E
25|$|Grimm's monumental {{dictionary}} of the German Language, the Deutsches Wörterbuch, {{was started}} in 1838 and first published in 1854. The Brothers anticipated it would take 10 years and encompass some 6-7 volumes. However, it was undertaken on so large a scale as to <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>impossible</b> <b>for</b> them to complete it. The dictionary, {{as far as it}} was worked on by Grimm himself, {{has been described as a}} collection of disconnected antiquarian essays of high value. It was finally finished by subsequent scholars in 1961 and supplemented in 1971. At 33 volumes at some 330,000 headwords, it remains a standard work of reference to the present day. A current project at the Berlin-Brandenburg Academy of Sciences and Humanities is underway to update the Deutsches Wörterbuch to modern academic standards. Volumes A-F were scheduled for release in 2012.|$|E
