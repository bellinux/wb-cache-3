Seyd's {{writings}} on banking, bullion operations, and kindred subjects were well known, and his persistent advocacy of the use of silver as a standard, and his opposition to the policy <b>of</b> <b>demonetisation</b> <b>of</b> that metal, constitute him a leading, if not the principal pioneer of the nineteenth-century [...] "bimetallic" [...] movement in England.|$|R

5000|$|In 1997 War {{veterans}} began receiving individual personal {{payments of}} ZW$50,000 each for their {{service in the}} war, costing the nation's tax payers {{billions of dollars and}} depleting government coffers.

Most never to return.|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} {{ideas to}} produce one- and two-dollar coins were proposed in 1986 because of ongoing inflation which had lowered {{the value of}} the dollar and would cause the <b>demonetisation</b> <b>of</b> the one and two cent coins in 1988.

In response to the <b>demonetisation</b> <b>of</b> 500 and 1000 rupee banknotes by the Indian government, Mann Deshi bank is now helping rural people by providing 500 rupees of coin in exchange for 500 rupee notes.

Mann Deshi Bank also has a business school on wheels through which it provides training to rural women.|$|R
50|$|After {{the recent}} <b>demonetisation</b> <b>of</b> old 500 and 1000 Rs notes, Reserve Bank of India (RBI) {{collected}} these notes {{in excess of}} (more than INR 2 trillions) what it had officially released into circulation earlier. The value of fake notes received by RBI is negligible compared to total value. GoI shall conduct thorough probe to reveal how it has happened and bring to book the culprits. This could have happened by unscrupulous politicians yielding power with the connivance of RBI top brass to plunder wealth of the nation.|$|R
50|$|Transactions in the Indian {{agriculture}} sector {{are heavily}} dependent on cash and were adversely affected by the <b>demonetisation</b> <b>of</b> ₹500 and ₹1,000 banknotes. Due to scarcity of the new banknotes, many farmers have insufficient cash to purchase seeds, fertilisers and pesticides needed for the plantation of rabi crops usually sown around mid-November. Farmers and their unions conducted protest rallies in Gujarat, Amritsar and Muzaffarnagar against the demonetisation as well as against restrictions imposed by the Reserve Bank of India on district cooperative central banks which were ordered not to accept or exchange the demonetised banknotes.|$|R
5000|$|The Mahatma Gandhi New Series of {{banknotes}} {{are issued}} by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) as the legal tender of the Indian rupee (...) , intended to replace the Mahatma Gandhi Series of banknotes.

50|$|The Constitutional {{validity}} of 1978 Act <b>of</b> <b>Demonetisation</b> was challenged in the Supreme Court of India, on the claimed {{grounds that it}} violated the then Fundamental Right of property.

25|$|The last <b>demonetisation</b> <b>of</b> rupiah notes {{occurred}} in late 1965, {{at which time}} inflation was ravaging the economy: exports had dropped 24% 1959–1965, GDP growth was below population growth, and the foreign exchange reserves had fallen by over 90%. Inflation in 1965 was 635%. In late 1965, the 'new rupiah' was brought in, at 1 new rupiah to 1,000 old rupiah. The official exchange rate was set initially at Rp 0.25 to US$1 as of 13 December 1965, a rate that did not represent reality, as the multiple exchange rate system remained {{in place for the}} time being.|$|R
5|$|One 1954 penny is known, struck for die-testing {{purposes}} at the Royal Mint, {{and intended}} for melting, but recovered from circulation. By {{the end of}} the 1950s, the price of metal ensured that every bronze coin was struck at a loss; the Mint hoped for a reduction in size, and the <b>demonetisation</b> <b>of</b> the farthing at the end of 1960 helped clear the way for such a scheme. It was not until 1961 that there was a need for more pennies to be minted, and production continued each year in very large numbers until the final pre-decimal pennies for circulation, dated 1967, were coined.|$|R
25|$|Between 2005 and 2008 new, lighter fifty-paise, one-, two- and five-rupee coins were introduced, {{made from}} {{ferritic}} stainless steel. The move {{was prompted by}} the melting-down of older coins, whose face value was less than their scrap value. The <b>demonetisation</b> <b>of</b> the 25-(chawanni) paise coin and all paise coins below it took place, and {{a new series of}} coins (50 paise– nicknamed athanni– one, two, five and ten rupees, with the new rupee symbol) were put into circulation in 2011. Coins commonly in circulation are one, two, five and ten rupees. Although it is still legal tender, the 50-paise (athanni) coin is rarely seen in circulation.|$|R
50|$|At present, {{the oldest}} {{circulating}} coins in the UK are the 1p and 2p copper coins introduced in 1971. No other coins from before 1982 are in circulation. Prior to the <b>demonetisation</b> <b>of</b> the larger 10p in 1993, the oldest circulating coins had usually dated from 1947: although older coins (shilling; florin, sixpence to 1980) were still legal tender, inflation meant that their silver content was {{worth more than}} their face value, which meant that they tended {{to be removed from}} circulation. Before decimalisation in 1971, a handful of change might have contained coins 100 or more years old, bearing any of five monarchs' heads, especially in the copper coins.|$|R

50|$|However, {{over the}} years of {{printing}} there have been five different signatures from five Government Financial Secretaries(namely Sir Henry Butters, Sir John Cowperthwaite, Sir Philip Haddon-Cave, Sir John Henry Bremridge, Sir Piers Jacobs and Sir Hamish Macleod) on the one-cent note. People can find their notes' year of issue on web pages littered around the Internet. These notes had five major issues: the first issued from 1941 bearing a portrait of King George VI, then {{a total of five}} issues from 1961-1971, 1971-1981, 1981-1986, 1986-1992 and the final generation from 1992 until the <b>demonetisation</b> <b>of</b> the one-cent note in 1995. All had the picture of Queen Elizabeth II on the front.|$|R

50|$|The last twenty-five øre coin {{was first}} struck in 1990. Its {{composition}} changed from cupro-nickel to an alloy of copper, zinc and tin. No portrait or monogram featured, only {{the crown of}} Christian V of Denmark on the obverse. Due to the decreasing value of the coin, it was abolished as a legal tender as of 1 October 2008. Its exchange for circulating coins was removed on 1 October 2011. Despite the changes in alloy and design of twenty-five øre coins from 1874 to 2009, all were full legal tender until the <b>demonetisation</b> <b>of</b> the currency, although the bullion value of the silver coins would far exceed their face value.|$|R
25|$|After <b>demonetisation</b> <b>of</b> ₹500 and ₹1000 rupee notes various {{authorities}} {{noticed a}} surge in shell companies depositing cash in banks, possibly {{in an attempt to}} hide the real owner of the wealth. In response, in July 2017, the authorities ordered nearly 2 lakh shell companies to be shut down while Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) imposed trading restrictions on 162 listed entities as shell companies. In September 2017, the government froze bank accounts of nearly 2 lakh shell companies. A day after, the Corporate Affairs ministry decided to: ban around 300,000 directors of shell companies from serving on the boards of other firms, track down the beneficial owners of suspected shell companies and take penal action against those who divert funds from these shell companies.|$|R
5000|$|The {{real estate}} sector {{is thought to}} be {{collapsing}} due to increasing costs of financing. Real estate projects in India {{take a long time to}} complete due to a complicated and corrupt regulatory mechanism. Several of the India's publicly traded real estate firms are in debt. The inventory of unsold real estate assets is growing and it is expected the market will undergo price corrections. According to Mumbai-based market research agency, Liases Foras, 30% of the transaction in the real estate sector is done with black money. <b>Demonetisation</b> <b>of</b> 500 and 1000 rupee notes by Prime minister Modi proved to be the last straw that broke the black money camel's back. Experts expect new property prices to fall upto 50% in next three months in Tier 1 cities.|$|R
