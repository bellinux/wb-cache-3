500|$|At the 2000 MTV Video Music Awards, Ulrich {{appeared}} with host Marlon Wayans in a skit that criticized {{the idea of}} using Napster to share music. Marlon played a college student listening to Metallica's [...] "I Disappear". Ulrich walked in and asked for an explanation. Ulrich responded to Wayans' excuse that using Napster was just [...] "sharing" [...] by saying that Wayans' idea of sharing was [...] "borrowing things that were not yours without asking". He called in the Metallica road crew, who proceeded to confiscate all of Wayans' belongings, leaving him almost naked in an empty room. Napster creator Shawn Fanning responded later in the ceremony by presenting an award wearing a Metallica shirt, saying, [...] "I borrowed this shirt from a friend. <b>Maybe,</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> like it, I'll buy one of my own." [...] Ulrich was later booed on stage at the award show when he introduced the final musical act, Blink-182.|$|E
500|$|In 2000, Björk starred on {{her acting}} debut Dancer in the Dark. Whilst {{she worked on}} the film, she also began {{producing}} her next album, writing new music and teaming with new collaborators. She {{had to go to}} Denmark to work on the film and there was nothing going on. She was lying on the beach whilst looking at the ocean, with a ghetto blaster listening to producer Thomas Knak's music. When she realised he was from Copenhagen, she called him up". [...] "Cocoon", produced by Knak, {{was one of the last}} songs to be written for the album; its melody came to Björk in a sudden rush and she contacted him. She made a long-distance, late-night phone call to Knak in Denmark, and woke him up. [...] "I didn't have any track of time so she didn't really know that I was asleep. She was explaining that she had this melody in her head and <b>maybe,</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> had the time, she would still have two or three weeks to decide if this track could be worked on", said the producer. Knak took it as a chance to make a more minimal track, similar to his own releases. He liked the idea of having two songs on the album, and immediately after he put down the phone, he started working. His original treatment of [...] "Cocoon", made with an Ensoniq ASR-10, appeared relatively intact in the final version. Knak elaborated: [...] "She had two changes: one for one semitone up and another for I think about 20BPM slower or something. I don't really make music so I'm not really used to thinking could the singer really sing in a tempo. From there she started working on the lyrics and one more melody for the vocal".|$|E

500|$|The BBC used viral {{promotion}} on the EastEnders homepage {{to further}} develop {{the character of}} Danielle. A new section named Danielle's Diary was launched, encompassing events in the show from 6 October 2008 onwards, written in diary style from Danielle's point of view. Insight was given into the character's thoughts and feelings on the events surrounding her each week, beginning with the introduction: [...] "Bit new to all this. Need some way to clear my head though. Can't really talk to Stace. Or Callum. Or anyone. <b>Maybe</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> write it all down, my head won't explode... Anyway, welcome to my life in Walford." [...] In this manner, viewers were {{able to keep up}} with the character during her temporary absence from the show in February 2009, when she returned home to Telford following her abortion: [...] "Back in Dawley. Feels strange to be away from Stacey... away from R away from Ronnie. Been sleeping a lot – so tired. When I was younger I never dreamt that I’d go through all of this. Stace keeps ringing, but I can’t speak to anyone. I can’t even listen to my voicemail", and were privy to Danielle's internal worries about her relationship with Ronnie: [...] "It's like I scare R. It was as though she scared herself, as she actually admitted that she cared. For about ten seconds I felt close to her again. Like watching the sun appear from behind a cloud... feeling the warmth across your skin again. But, then it disappears as another cloud sweeps over it." [...] The final entry, dated minutes before Danielle's on-screen death, reads: [...] "All I ever wanted was for mum to look at me with love in her eyes. To call me her baby. To tell me she loved me. I have to leave now. I have to go back to Telford. Goodbye Walford." [...] After the character had been killed off, the diary format gave way to a wall of memorial messages, supposedly penned by other EastEnders characters, including Abi Branning (Lorna Fitzgerald), Lucy Beale (Melissa Suffield), Callum and Stacey.|$|E
2500|$|Monica's career {{came to a}} {{slow down}} in 1999 due to {{relationship}} problems with her ex-boyfriend Jarvis Weems. In July 2000, the couple were together at the gravesite of Weems's brother, {{who had died in}} an automobile accident at age 25 in 1998, when Weems, without warning, put a gun to his head and committed suicide. [...] "Afterward, I felt, 'What else could I have done?' You replay that situation over and over and you switch it around: <b>Maybe</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> had said this, or if I would have done that,'" [...] {{she said in an interview}} with The Cincinnati Enquirer the following year.

30|$|Basically, the {{clustering}} algorithm in [33] follows {{four steps}} towards dividing the network into clusters and defining the cluster heads.

[...] "You just come some casting day, and I'll show you sights you won't forget in a hurry.

40|$|After {{a decade}} of {{gravitational}} microlensing experiments, a dozen of microlensing candidates {{in the direction of}} the stars of the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) have been detected by the EROS and MACHO groups. Recently it was shown that the distribution of the duration of the observed LMC microlensing events is significantly narrower than what is expected from the standard halo model. In this article we make the same comparison, using non-standard halo models and considering the contribution of non-halo components of the Milky Way such as the disc, spheroid and LMC itself in the microlensing events. Comparing the theoretical and experimental widths of distributions of the duration of events shows that neither standard nor non-standard halo models are compatible with the microlensing data at least with 95 per cent of confidence. This results <b>maybe</b> explained <b>if</b> (<b>i)</b> the MACHOs in the Galactic halo reside in clumpy structures or (ii) the durations of events have been underestimated due to the blending effect.

Gosh darling, the time is going so slow. I guess it’s because I don’t do anything all day around here. It seems like I haven’t seen you in weeks. And it’s only been four days. Honey, I think I’ll go nuts for the next 14. I miss you more now than I ever did while I was at Spence. Next weekend I’m going to try to get off if possible. I’m going to speak to the C. O.

That’s the only thing I can think of honey, since there is no possible way for you to reach me here. So <b>if</b> <b>I</b> can make it I’ll telegraph you Thursday.
