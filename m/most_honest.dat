5|$|Before, Beyoncé's {{approach}} to heartbreak was always literal, {{her voice and}} her words declaiming her feelings with a studied earnestness that at times was difficult to believe, let alone connect with. 'Irreplaceable' is the first song in which Beyoncé lies to herself, and the way her voice perfectly betrays that lie (revealing a giveaway tremble in the stiff upper lip of the lyrics) simultaneously renders it her most sophisticated and her <b>most</b> <b>honest</b> performance to date.|$|E

25|$|The Caterham is {{the purest}} and <b>most</b> <b>honest</b> street car I've ever driven. Period. No power steering. No power brakes. No drive-by-wire. Just a direct {{connection}} {{between you and the}} contact patch. The responses to steering, throttle, brake, and gearshift inputs are so nearly instantaneous that they verge on the telepathic. And I can see exactly what's happening, at least at {{the front end of the}} car, as the wheels turn and judder.|$|E

The arena is located at Mohegan Sun Casino in Uncasville, Connecticut. Compared to other arenas in which teams of the WNBA utilize, Mohegan Sun Arena is considerably small, with the maximum capacity (lower and upper levels) for a basketball game being 9,323. The Sun is one of few WNBA teams that plays in a venue truly suited to its product, and is often cited for boasting the <b>most</b> <b>honest</b> attendance figures in the league. The Sun is the only top-level professional franchise located in the state of Connecticut.|$|E

[...] Talking about how the album made him feel, {{he went on to}} say, [...] "I found the {{material}} from it really heavy to play– like, really oppressive. That's the only reason why I didn't like the album. The songs were great but it didn't make me happy."

500|$|The special {{was written}} {{with the goal}} of [...] "telling the story in the <b>most</b> <b>honest</b> and sincere way." [...] The writers {{attempted}} to continue the tense and unpleasant relationship between Frankie and Mr. Herriman, which they had begun developing since the series began, but approaching it in a believable and sensible fashion. With the heavy plot running through the special, the writers tried to use Bloo and his companions as a means to add humor into it. They wrote Bloo to be more obnoxious and demanding than previously, but did not want him to be cruel or malicious.|$|E

500|$|Johnson's authors became {{increasingly}} frustrated with him {{towards the end}} of his life, Wakefield calling him [...] "heedless, insipid, [...] inactive" [...] and Lindsey describing him as [...] "a worthy and <b>most</b> <b>honest</b> man, but incorrigably [...] neglectful often to his own detriment". Priestley, by then in Pennsylvania, eventually broke off his forty-year relationship with the publisher, when his book orders were delayed several years and Johnson failed to communicate with him regarding the publication of his works. Most of the authors who became upset with Johnson were those writing religious or literary works, the riskiest publishing ventures.|$|E

40|$|Consider Law, Life and Literature. Which of {{the three}} is the <b>most</b> real, <b>honest,</b> and inclusive? Many would answer the law because it takes into {{consideration}} {{all of the facts}} and circumstances to formulate a clear and consistent rule, and literature is the most unreal, the most fictional {{of the three}}. However, that is not accurate. Of the three, literature is actually the <b>most</b> real, <b>honest,</b> and inclusive. It is real because, with brutal honesty, it deals with all of our realities. It is more honest than life, for often in our outer (and even inner) lives we are afraid to tell the plain truth. Literature is more real than the law, for often our laws ignore the realities and truths for many of us. In this article, I use literature and life to explore the impact, especially on black women, of divorce laws and the movement toward fault...|$|R
50|$|Tolstoy next {{states that}} the <b>most</b> intellectually <b>honest</b> {{response}} to the situation would be suicide. In {{the face of the}} inevitability of death and assuming that God does not exist, why wait? Why pretend that this vale of tears means anything when one can just cut to the chase? For himself, however, Tolstoy admits he is too cowardly to follow through on the most logically consistent response.|$|R

Her children were taken away while she received treatment for AIDS and for mental health issues. Carey wrote a song titled [...] "Petals," [...] which she describes as the <b>most</b> <b>honest</b> lyrics she has ever written.

500|$|Liddell's {{claims have}} had a far more {{critical}} reception from scholars specialising in magic and witchcraft in British history. In 1975, Eric Maple dismissed Lugh's claims as preposterous. He believed that such tales had been fabricated by someone who had used his own book, The Dark World of Witches, as a basis. Maple informed the historian James W. Baker that he believed people connected to Valiente were behind the Lugh claims, although Baker disagreed, commenting that Valiente was [...] "one of the <b>most</b> <b>honest</b> of commentators on the subject" [...] of contemporary witchcraft, and {{that as a result}} was unlikely to be involved in such duplicity. Baker described Liddell's account as [...] "an extravagant hoax", with its claims constituting [...] "a preposterous ahistorical muddle".|$|E

40|$|Does {{everybody}} lie? A dominant {{view is that}} lying is part {{of everyday}} social interaction. Recent research, however, has claimed, that robust individual differences exist, with most people reporting {{that they do not}} lie, and only a small minority reporting very frequent lying. In this study, we found most people to subjectively report little or no lying. Importantly, we found self-reports of frequent lying to positively correlate with real-life cheating and psychopathic tendencies. Our findings question whether lying is normative and common among most people, and instead suggest that <b>most</b> people are <b>honest</b> <b>most</b> of the time and that a small minority lies frequently...|$|R
500|$|Voorhis was {{generally}} highly regarded by his colleagues {{and others in}} Washington. Senator Paul Douglas of Illinois considered Voorhis [...] "a political saint", and said of Voorhis that [...] "riven by conscience, he had a compulsion to master every subject that came before the House, and having mastered it, he spoke his mind." [...] Voorhis would make five-minute speeches in the House of Representatives at any opportunity, on matters ranging from local concerns in his district to international monetary issues. The press nicknamed him [...] "Kid Atlas", seeming to carry {{the weight of the}} world on his shoulders. The press corps also voted him the <b>most</b> <b>honest</b> congressman, and the fifth most intelligent. However, Interior Secretary Harold Ickes described Voorhis's 1943 resignation from HUAC as the representative being [...] "obbly as usual".|$|E
500|$|Cagney secured {{his first}} {{significant}} nondancing role in 1925. He played a young tough {{guy in the}} three-act play Outside Looking In by Maxwell Anderson, earning $200 a week. As with Pitter Patter, Cagney went to the audition with little confidence he would get the part. He had no experience with drama at this point. Cagney felt that he only got the role because his hair was redder than that of Alan Bunce, the only other red-headed performer in New York. Both the play and Cagney received good reviews; Life magazine wrote, [...] "Mr. Cagney, in a less spectacular role [...] makes a few minutes silence during his mock-trial scene something that many a more established actor might watch with profit." [...] Burns Mantle wrote that it [...] "...contained the <b>most</b> <b>honest</b> acting now {{to be seen in}} New York." ...|$|E
500|$|Ford {{remained}} relatively {{active in the}} years after his presidency. He continued to make appearances at events of historical and ceremonial significance to the nation, such as presidential inaugurals and memorial services. In January 1977, he became the president of Eisenhower Fellowships in Philadelphia, then served as the chairman of its board of trustees from 1980 to 1986. Later in 1977, he reluctantly agreed to be interviewed by James M. Naughton, a New York Times journalist who was given the assignment to write the former President's advance obituary, an article that would be updated prior to its eventual publication. In 1979, Ford published his autobiography, A Time to Heal (Harper/Reader's Digest, 454 pages). A review in Foreign Affairs described it as, [...] "Serene, unruffled, unpretentious, like the author. This is the shortest and <b>most</b> <b>honest</b> of recent presidential memoirs, but there are no surprises, no deep probings of motives or events. No more here than meets the eye." ...|$|E
