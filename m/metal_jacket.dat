5|$|All of the high-penetrating (armor-piercing) and hollow-point {{ammunition}} {{is classified}} as category A (see above). The alternative to a hollow point ammunition was Federal EFMJ, which has been classified into the arms group A in mid 2009, effectively outlawing it. Therefore, only full <b>metal</b> <b>jacket</b> or soft-nosed semi-jacketed rounds and or just unjacketed bullets (lead only) are allowed. Generally, no ammunition with higher wounding potential is allowed.|$|E
5|$|The SS90 was {{an early}} {{prototype}} round used only in the earliest examples of the P90. It used a lightweight 1.5-g (23grain) full <b>metal</b> <b>jacket</b> bullet with a polymer core, which it propelled at a muzzle velocity of roughly 850m/s (2,800ft/s). The SS90 was abandoned in 1994 {{in favor of the}} heavier and shorter 2.7 mm (0.11in) SS190 projectile.|$|E

The AE5728A casings are of FN manufacture, and the muzzle velocity is slightly lower than that of the SS197SR.|$|E

5|$|Co-writer Theroux {{revealed}} that the initial script concept was to have actors go to a mock boot camp and return with posttraumatic stress disorder.

Theroux pointed out that since viewers had an increased awareness of {{the inner workings of}} Hollywood due to celebrity websites and Hollywood news sources, the script was easier to write.

5|$|The pre-credits {{sequence}} used {{a church}} in Stoke Poges as a cemetery, while the helicopter scenes were filmed at the abandoned Beckton Gas Works in London. The gas works were also the location for some of Stanley Kubrick's 1987 film, Full <b>Metal</b> <b>Jacket.</b> Director John Glen {{got the idea for}} the remote-controlled helicopter after seeing a child playing with an RC car. Since flying a helicopter through a warehouse was thought to be too dangerous, the scene was shot using forced perspective. A smaller mock-up was built by Derek Meddings' team closer to the camera that the stunt pilot Marc Wolff flew behind and this made it seem as if the helicopter was entering the warehouse. The footage inside the building was shot on location, though with a life-sized helicopter model which stood over a rail. Stuntman Martin Grace stood as Bond when the agent is dangling outside the flying helicopter, while Roger Moore himself was used in the scenes inside the model.|$|E

25|$|Full <b>Metal</b> <b>Jacket</b> is a 1987 British-American war film {{directed}} and produced by Stanley Kubrick. The screenplay by Kubrick, Michael Herr, and Gustav Hasford {{was based on}} Hasford's novel The Short-Timers (1979). Its storyline follows a platoon of U.S. Marines through their training, primarily focusing on two privates, Joker and Pyle, who struggle to get through camp under their foul-mouthed drill instructor, Gunnery Sergeant Hartman, and the experiences {{of two of the}} platoon's Marines in the Tet Offensive during the Vietnam War.

5000|$|The director, {{along with}} {{principal}} costume designer Anu Vardhan, {{started working on}} the project two years before they started the actual shooting of the film. Though Anu agrees {{that there was no}} concept of wearing vests during that era, certain cinematic liberties have been taken because Shahrukh did not wanted to shoot shirtless throughout the film. [...] "After all, it is a mainstream commercial film. During Shah Rukh's forest sequences, he wears square pieces of a blanket-like-material, folded into two and cut in between, to pass around the neck. Another piece of cloth was tried around his waist, acting as a belt. There was no stitching involved." [...] Anu explains [...] "While researching for the film, we discovered that Body Art was a prominent part of that time. For the character of Kaurwaki, (Kareena) we used different designs of tattoos." [...] The armours and shields worn by the artistes also form {{an important part of the}} costume for the final war sequences. <b>Metal</b> <b>jackets</b> composed of special fibre glass were made for around 4000 members of the cast. [...] "These <b>metal</b> <b>jackets</b> are extremely light and comfortable and were made in Madras by more than 50 workers," [...] she explains.|$|R

At one point the soldiers enter a building to flush out a sniper. This building {{was one of several}} located between the central buildings of the old gasworks and about 200 yards from the river Thames. The final scene sees the soldiers marching off into the (London) sunset against the silhouettes of the burning gasworks' chimneys and buildings, singing the Mickey Mouse March from the US children's TV show. In the film a period of several days takes place in the protagonist's lives as they travel through the industrial quarters of Huế city; in reality the action took place within just one square mile. According to Kubrick collaborator Leon Vitali, who worked on Full <b>Metal</b> <b>Jacket,</b> the gasworks were built by an architectural firm that also constructed much of Huế.|$|E
40|$|Evacuated panel superinsulations {{with very}} high center-of-panel thermal {{resistances}} {{are being developed}} for use in refrigerators/freezers.

Results are also presented on simulations of the energy usage of refrigerators/freezers containing stainless-steel-clad vacuum superinsulations...|$|R
