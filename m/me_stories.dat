He had already retired by the time I started but I used to get a lift to work from his wife, who still worked there. And she would tell <b>me</b> <b>stories</b> about him with the affectionate disdain of {{anyone who has been}} married for more than a year. In the staff room, all these bitter teachers who hadn't been promoted would describe him as someone who would only briefly consider stopping short of invading Poland if he got the chance. I've since found out that the real man is actually a very nice bloke.|$|E

There are rape camps all over the country. Thousands of women are being raped and killed. Thousands of women are pregnant as a result of rape. Over and over again, everywhere I went in Bosnia-Herzegovina and in Croatian refugee camps, women told <b>me</b> <b>stories</b> of abomination – of being kept in a room, raped repeatedly and told they would be held until they gave birth to Serbian children." ...|$|E
2500|$|After the incident, Chakraverti {{started to}} {{administer}} the Wiccan way of healing and held sessions at her home. She used to advocate different ways of healing the mind and counsel people on their day to day problems suggest solutions for them. Chakraverti used the curative powers of crystals [...] for curing people of backache, pains and spinal injuries. She also started investigating and bringing to light the plight of women in rural Bengal where many were tortured after being labeled as witches. Chakraverti travelled to such villages in Purulia, Bankura, Birbhum and documented such crimes, sometimes teaching women who were emotionally or physically battered by men to recognize and unleash the power within themselves. [...] "Wicca can do that through their empowerment of the goddesses. [...] The village women—simple women accused of witchcraft—would give <b>me</b> <b>stories</b> which were really heartbreaking. It {{opened my eyes to}} how much venom there was in these men. [...] I have tried [...] to bring succor to women branded ‘witches' or ‘dayans' who are still today being molested and killed for what they are believed to practice. I have brought their cases before the authorities and the press in an attempt to show up the hypocrisy of their persecutors– mostly men– who are trying to denigrate this ancient branch of learning in order to wreak revenge on these women for some very personal motives." ...|$|E
