5|$|According to a MinnPost poll, Minnesotans {{blamed the}} Republican {{legislature}} {{more for the}} shutdown. Overall, 42% said Republicans in the legislature were <b>more</b> <b>responsible,</b> 21% said the DFL governor was <b>more</b> <b>responsible,</b> and 22% volunteered an answer that they were equally to blame. As expected, partisans blamed the other party more; only 10% of Republicans blamed the legislature more, and only 2% of DFLers blamed Dayton more. Following the shutdown, DFL Representative Phyllis Kahn authored a continuing appropriations bill that would prevent government shutdowns {{in the event of}} disagreements between the governor and legislature, as she had done in several past sessions. The House commissioned a policy brief from its research department, published in December 2011, that looked into what such a bill would require. The brief noted that such ideas had been considered before, including after the 2005 shutdown, and had been abandoned.|$|E

40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the relationship between}} the between-firm and within-firm values of corporate social responsibility and corporate financial performance over time. The between-firm value of corporate social responsibility refers to a firm 2 ̆ 7 s competitive advantage generated from being <b>more</b> socially <b>responsible</b> than other firms, while the within-firm value of corporate social responsibility refers to a firm 2 ̆ 7 s competitive advantage that stems from becoming internally <b>more</b> socially <b>responsible.</b> This study also investigates the moderating effects of advertising and firm reputation on the relationship. This study hypothesizes that both the between-firm and within-firm values of corporate social responsibility impact corporate financial performance. In addition, this study hypothesizes that bundling resources such as advertising and firm reputation enables firms to maximize the value of corporate social responsibility and, consequently, its impact on corporate financial performance. ^ The findings confirm the validity of the positive effect of corporate social responsibility on corporate financial performance. The between-firm effect of corporate social responsibility was found to significantly affect firm performance over time, and the within-firm effect of corporate social responsibility also significantly affects firm performance over time. Stated differently, both being <b>more</b> socially <b>responsible</b> than others and being <b>more</b> socially <b>responsible</b> than usual tend to pay off financially. This study found no significant moderating effects of advertising and reputation of the firm on the relationship between corporate social responsibility and corporate financial performance over time. In other words, being <b>more</b> socially <b>responsible</b> than others and being <b>more</b> socially <b>responsible</b> than usual affect firm performance over time regardless of advertising and firm reputation. ^ The findings of follow-up analyses showed the marginally significant and positive effect of firm reputation on {{the relationship between the}} within-firm corporate social responsibility and firm performance for top 25...|$|R
5|$|The {{operation}} commenced {{during a}} NATO bombing {{campaign against the}} VRS, codenamed Operation Deliberate Force, which targeted Bosnian Serb air defences, artillery and storage facilities initially {{in the area of}} Sarajevo, but also elsewhere in the country. Operation Sana, alongside concurrent HV and HVO offensives, sparked debate among military analysts as to whether the ground assaults or NATO's airstrikes were <b>more</b> <b>responsible</b> for ending the Bosnian War. Also in question was to what extent the advances of the ARBiH, HVO and HV were assisted by the airstrikes, and conversely, to what extent they hampered the VRS.|$|E
5|$|During the 2010–11 season, Bieksa's {{offensive}} production decreased, {{but he was}} lauded by {{the media}} and Head Coach Alain Vigneault for improving his defensive game. He had been criticized at times in the past for making risk/reward plays that resulted in scoring chances for the opposing team, but his play improved to become <b>more</b> <b>responsible</b> in the defensive zone. In February 2011, he suffered a 2nd fractured bone in his foot. Playing in a game against the Minnesota Wild, Bieksa sustained the injury while blocking a shot. While he finished the game and initial x-rays came back negative, a subsequent CT-scan revealed the fracture. He became the sixth Canucks defenceman injured at the time. After missing 15 games, he returned to the line-up in late-March. Playing on a shutdown defensive pairing with Dan Hamhuis, his season-ending +32 plus-minus established a personal best and ranked second in the NHL, one point behind Boston Bruins defenceman Zdeno Chára. Complementing his strong defensive play, he recorded six goals and 22 points in 66 games.|$|E
5|$|Ramram hoped his {{son would}} {{follow in his}} profession, but Ramprasad showed no {{interest}} in practical pursuits. As he grew up, his spiritual inclinations caused {{a great deal of}} anxiety to his parents. Believing that marriage would make Ramprasad <b>more</b> <b>responsible,</b> his parents married him to a girl named Sarvani when he was twenty-two years old. In keeping with the family custom, the newly wed couple was initiated by the family's spiritual teacher, Madhavacharya. According to traditional accounts, during initiation when the guru whispered the mantra to him, Ramprasad became consumed by intense longing for the goddess Kali. One year after the initiation he lost his guru. Ramprasad later became the disciple of Krishnananda Agamavagisha, a Tantric yogi and scholar. Agamavagisha was a well known devotee of Kali {{and the author of the}} Bengali book Tantrasara. Agamavagisha instructed Ramprasad in Tantric sadhanas (spiritual disciplines) and worship of Kali.|$|E

25|$|Summarizing the {{findings}} from these studies, heterosexual men {{seem to be more}} distressed by sexual infidelity than heterosexual women, lesbian women, and gay men (Leeker, 2014). These latter three groups seem <b>more</b> <b>responsible</b> for this difference by reporting similarly higher levels of distress toward emotional infidelity than heterosexual men (Leeker, 2014). However, as previously noted, within-sex analyses reveal that heterosexual men tend to rate emotional infidelity as more distressing than sexual infidelity (Vitelli, 2014).|$|E
25|$|There are {{at least}} two {{different}} types of progenitors (sources) of GRBs: one responsible for the long-duration, soft-spectrum bursts and one (or possibly <b>more)</b> <b>responsible</b> for short-duration, hard-spectrum bursts. The progenitors of long GRBs are believed to be massive, low-metallicity stars exploding due to the collapse of their cores. The progenitors of short GRBs are thought to arise from mergers of compact binary systems like neutron stars, which was confirmed by the GW170817 observation of a neutron star merger and a kilonova.|$|E

25|$|Prostaglandin (PGD2) is {{the primary}} cause of the {{flushing}} reaction, with serotonin appearing to have a secondary role in this reaction. The effect is mediated by prostaglandin E2 and D2 due to GPR109A activation of epidermal Langerhans cells and keratinocytes. Langerhans cells use cyclooxygenase type 1 (COX-1) for PGE2 production and are <b>more</b> <b>responsible</b> for acute flushing, while keratinocytes are COX-2 dependent and are in active continued vasodilation. Flushing was often thought to involve histamine, but histamine has been shown not {{to be involved in the}} reaction.|$|E

The story follows four generations of an Irish landholding family, the Rackrents. It is narrated by an Irish catholic worker on the estate, named Thady Quirk, and portrayed {{the rise of the}} catholic-Irish middle class.|$|E
25|$|Roach (1980) {{presents}} a sociological-psychological {{assessment of the}} relationship between Will and his father during the formative boyhood and teenage years. Clement had high expectations for his son and wanted him to be <b>more</b> <b>responsible</b> and business-minded. Will was more easygoing and oriented toward the loving affection offered by his mother, Mary, rather than the harshness of his father. The personality clash increased after his mother's death when the boy was 11. Young Will went from one venture to another with little success. Only after Will won acclaim in vaudeville did the rift begin to heal. Clement's death in 1911 precluded a full reconciliation.|$|E

25|$|In {{contemporary}} society, rural families {{no longer}} own land or pass {{it down to}} the next generation. They may, however, own and transmit houses. Rural families pay medical expenses and school fees for their children. Under the people's commune system in force from 1958 to 1982, the income of a peasant family depended directly on the number of laborers it contributed to the collective fields. This, combined with concern over the level of support for the aged or disabled provided by the collective unit, encouraged peasants to have many sons. Under the agricultural reforms that began in the late 1970s, households took on an increased and <b>more</b> <b>responsible</b> economic role. The labor of family members is still the primary determinant of income. But rural economic growth and commercialization increasingly have rewarded managerial and technical skills and have made unskilled farm labor less desirable. As long as this economic trend continues in the countryside in the late 1980s, peasant families are likely to opt for fewer but better educated children.|$|E
