40|$|One-potâ€™ tandem {{reactions}} of commercially available 1, 4 -dithiane- 2, 5 -diol (the dimer of <b>mercaptoacetaldehyde)</b> with electrophilic alkenes {{resulted in the}} facile formation of substituted tetrahydrothiophene derivatives. Thus, sulfa-Michael/Henry and sulfa-Michael/aldol sequences provided polysubstituted tetrahydrothiophenes using in situ generated nitroalkenes and alpha,beta-unsaturated carbonyl compounds as the electrophilic partners of <b>mercaptoacetaldehyde</b> dimer, respectively...|$|E
40|$|In situ {{generated}} nitro alkenes underwent tandem Michael-Henry and Michael-Michael sequences {{leading to}} the 'one-pot' formation of 3, 4 -substituted tetrahydrothiophenes using the commercially available 1, 4 -dithiane- 2, 5 -diol (the dimer of <b>mercaptoacetaldehyde)</b> or its 4 -mercapto- 2 -butenoates derivatives as suitable bifunctional partners, respectively...|$|E
40|$|Organocatalytic {{asymmetric}} domino sulfa-Michael/aldol condensation reactions between 1, 4 -dithiane- 2, 5 -diol (the dimer of <b>mercaptoacetaldehyde)</b> and cinnamaldehydes were efficiently {{promoted by}} (S) -diphenylprolinol TMS ether {{in the presence}} of bile acid derivatives, leading to hitherto unknown 4, 5 -dihydrothiophene- 2 -carbaldehydes in moderate to good yields and good enantioselectivitie...|$|E
40|$|A novel {{synthesis}} for thiosugars {{starting from}} achiral compounds by using enzymes as catalysts is described. 5 -Thio-D-threo- 2 -pentulofuranose (4), for example, is prepared {{either by the}} RAMA (rabbit muscle aldolase) -catalyzed reaction of <b>mercaptoacetaldehyde</b> (1 b) with dihydroxyacetonephosphate (2) or by the yeast transketolase-catalyzed reaction of 2 -hydroxy- 3 -mercaptopanal (R/S) - 6 with lithium 3 -hydroxypyruvate (9). 6 -Thio-D-arabino- 2 -hexulopyranose (8 a) and 6 -thio-L-xylo- 2 -hexulopyranose (8 b) are obtained by the RAMA-catalyzed reaction of racemic (R/S) - 6 with 2...|$|E
