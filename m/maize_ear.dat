40|$|International audienceCorn variety {{testing is}} a process to pick and {{cultivate}} a high yield, disease resistant and outstandingly adaptive variety from thousands of corn hybrid varieties. In this process, {{we have to do}} a large number of comparative tests, observation and measurement. The workload of this measurement is very huge, for the large number of varieties under test. The grain numbers of <b>maize</b> <b>ear</b> is an important parameter to the corn variety testing. At present, the grain counting is mostly done by manpower. In this way, both the deviation and workload is unacceptable. In this paper, an automatic counting method of <b>maize</b> <b>ear</b> grain is established basing on image processing. Image segmentation is the basis and classic difficult part of image processing. This paper presents an image pre-processing method, which is based on the characteristics of <b>maize</b> <b>ear</b> image. This method includes median filter to eliminate random noise, wallis filter to sharpen the image boundary and histogram enhancement. It also mainly introduces an in-depth study of Otsu algorithms. To overcome the problems of Otsu algorithm that background information being erroneously divided when object size is small. A new method based on traditional Otsu method is proposed, which combines the multi-threshold segmentation and RBGM gradient descent. The implementation of RBGM gradient descent leads to a remarkable improvement on the efficiency of multi-threshold segmentation which is generally an extremely time-consuming task. Our experimental evaluations on 25 sets of <b>maize</b> <b>ear</b> image datasets show that the proposed method can produce more competitive results on effectiveness and speed in comparison to the manpower.

40|$|Along with barley and rice, maize {{provides}} {{staple food}} {{for more than}} half of the world population. <b>Maize</b> <b>ears</b> are regularly infected with fungal pathogens of the Fusarium genus, which, besides reducing yield, also taint grains with toxic metabolites. In an earlier work, we have shown that <b>maize</b> <b>ears</b> infection with single Fusarium strains was detectable through volatile sensing. In nature, infection most commonly occurs with more than a single fungal strain; hence we tested how the interactions of two strains would modulate volatile emission from infected ears. For this purpose, ears of a hybrid and a dwarf maize variety were simultaneously infected with different strains of F. graminearums and F. verticillioides and, the resulting volatile profiles were compared to the ones of ears infected with single strains. Disease severity, fungal biomass and the concentration of an oxylipin 9 -hydroxy octadecadienoic acid, a signaling molecule involved in plant defense, were monitored and correlated to volatile profiles. Our results demonstrate that in simultaneous infections of hybrid and dwarf maize, the most competitive fungal strains had the largest influence on the volatile profile of infected ears. In both concurrent and single inoculations, volatile profiles reflected disease severity. Additionally, the data further indicate that dwarf maize and hybrid maize might emit common (i. e. sesquiterpenoids) and specific markers upon fungal infection. Overall this suggests that volatile profiles might be a good proxy for disease severity regardless of the fungal competition taking place in <b>maize</b> <b>ears.</b> With the appropriate sensitivity and reliability, volatile sensing thus appears as a promising tool for detecting fungal infection of <b>maize</b> <b>ears</b> under field conditions...|$|R

40|$|Full list {{of author}} {{information}} {{is available at the}} end of the articleBackground Maize is one of the most productive crops worldwide, and is widely used as a model plant in genetics research [1]. Maize produces two distinct inflorescences, commonly re-ferred to as the tassel and the ear. In this respect, it differs from other grasses such as rice and wheat. The tassel arises from the apex of the mature plant, while ears originate from axillary bud apices [2]. One obvious difference in morphology between the two inflorescences is the pres-ence (tassel) or absence (ear) of a variable number of long branches originating at the base. In previous studies, the wide range of natural variation among different inbred lines was used to identify quantitative trait loci (QTL) un-derlying a variety of phenotypes by association mapping [3, 4].

Toxin and fungal biomass were assessed on mature kernels, using HPLC and quantitative PCR. Correlation between the levels of DNA and toxin was high concerning F. graminearum DNA and deoxynivalenol (R² = 0 · 73) and moderate for F. verticillioides DNA and fumonisin (R² = 0 · 44). Fusarium graminearum DNA either decreased in mixed inoculations or was not influenced by subsequent inoculations with F. verticillioides, compared to single inoculations. In contrast, F. verticillioides DNA either significantly increased or was not affected in mixed and sequential inoculations. In two of the replicates, it can be assumed that natural contamination by F. verticillioides was favoured by previous contamination with F. graminearum.

Fusarium verticillioides, F. graminearum, and F. proliferatum were the predominant species infecting maize kernels in 2006, whereas in 2007 the most frequently isolated species were F. graminearum, F. cerealis and F. subglutinans. Fourteen Fusariumrelated mycotoxins were detected as contaminants of maize kernels analyzed by a multi-mycotoxin determination method. In 2006, a growth season characterized by high temperature and low rainfall during anthesis and early grain filling, 75 % of the maize samples were contaminated with deoxynivalenol, 34 % with fumonisins and 27 % with zearalenone. In 2007, characterized by moderate temperatures and frequent rainfall during the entire growth season, none of the 40 maize samples had quantifiable levels of fumonisins while deoxynivalenol and zearalenone were detected in 90 % and 93 % of the fields, respectively.

Bundles of dried maize stalks are often displayed often along with pumpkins, gourds and straw in autumnal displays outside homes and businesses. A well-known example of architectural use is the Corn Palace in Mitchell, South Dakota, which uses cobs and <b>ears</b> of colored <b>maize</b> to implement a mural design that is recycled annually. Another well known example is the Field of Corn in Dublin, Ohio, where a hundreds on concrete ears of corn lay in a grassy field.|$|R

Fusarium verticillioides is the fungus most {{commonly associated with}} <b>maize</b> <b>ears</b> and elevated levels fumonisins are frequently found. Genetic resistance {{would be the best}} preventive action against fumonisins, although no commercial maize hybrids seem to be completely resistant at present. Significant progress regarding Fusarium ear rot resistance can be obtained in the hybrids introducing broad sources of resistance to ear rot into susceptible elite inbred lines. The resistant genotypes hold defense-related genes that are transcribed at high levels before infection and provide basic defense to the fungus. But, the cropping system plays a significant role on fumonisin levels. The effect of preceding crop, tillage, maturity class of hybrids, nitrogen fertilization, sowing and harvest data, and grain moisture on the level of fumonisin contamination will be discussed...|$|R
