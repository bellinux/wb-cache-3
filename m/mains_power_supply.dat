25|$|On March 15, 2015, a fire engulfed the convent's tallest bell tower, which pinnacles at {{height of}} 72 meters. The monastery had been {{undergoing}} major repair work and {{was covered in}} scaffolding. It took firefighters almost three hours {{to put out the}} fire. The blaze reportedly affected an area of three hundred square metres, but it was restricted to the scaffolding and didn't do any damage to the historical building itself. The speculated cause of the fire was a short circuit caused by heat guns used for drying the facade. The press service for the Moscow cultural heritage department has blamed the fire on the firm doing the restoration work. However, Russian Deputy Culture Minister Grigory Pirumov said that heat guns were not in use on the territory of the convent and the bell tower had been disconnected from the <b>mains</b> <b>power</b> <b>supply.</b>|$|E

40|$|Poverty {{reduction}} {{is a primary}} goal of development policy. In {{large parts of the}} World people have to live on meagre incomes and have limited access to infrastructure services, such as mains water, safe sanitation, <b>mains</b> <b>power</b> <b>supplies,</b> maintained roads and telephones. In response, more and more infrastructure provision has been opened up to private investment {{over the last two decades}} and regulatory institutions have been introduced to protect the public interest in the absence of state ownership. In this paper the role of infrastructure regulation in poverty {{reduction is}} investigated drawing on the published evidence. The conclusion is that the evidence is both patchy and sometimes contradictory. There is mixed knowledge regarding the extent to which regulators address poverty issues and about the results of regulatory decisions. The paper concludes by proposing a future research agenda aimed at improving our understanding of the ways in which infrastructure regulation impacts on poverty, with the objective of improving actual regulatory policy in developing economies. ...|$|R
50|$|Both the 2/2nd and the 2/6th Hospitals {{employed}} a similar layout and were constructed using similar materials. The two hospitals consisted of 40 wards, offices, stores and other auxiliary buildings. The wards {{were laid out}} in pairs, with a service annexe in between. Most were constructed with canvas, and measures 60 feet x 20 feet. Early wards had earth floors, watered daily to make them firm, and a rattan carpet down the middle isle. Other buildings were constructed from timber and iron. Later wards were set on a concrete slab and had a capacity of approximately 50 patients. By March 1944 both hospitals had been transformed from tent to hut hospitals and the bed capacity had increased to 1400, however, by September 1944 the daily bed average had increased to 1760. The buildings still had canvas walls but the floors were concrete and each ward had its own amenities, such as a wood stove, kerosene refrigerator, a permanent toilet and an office and dressing room.

50|$|Audio {{frequency}} chokes (AFC) {{usually have}} ferromagnetic cores {{to increase their}} inductance. They are often constructed similarly to transformers, with laminated iron cores and an air gap. A major use in the past was in power rectifiers and direct current motor controllers to produce direct current (DC), where they were {{used in conjunction with}} large electrolytic capacitors to remove the voltage ripple (AC) at the output DC. A rectifier circuit designed for a choke-output filter may produce too much DC output voltage and subject the rectifier and filter capacitors to excessive in-rush and ripple currents if the inductor is removed. However, modern electrolytic capacitors with high ripple current ratings, and voltage regulators that remove more <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> ripple than chokes could, have eliminated heavy, bulky chokes from <b>mains</b> frequency <b>power</b> <b>supplies.</b> Smaller chokes are used in switching <b>power</b> <b>supplies</b> to remove the higher-frequency switching transients from the output and sometimes from feeding back into the mains input. They often have toroidal ferrite cores.|$|R
40|$|Abstract:- For {{low power}} wind energy or micro-hydel {{applications}} {{of the order of}} 1 - 10 KW, the lowest cost can be achieved if the generator is a simple squirrel cage induction motor used as a self excited induction generator (SEIG).

A SEIG requires capacitors to be connected to the three terminals to provide reactive power as it is not directly connected to the <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> grid. The aim of the paper is to check the feasibility of wind power generation with a 2 KW squirrel cage induction motor used as a generator.

40|$|We {{consider}} {{resource allocation}} over a wireless downlink where Base Station (BS) power consumption is minimized while upholding {{a set of}} required link rates. A Power and Resource Allocation Including Sleep (PRAIS) method is proposed that combines resource sharing, Power Control (PC), and Discontinuous Transmission (DTX), such that downlink power consumption is minimized, which can be formed into a convex optimization problem. Unlike conventional approaches that aim at minimizing transmit power, in this work the BS <b>mains</b> <b>supply</b> <b>power</b> is chosen as the relevant metric. Based on a linear power model, which maps a certain transmit power to the necessary <b>mains</b> <b>supply</b> <b>power,</b> we quantify the fundamental limits of PRAIS in terms of achievable BS power savings. The fundamental limits are numerically evaluated on link level for four sets of BS power model parameters representative of envisaged future hardware developments. We establish an expected lower limit for PRAIS of 27 W to 68 W depending on load per link for BSs installed in 2014, which provides a 61 % to 34 % gain over conventional resource allocation schemes.

40|$|Wireless sensor {{networks}} {{represent a}} new technology that has emerged from developments in ultra low power microcontrollers and sophisticated low cost wireless data devices. Their small size and power consumption allow a number of independent ‘nodes’ (known as Motes) to be distributed in the field, all capable of ad-hoc networking and multihop message transmission. New routing algorithms allow remote data to be passed reliably through the network to a final control point. This occurs within the constraints of low power RF transmissions in a congested 2. 4 GHz radio spectrum. Wireless sensor network nodes are suitable for applications requiring long term autonomous operation, away from <b>mains</b> <b>power</b> <b>supplies,</b> such as environmental or health monitoring. To achieve this, sophisticated power management techniques must be used, with the units remaining ‘asleep’ in ultra low power mode {{for long periods of}} time. The main aim of this research described in this thesis is first to review the area and then to evaluate one of the current hardware platforms and the popular software used with it called TinyOS. Therefore this research uses a hardware platform designed from University of Berkeley, called the TmoteSky. Practical work has been carried out in different scenarios. Using Java tools running on a PC, and customized applications running on the Motes, data has been captured, together with information showing topology configuration and adaptive routing of the network and radio link quality information. Results show that the technology is promising for distributed data acquisition applications, although in time critical monitoring systems new power management schemes and networking protocols to improve latency in the system will be required...|$|R

50|$|There was a {{variation}} of the third-generation Sovereign called the RP75 Super Sovereign. This took the basic RP72 Sovereign and added two short wave bands - the only Hacker set to include both FM and SW. Coverage was 10.9 to 33 metres and 27.5 to 89 metres. Electronic fine-tuning (band-spread) was provided, and switchable ISM returned to the FM band; separate switches are provided for ISM and AFC, unlike the Sovereign II where these functions were combined on one switch.
