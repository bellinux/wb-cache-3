50|$|Fandango on core is a {{computer}} programming term {{for the effects of}} a pointer running out of bounds, often leading to a core dump, or failures in other seemingly unrelated processes. In extreme situations, fandango on core may lead to the overwriting of operating system code, possibly causing data loss or system crashes.

50|$|The {{survival}} processing advantage {{has been}} shown to increase both true and false memory in adults and children. True memory refers to the correct retention of information. False <b>memory</b> <b>means</b> remembering something that was never present. A false memory is not necessarily maladaptive. Misremembering can have advantages in certain situations (for example, misremembering an environment with predator tracks as the actual presence of a predator may lead to avoidance of that area in the future). False memory {{can be seen as a}} side-effect to an otherwise highly adaptive process.|$|E
50|$|Memory and the {{formation}} of identity is not a homogenous process where one memory forms one identity and another memory forms another identity, exclusively. Instead the heterogeneity of <b>memory</b> <b>means</b> various memories operate and interact in an inexhaustible manner over time which then shape how we come to see ourselves and our experiences in the world as well as our understanding of worldwide issues. Memory should not therefore ideally be a zero-sum game with struggles ensuing over scarce resources as proponents of competitive memory would suggest. The individual as well as the collective memory and relations to the past can exist without one being more important than the other. The “embodied and lived side of our relations to the past” can share space with the “social and constructed side of our relations to the past”. Therefore, in contrast to competitive memory, multidirectional memory is “subject to ongoing negotiation, cross-referencing, and borrowing; as productive and not privative”.|$|E

Children, however, focus on physical aspects of environments and what can be performed in various environments, which {{can be seen in the}} popularity of “pretend” and imagination games among children. Consequently, childhood memories of places are typically oriented around heavily emotional, intense, or euphoric events.|$|R

5000|$|The {{amount of}} early {{childhood}} memories a person can recall depends on many factors, including emotion associated with the event, their age {{at the time of}} the remembered event and the age at the time they are asked to recall an early memory. [...] Although people assume that not recalling a childhood <b>memory</b> <b>means</b> they have forgotten the event, there is a difference between availability and accessibility. Availability of a memory is the idea that the memory is intact and is in memory storage. Accessibility of a memory is dictated by the moment in time that a person attempts to recall that memory. Therefore, cues may influence which memories are accessible at any given time even though there may be many more available memories that are not accessed. Some other research suggests that people's earliest memories date back to the ages of 3 or 4 years. J. A. Usher and U. Neisser (1993, this issue) reported that some events, like the birth of a sibling and a planned hospitalization, can be readily remembered if they occurred at age 2. However, the bits and pieces of such memories that were obtained in their research may not be indicative of genuine episodic memory. An alternative hypothesis is that these apparent memories are the result of educated guesses, general knowledge of what must have been, or external information acquired after the age of 2 ...|$|E

The test results were transformed to z-scores for comparisonswith normative data. As a means of determining level of cognitive impairmentwithinthe group, deficit scores wereapplied. Group comparisons on the different cognitive domains were conducted between patients with depressivesymptoms and patients reporting no such symptoms. Results:As illustrated in mean z-scores, the patients demonstrated lower performance compared to normative dataon visual <b>memory</b> (<b>mean</b> -. 26, CI -. 43 to -. 09,p=. 003), speed of information processing (mean -. 22, CI -. 34 to -. 09,p=. 001), executive functions (mean -. 28, CI -. 40 to -. 16,p<. 001), and attention/vigilance (mean -. 25, CI -. 37 to -. 13,p<. 001). Their performance was good on verbal fluency (mean. 24, CI. 04 to. 44,p=. 016) and verbal memory(mean. 55, CI. 38 to. 72,p<. 001).

40|$|Background: The {{deleterious}} {{health effects}} of sedentary behaviors, independent of physical activity, are increasingly being recognized. However, associations with cognitive performance are not known. Purpose: To estimate the associations between different sedentary behaviors and cognitive performance in healthy older adults. Methods: Computer use, time spent watching television (TV), time spent reading and habitual physical activity levels were self-reported twice (in 2001 and 2007) by participants in the SUpplementation en Vitamines et MinerauX (SU. VI. MAX and SU. VI. MAX 2) study. Cognitive performance was assessed at follow-up (in 2007 - 2009) via a battery of 6 neuropsychological tests used to derive verbal memory and executive functioning scores. Analyses (ANCOVA) were performed among 1425 men and 1154 women aged 65. 6 +/- 4. 5 {{at the time of}} the neuropsychological evaluation. We estimated mean differences with 95 % confidence intervals (95 %CI) in cognitive performance across categories of each type of sedentary behavior. Results: In multivariable cross-sectional models, compared to non-users, participants using the computer for 1 h/day displayed better verbal <b>memory</b> (<b>mean</b> difference= 1. 86; 95 % CI: 0. 95, 2. 77) and executive functioning (mean difference= 2. 15; 95 %CI: 1. 22, 3. 08). A negative association was also observed between TV viewing and executive functioning. Additionally, participants who increased their computer use by more than 30 min between 2001 and 2007 showed better performance on both verbal <b>memory</b> (<b>mean</b> difference= 1. 41; 95 % CI: 0. 55, 2. 27) and executive functioning (mean difference= 1. 41; 95 % CI: 0. 53, 2. 28) compared to those who decreased their computer use during that period.

40|$|It is {{commonly}} accepted that in concentrated solutions or melts high-molecular weight polymers display randomwalk conformational properties without long-range correlations between subsequent bonds.

Presenting numerical results and theoretical arguments for both monodisperse chains and self-assembled (essentially Flory size-distributed) equilibrium polymers we demonstrate that some long-range correlations remain due to self-interactions of the chains {{caused by the}} chain connectivity and the incompressibility of the melt.
