50|$|The {{upland goose}} or <b>Magellan</b> <b>Goose</b> (Chloephaga picta) is a sheldgoose of the shelduck-sheldgoose {{subfamily}} of the Anatidae, the biological family {{that includes the}} ducks and most duck-like waterfowl such as the geese and swans. This bird is indigenous to {{the southern part of}} South America.|$|E
50|$|The park {{contains}} breeding {{populations of}} 15 {{bird of prey}} species and two others are likely reproducing here. Among them are Andean condor, black-chested buzzard-eagle, rufous-tailed hawk, cinereous harrier, chimango caracara, magellanic horned owl, austral pygmy-owl, to name but a few. Other birds occurring in the park include the Chilean flamingo, Darwin's rhea, coscoroba swan, black-necked swan, Magellanic woodpecker, <b>Magellan</b> <b>goose,</b> and black-faced ibis.|$|E
50|$|Avifauna {{includes}} {{three types of}} cauquenes (sheldgeese) namely, cauquen comun (upland goose or <b>Magellan</b> <b>goose),</b> cauquen real (ashy-headed goose) and caranca (kelp goose), found in open places and beaches. Other birds include Patagonian woodpeckers, notably the spectacular Magellanic woodpecker, maca común, common maca, heron, pato creston (crested duck), duck overo, corn duck, eagle, southern carancho, chimango. Condors are seen flying on the peaks and valleys of Tierra del Fuego. It is also home the austral parakeet, Enicognathus ferrugineus, a species of parrot.|$|E
50|$|In the {{southern}} {{portion of the}} park (Queulat mountain pass), wildlife includes mammals such as pudú, kodkod, {{and a variety of}} birds species including chucao tapaculo, Chilean pigeon, Magellanic woodpecker, black-throated huet-huet and thorn-tailed rayadito. The northern sections of the park are home to nearshore wildlife including semi-aquatic mammals as are southern river otter and coypu. Birds found in this area include <b>Magellan</b> <b>goose,</b> Chiloe wigeon, yellow-billed pintail, red shoveler, flying steamer duck, rosy-billed pochard, red-gartered coot, ringed kingfisher, great egret, cocoi heron, black-crowned night heron, torrent duck, sedge wren, Chilean flicker and black-necked swan.|$|E

Most of the species are tropical in distribution, and {{in all of them}} the pair bond seems to be permanent and potentially lifelong. Both sexes share equally in brood-rearing responsibilities, and in some species the male is known to participate in incubation as well. Unlike those of geese and swans, the downy young are distinctively patterned. Although the downy young of the white-backed duck differ somewhat from those of Dendrocygna, the species shares a sufficiently large number of behavioral and anatomical traits to be tentatively included in this tribe...|$|E

This group of 14 species has a worldwide distribution except for North America. The typical sheldgeese are grazing birds, the ecological counterparts of the true geese, while the shelducks are mostly wading and dabbling birds, frequently feeding {{to a large extent}} on aquatic invertebrates. In all of the species the adult male has an enlarged bony bulla in the syrinx, which is evidently responsible for the whistling or whistlelike sounds that are important in sexual and aggressive displays. The females of all species have more reedy and typically gooselike or ducklike notes. In all species the males are larger than the females, and often differ appreciably from them in plumage. Although pair bonds are sometimes said to be permanent in the group, in some species at least they may be ruptured through interactions with outside males, and a premium is placed on male aggressiveness during sexual competition for mates. The wings are used in fighting and in most species they are strongly patterned, with white coverts and iridescent coloration on the secondaries or their greater coverts. The downy young are also typically patterned contrastingly in the shelducks and sheldgeese, a characteristic shared with various other cavity-nesting waterfowl...|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} was {{undertaken}} to test and evaluate the various taxonomic arrangements of the family, to discover some of the trends of behavioral evolution, {{and to provide a}} basis for future workers to use in naming, describing, and evaluating the behavioral patterns observed in waterfowl. The major sexual behavior patterns of the species of Anatidae are reviewed and summarized, for the purpose of clarifying evolutionary relationships in the family, tracing the evolution of behavior patterns through various taxa, and evaluating the importance of certain behavior patterns as potential isolating mechanisms.
