The idea of lipid flow through a continuous system of <b>membranes</b> and vesicles was an alternative to the various <b>membranes</b> being independent entities that are formed from transport of free lipid components, such as fatty acids and sterols, through the cytosol. Importantly, the transport of lipids through the cytosol and lipid flow through a continuous endomembrane system are not mutually exclusive processes and both may occur in cells.|$|E

5|$|The {{lipid bilayer}} (or {{phospholipid}} bilayer) {{is a thin}} polar membrane made of two layers of lipid molecules. These <b>membranes</b> are flat sheets that form a continuous barrier around all cells. The cell <b>membranes</b> of almost all living organisms and many viruses are made of a lipid bilayer, as are the <b>membranes</b> surrounding the cell nucleus and other sub-cellular structures. The lipid bilayer is the barrier that keeps ions, proteins and other molecules where they are needed and prevents them from diffusing into areas where they should not be. Lipid bilayers are ideally suited to this role because, {{even though they are}} only a few nanometers in width, they are impermeable to most water-soluble (hydrophilic) molecules.
