40|$|This {{article has}} a {{two-fold}} purpose: first, to problematize the WTO’s official {{response to the}} crisis, particularly its insistence on trade liberalisation as the universally desirable means for stimulating growth; secondly, {{to reflect on the}} political economic assumptions underlying calls for greater flexibility to be built in the WTO system. Although the article considers the flexibility debate to be of crucial importance in thinking {{about the future of the}} multilateral trading system, it evaluates the stakes in arguing for policy autonomy or ‘developmental legal capacity’ in the context of international trade relations. In this respect, it shows that flexibility arguments share an understanding of <b>multilateral</b> trade <b>relations</b> as governed by competition. While recognising that the role of competition, as opposed to comparative advantage, is important to challenge the assumption about the universal beneficial role of trade liberalisation, the argument this article makes is that accepting competition as the sole or prevalent modality informing <b>multilateral</b> trade <b>relations</b> is problematic from both a normative and a positive perspective. By reflecting on the limitations of an approach that accepts the need ‘to prosper in conditions of global competition’ as its necessary starting point, this article emphasizes the importance of rethinking international trade relations, particularly under conditions of global recession characterised by high levels of inequality...|$|R
