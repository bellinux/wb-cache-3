To visualize clearly the boundaries of the structural components of lymphoid lobules we used the author’s modification of the impregnation of total median frozen histological sections with silver nitrate. We have established a high level of tissue differentiation of the lymph nodes, a significant development of the lymphoid parenchyma, the division of the parenchyma into lymphoid lobules, the presence in the lobules of all the main structural components that are represented by two morphotypes. The first morphotype is ribbon-like perisinusoidal cords (interfollicular zone, paracortical and medullary cords). The second morphotype is rounded lymphoid formations (central zones of deep cortex units, lymphatic nodules). Lymphoid lobules are located along the marginal sinus in one row, they are better developed and differentiated in the visceral lymph nodes. In all the lymph nodes, the lymphoid lobules have a similar histoarchitectonic, and each structural component of the lymphoid lobules has a specific architectonic of the reticular meshwork and the density of the location of the fibroblastic reticulocytes. We determined that the structures of the first morphotype which provide the migration of lymphocytes, the detection of antigens and the accumulation of plasmocytes are more developed. We have established that the relative volume of structures of the first morphotype is 4. 5 – 8. 0 times larger than the volume of the structures of the second morphotype, which provide clonal proliferation of T and B lymphocytes, especially in deep somatic lymph nodes. Among the zones of the second morphotype, predominate T-dependent zones, the relative volume of which considerably exceeds the volume of B-dependent zones (lymphoid nodules) : in the superficial somatic lymph nodes by 14 – 30 times, profound somatic by 12 – 14 times, somatovisceral by 6 – 7 times and visceral by 4. 5 – 5. 5 times. We determined that lymphatic nodules can form in different parts of compartments: in the interfollicular zone and paracortical cords of all lymph nodes and in the medullary cords of the visceral lymph nodes. The study shows that the parenchyma of the lymph nodes of newborn bull calves has a high degree of maturity, contains a full set of structural markers of immunocompetence, among which predominate the components that support lymphocyte migration, antigen detection and accumulation of plasma cells...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The {{objective}} {{of the study was}} to analyse the influence of the shape and material of the military footwear worn by soldiers on muscle activity in the lower extremities, and whether such footwear could explain specific strain complaints and traumatic lesions in the region of the lower extremities. 37 soldiers (one woman, 36 men) aged between 20 and 53 years underwent a dynamic electromyography (EMG) analysis. Wearing – one pair at a time- five different types of shoes, the subjects were asked to walk on a treadmill, where an EMG of the following muscles was taken: M. tibialis anterior, M. gastrocnemius <b>mediales,</b> M. gastrocnemius laterales, M. peroneus longus and M. rectus femoris. When the subjects wore old-fashioned outdoor jogging shoes increased muscle activity was observed in the region of the M. peroneus longus. This can be interpreted as a sign of the upper ankle joint requiring increased support and thus explain the higher susceptibility to sprains experienced in connection with these shoes. When the subjects wore combat boots, increased activity was observed in the region of the Mm. tibialis anterior and rectus femoris. The specific activity differences that were observed in particular muscles may have influence in the occurrence of certain disorders, especially in untrained recruits. This can be linked to various strain-related disorders such as shin splints and patello-femoral pain. The data obtained using EMG can provide information about the likelihood of a clustering of the complaints experienced by soldiers during training or active service...|$|R
40|$|This article {{analyzes}} {{patterns of}} structural and functional {{organization of the}} parenchyma of different groups of lymph nodes, structural features of their connective tissue frame and lymphatic sinuses. We studied superficial and deep somatic (Limphonodi mandibulares, L. cervicales superficiales, L. axillares proprii, L. poplitei), somatovisceral (L.  retropharyngei <b>mediales,</b> L. iliaci <b>mediales),</b> visceral (L. mediastinales caudales, L. jejunales) features of mature male dromedaries (Camelus dromedarius Linnaeus, 1758). We used a complex of traditional macroscopic and histological techniques, and also immunohistochemical staining of lymph node sections for identifying the features of localization of T- and B-lymphocyte populations in the parenchyma of the nodes. We found that the parenchyma of camels’ lymph nodes {{is characterized by a}} spongy type structure {{in the form of a}} complex of partly concrescent round-oval fragments of lymphoid tissue, surrounded by large lymphatic spaces (sinuses). The connective tissue frame of the lymph nodes is represented by a two-layer (connective tissue-muscular) capsule and two types of trabeculae: two-layered (connective-muscular, type I), which contain blood and lymphatic vessels, as well as lymphatic cysternas, and single-layered, formed only by a smooth muscular system (type II). Intranodal lymphatic sinuses are subdivided into subcapsular, peritrabecular and medullary sinuses. The subcapsular sinuses and sinuses related to trabeculae of type I and their branching is the most developed. At the tissue level, the lymph node parenchyma has a clearly manifested lobular structure. Lymphoid lobules in the lymph node parenchyma are positioned diffusely (mosaically) and consist of four main cellular zones: transit and cell-cell interaction (analogous to the cortical plateau), clonal proliferation of T- and, respectively, B-lymphocytes (deep cortex units, lymphatic nodules), accumulation of plasmocytes and synthesis of antibodies (brain cords). The lymphoid lobes (compartments) of the lymph nodes parenchyma are bipolar, their tops formed by the zones of transit and cell-cell interaction, and also by the zones of proliferation of B lymphocytes, and the bases by a complex of brain cords (zone of accumulation of plasmocytes and synthesis of antibodies). The zone of T-lymphocytes proliferation is in intermediate position and underlies the subunits of the parenchyma. The tops of the lymphoid lobes are located along the sinuses of the trabeculae of type I and the bases along the sinuses of the trabeculae of type II, which form the efferent lymphatic vessels. The maximum relative capacity of all studied lymph nodes was typical for zones of plasmocyte accumulation and synthesis of antibodies (19 – 27 %), the minimum capacity was typical for transit and cell-cell interaction zones (3 – 8 %). The relative capacity of zones of clonal proliferation of T- and B-lymphocytes in most lymph nodes was 1. 5 – 3. 0 times less than that of the zone of plasmocyte accumulation and antibody formation and was, respectively, 8 – 16 % and 9 – 18 %. The study showed that the structure of the lymph nodes parenchyma of dromedaries is not absolutely unique. As in other mammal species, it is subdivided into specialized cell zones which are connected in lymphoid lobules. Specific features of parenchyma structure include: diffuse (mosaic) location of lymphoid lobules; absence of signs of regulated localization of lymphoid lobules relative to the capsule and the sinus bordering the nodes...|$|R

40|$|In {{the present}} paper some macroscopical {{observations}} on red lymphonodus of goats are described it being author's aim to clarify the anatomical structure and physiological meaning of the tissues. Twentyfive goats were examined of ages ranging from foetus to 2 years old (Table. 1). The results obtained are summarized as follows : 1) The number of red lymphonodi in one body was 0 - 154, 53 being the average. However, the individual deviation {{was so great that}} the author could not discern definite relations between the number of red lymphonodi and sexes or diseases etc. (Table. 2). 2) There were tendencies to indicate that the large, deep-coloured red lymphonodi and ellipsoidal or flat forms become numerous with increase of age (Tables 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7). 3) About 94 % {{of the total number of}} the red lymphonodi detected in examined goats were under 5 mm in diameter (Table 3). 4) Localization of the red lymphonodus showed individual difference. However, it is situated usually in the aorta regions, otherwise it is found also at retropharyngei, submaxillares, cervicales craniales, cervicules <b>mediales,</b> cervicales caudales, axillares, mediastinales craniales, bifurcationis pharyngei, diaphragmaticus, mediastinales caudales, mesenterici, renales, porta hepatis, gastrici, iliaci laterales, V. portae, omentales, and cavwn pelvis. Among these regions in which the author observed the red lymphonodus, the regions of retropharyngei, diaphragmaticus iliaci laterales, and omentales were not discussed in TEJIMA's report. So the appearance of red lymphonodi in these several regions in goats is a first-finding of the present author (Table 8). 5) In embryos or new born animals within two days, the author could find them in the region of aorta only, however, in specimens older than five days the distribution of these bodies became wide throughout the regions above mentioned. 6) According to their colours and forms, the author classified the red lymphonodi into 36 types (Table 9). Generally the light-coloured and globe-shaped ones were numerous : this tendency was especially clear in young animals (Table 10). 7) The author found a number of abnormally shaped nodi, which may be differentiated into the following types; the combined-form, the fat-included-form, the spotted-form and the complicated-form. A great number of abnormal forms were found in the neighbourhood of large arteries. Most of the combined forms in which the red lymphonodi were combined with normal lymphonodi, and also the fat-included-forms, were light coloured.

The infrared – Thermographycamera “Varioscan-Compact 3011 ” {{was used for the}} thermographic examination. Both front legs of 61 horses were examined, 32 wich had received diagnostic anaesthesia injections as part of a complete lameness exam. 20 other horses included in this study had received neurectomy of the Nn. digitales <b>mediales</b> and laterales at differing times. The control group consisted of nine sound, healthy horses. In the evaluation the absolute temperature of bodysurface of the limbs was established and the temperature difference between corresponding regions of the front legs was assessed. The results of the study can be summoned as follows: 1. The sound horses showed a symmetrical distribution of the temperature of the bodysurface on both front legs. 2. Horses that received diagnostic anaesthetic injections showed a significant increase of temperature after the injections with a peak at 30 minutes post injectionem. A difference between varying groups of anaesthesia was not detectable. That means neither the time of the temperature increase nor the level of temperature difference showed a dependency on the amount of injected local anaesthesia. The most considerable changes in temperature were obvious in the fetlock region, the slightest changes in the region of the hoof. 3. Horses that received a neurectomy revealed an obvious connection between the symmetry of the temperature distribution and the date of the surgery. Horses that had received a neurectomy two to eight weeks before the thermographic examination showed a considerable divergence in the symmetry of temperature distribution. In the horses, whose surgery took place six months to five years ago, no explicit differences in the temperature distribution were detectable with the exeption of two horses. In one proband the limb that received neurectomy and the other horse the healthy limb was considerably warmer than the contralateral extremity. However the absolute temperature of the bodysurface of those two horses was within the physiological limits. Temperatures changes on the bodysurface of the front legs afterbdiagnostic anaesthesia or neurectomycan be detected and accounted for by thermography. However a neurectomy seems to cause a considerable divergence in the summery of the temperature distribution for just a certain period of time. Just six month after surgery only a few corresponding limbs showed a divergence of temperature of more than 1 °C. Hence as well as the fact that neither diagnostic anaesthesia nor neurectomy create a specefic thermographic pattern, the examiner concludes that further specific methods are necessary to back up the results of a thermographic exam...|$|R
40|$|Development of the {{posterior}} spinal cord involves secondary neurulation, a process poorly understood in which neural tube is formed by cavitation {{of the tail}} bud. Comprehension of secondary neurulation is required to understand the morphogenetic origin of high prevalence neural tube defects such as spina bifida. In zebrafish embryos neurulation goes through a stage of neural rod; a neural primordium that hollows a lumen in the middle. To form a single continuous lumen, cells converge to the tissue center, divide in stereotyped orientations perpendicular to it (the so-called C-Divisions), and form a tissue midline composed by apical polarity components that will later originate the central lumen. Polarizing events start with the centrosomes positioning in the midline {{under the control of}} unknown cues. Sonic Hedgehog has been widely described as a midline signaling protein in other systems, and its components are located in the apical cilium and the underlying basal body, formed by a centrosome. Shh expression onset occurs during gastrulation in embryonic midline structures —notochord and floor plate- and maintained along neurulation, suggesting a role of Shh in neural tube morphogenesis. Treatment with the Shh inhibitor cyclopamine disrupts the lumina! surface, while Shh pathway activation (Shh-GOF) produces partial to total lumen duplication. Shh-LOF/Shh-GOF display defects in neural lumen positioning and/or formation, confirming a role of Shh in lumen formation. Shh-LOF and Shh-GOF preserve their apicobasal polarity and tissue architecture. Analysis of the dynamics of tissue convergence in ShhGOF embryos shows that compared to the same WT stages the neural plate is wider and the neural plate borders stop converging later in development, suggesting delayed cell convergence movements. However comparison between Shh-GOF and WT cell trajectories to the midline reveals no differences in motion. We found that trajectories of cells committing C-Divisions had indistinguishable motion properties compared to their neighbouring cells, and that Shh-GOF cellular motion properties —velocity and persistency- are resistant to Shh activity. We next analyzed the behaviour of dividing cells and observed that mitosis progressively lengthened along neurulation. Detailed analysis of the mitotic phases shows that Shh-GOF cells show shortened mitoses from condensation to anaphase, but spend the same time –or slightly longer- in metaphase. C-Divisions need orient their metaphase plate so they divide perpendicularly to the midline, giving rise to daughter cells that lie at the sides of the prospective lumen. In C-Divisions, metaphase plate rotations are decreased and slower. We next assessed if division orientation was compromised along neural tube formation. Analysis of division orientation shows higher variability in ShhGOF embryos especially at early stages, a fact that would have morphogenetic consequences in the C-Divisions and lumen formation. With similar cell motion properties and similar metaphase duration between WT and ShhGOF mitotic cells, the latter have quicker mitoses, less metaphase rotations and the stereotyped orientation of polarizing C-Divisions is altered, thereby affecting lumen formation. Los vertebrados amniotas forman el tubo neural posterior por neurulación secundaria, un proceso apenas estudiado en el que el tubo abre un lumen en el centro. Proponemos el pez cebra (Danio rerio) como modelo para entender el origen embrionario de defectos derivados de fallos en la neurulación secundaria, como es la espina bífida. Durante la neurulación del pez cebra los progenitores neurales compaginan proliferación y convergencia hacia el centro del tejido. Tras la formación de un primordio neural condensado,las células orientan su eje de división perpendicular al eje central (C-Divisions), originando una linea media de polaridad apical que formará el lumen. La polarización empieza con la localización medial del centrosoma, que en interfase constituye la base del cilio. Los componentes de la vía Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) se hallan en el cilio, empezando shh a expresarse en estructuras <b>mediales</b> de la gástrula y néurula -futuras notocorda y placa del suelo-. La inhibición de Shh perturba la continuidad del lumen, y la activación de Shh (Shh-GOF) produce fenotipos de duplicación luminal, sugiriendo que Shh regula la localización/formación del lumen. La polaridad apicobasal de las células permanece intacta, pero el primordio neural es más ancho durante la neurulación. Sin embargo la motilidad de los núcleos y los cilios hacia la línea media es resistente a la actividad de Shh. La duración de las mitosis incrementa a lo largo de la neurulación, y las células Shh-GOF presentan mitosis más rápidas, sin acortamiento de la metafase. Lo mismo sucede en las C-Divisions, en las que la metafase presenta menor rotación y mayor variabilidad en el plano final de división, originando líneas medias ectópicas y duplicación del lumen. Los cambios en los niveles de activación de Shh conllevan consecuencias en la morfogénesis del lumen a través de la regulación de las divisiones durante la formación del tubo neural...|$|R
