This literature review describes the demographic development in France, Italy, Spain and Portugal from the 1960 s. The general pattern is delayed transition to adulthood and first birth, fertility and <b>marriage-rates</b> have declined, while divorce-rates have increased. But demographic behaviour differs between the countries. In France, cohabitation and births outside marriage are common and the divorce rate is relatively high.

Later studies do not find strong support for convergence. demographic patterns; family...|$|R
