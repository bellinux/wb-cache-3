According to U.S. News & World Report, Corzine, Hillary Clinton and Jean Carnahan were the more notable new Senators in 2000.

5|$|James F. Reed <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the Sierra Nevada to Rancho Johnson in late October. He {{was safe}} and {{recovering}} at Sutter's Fort, but each day {{he became more}} concerned for the fate {{of his family and}} friends. He pleaded with Colonel John C. Frémont to gather a team of men to cross the pass and help the company, in return for which Reed promised that he would join Frémont's forces and fight in the Mexican-American War. Reed was joined by McCutchen, who had been unable to return with Stanton, as well as some members of the Harlan-Young party. The Harlan-Young wagon train had arrived at Sutter's Fort on October 8, the last to make it over the Sierra Nevada that season. The party of roughly 30horses and a dozen men carried food supplies, and expected to find the Donner Party on the western side of the mountain, along the Bear River below the steep approach to Emigrant Gap, perhaps starving but alive. When they arrived in the river valley, they found only a pioneer couple, immigrants who had been separated from their company and were near starvation.|$|E

The new bill was enacted, and on July 5, 1935, President Roosevelt signed the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) into law.|$|E

The employees got enough steam up to operate the store’s powerful pumps in the basement, and volunteers went to the roof and used the store's fire hoses to wet down the roof and the wall {{on the side of}} the oncoming fire. Early in the following morning however, the city's waterworks burned, thus ending the water supply and making further efforts useless.

25|$|Following Secret Wars and the {{restoration}} of Earth-616 prior to the Incursions, Emma Frost is among a small team of X-Men that {{come into contact with}} the Terrigen mists at Muir Island, where they found Jamie Madrox dead on the facility grounds. Discovering that the Terrigen Mist cloud was toxic to mutants Scott and Emma formulate a plan to extinguish one of the Inhumans' Terrigen cloud. And while they are able to hold off the Inhumans just long enough to neutralize the green cloud, Cyclops is apparently killed by Black Bolt in self-defense. However at Scott's funeral, Alex is seen afar speaking to Emma that something does not make sense, leading to Emma filling Alex in on some unrevealed details. Black Bolt did not kill Cyclops, in fact, he never <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the facility at Muir Island, as he suffered an immediate reaction to the Terrigen mists, dying in Emma Frost's arms. Since then Emma had been projecting an illusion of him to everyone else as a means of declaring war against the Inhumans in Scott's name.|$|E
25|$|String theory {{eventually}} <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the dustbin, but for {{the following}} decade all work on the theory was completely ignored. Still, the theory continued to develop at a steady pace thanks {{to the work of}} a handful of devotees. Ferdinando Gliozzi, Joel Scherk, and David Olive realized in 1977 that the original Ramond and Neveu Schwarz-strings were separately inconsistent and needed to be combined. The resulting theory did not have a tachyon, and was proven to have space-time supersymmetry by John Schwarz and Michael Green in 1984. The same year, Alexander Polyakov gave the theory a modern path integral formulation, and went on to develop conformal field theory extensively. In 1979, Daniel Friedan showed that the equations of motions of string theory, which are generalizations of the Einstein equations of general relativity, emerge from the renormalization group equations for the two-dimensional field theory. Schwarz and Green discovered T-duality, and constructed two superstring theories—IIA and IIB related by T-duality, and type I theories with open strings. The consistency conditions had been so strong, that the entire theory was nearly uniquely determined, with only a few discrete choices.|$|E

Minardi also scored their first point with Pierluigi Martini's sixth place.|$|R
