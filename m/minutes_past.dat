Southern recovers from his ordeal at the Creighton-Ward Mansion.|$|E
5|$|The climax {{takes place}} at the beauty pageant. After a frantic race against the clock the family arrives at the hotel, and are curtly told by a pageant {{organizer}} that they are a couple <b>minutes</b> <b>past</b> the deadline. A sympathetic hired hand instead offers to register Olive on his own time. As Olive prepares for the pageant, the family sees Olive's competition: slim, hypersexualized pre-teen girls with teased hair and capped teeth. They wear lip gloss, adult-like swimsuits, and glamorous evening wear while performing highly elaborate dance numbers with great panache. It quickly becomes apparent that Olive (plain, chubby, wearing large eyeglasses, and untrained in beauty pageant conventions) is a mere amateur by comparison.|$|E

25|$|The new {{timetable}} {{concentrated on}} key points at Oxted, East Grinstead and the Ashurst-Groombridge-Birchden triangle. It also introduced {{the concept of}} a regular hourly service. Off-peak services now departed Victoria for East Grinstead and Tunbridge Wells West at 8 <b>minutes</b> <b>past</b> the hour, and from Tunbridge Wells West for Victoria at 47 <b>minutes</b> <b>past</b> the hour. A push-and-pull service worked the section from Tunbridge Wells West via Edenbridge Town, connecting at Oxted with London trains. A push-pull service was also introduced between Three Bridges and East Grinstead, also providing connections on the main line in both directions.

25|$|The Axeman was {{not caught}} or identified, and his crime spree stopped as mysteriously {{as it had}} started. The murderer's {{identity}} remains unknown to this day, although various possible identifications of varying plausibility have been proposed. On March 13, 1919, a letter purporting {{to be from the}} Axeman was published in newspapers saying that he would kill again at 15 <b>minutes</b> <b>past</b> midnight on the night of March 19, but would spare the occupants of any place where a jazz band was playing.

25|$|During {{the first}} three hours of the program (or in some markets, the first 3½ hours, {{extending}} into the first half-hour of Todays fourth hour), local affiliates are offered a five-minute window at :25 and :55 <b>minutes</b> <b>past</b> the hour to insert a local newsbreak (which usually also includes a local forecast, and in large and mid-sized markets, a brief traffic report) and local advertisements, although the show provides additional segments for those affiliates who do not provide such a news insert (certain NBC affiliates that produce an additional morning newscast for a sister station or digital subchannel may pre-tape the local inserts aired during {{the first one to}} two hours of Today to focus production responsibilities on their local broadcast).|$|E
25|$|Before BBC News {{moved to}} Broadcasting House, an hourly {{business}} update was included during the weekday schedule from the BBC Business Unit. There were two shifts, from 08:30–14:00 and 14:00–23:00, presented by Penny Haslam, Maryam Moshiri, Ben Thompson, Adam Parsons, Susannah Streeter, Joe Lynam, Sara Coburn or Sally Eden. News Channel updates were usually broadcast at 40 <b>minutes</b> <b>past</b> the hour between 08:00 and 23:00. The 21:40 round-up was often earlier and the 22:40 bulletin is an extended round-up of the day's business news. Until May 2009, the business updates on the BBC News Channel were broadcast {{from one of}} the London Stock Exchange's studios in central London. From then until March 2013 the bulletins were provided from the channel's studio at BBC Television Centre. The business updates were axed in March 2013 as part of the BBC's Delivering Quality First plan. But after complaints returned in November 2013. Stock market updates now only appear during the quarter-to-the-hour headlines, but it was changed after complaints in November with Ben Thompson and Victoria Friz are the main presenters sharing 08:00–14:00 or 14:00–18:00 between them. With Alice Baxter, Jamie Robertson, Aaron Heslehurst and Sally Bundock offer relief. There is normally an extended bulletin at 16:45 when the main business stories of the day are discussed on Afternoon Live.|$|E
25|$|D Company landed {{very close}} to their {{objectives}} at 16 <b>minutes</b> <b>past</b> midnight (the first Allied unit to land in France). The soldiers poured out of their battered gliders, completely surprising the German defenders, and taking the bridges within 10 minutes, losing two men – Lieutenant Den Brotheridge and Lance corporal Fred Greenhalgh – in the process. A further two officers and 14 soldiers were wounded during {{the battle for the}} bridges. Lieutenant Den Brotheridge led the first platoon to land at Pegasus Bridge followed one minute later by Lieutenant David Wood's platoon. Lieutenant Dennis Fox led the first platoon to land at Horsa Bridge. The glider carrying Captain Brian Priday and Lieutenant Tony Hooper's platoon, which was assigned to the capture of Horsa Bridge, landed at the bridge over the River Dives, some seven miles from where they intended. In spite of this, the occupants of the glider captured the River Dives bridge, advanced through the German lines towards the village of Ranville where they eventually rejoined the British forces. The Ox and Bucks platoons holding the bridges were relieved by the 7th Battalion of the Parachute Regiment at 03:00hours. The Germans attempted to re-capture the bridges, but were repulsed. Later in the day, at about 13:00hrs, Lord Lovat and elements of the Commandos of his 1st Special Service Brigade arrived to relieve the exhausted defenders, followed by the 3rd British Infantry Division. The operation was immortalised in the film The Longest Day.|$|E
50|$|Expanding on the original's {{premise of}} a one-hour time loop, this version saw the main {{character}} reliving the same 24-hour period, which would restart at one <b>minute</b> <b>past</b> midnight (rather than midday as in the other versions). It also contains a pseudo-happy ending, as the protagonist ultimately {{finds a way to}} correct the time loop {{over the course of the}} film’s 92-minute running time.|$|R
5000|$|... "One <b>Minute</b> <b>Past</b> Eternity" [...] {{is a song}} {{written by}} William E. Taylor and Stanley Kesler, and {{performed}} by Jerry Lee Lewis.

25|$|The {{declaration}} became {{just before}} tea, which was taken early again, but storm clouds gathered {{over the ground}} {{and many of the}} 35,900 crowd left for home. The Umpire made a brief inspection, but declined to resume play due to the gloom and the rain promptly came down a few minutes later. However, the clouds passed over and the ground was cleared up quickly enough for play to resume at five <b>minutes</b> <b>past</b> five. Dennis Amiss and David Lloyd survived, making 33/0 by stumps even though they each gave an easy chance, Amiss hitting a full-toss in the still dazed McCosker's midriff, where he fumbled the catch and Walters dropping Lloyd in the slips. England began the last day needing 367 runs in 360 minutes and to everyone’s surprise Amiss and Lloyd set about the bowling as if they meant to win. The wicket was now brown, slow and even without any spin and they reached 68/0 off 86 minutes. At this point Lloyd edged the ball off Thomson (2/74) to Greg Chappell, who took his twelfth catch of the series. Amiss gloved an unplayable, rearing ball from Lillee (2/65) to the predatory Marsh. John Edrich came in and ducked a Lillee bouncer that stayed low and gave him a sickening blow to his ribs. He was helped off the field by the England physiotherapist Bernie Thomas and taken to hospital for an X-ray. Colin Cowdrey steered an awkwardly lifting ball from Walker (2/46) to Ian Chappell and England were 74/3, effectively 74/4. Keith Fletcher was joined by Tony Greig took the score past 100, but the Essex captain, having fended off a sharp bouncer the ball before, played back to a fuller delivery and was caught by Ashley Mallett in the gully. Mallett's hand had recovered enough for him to bowl and he took 2/3 after lunch, Knott was caught by Redpath glancing the ball off his legs and Titmus was caught sweeping. To everyone's surprise Edrich returned to the wicket at 156/6, he had been told that his ribs were only badly bruised, but he moved with obvious pain (later tests revealed that they were broken). Ian Chappell promptly brought Lillee back into the attack even though he was not fully rested and the fast bowler gave the England captain two overs of short-pitched bowling. At the other end Greig had made a confident 54, but was stumped trying to drive Mallet (4/21). Underwood was caught and bowled by Walker and England went in to tea on 184/8. On their return Edrich played a captain's innings against Lillee and Thomson, controlling the strike and bringing up the 200. Lillee ironically bowled Willis with a yorker just after being warned for the third or fourth time about his short-pitched bowling to the tailender. By this time England were 211/9, but only needed to survive 10 overs for a draw. Arnold held out for 35 minutes and made 14 when he misread Mallet's spin and edged him to Greg Chappell. Edrich had batted for 155 minutes for his 33 not out, but it was not enough. England were dismissed for 228 and lost the Test by 171 runs and with it the Ashes. The crowd flooded the field as the players walked off and Australia started their celebrations.|$|E
