6000|$|... "'I don't think it's funny at all,' said Sam. 'But jes let <b>me</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>one</b> thing: what's {{the name}} of the toll-gate woman?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Let <b>me</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>one</b> question, Alick--not a {{flattering}} one. May {{not some}} of these private impressions of yours have been coloured by your long illness!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Permit <b>me</b> to <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>one</b> question," [...] <b>asked</b> the sailor;--"is there {{anything}} {{of which you}} are ashamed in the circumstances which you have declined to communicate." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Andrew," [...] he said, [...] "you {{know very}} well that I haven't a pal in the world I'd sooner have here than you for just as long as you choose to stay, but--forgive <b>me</b> if I <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>one</b> question. Is it because you want to watch Miss Fielding that you have changed your mind?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, {{the only}} name I choose to {{acknowledge}} at present {{is the name}} of Merton Ware," [...] Philip declared. [...] "If you think there is any mystery about me, any connection with the gentleman whom I believe you call Mr. Douglas Romilly, well, the matter is one for your investigation. You will forgive me if I remind you that my guests will be here in {{a matter of a few}} minutes, and permit <b>me</b> to <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>one</b> more question. Why do you come here to me in this very unofficial manner? If I am really an impostor, you are giving me every opportunity of clearing out." ...|$|R
6000|$|Mr. Farebrother {{was silent}} for a moment, and then said earnestly, [...] "My dear fellow, let <b>me</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>one</b> question. Forgive me if I take a liberty." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Mr. Hurd," [...] he begged, [...] "do let <b>me</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>one</b> question! Why do {{you refuse}} me? What harm can I {{possibly}} do {{by talking to}} your villagers?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Mr. Jacks," [...] he said, [...] "you are, I am sure, a {{very clever}} man. Let <b>me</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>one</b> question. Has it ever fallen to your lot {{to make a}} mistake?" ...|$|E
5000|$|Let <b>me</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> a question...: {{the first}} time you fucked her, was she any good? Yeah? Now let <b>me</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> another question: how do you think she got that way? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{am going}} to explain {{everything}} to you, Lady Dennisford," [...] I declared; [...] "but before I do so, let <b>me</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> something! I have given <b>you</b> <b>one</b> shock! Can <b>you</b> stand another?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Let <b>me</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> the {{question}} <b>you</b> <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> {{a few minutes}} ago," [...] her companion begged. [...] "Were you born in America--or England?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And you and Fan {{together}} {{met this}} man and never mentioned it to me! Let <b>me</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>one</b> question more, Constance. Is this person you are engaged to a Christian or an infidel?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Mr. Finsbury, I have {{no means}} of showing you my gratitude; but let <b>me</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>one</b> question," [...] said Pitman. [...] "If I were a very rich client, would you not take the risk?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Several," [...] replied Tommy. [...] "Look here, you've {{been asking}} {{me a lot}} of questions. Let <b>me</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>one</b> for a change. Why didn't you kill me off at once before I regained consciousness?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Your Highness," [...] {{said the}} Colonel, turning pale; [...] "let <b>me</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> to {{consider}} the importance of your life, not only to your friends, but to the public interest. 'If not to-night,' said this madman; but supposing that to-night some irreparable disaster were to overtake your Highness's person, what, let <b>me</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you,</b> what would be my despair, and what the concern and disaster of a great nation?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "They're worth {{a bushel}} of diamonds--when you cook 'em. But let <b>me</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> something--is your old dad as fierce as Uncle Dan?" ...|$|R
5000|$|Mr. Plowman the State: Now, let <b>me</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> a question, ma'am. Do {{you have}} any {{religious}} beliefs or personal beliefs against the death penalty? ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Let <b>me</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>one</b> question, my dear,' she said, 'just to set my mind at rest. I {{was told}} that your brother's affairs were {{involved}} with those of that unhappy man. I trust {{it is no longer}} so.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Stop!--Mr Moffat. Let <b>me</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>one</b> question. I'll hear {{anything}} that {{you have got to}} say, but on one condition: that is, that Miss Augusta Gresham shall be by while you say it. Will you consent to that?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Let <b>me</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>one</b> instead," [...] she said, more seriously. [...] "Do {{you think}} I'm {{at all the}} kind of person for a Senior Proctor's wife? You say I suit your {{abstract}} requirements, but one can't get married in the abstract, you know. Viewed concretely, don't you fancy I'm about the most unsuitable helpmate you could possibly light upon?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And {{when you}} come down to-morrow night, don't call out! Let <b>me</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> a parting question. What made you cry, 'Halloa! Below there!' to-night?" ...|$|R
60|$|In conclusion, Sir, let <b>me</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> not {{to force}} on me this {{continued}} correspondence by daily attacks. It is a trouble and a nuisance.|$|R
6000|$|... "I see," [...] he murmured. [...] "And now, having reached {{just this}} stage in our conversation, let <b>me</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> this. You read the newspapers?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Olive's face {{expressed}} her gratitude. [...] "And now," [...] said she, [...] "what do {{you think}} of the young men? I feel so well acquainted with you through Mrs. Easterfield that I shall give a great deal of weight to your opinion. But first let <b>me</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>one</b> thing: After what you have heard of me {{do you think}} I am a flirt?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Mrs Clennam {{has been}} of great service to me; I don't know what {{we should have done}} without the {{employment}} she has given me; I am afraid {{it may not be a}} good return to become secret with her; I can say no more to-night, sir. I am sure you mean to be kind to us. Thank you, thank you.' 'Let <b>me</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>one</b> question before I leave. Have you known my mother long?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, don't say that!" [...] exclaimed Mr. Hemphill. [...] "Don't say that! Not for {{the world}} would I give up the memory of hearing her say she once loved me! I don't care how many years ago it was. I am glad you let me come here. I am glad she told me. I shall never forget the {{happiness}} I have had in this house. And now, Mrs. Easterfield, let <b>me</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>one</b> thing--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{is beyond}} all measure charming of you," [...] Guillot declared, [...] "but let <b>me</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> a little question. Is it peace or war?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Let <b>me</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> one," [...] {{chimed in}} the Girton Girl. [...] "Would a {{bricklayer}} hesitate any longer between a duchess and a scullery- maid?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{see that}} I should {{come here with}} proofs," [...] she exclaimed. [...] "Well, they are easy enough to collect. You shall have them. But before I go, Lord Arranmore, let <b>me</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> if you know who I am." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I quite {{agree with}} you," [...] said Matt, [...] "and that isn't what I mean. But {{if it would}} have been right and well for him to come forward at such a time, why shouldn't some other man, who does love her?" [...] He hurried tremulously on: [...] "Wade, let <b>me</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>one</b> thing more! You have seen her so much more than I; and I didn't know--Is it possible--Perhaps I ought to ask if you are at all--if you care for her?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now, Peter Prosper, {{before you}} go let <b>me</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>one</b> question. Which of the two has been the rudest to the other? You have come {{and asked me to}} marry you, and have evidently wished to back out of it from the moment in which you found that I had ideas of my own about money. And now you call me rude, because I have my little revenge. I have called you Peter Prosper, and you can't stand it. You haven't spirit enough to call me Matty Thoroughbung in reply. But good-bye, Mr. Prosper,--for I never will call you Peter again. As to what I said to you about money, that, of course, is all bosh. I'll pay Soames's bill, and will never trouble you. There's your letter, which, however, would be of no use, because it is not signed. A very stupid letter it is. If you want to write {{naturally}} you should never copy a letter. Good-bye, Mr. Prosper--Peter that never shall be." [...] Then she got up {{and walked out of the}} room.|$|E
60|$|Tenth, and lastly, Bear {{with one}} word farther. What greater {{contempt}} can be thrown upon the saints than for their brethren to cast them off, or to debar them church communion? Think you {{not that the}} world may groundly say, Some great iniquity lies hid in the skirts of your brethren; when in truth the transgression is yet your own? But I say, what can the church do more to the sinners or open profane? Civil commerce you will have with the worst, and what more have you with these? Perhaps you will say we can pray and preach with these; and hold them Christians, saints, and godly. Well, but let <b>me</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>one</b> word farther: Do you believe, that of very conscience they cannot consent, as you, to that of water baptism? And {{that if they had}} light therein, they would as willingly do it as you? Why then, as I have shewed you, our refusal to hold communion with them is without a ground from the word of God. But can you commit your soul to their ministry, and join with them in prayer; and yet not count them meet for other gospel privileges? I wold know by what scripture you do it? Perhaps you will say, I commit not my soul to their ministry, only hear them occasionally for trial. If this be all the respect thou hast for them and their ministry, thou mayest have as much for the worst that pisseth against the wall. But if thou canst hear them as God's ministers, and sit under their ministry as God's ordinance; then shew me where God hath such a gospel ministry, as that the persons ministering may not, though desiring it, be admitted with you to the closest communion of saints. But if thou sittest under their ministry for fleshly politic ends, thou hearest the word like an atheist, and art thyself, while thou judgest thy brother, in the practice of the worst of men. But I say, where do you find this piece-meal communion with men that profess faith and holiness as you, and separation from the world. If you object, that my principles lead me to have communion with all; I answer with all as afore described; if they will have communion with me.|$|E
6000|$|... "Of course not, boy," [...] {{interrupted}} Mr Shirley. [...] "Well, now, let <b>me</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you,</b> Ned, {{how much}} gold have you {{brought back from}} the diggings?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'And {{for that}} individual, Mr Venus,' remarks Wegg, {{when he is}} fully gone, 'I have been passed over! Let <b>me</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> {{what you think of}} him?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, we doesn't want nothink," [...] {{repeated}} the domestic, stoutly. [...] "Missus said so, an' she bid <b>me</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> if you'd like {{a cup of}} tea?" ...|$|R
