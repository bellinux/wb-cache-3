60|$|Do {{but hold}} still, and I will let thee see Yet in <b>my</b> <b>ways</b> more mysteries there be.

One I set in the window, that I might Show some go down to hell with gospel light. One I set in a corner, as you see, To show how some in secret snared be. Gross webs great store I set in darksome places, To show how many sin with brazen faces; Another web I set aloft on high, To show there's some professing men must die. Thus in <b>my</b> <b>ways</b> God wisdom doth conceal, And by <b>my</b> <b>ways</b> that wisdom doth reveal. I hide myself when I for flies do wait, So doth the devil when he lays his bait; If I do fear the losing of my prey, I stir me, and more snares upon her lay: This way and that her wings and legs I tie, That, sure as she is catch'd, so she must die. But if I see she's like to get away, Then with my venom I her journey stay. All which <b>my</b> <b>ways</b> the devil imitates To catch men, 'cause he their {{salvation}} hates.|$|R
