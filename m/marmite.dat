25|$|<b>Marmite</b> is {{paired with}} cheese, {{such as in}} a cheese sandwich, and {{has been used as}} an {{additional}} flavouring in Mini Cheddars, a cheese-flavoured biscuit snack. Similarly, it is one of Walkers Crisps flavours; is sold as a flavouring on rice cakes; and <b>Marmite</b> Biscuits. Starbucks in the UK has a cheese and <b>Marmite</b> panini on its menu.|$|E
25|$|<b>Marmite</b> {{is rich in}} B {{vitamins}} including thiamin (B1), riboflavin (B2), niacin (B3), {{folic acid}} (B9) and vitamin B12. The sodium content of the spread is high and has caused concern, although it is the amount per serving rather than the percentage in bulk <b>Marmite</b> that is relevant. The main ingredient of <b>Marmite</b> is yeast extract, which contains {{a high concentration of}} glutamic acid. <b>Marmite</b> made in the United Kingdom and exported to several countries is almost gluten free. However, Unilever will not confirm that it contains less than 20 PPM of gluten, the current European standard and the proposed US FDA standard for gluten-free labelling.|$|E

25|$|In 1990, <b>Marmite</b> Limited– {{which had}} become a {{subsidiary}} of Bovril Limited– was bought by CPC International Inc, which {{changed its name to}} Best Foods Inc in 1998.

25|$|<b>Marmite</b> {{today is}} {{fortified}} with added vitamins, resulting in it being banned temporarily in Denmark, which disallows foodstuffs {{that have been}} fortified until they have undergone necessary testing. The Danish Veterinary and Food Administration stated in 2015 that <b>Marmite</b> had not been banned in the country, but that fortified foods need {{to be tested for}} safety and approved before they can be marketed in the country. In 2014, suppliers applied for a risk assessment to be undertaken after which <b>Marmite</b> became available in Denmark.|$|E

5|$|The most {{well known}} French chef of the Middle Ages was Guillaume Tirel, {{also known as}} Taillevent. Taillevent worked in {{numerous}} royal kitchens during the 14th century. His first position was as a kitchen boy in 1326. He was chef to Philip VI, then the Dauphin who was son of John II. The Dauphin became King Charles V of France in 1364, with Taillevent as his chief cook. His career spanned sixty-six years, and upon his death he was buried in grand style between his two wives. His tombstone represents him in armor, holding a shield with three cooking pots, <b>marmites,</b> on it.|$|R
5000|$|The Aiguillon goes dry {{during the}} summer, but has {{carved out a}} rocky gorge called Les Concluses on the {{limestone}} plateau. From a viewpoint high above, the gorge is riddled with deep geological structures known as <b>marmites</b> des géants (potholes). In summer it is popular with walkers, who follow the water course under the steeply overhanging limestone valley sides. The walls of the gorge have many climbing routes of an average 8a difficulty. Similarly, {{the walls of the}} valley contain many caves and potholes [...] The largest one is the [...] "Baume du Biou," [...] or the Grotto of the Ox.|$|R
25|$|The {{product that}} was to become <b>Marmite</b> was invented in the late 19th century when German {{scientist}} Justus von Liebig discovered that brewer's yeast could be concentrated, bottled and eaten. In 1902 the <b>Marmite</b> Food Extract Company was formed in Burton upon Trent, Staffordshire, England with <b>Marmite</b> as its main product and Burton {{as the site of}} the first factory. The by-product yeast needed for the paste was supplied by Bass Brewery. By 1907, the product had become successful enough to warrant construction of a second factory at Camberwell Green in London.|$|E
25|$|Today, {{the main}} {{ingredients}} of <b>Marmite</b> {{manufactured in the}} UK are glutamic acid-rich yeast extract, with lesser quantities of sodium chloride, vegetable extract, spice extracts and celery extracts, although the precise composition is a trade secret. Vitamin B12 is not naturally found in yeast extract, but is added to <b>Marmite</b> during manufacture.|$|E
25|$|<b>Marmite</b> is {{traditionally}} eaten as a savoury spread on bread, toast, savoury biscuits or crackers, {{and other similar}} baked products. Owing to its concentrated taste it is often spread thinly with butter or margarine. <b>Marmite</b> can also {{be made into a}} savoury hot drink by adding one teaspoon to a mug of hot water much like Oxo and Bovril.|$|E
40|$|M. B. Diouf—The Cooking-Pot War : Restaurant-Keepers in Dakar Industrial Area. Contrary to some sociologists' assertions, the {{so-called}} 'unstructured', 'traditional' or 'informai' sector of activities in African towns is not totally {{separated from the}} modem one: they show enough functional links and relations to {{be considered as a}} single System. This is exemplified by the case of the Senegalese women who manage cheap eating places in Dakar's industrial district. The growth of modem industry demands a numerous and inexpensive labour force made up of impover-ished rural migrants. These low-paid wage-earners can afford only cheap food provided by the gargotieres who, in turn, barely make a living out of it. As well as the industrial workers, they are kept in a precarious situation by management policy and governement intervention. Thus the 'modem' or 'formai' industrial sector depends on the existence of the 'informai' food trade, which could not survive without the patronage of the exploited workers. It is only through a kind of political hypocrisy that they can be presented as totally unrelated entities. Diouf Made B.

40|$|There was a {{time when}} {{observers}} had the impression that European companies could think of no better gift from the government than a subsidy of some sort. Scrutiny of such governmental largess at the E. U. level was perceived as lax and any consequences for violating the E. U. competition rules against such handouts were seen as remote and timid. Times have changed. As the European Commission (the 2 ̆ 2 Commission 2 ̆ 2) stiffens its resolve to police and punish unlawful State intervention in the marketplace, governmental subsidies to favored undertakings, broadly referred to in the European Union as 2 ̆ 2 State aid, 2 ̆ 2 are fast becoming gifts that companies sometimes wish they had not received. The characterization of State aid granted in a straightforward manner as unlawful, e. g., through the grant of a loan at an artificially low rate, is relatively unproblematic, but the Commission is more and more often scrutinizing suspected State aid in unobvious and novel situations. In doing so, the Commission has been using the tests applied in straightforward cases and has adapted them to the situations under review (to use a French expression [...] c 2 ̆ 7 est dans les vieilles <b>marmites</b> qu 2 ̆ 7 on fait la meilleure soupe...|$|R
25|$|Immediately {{after the}} announcement, there was {{reported}} panic buying of <b>Marmite</b> from supermarkets, and {{over one hundred}} auctions for jars of <b>Marmite,</b> new and used, were listed on online auction site TradeMe, with some sellers asking for up to NZ$800 per jar; over 185 times its usual retail price of around $4.25 per 250g jar People were advised to use the spread sparingly, with even Prime Minister John Key admitting {{he might have to}} switch to Australian rival Vegemite once his personal supplies had run out. Throughout the shortage <b>Marmite</b> ran a number of marketing campaigns on social media which led to a 2,975% increase in fans and a lot of brand exposure.|$|E
25|$|<b>Marmite</b> is {{manufactured}} in South Africa by Pioneer Foods (Pty) Ltd in traditional and cheese flavour.|$|E

25|$|<b>Marmite</b> {{should be}} avoided if a person takes a MAOI antidepressant, such as {{phenelzine}} (Nardil) or tranylcypromine (Parnate), as yeast extracts interact negatively with these types of medications due to their tyramine content.|$|E
25|$|A spread for sandwiches, toast, {{crumpets}} and cracker biscuits {{as well as}} {{a filling}} for pastries, Vegemite is similar to British, New Zealand and South African <b>Marmite,</b> Australian Promite, MightyMite, AussieMite, OzEmite and Swiss Cenovis.|$|E
25|$|A {{version with}} a {{different}} flavour has been manufactured in New Zealand since 1919. This is the only product sold as <b>Marmite</b> in Australasia and the Pacific, whereas {{elsewhere in the world}} the British version predominates.|$|E
25|$|Unilever PLC has its UK and Ireland {{headquarters}} in Leatherhead at the purpose-built Unilever House - {{home to the}} following consumer brands: Bertolli, Cif, Colman's, Domestos, Dove, Flora, Hellmann's, Knorr, Lynx, <b>Marmite,</b> Persil, Radox, Sure, Surf, Toni & Guy, Tresemme, VO5 and Wall's ice cream.|$|E
25|$|Vegemite {{is one of}} {{the richest}} sources of Bvitamins, {{specifically}} thiamine, riboflavin, niacin and folate (B1, B2, B3 & B9, respectively). Unlike <b>Marmite</b> and some other yeast extracts, the base version contains no vitamin B12 although both B6 and vitamin B12 are added to the low-salt formulation.|$|E
25|$|Vegemite is {{produced}} in Australia at Mondelez's Port Melbourne manufacturing facility which produces more than 22 million jars per year. Virtually unchanged from Callister's original recipe, Vegemite now far outsells <b>Marmite</b> and other similar spreads in Australia. The billionth jar of Vegemite was produced in October 2008.|$|E
25|$|The CFIA later {{clarified}} {{that these}} specific items had been seized {{because they were}} not the versions that are formulated for sale in Canada and which met all Canadian food regulations. Canadian versions of <b>Marmite</b> and the other products would still be permitted to be sold in Canada.|$|E
25|$|On 24 January 2014, the Canadian Food Inspection Agency was noted, in a CBC story, as {{moving to}} stop the sale of <b>Marmite,</b> as well as Vegemite and Ovaltine, in Canada because they were enriched with {{vitamins}} and minerals which were not listed in Canadian food regulations. The agency said the products were not a health hazard.|$|E
25|$|There are {{a number}} of similar yeast {{products}} available in other countries; these products are not directly connected to the original <b>Marmite</b> recipe and brand. The Australian product Vegemite is distributed in many countries, and AussieMite is sold in Australia. Other products include OzeMite which is made by Dick Smith Foods, Cenovis, a Swiss spread, and Vegex, an autolyzed yeast product available in the USA since 1913.|$|E
25|$|In Denmark, {{food safety}} {{legislation}} dictates that foodstuffs that contain added vitamins {{can only be}} sold by retailers which have been licensed by the Veterinary and Food Administration. In May 2011, the company that imports the product to Denmark revealed that it wasn't licensed and had therefore stopped selling the product: this led to widespread but inaccurate reports in the British media that <b>Marmite</b> had been banned by the Danish authorities.|$|E
25|$|Sanitarium {{announced}} in February 2013 that production had restarted and the factory {{was in the}} process of building up stock ready for the return. <b>Marmite</b> returned to New Zealand retailers effective midnight on 20 March 2013, although only the 250g jar size was initially available and many supermarkets imposed a limit of two jars per customer per day to promote fairness and prevent bulk buying. Supply to overseas retailers resumed after the New Zealand supply and demand settled.|$|E
25|$|Following {{newspaper}} reports in May 2011 that Vegemite and <b>Marmite</b> had been banned and were being removed from shelves in Denmark, outraged fans set up several Facebook groups. In response, Denmark's Ministry of Food, Agriculture and Fisheries stated that neither spread had been banned {{but that the}} respective companies had not applied for licences to market their products in Denmark. In 2004 Denmark had passed legislation prohibiting the sale of food products fortified with vitamins as a danger to health.|$|E
25|$|Another image {{regularly}} reported {{is that of}} Jesus Christ. Sightings of {{this type}} {{have been reported in}} such varied media as cloud photos, <b>Marmite,</b> chapatis, shadows, Cheetos, tortillas, trees, dental x-rays, cooking utensils, windows rocks and stones, painted and plastered walls, and dogs' hindquarters. Again, some of these items have been offered for sale on internet auction sites, and a number have been bought by the Golden Palace casino. When such images receive publicity, people frequently come considerable distances to see them, and to venerate them.|$|E
