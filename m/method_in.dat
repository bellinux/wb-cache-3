5|$|Although up to 200,000 {{people were}} {{executed}} during the Spanish Civil War and its immediate aftermath, 48 people were executed {{in the period}} from 1948 {{to the time of}} the 1975 executions.

5|$|Early {{reports on}} the {{centrifugal}} method indicated {{that it was not}} as efficient as predicted. Urey suggested that a more efficient but technically more complicated countercurrent system be used instead of the previous flow-through method. By November 1941, technical obstacles seemed formidable enough for the process to be abandoned. Countercurrent centrifuges were developed after the war, and today are the favored <b>method</b> <b>in</b> many countries.|$|E
5|$|In 1476, {{during the}} time of Leonardo's {{association}} with Verrocchio's workshop, the Portinari Altarpiece by Hugo van der Goes arrived in Florence, bringing from Northern Europe new painterly techniques that were to profoundly affect Leonardo, Ghirlandaio, Perugino and others. In 1479, the Sicilian painter Antonello da Messina, who worked exclusively in oils, travelled north on his way to Venice, where the leading painter Giovanni Bellini adopted the technique of oil painting, quickly making it the preferred <b>method</b> <b>in</b> Venice. Leonardo was also later to visit Venice.|$|E
5|$|In 1891, German {{botanist}} Otto Kuntze published Revisio generum plantarum, {{his response}} to what he perceived {{as a lack of}} <b>method</b> <b>in</b> existing nomenclatural practice. He revived the genus Atylus on the grounds of priority, and correctly made the combination Atylus anemonifolius. However, Kuntze's revisionary program was not accepted by the majority of botanists. Ultimately, the genus Isopogon was nomenclaturally conserved over Atylus by the International Botanical Congress of 1905.|$|E

40|$|The {{replacement}} of <b>in</b> vivo <b>methods</b> by <b>in</b> vitro <b>methods</b> <b>in</b> regulatory drug testing is rare. The {{aim of this}} research is to identify barriers and drivers of the {{replacement of}} <b>in</b> vivo <b>methods</b> by <b>in</b> vitro <b>methods</b> <b>in</b> Europe. We studied two cases. The first case is the Draize eye test. Since 2009, the in vivo test is partly replaced by <b>in</b> vitro <b>methods.</b> The second case concerns EPO potency testing. Since the eighties, financial and scientific efforts have been made to replace the in vivo EPO potency test with in vitro methods; however the efforts failed to deliver expected outcomes. The innovation systems approach is used to identify the drivers and barriers regarding replacement of <b>in</b> vivo <b>methods</b> by <b>in</b> vitro <b>methods</b> <b>in</b> regulatory drug testing in Europe, such as {{the presence or absence of}} legislative pressure, legitimacy, and funding. Combining and comparing the outcomes resulted in an overview of potential barriers and drivers, and an indication of which of these factors are critical for replacement of <b>in</b> vivo <b>methods</b> by <b>in</b> vitro <b>methods</b> <b>in</b> regulatory drug testing. Policy makers could use these results to formulate policies that enable the replacement of <b>in</b> vivo <b>methods</b> by <b>in</b> vitro <b>methods</b> <b>in</b> regulatory drug testing...|$|R

5|$|Several {{methods are}} known for {{defining}} cellular automata rules that are reversible; these include the block cellular automaton <b>method,</b> <b>in</b> which each update partitions the cells into blocks and applies an invertible function separately to each block, and the second-order cellular automaton <b>method,</b> <b>in</b> which the update rule combines states from two previous steps of the automaton. When an automaton is not defined by one of these methods, but is instead given as a rule table, the problem of testing whether it is reversible is solvable for block cellular automata and for one-dimensional cellular automata, but is undecidable for other types of cellular automata.|$|E
