SGM launched a suite of 20 new products in March 2012 at the Prolight+Sound trade fair in Germany. Twelve months later they launched the G-Spot IP-65 rated LED <b>moving</b> <b>head</b> profile spot.|$|E

2500|$|Since <b>moving</b> <b>heads</b> did not attain {{prominence}} until DMX's predecessor, AMX, or Analog Multiplex {{had passed}} the zenith of its popularity. Very few <b>moving</b> <b>heads</b> use analogue control, due to crippling restrictions on bandwidth, data transfer speeds and potential inaccuracy. [...] Some of the most modern intelligent fixtures use RJ-45 or Ethernet cabling for data transfer, due to the increased bandwidth available to control increasingly complicated effects. Using the new Ethernet technology, control surfaces {{are now able to}} control a much larger array of automated fixtures.|$|R
2500|$|The {{factors that}} limit {{the time to}} access the data on an HDD are mostly related to the {{mechanical}} nature of the rotating disks and <b>moving</b> <b>heads.</b>|$|R
25|$|The {{most recent}} {{development}} in intelligent lighting is digital lighting, with fixtures such as High End Systems' DL3. These fixtures {{consist of a}} bright LCD or DLP projector mounted on a moving yoke, much like that of an ordinary <b>moving</b> <b>head.</b> These fixtures also contain an integrated media server, which allows for millions of colour choices, endless libraries of gobo-like images, and projection of images and video.|$|E
25|$|In 1985, {{the first}} <b>moving</b> <b>head</b> {{to use the}} DMX {{protocol}} was produced by Summa Technologies. Up until that time, moving lights were using other communication protocols, such as DIN8, AMX, D54 and the proprietary protocols of other companies, such as VariLite, Tasco, High End and Coemar. The Summa HTI had a 250 W HTI bulb, two colour wheels, a gobo wheel, a mechanical dimmer and zoom functions.|$|E
25|$|Devices like moving heads {{also require}} {{independent}} power, as they cannot function on a partially dimmed channel for power, {{on top of}} requiring several other channels in order to convey all of the data they require for their several features. In order to simplify the control of <b>moving</b> <b>head</b> lanterns, instead of assigning channels manually to the lantern, many desks also offer a fixtures section, where one can assign the lantern as a fixture, allowing the desk to organise the data being transferred to the lantern on a much simpler scale for the operator. Fixtures may also incorporate smoke machines, snow machines, haze machines etc., allowing many special effects to be run from a single desk.|$|E

2500|$|LED stage {{lights come}} in four main types. PAR cans, spotlights, striplights, and [...] "moving head" [...] types. In LED PAR cans, a round {{printed circuit board}} with LEDs mounted on is used {{in place of a}} PAR lamp. <b>Moving</b> <b>head</b> types can either be a bank of LEDs mounted on a yoke or more {{conventional}} <b>moving</b> <b>head</b> lights with the bulb replaced with an LED bank.|$|E
2500|$|On a <b>moving</b> <b>head</b> {{the glass}} gobos {{could have some}} fault caused by back-reflections of {{the light on the}} lens, to solve this defect can be used antireflections gobo.|$|E
2500|$|The gobo {{is placed}} in the focal plane of the lantern (generally an {{ellipsoidal}} reflector spotlight or a <b>moving</b> <b>head).</b> [...] The gobo is inserted upside-down and back-to-front. The lighting instrument inverts the projected image.|$|E

50|$|The {{printing}} {{speed of}} serial dot matrix printers with <b>moving</b> <b>heads</b> varies from 30 to 1550 cps. In contrast to this, line matrix printers {{are capable of}} printing much more than 1000 cps, resulting in a throughput of up to 800 pages/hour.|$|R
2500|$|Moving mirrors are {{faster than}} <b>moving</b> <b>head</b> fixtures. However moving heads are {{visually}} {{more interesting and}} have a far larger range of movement. The movement from mirror lights tends to be rectilinear, because the center of movement for both axes is usually in the same place, while one axis of a <b>moving</b> <b>head</b> luminaire describes a circle (usually called [...] "pan") and the other (the [...] "tilt") changes {{the diameter of the}} circular movement. In early luminaires a pseudo rotating gobo effect could be achieved by moving the tilt in line with the other axis and then moving the pan from end stop to end stop.|$|E
2500|$|In {{addition}} to these, certain modern instruments are automated, referring to motorized movement {{of either the}} entire fixture body or the movement of a mirror {{placed in front of}} its outermost lens. [...] These fixtures and the more traditional follow spots add direction and motion to the relevant characteristics of light. [...] Automated fixtures fall into either the [...] "moving head" [...] or [...] "moving mirror/scanner" [...] category. [...] Scanners have a body which contains the lamp, circuit boards, transformer, and effects (color, gobo, iris etc.) devices. [...] A mirror is panned and tilted in the desired position by pan and tilt motors, thereby causing the light beam to move. [...] <b>Moving</b> <b>head</b> fixtures have the effects and lamp assembly inside the head with transformers and other electronics in the base or external ballast. [...] There are advantages and disadvantages to both. [...] Scanners are typically faster and less costly than <b>moving</b> <b>head</b> units but have a narrower range of movement. [...] <b>Moving</b> <b>head</b> fixtures have a much larger range of movement as well as a more natural inertial movement but are typically more expensive.|$|E
2500|$|An {{automated}} light, properly {{called a}} luminaire, fixture (or sometimes <b>moving</b> <b>head),</b> is a versatile and multi-function instrument designed to replace multiple conventional, non-moving lights. Depending on the venue and application, automated luminaires {{can be a}} versatile and economical addition to a stock of traditional lights because, with proper programming, they can swiftly alter many aspects of their optics, changing the “personality” of the light very quickly. [...] Lighting is typically pre-programmed and played back using only simple commands, although moving heads can be controlled “live” if the operator is sufficiently experienced.|$|E

50|$|Intelligent {{lighting}} {{refers to}} stage lighting that has automated or mechanical abilities beyond those of traditional, stationary illumination. Although {{the most advanced}} intelligent lights can produce extraordinarily complex effects, the intelligence lies with the programmer of the show rather than the instruments or the lighting operator. For this reason, intelligent lighting {{is also known as}} automated lighting, moving lights or <b>moving</b> <b>heads.</b>|$|R
2500|$|Intelligent lights (now {{commonly}} referred to as automated or <b>moving</b> <b>heads),</b> can be used wherever {{there is a need for}} powerful lighting which must be capable of rapid and extreme changes of mood and effects. [...] Moving heads would, therefore, be inappropriate in a setting which does not require strong lighting (such as a home) or where the “quality” of the light required does not vary excessively (although it may need to be very strong for a venue like a stadium). [...] Naturally, there are exceptions to this rule, most notably the use of large numbers of <b>moving</b> <b>heads</b> for international sporting events, such as the Commonwealth Games or Olympic Games, where many thousands of separate automated fixtures are often used to light the opening and closing ceremonies. The 2008 Summer Olympics, in Beijing, had a rig of around 2,300 intelligent fixtures which is [...] "the largest single automated lighting system ever assembled for a single event" ...|$|R
2500|$|<b>Moving</b> <b>head</b> {{fixtures}} {{are often}} divided into spot, wash lights and beam lights. They vary in use and functions, but many companies offer profile and wash {{versions of the}} same model of light. Profile lights generally contain features like gobos and prisms, whereas wash lights have simpler optics and a wider beam aperture resulting in wider beam angle, which may be altered by internal lenses or “frost effects”. Wash lights {{are more likely to have}} CMY colour mixing although it is common for high-end spot lights to have such features too.|$|E
2500|$|Also {{known as}} a [...] "pneumatic press". To counter the {{disadvantages}} of the <b>moving</b> <b>head</b> press, the bladder press was designed {{to have a long}} cylindrical rubber sausage (the [...] "bladder") mounted {{through the center of the}} tank (creating essentially an annulus) that is inflated by air or water to produce outward pressure on the cake against a perforated screen. The cake becomes like a donut with even pressure applied almost equally to all parts of the cake. The benefits of this style is a usually even amount of pressure applied to the cake as well as an added ability to help cool the must if the bladder is filled with cold water. A disadvantage is the labor intensiveness of cleaning and empty and the potential high oxygen exposure if the tank is not enclosed.|$|E
2500|$|This {{press is}} {{essentially}} a basket press that has been turned on it sides with two heads at opposite ends providing more homogenous pressure as it moves horizontally towards the compacting cake. Often these presses have chains connected between the two heads that break up the cake between pressings as the heads are retracted. While less labor-intensive than traditional basket presses and providing more even pressure, one disadvantage of the <b>moving</b> <b>head</b> press is that it that cake gets so compact that {{it is often difficult}} for juice to strain from the inner core of the cake out. This has the effect of creating a dry [...] "outer cake" [...] and wet [...] "inner cake" [...] with trapped juices still inside. The juice extracted from the dry outer cake can also be very coarse and high in phenolics.|$|E

2500|$|On May 10, 1983, a {{few hours}} after {{defeating}} José Estrada at a WWF TV taping at the Lehigh County Agricultural Hall in Allentown, Pennsylvania, Snuka placed a call for an ambulance. When emergency personnel arrived at his room at the George Washington Motor Lodge, they found that his girlfriend, Nancy Argentino, had been injured. She was transported to Allentown's Sacred Heart Medical Center, where she died shortly after of [...] "undetermined craniocerebral injuries." [...] The coroner's report stated that Argentino, 23, died of traumatic brain injuries consistent with a <b>moving</b> <b>head</b> striking a stationary object. Autopsy findings show Argentino suffered more than two dozen cuts and bruises — a possible sign of [...] "mate abuse" [...] — on her head, ear, chin, arms, hands, back, buttocks, legs, and feet. Forensic pathologist Isidore Mihalakis, who performed the autopsy, wrote {{at the time that the}} case should be investigated as a homicide until proven otherwise.
