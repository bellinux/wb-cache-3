5|$|Mimicry {{may involve}} {{numerous}} species; many harmless {{species such as}} hoverflies are Batesian mimics of strongly defended species such as wasps, while <b>many</b> <b>such</b> well-defended species form Mullerian mimicry rings, all resembling each other. Mimicry between prey species and their predators often involves three or more species.|$|E

5|$|Again, the Swiss {{raided the}} Klettgau and the Hegau and pillaged several {{fortified}} smaller Swabian {{cities such as}} Tiengen or Stühlingen before retreating again. This whole war was characterized by <b>many</b> <b>such</b> smaller raids and plundering expeditions of both sides between a few larger battles. On the eastern front, a new Habsburg attack on the Rhine valley provoked a counterstrike of the Eidgenossen, who remained victorious {{in the battle of}} Frastanz near Feldkirch on April 20, 1499.|$|E
5|$|Benefitting {{from the}} advent of postcards, Mary Willumsen (1884–1961) photographed women in scanty {{clothing}} or nude at the Helgoland beach facility in Copenhagen. Between 1916 and 1920, she took <b>many</b> <b>such</b> photographs which she sold at a nearby kiosk. The operation was discontinued when the police began to take an interest. Many of the compositions are now considered to have considerable artistic merit.|$|E

5|$|He {{describes}} {{the range of}} species in each group in some detail, concluding that the birds are unlike those {{of any of the}} surrounding countries and are quite isolated, but are related to those of distant places including New Guinea, Australia, India and Africa; he thinks there is nowhere else where so <b>many</b> <b>such</b> species occur in one place. Similarly in the Nymphalidae (he mentions the English member, the purple emperor butterfly), there are 48 species of which 35 are endemic to Celebes. He concludes that the Celebes group of islands is a major faunal division of the archipelago.|$|E
5|$|Hess was {{discharged}} from the armed forces in December 1918. The family fortunes had taken a serious downturn, as their business interests in Egypt had been expropriated by the British. Hess joined the Thule Society, an antisemitic right-wing Völkisch group, and a Freikorps, one of <b>many</b> <b>such</b> volunteer paramilitary organisations active in Germany at the time. Bavaria witnessed frequent and often bloody conflicts between right-wing {{groups such as the}} Freikorps and left-wing forces as they fought for control of the state during this period. Hess was a participant in street battles in early 1919 and led a group which distributed thousands of antisemitic pamphlets in Munich.|$|E
5|$|In South Africa and Australia, two of {{the three}} centers of species diversity, the natural {{habitats}} of these plants are undergoing a high degree of pressure from human activities. Expanding population centers (such as Queensland, Perth, and Cape Town) threaten <b>many</b> <b>such</b> habitats, as does the draining of moist areas for agriculture and forestry in rural areas. The droughts that have been sweeping Australia over the last 10 years also pose a threat to many species by drying up previously moist areas.|$|E

Other integer sorting algorithms with smaller worst-case time bounds are not believed to be practical for computer architectures with 64 or fewer bits per word. <b>Many</b> <b>such</b> algorithms are known, with performance depending {{on a combination of}} the number of items to be sorted, number of bits per key, and number of bits per word of the computer performing the sorting algorithm.|$|E
5|$|It {{appears that}} Roman {{citizens}} were also regularly recruited to the auxilia. Most likely, {{the majority of}} citizen recruits to auxiliary regiments were the sons of auxiliary veterans who were enfranchised on their fathers' discharge. <b>Many</b> <b>such</b> may have preferred to join their fathers' old regiments, which were a kind of extended family to them, rather than join a much larger, unfamiliar legion. There are also instances of legionaries transferring to the auxilia (to a higher rank). The incidence of citizens in the auxilia would thus have grown steadily over time until, after the grant of citizenship to all peregrini in 212, auxiliary regiments became predominantly, if not exclusively, citizen units.|$|E
5|$|Lucius and {{his army}} were spared, {{due to his}} kinship with Antony, the strongman of the East, while Fulvia was exiled to Sicyon. Octavian showed no mercy, however, for the mass of allies loyal to Lucius; on 15 March, the anniversary of Julius Caesar's assassination, he had 300 Roman {{senators}} and equestrians executed for allying with Lucius. Perusia also was pillaged and burned as a warning for others. This bloody event sullied Octavian's reputation and was criticized by <b>many,</b> <b>such</b> as Augustan poet Sextus Propertius.|$|E

5|$|Nicolls had <b>many</b> <b>such</b> grand {{schemes for}} trade between Britain and its colonies, but these all failed to materialise.

On 3 November 1828 Captain William Bate replaced Nicolls as commandant on Ascension. Nicolls was given the substantive rank of major before leaving, on 8 May 1828.|$|E
5|$|Plant {{medicines}} {{can cause}} adverse effects and even death, whether by side-effects of their active substances, by adulteration or contamination, by overdose, or by inappropriate prescription. <b>Many</b> <b>such</b> effects are known, while others {{remain to be}} explored scientifically. There {{is no reason to}} presume that because a product comes from nature it must be safe: the existence of powerful natural poisons like atropine and nicotine shows this to be untrue. Further, the high standards applied to conventional medicines do not always apply to plant medicines, and dose can vary widely depending on the growth conditions of plants: older plants may be much more toxic than young ones, for instance.|$|E

5|$|Several days earlier, Black meets Emma Shetterly (Gwynyth Walsh), the school's vice-principal. Shetterly {{explains}} that five students have {{claimed to be}} experiencing visions of Saint Mary; she believes the girls involved are unlikely candidates for divine visions, particularly the trouble-making Clare McKenna (Genele Templeton). Black speaks to the girls, who claim to have had visions during a sermon by Reverend Hanes; Hanes' son Alex refutes this. Black returns to Shetterly's office, and is met by Lara Means (Kristen Cloke), who works {{with her husband in}} the Millennium Group.

5|$|Structural DNA nanotechnology, {{sometimes}} abbreviated as SDN, {{focuses on}} synthesizing and characterizing nucleic acid complexes and materials where the assembly has a static, equilibrium endpoint. The nucleic acid double helix has a robust, defined three-dimensional geometry {{that makes it}} possible to predict and design the structures of more complicated nucleic acid complexes. <b>Many</b> <b>such</b> structures have been created, including two- and three-dimensional structures, and periodic, aperiodic, and discrete structures.|$|E

Mackay claims that <b>many</b> <b>such</b> investors were ruined by the fall in prices, and Dutch commerce suffered a severe shock. Although Mackay's book is a classic, his account is contested. Many modern scholars feel that the mania was not as extraordinary as Mackay described and argue that not enough price data are available to prove that a tulip bulb bubble actually occurred.|$|E
