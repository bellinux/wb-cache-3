5|$|Due to its location, the Church of St Peter {{is often}} {{described}} as a cemetery church. However, scholar Bistra Nikolova considers it improbable that an ordinary village cemetery church would have an inscription by a Bulgarian tsar. In her opinion, it is <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> church was constructed by a noble person related to the court of the Second Bulgarian Empire.|$|E
5|$|It {{was later}} {{claimed by the}} Nazis that Wessel also wrote the music to the song, but it was {{considered}} <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> tune was in reality adapted from a World War I German Imperial Navy song, and was probably originally a folk song. The authorship of the melody was finally determined by a German court in 1937 as not by Wessel.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} {{international}} breed associations have been testing the F94L status of cattle registered in their herd books. The absence of F94L genes in some tested cattle {{might be a}} result of a sire or dam ancestor that had double muscling (MH) genes, or <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> myostatin gene was the normal or wild type variant found most commonly in beef cattle. In the latter case, loss of the F94L variant will arise when grading up to purebred when base animals are not Limousins.|$|E

5|$|In {{the first}} letter to Tacitus, Pliny the Younger {{suggested}} that his uncle's death {{was due to the}} reaction of his weak lungs to a cloud of poisonous, sulphurous gas that wafted over the group. However, Stabiae was 16km from the vent (roughly where the modern town of Castellammare di Stabia is situated) and his companions were apparently unaffected by the volcanic gases, and so it is <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> corpulent Pliny died from some other cause, such as a stroke or heart attack. His body was found with no apparent injuries on the next day, after dispersal of the plume.|$|E
5|$|The known {{range of}} Boletopsis nothofagi {{is limited to}} two {{narrowly}} defined areas of New Zealand, one on the North Island {{and the other on}} the South Island. These areas are in Rimutaka Forest Park near Wellington, and Saint Arnaud {{in the northern part of}} the South Island. These locations are relatively far away from each other and isolated, which, together with its absence in the rest of New Zealand, makes it unlikely that the species is a recent import. It is <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> species is native to New Zealand and has been overlooked in earlier surveys due to its rarity.|$|E
5|$|The {{origin of}} this pulsar planet is still uncertain, but it {{probably}} did not form where it is found today. Because of the decreased gravitational force when the core of star collapses to a neutron star and ejects most of its mass in a supernova explosion, {{it is unlikely that}} a planet could remain in orbit after such an event. It is <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> planet formed in orbit around the star that has now evolved into the white dwarf, and that the star and planet were only later captured into orbit around the neutron star.|$|E

5|$|Writing in the Handbook of Texas, {{historian}} Thomas Ricks Lindley {{maintains that}} the Wagner cannon does not match the Smithwick account. The Wagner gun is made of iron and is smaller than a six-pounder. Historians such as Lindley think it <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Gonzales cannon was taken to San Antonio de Béxar, where it was used during the Battle of the Alamo and captured by Mexican troops in March 1836.

5|$|Al-Mu'tadid {{died at the}} Hasani palace on 5 April 902, at the age {{of either}} 40 or 47. There were rumours that he had been poisoned, but it is <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> rigours of his campaigns, coupled with his dissolute life, {{severely}} weakened his health. During his final illness, he refused to follow the advice of his physicians, and even kicked one of them to death. He left behind him four sons and several daughters. Al-Mu'tadid was the first Abbasid caliph to be buried within the walls of Baghdad. Like his sons after him, he was buried in the former Tahirid palace {{in the western part of}} the city, which was now used by the caliphs as a secondary residence.|$|E
5|$|Alexius Slav's {{marriage}} to the daughter of Latin Emperor Henry of Flanders in 1209 was potentially a great danger to Boril, who could be facing their joint forces. Fearing such a coalition, Boril approached Strez, {{who was at the}} time gaining more power and was close to complete independence from Serbia. Strez agreed to a union with his former enemy, though only after Boril reconfirmed his complete autonomy. Strez eliminated the remaining Serbian troops in his lands in an act that the Serbs saw as devil-inspired treason. It is not impossible that Boril persuaded Strez through military action, though it is <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> union was achieved through negotiations.|$|E

5|$|Chat Moss may {{be named}} after St Chad, a 7th-century bishop of Mercia, {{but as it}} was once part of a great tree-edged lake, as {{evidenced}} by the numerous wood remains in the lower levels of the peat, it is perhaps <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> name stems from the Celtic word ced, meaning wood. Chat Moss could also derive from Ceatta, an Old English personal name and mos, a swamp or alternatively the first element could be the Old English ceat meaning a piece of wet ground. It was recorded as Catemosse in 1277 and Chatmos in 1322. Moss is the local name for a peat bog.|$|E
5|$|Edwin was {{defeated}} by the Welsh and died at the Battle of Hatfield Chase, on a date traditionally given as 12 October 633. One problem with the dating of the battle is that Pope Honorius I wrote in June 634 to Paulinus and Archbishop Honorius {{saying that he was}} sending a pallium, the symbol of an archbishop's authority, to each of them. The pope's letter shows no hint that news of Edwin's death had reached Rome, almost nine months after the supposed date of the battle. The historian D. P. Kirby argues that this lack of awareness makes it <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> battle occurred in 634.|$|E
5|$|Middlewich {{was founded}} by the Romans, who gave it the name Salinae because of its {{surrounding}} salt deposits. It {{became one of the}} major Roman sites for salt production, an activity that was centred on the township of Kinderton, {{about a quarter of a}} mile north of the present-day parish church of St. Michael and All Angels. It has been suggested that pre-Roman salt production also occurred in the same area, but there is no supporting archaeological evidence. Whittaker's History of Manchester claims that the Iron Age Cornovii made Kinderton their capital, but it is <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Cornovii inhabited Kinderton for its salt-making potential. There was once thought to have been a medieval castle at Kinderton, but that is now thought to have been unlikely.|$|E

50|$|However, {{considering}} Doñana {{is usually}} {{no more than}} 0.1 percent macromerine, several pounds of the dried cactus {{would be required to}} consume a psychedelic dosage of macromerine.

5|$|The McClintock {{expedition}} {{also found}} a human skeleton on the southern coast of King William Island. Still clothed, it was searched, and some papers were found, including a seaman's certificate for Chief Petty Officer Henry Peglar (b. 1808), Captain of the Foretop, HMS Terror. However, since the uniform {{was that of a}} ship's steward, it is <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> body was that of Thomas Armitage, gun-room steward on Terror and a shipmate of Peglar, whose papers he carried. At another site on the western extreme of the island, Hobson discovered a lifeboat containing two skeletons and relics from the Franklin expedition. In the boat was a large amount of abandoned equipment, including boots, silk handkerchiefs, scented soap, sponges, slippers, hair combs, and many books, among them a copy of The Vicar of Wakefield. McClintock also took testimony from the Inuit about the expedition's disastrous end.|$|E
5|$|The {{extent of}} Zenobia's {{territorial}} control during her early reign is debated; according to historian Fergus Millar, her authority {{was confined to}} Palmyra and Emesa until 270. If this was the case, the events of 270 (which saw Zenobia's conquest of the Levant and Egypt) are extraordinary. It is <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> queen ruled the territories controlled by her late husband, a view supported by Southern and historian , and backed by ancient sources (such as the Roman historian Eutropius, who wrote that the queen inherited her husband's power). The Augustan History also mentioned that Zenobia {{took control of the}} East during Gallienus' reign. Further evidence of extended territorial control was a statement by the Byzantine historian Zosimus, who wrote that the queen had a residence in Antioch.|$|E
5|$|The time-line for Salamis is {{difficult}} to establish with any certainty. Herodotus presents the battle as though it occurred directly after the capture of Athens, but nowhere explicitly states as much. If Thermopylae/Artemisium occurred in September, then {{this may be the}} case, but it is probably <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Persians spent two or three weeks capturing Athens, refitting the fleet, and resupplying. Clearly though, at some point after capturing Athens, Xerxes held a council of war with the Persian fleet; Herodotus says this occurred at Phalerum. Artemisia, queen of Halicarnassus and commander of its naval squadron in Xerxes's fleet, tried to convince him to wait for the Allies to surrender believing that battle in the straits of Salamis was an unnecessary risk. Nevertheless, Xerxes and his chief advisor Mardonius pressed for an attack.|$|E

50|$|The {{research}} strategy predicts <b>that</b> it is <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>that</b> in <b>the</b> long term infrastructure probabilistically determines structure, which probabilistically determines the superstructures, than otherwise.

50|$|One popular legend ascribes its {{etymology}} to the Salvador, a {{ship from}} <b>the</b> Spanish Armada <b>that</b> sank by <b>the</b> rocks near Arromanches-les-bains in 1588. It is <b>more</b> <b>likely,</b> however, <b>that</b> <b>the</b> name Calvados {{was derived from}} calva dorsa, meaning bare backs, in reference to two sparsely vegetated rocks off its shore.|$|R
5|$|Victoria's {{youngest}} son, Leopold, {{was affected}} by the blood-clotting disease haemophilia B and two of her five daughters, Alice and Beatrice, were carriers. Royal haemophiliacs descended from Victoria included her great-grandsons, Alexei Nikolaevich, Tsarevich of Russia, Alfonso, Prince of Asturias, and Infante Gonzalo of Spain. The presence of the disease in Victoria's descendants, but not in her ancestors, led to modern speculation that her true father was not the Duke of Kent but a haemophiliac. There is no documentary evidence of a haemophiliac in connection with Victoria's mother, and as male carriers always suffer the disease, even if such a man had existed {{he would have been}} seriously ill. It is <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> mutation arose spontaneously because Victoria's father was over 50 {{at the time of her}} conception and haemophilia arises more frequently in the children of older fathers. Spontaneous mutations account for about a third of cases.|$|E
5|$|A {{study from}} Currie, Horner, Erickson and Longrich in 2010 {{has been put}} forward as {{evidence}} of cannibalism in the genus Tyrannosaurus. They studied some Tyrannosaurus specimens with tooth marks in the bones, attributable to the same genus. The tooth marks were identified in the humerus, foot bones and metatarsals, and this was seen as evidence for opportunistic scavenging, rather than wounds caused by intraspecific combat. In a fight, they proposed {{it would be difficult}} to reach down to bite in the feet of a rival, making it <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> bite marks were made in a carcass. As the bite marks were made in body parts with relatively scanty amounts of flesh, it is suggested that the Tyrannosaurus was feeding on a carcass in which the more fleshy parts had already been consumed. They were also open to the possibility that other tyrannosaurids practiced cannibalism. Other evidence for cannibalism has been unearthed.|$|E
5|$|Historical records {{report that}} Minyue and Dongyue were emptied of people, {{and that its}} {{residents}} were deported to the territories between the Huai River and the Yangtze River. The alleged population transfer was a resumption of a policy that had been planned since 138 BC. The Han government considered the mountainous region difficult to control and was wary of trusting its residents. Modern historians doubt the event happened. The deportation of an entire kingdom is implausible, and nothing {{has been found to}} verify a migration of Han settlers to the Minyue region around the year 1, something that would have occurred had the area been abandoned while under Han control. There was only one town of Han settlers, Dongyue, in Minyue. Dongyue was built where the Min River meets the sea, around the time of Emperor Wu's reign. It is <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> assimilation of Minyue into Han Chinese culture through Han conquest happened later in the dynasty.|$|E
