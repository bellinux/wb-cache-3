5|$|The Federal Bridge Gross Weight Formula, {{also known}} as Bridge Formula B or the Federal Bridge Formula, is a {{mathematical}} formula in use in the United States by truck drivers and Department of Transportation (DOT) officials to determine the appropriate <b>maximum</b> <b>gross</b> <b>weight</b> for a commercial motor vehicle (CMV) based on axle number and spacing. The formula is part of federal weight and size regulations regarding interstate commercial traffic (intrastate traffic is subject to state limits). The formula is necessary to prevent heavy vehicles from damaging roads and bridges. CMVs are most often tractor-trailers or buses, but the formula is of most interest to truck drivers due to the heavy loads their vehicles often carry.|$|E

Modifications include strengthened airframe structural components (including a new tailboom), improved transmission, upgraded engine for the L-1, all of which result in a <b>maximum</b> <b>gross</b> <b>weight</b> increase of 300 pounds and increased performance.|$|E

25|$|Inspection of the {{airframe}} {{and engine}} disclosed that the aircraft was intact {{and the engine}} was developing substantial power before impacting the trees. Investigators {{found no evidence of}} engine or system failure or malfunction of the aircraft prior to the crash. The airplane was determined to be slightly over <b>maximum</b> <b>gross</b> <b>weight</b> when it departed Dyersburg Regional Airport, but this fact had no bearing on the crash. An autopsy of the pilot discovered no physical or medical concerns that could have been a factor in the accident.|$|E
25|$|Due to {{the great}} urgency placed on {{delivering}} the B-57A Canberra, the initial phase of manufacturing performed by Martin used a minimum-change formula to expedite production, thus the first B-57As to be produced were largely identical to the Canberra B.2. As such, more than 30 changes that had been requested by the Wright Air Development Center (WADC) were rejected on program schedule or cost grounds. One noticeable exception was the adoption of more powerful Armstrong Siddeley Sapphire engines capable of producing 7,200lbf (32kN) of thrust, which were license-built in the United States as the Wright J65. The Sapphire-based J65 powerplant had been selected {{in place of the}} British-built Canberra's Rolls-Royce Avons as the USAF had placed an emphasis on operations within hot climates and intended to fly at a slightly higher <b>maximum</b> <b>gross</b> <b>weight</b> than the RAF's operating practices.|$|E
500|$|In 2010 Airbus {{offered a}} new version of the −300 with the <b>maximum</b> <b>gross</b> <b>weight</b> {{increased}} by two tonnes to 235 t.

It is planned to be implemented by mid-2015. This −300 version will have the range extended by 400nmi and will carry 5 t more payload.

500|$|Enola Gay {{took off}} at 02:45, [...] {{overweight}} and near <b>maximum</b> <b>gross</b> <b>weight.</b> Arming {{of the bomb}} began eight minutes into the flight and took 25 minutes. Parsons, as the [...] "weaponeer", was {{in command of the}} mission. Parsons and his assistant, Second Lieutenant Morris R. Jeppson of the 1st Ordnance Squadron, made their way into the bomb bay of the Enola Gay along the narrow catwalk on the port side. Jeppson held a flashlight while Parsons disconnected the primer wires, removed the breech plug, inserted the powder bags, replaced the breech plug, and reconnected the wires. Before climbing to altitude on approach to the target, Jeppson switched the three safety plugs between the electrical connectors of the internal battery and the firing mechanism from green to red. The bomb was then fully armed. Jeppson monitored its circuits.|$|E
