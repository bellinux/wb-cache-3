Use of diazinon imprinted polymers such as sorbents in solid phase extraction, is a prominent and novel application area of <b>molecular</b> <b>imprinted</b> polymers.

40|$|The {{development}} of new selective analytical methods and sample enrichment techniques remains of interest. The implementation of <b>molecular</b> <b>imprints</b> in chemical analysis may offer advantages over existing methodologies. Criteria for the applicability of <b>molecular</b> <b>imprints</b> in separation methods, ligand-binding assays, sample pre-treatment and sensors are defined. Each analytical problem requires imprints with specific characteristics. Affinities can be comparable with those observed for antigen-antibody interactions, which enables application in ligand-binding assays and for sensors. However, for application in separation methods, moderate affinities, allowing fast mass transfer between the mobile and stationary phase, are essential to obtain highly efficient separations. For sample pre-treatment procedures a large range of affinities can be used; however, large sample volumes can only be processed with high affinity materials. The sample pretreatment application directed to preconcentration leaks the mast promising.

5000|$|<b>Molecular</b> <b>imprinting</b> is, in fact, {{making an}} {{artificial}} tiny lock {{for a specific}} molecule that serve as miniature key. Like plastic receptors the imprinted polymer grabs specific chemicals. Many basic biological processes, from sensing of odors to signaling between nerve and muscle cells, rely on such lock-and-key combinations. For decades, scientists trying to understand these interactions often play locksmith, searching for the right key to fit a particular receptor. Now, the elegance of <b>molecular</b> <b>imprinting</b> in nature has been spurring many scientists to build the locks themselves. They etch a material to create specific cavities which in size, shape and functional groups, fit the target molecule. However, {{one of the greatest}} advantages of artificial receptors over naturally occurring ones is freedom of molecular design. Their frameworks are never restricted to proteins, and a variety of skeletons (e.g., carbon chains and fused aromatic rings) can be used. Thus, the stability, flexibility, and other properties are freely modulated according to need. Even functional groups that are not found in nature can be employed in these man-made compounds. Furthermore, when necessary, the activity in response towards outer stimuli (photo-irradiation, pH change, electric or magnetic field, and others) can be provided by using appropriate functional groups. The spectrum of functions is far wider than that of naturally occurring ones.In a <b>molecular</b> <b>imprinting</b> processes, one needs a 1) template, 2) functional monomer(s) 3) cross-linker, 4) initiator, 5) porogenic solvent and 6) extraction solvent. According to polymerization method and final polymer format one or some of the reagent can be avoided. There are two main methods for creating these specialized polymers. The first is known as self-assembly, which involves the formation of polymer by combining all elements of the MIP and allowing the molecular interactions to form the cross-linked polymer with the template molecule bound. The second method of formation of MIPs involves covalently linking the imprint molecule to the monomer. After polymerization, the monomer is cleaved from the template molecule. The selectivity is greatly influenced by the kind and amount of cross-linking agent used in the synthesis of the imprinted polymer. The selectivity is also determined by the covalent and non-covalent interactions between the target molecule and monomer functional groups. The careful choice of functional monomer is another important choice to provide complementary interactions with the template and substrates. In an imprinted polymer, the cross-linker fulfills three major functions: First of all, the cross-linker is important in controlling the morphology of the polymer matrix, whether it is gel-type, macroporous or a microgel powder. Secondly, it serves to stabilize the imprinted binding site. Finally, it imparts mechanical stability to the polymer matrix. From a polymerization point of view, high cross-link ratios are generally preferred in order to access permanently porous materials and {{in order to be able}} to generate materials with adequate mechanical stability.The self-assembly method has advantages in the fact that it forms a more natural binding site, and also offers additional flexibility in the types of monomers that can be polymerized. The covalent method has its advantages in generally offering a high yield of homogeneous binding sites, but first requires the synthesis of a derivatized imprint molecule and may not imitate the [...] "natural" [...] conditions that could be present elsewhere.Over the recent years, interest in the technique of <b>molecular</b> <b>imprinting</b> has increased rapidly, both in the academic community and in the industry. Consequently, significant progress has been made in developing polymerization methods that produce adequate MIP formats with rather good binding properties expecting an enhancement in the performance or in order to suit the desirable final application, such as beads, films or nanoparticles. One of the key issues that have limited the performance of MIPs in practical applications so far is the lack of simple and robust methods to synthesize MIPs in the optimum formats required by the application. Chronologically, the first polymerization method encountered for MIP was based on [...] "bulk" [...] or solution polymerization. This method is the most common technique used by groups working on imprinting especially due to its simplicity and versatility. It is used exclusively with organic solvents mainly with low dielectric constant and consists basically of mixing all the components (template, monomer, solvent and initiator) and subsequently polymerizing them. The resultant polymeric block is then pulverized, freed from the template, crushed and sieved to obtain particles of irregular shape and size between 20 and 50 µm.Depending on the target (template) type and the final application of the MIP, MIPs are appeared in different formats such as nano/micro spherical particles, nanowires and thin film or membranes. They are produced with different polymerization techniques like bulk, precipitation, emulsion, suspension, dispersion, gelation, and multi-step swelling polymerization. Most of investigators in the field of MIP are making MIP with heuristic techniques such as hierarchical imprinting method. The technique for the first time was used for making MIP by Sellergren et al. for imprinting small target molecules. With the same concept, Nematollahzadeh et al. developed a general technique, so-called polymerization packed bed, to obtain a hierarchically structured high capacity protein imprinted porous polymer beads by using silica porous particles for protein recognition and capture.|$|E

5000|$|In chemistry, <b>molecular</b> <b>imprinting</b> is a {{technique}} to create template-shaped cavities in polymer matrices with memory of the template molecules {{to be used in}} molecular recognition. [...] This technique is based on the system used by enzymes for substrate recognition, which is called the [...] "lock and key" [...] model. The active binding site of an enzyme has a unique geometric structure that is particularly suitable for a substrate. A substrate that has a corresponding shape to the site is recognized by selectively binding to the enzyme, while an incorrectly shaped molecule that does not fit the binding site is not recognized. In a similar way, molecularly imprinted materials are prepared using a template molecule and functional monomers that assemble around the template and subsequently get crosslinked to each other. The functional monomers, which are self-assembled around the template molecule by interaction between functional groups on both the template and monomers, are polymerized to form an imprinted matrix (commonly known in the scientific community as a molecular imprinted polymer i.e. MIP). Then the template molecule is removed from the matrix under certain conditions, leaving behind a cavity complementary in size and shape to the template. The obtained cavity can work as a selective binding site for a specific template molecule.|$|E

When H2SO4 {{was used as the}} polymerization initiator (acidifying agent), a positive correlation was found between surface areas, e.g. load capacities, and the molecular weights of the respective solvents. Later on, in 1949 Dickey reported the polymerization of sodium silicate in the presence of four different dyes (namely methyl, ethyl, n-propyl and n-butyl orange). The dyes were subsequently removed, and in rebinding experiments it was found that silica prepared in the presence of any of these [...] "pattern molecules" [...] would bind the pattern molecule in preference to the other three dyes. Shortly after this work had appeared, several research groups pursued the preparation of specific adsorbents using Dickey's method.
