40|$|In December 2007, a male {{equipment}} operator was fatally {{injured by}} a <b>metal</b> <b>lock</b> <b>ring</b> propelled from a multi-piece wheel tire assembly he was inflating. The victim was employed by an excavating and snow removal company. At {{the time of}} the incident, he and a co-worker were getting their loaders ready to remove snow from a shopping mall parking lot. Soon after he started his loader, the victim noticed that his left front tire mounted on a multi-piece wheel was “soft”(under-inflated). The multi-piece rim wheel referring to the tire assembly consisted of six components: the rim base, valve assembly, tire, side <b>ring,</b> O-ring and <b>lock</b> <b>ring.</b> The function of the <b>lock</b> <b>ring</b> was to hold the tire in place by locking and securing the other wheel components when the tire was inflated. The victim asked the co-worker, whose loader had an air compressor, to put air in the tire. The initial tire pressure was not checked. The co-worker connected one end of an air hose to the quick-connect fitting on the air compressor and the clip-on chuck at the other end to the valve stem of the tire. The co-worker then went to his loader’s cab and used the throttle control to maintain the airflow. The air hose did not have an in-line pressure gauge. The victim checked the air pressure at the tire valve with a hand-held pressure gauge periodically as the tire was being inflated. The maximum cold tire inflation pressure specified by the tire manufacturer was 35 pounds per square inch (psi). After a few minutes, the victi...|$|R

50|$|The {{built-up}} gun {{is constructed}} of liner, tube, jacket, three hoops, two <b>locking</b> <b>rings,</b> tube and liner <b>locking</b> <b>ring,</b> yoke ring and screw box liner. Some components were autofretted. Typical of United States naval weapons {{built in the}} 1940s, the bore was chromium-plated for longer barrel life. It uses a Welin breech block that opens downwards and is hydraulically operated. The screw box liner and breech plug are segmented with stepped screw threads arranged in fifteen sectors of 24 degrees each.|$|R
50|$|The upper {{receiver}} {{consists of}} a housing, in which a <b>locking</b> <b>ring</b> is permanently fixed, and a Picatinny rail as an interface to the rifle scope.

Into the above-mentioned <b>locking</b> <b>ring,</b> the bolt <b>locks</b> by rotation; thus, the receiver with <b>locking</b> <b>ring,</b> bolt and barrel form the breech of the rifle. The APR rifle has a traditional manually operated rotary bolt with three radial locking lugs at the front. The bolt requires only a 60° bolt rotation; both features should be appreciated by the shooter during multiple firings that require rapid projectile placement on the target.|$|R

50|$|Mod 4, {{the twelve}} guns from , relined in 1921-1923, had a conical {{one-step}} liner and uniform rifling {{with a new}} chase locking hoop and <b>locking</b> <b>ring.</b> With the Mod 5 {{an attempt was made}} to reline a Mod 1 with a uniform twist rifling, but it was dropped. Mod 6 relined Mod 2 with a uniform twist rifling along with a modified new chase hoop and <b>locking</b> <b>ring.</b> Mod 7 took the Mod 3 and used a one-step conical liner, uniform twist rifling, and added a tube and liner <b>locking</b> <b>ring.</b> Mod 8 was the Mod 0 or Mod 4 also using a one-step conical liner, uniform twist rifling that was secured by a tube and liner <b>locking</b> <b>ring</b> with a liner locking collar at the breech end. The Mod 8s that used Mod 0 guns also added a new chase hoop and <b>locking</b> <b>ring.</b> Mod 9 was a Mod 2 or Mod 6 that had a new liner with longitudinal clearances at the liner shoulders installed, uniform twist rifling along with a tube and liner <b>locking</b> <b>ring</b> and collar added at the breech end. Mod 10, like the Mod 9, was also a Mod 2 or Mod 6 that had a new liner with longitudinal clearance at the liner shoulders installed, uniform twist rifling along with a tube and liner <b>locking</b> <b>ring</b> and collar added at the breech end. The Mod 10 used Breech Mechanism Mark 9 instead of the Mark 8 on the previous Mods. Mod 11 was a Mod 7 that had the chamber lengthened, adding , and a 3½° breech band seating slope and used Breech Mechanism Mark 12. Mod 12 used a Mod 10 and lengthened the chamber and added a 3½° breech band seating slope with Mod 13 being similar but of a Mod 8, Mod 14 used a Mod 9, Mod 15 used a Mod 7, Mod 16 used a Mod 10, Mod 17 used a Mod 8, and Mod 18 a Mod 9. Mod 19, the last modification, used a Mod 2 with its breech modified for the Smith-Asbury Breech Mechanism and the forward end of the chamber modified similar to the Mod 18, lengthened the chamber and added a 3½° breech band seating slope. The breech end was further modified by being machined out so that it could accommodate a gas check seat liner <b>locking</b> <b>ring.</b> The Mod 19 could also be used right or left handed by cutting a new slide keyway that was 180° from the original keyway.|$|R
50|$|There {{are other}} door types available. These are {{proprietary}} designs having special characteristics which suit {{them to a}} variety of applications. For example, some door designs are simpler than the <b>locking</b> <b>ring</b> type, having no notched cutouts at all in the <b>locking</b> <b>rings.</b> They are easily operated by hand or power and intrinsically safe, much like the T-bolt configuration, in that any movement of the locking mechanism from closed toward open will release pressure well before the door and hub actually separate.|$|R

Both of the Mod 0 and Mod 1 guns had a tube, jacket, with the Mod 1 having a thicker jacket, and 15 hoops with a <b>locking</b> <b>ring.</b> The hoops started [...] from the breech and extended to the muzzle.

50|$|The door has toothed lugs {{all around}} its circumference, with the lugs {{lined up with}} {{corresponding}} openings in the <b>locking</b> <b>ring,</b> which turns on the hub. When closed, the door faces the hub and an O-ring gasket provides the means of sealing against internal pressure. As the <b>locking</b> <b>ring</b> turns, it cams the lugs of the door forward, pressing the door against the hub. This way, there is no sliding motion of the door face across the O-ring gasket. Thus, the gasket can be an inexpensive O-ring, replacements for which {{can be made in}} the user's own shop using ordinary O-ring stock, and it lasts a long time. The very few wear parts on the door are replaceable, making the autoclave a long-lived investment.|$|R
5000|$|The Mark 6 gun was {{constructed}} of gun steel using a tube, jacket, four hoops, a <b>locking</b> <b>ring,</b> and Welin breech block.
