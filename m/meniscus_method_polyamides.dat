40|$|Surface tention (ST) is a physical-chemical {{parameter}} {{that informs}} {{about the presence}} of surface-active agents (surfactants) in the aqueous environment. The article proposes to obtain experimentally ST (1 ST) time dependence of the controlled aqueous environment and to judge by the equilibrium ST value (EST) about the surfactant concentration in such an environment, based on the previously received calibration dependence of EST on the concentration of respective surfactant in the aqueous environment. EST dependence of controlled aqueous environment is recommended to get though ST measurements by pulsing <b>meniscus</b> <b>method</b> based on the measurement of maximum pressure in the bubble (MPB) without its separation. The essence of pulsing <b>meniscus</b> <b>method</b> has been described. The advantage of this method over usual MPB method is that in the process of obtaining 1 ST dependence and EST value one should use the same air meniscus surface at the end of metering capillary submerged in the sample of the investigated aqueous environment. It considerably speeds up the process of getting 1 ST dependence and EST value of aqueous environment.

40|$|The {{research}} underlaying {{this thesis}} involves synthesis and characterization of well-defined anionic graft copolymers carrying poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) side-chains. Two different grafting techniques were used. Backbone polymers were prepared through radical terpolymerization of maleic anhydride, styrene {{and an additional}} comonomer. Poly(ethylene oxide) monomethyl ether (MPEO) were grafted onto the backbone through reactions with the cyclic anhydride residues. The reaction rate {{was found to be}} dependent of both the neighbouring groups in the polymer backbone and the molecular weight of the MPEO. In the second <b>method,</b> <b>polyamide</b> 12 and poly(ethylene-co-vinyl alcohol) were used as backbone polymers. The amide and the hydroxyl groups were utilized as initiating sites for the anionic polymerization of ethylene oxide. The molecular weight of the grafts could be controlled by the ratios of the reactants used in the preparation. The PEO side-chains were endcapped by sulfonic acid groups, in a base-catalyzed ring-opening reaction between the hydroxyl groups and 1, 3 propane sultone.

The biodistribution data were analyzed by both non-com-partmental and compartmental pharmacokinetic models. Animal toxicity experiments were also performed by monitoring weight loss after a single subcutaneous (SC) injection of either polyamide.

40|$|The {{stresses}} {{acting in}} interfacial adsorption layers with surface shear elasticity are, in general, anisotropic and non-uniform. If a pendant drop or buoyant bubble {{is covered with}} such elastic layer, the components of surface tension acting along the "meridians" and "parallels", σ s and σ ϕ, can be different and, then, the conventional drop shape analysis (DSA) is inapplicable. Here, a method for determining σ s and σ ϕ is developed for axisymmetric <b>menisci.</b> This <b>method,</b> called 'capillary <b>meniscus</b> dynamometry' (CMD), is based on processing data for the digitized drop/bubble profile and capillary pressure. The principle of the CMD procedure for data processing is essentially {{different from that of}} DSA. Applying the tangential and normal surface stress balance equations, σ s and σ ϕ are determined in each interfacial point without using any rheological model. The computational procedure is fast and could be used in real time, during a given process. The method is applied to determine σ s and σ ϕ for bubbles and drops formed on the tip of a capillary immersed in solutions of the protein HFBII hydrophobin. Upon a surface compression, meridional wrinkles appear on the bubble surface below the bubble "equator", where the azimuthal tension σ ϕ takes negative values. The CMD method allows one to determine the local tensions acting in anisotropic interfacial layers (films, membranes), like those formed from proteins, polymers, asphaltenes and phospholipids.

Arthritic joints contain {{increased}} amounts of {{epidermal growth factor}} receptor (EGFR) protein, and polymorphisms in EGFR are associated with arthritis risk. The role of endogenous EGFR regulation during joint disease due to ligament and meniscal trauma is unknown. Mitogen-inducible gene 6 (MIG- 6) can reduce EGFR phosphorylation and downstream signaling. We examined the effect of EGFR modulation by MIG- 6 on joint disease development after ligament and <b>meniscus</b> injury. <b>Methods</b> Knee ligament transection and meniscus removal were performed surgically on mice homozygous for a global inactivating mutation in MIG- 6 (Mig- 6 −/−) and in wild-type (WT) animals. Results Two weeks after surgery, Mig- 6 −/− mice had bone erosion as well as greater fibrous tissue area and serum RANKL concentration than WT mice. Four weeks after surgery, Mig- 6 −/− mice had less cartilage and increased cell proliferation relative to contralateral control and WT knees. Increased apoptotic cells and growth outside the articulating region occurred in Mig- 6 −/− mice. Tibia trabecular bone mineral density (BMD) {{and the number of}} trabeculae were lower in surgically treated knees relative to the respective control knees for both groups. BMD, as well as trabecular thickness and number, were lower in surgically treated knees from Mig- 6 −/− mice relative to WT surgically treated knees. Phosphorylated EGFR staining in surgically treated knees decreased for WT mice and increased for Mig- 6 −/− mice. Fewer inflammatory cells were present in the knees of WT mice.

Questions/purposes The purpose of this study was to investigate whether mesenchymal stem cells existed in the synovial fluid of the knee after <b>meniscus</b> injury. <b>Methods</b> Synovial fluid was obtained from the knees of 22 patients with meniscus injury just before meniscus surgery and from 8 volunteers who had no history of knee injury. The cellular fraction of the synovial fluid was cul-tured for 14 days followed by analysis for multilineage potential and presentation of surface antigens characteristic of mesenchymal stem cells. Colony-forming efficiency and proliferation potential were also compared between the two groups. Results Cells with characteristics of mesenchymal stem cells were observed in the synovial fluid of injured knees to a much greater degree than in uninjured knees. The colony-forming cells derived from the synovial fluid of the knee with meniscus injury had multipotentiality and surface epitopes identical to mesenchymal stem cells. The average number of colony formation, obtained from 1 mL of synovial fluid, in meniscus-injured knees was 250, higher than that from healthy volunteers, which was 0. 5 (p 0. 001).

We estimated the GAG content (T 1 Gd) in the central weight-bearing parts of the medial and lateral femoral cartilage and compared results with a reference cohort (n= 24) with normal knees and no history of injury examined by dGEMRIC at one occasion previously. ResultsThe healthy reference group had longer T 1 Gd values compared with the ACL-injured patients at follow-up both medially: 428 ± 38 vs 363 ± 61 ms (P< 0. 0001) and laterally: 445 ± 41 vs 396 ± 48 ms (P= 0. 0002). At follow-up T 1 Gd was lower in meniscectomized patients compared to those without a meniscectomy, both medially (− 84 ms, P= 0. 002) and laterally (− 38 ms, P= 0. 05). In the injured group, the medial femoral cartilage showed similar T 1 Gd at the two dGEMRIC investigations: 357 ± 50 vs 363 ± 61 ms (P= 0. 57), whereas the lateral femoral cartilage T 1 Gd increased: 374 ± 48 vs 396 ± 48 ms (P= 0. 04). ConclusionsThe general decrease in cartilage T 1 Gd in ACL-injured patients compared with references provide evidence for structural matrix GAG changes that seem more pronounced if a concomitant meniscal injury is present. The fact that post-traumatic OA commonly develops in ACL-injured patients, in particularly those with meniscectomy, suggests that shorter T 1 Gd may be an early biomarker for OA...|$|R
40|$|Purpose. Ultrasonography (US) {{has been}} {{demonstrated}} {{to be an important}} tool in the diagnosis of calcium pyrophosphate (CPP) crystal deposition disease. The aim of our study was to individuate and describe possible pitfalls in US detection of such deposits in <b>menisci.</b> Patients and <b>Methods.</b> We enrolled all patients waiting to undergo knee replacement surgery due to osteoarthritis, for one-month period. Each patient underwent US examination of the knee, focusing on the menisci. After surgery, the menisci were examined by US, macroscopically and microscopically, using the microscopic analysis as the gold standard for CPP deposition. Results. 11 menisci of 6 patients have been studied. Ex vivo examination of menisci performed better in CPP identification than in vivo examination. The possible reasons of misinterpretation or misdiagnosis of the in vivo exam were identified and are extensively described in the paper. Also a new sign of CPP crystal deposits was found. Conclusions. This study permitted to highlight some difficulties in CPP crystal detection by US in menisci. Further studies are needed to define completely US CPP crystal aspect and to improve the sensibility and specificity of US in CPP deposition diagnosis...|$|R
40|$|The DNA {{recognition}} {{properties of}} minor groove-binding polyamides make them logical candidates {{for a number}} of biologically relevant applications and their scope of use is further expanded by the same structural features and synthetic accessibility that allowed their development from distamycin. The modular nature of polyamide structure and function, combined with amenability to solid phase synthesis, has facilitated the construction of polyamide conjugates bearing a diverse set covalently-linked chemical species. Polyamide-linked moieties have been employed to supplement the DNA recognition profile of polyamides (intercalator conjugates), to modify their biological activities (activator peptide conjugates), and to facilitate detection of targeted DNA sequences (fluorophore conjugates). The growing utility of fluorophore-polyamide conjugates is evidenced by their use in chromosome staining and cellular localization studies. The physical properties of these conjugates often show marked variations with respect to the covalent modification strategy employed as well as the chemical nature of the fluorophore. As a result, multiple iterations of conjugate design may be required, depending on the application envisioned. Chapter 2 summarizes the synthesis of structurally distinct classes of fluorophore-hairpin polyamide conjugates. The physical properties and immediate applications of these compounds are discussed in Chapters 3 and 4. Chemically distinct fluorescent probes and modification strategies are described, with an emphasis on the C-terminal tail and pyrrole N-methyl ring positions as sites for fluorophore attachment. 22 Background and Significance The ability of minor groove-binding polyamides to specifically target a wide range of predetermined DNA sequences with relatively high affinities logically suggests their use in the localization of other chemical species to particular sites on the DNA double helix. Another advantage offered by polyamides used in this role is their compatibility with condensed DNA structures and protein-DNA complexes, including chromosomes and nucleosome particles, without the need for sample pretreatment. Additionally, the development of solid phase <b>methods</b> for <b>polyamide</b> synthesis, with Boc 1 or Fmoc 2 protecting group strategies, on several chemical supports 1, 3, 4, has allowed a diverse set of molecules to be covalently linked to polyamides...|$|R
40|$|Background. The {{persistence}} of {{human immunodeficiency virus}} (HIV) type 1 within resting CD 4 + T cells poses a daunting therapeutic challenge. Histone deacetylase (HDAC) - 1, a chromatin-remodeling enzyme that can mediate gene silencing, is recruited to the HIV- 1 long terminal repeat by the host transcription factor LSF. Pyrroleimidazole polyamides, small molecules that target specific DNA sequences, can access the nucleus of cells and specifically block transcription-factor binding. <b>Methods.</b> We used <b>polyamides</b> to directly test the role of chromatin remodeling in HIV quiescence in primary resting CD 4 ^+ T cells obtained from HIV-infected patients. Results. After exposure to any of 4 different polyamides that specifically block HDAC- 1 recruitment by LSF to the HIV promoter, replication-competent HIV was recovered from cultures of resting CD 4 ^+ T cells in 6 of 8 HIV-infected patients whose viremia had been suppressed by therapy. In comparison, HIV was not recovered after exposure to control, mismatched polyamides but was recovered from 7 of 8 of these patients' samples after the activation of T cells. Conclusions. We identify histone deacetylation as a mechanism that can dampen viral expression in infected, activated CD 4 ^+ T cells and establish a persistent, quiescent reservoir of HIV infection...|$|R
