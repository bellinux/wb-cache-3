500|$|Ali {{learned that}} his {{regurgitation}} talents {{had the potential to}} entertain and to earn money through performance at the age of fifteen:I tried out my tricks first of all in the street, swallowing many glasses of water and then pouring forth a great fountain {{from one side of the}} road to the other... A cafe proprietor saw me doing this one day, and chased <b>me</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> street. I thought he wanted to beat me up, but no—all he did was to put a coin in my hand and ask me to repeat the trick. Finally, he was so delighted that he asked me to come to his cafe and entertain the customers. Taking his abilities on the road, Ali met an Italian man in Cairo who signed him to a contract for music hall performances. Ali performed under contract throughout Europe and at times for heads of state. According to Ali, in or about 1914 he was summoned by Tsar NicholasII of Russia to perform at the Winter Palace in Saint Petersburg, Russia. He stated that the Tsar [...] "must have liked my performance because he awarded me a special decoration, which is now one of my most treasured possessions." [...] Following World War I, Ali began managing his own affairs and toured the world, learning more tricks as he went.|$|E
