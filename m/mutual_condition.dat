5000|$|Following {{the success}} of the Grapple X/Round C {{experiment}} and joining the club of thermonuclear nations (the US and the USSR at the time), Britain launched negotiations with the US to join the US in a treaty situation in which both nations could share information and material to design, test and maintain their nuclear weapons. This effort culminated in the 1958 US-UK Mutual Defence Agreement. One of the results of that treaty was that Britain was allowed to use United States' Nevada Test Site for testing their designs and ideas, and received full support from the personnel there, in exchange for the data [...] "take" [...] from the experiment, a <b>mutual</b> <b>condition.</b> In effect the NTS became Britain's test ground, subject only to advanced planning and integrating their testing into that of the United States. This resulted in 24 tests with 24 devices tested underground at the NTS from 1958 through the end of nuclear testing in the US in September 1992.|$|E

40|$|In The Origins of Totalitarianism, Hannah Arendt criticises the “abstract nakedness” {{of human}} rights and the dangers of statelessness. She invokes the “right to have rights” as the only {{universal}} right, identifying the fundamental aporia {{of human rights}}: despite the claim to universality, rights are only ever granted to those belonging to particular political communities. Through the case of the French Sans-papiers, this paper addresses the question of statelessness by situating theories of “acts of citizenship” within a broader theoretical understanding of law. The aim is to develop a model of citizenship, where status and practice are seen as <b>mutual</b> <b>conditions</b> of (im) possibility. The practice of making rights-claims reveals the constitutive tension inherent to citizenship, where the universal rights from which its sovereignty is derived and its laws flow, cannot be contained within its borders.

40|$|Abstract. The {{question}} of what constraints must hold for a predicate to behave as a (partial) function, is key to understanding the behaviour of a logic program. It has been shown how this question can be answered by combining backward analysis, a form of analysis that propagates de-terminacy requirements against the control flow, with a component for deriving so-called <b>mutual</b> exclusion <b>conditions.</b> The latter infers condi-tions sufficient to ensure that if one clause yields an answer then another cannot. This paper addresses the challenge of how to compute these conditions by showing that this problem can be reformulated as that of vertex enumeration. Whilst directly applicable in logic programming, the method might well also find application in reasoning about type classes. ...|$|R
