40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Polyethylene (PE) resins being non-polar in nature and having {{a high degree of}} crystallinity have limited miscibility and compatibility when blended with polar polymers. The miscibility and compatibility of these blends are generally worsened when they are prepared by direct injection moulding without a precompounding process. Such situations are commonly encountered in particular by polymer converters when blending colour and/or additive concentrates, commonly known as <b>masterbatches.</b> Typically, <b>masterbatches</b> are mixtures containing high loading of pigments and/or additives predispersed in a suitable solid vehicle (commonly known as carrier) such as a polyethylene resin. These <b>masterbatches</b> are usually used for the colouration {{of a wide range of}} polymers and the carrier used must therefore be compatible with these matrix (host) polymers. The preliminary stage of this study involved the investigation of the properties of blends based on high density polyethylene (HDPE) and a range of engineering thermoplastics (ABS, PC, PBT, PA 6), prepared by injection moulding. Five different types of compatibilisers namely, ethylene-vinyl acetate (EVA) copolymer, ethylene-methyl acrylate (EMA) copolymer, ethylene-glycidyl methacrylate (E-GMA) copolymer, ethylene-methyl acrylateglycidyl methacrylate (E-MA-GMA) terpolymer and maleic anhydride grafted HDPE (HDPE-g-MAH) copolymer were evaluated with respect to their efficiencies in compatibilising HDPE with the four engineering polymers.

In the case of polyamide based nanocomposites PA 6 was found to produce the best dispersed nanocomposites followed by PA-MXD 6, PA- 6 I/ 6 T and PA- 6 - 3 -T. It was concluded from the results that surfactant/polymer compatibility and thermal stability play some role, but the most significant factor in effecting good dispersion was the polarity of the polymer and its ability to directly interact with the clay surface. The CO 2 retention of PET/PA blends showed MXD 6 to offer by far the greatest improvement (100 % increase) but the use of PA-MXD 6 nanocomposite did not result in further improvement.
