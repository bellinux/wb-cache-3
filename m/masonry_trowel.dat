Although it is often portrayed in popular culture as a weapon, the kunai was primarily used for gouging holes in walls.

A portable listening device (saoto hikigane) was used to eavesdrop on conversations and detect sounds.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} the participatory design process {{of a new}} bricklayer’s trowel. The process consisted of five steps: 1) identifying ergonomic problems, 2) generating ideas for new design, 3) evaluation of five test models, 4) Field-study to compare to prototypes with the traditional trowel en 5) Implementation of the new <b>trowel.</b> <b>Masonry</b> workers were involved in all steps of the process, except during step 2 generating ideas for new design. This project resulted in three new products: a totally new designed trowel, a redesign of the sabre and a redesign of the traditional trowel. The traditional trowel was also redesigned. The reason for this was that the new designed trowel would hardly {{be accepted by the}} current generation masonry workers, because it needs another working technique. The redesigned trowel fits the requirements of the masonry workers and from an ergonomically point of view it is better than the traditional trowel, but worse than the new design...|$|R

Grove City's Student Union building was honored with the International <b>Masonry</b> Institute's Golden <b>Trowel</b> Grand Prize for excellence in masonry design and construction in 2005. On February 9, 2011 Grove City College {{announced that it will}} break ground for construction of a science, engineering and mathematics building - key components of Grove City Matters: A Campaign to Advance Grove City College, which at $90 million is the largest capital campaign in the college's history. The $37.2-million science, engineering and mathematics building is designed to support new modes of teaching, particularly flexible laboratories and small-group interactions. It will help ensure that Grove City College continues to prepare students for future careers in an increasingly competitive work force, officials said. Even more construction projects, and renovations of existing buildings are planned for the next few years.|$|R
