Upon terms of reasonable equality, she supposed, that mutual confidence <b>might</b> <b>best</b> subsist; she said, that, as Mr Day had decidedly declared his determination to live in perfect seclusion from what is usually called the world, it was fit she should decidedly declare, {{that she would not}} change her present mode of life, with which she had no reason to be dissatisfied, for any dark and untried system, that could be proposed to her.|$|E
5|$|Whilst airport {{development}} in the UK is subject to local planning authority processes, the government regards airports as {{an important part of}} the national infrastructure and which therefore requires their development to be planned with a strategic approach. To support this, the government began a three-year public consultation process with the publication in December 2000 of The Future of Aviation consultation document. This outlined the issues underpinning air transport and sought views on how they should be addressed in any future policy. One of the main questions asked was whether policy should focus on meeting demand or whether it should focus instead on limiting the negative effects of air transport. Another key issue for which views were sought was how the industry <b>might</b> <b>best</b> meet the environmental costs it incurs. Between July 2002 and February 2003 a further seven regional consultation documents were published. These focussed on the economic, environmental, social and airspace appraisals relating to options for future airport development specific to the regions, and together they generated half a million responses. During the Spring of 2003 workshops based on a consultation document titled Aviation and the Environment - Using Economic Instruments were held to seek stakeholder views on the desirability and effectiveness of various financial measures that might address the environmental impacts of aviation. The consultation process ended in December 2003 with the publication of The Future of Air Transport White Paper which detailed the government's conclusions.|$|E

25|$|Mack {{noted that}} there was a {{worldwide}} history of visionary experiences, especially in pre-industrial societies. One example is the vision quest common to some Native American cultures. Only fairly recently in Western culture, notes Mack, have such visionary events been interpreted as aberrations or as mental illness. Mack suggested that abduction accounts <b>might</b> <b>best</b> be considered as part of this larger tradition of visionary encounters.|$|E
25|$|Friedländer is an Intentionalist on {{the origins}} of the Holocaust question. However, Friedländer rejects the extreme Intentionalist view that Adolf Hitler had a master plan going back to the time when he wrote Mein Kampf for the {{genocide}} of the Jewish people. Friedländer, through his research on the Third Reich, has reached the conclusion that there was no intention to exterminate the Jews of Europe before 1941. Friedländer's position <b>might</b> <b>best</b> be deemed moderate Intentionalist.|$|E

25|$|Lighting control tools <b>might</b> <b>best</b> be {{described}} as anything that changes {{the quality of the}} light. Historically this has been done by the use of intensity control. Technological advancements have made intensity control relatively simple - solid state dimmers are controlled by one or more lighting controllers. Controllers are commonly lighting consoles designed for sophisticated control over very large numbers of dimmers or luminaires, but may be simpler devices which play back stored sequences of lighting states with minimal user interfaces. Consoles are also referred to as lighting desks or light-boards.|$|E
25|$|Aphasia is best {{thought of}} as a {{collection}} of different disorders, rather than a single problem. Each individual with aphasia will present with their own particular combination of language strengths and weaknesses. Consequently, it is a major challenge just to document the various difficulties that can occur in different people, let alone decide how they <b>might</b> <b>best</b> be treated. Most classifications of the aphasias tend to divide the various symptoms into broad classes. A common approach is to distinguish between the fluent aphasias (where speech remains fluent, but content may be lacking, and the person may have difficulties understanding others), and the nonfluent aphasias (where speech is very halting and effortful, and may consist of just one or two words at a time).|$|E
25|$|One non-trivial {{example is}} the fractal {{dimension}} of a Koch snowflake. It has a topological dimension of 1, but {{it is by no}} means a rectifiable curve: the length of the curve between any two points on the Koch snowflake is infinite. No small piece of it is line-like, but rather it is composed of an infinite number of segments joined at different angles. The fractal dimension of a curve can be explained intuitively thinking of a fractal line as an object too detailed to be one-dimensional, but too simple to be two-dimensional. Therefore its dimension <b>might</b> <b>best</b> be described not by its usual topological dimension of 1 but by its fractal dimension, which in this case is a number between one and two.|$|E

25|$|In spring 1885 tension {{had been}} growing between Britain and Russia because of the Penjdeh {{incident}} in Afghanistan. This raised considerable concern in Australia of possible Russian raids on shipping, {{which could not be}} prevented by the small Australian squadron. The effect was to concentrate minds on the formation of a larger squadron financed by the colonies. Following orders from the Admiralty, Tryon argued the case that defence <b>might</b> <b>best</b> be achieved by a single strong squadron free to move around the whole area, rather than smaller squadrons paid for and attached to individual colonies. That local land forces could be provided to defend individual ports against raids, but that the best way of providing trained and up to date crews and ships for a naval force was to give the task to the Royal Navy rather than forming local ones. Colonies differed in their views on what was best, in particular New Zealand was concerned that part of the force ought permanently to be based at Auckland because of its distance from most of the others. Tryon proposed that a system of indemnity should be introduced, so that anyone whose property was destroyed resisting an attack would be compensated by the colonies as a whole, accepting that local resistance wherever it might occur was to the benefit of all. After the Russian scare had subsided, Tryon continued to assist with the development of land fortifications for major towns, emphasising the importance of preparedness in advance of any military situation arising, and of giving the impression of a united defence even if this had not in reality been entirely achieved.|$|E
500|$|Rhinehart {{describes}} the est {{training as a}} form of participatory theatre, writing: [...] "Seeing the trainer as a master actor ... permits us to evaluate his acts and words more intelligently than if we misinterpret him as being a scholar or scientist giving a lecture." [...] In an analysis of how to approach the est training, Rhinehart comments that [...] "It <b>might</b> <b>best</b> be described, if it can be described at all, as theater—as living theater, participatory theater, encounter theater. Once we begin to see est in these terms, much that fails to fit the scheme of therapy or religion or science begins to make sense." ...|$|E

Potter initially resisted the idea of colour illustrations, but then realized her stubborn stance was a mistake. She sent Warne [...] "several colour illustrations, along {{with a copy of}} her privately printed edition" [...] which Warne then handed to their eminent children's book illustrator L. Leslie Brooke for his professional opinion. Brooke was impressed with Potter's work. Fortuitously, his recommendation coincided with a sudden surge in the small picture-book market.|$|E

2500|$|As has {{recently}} been argued by Michael McKeon, Swift <b>might</b> <b>best</b> {{be described as a}} severe sceptic, rather than a Whig, Tory, empiricist, or religious writer. He supported the Classics in the Quarrel of the Ancients and the Moderns, and he supported the established church and the aristocracy, because he felt the alternatives were worse. He argued elsewhere that there is nothing inherently virtuous about a noble birth, but its advantages of wealth and education made the aristocrat a better ruler than the equally virtuous but unprivileged commoner. [...] A Tale of a Tub {{is a perfect example of}} Swift's devastating intellect at work. By its end, little seems worth believing in.|$|E
2500|$|Under the {{concepts}} of [...] Torts [...] under Anglo-American Common Law, these points <b>might</b> <b>best</b> {{be described as a}} defense of contributory negligence. In other words, Ms Calad and Mr. Davila might have prevented the damage to their person for which they are allowed no monetary damages in court if they had properly enforced their ERISA or THCLA rights against CIGNA and Aetna to prevent the injury from happening. The fact that ERISA had failed to prevent the harm, however, {{and the fact that it}} was ruled by the Supreme Court that neither CIGNA nor Aetna could owe monetary damages for their contribution to the harm done, shows that there is a need for change, either in ERISA itself by Congress or by Supreme Court common law.|$|E

2500|$|Another {{source of}} Ohthere's wealth was the hunting of whales and walrus. He is {{reported}} {{as saying that}} his own land was best for whale-hunting, with walrus up to 7ells long and whales mostly 50ells long, and that with five men he had killed sixty of them in two days. While the killing of this number of whales in two days seems unlikely, historian Kjell-Olav Masdalen suggests that, rather than whales, Ohthere intended the number killed to refer to walrus; Janet Bately suggests that it <b>might</b> <b>best</b> {{be seen as an}} indication of how many whales could be caught in good conditions. Ropes of whale skin were of sufficient value {{to be included in the}} tax paid to Ohthere by the Sami, and Ohthere said that walrus had [...] "very noble bones in their teeth", some of which he brought to King Alfred.|$|E

[...] Parents began to see that there would be an alternative, however: [...] "Since worry did no good and quarantine seemed fruitless, parents <b>might</b> <b>best</b> protect their children by helping others to discover a vaccine against polio, and, perhaps, even a cure." [...] The public soon realized that this kind of research demanded [...] "big money" [...] and an [...] "army of devoted volunteers", but Salk was determined to make it over this barrier.|$|E

It was the first time Rand had worked with a publisher whose executives seemed truly enthusiastic about one of her books.|$|E
