5|$|Gomphus clavatus is edible; it {{is rated}} as choice by some, while others find it tasteless. It has an earthy flavor and <b>meaty</b> texture {{that has been}} {{regarded}} as suiting red meat dishes. Like many edible fungi, consumption may cause gastrointestinal distress in susceptible individuals. The flesh becomes bitter with age, and older specimens may be infested with insects. Insect infestation is unlikely {{if the weather is}} cool. G.clavatus has been used for cooking for some time—Fries included it in his 1867 book Sveriges ätliga och giftiga svampar (Edible and Poisonous Mushrooms in Sweden). It is highly regarded by the Zapotec people of Ixtlán de Juárez in Oaxaca, Mexico, and the Sherpa people in the vicinity of Sagarmatha National Park in Nepal.|$|E
5|$|Mould fungi are {{the source}} of the <b>meaty</b> (umami) flavour of the soybean {{products}} tempeh, miso and soy sauce. Tempeh has been produced in Java since the 13th century. Like tofu, it is made into protein-rich blocks, but these have a firm texture and earthy flavour, since (unlike tofu) the whole beans are retained, providing a higher content of dietary fibre and vitamins. Miso too is rich in protein, vitamins and minerals. It is fermented from a mixture of soybeans and cereals, forming a soft paste used to flavour soups and other Japanese dishes. Soy sauce has been used in China since the 2nd century AD, and is now widespread in Asia. Like miso, it is made by fermenting a mixture of soybeans and cereals with moulds such as Aspergillus oryzae.|$|E
5|$|Selective {{breeding}} for desired traits {{was established}} as a scientific practice by Robert Bakewell during the British Agricultural Revolution in the 18th century. One of his most important breeding programs was with sheep. Using native stock, {{he was able to}} quickly select for large, yet fine-boned sheep, with long, lustrous wool. The Lincoln Longwool was improved by Bakewell and in turn the Lincoln was used to develop the subsequent breed, named the New (or Dishley) Leicester. It was hornless and had a square, <b>meaty</b> body with straight top lines. These sheep were exported widely and have contributed to numerous modern breeds. Under his influence, English farmers began to breed cattle for use primarily as beef. Long-horned heifers were crossed with the Westmoreland bull to create the Dishley Longhorn.|$|E
50|$|In 1993, Purefoods renamed {{their team}} to the Coney Island Ice Cream Stars, while RFM's team stayed as the Swift Mighty <b>Meaties.</b> In the first conference All-Filipino Cup, the Stars swept the Mighty <b>Meaties,</b> 3-0 in the {{semifinal}} series, and won the All-Filipino Cup Finals. In the second conference, the Commissioners Cup, the Mighty <b>Meaties</b> brought in new recruits: shooting forward Vergel Meneses, center Zaldy Realubit and with import Ronnie Thompkins. The Mighty <b>Meaties</b> battled Purefoods' team, renamed the Purefoods Oodles, in the conference finals; the Mighty <b>Meaties</b> won the best-of-seven series 4-2.|$|R
50|$|In 1992, Purefoods TJ Hotdogs traded Nelson Asaytono to the RFM Swift Mighty <b>Meaties</b> for {{a future}} draft pick. In their last matchup during the First Conference {{elimination}} round, the Mighty <b>Meaties</b> beat the Hotdogs 115-114. As a result, both teams finish with conference records of 5-6, and had a one-game playoff on March 26. The Mighty <b>Meaties</b> beat the Hotdogs, 123-117, and qualified for the semifinals. In the All-Filipino Conference, Purefoods won all three matches against the Swift Mighty <b>Meaties</b> and in their elimination round victory over Swift on July 2, the Tender Juicy Hotdogs overcame Nelson Asaytono's career-high of 48 points in a 110-106 win. Swift simply dominated their rivals during the third conference with the Mighty <b>Meaties,</b> having Tony Harris as their import, they beat the Hotdogs in all their four meetings.|$|R
50|$|In the 1994 All-Filipino cup, the Purefoods team, the Coney Island Ice Cream Stars {{played the}} RFM team, still named the Swift Mighty <b>Meaties,</b> in a post-semifinals playoff game. The Stars beat the <b>Meaties</b> 86-74 {{to advance to}} their seventh All-Filipino finals appearance.|$|R
5|$|The flavour {{has been}} {{described}} as nutty and slightly <b>meaty,</b> with a smooth, creamy texture, and a distinctive aroma reminiscent of sourdough. Young, small porcini are most appreciated by gourmets, as the large ones often harbour maggots (insect larvae), and become slimy, soft and less tasty with age. Fruit bodies are collected by holding the stipe near the base and twisting gently. Cutting the stipe with a knife may risk the part left behind rotting and the mycelium being destroyed. Peeling and washing are not recommended. The fruit bodies are highly perishable, due largely to the high water content (around 90%), the high level of enzyme activity, and the presence of a flora of microorganisms. Caution should be exercised when collecting specimens from potentially polluted or contaminated sites, as several {{studies have shown that the}} fruit bodies can bioaccumulate toxic heavy metals like mercury, cadmium, caesium and polonium. Bioaccumulated metals or radioactive fission decay products are like chemical signatures: chemical and radiochemical analysis can be used to identify the origin of imported specimens, and for long-term radioecological monitoring of polluted areas.|$|E
5|$|Yeasts {{have been}} used since ancient times to leaven bread and to ferment beer and wine. More recently, mould fungi have been {{exploited}} to create {{a wide range of}} industrial products, including enzymes and drugs. Medicines based on fungi include antibiotics, immunosuppressants, statins and many anti-cancer drugs. The yeast species Saccharomyces cerevisiae is an important model organism in cell biology. The fruiting bodies of some larger fungi are collected as edible mushrooms, including delicacies like the chanterelle, cep, and truffle, while a few species are cultivated. Mould fungi provide the <b>meaty</b> (umami) flavour of fermented soybean products such as tempeh, miso and soy sauce, and contribute flavour and colour to blue cheeses including Roquefort and Stilton. Moulds also yield vegetarian meat substitutes like Quorn. Some fungi, especially the fly agaric and psilocybin mushrooms are used for the psychoactive drugs that they contain; these in particular are the focus of academic study in the field of ethnomycology.|$|E
25|$|Asian arowanas are {{carnivorous}} {{and should}} be fed a high-quality diet of <b>meaty</b> food, such as shrimp and crickets. They are surface feeders and prefer to take food in the upper parts of the water column. Aquarists recommend live foods and <b>meaty</b> prepared foods. Examples of appropriate live foods include scorpions, centipedes, mealworms, crickets, shrimps, feeder fish, small frogs, and earthworms. Prepared foods include prawns (shrimp), lean pork, frozen fish food, and pelleted food. Some captive arowanas are fed Koi fry {{in an attempt to}} increase the vibrancy of their natural coloration.|$|E

25|$|Contrary {{to popular}} belief, Colek {{is not just}} a dipping sauce, but can also refer to a snack eaten with the sauce. Colek comes in various forms, {{including}} <b>meaty</b> cholek, colek ayam (chicken), colek perut (cow tripe), colek pelepong (cow or lamb lung; usually fried plain), and also a variety of colek buah(fruits; usually unmatured, thus crunchy and taste sour) such as colek pauh (mango).|$|E

25|$|MSG {{is used in}} {{the food}} {{industry}} as a flavor enhancer with an umami taste that intensifies the <b>meaty,</b> savory flavor of food, as naturally occurring glutamate does in foods such as stews and meat soups. It was first prepared in 1908 by Japanese biochemist Kikunae Ikeda, who was trying to isolate and duplicate the savory taste of kombu, an edible seaweed used as a base for many Japanese soups. MSG as a flavor enhancer balances, blends, and rounds the perception of other tastes.|$|E
25|$|In a {{study of}} a nest in urban São Paulo, {{it was noted that}} the swallow-tailed hummingbird mother drove away ruddy ground doves (Columbina talpacoti) {{attempting}} to nest nearby. Far more placid, cumbersome and <b>meaty</b> birds than the hummingbird, these small doves often become prey to smaller carnivores, and by chasing away the doves the hummingbird would have lowered attractiveness to its nest's surroundings to such predators. Smaller mammals, such as the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) may occasionally plunder swallow-tailed hummingbird nests, despite the birds' attempts to defend their offspring.|$|E

25|$|In the kitchen, tempeh {{is often}} {{prepared}} by cutting it into pieces, soaking in brine or salty sauce, and then frying. Cooked tempeh can be eaten alone, or used in chili, stir fries, soups, salads, sandwiches, and stews. Tempeh's complex flavor {{has been described}} as nutty, <b>meaty,</b> and mushroom-like. It freezes well, and is now commonly available in many western supermarkets, as well as in ethnic markets and health food stores. Tempeh performs well in a cheese grater, after which it may be used in the place of ground beef (as in tacos). When thin-sliced and deep-fried in oil, tempeh obtains a crisp golden crust while maintaining a soft interior—its sponge-like consistency makes it suitable for marinating. Dried tempeh (whether cooked or raw) is more portable and less perishable and may be used as a stew base. Sometimes when tempeh is diced and left, they will create white feathery fluff which bonds the cut—this is the Rhizopus mold still growing—this is normal and perfectly edible.|$|E
500|$|Five Finger Death Punch {{has been}} {{described}} as heavy metal, groove metal, thrash metal, alternative metal and hard rock.
