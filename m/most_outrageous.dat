25|$|Between 1936 and 1938, {{three very}} large Moscow Trials of former senior Communist Party leaders were held, {{in which they}} were accused of conspiring with fascist and {{capitalist}} powers to assassinate Stalin and other Soviet leaders, dismember the Soviet Union and restore capitalism.

25|$|If I were to {{say that}} the {{so-called}} philosophy of this fellow Hegel is a colossal piece of mystification which will yet provide posterity with an inexhaustible theme for laughter at our times, that it is a pseudo-philosophy paralyzing all mental powers, stifling all real thinking, and, by the <b>most</b> <b>outrageous</b> misuse of language, putting in its place the hollowest, most senseless, thoughtless, and, as is confirmed by its success, most stupefying verbiage, I should be quite right.|$|E
25|$|Like her ever-present {{bunches of}} gladioli, {{one of the}} most popular and {{distinctive}} features of Edna's stage and TV appearances has been her extravagant wardrobe, with gaudy, custom-made gowns that satirically outdo the <b>most</b> <b>outrageous</b> creations of Hollywood showbiz designers such as Bob Mackie.

25|$|After Catiline's death, many of {{the poor}} still {{regarded}} him with respect and did not view him as the traitor and villain that Cicero claimed he was. The aristocratic element of Rome, however, certainly viewed him in a much darker light. Sallust wrote {{an account of the}} conspiracy that epitomized Catiline as representative of all of the evils festering in the declining Roman republic. In his account, Sallust attributes countless crimes and atrocities to Catiline, but even he refuses to heap some of the <b>most</b> <b>outrageous</b> claims on him, particularly a ritual that involved drinking blood of a sacrificed child. Later historians such as Florus and Dio Cassius, far removed from the original events, recorded the claims of Sallust and the aforementioned rumors as facts. Up until the modern era Catiline was equated, as Sallust described, to everything depraved and contrary to both the laws of the gods and men.|$|E

50|$|As {{a result}} of its remote {{geographic}} location residents of Rockport, especially women, were lacking economically and intellectually. All but illiterate, Hannah and the other villagers were informed of news events, twice a week with the arrival of The Gloucester Telegraph, a newspaper that was delivered by stagecoach to Rockport. Editorials that were in discussion during this time period were of slavery in the United States and the shameful extravagances of the people of New York City and of Paris, France. The women of Rockport, and notably Hannah, became increasingly agitated of the lavish spending of what was vogue in Paris and the disgraceful overindulgence exemplified by American women of wealth. The ladies were offended by the newspaper's advertisements which flaunted such luxuries. But the <b>most</b> shameful, <b>outrageous</b> expense of all to Hannah and her gang, according to the author Parsons, was the more than four and half million dollars the country frittered away on wines and liquors.|$|R

[...] Variety critic Brian Lowry considered the opening sequence to be {{the best part of the}} episode. M. Keith Booker, author of the book Drawn to Television: Primetime Television from The Flintstones to Family Guy, called the opening sequence an [...] "...in-your-face, I-told-you-so rejoinder to the Fox brass followed by one of the <b>most</b> <b>outrageous</b> Family Guy episodes ever".|$|E
500|$|Rowland was {{assigned}} to the Pathfinder Force that marked targets for other aircraft on strategic bombing missions over Europe. Considered an exceptional pilot, he became a master bomber with No.635 Squadron RAF in 1944. As a master bomber, his role was to arrive ahead of the main Allied force, check that flares marking the target were in place, and warn his fellows if they were bombing inaccurately. No.635 Squadron operated Lancasters, a type that, Rowland recalled, [...] "would forgive sprog pilots doing the <b>most</b> <b>outrageous</b> things to it, and would even bring them home with quite large bits shot off it".|$|E
50|$|This {{tradition}} {{continued to}} evolve, {{and eventually the}} parots were dressed with clothing to look like people—these were the first ninots, with features identifiable as being those of a well-known person from the neighborhood often added as well.

Their intricate assemblages, placed on top of pedestals for better visibility, depict famous personalities and topical subjects of the past year, presenting humorous and often satirical commentary on them.|$|R

"Therefore, in his {{ordinary}} tone, only {{a little}} broken by the bodily exhaustion he was temporarily in, he answered him saying that sweeping the deck was not his business, {{and he would not}} do it. And then, without at all alluding to the shovel, he pointed to three lads, as the customary sweepers; who, not being billeted at the pumps, had done little or nothing all day.

500|$|Several {{media outlets}} {{described}} [...] "An Elephant Makes Love to a Pig" [...] {{as one of}} the most popular early South Park episodes.

Many reviewers said the mere title demonstrated the crudeness and originality of South Park, then still a relatively new show.

500|$|This {{case was}} blunted by a 1995 National Intelligence Estimate (NIE), which stated that no country besides the five major nuclear powers {{was capable of}} {{acquiring}} missiles that could reach Canada or the contiguous United States within the ensuing 15 years.

500|$|Radio DJ Kenny Everett {{first met}} Mercury in 1974 when he invited the singer onto his breakfast show on Capital London. As two of Britain's <b>most</b> flamboyant, <b>outrageous</b> and best-loved entertainers, they shared {{much in common}} and {{instantly}} became close friends. Everett would {{play a major role}} in Queen's early success when, in 1975, armed with an advance copy of the single [...] "Bohemian Rhapsody", Mercury went to see Everett. While privately Everett doubted any station would play the song due to its length at over 6 minutes, he said nothing to Mercury and placed the song on the turntable, and, after hearing it, enthused: [...] "forget it, it's going to be number one for centuries". While Capital Radio hadn't officially accepted the song, the anarchic Everett would talk incessantly about a record he had but couldn't play, before the song [...] "accidentally" [...] started playing, with Everett stating: [...] "Oops, my finger must've slipped." [...] Capital's switchboard was jammed with callers wanting to know when the song was going to be released – on one occasion Everett aired the song 36 times in one day.|$|R
