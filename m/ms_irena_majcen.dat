It {{became clear}} {{in the course of}} our inquiry into EU-Russia {{relations}} that the current confrontation is driven both by Russian domestic and political considerations and the geopolitical ambitions of the current Russian administration. Even a settlement in Ukraine will not guarantee that the Union will be able return to harmonious relations with Russia. Therefore, the future of EU-Russia relations, the security of neighbours such as Ukraine, Georgia and Moldova, as well as the long-term alignment of countries such as Azerbaijan and Armenia—neither of which, in the words of Professor Elena Korosteleva, Mr Igor Merheim-Eyre, Ms Eske Van Gils and <b>Ms</b> <b>Irena</b> Mnatsakanyan, Global Europe Centre, University of Kent, “enjoys very close relations with the EU”—remain in the balance.|$|R

Material {{comminution}} {{is one of}} {{the typical}} processes present during the injection abrasive water jet generation inside the mixing chamber and the focussing tube of the abrasive water jet cutting head. The determination of an extent of changes in the size of particles induced in the cutting head is the main objective of this contribution. Knowledge of the particle size at the exit from the cutting head is necessary for studying of the subsequent processes, e. g. the impingement of water jet with industrial mineral particles on a solid-state target or collision of such water jet with liquid barrier or opposite flowing jet of the same type...|$|R
40|$|V článku uvedeno: Libor <b>M.</b> Hlaváč, <b>Irena</b> <b>M.</b> HlaváčováThe {{paper is}} dealing with {{abrasive}} water jet (AWJ) cutting of titanium and titanium–niobium alloy. It contains comparison of the experimental results with values calculated from a previously derived theoretical model describing {{the interaction between the}} AWJ and cut material using the limit values of traverse speed, limit depth of cut and limit angle. The attention is paid mainly to the angle of striations created on the walls by abrasive water jet cutting. For lower traverse rates, {{it was found that the}} angle of striations is greater than in theoretical expectations. The influence of bigger but slower peripheral abrasive particles in the AWJ outside layer is discussed as the most probable explanation of this phenomenon. Comparison of the results calculated from the theoretical model and the experiment show a very good correlation, especially when a correction, resulting from the explanation of the striation angle increase for low traverse speeds, is incorporated into the theoretical model.

Copper samples, {{processed}} by equal channel angular pressing (ECAP), were cut using abrasive water jet (AWJ) and the cut walls were investigated. The {{aim was to}} prove a relation between AWJ declination angle and selected material properties, especially hardness, strength, and grain size. Three groups of samples were cut: the first one just after pressing (fresh samples), the second one after 1 month past ECAP application, and the third one after 6 months after ECAP processing. The comparison shows the following results. Just after the ECAP process, the declination angle increases with increasing number of passes through the ECAP die, i. e., the characteristic material properties (strength and hardness) increase throughout the tested angle range. The character of relations between number of passes and investigated parameters, such as declination angle, hardness, or strength, is parabolic for 1 -month-old samples, with maximum around eight ECAP passes. The last group of samples, cut after 6 months after their preparation, does not indicate simple relations between number of ECAP passes and either the declination angle or material parameters, namely hardness. The mutual comparison of a theoretical model based on values of material properties from measurements and literature and experiment shows maximum relative uncertainty 5. 9 %. This result proves that declination angle measurement on striations present on cut walls of AWJ {{can be used for}} evaluation of hardness, strength, and grain size.

The taper, {{inclination}} of {{cut side}} walls, {{is one of}} the characteristic phenomena of the abrasive water jet (AWJ) cutting. The taper represents a serious problem in shape cutting, especially in corners and curvatures. However, deviation of the side walls occurs even in the straight line parts of trajectories. Some differences from character typical for metal cutting have been noticed when studying the rock materials. This article is aimed at the experimental research of the cut walls taper on several rock materials with different genesis and composition. The topic of this contribution to the common knowledge is pointing out the most important differences compared to previous research made mainly on metals. The widths of slots made in plan-parallel plates of rock materials were measured both on the top and on the bottom. The difference between these widths has been used for evaluation of the taper—the angle of the cut walls inclination. The results were compared with the regression equation obtained from experimental results on metals and presented in past. The discrepancy between new findings and previously determined equation is discussed and the most probable explanations are submitted. Web of Science 881 - 444944...|$|R

Objectives The {{contribution}} {{deals with}} a risk assessment in practical applications of the high-energy liquid jet technology {{from the point of}} view of the risk identification, estimation and evaluation. Materials and Methods Differences between three different types of workplaces are highlighted and analysed — the indoor, the outdoor and the research ones. Theoretical analyses are supported by particular application of the method for the risk assessment in the Laboratory of Liquid Jets at the VŠB — Technical University of Ostrava. This laboratory is primarily oriented to research. Nevertheless, the conclusions can be used also for predominantly commercial workplaces. Results Some new considerations and evaluations concerning health and safety are presented. Conclusions Failure Mode and Effect Analysis (FMEA) procedures were applied and their limitations in risk assessment of water jet-based technologies are explained. Web of Science 25437436...|$|R
40|$|V článku uvedeno Hlaváč, Libor <b>M.,</b> Hlaváčová <b>Irena</b> <b>M.</b> The {{abrasive}} {{water jet}} (AWJ) taper inside the cut material {{is one of}} the characteristic phenomena of the AWJ cutting. The taper, together with a retardation of the jet inside the kerf, causes deformation of workpieces, especially in corners and curvatures. Some deviations of the side walls from the plains perpendicular to the material surface can be observed and measured even in the straight line parts of trajectories. This paper is aimed at experimental research of this phenomenon on steels because precision cutting of stainless and hard steels with thicknesses over 10 mm is a serious problem in practice, and the AWJ cutting can solve this problem quite well. The experiments were performed on three sets of steel plates with thicknesses close to 30 mm. The steels of the first and the second set were identical (1. 2379, 1. 3343, 1. 4307, 1. 4404 and 1. 4845). The steels of the first set were cut in their normal states, and the steels of the second set were subjected to cooling in the liquid nitrogen prior to cutting (marked 1. abcd/N). The third set of samples consisted of steels with very different composition and brittle/ductile behaviour cut in their normal states (1. 0036, 1. 2767, 1. 3379, 1. 7225 and 1. 7733). The model for calculation of the limit traverse speed from both the jet parameters and material properties has been used for determination of the proper traverse speed scale. The widths of the cuts were measured both on the top and {{on the bottom of the}} slots. The difference between these widths has been used for evaluation of the inclination angle, i. e. the wall deviation from the plane perpendicular to the material surface, referred also as the taper. This angle can be used for determination of the tilting angle for compensation of the negative influence on workpiece. The influence of brittle/ductile behaviour and the influence of cooling in liquid nitrogen have been tried to find out. The results were also compared with the theoretical relationship between traverse speed and inclination angle (the taper) on steels presented as a result of previous investigations in scientific articles. The difference between the inlet and the outlet width of kerf made by AWJ in tested steels ranges from 5. 2 to 35. 4 % for the traverse speed of 5 mm min− 1 and from 25. 5 to 44. 9 % for the traverse speed of 50 mm min− 1.

40|$|Purpose: Elevation of {{intracranial}} pressure (ICP) {{is a major}} complication of traumatic brain injury (TBI), and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) volume is {{a key factor in}} ICP regulation. Choroidal epithelial cells (CEC) form the blood–CSF barrier and their integrity is essential for controlling CSF production. In the current study, the morphology of the CEC was studied from 5 h to 28 day after TBI in the rat. Methods: Male Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to severe TBI using the impact-acceleration model, and the ultrastructure of the CEC was studied using transmission (TEM) and scanning (SEM) electron microscopy. Results: Radical ultrastructural changes were seen by TEM in CEC in injured animals. At 5 h post-injury cell swelling and incipient cytoplasmic vacuoles were seen. At 24 h most severe changes were noted with extensive widening of intercellular clefts. At 7 day and 14 day post-injury, increased cytoplasmic electron density was evident. At 21 day, most microvilli had bulbous ends, and at 28 day cytoplasmic vacuoles were numerous with widened intercellular clefts. SEM revealed a continuum of changes in all injured animals and most conspicuous was the heterogeneity of surface features, with most cells showing bulbous and cup-shaped microvilli, burr-like processes and pits. Epiplexus cells were hypertrophic and more numerous. Conclusion At 4 weeks after trauma, choroidal epithelial cells continued to show morphological alterations suggesting that brain homeostasis was still not restored. Mounir N.
