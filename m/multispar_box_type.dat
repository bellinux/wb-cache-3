40|$|In {{this paper}} present a water white <b>box</b> <b>type</b> solar cooker has been designed, fabricated, tested and {{compared}} the performance with the conventional <b>box</b> <b>type</b> solar cooker. A 5 mm thick water white glass {{is used in}} the double glazing cover of the new <b>box</b> <b>type</b> solar cooker. And the single reflector consists of a wooden framed commercially available plane mirror which is sized to form a cover for box when not in use. And other the conventional <b>box</b> <b>type</b> solar cooker having same shape and material but the glazing glass is of 4 mm thick simple glass. The performance testing and comparison were done experimentally. Both the cookers are tested simultaneously during summer season in the month of April at Jabalpur. A series of outdoor experiments were performed to obtain first and second figure of merits F 1 and F 2. The first figure of merit is obtain under no load condition resulted as F 1 is 0. 144 and 0. 11 for new and conventional solar cooker respectively. Under the full load condition the second figure of merit is calculated as F 2 = 0. 34 & 0. 26 for new and conventional cooker respectively. By these results we can analyze by comparing the values of F 1 and F 2 that the improvement in every part of cooker will give us better results so further improvement will be helpful for better performance of the <b>box</b> <b>type</b> solar cooker...|$|R

40|$|Drain {{covering}} is {{the most}} widely used option to try to mitigate the environmental problems that arise around the drains. The main problems which lead to a perceived need to cover a drain are: to minimize the adverse impact of a polluted drain, especially close to residential areas; need to use the land area occupied by the drain for an access road or some other use and poor soil stability leading to bank failure. The drain covering cross section can take several forms such as box section (square or rectangular) or concrete pipes. In this paper a new approach is suggested for covering. This approach is constructing as a bridge which consists of two abutments from brick on plain concrete footing and reinforced concrete slab. There are holes at certain distance to carry out maintenance works. Its parts are designed according to different live load cases and for spans 1 - 5 m. Design curves are designed for the new approach of covering in Egypt area. Design curves include design of each part of the new approach. This approach is applied for a drain which is covered as a pipe type and another drain which is covered as <b>box</b> <b>type.</b> The hydraulic and economic study is done for this approach. Head losses are calculated for pipe, <b>box</b> <b>types</b> and for the new approach. It is found that the head losses for the new approach is less than pipe type by 98 % and less than <b>box</b> <b>type</b> by 97. 8 %. The cost of pipe, <b>box</b> <b>types</b> and for the new approach is calculated. It is found that the cost of the new approach is more than pipe type by 49 % and more than <b>box</b> <b>type</b> by 27 %...|$|R
