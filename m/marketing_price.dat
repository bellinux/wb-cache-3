Urfa commodity market during the summer of 2004. A randomized complete block design with three factors and four replications (grain buyers) was employed. Factor A`, three widely grown durum wheat varieties (Urfa- 2005, Firat- 93 and Aydin- 93), Factor B, the five various grading factors [yellow berry (YB), red bread wheat content (RBW), dark red bread wheat content (DRBW), sunn pest damaged kernel content (SP) and combinations of all above factors (combined effect) ] and Factor C, content ratios (2. 5, 5. 0, 7. 5 and 10 %) were utilized. The results, obtained from variance analysis, indicated that all sources of variation turned out to be statistically significant. The grain buyers had different purchasing criteria depending on their needs. Some durum wheat varieties were offered higher prices due to good semolina or bulgur color reputation in macaroni and bulgur industry. Grading factors under study had different effects on <b>marketing</b> <b>price</b> of durum wheat. <b>Marketing</b> <b>price</b> reduced as content ratios of all grading factors in durum wheat increased. It was found that combined effect could reduce the <b>marketing</b> <b>price</b> as much as $ 41 ton - 1, SP damage; $ 36 ton - 1, DRBW; $ 23 ton - 1, RBW; $ 13 ton - 1 and YB; $ 9 ton - 1. The regressions between marketing prices vs. all grading factors were found to be statistically significant and the regression equations with high coefficients of determination (R 2 %) described the variations in <b>marketing</b> <b>price</b> and can be used for <b>marketing</b> <b>price</b> estimations adequately. It was concluded that durum wheat purchasing criteria in the South East of Anatolia was somewhat different from those of Turkish Grain Board and some international markets. Some of down grading factors such as sunn pest damage and the presence of dark red or red bread wheat kernels must be added into national standards of Turkey and similar Middle East countries. Growing of bread wheat varieties with dark red or red kernels should be limited to avoid <b>marketing</b> <b>price</b> reductions in Middle East countries in which bulgur is common food...|$|E

50|$|In an {{empirical}} study, Martin Spann, Marc Fischer and Gerard Tellis analyze the prevalence and choice of dynamic pricing strategies {{in a highly}} complex branded market, consisting of 663 products under 79 brand names of digital cameras. They find that, despite numerous recommendations in the literature for skimming or penetration <b>pricing,</b> <b>market</b> <b>pricing</b> dominates in practice. In particular, the authors find five patterns: skimming (20% frequency), penetration (20% frequency), and three variants of market-pricing patterns (60% frequency), where new products are launched at <b>market</b> <b>prices.</b> Skimming pricing launches the new product 16% above the <b>market</b> <b>price</b> and subsequently increases the price relative to the <b>market</b> <b>price.</b> Penetration pricing launches the new product 18% below the <b>market</b> <b>price</b> and subsequently lowers the price relative to the <b>market</b> <b>price.</b> Firms exhibit a mix of these pricing paths across their portfolios. The specific pricing paths correlate with market, firm, and brand characteristics such as competitive intensity, market pioneering, brand reputation, and experience effects.|$|R
40|$|Background: Price {{promotions}} are {{a promising}} intervention for encouraging healthier food purchasing. We aimed {{to assess the}} impact of a targeted direct <b>marketing</b> <b>price</b> promotion combined with healthy eating advice and recipe suggestions on the purchase of selected healthier foods by low income consumers.   Methods: We conducted a randomised controlled trial (n = 53 367) of a direct <b>marketing</b> <b>price</b> promotion (Buywell) combined with healthy eating advice and recipe suggestions for low income consumers identified as ‘less healthy’ shoppers. Impact was assessed using electronic point of sale data for UK low income shoppers before, during and after the promotion.   Results: The proportion of customers buying promoted products in the intervention month increased by between 1. 4 % and 2. 8 % for four of the five products. There was significantly higher uptake in the promotion month (P < 0. 001) for the intervention group than would have been expected on the basis of average uptake in the other months. When product switching was examined for semi-skimmed/skimmed milk, a modest increase (1 %) was found in the intervention month of customers switching from full-fat to low-fat milk. This represented 8 % of customers who previously bought only full-fat milk. The effects were generally not sustained after the promotion period.   Conclusions: Short-term direct <b>marketing</b> <b>price</b> promotions combined with healthy eating advice and recipe suggestions targeted at low income consumers are feasible and can have a modest impact on short-term food-purchasing behaviour, although further approaches are needed to help sustain these changes...|$|E

40|$|Liberalization in {{commodity}} markets {{has brought}} profound {{changes in the}} way price risks are allocated and managed in commodity subsectors. Price risks are increasingly allocated to private traders and farmers rather than absorbed by the government. The success of market reform depends on the ability of the emerging private sector to make full use of the available range of modern commodity <b>marketing,</b> <b>price</b> risk management and financing instruments. Because farmers do not generally have access to these instruments, intermediaries must be developed. Larger private traders and banks are {{in the best position to}} become these intermediaries. Preconditions needed for accessing modern commodity <b>marketing,</b> <b>price</b> risk management, and financing instruments are: a) creating an appropriate legal, regulatory, and institutional framework; b) reducing government intervention; c) providing training and raising awareness; and d) improving creditworthiness and reducing performance risk. The use of commodity derivative instruments to hedge commodity price risk is not new. The private sectors in many Asian and Latin American countries have been using commodity futures and options for some time. More recently, commodity derivative instruments are being used increasingly in several African countries and many economies in transition. And several developing and transition economies have sought to establish commodity derivative exchanges.
