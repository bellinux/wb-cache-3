25|$|The second defender is for {{security}} {{if the first}} defender is passed. In that case, he takes over as first defender, and ideally one of the third defenders takes over as second defender. The team should be organised in a manner to make this transition as fast as possible. The typical ideal distance between the second and first defender is about six metres, but this will vary strongly from situation to situation. The most important factor is the opponent's speed. If he's <b>moving</b> <b>fast,</b> the distance should be longer. If he's standing still, the second and first defender may in some cases join forces and work as two first defenders.|$|E

25|$|It is {{important}} that the gas mixture in a cylinder is thoroughly mixed before analysing or the results will be inaccurate. When partial pressure or mass blending is done at low flow rates the gases entering the cylinder are not <b>moving</b> <b>fast</b> enough to ensure good mixing, and particularly when blends contain Helium, they may tend to remain in layers due to density differences. This is termed stratification, and if left long enough, diffusion will ensure complete mixing. However, if the gas is to be analysed soon after blending, mechanical agitation is recommended. This may be by lying a single cylinder on a flat surface and rolling it for a short period, but twins are more usually inverted a few times. Stratification is more pronounced with blends containing helium, but can also lead to inaccurate analysis of Nitrox blends.|$|E

500|$|Although flightless, emus have vestigial wings, {{the wing}} chord {{measuring}} around , and each wing having a small claw at the tip. Emus flap their wings when running, {{perhaps as a}} means of stabilising themselves when <b>moving</b> <b>fast.</b> They have long necks and legs, and can run at speeds of [...] due to their highly specialised pelvic limb musculature. Their feet have only three toes and a similarly reduced number of bones and associated foot muscles; emus are the only birds with gastrocnemius muscles {{in the back of the}} lower legs. The pelvic limb muscles of emus contribute a similar proportion of the total body mass as do the flight muscles of flying birds. When walking, the emu takes strides of about , but at full gallop, a stride can be as long as [...] Its legs are devoid of feathers and underneath its feet are thick, cushioned pads. Like the cassowary, the emu has sharp claws on its toes which are its major defensive attribute, and are used in combat to inflict wounds on opponents by kicking. The toe and claw total [...] in length. The bill is quite small, measuring , and is soft, being adapted for grazing. [...] Emus have good eyesight and hearing, which allows them to detect threats at some distance.|$|E

500|$|Lyrically [...] "I Don't Give A" [...] {{describes}} {{a day in}} the life of Madonna, with the singer working through her schedule. The verses during the chorus are representative of how Madonna had previously ignored her detractors, instead choosing to express it with her music with the lines, [...] "I'm <b>moving</b> <b>fast,</b> Can you follow my track, I'm livin' fast, And I like it like that, I do ten things all at once, And if you have a problem, I don't give a." [...] During the bridge, the lyrics presumably talks about a marriage which did not work out for unknown reasons, [...] "I tried to be a good girl/ I tried to be your wife/ I diminished myself/ And I swallowed my light." [...] Many critics agreed that the song has pretty direct lyrics that seem to take aim at her ex-husband, film director Guy Ritchie. However, when asked if Ritchie was indeed the subject of the song, Madonna's representative Liz Rosenberg added that [...] " [...] has not explained the lyrics and if they are about someone specifically ... I appreciate that people will speculate." [...] The song ends with Minaj uttering the final line, [...] "There's only one queen and that's Madonna. Bitch!" ...|$|E
500|$|Stakes was {{met with}} mostly {{positive}} reviews, although a few commentators felt that the miniseries did not meet expectations. Charlie Jane Anders of io9 applauded the miniseries, noting {{that it is an}} interesting meditation on the concept of change, as well as the on philosophical idea that everything is cyclical. In regards to the art and direction of the miniseries, Anders wrote: [...] "There is so much insane gorgeous imagery in this , including a ton of really fantastic dream sequences. This show is really pushing its limits in terms of pure visual artistry." [...] Anders noted that, while some fans of the show have been suffering from [...] "Adventure Time fatigue"—largely {{based on the belief that}} the show has not moved forward since Finn met his father—Stakes [...] "really feels like a rejoinder to the people who complain the show isn’t <b>moving</b> <b>fast</b> enough with its plots". Writing for Vox, Todd VanDerWerff wrote highly of the miniseries, arguing that it was an excellent example of the coming-of-age story that [...] "shows off the kids series' emotional maturity". He did note that the miniseries is [...] "less a cohesive whole than a bunch of short stories that feel as if they accidentally add up to something bigger", and that the need for every installment to exist as a self-contained unit made Stakes [...] "a little clunky". With that being said, he felt that it ended up being [...] "suitably epic" [...] and [...] "rich with metaphor". Ultimately, VanDerWerff felt that the moral message of the miniseries was: [...] "Change is good. Growth is good. Supporting others' growth is good. And accepting others when they need to change is the best thing you can do." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} first {{broadcast}} in the United States on NBC on Monday, September 21, 1998, in the 9:3010 p.m. (PST) timeslot. In its original American broadcast, the pilot tied with Working for forty-first place in {{ratings for the}} week of September 21–27, 1998. With a Nielsen rating of 8.6, equivalent to approximately 8.4 million viewing households, it was the fifteenth-highest-rated show on NBC the week it aired. Since airing, the episode has received mostly positive reviews from television critics. Joyce Millman of Salon Entertainment said the episode has [...] "glimmers of class" [...] and the jokes are [...] "relatively sophisticated". John Carman of the San Francisco Chronicle commented that Burrows's direction was [...] "sharp as usual" [...] and the writing was [...] "above average". Brian Lambert of the St. Paul Pioneer Press said the pilot was [...] "nicely staged by veteran director Jimmy Burrows, and coming from a couple producers, Max Mutchnick and David Cohan, who assisted Boston Common and Dream On, the show – {{which is to say}} the pilot episode (everything could go to hell next week) – has the best verbal interplay of any of the season's new sitcoms." [...] William Horn from the Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation (GLAAD) thought the episode was a [...] "wonderful" [...] representation of a gay man's life [...] "regardless of whether he's in a relationship in that very moment. I think it's important that American audiences realize that lesbians and gay men are not simply all about sexual situations." [...] Ellen Gray of the Chicago Tribune was also positive about the show: [...] "For those who believe that Hollywood's engaging in a conspiracy to 'normalize' a sexual orientation that many Americans still find abhorrent, Will & Grace will look like a candy-coated poison pill. To those who think that Hollywood isn't <b>moving</b> <b>fast</b> enough in offering sexual parity for gays, it may just look like poison. But... there's a large audience out there that's somewhere in the mushy middle, an audience that might be ready to embrace Will & Grace." ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{the winter}} of 1285, Mongol armies invaded Hungary for a second time. As in the first {{invasion}} in 1241, Mongols invaded Hungary in two fronts. Nogai invaded via Transylvania, while Talabuga invaded via Transcarpathia and Moravia. A third, smaller force likely entered {{the center of the}} kingdom, mirroring Kadan's earlier route. The invasion paths seemed to mirror those taken by Batu and Subutai 40 years earlier, with Talabuga going through Verecke Pass and Nogai going through Brașov to enter Transylvania.Salagean, p. 135 Much like the first invasion, the Mongols emphasized speed and surprise and intended to destroy the Hungarian forces in detail, invading in winter for hope of catching the Hungarians off guard and <b>moving</b> <b>fast</b> enough that it was impossible (at least until their later setbacks) for Ladislaus to gather enough men to engage them in a decisive confrontation. Because of the lack of civil war in the Mongol Empire at the time, as well as the lack of any other major conflicts involving the Golden Horde, Nogai was able to field a very large army for this invasion, with the Galician-Volhynian Chronicle describing it as [...] "a great host" [...] but its exact size isn't certain. It is known that the Mongol host included cavalry from their vassals, the Ruthenian princes, including Lev Daniilovich and others from among their Rus′ satellites.Jackon, p. 205 ...|$|E
