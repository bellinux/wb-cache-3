5000|$|Workstation {{design is}} {{important}} to reduce awkward posture for the neck, back and shoulders. The sewing <b>machine</b> <b>table,</b> chair and paddle positions should be adjusted considering the worker’s body height in a sitting position. Sewing <b>machine</b> <b>table</b> heights should be adjusted between 10 cm to 15 cm above elbow height for everyone. It should also have tilted 10° to 15° towards the operator and the needle at 20° backward inclination and the pedal position should be placed forward and adjusted per user’s comfort. The adjustable desk height, inclined slope of the table, needle angle and the pedal position should induce a more upright position of the head, neck and trunk. Adjustment of the sewing <b>machine</b> <b>table</b> alone does not ensure good posture; adjustment of the chair {{is also an important}} factor. The chair should adjust between 51 cm and 61 cm; the backrest distance should adjust horizontally by about 5 cm and the backrest height should be fixed at 25 cm. Studies also show significant reduction of physical discomfort experienced by the sewing machine operators by changing the angle of seat pan and backrest of the chair.|$|E
50|$|A featherboard is {{a safety}} device used {{when working with}} {{stationary}} routers or power saws such as table saws or bandsaws. The purpose of a featherboard is to apply pressure against a workpiece, keeping it flat against a <b>machine</b> <b>table</b> or fence.|$|E

50|$|The tool {{is similar}} to a rotary table except that it is {{designed}} to be tilted as well as rotated and often allows positive locking at finer gradations of rotation, including through differential indexing. Most adjustable designs allow the head to be tilted from 10° below horizontal to 90° vertical, at which point the head is parallel with the <b>machine</b> <b>table.</b>|$|E
50|$|A gang-tool lathe is {{one that}} has a row of tools set up on its cross-slide, which is long and flat and is similar to a milling <b>machine</b> <b>table.</b> The idea is {{essentially}} the same as with turret lathes: to set up multiple tools and then easily index between them for each part-cutting cycle. Instead of being rotary like a turret, the indexable tool group is linear.|$|E

50|$|Shock testing {{typically}} {{falls into}} two categories, classical shock testing and pyroshock or ballistic shock testing. Classical shock testing {{consists of the}} following shock impulses: half sine, haversine, sawtooth wave, and trapezoid. Pyroshock and ballistic shock tests are specialized and are not considered classical shocks. Classical shocks can be performed on Electro Dynamic (ED) Shakers, Free Fall Drop Tower or Pneumatic Shock Machines. A classical shock impulse is created when the shock <b>machine</b> <b>table</b> changes direction abruptly. This abrupt change in direction causes a rapid velocity change which creates the shock impulse.|$|E

Lisa saw the opportunity to use the scanner, originally, by erecting a variety of compositions and collages directly on the <b>machine</b> <b>table.</b> In 1995 this was considered to be a ground breaking approach to the use and application of the technology. To the artist, the manipulation of the mechanism was yet one more tool to be utilized and, in this regard, no different than picking up a brush or a palette knife! ...|$|E
5000|$|To {{straighten}} a {{piece of}} bowed timber, the guard is temporarily swung out of the way. The machine is switched on and the timber is slowly lowered to the <b>machine</b> <b>table,</b> with the concave side down. A few cuts are made out of the red section [...] "A".The timber is turned end for end and the same procedure is done to the section [...] "B". This is repeated as required with the operator sighting {{along the length of}} the timber from time to time to check on straightness of the timber. When the timber is almost straight, the guard is replaced and the last cut is made in the normal way.|$|E

50|$|These {{risk factors}} have a {{negative}} impact not only on the musculoskeletal health, but also on the medical cost, efficiency, and optimal performance on activities of daily living. Minimizing ergonomic risk factors through ergonomic intervention for workers is often neglected in many of the countries. The reasons may be the scarcity of relevant professionals and additional cost for implementations on which majority of the owners are less interested. Thus, there are high rate of musculoskeletal symptoms in different body parts among sewing machine operators which points out for proper interventions. To reduce awkward posture for the neck, back and shoulders, the sewing <b>machine</b> <b>table,</b> chair and paddle positions should be adjusted considering the worker’s body height in a sitting position. The workers should be educated about the significance of postures on their health so that they do not neglect the instructions.|$|E
5000|$|Saw blade [...] "grabbing" [...] occurs more {{frequently}} during ripping than cross-cutting, and may manifest with both hand saws and bandsaws. It is more dangerous with a circular saw as {{areas of the}} blade close to the cutting area are moving in different directions. If a bandsaw grabs, the wood is pressed safely down into the <b>machine</b> <b>table,</b> as normal, and the saw may either jam, stall or at worst break the blade. If a table saw grabs, {{this is likely to}} be {{at the rear of the}} blade, where the teeth are rising up from the table and so may lift the wood upwards, out of control. The wood is then likely to catch the teeth on top of the blade and be thrown forwards, towards the operator. This accident is termed a [...] "kickback".|$|E
50|$|A {{router table}} is a {{stationary}} woodworking machine in which a vertically oriented spindle of a woodworking router protrudes from the <b>machine</b> <b>table</b> and can be spun at speeds typically between 3000 and 24,000 rpm. Cutter heads (router bits) may be mounted in the spindle chuck. As the workpiece is fed into the machine, the cutters mold a profile into it. The machine normally features a vertical fence, against which the workpiece is guided to control the horizontal depth of cut. Router tables are used to increase the versatility of a hand-held router, as each method of use is particularly suited to specific application, e.g. very large workpieces would be too large to support on a router table and must be routed with a hand-held machine, very small workpieces would not support a hand-held router and must be routed on a router table {{with the aid of}} pushtool accessories etc.|$|E

5000|$|Some {{time after}} 72-73, he signed various {{painting}} series and some sculptures as Tonatiuh Cuéllar or T. Cuéllar, instead of only Cuéllar. This name is an Aztec word which means Sun. At {{that time he}} used to wear white clothes and his daughter remembers him as elegant, preferring light colored clothing and always wearing a hat, which he began wearing in the 1940s to cover the thick hair on his head. Every day the painter would leave his home in San Miguel de Allende {{to spend time in}} the main plaza of the city, after painting for several hours in the morning. [...] Cuéllar developed most of his career in San Miguel de Allende, becoming well-respected in the artistic community as a mentor. His house hosted hundreds of artists and taught many of them. The house hosted a small gallery and studio, where an old Singer sewing <b>machine</b> <b>table</b> covered in a hand painted cloth served as the reception desk.

50|$|Overhead gantry-style {{positioning}} system's placement head {{is mounted}} on a gantry beam (X-axis). During the sequence, the beam moves perpendicular to {{the direction of the}} placement head movement, which offers two degrees of freedom (X and Y alignment) in a plane parallel to the <b>machine</b> <b>table.</b> The PCB and feeders keep stationary during placement. The PCB is located on the table by identifying global and local fiducials through a vision system. This placement head moves along the axis beams to pick components from a feeder, and then moves into position to place the components. A vacuum nozzle on the placement head moves up and down vertically to provide Z-axis and rotates in the horizontal plane to provide theta angular alignment. Sometimes a secondary vision system is also applied to check the correctness and alignment of the components after pick-up and before placement.As the PCB and feeders remain stationary in the placement sequence, the additional sources of positional inaccuracy are eliminated. Overhead gantry-style machine has the best placement accuracy among all types and is utilized by flexible placers exclusively. It offers greater flexibility and accuracy, but cannot match the speeds of other styles. Machines with multiple gantries can achieve faster speed.|$|E
