40|$|Mosaic gold, tin (IV) sulphide, is {{a yellow}} pigment which {{was known in}} antiquity but whose use was {{superseded}} by other more easily obtainable yellow pigments by the Renaissance. The identification of mosaic gold residues in a burnished golden mirror decoration on a XIIIth Century Spanish polychrome statue is important in that the first reference {{to the use of}} mosaic gold in the European literature dates from the XIVth Century, although the use of this material in China had been recorded some time before. In this paper, Raman spectroscopy, XRD and SEM are used in the analysis of the conditions required for the formation of golden mirrors using tin (IV) sulphide in admixture with dilead (II) lead (IV) tetroxide and <b>mercury</b> (II) <b>sulphide.</b> From these results, it is proposed that the major reactions are the reduction of Sn(IV) to Sn(0) with the accompanying oxidation of lead (II) oxide to lead (IV) oxide and the formation of lead (0) and lead (II) sulphide. From these results it was possible to explain the process of creation of the golden mirror from mosaic gold in the XIIIth Century. Â© 2003 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|The {{doctoral}} thesis deals with usage of gel techniques for {{in situ measurement}} of bioavailable metals in soils and sediments. The DGT technique was applied to soil samples from the localities of Zlín, Tuřany and Chrlice for estimation of bioavailable metals in soils. These soils were amended by sewage sludges in years 1980 - 1987. The experiment using diffusive gels with different pore size, APA and RG gels, {{has shown that the}} DGT can be used for assessment of trace metal soil complexes - small inorganic and larger organic. The results obtained by DGT measurements were approximately up to two orders of magnitude lower than metal concentrations obtained by leaching with sodium nitrate. The leaching with sodium nitrate does not provide true reflection of metal availability to plant root system and soil microorganisms and the DGT technique seems to be a better predictor of metal bioavailability. Only small differences between undisturbed and homogenized soil samples were found out by application of DGT to soil samples from localities of Veverská Bítýška and Ostrovačice. The undisturbed soil is not homogenous and the DGT unit gives information only about the part of the soil which is in direct contact with the unit. The procedure with soil slurry can be recommended for the characterization of large soil areas and estimation of bioavailable metals in soils. Gel techniques were also used for the study of processes occuring in sediments. Mercury species and other metals were analysed in surface water, pore water and sediments collected from two sampling sites in the Dele River in northern France. This river had been polluted during the last century by the activity of Métaleurop factory, which dealt with metal ore treatment. The application of DGT technique using two specific ion-exchange resins, Chelex- 100 and Duolite GT- 73, provided assessment of mercury in sediment pore water. DGT and DET techniques together with centrifugation provided also high resolution depth profiles of Fe, Mn, Zn, Pb, Cr and Cd in pore water. It is not possible to determine which sampling site was more contaminated. Only small differences in mercury species and metal content were observed between sampling sites. The Dele River can be classified as contaminated river according to total mercury content in sediments and as slightly contaminated river {{from the point of view}} of methylmercury content. Correlations between <b>mercury</b> species and <b>sulphide</b> content confirm that total <b>mercury</b> and <b>sulphide</b> content count among factors influencing the mercury release to pore water and controlling processes of methylation and demethylation. Only low toxicity of sediment slurries was found out by the bioluminiscence test with Vibrio fischeri.

40|$|In {{the polar}} tropospheric {{boundary}} layer, reactive halogen species (RHS) {{are responsible for}} ozone depletion {{as well as the}} oxidation of elemental <b>mercury</b> and dimethyl <b>sulphide.</b> After polar sunrise, air masses enriched in reactive bromine cover areas of several million square kilometers. Still, the source and release mechanisms of halogens are not completely understood. We report measurements of halogen oxides performed in the Amundsen Gulf, Arctic, during spring 2008. Active long-path differential optical absorption spectroscopy (LP-DOAS) measurements were set up offshore, several kilometers from the coast, directly on the sea ice, which was never done before. High bromine oxide concentrations were detected frequently during sunlight hours with a characteristic daily cycle showing morning and evening maxima and a minimum at noon. The, so far, highest observed average mixing ratio in the polar boundary layer of 41  pmol/mol (equal to pptv) was detected. Only short sea ice contact is required to release high amounts of bromine. An observed linear decrease of maximum bromine oxide levels with ambient temperature during sunlight, between - 24  °C and - 15  °C, provides indications on the conditions required for the emission of RHS. In addition, the data indicate the presence of reactive chlorine in the Arctic boundary layer. In contrast to Antarctica, iodine oxide was not detected above a detection limit of 0. 3  pmol/mol...|$|R

40|$|In group II A. Analysis {{two methods}} {{are used to}} {{dissolve}} precipitated <b>Mercury</b> <b>Sulphide</b> – potassium chlorate and concentrated hydrochloric acid or aqua regia. These methods are essentially the solution of <b>mercury</b> <b>sulphide</b> by means of nascent chlorine. A third method has been described whereby <b>mercury</b> <b>sulphide</b> is dissolved in a sulphuric acid solution of potassium iodide. This mixture liberates hydrogen iodide which is the dissolving agent. From the equations [complicated equations here] is seems possible that the dissolving action is due to complex formation. It will be seen from equation (1) that the lower the concentration of the sulphideions the greater will be tendency for <b>mercury</b> <b>sulphide</b> to dissolve. This furnishes an explanation why potassium iodide alone cannot be used with same success as hydrogen iodide. With potassium iodide potassium sulphide instead of hydrogen sulphide will be formed during the solution reaction. As potassium sulphide is the salt of a strong base there will remain in solution {{a high concentration of}} sulphideions which must promote the back reaction shown in equation (1) and an equilibrium is all that can be attained. It is not possible to reduce the sulphide ion concentration by boiling as it is with hydrogen sulphide since potassium sulphide is non volatile. If the ordinary methods and this new method are compared it is seen that whereas nascent chlorine converts <b>mercury</b> <b>sulphide</b> into mercury chloride, the action of hydrogen iodide is to form a complex salt which has a very low concentration of mercury ions. It is possible therefore that this new method may not give so sensitive a test for mercury. The object of this portion of the work is to ascertain the possibility of testing for mercury in Group II analysis by using the hydrogen iodide method of dissolving the precipitated <b>mercury</b> <b>sulphide</b> and to compare the sensitivity of the test with that of the methods usually employed...|$|E
40|$|A unique {{feature of}} the polar {{troposphere}} is the strong activity of halogen photochemistry, in which reactive halogen species (RHS), such as BrO, IO and ClO, are responsible for ozone depletion, the oxidation of elemental <b>mercury</b> and dimethyl <b>sulphide.</b> The typical abundances, sources, {{as well as the}} release and recycling mechanisms of these halogen species are far from being completely understood. Within this work, field observations were undertaken, in the Arctic (at Alert) and Antarctic (around Ross Island and in the Weddell Sea), using remote sensing and in-situ instruments based on Differential Optical Absorption Spectroscopy (DOAS) techniques such as MAX-DOAS, CE-DOAS and LP-DOAS. Chlorine monoxide was directly detected and quantified (up to 60 pptv, 20 pptv typical) in the Antarctic boundary layer for the first time, with IO and BrO being present simultaneously. The diurnal variation, correlating with insolation, point to the source being the oxidation of surface Cl- by OH or O 3. In the Arctic, IO was observed {{for the first time on}} a regional scale and throughout the sunlit period during several years (2007 - 2014). The IO mixing ratios between 0 - 0. 5 pptv are in agreement with an inorganic, oceanic source and resemble those at both Antarctic sites.

40|$|Pd-rich PGM (platinum-group minerals) {{have been}} found in sulphide-bearing dunites and harzburgites from the Inazumi-yama ultramafic complex in southwestern Japan. In the dunite, potarite (PdHg (sub 0. 85 - 0. 88)) is the most {{abundant}} PGM but other associated PGM include stibiopalladinite (Pd 5 Sb 2) and rare sperrylite (PtAs 2) and Pd-rich alloys. A Pd telluride has been found in the harzburgite. The PGM are enclosed usually by pentlandite-heazlewoodite composite grains and, rarely, by altered chrome-spinel. These minerals are characteristic of an ultramafic assemblage but they are accompanied by ubiquitous galena and minor sphalerite not usually associated with these ultramafic assemblages. The ultramafic part of this complex has been thermally metamorphosed (olivine-talc zone) within the contact aureole of an adjacent granite. The PGM, sulphides and altered spinel are all intergrown with antigorite and/or chlorite, indicating a metamorphic overprint on the primary igneous mineralogy. The Pd/Pt ratios of 9 suggest a process of hydrothermal concentration for the Pd and it is proposed that the Pd has been remobilized and reconcentrated by hydrothermal solutions derived from the granitic magma which reacted with the Pd concentrated in the primary magmatic <b>sulphides.</b> <b>Mercury</b> may have been leached from surrounding sediments by the hydrothermal solutions. It is possible that potarite and the other PGM formed at temperatures of up to 650 degrees C and are likely to be found in other thermally metamorphosed ultramafic rocks showing a depleted character (spinel Cr/[Cr+Al]> 0. 7), common in orogenic belt...|$|R
40|$|Radioanalytical {{method for}} {{monitoring}} {{of separation of}} arsenic from realgar ore through As- 76 was described. The procedure follows the distribution of radioactive components between a liquid and a solid phase {{in any kind of}} chemical treatment. The method is applicable in examination of metallurgical procedures with natural materials that are characterized with a high cross section for neutron capture. The method can be applied in examination of samples containing <b>mercury</b> (II) <b>sulphide</b> HgS, which are not suitable for conventional chemical treatments concerning ecological risks. The samples examined were from Vareš mine zone - a sample of realgar ore and a sample of dolomite. The realgar seam has not been treated separately, but the sample has been collected by flotation in a concentrate which is a mixture of different ores in Vares mine area. We assumed that such seams should be treated separately, and not as a part of an ore concentrate, because arsenic is only a trace element in a concentrate collected (0. 2 % – 0. 4 %), and its separation is therefore difficult. A sample of realgar ore has been irradiated with a neutron source americium – 241 /beryllium with neutron flux 2. 6 × 107 n s- 1. The radio analytical procedure proposed consists of three main phases:– The investigated sample is irradiated in a neutron source and gamma-spectrometrically charecterised. – An identical sample is exposed to any kind of chemical treatment. A part of the sample that isnot dissolved is then separated and the remainder is gamma-spectrometrically characterized aswell. – When the obtained gamma spectra are compared, the information on distribution of radionuclides is gained, and the yield of dissolving process is defined. Reliability of the neutron activation method depends on the neutron source used, but also on the quality of gamma-spectrometer. A typical gamma spectrum of a realgar sample (0. 5 g), after it has been irradiated in a neutron source, was recorded on a 200 -channel NaI crystal spectrometer (Fig. 1). Possible interferences come from Sb- 122, Sb- 124 and Zn- 69 m, concerning the energies used in the spectrochemical measurement (they could not be separated from As- 76). In order to check the reliability of the method of radiochemical marking in following the dissolving of realgar,we have conducted additional gamma-spectrochemical measurements of an irradiated realgar sample, using a semi-conducting 1000 channel Ge/Li spectrometer (Fig. 2). The two gammaspectra show that all As- 76 energies are present (558 keV, 657 keV and 1215 keV (Fig. 1 and Fig. 2). The conclusion is that a processing of numerical data from energy spectra and the main energy level (0. 56 MeV for As- 76) can be used for following of dissolving of realgar on a scintillation spectrometer as well, because there are no measurable interferences from other elements in the energy level zone observed. In the main energy zone for As- 76, the half-life recorded is 25. 4, and the literature value is 26. 5 hrs, and the error of ± 5 % is acceptable. This confirms the above written conclusion...|$|R

The contaminated soil {{came from a}} chlor-alkali factory and contained about 100 mg/kg Hg. Iodide/iodine complexing agent was used to mobilize mercury. Mercury iodide complexes were moved to the anode solution using an electric field. The anode solution was then mixed with hydrogen sulphide (H 2 S) containing water, causing precipitation of <b>mercury</b> <b>sulphide.</b> The H 2 S was produced at site by a SRB reactor. Precipitation problems arising from {{the nature of the}} anode solution were expected, since this solution is highly acidic, very oxidised and may contain iodide/iodine that strongly complexes mercury and can hinder <b>mercury</b> <b>sulphide</b> precipitation. Mercury concentrations in the anode solution were up to 65. 7 mg/L (field) and 15. 4 mg/L (lab. scale). Reduction of mercury in the water was > 93 % at all times. Iodide did not hinder the process: Nonetheless, in the lab system, iodide concentration was high in the anode solution but mercury reduction was > 99. 9 %. The redox potential was sufficiently low for HgS precipitation during the experiments, except for a short period, when the mercury removal decreased to 94 %. Sulphate reducing bacteria are shown as a viable tool for the treatment of mercury contaminated, acidic, oxidative, iodide containing water, such as that produced by electrokinetic remediation. A second SRB step or other water treatment is required to reduce the mercury concentration to environmentally acceptable levels. Redox. potential is the most sensitive factor in the system...|$|E

40|$|Reactive halogen species (RHS) are {{responsible}} for ozone depletion and oxidation of gaseous elemental <b>mercury</b> and dimethyl <b>sulphide</b> in the polar boundary layer, but the sources and mechanisms controlling their catalytic reaction cycles are still not completely understood. To further investigate these processes, ground– based Multi–Axis Differential Optical Absorption Spectroscopy (MAX-DOAS) observations of boundary layer BrO and IO were made from a portable instrument platform in McMurdo Sound during the Antarctic spring of 2006 and 2007. Measurements of surface ozone, temperature, pressure, humidity, and wind speed and direction were also made, along with fourteen tethersonde soundings and the collection of snow samples for mercury analysis. A spherical multiple scattering Monte Carlo radiative transfer model (RTM) was developed for the simulation of box-air-mass-factors (box-AMFs), which are {{used to determine the}} weighting functions and forward model differential slant column densities (DSCDs) required for optimal estimation. The RTM employed the backward adjoint simulation technique for the fast calculation of box-AMFs for specific solar zenith angles (SZA) and MAX-DOAS measurement geometries. Rayleigh and Henyey-Greenstein scattering, ground topography and reflection, refraction, and molecular absorption by multiple species were included. Radiance and box-AMF simulations for MAX-DOAS measurements were compared with nine other RTMs and showed good agreement. A maximum a posteriori (MAP) optimal estimation algorithm was developed to retrieve trace gas concentration profiles from the DSCDs derived from the DOAS analysis of the measured absorption spectra. The retrieval algorithm was validated by performing an inversion of artificial DSCDs, simulated from known NO 2 profiles. Profiles with a maximum concentration near the ground were generally well reproduced, but the retrieval of elevated layers was less accurate. Retrieved partial vertical column densities (VCDs) were similar to the known values, and investigation of the averaging kernels indicated that these were the most reliable retrieval product. NO₂ profiles were also retrieved from measurements made at an NO₂ measurement and profiling intercomparison campaign in Cabauw, Netherlands in July 2009. Boundary layer BrO was observed on several days throughout both measurement periods in McMurdo Sound, with a maximum retrieved surface mixing ratio of 14. 4 ± 0. 3 ppt. The median partial VCDs up to 3 km were 9. 7 ± 0. 07 x 10 ¹² molec cm ⁻ in 2007, with a maximum of 2. 3 ± 0. 07 x 10 ¹³ molec cm⁻², and 7. 4 ± 0. 06 x 10 ¹² molec cm⁻² in 2006, with a maximum of 1. 05 ± 0. 07 x 1013 molec cm⁻². The median mixing ratio of 7. 5 ± 0. 5 ppt for 2007 was significantly higher than the median of 5. 2 ± 0. 5 ppt observed in 2006, which {{may be related to the}} more extensive first year sea ice in 2007. These values are consistent with, though lower than estimated boundary layer BrO concentrations at other polar coastal sites. Four out of five observed partial ozone depletion events (ODEs) occurred during strong winds and blowing snow, while BrO was present in the boundary layer in both stormy and calm conditions, consistent with the activation of RHS in these two weather extremes. Air mass back trajectories, modelled using the Hybrid Single-Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory (HYSPLIT) model, indicated that the events were locally produced rather than transported from other sea ice zones. Boundary layer IO mixing ratios of 0. 5 – 2. 5 ± 0. 2 ppt were observed on several days. These values are low compared to measurements at Halley and Neumayer Stations, as well as mid-latitudes. Significantly higher total mercury concentrations observed in 2007 may be related to the higher boundary layer BrO concentrations, but further measurements are required to verify this...|$|R

3000|$|Red Pigments Cinnabar, Red Ochre, Red {{lead and}} Realgar {{are some of}} the {{examples}} of red pigments originate from minerals. Cinnabar, also known as vermillion, refers to common bright scarlet to brick-red form of <b>mercury</b> <b>sulphide</b> (HgS), a common source ore for refining elemental mercury and serves directly as dyeing pigment. Red Ochre (Geru in Hindi) is a natural earth pigment containing anhydrous and hydrated iron oxide (Fe 2 O 3 ·nH 2 O). The color of red ochre is not as bright as that of Cinnabar but it is found in several hues, which ranges from yellow to deep orange or brown. Red Ochre is very stable compound and is not affected by light, acids and alkalies. Fine red ochre is obtained by washing its crude variety. Red ochre is used by monks to color their robes. Red lead (Sindur in Hindi) (Pb 3 O 4 or 2 [PbO]·[PbO 2]) is a bright red or orange crystalline or amorphous pigment has been used in Indian paintings in abundance. Realgar (α-As 4 S 4) (Manasila in Hindi) is an arsenic sulphide mineral commonly known as Ruby sulphur or ruby of arsenic, found in combination with orpiment (As 2 S 3) which is also a mineral of arsenic. Both are sulphides of arsenic but these are not safe and have not been used much in paintings.|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} has been centred on the analytical identification {{of the use of}} cinnabar (the red mercury sulphide-HgS-) as a pigment in Neolithic and Chalcolithic archaeological contexts (VI to III millennia B. C.) and in the determination of its possible origin by the application of Lead Isotopes analysis. In order to confront the isotopic results of the archaeological cinnabar pigments, samples from the <b>mercury</b> <b>sulphide</b> mineral deposits of Usagre (Badajoz) and Las Alpujarras (Granada) were submitted to Lead Isotopes analysis. These results were added to those available in the geo-chronological literature referred to the Almadén mining district (Ciudad Real), the largest concentration of cinnabar in the world, although with the oldest evidence of mining dated, at present, to the 8 th century BC. The confrontation of the lead isotopic results of the samples from archaeological contexts and of the mineral deposits showed, firstly, the distinguishable lead isotopic composition of the main cinnabar mines studied and, secondly, the consistency of the isotopic composition of the archaeological Neolithic and Chalcolithic cinnabar samples with the Almadén district isotopic field. Based on the currently available isotopic data, it is proposed that the exploitation and the use as a pigment of cinnabar mineral from the Almadén district started, at least, in the late 6 th millennium BC, being distributed through long distance exchange networks during the Neolithic and Chalcolithic period...|$|E
40|$|Metal {{sulphides}} {{may reduce}} the toxicity of heavy-metal contaminated sediments (Di Toro et al., 1992), but the importance of metal sulphides for reducing impacts of heavy metals in soils is poorly understood. Seasonal variations in hydrology can cause soils to undergo redox changes that are conducive for oxidation of metal sulphides. We used synchrotron extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectroscopy, to characterize the local molecular bonding of heavy metals (Hg, Cu, Pb, and Zn) in several poorly-&ained soils and a groundwater aquifer. Because average first-shell, metal-sulphur bond lengths (r) are greater than metal-oxygen bond lengths, the proportion of metal bonded with sulphide could be estimated. Following is a SUlmnary of our past results: (1) <b>Mercury</b> <b>sulphide</b> (metacinnabar) was dominant in a soil sample from a contaminated floodplain in Tennessee, U. S. (Wang et al., in press); (2) zinc sulphide was dominant and lead sulphide was absent in a contaminated groundwater aquifer zone underlying a poorly-drained soil in the Piedmont region of North Carolina, U. S. (Hesterberg et al., 1997); and (3) copper-, zinc-, and lead-sulphides were found in deeper zones (47 - 101 cm) of a contaminated soil in the lower coastal plain of North Carolina (Sayers et al., 1998). These findings indicate that authigenic metal sulphides form in contaminated soil exposed to reducing conditions. In this study, we completed laboratory soil column experiments with supporting EXAFS analysis to investigate the stability of metal sulphides under changing redox and pH conditions. Experimental approach Soil samples were collected from four depth intervals (zones) in a contaminated soil on the Marine Corp...|$|E
40|$|Currently {{cinnabar}} is depositing at Ngawha Springs from mercury transported as the element. Much of {{the deposition}} is weather dependent and all ore {{occurs in the}} uppermost few metres of the ground. Field conditions and laboratory experiments demonstrate that deposition requires oxygen and {{that the presence of}} chloride enhances the oxidation of mercury. The deposition of the cinnabar proceeds according to the reaction: [...] . The mercury 11 thus formed rapidly reacts with reduced-sulphur species from geothermal and biogenic sources to produce cinnabar. Biogenic replacement of organic material by metal sulphides is an important deposition mechanism, for it is responsible for the bulk of the richest cinnabar occurrences via the marcasite pseudomorphing of vegetation debris adjacent to the geothermal emanations. The oxidative destruction of the pseudomorphs yields the high concentrations of cinnabar by removing all but the resistant <b>mercury</b> <b>sulphide.</b> Investigation of the mercury species and their concentrations in gases, waters, soils, biota and rocks showed that mercury 11 compounds generally dominate in the solid materials, where as elemental mercury dominates in the subterranean fluids and mercury adsorbed onto particulate matter dominates most surface-waters. Organo-mercurials and cold, dilute-acid-extractable mercury did not dominate anywhere. The source of the anomalous mercury is two sedimentary facies which underlie the Ngawha Basin: the basement and the subordinate olistostrome known as the Northland Chaos Breccia. Radiocarbon fourteen dating, mass-balance analyses and flux calculations reveal that the ore deposits are nearly 6900 years old, and that ca. 520 kg of mercury enter the Ngawha Basin and environs each year.

40|$|International audienceBiodissolution {{experiments}} on cinnabar ore (<b>mercury</b> <b>sulphide</b> and other sulphide minerals, such as pyrite) were performed with microorganisms extracted directly from soil. These experiments {{were carried out}} in closed systems under aerobic and anaerobic conditions with 2 different soils sampled in French Guyana. The two main objectives {{of this study were}} (1) to quantify the ability of microorganisms to mobilize metals (Fe, Al, Hg) during the dissolution of cinnabar ore, and (2) to identify the links between the type and chemical properties of soils, environmental parameters such as season and the strategies developed by indigenous microorganisms extracted from tropical natural soils to mobilize metals. Results indicate that microbial communities extracted directly from various soils are able to (1) survive in the presence of cinnabar ore, as indicated by consumption of carbon sources and, (2) leach Hg from cinnabar in oxic and anoxic dissolution experiments via the acidification of the medium and the production of low molecular mass organic acids (LMMOAs). The dissolution rate of cinnabar in aerobic conditions with microbial communities ranged from 4. 8 × 10 − 4 to 2. 6 × 10 − 3 μmol/m 2 /day and was independent of the metabolites released by the microorganisms. In addition, these results suggest an indirect action by the microorganisms in the cinnabar dissolution. Additionally, because iron is a key element in the dynamics of Hg, microbes were stimulated by the presence of this metal, and microbes released LMMOAs that leached iron from iron-bearing minerals, such as pyrite and oxy-hydroxide of iron, in the mixed cinnabar ore...|$|E
40|$|The {{processing}} of metallic mercury into {{the form of}} a <b>mercury</b> <b>sulphide</b> ash, called tsotel (btso thal), is considered the most refined pharmacological technique known in Tibetan medicine. This ash provides the base material for many of the popular “precious pills” (rin chen ril bu), which are considered essential by Tibetan physicians to treat severe diseases. Making tsotel and precious pills in Tibet’s past were rare and expensive events. The Chinese take-over of Tibet in the 1950 s, followed by the successive reforms, including the Cultural Revolution (1966 – 1976), affected the opportunities to transmit the knowledge and practice of making tsotel. In this article, I discuss two Tibetan physicians, Tenzin Chödrak (1924 – 2001) and Troru Tsenam (1926 – 2004), both of whom spent many years in Chinese prisons and labour camps, and their role in the transmission of the tsotel practice in a labour camp in 1977, contextualising these events with tsotel practices in Central and South Tibet in preceding decades. Based on two contemporary biographies, their descriptions of making tsotel will be analysed as well as {{the ways in which the}} biographies depicted these events. I argue that the ways of writing about these tsotel events in the physicians’ biographies, while silencing certain lines of knowledge transmission, established an authoritative lineage of this practice. Both physicians had a decisive impact on the continuation of the lineage and the manufacturing of tsotel and precious pills from the 1980 s onwards in both India and the People’s Republic of China (PRC) ...|$|E
40|$|Background: Herbo-mineral {{formulations}} of Ayurveda contain specified metals or minerals as composition, which have their beneficial effects on biological systems. These metals or minerals are transformed into non-toxic forms through meticulous procedures explained in Ayurveda. Though literature {{is available on}} quality aspects of such herbo-mineral formulations; contemporary science is raising concerns at regular intervals on such formulations. Thus, it becomes mandate to develop quality profiles of all formulations that contain metals or minerals in their composition. Considering this, it is planned to evaluate analytical profile of Vasantakusumākara Rasa. Objective: To prepare Vasantakusumākara Rasa as per Standard operating Procedures (SoP) mentioned in classical text and to characterize it chemically using modern analytical techniques. Materials and Methods: The drug (Vasantakusumākara Rasa) in three batches was prepared in GMP certified pharmacy. Physico-chemical analysis, Assay of elements and HPTLC were carried out as per API. XRD was conducted using Rigaku Ultima-IV X-ray diffractometer. Results: The analysis shown the presence of Mercury, Tin, Gold, Silver, Iron, Zinc and Calcium etc., and HPTLC revealed presence of organic constituents from plant material. The XRD indicated the presence of cinnabar (<b>mercury</b> <b>sulphide</b> from Rasa Sindhura), cassiterite (tin oxide from Vaṅga Bhasma), massicot (lead oxide from Nāga bhasma) and Magnetite (di-iron oxide from Loha bhasma). Conclusion: The physico chemical analysis reveals that VKR prepared by following classical guidelines is very effective in converting the macro elements into therapeutically effective medicines in micro form. Well prepared herbo-mineral drugs offer many advantages over plant medicines due to their longer shelf life, lesser doses, easy storing facilities, better palatability etc. The inferences and the standards laid down in this study certainly can be utilized as baseline data of standardization and QC...|$|E
3000|$|The {{deep red}} {{coloured}} cinnabar (HgS), {{as well as}} its synthetic counterpart vermillion (HgS), produced either by wet or dry processes [193, 194], were extensively used [1]. Roman sources [195], however, seemed to use the term minium to identify this material, giving room to misinterpretations and nomenclature issues [1]. It was already known to Romans [195, 196] that <b>mercury</b> <b>sulphide</b> darkens when exposed to light, although not systematically [1, 193, 194, 197 – 199]. Moreover, HgS was not recommended for use in fresco, as humidity and pH affect its stability [103, 123, 200], but still it was used on wall paintings [73, 193, 201 – 203]. Paint layers of pure vermillion are very vulnerable [199], while no darkening is observed when it is mixed with leadwhite [19, 20, 193, 204]. An increased resistance to laser radiation is also observed for other mixtures, such as vermillion with chrome yellow, madder, Prussian blue, and bone black, although the single pigments’ behaviour is hardly predictable [19]. Red lead, often mixed with vermillion to improve the curing of the oil binder, seems to have a protective effect on HgS [20, 199]. A series of reactions of vermillion with other pigments, different binders and substrates are reported in literature [65, 198, 205]. The presence of a varnish layer, and of organic binders, moreover, seems to protect the paint layer, by absorbing the incident light (more effectively when the varnish is thick and/or yellowed, and with different efficiency according to the composition, i.e. UV light is strongly absorbed) and by physically protecting the pigment grains from contact with chlorine-containing materials (disinfectants, dirt, etc.) [199, 206]. Sulphation of the red paint layers in Pompeian wall paintings was observed, and seems to be connected with the Cl− induced degradation of vermillion [106, 202]. The blackening of vermillion was often attributed to the formation of a black compound, supposedly metacinnabar (β-HgS) [194], although no positive identification could be obtained [198]. Binder type and pigment/binder ratio affect the pigment’s stability, and glazes seem to have a role in preserving the red hue of vermillion, by filtering some of the incident light and protecting the pigment from external sources of chlorine [199]. The same metacinnabar is hypothesized in wall paintings [121, 139, 202], but only identified on laser irradiated vermillion [70, 142]. Pure vermillion is sensitive to lasers of various wavelength and irradiation, so that the original structure is lost [141, 142, 206]. Black β-HgS was identified by X-ray diffraction (XRD) on IR-laser damaged red α-HgS [70], and by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) [141]. Dark Hg 2 S was detected as well, by XPS by [150]. XRD and XPS studies suggest a photoreduction of HgS to Hg 0 /Hg 2 [...]...|$|E
