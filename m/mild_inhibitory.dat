All BRAFi/MEKi reduced this release as single agents, with Dabra having the <b>mildest</b> <b>inhibitory</b> effect, and Dabra + Tram having a clearly <b>milder</b> <b>inhibitory</b> effect than Vem + Cobi. A similar picture was observed for the upregulation of the activation markers CD 25 and CD 69 on CAR-transfected T cells after antigen-specific stimulation. Most importantly, the cytolytic capacity of the CAR-T cells was significantly inhibited by Cobi and Vem + Cobi, whereas the other kinase inhibitors showed no effect.

The reactions of the ligand with zinc(II), copper(II), nickel(II), cobalt(II), manganese(II) and palladium(II) salts afforded homobinuclear metal complexes. Characterization and structure elucidation of the prepared complexes were achieved using different analytical and spectroscopic techniques.

40|$|International audienceWHAT IS KNOWN AND OBJECTIVE: Positive inotropic {{agents are}} {{frequently}} used in acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF) due to left ventricular systolic dysfunction. These agents {{are known to}} improve cardiac performance and peripheral perfusion in the short-term treatment. However, several preclinical and clinical studies emphasized detrimental effects of these drugs on myocardial oxygen demand and on sympathetic tone entailing arrhythmogenesis. Levosimendan is an inotropic agent with an original mechanism of action. This review focuses on major data available for levosimendan. METHODS: A literature search was conducted in the PubMed database by including studies published in English using combinations of the following key words, levosimendan, inotropic drugs and acute heart failure. Furthermore, bibliographies of selected references were also evaluated for relevant articles. The collection for this review {{was limited to the}} most recently available human and animal data. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Levosimendan's vasodilatory and cardioprotective effects are mediated by calcium sensitization of contractile proteins and opening of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) -dependent K+ channels in vascular smooth muscle cells and on mitochondrial ATP-sensitive potassium [mito. K(ATP) ] channels. This inotropic agent has <b>mild</b> PDE <b>inhibitory</b> action. Unlike other inotropic agents, levosimendan improves cardiac performance without activating the sympathetic nervous system. Moreover, there are evidences that levosimendan has additional anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic properties that prevent cardiac toxicity and contributes to positive hemodynamic response of the drug. Four randomized trials evaluated the effects of levosimendan on mortality in patients with acute decompensated chronic heart failure; nevertheless, a clear benefit has not been demonstrated so far. Although levosimendan is indicated for the treatment of ADHF (class of recommendation IIa, level of evidence B), it is has not been approved in all countries.

30|$|Cyclooxygenases have an {{important}} role in the production of PGs where these enzymes in bone tissues show increased activity under the influence of hypoxia-inducible factors [6, 11]. Therefore, local activity of COX enzymes promotes bone formation and resorption through the production of PGs [12]. Non-selective NSAIDs are reported to inhibit the activity of COX- 1 equally, if not more than COX- 2 [2]. Therefore, NSAIDs inhibit the production of PGs at the site of implant placement or fracture, thereby influencing the bone healing cascade [13]. There is evidence from animal studies that indicate that COX- 2 inhibitors delay done healing in diaphyseal fracture models in rats [13]. However, the exact roles of COX- 1 and COX- 2 in the PG production has not been ascertained in humans, and assumptions have been made suggesting a <b>milder</b> or non-significant <b>inhibitory</b> effect of selective COX- 2 inhibitors on bone healing when compared to a non-selective COX inhibitor [2, 13]. Furthermore, a systematic review conducted by Marquez-Lara et al. highlighted the great variability regarding the impact of NSAIDs on bone healing, and that there is no consensus regarding the impact of NSAIDs following orthopaedic procedures [14]. Therefore, the rationale of the present systematic review is to address the gaps in the literature by identifying if variables such as the dosage, duration of administration, and selectivity of post-operative NSAIDs negatively affect osseointegration.|$|R
40|$|In {{eukaryotic}} cells, membrane-bound vesicles carry cargo between intracellular compartments, to {{and from}} the cell surface, and to the extracellular environment. Many conserved families of proteins are required for properly localized vesicle fusion, including the multi-subunit tethering complexes and the SNARE complexes. These protein complexes work together to promote proper vesicle fusion in other trafficking pathways. Contrary to these other pathways, our lab previously suggested that the exocyst subunit Sec 6, a component of the exocytosis-specific tethering complex, inhibited Sec 9 :Sso 1 SNARE complex assembly due to interactions in vitro with the SNARE protein Sec 9 (Sivaram et al., 2005). My goal for this project was to test the hypothesis that Sec 6 inhibited SNARE complex assembly in vivo. I therefore chose to generate Sec 6 :Sec 9 loss-of-binding mutants, and study their effect both in vitro and in vivo. I identified a patch of residues on Sec 9 that, when mutated, are sufficient to disrupt the novel Sec 6 -SNARE interaction. Additionally, I found that the previous inhibitory role for Sec 6 in SNARE assembly was due to a data mis-interpretation; my re-interpretation of the data shows that Sec 6 has a <b>mild,</b> if any, <b>inhibitory</b> effect on SNARE assembly. My results suggest a potential positive role for Sec 6 in SNARE complex assembly, similar to the role observed for other tether-SNARE interactions...|$|R
40|$|International audienceMetformin, a drug {{widely used}} in the {{treatment}} of Type II diabetes, has recently received attention owing to new findings regarding its mitochondrial and cellular effects. In the present study, the effects of metformin on respiration, complex 1 activity, mitochondrial permeability transition, cytochrome c release and cell death were investigated in cultured cells from a human carcinoma-derived cell line (KB cells). Metformin significantly decreased respiration both in intact cells and after permeabilization. This was due to a mild and specific inhibition of the respiratory chain complex 1. In addition, metformin prevented to a significant extent mitochondrial permeability transition both in permeabilized cells, as induced by calcium, and in intact cells, as induced by the glutathione-oxidizing agent t-butyl hydroperoxide. This effect was equivalent to that of cyclosporin A, the reference inhibitor. Finally, metformin impaired the t-butyl hydroperoxide-induced cell death, as judged by Trypan Blue exclusion, propidium iodide staining and cytochrome c release. We propose that metformin prevents the permeability transition-related commitment to cell death in relation to its <b>mild</b> <b>inhibitory</b> effect on complex 1, which is responsible for a decreased probability of mitochondrial permeability transition...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Hyaluronan (HA) plays crucial {{roles in}} the tumourigenicity of many types of {{malignant}} tumours. 4 -Methylumbelliferone (MU) is an inhibitor of HA synthesis. Several studies have shown its inhibitory effects on malignant tumours; however, none have focused on its effects on osteosarcoma. METHODS: We investigated the effects of MU on HA accumulation and tumourigenicity of highly metastatic murine osteosarcoma cells (LM 8) that have HA-rich cell-associated matrix, and human osteosarcoma cell lines (MG- 63 and HOS). RESULTS: In vitro, MU inhibited HA retention, thereby reducing the formation of functional cell-associated matrices, and also inhibited cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. Akt phosphorylation was suppressed by MU (1. 0 mM). In vivo, although MU showed only a <b>mild</b> <b>inhibitory</b> effect on {{the growth of the}} primary tumour, it markedly inhibited (75 % reduction) the development of lung metastasis. Hyaluronan retention in the periphery of the primary tumour was markedly suppressed by MU. CONCLUSION: These findings suggested that MU suppressed HA retention and cell-associated matrix formation in osteosarcoma cells, resulting in a reduction of tumourigenicity, including lung metastasis. 4 -Methylumbelliferone is a promising therapeutic agent targeting both primary tumours and distant metastasis of osteosarcoma, possibly via suppression of HA retention...|$|E

Normal rabbits and rabbits with CNS depletion of 5 -HT and NA (caused by the neurotoxins 5, 7 -dihydroxytryptamine and 6 -hydroxydopamine) were studied in an airconditioned chamber at ambient temperatures of 12 °, 22 ° and 35 °C. The results suggest that CNS 5 -HT plays an excitatory role in the heat conservation mechanism of cold-induced ear skin vasoconstriction, and that this effect is inhibited by CNS NA to cause heat dissipation during heat stress. Both CNS 5 -HT and NA appear to exert a <b>mild</b> <b>inhibitory</b> restraint on ventilation even during heat stress. The data support the theory that CNS 5 -HT is concerned with heat conservation and CNS NA with heat loss mechanisms in the cutaneous circulation, and that both monoamines moderate heat loss through panting.

Methods: The antioxidant activities of aqueous, decoction, ethanol and hydro-ethanol extracts {{of the plant}} were determined using seven different assays; the antidiabetic potential was evaluated through the inhibition of key carbohydrate hydrolysing enzymes (α-amylase and α-glucosidase), while the modes of the enzymes inhibition were assessed using enzyme kinetic analysis. Results: The ethanol extract exhibited the best scavenging activity (IC 50 : 0. 47, 0. 36, 0. 20, 0. 29 and 0. 01  mg/mL) against the tested radicals like 1, 1 -diphenyl- 2 -picrylhydrazyl, 2, 2 ′-azinobis (3 -ethylbenzothiazoline- 6 -sulfonic acid), nitric oxide, hydroxyl and superoxide anion, respectively. It also showed the best reducing power efficiency {{when compared with the}} standard (silymarin), while the decoction extract displayed the strongest metal chelating potential (IC 50 : 0. 71  mg/mL).

40|$|Plasmids pAD 1 (37. 8 megadaltons) and pAD 2 (17. 1 megadaltons) of Streptococcus faecalis strain DS 16 {{have been}} mapped with {{restriction}} enzymes. The {{location of a}} hemolysin-bacteriocin determinant on the conjugative pAD 1 plasmid was derived from analyses of transposon insertions. Electron microscope and hybridization analyses located Tn 917 (Em) and the streptomycin (Sm) and kanamycin (Km) resistance determinants on the nonconjugative pAD 2 plasmid. It was shown previously that the erythromycin (Em) resistance associated with Tn 917 is inducible and that transposition from pAD 2 to pAD 1 is also stimulated by exposure of cells to low concentrations of Em. Here we show that inducing concentrations of Em also increase the conjugative transfer potential of pAD 1; this is possibly related to a <b>mild</b> and short-lived <b>inhibitory</b> stress placed on the cells before full induction of resistance. Selection of Em-resistant transconjugants arising from matings between DS 16 and a plasmid-free recipient gave rise to transconjugants which primarily harbor stable pAD 1 ::pAD 2 cointegrates. A 30 -min exposure of donors to Em (0. 5 microgram/ml) before mating resulted in a severalfold {{increase in the number}} of such transconjugants. However, a small fraction (e. g., 3 of 40) of these Emr Smr Kmr transconjugants harbored pAD 1 ::Tn 917 and pAD 2 molecules. Since we believe pAD 2 is incapable of being mobilized by pAD 1 without being covalently linked, it is likely that transfer in these cases involved cointegrates representing structural intermediates in the transposition of Tn 917 from pAD 2 to pAD 1. It follows that such intermediates probably had two copies of Tn 917 and readily resolved after transfer. (These cointegrates are different from the stable cointegrates which were shown to have only a single copy of Tn 917; the latter are assumed not to be related to transposition.) Two variants with altered Tn 917 transposition properties were derived. One of them transposed at an elevated frequency, whereas the other showed no detectabel transposition.

Therefore, the need to improve its quality through scientific studies have become paramount. In our efforts to address this important issue, we authenticated the botanical names of low altitude medicinal plants, determined the major classes of phytochemicals of 25 selected species, evaluated the bioactivities of the crude extracts of seven of them, and finally isolated the phytochemicals from six of these plants. We have established the antimalarial, anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, and cytotoxicity activities of these phytochemicals and also identified five novel drug lead compounds. In our ethnobotanical study; we resolved the traditional and taxonomical discrepancies for Bhutanese medicinal plants, assessed the current BTM formulations, and carried out the field survey for the low altitude medicinal plants (LAMP), which is described in Chapter 2. Out of 113 LAMP, 92 species are used in the current multiingredient formulations produced by Manjong Sorig Pharmaceuticals (MSP) and 28 of them are currently imported from India. Out of these 28 species, 16 of them are found growing abundantly in Bhutan and most of them have not been studied for their phytochemicals and pharmacological properties. In this study, we have selected 25 of these plants and assessed them for their major classes of phytochemicals which we have described in Chapter 3. Of these, the crude extracts of seven selected plants (Corydalis crispa, C. dubia, Ajania nubegina, Meconopsis simplicifolia, Pleurospermum amabile, Aconitum laciniatum and Codonopsis bhutanica) were investigated for their biological activities and we found that five of them possessed significant antiplasmodial activities, one species showed moderate cytotoxicity, two species exhibited moderate anti-Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense activity, six species exhibited significant to <b>mild</b> TNF-α <b>inhibitory</b> activities, and all seven plants exhibited mild antimicrobial activity. The highest antiplasmodial activity was exhibited by the chloroform extract of M. simplicifolia with an IC₅₀ value of 0. 40 μg/mL against the TM 4 / 8. 2 strain without cytotoxicity. The chloroform extract of C. crispa showed moderate cytotoxicity with an IC₅₀ value of 12. 5 μg/mL and the highest antiinflammatory activities. The chloroform extracts of P. amabile and also C. crispa exhibited moderate anti-Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense activity with IC₅₀ values of 16. 1 and 4. 6 μg/mL, respectively. The dichloromethane extract of P. amabile showed the highest antibacterial activity with a MIC value of 312 μg/mL or a MIZ value of 14 mm against B. subtilis. Guided by these preliminary bioactivity results, we have carried out the isolation of the phytochemicals from six of the seven aforementioned plants. A total of 43 compounds were isolated from these plants. Of these, 25 were alkaloids, nine were terpenoids, six were furanocoumarins, two were flavones and one was a glycosylated flavone. From C. crispa (described in Chapter 4), nine isoquinoline alkaloids 1 - 9 were isolated and protopine (1) was identified as the major alkaloid component. The characterization of compounds 2 and 3 with complete NMR data analysis was achieved by us for the first time. Similarly, from C. dubia (described in Chapter 5), another group of isoquinoline alkaloids 10 - 15 were isolated along with the alkaloids 1 and 9. Alkaloid 15 was isolated as a new natural product which we named as dubiamine after the plant’s name (C. dubia) and its structure was confirmed from its single crystal X-ray structural analysis. From A. nubigena (Chapter 6), nine compounds, 19 - 26 belonging to terpenoids, flavonoids and glycosylated flavones were isolated from the essential oil and crude methanol extract. While luteolin (25) was the major constituent of the MeOH extract, (3 R, 6 R) -linalool oxide acetate (19) was the major constituent (75. 8...|$|R
40|$|The {{estrogen}} receptor (ER) modulates transcription {{by forming}} complexes with other proteins and then binding to the estrogen response element (ERE). We {{have identified a}} novel interaction of this receptor with the POU transcription factors Brn- 3 a and Brn- 3 b which was independent of ligand binding. By pull-down assays and the yeast two-hybrid system, the POU domain of Brn- 3 a and Brn- 3 b was shown {{to interact with the}} DNA-binding domain of the ER. Brn- 3 –ER interactions also affect transcriptional activity of an ERE-containing promoter, such that in estradiol-stimulated cells, Brn- 3 b strongly activated the promoter via the ERE, while Brn- 3 a had a <b>mild</b> <b>inhibitory</b> effect. The POU domain of Brn- 3 b which interacts with the ER was sufficient to confer this activation potential, and the change of a single amino acid in the first helix of the POU homeodomain of Brn- 3 a to its equivalent in Brn- 3 b can change the mild repressive effect of Brn- 3 a to a stimulatory Brn- 3 b-like effect. These observations and their implications for transcriptional regulation by the ER are discussed...|$|E
40|$|International audienceOxidative {{damage has}} been {{reported}} {{to be involved in the}} pathogenesis of diabetic neuropathy and neurodegenerative diseases. Recent evidence suggests that the antidiabetic drug metformin prevents oxidative stress-related cellular death in non-neuronal cell lines. In this report, we point to the direct neuroprotective effect of metformin, using the etoposide-induced cell death model. The exposure of intact primary neurons to this cytotoxic insult induced permeability transition pore (PTP) opening, the dissipation of mitochondrial membrane potential (DeltaPsim), cytochrome c release, and subsequent death. More importantly, metformin, together with the PTP classical inhibitor cyclosporin A (CsA), strongly mitigated the activation of this apoptotic cascade. Furthermore, the general antioxidant N-acetyl-L: -cysteine also prevented etoposide-promoted neuronal death. In addition, metformin was shown to delay CsA-sensitive PTP opening in permeabilized neurons, as triggered by a calcium overload, probably through its <b>mild</b> <b>inhibitory</b> effect on the respiratory chain complex I. We conclude that (1) etoposide-induced neuronal death is partly attributable to PTP opening and the disruption of DeltaPsim, in association with the emergence of oxidative stress, and (2) metformin inhibits this PTP opening-driven commitment to death. We thus propose that metformin, beyond its antihyperglycemic role, can also function as a new therapeutic tool for diabetes-associated neurodegenerative disorders...|$|E
40|$|AbstractGlandora diffusa (Lag.) D. C. Thomas is a {{medicinal}} species widely consumed as herbal tea. Despite being commercialized {{by several}} herbs distributors, the genuineness of the marketed product is unknown. Among secondary metabolites with proven taxonomic interest, the phenolics profile was herein used as “fingerprint” of three commercial G. diffusa samples. Furthermore, the knowledge on {{the composition of}} this species was extended and its amino acids, fatty acids, sterols and triterpenes profiles were studied for the first time. The phenolics profile was characterized by HPLC-DAD. All other metabolites were determined by GC–MS. Despite similar qualitative profiles, significant quantitative differences were observed among the three samples. Their potential as antioxidant and anti-Alzheimer and cytotoxicity was evaluated and relationship between chemical composition and activities was considered. Ethanolic extracts showed a potent dose-dependent response against DPPH, a <b>mild</b> <b>inhibitory</b> effect on both acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE) and to be toxic to both human colorectal (Caco- 2) and gastric adenocarcinoma (AGS) cells only for high concentrations. This work covers interdisciplinary aspects in the pharmaceutical and biomedical sciences, by focusing on metabolic profiling and quality assurance of a medicinal species used in folk medicine. The results improve the knowledge on G. diffusa and encourage its use, not only as herbal tea, as it is traditionally consumed, but also in pharmaceutical preparations, ethanol being a cheap and feasible solvent to recover its bioactive components...|$|E
40|$|Natural {{products}} {{have been the}} source of numerous leads for several drugs. As these natural products are often isolated in small quantities, it is necessary to produce them synthetically to allow testing for biological activity. Furthermore, synthesis allows the preparation of unnatural analogues for SAR studies. Cyclic peptides represent an important family of biologically active natural products. The hepta- and octacyclopeptides sanguinamide A and sanguinamide B were recently isolated in submicromolar amounts by the Molinski group. The lack of material prevented biological evaluation of the natural products. For this reason and to confirm the structural elucidation we have targeted the total synthesis of sanguinamides. In addition to two proline residues, sanguinamides A and B include heterocycles and natural L-amino acid residues. We have completed the total syntheses of sanguinamides A and B; however the synthetic rotamers differed in both cases from the natural rotamers. We have investigated the influence of macrocyclisation on cis/trans conformational preference of the proline residues for the synthesis of sanguinamide A. We attempted several isomerisations and calculated the relative energies of the different sanguinamide conformers. [D-Ile]-Sanguinamide A, Cys(tBu) analogue of sanguinamide A and the synthetic sanguinamide B displayed antibacterial activity while the synthetic trans, trans-sanguinamide A displayed <b>mild</b> tyrosine kinase <b>inhibitory</b> activity. While extracted stylissamide A showed inhibition of translation during the elongation step, even though being structurally identical to the natural product, the synthetic compound prepared by macrocyclisation from a linear precursor was found to be totally inactive. Histones undergo different types of covalent modifications on the N-terminal tails such as acetylation, phosphorylation and methylation. Histone modification is a major mechanism of regulation in gene expression, replication and repair. Deregulation of histone modifications leads to cancer progression and therefore, inhibitors of enzymes which are able to catalyse the addition and removal of these epigenetic marks have therapeutic potential for treating cancer. An enzyme of particular interest is the family of zinc-dependent histone deacetylases (HDACs) that remove acetyl groups from acetylated lysine residues. Depsipeptides were prepared as HDAC inhibitors. We will ii present our total synthesis of largazole along with a range of analogues and discuss the SAR obtained from HDAC and cell proliferation assays. We elucidated the stereochemistry of burkholdac B by total synthesis of three diastereomers. The diastereomers made along with the natural product were tested as HDAC inhibitors. We are interested in inhibitors of lysine-specific demethylase 1 (LSD 1) which {{is a different kind of}} epigenetic enzyme involved in demethylation of histone proteins in chromatin. Tranylcypromine is known to be an LSD 1 inhibitor. Analogues of PCPA have been synthesised in order to explore the structure-activity relationships of this inhibitor. Analogues were also prepared and tested as LSD 1 inhibitors. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
40|$|Nanoparticles (NPs) have unique electronic, {{optical and}} {{chemical}} properties {{due to the}} extreme small size. Engineered nanoparticles (ENPs) are intentionally produced for desired applications, with specific properties related to shape, size, surface properties and chemistry. Nano-sized silica (SiO 2), alumina (Al 2 O 3) and ceria (CeO 2) are three important ENPs with large production and wide applications. One of the principal uses of these ENPs is in chemical and mechanical planarization (CMP), a key process applied to polish wafers when fabricating integrated circuits in semiconductor manufacturing, in which SiO 2, Al 2 O 3 and CeO 2 NPs are used as abrasive particles in CMP slurries. CMP generates large amounts of waste effluents containing high levels of ENPs. Some ENPs have been proven {{to be able to}} cause toxicity to microorganisms and higher life forms, including humans. Therefore, there are concerns about the potential risks that ENPs may pose to the natural environment and human health. In addition, III-V materials like indium arsenide (InAs) and gallium arsenide (GaAs) are increasingly used in electronic and photovoltaic devices. Besides ENPs, the waste streams from III-V manufacturing also contain dissolved and particulate materials removed from III-V films during CMP. Arsenic {{is one of the most}} notorious contaminants that has been widely studied, while only very limited ecotoxicity information is available for gallium and indium. Finally, since ENPs have high surface area, it is very likely they will interact with the soluble species (such as arsenic ions) in CMP wastewater. Therefore, it is of great importance to understand whether the interactions between these materials could alter their fate and toxicity. The objective of this work is to investigate the potential environmental and health risks from the ENPs and III-V materials used in semiconductor manufacturing. To this end, the physical, chemical and toxicological characterization of ENPs used in CMP was performed (Chapter 3). Furthermore, the fate and transport of the most used ENP, SiO 2, in porous media was studied (Chapter 4). In addition, acute toxicity of As(III), As(V), In(III) and Ga(III) species was evaluated using different bioassays (Chapter 5). Finally, the cytotoxicity of ENPs used in CMP slurries to human lung bronchial epithelial cells was evaluated using an impedance based real time cell analysis (RTCA) assay (Chapter 6). In Chapter 3, four model slurries containing ENPs including colloidal silica (c-SiO 2), fumed silica (f-SiO 2) cerium oxide (CeO 2) and aluminum oxide (Al 2 O 3) were characterized for their physical, chemical and toxicological properties. Ecotoxicity of these slurries to the marine bacterium, Aliivibrio fischeri, was evaluated by measuring its bioluminescence activity as a function of the ENP concentration dosed. The results showed that f-SiO 2 and CeO 2 were not toxic at concentrations up to 700 and 1000 mg/L, respectively. On the other hand, c-SiO 2 and Al 2 O 3 were inhibitory only at very high concentrations (> 600 mg/L). At about 1300 mg/L, c-SiO 2 and Al 2 O 3 led to 37. 6 % and 28. 4 % decrease of cell activity after 30 min exposure, respectively. The inhibitory effect from c-SiO 2 was related to additives in the slurry. In summary, the results indicate that these slurries are not likely to cause acute toxicity at environmentally relevant concentrations. The potential risks from ENPs are dependent on their fate and transport in the environment. In Chapter 4, the transport and abatement of SiO 2 NPs was studied through laboratory scale column experiments. Synthetic fluorescent core-shell SiO 2 NPs (83 nm) were used to facilitate NP traceability. Three widely used filtering materials, i. e., sand, anthracite and granular activated carbon (GAC), were used as porous media. Sand showed very poor capacity for the filtration of SiO 2 NPs due to its limited surface area and high concentration of negative surface charge. In addition, the stability and transport of SiO 2 NP was strongly dependent on the ionic strength of the solution. High ionic strength led to NP agglomeration and facilitated SiO 2 NP retention, while low ionic strength resulted in release of captured NPs from the sand bed. Compared to sand, anthracite and GAC showed higher efficiency for SiO 2 NP capture. The superior capacity of GAC was primarily due to its porous structure and high surface area. A process model was developed to simulate NP capture in the packed bed columns and determine fundamental attraction parameters. This model provided an excellent fit to the experimental data. Taken together the results obtained indicate that GAC is an interesting material for SiO 2 NPs filtration. With the increasing usage of III-V materials, there are concerns about the ecological threats posed by III-V ions released during semiconductor manufacturing and from disposal of decommissioned electronic devices. In Chapter 5, the acute toxicity of As(III), As(V), In(III) and Ga(III) species was evaluated using different bioassays, including three microbial assays, testing for methanogenic activity, O 2 uptake and bioluminescence inhibition of marine bacterium A. fischeri. Acute toxicity to the freshwater crustacean Daphnia magna was also tested. The results showed that In(III) and Ga(III) were generally not toxic or only mildly toxic in all assays, while both As(III) and As(V) showed strong inhibitory effects on different microbial activities (methanogenic and bioluminescence). The toxicity of these ions was strongly dependent on the bioassay target. For In(III) and Ga(III), D. magna was the most sensitive organism with 50 % lethal concentrations (LC 50) of 57. 4 and 237. 0 mg/L, respectively. On the other hand, As(III) and As(V) were particularly toxic to methanogens. The 50 % inhibitory concentrations (IC 50) of both species were about 1. 5 mg/L. Mixed aerobic heterotrophic culture was highly resistant to all four ions and O 2 uptake by the aerobes was not affected in the tested concentrations. Overall, the results indicate that the ecotoxicity of In(III) and Ga(III) is much lower than that of the As species. This finding is important in filling the knowledge gap regarding the ecotoxicology of In and Ga. Besides ecotoxicity, ENPs and III-V materials in CMP effluents could also pose a threat to human health. In Chapter 6, the cytotoxicity of CMP slurries to human bronchial epithelial cells (16 HBE 14 o-) was assessed using a novel impedance based real time cell analyzer (RTCA). Cell death and detachment was observed in assays supplied with high concentrations of c-SiO 2 and f-SiO 2 NPs (≥ 250 mg/L). On the other hand, CeO 2 and Al 2 O 3 slurries were not inhibitory at concentrations up to 1250 mg/L. In addition, since CMP wastewater generated during the planarization of III-V films contains a mixture of ENPs and soluble III-V species, it is important to understand whether the interactions between these materials could alter their fate and toxicity. As(III) toxicity to human lung cells in the presence and absence of CeO 2 NPs was evaluated using the RTCA assay. Exposure to As(III) (0. 5 mg/L) for 48 h resulted in 81. 3 % inhibition of cell viability and proliferation, while cell inhibition decreased to only 13. 0 % when As(III) was dosed together with sub-toxic levels of CeO 2 NPs (250 mg/L). This detoxification effect was mainly due to As(III) adsorption onto CeO 2 NPs. When the NPs were added, the soluble arsenic concentration was reduced significantly from 0. 5 mg/L to 0. 03 mg/L. This work demonstrates that adsorption of As(III) on CeO 2 NPs can lower As(III) concentration in the solution and reduce its bioavailability and subsequently result in As(III) detoxification. In conclusion, this dissertation indicates that the ENPs (SiO 2, CeO 2 and Al 2 O 3) used in semiconductor industry are not expected to cause acute toxicity to the natural environment and human health under environmentally relevant concentration (< 1 mg/L). Among the soluble III-V species, In(III) and Ga(III) showed no or <b>mild</b> acute <b>inhibitory</b> effects in different bioassays even at comparatively high concentration. However arsenic species are highly toxic to various important microbial populations in the environment and human cells. The results showed that arsenic could induce toxic effects under current discharge limit set for semiconductor industry. Finally, we demonstrated that the adsorption of As(III) on CeO 2 NPs can lower the concentration of soluble As(III) and subsequently resulted in As(III) detoxification...|$|R

One of the potential alternative therapies for renal cell carcinoma may be inhibition of angiogenesis. In this study, we analysed the inhibitory effects of several potential agents on expression of angiogenic factors such as vascular endothelial growth factor and basic fibroblast growth factor, which are the main mediators in angiogenesis of renal cell carcinoma. We used medroxyprogesterone acetate, interferon-alpha, interferon-gamma, minocycline hydrochrolide and genistein, which {{are known to be}} antiangiogeneic. Northern blot analyses revealed that, among the five agents examined, genistein had a strong inhibitory effect on expression of vascular endothelial growth factor mRNA and basic fibroblast growth factor mRNA. Medroxyprogesterone acetate and interferon-alpha did not significantly decrease the level of either vascular endothelial growth factor mRNA or basic fibroblast growth factor mRNA. Interferon-gamma and minocycline had <b>mild</b> <b>inhibitory</b> effects on vascular endothelial growth factor mRNA and basic fibroblast growth factor mRNA expression. Genistein also inhibited both vascular endothelial growth factor mRNA and basic fibroblast growth factor mRNA expression after treatment with epidermal growth factor and hypoxia. These findings suggest that one of the mechanisms of the inhibition of angiogenesis by genistein is suppression of the expression of the angiogenic factors vascular endothelial growth factor and basic fibroblast growth factor in renal cell carcinoma...|$|E
