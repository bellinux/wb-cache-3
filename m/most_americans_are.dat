5|$|In {{terms of}} social class the average American may be {{referred}} to as being either a member of the middle or working class. The discrepancy is largely the result of differing class models and definitions of what constitutes a member of the middle class. Currently the vast majority of Americans self-identify as middle class, yet some experts in the field such Michael Zweig of Stony Brook University or Dennis Gilbert of Cornell University have brought forth different theories. As <b>most</b> <b>Americans</b> <b>are</b> neither professionals nor managers and lack college degrees the average American may be described as being either or both, lower middle and working class.|$|E
25|$|Factors such {{as nature}} {{of work and}} lack of {{influence}} within their jobs leads some theorists {{to the conclusion that}} <b>most</b> <b>Americans</b> <b>are</b> working class. They have data that shows the majority of workers are not paid to share their ideas. These workers are closely supervised and do not enjoy independence in their jobs. Also, they are not paid to think. For example: The median annual earnings of salaried dentists were $136,960 in May 2006, indicating a high degree of scarcity for qualified personnel. The opinions and thoughts of dentists, much like those of other professionals, are sought after by their organizations and clients. The dentist creates a diagnosis, consults the patient, and conceptualizes a treatment. In 2009, Dental assistants made roughly $14.40 an hour, about $32,000 annually. Unlike dentists, dental assistants do not have much influence over the treatment of patients. They carry out routine procedures and follow the dentists' instructions. Here we see that a dental assistant being classified as working class. Similar relationships can be observed in other occupations.|$|E

500|$|Satin {{presents}} Radical Middle as {{a revised}} and evolved {{version of his}} New Age Politics book, {{rather than as a}} rejection of it. [...] Some observers had always seen him as a radical centrist. [...] As early as 1980, author Marilyn Ferguson identified him as part of what she called the [...] "Radical Center". [...] In 1987, culture critic Annie Gottlieb said Satin was trying to prompt the New Age and New Left to evolve into a [...] "New Center". [...] But the revisions Satin introduces are substantial. [...] Instead of defining politics as a means for creating the ideal society, as he did in New Age Politics, he defines radical middle politics as [...] "idealism without illusions"– more creative and future-oriented than politics-as-usual, but willing to face [...] "the hard facts on the ground". [...] Rather than arguing that change will be brought about by a third force, he says <b>most</b> <b>Americans</b> <b>are</b> already radical middle– [...] "we're very practical folks, and we're very idealistic and visionary as well." ...|$|E

2500|$|In the United States, {{the main}} {{actors in the}} {{abortion}} debate are most often labeled either as [...] "pro-choice" [...] or [...] "pro-life", though shades of opinion exist, and <b>most</b> <b>Americans</b> <b>are</b> considered to be somewhere in the middle. A Gallup.com survey of 1014 adults found that opinions on abortion in the United States remain nearly evenly split, with 46% of participants identifying as pro-life, and 47% identifying as pro-choice. The poll results also indicated that Americans harbor a diverse and shifting set of opinions on {{the legal status of}} abortion in the US; the survey polled that only 28% of respondents believed abortion should be legal under unlimited circumstances, and 48% of respondents believed that abortion should be legal under [...] "most" [...] or [...] "only a few circumstances". Recent polling results also found that only 34% of Americans were satisfied with abortion laws in the United States.|$|E
6000|$|Later we laid our bones down to {{crossing}} the Rockies. An American train can {{climb up the}} side of a house if need be, but it is not pleasant to sit in it. We clomb till we struck violent cold and an Indian reservation, and the noble savage came to look at us. He was a Flathead and unlovely. <b>Most</b> <b>Americans</b> <b>are</b> charmingly frank about the Indian. [...] "Let us get rid of him as soon as possible," [...] they say. [...] "We have no use for him." [...] Some of the men I meet have a notion that we in India are exterminating the native in the same fashion, and I have been asked to fix a date for the final extinguishment of the Aryan. I answer {{that it will be a}} long business. Very many Americans have an offensive habit of referring to natives as [...] "heathen." [...] Mahometans and Hindus are heathen alike in their eyes, and they vary the epithet with [...] "pagan" [...] and [...] "idolater." [...] But this is beside the matter, which is the Stampede Tunnel--our actual point of {{crossing the}} Rockies. Thank Heaven, I need never take that tunnel again! It is about two miles long, and in effect is nothing more than the gallery of a mine shored with timber and lighted with electric lamps. Black darkness would be preferable, for the lamps just reveal the rough cutting of the rocks, and that is very rough indeed. The train crawls through, brakes down, and you can hear the water and little bits of stone falling on the roof of the car. Then you pray, pray fervently, and the air gets stiller and stiller, and you dare not take your unwilling eyes off the timber shoring, lest a prop should fall, for lack of your moral support. Before the tunnel was built you crossed in the open air by a switchback line. A watchman goes through the tunnel after each train, but that is no protection. He just guesses that another train will pull through, and the engine-driver guesses the same thing. Some day between the two of them there will be a cave in the tunnel. Then the enterprising reporter will talk about the shrieks and groans of the buried and the heroic efforts of the Press in securing first information, and--that will be all. Human life is of small account out here.|$|E

5000|$|Another {{illustration}} {{of how people}} attempt to control how others perceive them is portrayed through the clothing they wear. A person {{who is in a}} leadership position strives to be respected and in order to control and maintain the impression. This illustration can also be adapted for a cultural scenario. The clothing people choose to wear says {{a great deal about the}} person and the culture they represent.

Although <b>most</b> African <b>Americans</b> <b>are</b> not living below the poverty line, what is middle-class for <b>most</b> white <b>Americans</b> <b>is</b> vastly different to what is middle-class for <b>most</b> African <b>Americans.</b> The few black professionals in all-white neighborhoods are not representative of the African American middle class by any stretch. Rather, <b>most</b> African <b>Americans</b> <b>are</b> lower middle-class living from paycheck to paycheck, employed in such jobs as retail, and facing many problems and circumstances worse off even than poor whites. Hence, what is vastly missing from the African <b>American</b> community <b>is</b> a cohesive, central middle class.|$|R
