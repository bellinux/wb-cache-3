5|$|Each team in {{the league}} has a <b>manager,</b> <b>who</b> is {{responsible}} for team strategy and leadership on and off the field. Assisted by various coaches, the manager sets the line-up and starting pitcher before each game, and makes substitutions throughout the game. In early baseball history, it was not uncommon for players to fill multiple roles as player-managers; specifically, they managed the team while still being signed to play for the club. The last player-manager in Major League Baseball was Pete Rose, who began managing the Cincinnati Reds in 1984.|$|E

40|$|I {{investigate}} why {{the majority}} of firms do not issue earnings warnings {{in the face of}} upcoming earnings disappointments. SEC Rule 10 b- 5 imposes a duty on managers to correct or update when they discover that prior disclosures are misleading. I posit that managers assess the 10 b- 5 duty to disclose based on private information about optimism and misstatements embedded in their prior disclosures. Specifically, I hypothesize that <b>managers</b> <b>who</b> did not issue forecasts or <b>managers</b> <b>who</b> previously issued non-optimistic forecasts {{are more likely to be}} silent about upcoming earnings disappointments than <b>managers</b> <b>who</b> previously issued optimistic forecasts. I also hypothesize that <b>managers</b> <b>who</b> perceive that prior disclosures include misstatements that are difficult to verify in the court are more likely to remain silent than are <b>managers</b> <b>who</b> perceive that prior disclosures include misstatements that are easy to verify in the court. My results support these hypotheses. In additional tests, after controlling for the endogeneity between warnings and the likelihood of litigation, I find that earnings warnings issued by <b>managers</b> <b>who</b> perceive that they are not bound by a duty to disclose increase litigation risk. I also find that warnings by firms with misstatements containing less verifiable information do not reduce settlement costs when these firms are sued. Overall, my evidence indicates that when managers perceive that they have no duty to disclose, their earnings warnings are likely to have an adverse impact on litigation risk and, thus, managers are likely to remain silent to avoid this outcome. published_or_final_versionBusinessDoctoralDoctor of Philosoph...|$|R
