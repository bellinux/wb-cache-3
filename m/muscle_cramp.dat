30|$|From this work, we {{conclude}} that <b>muscle</b> <b>cramping</b> and near cramping are common in a 161 -km ultramarathon, largely involve the most active muscles, and tend to occur after the early segment of the race. Compared with those not having cramping, those with cramping or near cramping {{are more likely to}} have a prior history of <b>muscle</b> <b>cramping</b> during an ultramarathon, and evidence suggests that they are placing greater demands on their muscles during the race relative to their current state of training. Hydration status, intake rate of sodium in supplements, and serum sodium concentration do not differ between those with and without cramping. Of the two main theories for the pathophysiology of exercise-associated <b>muscle</b> <b>cramping,</b> the present findings support a muscle fatigue basis for <b>muscle</b> <b>cramping</b> during ultra-endurance exercise over the theory based on hyperexcitability of motor neuron axon terminals due to an electrolyte or fluid imbalance.|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) is an immune-mediated {{multisystemic}} {{disorder and}} {{the leading cause}} of morbidity after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Peripheral nervous system manifestations of GVHD are rare but often disabling. Whereas immune-mediated neuropathies are an established feature of GVHD, <b>muscle</b> <b>cramps</b> are not well characterized. METHODS: In a single-centre retrospective cohort we studied 27 patients (age 23 to 69 years) with GVHD (acute n =  6, chronic n =  21) who complained of symptoms suggestive of peripheral nervous system complications. Clinical, laboratory and neurophysiological findings were evaluated by descriptive statistics and regression analysis to detect factors associated with <b>muscle</b> <b>cramps.</b> Patient's sera were examined for anti-neuronal antibodies. RESULTS: Nine patients had polyneuropathy, 4 had <b>muscle</b> <b>cramps,</b> and 14 had both. Median onset of polyneuropathy and <b>muscle</b> <b>cramps</b> was 6 and 9 months after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, respectively. Neurophysiology revealed a predominantly axonal polyneuropathy in 20 of 26 patients. In 4 of 19 patients electromyography showed signs of myopathy or myositis. <b>Muscle</b> <b>cramps</b> were more frequent during chronic than acute GVHD and affected muscles other than calves in 15 of 18 patients. They typically occurred daily, lasted 1 to 10 minutes with medium to severe pain intensity, compromised daily activity or sleep in 12, and were refractory to therapy in 4 patients. <b>Muscle</b> <b>cramps</b> were less likely with tacrolimus treatment and signs of severe polyneuropathy, but more likely with myopathic changes in electromyography and with incipient demyelinating polyneuropathy, shown by increased high frequency attenuation of the tibial nerve. Serological studies revealed antinuclear or antimitochondrial antibodies in a subset of patients. Two of 16 patients had a serum reactivity against peripheral nervous tissue. CONCLUSION: <b>Muscle</b> <b>cramps</b> are associated with chronic GVHD, often compromise daily activity, and correlate negatively with axonal polyneuropathy and positively with myopathy and incipient demyelination...|$|R
50|$|Positive illusions remain {{constant}} for {{the majority}} of one's life due to self-deception. Self-deception strategies are mental tricks of a person's mind that hide the truth and constitute false beliefs. Due to self-deception, people are able to obtain resiliency upon negative events that might occur throughout life. This also can reinforce different ideas or thoughts that the person wishes and hopes for. The self-serving bias is a strategy in which a person titles acknowledgment for success and rejects blame for failure. For example, a person who wins a track meet would glorify their ability as an athlete. However, if that person were to come in last in the meet, the person would most likely put blame on constituting factors such as a <b>muscle</b> <b>cramp</b> or previous injury preventing a good performance. Another strategy that people use is greater criticism involving bad feedback rather than good. A person would judge a situation more harshly when they did worse, while the opposite would occur for a situation that entailed good feedback.|$|E
5000|$|The second {{hypothesis}} is altered neuromuscular control. In this hypothesis, {{it is suggested}} that cramping is due to altered neuromuscular activity. The proposed underlying cause of the altered neuromuscular control is due to fatigue. [...] There are several disturbances, at various levels of the central and peripheral nervous system, and the skeletal muscle that contribute to cramping. These disturbances can be described by a series of several key events. First and foremost, repetitive muscle exercise can lead to the development of fatigue due to {{one or more of the}} following: inadequate conditioning, hot and or humid environments, increased intensity, increased duration, and decreased supply of energy. Muscle fatigue itself causes increased excitatory afferent activity within the muscle spindles and decreased inhibitory afferent activity within the Golgi tendon. The coupling of these events leads to altered neuromuscular control from the spinal cord. A cascade of events follow the altered neuromuscular control; this includes increased alpha-motor neuron activity in the spinal cord, which overloads the lower motor neurons, and increased muscle cell membrane activity. Thus, the resultant of this cascade is a <b>muscle</b> <b>cramp.</b>|$|E

40|$|Background: <b>Muscle</b> <b>cramps</b> {{are common}} {{complains}} during pregnancy <b>muscle</b> <b>cramps</b> occur mostly during nights causing sleep disorder. The causes of <b>muscle</b> <b>cramps</b> are unknown. One probable cause {{could be the}} imbalance between intake and excretion of serum electrolyte such as calcium. Methods: The method used {{for the present study}} was double blind clinical trial. The study was conducted on 60 pregnant women suffering from leg <b>muscle</b> <b>cramps</b> who sought medical treatment in three selected clinics in Bushehr from April 2006 to November 2007. All subjects being third trimester of pregnancy, single pregnant, only used iron and multivitamins. Irregular use of medication, PLP (Preterm Labor Pain), disability completion forms excluded of study. Simple and accessible sampling was used in this study. Selection of study group and placebo were random. Visual analog forms were used to record the number and intensity of <b>muscle</b> <b>cramps.</b> These forms had provisions for 7 days of pretreatment and 28 days of treatments. At {{the end of the first}} week, the subjects were prescribed to take medications every night for four weeks. The subjects were asked to record the intensity of their <b>muscle</b> <b>cramps</b> on the visual analog forms during these four weeks. Results: The number and intensity of <b>muscle</b> <b>cramps</b> were considered in this study. The results of the study showed no significant change in intensity in the two groups. However, there was a significant reduction in the number of cramps in the study group after taking calcium (p=< 0. 02 < 0. 05). Conclusion: Taking calcium resulted in a significant reduction in the number of cramps in this study compared to placebo group. Therefore, prescribing calcium is effective in reducing the number of cramps, when the numbers of occurrences are excessive. In cases of highly intensive and painful cramps, however, taking calcium is as effective as placebo...|$|R

40|$|<b>Muscle</b> <b>cramp</b> is a forceful, {{involuntary}} {{contraction of}} skeletal muscle, but its underlying mechanisms {{are not well}} understood. Our limited understanding of <b>muscle</b> <b>cramp</b> {{may be due to}} its unreliable occurrence. Electrical train stimulation (ETS) has been reported to induce cramp in the small flexor muscles of the foot, and a relationship exists between the threshold frequency (TF) of ETS to induce cramp and <b>muscle</b> <b>cramp</b> susceptibility. The use of ETS to induce <b>muscle</b> <b>cramp</b> in the calf muscles however may be challenging, and the test-retest reliability of this method has not been examined in the calf muscles. Since athletes can experience <b>muscle</b> <b>cramp</b> in the calf muscles, in turn affecting their athletic performance, it is necessary to establish a method to assess calf <b>muscle</b> <b>cramp.</b> The first purpose of this study therefore was to determine the usefulness of the ETS application to the calf muscles, along with its reliability. Using a Compex 2 stimulator, ETS was applied to the calf muscles of both dominant and non-dominant legs in 10 men (33. 5 ± 8. 4 y) who reported experiencing cramp during training or competition. Each leg was treated separately in a counterbalanced order, with subjects in the supine position and legs supported by a bench that fixed the ankle at maximal plantarflexion. ETS consisted of 2 s (including 500 ms ramp time) of 300 μs square pulsed waves followed by 30 s rest. ETS commenced with two bouts of stimulation at 10 Hz during which the stimulation intensity was increased to the maximum tolerated, with values of 46. 9 ± 6. 5 and 45. 4 ± 7. 7 mA for the dominant and non-dominant legs, respectively. Subsequent stimulation trains increased by 3 Hz until cramp occurred, as confirmed by a spontaneous electromyograph (EMG) signal. The protocol was repeated 30 min after the first test, with the entire testing procedure repeated seven days later. <b>Muscle</b> <b>cramp</b> was induced in all subjects, but the TF varied amongst subjects (13 - 55 Hz). Mean TF value to induce muscle camp for the dominant leg was 25. 0 ± 7. 6 Hz for the first test and 23. 7 ± 5. 0 Hz for the second test. The non-dominant leg also showed similar values.

40|$|Abstract Background Night-time calf {{cramping}} affects approximately 1 in 3 adults. The aim of {{this study}} was to explore the experience of night-time calf cramp; if and where people seek treatment advice; and perceived treatment effectiveness. Methods 80 adults who experienced night-time calf cramp at least once per week were recruited from the Hunter region, NSW, Australia through newspaper, radio and television advertisements. All participants completed a pilot-tested survey about <b>muscle</b> <b>cramp.</b> Quantitative data were analysed with independent-sample t -tests, Chi square tests and Fisher's tests. Qualitative data were transcribed and sorted into categories to identify themes. Results Median recalled age of first night-time calf cramp was 50 years. Most participants recalled being awoken from sleep by cramping, and experiencing cramping of either calf muscle, calf-muscle soreness in the days following cramp and cramping during day-time. Despite current therapies, mean usual pain intensity was 66 mm on a 100 mm visual analogue scale. Participants described their cramps as being ' unbearable ', ' unmanageable ' and ' cruel '. One participant stated that ' sometimes I just wish I could cut my legs open ' and another reported ' getting about 2 h sleep a night due to cramps '. Most participants had sought advice about their night-time calf cramps from a health professional. Participants identified 49 different interventions used to prevent night-time calf cramp. Of all treatment ratings, 68 % described the intervention used to prevent cramp as being 'useless' or of 'a little help'. Of 14 participants who provided additional information regarding their use of quinine, eight had a current prescription of quinine for <b>muscle</b> <b>cramp</b> at the time of the survey. None had been asked by their prescribing doctor to stop using quinine. Conclusion Night time calf cramps typically woke sufferers from sleep, affected either leg and caused ongoing pain.

We present a case series illustrating an association between imatinib, relative hypocalcaemia, {{and the development of}} cramps. Patients. The index patient developed <b>muscle</b> spasms and <b>cramps</b> after receiving imatinib for gastrointestinal stromal tumour (GIST) for 5 months. The adjusted serum calcium had dropped to the lower limit of normal. The low serum calcium and <b>muscle</b> <b>cramps</b> improved on stopping imatinib and recurred on rechallenge. We reviewed the medical records of 16 further patients. Results. Two patients reported <b>muscle</b> <b>cramps</b> (12 %).
