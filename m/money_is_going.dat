Keith and Harmony flirt, and Harmony shows a good amount of true romantic interest in Keith. Logan’s family has been donating $10,000 a month to “Aaron’s Kids”, which Veronica learns is not actually a charity. Veronica talks to Chip, who says that he was with another girl, who admits it while saying that she’ll never say so openly. Veronica turns her suspicion on Dick. After doing more digging, Veronica says that the <b>money</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> to Logan’s illegitimate brother, Charlie Stone. Parker insults Veronica for supposedly working with the fraternity. Keith catches Harmony’s husband kissing another woman. After talking to one of the other rape victims, Veronica discusses Claire with a slightly offbeat clerk, who says that Claire went in with a guy. Logan meets Charlie (Matt Czuchry), and they connect over surfing. However, Veronica notices some inconsistencies at Charlie’s private school job.|$|E

25|$|Capacity {{building}} {{is an ongoing}} process, and is often intangible. This is why many nonprofit organizations {{have not been able}} to engage or transition more towards capacity building.

25|$|Regardless of the {{difficulty}} in measurement, {{the amount of money}} laundered each year is in the billions of US dollars and poses a significant policy concern for governments. As a result, governments and international bodies have undertaken efforts to deter, prevent, and apprehend money launderers. Financial institutions have likewise undertaken efforts to prevent and detect transactions involving dirty money, both as a result of government requirements and to avoid the reputational risk involved. Issues relating to money laundering have existed as long as there have been large scale criminal enterprises. Modern anti-money laundering laws have developed along with the modern War on Drugs. In more recent times anti-money laundering legislation is seen as adjunct to the financial crime of terrorist financing in that both crimes usually involve the transmission of funds through the financial system (although money laundering relates to where the money has come from, and terrorist financing relating to where the <b>money</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> to).|$|E

2500|$|In 2012, Cohen {{sponsored}} the Cohen Amendment reducing infrastructure funding to Afghanistan. The Afghan Infrastructure Fund {{has been plagued}} with problems, with millions of taxpayer dollars disappearing. When {{another member of the}} House said the funding was essential to bringing our troops home, Cohen replied “The {{truth of the matter is}} that it has nothing to do with whether we can bring our troops home or not. [...] The truth is that we cannot account for where this <b>money</b> <b>is</b> <b>going,</b> and it is likely going into the pockets of the top one-half of one percent in Afghanistan. [...] The infrastructure holds up well enough there to deploy and redeploy our troops, so it’s good enough to bring them home permanently.” The Amendment passed 228–191 and is the first piece of legislation reducing funding to Afghanistan.|$|E
2500|$|On August 13, 2008, Hunter's sister, Roxanne Druck Marshall, {{participated in}} an {{interview}} with CBS, in which she personally apologized to John Edwards' wife for her sister's behavior. She also claimed Edwards had lied in his confession, because the affair was of a longer duration than the timeframe that he had claimed and was still ongoing. Marshall also stated that, {{in the days after the}} story broke, Edwards provided Hunter and her baby with a new and secret domicile to prevent media reporters from finding her. She also called upon Edwards to tell the complete truth about the affair. During that same day, an article from CBS News was published saying, [...] "CBS News legal analyst, Mickey Sherman, told Early Show co-anchor, Maggie Rodriguez, that Edwards may be in legal jeopardy if it could be shown that the funds were used for purposes other than the ones that they had been assigned for. [...] "If you raise money to run for (office)", Sherman explained, [...] "and if you take that money that people have contributed to you based upon the fact that they think their <b>money</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> to a presidential candidate, and you give it to a girlfriend of a God-knows-what ... that's a crime. The New York Daily News also reported on that same day that, when questioned about the affair by reporters, Mimi Hockman, Hunter's partner in the Midline Groove video production company, [...] "said the contract they signed with John Edwards had a 'hefty' confidentiality clause that bars her from talking." [...] Two days earlier, on August 11, 2008, Hockman had been questioned by reporters from the Star-Ledger at her home.

25|$|Reports of {{increasing}} friction {{in the marriage}} appeared, with speculation that some of this may have also been due to financial resources not being as abundantly available to Alice as she was accustomed to in the past.

2500|$|Breast cancer culture, or pink ribbon culture, is {{the set of}} activities, attitudes, {{and values}} that {{surround}} and shape breast cancer in public. The dominant values are selflessness, cheerfulness, unity, and optimism. [...] It is pro-doctor, pro-medicine, and pro-mammogram. Health care professionals are sources of information, but the rightness of their advice {{is not to be}} seriously questioned by women with breast cancer. Patients are not encouraged to ask where research <b>money</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> or if the research industry is making progress in finding the [...] "cure". [...] The emphasis on cheerfulness allows society to blame women for developing breast cancer and limits their responses to certain culturally determined scripts. [...] The requirement of cheerful optimism arose from the theory that cancer had a psychosomatic origin and that people who were diagnosed with cancer had a [...] "cancer personality" [...] that was depressed, repressed, and self-loathing. Psychotherapy was therefore considered an adjunct treatment used to produce a cheerful, self-affirming identity. This theory was predominant among psychiatrists through the 1970s, but has since been discredited. [...] In a process called benefit finding, the she-ro uses the emotional trauma of being diagnosed with breast cancer and the suffering of extended treatment to transform herself into a stronger, happier and more sensitive person who is grateful for the opportunity to become a better person. In particular, she sees breast cancer as an opportunity to give herself permission for necessary personal growth that she felt she was prohibited from or unable to make before. Breast cancer thereby becomes a rite of passage rather than a disease, with pink ribbon culture honoring the suffering of its she-roes by selecting them based on the amount of misery they have experienced and leading women whose treatment is less painful or debilitating to feel excluded and devalued. The suffering, particularly the extended suffering of months of chemotherapy and radiation treatment, forms a metaphorical type of ordeal or rite of passage that initiates women into the inner circle of breast cancer culture.

2500|$|Leiweke in {{the past}} had said that even without an {{expansion}} the stadium needed $30 million in repairs, and that the original agreement called {{for the city and}} MLSE to split that bill equally. [...] Instead, MLSE looked for $10 million in public funding from each of the municipal, provincial, and federal governments to top up their $90 million contribution, plus any cost overruns, for the expansion. [...] MLSE argued that the new stadium would result in $8 million in economic benefits, including taxes, accruing to the province annually, and $18 million in taxes on the construction project. [...] The company has agreed to pay a fixed annual rental fee of $865,000 to the City for the upgraded stadium, rather than the variable revenue sharing model under the present agreement which returned an average of $397,000 to the city over the previous five years, to help ensure that the city recoups its investment. [...] The new arrangement guaranteed the city $25.4 million, and with the projected $6 million in parking revenues the $31 million in revenue over the term of the lease would be $19 million more than under the former agreement. [...] As manager of the stadium, MLSE gets any profit turned by the stadium, and is responsible for any losses. [...] MLSE's management and naming rights agreement for the stadium, which was set to expire in 2027, were extended by 10 years under the proposal. [...] The agreement requires MLSE to reach a [...] "long-term use (i.e. 20 years)" [...] lease with the Argos for usage of the stadium starting in 2015. [...] The proposed renovations were unanimously approved by the Board of Governors of Exhibition Place on March 7, and the City of Toronto's Executive Committee gave their consent on March 19. [...] The full City Council approved the deal on April 3, and the agreement is planned to be finalized by June 15. [...] The Provincial Minister of Tourism and Culture Michael Chan said that MLSE has submitted a funding request that that [...] "we are looking at it", while the Federal Infrastructure Minister Denis Lebel's spokesperson said that [...] "the federal government has no program to fund professional sports facilities". [...] A spokesperson for Lebel would later say [...] "our government will not fund the BMO Field {{as long as it is}} used by a professional sports team". [...] However, according to Leiweke, the federal funding [...] "is not going to the stadium, their <b>money</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> to host big events." [...] In another interview he said [...] "the feds are giving us the resources to (temporarily) expand to 40,000 for our Grey Cup bids and Winter Classic bids".|$|E
