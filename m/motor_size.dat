50|$|The New Haven {{considered}} {{two different}} operating frequencies {{for use in}} their electrification: 15 Hz and 25 Hz. The lower frequency of 15 Hz afforded reduced <b>motor</b> <b>size,</b> lower inductive losses, and a higher motor power factor. 25 Hz had by 1907 already become a commercial standard, and the railroad already operated a number of trolley power houses at 25 Hz and had equipped many of its shops with 25 Hz motors. Selection of 15 Hz viewed by the railroad as a 'break in gage' which would have limited the commercial value of the system. Thus the railroad selected the 25 Hz standard, even though {{it might have been}} more desirable from an engineering perspective. Note that many European railroads standardized on a 16.7 Hz traction power frequency.|$|E

To prove this hypothesis, a detailed enthalpy balance model was developed and tested using experimental fuel regression rate data obtained from a variety of motor scales using additively-manufactured acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) fuel grains...|$|R
40|$|The {{cytoskeleton}} protein actin assembles {{into large}} bundles when supporting stresses in the cell, but grows into a fine branched network to induce cell motion. Such self-organization processes are studied in artificial networks of cytoskeleton proteins with thick actin bundles and large motor protein aggregates to enable optical observation. The effect of <b>motor</b> aggregate <b>size</b> on the cytoskeleton mechanical properties is studied here in networks comprised of much smaller motor assemblies. Large motor protein clusters {{are known to}} increase the stiffness of actin based networks by introducing tension and additional cross-linking cites. We find that these effects are universal to actin gels regardless of actin bundle thickness and <b>motor</b> aggregate <b>size</b> and are relevant, therefore, {{to a wide range}} of cytoskeleton based cellular processes. In contrast, motor induced active fluctuations depend significantly on <b>motor</b> assembly <b>size,</b> featuring unique non-Gaussian statistics at high concentrations of small assemblies.

The locomotives operated reliably and successfully for 35 years and were eventually withdrawn owing to a general decline in US railroads in the late 1950s, the advent of cheap diesel power, and in particular to a rebuilding of the class that was poorly carried out and left the rebuilt locomotives with reliability problems.|$|E
40|$|The {{ability to}} predict with some {{accuracy}} a given solid rocket motor’s performance before undertaking one or several costly experimental test firings is important.

In the present investigation, utilizing an updated simulation program, {{the focus is on}} quasi-steady performance analysis and scale effects (influence of <b>motor</b> <b>size).</b> The predicted effects of negative/positive erosive burning and propellant/casing deflection, as tied to <b>motor</b> <b>size,</b> on a reference cylindrical-grain motor’s internal ballistics, are included in this evaluation.
