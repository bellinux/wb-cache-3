Aspirin is available as a generic medication. The wholesale cost in the developing world as of 2014 is 0.002 to 0.025 USD per dose. As of 2015 the cost for a typical month of medication in the United States is less than US$25.|$|E

5|$|Doxorubicin was {{approved}} {{for medical use}} in the United States in 1974. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines, the <b>most</b> <b>effective</b> <b>and</b> safe medicines needed in a health system. The wholesale cost {{in the developing world}} is about 3.88 to 32.79 USD per 50mg vial. In the United Kingdom this amount costs the NHS about £100.12. Versions that are pegylated and in liposomes are also available; however, are more expensive. Doxorubicin was originally made from the bacteria Streptomyces peucetius.|$|E
5|$|Frequently used topical retinoids include adapalene, isotretinoin, retinol, tazarotene, and tretinoin. They often {{cause an}} initial {{flare-up}} of acne and facial flushing, {{and can cause}} significant skin irritation. Generally speaking, retinoids increase the skin's sensitivity to sunlight and are therefore recommended for use at night. Tretinoin is the least expensive of the topical retinoids and is the most irritating to the skin, whereas adapalene is the least irritating to the skin but costs significantly more. Tazarotene is the <b>most</b> <b>effective</b> <b>and</b> expensive topical retinoid, but is not as well-tolerated. Retinol {{is a form of}} vitamin A that has similar but milder effects, and is used in many over-the-counter moisturizers and other topical products.|$|E
5|$|In 1787, 1789, and 1790, Dissenters again {{tried to}} repeal the Test and Corporation Acts. Although {{initially}} {{it looked as if}} they might succeed, by 1790, with the fears of revolution looming in Parliament, few were swayed by appeals to equal rights. Political cartoons, one of the <b>most</b> <b>effective</b> <b>and</b> popular media of the time, skewered the Dissenters and Priestley. In Parliament, William Pitt and Edmund Burke argued against the repeal, a betrayal that angered Priestley and his friends, who had expected the two men's support. Priestley wrote a series of Letters to William Pitt and Letters to Burke in an attempt to persuade them otherwise, but these publications only further inflamed the populace against him.|$|E

5|$|Linezolid was {{discovered}} in the mid 1990s and was approved for commercial use in 2000. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines, the <b>most</b> <b>effective</b> <b>and</b> safe medicines needed in a health system. Linezolid is available as a generic medication. The wholesale cost {{in the developing world}} is about US$ 2.90 USD per day while that in the United States as of 2016 is about US$13.79 per day. It appears to be more cost-effective than alternatives such as vancomycin, mostly because of the ability to switch from intravenous use to administration by mouth sooner.|$|E
5|$|The WHO Model List of Essential Medicines (EML), {{published}} by the World Health Organization (WHO), contains the medications considered to be <b>most</b> <b>effective</b> <b>and</b> safe to meet the most important needs in a health system. The list is frequently used by countries to help develop their own local lists of essential medicine. As of 2016, more than 155 countries have created national lists of essential medicines based on the World Health Organization's model list. This includes countries in both the developed and developing world.|$|E

Warfarin is available as a generic medication. The wholesale cost {{in the developing world}} is about US$1.12 to 7.20 for a typical month of treatment.

5|$|By {{the time}} the first attack took place, {{the walls of the}} fort still had not been finished, {{although}} they had been raised slightly. As a result of the hasty construction work, even at the wall's lowest part, it was high enough that the attacking force would need ladders to reach the top of the rampart. Every point where the fort was approachable, or thought weak by its defenders, was bolstered by stockades made out of stones and stakes that had been stuck into the ground. These were covered by cannons that were placed where they could be <b>most</b> <b>effective,</b> <b>and</b> a wicket gate that flanked {{a large part of the}} wall, was left open but cross-barred, to make it difficult for attacking soldiers to enter but also to channel their advance towards a cannon that had been placed at the gate to enfilade its approach with showers of grapeshot.|$|E
5|$|The first {{polio vaccine}} was the inactivated polio vaccine. It was {{developed}} by Jonas Salk and came into use in 1955. The oral polio vaccine {{was developed by}} Albert Sabin and came into commercial use in 1961. They are on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines, the <b>most</b> <b>effective</b> <b>and</b> safe medicines needed in a health system. Clinical disease, including paralysis, caused by vaccine-derived poliovirus (VDPV) is indistinguishable from that caused by wild polioviruses. This {{is believed to be}} a rare event, but outbreaks of vaccine-associated paralytic poliomyelitis (VAPP), caused by a circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus (cVDPV), have been reported, and tend to occur in areas of low coverage by OPV, presumably because the OPV is itself protective against the related outbreak strain.|$|E
5|$|Shooting {{by trained}} marksmen is {{considered}} to be the most practical method of control due to its effectiveness. The NSW Department of Primary Industries believe shooting is the preferred method of population control as it does not subject the horses to the stresses of mustering, yarding, and long-distance transportation, all of which are related to 'capture and removal' methods. Horses that are only initially wounded from shooting are tracked and dispatched if they are in accessible, open country. However, shooting of horses in mountain ranges is not regarded as a humane means of control. Helicopter shootings allow for aerial reconnaissance of a large area to target the densest populations, and shooters may get close enough to the target animals to ensure termination. This method is considered the <b>most</b> <b>effective</b> <b>and</b> cost efficient means of control, but disapproval is high amongst those that believe it is inhumane. Organizations supporting Brumbies argue that aerial shooting is unnecessary and that alternative population control methods have not been given adequate trials, while government officials express concern about the need to control rapidly growing populations in order to avoid ecological problems associated with too many feral horses in certain areas.|$|E

5|$|Winter service {{vehicles}} are operated by both {{government agencies and}} by private subcontractors. Public works in areas which regularly receive snowfall usually maintain a fleet of their own vehicles or pay retainers to contractors for priority access to vehicles in winter, while cities where snow is a less regular occurrence may simply hire the vehicles as needed. Winter {{service vehicles}} in the United Kingdom are the only road-going vehicles entitled to use red diesel. Though the vehicles still use public highways, {{they are used to}} keep the road network operational, and forcing them to pay extra tax to do so would discourage private contractors from assisting with snow removal on public roads. Winter service vehicle drivers in the United States must hold a Class A or Class B commercial driver's license. Although some agencies in some areas, such as the US state of Minnesota, allow winter service vehicle drivers to operate without any extra training, most provide supplemental lessons to drivers to teach them the <b>most</b> <b>effective</b> <b>and</b> safe methods of snow removal. Many require that trainee drivers ride-along with more experienced drivers, and some even operate specially designed driving simulators, which can safely replicate dangerous winter driving conditions. Other organisations require that all staff have a recognised additional licence or certificate—the United Kingdom Highways Agency for example requires that all staff have both a City & Guilds qualification and a supplemental Winter Maintenance Licence.|$|E
