She was given the name Faith after her elder sister, who died from leukaemia {{at the age of}} two. A {{delicate}} child, Leech had an aversion to eating {{in the first two years}} of her life, so her mother fed her in small hourly doses. Leech was twice rushed from the family home to a Melbourne hospital. Conventional medicine failed to rectify Leech's dietary issues, so her <b>mother</b> <b>put</b> her on a fast for ten days at the recommendation of a naturopath. Leech was later placed on a diet of fruit, salad and vegetables, with an emphasis on beetroot juice and carrot juice.|$|E

500|$|In 2007, Beckinsale starred {{opposite}} Sam Rockwell in {{the independent}} drama Snow Angels, {{based on the novel}} by Stewart O'Nan. The harrowing film, in which she played an overwhelmed single <b>mother,</b> <b>put</b> Beckinsale [...] "in kind of a tough place." [...] "I did have my kid, my husband and, in fact, my ex was around a lot, so it was very nice to come home to my people whom I love." [...] Puig felt [...] "Beckinsale gives her best performance in years" [...] while Richard Corliss of Time described it as [...] "her sharpest work yet." [...] However, Scott felt that [...] "her skill and discipline cannot overcome the sense that she is an exotic species transplanted into this grim ecosystem. Hard as she works to convince us otherwise, it’s a stretch to believe that a woman with the kind of poised confidence in her own beauty she manifests would wind up with an underachieving mouth breather like Glenn." [...] The film grossed just $414,404 worldwide.|$|E

However Minna, together with Jessie's <b>mother,</b> <b>put</b> a stop to this plan and Wagner eventually returned to Minna and for a while their relationship regained some of its original ardour. It was the affair with Mathilde Wesendonck while Wagner was working on Tristan und Isolde in 1857 that provoked the final breach between Minna and Wagner. After her discovery of a letter from Wagner to Mathilde in April 1858, Minna accused them of adultery, which Wagner denied, claiming that Minna had put a [...] "vulgar interpretation" [...] on his letter. Minna took the view that Wagner had been seduced by Mathilde, and in subsequent letters referred to her as [...] "that hussy" [...] and [...] "that filthy woman".|$|E

2500|$|Following the Nazi {{invasion}} of Belgium, Lilian's <b>mother</b> <b>put</b> {{herself at the}} service of the Red Cross during the Belgian and Allied military campaign against the invaders. Lilian helped her mother actively in her new role, transporting Belgian and French wounded by car to the hospital of St. John in Bruges. Meanwhile, her father, Governor Baels, attempted to alleviate the plight of his invaded province. On 18 May, Henri Baels went in search of the Minister of the Interior, thinking he had left for France, to obtain his signature for an important relief measure. On his journey, however, Governor Baels had a car accident and injured his legs. He was admitted to a hospital in Le Havre. As the military situation in Belgium headed towards disaster, his wife decided to bring her daughters to safety in France, and Lilian drove the family car on the trip. Governor Baels' wife and daughters managed to meet up with him again, by pure chance, in a hospital in Poitiers. Baels was subsequently accused of having abandoned his post as Governor without justification by fleeing to France. He succeeded, however, in obtaining an audience with the King following the capitulation of the Belgian army on 28 May 1940 and the King's own imprisonment by the Germans at Laeken Castle. [...] Baels and his daughter Lilian, who drove him to the audience, explained the real circumstances of his departure from Belgium, and the Governor was thereby vindicated. Subsequently, Lilian and her father returned to France and occupied themselves with the care of Belgian refugees in the region of Anglet. After Belgium's liberation, Henri Baels was accused of collaborating with the Nazis during the war, but this is clearly false, since he did not act as governor during the occupation and lived in France throughout the period.
