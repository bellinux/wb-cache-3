This kind of system is becoming very popular in some <b>market</b> <b>branches</b> (e. g. the bovine meat market) and we present here also an experimental analysis of the bovine meat process steps, localising possible sources of electromagnetic noise in the standardised frequency range of RFID. In particular, the system under analysis is composed of a portable reader (Innoceramics P 3000) and passive glass tags (boli) working in Half-Duplex (HDX) at frequencies of 123. 2 kHz and 134. 2 kHz (field strength ~ 106 dbµV/m, reading distance about 25 cm) ...|$|E
40|$|The thesis {{deals with}} hemp (Cannabis sativa) and its {{utilization}} {{in many different}} branches of industry, food processing industry and other spheres of human existence. It results from many reasons: lead the human activities to respect his environment, {{to change the way}} of human activities, life style and thinking in relation with environment. I try to show the way, how to keep living standard without negative impacts. It means not to limit surroundings and not to harm environment. This is the way, how to live economically and ecologically. Production works on assumption of interests of consumers. For that reason I investigate possibilities and perspectives of use of products from technical hemp in Czech market. Also I investigate the technological, economical, political and societal view. Marketing study of interest in products of technical hemp shows, that there is serious interest of respondents in these products. In the future it is necessary to deal with initiate problems mainly from the view of consumers, study the <b>market</b> <b>branches</b> and each individual hemp commodities. In the first instance it is necessary to press technical hemp as the useful and multilaterally effective plant. We cant do that only because of trading profits, which are not so attractive. We have to do that, because we know we support the good thing. Really, it is not important, if we will do it, but when we will start with it. I would like to point out, that there is not only welfare of individuals, but also welfare of the whole society. Still the fundamental is to respect all living creatures as well as to all things...|$|E
40|$|O artigo discute como o processo de reconhecimento de direitos de melhoristas, na forma de proteção de cultivares, no Brasil se fez a partir de uma estratégia {{nacional de}} {{articular}} propriedade intelectual e desenvolvimento tecnológico nacional. A proteção intelectual é entendida como mecanismo de articulação e coordenação entre os agentes envolvidos no processo de inovação. A metodologia de coleta de dados consistiu na análise dos titulares de cultivares protegidas no Brasil disponibilizados pelo Serviço Nacional de Proteção de Cultivares, cruzando esses dados com os constantes do relatório de acompanhamento da produção de sementes no Brasil, elaborado pela Embrapa em parceria com o Ministério da Agricultura e a Abrasem. Entre as principais conclusões está a de que o processo de reorganização da pesquisa pública, por meio de parcerias estruturadas em torno do desenvolvimento de novos cultivares contribuiu fortemente para a manutenção da presença pública no mercado de sementes, todavia, varia entre as espécies pesquisadas. This article discusses the recent Brazilian {{strategy in the}} field of intellectual property rights applied to new varieties and seeds. Intellectual property is here understood as an economic tool to articulate and to coordinate the economic and technical agents involved in the process of development and diffusing of new varieties and seeds. The article deals with data from the National Service on Variety Protection and also with data from the Brazilian seed market. Among the main findings it shows that the recent strategy of EMBRAPA (the national public research institution) along with the recent emergence of foundations of seed production and commercialization (formed by small seed producers in different regions of the country), has caused important changes in the seed market structure. Of course, this movement has not been equal among all species and all <b>market</b> <b>branches,</b> but it is actually impressive among some of them (like corn and soybean seed markets). In this process, public research institutions can play an important role, especially if they are capable to build strong capabilities in dealing not only with genetics and seed production, but also with the national and the international regulatory frameworks...|$|E
