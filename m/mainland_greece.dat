5|$|Mycenaean civilization {{originated}} and {{evolved from}} the society {{and culture of the}} Early and Middle Helladic period in <b>mainland</b> <b>Greece</b> under influences from Minoan Crete. Towards the end of the Middle Bronze Age (c. 1600 BC) {{a significant increase in the}} population and the number of settlements occurred. A number of centers of power emerged in southern <b>mainland</b> <b>Greece</b> dominated by a warrior elite society, while the typical dwellings of that era were an early type of megaron buildings. Some more complex structures are classified as forerunners of the later palaces. In a number of sites, defensive walls were also erected.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of this turmoil, {{specific}} regions in <b>mainland</b> <b>Greece</b> witnessed a dramatic population decrease, especially Boeotia, Argolis and Messenia. Mycenaean refugees migrated to Cyprus and the Levantine coast. Nevertheless, other regions {{on the edge of the}} Mycenaean world prospered, such as the Ionian islands, the northwestern Peloponnese, parts of Attica and a number of Aegean islands. The acropolis of Athens, oddly, appears to have avoided destruction.|$|E
5|$|For the Persians, {{the only}} {{unfinished}} business that remained {{by the end}} of 493 BC was to exact punishment on Athens and Eretria for supporting the revolt. The Ionian Revolt had severely threatened the stability of Darius's empire, and the states of <b>mainland</b> <b>Greece</b> would continue to threaten that stability unless dealt with. Darius thus began to contemplate the complete conquest of Greece, beginning with the destruction of Athens and Eretria.|$|E

There are four species of Potamon in the Balkans, and P.fluviatile is {{replaced}} by Potamon ibericum in northeastern Greece.

5|$|The Hittite {{archives}} of circa 1400 BCE, {{during the reign}} of Arnuwanda I, describe the military campaign of Attarsiya in southwest Anatolia, probably in the region of Lycia. The Achaean expedition in Anatolia is associated with increased Mycenaean findings in Milet during this period (early 14th century BCE), indicating that a number of Greek people moved from <b>mainland</b> <b>Greece</b> to this region.|$|E
5|$|The {{construction}} of defensive structures was {{closely linked to}} the establishment of the palaces in <b>mainland</b> <b>Greece.</b> The principal Mycenaean centers were well-fortified and usually situated on an elevated terrain, like on the acropolis of Athens, Tiryns and Mycenae or on coastal plains, in the case of Gla. Mycenaean Greeks in general appreciated the symbolism of war as expressed in defensive architecture, reflected by the visual impressiveness of their fortifications.|$|E

50|$|The Mycenaean civilization, <b>mainland</b> <b>Greece's</b> (and Europe's) {{first major}} civilization, {{dominated}} the Peloponnese in the Bronze Age from its stronghold at Mycenae in the north-east of the peninsula. The Mycenean civilization collapsed suddenly {{at the end}} of the 2nd millennium BC. Archeological research has found that many of its cities and palaces show signs of destruction. The subsequent period, known as the Greek Dark Ages, is marked by an absence of written records.|$|R

5|$|The Ionian Revolt {{had begun}} with an {{unsuccessful}} expedition against Naxos, {{a joint venture}} between the Persian satrap Artaphernes and the Milesian tyrant Aristagoras. In the aftermath, Artaphernes decided to remove Aristagoras from power, but before he could do so, Aristagoras abdicated, and declared Miletus a democracy. The other Ionian cities followed suit, ejecting their Persian-appointed tyrants, and declaring themselves democracies. Aristagoras then appealed to the states of <b>mainland</b> <b>Greece</b> for support, but only Athens and Eretria offered to send troops.|$|E
5|$|Aristagoras {{had brought}} all of Hellenic Asia Minor into revolt, but evidently {{realised}} that the Greeks would need other allies {{in order to}} fight the Persians. In the winter of 499 BC, he sailed to <b>mainland</b> <b>Greece</b> to try to recruit allies. He failed to persuade the Spartans, but the cities of Athens and Eretria agreed to support the rebellion. In the spring of 498BC, an Athenian force of twenty triremes, accompanied by five from Eretria, {{for a total of}} twenty-five triremes set sail for Ionia. They joined up with the main Ionian force near Ephesus.|$|E
5|$|From a {{strategic}} point of view, battle {{was not necessary}} for either side; the main strategic theatre was <b>mainland</b> <b>Greece</b> itself. Although destroying the enemy navy {{would result in a}} clear strategic advantage for both sides, attempting this risked the loss of their own navy. The actions of the two sides thus reflect more upon their morale and confidence than on any strategic considerations. The Persians, seeing little to gain in battle, demoralised and riven with dissent, thus sought to avoid a naval battle. Conversely, the Allies, who had initially been as nervous of a battle as the Persians, sought to press home their morale advantage once they were informed {{of the state of the}} Persian fleet.|$|E

5|$|From {{the early}} 14th century BC, Mycenaean trade {{began to take}} {{advantage}} of the new trading opportunities in the Mediterranean after the Minoan collapse. The trade routes were expanded further reaching Cyprus, Amman in the Near East, Apulia in Italy and Spain. At that time (c. 1400 BC), the palace of Knossos yielded the earliest records of the Greek Linear B script, based on the previous Linear A of the Minoans. The use of the new script spread in <b>mainland</b> <b>Greece</b> and offers valuable insight of the administrative network of the palatial centers. However, the unearthed records are too fragmentary for a political reconstruction of Bronze Age Greece.|$|E
5|$|In circa 1250 BC, {{the first}} wave of {{destruction}} has been witnessed in various centers of <b>mainland</b> <b>Greece</b> for reasons that cannot be identified by archaeologists. These incidents appear to have triggered the massive strengthening and expansion of the fortifications in various sites. In some cases, arrangements were also made for the creation of subterranean passages which led to underground cisterns. Nevertheless, none of these measures appear to have prevented the final destruction of the Mycenaean palace centers in the 12th century BC. The reasons that lead to the collapse of the Mycenaean culture have been hotly debated among scholars. The two most common theories are population movement and internal conflict.|$|E
5|$|Mycenaean Greece (or Mycenaean civilization) was {{the last}} phase of the Bronze Age in Ancient Greece (c. 1600–1100 BC). It {{represents}} the first advanced civilization in <b>mainland</b> <b>Greece,</b> with its palatial states, urban organization, works of art and writing system. Among the centers of power that emerged, the most notable were those of Pylos, Tiryns, Midea in the Peloponnese, Orchomenos, Thebes, Athens in Central Greece and Iolcos in Thessaly. The most prominent site was Mycenae, in Argolid, to which the culture of this era owes its name. Mycenaean and Mycenaean-influenced settlements also appeared in Epirus, Macedonia, on islands in the Aegean Sea, {{on the coast of}} Asia Minor, the Levant, Cyprus and Italy.|$|E

5|$|The {{discovery}} of the Mycenaean civilization by the German amateur archaeologist Heinrich Schliemann in the nineteenth century, and the {{discovery of}} the Minoan civilization in Crete by the British archaeologist Sir Arthur Evans in the twentieth century, helped to explain many existing questions about Homer's epics and provided archaeological evidence for many of the mythological details about gods and heroes. Unfortunately, the evidence about myths and rituals at Mycenaean and Minoan sites is entirely monumental, as the Linear B script (an ancient form of Greek found in both Crete and <b>mainland</b> <b>Greece)</b> was used mainly to record inventories, although certain names of gods and heroes have been tentatively identified.|$|E
5|$|The {{eruption}} of Thera, {{which according to}} archaeological data occurred in c. 1500 BC, resulted in {{the decline of the}} Minoan civilization of Crete. This turn of events gave the opportunity to the Mycenaeans to spread their influence throughout the Aegean. Around c. 1450 BC, they were in control of Crete itself, including Knossos, and colonized several other Aegean islands, reaching as far as Rhodes. Thus the Mycenaeans became the dominant power of the region, marking the beginning of the Mycenaean 'Koine' era (from , common), a highly uniform culture that spread in <b>mainland</b> <b>Greece</b> and the Aegean.|$|E
5|$|After 1347, John VI Kantakouzenos {{tried to}} revive the Empire, but met with limited success. Aided by the {{depopulation}} brought by about by the Black Death, Dušan and his general Preljub took Kantakouzenos' Macedonian strongholds as well as Epirus and Thessaly in 1347–1348, thereby completing their conquest of the remaining Byzantine lands in <b>mainland</b> <b>Greece.</b> An attempt to break Byzantium's dependence for food and maritime commerce on the Genoese merchants of Galata led to a Byzantine–Genoese war, which ended in 1352 with a compromise peace. In 1350, Kantakouzenos took advantage of Dušan's preoccupation with a war against Bosnia to recover Thessalonica from the Zealots as well as Berroia, Vodena and other Macedonian cities from the Serbs, but the Serbian emperor quickly reversed the Byzantine gains, leaving only Thessalonica in Byzantine hands.|$|E
25|$|After {{the end of}} the Duchy of Athens and the principality of Achaia, {{the only}} Latin {{possessions}} left on the <b>mainland</b> of <b>Greece</b> were the papal city of Monemvasia, the fortress of Vonitsa, the Messenian stations Coron and Modon, Lepanto, Pteleon, Navarino, and the castles of Argos and Nauplia, to which the island of Aegina was subordinate.|$|R
50|$|The {{most famous}} {{example is the}} Acropolis of Athens, which, by reason of its {{historical}} associations and the several famous buildings erected upon it (most notably the Parthenon), is known without qualification as the Acropolis.

5|$|After Byzantium, the Spartans were {{allegedly}} {{eager to}} end their involvement in the war. The Spartans were supposedly of the view that, with the liberation of <b>mainland</b> <b>Greece</b> and the Greek cities of Asia Minor, the war's purpose had already been reached. There was also perhaps a feeling that securing long-term security for the Asian Greeks would prove impossible. In the aftermath of Mycale, the Spartan king Leotychides had proposed transplanting all the Greeks from Asia Minor to Europe as the only method of permanently freeing them from Persian dominion. Xanthippus, the Athenian commander at Mycale, had furiously rejected this; the Ionian cities were originally Athenian colonies, and the Athenians, if no-one else, would protect the Ionians. This marks {{the point at which}} the leadership of the Greek Alliance effectively passed to the Athenians. With the Spartan withdrawal after Byzantium, the leadership of the Athenians became explicit.|$|E
5|$|Archaeologists {{developed}} the Late Bronze Age chronologies of eastern Mediterranean cultures by analysing {{the origin of}} artifacts (for example, items from Crete, <b>mainland</b> <b>Greece,</b> Cyprus or Canaan) found in each archaeological layer. If an artifact's origin can be accurately dated, it gives a reference date for the layer {{in which it is}} found. If the Thera eruption could be associated with a given layer of Cretan (or other) culture, chronologists could use the date of that layer to date the eruption itself. Since Thera's culture at the time of destruction was similar to the Late Minoan IA (LMIA) culture on Crete, LMIA is the baseline to establish chronology elsewhere. The eruption also aligns with Late Cycladic I (LCI) and Late Helladic I (LHI) cultures, but predates Peloponnesian LHI. Archeological digs on Akrotiri have also yielded fragments of nine Syro-Palestinian Middle Bronze II (MBII) gypsum vessels.|$|E
5|$|In 393 BC, Conon and Pharnabazus {{sailed to}} <b>mainland</b> <b>Greece,</b> where they raided {{the coast of}} Laconia and seized the island of Cythera, where they left a {{garrison}} and an Athenian governor.

With the assistance of the rowers of the fleet, and the workers paid for by the Persian money, the construction was soon completed. Athens quickly took advantage of its possession of walls and a fleet to seize the islands of Scyros, Imbros, and Lemnos, on which it established cleruchies (citizen colonies).|$|E
