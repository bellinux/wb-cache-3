The President of Spindrift, John Barnett, brought a new factory built boat No. 4037 to race in the 1981 Mariner Nationals. He won handily, but the boat was reputed to be about 40% lighter than boats built by O'Day. After much soul searching, the Class officers retroactively revoked the <b>measurement</b> <b>certificate</b> and rescored the Nationals results.|$|E

The official boat specifications were established in 1956. Members of the class association had to pay dues, which covered various administrative and legal costs (such as registering the Jet-14 trademark in 1957), and official <b>measurement</b> <b>certificates</b> were drawn up and distributed. A constitution and by-laws were established for the Class as well. The first Class newsletter, [...] "Jet Blasts," [...] was published and a regatta schedule was created.|$|R

The emission measurement can be taken on a registered repair shop prior to the inspection. If done so, a proper <b>measurement</b> <b>certificate</b> must be shown at inspection. Upon passed inspection, a new [...] "Part one" [...] of registration certificate is printed and handed to customer among with inspection report.

In this study we would theoretically try to clarify, indicate what the uncertainty in the measurement, standard types of uncertainty and how to calculate the budget of uncertainty as we should show some examples of how the scientific calculation of the budget challenge with some measure the lengths of the laboratory. After analyzing the results we had found during the measurement using CMM, we had found that the value of non-statistical uncertainty in the measurement type (b) piece length of one meter was ± 1. 9257 µm. and when using the configuration measuring device, we had gotten the value of the extended standard combined uncertainty ± 2. 030 µm when measured the screws value of 1. 2707 mm.

40|$|This paper {{talks about}} THE IMPLEMENTATION OF DUTIES AND FUNCTIONS OF SLEMAN DISTRICT LAND OFFICE IN LAND REGISTRATION (OWNERSHIP) DATA MAINTAINANCE BASED ON GOVERNMENT REGULATION NUMBER 24 OF 1997 LAND ADMINISTRATION FOR ADMINISTRATION REGISTRY. The {{regulation}} sets {{that the land}} office as the executive agency for Land Registration in districts/cities. The objective is to control any Land Registration along with its data maintenance activities to match to the physical and juridical data of the map, land, and name list, <b>measurement</b> <b>certificate,</b> land book, and related certificates with the changes that occur afterward. The changes are {{in the form of}} the subject of transitional law, in a sense of the Properties on land transfer (buying and selling). Duties and functions of the land office is set up in the legislation, but in practice, the rules have been applied inappropiately and work silos from the orderly administration. Hence, the questions are: 1. How is the implementation of the duties and functions of Sleman District Land Office in the Land Registration data maintenance and the transfer of Properties on sale over land in 2013 with the enactment of Government Regulation No. 24 of 1997 on Land Registration Rules in conjunction with the State Minister of Agrarian/Head of National State Land No. 3, 1997 ? 2. Does the implementation enact the Land Administration Registry orderly? The research applied is empirical legal research, which is a legal research starts on the view that based on the facts at the sites. The result of the study is that the Sleman District Land Office institutionalized the administration of land orderly. The advice goes to the applicants of ownership registration of land transfer to meet all the requirements documents before coming and asking to the Sleman District Land Titles Registrare (PPAT) to make the deed, so that the better coordination is maintained under the framework between PPAT to achieve the orderly Land Administration Registry...|$|E

Under the TC activities, the guidelines {{and procedures for}} accepting CMCs (Calibration and Measurement Capabilities) and QS (Quality System) have been drawn up by taking closer cooperation with the JCRB (Joint Committee of the RMOs and the BIPM).

40|$|AbstractA {{number of}} {{applications}} based on personal health records (PHRs) are emerging {{in the field of}} health care and wellness. PHRs empower patients by giving them control over their health data. Health data for PHRs can be supplied by patients, wellness providers and health care providers. Health care providers may use the PHRs to provide medical care. Unfortunately, the quality of the health data cannot be guaranteed in all cases (e. g. consider cases where non-professionals such as patients and wellness providers supplied the data). To address this problem, we present in this paper Hedaquin, a system that provides health care professionals with an indication of the quality of health data in a PHR. This indication is based on the reputation of the supplier and on metadata provided by measurement devices. The proposed reputation system mimics the way trust in health data and their suppliers is built in the real world. Hedaquin uses the Beta reputation system as a starting point and extends it in several directions to cover specific PHR requirements. Firstly, Hedaquin supports the automatic calculation of a rating based on a repeated <b>measurement.</b> Secondly, <b>certificates</b> for the user such as diplomas are taken into account. Thirdly, Hedaquin calculates reputation for different scopes in order to discriminate among different tasks the suppliers of health data can perform. Finally, the time difference between the ratings and the calculation of the reputation influences the weight that is given to a rating...|$|R

40|$|We {{propose a}} {{flexible}} convex relaxation for the phase retrieval problem that operates {{in the natural}} domain of the signal. Therefore, we avoid the prohibitive computational cost associated with "lifting" and semidefinite programming (SDP) in methods such as PhaseLift and compete with recently developed non-convex techniques for phase retrieval. We relax the quadratic equations for phaseless measurements to inequality constraints each of which representing a symmetric "slab". Through a simple convex program, our proposed estimator finds an extreme point of the intersection of these slabs that is best aligned with a given anchor vector. We characterize geometric conditions that certify success of the proposed estimator. Furthermore, using classic results in statistical learning theory, we show that for random <b>measurements</b> the geometric <b>certificates</b> hold with high probability at an optimal sample complexity. Phase transition of our estimator is evaluated through simulations. Our numerical experiments also suggest that the proposed method can solve phase retrieval problems with coded diffraction measurements as well. Comment: Accepted in AISTATS 2017.

Obj e c t i v e: We examined whether maternal low-level lead exposure is associated with decreased fetal growth. Met h o d s: We linked New York State Heavy Metals Registry records of women who had PbB <b>measurements</b> with birth <b>certificates</b> to identify 43, 288 mother–infant pairs in upstate New York in a retrospective cohort study from 2003 through 2005. We used multiple linear regression with fractional polynomials and logistic regression to relate birth weight, preterm delivery, and small for gestational age to PbB levels, adjusting for potential confounders. We used a closed-test procedure to identify the best fractional polynomials for PbB among 44 combinations. Re s u l t s: We found a statistically significant association between PbB (square root transformed) and birth weight. Relative to 0 µg/dL, PbBs of 5 and 10 µg/dL were associated with an average of 61 -g and 87 -g decrease in birth weight, respectively. The adjusted odds ratio for PbBs between 3. 1 and 9. 9 µg/dL (highest quartile) was 1. 04 [95 % confidence interval (CI), 0. 89 – 1. 22] for preterm delivery and 1. 07 (95 % CI, 0. 93 – 1. 23) for small for gestational age, relative to PbBs ≤ 1 µg/dL (lowes...|$|R
