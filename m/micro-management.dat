500|$|The Battle of the Falaise Pocket {{ended the}} Battle of Normandy with a decisive German defeat. Hitler's {{involvement}} had been damaging from the first, with his insistence on hopelessly unrealistic counter-offensives, <b>micro-management</b> of generals, and refusal to countenance withdrawal when his armies were threatened with annihilation. More than forty German divisions were destroyed during the Battle of Normandy.

[...] While Weber outlived his rival, his family was smaller and far less prolific than the Steinway family, and due to his tendency toward <b>micro-management,</b> Weber's death was a large loss to the company.

2500|$|The most {{important}} projects are developing new programming languages which work more efficiently for claytronics. The {{goal of a}} claytronics matrix is to dynamically form three-dimensional shapes. However, the vast number of catoms in this distributed network increases complexity of <b>micro-management</b> of each individual catom. So, each catom must perceive accurate position information and command of cooperation with its neighbors. In this environment, software language for the matrix operation must convey concise statements of high-level commands {{in order to be}} universally distributed. [...] Languages to program a matrix require a more abbreviated syntax and style of command than normal programming languages such as C++ and Java.|$|E
2500|$|Although Weber's boldness had benefited him, {{and allowed}} him to win many battles, Steinway & Sons {{ultimately}} won the war. [...] Unlike Steinway, Weber focused his efforts on refining quality, materials and worksmanship rather than technological innovation. [...] The key {{difference between the two}} founders (Albert Weber and Heinrich Steinweg) was that Weber had trained and studied as a pianist, and not as a businessman or piano builder. [...] Steinweg, on the other hand, worked and trained primarily as a builder of a variety of instruments and not as a musician. [...] As a builder first and foremost, Steinweg, and later his family members, discovered many technological innovations in piano construction and design that helped them versus against other piano builders. [...] Further, Steinweg was better able to delegate control of his burgeoning empire to his family members, while Weber struggled with <b>micro-management</b> and had difficulty stepping back from the minutiae of day-to-day operations.|$|E
2500|$|At {{the same}} time, public {{trust in the}} Canadian Forces {{suffered}} and recruitment became more difficult. Public revulsion provided support for the sharp cuts to military spending introduced by the Liberal government. [...] Many of the report's comments, along with the sustained media criticism of the military, led to the hasty imposition of policies designed to ensure nothing similar to the Somalia Affair could happen again. [...] It {{has been argued that}} many of these practices, such as the <b>micro-management</b> of training, operations and disciplinary processes from NDHQ and the resultant restrictions on commanding officers, hamper the flexibility of operational units. Since the events in Somalia, Canada has become far less ready to participate in United Nations Peacekeeping efforts. Once playing {{an important role in the}} majority of UN efforts, in subsequent years Canada simply provided indirect support. Post 2001 though, spending on the Canadian Forces gradually increased and accelerated as Canada played a major role in Afghanistan. Concurrently public perception of the Canadian Forces improved dramatically as well.|$|E

By March 2007, Council members Auld, Garraway, Jenkins and Kelly Kautz had all submitted evaluations of dissatisfaction with Timler. They cited a lack of communication with Council members and deviations from their directives as reasons. Mayor Oberholtzer and Council member Barbara Bender had evaluated him with high marks. Council member Bender stated that Timler had kept her well informed through email that she noticed had been CC'd to the entire council. Council member Jenkins was quoted expressing his disapproval of the entire council-manager system by suggesting that a city the size of Snellville (+/- 19,000) would benefit more with a hands-on council.|$|E

50|$|White Day: A Labyrinth Named School is a {{survival}} horror video game played from the first-person perspective. Players explore the school collecting items to solve puzzles and advance the story, {{much in the}} vein of a classic adventure game. <b>Micro-management</b> of items is key, as the player has limited item slots and some objects may be important for progression despite not being used for hours from the collection point. As the game offers non-linear progression, various documents can be found throughout the school offering additional backstory and hints on how to advance. Likewise, the player can receive text messages through their cell phone which offers clues on plot progression. Holding certain objects in specific sections of the game can trigger unique events and encounters, such as fights with ghosts that otherwise {{would not have been}} prompted. Puzzle solutions, such as combinations for locked safes, are randomized on each playthrough. This encompasses {{a large portion of the}} gameplay; searching for items and solving puzzles.|$|E
50|$|Back at Pearl Harbor, Torrey is {{relieved}} of his command and faces a Board of Inquiry {{that could lead}} to a Court Martial, but when Admiral Chester Nimitz arrives to take command in the Pacific theater, he makes sure that Torrey will have a position on his planning staff. Torrey's officers scatter to various points in the Pacific theater, with his old exec, Paul Eddington, assigned to an unrewarding post at an old Free French base on the island of Toulebonne. Torrey drifts into a romance with a Navy nurse named Maggie Haynes; this romance is interrupted only briefly by the alert ordered during the Battle of Midway. Eventually, Torrey and his roommate, Captain Egan Powell, USNR, are invited to dinner at Nimitz's house, where Nimitz personally presents Torrey with the pair of Rear Admiral (lower half) stars that Nimitz had worn before taking command as CinCPAC and announces that he is to go into the Pacific theater to take personal command of an operation, called Mesquite, that has ground to a halt because of the inept <b>micro-management</b> by the area commander.|$|E

This revealed Washington's <b>micro-management</b> of Carver's department, which he had headed for more than 10 years by then. Washington at the same time refused Carver's requests for a new laboratory, research supplies for his exclusive use, and respite from teaching classes. Washington praised Carver's abilities in teaching and original research but said about his administrative skills: [...] "When it comes to the organization of classes, the ability required to secure a properly organized and large school or section of a school, you are wanting in ability. When it comes to the matter of practical farm managing which will secure definite, practical, financial results, you are wanting again in ability."In 1911, Carver complained that his laboratory had not received the equipment which Washington had promised 11 months before. He also complained about Institute committee meetings. Washington praised Carver in his 1911 memoir, My Larger Education: Being Chapters from My Experience. Washington called Carver [...] "one of the most thoroughly scientific men of the Negro race with whom I am acquainted." [...] After Washington died in 1915, his successor made fewer demands on Carver for administrative tasks.|$|E
