5|$|Later, Liz apologizes to Jenna for {{allowing}} her to be injured, and agrees to let Jenna tell the TGS writing staff about her role in an advertisement for a phone sex line. The writers find the ad online, and greatly enjoy watching it. Jack comes in while the writers are watching and laughs so hard that he vomits. The laughter lifts Jack out of his bad <b>mood,</b> <b>and</b> he tells Liz what an important friend she is.|$|E
5|$|Lennon {{considered}} the song his greatest accomplishment. The track incorporates reverse-recorded instrumentation and tape loops, and was created from the editing together of two separate {{versions of the}} song – each one entirely different in tempo, <b>mood</b> <b>and</b> musical key. The song was later included on the US Magical Mystery Tour LP (although not on the British double EP package of the same name).|$|E
40|$|In hindi tenses <b>and</b> <b>moods</b> can {{be divided}} into two groups: root tenses <b>and</b> <b>moods</b> <b>and</b> auxiliated tenses <b>and</b> <b>moods.</b> Among root tenses <b>and</b> <b>moods</b> belong: futurum, {{imperative}} and subjunctive. Auxiliated tenses <b>and</b> <b>moods</b> {{can be divided}} into: imperfective, perfective and progressive. This work describes each of <b>moods</b> <b>and</b> tenses in mentioned groups. Each is written according to structure and function. The decription is accompanied by examples from descriptive grammars of Hindi and literature...|$|R
40|$|<b>Moods</b> <b>and</b> {{emotions}} are sometimes {{thought to be}} counterexamples to intentionalism, the view that a mental state’s phenomenal features are exhausted by its representational features. The problem is that <b>moods</b> <b>and</b> {{emotions are}} accompanied by phenomenal experiences that {{do not seem to}} be adequately accounted for by any of their plausibly represented contents. This paper develops and defends an intentionalist view of the phenomenal character of <b>moods</b> <b>and</b> emotions on which (1) directed <b>moods</b> <b>and</b> emotions represent intentional objects as having sui generis affective properties, which happen to be uninstantiated, and (2) at least some moods represent affective properties not bound to any objects. ...|$|R

5|$|Palencia-Roth {{notes that}} critics {{have been struck}} by the humorless elegiac style of The General in His Labyrinth; its dark <b>mood</b> <b>and</b> somber message {{is similar to that}} of The Autumn of the Patriarch. Love is a theme common to both Love in the Time of Cholera and The General in His Labyrinth, but the latter is {{considered}} a tragedy. These two novels have been used to demonstrate the range of García Márquez's work.|$|E
5|$|Stimulation-oriented {{treatments}} include art, {{music and}} pet therapies, exercise, {{and any other}} kind of recreational activities. Stimulation has modest support for improving behaviour, <b>mood,</b> <b>and,</b> to a lesser extent, function. Nevertheless, as important as these effects are, the main support for the use of stimulation therapies is the change in the person's routine.|$|E
5|$|The Nahuatl verb {{is quite}} complex and inflects for many {{grammatical}} categories. The verb {{is composed of}} a root, prefixes, and suffixes. The prefixes indicate {{the person of the}} subject, and person and number of the object and indirect object, whereas the suffixes indicate tense, aspect, <b>mood</b> <b>and</b> subject number.|$|E
30|$|Participants {{wanted to}} conceal their <b>moods</b> <b>and</b> feelings, personalities, and {{physical}} attributes. However, personality {{was the most}} frequently mentioned self-defining quality <b>and</b> <b>moods</b> <b>and</b> feelings {{were one of the}} top desired functions for tracking the self, knowing about others, and sharing with others. People liked to know about others’ <b>moods</b> <b>and</b> feelings but wanted to conceal their own. Information about individuals’ personalities <b>and</b> <b>moods</b> <b>and</b> feelings could be used for tracking the self but not always shared with others. Thus, designers could consider how to better protect users’ privacy while still providing the benefits of tracking. For example, data shared with others could use fewer specific words such as “stressed” when tracking <b>moods</b> <b>and</b> feelings (Raij et al. 2011). Designers of wearable technology might further consider the use of filters or permission dashboards to give users greater control over how their data is revealed to others and who gets to see it.|$|R

60|$|The {{world to}} which it has {{returned}} is not the same, and that makes all the difference. Yet, truth and beauty do not change, however the <b>moods</b> <b>and</b> fashions change. The ideals remain, and these alone {{you can go back}} to, secure of finding them the same, to-day and to-morrow, that they were yesterday. This perhaps is because they have never been in storage, but in constant use, while the <b>moods</b> <b>and</b> fashions have been put away and taken out a thousand times. Most people have never had ideals, but only <b>moods</b> <b>and</b> fashions, but such people, least of all, are fitted to find in them that pleasure of the rococo which consoles the idealist when the old <b>moods</b> <b>and</b> fashions reappear.|$|R
5|$|This onomatopoeic singing {{undercuts}} {{the dangerous}} {{scene with a}} sense of humour. Tolkien achieves balance of humour and danger through other means as well, as seen in the foolishness and Cockney dialect of the trolls and in the drunkenness of the elven captors. The general form—that of a journey into strange lands, told in a light-hearted <b>mood</b> <b>and</b> interspersed with songs—may be following the model of The Icelandic Journals by William Morris, an important literary influence on Tolkien.|$|E

In 2015, the series won an Emmy Award for Outstanding Animated Program.

5|$|Among Harrison's post-Beatles solo releases, Extra Texture is {{the only}} album on which his lyrics are devoid of any obvious spiritual message. Uniquely also, it was {{recorded}} mostly in America rather than England, while Harrison was working in Los Angeles {{in his role as}} head of Dark Horse Records. Gary Wright, David Foster, Jim Keltner, Jesse Ed Davis, Leon Russell, Tom Scott, Billy Preston and Jim Horn were among the many contributing musicians. The keyboard-heavy arrangements incorporate elements of soul music and the influence of Smokey Robinson, signalling a further departure from the rock and folk-rock sound of Harrison's popular early-1970s work. Contrasting with the musical content, the album's art design conveys an upbeat <b>mood</b> <b>and</b> includes an unusual die-cut cover with a textured surface.|$|E

5|$|As {{is typical}} of an Indo-European language, English follows accusative morphosyntactic alignment. Unlike other Indo-European {{languages}} though, English has largely abandoned the inflectional case system in favor of analytic constructions. Only the personal pronouns retain morphological case more strongly than any other word class. English distinguishes at least seven major word classes: verbs, nouns, adjectives, adverbs, determiners (including articles), prepositions, and conjunctions. Some analyses add pronouns as a class separate from nouns, and subdivide conjunctions into subordinators and coordinators, and add the class of interjections. English also has a rich set of auxiliary verbs, such as have and do, expressing the categories of <b>mood</b> <b>and</b> aspect. Questions are marked by do-support, wh-movement (fronting of question words beginning with wh-) and word order inversion with some verbs.|$|E
5|$|Biblical Hebrew had {{a typical}} Semitic {{morphology}} with nonconcatenative morphology, arranging Semitic roots into patterns to form words. Biblical Hebrew distinguished two genders (masculine, feminine), three numbers (singular, plural, and uncommonly, dual). Verbs were marked for voice and <b>mood,</b> <b>and</b> had two conjugations {{which may have}} indicated aspect and/or tense (a matter of debate). The tense or aspect of verbs was also influenced by the conjugation , in the so-called waw-consecutive construction. Default word order was verb–subject–object, and verbs inflected for the number, gender, and person of their subject. Pronominal suffixes could be appended to verbs (to indicate object) or nouns (to indicate possession), and nouns had special construct states for use in possessive constructions.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{symptoms}} of low <b>mood</b> <b>and</b> energy, individuals with depression may {{be likely to}} have behaviors that are counter to good sleep hygiene, such as taking naps during the day, consuming alcohol near bedtime, and consuming large amounts of caffeine during the day. In addition to sleep hygiene education, bright light therapy can be a useful treatment for individuals with depression. Not only can morning bright light therapy help establish a better sleep-wake schedule, {{but it also has}} been shown to be effective for treating depression directly, especially when related to seasonal affective disorder.|$|E

5|$|Kristin Lemmerman of CNN {{said that}} it is not great literature: 'Her prose has more in common with your typical beach-blanket fare and the {{beginning}} contained too much recap to introduce characters to new readers, although Rowling quickly gets back on track, introducing readers to a host of well-drawn new characters.' Writing for Salon.com, Charles Taylor was generally positive about the change of <b>mood</b> <b>and</b> development of characters. Entertainment Weekly reviewer Kristen Baldwin gave Goblet of Fire the grade of A-, praising the development of the characters as well as the many themes presented. However, she did worry that a shocking climax may be a nightmare factory for young readers.|$|E
5|$|The {{huntingtin}} protein interacts with over 100 other proteins, {{and appears to}} have multiple biological functions. The behavior of this mutated protein is not completely understood, but it is toxic to certain cell types, particularly in the brain. Early damage is most evident in the striatum, but as the disease progresses, {{other areas of the}} brain are also more conspicuously affected. Early symptoms are attributable to functions of the striatum and its cortical connections—namely control over movement, <b>mood</b> <b>and</b> higher cognitive function. DNA methylation also appears to be changed in HD.|$|E

In the meantime, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) was filming the twentieth James Bond film, Die Another Day, directed by Lee Tamahori. The previous film in the franchise, The World Is Not Enough (1999) was a box office success earning US$362 million worldwide. However, the eponymous soundtrack single by alternative rock group Garbage failed to gain commercial success in the United States.

5|$|Alcohol {{detoxification}} or 'detox' for alcoholics is {{an abrupt}} stop of alcohol drinking {{coupled with the}} substitution of drugs, such as benzodiazepines, that have similar effects to prevent alcohol withdrawal. Individuals who are only at risk of mild to moderate withdrawal symptoms can be detoxified as outpatients. Individuals at risk of a severe withdrawal syndrome {{as well as those}} who have significant or acute comorbid conditions are generally treated as inpatients. Detoxification does not actually treat alcoholism, and it is necessary to follow up detoxification with an appropriate treatment program for alcohol dependence or abuse to reduce the risk of relapse. Some symptoms of alcohol withdrawal such as depressed <b>mood</b> <b>and</b> anxiety typically take weeks or months to abate while other symptoms persist longer due to persisting neuroadaptations. Alcoholism has serious adverse effects on brain function; on average it takes one year of abstinence to recover from the cognitive deficits incurred by chronic alcohol abuse.|$|E

They also experienced more intense negative <b>moods,</b> nervousness, <b>and</b> restlessness relative to the average levels of these constructs for the sample.
