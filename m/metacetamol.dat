40|$|Understanding the {{polymorphic}} {{behavior of}} active pharmaceutical ingredients {{is important for}} formulation purposes and regulatory reasons. <b>Metacetamol</b> is an isomer of paracetamol and it similarly exhibits polymorphism. In the present article, {{it has been found}} that one of the polymorphs of <b>metacetamol</b> is only stable under increased pressure, which has led to the conclusion that <b>metacetamol</b> like paracetamol is a monotropic system under ordinary (= laboratory) conditions and that it becomes enantiotropic under pressure with the I-II-L triple point coordinates for <b>metacetamol</b> TI-II-L = 535 ± 10 K and PI-II-L = 692 ± 70 MPa. However, whereas for paracetamol the enantiotropy under pressure can be foreseen, because the metastable polymorph is denser, in the case of <b>metacetamol</b> this is not possible, as the metastable polymorph is less dense than the stable one. The existence of the stability domain for the less dense polymorph of <b>metacetamol</b> can only be demonstrated by the construction of the topological phase diagram as presented in this article. It is a delicate interplay between the specific volume differences and the enthalpy differences causing the stability domain of the less dense polymorph to be sandwiched between the denser polymorph and the liquid. <b>Metacetamol</b> shares this behavior with bicalutamide and fluoxetine nitrate.

40|$|The first {{continuous}} crystallization of a metastable polymorphic form of {{an active}} pharmaceutical ingredient is reported. Paracetamol form II, which displays enhanced solubility and compressibility {{in comparison to the}} stable form I, has been successfully crystallized in two continuous platforms: a continuous oscillatory baffled crystallizer and a mixed suspension mixed product removal (MSMPR) system, {{in the presence of the}} structurally similar molecule <b>metacetamol</b> as a template molecule. Samples from both crystallizers display high polymorphic purity and high solid phase purity, with the samples from the MSMPR in particular showing no evidence of the presence of a residual template molecule. The crystallization was found to be rapidly transferrable between the two continuous platforms. Samples produced display good stability with respect to the known form II to form I transition, reflecting the polymorphic selectivity achieved...|$|E
40|$|The {{importance}} of crystals to {{the pharmaceutical industry}} is evident - over 90 % of pharmaceutical products contain a drug in crystalline form. However, the crystallization phenomena of drug compounds are poorly understood. An increased understanding of these processes may allow {{a greater degree of}} control over the crystallization outcomes, such as morphology, purity, or stability. In these studies, we have applied Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) to the in situ investigations of drug crystal growth. We utilized AFM to assess the growth on the (001) face of aspirin crystals at two supersaturations, elucidating both the growth mechanisms and kinetics at each supersaturation. We also investigated the nucleation of aspirin crystals, using microcontact printing to arrange aspirin-binding and non-binding self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) onto surfaces. This facilitated the visualization, using AFM, of the growth of aspirin crystals adhered to the surface. Additionally, secondary nucleation was observed on the growing crystals. The effect of the additives acetanilide and <b>metacetamol</b> on the morphology and growth on the (001) face of paracetamol was investigated. The presence of <b>metacetamol</b> significantly reduced the growth rate on the face, with respect to pure paracetamol solutions. The growing steps exhibited a pinned appearance, consistent with the Cabrera and Vermilyea model. Conversely, acetanilide caused dissolution to occur. Finally, we assessed the capabilities of AFM in following the structural transformations of crystals, which can occur in unstable pharmaceutical compounds. We employed AFM to determine the process by which anion exchange, and the subsequent structural transformations, of the co-ordination polymers {[Ag(4, 4 '-bipy) ]BF 4 } and {[Ag(4, 4 '-bipy) ]NO 3 } occur. AFM data verified that the anion exchange process is solvent-mediated. The mechanisms underlying this process are discussed herein. These results reiterate the capability of AFM to monitor dynamic events on crystal surfaces. Analogous studies could be applied to numerous pharmaceutical compounds, thus facilitating the optimization of their crystallization parameters. In essence, future experiments using AFM may afford greater control over crystallization, and prevent the production of unwanted or unstable pharmaceutical compounds.

40|$|Single {{crystal growth}} (S. C. G) {{experiments}} {{were conducted to}} investigate face specific growth rates of paracetamol (acetaminophen) crystals. There are a few examples in literature where S. C. G of paracetamol crystals and different process conditions are analysed [1] but no examples of the addition of structurally related impurities (<b>Metacetamol</b> and Acetanilide) can be found. Carefully selected conditions of supersaturation and temperature were also analysed. The resulting growth rates were then determined in two solvents, ethanol and 3 -Methyl- 1 -butanol. The impact of the structurally related impurities on the solubility of paracetamol was determined in each of solvents investigated. The relative growth rates of pairs of faces and the associated habit change of monoclinic paracetamol was observed using in-situ optical microscopy. The respective growth rates increased with an increase of supersaturation and temperature, as the impurity concentration increased the relative growth rate of the faces decrease...|$|E
40|$|Sono-crystallisation {{has been}} used to enhance {{crystalline}} product quality particularly in terms of purity, particle size and size distribution. In this work, the effect of impurities and ultrasound on crystallisation processes (nucleation temperature, yield) and crystal properties (crystal size distribution determined by Focused Beam Reflectance Measurement (FBRM), crystal habit, filtration rate and impurity content in the crystal product by Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectroscopy (LC-MS)) were investigated in bulk suspension crystallisation experiments with and without the use of ultrasound. The results demonstrate that ultrasonic intervention has a significant effect on both crystallisation and product crystal properties. It increases the nucleation rate resulting in smaller particles and a narrower Particle Size Distribution (PSD), the yield {{has been shown to be}} increase as has the product purity. The effect of ultrasound is to reduce the level acetanilide impurity incorporated during growth from a 2 mol% solution of the selected impurity from 0. 85 mol% to 0. 35 mol% and likewise ultrasound reduces the uptake of <b>metacetamol</b> from 1. 88 mol% to 1. 52 mol%...|$|E
