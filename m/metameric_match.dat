50|$|The word {{metamerism}} {{is often}} incorrectly used {{to indicate a}} metameric failure rather than a match, or incorrectly used to describe {{a situation in which}} a <b>metameric</b> <b>match</b> is easily degraded by a slight change in conditions, such as a change in the illuminant.|$|E
5000|$|Metameric matches {{made between}} two light sources provide the {{trichromatic}} basis of colorimetry. For any given light stimulus, {{regardless of the}} form of its spectral emittance curve, there always exists a unique mixture of three [...] "primary" [...] lights that when added together, or added to the stimulus, will be an exact <b>metameric</b> <b>match.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{difference}} in the spectral compositions of two metameric stimuli {{is often referred to}} as the degree of metamerism. The sensitivity of a <b>metameric</b> <b>match</b> to any changes in the spectral elements that form the colors depend on the degree of metamerism. Two stimuli with a high degree of metamerism are likely to be very sensitive to any changes in the illuminant, material composition, observer, field of view, and so on.|$|E
50|$|<b>Metameric</b> <b>matches</b> {{are quite}} common, {{especially}} in near neutral (grayed or whitish colors) or dark colors. As colors become brighter or more saturated, {{the range of}} possible <b>metameric</b> <b>matches</b> (different combinations of light wavelengths) becomes smaller, especially in surface colors.|$|R
40|$|<b>Metameric</b> color <b>matches</b> {{depend on}} the observer’s color {{matching}} functions. Data were collected on observer variability in typical <b>metameric</b> <b>matches.</b> A Monte Carlo simulation, using a model of color matching functions and physiological data, was performed to derive a complete colorimetric system capable of predicting inter-observer variability in addition to mean color matches...|$|R
50|$|Making <b>metameric</b> <b>matches</b> using {{reflective}} {{materials is}} more complex. The appearance of surface colors {{is defined by}} the product of the spectral reflectance curve of the material and the spectral emittance curve of the light source shining on it. As a result, the color of surfaces depends on the light source used to illuminate them.|$|R
50|$|Color matches made in {{the paint}} {{industry}} are often aimed at achieving a spectral color match rather than just a tristimulus (metameric) color match under a given spectrum of light. A spectral color match attempts to give two colors the same spectral reflectance characteristic, making them a good <b>metameric</b> <b>match</b> with a low degree of metamerism, and thereby reducing {{the sensitivity of the}} resulting color match to changes in illuminant, or differences between observers.|$|E
5000|$|The term {{illuminant}} metameric {{failure is}} sometimes {{used to describe}} situations where two material samples match when viewed under one light source but not another. Most types of fluorescent lights produce an irregular or peaky spectral emittance curve, so that two materials under fluorescent light might not match, {{even though they are}} a <b>metameric</b> <b>match</b> to an incandescent [...] "white" [...] light source with a nearly flat or smooth emittance curve. Material colors that match under one source will often appear different under the other.|$|E
40|$|In those {{industries}} in which materials are colored to close specifications, {{a means of}} evaluating the degree of metamerism of colored objects is of considerable importance. Based on Wyszecki 2 ̆ 7 s hypothesis and its application to quantifying metamerism as described by Fairman, parameric decomposition is a technique to adjust one spectrum of a parameric match {{in order to achieve}} a perfect (<b>metameric)</b> <b>match</b> under a specific illumination and observer condition. This method can be viewed as batch correction using three 2 ̆ 2 colorants 2 ̆ 2 where the color-mixing model is linear in reflectance. The research in this thesis presented these methods using the basis functions from the CIE color-matching functions (CMFs) as well as alternative basis functions derived from dimensionality reduction techniques such as principal component analysis (PCA) and independent component analysis (ICA) for a pre-defined DuPont spectral dataset and Munsell dataset. 1, 152 parameric pairs surrounding 24 color centers were synthesized using an automotive finish paint system and two-constant Kubelka-Munk turbid-media theory. Each parameric pair was corrected to a metameric pair using these various methods. The corrected spectra were compared with the formulated spectra using Kubelka-Munk theory to evaluate the parameric decomposition accuracy in terms of special and general metameric indices. The results showed that the estimated metameric indices from the CMFs-based process primaries presented relatively poor correlation to those from Kubelka-Munk theory. The process primaries from ICA for the Munsell IV dataset showed almost indentical performance in estimation of metameric indices to the process primaries from the PCA for Munsell dataset as well as those from ICA for the DuPont dataset. These three sets of process primaries showed slightly better performance in estimation of metameric indices than the process primaries from PCA for the DuPont dataset...|$|E

40|$|Color {{quality is}} a vital concern in the {{printing}} industry. The ability of an LCD monitor to accurately and consistently predict {{the color of a}} printed work is often in doubt. According to Chung (2005), color reproduction technology is different for soft proofing and hard proofing which could lead a layman to believe that the two technologies may not produce the same result. Nevertheless, it is still possible for both reproduction technologies to achieve a <b>metameric</b> <b>match</b> which gives the same perceived color sensation between display and print. ISO/CD 14681 provides guidelines for creating the conditions required to perform soft proofing. This standard builds on ISO 12646 requirements for monitors and introduces a new softproofing environment (lightbooth with integrated monitor) to better meet the needs of industrial users. The ISO 14681 integrated viewing environment removes one important obstacle to achieving print to softproof match, i. e., the problem of simultaneous color contrast inherent in using a dim monitor surround with a bright paper viewing condition for soft proofing. Thus, the first objective of this research was to assess print to softproof visual match in the ISO 14681 integrated viewing environment. Nevertheless, even in this environment, inconsistency between paper white and monitor white remains as the next major obstacle to achieving consistent print to softproof match. Thus, a second objective of this research is to develop a methodology for matching the monitor 2 ̆ 7 s white point to the white point of the paper viewed in an ISO 14681 integrated viewing environment. The methodology for fulfilling these objectives began with the creation of the hardware/software environment required to support experimentation. This environment consisted of a 24 -inch EIZO CG 242 W display conforming to ISO 12646 and an integrated viewing environment conforming to the P 2 specification in ISO 3664 : 2009. Two ISO 12647 - 2 conformed press sheets were prepared and became the reference for the experiment. The researcher next developed a methodology for matching the monitor white point to the white point of the paper under the P 2 viewing condition. Finally, a panel of observers was used to compare print to softproof match for four display conditions in a paired comparison experiment. The results of the experiment were highly encouraging. The mismatch between monitor and paper white points, as measured by the sum of the differences in R, G, and B counts between the monitor and the paper, was reduced by nearly 90...|$|E
40|$|According to {{the pigment}} theory of <b>matching,</b> <b>metameric</b> <b>matches</b> {{result from the}} {{equation}} of the rates of photoisomerizations {{for each of the}} three classes of cone pigments excited by the two matched fields. If true, matches are radiance-invariant and additive. Tests of the theory in this paper show small but ubiquitous failures in radiance-invariance due to systematic rather than random errors in matching. A choice between two possible explanations for these systematic errors favors the view that in subjects who deliberately or intuitively search for the middle of the matching range, the errors are due to an asymmetry in the Weber fraction for color (Trezona) at low (but not high) levels of retinal illuminance...|$|R

In this letter, we show a pair of all-dielectric metameric filters offering a hidden image effect with the color shift at a specific angle of observation. These filters are designed by two materials TiO 2 /SiO 2 based on the different angle color target optimization.

40|$|Optical {{security}} devices play {{an essential role}} in the fight against counterfeiting. In this paper, we study and design a pair of metal-dielectric optical filters based on metameric effect, which offer a hidden image effect by the color shift at a specific angle of observation. Compared with all-dielectric multilayer system, the metal-dielectric multilayer structure has larger color shift with varying incident angle, higher color saturation and fewer layers. Finally, the stacks with 5 layers and 7 layers are achieved, and the color difference index is only 0. 71, which shows good <b>metameric</b> <b>matching</b> effect. Simultaneously, the sensitivity of filters to deposition errors is analyzed when the thickness deviation is ± 2 %, and the results show that the two filters have good manufacturability...|$|R

40|$|CIE {{colorimetry}} {{was introduced}} 65 {{years ago to}} describe the colorimetric properties of coloured lights and signals. Soon after establishment {{it turned out that}} it is most capable to describe the colorimetry of reflective media and is now widely applied in all branches of the colouring industries (e. g. in the textile, paper and automotive industry), where the aim is to produce as far as possible non-metameric matches, i. e. matches where the standard and the test samples show similar spectral reflectance. With the advance of modern light sources (gas discharge lamps with and without phosphors, emitting in narrow emission bands) and the use of colour monitors it became important to deal with <b>metameric</b> <b>matches</b> (where only the colour is the same, but the spectral power distribution is very different) and to find ways to describe not only colour matches but also colour appearance.

5000|$|The color {{circle is}} used for, among other purposes, {{illustrating}} additive color mixture. Combining two colored lights from {{different parts of}} the spectrum may produce a third color that appears like a light from another part of the spectrum, even though dissimilar wavelengths are involved. This type of color matching is known as <b>metameric</b> <b>matching.</b> [...] Thus a combination of green and red light might produce a color close to yellow in apparent hue. The newly formed color lies between the two original colors on the color circle, but they are usually represented as being joined by a straight line on the circle, the location of the new color closer to the (white) centre of the circle indicating that the resulting hue is less saturated (i.e., paler) than either of the two source colors. The combination of any two colors in this way are always less saturated than the two pure spectral colors individually.|$|R
40|$|For {{trichromatic}} color measurement, the empirically based structure {{consists of}} the set of colored lights, with its operations of additive mixture and scalar multiplication, and the binary relation of <b>metameric</b> <b>matching.</b> The representing numerical structure is a vector space. The important axioms are Grassmann's laws. The vector representation is constructed in a canonical or coordinate-free manner, mainly using Grassmann's additivity law. Trichromacy is used only to fix the dimensionality. Color theories attempt to get a more unique homomorphism by enriching the basic empirical structure with new empirical relations, subject to new axioms. Examples of such enriching relations include: discriminability or dissimilarity ordering of color pairs; dichromatic matching relations; and unidimensional matching relations, or codes. Representation theorems for the latter two examples are based on Grassmann-type laws also. The relationship between a Grassmann structure and its unidimensional Grassmann codes is modeled by {{the relationship between a}} vector space and its dual space of linear functionals. Dual spaces are used to clarify theorems relating to the three-pigment hypothesis and to reduction dichromacy...|$|R
40|$|AIMS—To {{examine the}} colour vision of {{juvenile}} patients suffering from diabetes mellitus without retinopathy {{in relation to}} metabolic and ophthalmic state.  METHODS—Metameric matches, both Rayleigh (red/green) and Moreland (blue/green) were {{used to test the}} colour vision yearly of 10  juvenile patients. The patients were monitored over 4  years, and during the final year, their blood glucose level was determined directly after testing colour vision. An ophthalmic examination was performed on the day of colour vision testing and blood and urine were analysed regularly throughout the 4  years. Their results are compared with an aged matched control group of 20  subjects, seven of whom were retested after 9 - 16 months.  RESULTS—After 4  years, the colour vision results show an enlarged matching range for the Moreland match, as well as a smaller increase in the matching range for the Rayleigh match. No significant correlation was found between blood glucose at the time of testing and any of the variables measured.  CONCLUSION—The pattern of colour vision deficits in <b>metameric</b> <b>matching</b> shown by juvenile diabetics is consistent with post-receptoral alterations of the inner retina, at this preretinopic stage of disease. Duration of diabetes is correlated with both colour vision changes and morphological alteration of the retina.    Keywords: anomaloscope; blood glucose; colour vision; diabete...|$|R
50|$|Using {{materials}} that are <b>metameric</b> color <b>matches</b> rather than spectral color matches is a significant problem in industries where color matching or color tolerances are important. A classic example is in automobiles: the interior fabrics, plastics and paints may be manufactured to provide a good color match under a standard light source (such as the sun), but the matches can disappear under different light sources (fluorescent or halide lights). Similar problems can occur in apparel manufactured from different types of dye or using different types of fabric, or in quality color printing using different types of inks. Papers manufactured with optical brighteners are especially susceptible to color changes when lights differ in their short wavelength radiation, which can cause some papers to fluoresce.|$|R
40|$|Patients {{suffering}} from AIDS develop ocular complications, {{the most frequent}} being HIV retinopathy. It is however not clear, if functional visual impairments can be observed as early indicators of ocular complications, before clinical diagnosis of HIV retinopathy is made at fundus examination. To address this issue, we measured colour vision {{in a group of}} 49 AIDS subjects with normal clinical fundi using the 'two equation method'. This method, combining red-green Rayleigh and the blue-green Moreland <b>metameric</b> <b>matches,</b> enables more complete and quantitative assessments of colour vision than those based on pigmentary tests. Data were collected on our computer controlled colorimeter and compared to those of normal subjects. While most AIDS subjects without HIV retinopathy demonstrated normal colour vision, a significant portion of them had wider matches than normal subjects (11 % for the Rayleigh equation and 16 % for the Moreland equation). Furthermore, matching ranges of the Moreland equation were significantly correlated with CD 4 lymphocyte counts. Patients with low CD 4 values tended to produce larger matching ranges than the patients with high CD 4 values. A within subject study on 17 patients confirmed this trend and showed that the patients who increased/decreased their CD 4 blood counts generally improved/impaired their colour discrimination in the Moreland match. No such correlation was found between the matching ranges of the Rayleigh equation and the CD 4 counts. These results show that colour discrimination is slightly reduced in some AIDS subjects, although there are no detectable ocular complications. They also suggest two different types of colour vision impairments in AIDS patients without retinopathy: one reversible process affecting colour discrimination in the blue-green range; and another irreversible process affecting colour discrimination in the red-green range...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{progress}} in tuneable solid-state light sources opens new opportunities in a niche and {{high added value}} lighting applications. The standard colorimetric technique of composing an identical colour coordinate metameric light spectra are facing the challenges due to the colour discrepancy noticed by the observers. A side-by-side colour matching experiment was performed with two tuneable tetrachromatic RAGB lamps (638 nm red, 598 nm pc amber, 518 nm green, 451 nm blue LEDs) to compare the colour of the metameres in a 10 -deg viewing angle. The <b>metameric</b> light <b>matching</b> was investigated using a 2 -deg (CIE 1931) and 10 -deg (CIE 1964) XYZ colour matching function. Both colour matching functions of standard colorimetric observers were shown to be inaccurate for aligning of metameric spectral power distributions without a noticeable difference in a perceived colour. On the other hand, a wide scatter of individual results revealed that the standard colour matching functions are inherently limited and in some cases, especially in professional lighting applications, the individually adjustable metameric lighting approach is to be considered...|$|R
