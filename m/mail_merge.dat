2500|$|A second {{high-profile}} and uniquely implemented filibuster in the Ontario Legislature {{occurred in}} April, 1997, where the Ontario New Democratic Party, then in opposition, tried {{to prevent the}} governing Progressive Conservatives' Bill 103 from taking effect. To protest the Tory government's legislation that would amalgamate the municipalities of Metro Toronto into the [...] "megacity" [...] of Toronto, the small NDP caucus introduced 11,500 amendments to the megacity bill, created on computers with <b>mail</b> <b>merge</b> functionality. Each amendment would name a street in the proposed city, and provide that public hearings be held into the megacity with residents of the street invited to participate. The Ontario Liberal Party also joined the filibuster with a smaller series of amendments; a typical Liberal amendment would give a historical designation to a named street. The NDP then added another series of over 700 amendments, each proposing a different date for the bill to come into force.|$|E

The [...] "Full Screen" [...] mode (introduced in Mac OS X Lion) hides the menubar and toolbars, allowing users to focus on a single document without being distracted by other windows on the screen. Earlier versions featured <b>mail</b> <b>merge,</b> which automatically populated custom fields with contact data from Address Book or from Numbers to create personalized documents. For example, if a user wanted to send one letter to three different people, <b>mail</b> <b>merge</b> allowed him to create a single document with placeholder fields that were populated when printing. The <b>Mail</b> <b>Merge</b> feature was completely removed in version 5. Tables and charts pasted from Numbers are automatically updated if the original spreadsheet is changed.|$|E

In 1942, the abbreviated NewsMail masthead replaced the original name.|$|R

50|$|<b>Mail</b> <b>merge</b> is {{a process}} to create personalised letters and pre-addressed {{envelopes}} or mailing labels for mass mailings from a form letter. The feature is usually employed in a word processing document which contains fixed text (which is the same in each output document) and variables (which act as placeholders that are replaced by text from the data source). The feature dates back to early word processors on personal computers, circa 1980. WordStar was perhaps the earliest to provide this, originally via an ancillary program called <b>Mail</b> <b>merge.</b> WordPerfect also offered this capacity for CP/M and MS-DOS systems, and Microsoft Word added it later on.|$|E
