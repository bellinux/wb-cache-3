Time series of wetness transformations generated from Landsat imagery {{have been used to}} detect {{mountain pine}} beetle red attack damage over large areas. With the recent availability of high spatial (QuickBird) and high spectral (Hyperion) resolution satellite sensor imagery, the relationship between spectral <b>moisture</b> <b>indices</b> and levels of red attack damage may be investigated. Six <b>moisture</b> <b>indices</b> were generated from Hyperion data and were compared to the proportion of the Hyperion pixel having red attack damage.

The results corroborate the hypothesis that changes in foliage moisture resulting from mountain pine beetle attack are driving the broad-scale temporal variation in Landsat derived wetness indices.

40|$|The {{previous}} research performed laboratory experiments {{to measure the}} impacts of the curing on the indirect tensile strength of both CIR-foam and CIR-emulsion mixtures. However, a fundamental question was raised during the {{previous research}} regarding {{a relationship between the}} field moisture content and the laboratory moisture content. Therefore, during this research, both temperature and moisture conditions were measured in the field by embedding the sensors at a midpoint and a bottom of the CIR layer. The main objectives of the research are to: (1) measure the moisture levels throughout a CIR layer and (2) develop a <b>moisture</b> loss <b>index</b> to determine the optimum curing time of CIR layer before HMA overlay. To develop a set of <b>moisture</b> loss <b>indices,</b> the <b>moisture</b> contents and temperatures of CIR-foam and CIR-emulsion layers were monitored for five months. Based on the limited field experiment, the following conclusions are derived: 1. The moisture content of the CIR layer can be monitored accurately using the capacitance type moisture sensor. 2. The <b>moisture</b> loss <b>index</b> for CIR layers is a viable tool in determining the optimum timing for an overlay without measuring actual moisture contents. 3. The modulus back-calculated based on the deflection measured by FWD seemed to be in a good agreement with the stiffness measured by geo-gauge. 4.

We proposed a revised EWT at canopy level (EWTCAN) based on weekly field measurements of fuel moisture in seven species during the 2010 dry period, considering the mixture of plant functional types for water use (trees, shrubs and herbaceous layers) and a varying vegetation cover. MODIS vegetation indexes computed and smoothed over the dry season were highly correlated with the EWTCAN. The performances of <b>moisture</b> <b>indexes</b> Normalized Difference Infrared Index (NDII 6 and NDII 7) and Global <b>Moisture</b> Vegetation <b>Index</b> (GVMI 6 and GVMI 7) were comparable, whereas for biomass vegetation indexes, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Modified Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (MSAVI) and Adjusted Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (ANDVI) performed better than Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) and Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI). We also identified the effect of Leaf Area Index (LAI) on EWTCAN monitoring at the regional scale under the tree cover/LAI gradient of the region from relatively dense to open forest. Statistical analysis revealed a significant decreasing linear relationship; indicating that for LAI less than two, the greater the LAI, the less responsive are the vegetation indexes to changes in EWTCAN; whereas for higher LAI, its influence becomes less significant and was not considered in the inversion models based on vegetation indexes. The EWTCAN time-course from LAI-adapted inversion models based on significantly-related vegetation indexes to EWTCAN showed close profiles resulting from the inversion models using NDVI, ANDVI, MSAVI and NDII 6 applied during the dry season.

This integration has largely been in two areas: first, through the inclusion of continuous remote sensing products such as normalized difference vegetation <b>index</b> (NDVI) or <b>moisture</b> <b>indices</b> to answer large-area questions associated with the epidemiology of vector-borne diseases or other health exposures; and second, through image classification to map discrete landscape patches that provide habitat to disease-vectors or that promote poor health. In this second arena, new improvements in object-based image analysis (or “OBIA”) can provide advantages for public health research. Rather than classifying each pixel based on its spectral content alone, the OBIA approach first segments an image into objects, or segments, based on spatially connected pixels with similar spectral properties, and then these objects are classified based on their spectral, spatial and contextual attributes as well as by their interrelations across scales. The approach can lead to increases in classification accuracy, and it can also develop multi-scale topologies between objects that can be utilized to help understand human-disease-healt...|$|R

Abstract Traditional techniques in surface water balance computations revolve around point-based observed results of climatic variables. Basin-wide areal estimates derived from point interpolations may not reflect true character of sub-regional variations. Hence, pixel-wise water balance computation {{in the case of}} lower Yamuna river basin falling under Himalayan river system of India, is attempted in this paper using remote sensing and Geographical Information System based approach. A comparison of point and area-based estimates has been done based on both Thornthwaite and Penman methods. Water balance computations, aridity, humidity and <b>moisture</b> <b>indices,</b> surplus and deficit values at given data points have been used in map-based calculations by developing a script in GIS software – ILWIS (Integrated Land Water Information System). It was found that water balance computations, using point-based rainfall and other climatological data, result into broad generalization of deficit and surplus zones around meteorological stations. But, when zonal landuse and soil maps are crossed in GIS environment, then pixel-wise calculations of available water capacity can be used along with isohyeta...|$|R
