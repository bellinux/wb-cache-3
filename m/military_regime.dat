40|$|Excerpt] How do <b>military</b> <b>regimes</b> seek {{support or}} {{legitimacy}} from society? What strategies, besides violent repression, do military leaders use {{to remain in}} power? In other words, how do military leaders try to achieve hegemony? El Salvador’s long period of military rule (1931 - 1979) gives researchers ample opportunity to investigate the mechanisms whereby <b>military</b> <b>regimes</b> try to gain societal support. Erik Ching’s chapter shows that General Martinez’s regime sought support through locally based patron-client relationships. Some analysts of El Salvador’s subsequent <b>military</b> <b>regimes</b> find that these regimes pursued a political alliance with urban industrial workers {{in order to gain}} support. Nevertheless, the alliance between the state and urban industrial workers during the 1950 s and 1960 s remains overgeneralized in the literature. Even those who specify Salvadoran governmental policy during this period as “repression with reforms” do not fully elaborate the mechanisms whereby military leaders formed an alliance with urban industrial workers. Moreover, research on these later <b>military</b> <b>regimes</b> has not explored the role that gendered labor reforms played in solidifying the alliance. As a result of this oversight, researchers may have underestimated the reformist tendency of Salvadoran <b>military</b> <b>regimes</b> from 1944 to 1972. Drawing on newspaper accounts and government publications, we show that adopting labor legislation designed to protect women workers was an element of a broader government strategy to ally with urban industrial workers. Examining how <b>military</b> <b>regimes</b> seek societal support is important because each strategy to secure regime legitimacy may have different social implications. For example, gendered labor legislation can have important social implications for industrial women workers. Research on other countries suggests that labor laws giving women special protections tend to make employers less willing to hire them and that special legal protections for women workers can depress women’s participation in the industrial labor force. Therefore, by illuminating the gendered nature of the reforms pursued by the Salvadoran <b>military</b> <b>regimes,</b> we hope to contribute to future research on the potential relationship between labor reforms and women’s industrial labor force participation in El Salvador...|$|R

40|$|This study {{seeks to}} {{establish}} a basic theory that explains the policies and practices of civilian and <b>military</b> <b>regimes</b> on higher education in Nigeria. Specifically, the study seeks {{to determine whether or}} not the Nigerian <b>military</b> <b>regimes</b> gave top priority to higher education through financing, planning and staffing of the universities system of Nigeria. The first chapter is designed to set a general guideline for this research, mainly pointing to various methodological and theoretical foundations of the research. Chapter Two throws some light on the development of the British colonial policies that have influenced the contemporary behavior of the Nigerian public policy makers. In addition, it lays a foundation for the subsequent chapters through critical analysis of issues in the historical dynamics of Nigeria. Chapter Three focuses mainly on the comparative analysis of the general military public policy decrees from 1966 to 1978, regime by regime. The importance of this chapter is the fact that it synthesizes in an orderly manner those 2 ̆ 7 major decrees or public policies of the various Nigerian <b>military</b> <b>regimes.</b> Chapter Four is devoted to the study of a brief history of educational policies and philosophies in Nigeria. It examines the place of the University Education on the list of priorities affected by the Nigerian public policies. An effort is made to assess higher education policies and their implementation. In Chapter Five, an attempt is made to examine higher education policies under the Nigerian <b>military</b> <b>regimes.</b> Major emphasis is placed on policy orientations rather than technical issues. This section is pertinent and interesting because it is based upon a critical evaluation, as well as an objective assessment of Nigerian higher education policies. Chapter Six is devoted to the implementation of Nigerian higher education policies under the <b>military</b> <b>regimes.</b> It is in this chapter that the three policy areas [...] financing, staffing and planning are re-evaluated. Chapter Seven then deals with the evaluation and analysis of the problems and Chapter Eight presents the general summary and conclusions. As a part of the summary and conclusions, the overall implications, recommendations and contributions are presented. Thus, based on data available, it seems clear that the Nigerian <b>military</b> <b>regimes</b> developed and implemented an effective national higher education policy and gave financial, planning, and staffing priority to that policy. As a result, there are more equitable educational opportunities across the nation and the quality of education received has improved significantly under the Nigerian <b>military</b> <b>regimes...</b>|$|R

5|$|Although the {{question}} of official languages was settled by 1956, the <b>military</b> <b>regime</b> of Ayub Khan promoted the interests of West Pakistan {{at the expense of}} East Pakistan. Despite forming the majority of the national population, the East Pakistani population continued to be under-represented in the civil and military services, and received a minority of state funding and other government help. This was mainly due to lack of representative government in the fledgling state. Mainly due to regional economic imbalances sectional divisions grew, and support for the Bengali ethnic nationalist Awami League, which invoked the 6-point movement for greater provincial autonomy. One demand was that East Pakistan be called Bangladesh (Land/Country of Bengal), which subsequently led to the Bangladesh Liberation War.|$|E

5|$|In {{contrast}} to the political unrest in Saigon, the Communist leadership in North Vietnam were far {{more concerned about the}} best strategy to fight the South Vietnamese government and their American supporters. While all leaders in Hanoi shared the same goal of eventual reunification of their homeland, different factions within the Communist Party disagreed on the best method to achieve their desired goal. Members of North Vietnam's Politburo were divided by the issues surrounding the Soviet strategy of peaceful co-existence versus the Chinese strategy of supporting national liberation movements in emerging countries. Despite their differences of opinion, the Communist Party leadership ultimately made preparations for armed struggle in South Vietnam. From Hanoi's perspective, the <b>military</b> <b>regime</b> in Saigon was able to hold out because the Communist main forces were still not ready to fight a conventional war, so North Vietnam must focus on the development of its military force in the shortest period of time. In the meantime, however, the war must be kept at its current level in order to prevent the full involvement of the United States military.|$|E

5|$|Municipal {{elections}}, {{during which}} mayors are elected, take place every four years; they take place {{one year before}} presidential elections (since 2008) in the last Sunday of October. Candidates must comply a number of requisites in order {{to run for mayor}} of Pichilemu; those include: to have completed secondary education (Enseñanza Media), to be a citizen, literate, to have resided in the Libertador General Bernardo O'Higgins Region {{for at least two years}} before the election, and to have their military status regularized. The mayor is usually sworn in on the 6 December following the election. The next election for the mayor will be in 2016. Municipal elections originally elected three mayors, called primer, segundo, and tercer alcalde, and a number of regidores. For example, the results of the first elections in Pichilemu, for the term between 1894 and 1897, showed José María Caro Martínez, Pedro Nolasco de Mira, and Francisco Reyes elected as the first primer, segundo, and tercer alcalde of Pichilemu, respectively. The role of the primer alcalde equals that of the current mayor of Pichilemu. However, voting was not popular: only taxpayers and landowners could vote. According to the Decree #5655 of 4 December 1945, regidores were popularly elected, and they had the faculty to vote for the mayor that would rule for the local government three-year term. The 1973 Chilean coup d'état interrupted Washington Saldías Fuentealba's mayoral term, hence terminating possibilities of new elections. The <b>military</b> <b>regime</b> of Augusto Pinochet appointed seven mayors, who held the office in a period of nineteen years. Following the Chilean transition to democracy, the D'Hondt method of proportional representation was used in the municipal elections of 1992, 1996, and 2000: all candidates run in a single list, the most voted candidate becomes the mayor and other five/six become councilors, according to the aforementioned method. For the municipal elections beginning in 2004, candidates for mayor and councilor run in separate lists, and mayors are elected by simple majority of votes.|$|E

40|$|Abstract While {{much has}} been written about {{democracy}} and democratization, far less attention has been paid to the institutional organization of authoritarian regimes. Scholars have focused on the causes, economic policies, societal support, intra-elite conflicts, or human-rights violations of authoritarian regimes. More recently, political scientists have also studied the role of elections and legislatures on the survival of authoritarian regimes. However, the very different ways in which authoritarian <b>regimes,</b> and <b>military</b> <b>regimes</b> in particular, organize the government, occupy the state apparatus, and modify the country’s political institutions have largely gone under-theorized. This essay contributes to fill in this void by analyzing how the last <b>military</b> <b>regimes</b> of Argentina (1976 – 1983) and Brazil (1964 – 1985) organized power within the state and the legacies of such organization on the institutions of federalism. The essay argues that variation in the organization of the state under the <b>military</b> <b>regimes</b> accounts for the divergent origins of post-developmental decentralization, which in turn explains the contrasting evolution of intergovernmental relations in each country.
