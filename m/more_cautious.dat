5|$|Author Joan B. Huffman is <b>more</b> <b>cautious,</b> {{noting that}} crucial sources are {{unavailable}} since Frances destroyed all Eustace's letters to her. However, Huffman records {{that she did}} support her husband when his sister Alice repeatedly challenged him over his drinking.|$|E
5|$|In the afternoon, Sheaffe {{arrived on}} the {{battlefield}} with reinforcements and took command of the British forces. In sharp contrast to his predecessors' direct attacks, Sheaffe took a <b>more</b> <b>cautious</b> approach. This ultimately proved successful, leading to a total victory over the Americans.|$|E
5|$|Olaf Tryggvason's ships {{pass the}} {{anchorage}} of his allied enemies {{in a long}} column without order, as no attack is expected. Conveniently placed to observe the fleet, Jarl Eirik and the two kings remark upon the passing vessels. Svein and Olaf are eager to join battle, but Eirik is portrayed as <b>more</b> <b>cautious</b> and familiar with the Norwegian forces.|$|E
60|$|Fathers {{and mothers}} were {{naturally}} <b>more</b> slow and <b>cautious</b> in their {{recognition of the}} newcomer's merits.|$|R
6000|$|... "I'll be in Philadelphy to-night, an' to-morrow mornin' Jip Collins {{will be in}} the lock-up!" [...] Master Barney shouted vindictively, and, glancing back, Dan saw him {{approaching}} the alley once <b>more</b> with <b>cautious</b> steps, as if it were beneath his dignity as an officer of the law to move in any other fashion.|$|R
50|$|Contemporary reports also {{indicated}} {{that the cost of}} setting up a new production facility for the CX, on the northern edge of Paris, at Aulnay-sous-Bois, also played a role in undermining the company's finances {{to the point where it}} was obliged to surrender its independence to the <b>more</b> financially <b>cautious</b> Peugeot company. On 12 July 2012, PSA announced that it is permanently closing the Aulnay-sous-Bois plant.|$|R
5|$|There was inevitably a {{slowdown}} in the pace of military operations, as Abu Ubaidah ibn al-Jarrah would move slowly and steadily and was a <b>more</b> <b>cautious</b> commander. The conquest of Syria continued under his Generalship and, Abu Ubaidah being an admirer of Khalid, gave him command of the cavalry and used him as a military advisor.|$|E
5|$|France {{was willing}} to commit to a launch aid, or subsidies, while the Germans were <b>more</b> <b>cautious.</b> The UK {{government}} was unwilling to provide funding for the tooling requested by British Aerospace (BAe) and estimated at ₤250million, it was postponed for three years. On 1 March 1984 {{the government and the}} manufacturer agreed that ₤50million would be paid whether the A320 would fly or not, while the rest would be paid as a levy on each aircraft sold.|$|E
5|$|He {{finished}} his two-year-old {{season with a}} record of five wins and a second place from six starts. At the end of the season, some even believed that he was better than his sire Ormonde, the 'horse of the century'. One writer rated him ten pounds superior to the next best two-year-old La Fleche, with her being one pound superior to Flyaway. Some were <b>more</b> <b>cautious,</b> however, suggesting that Orme had not beaten any top horses.|$|E
60|$|The {{knowledge}} {{of my own}} short-comings at least served one good turn, since it made me <b>more</b> than usually <b>cautious,</b> and without delay I set about preparations for obeying the command given by Darius.|$|R
50|$|Victims of {{bullying}} typically are physically smaller, <b>more</b> sensitive, unhappy, <b>cautious,</b> anxious, quiet, and withdrawn. They are {{often described as}} passive or submissive. Possessing these qualities make these individuals vulnerable, as they are seen as being less likely to retaliate.|$|R
60|$|Now the {{progress}} was even <b>more</b> slow and <b>cautious.</b> It seemed at times as if Jim hardly moved, so afraid was he {{of making a}} noise; but the advance was certain, and finally he stopped, motioning for Jet to come beside him.|$|R
5|$|The Act of Uniformity 1558, which forced {{people to}} attend Sunday service in an Anglican church {{with a new}} version of the Book of Common Prayer, passed by only three votes. The Bill of Uniformity was <b>more</b> <b>cautious</b> than the initial Reformation Bill. It revoked the harsh laws {{proposed}} against Roman Catholics, it removed the abuse of the pope from the litany and kept the wording that allowed for both consubstantial and transubstantial beliefs in the presence of Christ in the Eucharist.|$|E
5|$|Upon commissioning, Emperor of India {{joined the}} 4th Battle Squadron of the Grand Fleet, based at Scapa Flow. She {{took part in}} {{numerous}} sorties into the northern North Sea to enforce the blockade of Germany, along with frequent training exercises and gunnery drills. Emperor of India was in dock for a refit in late May 1916, so she was unavailable for the Battle of Jutland. The increased danger from submarines led both the Grand Fleet and the German High Seas Fleet to pursue <b>more</b> <b>cautious</b> strategies after Jutland, {{which led to a}} less eventful war.|$|E
5|$|Biographer Lanny Ebenstein noted a drift {{over time}} in Friedman's views from an interventionist to a <b>more</b> <b>cautious</b> foreign policy. He {{supported}} US involvement in the Second World War and initially supported a hard line against Communism, but moderated over time. However Friedman did state in a 1995 interview {{that he is an}} anti-interventionist. He opposed the Gulf War and the Iraq War. In a spring 2006 interview, Friedman said that the USA's stature in the world had been eroded by the Iraq War, but that it might be improved if Iraq were to become a peaceful and independent country.|$|E
50|$|The first {{elements}} of the Finnish 11th Infantry Regiment (JR 11) landed unopposed {{at the port of}} Röyttä at 07.45 on 1 October and were welcomed by train which started transporting troops closer to the town. Lieutenant Colonel Halsti had planned to move his forces swiftly towards Kemi to secure the important bridges across the Kemi river - however after learning from the Finnish forces which had secured the town {{that there could be a}} whole German battalion in the vicinity he chose <b>more</b> a <b>cautious</b> approach.|$|R
50|$|From June 2004, the {{beginnings}} of a <b>more</b> general <b>cautious</b> re-engagement of EU countries with the new Iraq can begin to be discerned. A strategy paper produced by the EU the same month recommended an active European engagement with the new Iraqi government. The document envisaged the EU inviting Iraq to join the EU's Strategic Partnership for the Mediterranean and the Middle East. It also recommended that EU states join in pushing for Iraq to be admitted to the World Trade Organization, and that the EU should reinstate favored trading partner relations with Baghdad.|$|R
5000|$|During {{their initial}} days at sea tension between Ramsey and Hunter becomes {{apparent}} {{due to a}} clash of personalities: Hunter's <b>more</b> analytical, <b>cautious</b> approach, as opposed to Ramsey's more impulsive and intuitive approach. The Alabama eventually receives an Emergency Action Message, ordering the launch of ten of its missiles against the Russian nuclear installation, based on satellite information that the Russians' missiles are being fuelled. Before the Alabama can launch its missiles, a second radio message begins to be received, but is cut off by the attack of a Russian [...] loyal to Radchenko.|$|R
5|$|Conant (1929) gave a {{detailed}} account of the feeding behavior of a captive specimen from South Carolina. When prey was introduced, the snake quickly became attentive and made an attack. Frogs and small birds were seized and held until movement stopped. Larger prey was approached in a <b>more</b> <b>cautious</b> manner; a rapid strike was executed after which the snake would withdraw. In 2.5 years, the snake had accepted three species of frogs, including a large bullfrog, a spotted salamander, water snakes, garter snakes, sparrows, young rats, and three species of mice. Brimley (1944) described a captive specimen that ate copperheads (A. contortrix), as well as members of its own species, keeping its fangs embedded in its victims until they had been immobilized.|$|E
5|$|Cooper {{began his}} career as a film extra and stunt rider, but soon landed acting roles. After {{establishing}} himself as a Western hero in his early silent films, Cooper became a movie star in 1929 with his first sound picture, The Virginian. In the early 1930s, he expanded his heroic image to include <b>more</b> <b>cautious</b> characters in adventure films and dramas such as A Farewell to Arms (1932) and The Lives of a Bengal Lancer (1935). During the height of his career, Cooper portrayed a new type of hero—a champion of the common man—in films such as Mr. Deeds Goes to Town (1936), Meet John Doe (1941), Sergeant York (1941), The Pride of the Yankees (1942), and For Whom the Bell Tolls (1943).|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} speculated that this {{agreement}} marked a victory for Penda, ceding to him Cirencester and the areas along the lower River Severn. These lands to the southwest of Mercia had apparently been taken by the West Saxons from the Britons in 577, and the territory eventually {{became part of the}} subkingdom of the Hwicce. Given Penda's role in the area at this time and his apparent success there, {{it has been argued that}} the subkingdom of the Hwicce was established by him; evidence to support this is lacking, although the subkingdom is known to have existed later in the century. Bassett ("In search of the origins of Anglo-Saxon kingdoms", page 67) is <b>more</b> <b>cautious,</b> noting the lack of evidence.|$|E
50|$|Whisenhunt {{took over}} the role of {{offensive}} coordinator in Pittsburgh for the 2004 season after Mike Mularkey became the head coach of the Buffalo Bills. Although his predecessor Mularkey was known for creating flashy trick plays, Whisenhunt showed great success as <b>more</b> of a <b>cautious</b> innovator, whose well-timed trick plays contrasted the conservative Steelers run game.|$|R
50|$|Benefits of {{negative}} affect {{are present in}} areas of cognition including perception, judgment, memory and interpersonal personal relations. Since negative affect relies <b>more</b> on <b>cautious</b> processing than preexisting knowledge, people with negative affect tend to perform better in instances involving deception, manipulation, impression formation, and stereotyping. Negative affectivity's analytical and detailed processing of information leads to fewer reconstructive-memory errors, whereas positive mood relies on broader schematic to thematic information that ignores detail. Thus, information processing in negative moods reduces the misinformation effect and increases overall accuracy of details. People also exhibit less interfering responses to stimuli when given descriptions or performing any cognitive task.|$|R
50|$|On December 12, 1940, Jannazzo lost to Georgie Abrams in a ten-round split {{decision}} at Carlin's Park in Baltimore. Though leading {{in the first}} two rounds, Jannazzo lost the third, being called for a low blow. In the late rounds, a strong attack by Abrams gave him the decision. Abrams dominated the infighting, but Jannazzo put on a <b>more</b> scientific and <b>cautious</b> defense.|$|R
5|$|On the whole, Cecil and Dudley were {{in concord}} about {{policies}} while disagreeing fundamentally about some issues, {{such as the}} Queen's marriage and some areas of foreign policy. Cecil favoured the suit of Francois, Duke of Anjou, in 1578–1581 for Elizabeth's hand, while Leicester was among its strongest opponents, even contemplating exile in letters to Burghley. The Anjou courtship, {{at the end of}} which Leicester and several dozen noblemen and gentlemen escorted the French prince to Antwerp, also touched the question of English intervention in the Netherlands to help the rebellious provinces. This debate stretched over a decade until 1585, with the Earl of Leicester as the foremost interventionist. Burghley was <b>more</b> <b>cautious</b> of military engagement while in a dilemma over his Protestant predilections.|$|E
5|$|Samsung Galaxy then won {{the fourth}} game, also {{after winning a}} key fight over Baron. Despite losing two {{inhibitor}} buildings in their base, SKT was able to stall SSG with defensive play until the 42-minute mark, after which SSG took three Dragons – another in game objective – uncontested and gained buffs {{that allowed them to}} win the game. In the final game, SK Telecom played a <b>more</b> <b>cautious</b> gameplay style, which was effective against Samsung Galaxy's riskier play. SKT was able to grab two Baron kills and two Elder Dragon kills en route to winning the final game.|$|E
5|$|The {{battle was}} also {{considered}} {{a sign of}} the arrival of the Jet age, the Il-10, which had been considered a high quality and effective conventional aircraft in World War II had been easily outmatched by the F-80 and its jet engine. The engagement was a rare example of an air-to-air battle at the early phase of the war, and North Korean forces became much <b>more</b> <b>cautious</b> when deploying their aircraft in battle, knowing they were easily outnumbered and outmatched by UN forces. For the next several months, the UN forces enjoyed air supremacy, operating their air forces in support of ground combat virtually unopposed. The public perception of the F-80s, which had to this point been cautious, improved with news of the victories.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{would have}} you," [...] Phineas Duge said impressively, [...] "lay that little axiom of yours to heart, Mr. Deane. I {{think you will}} agree with me that a man in your {{position}} especially, the accredited ambassador of a great country, should show himself <b>more</b> than ordinarily <b>cautious</b> in all his doings and sayings, especially where the interests of any portion of his country people are concerned." ...|$|R
50|$|The Young Brothers Massacre {{was one of}} {{the events}} that persuaded law {{enforcement}} in the U.S. to take a <b>more</b> professional and <b>cautious</b> approach to armed standoff situations, particularly those involving persons suspected of previous violence towards police officers. A monument bearing the names of the six slain officers stands today in front of the police headquarters building in Springfield and in front of the Greene County Courts building.|$|R
40|$|The article {{examines}} the modes of communication set up during Pope Benedict XVI’s visit to Lebanon in September 2012. It tries {{to show how the}} local religious institution and the media – which constitute the main arms of the religious communities fighting for power – take over from the discourse papal, <b>more</b> modest and <b>cautious,</b> in order to create an act of presence and defiance to be invested in a context of regional religious radicalisation...|$|R
5|$|Walpole {{directed}} domestic policy, {{and after}} the resignation of his brother-in-law Townshend in 1730 also controlled George's foreign policy. Historians generally believe that George played an honorific role in Britain, and closely followed the advice of Walpole and senior ministers who made the major decisions. Although the king was eager for war in Europe, his ministers were <b>more</b> <b>cautious.</b> The Anglo-Spanish War was brought to an end, and George unsuccessfully pressed Walpole to join the War of the Polish Succession {{on the side of}} the German states. In April 1733, Walpole withdrew an unpopular excise bill that had gathered strong opposition, including from within his own party. George lent support to Walpole by dismissing the bill's opponents from their court offices.|$|E
5|$|A {{month after}} disappearing the Viet Cong 274th Regiment had emerged without warning and had caught 7 RAR by surprise, with the {{unexpected}} {{presence of a}} Viet Cong Main Force regiment in the Hat Dich forcing the Australians to change their tactics {{for the remainder of}} Operation Ballarat. The Australians became <b>more</b> <b>cautious</b> as a result and while 7 RAR continued its search and destroy mission, only two companies patrolled while the other two remained on standby in fire support bases nearby to provide support if required. Additional artillery support was also made available, with 161st Field Battery, Royal New Zealand Artillery airlifted into Fire Support Base Giraffe. Meanwhile, Graham placed 2 RAR on standby to fly into the area if needed and US forces were also positioned to the north. In this manner Ballarat continued until 16 August, however there was only minor contact which resulted in two more Viet Cong killed, two wounded and one captured for no further loss to the Australians.|$|E
5|$|A {{study of}} {{vigilance}} behaviour of herds revealed that individuals on {{the borders of}} herds {{tend to be more}} cautious; vigilance decreases with group size. Group size and distance from roads and bushes were found to have major influence on vigilance, more among the grazing springbok than among their browsing counterparts. Adults were found to be more vigilant than juveniles, and males more vigilant than females. Springbok passing through bushes tend to be more vulnerable to predator attacks as they can not be easily alerted, and predators usually conceal themselves in bushes. Another study calculated that the time spent in vigilance by springbok on the edges of herds is roughly double that spent by those in the centre and the open. Springbok were found to be <b>more</b> <b>cautious</b> in the late morning than at dawn or in the afternoon, and more at night than in the daytime. Rates and methods of vigilance were found to vary with the aim of lowering risk from predators.|$|E
5000|$|Opinions Now with Chris David: Parodies [...] "debate" [...] {{shows like}} Hardball with Chris Matthews. The host is very loud, {{constantly}} {{leans forward and}} glares at the camera, and demands solid answers, or at least strong opinions, at all times. Taking a jab at modern television news shows, the <b>more</b> level-headed and <b>cautious</b> experts are often ignored in favor of other guests with more extreme and livid views on the subject at hand.|$|R
30|$|Ageing {{may have}} {{different}} effects on the workers’ productivity. Older workers may be more reliable and have better skills than average workers. However, older workers may have higher health care costs for firms and may be less flexible in accepting new tasks and even less appropriate for training (Barth et al. 1993). Establishing how age affects labour productivity is difficult, both because productivity is individual and sector specific, {{and because of the}} interaction between age, cohort, and selection effects. Nevertheless, age by itself is generally found to be a weak predictor of individual performance. While there exist wide differences between jobs and workers, older workers are typically regarded as <b>more</b> consistent, <b>cautious,</b> and slow but conscientious. Older workers have also fewer accidents and are less likely to quit, thus decreasing the hiring costs.|$|R

"You see, Deane," [...] he continued, [...] "Olive is my only daughter, and {{it makes}} one <b>more</b> than ordinarily <b>cautious.</b> This blackmailing case of yours has set people talking a bit. Of course, I think you were right. It was a brave and sportsmanlike thing to do. The man is {{committed}} for trial, and I only hope he'll get penal servitude. All the same, {{there are a lot}} of people, you know, Deane, who don't take quite the same view of it." ...|$|R
