40|$|Menstrual {{bleeding}} {{patterns are}} considered relevant indicators of reproductive health, though {{few studies have}} evaluated patterns among regularly menstruating premenopausal women. The authors evaluated self-reported bleeding patterns, incidence of spotting, and associations with reproductive hormones among 201 women in the BioCycle Study (2005 â€“ 2007) with 2 consecutive cycles. Bleeding patterns were assessed by using daily ques-tionnaires and pictograms. Marginal structural models were used to evaluate associations between endogenous hormone concentrations and subsequent total reported blood loss and bleeding length by weighted linear mixed-effects models and weighted parametric survival analysis models. Women bled for a median of 5 days (standard deviation: 1. 5) during menstruation, with heavier bleeding during the first 3 days. Only 4. 8 % of women experienced <b>midcycle</b> <b>bleeding.</b> Increased levels of follicle-stimulating hormone (b 0. 20, 95 % confidence interval: 0. 13, 0. 27) and progesterone (b 0. 06, 95 % confidence interval: 0. 03, 0. 09) throughout the cycle were associated with heavier menstrual bleeding, and higher follicle-stimulating hormone levels were associated with longer menses. Bleeding duration and volume were reduced after anovulatory compared with ovulatory cycles (geometric mean blood loss: 29. 6 vs. 47. 2 mL; P 0. 07). Study findings suggest that detailed characterizations of bleeding patterns may provide more insight than previously thought as noninvasive markers for endocrine status in a given cycle...|$|E
40|$|We treated 22 hirsute {{women with}} {{spironolactone}} {{in an open}} trial {{to determine whether it}} caused objective changes in hair growth. Among them, 18 women completed 12 months therapy with 200 mg spironolactone daily. During this period, the mean daily linear growth rates of hair on the face, abdomen, and thigh were reduced to 66 % (P less than 0. 001), 75 % (P less than 0. 01), and 72 % (P less than 0. 001) of their pretreatment values. The mean hair shaft diameters were reduced to 83 % (P less than 0. 01) on the face, 88 % (P less than 0. 001) on the arm, 74 % (P less than 0. 01) on the abdomen, and 80 % (P less than 0. 001) on the thigh. Daily hair volume production was calculated from the diameter and daily growth rate; it was reduced to 60 % (P less than 0. 01) on the face, 52 % (P less than 0. 01) on the arm, 34 % (P less than 0. 001) on the abdomen, and 48 % (P less than 0. 001) on the thigh. Six of the 18 women who completed the study developed <b>midcycle</b> vaginal <b>bleeding,</b> and 3 women had previously irregular menstrual cycles regulated. We conclude that spironolactone is effective and well tolerated for hirsute women...|$|R
