It continues {{to be one of}} the longest-running Easter passion plays in the nation and was the basis for the 1949 movie The Prince of Peace. The passion play was also featured in a documentary called Jesus Town, USA which focuses on a new actor portraying the role of Jesus after the former actor of 8 years retired from the role.

It's a franchise we still believe we can do something with — we just need to see what that something is." [...] Tim Gerritsen, business development director at Human Head Studios, said, [...] "While we are disappointed that we won’t be able to deliver our vision of the game, we remain proud of our work on the franchise, which we feel speaks for itself, including the award-winning presentation of the game at E3 2011. We enjoyed working with the many talented people at Bethesda, and we wish them all the best of luck with any future plans they may have for the franchise." ...|$|E
