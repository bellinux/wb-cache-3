40|$|Supplier {{sourcing}} {{strategies are}} a crucial factor driving supply chain success. In particular, a firm’s allocation decision for determining an appropriate supplier set and order allotment impacts all competitive dimensions for {{the delivery of}} finished goods to its customers. While many firms utilize a single supplier strategy, others diversify their supply risk by sourcing from multiple suppliers. In this paper, we investigate the implications of uncertain supplier reliability on a firm’s sourcing decisions in an environment with stochastic demand. In particular, we characterize conditions under which a firm should choose a single versus multiple supplier sourcing strategy. We also show that a supplier’s unit cost dominates any reliability considerations when determining whether a particular supplier receives an order. A counterintuitive result is that placing a single order with the lowest cost supplier is preferable when demand is highly uncertain. Based on numerical examples, we also illustrate the impact of <b>minimum</b> <b>order</b> <b>quantities</b> on supplier sourcing decisions. ...|$|R

40|$|In fashion retailing, {{inventory}} {{decisions are}} usually {{made by a}} human manager who is not necessarily perfectly rational. In this situation, the inventory decisions made {{may not always be}} optimal. At the same time, with advances in technology, fashion retailers have access to the latest market information and can implement the quick response (QR) system that is very helpful to systematically deal with market disruptions. In this paper, we explore the value of QR with the consideration of a boundedly rational human manager in the fashion retailing company. We show that for both cases, with and without QR, the human retail manager's level of bounded rationality significantly hurts the expected profits of the retailer and supply chain, but it does not hurt the manufacturer's expected profit. In addition, for both cases, with and without QR, we indicate how a <b>minimum</b> <b>ordering</b> <b>quantity</b> (MOQ) measure can be imposed by the manufacturer on the retailer, so that the manufacturer can benefit (in terms of expected profit) from the retailer's bounded rationality behavior. We further prove that if the manufacturer sets the MOQ to be the same as the retailer's theoretical optimal <b>ordering</b> <b>quantity,</b> the manufacturer will enjoy a higher profit with 50 % chance, if the retailer is boundedly rational.

D.) : Bilkent University, Department of Industrial Engineering, İhsan Doğramacı Bilkent University, 2015. In this study, we consider di erent {{variations of the}} lot sizing problem encountered in many real life production, procurement and transportation systems. First, we consider the deterministic lot sizing problem with piecewise concave production cost functions. A piecewise concave function can represent quantity discounts, subcontracting, overloading, <b>minimum</b> <b>order</b> <b>quantities,</b> and capacities. Computational complexity of this problem was an open question in the literature. We develop a dynamic programming (DP) algorithm {{to solve the problem}} and show that the problem is polynomially solvable when number of breakpoints of the production cost function is xed and the breakpoints are time-invariant. We observe that the time complexity of our algorithm is as good as the complexity of existing algorithms in the literature for the special cases with capacities, <b>minimum</b> <b>order</b> <b>quantities,</b> and subcontracting. Our algorithm performs quite well for small and medium sized instances. For larger instances, we propose a DP based heuristic to nd a good quality solution in reasonable time. Next, we consider the stochastic lot sizing problem with controllable processing times where processing times can be reduced in return for extra compression cost. We assume that the compression cost function is a convex function in order to re ect the increasing marginal cost of larger reductions in processing times. We formulate the problem as a second-order cone mixed integer program, strengthen the formulation and solve it by a commercial solver. Moreover, we obtain some convex hull and computational complexity results. We conduct an extensive computational study to see the e ect of controllable processing times in solution quality and observe that even with small reductions in processing times, it is possible to obtain a less costly production plan. As a nal problem, we study the multistage stochastic lot sizing problem with nervousness considerations and controllable processing times. System nervousness {{is one of the main}} problems of dynamic solution strategies developed for stochastic lot sizing problems. We formulate the problem so that the nervousness of the system is restricted by some additional constraints and parameters. Mixing and continuous mixing set structures are observed as relaxations of our formulation. We develop valid inequalities for the problem based on these structures and computationally test these inequalities. by Esra Koca. Ph. D...|$|R
40|$|Traditionally, in {{the fashion}} industry, {{purchasing}} decisions for retailers are made based on {{various factors such as}} budget, profit target, and interest rate. Since the market demand is highly volatile, risk is inherently present and it is critically important to incorporate risk consideration into the decision making framework. Motivated by the observed industrial practice, we explore via a mean-variance approach the multi-period risk minimization inventory models for fashion product purchasing. We first construct a basic multi-period risk optimization model for the fashion retailer and illustrate how its optimal solution can be determined by solving a simpler problem. Then, we analytically find that the optimal <b>ordering</b> <b>quantity</b> is increasing in the expected profit target, decreasing in the number of periods of the season, and increasing in the market interest rate. After that, we propose and solve several extended models which consider realistic and timely industrial measures such as <b>minimum</b> <b>ordering</b> <b>quantity,</b> carbon emission tax, and carbon quota. We analytically derive the necessary and sufficient condition(s) for the existence of the optimal solution for each model and show how the purchasing budget, the profit target, and the market interest rate affect the optimal solution. Finally, we investigate the supply chain coordination challenge and analytically illustrate how an upstream manufacturer can offer implementable supply contracts to optimize the supply chain.

40|$|In a {{flexible}} supply chain buyers and suppliers {{are willing to}} accommodate the uncertainties and variations in each other's businesses. In many instances the buyer may prefer to use supply flexibility, {{as opposed to an}} inventory holding strategy, to counter demand uncertainty. We consider the case where the buyer releases a fixed period replenishment order to the supplier under a supply contract defined by three parameters: (i) supply price per unit (ii) <b>minimum</b> <b>order</b> <b>quantity</b> and (iii) order quantity reduction penalty. Following a demand drop the buyer therefore has two flexibility options in the order cycle: (i) to place an order less than the supplier specified <b>minimum</b> <b>order</b> <b>quantity</b> and pay the associated penalty, or (ii) place no order and lose the sales for the current period. There is no penalty for not placing an order. A key buyer decision then is Qlost, the order or replenishment quantity level below which no order is placed and the sales are lost. A model for deriving the expected supply and lost sales cost as a function of Qlost is presented, and it is shown that the optimal value of Qlost is the inflexion point of the lost sales cost and the quantity penalty. The model is then used to select the supplier that minimizes the procurement plus lost sales costs from a given set of supply bids and a known expected customer demand behavior. Finally, the buyer also has the option to make capital investments in the supplier so as to reduce the <b>minimum</b> <b>order</b> <b>quantity</b> and hence reduce the projected supply costs.

30|$|Dynamics in the SC {{can arise}} from order oscillations, {{seasonality}} or <b>minimum</b> <b>order</b> <b>quantities</b> and {{may result in}} a bullwhip effect [50, 85]. Ensuring product availability at product launch can also create internal dynamics within an SC, especially if a significant proportion of demand is expected at or shortly after product launch and thus needs to be pre-produced and distributed thereby maintaining a short time to market [41]. This phenomenon is known as pipeline filling, which is defined as the production and distribution of a product prior to product launch in order to ensure sufficient product availability across all stocking points at the launch date, i. e., at a time when product demand is fostered by strong marketing campaigns [72]. During pipeline filling activities, all stocking points are filled with a major portion of the expected annual demand before the product is actually launched in the marketplace. In this early phase of the PLC, production capacity demand strongly differs from market demands of finished products. As a result, the capacity requirements or inventory levels during the more static maturity phase of the PLC can be up to 60  % lower than during the highly dynamic product launch phase (see Fig.  1).|$|R

40|$|The Big Issue is a not-for-profit {{organisation}} {{that gives}} homeless people {{the opportunity to}} reclaim ownership over their lives by selling a street magazine. The vendors must purchase the magazine from the Big Issue office before making sales, and may do so multiple times each day. The vendors hence face the economic {{problem of how to}} construct an order plan given multiple, costly opportunities to replenish. This paper solves the problem theoretically and conducts an experiment with actual Big Issue vendors which tests how their ordering behaviour departs from the optimal solution. The experiment reveals various types of orderers exist, and that some of these systematically perform worse than others. The results also suggest that ordering decisions are heavily influenced by an anchoring heuristic. The experiment ultimately aims to test the effectiveness of a policy recommendation in improving ordering behaviour by setting <b>minimum</b> <b>order</b> <b>quantities</b> and offering vendors a refund for unsold magazines. The effect of the policy is different for each behavioural grouping of vendors. Some vendors demonstrate improved behaviour, while others do not.

The {{purpose of this study was}} to suggest aspects to incorporate in the purchasing strategywith the objective to consider a total cost perspective of the supply chain. This was donethrough conducting an empirical case study at a Swedish middle sized retail company, bycollecting and analyzing both qualitative and quantitative data through interviews, meetingsand internal databases. Challenges that prohibit the case company to apply a total costperspective were identified in the purchasing process and a total cost model was built tovisualize how these affect total costs.

30|$|In the following, {{production}} yield is {{denoted by}} Y(Q) where Q is the production input {{chosen by the}} supplier. The quantity delivered to the buyer is the <b>minimum</b> of <b>order</b> <b>quantity</b> and production output. Hence, the supplier faces {{the risk of losing}} sales in case of too low production yield. However, it is a reasonable assumption that, given a simple wholesale price contract, the supplier is not further penalized (in addition to losing potential revenue) if end-customer demand cannot be satisfied due to under-delivery. In typical business transactions the supplying side is usually measured in terms of its ability to deliver to the buyer and not to the end customer. As the mechanism to satisfy end-customer demand is not in the control of the supplier, she cannot be held responsible for potential sales losses. However, both actors face the risk of lost sales because under-delivery by the supplier can cause unsatisfied demand at the buyer as stated above. Consequently, both parties may have incentives to inflate demand (from the buyer’s perspective) or <b>order</b> <b>quantity</b> (from the supplier’s perspective) to account for the yield risk and avoid lost sales. In case production output is larger than <b>order</b> <b>quantity,</b> excess units are worthless and cannot generate any revenue even though they incurred production cost.

The plastic tags are differentiated by colour and print pattern. As part of our print management service we are always looking at ways to drive costs out of the material and print processes for our clients. In this case we identified two steps to be taken. Firstly, the tags have to be visible and clearly identified but their exact size is not too important. In-bound bulk material sheet sizes are 650 mm by 1100 mm these are cut into smaller sheets of 367 mm x 325 mm before they are printed. After printing, the sheets were being cut into 8 tags. By rotating the smaller sheets and adjusting the tag size slightly, we managed to produce 10 tags from the single sheet. The tags aren't significantly different but produced 20 % cost savings! Second {{we looked at the}} tags themselves. For some time the tags had been produced by printing various patterns onto coloured plastics. The downside to this was that lead times and <b>minimum</b> <b>order</b> <b>quantities</b> for different colours could be considerable. For very small runs, the production costs and potential for wastage were very high. Contrac's Print Consultant started a lengthy dialogue with the material supplier and the Print Production Manager. We concluded that we could print onto a translucent (transparent) plastic [...] which we buy in bulk. By printing onto one side only, the colours and pattern then show through. This meant that we could supply new tag designs in any number of colours, really quickly and with a further 18 % cost saving.

Due to recent reports of country-level shortages of BPG, an evaluation was undertaken to quantify countries that have experienced shortages in the past 2 years and to describe factors contributing to these shortages. Country-level data about BPG shortages were collected using 3 survey approaches. First, a survey designed by the WHO Department of Reproductive Health and Research was distributed to 41 countries and territories in the Americas and 41 more in Africa. Second, WHO conducted an email survey of 28 US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention country directors. An additional 13 countries were in contact with WHO for related congenital syphilis prevention activities and also reported on BPG shortages. Third, the Clinton Health Access Initiative (CHAI) collected data from 14 countries (where it has active operations) to understand the extent of stock-outs, in-country purchasing, usage behavior, and breadth of available purchasing options to identify stock-outs worldwide. CHAI also conducted in-person interviews in the same 14 countries to understand the extent of stock-outs, in-country purchasing and usage behavior, and available purchasing options. CHAI also completed a desk review of 10 additional high-income countries, which were also included. BPG shortages were attributable to shortfalls in supply, demand, and procurement in the countries assessed. This assessment {{should not be considered}} globally representative as countries not surveyed may also have experienced BPG shortages. Country contacts may not have been aware of BPG shortages when surveyed or may have underreported medication substitutions due to desirability bias. Funding for the purchase of BPG by countries was not evaluated. In all, 114 countries and territories were approached to provide information on BPG shortages occurring during 2014 - 2016. Of unique countries and territories, 95 (83 %) responded or had information evaluable from public records. Of these 95 countries and territories, 39 (41 %) reported a BPG shortage, and 56 (59 %) reported no BPG shortage; 10 (12 %) countries with and without BPG shortages reported use of antibiotic alternatives to BPG for treatment of maternal syphilis. Market exits, inflexible production cycles, and <b>minimum</b> <b>order</b> <b>quantities</b> affect BPG supply. On the demand side, inaccurate forecasts and sole sourcing lead to under-procurement. Clinicians may also incorrectly prescribe BPG substitutes due to misperceptions of quality or of the likelihood of adverse outcomes. Targets for improvement include drug forecasting and procurement, and addressing provider reluctance to use BPG. Opportunities to improve global supply, demand, and use of BPG should be prioritized alongside congenital syphilis elimination efforts...|$|R
