5|$|Elk live 20 {{years or}} more in captivity but average 10 to 13 years in the wild. In some {{subspecies}} that suffer less predation, they <b>may</b> <b>live</b> an average of 15 years in the wild.|$|E
5|$|Few wild {{individuals}} have a lifespan of over a year, though captive individuals <b>may</b> <b>live</b> for several years. One captive male lived seven years, four months.|$|E

5|$|There {{is little}} {{information}} available concerning the lifespan of wild black mambas, but the longest surviving captive example had a recorded lifespan of 11 years. It {{is possible that}} wild black mambas <b>may</b> <b>live</b> significantly longer than this.|$|E
5|$|As in {{closely related}} insect {{groups in the}} {{superorder}} Dictyoptera, mantises go through three life stages: egg, nymph, and adult (mantises are among the hemimetabolous insects). For smaller species, the eggs may hatch in 3–4 weeks as opposed to 4–6 weeks for larger species. The nymphs may be colored differently from the adult, and the early stages are often mimics of ants. A mantis nymph grows bigger as it molts its exoskeleton. Molting can happen five to 10 times before the adult stage is reached, depending on the species. After the final molt, most species have wings, though some species remain wingless or brachypterous ("short-winged"), particularly in the female sex. The lifespan of a mantis depends on the species; smaller ones <b>may</b> <b>live</b> 4–8 weeks, while larger species <b>may</b> <b>live</b> 4–6 months.|$|E
5|$|Capybaras {{have adapted}} {{well to the}} {{urbanization}} in South America. They {{can be found in}} many areas in zoos and parks, and <b>may</b> <b>live</b> for 12 years in captivity. Capybaras are gentle and usually allow humans to pet and hand-feed them, but physical contact is normally discouraged, as their ticks can be vectors to Rocky Mountain spotted fever.|$|E

Residents are zoned to Atlanta Public Schools. Residents are zoned to Centennial Place Elementary, Inman Middle School, and Grady High School.|$|E
5|$|The Goathouse Refuge {{differs from}} many other shelters in that all cats are welcome, and none {{are subject to}} {{euthanasia}} unless past all hope of recovery. Neither disposition, age, nor illness affect whether a cat will be accepted {{to stay at the}} Refuge. Adoption is the ultimate goal, but unadoptable cats <b>may</b> <b>live</b> out their lives on the property as well.|$|E
5|$|Feral {{cats are}} {{domestic}} cats that {{were born in}} or have reverted to a wild state. They are unfamiliar with and wary of humans and roam freely in urban and rural areas. The numbers of feral cats is not known, but estimates of the US feral population range from 25 to 60million. Feral cats <b>may</b> <b>live</b> alone, but most are found in large colonies, which occupy a specific territory and are usually associated with a source of food. Famous feral cat colonies are found in Rome around the Colosseum and Forum Romanum, with cats {{at some of these}} sites being fed and given medical attention by volunteers.|$|E

25|$|In 1926 Concordia Seminary {{moved from}} {{southern}} St. Louis on Jefferson Avenue into a newly constructed facility west of St. Louis in the suburb of Clayton. The Maier family {{moved into a}} house built on the Clayton campus, where <b>Maier</b> <b>lived</b> {{for the rest of}} his life.|$|R
5|$|Koalas <b>may</b> <b>live</b> from 13 to 18 {{years in}} the wild. While female koalas usually live this long, males may die sooner because of their more {{hazardous}} lives. Koalas usually survive falls from trees and immediately climb back up, but injuries and deaths from falls do occur, particularly in inexperienced young and fighting males. Around six years of age, the koala's chewing teeth begin to wear down and their chewing efficiency decreases. Eventually, the cusps disappear completely and the animal will die of starvation.|$|E
5|$|Octopuses have a {{relatively}} short life expectancy; some species live {{for as little as}} six months. The giant Pacific octopus, one of the two largest species of octopus, <b>may</b> <b>live</b> for as much as five years. Octopus lifespan is limited by reproduction: males can live for only a few months after mating, and females die shortly after their eggs hatch. Octopus reproductive organs mature due to the hormonal influence of the optic gland but result in the inactivation of their digestive glands, typically causing the octopus to eventually die from starvation. Experimental removal of both optic glands after spawning was found to result in the cessation of broodiness, the resumption of feeding, increased growth, and greatly extended lifespans.|$|E
5|$|Red foxes may kill small mustelids like weasels, stone martens, pine martens, stoats, kolonoks, polecats {{and young}} sables. Eurasian badgers <b>may</b> <b>live</b> {{alongside}} red foxes in isolated sections of large burrows. It {{is possible that}} the two species tolerate each other out of mutualism; foxes provide badgers with food scraps, while badgers maintain the shared burrow's cleanliness. However, cases are known of badgers driving vixens from their dens and destroying their litters without eating them. Wolverines may kill red foxes, often while the latter are sleeping or near carrion. Foxes in turn may kill unattended young wolverines.|$|E

50|$|The road is {{believed}} to have taken its name from Sir Algernon <b>May,</b> who <b>lived</b> nearby until 1693 or after Robert <b>May</b> who <b>lived</b> there in 1683. 'Moys Hill' is marked on Rocque's 1745 map, 'Maize Hill' on Greenwood's 1827 map, and 'Maze Hill' on Bacon's map of 1888.|$|R
50|$|The {{song was}} also {{recorded}} by The Searchers and by Hughie Jones of The Spinners (Jones later {{claimed that the}} real Maggie <b>May</b> <b>lived</b> in Duke Street and died in 1952). It was also recorded in several albums of sea shanties, by Cyril Tawney, Bob Roberts and others.|$|R
5|$|That day we saw horror, but we {{also saw}} quiet acts of courage. We saw this courage in a teacher named Liviu Librescu. With the gunman set to enter his class, this brave {{professor}} blocked the door with his body while his students fled to safety. On the Day of Remembrance, this Holocaust survivor gave his own life so that others <b>may</b> <b>live.</b> And this morning we honor his memory and we take strength from his example.|$|E
5|$|The {{house is}} co-ed and {{currently}} has {{a capacity of}} 191 students. Residents of Davison, which houses students of all grades, <b>may</b> <b>live</b> in either single rooms, one-room doubles, or three-room triples with bathrooms being shared by all members of a hall. The dorm has a kitchen, a parlor abutting the quad, and, as of 2011, its basement was a frequent practice space for student bands. In a 2005 guide to the school published by College Prowler, Davison was {{named one of the}} three best dorms at Vassar, along with Main and Jewett.|$|E
5|$|The third villain is Riccardo, who wields a flintlock pistol. For the {{majority}} of the game, Riccardo keeps his face hidden under a hood. Upon revealing himself however, Fiona is shocked to see her dead father's face. Riccardo reveals that he and her father, Ugo, are clones. He murdered Ugo in the car accident as revenge for leaving the castle and marrying Fiona's mother. He plans to use Fiona (by means of her womb and use of her Azoth) to bring about his own rebirth, so that he <b>may</b> <b>live</b> forever. As they fight atop a water tower, Hewie rescues Fiona by attacking Riccardo, causing him to fall from the summit.|$|E
5000|$|Perez ben Elijah of Corbeil (died 1295) was a French tosafist, {{son of the}} Talmudist Elijah of Tours. In Talmudical {{literature}} he is {{designated by}} the abbreviations RaP (= Rabbi Perez), RaPaSh (= Rabbi Perez, <b>may</b> he <b>live),</b> and MaHaRPaSh (= our master Rabbi Perez, <b>may</b> he <b>live).</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>May</b> <b>lived</b> in Detroit, {{where he}} taught poetry in public schools. He {{received}} an MFA from Warren Wilson College. May has {{taught at the}} Vermont College of Fine Arts, and is currently {{a fellow at the}} Kenyon Review. May cites Vievee Francis, another poet from Detroit, as an influence and mentor.|$|R
5000|$|But {{in giving}} all her {{attention}} to acting, however, she neglected her home life. Fellow actress Barbara Harris recalls that <b>May</b> <b>lived</b> in a cellar with only one piece of furniture, a ping-pong table. [...] "She wore basic beatnik black and, like her film characters, was a brilliant disheveled klutz." ...|$|R
5|$|Americans' mistrust and {{dislike of}} lawyers was a {{frequent}} topic of dissection in social problem films such Lawyer Man (1933), State's Attorney, and The Mouthpiece (1932). In films such as Paid (1930), the legal system turns innocent characters into criminals. The life of Joan Crawford's character is ruined and her romantic interest is executed so that she <b>may</b> <b>live</b> free, although she is innocent of the crime for which the district attorney wants to convict her. Religious hypocrisy was addressed in such films as The Miracle Woman (1931), starring Barbara Stanwyck and directed by Frank Capra. Stanwyck also portrayed a nurse and initially reluctant heroine who manages to save, via unorthodox means, two young children in danger from nefarious characters (including Clark Gable as a malevolent chauffeur) in Night Nurse (1931).|$|E
5|$|Animals {{can be kept}} {{extensively}} or intensively. Extensive systems involve animals roaming at will, {{or under}} the supervision of a herdsman, often for their protection from predators. Ranching in the Western United States involves large herds of cattle grazing widely over public and private lands. Similar cattle stations are found in South America, Australia and other places with large areas of land and low rainfall. Similar ranching systems have been used for sheep, deer, ostrich, emu, llama and alpaca. In the uplands of the United Kingdom, sheep are turned out on the fells in spring and graze the abundant mountain grasses untended, being brought to lower altitudes late in the year, with supplementary feeding being provided in winter. In rural locations, pigs and poultry can obtain much of their nutrition from scavenging, and in African communities, hens <b>may</b> <b>live</b> for months without being fed, and still produce one or two eggs a week.|$|E
5|$|Bees may be solitary or <b>may</b> <b>live</b> {{in various}} types of communities. Sociality, of several {{different}} types, appears to have evolved independently many times within the bees. The most advanced of these are species with eusocial colonies; these are characterised by having cooperative brood care and a division of labour into reproductive and non-reproductive adults, plus overlapping generations. This division of labour creates specialized groups within eusocial societies which are called castes. In some species, groups of cohabiting females may be sisters, {{and if there is}} a division of labour within the group, they are considered semisocial. The group is called eusocial if, in addition, the group consists of a mother (the queen) and her daughters (workers). When the castes are purely behavioural alternatives, with no morphological differentiation other than size, the system is considered primitively eusocial, as in many paper wasps; when the castes are morphologically discrete, the system is considered highly eusocial.|$|E
