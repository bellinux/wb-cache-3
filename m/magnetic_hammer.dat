40|$|A {{description}} is given of a device and process for making industrial diamonds. The device {{is composed of}} an exponential horn tapering from a large end to a small end, with a copper plate against the large end. A <b>magnetic</b> <b>hammer</b> abuts the copper plate. The copper plate and <b>magnetic</b> <b>hammer</b> function {{together to create a}} shock wave at the large end of the horn. As the wave propagates to the small end, the extreme pressure and temperature caused by the wave transforms the graphite, present in an anvil pocket at the small end, into diamonds...|$|E
5000|$|Heating {{the object}} above its Curie temperature, {{allowing}} it to cool in a <b>magnetic</b> field and <b>hammering</b> it as it cools. This {{is the most effective}} method and is similar to the industrial processes used to create permanent magnets.|$|R
40|$|The {{regolith}} in Australia can {{be described}} as everything from fresh rock to fresh air (Eggleton 2001). Recently, there have been many advances in gravity and <b>magnetic</b> acquisition methods (<b>Hammer</b> 1983, Doll et al. 2001, Dransfield et al. 2001, Hammond & Murphy 2003), and it may even be possible to use gravity and magnetic methods to explore within the regolith (Heath et al. 2004). With new techniques i...|$|R
