25|$|Over time, {{the muscle}} {{proteins}} denature in varying degree, {{with the exception}} of the collagen and elastin of connective tissue, and rigor mortis resolves. Because of these changes, the meat is tender and pliable when cooked just after death or after the resolution of rigor, but tough when cooked during rigor. As the muscle pigment myoglobin denatures, its iron oxidates, which may cause a brown discoloration near the surface of the meat. Ongoing proteolysis also contributes to conditioning. Hypoxanthine, a breakdown product of ATP, contributes to the meat's flavor and odor, as do other products of the decomposition of <b>muscle</b> <b>fat</b> and protein.|$|E
25|$|Metabolic {{syndrome}} – {{a poorly}} understood condition first called Syndrome X by Gerald Reaven. It is currently {{not clear whether}} the syndrome has a single, treatable cause, or is the result of body changes leading to type 2 diabetes. It is characterized by elevated blood pressure, dyslipidemia (disturbances in blood cholesterol forms and other blood lipids), and increased waist circumference (at least in populations in much of the developed world). The basic underlying cause may be the insulin resistance that precedes type 2 diabetes, which is a diminished capacity for insulin response in some tissues (e.g., <b>muscle,</b> <b>fat).</b> It is common for morbidities such as essential hypertension, obesity, type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular disease (CVD) to develop.|$|E
25|$|Synthetic anabolic–androgenic steroids (AAS), like {{nandrolone}} (as an ester like nandrolone decanoate or nandrolone phenylpropionate), are agonists of the {{androgen receptor}} (AR) similarly to testosterone {{but are not}} usually used in HRT for transgender men or for androgen replacement therapy (ART) in cisgender men. However, {{they can be used}} in place of testosterone with similar effects, and can have certain advantages like less or no local potentiation in so-called androgenic tissues that express 5α-reductase like the skin and hair follicles (which results in a reduced rate of skin and hair-related side effects like acne, oily skin, seborrhea, excessive body hair growth, and, in particular, male-pattern baldness), although this can also be disadvantageous in a few aspects of masculinization (specifically facial hair growth, body hair growth, and clitoral enlargement). Although many AAS are not potentiated in androgenic tissues, they have similar effects to testosterone in other tissues like bone, <b>muscle,</b> <b>fat,</b> and the voice box. Also, many AAS, like nandrolone esters, are aromatized into estrogens to a greatly reduced extent relative to testosterone or not at all, and for this reason, are associated with reduced or no estrogenic effects (e.g., gynecomastia). AAS that are 17α-alkylated like methyltestosterone, oxandrolone, and stanozolol are orally active but carry a high risk of liver damage, whereas AAS that are not 17α-alkylated, like nandrolone esters, must be administered by intramuscular injection (via which they act as long-lasting depots similarly to testosterone esters) but have no more risk of liver damage than does testosterone.|$|E

2500|$|The primary {{criteria}} for making sonomicrometer measurements {{is that the}} intervening space or material between the crystals must be capable of ultrasonic sound conduction in the frequency range of 100kHz to at least several MHz. [...] This typically means that the crystals must operate in or on a medium composed of fluids, gels, soft solids and some hard solids, and this includes biological tissues (blood, <b>muscle,</b> <b>fat,</b> etc.).

2500|$|The BMI is {{an attempt}} to {{quantify}} the amount of tissue mass (<b>muscle,</b> <b>fat,</b> and bone) in an individual, and then categorize that person as underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obese based on that value. However, there is some debate about where on the BMI scale the dividing lines between categories should be placed. [...] Commonly accepted BMI ranges are underweight: under 18.5kg/m2, normal weight: 18.5 to 25, overweight: 25 to 30, obese: over 30. People of Asian descent have different associations between BMI, percentage of body fat, and health risks than those of European descent, with a higher risk of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease at BMIs lower than the WHO cut-off point for overweight, 25kg/m2, although the cutoff for observed risk varies among different Asian populations.|$|E
60|$|To leap up {{and turn}} {{was the work}} of an instant for the boar, and would have been the same for the man if he had not been {{partially}} stunned by the fall. As it was, the captain, who was nearest, proved equal to the emergency, for, using his javelin as a spear, he plunged it into the boar's side. But that side was tougher than he had expected. The spear was broken by a sharp twist as the animal turned on its new foe, who now stood disarmed and at its mercy. Bladud's ponderous sword, however, flashed in the air at that moment, and fell on the creature's neck with a force that would have made Hercules envious if he had been there. Deep into the brawn it cut, through <b>muscle,</b> <b>fat,</b> and spine, almost slicing the head from the trunk, and putting a sudden stop to the last yell when it reached the windpipe. The boar rolled head over heels like a shot hare, almost overturning Bladud as it wrenched the sword from his hand, and swept the captain off his legs, carrying him along with it in a confusion of blood and bristles.|$|E
40|$|Formidability is an {{important}} cue to male intra-sexual competitiveness. While previous studies suggest strength can be accurately perceived from faces, little is known regarding the specific morphological cues {{that are used to}} form judgments of strength. Here, we used a set of three-dimensional color- and texture-standardized Caucasian faces to elucidate whether judgments of strength are based on shape cues linked to body physique. We collected facial scans of 50 men and 68 women together with measures of upper-body strength, height, weight and body composition. Upper-body strength was positively correlated with body mass index (BMI) and height. Deriving scores of the face shape associated with BMI and height, we found the face-morphological BMI score explained 27 % of the variance in perceived strength. As BMI conflates <b>muscle</b> and <b>fat</b> mass, we also related absolute <b>muscle</b> and <b>fat</b> mass, separately, to actual strength and found a positive association between strength and both <b>muscle</b> and <b>fat</b> mass. We attempted to derive scores capturing the face shape associated with <b>muscle</b> and <b>fat</b> mass, controlling for each other and height. We found that facial scores of male <b>muscle</b> and <b>fat</b> both positively related to perceived strength, explaining 37 % of the variance in this judgment. Our findings suggest that perceptions of strength from faces are based on facial cues to body physique. For both sexes, perceptions of strength seem to reflect overall body size or bulk, while for men additional variance was explained by separating facial cues to <b>muscle</b> and <b>fat</b> mass. The differentiation of facial shape associated with relative <b>muscle</b> and <b>fat</b> mass may have implications for the understanding of a variety of interpersonal judgments related to strength, such as dominance and leadership.

40|$|Ectopic {{adiposity}} {{has gained}} considerable attention {{because of its}} tight association with metabolic and cardiovascular health in persons {{with spinal cord injury}} (SCI). Ectopic adiposity is characterized by the storage of adipose tissue in non-subcutaneous sites. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has proven to be an effective tool in quantifying ectopic adiposity and provides the opportunity to measure different adipose depots including intermuscular adipose tissue (IMAT) and intramuscular adipose tissue (IntraMAT) or intramuscular fat (IMF). It is highly important to distinguish and clearly define these compartments, because controversy still exists on how to accurately quantify these adipose depots. Investigators have relied on separating <b>muscle</b> from <b>fat</b> pixels based on their characteristic signal intensities. A common technique is plotting a threshold histogram that clearly separates between <b>muscle</b> and <b>fat</b> peaks. The cut-offs to separate between <b>muscle</b> and <b>fat</b> peaks are still not clearly defined and different cut-offs have been identified. This review will outline and compare the Midpoint and Otsu techniques, two methods used to determine the threshold between <b>muscle</b> and <b>fat</b> pixels on T 1 weighted MRI. The process of water/fat segmentation using the Dixon method will also be outlined.
