5|$|In 1973, {{the film}} was shown on Soviet {{television}} in a 101-minute version that Tarkovsky did not authorize. Notable scenes that were cut from this version were the raid of the Tartars and the scene showing naked pagans. The epilogue showing details of Andrei Rublev's icons was {{in black and white}} as the Soviet Union had not yet fully transitioned to color TV. In 1987, when Andrei Rublev was once again shown on Soviet TV, the epilogue was once again in black and white, despite the Soviet Union having completely transitioned to color TV. Another difference from the original version of {{the film was}} the inclusion of a short explanatory note {{at the beginning of the}} film, detailing the life of Andrei Rublev and the historical background. When the film was released in the U.S. and other countries in 1973, the distributor Columbia Pictures cut it by an additional 20 minutes, making the film an incoherent <b>mess</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> eyes of many critics and leading to unfavorable reviews.|$|E

25|$|The narrator (Phil Rice) {{states that}} {{increased}} cultural diversity has necessitated the exposition of previously unwritten rules {{regarding the use}} of male restrooms. According to these rules, males should use restrooms as quickly as possible, maximize physical separation from each other when using urinals, flush urinals when they contain concentrated urine, avoid stalls with unflushed toilets, and avoid eye contact and communication with others. The film depicts a scenario in which excess communication leads to a <b>mess</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> restroom and thus deficient hygiene and homeostasis, the latter of which is in the lowest tier in Maslow's hierarchy of needs. As the scenario continues, the restroom occupants turn to violence, leading to police and biological hazard team involvement that closes the restroom. Forced to go elsewhere, other men repeat the scenario, eventually leading to complete societal breakdown.|$|E

He has seen many years of service and has survived several battles with the Covenant. Such is his influence that he dominates the Security Committee and can talk down most higher-ranking officers without fear of reprisal. Due to the competition between Ackerson and other departments, most notably Section Three and the SPARTAN-II project, Ackerson harbors a strong resentment toward his opponents and toward the Spartans in particular. He does eventually convince the top members of ONI to approve his SPARTAN-III Program. In , he attempts to sabotage the MJOLNIR Mark V testing process by using ordnance far above the established guidelines, including Lotus anti-tank mines, a full squad of s ordered to shoot to kill, automated gun turrets, and an airstrike. However, Cortana retaliates by forging a letter requesting a reassignment to the front lines as well as planting evidence of illicit activities in his bank records. In Halo: First Strike, it is revealed that Ackerson manages to weasel his way out of Cortana's <b>mess,</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> limited comic series [...] Ackerson falls into the hands of Covenant orbiting Mars and is slated to die before Ackerson tells his interrogator about a [...] "key" [...] to Earth.

[...] Blake French of AMC Filmcritic gave the film {{three and a half}} out of five, writing, [...] "Director Kevin Greutert hasn't helmed a lot of films in the past, but he did edit all of the previous Saws.

[...] Brad Miska of Bloody Disgusting gave the film seven out of ten and wrote [...] "Saw VI is faithful to the franchise and the twist/finale are 100% satisfying. Saw fans will walk out of the theater with their fists in the air with the feeling that they've reclaimed their beloved franchise." [...] Marc Savlov of Austin Chronicle gave the film one and half out of five stars, saying [...] "Enshrouding the whole gooey <b>mess</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> already blood-spattered surgical garb of the ongoing health care debate is a crafty move on the screenwriters' part, but once you get past that pseudo-ironic touch, this Saw is no more or less disturbing than any other in the series".|$|E
