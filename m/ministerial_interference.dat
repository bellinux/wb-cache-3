500|$|In retrospect, {{aviation}} author Tony Buttler {{considered the}} cancellation of the aircraft to be justified, noting the time consuming and expensive failures of attempts by other nations (such as Soviet/Russia's Yak-41 and West Germany's EWR VJ 101) at a supersonic VTOL aircraft. These aircraft all used a multiple engines configuration like the Mirage IIIV, and not the single vectored thrust turbofan of the likes of the BS.100 and Pegasus which went on to great success in the Harrier. Wood described the overall situation as: [...] "From start to finish the P.1154 programme was a story of delay, <b>ministerial</b> <b>interference</b> and indecision... the P.1150 would now be the ideal aircraft for the new generation through-deck cruisers" ...|$|E
50|$|The Swedish Prosecution Authority (Åklagarmyndigheten) is the {{principal}} agency in Sweden responsible for public prosecutions. It is a wholly independent organisation; not dependent on the courts or the police, and although it is organized under the Ministry of Justice it is not directed by it (any <b>ministerial</b> <b>interference</b> in cases is unconstitutional). It is headed by the Prosecutor-General of Sweden.|$|E
5000|$|Non-commercial state agencies, or {{government}} agencies are autonomously run state agencies assigned {{with a specific}} task, and typically free {{to carry out their}} responsibilities free of government or <b>ministerial</b> <b>interference.</b> State agencies are, for the most part, established through legislation by the Dail and overseen by the relevant committee of the Oireachtas. Examples of such state agencies include the Arts Council, Bord Iascaigh Mhara, Health Information and Quality Authority, Higher Education Authority and Transport Infrastructure Ireland ...|$|E
5000|$|The Carters were a {{political}} family. Thomas Carter, {{the first to}} live at Castlemartin which he acquired in 1729, was made Master of the Rolls in Ireland in 1731, which office he had continued to hold until 1754. He was a skilful and experienced parliamentarian and political organiser. A strong, if not often violent Whig, noted for his rudeness and his loathing of English <b>ministerial</b> <b>interference</b> in Irish affairs and his satirical lampooning of political opponents earned him the nickname [...] "Vicious Carter".|$|E
50|$|When a {{crime has}} been {{committed}} the authorities will investigate what has happened, {{this is known as}} the preliminary investigation and it will be led by a police officer or prosecutor. The Swedish police and the prosecution service are required to register and prosecute all offences of which they become aware. The prosecutors are lawyers employed by the Swedish Prosecution Authority, a wholly independent organisation not dependent on courts or the police, and not directed by the Ministry of Justice (any <b>ministerial</b> <b>interference</b> is in fact unconstitutional).|$|E

5000|$|He was {{appointed}} as the {{creative director of}} the exhibition at the Millennium Dome in Greenwich. After a series of disputes he resigned in 1998 citing <b>ministerial</b> <b>interference.</b> On his resignation {{he said of the}} dome that [...] "it {{could turn out to be}} crap", and accused government minister Peter Mandelson of [...] "running the project like a dictator". Mandelson said that [...] "he had not been a dictator but had been decisive and had got a grip on a project that was suffering from drift". Mandelson also said that Mr Bayleys other remarks did not merit a response. chief executive of the Dome Project, Jennie Page, gave evidence to a House of Commons Select Committee which included the issue of his resignation.|$|E
50|$|On October 19, 2006 it was {{revealed}} that Christina Jutterström, CEO of the public service broadcaster Sveriges Television, was also involved in the decision to file a police complaint against Maria Borelius, Tobias Billström and Cecilia Stegö Chilò since Jutterström also is {{chairman of the board of}} Radiotjänst i Kiruna. Prime Minister Fredrik Reinfeldt commented that he considered it special treatment of persons who are of interest with the media. Lars Lindberg, CEO of Radiotjänst, responded that this case is prejudicial since no one has previously admitted possession of a television retroactively. Eva-Lena Jansson, a Member of Parliament for the Social Democrats, reported the issue to the constitutional committee of the Riksdag since she wanted it to be determined if the Prime Minister's comments were to be considered <b>ministerial</b> <b>interference</b> in the affairs of a government agency (Ministerstyre). Former Minister for Justice Thomas Bodström has also stated that he considers the comment inappropriate.|$|E
40|$|Queensland's {{environmental}} {{regulatory agencies}} during the Premiership of Joh Bjelke-Petersen remain neglected by scholars, despite much {{literature on the}} State's high profile conservation conflicts in this era, such as Fraser Island. This article investigates {{the administration of the}} Clean Waters Act 1971 (Qld) by the Water Quality Council from 1970 to 1987. Using the Act as a case study, it seeks to examine different types of environmental governance factors and their impact on the effectiveness of legislation. It concludes that regulatory capture of individual Council members, resourcing constraints, <b>ministerial</b> <b>interference,</b> inspectorate discretion, a narrow conception of enforcement strategies, and limited public participation all conspired to reduce the effectiveness of both the Act and Council. While acknowledging the historical nature of the legislation, it is suggested that these problems remain causes for concern in maintaining robust environmental governance in the present...|$|E
40|$|Public {{inquiries}} convened by ministers into {{matters of}} public concern are major instruments of accountability within the administrative justice system. This {{article examines the}} tensions between the demand for public scrutiny of public inquiries and open justice {{on the one hand}} and conflicting pressures such as the protection of individual privacy and national security on the other. With reference to the Bristol Royal Infirmary, the Iraq Inquiry, the Undercover Policing and Azelle Rodney Inquiries and others, and drawing comparisons with the civil and criminal court systems, it looks at examples of inquiries with very different degrees of openness. The article analyses the key elements that comprise open justice in the public inquiry process and the methods by which restrictions are imposed on those elements. Openness is not always possible, however, the article argues that each time a concession is made against openness, there is a real risk that public confidence in the public inquiry process, and thereby the effectiveness of that process, is diminished. Finally, the article argues that the power of the minister to impose restrictions on public access, and perceptions of undue secrecy and <b>ministerial</b> <b>interference,</b> significantly exacerbates the undermining of public scrutiny and public trust in the independence and integrity of public inquiries...|$|E
