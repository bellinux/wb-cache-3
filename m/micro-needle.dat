50|$|Cytochalasin B, {{the name}} of which comes from the Greek cytos (cell) and {{chalasis}} (relaxation), is a cell-permeable mycotoxin. It was found that substoichimetric concentrations of cytochalasin B (CB) strongly inhibit network formation by actin filaments. Due to this, it is often used in cytological research. It inhibits cytoplasmic division by blocking the formation of contractile microfilaments. It inhibits cell movement and induces nuclear extrusion. Cytochalasin B shortens actin filaments by blocking monomer addition at the fast-growing end of polymers. Cytochalasin B inhibits glucose transport and platelet aggregation. It blocks adenosine-induced apoptotic body formation without affecting activation of endogenous ADP-ribosylation in leukemia HL-60 cells.It is also used in cloning through nuclear transfer. Here enucleated recipient cells are treated with cytochalasin B. Cytochalasin B makes the cytoplasm of the oocytes more fluid and {{makes it possible to}} aspirate the nuclear genome of the oocyte within a small vesicle of plasma membrane into a <b>micro-needle.</b> Thereby, the oocyte genome is removed from the oocyte, while preventing rupture of the plasma membrane.|$|E

The present study was undertaken to compare the improvement in facial atrophic acne scars by <b>micro-needling</b> alone and combination of <b>micro-needling</b> with autologous platelet rich plasma (PRP). A prospective, observer blinded, comparative interventional study was conducted on 50 patients of facial atrophic acne scars fulfilling inclusion criteria.

Three sessions on monthly interval were conducted and Final follow up was done at 4 th month.

This dissertation work {{is devoted to}} the development of <b>micro-needle</b> platforms that offer customized fabrication and new capabilities for enhanced cell analyses. The highest degree of geometrical flexibility is achieved with 3 D printed micro-needles, which enable optimizing the topographical stress environment for cells and cell populations of any size. A fabrication process for 3 D-printed micro-needles has been developed as well as a metal coating technique based on standard sputter deposition. This extends the functionalities of the platforms by electrical as well as magnetic features. The micro-needles have been tested on human colon cancer cells (HCT 116), showing a high degree of biocompatibility of the platform. Moreover, the capabilities of the 3 D-printed micro-needles have been explored for drug delivery via the well-established electroporation technique, by coating the micro-needles with gold. Antibodies and fluorescent dyes have been delivered to HCT 116 cells and human embryonic kidney cells with a very high transfection rate up to 90 %. In addition, the 3 D-printed electroporation platform enables delivery of molecules to suspended cells or adherent cells, with or without electroporation buffer solution, and at ultra-low voltages of 2 V. In order to provide a <b>micro-needle</b> platform that exploits existing methods for mass fabrication a custom designed template-based process has been developed.

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} the fabrication of plastic microneedle devices, their fabrication by injection molding, {{and analysis of}} the penetration mechanics. Injection molding is an economical mass-production technique that may encourage widespread adoption of microneedles for drug delivery. Four polymers were injection molded into hexagonal and square patterns of between 91 and 100 needles per array. The patterns and geometries were chosen to study the effect of needle spacing and array design on penetration force. Two needle spacings of approximately 1 mm and 1. 5 mm were employed for both patterns. Molded parts showed tip radii below 15 microns, heights of 600 to 750 microns, and an included angle of approximately 30 degrees. An economic analysis performed of the injection molded polymer devices showed that they can be manufactured for approximately $ 0. 10 - $ 0. 179 per part, which should be low enough to gain market acceptance. The added benefits of low pain perception, improved drug delivery for certain treatments, and the possibly of being recyclable make injection molded <b>micro-needle</b> devices a desirable alternative to silicon or metal microneedles. Penetration tests were performed with plastic <b>micro-needle</b> arrays and arrays of steel needles of the same spacings and patterns. Silicone rubber with mechanical properties similar to human skin was used as a skin simulant. The results showed that the micro-needles penetrated skin to depths between 120 and 185 microns depending on pattern, spacing, tip radius and needle length. This depth is sufficient to deliver drug therapies, but not so far that they stimulate the nerve endings present beyond 130 microns inside the dermis layer in human skin. An analytical model was developed to estimate the effects of various microneedle and skin characteristics on penetration force. The model was based on literature sources and derived from test results. The model accounted for coefficient of friction, tip radius, tip angle, and needle spacing, as well as the skin mimic's mechanical properties such as elastic modulus, mode I fracture toughness, and puncture fracture toughness.

40|$|The skin is {{the largest}} organ {{of the human body}} and it {{constitutes}} a great protective barrier against entry of harmful microbial species and foreign materials into the body. The barrier function {{is a result of the}} highly hydrophobic nature and compact structure of the outermost skin layer, which makes transdermal delivery of drugs difficult. The aim of this study was to investigate diffusion of hydrophilic fish gelatin peptides and alginate oligomers (G-blocks) into human skin, and to evaluate the effect of skin pretreatments, vehicles and the different characteristics of the test samples on transdermal diffusion. Fish gelatin was degraded by acid hydrolysis to produce peptides of varying molecular size, and the molecular weight distribution and molecular weight averages of the peptides were determined. Further, peptides were conjugated to fluorescent dyes, and together with fluorescently labeled G-block oligomers, they were utilized as traceable model drugs in the transdermal diffusion experiments. Full-scale skins, from healthy human adults after abdominal plastic surgery, were used and the transdermal diffusion experiments were performed in Franz-type diffusion cells. The surface of the skin tissues mounted in the diffusion cells was either untreated or treated with <b>micro-needles</b> or lasers, to disrupt the skin barrier. The model drugs were applied on the epidermal side of the skins in both a 60 % dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and a 10 % polyethylene glycol 200 (PEG 200) vehicle, and the vehicles were also separately applied on skins as control samples. After the transdermal diffusion experiments, imaging of the skin tissues were performed by confocal laser scanning microscopy. An incubation time of 22 hours was determined for the transdermal diffusion experiments and pretreatments were necessary for the model drugs to successfully diffuse into the skin. Pretreatments with <b>micro-needles</b> and laser resulted in enhanced diffusion of the test molecules into the skin tissues compared to diffusion into untreated skin. Laser treatment was found to have the most profound enhancing effect on transdermal diffusion, and enabled efficient diffusion both into and through the skin.
