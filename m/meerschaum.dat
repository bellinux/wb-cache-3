25|$|Some modern briar, and {{occasionally}} <b>meerschaum,</b> tobacco pipes sport stems made of Lucite.|$|E
2500|$|At the end {{of every}} episode, the MTM kitten [...] "Mimsie" [...] has an {{animated}} deerstalker's cap on its head and a <b>meerschaum</b> pipe in its mouth, a la Sherlock Holmes. The pipe falls from the kitten's mouth and bounces twice {{on the bottom of the}} screen as it meows.|$|E
60|$|His <b>meerschaum</b> is {{not such}} a good one as Jimmy's. Though Jimmy's boastfulness about his <b>meerschaum</b> was hard to bear, none of us ever denied the pipe's worth. The man through the wall has not a cherry-wood stem to his <b>meerschaum,</b> and {{consequently}} it is too light. A ring has been worn into the palm of his left hand, owing to his tapping the <b>meerschaum</b> there, and it is as marked as Jimmy's ring, for, though Jimmy tapped more strongly, the man through the wall has to tap oftener.|$|E
60|$|No pipe really ever rivalled the brier in my affections, though I {{can recall}} a mad month when I {{fell in love}} with two little <b>meerschaums,</b> which I christened Romulus and Remus. They lay {{together}} in one case in Regent Street, and it was with difficulty that I could pass the shop without going in. Often I took side streets to escape their glances, but at last I asked the price. It startled me, and I hurried home to the brier.|$|R
60|$|A curious {{collection}} of fellow-beings was before herj and {{at another time}} she would have found much to interest and amuse her. In one corner a newly imported German with an Orson-like head, thumb-ring, and the fragrance of many <b>meerschaums</b> still hovering about him, was hammering away upon some disputed point with a scientific Frenchman, whose national politeness was only equalled by his national volubility. A prominent statesman was talking with a fugitive slave; a young poet getting inspiration from the face and voice of a handsome girl who had {{earned the right to}} put M. D. to her name. An old philosopher was calming the ardor of several rampant radicals, and a famous singer was comforting the heart of an Italian exile by talking politics in his own melodious tongue.|$|R
60|$|Shelton {{had nothing}} better to do, for {{pleasant}} were his friend Halidome's well-appointed dinners. At seven, therefore, he went to Chester Square. His friend was in his study, reading Matthew Arnold {{by the light of}} an electric lamp. The walls of the room were hung with costly etchings, arranged with solid and unfailing taste; from the carving of the mantel-piece to the binding of the books, from the miraculously-coloured <b>meerschaums</b> to the chased fire-irons, everything displayed an unpretentious luxury, an order and a finish significant of life completely under rule of thumb. Everything had been collected. The collector rose as Shelton entered, a fine figure of a man, clean shaven,--with dark hair, a Roman nose, good eyes, and the rather weighty dignity of attitude which comes from the assurance that one is in the right.|$|R
60|$|He blinked twice, {{and put the}} <b>meerschaum</b> back {{between his}} lips.|$|E
60|$|He {{handed me}} a small sketch-book, and, while I turned over the leaves, busied himself in filling a short <b>meerschaum.</b>|$|E
60|$|Nicholas Treffry {{was coming}} from the house, holding the Times in one hand, and a huge <b>meerschaum</b> pipe in the other.|$|E
6000|$|... "In {{these times}} of peril and suffering, if the inquiry arises, How shall there be retrenchment? I answer, First and foremost, retrench things needless, doubtful, and {{positively}} hurtful, as rum, tobacco, {{and all the}} <b>meerschaums</b> of divers colors that do accompany the same. Second, retrench all eating not necessary to health and comfort. A French family would live in luxury on the leavings that are constantly coming from the tables of those who call themselves in middling circumstances. There are superstitions of the table {{that ought to be}} broken through. Why must you always have cake in your closet? why need you feel undone to entertain a guest with no cake on your tea-table? Do without it a year, and ask yourselves if you or your children, or any one else, have suffered materially in consequence.|$|R
60|$|The chamber {{in which}} the bewildered Robert now found himself was more luxurious, if less rich, than any which he had yet seen. Low settees of claret-coloured plush were {{scattered}} in orderly disorder over a mossy Eastern carpet. Deep lounges, reclining sofas, American rocking-chairs, all were to be had for the choosing. One {{end of the room}} was walled by glass, and appeared to open upon a luxuriant hot-house. At the further end a double line of gilt rails supported a profusion of the most recent magazines and periodicals. A rack at each side of the inlaid fireplace sustained a long line of the pipes of all places and nations--English cherrywoods, French briars, German china-bowls, carved <b>meerschaums,</b> scented cedar and myall-wood, with Eastern narghiles, Turkish chibooques, and two great golden-topped hookahs. To right and left were a series of small lockers, extending in a treble row for the whole length of the room, with the names of the various brands of tobacco scrolled in ivory work across them. Above were other larger tiers of polished oak, which held cigars and cigarettes.|$|R
60|$|The Quaker woman Elizabeth Hooton was an ancestress of mine. Your {{people were}} pretty severe with her you will confess that. But, poor thing! I believe they changed her {{opinions}} before she died, {{and took her}} into their fold; {{and so we have}} every reason to presume that when she died she went to the same place which your ancestors went to. It is a great pity, for she was a good woman. Roger Williams was an ancestor of mine. I don't really remember what your people did with him. But they banished him to Rhode Island, anyway. And then, I believe, recognizing that this was really carrying harshness to an unjustifiable extreme, they took pity on him and burned him. They were a hard lot! All those Salem witches were ancestors of mine! Your people made it tropical for them. Yes, they did; by pressure and the gallows they made such a clean deal with them that there hasn't been a witch and hardly a halter in our family from that day to this, and that is one hundred and eighty-nine years. The first slave brought into New England out of Africa by your progenitors was an ancestor of mine--for I am of a mixed breed, an infinitely shaded and exquisite Mongrel. I'm not one of your sham <b>meerschaums</b> that you can color in a week. No, my complexion is the patient art of eight generations. Well, in my own time, I had acquired a lot of my kin--by purchase, and swapping around, and one way and another--and was getting along very well. Then, with the inborn perversity of your lineage, you got up a war, and took them all away from me. And so, again am I bereft, again am I forlorn; no drop of my blood flows in the veins of any living being who is marketable.|$|R
6000|$|... 'AND ART THOU GONE, BELOVED GHOST? BEST OF FAMILIARS! NAY THEN, FAREWELL, MY DUCKLING ROAST, FAREWELL, FAREWELL, MY TEA AND TOAST, MY <b>MEERSCHAUM</b> AND CIGARS! ...|$|E
6000|$|There was a youth (you've heard before, [...] This woeful tale, may be), [...] Who {{bought a}} <b>meerschaum</b> pipe and swore [...] That color it would he! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Perfectly happy," [...] replied Lewis, {{taking a}} small case from his pocket, {{from which he}} {{extracted}} a neat little <b>meerschaum</b> pipe, and began to fill it with tobacco.|$|E
60|$|No;--there {{should be}} no going back now! So he {{declared}} to himself, endeavouring to prepare the suit of armour for his own wearing. Pau {{might be the best}} place,--or perhaps one of those little towns in Brittany. Dresden would not do, because there would be society at Dresden, and he must of course give up all ideas of society. He would have liked Rome; but Rome would be far too expensive, and then residents in Rome require to be absent three or four months every year. He and his wife and large family,--he had no doubt in life as to the large family,--would not be able to allow themselves any recreation such as that. He thought he had heard that the ordinary comforts of life were cheap in the west of Ireland,--or, if not cheap, unobtainable, which would be the same thing. Perhaps Castlebar might be a good locality for his nursery. There would be nothing to do at Castlebar,--no amusement whatever for such a one as himself, no fitting companion for Imogene. But then amusement for himself and companions for Imogene must of course be out of the question. He thought that perhaps he might turn his hand to a little useful gardening,--parsnips instead of roses,--while Imogene would be at work in the nursery. He would begin at once and buy two or three dozen pipes, because tobacco would be so much cheaper than cigars. He knew a shop at which were to be had some very pretty new-fashioned <b>meerschaums,</b> which, he had been told, smokers of pipes found to be excellent. But, whether it should be Pau or whether it should be Castlebar, whether it should be pipes or whether, in regard to economy, no tobacco at all, the question now was at any rate settled for him. He felt rather proud of his gallantry, as he took himself home to bed, declaring to himself that he would answer that last letter from Gertrude in a very few words and in a very decided tone.|$|R
6000|$|The {{windows of}} the apartment, of which there were two very small square ones, looked out upon the river, and, to some extent {{overhung}} it, so that a man of sanguine temperament might have enjoyed fishing from them, {{if he could have}} been content to catch live rats and dead cats. The prospect from these windows was, however, the best of them, being a wide reach of the noble river, crowded with its stately craft, and cut up by its ever-bustling steamers. But the most noteworthy part of this room, or [...] "cabin," [...] was the space between the two windows immediately over the chimney-piece, which the eccentric old woman had covered with a large, and, in some cases, inappropriate assortment of objects, by way of ornament, each article being cleaned and polished to the highest possible condition of which it was susceptible. A group of five photographs of children--three girls and two boys, looking amazed-- formed the centrepiece of the design; around these were five other photographs of three young ladies and two young gentlemen, looking conscious, but pleased. The spaces between these, and every available space around them, were occupied by pot-lids of various sizes, old and battered, but shining like little suns; small looking-glasses, also of various sizes, some square and others round; little strings of beads; heads of <b>meerschaums</b> that had been much used in former days; pin-cushions, shell-baskets, one or two horse-shoes, and iron-heels of boots; several flat irons belonging to doll's houses, with a couple of dolls, much the worse for wear, mounting guard over them; besides a host of other nick-nacks, for which it were impossible to find names or imagine uses. Everything--from the old woman's cap to the uncarpeted floor, and the little grate in which a little fire was making feeble efforts to warm a little tea-kettle with a defiant spout--was scrupulously neat, and fresh, and clean, very much the reverse of what one might have expected to find in connection with a poverty-stricken population, a dirty lane, a filthy court, a rickety stair, and a dark passage. Possibly the cause might have been found in a large and much-worn family Bible, which lay on a small table in company with a pair of tortoiseshell spectacles, at the old woman's elbow.|$|R
60|$|On {{saying good-bye}} to the detective, Captain Hampton, with much pressure, succeeded in {{inducing}} him to accept, as a remembrance, a handsome <b>meerschaum</b> {{that he had}} the evening before admired.|$|E
6000|$|He {{was clearly}} {{going to add}} to this, but it was lost; for the little fat man, taking the <b>meerschaum</b> with {{trembling}} fingers, and holding it within two inches of his chin, murmured: ...|$|E
6000|$|The cabman {{sat with}} his back turned upon the party, smoking a <b>meerschaum</b> pipe. Not a word of Tommy's eloquence had missed him, and he now faced {{suddenly}} about with these amazing words-- ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, yes," [...] said Dupin, drawlingly, {{between the}} whiffs of his <b>meerschaum,</b> [...] "I really--think, G--, {{you have not}} exerted yourself--to the utmost in this matter. You might--do a little more, I think, eh?" ...|$|E
60|$|For several minutes, {{although}} he looked me {{full in the}} face, he said nothing. At length removing carefully his <b>meerschaum</b> from the right to the left corner of his mouth, he condescended to speak.|$|E
60|$|I {{have bought}} a <b>meerschaum</b> out of local sentiment, and am now very low and {{nervous about the}} bargain, having paid dearer than I should in England, and got a worse article, if I can form a judgment.|$|E
60|$|The {{large man}} drew out a red case, and {{extracted}} a great yellow <b>meerschaum,</b> out of which, a moment later, he was puffing thick wreaths of smoke. Harold had lit a cigar, {{and both the}} girls had cigarettes.|$|E
60|$|He looked quickly up. A tall figure loomed out of {{the shadows}} of the apartment, and {{presently}} resolved itself into the figure of a man with his hands in his pockets, and a huge <b>meerschaum</b> pipe in his mouth.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Then {{you will}} know more than I do. Sabina--light my <b>meerschaum,</b> there's a darling; it will taste the sweeter after your lips.' And Claude laid his {{delicate}} woman-like limbs upon the sofa, and looked the very picture of luxurious nonchalance.|$|E
60|$|Having uttered this truism, the hermit {{resumed his}} <b>meerschaum</b> and {{continued}} to gaze thoughtfully at the embers of the fire. He remained so long silent that Nigel began to despair, but thought he would try him once again on the same lines.|$|E
60|$|Now pewter imparts {{flavor to}} ale; a <b>Meerschaum</b> bowl, {{the same to}} the tobacco of Smyrna; and goggle green glasses are deemed {{indispensable}} to the bibbing of Hock. What then shall be said of a leathern goblet for water? Try it, ye mariners who list.|$|E
60|$|It was Higgs, Higgs {{without a}} doubt; Higgs wearing his {{battered}} sun-helmet and his dark spectacles; Higgs smoking his big <b>meerschaum</b> pipe, {{and engaged in}} making notes in a pocket-book as calmly as though he sat before a new object in the British Museum.|$|E
6000|$|... "Piff!" [...] from a cob-pipe (I {{always said}} that a Missouri <b>meerschaum</b> was the best smoking in the world), and, behold! Mark Twain had curled himself up in the big armchair, and I was smoking reverently, as befits one in the {{presence}} of his superior.|$|E
60|$|When papa left us, we drew {{round the}} fire, and Harry {{said the first}} thing to be done was to smoke the calumet of council; {{accordingly}} in a minute or two he was puffing clouds of smoke from an immense <b>meerschaum,</b> of which he was very proud.|$|E
60|$|When {{the meal}} was {{finished}} and our glasses had been filled with port, Higgs helped himself to water, lit the large <b>meerschaum</b> pipe he always smokes, and pushed round the tobacco-jar which had once served as a sepulchural urn for {{the heart of an}} old Egyptian.|$|E
60|$|What I chiefly dislike {{about the}} man through the wall is his {{treatment}} of his clay. A clay, I need scarcely say, has an entirely different tap from a <b>meerschaum,</b> but the man through the wall does not treat these two pipes {{as if they were}} on an equality. He ought to tap his clay on the palm of his hand, but he seldom does so, and I am strongly of opinion that when he does, it is only because he has forgotten {{that this is not the}} <b>meerschaum.</b> Were he to tap the clay on the walls or on the ribs of the fireplace he would smash it, so he taps it on a coal. About this there is something contemptible. I am not complaining because he has little affection for his clay. In face of all that has been said in honor of clays, and knowing that this statement will occasion an outcry against me, I admit that I never cared for clays myself. A rank tobacco is less rank through a church-warden, but to smoke the Arcadia through a clay is to incur my contempt, and even my resentment. But to disbelieve in clays is one thing and to treat them badly is another. If the man through the wall has decided, after reflection and experiment, that his clay is a mistake, I say let him smoke it no more; but so long as he does smoke it I would have it receive consideration from him. I very much question whether, if he reads his heart, he could learn from it that he loves his <b>meerschaum</b> more than his clay, yet because the <b>meerschaum</b> cost more he taps it on his palm. This is a serious charge to bring against any man, but I do not make it lightly.|$|E
60|$|The {{next morning}} Mr. Rooper came into Mrs. Himes's yard, and there beheld Asaph, {{in all the}} glory of his new clothes, sitting under the chestnut-tree smoking the Centennial <b>meerschaum</b> pipe. Mr. Rooper himself was dressed in his very best clothes, but he carried with him no pipe.|$|E
60|$|By {{this time}} dancing {{was going on}} furiously; therefore, {{as it would have}} been {{impossible}} to sleep, Disco refilled his pipe and amused himself by contemplating the intelligent countenance of Kambira, who sat smoking bang out of a huge native <b>meerschaum</b> {{on the other side of}} the fire.|$|E
60|$|<b>MEERSCHAUM,</b> n. (Literally, seafoam, and by many erroneously {{supposed}} {{to be made of}} it.) A fine white clay, which for convenience in coloring it brown is made into tobacco pipes and smoked by the workmen engaged in that industry. The purpose of coloring it has not been disclosed by the manufacturers.|$|E
