25|$|After Joan Crawford's third divorce, Gable and she {{resumed their}} affair and lived {{together}} for a brief time. Gable was acclaimed for his performance in The Hucksters (1947), a satire of postwar Madison Avenue corruption and immorality. A very public and brief romance with Paulette Goddard occurred after that. In 1949, Gable married Sylvia Ashley, a British model and actress who was previously married to Douglas Fairbanks. The relationship was profoundly unsuccessful; they divorced in 1952. Soon followed Never Let <b>Me</b> <b>Go</b> (1953), opposite Gene Tierney. Tierney was a favorite of Gable {{and he was very}} disappointed when she was replaced in Mogambo (because of her mental health problems) by Grace Kelly. Mogambo (1953), directed by John Ford, was a somewhat sanitized remake of his earlier Pre-Code film Red Dust, with Jean Harlow and Mary Astor, which had been a greater success. Gable's on-location affair with Grace Kelly (1929–1982), who was young enough to be his daughter, gradually ended after filming was completed.|$|E
