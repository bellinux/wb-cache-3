According to Kretz, [...] "It {{was just something}} to kind of symbolize more of our attitude right now.... We [...] definitely are in a really good place right now as a band and really want to spread some peace and love across the world as <b>much</b> <b>we</b> <b>can.</b> We're {{going to do it}} through music and the celebration of rock and roll." [...] The artwork on the deluxe edition released in Target stores added gold foil to the patterns.|$|E

[...] The European Union {{was in the midst of}} talks related to sending reinforcements. Despite the presence of UN peacekeepers approximately 250,000 people were displaced by the conflict, bringing the total displaced person count to 2 million. The forces were also stated to be ineffective in keeping civilians safe from the rebel and government forces. This was hoped to be improved by deploying reinforcements consisting of 3,000 peacekeepers.|$|E

In this year, Purcell also composed a march and passepied called Quick-step, which became so popular that Lord Wharton adapted the latter to the fatal verses of Lillibullero; and in or before January 1688, Purcell composed his anthem Blessed are they that fear the Lord by express command of the King. A few months later, he wrote the music for D'Urfey's play, The Fool's Preferment. In 1690, he composed the music for Betterton's adaptation of Fletcher and Massinger's Prophetess (afterwards called Dioclesian) and Dryden's Amphitryon. During the first ten years of his mastership, Purcell composed much- precisely how <b>much</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> only guess. In 1691, he wrote the music for what is sometimes considered his dramatic masterpiece, King Arthur, or The British Worthy [...] In 1692, he composed The Fairy-Queen (an adaptation of Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream), the score of which (his longest for theatre) was rediscovered in 1901 and published by the Purcell Society. The Indian Queen followed in 1695, in which year he also wrote songs for Dryden and Davenant's version of Shakespeare's The Tempest (recently, this has been disputed by music scholars), probably including [...] "Full fathom five" [...] and [...] "Come unto these yellow sands". The Indian Queen was adapted from a tragedy by Dryden and Sir Robert Howard. In these semi-operas (another term for {{which at the time}} was [...] "dramatic opera"), the main characters of the plays do not sing but speak their lines: the action moves in dialogue rather than recitative. The related songs are sung [...] "for" [...] them by singers, who have minor dramatic roles.|$|E

It saves a great trouble and expense, for {{any one of us}} can give the party, and the poorest can equal the most extravagant. People who are obliged to diet can partake of their own slops at home, and yet mingle with the gourmets without awkwardness or the necessity of apology. We are spared the spectacle, at least, of those who eat and drink too <b>much.</b> <b>We</b> <b>can</b> switch off a bore at once. We can retire when we are fatigued, without leaving a blank space before the others. And all this without saying anything of the higher spiritual and intellectual effect--freed from material grossness of appetite and show--which the dinner party thus attains.
