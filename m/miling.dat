5|$|The name Great Northern Highway was gazetted on 10 March 1944, under section10 of the Land Act, 1933–1939. However, {{the highway}} was mostly {{a series of}} tracks through remote {{pastoral}} areas, with the sealed road ending just past the Wheatbelt town of <b>Miling</b> in 1950. Driving was difficult and hazardous all year round. The road was very dusty in the dry season, and some sections of the road were effectively impassable sand, while other sections contained limestone outcrops that damaged tyres. During the wet season, when rivers flooded, sections of road were essentially bogs, or worse still, were completely washed away.|$|E
5|$|In late 2015 Main Roads {{completed}} a planning review for an upgrade {{of the highway}} between Muchea and Wubin. Known as Muchea to Wubin Stage 2 Upgrade, the project continues work undertaken on this section from 2000 to improve the road to National Highway standards. Several bypasses, realignments, and other improvements have been planned at or near Muchea, Bindoon, New Norcia, Walebing, <b>Miling,</b> Pithara, Dalwallinu, Nugadong, and Wubin. Sections near Bindi Bindi and Batty Bog, completed in 2015, {{were included in the}} review. The highest priority works are scheduled to be completed between 2016 and 2019. These include the New Norcia Bypass, Milling Straight section, Muchea North section (designed to link to the NorthLink WA project), and Milling Bypass. , designs are being finalised for the Walebing Curve, Dalwallinu Bypass, Nugadong, and Wubin Bypass section, while funding has not been confirmed for the Bindoon upgrades.|$|E
5|$|In late August 1977, {{an area of}} {{disturbed}} {{weather was}} noted south of Pohnpei. By September 1, a weak surface low accompanied by organized convection developed within the disturbance. Situated {{to the south of}} a Tropical Upper Tropospheric Trough, conditions were favorable for further organization and the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert for the system. Tracking steadily west-northwestward in response to a well-developed subtropical ridge extending from the International Dateline to China, the system was soon classified a tropical depression early on September 2. Hours later, a weather reconnaissance mission into the depression revealed winds of 75 km/h (45 mph), prompting the JTWC to designate the system as Tropical Storm Babe. Due to the cyclone's proximity to the Philippines, the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration also monitored the storm and assigned it with the local name <b>Miling.</b>|$|E

After running a solid 4:55.7 on her <b>miling</b> debut, she was selected for an international mile race in Rome on 16 May. Here she improved her personal best to 4:44.6, finishing second to a former mile world record holder, Paola Pigni of Italy.

2500|$|In the 16th year of Jianwu , Jiaozhi (Giao Chỉ) [...] women Zhēng Cè (Trưng Trắc) and Zhēng Èr (Trưng Nhị) rebelled and {{attacked}} the commandery capital. Zhēng Cè {{was the daughter}} of the sheriff of Mê Linh ( [...] ; <b>Miling)</b> County, and she married a man named Shi Suo (Thi Sách; 詩索) from ....(Chu Diên) [...] She was a ferocious warrior. Su Ding (蘇定), the grand administrator of Jiaozhi Commandery, curbed her with laws. Cè became angry and rebelled. [...] The barbarian towns of Jiuzhen (Cửu Chân), Rinan (Nhật Nam), and Hepu (Hợp Phố) Commanderies all joined her, and she captured sixty five cities and claimed to be queen. The governors of Jiaozhi Province and the commanderies could only defend themselves. Emperor Guangwu therefore ordered the Changsha, Hepu, and Jiaozhi Commanderies to prepare wagons and boats, to repair the roads and bridges, to open the mountain passes, and to save food supplies. In the 18th year 42, he sent Ma Yuan the General Fubo and Duan Zhi (段志) the General Lochuan to lead ten odd thousands of men from Changsha, Guiyang, Linling, and Cangwu Commanderies against them. [...] In the summer of the next year 43, Ma recaptured Jiaozhi and killed Zhēng Cè, Zhēng Èr, and others in battle, and the rest scattered. [...] He also attacked Du Yang (都陽), a rebel of the Jiuzhen Commandery, and Du surrendered and was moved, along with some 300 of his followers to Lingling Commandery. The border regions were thus pacified.|$|E
