40|$|This work {{discusses}} {{status of}} the geologic and economic potentials of minerals and industrial rocks in Jordan. The major mineral resources are presented in details and the paper is designed to cover the lack of published data in this field. Geologically, the structural framework of Jordan is controlled largely by Arabian Nubian Shield in the south, block—faulted areas in the east, upwarping in north and east, and Wadi Araba-Dead Sea Transform Fault in the western part. The geologic environments include Precambrian crystalline basement (Late Proterozoic) of Arabian Nubian Shield (ANS) that is composed of igneous and metamorphic rocks at south-western part. Paleozoic rocks at southern and southeastern part consist of clastic minerals which are dominated by sandstone, whereas Mesozoic sedimentary rocks are widespread throughout southwestern, northern to southeastern parts of the country. They mainly consist of major industrial rocks and minerals such as phosphate, oil shale, limestone, dolomite, chalk, <b>marble,</b> <b>gypsum,</b> diatomite and tripoli. Cenozoic Era is composed of sedimentary and volcanic rocks {{in different parts of}} Jordan. There are more than twenty nonmetallic minerals and four main metallic deposits within the various geologic environments. This paper summarizes their distribution, chemical and mineralogical characteristics, in addition to their production statistics. </p...|$|E

50|$|There {{are three}} type of Stones (rocks) {{indicative}} of the physical characteristics from its formative process. These three categories are: igneous or volcanic rocks (basalt, granic, etc.), sedimentary or deposit rocks (limestone, sandstone, arenite, etc.), and metamorphic rocks (<b>marble,</b> slate, <b>gypsum,</b> etc.). Igneous rocks are formed by the cooling and/or solidification of magma {{and the formation of}} a dense network of crystals—below the Earth's surface as intrusive rock or on the surface as effusive rock. Sedimentary rocks are formed by the deposition of the remains of other rock caused by the action of atmospheric influences. Metamorphic rocks are formed by the transformation of existing rock through the action of temperature and pressure, which cause profound physical and/or chemical changes.|$|R
40|$|Cracking and {{coalescence}} {{behavior has}} been studied experimentally with prismatic laboratory-molded <b>gypsum</b> and Carrara <b>marble</b> specimens containing two parallel pre-existing open flaws. This was done at both the macroscopic and the microscopic scales, {{and the results are}} presented in two separate papers. This paper (the first of two) summarizes the macroscopic experimental results and investigates the influence of the different flaw geometries and material, on the cracking processes. In the companion paper (also in this issue), most of the macroscopic deformation and cracking processes shown in this present paper will be related to the underlying microscopic changes. In the present study, a high speed video system was used, which allowed us to precisely observe the cracking mechanisms. Nine crack coalescence categories with different crack types and trajectories were identified. The flaw inclination angle (β), the ligament length (L), that is, intact rock length between the flaws, and the bridging angle (α), that is, the inclination of a line linking up the inner flaw tips, between two flaws, had different effects on the coalescence patterns. One of the pronounced differences observed between <b>marble</b> and <b>gypsum</b> during the compression loading test was the development of macroscopic white patches prior to the initiation of macroscopic cracks in marble, but not in gypsum. Comparing the cracking and coalescence behaviors in the two tested materials, tensile cracking generally occurred more often in <b>marble</b> than in <b>gypsum</b> for the same flaw pair geometries. © 2008 Springer-Verlag.

40|$|A {{directly}} coupled portable remote Raman instrument {{developed by}} the University of Hawaii has been shown here to identify several minerals, chemicals and organics {{from a distance of}} 10 m using a single laser pulse in a well illuminated background. Raman spectra, obtained during {{a very short period of}} time, of common minerals e. g., dolomite, calcite, <b>marble,</b> barite, <b>gypsum,</b> quarts, rutile, fluorapatite etc. clearly show Raman features which could be used as fingerprints for mineral identification. Raman features of organics such as benzene, cyclohexane, 2 -propanol, naphthalene, etc. and other chemicals containing various functional groups like oxides, silicates, sulphates, nitrates, phosphates and carbonates were also easily detected. Ability to measure Raman spectra with a single laser pulse would be promising for future space missions where power consumption is critical and a rapid survey of the minerals with moderate to high Raman cross section might be desirable for selecting rocks that would provide high scientific return or for acquiring rocks for sample return to the Earth...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} {{fracturing}} and coalescence behavior in prismatic laboratory molded <b>gypsum</b> and Carrara <b>marble</b> specimens, which consist of either {{one or two}} preexisting open flaws, under uniaxial compression. In previous experimental studies, the determination of crack types (shear/tensile) was mainly based on the identification of fractographical features on the crack surfaces. In the present study, a high speed video system was used, which allowed one to precisely observe the cracking mechanisms. Seven crack types, which were characterized by different nature (shear/tensile) and orientations were identified to initiate from the pre-existing flaws in <b>gypsum</b> and <b>marble</b> in the present experimental study. Nine crack coalescence categories with different crack types and trajectories were also identified. The flaw inclination angle (beta), the ligament length (L), i. e. intact rock length between the flaws, and the bridging angle (a), i. e. the inclination of a line linking up the inner flaw tips, between two flaws, have all shown to have different effects on the coalescence patterns. Comparing the fracturing and coalescence behaviors in the two tested materials, tensile fracturing generally occurs more often in <b>marble</b> than in <b>gypsum</b> for the same flaw pair geometries. One of the pronounced differences observed between <b>marble</b> and <b>gypsum</b> during the compression loading test was the development of macroscopic white patches prior to the initiation of macroscopic cracks in marble, but not in gypsum. With {{the use of the}} scanning electron microprobe (SEM) and the environmental scanning electron microprobe (ESEM) techniques, the development of white patches and their evolution into macroscopic tensile cracks in marble, and the initiation of hair-line tensile cracks and their evolution into macroscopic cracks in gypsum were studied and compared. (cont.) The SEM study identified that the white patches in marble were associated withnmicrocracking zones (process zones). The parallel ESEM study on gypsum showed that the extent of process zone development associated with macroscopic tensile cracking wasnless. The different extents of process zone development, related to the inherent material strength and textural properties, are hypothesized to be the key factors in leading to different macroscopic fracturing behavior in <b>gypsum</b> and <b>marble.</b> by Ngai Yuen Wong.

40|$|AbstractStucco {{samples of}} the 17 th century were {{collected}} from the Addolorata Chapel in San Pantalon's church, which represents an important example of the stucco forte technique in Venice. Stucco forte is usually made adding powdered lime and <b>marble</b> to the <b>gypsum</b> base mixture. However, the exact recipe remain in most cases still unknown as often related to the knowledge and experience of the artisans [1]. The aim of the present work is to characterize and study the chemical-physical composition, the working techniques and the conservation state of the stucco forte in Venice. The samples were subjected to optical and electrical microscopic observation (OM, SEM-EDX), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), thermogravimetric analysis (TG-DSC), and mercury intrusion porosimetry (MIP). Gypsum, and calcium carbonate were found as major components with presence of magnesium carbonate and traces of hydromagnesite. Magnesite and hydromagnesite do not develop within the normal carbonation processes suggesting that magnesium carbonate was intentionally employed for improving the material characteristics...|$|R
