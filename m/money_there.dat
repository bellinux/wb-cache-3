5|$|The {{administration}} of Mashonaland {{did not immediately}} prove profitable for the Company or its investors, {{partly because of the}} costly police force, which Rhodes dramatically downsized in 1891 to save <b>money.</b> <b>There</b> also existed the problem of land ownership; Britain recognised the Company's subsoil rights in Mashonaland, but not its possession of the land itself, and the Company therefore could not grant titles to land or accept rents and other payments from farmers.|$|E
5|$|After {{a year in}} San Diego, Washington {{was traded}} again. Levin decided to acquire Portland center Bill Walton even though Walton had missed the entire 1978–79 season due to broken bones in his foot. Since the Blazers and Clippers could not agree on compensation, the commissioner's office made the final decision, sending Washington, Kunnert and Randy Smith to Portland in {{exchange}} for the center. This became the second time he had been traded along with Kunnert. The center signed with Boston before the 1978–79 season even though Washington was on the team because the Celtics offered him the most <b>money.</b> <b>There</b> remained a mostly quiet discord between the two as Washington felt Kunnert never properly acknowledged his role in the fight.|$|E
5|$|During {{the early}} years of the show, the staff was forced by the Fox network into doing clip shows to save <b>money.</b> <b>There</b> was {{originally}} intense pressure on the producers of the show to create extra episodes in each season, and the plan was to make four clip shows per season to meet that limit. Writers and producers, however, felt that this many clip shows would alienate fans of the series. The Fox network's reasoning was that clip shows cost half of what a normal episode costs to produce, but they could sell syndication rights at full price.|$|E

25|$|The Second Bank of the United States {{was closed}} during Noble's first term, leaving the state without a bank to hold {{government}} deposits or to supply paper <b>money.</b> <b>There</b> {{had been no}} banks operating in Indiana for a decade, so with no alternative to the situation the General Assembly passed a bill to create the Bank of Indiana. Noble had not taken {{a position on the}} bill, but signed it into law. The bank eventually turned out to be very profitable {{and one of the most}} important acts of his time in office. Noble also oversaw the creation of plans to build Indiana's third statehouse in 1831. The building was completed in 1835, and he also oversaw the move of the government's offices.|$|E
25|$|Many {{role-playing}} games allow {{players to}} play as an evil character. Although robbing and murdering indiscriminately may {{make it easier to}} get <b>money,</b> <b>there</b> are usually consequences in that other characters will become uncooperative or even hostile towards the player. Thus, these games allow players to make moral choices, but force players to live with the consequences of their actions. Games often let the player control an entire party of characters. However, if winning is contingent upon the survival of a single character, then that character effectively becomes the player's avatar. An example of this would be in Baldur's Gate, where if the character created by the player dies, the game ends and a previous save needs to be loaded.|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} {{printing of}} the Authorized Version {{was published by}} Robert Barker, the King's Printer, in 1611 as a complete folio Bible. It was sold looseleaf for ten shillings, or bound for twelve. Robert Barker's father, Christopher, had, in 1589, been granted by Elizabeth I the title of royal Printer, with the perpetual Royal Privilege to print Bibles in England. Robert Barker invested very large sums in printing the new edition, and consequently ran into serious debt, such that he was compelled to sub-lease the privilege to two rival London printers, Bonham Norton and John Bill. It appears that it was initially intended that each printer would print {{a portion of the}} text, share printed sheets with the others, and split the proceeds. Bitter financial disputes broke out, as Barker accused Norton and Bill of concealing their profits, while Norton and Bill accused Barker of selling sheets properly due to them as partial Bibles for ready <b>money.</b> <b>There</b> followed decades of continual litigation, and consequent imprisonment for debt for members of the Barker and Norton printing dynasties, while each issued rival editions of the whole Bible. In 1629 the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge successfully managed to assert separate and prior royal licences for Bible printing, for their own university presses – and Cambridge University took the opportunity to print revised editions of the Authorized Version in 1629, and 1638. The editors of these editions included John Bois and John Ward from the original translators. This did not, however, impede the commercial rivalries of the London printers, especially as the Barker family refused to allow any other printers access to the authoritative manuscript of the Authorized Version.|$|E

Webster had gone to Britain in 1839, and he was accused by one Democratic newspaper of colluding with the British to spend $5,000,000 given to him to subvert American liberties.

500|$|Scenes at {{the movie}} theater were filmed in a {{recently}} closed theater in Dunbar–Southlands, British Columbia. The location featured the [...] "architectural and design characteristics of a small-town cinema situated within an appropriate neighbourhood". The movie that is being shown in the Ohio theatre which is attacked is Die Hard with a Vengeance, whose storyline of a mission by terrorists involving American banks is broadly mirrored in this episode's plot. The faux corpses were created by make-up artist Toby Lindala; when he {{brought them to the}} set, however, there was no room to store them, and so he kept them temporarily in the craft services room. A Canadian government money depository filled in for the First Sovereign Bank of Pennsylvania that is robbed in the episode. The production staff assembled more than 15,000dollar bills of various denominations—which valued somewhere near $40,000—for use during the scenes at said bank. Production initially had to stop due to the fact that, during the filming of the scene that involved the <b>money,</b> <b>there</b> was only one police guard on duty. Fearful that an actual armed robbery might have been attempted, back-up was called in and filming continued as planned.|$|E

In July 2009, it is revealed that Cane Ashby is not the son of Jill Abbott. Hendrickson compared their relationship, which ensued as a result of Chloe practically [...] "threatening him", to the psychological thriller film Fatal Attraction (1987); [...] "I've definitely channeled my inner Glenn Close at times. But I'm trying really hard not to make Chloe go down the crazy path. I don't think she's crazy. She just desperately wants to be loved," [...] she said. While Cane is drunk, Chloe sleeps with him and becomes pregnant. Hendrickson described Chloe's actions as [...] "definitely plotting" [...] but, in reference to Chloe's backstory, said it was [...] "not because of who he is. She just wanted him". Prior to the revelation that she is Kate Valentine, Chloe marries Cane, angering the Chancellors. According to the actress, Chloe's [...] "defense" [...] is, [...] "I came here to start fresh and I wanted to do it on my own. I didn't tell Cane because I was afraid he would think I was going after him for his <b>money.</b> <b>There</b> was no plotting." [...] Chloe disrupts the pairing of Cane and Lily Winters (Christel Khalil), creating a [...] "bitchy" [...] rivalry between the female characters. Ultimately, Chloe gives birth to a daughter named Cordelia [...] "Delia" [...] Abbott (Sophie Pollono). In a dramatic love rectangle storyline, it is revealed that Delia's father is actually Jill's son, Billy Abbott (Billy Miller); this revelation ends Chloe's manipulations of Cane, despite his excitement at the prospect of being a father.|$|E

500|$|In 1874, Grant's cabinet {{reached its}} lowest ebb {{in terms of}} public trust and {{qualified}} appointments. [...] After the presidential election of 1872, Grant reappointed all of his cabinet with a single exception. [...] Charges of corruption were rife, particularly from The Nation, a reliable journal that was going after many of Grant's cabinet members. Treasury Secretary George S. Boutwell had been elected to the U.S. Senate in the 1872 election and was replaced by Assistant Treasury Secretary William A. Richardson in 1873. Richardson's tenure as Treasury Secretary was very brief, as another scandal erupted. [...] The government had been known to hire private citizens and groups to collect taxes for the Internal Revenue Service. [...] This moiety contract system, although legal, led to abuse in the loosely run Treasury Department under Sec. Richardson. [...] John D. Sanborn was contracted by Sec. Richardson to collect certain taxes and excises that had been illegally withheld from the government; having received an exorbitant moiety of 50% on all tax collections. Treasury officials pressured Internal Revenue agents not to collect delinquent accounts so Sanborn could accumulate more. [...] Although the collections were legal, Sanborn reaped $213,000 in commissions on $420,000 taken in taxes. [...] A House investigation committee in 1874 revealed that Sanborn had split $156,000 of this with unnamed associates as [...] "expenses." [...] Although Richardson and Senator Benjamin Butler were suspected to have taken a share of the profit <b>money,</b> <b>there</b> was no paper trail to prove such transactions, and Sanborn refused to reveal with whom he split the profits. [...] While the House committee was investigating, Grant quietly appointed Richardson to the Court of Claims and replaced him with the avowed reformer Benjamin H. Bristow. On June 22, 1874 President Grant, in an effort of reform, signed a bill into law that abolished the moiety contract system.|$|E
