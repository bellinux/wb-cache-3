40|$|Along {{with the}} {{development}} of interferometric gravitational wave detector, we enter into an epoch of gravitational wave astronomy, which will open a brand new window for astrophysics to observe our universe. Almost all of the data analysis methods in gravitational wave detection are based on <b>matched</b> <b>filtering.</b> Gravitational wave detection is a typical example of weak signal detection, and this weak signal is buried in strong instrument noise. So it seems attractable if we can take advantage of stochastic resonance. But unfortunately, almost all of the stochastic resonance theory is based on Fourier transformation and has no relation to <b>matched</b> <b>filtering.</b> In this paper we try to relate stochastic resonance to <b>matched</b> <b>filtering.</b> Our results show that stochastic resonance can indeed be combined with <b>matched</b> <b>filtering</b> for both periodic and non-periodic input signal. This encouraging result will be the first step to apply stochastic resonance to <b>matched</b> <b>filtering</b> in gravitational wave detection.

40|$|<b>Matched</b> <b>filtering</b> can {{be applied}} to {{recorded}} signals for maximum detection sensitivity during online partial discharge (PD) measurements in medium-voltage cable circuits. PD waveform predictions are combined with a noise spectrum estimation to construct <b>matched</b> <b>filters.</b> The PD waveform is specific for each cable circuit under test and the predictions are based on online system identification measurements and a standard cable model. For some cable circuits, for instance with a ring-main-unit along the cable, the predicted waveforms only approximate the real waveforms due to signal distortion not accounted for in the model. This results in suboptimal detection sensitivity. This paper describes an automated procedure for updating the <b>matched</b> <b>filters</b> based on detected PD signals. The algorithm analyzes detected pulses to judge whether the current set of <b>matched</b> <b>filters</b> perform optimally. If not, the current set of <b>matched</b> <b>filters</b> is updated, increasing the PD detection sensitivity and potentially also the location accuracy. At the same time, recognition of recurring disturbances is improved and better rejection criteria can be defined. The method is tested on signals measured on live cable connections...|$|R
40|$|International Telemetering Conference Proceedings / May 18 - 20, 1965 / Sheraton Park Hotel, Washington DCIt {{is common}} {{knowledge}} that the <b>matched</b> <b>filters</b> for signals in white noise have impulse responses whose time duration is exactly {{as long as that}} of the input signal. Nothing can be gained by extending the response of the <b>matched</b> <b>filters</b> to longer than one bit unless (1) the signal source is coded, or (2) the noise spectrum is rising or at least is other than white-Gaussian-ergodic. This paper discusses means of improving bit error rates without coding the source. There are essentially two ways of extending the integration time of the <b>matched</b> <b>filters,</b> each of which offers an improvement in signal-to-noise ratio. The first way is to extend the response directly to more than one bit but constrain the filter to give zero or some small pre-assigned intersymbol crosstalk. The second way is to build <b>matched</b> <b>filters</b> for multiple bits. Both techniques can be used simultaneously; i. e., <b>matched</b> <b>filters</b> can be constructed for bit patterns, and the responses can be extended to longer than the baud to which the <b>filters</b> are <b>matched.</b> Once again this extension is done under the constrain of zero or little crosstalk. In this paper, the <b>matched</b> <b>filters</b> for several examples are expanded in a rapidly converging series, each term of which is identifiable with a known network. For the cases where the shape of the noise is not known analytically, an experimental technique is given for determining sufficient statistics of the noise so that the optimum <b>matched</b> <b>filters</b> can be designed...|$|R

2500|$|In {{the closed}} form solution, just presented, the {{compressed}} waveform has the standard sinc function response, because a rectangular shape was assumed for the amplitude of the pulse spectrum.

2500|$|Noise is also {{generated}} by external sources, most importantly the natural thermal radiation {{of the background}} surrounding the target of interest. In modern radar systems, the internal noise is typically about equal to or lower than the external noise. An exception is if the radar is aimed upwards at clear sky, where the scene is so [...] "cold" [...] that it generates very little thermal noise. The thermal noise is given by kB T B, where T is temperature, B is bandwidth (post <b>matched</b> <b>filter)</b> and kB is Boltzmann's constant. There is an appealing intuitive interpretation of this relationship in a radar. Matched filtering allows the entire energy received from a target to be compressed into a single bin (be it a range, Doppler, elevation, or azimuth bin). On the surface {{it would appear that}} then within a fixed interval of time one could obtain perfect, error free, detection. To do this one simply compresses all energy into an infinitesimal time slice. What limits this approach in the real world is that, while time is arbitrarily divisible, current is not. The quantum of electrical energy is an electron, and so the best one can do is match filter all energy into a single electron. Since the electron is moving at a certain temperature (Plank spectrum) this noise source cannot be further eroded. We see then that radar, like all macro-scale entities, is profoundly impacted by quantum theory.|$|E
