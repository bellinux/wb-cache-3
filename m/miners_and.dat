5|$|In {{response}} to the recall of the state militia, the mine owners closed the mines. Bowers arrested Calderwood, 18 other <b>miners,</b> <b>and</b> the mayor and town marshal of Altman (who had supported the miners). They were taken to Colorado Springs and quickly tried on several different charges, but found not guilty. Meanwhile, outbursts of violence, such as stone-throwing and fights between union <b>miners</b> <b>and</b> scabs, increased in frequency. Stores and warehouses were broken into, and guns and ammunition stolen.|$|E
5|$|A {{distinctive}} bird, the blue-faced honeyeater differs in coloration {{from the}} duller-plumaged friarbirds, <b>miners</b> <b>and</b> wattlebirds, {{and it is}} {{much larger than the}} similarly coloured Melithreptus honeyeaters. Subspecies albipennis with its white wing patch has been likened to a khaki-backed butcherbird in flight.|$|E

5|$|In September 1913, the United Mine Workers {{called a}} strike against coal-mining {{companies}} in Ludlow, Colorado.

50|$|The News began weekly {{publication}} in 1881 under {{the ownership of}} E. P. Chapman. A second newspaper, the Rat Portage Miner, started around 1891 under the ownership of a Mr. Earngey through the Rat Portage Miner Publishing Co. In 1901 it shifted to twice weekly publication — Tuesdays and Fridays. By 1903 they operated under one name, the Rat Portage <b>Miner</b> <b>and</b> News, and it became the Kenora <b>Miner</b> <b>and</b> News in 1906 when the town itself was renamed. The <b>Miner</b> <b>and</b> News switched to six-day {{publication in}} February 1952 {{to compete with the}} Daily Reminder, started in the 1930s.|$|R
5|$|The Chinese at Rock Springs {{were aware}} of the {{animosity}} and rising racial tension with white miners, but had not taken any precautions, as no prior events indicated there would be any race riots. Underlying the outbreak of violence were racism and resentment of the policies of the Union Pacific Coal Department. Until 1875, the mines in Rock Springs were worked by whites; in that year, a strike occurred, and the strikers were replaced with Chinese strikebreakers less than two weeks after the strike began. The company resumed mining with 50 white <b>miners</b> <b>and</b> 150 Chinese miners in its employ. As more Chinese arrived in Rock Springs, bitterness from the white miners increased. At the time of the massacre, there were about 150 white <b>miners</b> <b>and</b> 331 Chinese miners in Rock Springs.|$|E
5|$|The Rock Springs massacre, {{also known}} as the Rock Springs Riot, {{occurred}} on September 2, 1885, in the present-day United States city of Rock Springs in Sweetwater County, Wyoming. The riot, between Chinese immigrant <b>miners</b> <b>and</b> white immigrant miners, was the result of racial tensions and an ongoing labor dispute over the Union Pacific Coal Department's policy of paying Chinese miners lower wages than white miners. This policy caused the Chinese to be hired over the white miners, which further angered the white <b>miners</b> <b>and</b> contributed to the riot. When the rioting ended, at least 28 Chinese miners were dead and 15 were injured. Rioters burned 78 Chinese homes resulting in approximately US$150,000 in property damage ($ in present-day terms).|$|E

5|$|Humans have {{inhabited}} {{the area for}} several millennia, with the Sioux becoming dominant by the early 19th century. In the late 19th century, European-American settlement intensified after a gold rush in the Black Hills {{and the construction of}} railroads from the east. Encroaching <b>miners</b> <b>and</b> settlers triggered a number of Indian wars, ending with the Wounded Knee Massacre in 1890. Key events in the 20th century included the Dust Bowl and Great Depression, increased federal spending during the 1940s and 1950s for agriculture and defense, and an industrialization of agriculture that has reduced family farming.|$|E
5|$|In 1831 {{there were}} {{extensive}} riots in the Forest of Dean, led by Warren James. After {{the intervention of}} the military, the rioters were dispersed and order restored, but a range of complaints were levied about the enforcement of the local laws on <b>miners</b> <b>and</b> metal-workers. There had been attacks against St Briavels Castle by discontented locals before during the 1780s, but the degree of violence in this case was much greater. An act of Parliament followed, establishing a number of commissioners who investigated local practices and recent events at the Castle.|$|E
5|$|In April 1989, {{after the}} miners had worked 14 months without benefits, UMWA {{president}} Richard Trumka declared a strike against the Pittston Coal Company. Around 2,000 UMWA members {{who worked for}} Pittston {{walked out of the}} mines and reported to the picket line. Pittston responded to the strike by hiring replacement workers. To ensure that production would continue, Pittston also had help from the state police to escort the replacement <b>miners</b> <b>and</b> coal trucks across the picket line.|$|E

5|$|In {{contrast}} to its earlier place amongst the wealthy, during the 17th and 18th centuries, the pasty became popular with working people in Cornwall, where tin <b>miners</b> <b>and</b> others adopted it {{due to its}} unique shape, forming a complete meal that could be carried easily and eaten without cutlery. In a mine, the pasty's dense, folded pastry could stay warm for several hours, and if it did get cold, it could easily be warmed on a shovel over a candle.|$|E
5|$|Largely {{bypassed}} by {{the early}} non-native explorers, fur traders, and settlers because of its remote location, the region attracted newcomers in quantity when prospectors found gold near Jacksonville in the Rogue River valley in 1851. This {{led to the creation}} of Jackson County in 1852 and, after gold discoveries near Waldo in the Illinois River valley, the creation of Josephine County, named for the daughter of a gold miner. Even with an influx of <b>miners</b> <b>and</b> of settlers who farmed donation land claims, Josephine County's population was only 1,204 in 1870.|$|E

5|$|The California Gold Rush in {{the mid-19th}} century {{dramatically}} increased travel by European-Americans in the area, causing competition for resources between the regional Paiute and Miwok and the <b>miners</b> <b>and</b> hangers on.
