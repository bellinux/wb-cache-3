50|$|After two flights {{involving}} supersonic spin recovery, Kit {{was quick}} to neutralize the controls immediately upon motor <b>shutdown</b> <b>in</b> later <b>flights.</b> He had taped a string {{in front of the}} windshield to determine his rudder trim input. Kit was the first pilot to fly the X1-B aircraft <b>in</b> powered <b>flight,</b> and {{he said it was a}} much straighter flying rocket ship than the X-1A. The X-4 he flew was basically a flying wing type aircraft (no horizontal tail) and the X-5 was a variable sweep test platform.|$|R
25|$|A <b>manual</b> <b>shutdown</b> was {{initiated}} {{during the middle}} of a start-up operation. The cause was a high pressure alarm that was caused by the shutting of a turbine bypass valve. The reactor was at 12% of full power when the alarm occurred at 4:03am (local time) due to a pressure increase to 1,030 psi (7,100 kPa), exceeding the regulatory limit of 1,002 psi (6,910 kPa). The reactor was reduced to 0% power, which exceeded the 5% threshold that requires event reporting, and pressure dropped back under the regulatory limit at 4:25am. Later, at 8:49am the control blades were completely inserted, constituting a <b>manual</b> reactor <b>shutdown.</b> An inspection then confirmed that one of the 8 bypass valves had closed and that the valve had a bad driving fluid connection. The reactor had been starting up following its 25th regular inspection, which had begun on October 18, 2008.|$|R
50|$|The ejector seat {{also served}} as an escape {{mechanism}} {{in the event of}} a launch vehicle failure, which at this early phase of the space program was a common occurrence. If an accident occurred in the first 40 seconds after liftoff, the cosmonaut would simply eject from the spacecraft and parachute to Earth. From 40 to 150 seconds into launch, ground controllers could issue a <b>manual</b> <b>shutdown</b> command to the booster. When the launch vehicle fell to a low enough altitude, the cosmonaut would eject. Higher altitude failures after shroud jettison would involve detaching the entire spacecraft from the booster.|$|R
50|$|Unlike the US program, Russian rockets do not {{employ a}} true RSO {{destruct}} system. If a launch vehicle loses control, ground controllers may either issue a <b>manual</b> <b>shutdown</b> command or the onboard computer can perform it automatically. In this case, the rocket is simply allowed to impact the ground intact. Since Russia's launch sites are {{in remote areas}} far from significant populations, {{it has never been}} seen as necessary to include an RSO destruct system. During the Soviet era, expended rocket stages or debris from failed launches were thoroughly cleaned up, but since the collapse of the USSR, this practice has lapsed.|$|R

40|$|Abstract:The paper {{presents}} a failure analysis on a counterweight assembly installed on crank shaft which resulted <b>in</b> an in-flight <b>shutdown</b> of a piston aeroengine. The counterweight assembly failure includes counterweight block material loss and fractured washer {{which is the}} most crucial part for in-flight <b>shutdown</b> <b>in</b> this type of aeroengine. Macro observation, fractography analysis, metallograp-hy analysis and hardness test were conducted on the failed counterweight assembly. The result shows that failure mechanism of counterweight block and washer is fatigue. The washer failure is likely due to inappropriate heat treatment process and continuous impact <b>in</b> <b>flight</b> by slightly tilted roller. Count-erweight material loss is attributed to stress concentration, low structure strength and impact came from the tilted roller. Finally some safety suggestion on design and maintenance is given...|$|R
