This will only be possible if the protection laws are abolished or if their enforcement fails. The recovery of the buried treasure (trash?) will then mark the loss of greater (natural) bounty.

40|$|Abstract. The {{main purpose}} of this work is searching of the {{probable}} precursors of X-flare events using MDI data of full solar disk. To analyze this data we use the multifractal microcanonical formalism applying Choquet capacity as measure. We build the map of exponent so-called Holder exponents for every MDI fragment containing an active region. These values specify the sudden change in a picture contrast. In addition, we provide the same analyze for inverted image. After that we estimate the two first Betti numbers for both couple of MDI fragments and corresponding couple of <b>Holder</b> <b>maps.</b> The first one specify the number of image connectedness components and second one define the number of “holes ” of one polarity relatively another. We suppose that the Betti numbers variation {{may be used as}} a precursor of X-flare event. We analyze the four active regions and obtained the following result. For MDI data the Betti numbers variations of X-flare active region are very different from flare-quiet active region. Furthermore, the Betti numbers for <b>Holder</b> <b>maps</b> display the sudden change for 24 hours before the X-flare event...|$|R

We show that in both cases, the cost-sectional curvature is uniformly positive, and establish the geometrical properties so that the results of L 5 and MTW can apply: global smooth solutions exist for arbitrary smooth positive data and optimal <b>maps</b> are <b>Hölder</b> continuous under weak assumptions on the data.
