5|$|Dinheirosaurus is not {{extremely}} well known, {{and as a}} consequence, its phylogenetic position is not certain. In 2012 during a redescription of the taxon by Philip Mannion et al., it was recovered, in both cladograms, to be sister species to Supersaurus vivianae and together forming the most basal diplodocines. A 2012 cladogram, published by Mannion et al. and using a modified matrix of Whitlock (2011) found that Dinheirosaurus was <b>more</b> <b>primitive</b> than Torneria and more derived than Apatosaurus. However, a cladogram from 2014 found that their group was supported, but in fact <b>more</b> <b>primitive</b> than Apatosaurus, and therefore outside Diplodocinae.|$|E

5|$|A {{large number}} of insects live either part or the whole of their lives underwater. In many of the <b>more</b> <b>primitive</b> orders of insect, the {{immature}} stages are spent in an aquatic environment. Some groups of insects, like certain water beetles, have aquatic adults as well.|$|E
50|$|Geometry shader {{programs}} are executed after vertex shaders. They take as input a whole primitive, possibly with adjacency information. For example, when operating on triangles, the three vertices are the geometry shader's input. The shader can then emit zero or <b>more</b> <b>primitives,</b> which are rasterized and their fragments ultimately passed to a pixel shader.|$|R

5|$|<b>More</b> <b>primitive</b> {{relatives}} such as Noasaurus and Ceratosaurus had longer, mobile {{arms with}} fingers and claws. Paleobiologist Alexander O. Vargas have suggested {{a major reason}} for the evolution towards vestigial forelimbs in the group was because of a genetic defect; the loss of function in HOXA11 and HOXD11, two genes which regulate the forelimbs' development.|$|E
5|$|The <b>more</b> <b>primitive</b> {{groups have}} an {{enlarged}} lobe-like {{area near the}} basal posterior margin (i.e. {{at the base of}} the forewing) called a jugum, that folds under the hindwing during flight. Other groups have a frenulum on the hindwing that hooks under a retinaculum on the forewing.|$|E

Researchers have also experimented with various means of implementing the virtual shared memory for this model.Many of these researchers proposed larger modifications to the original Linda model, developing a family of systems known as Linda-like systems and implemented as orthogonal technology (unlike original version). An {{example of this is}} the language Ease designed by Steven Ericsson-Zenith.|$|R

5|$|Additional subfamilies {{have been}} named for more fragmentary genera, {{including}} Aublysodontinae and Deinodontinae. However, the genera Aublysodon and Deinodon are usually considered nomina dubia, so they and their eponymous subfamilies are usually excluded from taxonomies of tyrannosaurids. An additional tyrannosaurid, Raptorex, was initially described as a <b>more</b> <b>primitive</b> tyrannosauroid, but likely represents a juvenile tyrannosaurine similar to Tarbosaurus. However, {{as it is known}} only from a juvenile specimen, it is also currently considered a nomen dubium.|$|E
5|$|Gerhard Heilmann {{discussed}} Beebe's Tetrapteryx hypothesis at considerable {{length in}} his 1926 book The Origin of Birds. Heilmann examined hatchlings {{of many other}} bird species, both closely related to those studied by Beebe and belonging to <b>more</b> <b>primitive</b> species, in hope of finding additional evidence for the leg-wings which Beebe had documented. After failing to find such evidence, Heilmann ultimately rejected Beebe's Tetrapteryx hypothesis, and this remained the consensus among ornithologists {{for the next several}} decades. Beebe, however, continued to advance his Tetrapteryx hypothesis as late as the 1940s.|$|E

5|$|Herrerasaurus had a long, narrow skull that lacked {{nearly all}} the specializations that {{characterized}} later dinosaurs, and more closely resembled those of <b>more</b> <b>primitive</b> archosaurs such as Euparkeria. It had five pairs of fenestrae (skull openings) in its skull, two pairs of which were for the eyes and nostrils. Between the eyes and the nostrils were two antorbital fenestrae {{and a pair of}} tiny, 1-centimeter-long (0.4in) slit-like holes called promaxillary fenestrae.|$|E
5|$|In more derived {{orders of}} insects, such as Diptera (flies) and Hymenoptera (wasp), the {{indirect}} muscles occupy the greatest {{volume of the}} pterothorax and function as {{the primary source of}} power for the wingstroke. Contraction of the dorsolongitudinal muscles causes the severe arching of the notum which depresses the wing while contraction of the dorsoventral muscles causes opposite motion of notum. Other <b>more</b> <b>primitive</b> insects, such as Orthoptera (locusts), Coleoptera (beetles), and Odonata (dragonflies) use direct muscles that are responsible for developing the needed power for the up and down strokes.|$|E
5|$|Mecoptera {{are small}} to {{medium-sized}} insects with long beaklike rostra, membranous wings and slender, elongated bodies. They have relatively simple mouthparts, {{with a long}} labium, long mandibles and fleshy palps, which resemble those of the <b>more</b> <b>primitive</b> true flies. Like many other insects, they possess compound eyes {{on the sides of}} their heads, and three ocelli on the top. The antennae are filiform (thread-shaped) and contain multiple segments.|$|E

40|$|International audienceContext {{semantics}} {{is a tool}} {{inspired by}} Girard' s geometry of interaction. It has had many applications from study of optimal reduction to proofs of complexity bounds. Yet, context semantics have been defined only on λ-calculus and linear logic. In order to study other languages, in particular languages with <b>more</b> <b>primitives</b> (built-in arithmetic, pattern matching, [...] .) we define a context semantics for a broader framework: interaction nets. These are a well-behaved class of graph rewriting systems. Here, two applications are explored. First, we define a notion of weight, based on context semantics paths, which bounds the length of reduction of nets. Then, we define a denotational semantics for a large class of interaction net systems...|$|R

5|$|Southern grey desert foxes {{include the}} Asian {{subspecies}} V.v.griffithi, V.v.pusilla, and V.v.flavescens. These foxes display transitional features between northern red foxes and smaller fox species; their skulls possess <b>more</b> <b>primitive,</b> neotenous traits than the northern forms, {{and they are}} much smaller; the maximum sizes attained by southern foxes are invariably less than the average sizes of northern foxes. Their limbs are also longer, and their ears larger.|$|E
5|$|The 2014 study defined Deinocheiridae as a clade {{including}} all taxa {{with a more}} recent common ancestor with Deinocheirusmirificus than with Ornithomimusvelox. The three members share various anatomical features in the limbs. The 2014 cladogram suggested that ornithomimosaurians diverged into two major lineages in the Early Cretaceous; Deinocheiridae and Ornithomimidae. Unlike other ornithomimosaurians, deinocheirids were not built for running. The anatomical peculiarities of Deinocheirus when compared to other, much smaller ornithomimosaurs, can largely be explained by its much larger size and weight. Deinocheirids and the smaller ornithomimids did not have teeth, unlike <b>more</b> <b>primitive</b> ornithomimosaurs.|$|E
5|$|The only genus {{that has}} {{retained}} the enlarged ventral scales is the sea kraits, Laticauda, with only five species. These snakes {{are considered to}} be <b>more</b> <b>primitive,</b> as they still spend much of their time on land, where their ventral scales afford them the necessary grip. Laticauda species are also the only sea snakes with internasal scales, i.e., their nostrils are not located dorsally.|$|E

5|$|When {{originally}} described, Patagosaurus {{was identified}} as a relative of Cetiosaurus in the family Cetiosauridae. It can be distinguished from Cetiosaurus, a similar genus, by features of the ischium and vertebrae. Another genus also identified as a cetiosaurid by Bonaparte, Volkheimeria, was named in the same paper as Patagosaurus. Features uniting the genera were identified in the pelvic structure and vertebrae, specifically the caudal neural spines and the ilium and ischium. These characteristics show that the genera are more derived than Amygdalodon, yet <b>more</b> <b>primitive</b> than Haplocanthosaurus.|$|E
5|$|William Morton Wheeler {{comments}} that P. longiceps were possibly an arboreal nesting species. This means the ant {{did not live}} in the soil and nested in trees instead. He assumed this due to its long legs, strong claws and long mandibles; Prionomyrmex was also assumed to be predacious, equipped with a well developed and powerful sting that was most likely used to kill prey. Prionomyrmex may have preferred a jungle habitat at low elevations, and is even <b>more</b> <b>primitive</b> in its body structure than Myrmecia. Female stylopids were known to parasite Prionomyrmex ants.|$|E
5|$|A {{challenge}} {{to all of}} these alternative scenarios came when Turner and colleagues in 2007 described a new dromaeosaurid, Mahakala, which they found to be the most basal and most primitive member of the Dromaeosauridae, <b>more</b> <b>primitive</b> than Microraptor. Mahakala had short arms and no ability to glide. Turner et al. also inferred that flight evolved only in the Avialae, and these two points suggested that the ancestral dromaeosaurid could not glide or fly. Based on this cladistic analysis, Mahakala suggests that the ancestral condition for dromaeosaurids is non-volant. However, in 2012, an expanded and revised study incorporating the most recent Dromaeosaurid finds recovered the Archaeopteryx-like Xiaotingia as the most primitive member of the clade Dromaeosauridae, which appears to suggest the earliest members of the clade may have been capable of flight.|$|E
