50|$|Genetic {{engineering}} {{is a process}} that alters the genetic make-up of an organism by either removing or introducing DNA. DNA can be introduced directly into the host organism or into a cell that is then fused or hybridized with the host. This relies on recombinant nucleic acid techniques to form new combinations of heritable genetic material followed by the incorporation of that material either indirectly through a vector system or directly through micro-injection, <b>macro-injection</b> or micro-encapsulation.|$|E
40|$|The use of {{software}} {{developed for the}} simulation of injection molding is evaluated through {{a case study of}} a micro-injection molded micro-pump component. The purpose of this evaluation is to determine if commercially available injection molding simulation software developed for <b>macro-injection</b> molding provides sufficient support to the development of micro-injection molded components. It is concluded from this experience that the software provides sufficient support to reduce the development cycle by minimizing the amount of process optimization required with physical samples...|$|E
