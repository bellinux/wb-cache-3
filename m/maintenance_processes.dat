40|$|Efficient {{maintenance}} {{policies are}} of fundamental importance {{because of their}} fallbacks into the safety and economics of air traffic operations. Usually the optimization of <b>maintenance</b> <b>process</b> {{is limited to a}} resource optimization in position and number. But it should be considered that maintenance tasks are performed by man whose excessive workload has negative falls-out not only for workers well-being but also for process safety and efficiency. Thus, in <b>maintenance</b> <b>process</b> optimization it is necessary to take into account also ergonomic aspects of workplace. This gives rise to an optimization of the <b>maintenance</b> <b>process</b> by using an ergonomic approach. In this way, the result of the optimization could allow improvements in the quality of the work of maintenance, but also a greater efficiency of the whole maintenance system. An ant colony optimization algorithm has been developed in order to optimize the system efficiency. This kind of algorithm natively permits to improve man movements into the workplace; furthermore the optimization of the workplace ergonomics has been added. To do this, an objective function of efficiency levels has been determined, linked to any task performed by man. Some protocols have been created {{on the basis of a}} literature survey and experimental results. This paper illustrates an applied research in which a method for the optimization of the <b>maintenance</b> <b>process</b> efficiency has been developed in order to show the applicability of a tool offering benefits on both sides: the <b>maintenance</b> <b>process</b> and the related human factors...|$|R

Probes offer a real time monitoring of the strategic goals achievement, also increasing {{the understanding of the}} maintenance activities.
