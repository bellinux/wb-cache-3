50|$|There {{appears to}} be some general {{requirements}} for formation. Barrier island systems develop most easily on wave-dominated coasts with a small to moderate tidal range. Coasts are classified into three groups based on tidal range: microtidal, 0-2 meter tidal range; <b>mesotidal,</b> 2-4 meter tidal range; and macrotidal, >4 meter tidal range. Barrier islands tend to form primarily along microtidal coasts, where {{they tend to be}} well developed and nearly continuous. They are less frequently formed in <b>mesotidal</b> coasts, where they are typically short with tidal inlets common. Barrier islands are very rare along macrotidal coasts. Along with a small tidal range and a wave-dominated coast, there must be a relatively low gradient shelf. Otherwise, sand accumulation into a sandbar would not occur and instead would be dispersed throughout the shore. An ample sediment supply is also a requirement for barrier island formation. The last major requirement for barrier island formation is a stable sea level. It is especially important for sea level to remain relatively unchanged during barrier island formation and growth. If sea level changes are too drastic, time will be insufficient for wave action to accumulate sand into a dune, which will eventually become a barrier island through aggradation. The formation of barrier islands requires a constant sea level so that waves can concentrate the sand into one location.|$|E

In the <b>mesotidal</b> area (a tidal range of between 1.35 and 2.9 m, barrier islands are formed; in the {{macrotidal}} area (above 2.9 m tidal range), intertidal deposits raise the spring tide range 4 m. A soft rock coast is formed in the meso-macro tidal areas located in the southern North Sea. These soft rock coastal bedrock plains are interspersed with soft rock (shale and sandstone) cliffs.|$|E

The Kaikoura Coast is <b>mesotidal</b> with a mean range of 1.36 m and a maximum of 2.57 m.

When the effect of terrestrial inputs is low compared to marine inputs, the river bed topography plays a role in the stratification of salinity by either disrupting {{the vertical}} stratification of the water or by changing the lateral distribution of salinity. The proposed classification deepens our hydrological knowledge and provides descriptive labels to the Oued Loukkos estuary. It provides a valid starting point for predicting the environmental impact of future recreational, agricultural and commercial activities on the estuary.|$|E

This implies that when the flow in the river is low, as it was during this survey, the effect of the bed topography lengthens the residence time of fresh water in the river, and thereby plays a role in freshening the water in this upstream reach of the estuary.|$|E
40|$|Tides {{are often}} {{considered}} to be the dominant hydrodynamic process within <b>mesotidal</b> estuaries although waves can also have a large influence on intertidal erosion rates. Here, we use a combination of hydrodynamic measurements and sediment deposition records to determine the conditions under which observed waves are “morphologically significant”, in which case they influence tidal and suspended sediment flux asymmetry and subsequently infilling over geomorphological timescales. Morphological significant conditions were evaluated using data from contrasting arms in a dendritic <b>mesotidal</b> estuary, in which the orientation of the arms relative to the prevailing wind results in a marked difference in wave conditions, deposition rates and morphology. By defining the morphological significance of waves as a product of the magnitude of bed shear stress and frequency of occurrence, even small (but frequently occurring) winds are shown to be capable of generating waves that are morphologically significant given sufficient fetch. In the arm in which fetch length is restricted, only stronger but rare storm events can influence sediment flux and therefore tides are more morphologically significant over longer timescales. Water depth within this <b>mesotidal</b> estuary is shown to be a critical parameter in controlling morphological significance; the rapid attenuation of short period waves with depth results in contrasting patterns of erosion occurring during neaps and accretion during springs...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} paper is to compare the profile {{response}} of two <b>mesotidal</b> beaches (Faro, 10 km long, Algarve; La Barrosa, 8 km long, Cadiz) within a single regional physiograph-ic unit (the Gulf of Cadiz) to the same storm event (January, 1996). For this comparison, a series of beach surveys was used, including a total of 10 study sites, five at each study area. The two beaches belong to exposed, <b>mesotidal,</b> sandy shores, and have a similar coastal orientation. However, the response time-scale is different for each one. Faro showed a total amount of 130 000 m 3 of erosion due to the storm, with a complete post-storm recovery after one tidal cycle. La Barrosa had a total sand loss of 80 000 m 3 due to the storm, with a final recovery of 60 000 m 3, 4 - 6 months after the event. These differences are due to the beaches ’ different morphodynamic behaviours. Whereas Faro is a reflective beach, with dominant plunging breakers, La Barrosa is mainly dissipative, having spilling breakers.

The Basque estuaries have semi-diurnal tides, with tidal amplitudes that can vary between 1  m in neap tides, to more than 4.5  m in spring tides (Valencia et al. 2004).

40|$|ABSTRACT: A novel {{numerical}} model (the Imperial College Ocean Model, ICOM) {{is used to}} simulate tidal circulation in shallow epicontinental seas connected to large, open oceans. ICOM is validated using the present-day North Sea and applied to predict tidal range in the late Pennsylvanian Midcontinent Seaway (LPMS) of North America. The model simulates {{the effect of the}} principal tidal constituents (astronomical tides) as well as the tide propagating from the adjacent open ocean (co-oscillating tide). Two ‘‘base-case’ ’ Pennsylvanian paleogeographies were tested: (1) a maximum sea-level highstand and (2) the early stages of a transgression. Sensitivity tests determined the importance of paleo-water depth and coastline uncertainty on the prediction of tidal range. During the highstand, tidal ranges in the craton interior (Midcontinent Shelf, Illinois and Appalachian basins) are consistently predicted as microtidal (, 2 m tidal range). Such low tidal ranges would have inhibited water-body mixing in the LPMS, promoting stratification. This, combined with the influx of oxygen-poor water from the Permian Basin to the west and high organic input from tropical rivers, {{may have contributed to the}} deposition of ‘‘core’ ’ black shales in LPMS cyclothems. Conversely, a <b>mesotidal</b> to macrotidal diurnal (once-daily tide) regime is predicted for the early transgression in a large-scale embayment in eastern Kansas due to resonant amplification of diurnal tidal constituents. Pennsylvanian strata here have been ascribed to a <b>mesotidal</b> to macrotidal setting and include cyclic rhythmites that suggest a strongly diurnal system, as predicted by ICOM...|$|E
40|$|Large {{areas of}} <b>mesotidal</b> {{estuaries}} become subaerial during low tide. Here we study {{the effect of}} nutrient enrichment and several meteorological and hydrodynamic parameters on the erodability of mudflat substrates when they are emergent. We tested the impact of nutrient fertilization on tidal flat sediments over a two week period in September 2011 in Plum Island Sound, Massachusetts (USA). High resolution measurements from our experiment indicate that daily nutrient enrichment at 70 μM NO 3 ‾ using our experimental approach {{does not change the}} critical shear stress of the muddy substrate, nor affect the concentration of chlorophyll a at the surface. Sediment erodability is instead directly related to the potential evaporation rate and to the duration of the subaerial period. Chlorophyll a concentration decreases when evaporation is high, possibly due to the downward migration of diatoms. Sediment concentrations in the water column during submergence strongly depend on bottom shear stresses triggered by tidal currents. Surprisingly, they are also related to the total evaporation that occurred in the previous emergence period. We conclude that subaerial desiccation at low tide decreases the erodability of mudflat sediments. This strengthening effect is not lost during the following submerged period, thus limiting the erosive effect of tidal currents. For the first time we show that not only subaqueous but also subaerial processes control the erodability of mudflats. Global warming and other climatic variations regulating long-term evaporation rates can therefore directly affect the stability of mudflats in <b>mesotidal</b> environments...|$|E
40|$|Las playas del sur de Buenos Aires son dominantemente mesomareales. La acción de la marea aumenta hacia el {{interior}} de lo que se ha denominado Rincón de Bahía Blanca y condiciona la distribución de las formas estuariales: barreras e islas de barrera hacia el exterior, y planicies, marismas y estuarios dominados por el reflujo hacia el interior. La morfodinámica de las playas reflejan estos condicionamientos dinámicos, y al mismo tiempo que son regulados por el tipo de sedimento disponible: arenas finas hacia el exterior y fangos hacia el interior del Rincón; las gravas están limitadas a los lugares donde las playas actuales están retrabajando playas fósiles. Dentro de este patrón sencillo, debemos considerar los procesos de crecimiento y retrabajo de lóbulos deltaicos del Río Colorado. El objetivo del presente trabajo consistióee en analizar la tipología de playas en un sector de transición entre ambientes micro y mesomareales, así como desarrollar una descripción de la morfología, sedimentos y parámetros físicos para inferir patrones de transporte de sedimento. Para ello se emplearon perfiles topográficos, muestreos sedimentológicos y mediciones de altura de ola. A partir de los datos de marea se calcularon los parámetros morfodinámicos RTR y Ù. De acuerdo al rango de mareas, la costa del llamado Rincón de Bahía Blanca es mesomareal en su interior y micromareal hacia sectores de mar abierto. Dentro del Rincón dominan los procesos y formas mareales (planicies, marismas, canales) que retrabajarron abanicos deltaicos del río Colorado. La energía de las olas y procesos de deriva en los sectores más oceánicos (este y sur del Rincón), generaron geoformas de acantilados, plataformas de abrasión, islas de barrera y médanos colgados. Beaches {{from southern}} Buenos Aires are dominantly <b>mesotidal.</b> Tidal range increases toward {{the interior of}} the Rincón de Bahía Blanca and conditions coastal landforms. Barriers and barrier islands dominate toward the outer bay; tidal flats and marshes toward the inner bay. These effects of the tidal range on coastal landforms are similar to those described at the Georgia and German bights (Hubbard et al., 1979; Nichols and Allen, 1982). Beach morphodynamics also reflects this situation although it is also conditioned by the type of available sediments: sands (dominantly fine sand) toward the outer bay and mud toward {{the interior of the}} Rincón. Gravel is limited to the southern beaches where present processes are reworking Holocene beaches, thatbeaches, which are the reworking of pedimentation levels. Within this pattern, the processes of growth and reworking (during Upper-Pleistocene and Mid-Holocene stillstands) of the deltaic lobes of the Colorado River should be considered. At the beaches of the south, there is a littoral sand contribution derived from the Negro River assymetricasymmetric delta. Toward the north, this longshore drift is segmented by ebb-dominated <b>mesotidal</b> inlets. Aeolian sand corridors, driven from the Colorado valley, have also transported sandsized material toward the coast. Open-ocean beaches (Segunda Barranca Lighthouse, El Cóndor Village and La Chiquita Beach) behave as <b>mesotidal</b> with dominant wave effects from the Atlantic Ocean. Along- bay beaches (San Blas Bay and Los Pocitos Beach) the effect of the tide dominates over fetch-limited waves. LonshoreLongshore-drift transport is significant at the coast between the Negro River Inlet and San Blas Bay. Northwards, the longshore drift is segmented by the ebb-oriented tidal inlets of the San Blas, Anegada, Brightman, Falsa and Verde bays. Fine sand dominates at these beaches, although shell accumulations at the backshore and gravel-composed washovers denote the effects of episodic open-ocean storms. The aim of the present paper focused to analyze beach typology in a transitional area: micro and <b>mesotidal</b> regimes; wave-dominated to tide-dominated continental shelf. Beach morphology and physical parameters were also considered to recognized sediment- transport patterns. With this purpose, topographic surveys, grain-size analysis y and breaker-height measurements were performed, in order to calculate the morphodynamic parameters RTR and Ù. In regard to tidal ranges, the coast of the Rincón de Bahía Blanca is <b>mesotidal</b> towards the interior and microtidal to the Outer Bayoffshore. Within the Inner Bay, tidal processes have reworked past delta fans of the Colorado River into tidal flats, marshes and tidal channels. At the Outer Bay, wave energy and the longshore drift toward the north generated barriers and ebb-dominated tidal deltas where there was sand availability, and cliffs, abrassionabrasion platforms and cliff-top dunes where sand or gravel were scarce...|$|E

The tidal characteristic throughout the entire Oued Loukkos estuary is <b>mesotidal.</b> At those times when the effect of terrestrial inputs is low compared to marine inputs, the river bed topography probably plays a role in the stratification of salinity by either disrupting the vertical stratification of the water or by changing the lateral distribution of salinity.|$|E

40|$|Tide-dominated and tide-influenced clastic depositional environments are {{typically}} interpreted {{to be associated}} with landward-stepping or transgressive systems. Here, we present an example of an overall regressive succession dominated by high-frequency sequences that exhibit abundant sedimentary and ichnological evidence of tidal processes. These strata comprise the Campanian Bearpaw–Horseshoe Canyon Formation transition exposed near Drumheller, Alberta, Canada. The clastic marine to marginal-marine sediments were deposited in mixed-process (wave-, tide-, and fluvial-influenced) depositional environments along the western margin of a foreland basin. The deposits are subdivided into six relatively thin (10 m on average), high-frequency (∼ 140, 000 years), transgressive–regressive (T-R) sequences (A to F). Outcrop sedimentary logs and hand-held gamma-ray profiles were correlated to subsurface data (4 cored wells and 75 wells with wireline logs) within an area of 22 km × 16 km in order to generate a 3 D geocellular computer model. This model along with paleocurrent data from outcrop were used to analyze the stratigraphic architecture and evolution of the succession. The evolution of the successive T-R sequences was mapped on a subregional scale using the 3 D geocellular model. The orientations of the paleoshorelines rotate in a predictable manner during transgression and regression. Transgressive shorelines are oriented approximately S–N and rotate clockwise during regression to approximately SW–NE. The rotations are attributed to the paleogeography of the region, with the study area interpreted to sit on the western flank of a large structurally controlled embayment. The progradational high-frequency sequence set is dominated by tide-influenced strata and clearly demonstrates that tidal deposits can be preserved in both regressive as well as transgressive successions. Tidal influence in this regressive setting is attributed to shallow water depths on a wide shelf, which resulted in amplification of the tidal wave as it moved across the shelf. The embayed character of the coastline may also have augmented this effect. Tidal range is estimated to have been <b>mesotidal</b> to macrotidal. A modern partial analogue for the Horseshoe Canyon systems is identified from the tropical Mitchell River Delta in the Gulf of Carpentaria, Queensland, Australia. This delta system is analogous in terms of its tide-influenced facies, <b>mesotidal</b> range, low-gradient shelf with accompanying shallow water depths, the mixed-process character of its shoreline systems, and its horizontal to falling shoreline trajectory.

40|$|Moating is {{the process}} of {{constraining}} the ebbing tide over the reef to produce moats in which low tide water levels remain perched above open water levels (see Moats). Moating truncates the lower part of each tidal cycle at an elevation determined by the height (in the tidal frame) and permeability of the moating structure (Figure 1 a). Moating can occur at any intertidal elevation and may only be active during the lowest spring tides. Where moating occurs behind stable and impervious features, like algal rims (see Algal rims) the water level is consistent on every (lower) low tide. In contrast, at <b>mesotidal</b> locations like the central Great Barrier Reef (GBR) open water spring and neap low tides can differ by > 2 m. Moating allows some reef biota to survive above their open water limits, and must be considered when interpreting intertidal sea-level indicators, especially coral microatolls (see Microatoll) (Figure 1 a). Moating also has important implications for sedimentation on reefs.

A single-box, {{single-layer}} LOICZ model was applied to data in 1987 and 1999 to estimate the biogeochemical budget of the Ria Formosa lagoon. Water exchange time in the lagoon {{was estimated to be}} about 2 days. Both the fluxes of DIP and DIN were negative, indicating that the system acts as sink of both DIP and DIN. Stoichiometric calculations assumed nutrient ratios in both Redfield proportions (C:N:P= 106 : 16 : 1) and in proportions appropriate for macroalgae (C:N:P= 335 : 35 : 1). Overall, the lagoon can be consider as “autotrophic”, with a net ecosystem metabolism (p-r) 8. 4 mmol C m- 2 d- 1 considering Redfield ratio. Nitrification dominated over nitrogen fixation since it was positive in both cases. The Ria Formosa lagoon is sensitive to the tide. The water and nutrient budget in the lagoon has strong seasonal variation, especially the dry and rainy seasons. According to the standards of EEA, the Ria Formosa lagoon is between oligotrophic and mesotrophic...|$|E
40|$|Grain size is a {{fundamental}} property of sediments and is commonly used to describe sedimentary facies and classify sedimentary environments. Among the various conventional techniques utilized to determine grain-size frequency distributions, sieving is the most widely applied procedure. The accuracy of such analyses is, among other factors, strongly dependent on the sieving time. However, despite {{a substantial amount of}} research in this field, optimal sieving times for different types of sediments have, to date, not been established. In this article, the influence of sieving time on grain-size analyses of medium-grained microtidal and <b>mesotidal</b> beach and dune sands has been determined. To assess the precision of important textural parameters, such as median grain size, sorting, skewness and kurtosis, an error analysis was carried out for different sieving times (2, 5, 10, 15 and 20 minutes). After calibrating the analytical and sampling methodologies, significant deviations were registered when sieving time was less than 10 minutes. However, such deviations were very small and grain-size distributions remained almost identical for sieving times of 10 minutes and longer, relative errors being as low as 0 % in some cases...|$|E
40|$|The {{sedimentary}} sequence {{preserved in}} the isolation basin at Loch nan Corr (NW Scotland) represents a high resolution record of environmental changes over the last 9. 5 ka (virtually the entire Holocene). The final isolation of the basin from the sea is recorded over a 6 m sediment sequence lasting c. 7000 years as the rock sill of the basin passes through the intertidal zone. This isolation is due to relative sea-level fall associated with isostatic rebound from the melting of the Last Glacial Maximum ice sheet. Combining faunal counts of foraminifera and thecamoe-bians from the same sample preparations allows an ac-curate reconstruction of sea-level and environmental changes at this site over the Holocene. This study shows the potential for isolation basins in <b>mesotidal</b> areas to provide a series of sea-level index points from a single isolation contact thus improving the ease and accuracy of sea-level reconstructions. Biostratigraphic data im-prove {{our understanding of the}} ecology of foraminifera in these relatively unstudied rock-enclosed lagoonal eco-systems. It seems likely that Miliammina fusca can tol-erate the generally low and highly variable salinities in these lagoonal settings more readily than any other fo-raminiferal species...|$|E
