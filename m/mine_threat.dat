50|$|The {{helicopter}} crew {{confirmed the}} wreckage site with the aircraft sensors and reported back their find. The crash site {{was on a}} high mountain ridge called Cheri Ghar at some 3000 metres (or 10 000 feet). The ridge was a daunting place; sheer on one side, steeply sloping on the other with deep snowfields and swept by high winds or covered in freezing fog. The snow hid any local tracks or paths and the approach roads from nearby villages were impassable to vehicles, despite several attempts by ISAF and ANA patrols {{to find a way}} to the summit. The winter weather did not give another opportunity until 7 February when a window of clear weather allowed an ISAF Spanish Cougar helicopter to set down a 5-man team of Slovenian mountain rescue troops onto the ridge summit. Pushing on through the waist-deep snow and conscious of the possible <b>mine</b> <b>threat,</b> the team reached the site. Although the team found no human remains, the badly broken up debris scattered along the ridgeline and the extreme conditions made it very unlikely that anyone had survived the crash.|$|E

These had a small envelope of [...] and at first used aircraft fuselages without the wing and tail surfaces as control cars. Eventually more advanced blimps with purpose built gondolas were built. The NS class (North Sea) were largest and most effective nonrigid airships in British service. These had a gas capacity of , a crew of 10 and an endurance of 24 hours. Six 230 lb bombs were carried, as well as three to five machine guns. British blimps were used for scouting, mine clearance, and convoy patrol duties. During the war, the British operated over 200 nonrigid airships. Several were sold to Russia, France, the United States, and Italy. The large number of trained crews, low attrition rate and constant experimentation in handling techniques meant that at the war's end Britain was the world leader in nonrigid airship technology.|$|E

40|$|Modern {{influence}} mines use Ship Classification Systems (SCS) {{to differentiate}} between targets and non-targets through an analysis of signature features. Unlike classical mine modelling, which follows a deterministic approach, {{in this paper we}} describe the stochastic mine model that was developed at NURC. The model, called Fuzzy Logic Advanced Mine Emulator (FLAME) is a generic mine model using a fuzzy logic approach. An important advantage offered by this model is that it can be retrained and is able to simulate modern and even future <b>mine</b> <b>threats.</b> In the experimental section, we show another advantage of the model; the capability of the FLAME to identify the signature features that offer the greatest level of discrimination for the specific target(s) of interest. Clearly, this provides valuable information for MCM forces, mine layers and ship designers. In the experimental section we show the capabilities of FLAME to learn to distinguish the signatures of two ships. Also we show how the output statistics of FLAME provides detailed insights on the most distinctive signature features of these two ships...|$|R
