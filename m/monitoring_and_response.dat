Brown Lloyd James advised that [...] "Refocusing the perception of outsiders and Syrians on reform will provide political cover to the generally sympathetic US Government, and will delegitimize critics at home and abroad. In our view, the President needs to communicate more often and with more finely-tuned messaging and the First Lady needs {{to get in the}} game. The absence of a public figure as popular, capable, and attuned to the hopes of the people as Her Excellency at such a critical moment is conspicuous. The key is to show strength and sympathy at once." [...] The company recommended a public relations campaign to [...] "create a reform 'echo-chamber' by developing media coverage outside of Syria that points to the President's difficult task of wanting reform" [...] so that the [...] "coverage would rebound into Syria". Brown Lloyd James also recommended [...] "countering ... the daily torrent of criticism and lies" [...] by [...] "a 24-hour media <b>monitoring</b> <b>and</b> <b>response</b> system that should be in place with assets in UK and US markets; monitoring social media sites and and removing false sites; and a steady, constantly updated messaging document that contains talking points geared to latest developments." ...|$|E
