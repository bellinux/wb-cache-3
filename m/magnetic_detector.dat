5000|$|During his transatlantic radio {{communication}} experiments in December 1902 Marconi found the coherer {{to be too}} unreliable and insensitive for detecting the very weak radio signals from long distance transmissions. It was this need that drove him to develop his <b>magnetic</b> <b>detector.</b> Marconi devised a more effective configuration with a moving iron band driven by a clockwork motor passing by stationary magnets and coils, resulting in a continuous supply of iron that was changing magnetization, and thus continuous sensitivity (Rutherford claimed he had also invented this configuration). [...] The Marconi <b>magnetic</b> <b>detector</b> was the [...] "official" [...] detector used by the Marconi Company from 1902 through 1912, when the company began converting to the Fleming valve and Audion-type vacuum tubes. It was used through 1918.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Magnetic</b> <b>detector</b> - Developed by Guglielmo Marconi in 1902 from {{a method}} invented by Ernest Rutherford {{and used by}} the Marconi Co. until it adopted the Audion vacuum tube around 1912, this was a {{mechanical}} device consisting of an endless band of iron wires which passed between two pulleys turned by a windup mechanism. [...] The iron wires passed through a coil of fine wire attached to the antenna, in a magnetic field created by two magnets. The hysteresis of the iron induced a pulse of current in a sensor coil each time a radio signal passed through the exciting coil. The <b>magnetic</b> <b>detector</b> was used on shipboard receivers due to its insensitivity to vibration. One {{was part of the}} wireless station of the RMS Titanic which was used to summon help during its famous 15 April 1912 sinking.|$|E

In this period, a particular electromagnetic receiver, called the Marconi <b>magnetic</b> <b>detector</b> or hysteresis <b>magnetic</b> <b>detector,</b> was developed further by Marconi and was successfully {{used in his}} early transatlantic work (1902) and {{in many of the}} smaller stations for a number of years. In 1902, a Marconi station was established in the village of Crookhaven, County Cork, Ireland to provide marine radio communications to ships arriving from the Americas. A ship's master could contact shipping line agents ashore to enquire which port was to receive their cargo without the need to come ashore at what was the first port of landfall. Ireland was also, due to its western location, to {{play a key role in}} early efforts to send trans-Atlantic messages. Marconi {{transmitted from}} his station in Glace Bay, Nova Scotia, Canada across the Atlantic, and on 18 January 1903 a Marconi station sent a message of greetings from Theodore Roosevelt, the President of the United States, to the King of the United Kingdom, marking the first transatlantic radio transmission originating in the United States ...|$|E
