50|$|Like the unison and octave stops, {{the length}} label of a <b>mutation</b> <b>stop</b> {{indicates}} what pitch the rank sounds. For example, a stop labeled 2' sounds at the interval of a twelfth (one octave plus a fifth; or 3:1 ratio) above unison pitch. That is, with a 2' stop drawn, pressing middle C sounds the G {{that is the}} 12th diatonic note above.|$|E
5000|$|The {{sounding}} {{length of}} a <b>mutation</b> <b>stop</b> gives the answer as to what pitch the rank sounds. For example, a stop labeled ′ (or one-third of 8′) sounds at three times the frequency, that is, the interval of a twelfth above unison pitch. This third harmonic (twelfth, quint, qvinta, rorkvint, or nazard nasard) is the most-common pitch, followed by the fifth harmonic (tierce or ters on some organs) (′) and sixth (larigot, nasat) (′) and there are rarer examples from higher in the series, such as the [...] "septième" [...] or [...] "septima" [...] (′) and [...] "none" [...] (′).|$|E
50|$|Positive organs {{typically}} exhibit few stops due {{to their}} small size and portable nature; a specification of 8&prime; stopped, 4&prime; flute and 2&prime; principal (diapason) is common. Somewhat larger positives may also have a 2-2/3&prime; and/or other <b>mutation</b> <b>stop</b> and/or a small mixture, and some have an 8&prime; reed stop (such as a regal). Still larger positives may have a 4&prime; principal or a second 8&prime; stop, the latter often treble-only. More complex examples feature a divided keyboard, which allows each stop to be activated separately in the treble and bass portions of the keyboard. This {{makes it possible to}} play a melody and an accompaniment simultaneously on different registrations. Most positives have just one manual keyboard and no pedals, but there are examples with a set of pedal pulldowns or even a pedal stop or two, as well as rarer ones with two manuals.|$|E

40|$|We {{isolated}} two yeast mutants {{that are}} temperature-sensitive for import of mitochondrial proteins. Each strain contains a single mutation {{that results in}} arrest of growth and accumulation of precursor to the beta subunit of the mitochondrial F 1 -ATPase after incubation at 37 degrees C. These lesions (mas 1 and mas 2) are nonallelic and recessive. Cells harboring either <b>mutation</b> <b>stop</b> growing only after 2 - 3 generations at 37 degrees C. Import of the F 1 beta subunit at 37 degrees C is more than 250 times slower in mas 1 and 15 times slower in mas 2 than in wild-type cells. At 23 degrees C, import occurs with similar rates in mutant and wild-type cells. The two mutations also reduce the rate of import of other proteins; however, import of different precursors is affected to different degrees in the two strains. The temperature-sensitive step in import in both mas 1 and mas 2 occurs before arrival of precursors in the mitochondrial matrix...|$|E

We show herein that major cell cycle events remain synchronized in these endoreplicating cells. DNA replication alternates with gap phases and cell cycle-specific cyclin E expression is maintained.

Centrosome migration, a typical prophase event, also takes place in endoreplicating cells. The timing of these events is unaffected by cdk 1 inactivation compared with normally dividing cells. Nuclear lamina breakdown, in contrast, previously shown {{to be dependent on}} cdk 1, does not take place in endoreplicating HT 2 - 19 cells. Moreover, breakdown of all other major components of the nuclear lamina, like the inner nuclear membrane proteins and nuclear pore complexes, seems also to depend on cdk 1. Interestingly, the APC/C ubiquitin ligase is activated in these endoreplicating cells by fzr but not by fzy.

40|$|AbstractFunctional {{studies of}} HIV- 1 {{envelope}} glycoproteins (Envs) commonly include {{the generation of}} pseudoviruses, which are produced by co-transfection of rev–vpu–env cassettes with an env-deficient provirus. Here, we describe six Env constructs from transmitted/founder HIV- 1 that were defective in the pseudotyping assay, although two produced infectious virions when expressed from their cognate proviruses. All of these constructs exhibited an unusual gene arrangement in which the first exon of rev (rev 1) and vpu {{were in the same}} reading frame without an intervening stop codon. Disruption of the rev 1 –vpu fusion gene by frameshift <b>mutation,</b> <b>stop</b> codon, or abrogation of the rev initiation codon restored pseudovirion infectivity. Introduction of the fusion gene into wildtype Env cassettes severely compromised their function. The defect was not due to altered env and rev transcription or a dominant negative effect of the expressed fusion protein, but seemed to be caused by inefficient translation at the env initiation codon. Although the rev 1 –vpu polymorphism affects Env expression only in vitro, it can cause problems in studies requiring Env complementation, such as analyses of co-receptor usage and neutralization properties, since 3 % of subtype A, 20 % of subtype C and 5 % of CRF 01 _A/E viruses encode the fusion gene. A solution is to eliminate the rev initiation codon when amplifying rev–vpu–env cassettes since this increases Env expression irrespective of the presence of the polymorphism...|$|E

In each case amyloid deposition {{has been associated with}} a peptide extension at the carboxyl-terminus of apoAII, the result of mutations in the normal stop codon. MethodsA Caucasian man who has had progressive renal dysfunction since age of 34 was found to have amyloidosis on renal biopsy at age 56. Echocardiogram showed mild intraventricular septal thickness and technetium- 99 m (99 mTc) -pyrophosphate scintigraphy demonstrated uptake by cardiac muscle consistent with amyloid deposition in the myocardium. His father died of renal failure and his paternal half brother has renal dysfunction. ResultsDNA sequencing of the apoAII gene in the proband showed a T to C transition at the first position of the stop codon indicating replacement of the stop codon by L-arginine (Arg) at residue 78. Western analysis of the proband's plasma under reducing conditions using anti-apoAII revealed an extra band at approximately 10 kD in addition to the normal apoAII band at 8 kD. Western analysis of solubilized amyloid fibrils isolated from rectal biopsy tissue contained only the variant apoAII. ConclusionThese results indicate that the proband's amyloid fibrils are derived from apoAII and the amyloidogenesis is linked to the peptide extension at the carboxyl-terminus of variant apoAII. Of particular interest is that this novel apoAII variant may cause amyloid cardiomyopathy in addition to renal amyloid...|$|E

40|$|International audienceGenetic {{mutations}} of SHANK 3 {{have been}} reported in patients with intellectual disability, autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and schizophrenia. At the synapse, Shank 3 /ProSAP 2 is a scaffolding protein that connects glutamate receptors to the actin cytoskeleton via a chain of intermediary elements. While genetic studies have repeatedly confirmed the association of SHANK 3 mutations with susceptibility to psychiatric disorders, very {{little is known about the}} neuronal consequences of these mutations. Here, we report the functional effects of two de novo mutations (STOP and Q 321 R) and two inherited variations (R 12 C and R 300 C) identified in patients with ASD. We show that Shank 3 is located at the tip of actin filaments and enhances its polymerization. Shank 3 also participates in growth cone motility in developing neurons. The truncating <b>mutation</b> (<b>STOP)</b> strongly affects the development and morphology of dendritic spines, reduces synaptic transmission in mature neurons, and also inhibits the effect of Shank 3 on growth cone motility. The de novo mutation in the ankyrin domain (Q 321 R) modifies the roles of Shank 3 in spine induction and morphology and actin accumulation in spines and affects growth cone motility. Finally, the two inherited mutations (R 12 C and R 300 C) have intermediate effects on spine density and synaptic transmission. Therefore, although inherited by healthy parents, the functional effects of these mutations strongly suggest that they could represent risk factors for ASD. Altogether, these data provide new insights into the synaptic alterations caused by SHANK 3 mutations in humans and provide a robust cellular readout for the development of knowledge-based therapies...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Cystic {{fibrosis}} (CF) {{is caused}} by mutations in the gene encoding the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) protein, which acts as a chloride channel activated by cyclic AMP (cAMP). The most frequent mutation found in 70 % of CF patients is F 508 del, while premature <b>stop</b> <b>mutations</b> are found in about 10 % of patients. In vitro aminoglycoside antibiotics (e. g. gentamicin) suppress nonsense mutations located in CFTR permitting translation to continue to the natural termination codon. Pharmacologic suppression of <b>stop</b> <b>mutations</b> within the CFTR may be of benefit to {{a significant number of}} patients. Our pilot study was conducted to determine whether intravenous gentamicin suppresses stop codons in CF patients and whether it has clinical benefits. Methods A dual gene reporter system was used to determine the gentamicin-induced readthrough level of the most frequent <b>stop</b> <b>mutations</b> within the CFTR in the French population. We investigated readthrough efficiency in response to 10 mg/kg once-daily intravenous gentamicin perfusions in patients with and without <b>stop</b> <b>mutations.</b> Respiratory function, sweat chloride concentration, nasal potential difference (NPD) and CFTR expression in nasal epithelial cells were measured at baseline and after 15 days of treatment. Results After in vitro gentamicin incubation, the readthrough efficiency for the Y 122 X mutation was at least five times higher than that for G 542 X, R 1162 X, and W 1282 X. In six of the nine patients with the Y 122 X mutation, CFTR immunodetection showed protein at the membrane of the nasal epithelial cells and the CFTR-dependent Cl - secretion in NPD measurements increased significantly. Respiratory status also improved in these patients, irrespective of the gentamicin sensitivity of the bacteria present in the sputum. Mean sweat chloride concentration decreased significantly and normalised in two patients. Clinical status, NPD and sweat Cl - values did not change in the Y 122 X patients with no protein expression, in patients with the other <b>stop</b> <b>mutations</b> investigated in vitro and those without <b>stop</b> <b>mutations.</b> Conclusion Suppression of <b>stop</b> <b>mutations</b> in the CFTR gene with parenteral gentamicin can be predicted in vitro and is associated with clinical benefit and significant modification of the CFTR-mediated Cl - transport in nasal and sweat gland epithelium. </p...|$|R

In 1985 it was shown {{for the first time that}} aminoglycosides are able to read through stop codons in mammalian cells. Approximately 5 to 10 percent of all genetic diseases are caused by nonsense mutations. Aminoglycoside-mediated read through was recently demonstrated for a variety of diseases including cystic fibrosis and muscular dystrophy Duchenne in vitro and in vivo. This study investigated four nonsense mutations of the MC 4 R gene two located in the N-terminus of the receptor (W 16 X and Y 35 X), one mutation in the first transmembrane domain (E 61 X) and one in the sixth transmembrane membrane domain for aminoglycoside-mediated functional (re-induction of signal transduction properties) rescue.

In some populations, premature <b>stop</b> <b>mutations</b> represent roughly two-thirds of the mutations that cause Hurler syndrome. In this study we investigated whether the aminoglycoside gentamicin can suppress <b>stop</b> <b>mutations</b> within the IDUA gene. We found that a Hurler syndrome fibroblast cell line heterozygous for the IDUA <b>stop</b> <b>mutations</b> Q 70 X and W 402 X showed {{a significant increase in}} alpha-L-iduronidase activity when cultured in the presence of gentamicin, resulting in the restoration of 2. 8 % of normal alpha-L-iduronidase activity. Determination of alpha-L-iduronidase protein levels by an immunoquantification assay indicated that gentamicin treatment produced a similar increase in alpha-L-iduronidase protein in Hurler cells. Both the alpha-L-iduronidase activity and protein level resulting from this treatment have previously been correlated with mild Hurler phenotypes. Although Hurler fibroblasts contain a much higher level of GAGs than normal, we found that gentamicin treatment reduced GAG accumulation in Hurler cells to a normal level. We also found that a reduced GAG level could be sustained for at least 2 days after gentamicin treatment was discontinued. The reduction in the GAG level was also reflected in a marked reduction in lysosomal vacuolation.

To address this challenge, we have developed a machine learning-based software tool, AudioGene v 2. 0, to prioritize candidate genes for mutation screening based on audioprofiling. METHODS: We analyzed audiometric data from a cohort of American families with high-frequency autosomal dominant sensorineural hearing loss. Those families predicted to have a DFNA 2 audioprofile by AudioGene v 2. 0 were screened for mutations in the KCNQ 4 gene. RESULTS: Two novel missense <b>mutations</b> and a <b>stop</b> <b>mutation</b> were detected in three American families predicted to have DFNA 2 -related deafness for a positive predictive value of 6. 3 %.

The transgene encodes a mouse/human chimeric heavy chain with a stop codon in the variable region (HUG-X). If somatic <b>mutation</b> reverts the <b>stop</b> codon, the HUG heavy chain is expressed. HUG-X mice were immunized to promote somatic mutation. B-cells from these mice were then immortalized, creating hybridomas. The HUG-X hybridomas were then subcloned to isolate possible mutants. While hybridomas are maintained in tissue culture, they secrete antibodies into the culture medium. This medium {{can be drawn}} off and tested by Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA). Previously in our lab, HUG-X hybridomas expressing HUG (presumably due to somatic <b>mutation)</b> <b>stopped</b> expressing HUG as they were maintained in culture.

Subclones of the hybridoma lines HyXX 5, HyXX 6, HyXX 7, and HyXX 8 have been assayed for HUG expression through ELISAs.
