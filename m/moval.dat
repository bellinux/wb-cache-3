40|$|Abstract. A {{framework}} {{supported by}} a set of tools for turning digital signal processing algorithms into custom chips is proposed. The framework, called <b>MOVAL,</b> integrates analysis, layout synthesis and validation and is based on a structured top-down design methodology covering seven succinct abstraction levels: the behavioral, data representation, space/time, hardware, symbolic and geometric (mask) descriptions, and the chip. The top four levels efficiently cope with the implementa-tion trade-offs and are all written in the same high level language, currently &quot;C&quot;. As a result, the design can be modeled using a mixture of components defined at different abstraction levels. This allows an efficient mixed-mode multi-level validation. The hardware description is unambiguous and is the key to (semi-) automatic synthesis of the layout. Furthermore, it generates test vectors for the symbolic layout, the mask and, finally, the chip. The validation is done automatically, based on back substitution. As an example of the proposed design methodology, the crucial steps of the implementation of a fast Fourier cosine transform algorithm are described. Zusammenfassung.

40|$|Abstract: Depressurization f {{reservoirs}} in petroliferous basins commonly occurs through cap-rocks at structural crests where pore {{pressures are}} locally elevated because {{of either the}} presence of a hydrocarbon column or the redistribution of overpressures bywater flow along laterally extensive nclined permeable aquifers. In exhumed petroliferous basins this deflation of excess pore pressures i enhanced by the denudation process, which results in the large-scale r <b>moval</b> of overburden during regional uplift. Evidence from the exhumed basins of the Atlantic margin indicates that hydrocarbon accumulations in these basins are commonly characterized by underfilled traps and hydrostatically pressured or modestly overpressured reservoirs. These observations are reviewed {{in the context of the}} generic mechanisms bywhich top-seals leak, the properties of cap-rocks and the physical processes that occur during exhumation. Water-wet shaly cap-rocks can form a capillary seal to a hydrocarbon column while simultaneously accommodating brine flow and equilibration of pressures between the reservoir and the top-seal. In contrast, thick, low-permeability shale or evaporite sequences may form pressure seals that restrict vertical brine nd hydrocarbon flow and prevent th...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: A long-standing problem isthe {{extent of}} {{selective}} r <b>moval</b> of chemical components {{and the amount}} of volume loss during the formation of slaty and crenulation cleavages during prograde metamorphism of sediments. Heterogeneous deformation leads to the formation of strongly deformed phyllosilicate-rich (P) domains and less deformed quartz-rich (Q) domains. The rocks generally show evidence of solution of quartz in P domains and addition of quartz in Q domains. The problem is whether the subtractions and additions balance or whether silica is lost from the system on the metre or broader scales. Structural studies tend to favour volume loss, whereas chemical studies tend to favour no volume loss. This review indicates hat it is not yet possible to determine which of these views is correct. Deformation heterogeneity and fluid activity on a range of scales may play an important part in the development of slaty cleavage, suggesting the eed for a detailed coordinated study, in which structural geologists and geochemists study identical material from the same sedimentary beds, in different parts of folds.

40|$|Abstract: Based on {{observations}} of channel changes and bar sedimentation in small-scale hydraulic models, {{it is argued}} that confluence zones play the key role in sedimentation patterns and processes in gravel-bed braided streams. The control is exerted because confluences are nodes in the channel network and therefore sedimentation a d channel pattern downstream of a confluence are mediated by the response of the confluence to changes indischarge, bedload, and planform of the upstream confluent channels. Examples of confluence kinetics and sedimentation ccurring over time-scales equivalent todays or weeks of competent flows in the prototype are described for the first time. Renewed braiding is directly associated with flow expansion downstream of confluences and triggered by migration of unit bars or bedload sheets through the confluence. Lateral translation of confluences may lead to the accretion of point bar complexes, while downstream translation often causes erosion or complete r <b>moval</b> of existing bars.

These mechanisms are mainly based on the antioxidant effects of ascorbic acid, gluta- thione in intimate cooperation with superoxide dismutase, catalase and various perox- idases - the reduced coenzymes, NADH and NADPH, {{play a major role}} in the ROS elimination, too. However, in recent times, the attention has turned from these key compounds of primary metabolism to secondary metabolites. Interestingly, the phenolic com- pounds together with some terpenes and alkaloids exhibit antioxidant effects, too, and apparently they play an irreplaceable role in the life of a plant - besides their antiox- idant action they are also important in the fight against pathogens and herbivores, in attracting the pollinators or in the moderation of UV light effects. Natural products are also studied in their relation to man - a broad variety of effects is known including the antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and anticancer effects for the most part. In this work, extracts comprising mainly of low-molecular-weight compounds were obtained from 32 plants with either hot water, 80 %w aqueous methanol or just by plain juicing. The extracts were then examined by three [...] ...|$|E
