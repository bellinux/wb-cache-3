Sometimes I'm wracked with guilt when I needn't be, and that, to me, is left over from my Catholic upbringing. Because in Catholicism you are born a sinner {{and you are a}} sinner all of your life. No <b>matter</b> <b>how</b> <b>you</b> try to get away from it, the sin is within you all the time.|$|E

[...] While noting that the soundtrack was superseded with the 1999 release of Yellow Submarine Songtrack, Gassman writes: [...] "No <b>matter</b> <b>how</b> <b>you</b> get them, though, the otherwise unavailable songs on this album ought {{to be part of}} any thinking Beatles fan's collection." [...] Alex Young of Consequence of Sound writes: [...] "as a whole, Yellow Submarine is a delightful album, even if it's still a less-than-acceptable inclusion in the Beatles canon", though he criticised the inclusion of Martin's score, which he felt should have been sold as a separate release.|$|E
500|$|Leonard Maltin {{awarded the}} film {{two and a}} half stars out of four, {{describing}} it a [...] "weird, almost incoherent crime story." [...] Celluloid Dream's Simon Hill commented that the writing was a disappointment, musing that it did however feature [...] "glimpses of director Raimi would become". A scene in a dentist office reminded him of a scene from Spider-Man 2, a film also directed by Raimi. He commented that [...] "even in his small part Campbell is the most memorable character in the film", also praising the performance of the two exterminators. Campbell also criticized the film, describing it as a [...] "lesson about abject failure", writing [...] "no <b>matter</b> <b>how</b> <b>you</b> slice it, the film was a dog, and everyone involved can pretty much line up and take forty whacks. As filmmakers, we failed to execute a misguided concept and our studio refused us the benefit of any doubt." [...] The film has achieved the status of a minor cult film. In one of the few positive notices, MTV writer Adam Rosenberg described the film as [...] "criminally underrated". Rosenberg disagreed with the consensus about the film, labeling it as a [...] "hard-to-find classic". Kim Newman also called the film underrated, writing that the film [...] "revels" [...] in its slapstick nature, taking influence from everything from horror comics to The Three Stooges.|$|E
500|$|With {{regards to}} casting, Watanabe {{considered}} Kōichi Yamadera to be [...] "really perfect" [...] for Spike. The staff had him audition as a formality, but Watanabe felt that [...] "no <b>matter</b> <b>how</b> <b>you</b> looked at it, {{there was only}} Yamadera". After a decade of work in anime series, Yamadera was pleased to secure his first leading role, but Unshō Ishizuka, Jet's voice actor, was surprised that Yamadera was not cast as Jet. The two characters were designed to be opposites, with Spike being thin and wearing smart attire, while Jet was bulky and wore more casual clothing. Spike's English voice actor, Steven Blum, used film noir imagery to get himself in the right frame of mind to voice the character, but experienced some difficulty portraying in scenes where he was showing vulnerability. Reflecting on his performance, Blum said [...] "there were a few lines here and there that I felt were awkward, and could have been smoothed out better." [...] He called Spike an [...] "example of a character [...] didn't fully appreciate until the series was over", adding {{that he would like}} to reprise his role as the character if given the chance. Spike's portrayal was expanded in [...] Specifically, according to Yamadera, the character displayed more of his inner thoughts and showed a gentler side than he did in the series. This was because the team had more time available to express such details. Blum found his performance in the movie one of his most difficult from an emotional standpoint, as there were scenes where Spike was portrayed quite differently from the version he had been playing in the series.|$|E

She later confirmed this on a KIIS-FM interview with DJ SKEE, saying that the performance would debut her new single, [...] "Louboutins". The performance took on a boxing theme, and featured famous ring announcer Michael Buffer introducing Lopez to the stage. Lopez performed in a boxing-like outfit and had a costume change halfway through the performance. The performance began in the ring and ended with Lopez walking through the audience. However the performance did not go as planned when the choreographed [...] "dramatic stunt of climbing up a human pyramid of semi-naked male dancers" [...] went wrong. [...] "She lost her balance after jumping off a dancer's back, and landed on her derriere." [...] In E! Online's [...] "Top Five Worst Concert Diggers", Lopez's fall was ranked at number five. However, according to The Daily Mail Natalie Trombetta, Lopez responded in a professional way, [...] "ever the professional, Jennifer quickly recovered her poise and carried on with the show." [...] Close friend and American TV presenter Ryan Seacrest, agreed calling it [...] "the greatest recovery ever!" [...] According to MTV, [...] "the tumble was edited out of the West Coast feed of the show, out of respect for Lopez, by the show's producers". Becky Bain of 'Idolator' suggested that the tumble was more talked about than the actually single itself, which was confirmed when MTV reported {{that it was one of}} the most searched things on the internet.

Numerous government agencies produced press releases that touted the benefits of the agreement. Many of these releases noted that this was the largest water transfer agreement in American history. Although residents of the Imperial Valley have been the main opponents of this measure, some observers have embraced the agreement, arguing that it is the most realistic and pragmatic solution to the water crisis in the area. Brad Jennings, a tentative supporter of the agreement, notes that [...] "There are things most agree on: The Salton Sea must be saved. No <b>matter</b> <b>how</b> <b>you</b> feel about water transfers you know that a dead Sea would be an environmental disaster for us. And our water rights and water allotment must be protected.
