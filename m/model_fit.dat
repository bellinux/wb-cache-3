25|$|Interestingly, {{fundamentally}} novel {{approaches for}} model choice that incorporate quality control {{as an integral}} {{step in the process}} have recently been proposed. ABC allows, by construction, estimation of the discrepancies between the observed data and the model predictions, with respect to a comprehensive set of statistics. These statistics are not necessarily the same as those used in the acceptance criterion. The resulting discrepancy distributions have been used for selecting models that are in agreement with many aspects of the data simultaneously, and model inconsistency is detected from conflicting and co-dependent summaries. Another quality-control-based method for model selection employs ABC to approximate the effective number of model parameters and the deviance of the posterior predictive distributions of summaries and parameters. The deviance information criterion is then used as measure of <b>model</b> <b>fit.</b> It has also been shown that the models preferred based on this criterion can conflict with those supported by Bayes factors. For this reason, it is useful to combine different methods for model selection to obtain correct conclusions.|$|E

I mean the simple, unsophisticated Conscience, the primary moral element. If I were asked to specify in what quarter lie the grounds of darkest dread, respecting the America of our hopes, I should have to point to this particular. I should demand the invariable application to individuality, this day and any day, of that old, ever-true plumb-rule of persons, eras, nations. Our triumphant modern civilizee, with his all-schooling and his wondrous appliances, will still show himself but an amputation while this deficiency remains. Beyond, (assuming a more hopeful tone,) the vertebration of the manly and womanly personalism of our western world, can only be, and is, indeed, to be, (I hope,) its all-penetrating Religiousness.|$|E

30|$|As {{shown in}} Table  2, c {{value of the}} multiplicative model (0.18) is smaller {{than that of the}} {{additive}} model (0.27) in Changling; however, in Qian’an and Da’an c value of the additive model (0.25, 0.14) is smaller than that of the multiplicative model (0.28, 0.15). Generally speaking, the smaller c is, the better it fits. Thus, the multiplicative <b>model</b> <b>fits</b> Changling better and the additive <b>model</b> <b>fits</b> Qian’an and Da’an better. The multiplicative model is generally suitable for the sequence where seasonal and period components are not obvious (Zhang and Yang 2005). The additive <b>model</b> <b>fits</b> the sequence where seasonal and period components are obvious. On the contrary, the multiplicative model is generally suitable for the sequence where seasonal and period components are not obvious (Zhang and Yang 2005). The soil types in Changling, Qian’an and Da’an are chernozem, quaternary unconsolidated rock and alluvial sand, respectively. Thus, the permeability of Changling is poor and it is good in Qian’an and Da’an. So the groundwater levels in Changling fluctuate slightly and its seasonal and period components are not obvious. As a result, the multiplicative <b>model</b> <b>fits</b> the hydrogeological conditions in Changling better. In the same way of analysis, the additive <b>model</b> <b>fits</b> the hydrogeological conditions in Qian’an and Da’an.|$|R
