5|$|As indicated, hospice is {{frequently}} under-utilized and often not {{taken advantage of}} until very late in a patient's illness. The reasons for this have as <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with financial considerations as with the psycho-social difficulty in choosing hospice. A 2009 study found that with proper case management hospice access could be liberalized without additional costs to insurers.|$|E
5|$|Edward did {{not have}} <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with any of this; after around 1375 he played a limited role in the {{government}} of the realm. Around 29 September 1376 he fell ill with a large abscess. After a brief period of recovery in February 1377, the king died of a stroke at Sheen on 21 June. He was succeeded by his ten-year-old grandson, King Richard II, son of the Black Prince, since the Black Prince himself had died on 8 June 1376.|$|E
5|$|There are countless {{subjects}} that {{are affected by}} the ideas developed in the philosophy of mind. Clear examples of this are the nature of death and its definitive character, the nature of emotion, of perception and of memory. Questions about what a person is and what his or her identity consists of also have <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with the philosophy of mind. There are two {{subjects that}}, in connection with the philosophy of the mind, have aroused special attention: free will and the self.|$|E

5|$|This {{beautiful}} and stylish player was unlucky to emerge {{on the horizon}} of big cricket {{at a time when}} NSW had virtually an international side for its State XI. When his opportunity did come, Alan proved a real stalwart. In addition, his Trumperian style must have influenced for good vast numbers of young boys. Unquestionably, the line of Trumper and Kippax has <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with the grace and elegance which is more frequently associated with players from NSW than from other States.|$|E
5|$|Trying to {{sort out}} what has happened, Hermie goes back to Dorothy's house. Dorothy has fled the island {{in the night and}} an {{envelope}} is tacked to the front door with Hermie's name on it. Inside is a note from Dorothy, saying she hopes he understands she must go back home as there is <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> She assures Hermie she will never forget him, and he will find his way of remembering what happened that night. Her note closes with the hope that Hermie may be spared the senseless tragedies of life.|$|E
5|$|The {{terrain of}} the {{peninsula}} has <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with the geology of the Aegean Region in general. The peninsula was shaped into its current form over several geological eras with the tectonic merging of Paleozoic schist formations, Mesozoic limestone and marble deposits, and finally the accretion of large clays and other sediments during the Neogene period. This is partly because of Turkey's unstable fault block terrain, {{and because of the}} close proximity of the Anatolian-Aegean plate boundary, which generates massifs of mountains all across western Turkey. This includes the peninsula and the mountains surrounding the Büyük Menderes River, known collectively as the Menderes Massif.|$|E
60|$|The class-teaching {{itself at}} last became almost mechanical. It was {{a strain on}} her, an {{exhausting}} wearying strain, always unnatural. But {{there was a certain}} amount of pleasure in the sheer oblivion of teaching, so <b>much</b> work <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> so many children to see after, so <b>much</b> <b>to</b> be <b>done,</b> that one's self was forgotten. When the work had become like habit to her, and her individual soul was left out, had its growth elsewhere, then she could be almost happy.|$|R

5|$|Despite {{these small}} reforms, the 18th century ended with {{continuous}} and unrestrained {{attacks on the}} Court. Although complaints had been common {{since the time of}} Elizabeth I, the problems had become more unrestrained, {{at the same time as}} politically neutral law reformers first arose in any great number. Many critics were barristers of the common law, ignorant of the court's workings, but some, such as Sir Samuel Romilly, had trained as a Chancery advocate and were well aware of the Chancery's procedure. The success of the Code Napoleon and the writings of Jeremy Bentham are seen by academic Duncan Kerly to have had <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with the criticism, and the growing wealth of the country and increasing international trade meant it was crucial that there be a functioning court system for matters of equity. While the upper classes had been struggling with the Court for centuries, and regarded it as a necessary evil, the growing middle and merchant classes were more demanding. With increasing court backlogs, it was clear to many law reformers and politicians that serious reform was needed.|$|E
5|$|Even in {{the first}} couple of years of his company, Goldfaden did not shy away from serious themes: his rained-out {{vaudeville}} in Botoşani had been Di Rekruten (The Recruits), playing with the theme of the press gangs working the streets of that town to conscript young men into the army. Before the end of 1876, Goldfaden had already translated Desolate Island by August von Kotzebue; thus, a play by a German aristocrat and Russian spy became the first non-comic play performed professionally in Yiddish. After his initial burst of mostly vaudevilles and light comedies (although Shmendrik and The Two Kuni-Lemls were reasonably sophisticated plays), Goldfaden would go on to write many serious Yiddish-language plays on Jewish themes, perhaps the most famous being Shulamith, also from 1880. Goldfaden himself suggested that this increasingly serious turn became possible because he had educated his audience. Nahma Sandrow suggests that it may have had equally as <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with the arrival in Romania, {{at the time of the}} Russo-Turkish War, of Russian Jews who had been exposed to more sophisticated Russian language theater. Goldfaden's strong turn toward almost uniformly serious subject matter roughly coincided with bringing his troupe to Odessa.|$|E
25|$|In addition, the indignation that he aroused against Russian {{policy had}} <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> {{with the strong}} anti-Russian feeling, which made the Crimean War possible.|$|E

25|$|A {{mentor to}} other players, Reid had <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with the rises to {{prominence}} of Bev Congdon and Richard Collinge, who would years later feature prominently in a maiden win against England. After his playing and coaching career, Reid became a match referee, {{known for his}} hard-hitting thoughts on the modern game. His son Richard played nine one-day internationals for New Zealand.|$|E
25|$|He had <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> {{with the}} {{responsible}} use of pesticides. He proposed and drafted the first California Insecticide Law in 1906, was largely instrumental in securing its passage in 1911, and administered the law until July 1, 1923. Entomological campaigns which he conducted in California concerned the codling moth, the peach twig-borer, citrus insects, grasshoppers, and citrus white fly eradication.|$|E

25|$|As of the 2000 census, {{the city}} had a total {{population}} of 128,929, but the present population is now estimated to have reached over 200,000 (2013). This rapid expansion had <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with the numerous large, new residential developments in the almost totally undeveloped {{northern part of the}} city, {{as well as with the}} city's aggressive (and highly successful) campaign to annex several unincorporated, but developed, San Bernardino county island areas in 2006–2007.|$|E
25|$|In 1970, he {{was given}} his first parish assignment, the obscure barrio of Banay-banay.

Up to now, the people in the place which he served for two-and-a-half years remember the tall, kindly priest.|$|E

He proposed marriage to her at the beginning of 1961, but she refused with the explanation that she did not love him and was afraid to marry an American. Some researchers believe that German's rejection of Oswald's marriage proposal may have had <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with his disillusionment with life in the Soviet Union and his decision to return to the United States.|$|E
