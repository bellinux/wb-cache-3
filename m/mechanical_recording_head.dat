50|$|A <b>recording</b> <b>head</b> is the {{physical}} interface between a recording apparatus and a moving <b>recording</b> medium. <b>Recording</b> <b>heads</b> are generally classified according to {{the physical}} principle {{that allows them to}} impress their data upon their medium. A <b>recording</b> <b>head</b> is often mechanically paired with a playback head, which, though proximal to, is often discrete from the <b>record</b> <b>head.</b>|$|R
40|$|High-density digital data, {{collected}} periodically or randomly from {{multiplicity of}} sensors, are recorded by subminiature recorder. Magnetic <b>recording</b> <b>head</b> is energized with suitable pulsatile signals to reverse polarization on magnetically-sensitive tape while tape is immobilized at <b>recording</b> <b>head.</b> Prior to next recording, set tape so new area of tape is at <b>recording</b> <b>head...</b>|$|R
25|$|In 1956, Shure {{moved its}} {{corporate}} headquarters to Hartrey Avenue in Evanston, Illinois, where it remained for 47 years. Beginning in 1956, Shure manufactured magnetic tape <b>recording</b> <b>heads</b> {{and two years}} later, the company announced it was ready to mass-produce 4-ch <b>recording</b> <b>heads.</b> By 1964, however, Shure announced {{it would no longer}} produce tape <b>recording</b> <b>heads</b> due to increased competition.|$|R
50|$|The {{recorder}} has {{a double}} <b>recording</b> <b>head,</b> {{similar to a}} two-track recorder. Each of the two cores of the <b>recording</b> <b>head</b> <b>records</b> both the audio signal, and the pilot tone. The audio signal to be recorded is applied identically to both cores of the <b>recording</b> <b>head,</b> and the pilot tone sine wave is applied in a push-pull arrangement (180 degrees out-of-phase).|$|R
5000|$|While 3490E data {{cartridges}} are {{the same}} dimensions as 3480 cartridges, the tape media is the same only longer. 3490E tape is optimized for 36-track <b>recording</b> <b>heads,</b> instead of 18-track <b>recording</b> <b>heads.</b> Nevertheless, some 3480 tape drives can record on 3490E media.|$|R
40|$|We {{have used}} superpara{{magnetic}} {{magnetic force microscopy}} (MFM) tips to obtain high spatial resolution MFM images of <b>recording</b> <b>heads.</b> Profiles of the magnetic field gradient above a thin-film <b>recording</b> <b>head</b> under 3 mA bias current to the head and various tip-head distance conditions are presented. At a low tip-head distance, the gap width, gap location, and gap-field structure can be well resolved in these MFM images. Superparamagnetic tips show promise for the magnetic imaging of <b>recording</b> <b>heads</b> with gap widths below 200 nm...|$|R
40|$|AbstractChemical {{mechanical}} nano grinding is a {{key technology}} in magnetic <b>recording</b> <b>head</b> manufacturing process. The magnetic <b>recording</b> <b>head</b> {{is an important component}} of hard disk drive which is used for reading and writing data in to the media. Thin film of metal alloys and metal oxides are fabricated on ceramic substrate called wafer to create the <b>recording</b> <b>heads.</b> In order to control surface properties of the <b>recording</b> <b>head,</b> the precise chemical mechanical nano grinding process is used. In this process the <b>recording</b> <b>heads</b> are treated to archive the designed surface properties by using lubricants to control the selectivity of material removal. This research studied the effect of additives in ethylene glycol based lubricant on the selectivity of material removal. Two additives were added in ethylene glycol to create the lubricant and their pHs were measured. The material removal rate can be predicted by measuring wettability of lubricant on surface of material. Nickel iron alloy (NiFe) was used to represent the surface material of magnetic shield of the <b>recording</b> <b>head.</b> The wettability of lubricants were measured on NiFe surface by contact angle measurement technique to show the selectivity on each NiFe. The results were compared with the atomic force micrograph of material after lapping process and show that the selective removal of material can be occurred by this method...|$|R
50|$|The {{magnetic}} recording was demonstrated in principle {{as early as}} 1898 by Valdemar Poulsen in his telegraphone. Magnetic wire recording, and its successor, magnetic tape recording, involve {{the use of a}} magnetizable medium which moves past a <b>recording</b> <b>head.</b> An electrical signal, which is analogous to the sound that is to be recorded, is fed to the <b>recording</b> <b>head,</b> inducing a pattern of magnetization similar to the signal. A playback head (which may be the same as the <b>recording</b> <b>head)</b> can then pick up the changes in the magnetic field from the tape and convert them into an electrical signal.|$|R

As of 2006 this {{is by far the}} most dominant type of head in use.|$|R

5000|$|Coding was {{accomplished}} via mechanical lift arms and latching bails {{added to the}} typewriter's existing mechanical linkages in place for print-action. When a key was depressed, up to 8 affiliated lift arms were [...] "caught" [...] on latching bails which in turn connected 8 coding switches to the <b>recording</b> <b>head.</b> A commutator, powered by the internal drive motor, would momentarily complete the power circuit through the coding switches to the <b>recording</b> <b>head</b> before advancing the tape to the next recording position. When not encoding, a resistor balance network kept the <b>recording</b> <b>head</b> in an erase mode unless a rewind operation was commanded. This ensured a clearly defined magnetic space between bit patterns. Additional circuits prevented opening of the tape loading door once a tape was loaded.|$|R

50|$|The {{original}} Super 8 film {{release was}} a silent system only, but in 1973 a {{sound on film}} version was released. The film with sound had a magnetic soundtrack and came in larger cartridges than the original cartridge {{in order to accommodate}} the sound <b>recording</b> <b>head</b> in the film path. Sound film requires a longer film path (for smoothing the film movement before it reaches the <b>recording</b> <b>head),</b> and a second aperture for the <b>recording</b> <b>head.</b> Sound cameras were compatible with silent cartridges, but not vice versa. Sound film was typically filmed at a speed of 18 or 24 frames per second. Kodak discontinued the production of Super 8 sound film in 1997 citing environmental regulations as the reason. The adhesive used to bond the magnetic track to the film was environmentally hazardous.|$|R

50|$|A <b>record</b> <b>head,</b> on {{the other}} hand, has a gap {{typically}} six times larger {{than that of the}} replay head, this gives a larger flux to magnetise the tape. The ideal gap size in a cassette deck are; wide <b>record</b> <b>head</b> gap and narrow playback head. The larger gap does not affect frequency response because the 'image' is largely made by the trailing edge of the gap. A combined record/replay head has a compromise size gap typically three times that of a replay only head.|$|R

By later drawing the wire across the same or a similar head while the head is not being supplied with an electrical signal, the varying magnetic field presented by the passing wire induces a similarly varying electric current in the head, recreating the original signal at a reduced level.|$|R

50|$|Magnetic {{recording}} {{was demonstrated}} in principle {{as early as}} 1898 by Valdemar Poulsen in his telegraphone.
