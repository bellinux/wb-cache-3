40|$|This {{information}} kit developed {{by researchers at}} the National Drug and Alcohol Research Centre at UNSW provides a step by step guide to the evidence for <b>medically</b> <b>assisted</b> <b>treatment</b> for heroin dependence as well as answering commonly asked questions. Heroin or opioid dependence can be treated with medication and psychosocial support, also known as medication-assisted treatment of opioid dependence (MATOD). The most common medicines used for MATOD in Australia are methadone, buprenorphine and naltrexone. There is a strong body of research that underpins the use of these and other medicines, but NDARC’s Professor Kate Dolan says often people are uncertain about the role of MATOD in treating heroin or opioid use and dependence. “Heroin dependence can lead to serious health, social and economic consequences for users, their families and society,” said Professor Dolan. “The more information and easy to understand research evidence we can provide for affected people and for the wider community, the better outcomes for those seeking help. ” This Information Kit includes two booklets. The first booklet answers some of the most frequently asked questions about MATOD and addresses common misunderstandings, while the second booklet provides a review of evidence of MATOD...|$|E
40|$|Class of 2014 AbstractSpecific Aims: To {{show that}} Suboxone is more {{effective}} than no MAT (<b>Medically</b> <b>Assisted</b> <b>Treatment)</b> in opioid dependence. Additionally, that Suboxone is as effective as methadone in MAT. Methods: This study was a retrospective chart review of probationer’s case files at The Pima County Adult Probation Office. Treatment groups included: Suboxone (n= 16), methadone (n= 15), and no MAT control group (n= 15). The total sample size was 46 probationers. The primary dependent variables were the number of negative events and time to a negative event (i. e. missed/positive urinalysis, violation of terms of probation). The secondary outcome variables were the number of positive events and time to a positive event (i. e. finding employment, documented social/family improvement). Data analysis utilized chi-square for categorical data while t-tests were used for continuous data. Main Results: 46 probationers of Pima County with violations related to possession or use of an opioid substance were analyzed. No {{significant differences were found between}} Suboxone and placebo (no MAT) for any of the four outcomes (number of negative events p= 0. 82; time to first negative event p= 0. 41; number of positive events p= 0. 93; time to first positive event p= 0. 45). No significant differences were found between Suboxone and methadone as well (number of negative events p= 0. 34; time to first negative event p= 0. 52; number of positive events p= 0. 93; time to first positive event p= 0. 56). Conclusion: This study found no statistically significant differences between no MAT and Suboxone nor Suboxone and methadone. Differences in baseline characteristics between groups were found that could characterize the Suboxone group as being more severely ill...|$|E

40|$|Hepatitis C virus (HCV) {{infection}} is endemic {{in people who}} inject drugs (PWID), with prevalence estimates above 60 percent for PWID in the United States. Previous modeling studies suggest that direct acting antiviral (DAA) treatment can lower overall prevalence in this population, but treatment is often delayed until the onset of advanced liver disease (fibrosis stage 3 or later) due to cost. Lower cost interventions featuring syringe access (SA) and <b>medically</b> <b>assisted</b> <b>treatment</b> (MAT) for addiction {{are known to be}} less costly, but have shown mixed results in lowering HCV rates below current levels. Little is known about the potential synergistic effects of combining DAA and MAT treatment, and large-scale tests of combined interventions are rare. While simulation experiments can reveal likely long-term effects, most prior simulations have been performed on closed populations of model agents [...] a scenario quite different from the open, mobile populations known to most health agencies. This paper uses data from the Centers for Disease Control's National HIV Behavioral Surveillance project, IDU round 3, collected in New York City in 2012 by the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene to parameterize simulations of open populations. Our results show that, in an open population, SA/MAT by itself has only small effects on HCV prevalence, while DAA treatment by itself can significantly lower both HCV and HCV-related advanced liver disease prevalence. More importantly, the simulation experiments suggest that cost effective synergistic combinations of the two strategies can dramatically reduce HCV incidence. We conclude that adopting SA/MAT implementations alongside DAA interventions can {{play a critical role in}} reducing the long-term consequences of ongoing infection...|$|E

40|$|The article {{deals with}} the question: ‘Is it morally {{acceptable}} for terminally ill Christians to voluntarily request <b>medically</b> <b>assisted</b> suicide or euthanasia?’ After a brief discussion of relevant changes in the moral landscape over the last century, two influential, but opposite views on the normative basis for the Christian ethical assessment of <b>medically</b> <b>assisted</b> suicide and voluntary euthanasia are critically discussed.

40|$|In 2005, Serbia {{enacted a}} new Family Act, {{which is also}} applied in Vojvodina Regarding family planning, the Family Act has {{introduced}} a reform of the provisions on parentage in cases of <b>medically</b> <b>assisted</b> conception. Regarding motherhood, the basic rule is that the mother {{is considered to be}} the woman that gave birth to the child, regardless of whether she is the genetic mother or whether the genetic material of another woman has been used. As for fatherhood, the basic rule is that the father is considered to be the husband or cohabiting partner of the mother, if he has given his written consent to artificial insemination. This rule applies both in cases of AIH (artificial insemination with husband/cohabiting partner sperm) and AID (artificial insemination with donor sperm). This paper deals with the issue of surrogate motherhood in European countries, as well. The regulation of the Family Act on parentage in cases of <b>medically</b> <b>assisted</b> conception presupposes the application of certain techniques of medical conception.

Data collection and analysis: Five relevant studies were identified. These included two RCTs (93 participants), and three prospective controlled trials (360 participants). These were assessed independently by two review authors for quality and validity. The small number of studies and the heterogeneity of the data meant that a quantitative analysis was not possible, so a description of the main findings was included only. Main results: One study found that sedation and myoclonus (involuntary contractions of muscles) were improved more in the intervention group (28 -hydration, 23 -placebo). Another study found that dehydration was significantly higher in the non-hydration group, but that some fluid retention symptoms (pleural effusion, peripheral oedema and ascites) were significantly higher in the hydration group (59 -hydration group, 167 -non-hydration group).

40|$|Aims and {{objectives}} To devise {{a set of}} indices representative of a latent dimension of delivery perception, aimed at the assessment of birth experience after both spontaneous and <b>medically</b> <b>assisted</b> conception. Background Birth experience is of great importance for its prognostic value for the woman and newborn's psychophysical well-being, especially after the experience of assisted reproduction technology. Up to date, a delivery perception assessment measure targeted to both spontaneously and <b>medically</b> <b>assisted</b> conceiving women does not exist yet. Design Measure development and psychometric analysis; quantitative and qualitative analysis of women's delivery experience measures. Methods Thirty-one indices characterising seven relevant aspects of birth perception were devised from the literature and evaluated on a 4 -point Likert-type scale by 98 childbearing women (54 spontaneously and 44 <b>medically</b> <b>assisted</b> conceiving) in the 24 – 48 hours postpartum time frame. Women's obstetric history information was also collected. The dimension psychometric definition was pursued within a latent trait perspective, by applying the many-facet Rasch measurement model. Results A latent delivery perception dimension composed of 18 valid and reliable indices, qualifying six labour and delivery perception clinical aspects, was identified. <b>Medically</b> <b>assisted</b> conceiving women evidenced a more positive birth perception, but when analysing each index, they showed peculiar intense worries about themselves and their baby's health, even if they felt more satisfied, safer and stronger in almost every labour and birth aspect. Conclusions The delivery perception dimension integrates all relevant birth experience aspects in 18 easy-to-administer indices and provides a valid, reliable and feasible assessment tool for both the clinical practice and research purposes. Relevance to clinical practice The delivery perception dimension clearly discriminates between women's types of conception and identifies relevant differences in their birth experience, which are interesting for their clinical implications within a prognostic and intervention perspective of support provision in the early postpartum period...|$|R
