40|$|If we glance {{again at}} the {{classification}} proposed by Andrewes and Horder we are struck at once {{by the fact that}} no hard and fast differences in fermentative properties characterize the various groups, and that the authors prefer to have recourse to the most frequent habitat of the organisms and to chemical tests, rather than to confine themselves to the latter method alone. From what has been said earlier in this paper, it becomes clear at once that the results gained by these authors are not convincing, for in their work they have failed to use the most favorable medium for growth of the organisms. And thus it can hardly be doubted that different reactions might have been obtained, under the conditions adopted by us. How otherwise could the fact be explained that of thirty-four of their pneumococci only eight fermented inulin. We had a similar experience while using the plain broth which led us to reject it as an unfavorable medium. Further, all our pneumococci fermented lactose with great rapidity. Andrewes and Horder report that eight of their series left lactose unchanged. Taking our own tests into consideration we find that working with but a small number of carbohydrates we were able to find six different varieties of streptococci among only 33 pathogenic strains. Which of the various substances is to decide us in the grouping of the organisms? Would we not find even greater variations from the most common type (see No. 4 in table) if we were to extend our tests over a larger series of chemical agents? These questions are difficult to answer and only extended experimentation with a great many streptococci and many media will clear up the doubtful points. In concluding it may be stated: 1. Streptococci vary considerably in their ability to produce acid from various carbohydrates. 2. Chemical tests of this kind should be made only in the media which are most favorable for the growth of the organisms. 3. Our results gave us six groups of streptococci, when tested upon dextrose, levulose, galactose, maltose, saccharose, lactose, inulin, dextrin and <b>mannite,</b> viz. : Those fermenting (1) all; (2) all but mannite; (3) all but inulin; (4) all but inulin and mannite; (5) all but inulin and lactose; and (6) all but inulin, <b>mannite</b> and saccharose. 4. In view of the comparatively small number of streptococci employed we are hardly warranted in making a definite classification. Perhaps a larger series of tests upon the media employed will enable us to divide streptococci into distinct classes characterized by certain fixed fermentative properties...|$|E

After acclimatizing to 78 % relative humidity (rH), inoculation of fungi and/or mites followed. Water adsorption of the 10 x 10 x 0. 6 cm pieces was slower than expected, equilibrium was reached after 6 to 8 weeks. Visual mould growth (Aspergillus repens or Penicillium chrysogenum) appeared on soiled pieces after 8 weeks to 5 months, depending on the prevailing humidity. Soiling with Marmite caused a more dense fungal growth than soiling with juice. Storage mites (Glycyphagus domesticus) developed exponentially on all mouldy pieces resulting in a median value of 234 mites on wood and 404 on gypsum 8 weeks after incubation of 50 mites, whereas house dust mites (Derniatophagoides pteronyssinus) survived only barely (less than 10 mites after 8 weeks).

40|$|At {{the outset}} of the present studies of fowl cholera: {{attention}} was directed to the etiological agent, Past~uret ~ av/c/da. I The early investigations of this organism are chiefly of historical significance; reports of its biological characteristics, its range of variation and adaptability, and indeed, of the means for its exact identification are incomplete and contradictory. The unsatisfactory state of this information can be emphasized by a brief summary of the literature. Following the early investigations of Perroncito (1), Tonssaint (2), Pasteur (3), and Kitt (4), P. avicida, together with s{rnilax bacteria from other a nlmal hosts, were placed together and designated the "Pasteurella" or "hemorrhagic septicemia " group (5). But later investigators disagreed as to the properties of these organisms. Thus, P. av/c/da, according to Sehirop (6) and others (7 - 12), ferments dextrose, saccharose, and <b>mannite</b> without the production of gas. Kaupp and Dearstyne (13), on the other hand, found dextrose alone to be acidified; Tanaka (14), maltose, in addition to the above; I-Iiggins (15), acid production on lactose litmus agar. Indol formation in peptone water was observed by all the investigators mentioned, save Kaupp and Dearstyne (13) and Lignieres (16). Theobald Smith and others (17 - 18) report the organism to be highly virulent for fowl and rabbits; Turner (19) regards this as a diagnostic criterion. Wide discrepancies in results of serological studies are indicated by the reports of Bushnell (20), which state that less than 50 per cent of the strains examined were capable of acting as antigens, while Fitch and Nelson (21), on the other hand, divided their strains into definite groups according to their agglutination in specific sera.

40|$|These {{experiments}} were undertaken {{to determine the}} effects of liming on certain groups of soil bacteria in a typical Wisconsin drift soil. They justified the following general conclusions: 1. Applications of lime up to three tons per acre lead to an increase in the numbers of bacteria developing on 2 ̆ 2 modified synthetic 2 ̆ 2 agar. They also produce an increase in ammonification, nitrification, and in nitrogen fixation when these processes are tested by the beaker method. These increases are in all cases almost proportionate to the amount of lime applied. 2. Natural increases in numbers of bacteria tend to obscure the effects of applications of lime, while natural decreases make them more pronounced. 3. Peptone solutions do not permit of the determining of the largest number of bacteria which will destroy humus with the production of ammonia. 4. The beaker method, with dried blood or cottonseed meal for ammonification, with ammonium sulfate or dried blood for nitrification, and with <b>mannite</b> for nitrogen fixation, is eminently satisfactory. 5. The ammonification of dried blood or of cottonseed meal runs parallel with the numbers of bacteria while there is very little relation between the ammonification of peptone solutions and numbers. 6. Increased nitrification leads to slight accumulations of nitrates in the soil. 7. Natural accumulations of nitrates in the soil tend to obscure the differences due to the lime treatment. 8. The solution method for nitrogen fixation is quite unreliable. 9. Applications of lime increase the yield of oats; one-half and one ton per acre very slightly, but two and three tons to quite a large extent. 10. Applications of lime up to three tons per acre increase the nitrogen content of the oats crop more rapidly than the yield itself...|$|E
40|$|Various {{carbohydrates}} {{have been}} added to the fluid cultures of different strains of spirochetes in order to determine the behavior of the latter toward the carbohydrates. In the present experiment, amygdalin, arabinose, beerwort, dextrin, galactose, glycogen, glucose, inulin, lactose, levulose, maltose, <b>mannite,</b> raffinose, saccharose, and starch were tested with seven strains of Treponema pallidum and one strain each of Treponema calligyrum, Treponema microdentium, Treponema mucosum, and Spirochata refringens. The results may be summarized as follows: 1. In the media containing glycogen and glucose, Treponema microdentium did not grow as vigorously as in other sugar media, and an earlier degeneration set in. One strain of the pallidum and the calligyrum and mucosum showed a poor growth in the glycogen medium. Similarly, there was little growth in the second transfer of these spirochetes in the glucose medium. The growth of the spirochetes in the media containing carbohydrates other than those Just mentioned was generally good, and no difference could be distinguished between these and the control cultures without any carbohydrate. The only phenomenon which might be interpreted as indicating a favorable influence of these media upon growth was the abundant growth of the mucosum, which showed uniform length, regular curves, and active motility somewhat better than in the sugar-free medium. 2. The height of acidity was found in the cultures containing glycogen and glucose in the microdentium, amounting to 0. 1 N 4. 8 cc. for 10 cc. of the fluid culture. In the other sugar media the acidity varied between 0. 1 N 2 cc. and 0. 1 N 3. 2 cc. for the same amount. In the control cultures, the acidity fluctuated from 0. 1 N 0. 8 cc. to 0. 1 N 2 cc. There was no visible alteration in the appearance of the media after the spirochetes had grown for 3 or 4 weeks. In the case of Treponema microdenlium, a slight opalescence developed in the glycogen and glucose media after several weeks' standing, but there was no precipitation or coagulation of the proteins of the culture media. 3. There was no unusual morphological change in the spirochetes grown in the media containing any of the carbohydrates employed. The only phenomena which should be mentioned are (a) the frequent presence of the terminal appendages (or projections) in the refringens, and in most of the pallidum strains, and (b) the appearance of minute, retractile spherical bodies along the side of the spirochetes in the microdenlium cultivated in the glucose or glycogen media. Judging from the earlier degeneration of the species in the above mentioned media, these peculiar bodies may be interpreted as indicating a phase of plasmoptysis associated with the unfavorable surroundings prior to degeneration. Experimental evidence was not found for considering these spherules as a resistant or spore form of the spirochete...|$|E
