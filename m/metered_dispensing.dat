40|$|The need to <b>meter</b> and <b>dispense</b> dry powders or {{mixtures}} of powders {{occurs in a}} wide range of processes and industries. These include the preparation of pharmaceutical products, the mixing of pigments for paints, inks and glazes, the incorporation of processing additives and pigments into polymer processing lines such as extrusion and in solid freeforming processes. This short review identifies the common features of powder handling in these widely different areas and seeks to distinguish and classify the various principles. Examples are given of designs that span a range of industries. This review is stimulated by current developments in the selective laser sintering of powder assemblies; a solid freeforming pathway for polymer, ceramic and metal prototyping and manufacturing. The goal is to find <b>metering</b> and <b>dispensing</b> systems that are effective in providing the spatial arrangement of composition. Dispensing methods that can produce patterns of different powders are sought. Selective laser sintering of powder assemblies can then be extended from a method of rendering shape to one in which both shape and composition are delivered directly into the external world from a computer fil...|$|R

40|$|A {{multiple}} powder <b>metering</b> and <b>dispensing</b> device {{has been}} constructed to create functionally graded materials by the solid free-forming {{process known as}} selective laser sintering. The device makes use of vertical open tubes through which the flow rate of dry powder {{is controlled by the}} characteristics of acoustic vibration in the 20 – 200 Hz region. Flow is initiated by high amplitude ‘attack’ waveforms and stops when vibration ceases. This simple but effective device raises many questions about the factors that cause flow arrest. The effects of tube diameter, amplitude, mechanical damping and particle size distribution are investigated. By selecting optimum parameters for a metallic powder, the overflow (discharge from the open tube after silence) was brought below 1 mg...|$|R
40|$|The {{creation}} of three dimensional functional graded materials by powder processing methods requires {{the capability to}} arrange a sequence of two dimensional images that can be presented to a solid freeforming device. Planar stacking methods can only achieve a one dimensional gradient. We describe the acoustic control of powder <b>metering</b> and <b>dispensing</b> valves in which the flow rate and switching of powders from a capillary can be controlled using the frequency and amplitude of acoustic vibration from a computer sound card. An orchestra of such valves {{can be used to}} pattern layers of powder on the building platform which forms part of a 3 -axis table in the Selective Laser Sintering (SLS) process.

40|$|The {{flow rate}} of powder {{in an open}} {{vertical}} capillary subject to transverse acoustic vibration is predicted using an explicit equation by considering the intermittent arrest and stasis of particles subject to acceleration in a field. The analysis rests solely on physical quantities that are easily measured by experiment. The calculation is supported by measured flow rate and by direct observation using high speed photography. Increasing the horizontal component of acceleration of a particle should not influence rate of descent but the overall time of flight is increased both by re-initiation of descent after collision at the wall and by fixed stationary periods on each cycle. Since flow stops when acoustic vibration stops, the vibrating tube is a valve that provides computer-controlled powder flow <b>metering,</b> mixing and <b>dispensing.</b> The valve is capable of adjusting the flow rate with a ratio of minimum to maximum flow rate of 0. 1.

Movie World, WhiteWater World, Currumbin Wildlife Sanctuary, David Fleay Wildlife Park, Australian Outback Spectacular, and Paradise Country. Since the opening of {{what was then the}} world's highest residential tower in 2005 (it is now the fifth highest), the Q1 building has been a destination for tourists and locals alike. It is the second highest public vantage point in the southern hemisphere after the Eureka Tower in Melbourne. The observation deck at level 77 is the highest of its kind in Queensland and offers views in all directions, from Brisbane to Byron Bay. It towers over the Surfers Paradise skyline, with the observation deck 230 metres (755 feet) high, and the spire extending nearly another hundred metres up. In total, the Q1 is 322.5 metres (1058 feet) high. Another famous tourist attraction are the Surfers Paradise Meter Maids, instituted in 1965 to put a positive spin on new parking regulations. To avoid tickets being issued for expired parking, the <b>Meter</b> Maids <b>dispense</b> coins into the meter and leave a calling card under the windscreen wiper of the vehicle.

40|$|New {{opportunities}} for solid freeforming (SFF) will emerge when {{not just the}} shape but the spatial arrangement of composition can be rendered from a computer file. This paper describes a method for dispensing programmed mixtures of dry powders. It provides both on/off and flow rate control in open capillaries using acoustic vibration. In a glass capillary attached to an electromagnetic transducer, the wave characteristics of the forced vibration control both flow rate and switching of powder flow. The flow rate of powder can be predicted by an explicit model {{on the basis of}} intermittent arrest and stasis of particles in the gravitational field. Forced vibration can reduce the flow rate by a factor of 0. 1. Since flow stops when acoustic vibration stops, the vibrating tube is a valve that provides computer controlled powder flow <b>metering,</b> mixing and <b>dispensing.</b> The effects of acoustic frequency, amplitude, tube diameter, mechanical damping and particle size distribution have been investigated.

40|$|The Novartis Institutes for BioMedical Research is {{the drug}} {{discovery}} arm of Novartis Pharmaceuticals. Drug discovery {{is generally considered}} to be the primary driver for success in the pharmaceutical industry. Success {{in the early stages of}} drug discovery relies on dependable, innovative, disease related high-throughput screening of biological compounds and the creation of a screening deck of highly diverse, proprietary chemical compounds. In contrast with many of its peers, Novartis relies strongly on combinatorial chemistry to populate its screening deck. The Chemical Libraries (CLI) group is responsible for this approach at Novartis and delivers more than 100, 000 compounds per year to the Novartis Compound Archive. Since the introduction of high-throughput screening and combinatorial chemistry techniques, the bottleneck in many drug discovery processes has shifted to the roles that support these high-volume techniques. The aim of this thesis is to provide a general collection of short and long-term suggestions for process improvement in the chemical supply process. This process includes compound search and ordering, order fulfillment, and compound delivery, was investigated. (cont.) The chemical supply process is responsible for delivering compounds to chemists that would otherwise cost hundreds of dollars per compound with a delay of between one and four weeks, or would require a multiple day synthesis procedure. Stockroom automation, content and process scope, and physical layout were all evaluated. The following major conclusions were developed as a result of the research. First, the procedures for using the compound archives and libraries must be clearly presented to the end user so that s/he is fully able to utilize and contribute to the libraries. Second, compound libraries should be conglomerated into one large library that is also responsible for compound acquisition. Third, compound metering for intermediates does not appear to be an effective use of resources and should be severely restricted following the successful implementation of the SciQuest compound management system. Finally, compound libraries should use automated pick and place systems but <b>metering</b> and <b>dispensing</b> systems should remain manual. by Jordan M. Bedford. Thesis (S. M.)

40|$|This paper {{evaluates the}} {{potential}} of 3 D printing, a semi-automated additive prototyping technology, {{as a means to}} design and prototype a sample-to-device interface, amenable to diagnostics in limited-resource settings, where speed, accuracy and user-friendly design are critical components. As a test case, we built and validated an interlock meter-mix device for accurately metering and lysing human urine samples for use in downstream nucleic acid amplification. Two plungers and a multivalve generated and controlled fluid flow through the device and demonstrate the utility of 3 D printing to create leak-free seals. Device operation consists of three simple steps that must be performed sequentially, eliminating manual pipetting and vortexing to provide rapid (5 to 10 s) and accurate metering and mixing. Bretherton's prediction was applied, using the bond number to guide a design that prevents potentially biohazardous samples from leaking from the device. We employed multi-material 3 D printing technology, which allows composites with rigid and elastomeric properties to be printed as a single part. To validate the meter-mix device with a clinically relevant sample, we used urine spiked with inactivated Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae. A downstream nucleic acid amplification by quantitative PCR (qPCR) confirmed there was no statistically significant difference between samples metered and mixed using the standard protocol and those prepared with the meter-mix device, showing the 3 D-printed device could accurately <b>meter,</b> mix and <b>dispense</b> a human urine sample without loss of nucleic acids. Although there are some limitations to 3 D printing capabilities (e. g. dimension limitations related to support material used in the printing process), the advantages of customizability, modularity and rapid prototyping illustrate the utility of 3 D printing for developing sample-to-device interfaces for diagnostics...|$|R
40|$|For {{the past}} two decades, flow cytometry has been widely used as a {{powerful}} analysis tool for the diagnosis of many diseases due to its ability to count, characterize and sort cells. However, conventional flow cytometers are often bulky, expensive and complicated because sophisticated fluidic, electronic and optical systems are required to realize the functions of flow cytometry. The high cost and the complexity in operation and maintenance associated with flow cytometers {{as well as the}} large size have limited its use. In recent years, the rapid development of microfluidics-based lab-on-a-chip technology has created a new pathway for flow cytometry. Microfluidic devices allow for the integration of multiple liquid handling processes required in the diagnostic assays, such as pumping, <b>metering,</b> sampling, <b>dispensing,</b> sequential loading and washing. These lab-on-a-chip solutions have been recognized as an opportunity to bring portable, accurate and sensitive diagnostic tests to the flow cytometry. However, most current microfluidic flow cytometry devices are micro- only in the microfluidic chip, the rest of most apparatuses are still large and costly, usually involving tubes, microscopes, lasers and mechanical pumps. Therefore, the objective {{of this study is to}} develop a novel lab-on-a-chip system based on the electrokinetically-induced pressure-driven flow and dual-wavelength fluorescent detection, which lights a promising pathway for making a real portable, compact, low-cost microfluidic flow cytometry device. In this study, the core of this microfluidic system is the custom-designed PDMS (polydimethylsiloxane) microchip. A novel method was applied to generate the electrokinetically-induced pressure-driven flow in a T-shaped microchannel using parameters settings that had been optimized by numerical study. This method combined both the electrokinetic pumping force and the pressure pumping force to eliminate their shortcomings associated with the use of each force alone. This is the fundamental of my study. By using this microchip, the size of the fluidic control subsystem is reduced significantly. Furthermore, the dual-wavelength fluorescent detection strategy is proposed in this thesis. On the optical detection side, excitation lights of two different wavelengths are provided by a single LED (light-emitting diode) from one side of the microchannel. Then the two emission lights are captured individually by two photo-detectors placed on the top and the bottom of the microchip. Compared with other microfluidic detection devices reported in the literatures that use lasers or PMTs (Photomultiplier tubes), this design allows for a significant reduction of 90 % in the volume and cost. As another important part of my thesis research, a novel flow focusing method that allows the hydrodynamic focusing in a T-shaped microchannel with two sheath flows is developed. This method solves the biggest obstacle which exists in current microfluidic flow cytometry devices. In this method, no external pumps, valves and tubing are involved in the system. Although substantial progress has been made in current microfluidic flow cytometry, there is still a need for a low-cost, compact, portable microfluidic devices, especially in low-resource settings as well as the developing world for POC (point-of-care) diagnosis and analysis. This thesis work has made a great achievement towards the final goal. 4 month...|$|R
