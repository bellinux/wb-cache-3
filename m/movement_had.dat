5|$|Although the <b>movement</b> <b>had</b> {{split into}} several {{denominations}} after Smith's death in 1844, most members aligned themselves with Brigham Young and The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS). Under Young's leadership, about 14,000 Mormon citizens of Nauvoo {{set out to}} find a new home in the West.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} 1922 the Khilafat <b>{{movement}}</b> <b>had</b> collapsed. Turkey's Ataturk {{had ended}} the Caliphate, Khilafat movement ended, and Muslim support for Gandhi largely evaporated. Muslim leaders and delegates abandoned Gandhi and his Congress. Hindu-Muslim communal conflicts reignited. Deadly religious riots re-appeared in numerous cities, with 91 in United Provinces of Agra and Oudh alone.|$|E
5|$|All <b>movement</b> <b>had</b> been {{restricted}} to night time, {{culminating in a}} general move forwards {{on the eve of}} battle. On the night of 18/19 September, the 4th and 5th Cavalry Divisions moved forward behind the infantry, while the Australian Mounted Division moved up to Sarona. Here the three divisions concentrated, with their supplies carried in massed horse-drawn transport and on long camel trains, clogging the roads. The divisions carried one iron ration and two days' special emergency rations per man, and 21 pounds (9.5kg) of grain per horse, all carried on the horse, with an additional day's grain per horse carried on the first line transport limbered wagons.|$|E
50|$|In the Jewish diaspora, {{the nature}} of Zionist youth <b>movements</b> <b>has</b> varied in time and place. During periods when the general Zionist <b>movement</b> <b>has</b> been strong, such as that {{preceding}} the Six-Day War, <b>movements</b> <b>have</b> been particularly active. As well as acting towards Zionist causes, the <b>movements</b> <b>have</b> been seen as an important Jewish education and socialisation when {{it has not been}} otherwise available. Hence, with the development of stronger community structures, youth <b>movements</b> <b>have</b> often played a lesser role. Many youth, particularly in the large Jewish population of North America, have opted for Jewish social groups without ideological pursuits.|$|R
50|$|The Berneuchen <b>movement</b> <b>has</b> put {{emphasis}} e.g. on Bible reading, daily {{office and}} celebration of Eucharist. The <b>movement</b> <b>has</b> {{been an important}} field of Christian ecumenism.|$|R

5|$|Although {{the seeds}} of both {{proactive}} government repression against the Puerto Rican independence <b>movement</b> <b>had</b> been planted before the Grito de Lares, and its aftermath only guaranteed the surge of autonomism as a political alternative in the island, the level of cultural and social development of a collective Puerto Rican conscience was almost {{a direct consequence of}} the event. To put it simply, if there is any nationalistic sentiment in Puerto Rico in the present day, almost all of it {{can be traced back to}} Betances and his political work.|$|E
5|$|An {{internal}} {{attempt was}} made to discredit Gomułka's leadership, but there were aspects of the ongoing witch hunt which he found to be to his advantage and he tolerated it until the societal damage wrecked by the Moczar <b>movement</b> <b>had</b> become irreversible. Gomułka's regime reasserted itself and was saved by a combination of international and domestic factors, including the Moczar faction's inability to take over the party and state apparatus. The Soviet Union, now led by Leonid Brezhnev, was preoccupied with the crisis in Czechoslovakia and not inclined to support personal changes in the Polish leadership.|$|E
5|$|At 1:00a.m. on February 14, Floyd held {{a council}} {{of war in}} his {{headquarters}} at the Dover Hotel. There was general agreement that Fort Donelson was probably untenable. General Pillow was designated to lead a breakout attempt, evacuate the fort, and march to Nashville. Troops were moved behind the lines and the assault readied, {{but at the last}} minute a Union sharpshooter killed one of Pillow's aides. Pillow, normally quite aggressive in battle, was unnerved and announced that since their <b>movement</b> <b>had</b> been detected, the breakout had to be postponed. Floyd was furious at this change of plans, but by then it was too late in the day to proceed.|$|E
50|$|The <b>{{movement}}</b> <b>has</b> {{been known}} as a non-violent Islamic movement for decades. The <b>movement</b> <b>has</b> organised peaceful pro-Palestinian demonstrations {{on an annual basis}} across Nigeria for over 33 years, primarily in the state of Kaduna. The <b>movement's</b> gatherings <b>have</b> been attacked several times by both Boko Haram and the Nigerian army.|$|R

50|$|The <b>movement</b> <b>has</b> {{been sued}} by former members seeking to recover their {{financial}} assets, which {{were required to}} be donated when they joined. The <b>movement</b> <b>has</b> also been criticized by the media in Japan for child welfare issues.|$|R
5|$|Baith Israel Anshei Emes's move to egalitarianism {{culminated in}} August 1988, when Debra Cantor {{was hired as}} its first female rabbi, making it the first synagogue in the Northeastern United States to be led by a woman. Cantor, who was 33 at the time, had been valedictorian of that year's graduating class at the Jewish Theological Seminary. The {{decision}} was not accepted by all congregants; the Conservative <b>movement</b> <b>had</b> ordained its first female rabbi, Amy Eilberg, only three years before, in 1985, and following Cantor's appointment a number of families left the synagogue to form B'nai Avraham, an Orthodox congregation in Brooklyn Heights.|$|E
5|$|By 1914 the non-militant {{elements}} of the suffrage <b>movement</b> <b>had</b> built up a steady presence and, although damaged by the bad press violent action brought, they also gained from the publicity. A summer school {{had been set up}} by the NUWSS in the Conwy Valley the previous year and now their members were benefitting from the training in public speaking that was given. In south Wales signs of working-class involvement in the suffrage cause took shape through the Women's Co-operative Guild, with a branch opening in Ton Pentre in the Rhondda in 1914 run by Elizabeth Andrews.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} of his death, his {{reputation}} and fame were waning, and his passing was little noticed within the artistic community. His artwork had certainly been acknowledged during his lifetime, but not widely. While the close study of landscape and an emphasis on the spiritual elements of nature were commonplace in contemporary art, his work was too original and personal to be well understood. By 1838, his work no longer sold or received attention from critics; the Romantic <b>movement</b> <b>had</b> been moving away from the early idealism that the artist had helped found.|$|E
5000|$|While {{there are}} no {{official}} statistics, the <b>movement</b> <b>has</b> been described as [...] "small but growing" [...] as of 2004.Representatives of the <b>movement</b> <b>have</b> published claims of numbers of adherents ranging in the five digits as of 2008.|$|R
50|$|The {{cultural}} rights <b>movement</b> <b>has</b> provoked attention {{to protect the}} rights of groups of people, or their culture, in similar fashion to the manner in which the human rights <b>movement</b> <b>has</b> brought attention to the needs of individuals throughout the world.|$|R

5|$|Having {{resolved}} at {{the outset}} to adopt the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite as their ritual, the new Grand Lodge found itself with only the three craft degrees, and aspiring to a 33-degree system. Male masons were sent into other jurisdictions to acquire the necessary ritual. In 1899, ten masons in the Droit Humain received the 33rd degree, allowing them to form a Supreme Council. Lodges had opened in Paris, Blois, Lyon, Rouen, and Zürich. By 1914, the <b>movement</b> <b>had</b> spread to Britain, the Far East, the United States, Belgium, and the Netherlands.|$|E
5|$|In {{an attempt}} to imitate the {{conventions}} of silent cinema in its infancy, the staging and acting of the film are exaggerated and artificial. The equipment used by Acevedo had limitations, causing the indoor scenes to be underexposed and the outdoor scenes to be overexposed. The Pathé camera did not allow camera <b>movement,</b> <b>had</b> imprecise definition, and dark rendering. The Kodak Ektachrome lacked a large depth of field, producing a flat image, and required good lighting to operate effectively. Overhead shots are most commonly used, with some medium shots and {{a small number of}} large shots.|$|E
5|$|Missionary Bernt Bernsten {{traveled}} {{all the way}} from North China to investigate the happenings after hearing that the biblical prophecy of Acts 2:4 was being fulfilled. Other visitors left the revival to become missionaries in remote areas all over the world. So many missionaries went out from Azusa (some thirty-eight left in October 1906) that within two years the <b>movement</b> <b>had</b> spread to over fifty nations, including Britain, Scandinavia, Germany, Holland, Egypt, Syria, Palestine, South Africa, Hong Kong, China, Ceylon and India. Christian leaders visited from all over the world.|$|E
50|$|Other artistic <b>movements</b> <b>have</b> {{emerged in}} {{alternative}} manga, like {{the emergence of}} the avant-garde magazine Garo around the time of gekiga's acceptance into the mainstream manga market and the much-later Nouvelle Manga <b>movement.</b> Such <b>movements</b> <b>have</b> superseded gekiga as alternative comics in Japan.|$|R
50|$|The <b>movement</b> <b>has</b> survived Osho's death. The Osho International Foundation (OIF), the {{successor}} to the Neo-Sannyas International Foundation, now propagates his views, operating once more out of the Pune ashram in India, and the <b>movement</b> <b>has</b> begun to communicate on the Internet.|$|R

5|$|Opposition {{to the use}} {{of animals}} in medical {{research}} first arose in the United States during the 1860s, when Henry Bergh founded the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (ASPCA), with America's first specifically anti-vivisection organization being the American AntiVivisection Society (AAVS), founded in 1883. Antivivisectionists of the era generally believed the spread of mercy was the great cause of civilization, and vivisection was cruel. However, in the USA the antivivisectionists' efforts were defeated in every legislature, overwhelmed by the superior organization and influence of the medical community. Overall, this <b>movement</b> <b>had</b> little legislative success until the passing of the Laboratory Animal Welfare Act, in 1966.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the U.S. Religious Census of 1906, all congregations {{associated}} with the Restoration <b>Movement</b> <b>had</b> been reported together by the Census Bureau. But as the movement developed, tensions grew between those who emphasized unity and those who emphasized restoration, highlighting differences in the groups' underlying approaches to Biblical interpretation. For the Churches of Christ, practices not present in accounts of New Testament worship were not permissible in the church. In contrast, the Christian Church may consider any practice not expressly forbidden.|$|E
5|$|The {{inaugural meeting}} of the Women's Franchise League (WFL) was held on 25 July 1889, at the Pankhurst home in Russell Square. William Lloyd Garrison spoke at the meeting, warning the {{audience}} that the US abolition <b>movement</b> <b>had</b> been hampered by individuals advocating moderation and patience. Early members of the WFL included Josephine Butler, leader of the Ladies National Association for the Repeal of the Contagious Diseases Acts; the Pankhursts' friend Elizabeth Wolstenholme Elmy; and Harriot Eaton Stanton Blatch, daughter of US suffragist Elizabeth Cady Stanton.|$|E

5|$|While the <b>movement</b> <b>had</b> its {{greatest}} {{level of success}} in Sweden, {{there were a number}} of other important Danish proponents including Ivar Bentsen, Kaare Klint, Arne Jacobsen, Carl Petersen and Steen Eiler Rasmussen. Bentsen, with the assistance of Thorkild Henningsen, designed Denmark's first terraced houses in the Bellahøj district of Copenhagen. Very appropriately Klint, working with Bentsen, adapted the design of Frederiks Hospital to serve as the Danish Museum of Art & Design. Carl Petersen's main achievement was the Faaborg Museum built for collections of art from Funen. Steen Rasmussen is remembered above all for his town planning activities and for his contributions to the Dansk Byplanlaboratorium (Danish town planning laboratory).|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} artists {{traditionally}} {{associated with the}} <b>movement</b> <b>had</b> origins that were neither Dutch nor Flemish in the modern sense. Van der Weyden was born Roger de la Pasture in Tournai. The German Hans Memling and the Estonian Michael Sittow both worked in the Netherlands in a fully Netherlandish style. Simon Marmion is often regarded as an Early Netherlandish painter because he came from Amiens, an area intermittently ruled by the Burgundian court between 1435 and 1471. The Burgundian duchy was at its peak influence, and the innovations made by the Netherlandish painters were soon recognised across the continent. By the time of van Eyck's death, his paintings were sought by wealthy patrons across Europe. Copies of his works were widely circulated, a fact that greatly contributed {{to the spread of}} the Netherlandish style to central and southern Europe. Central European art was then under the dual influence of innovations from Italy and from the north. Often the exchange of ideas between the Low Countries and Italy led to patronage from nobility such as Matthias Corvinus, King of Hungary, who commissioned manuscripts from both traditions.|$|E
5|$|After the Lancaster House negotiations, the anti-colonial <b>movement</b> <b>had</b> {{split into}} two parties, the Kenya African National Union (KANU), which was {{dominated}} by Kikuyu and Luo, and the Kenya African Democratic Union (KADU), which was led largely by members of smaller tribal groups. In May 1960, KANU nominated Kenyatta as its President, although the government vetoed it, insisting {{that he had been}} an instigator of the Mau Mau. KANU then declared that it would refuse to take part in any government unless Kenyatta was freed. KANU campaigned on the issue of Kenyatta's detainment in the February 1961 election, where it gained a majority of votes. KANU nevertheless refused to form a government, which was instead created through a KADU-led coalition of smaller parties. Kenyatta had kept abreast of these developments, although refused to back either KANU or KADU, instead insisting on unity between the two parties.|$|E
50|$|In the United States {{the ideals}} of and work of the Mizrachi <b>movement</b> <b>have</b> been carried out through the {{official}} Religious Zionists of America (RZA) <b>movement</b> that <b>has</b> been {{an important source of}} the ideology and guidance for Modern Orthodox Judaism and its rabbis and followers. It is affiliated with the Bnei Akiva youth <b>movement</b> which <b>has</b> a great influence on the Modern Orthodox Jewish day schools and synagogues. The American <b>movement</b> <b>has</b> served as a fund-rasing and lobbying arm for its Israeli counterparts.|$|R

50|$|Claims and {{activities}} {{associated with the}} men's rights <b>movement</b> <b>have</b> been criticized by some scholars, the Southern Poverty Law Center, and commentators. Some sectors of the <b>movement</b> <b>have</b> been described as misogynistic. Others argue that perceived disadvantage is often due to loss of entitlement and privilege.|$|R
