40|$|The {{advent of}} the Internal <b>Model</b> <b>Approval</b> Process within Solvency II and the {{desirability}} of many insurance companies to gain approval has increased the importance of some topics such as risk aggregation in determining overall economic capital level.

In this paper we apply different pair-copula models for aggregating market risks that represent usually {{an important part of}} an insurer risk profile.

The formalization allows for a possible leveraging of information contained in bid and ask prices and the study reports on the potential of this approach. Capital measures using RW AV aR are observed to be sensitive to volatility, the volatility of volatility, the skewness of return distributions and the volatility spread across maturities.

40|$|Under {{approval}} voting, every voter may {{vote for}} any number of canditates. To <b>model</b> <b>approval</b> voting, we let a political spectrum be the set of all possible political positions, and let each voter have a subset of the spectrum that they approve, called an approval region. The fraction of all voters who approve the most popular position is the agreement proportion for the society. We consider voting in societies whose political spectrum is modeled by d-dimensional space (R^d) with approval regions defined by axis-parallel boxes. For such societies, we first consider a Tur 2 ̆ 6 #aacute;n-type problem, attempting to find the maximum agreement between pairs of voters for a society with a given level of overall agreement. We prove a lower bound on this maximum agreement and find in the literature a proof that the lower bound is optimal. By this result we find that for sufficiently large n, any n-voter box society in R^d where at least αn 2 pairs of voters agree on some position must have a position contained in β n approval regions, where α = 1 -(1 -β) ^ 2 /d. We also consider an extension of this problem involving projections of approval regions to axes. Finally we consider the question of (k,m) -agreeable box societies, where a society is said to be (k, m) -agreeable if among every m voters, some k approve a common position.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the {{relationship}} between health promotion and quality of life in noninstitutionalized older adults. The study was conducted within the framework of Nola Pender's Health Promotion <b>Model.</b> <b>Approval</b> for this study was obtained from the Institutional Review Board of Ball State University for human protection of the participants. Permission from the five churches' boards was obtained. Written assurance of anonymity of subjects was given. This study was descriptive and correlational. Quality oflife was the dependent variable and the independent variables were health promoting behaviors, importance of health, perceived health status, the number of chronic health conditions and any consequent disruption to life, prior involvement in a senior citizens' wellness group or with a health advisor, and demographic variables including age, gender, marital status, living alone or with a companion or family, and education. Volunteer subjects aged 65 and older from five church groups were asked to complete the following questionnaires: Health Promoting Lifestyle Profile, Quality of Life Index, Value Survey, and a demographic sheet. The demographic questionnaire included an item regarding self-perceived health status, whether or not the participant had been involved in a wellness group or with a health advisor for older adults, and a checklist of chronic health conditions and whether or not these had had debilitating consequences for the participant. Hypotheses included the following: (1) There is no correlation between health promoting behavior and quality of life among older adults. (2) There is no correlation between importance of health and quality of life among older adults. (3) There is no correlation between perceived health status and quality of life among older adults. (4) There is no correlation between the number of chronic health conditions and quality of life among older adults. (5) There is no correlation between disruption brought about by chronic health conditions and quality of life among older adults. (6) There is no significant difference between those older adults who had participated in a senior citizens' wellness group or with a health advisor and those who had not. (7) There are no significant differences in older adult males and females and those who live alone or with family or a companion regarding quality of life. (8) There is no correlation between age and quality of life among older adults. (9) There is no correlation between number of years of education and quality of life among older adults.

Our {{analysis}} deals with several {{issues that have}} been usually addressed separately in the extant literature. First, our analysis uses polling data collected at a higher frequency than is typical, using over 1, 100 published national polls, and data on macro-economic conditions collected at the weekly level.

Second, our statistical modeling explicitly deals with the sampling error of these polls, {{as well as the}} possibility of bias in the polls due to house effects. Indeed, quite aside from the question of “what drives approval?”, there is considerable interest in the extent to which polling organizations systematically diverge from one another in assessing approval for the president.
