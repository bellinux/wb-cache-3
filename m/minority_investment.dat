40|$|This paper extends {{research}} in the field of private equity investments in family firms. It contributes to the literature by fundamentally analyzing the decision criteria of family firm owners for using <b>minority</b> <b>investments</b> of private equity investors.

We find that perceived benefits and drawbacks of private equity investments are influenced by business and family characteristics. Based on pecking-order theory, resource-based view and the strategy paradigm, propositions as well as a conceptual framework are developed.

40|$|This paper {{adds to the}} {{literature}} on the determinants of the effects of private equity (PE) investments. Using an original dataset of 191 target firms in Italy, we study the effects on performance and governance of the stakes acquired by the PE investor.

We find that PE investment has a positive effect on profitability, sales, and employment; these effects are larger for <b>minority</b> <b>investments.</b> We argue that this signals effective governance that follows from complementing rather than substituting incumbent managers in <b>minority</b> <b>investments...</b>|$|R
