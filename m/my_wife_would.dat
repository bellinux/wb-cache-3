6000|$|... "This {{cornelian}} must {{be something}} very precious," [...] thought he, [...] "or <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> <b>would</b> not wear it on her person with so much care." ...|$|E
60|$|GREGORY. I won't fight. If {{you beat}} me <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> <b>would</b> share my humiliation. If I beat you, she would sympathize {{with you and}} loathe me for my brutality.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well?" [...] said Jim. [...] "Suppose I do? There's {{plenty of}} room at Langrigg and <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> <b>would</b> be kind to my friends when she knew how much I owe them." ...|$|E
60|$|SIR HOWARD (with emotion). I don't think, Cicely, that <b>my</b> dear <b>wife</b> <b>would</b> {{misunderstand}} me.|$|R
6000|$|... "If {{she were}} once <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> he <b>would</b> not reject her. Of {{all human beings}} he is in truth the kindest and most affectionate." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'As {{the wife}} of a crossing-sweeper, it is probable,' he answered, 'that you would be miserable. As <b>my</b> <b>wife,</b> you <b>would</b> {{certainly}} be admired and powerful, and consequently happy.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We have {{mince pie}} right along at our house," [...] said the young man. [...] "But I guess if I was {{to eat a}} piece of it cold, <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> <b>would</b> have the doctor round inside of five minutes." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No; {{but what}} I propose is this--if ye will listen. Come {{and live in}} your old house. We can spare some rooms very well--I am sure <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> <b>would</b> not mind it at all--until there's an opening for ye." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{had written}} to the Ehrichs, saying that <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> <b>would</b> be {{with me in the}} Springs for a few days, and that I wanted them to meet her--but I did not expect to be met or to receive an {{invitation}} to breakfast.|$|E
6000|$|... "But I {{think that}} I can love you as {{honestly}} and as firmly as a younger one. I {{think that if}} you could bring yourself to be <b>my</b> <b>wife,</b> you <b>would</b> find that you would not be treated badly." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Seemed to ye sort o' contrairy, jist as I {{reckoned}} <b>my</b> <b>wife's</b> foot <b>would</b> {{have looked}} in a slipper {{that you said}} was GIV to ye," [...] suggested Collinson pointedly, but with no implication of reproach in his voice.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes. I reckon we're goin' for them. 'Tain't likely <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> and me <b>would</b> {{want to pull}} up stakes at our age," [...] {{said the}} old man, sorrowfully.|$|R
60|$|I got {{a little}} miserable fun out of this, but <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> <b>would</b> not laugh; {{she would not be}} placated in any way; she held me in a sort {{responsible}} for the dilemma I had conjectured, and inculpated me in some measure for that which had really presented itself.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said Pinney, [...] "I {{knew you}} had let your house in town. I think <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> <b>would</b> feel about it just as you do; she's a great person for the country, and if it wasn't for my work on the paper, I guess I sh'd have to live there." ...|$|E
60|$|That matches {{are made}} in heaven, may be, but <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> <b>would</b> have been just the wife for Peter the Great, or Peter the Piper. How she would have set in order that huge {{littered}} empire of the one, and with indefatigable painstaking picked the peck of pickled peppers for the other.|$|E
60|$|On being {{presented}} with a cast-off camp-stool, {{and a pair of}} old boots to dispose of, he instantly appropriated them as graceful souvenirs, and clasping his hands, declared with effusion that he would seat his infant upon the so-useful stool, and offer the charming boots to Madame <b>my</b> <b>wife,</b> who <b>would</b> weep for joy at this touching tableau.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, then, to end {{the matter}} at once," [...] said Goodman Brown, {{considerably}} nettled, [...] "there is <b>my</b> <b>wife,</b> Faith. It <b>would</b> break her dear little heart; and I'd rather break my own." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You and I thought scarlet most {{becoming}} to our complexion, Joe Blake!" [...] says Sir George. [...] "And <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> {{thinks there}} <b>would</b> {{not have been}} room for two such great men on one side." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Our Black Lady forbid!" [...] {{said the}} innkeeper, {{with a quick}} voice, and with rather a dismayed look; [...] "said I that thou shouldst not have a bed? St. Florian desert me if I and <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> <b>would</b> not sooner sleep in the chimney-corner than thou shouldst miss one wink of thy slumbers!" ...|$|E
6000|$|We kept them, {{every one}} in their old places; for, though <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> <b>would</b> have sent them about their business, my dear Jemimarann just hinted, [...] "Mamma, you know THEY {{have been used to}} great houses, and we have not; had we not better keep them for a little?"--Keep them, then, we did, to show us how to be gentlefolks.|$|E
60|$|I am an Englishman, living, as all Englishman should do, in England, and <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> <b>would</b> not, I think, be well pleased {{were any}} one to insinuate that she were {{other than an}} Englishwoman; but in the {{circumstances}} of my marriage I became connected with the south of Spain, and the narrative which I am to tell requires that I should refer {{to some of those}} details.|$|E
6000|$|... "Every word {{brings us}} nearer the end," [...] was the ready reply. [...] "I {{am going to}} tell you the truth as I feel it in my heart. Marcia would be at her best in the life to which I should bring her. Mentally, spiritually and humanly, as <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> she <b>would</b> be happier. She has refused me out of loyalty to you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The reis was {{a sleepy}} old crock," [...] Belmont continued, [...] "but I have {{absolute}} {{confidence in the}} promptness and decision of <b>my</b> <b>wife.</b> She <b>would</b> insist upon an immediate alarm being given. Suppose they started back at two-thirty, they should be at Halfa by three, since the journey is down stream. How long did they say that it took to turn out the Camel Corps?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Tell {{your sister}} {{she was right}} to shoot, quite right. I meant mischief. But tell her this, too. I {{believed}} that our marriage was genuine. I believed that she was <b>my</b> <b>wife,</b> or she <b>would</b> have been safe from me." ...|$|R
60|$|The banker's dinner-party over, we {{returned}} to our apartments, having dropped Major Pendennis at his lodgings, and there, as the custom is amongst most friendly married couples, talked over {{the company and the}} dinner. I thought <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> <b>would</b> naturally have liked Sir Barnes Newcome, who was very attentive to her, took her to dinner as the bride, and talked ceaselessly to her during the whole entertainment.|$|E
6000|$|MILLER, {{dropping}} on his knees, and fanning Mrs. Curwen: [...] "There! there! Wake up, Mrs. Curwen. I didn't mean to scold you for joking. I didn't, indeed. I--I--I don't {{know what the}} deuce I'm up to." [...] He gathers Mrs. Curwen's inanimate form in his arms, and fans her face where it lies on his shoulder. [...] "I don't know what <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> <b>would</b> say if" [...] - ...|$|E
6000|$|... "By no means," [...] {{the count}} said. [...] "That {{is a long}} story, too, and <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> <b>would</b> much rather hear yours than listen to it. She has not yet {{recovered}} from the events of this morning. But we will wait until {{we are at the}} village. We have left the forest behind us, and another half hour will take us to Stromoff, where we can get pretty good accommodation." ...|$|E
60|$|The {{scheme that}} I had devised may {{possibly}} have been put into use by others. But of this I know not. I thought it a good scheme and determined to experiment with it, and, if possible, to make a trap which should catch a burglar. I would reveal this plan to no one but my friend the physician and <b>my</b> <b>wife.</b> Secrecy <b>would</b> be {{an important element in}} its success.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have the}} right of the man who loves you," [...] he declared. [...] "Some day you will be <b>my</b> <b>wife,</b> and it <b>would</b> not be well for either of us to {{remember}} that in these unhappy days you and I were separated." ...|$|R
5000|$|Hara's wife Sadae {{fell ill}} in 1939, {{and died in}} 1944. He had once said of her, [...] "If I should lose <b>my</b> <b>wife,</b> I <b>would</b> live only one year to leave a {{collection}} of sad and beautiful poems behind". A year later, just before {{the first anniversary of}} her death, he was exposed to the atomic bombing of Hiroshima at his parents' home in Motomachi. These two traumatic experiences became central to his work.|$|R
6000|$|... "A female curate, {{who is not}} <b>my</b> <b>wife,</b> <b>would</b> never suit me. With me, then, it seems, you cannot go: {{but if you are}} sincere in your offer, I will, {{while in}} town, speak to a married missionary, whose wife needs a coadjutor. Your own fortune will make you {{independent}} of the Society's aid; and thus you may still be spared the dishonour of breaking your promise and deserting the band you engaged to join." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I do {{not know}} that there is {{anything}} else for me to explain. I was determined to preserve my disguise as long as possible, and hence my preference for a dirty face. Knowing that <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> <b>would</b> be terribly anxious, I slipped off my ring and confided it to the Lascar at a moment when no constable was watching me, together with a hurried scrawl, telling her that she had no cause to fear." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{must be as}} I say, Pierre. Once I am arrested--and it {{is almost}} certain <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> <b>would</b> be arrested with me--nothing {{can be done to}} help, {{and it would be a}} great {{satisfaction}} to me to know that my friends have escaped. There will be in that case no need of extreme haste, for no one knows that they are in any way connected with me, and there will be no inquiries for them." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Do you know," [...] {{said the}} Master of the House, [...] "as this story goes on I feel poorer and poorer every minute--I suppose by comparison. In fact, I {{do not know}} that I can afford to light another cigar. But one thought comforts me," [...] he continued: [...] "if I had been living in that cot with <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> I <b>would</b> not have had the stomach-ache; so that {{balances}} things somewhat." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Speak for {{yourself}} {{as well as}} for me. Some of the money I want has been borrowed for you. And if you come to gain, <b>my</b> <b>wife's</b> death <b>would</b> be ten thousand pounds in your wife's pocket. Sharp as you are, you seem to have conveniently forgotten Madame Fosco's legacy. Don't look at me in that way! I won't have it! What with your looks and your questions, upon my soul, you make my flesh creep!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Certainly," [...] said Mr Whittlestaff. [...] "But it may so {{probably}} {{be the case that}} you and I shall differ materially as to thinking what may be best for her. As far as I understand the matter, you wish that she should be your wife. I wish that she should be mine. I think that as <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> she <b>would</b> live a happier life than she could do as yours; and as she thinks also--" [...] Here Mr Whittlestaff paused.|$|R
