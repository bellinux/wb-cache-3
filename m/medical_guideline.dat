40|$|ABSTRACT Background: As medical {{students}} in a psychiatric department, we experienced a lack of using <b>medical</b> <b>guidelines.</b> Our understanding is that clinical guidelines may be helpful in some clinical settings, and wanted to investigate how to implement clinical guidelines. Aims: This paper investigates the reasons as to why {{there is a lack}} of focus on <b>medical</b> <b>guidelines,</b> why it is hard to implement <b>medical</b> <b>guidelines,</b> which implementing strategies are most efficient, who should be responsible for developing the <b>medical</b> <b>guidelines,</b> and most importantly, if <b>medical</b> <b>guidelines</b> actually do improve the prognosis. Method: In addition to a thorough literature review, the authors have conducted interviews with two chief physician executives at two very different divisions. Results: Based on existing theory and the interviews {{there is a lack of}} using <b>medical</b> <b>guidelines</b> in the health sector. The literature review theory state that active implementation strategies are most efficient. Furthermore, theory reveals that the group developing the guidelines should consists of people with different specialties and that the group leader should involve every participant in the group. Further, research argue that the use of <b>medical</b> <b>guidelines</b> improve the prognosis of patients Conclusion: <b>Medical</b> <b>guidelines</b> are not sufficiently utilized, and active implementation strategies should be preferred. The responsibility concerning implementing <b>medical</b> <b>guidelines</b> is held by the group developing the guidelines, the management team, and the clinicians themselves. The group should consist of participants of different expertise areas in order to ensure guidelines of high quality. Finally, the literature concludes that utilizing <b>medical</b> <b>guidelines</b> improve the prognosis...|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of <b>medical</b> <b>guidelines</b> aims at {{the increase of}} quality and the reduction of costs of <b>medical</b> services. Though <b>guidelines</b> are widely diffused, they still have hardly considerable influence on patient treatment particularly within the ambulatory sector. Considering this, we interviewed practicing physicians about their problems wit the implementation of <b>medical</b> <b>guidelines</b> in primary care. These interviews and our study of related work revealed that the actual needs of practicing physicians have largely been neglected during the development process of <b>medical</b> <b>guidelines.</b> In an attempt to implement <b>medical</b> <b>guidelines</b> into primary care we analyzed the concrete requirements of physicians {{in order to meet}} their information demands. Based on these requirements we developed an approach of a work process-oriented implementation of <b>medical</b> <b>guidelines.</b> We also implemented a web-based prototypical application in order to put the concept into practice...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to design a {{universal}} bridge between any Electronic Health Record (EHR) and formalized <b>medical</b> <b>guidelines</b> included in evaluation and presentation system.

50|$|In general, {{people should}} not have medical {{screening}} unless the screening is indicated by the person's medical history, a physical examination, and a <b>medical</b> <b>guideline.</b> The rationale {{for this is that}} in cases in which a person is unlikely to have a medical condition, it can be more likely that a test will give a false positive result than it would be for the test to detect something which is unlikely considering the person's medical history. If a false positive result does occur in a patient unlikely to have that disease, then that patient will be likely to seek treatment.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Medical {{guidelines}} and protocols are documents {{aimed at improving}} the quality of medical care by offering support in medi-cal decision making in the form of management recommendations based on scientic evidence. Whereas medical guidelines are in-tended for nation-wide use, and thus omit medical management de-tails that may differ among hospitals, medical protocols are aimed at local use within hospitals and, therefore, include detailed infor-mation. Although a <b>medical</b> <b>guideline</b> and protocol concerning the management of a particular disorder are related to each other, one question is to what extent they are different. Formal methods are ap-plied to shed light on this issue. A Dutch <b>medical</b> <b>guideline</b> regarding the treatment of breast cancer, and a Dutch protocol based on it, are taken as an example. ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract:- The correct {{manipulation}} of semantic information {{is essential for}} {{the development and implementation of}} <b>medical</b> <b>guideline</b> server. This is a knowledge based information system for computeraided processing of clinical practice guidelines. In this study the following core functions are involved in the data processing of guideline server: (1) information transfer from other hospital information systems, (2) knowledge processing and (3) reporting functions. An execution engine is developed for guideline knowledge processing by our group. The ontological structures of the knowledge are the results of a knowledge engineering process. Additionally, the terminological standardization by Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) is integrated into the execution engine. The applied methodical approach for the ontology development is explained as a part of the knowledge engineering process. The developed ontological structures are used as interface descriptions for data and information transfer from electronic health record (e. g. test for plausibility) as well as for report generation and documentation (i. e. generation and explanation of terms and term sequences). The developed concepts are presented in this paper.
