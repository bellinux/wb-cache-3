40|$|Abstract—The {{approximate}} analytical {{solution of}} the integral equation concerning the equivalent magnetic current in the narrow slot, coupling two electrodynamic volumes, has been obtained by the averaging method. The formulas and the plots for currents and the coupling coefficients of longitudinal and transverse slots in the common walls of rectangular waveguides are represented. By means of the induced <b>magnetomotive</b> <b>forces</b> method using basis functions of current distribution, obtained by the averaging method, the following electrodynamic structures have been considered: the electrically long longitudinal slot in the common broad wall of rectangular waveguides; two symmetrical transverse slots in the common broad wall of rectangular waveguides; the transverse slots system in the common broad wall of rectangular waveguides. The problem about the resonant iris with the arbitrary oriented slot in the plane of cross-section of a rectangular waveguide has been solved by the averaging method. The problem about stepped junction of two semi-infinite rectangular waveguides with the impedance slotted iris has been solved by the induced <b>magnetomotive</b> <b>forces</b> method. The analytical formulas for the distributed surface impedance of homogeneous and inhomogeneous magnetodielectric coatings of iris surface have been obtained.

40|$|Abstract. We {{present a}} finite-element based method for the {{computation}} of force fields, using {{the language and}} concepts of differential geometry, in the familiar "eddy-currents " context (displacement currents ignored).

The essential result is: the edge-element implementation of the h-formulation of the eddy-currents problem can serve without any modification when conductors are mobile and deformable, provided the assembly of finite-element matrices is done at each time step. A simple formula gives the virtual work of electromagnetic forces, hence a notion of "nodal forces " from which an interpolation of the force field can be derived if needed. 1...|$|R

40|$|A {{new type}} of {{multi-port}} isolated bidirectional DC-DC converter is proposed in this study. In the proposed converter, transfer of power takes place through addition of <b>magnetomotive</b> <b>forces</b> generated by multiple windings on a common transformer core.

Hence, the requirement of an additional power transfer stage from the centralised capacitor can also be eliminated. The converter can be used for a multi-input, multi-output (MIMO) system. A pulse width modulation (PWM) strategy for controlling simultaneous power flow in the MIMO converter is also proposed. The proposed PWM scheme works in the discontinuous conduction mode. The leakage inductance can be chosen to aid power transfer. By using the proposed converter topology and PWM scheme, the need to compute power flow equations to determine the magnitude and direction of power flow between ports is alleviated.
