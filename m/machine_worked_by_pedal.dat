50|$|The 1st {{downhill}} time-trial race {{took place}} in Fairfax, California on October 21, 1976 on a fireroad now referred to as Repack Road, due {{to the need to}} repack the hub brake after each descent. The bikes used were based on cruiser bicycles that had a drum or coaster brake that <b>worked</b> <b>by</b> <b>pedalling</b> backwards. The mechanism operated with a conical brake shoe being wound on a thread in a metal hub. To prevent the brake from seizing it was kept filled with grease. Heavy use during the descent would cause the brake to over heat, softening the grease and causing it to drain from the hub, requiring frequent repacking. Ten riders descended 1300 ft of Repack road in about 5 minutes.|$|R
50|$|Erotic {{electrostimulation}} {{refers to}} the act of using electricity for sexual stimulation. Electrostimulation dates back {{as early as the}} mid 1700s. By the mid 1970s, medical transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) machines were widely available. The <b>machines</b> <b>work</b> <b>by</b> stimulating nerve endings with electricity, sending signals of stimulation to the brain. Electrostimulation works off this same principle, when the brain received a signal of stimulation from the genitals, pleasure hormones are released.|$|R

This has been used to discover formula with [...] "invariant relationships", such as laws of nature.|$|R
50|$|Counting {{the cell}} colonies is usually done under a {{microscope}} and is quite tedious. Recently, machines have been developed that use algorithms to analyse images. These are either captured by an image scanner or an automated microscope that can completely automate the counting process. One such automated <b>machine</b> <b>works</b> <b>by</b> accepting certain types of cell plates through a slot (not unlike a CD player), taking a photograph, and uploading it to a computer for immediate analysis. Reliable counts are available in seconds.|$|R
50|$|Devices can be penetrative or extractive. A typical penetrative <b>machine</b> <b>works</b> <b>by</b> the {{transfer}} of rotational or reciprocating force from a motor to a directional motion on a shaft, which is tipped by a dildo. A hand-held modified reciprocating saw device is sometimes called a fucksaw, a hand-held modified drill motor rotating device is sometimes called a drilldo, and a modified jigsaw is called a jillsaw. An extractive device works like a milking machine and can {{be attached to the}} penis, breast, or other body part.|$|R
5000|$|A typical [...] "capacitive discharge" [...] {{blasting}} <b>machine</b> <b>works</b> <b>by</b> {{charging a}} capacitor from a battery, then discharging the capacitor through an external circuit, called the firing line, {{to fire the}} blasting cap. While the machine is idle, an [...] "internal shunt" [...] is connected across the output terminals so that any stray voltages induced in the external circuit, for example by nearby radio transmitters, are harmlessly short-circuited without triggering the blasting cap. The machines also typically include an [...] "abort" [...] feature to discharge the internal capacitor without firing the cap.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>machine</b> <b>works</b> <b>by</b> [...] "shearing" [...] coal from a {{longwall}} {{coal face}} {{as it moved}} along the face. The shear drum is around 0.5 metres in diameter and the machine travels on an armoured conveyor with a prop-free front. The machine shears going one way and the coal at the front is deflected by a plough onto the conveyor. On the machine's return it knocks {{the rest of the}} coal onto the conveyor. The Shearer was usually used on seams thicker than a metre and produced small coal suitable for power stations.|$|R

The <b>machine</b> <b>works</b> <b>by</b> integrating a storage magazine of pre-filled pipettes that can be accessed, and swapped, by the headstage {{at the conclusion of}} each experiment. In operation, following each neuron measurement, the program enters “swap” state where a set of programmed actuator movements take place. First, the headstage translates towards the pipette storage assembly and deposits its used pipette. The storage assembly rotates to index a fresh pipette, its is grasped, and finally, the headstage returns to its previously designated home position in preparation of subsequent experiments...|$|R
5000|$|The Monotype <b>machine</b> <b>worked</b> <b>by</b> casting {{letters from}} [...] "hot metal" [...] (molten metal) as pieces of type. Thus {{spelling}} mistakes could be corrected by adding or removing individual letters. This was particularly useful for [...] "quality" [...] printing - such as books. In contrast, the Linotype machine formed a complete {{line of type}} in one bar. Editing these required replacing an entire line (and if the replacement ran onto another line, {{the rest of the}} paragraph). But Linotype slugs were easier to handle if moving a complete section of text around a page. This was more useful for [...] "quick" [...] printing - such as newspapers.|$|R

50|$|Abrasive <b>machining</b> <b>works</b> <b>by</b> {{forcing the}} {{abrasive}} particles, or grains, into {{the surface of}} the workpiece so that each particle cuts away a small bit of material. Abrasive machining is similar to conventional machining, such as milling or turning, because each of the abrasive particles acts like a miniature cutting tool. However, unlike conventional machining the grains are much smaller than a cutting tool, and the geometry and orientation of individual grains are not well defined. As a result, abrasive machining is less power efficient and generates more heat.The grain size may be different based on the machining. For rough grinding, coarse abrasives are used. For fine grinding, fine grains (abrasives) are used.|$|R
5000|$|The {{word size}} was {{selected}} after some deliberation. The <b>machine</b> <b>worked</b> <b>by</b> passing {{in a single}} address with almost every instruction, thereby {{reducing the number of}} memory accesses. For operations with two operands, adding for instance, the [...] "other" [...] operand was assumed to be the last one loaded. Whirlwind operated much like a reverse Polish notation calculator in this respect; except there was no operand stack, only an accumulator. The designers felt that 2048 words of memory would be the minimum usable amount, requiring 11 bits to represent an address, and that 16 to 32 instructions would be the minimum for another five bits — and so it was 16 bits.|$|R
50|$|As in Great Britain, {{distinct}} {{services of}} inspection {{enforce the law}} in factories and mines respectively. In factories and workshops an inspector may order re-examination as to physical fitness for the work imposed of any worker under 16; certain occupations and processes are prohibited - e.g. girls under 16 at <b>machines</b> <b>worked</b> <b>by</b> treadles, and the weights that may be lifted, pushed or carried by girls or boys under 18 are carefully specified. The law applies generally to philanthropic and religious institutions where industrial work is carried on, as in ordinary trading establishments; and this holds good even if the <b>work</b> is <b>by</b> way of technical instruction. Domestic workshops are not controlled unless the industry is classed as dangerous or unhealthy; introduction of motor power brings them under inspection.|$|R
25|$|There are {{two basic}} types of rotary swaging machine, the {{standard}} (also known as a tagging machine), and the butt swaging machine. A butt swaging <b>machine</b> <b>works</b> <b>by</b> having sets of wedges that close the dies onto the workpiece by inserting them between the annular rollers and the dies, normally {{by the use of}} a foot pedal. A butt swaging machine can allow a workpiece to be inserted without the dies closing on it, for example a three-foot workpiece can be inserted 12inches and then the dies closed, drawn through until 12inches remain and the dies are then released, the finished workpiece would then, for example, be four feet long but still of its initial diameter for a foot at each end.|$|R

25|$|Scutching {{refers to}} the process of {{cleaning}} cotton of its seeds and other impurities. The first scutching machine was invented in 1797, but did not come into further mainstream use until after 1808 or 1809, when it was introduced and used in Manchester, England. By 1816, it had become generally adopted. The scutching <b>machine</b> <b>worked</b> <b>by</b> passing the cotton through a pair of rollers, and then striking it with iron or steel bars called beater bars or beaters. The beaters, which turn very quickly, strike the cotton hard and knock the seeds out. This process is done over a series of parallel bars so as to allow the seeds to fall through. At the same time, air is blown across the bars, which carries the cotton into a cotton chamber.|$|R
50|$|The {{depth of}} the C-shaped frame is called the throat. The largest {{machines}} have throat sizes of 120 cm (48 inches), while smaller machines have throat sizes of about 60 cm (24 inches). The C stands vertically and {{is supported by a}} frame. The throat size usually determines the largest size of metal sheet that the operator can place in the <b>machine</b> and <b>work</b> easily. On some machines, the operator can turn the top wheel and anvil 90 degrees to the frame to increase the maximum size of the work piece. Because the <b>machine</b> <b>works</b> <b>by</b> an amount of pressure between the wheels through the material, and because that pressure changes as the material becomes thinner, the lower jaw and cradle of the frame that holds the anvil roller is adjustable. It may move with a hydraulic jack on machines designed for steel plate, or a jackscrew on machines designed for sheet metals. As the material thins, the operator must adjust the pressure to compensate.|$|R
30|$|From {{the very}} {{extensive}} personal {{knowledge of the}} conditions of the forests of Northern Canada, I am able to state that fires have become more and more frequent as we approach the present time. The areas of the “brulés” of different dates may be said to be greater in proportion to their recentness. Various causes may be assigned for this increasing frequency of forest fires. The starting of fires by Indians of {{more than a hundred years}} ago, or before the introduction of modern methods, must have been a somewhat difficult matter. They probably obtained sparks by striking together pieces of iron pyrites as the Eskimos do at the present day, or ignited dry pounded wood fibre by means of wooded friction <b>machines</b> <b>worked</b> <b>by</b> bow and string; and occasionally they may have availed themselves of fires originated by lightning.|$|R
5000|$|Kensington has {{traditionally}} been {{known as one of}} the great working class centers of Philadelphia. Initially, employment focused around the nearby waterfront, and the activities of fishermen and ship- and boat-builders. In the early 19th century, Kensington transitioned to iron and steel manufacture, and became home to a variety of factories, potteries, and <b>machine</b> <b>works.</b> <b>By</b> the mid-19th century, Kensington became one of the leading centers of the textile industry, particularly in carpet manufacture.

5000|$|... 'Elmdale' near Wheelockville, was {{the site}} of the Daniel Day Mill, the first textile mill in Uxbridge, the first woolen mill in the valley(1809), the second oldest woolen mill in Massachusetts, (after one in Watertown, MA), the third textile mill in the state, and third oldest woolen mill in U.S. (after a worsted mill in Hartford). This system of mills, dams and villages was {{developed}} by John and Samuel Slater, and became known as the Rhode Island System. There was only one other mill, a cotton mill, that was established in Uxbridge that year, which was the Clapp Mill on the Mumford River. His son Joseph, born in 1790, joined the business, along with Jerry Wheelock.

25|$|A swaging <b>machine</b> <b>works</b> <b>by</b> {{using two}} or four split dies which {{separate}} and close up to 2000 times a minute. This action {{is achieved by}} mounting the dies into the machine's spindle which is rotated by a motor. The spindle is mounted inside a cage containing rollers (looks like a roller bearing). The rollers are larger than the cage so as the spindle spins the dies are pushed out to ride on the cage by centrifugal force, as the dies cross over the rollers they push the dies together because of their larger size. On a four-die machine, the number of rollers cause all dies to close at a time; {{if the number of}} rollers do not cause all pairs of dies to close at the same time then the machine is called a rotary forging machine, even though it is still a swaging process.|$|R
40|$|Support Vector <b>Machines</b> <b>work</b> <b>by</b> mapping {{training}} data for classification tasks into a high dimensional feature space. In the feature space they then find a maximal margin hyperplane which separates the data. This hyperplane is usually found using a quadratic programming routine which is computationally intensive, and is non trivial to implement. In this {{paper we propose}} an adaptation of the Adatron algorithm for classification with kernels in high dimensional spaces. The algorithm is simple and can find a solution very rapidly with an exponentially fast rate of convergence (in the number of iterations) towards the optimal solution.
