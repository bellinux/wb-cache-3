40|$|Nucleobases, nucleosides and ginsenosides, {{which have}} a {{significant}} impact on the physiological activity of organisms, are reported to be the active components of ginseng, while they are less present in ginseng extracts. Few analytical methods have been developed so far to simultaneously analyze these three classes of compounds with different polarities present in ginseng extracts. In the present study, a simple and efficient analytical method was successfully developed for the simultaneous separation of 17 nucleobases, nucleosides and ginsenosides in ginseng extracts using supercritical fluid chromatography coupled with single quadrupole mass spectrometry (SFC-MS). The effect of various experimental factors on the separation performance, such as the column type, temperature and backpressure, the type of modifier and additive, and the concentration of <b>make-up</b> <b>solvent</b> were systematically investigated. Under the selected conditions, the developed method was successfully applied to the quality evaluation of 14 batches of ginseng extracts from different origins. The results obtained for the different batches indicate that this method could be employed for the quality assessment of ginseng extracts. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|Triterpenoid {{saponins}} (TSs) are {{the most}} important components of some traditional Chinese medicines (TCMs) and have exhibited valuable pharmacological properties. In this study, a rapid and efficient method was developed for the separation of kudinosides, stauntosides and ginsenosides using supercritical fluid chromatography coupled with single quadrupole mass spectrometry (SFC-MS). The separation conditions for the selected TSs were carefully optimized after the initial screening of eight stationary phases. The best compromise for all compounds in terms of chromatographic performance and MS sensitivity was obtained when water (5 – 10 %) and formic acid (0. 05 %) were added to the supercritical carbon dioxide/MeOH mobile phase. Beside the composition of the mobile phase, the nature of the <b>make-up</b> <b>solvent</b> for interfacing SFC with MS was also evaluated. Compared to reversed phase liquid chromatography, the SFC approach showed higher resolution and shorter running time. The developed SFC-MS methods were successfully applied to the separation and identification of TSs present in Ilex latifolia Thunb., Panax quinquefolius L. and Panax ginseng C. A. Meyer. These results suggest that this SFC-MS approach could be employed as a useful tool for the quality assessment of natural products containing TSs as active componentsPeer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|The {{conditions}} {{for the analysis of}} selected doping substances by UHPSFC-MS/MS were optimized to ensure suitable peak shapes and maximized MS responses. A representative mixture of 31 acidic and basic doping agents was analyzed, in both ESI+ and ESI- modes. The best compromise for all compounds in terms of MS sensitivity and chromatographic performance was obtained when adding 2 % water and 10 mM ammonium formate in the CO 2 /MeOH mobile phase. Beside mobile phase, the nature of the <b>make-up</b> <b>solvent</b> added for interfacing UHPSFC with MS was also evaluated. Ethanol was found to be the best candidate as it was able to compensate for the negative effect of 2 % water addition in ESI- mode and provided a suitable MS response for all doping agents. Sensitivity of the optimized UHPSFC-MS/MS method was finally assessed and compared to the results obtained in conventional UHPLC-MS/MS. Sensitivity was improved by 5 - 100 -fold in UHPSFC-MS/MS vs. UHPLC-MS/MS for 56 % of compounds, while only one compound (bumetanide) offered a significantly higher MS response (4 -fold) under UHPLC-MS/MS conditions. In the second paper of this series, the optimal {{conditions for}} UHPSFC-MS/MS analysis will be employed to screen > 100 doping agents in urine matrix and results will be compared to those obtained by conventional UHPLC-MS/MS...|$|E

40|$|AbstractDuring CO 2 capture {{processes}} from coal-derived {{flue gas}} with amine solvents small entrain small solvent droplets can be formed and emitted {{from the system}} leading to high solvent emission levels. The entrained mist will lead to significant <b>solvent</b> <b>make-up</b> rates and the associated costs and may have significant secondary environmental impacts. In order to combat this issue and reduce the emissions of amine mist droplets from CO 2 absorber, a novel method using an anionic surfactant to generate charged colloidal gas aphrons (CGA) was developed. MEA emission reduction through a CGA absorption process was optimized by adjusting variables including capture temperature and stirring speed of the CGA generator. A significant reduction of close to 50 % in MEA emissions in the flue gas stream exiting the absorber column was achieved from a pilot scale CO 2 capture pilot unit...|$|R
40|$|The recent market {{release of}} a new {{generation}} of supercritical fluid chromatography (SFC) instruments compatible with state-of-the-art columns packed with sub- 2 m particles (UHPSFC) has contributed to the reemergence of interest in this technology at the analytical scale. However, to ensure performance competitiveness of this technique with modern analytical standards, a robust hyphenation of UHPSFC to mass spectrometry (MS) is mandatory. UHPSFC–MS hyphenation interface should be able to manage the compressibility of the SFC mobile phase and to preserve as much as possible the chromatographic separation integrity. Although several interfaces can be envisioned, each will have noticeable effects on chromatographic fidelity, flexibility and user-friendliness. In the present study, various interface configurations were evaluated in terms of their impact on chromatographic efficiency and MS detection sensitivity. An interface including a splitter and a <b>make-up</b> <b>solvent</b> inlet was found to be the best compromise and exhibited good detection sensitivity while maintaining more than 75 % of the chromatographic efficiency. This interface was also the most versatile in terms of applicable analytical conditions. In addition, an accurate model of the fluidics behavior of this interface was created for a better understanding of the influence of chromatographic settings on its mode of operation. In the second part, the most influential experimental factors affecting MS detection sensitivity were identified and optimized using a design-of-experiment approach. The application of low capillary voltage and high desolvation temperature and drying gas flow rate were required for optimal ESI ionization and nebulization processes. The detection sensitivity achieved using the maximized UHPSFC–ESI-MS/MS conditions for a mixture of basic pharmaceutical compounds showed 4 - to 10 -fold improvements in peak intensity compared to the best performance achieved by UHPLC–ESI-MS/MS with the same MS detector...|$|E
40|$|AbstractCO 2 capture is {{recognized}} as necessary to achieve significant greenhouse gas emission reduction before 2050. Regarding these technologies, the main issue is {{the high cost of}} avoided CO 2 related to capture (≈ 40 €/t). In conventional amine-based CO 2 capture process, the four main key parameters driving the cost of avoided CO 2 are the regeneration duty, the compression works, the compressor cost and the <b>solvent</b> <b>make-up</b> cost. On the one hand, the use of hollow fibre membrane contactor (HFMC) for CO 2 capture is foreseen to be an efficient technology for absorber intensification; but regarding the impact of the absorber cost on the cost of avoided CO 2, the use of HFMC for process intensification does not seem relevant. On the other hand, ammonia as solvent for CO 2 capture is a cheap solvent with no degradation problem. Moreover, it allows a high pressure regeneration reducing the compression works. The key idea of this work is to find a membrane with high CO 2 /NH 3 selectivity and high permeability in order to use aqueous ammonia as a solvent in a HFMC in order to reduce significantly the ammonia slip in flue gases while maintaining high absorption rate. The work has been divided in three main steps: the screening of available material for the membrane, the laboratory test of the membrane and the modelling of the system for process assessment. For this absorption device a total equivalent work of 240 kWh/tCO 2 has been calculated for CO 2 capture on a coal-fired power plant...|$|R
40|$|Solvent {{degradation}} {{represents one}} of the main operational drawbacks of the post-combustion CO 2 capture process. Degradation not only induces additional costs for <b>solvent</b> <b>make-up,</b> it also impacts the process efficiency and its environmental penalty due to the emission of various degradation products. There is still a gap of knowledge about the influence of process operating conditions on degradation, making it currently impossible to predict the solvent degradation rate in CO 2 capture plants. Morever, the reaction mechanisms corresponding to solvent degradation are very slow, significantly complicating its study in industrial units. In the present work, appropriate experimental equipment and analytical methods are developed for accelerating the degradation of monoethanolamine solvents (MEA). The relevance of accelerated conditions is established by comparing artificially degraded solvent samples with degraded solvent samples from industrial CO 2 capture pilot plants. Two approaches are evaluated implying either discontinuous or continuous gas feed, this latest being the most representative of industrial degradation. The respective influences of the gas feed composition and the gas-liquid transfer are evidenced and quantified. Finally, the present study leads {{to a better understanding of}} solvent degradation in the CO 2 capture process with MEA. More generally, it also evidences that accelerated conditions at laboratory-scale may provide relevant information for the study of slow phenomena taking place in large-scale industrial processes. Further works include the development of a kinetic model for MEA solvent degradation and the extension of this methodology to other promising solvents in order to facilitate the operation and large-scale deployment of CO 2 capture.

40|$|Thesis (M. Ing. (Chemical Engineering)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2011. Using {{kerosene}} as an aromatic organic diluent in the liquid–liquid {{separation process}} for the extraction of uranium in the solvent extraction section of the AngloGold Ashanti South Uranium Plant {{near the town of}} Orkney in South Africa, incurs a multitude of safety, health and environmental problems. A possible solution may be to replace the currently used aromatic–based organic diluent with an aliphatic–based organic diluent. A range of aliphatic organic diluents were tested to determine the extraction efficiency of these alternative diluents, if they were to be applied to the process currently implemented by the AngloGold Ashanti South Uranium Plant. The aliphatic organic diluents under investigation were: Biodiesel-B– 100 Shellsol D 70 Sasol Wax SSX 150 Sasol Wax SSX 210 The aliphatic diluent yielding the highest uranium extraction efficiency, and having the most desirable physical characteristics, was Sasol Wax SSX 210. Sasol Wax SSX 210 was selected to replace kerosene as the diluent in the solvent composition to conduct the next phase of the study. The solvent’s composition was then optimised to obtain a desirable <b>solvent</b> <b>make–up</b> containing the newly chosen aliphatic diluent, third–phase inhibitor and tertiary alkyl amine. The most favourable solvent composition was found to be; 5 vol. % Alamine 336 with 2 vol. % isodecanol and 93 vol. % SSX 210. A third parameter, pH, was identified as an influencing factor on the overall efficiency of the process. A theoretical explanation for the influence that pH has on the process, confirmed by an experimental analysis, was examined to determine which pH characteristics contributed to the efficiency of the extraction process. A final indication {{of the success of the}} newly implemented aliphatic solvent was determined via a precipitation simulation. The structure of crystals precipitated from the loaded strip liquor (OK liquor) was evaluated to ensure that the required product would adhere to product specifications. Master...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThis {{paper will}} present Doosan Power Systems’ Post Combustion Capture (PCC) development, testing and {{verification}} activities. Preliminary {{results from the}} Boundary Dam TKOTM process, RSTM solvent trial and {{the results from the}} ERTF test facility will be discussed. Doosan Power Systems is developing competitive PCC technologies to capture carbon dioxide (CO 2) from coal and natural gas fired power plants for commercialization by 2020. Doosan Power Systems has licensed solvent scrubbing technology from HTC Purenergy Inc., which is based in Regina, Saskatchewan, Canada. HTC have developed an optimised Post Combustion Capture (PCC) process known as the Thermal Kinetics OptimizationTM (TKO) process which is designed to substantially reduce the energy requirements of the PCC process for the capture of CO 2 from coal and natural gas fired power plants. Doosan Power Systems is currently undertaking FEED studies and preparing commercial bids for full-scale solvent scrubbing plants, comprising all equipment from flue gas desulphurisation (FGD) plant outlet to CO 2 compression plant inlet. Among these are the CCPILOT 100 + and Basin Electric PCC demonstration projects. The TKO process is currently under a formal technology verification programme at the upgraded Boundary Dam demonstration pilot plant capturing approximately 4  tonnes/day of CO 2. Long term performance of HTC’s proprietary RSTM solvent is currently being assessed for CO 2 removal effectiveness and the long term performance of the solvent. Solvents are also tested for degradation, heat stable salt formation and propensity for corrosion within the various system components. Doosan Power Systems has installed a PCC solvent scrubbing pilot plant on the 160  kWt Emissions Reduction Test Facility (ERTF), located at its R&D centre in Renfrew, Scotland, to capture approximately 1  tonne/day of CO 2 and to permit further development and optimization of the process. The ERTF is capable of firing a wide range of world traded coals and produces flue gases representative of full scale plant. The ERTF solvent scrubbing plant will be used to carry out performance testing on a range of solvents, packings and suitability of a range of materials. The testing and verification programmes at both Boundary Dam and the ERTF will be used to substantiate the scalability of HTC’s technology under real-world operating conditions. Of paramount importance during the verification programmes are the actual rate of solvent degradation under industrial conditions, <b>solvent</b> <b>make-up</b> requirements, steam consumption and other auxiliary power requirements which add to power plant parasitic losses, such as that for fans to overcome the pressure drop created by column internals and associated pipework...|$|R
