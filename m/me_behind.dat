500|$|The verse {{may be one}} of few English nursery rhymes to have ancient origins. The Babylonian prayer [...] "Shamash before <b>me,</b> <b>behind</b> me Sin, Nergal at my right, Ninib at my left", {{is echoed}} by the medieval Jewish prayer: [...] "In the name of the Lord, the God of Israel, may Michael be at my right hand; Gabriel at my left; Uriel before me; Raphael behind me and the Shekhinah of God be above my head" [...] which is used as a prayer before sleep. A Christian version has been found for Germany {{at the end of the}} Medieval period. However, the first known record of the lyrics in English is from Thomas Ady's {{witchcraft}} treatise A Candle in the Dark, or, a treatise concerning the nature of witches and witchcraft (1656), which tells of a woman in Essex who claimed to have lived in the reign of Mary I (r. 1553-8) and who was alive in his time and blessed herself every night with the [...] "popish charm": ...|$|E
500|$|In 1876 {{hostilities}} {{broke out}} with the Bapedi people under Sekhukhune. Burgers had told the Acting President Piet Joubert not {{to fight a war}} in his absence, so the Transvaal government did little to combat the Bapedi raids. On his return Burgers resolved to send a commando against Sekhukhune; he called on Kruger to lead the column, but much to his surprise the erstwhile Commandant-General refused. Burgers unsuccessfully asked Joubert to head the commando, then approached Kruger twice more, but to no avail. Kruger was convinced that God would cause any military expedition organised by Burgers to fail—particularly if the President rode with the commando, which he was determined to do. [...] "I cannot lead the commando if you come", Kruger said, [...] "for, with your merry evenings in laager and your Sunday dances, the enemy will even shoot <b>me</b> <b>behind</b> the wall; for God's blessing will not rest on your expedition." [...] Burgers, who had no military experience, led the commando himself after several other prospective generals rebuffed him. After being routed by Sekhukhune, he hired a group of [...] "volunteers" [...] under the German Conrad von Schlickmann to defend the country, paying for this by levying a special tax. The war ended, but Burgers became extremely unpopular among his electorate.|$|E

Live, the sound {{is produced by}} a bass-rich guitar tone, used in combination with Whammy Pedal and the POG to create the heavily metallic sounding breaks of the song ("How dare you, {{how old are you}} now anyway" [...] and [...] "get <b>behind</b> <b>me,</b> get <b>behind</b> <b>me</b> now anyway".).|$|R
2500|$|Later, a Baton Rouge rape {{survivor}} confronted Vitter at a {{town hall}} meeting saying, [...] " [...] meant everything to me that I was able to put the person who attacked <b>me</b> <b>behind</b> bars ...

"Theo, be a painter, try to {{disentangle}} {{yourself and}} come to Drenthe… [...] So boy, do come and paint {{with me on the}} heath, in the potato field, come and walk with <b>me</b> <b>behind</b> the plow and the shepherd -- come and sit with me, looking into the fire -- let the storm that blows across the heath blow through you.

2500|$|In {{her second}} memoir, This 'N That (1987), Davis wrote, [...] "I am still {{recovering}} {{from the fact that}} a child of mine would write about <b>me</b> <b>behind</b> my back, to say nothing about the kind of book it is. I will never recover as completely from B.D.'s book as I have from the stroke. Both were shattering experiences." [...] Her memoir concluded with a letter to her daughter, in which she addressed her several times as [...] "Hyman", and described her actions as [...] "a glaring lack of loyalty and thanks for the very privileged life I feel you have been given". She concluded with a reference to the title of Hyman's book, [...] "If it refers to money, if my memory serves me right, I've been your keeper all these many years. I am continuing to do so, as my name has made your book about me a success." ...|$|E
