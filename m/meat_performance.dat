40|$|At {{the present}} time in Czech Republic {{we can see a}} growing number of sheep farming focused on <b>meat</b> <b>performance.</b> Sheep´s meat has a high quality and we can expect much higher demand for this product in the future despite its minimal present {{consumption}} in Czech Republic. Predominant concentration on <b>meat</b> <b>performance</b> of sheep is caused by sheep farmers through several factors that are modesty of meat breed, relatively easy farming technology and a wide range of marketing opportunities. At the same time it´s possible to combine this breeding way with the breeding of other animals and with various profit-making activities. The goal of this Bachelor thesis was an analysis of the <b>meat</b> <b>performance</b> level in herd of Sumava sheep in Michlova Huť. For this purpose I used information from the year 2009, 2010 and 2011, from which I deduced conclusions about this Sumava sheep farming. Based on these results the basic breeder recommendations to breeder community were deduced. Based on this analysis I found out, that the greatest average daily mass increase reached lambs in the year 2010 while the smallest values were noted in the year 2011. Concretely we see than the value of <b>meat</b> <b>performance</b> 216, 39 g/day in 2010 and the value 161, 25 g/day in 2011. The next conclusion is that there was no significant influence of paternal line on lamb´s <b>meat</b> <b>performance</b> during the observed period (2009, 2010 and 2011).

Lately, the milk performance of Czech Pied cattle has been increased by an improved nutrition (Bartoň et al., 1996 a) and immigration of dairy cattle genes into the population. Consequently, these changes had a negative impact on the <b>meat</b> <b>performance</b> of Czech Pied cattle. The aim of breeding is to minimize the depression of <b>meat</b> <b>performance</b> and to ensure satisfactory feedlot performance and good carcass composition. Therefore, the import of breeding bulls and semen of pied breeds of the Simmental origin was renewed (Golda et al., 1988). French Montbeliarde cattle are one of those breeds. Compared to Czech Pied cattle, the breed-ing of Montbeliarde cattle focuses more on milk performance. Breeders ’ attention abroad is also paid to milk performance rather than to meat per-formance of Montbeliarde cattle; they are supposed to have the best dairy parameters out of the dual-purpose breeds of Simmental origin. Therefore, foreign references concerning their meat produc-tion are scarce (Mikšík et al., 1996). Morisse et al.
