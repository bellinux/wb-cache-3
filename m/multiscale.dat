5|$|Multi-scale {{camouflage}} {{is a type}} {{of military}} camouflage combining patterns at two or more scales, often (though not necessarily) with a digital camouflage pattern created with computer assistance. The function is to provide camouflage over a range of distances, or equivalently over a range of scales (scale-invariant camouflage), in the manner of fractals, so some approaches are called fractal camouflage. Not all <b>multiscale</b> patterns are composed of rectangular pixels, even if they were designed using a computer. Further, not all pixellated patterns work at different scales, so being pixellated or digital does not of itself guarantee improved performance.|$|E

In the case of all wavelets other than the famous Haar wavelet, the simultaneous inclusion of compact supportedness, orthogonality and symmetricity is not possible. Theory of multiwavelets assumes significance since it offers orthogonal, compact frames without losing symmetry. We can also construct symmetric, compactly supported and pseudo-biorthogonal bases which are also possible only {{in the case of}} multiwavelets.
