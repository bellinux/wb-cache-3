40|$|Several {{studies have}} found {{evidence}} of <b>motor</b> <b>deficits</b> in poor readers. There is no obvious reason for motor and literacy skills to go together, {{and it has been}} suggested that both deficits could be indicative of an underlying problem with cerebellar function and/or procedural learning. However, the picture is complicated by the fact that reading problems often co-occur with oral language impairments, which have also been linked with <b>motor</b> <b>deficits.</b> This raises the question of whether <b>motor</b> <b>deficits</b> characterise poor readers when language impairment has been accounted for - and vice versa. We considered these questions by assessing <b>motor</b> <b>deficits</b> associated with reading disability (RD) and language impairment (LI). A large community sample provided a subset of 9 - to 10 -year-olds, selected to oversample children with reading and/or language difficulties, to give 37 children with comorbid LI + RD, 67 children with RD only, 32 children with LI only, and 117 typically-developing (TD) children with neither type of difficulty. These children were given four motor tasks that taxed speed, sequence, and imitation abilities to differing extents. Different patterns of results were found for the four motor tasks. There was no effect of RD or LI on two speeded fingertip tapping tasks, one of which involved sequencing of movements. LI, but not RD, was associated with problems in imitating hand positions and slowed performance on a speeded peg-moving task that required a precision grip.

50|$|Any score {{greater than}} or equal to 24 points (out of 30) {{indicates}} a normal cognition. Below this, scores can indicate severe (≤9 points), moderate (10-18 points) or mild (19-23 points) cognitive impairment. The raw score may also need to be corrected for educational attainment and age. That is, a maximal score of 30 points can never rule out dementia. Low to very low scores correlate closely with the presence of dementia, although other mental disorders can also lead to abnormal findings on MMSE testing. The presence of purely physical problems can also interfere with interpretation if not properly noted; for example, a patient may be physically unable to hear or read instructions properly, or may have a <b>motor</b> <b>deficit</b> that affects writing and drawing skills.|$|E
5000|$|There are two {{frequently}} used placing reflexes. They are tests which allow clinicians {{to assess the}} proprioceptive abilities of small domestic animals (cats and dogs in particular). The first test is to lift an animal and bring the anterior/dorsal surface of a paw up to a table edge. The normal animal will position its paw onto the surface properly. The second (sometimes called the proprioceptive positioning reflex) is similar. The dorsal (top) surface of an animals paw is placed onto a surface, and a fully healthy animal would flick it back up {{to be in the}} normal position (dorsal side up). If the animal cannot do this it implies that there is either a <b>motor</b> <b>deficit</b> or damage to the sensory pathway for proprioception, or damage to the centres of the brain which would normally integrate this response. [...] These brain centres would include the cerebellum, and possibly (debated) portions of the cerebrum. There is no evidence to suggest whether the cerebrum is specifically involved with this reflex. Evidence for the involvement of the cerebellum comes, in part, from the fact that cerebellar ataxia can lead to a loss of this particular reflex.It is sometimes referred to as a [...] "response", to allow for possible conscious cerebral influence of the action.|$|E
5000|$|Ideomotor Apraxia, often IMA, is a {{neurological}} disorder {{characterized by the}} inability to correctly imitate hand gestures and voluntarily mime tool use, e.g. pretend to brush one's hair. The ability to spontaneously use tools, such as brushing one's hair in the morning without being instructed to do so, may remain intact, but is often lost. The general concept of apraxia and the classification of ideomotor apraxia were developed in Germany in the late 19th and early 20th centuries {{by the work of}} Hugo Liepmann, Adolph Kussmaul, Arnold Pick, Paul Flechsig, Hermann Munk, Carl Nothnagel, Theodor Meynert, and linguist Heymann Steinthal, among others. Ideomotor apraxia was classified as [...] "ideo-kinetic apraxia" [...] by Liepmann due to the apparent dissociation of the idea of the action with its execution. The classifications of the various subtypes are not well defined at present, however, owing to issues of diagnosis and pathophysiology. Ideomotor apraxia is hypothesized to result from a disruption of the system that relates stored tool use and gesture information with the state of the body to produce the proper motor output. This system is thought {{to be related to the}} areas of the brain most often seen to be damaged when ideomotor apraxia is present: the left parietal lobe and the premotor cortex. Little can be done at present to reverse the <b>motor</b> <b>deficit</b> seen in ideomotor apraxia, although the extent of dysfunction it induces is not entirely clear.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Infarct size on T 2 -weighted MRI {{correlates}} only modestly with outcome, {{particularly for}} small strokes. This may be {{largely because of}} differences in the locations of infarcts and consequently in the functional pathways that are damaged. To test this hypothesis quantitatively, we developed a "mask" of the corticospinal pathway {{to determine whether the}} extent of stroke intersection with the pathway would be more closely related to clinical <b>motor</b> <b>deficit</b> and axonal injury in the descending motor pathways than total stroke lesion volume. METHODS: Eighteen patients were studied > or = 1 month after first ischemic stroke that caused a <b>motor</b> <b>deficit</b> by use of brain T 2 -weighted imaging, MR spectroscopic (MRS) measurements of the neuronal marker compound N-acetyl aspartate in the posterior limb of the internal capsule, and motor impairment and disability measures. A corticospinal mask based on neuroanatomic landmarks was generated from a subset of the MRI data. The maximum proportion of the cross-sectional area of this mask occupied by stroke was determined for each patient after all brain images were transformed into a common stereotaxic brain space. RESULTS: There was a significant linear relationship between the maximum proportional cross-sectional area of the corticospinal mask occupied by stroke and <b>motor</b> <b>deficit</b> (r(2) = 0. 82, P< 0. 001), whereas the relationship between the total stroke volume and <b>motor</b> <b>deficit</b> was better described by a cubic curve (r(2) = 0. 76, P< 0. 001). Inspection of the data plots showed that the total stroke volume discriminated poorly between smaller strokes with regard to the extent of associated <b>motor</b> <b>deficit,</b> whereas the maximum proportion of the mask cross-sectional area occupied by stroke appeared to be a more discriminatory marker of <b>motor</b> <b>deficit</b> and also N-acetyl aspartate reduction. CONCLUSIONS: Segmentation of functional motor pathways on MRI allows estimation of the extent of damage specifically to that pathway by the stroke lesion. The extent of stroke intersection with the motor pathways was more linearly related to the magnitude of <b>motor</b> <b>deficit</b> than total lesion volume and appeared to be a better discriminator between small strokes with regard to <b>motor</b> <b>deficit.</b> This emphasizes the importance of the anatomic relationship of the infarct to local structures in determining functional impairment.

40|$|Neuropeptide S (NPS) is a 20 -aminoacid peptide that {{selectively}} activates a G-protein coupled receptor named NPSR. Preclinical {{studies have}} shown that NPSR activation promotes anxiolysis, hyperlocomo-tion, arousal and weakfullness. Previous findings suggest that dopamine neurotransmission plays a role in the actions of NPS. Based on the close relationship between dopamine and Parkinson disease (PD) and on the evidence that NPSR are expressed on brain dopaminergic nuclei, the present study investi-gated the effects of NPS in <b>motor</b> <b>deficits</b> induced by intracerebroventricular (icv) administration of the dopaminergic neurotoxin 6 -OHDA in the mouse rotarod test. 6 -OHDA injection evoked <b>motor</b> <b>deficits</b> and significantly reduced tyrosine hidroxylase (TH) -positive cells in the substantia nigra (SN) and ven-tral tegmental area. However, a positive correlation was found only between the motor performance of 6 -OHDA-injected mice and the number of TH-positive cells in SN. The systemic administration of l- DOPA + benserazide (25 + 6. 25 mg/kg) counteracted 6 -OHDA-induced <b>motor</b> <b>deficits</b> in mice.

40|$|DYT 1 early-onset {{generalized}} dystonia is a hyperkinetic {{movement disorder}} caused by mutations in DYT 1 (TOR 1 A), which codes for torsinA. Recently, significant {{progress has been}} made in studying pathophysiology of DYT 1 dystonia using targeted mouse models. Dyt 1 DGAG heterozygous knock-in (KI) and Dyt 1 knock-down (KD) mice exhibit <b>motor</b> <b>deficits</b> and alterations of striatal dopamine metabolisms, while Dyt 1 knockout (KO) and Dyt 1 DGAG homozygous KI mice show abnormal nuclear envelopes and neonatal lethality. However, it has not been clear whether <b>motor</b> <b>deficits</b> and striatal abnormality are caused by Dyt 1 mutation in the striatum itself or the end results of abnormal signals from other brain regions. To identify the brain region that contributes to these phenotypes, we made a striatum-specific Dyt 1 conditional knockout (Dyt 1 sKO) mouse. Dyt 1 sKO mice exhibited <b>motor</b> <b>deficits</b> and reduced striatal dopamine receptor 2 (D 2 R) binding activity, whereas they did not exhibit significant alteration of striatal monoamine contents.
