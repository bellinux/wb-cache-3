25|$|A double-crescent trigger {{provides}} select fire capability {{without the}} need for a fire <b>mode</b> <b>selector</b> <b>switch.</b> Pressing the upper segment of the trigger produced semi-automatic fire, while holding the lower segment of the trigger produced fully automatic fire.

500|$|When the INS {{navigation}} {{systems were}} properly programmed with the filed flight plan waypoints, the pilot {{could turn the}} autopilot <b>mode</b> <b>selector</b> <b>switch</b> to the INS position and the plane would then automatically track the programmed INS course line, provided the plane was headed in the proper direction and within [...] of that course line. If, however, the plane was more than [...] from the flight-planned course line when the pilot turned the autopilot mode selector from HEADING to INS, the plane would continue to track the heading selected in HEADING mode {{as long as the}} actual position of the plane was more than [...] from the programmed INS course line. The autopilot computer software commanded the INS mode to remain in the [...] "armed" [...] condition until the plane had moved to a position less than [...] from the desired course line. Once that happened, the INS mode would change from [...] "armed" [...] to [...] "capture" [...] and the plane would track the flight-planned course from then on.|$|E

50|$|The Korg PS-3010 Polyphonic Keyboard is a {{specialised}} keyboard {{with its}} 48 keys (not 49) and proprietary 60-pin connector that {{connects to the}} Korg PS-3300 via a special cable, the Korg PS-3001. The keyboard has a trigger <b>mode</b> dial <b>selector</b> <b>switch</b> with 5 different trigger modes {{as well as a}} momentary switch for retriggering of envelopes during sustained notes, plus three on/off sliding switches. There is also an X-Y joystick with calibration sliders and separate CV outputs for X and Y direction movements, these can be connected to any of the many CV inputs of the three synthesizer units of the Korg PS-3300 for some advanced modulation control. In fact, if both CV outputs are patched to two of the individual Channel Amplitude CV inputs, it offers an early version of vector synthesis with different sounds fading in and out by moving the joystick.|$|R
5000|$|The weapon's spring {{extractor}} {{is installed}} inside the bolt head and enclosed {{in one of}} the locking lugs while the ejector is a fixed protrusion of the internal bolt carrier guide rail. The firearm uses a hammer-type firing mechanism and a trigger group that enables semi-automatic and fully automatic firing <b>modes.</b> The fire <b>selector</b> <b>switch,</b> which is also the manual safety toggle, can occupy one of three positions: the top [...] "safe" [...] setting (the trigger and bolt carrier are both disabled mechanically), the middle setting (marked with three dot symbols) produces continuous fire and the bottom setting (single dot) activates a disconnector for single fire mode.|$|R

50|$|One of {{the reasons}} the pistol grip style is so common in {{machinery}} is because it is possible to ergonomically position the operating controls.

50|$|The Brügger & Thomet MP9 (Machine Pistol 9mm) is {{a machine}} pistol {{designed}} and manufactured by Brügger & Thomet of Switzerland. The MP9 is a selective-fire 9×19mm Parabellum caliber machine pistol. It uses 15, 20, 25, and 30 round transparent polymer detachable box magazines. It has three safeties; ambidextrous safety/fire <b>mode</b> <b>selector</b> <b>switch</b> button (manual safety), trigger safety and drop safety. The MP9 is a {{development of the}} Steyr TMP. The design of TMP was purchased from Steyr in 2001.

50|$|The guitar {{features}} five knobs {{and three}} switches. The Vo Power knob controls {{the intensity of}} sustain and mute while the harmonic balance knob controls the balance of sustain and mute between the bridge and the neck. Additionally, the guitar offers a knob for piezo blend that combines the piezo bridge pick-up signal into the guitar's output signal. The last two knobs are conventional volume and tone knobs. The <b>mode</b> <b>selector</b> <b>switch</b> switches between full sustain, mute, and controlled sustain mode while the filter toggle switch controls the articulation of the Moog Filter. Last of all, the guitar features a conventional five position pick-up selector.|$|E
5000|$|The weapon fires from {{a closed}} bolt {{and has a}} hammer-type firing mechanism. It has a unitary trigger; a three-position {{combination}} fire <b>mode</b> <b>selector</b> <b>switch</b> / manual safety {{on the left side}} of the receiver sets whether it fires either the rifle or the grenade launcher or places it in [...] "safe". The assault rifle is equipped with iron sights contained in the carrying handle that consist of an adjustable rear aperture sight on a tangent leaf with range graduations from 50 to 200 m, and a forward post. The grenade launcher is aimed using a folding leaf sight. The weapon will also accept several optical sights, including the PSO telescopic sights which mount directly onto the carrying handle or, as on early models, onto a bracket {{on the left side of}} the receiver housing. The OTs-14-4A also has a night sight dovetail rail that will accept all standard night vision optics.|$|E

5000|$|... ===Ram / Slide=== The {{vertical}} {{motion of the}} slide acts like a hammer to an anvil. When presses are used manually, where an operator is loading and unloading parts, extreme caution should be used and proper methods of safe guarding should be in place. With the addition of safety light curtains and an I-PRESS control, the light curtains can then be muted or turned off on the slide upstroke to increase productivity when press is being used in single stroke mode. Standard modes of operation with up to date safe press controls are OFF-INCH-SINGLE STROKE & CONTINUOUS modes which can be selected via a keyed <b>mode</b> <b>selector</b> <b>switch.</b> Special modes of operation include, MICRO INCH-SSD/SINGLE ON DEMAND & CSD/CONTINUOUS ON DEMAND. Micro Inch is normally used for die set up near the BDC / Bottom Dead Center, SSD Single Stroke on Demand can be used when long coil feed lengths or automation loading and unloading will trigger SSD. CSD Continuous on Demand is normally used when press are used in roll form lines or irregular stroking is required when punching holes in large panel with gag feed dies.|$|E
40|$|The GRS is a {{one of the}} {{important}} units in Erbil Power Station EPS, which is responsible on controlling gas pressure and gas temperature this unit previously works manually. The local control panel for GRS system contains two types of digital signals the first one indicated by Light Emitting Diodes LED to point normal operations, fault and alarm, and event of operations while the second indicated by ON-OFF switches, which consists of two types the push buttons switch and <b>mode</b> <b>selector</b> <b>switch.</b> To overcome human in manual control faults in controlling GRS systems, automation system becomes the best solution. The purpose of this research is to design and implement embedded automation system {{that can be used to}} control a GRS automatically through a GUI and from remote location by using programmable interface controller (PIC 16 F 877 A). In this research the (PIC) software which is based on (C language), developed by Microchip (MPLAB) is used in programming a PIC microcontroller, then Visual Basic is used in the construction of GUI, the RS- 232 serial cable is used as a connector between PIC and PC. Implement the proposed design and test it as a first system shows all operations of GRS successful were converted into full computerize controlling (with the ability of full automatic control) from remote location through proposed GUI.
