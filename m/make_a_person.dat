5|$|The album's {{songs are}} characterised by metronomic pop, vocal harmonies, hand claps, {{prominent}} electric guitar riffs, bright synthesizers, a homogeneous sound and message, and rotations of lead vocals. The members' voices are presented individually on the record, and its lyricism speaks of falling in love, unrequited love, the insistence that flaws are what <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>person</b> unique, commitment, jealousy, and longing for past significant others. Take Me Home garnered mostly positive reviews from music critics. There was praise for its quality of production, while criticism hinged on its generic, rushed nature.|$|E
5|$|Her mantra may be {{repeated}} ten thousand times, repeated one thousand times while offering flowers and ghee {{in a fire}} sacrifice, or repeated one hundred times while offering water (Arghya) or while offering food to Brahmin priests. Her yantra (sacred geometric diagram), whether physically constructed or mentally envisioned, is used in worship along with the mantra. Offering certain items to a fire sacrifice—particularly those performed at cremation grounds, river banks, forests, or crossroads—while repeating the mantra is said to fulfil specific goals. An offering of Bael leaves is said to result in kingship; salt gives the power to control; turmeric gives the power to paralyse; neem twigs bring wealth; and an offering of sandalwood, camphor and saffron together or a salt and honey mixture grants the power to attract people. A rice-flour bread prepared while repeating her mantra is said to give the power to attract women. It is likewise {{said that it is}} possible to <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>person</b> one's slave by feeding him or her the ashes of a crow whose stomach was stuffed with a conch and burnt in a cremation ground while repeating the goddess' mantra.|$|E

25|$|Some Christians, both lay and clergy, {{live in a}} form of consecrated life, {{rather than}} in marriage.

While many of these also serve in some form of ministry, above, others are in secular careers, within or without the Church.

25|$|Treatment {{to reduce}} fever is {{generally}} not required. Treatment of associated pain and inflammation, however, may be useful and help a person rest.

Measures such as putting a cool damp cloth on the forehead and having a slightly warm bath are not useful and may simply <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>person</b> more uncomfortable. Children younger than three months require medical attention, as might people with serious medical problems such as a compromised immune system or people with other symptoms. Hyperthermia does require treatment.|$|E
500|$|... "Little Things" [...] {{is a song}} by English-Irish boy band One Direction {{from their}} second studio album, Take Me Home (2012). It was {{released}} by Syco Music on 3 December 2012, as the record's second single. The song was written by Fiona Bevan and Ed Sheeran, and produced by Jake Gosling. Bevan brought the song to Sheeran's attention {{while he was in}} studio with the group in 2012, resulting in the band recording it. [...] "Little Things" [...] is a mid-tempo pop and folk ballad about the insistence that flaws are what <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>person</b> unique.|$|E

500|$|... "Tocando Fondo" [...] {{is about}} [...] "those {{feelings}} which can <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>person</b> fall off a precipice." [...] "La Vailarina Vecina" [...] {{was inspired by}} a true story that happened to Arjona while he lived in Madrid. The singer commented about a woman: [...] "She was to do her trials and 'tickled', as the song says, all my roof, and those tickles didn't let me sleep." [...] He further commented that when he planned to meet her, he discovered that she was [...] "very beautiful". [...] "Vuelo" [...] is a piano ballad themed about tenderness, poetry and romanticism.|$|E
500|$|The {{notion that}} Vikings used A.muscaria to produce their berserker rages was first {{suggested}} by the Swedish professor Samuel Ödmann in 1784. Ödmann based his theories on reports {{about the use of}} fly agaric among Siberian shamans. The notion has become widespread since the 19th century, but no contemporary sources mention this use or anything similar in their description of berserkers. Muscimol is generally a mild relaxant, but it can create a range of different reactions within a group of people. It is possible that it could <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>person</b> angry, or cause them to be [...] "very jolly or sad, jump about, dance, sing or give way to great fright".|$|E
500|$|Their second studio album, Take Me Home (2012), is characterised by rock-inherited pop, {{prominent}} {{electric guitar}} riffs, bright synthesisers, a homogeneous sound and message, and the pitch-correcting software Auto-Tune. Alexis Petridis of The Guardian interpreted its signature sound as a [...] "peppy, synth-bolstered take on early-80s new-wave pop, heavy on clipped rhythms and chugging guitars," [...] which, he said, {{is at least}} an improvement on the substitute contemporary R [...] "that was once the grim lot of the boyband." [...] Jon Caramanica, writing in The New York Times, considered the album [...] "far more mechanical" [...] than their debut album, although noted that it is sonically and lyrically similar. The album's lyricism speaks of falling in love, unrequited love, the insistence that flaws are what <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>person</b> unique, commitment, jealousy and longing for past significant others.|$|E

500|$|The Chhinnamasta icon is also {{understood}} as {{a representation of the}} awakening of the kundalini– spiritual energy. The copulating couple represent the awakening in the Muladhara chakra, which corresponds to the last bone in the spinal column. The kundalini flows through the central passage in the body– the Sushumna nadi and hits the topmost chakra, the Sahasrara at the top of head– with such force that it blows her head off. The blood spilling from the throat represents the upward-flowing kundalini, breaking all knots (granthis)– those things which <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>person</b> sad, ignorant and weak– of the chakras. The severed head is [...] "transcendent consciousness". The three blood streams represent the flow of nectar when the kundalini unites with Shiva, who resides in the Sahasrara. The serpent in her iconography is also a symbol of the kundalini.|$|E
500|$|... "Little Things" [...] is a [...] mid-tempo pop {{and folk}} ballad which runs for 3:39 (3 minutes, 39 seconds). Written {{in the key}} of G major, the beat is set in common time and moves at a {{moderate}} 110 beats per minute. One Direction's vocal range in the song span from the note of A3 to D5. Instrumentation includes guitar strings, piano lines and vocals. The song utilises an acoustic guitar riff and a rotation of lead vocals. The song's lyrics revolve around the insistence that flaws are what <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>person</b> unique. In a September 2012 interview with MTV News, Sheeran quipped that the song [...] "is about {{the best things about}} someone, kind of like the things you wouldn't expect." [...] He described [...] "Little Things" [...] as an [...] "appreciation song," [...] and concluded: [...] "Seventeen-year-old Ed just wrote a lot of love songs".|$|E
500|$|Pop {{music critic}} Robert Hilburn {{described}} [...] "Speechless", and another song from Invincible ("Butterflies"), as being [...] "as woefully generic as their titles". Ben Rayner of the Toronto Star contested that the acappellas in [...] "Speechless" [...] {{were enough to}} <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>person</b> wish that Jackson actually was unable to make a sound. Michigan Daily writer Dustin J. Seibert wrote that the song was a [...] "shining [...] {{of what happens when}} The Gloved One gets beside himself and writes smarmy crap that should be reserved for a CD changer somewhere in a preschool". The Fort Worth Star-Telegram said that [...] "Speechless" [...] was one of the weaker tracks from Invincible. Elliot Sylvester of The Independent felt that the song was [...] "pure Jackson– almost to a formulaic fault". The Dallas Morning News Thor Christensen said that [...] "Speechless" [...] was [...] "produced by Mr. Jackson in bombastic style à la Celine Dion". He added that as the track ended with an emotional Jackson, it drew a parallel with the singer's 1972 ode to a rat, [...] "Ben".|$|E

500|$|The group's {{voices are}} {{presented}} individually on the record. Savan Kotecha {{noted that the}} Backstreet Boys' late-’90s hits inspired the way he formulated One Direction's voices for the album. Composer Julian Bunetta, who worked on three of Take Me Home tracks, also tried to place emphasis on the sound of each member: [...] "The fans can tell the difference, {{but we wanted to}} make sure that when it came on the radio, the average person knew that it must be One Direction, because it’s five guys." [...] Likewise, Caramanica noted that the album's songs produced by Bunetta [...] "tend to start out with more breathing room, giving the guys a chance to show off vocally". The album's lyricism speaks of falling in love, unrequited love, the insistence that flaws are what <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>person</b> unique, and commitment, in songs such as [...] "Little Things," [...] "Last First Kiss," [...] "Back For You," [...] and [...] "They Don't Know About Us." [...] Other tracks, like [...] "Heart Attack," [...] "Rock Me," [...] "I Would," [...] and [...] "Over Again," [...] have a more solemn tone, addressing jealousy and longing for past significant others.|$|E
500|$|Protection {{with respect}} to {{conviction}} for offences is guaranteed in {{the right to life}} and personal liberty. According to Article 20, no one can be awarded punishment which is more than what {{the law of the land}} prescribes at that time. This legal axiom is based on the principle that no criminal law can be made retrospective, that is, for an act to become an offence, the essential condition is that it should have been an offence legally at the time of committing it. Moreover, no person accused of any offence shall be compelled to be a witness against himself. [...] "Compulsion" [...] in this article refers to what in law is called [...] "Duress" [...] (injury, beating or unlawful imprisonment to <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>person</b> do something that he does not want to do). This article is known as a safeguard against self incrimination. The other principle enshrined in this article is known as the principle of double jeopardy, that is, no person can be convicted twice for the same offence, which has been derived from Anglo Saxon law. This principle was first established in the Magna Carta.|$|E
