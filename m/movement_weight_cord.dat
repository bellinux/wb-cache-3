A total of 663 twin pairs completed the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children- Revised and scores {{were available for}} Performance, Verbal and Total Intelligence Quotient (IQ). The intrauterine factors examined were birth weight, placental <b>weight</b> and morphology, <b>cord</b> knots, cord length and cord insertion. IQ scores for the varying levels of the intrauterine markers adjusting for gender and gestational age were calculated. The heritability of IQ and the association between IQ and intrauterine environment were examined. Twins with lower birth <b>weight</b> and <b>cord</b> knots had lower IQ scores. The aetiology of IQ is largely distinct from that of birth <b>weight</b> and <b>cord</b> knots, and non- shared environment may influence the observed relationships...|$|R

50|$|A typical {{pullover}} involves resting {{the upper}} {{back on a}} flat bench. The hips are kept slightly flexed. Keeping the hips off the bench is said to help in balancing the weight and stability during the <b>movement.</b> The <b>weight</b> is held above the chest with elbows slightly bent.|$|R
50|$|The push {{press is}} similar to the {{military}} press; however, the movement is started by a 'push' from the legs. This begins the momentum of the <b>movement,</b> the <b>weight</b> is then slowly lowered back to the chest. It can also be used from behind the neck, after a squat.|$|R
50|$|As {{the body}} {{gradually}} descends, the hips and knees undergo flexion, the ankle extends ("dorsiflexes") and muscles around the joint contract eccentrically, reaching maximal contraction {{at the bottom}} of the movement while slowing and reversing descent. The muscles around the hips provide the power out of the bottom. If the knees slide forward or cave in then tension is taken from the hamstrings, hindering power on the ascent. Returning to vertical contracts the muscles concentrically, and the hips and knees undergo extension while the ankle plantarflexes. In a weight bearing squat, the heels should always maintain contact with the floor throughout the <b>movement.</b> <b>Weight</b> shifting forward on to the toes, and off the heels creates unnecessary stress on the knee joint. This added stress may lead to inflammation or other overuse injuries.|$|R

He observed that the causes of these abnormalities were essentially due to the maintenance either of prolonged stationary postures or of unnatural postures and to activities that require heavy muscular performance. Although Ramazzini did not develop a detailed approach for the assessment of the factors associated with work related musculoskeletal disorders, he understood the relationship between posture, repetition of <b>movements,</b> <b>weight</b> lifting, muscular load and certain disorders, allowing him not only to describe the anatomical localization of the disorder, but also to identify intensity and duration of the risk factor...|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} {{designed}} to establish the morphological features of the placenta of the Martina Franca jenny. Ten placentas were harvested at the time of foal delivery and examined both for gross and histological characteristics. The following factors were determined: the total weight and volume of the placenta and its components, the surface area of the allantochorion, umbilical cord length and site of insertion, and the diameter of the umbilical cord vessels and vascular pattern type. The weight of the placenta was similar to previously reported for ponies, and represented 12 % of foal birth <b>weight.</b> Umbilical <b>cord</b> length was similar to that in the horse but longer than in the pony, while <b>cord</b> <b>weight</b> was intermediate between the two. In a histological examination, numerous strong villi were observed at sites corresponding to the non-pregnant and pregnant horn and uterine body.

If the premature development of cardiovascular risk factors can be anticipated during childhood, cardiovascular events can be prevented effectively by taking appropriate measures. This study was carried out to assess the role of in utero malnutrition in cardiovascular disease development by comparing cord blood lipid profiles and serum insulin levels between small-for-gestational-age (SGA) and appropriate-for-gestational-age (AGA) term newborns. Methods: Consecutive full-term infants who were born between June 20 and August 19, 2013, at the Obstetric Unit of a Hospital at Secunderabad, India, were enrolled in this study. Participating newborns were divided into SGA group (n = 51; test group) and AGA group (n = 52; control group) based on their gestational age and body <b>weight.</b> <b>Cord</b> blood lipid profile and insulin levels were compared between these two groups. Results: As compared to the newborns in AGA group, SGA group of newborns had significantly (P< 0. 01) higher levels of cholesterol, triglyceride and low-density lipoprotein. No difference was observed between the groups for high-density lipoprotein and insulin levels. Mild and moderate anaemia was observed among mothers of both groups, while severe anaemia was seen in mothers of SGA group only. Interpretation & conclusions: SGA newborns exhibited elevated lipid profiles as compared to AGA newborns. Hence, SGA newborns should be closely monitored for cardiovascular morbidities during childhood, adolescence and early adult life...|$|R

40|$|Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) {{are still}} the most {{abundant}} pollutants in wildlife and humans. Hydroxylated PCB metabolites (OH-PCBs) {{are known to be}} formed in humans and wildlife. Studies in animals show that these metabolites cause endocrine-related toxicity. The health effects in humans have not yet been evaluated, especially the effect on the fetus and newborn. The aim {{of this study is to}} measure the levels of PCBs and OH-PCBs in maternal and cord blood samples in a population with background levels of PCBs. We analyzed 51 maternal and corresponding cord blood samples in the northern part of the Netherlands. The PCB concentrations in maternal plasma ranged from 2 to 293 ng/g lipid, and OH-PCB concentrations from nondetectable (ND) to 0. 62 ng/g fresh <b>weight.</b> In <b>cord</b> plasma, PCB concentrations were 1 – 277 ng/g lipid, and OH-PCB concentrations, ND to 0. 47 ng/g fresh <b>weight.</b> The <b>cord</b> versus maternal blood calculated ratio was 1. 28 ± 0. 56 for PCBs and 2. 11 ± 1. 33 for OH-PCBs, expressed per gram of lipid. When expressed per gram fresh weight, the ratios are 0. 32 ± 0. 15 and 0. 53 ± 0. 23 for PCBs and OH-PCBs, respectively. A significant correlation between the respective maternal and cord levels for both PCBs and OH-PCBs was found. Our results indicate that OH-PCBs and PCBs are transferred across the placenta to the fetus in concentrations resulting in levels of approximately 50 and 30 %, respectively, of those in maternal plasma. More research in humans is needed to evaluate potential negative effects of these endocrine disruptors on the fetus. Key words: cord blood, human plasma, hydroxylated PCBs, PCB, placental transfer.
