5|$|Due to the {{popularity}} of the game in Spain, modifications to the traditional rules have appeared regionally, creating variations. The variants are played with similar rules to normal Tute, but differing in the number of cards, rules for declarations, and other minor <b>modifications</b> <b>of</b> the traditional rules.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the differences mentioned above, numerous other, local <b>modifications</b> <b>of</b> the structure, harmony or texture were applied to the original material. In these modifications, certain uniquely 'daring' original progressions were occasionally toned down, whereas in other places, the new version was even bolder than its predecessor.|$|E
5|$|In many plants, {{defensive}} or {{storage structures}} {{are made by}} <b>modifications</b> <b>of</b> the development of primary leaves, stems, and roots. Leaves are variously modified from photosynthetic structures to form the insect-trapping pitchers of pitcher plants, the insect-trapping jaws of Venus flytrap, and the spines of cactuses, all homologous.|$|E

30|$|There {{is a need}} {{to modify}} ATRS {{behavior}} to fit the current context. Feigh [21] introduced the four primary ways to be adaptive to changes. The first one is about the <b>modification</b> <b>of</b> the function allocation by dividing functions or tasks between people and machines. The second one is the <b>modification</b> <b>of</b> task scheduling (timing, prioritization, and duration); and the third way concerns <b>modification</b> <b>of</b> the interaction by providing different styles, amounts of data, and interface features. The last one concerns <b>modification</b> <b>of</b> the content, based on the quantity, quality, and abstraction. However, most ATRS just support one approach.|$|R

5|$|To combat delays, the {{standard}} committee allowed {{the creation of}} optional addenda which would add features more quickly than by {{waiting for the next}} standard revision. However, some committee members raised concerns about incompatibilities between implementations and frequent <b>modifications</b> <b>of</b> {{the standard}}.|$|E
5|$|Another {{indication}} that feet and other tetrapod traits evolved while {{the animals were}} still aquatic is how they were feeding. They {{did not have the}} <b>modifications</b> <b>of</b> the skull and jaw that allowed them to swallow prey on land. Prey could be caught in the shallows, at the water's edge or on land, but had to be eaten in water where hydrodynamic forces from the expansion of their buccal cavity would force the food into their esophagus.|$|E
40|$|Accumulation of {{advanced}} glycation end-products (AGEs) on proteins {{is associated with}} the development of diabetic complications. Although the overall extent <b>of</b> <b>modification</b> <b>of</b> protein by AGEs is limited, localization <b>of</b> these <b>modifications</b> at a few critical sites might {{have a significant effect on}} protein structure and function. In the present study, we describe the sites <b>of</b> <b>modification</b> <b>of</b> RNase by glyoxal under physiological conditions. Arg(39) and Arg(85), which are closest to the active site of the enzyme, were identified as the primary sites of formation of the glyoxal-derived dihydroxyimidazolidine and hydroimidazolone adducts. Lower amounts <b>of</b> <b>modification</b> were detected at Arg(10), while Arg(33) appeared to be unmodified. We conclude that dihydroxyimidazolidine adducts are the primary products <b>of</b> <b>modification</b> <b>of</b> protein by glyoxal, that Arg(39) and Arg(85) are the primary sites <b>of</b> <b>modification</b> <b>of</b> RNase by glyoxal, and that <b>modification</b> <b>of</b> arginine residues during Maillard reactions of proteins is a highly selective process...|$|R

5|$|By 1948, Croatia and Serbia {{agreed on}} two <b>modifications</b> <b>of</b> the border—the village of Bapska was {{transferred}} to Croatia, while Jamena {{was turned over to}} Vojvodina. No further changes to the border were agreed upon. A map of the area issued by the Yugoslav People's Army Military-Geographic Institute in 1967 depicts the border along the cadastre-based boundary, corresponding to the Croatian claim in the dispute.|$|E
5|$|DNA {{exists in}} many {{possible}} conformations that include A-DNA, B-DNA, and Z-DNA forms, although, only B-DNA and Z-DNA have been directly observed in functional organisms. The conformation that DNA adopts {{depends on the}} hydration level, DNA sequence, the amount and direction of supercoiling, chemical <b>modifications</b> <b>of</b> the bases, the type and concentration of metal ions, {{and the presence of}} polyamines in solution.|$|E
5|$|In eukaryotes, <b>modifications</b> <b>of</b> RNA {{nucleotides}} are {{in general}} directed by small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNA; 60–300nt), {{found in the}} nucleolus and cajal bodies. snoRNAs associate with enzymes and guide them to a spot on an RNA by basepairing to that RNA. These enzymes then perform the nucleotide modification. rRNAs and tRNAs are extensively modified, but snRNAs and mRNAs can also be the target of base modification. RNA can also be methylated.|$|E
40|$|O-linked N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) {{modification}} {{has been}} described in many proteins, including nuclear pore glycoproteins. In the present study we investigated the effect of extracellular glucose on the level <b>of</b> <b>modification</b> <b>of</b> nuclear pore protein p 62 by O-GlcNAc. We found that exposure of cells to {{a high concentration of}} glucose caused an increased level <b>of</b> <b>modification</b> <b>of</b> p 62 with O-GlcNAc, whereas the <b>modification</b> <b>of</b> other proteins did not change detectably. The increased O-GlcNAc <b>modification</b> <b>of</b> p 62 in response to glucose required the metabolism of glucose to glucosamine. The exposure of the cells to glucosamine itself also caused increased O-GlcNAc modification, whereas mannosamine and galactosamine did not. Furthermore, changes in glucose concentrations within the physiological range induced the O-GlcNAc modification in p 62 in rat aortic smooth-muscle cells, indicating that this <b>modification</b> <b>of</b> p 62 might occur in an intact animal. These results imply that the ambient glucose concentration has an impact on the level <b>of</b> O-GlcNAc <b>modification</b> <b>of</b> proteins such as p 62, and that functional changes in some of these proteins might ensue...|$|R

5|$|Persistent genital arousal {{disorder}} (PGAD) {{results in}} a spontaneous, persistent, and uncontrollable genital arousal in women, with or without orgasm, unrelated to any feelings of sexual desire. Clitoral priapism, also known as clitorism, is a rare, potentially painful medical condition and is sometimes described as an aspect of PGAD, in which the erect clitoris does not return to its relaxed state for an unusually {{extended period of time}} (ranging from minutes to days), despite the absence of both physical and psychological stimulation; PGAD can also be associated with morphometric and vascular <b>modifications</b> <b>of</b> the clitoris.|$|E
5|$|Recorded in an abbey {{shortly after}} Patch's death, the song {{consists}} of Thom Yorke's vocals {{and a string}} arrangement composed by Jonny Greenwood, absent of Radiohead's typical mix of rock and electronic instrumentation. The lyrics are {{from the perspective of}} a soldier in the First World War, and include <b>modifications</b> <b>of</b> quotations from Patch. While reception to the song was generally positive, with many critics praising the song's message, others criticised it as too sombre. The Patch family voiced their approval of the song's message and the band's charitable use of the proceeds.|$|E
5|$|The {{genitalia}} {{are complex}} and {{provide the basis for}} species discrimination in most families and also in family identification. The genitalia arise from the tenth or most distal segment of the abdomen. Lepidoptera have some of the most complex genital structures of all insects, {{with a wide variety of}} complex spines, setae, scales and tufts in males, claspers of different shapes and different <b>modifications</b> <b>of</b> the ductus bursae in females, through which stored sperm is transferred within the female directly, or indirectly, to the vagina for fertilisation.|$|E
40|$|Kethoxal <b>modification</b> <b>of</b> guanosines within Phe-tRNAPhe from E. coli was {{studied for}} tRNA {{in the free}} state and {{specifically}} bound to the ribosomal A-site. Complex formation with the ribosome results in a protection from chemical <b>modification</b> <b>of</b> two distant sites in the tRNA molecule. The guanosines affected are G- 18 and G- 19, located in the D-loop, and G- 34 in the anticodon loop. <b>Modification</b> <b>of</b> Phe-tRNAPhe in the absence of ribosomes leads to a destabilisation of the tRNA structure. Our data are consistent with the conclusion that <b>modification</b> <b>of</b> G- 34 at the anticodon loop triggers a conformational instability in distant parts of the tRNA molecule...|$|R

5|$|Although not an isolationist, Coolidge was {{reluctant}} to enter into foreign alliances. He considered the 1920 Republican victory as {{a rejection of the}} Wilsonian position that the United States should join the League of Nations. While not completely opposed to the idea, Coolidge believed the League, as then constituted, did not serve American interests, and he did not advocate membership. He spoke in favor of the United States joining the Permanent Court of International Justice (World Court), provided that the nation would not be bound by advisory decisions. In 1926, the Senate eventually approved joining the Court (with reservations). The League of Nations accepted the reservations, but it suggested some <b>modifications</b> <b>of</b> its own. The Senate failed to act; the United States never joined the World Court.|$|E
5|$|An area {{of current}} {{investigation}} in evolutionary developmental biology is the developmental basis of adaptations and exaptations. This research addresses {{the origin and}} evolution of embryonic development and how <b>modifications</b> <b>of</b> development and developmental processes produce novel features. These {{studies have shown that}} evolution can alter development to produce new structures, such as embryonic bone structures that develop into the jaw in other animals instead forming part of the middle ear in mammals. It is also possible for structures that have been lost in evolution to reappear due to changes in developmental genes, such as a mutation in chickens causing embryos to grow teeth similar to those of crocodiles. It is now becoming clear that most alterations in the form of organisms are due to changes in a small set of conserved genes.|$|E
5|$|Further complicating {{this picture}} are {{repetition}} patterns. There {{are two types}} of repetition in Rapanui words: double syllables within roots, as in mamari, and grammatical reduplication of disyllables, as seen in rongorongo. In the Rapanui lexicon, double syllables as in mamari are 50% more likely than chance can explain. However, in the rongorongo texts, analogous double AA glyphs are only 8% more likely than chance. Similarly, in the Rapanui lexicon reduplicated disyllables such as rongorongo are seven times as common as chance, constituting a quarter of the vocabulary, whereas, in rongorongo texts, ABAB sequences are only twice as likely as chance, and 10% of the vocabulary. If rongorongo is a phonetic script, therefore, this discrepancy needs to be explained. Pozdniakov suggests that perhaps there was a 'reduplicator' glyph, or that <b>modifications</b> <b>of</b> glyphs, such as facing heads to the left rather than to the right, may have indicated repetition.|$|E
