5|$|After {{gathering}} a large {{coalition of}} peoples, Alboin crossed the Julian Alps in 568, entering an almost undefended Italy. He rapidly {{took control of}} most of Venetia and Liguria. In 569, unopposed, he took northern Italy's main city, Milan. Pavia offered stiff resistance however, and was taken only after a siege lasting three years. During that time Alboin {{turned his attention to}} Tuscany, but signs of factionalism among his supporters and Alboin's diminishing control over his army increasingly began to <b>manifest</b> <b>themselves.</b>|$|E
5|$|On a computer, if {{the result}} of an {{addition}} is too large to store, an arithmetic overflow occurs, resulting in an incorrect answer. Unanticipated arithmetic overflow is a fairly common cause of program errors. Such overflow bugs may be hard to discover and diagnose because they may <b>manifest</b> <b>themselves</b> only for very large input data sets, which {{are less likely to be}} used in validation tests. One especially notable such error was the Y2K bug, where overflow errors due to using a 2-digit format for years caused significant computer problems in 2000.|$|E
5|$|Tests on the thorium uptake {{of workers}} {{involved}} in monazite processing showed thorium levels above recommended limits in their bodies, but no {{adverse effects on}} health were found at those moderately low concentrations. No chemical toxicity has yet been observed in the tracheobronchial tract and the lungs from exposure to thorium. People who work with thorium compounds are at a risk of dermatitis. It can take as much as thirty years after the ingestion of thorium for symptoms to <b>manifest</b> <b>themselves.</b>|$|E

5|$|Turkey's varied landscapes are {{the product}} of complex earth {{movements}} that have shaped the region over thousands of years and still <b>manifest</b> <b>themselves</b> in fairly frequent earthquakes and occasional volcanic eruptions. The Bosphorus and the Dardanelles owe their existence to the fault lines running through Turkey that {{led to the creation of}} the Black Sea. The North Anatolian Fault Line runs across the north of the country from west to east, along which major earthquakes took place in history. The latest of those big earthquakes was the 1999 İzmit earthquake.|$|E
5|$|While {{appearing}} in Don't Just Lie There, Say Something! at the Metro Theatre, Sydney in 1971, Terry-Thomas felt unwell and visited a doctor, who noticed his patient's left hand was shaking slightly; the doctor suggested a visit, {{upon his return}} to the UK, to a specialist, who diagnosed the actor with Parkinson's disease. Fearing the condition would affect offers of work, he did not make the news public, but as the symptoms began to <b>manifest</b> <b>themselves</b> in tremors, a shuffling gait, stooped posture and affected speech, he made the news known—partly to stop rumours of on-set drunkenness.|$|E
5|$|The {{tree that}} Hexxus is imprisoned in is cut down by Tony and Ralph, Zak's superiors. Hexxus quickly begins {{to regain his}} powers by feeding on pollution. He manipulates the humans to drive to FernGully. In FernGully, Zak meets Pips, a fairy envious of Zak's {{relationship}} with Crysta. Zak begins {{to fall in love}} with Crysta, but hides the true reason that the humans had returned. When the signs of Hexxus's resurrection begin to <b>manifest</b> <b>themselves</b> in poisoned trees and rivers, he finally admits that humans are destroying the forest. The fairies mount an attempt to defend their homes, but knowing their fight is hopeless, Zak convinces Batty to aid him in stopping the machine before it destroys them. When Zak makes his presence known to Tony and Ralph, Hexxus takes over the machine and begins to wildly destroy the forest.|$|E

25|$|At the Earth's surface, {{earthquakes}} <b>manifest</b> <b>themselves</b> by {{shaking and}} sometimes {{displacement of the}} ground. When the epicenter of a large earthquake is located offshore, the seabed may be displaced sufficiently to cause a tsunami. Earthquakes can also trigger landslides, and occasionally volcanic activity.|$|E

25|$|Structural {{problems}} {{began to}} <b>manifest</b> <b>themselves</b> {{even before the}} first building was completed, and in 1887, only {{three years after the}} opening of the main block, a major landslide occurred - predicted as a risk by the surveyors - and affected a temporary building.

25|$|Told in a first-person narrative, {{the story}} {{focuses on the}} author's {{discovery}} of the doubly fictional world of Tlön, whose inhabitants are completely idealistic and live imaginative lives. Relatively long for Borges (approximately 5,600 words), the story {{is a work of}} speculative fiction. One of the major themes of Tlön, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius is that ideas ultimately <b>manifest</b> <b>themselves</b> in the physical world and the story is generally viewed as a parabolic discussion of Berkeleyan idealism, and to some degree as a protest against totalitarianism.|$|E
25|$|Dispersivity is {{actually}} a factor which represents our lack {{of information about the}} system we are simulating. There are many small details about the aquifer which are being averaged when using a macroscopic approach (e.g., tiny beds of gravel and clay in sand aquifers), they <b>manifest</b> <b>themselves</b> as an apparent dispersivity. Because of this, α is often claimed to be dependent on the length scale of the problem — the dispersivity found for transport through 1m3 of aquifer is different from that for transport through 1cm3 of the same aquifer material.|$|E
