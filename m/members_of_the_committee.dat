5|$|During the Spanish Civil War, several {{countries}} followed {{a principle of}} non-intervention, to avoid any potential escalation and possible expansion of the war to other nations, which {{would result in the}} signing of the Non-Intervention Agreement in August 1936 and the setting up of the Non-Intervention Committee, which first met in September.

The awards in 1935 (to Carl von Ossietzky), 1973 (to Henry Kissinger) and 1994 (to Yasser Arafat) caused <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>committee</b> to withdraw due to {{disagreement with the}} committee decision. Six people have sat as the committee's secretary, who is also director of the Norwegian Nobel Institute.

5|$|On October 29, 1861, a {{group of}} Kentuckians—Johnson among them—met at Russellville, Kentucky to discuss the {{formation}} of a Confederate government for the Commonwealth, believing the Unionist government in Frankfort did not represent the will of the majority of Kentucky's citizens. Johnson chaired the committee that authored the convention's final report, and personally introduced some of its key resolutions. The report called for a sovereignty convention to sever ties with the Federal government. Johnson, Breckinridge, and Humphrey Marshall were among the notable <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Committee</b> of Ten that made arrangements for the convention.|$|E
5|$|The Third Convention met on July 17, 1775, also at St. John's Church, after Lord Dunmore {{had fled}} the capital (following the {{rejection}} of North's resolution) and taken refuge on a British warship.

The convention created a Committee of Safety to govern as an executive body {{in the absence of the}} royal governor (Dunmore). <b>Members</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>committee</b> were Edmund Pendleton, George Mason, John Page, Richard Bland, Thomas Ludwell Lee, Paul Carrington, Dudley Digges, William Cabell, Carter Braxton, James Mercer, and John Tabb.

5|$|Goebel's and Beckham's {{challenges}} to the election results were received by the General Assembly on January 2. The following day, the Assembly appointed a contest committee to investigate the allegations contained in the challenges, voter fraud and illegal military intimidation of voters among them. The <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>committee</b> were drawn at random, although the drawing was likely rigged—only one Republican joined ten Democrats on the committee. (Chance dictated that the committee should have contained four or five Republicans.) The joint committee on the rules recommended that the contest committee report {{at the pleasure of}} the General Assembly, that debate was limited once the findings were presented, and that the report be voted on in a joint session of the Assembly. The rules further provided that the speaker of the House would preside over this joint session instead of the lieutenant governor, as was customary. The Republican minority fought these provisions, but the Democratic majority passed them over their opposition.|$|E
5|$|Honorius II died in {{the night}} 13/14 February 1130 in the Roman monastery of S. Gregorio, after a long illness. Cardinal Aymeric {{arranged}} a hasty burial there and immediately called the <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>committee</b> to the monastery to proceed for {{the election of a}} new pope. But Cardinals Pierleoni and Gionata, realising that the commission certainly would elect a supporter of the Chancellor, withdrew from it hoping that a lack of quorum would prevent it from functioning. But Aymeric ignored this fact and the commission assembled with six members only. Despite the protests of Cardinal Pietro Pisano, who was a distinguished canonist, the committee elected one of its members, Cardinal Gregorio Papareschi of S. Angelo, who accepted the election and took the name Innocent II. He was enthroned in the Lateran Basilica early in the morning on February 14. His election was almost immediately recognized by six other cardinals: two bishops (Giovanni of Ostia and Mathieu of Albano) and four priests (Joselmo of S. Cecilia, Petrus of S. Anastasia and Giovanni of S. Crisogono; the identity of the fourth one is uncertain, but most probably it was Gerardo of S. Croce). In a short time they were joined also by the next eight cardinals.|$|E
5|$|On 21 January 1984 the Yorkshire Club committee, in {{the face}} of this rising pressure, agreed to offer Boycott a {{contract}} for 1984. Several <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>committee,</b> including Trueman, Billy Sutcliffe and Ronnie Burnet, resigned. Of the replacement members, 17 were from the Members 84 Group, and Boycott himself was elected, leaving him with both a position on the team and on the Yorkshire Club committee. The 1984 season was, however, not the most prolific for Boycott. McKinstry records that he scored slowly in several matches: 60 in 52 overs against Somerset; 53 in 51 overs against Hampshire; 17 in 26 overs against Leicestershire; 77 in 67 overs against Sussex. This was coupled with continued friction between himself and both players and club members. In particular, Boycott's place on both the team and the committee led to feelings of distrust from both – though Boycott denies this – which led to the loss of support from long-term ally Sid Fielden.|$|E

5|$|The company {{feared the}} unionization attempt and hired labor spies {{to follow the}} union leaders and {{determine}} their plans. The company leadership thought the AASEREA's demands were unreasonable, and believed it to be unfair for the employees' wages to exceed the income the business provided its shareholders. The union men discovered the spies and attacked and injured them. This began a rapid rise in tensions. Less {{than half of the}} company's employees had joined the AASEREA, denying Thorpe's committee enough support from the company's employees to enforce a strike. The AASEREA instead sought assistance from other Indianapolis unions. On October 30, a letter signed by Thorpe and other <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>committee</b> was sent to Robert L. Todd, President of the Traction and Terminal Company. In the letter he made a series of demands, including wage increases, reduced work hours, and the reinstatement of men fired for joining the union. The committee informed the company that the demands had to be met if a strike was to be averted.|$|E
5|$|When the {{official}} tally was announced, Taylor had {{won by a}} vote of 193,714 to 191,331. Though the Board of Elections was thought to be controlled by Goebel allies, it voted 2–1 to certify the announced vote tally. The board's majority opinion claimed {{that they did not have}} any judicial power and were thus unable to hear proof or swear witnesses. Taylor was inaugurated on December 12, 1899. Goebel announced his decision to contest the board's decision to the General Assembly. The Assembly appointed a committee to investigate the allegations contained in the challenges. The <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>committee</b> were drawn at random, though the drawing was likely rigged – only one Republican joined ten Democrats on the committee. (Chance dictated that the committee should have contained four or five Republicans.) Among the rules the General Assembly adopted for the contest committee were: that the committee report at the pleasure of the General Assembly, that debate be limited once the findings were presented, and that the report be voted on in a joint session of the Assembly. The rules further provided that the speaker of the House preside over the joint session instead of the lieutenant governor, as was customary. The Republican minority fought the provisions, but the Democratic majority passed them despite the opposition.|$|E
25|$|Questioning {{was carried}} out by various <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>committee</b> at {{different}} times, rather than all seven senators being present at all times. However, the work of the committee was very much dominated by Smith, who personally conducted the questioning of all of the key witnesses. This caused some tension among the <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>committee</b> and made him a number of enemies, as it was interpreted as an attempt to seize the limelight. It resulted in some <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>committee</b> only attending the hearings infrequently as there was little for them to do.|$|E
