25|$|Well, Jay, you {{absolutely}} are. I do apologize for any problems that <b>my</b> <b>lack</b> of sensitivity to perceptions has caused this movement.

25|$|I admire {{a lot of}} what's {{going on}} out there, but the {{oversize}} kind of cartoon action movies is not something I'm terribly comfortable with. I think what I do is much more in the tradition that the bullets are real and they'll knock you down. I used to really get criticized for <b>my</b> <b>lack</b> of realism, but now I think my films {{are perceived to be}} vastly more realistic than most of the action movies that are happening out there... I {{think one of the things}} about being a director is, you should always try to re-create within yourself the kind of emotions you had watching film when you were very young. The kind of action movies that I always liked, the kind of comic books I always liked, were the serious ones. The characters were very realistic within the framework of the drama, and that kind of action movie interests me a lot more than the super-heroes. And so in that sense, maybe I'm slightly out of step, I suppose, but so be it.|$|E
500|$|Several of {{the scenes}} {{were based on the}} actor's real-life talents as well as improvised. When Michael tells Pam to [...] "write this down", Jenna Fischer's {{response}} to the camera was improvised. [...] "I thought it was funny that I didn't have a pad of paper but Michael was telling me to take notes," [...] she explained in her MySpace blog, [...] "so I just looked to the camera and showed <b>my</b> <b>lack</b> of pen and paper." [...] Jim's impression of Stanley in this episode was inspired by John Krasinski's actual talent of doing impressions on the set.|$|E

500|$|On March 30, 1995, in Silverman v. Major League Baseball Player Relations Committee, Inc., Sotomayor {{issued a}} {{preliminary}} injunction against Major League Baseball, preventing it from unilaterally implementing a new {{collective bargaining agreement}} and using replacement players. Her ruling ended the 1994 baseball strike after 232 days, {{the day before the}} new season was scheduled to begin. The Second Circuit upheld Sotomayor's decision and denied the owners' request to stay the ruling. [...] The decision raised her profile, won her the plaudits of baseball fans, and had a lasting effect on the game. In the preparatory phase of the case, Sotomayor informed the lawyers of both sides that, [...] "I hope none of you assumed ... that <b>my</b> <b>lack</b> of knowledge of any of the intimate details of your dispute meant I was not a baseball fan. You can't grow up in the South Bronx without knowing about baseball." ...|$|E
500|$|Adams {{began her}} {{professional}} {{career as a}} dancer in a 1994 dinner theater production of A Chorus Line in Boulder, Colorado. The gig required her to wait on tables before getting up on stage to perform. Although she enjoyed singing and dancing, she disliked waitressing and ran into trouble when a fellow dancer, whom she considered a friend, made false accusations about her to the director. Adams said, [...] "I never really knew what the lies were. I only knew I kept getting called in and lectured about <b>my</b> <b>lack</b> of professionalism." [...] She lost the job but went on to perform in dinner theater at Denver's Heritage Square Music Hall and Country Dinner Playhouse. During a performance of Anything Goes at the Country Dinner Playhouse in 1995, she was spotted by Michael Brindisi, the president and {{artistic director of the}} Minneapolis-based Chanhassen Dinner Theater, who offered her a job there. Adams relocated to Chanhassen, Minnesota, where she performed in the theater for the next three years. She loved the [...] "security and schedule" [...] of the job, and has said that she learned tremendously from it. Nonetheless, the grueling work took its toll on her: [...] "I had a lot of recurring injuriesbursitis in my knees, pulled muscles in my groin, my adductor and abductor. My body was wearing out." ...|$|E
500|$|Soon after arriving, the 146th Brigade's leading battalions {{began to}} move south. On 21 April, Carton De Wiart's troops engaged in the first {{encounter}} of the war between British and German troops. The British troops, largely confined to the road network and advancing in deep snow, were engaged by a slightly larger German force that was supported by artillery and air support. The Germans, utilizing sledges, motorcycles, and ski-troops were able to outmanoeuvre and force back the British. German follow-up attacks did not materialize, however the Luftwaffe heavily bombed the small port at Namsos. Carton De Wiart cabled the War Office and stated [...] "with <b>my</b> <b>lack</b> of equipment I was quite incapable of advancing on Trondheim and could see very little point in remaining {{in that part of}} Norway sitting out like rabbits in the snow." [...] The evacuation was not ordered {{until the end of the}} month and then completed in the early days of May, following the loss of 157 men of Mauriceforce. The lack of success in Norway, and the withdrawal of the forces attempting to retake Trondheim resulted in the collapse of Chamberlain's Government. Carton De Wiart, considered a daring and aggressive commander, was – per historian Jack Adams – [...] "hampered by... climatic and geographic conditions" [...] in addition to his troops being [...] "inexperienced, poorly prepared and badly backed up".|$|E

2500|$|Although {{the play}} is {{realistic}} in many ways, particularly the dialogue between Ben and Gus, there are also elements that are unexplained and seemingly absurd, particularly the messages delivered by the dumb waiter himself, and the delivery of an envelope containing twelve matchsticks. Pinter is notable for leaving the plays open to interpretation, [...] "wanting his audience to complete his plays, to resolve in their own ways these irresolvable matters". Pinter stated that [...] "between <b>my</b> <b>lack</b> of biographical data about [...] and the ambiguity of what they say lies a territory which is not only worthy of exploration but which it is compulsory to explore".|$|E

2500|$|During 1979, von Balthasar distanced {{himself from}} a {{newspaper}} attack on Opus Dei which had cited his earlier accusations of integrism. [...] He wrote in a personal letter to the Prelature, sent also to the Neue Zürcher Zeitung, that [...] "because of <b>my</b> <b>lack</b> of concrete information, I am not able to give an informed opinion about Opus Dei today. On the other hand, one thing strikes me as obvious: many of the criticisms levelled against the movement, including those of your own journal concerning the religious instruction given by Opus Dei members, {{seem to me to}} be false and anti-clerical." [...] Von Balthasar maintained his unfavourable judgment of Escrivá's spirituality and repeated it in a television interview during 1984, but he did not renew his criticism of Opus Dei as an organization.|$|E
2500|$|E: Yes, I {{did not do}} it consciously. I saw all the sunset, but I didn't see {{the fence}} and large boulder that were there. I blocked out {{everything}} except the sunset. After I saw the sunset, I lost consciousness for three days. When I finally awakened, I asked my father why they had taken out that fence, tree, and boulder. I did not realize I had blotted them out when I fixed my attention so intensely on the sunset. Then, as I recovered and became aware of <b>my</b> <b>lack</b> of abilities, I wondered how I was going to earn a living. I had already published a paper in a national agricultural journal. [...] "Why Young Folks Leave the Farm." [...] I no longer had the strength to be a farmer, but maybe I could make it as a doctor.|$|E

Hanbury-Williams, whom Alexei liked, wrote [...] " [...] As time went on and his shyness wore off he treated us like old friends and… had always some bit fun with us. With me it was to make sure that each button on my coat was properly fastened, a habit which naturally made me take great care to have one or two unbuttoned, in which case he used to at once to stop and tell me that I was 'untidy again,' give a sigh at <b>my</b> <b>lack</b> of attention to these details and stop and carefully button me up again.” ...|$|E

I admit that I did not grasp {{the reason for this}} choice. During an interview a musicologist asked me about it, and I answered that the book had just come out and the composer had probably used it because it was at hand. Now, a few months ago Berio, whom I don't know, sent me a very disgruntled letter. He had read the interview, several years after the fact, and assured me that the movement of this symphony offered the musical counterpart of the mythical transformation I was revealing. He included a book by a musicologist [...] who had demonstrated the fact. I apologized for the misunderstanding, which was, I said, the result of <b>my</b> <b>lack</b> of musical training, but I'm still baffled.|$|E
2500|$|In Inward Hunger, Williams recounts that in {{the period}} {{following}} his graduation: [...] "I was severely handicapped in my research by <b>my</b> <b>lack</b> of money.... I was turned down everywhere I tried ... and could not ignore the racial factor involved". However, in 1936, thanks to a recommendation made by Sir Alfred Claud Hollis (Governor of Trinidad and Tobago, 1930–36), the Leathersellers' Company awarded him a £50 grant to continue his advanced research in history at Oxford. He completed the D.Phil in 1938 {{under the supervision of}} Vincent Harlow. His doctoral thesis was titled The Economic Aspects of the Abolition of the Slave Trade and West Indian Slavery, and was published as Capitalism and Slavery in 1944. It was both a direct attack on the idea that moral and humanitarian motives were the key facts in the victory of British abolitionism, and a covert critique of the idea common in the 1930s, emanating in particular from the pen of Oxford Professor Reginald Coupland, that British imperialism was essentially propelled by humanitarian and benevolent impulses. Williams's argument owed much to the influence of C. L. R. James, whose The Black Jacobins, also completed in 1938, also offered an economic and geostrategic explanation for the rise of British abolitionism.|$|E
