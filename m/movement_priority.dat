40|$|The monkey lateral intraparietal area (LIP) is {{involved}} in visual attention and eye movements. It has traditionally been studied using extracellular recording, where often a single neuron is recorded at a time. Thus we have a wealth of correlational knowledge of what LIP neurons do, but not how or why, i. e. {{we do not know}} the circuit mechanisms and functions of the observed LIP activity. In this thesis, we have aimed to uncover the circuit mechanisms underlying LIP activity by building tightly constrained computational models. 	In Part 1, we found that during two versions of a delayed-saccade task, beneath similar population average firing patterns across time lie radically different network dynamics. When neurons are not influenced by stimuli outside their receptive fields (RFs), dynamics of the high-dimensional LIP network lie predominantly in one multi-neuronal dimension, as predicted by an earlier model. However, when activity is suppressed by stimuli outside the RF, LIP dynamics markedly deviate from a single dimension. The conflicting results can be reconciled if two LIP local networks, each dominated by a single multi-neuronal activity pattern, are suppressively coupled to each other. These results demonstrate the low dimensionality of LIP local dynamics and suggest active involvement of LIP recurrent circuitry in surround suppression and, more generally, in processing attentional and <b>movement</b> <b>priority</b> and in related cognitive functions. 	In Part 2, we examine the mechanisms of learning in LIP. When monkeys learn to group visual stimuli into arbitrary categories, LIP neurons become category-selective. Surprisingly, the representations of learned categories are overwhelmingly biased: while different categories are behaviorally equivalent, nearly all LIP neurons in a given animal prefer the same category. We propose that Hebbian plasticity, at the synapses to LIP from prefrontal cortex and from lower sensory areas, could lead to the development of biased representations. In our model, LIP category selectivity arises due to competition between inputs encoding different categories, and bias develops due to excitatory lateral interactions among LIP neurons. This model reproduces the different levels of category selectivity and bias observed in multiple experiments. Our results suggest that the connectivity of LIP allows it to learn the behavioral importance of stimuli in order to guide attention...|$|E

To determine the differential effects of amplitude training on various hallmarks of handwriting abnormalities in PD. We randomized 38 right-handed subjects in early to mid-stage of PD into an experimental group (n = 18), receiving training focused at improving writing size during 30 minutes/day, five days/week for six weeks, and a placebo group (n = 20), receiving stretch and relaxation exercises at equal intensity. Writing skills were assessed using a touch-sensitive tablet pre- and post-training, and after a six-week retention period. Tests encompassed a transfer task, evaluating trained and untrained sequences, and an automatization task, comparing single- and dual-task handwriting. Outcome parameters were stroke duration (s), writing velocity (cm/s) and normalized jerk (i. e. fluency). In contrast to the reported positive effects of training on writing size, the current results showed increases in stroke duration and normalized jerk after amplitude training, which were absent in the placebo group. These increases remained after the six-week retention period. In contrast, velocity remained unchanged throughout the study. While intensive amplitude training is beneficial to improve writing size in PD, it comes at a cost as fluency and stroke duration deteriorated after training. The findings imply that PD patients can redistribute <b>movement</b> <b>priorities</b> after training within a compromised motor system...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{examines the}} impact of litigation on a social movement's dominant substantive goals and message. While scholars have devoted substantial attention {{to the study of}} social movement litigation, research in this area typically focuses on how social movements affect substantive law, or more broadly, how a movement's legal tactics bring about social change. By contrast, my focus in this dissertation is on how litigation affects the social movement itself. In particular, how does litigation as a tactic shape a social movement's collective agenda? How does it affect which perspective among possible competing visions comes to define the movement?I investigate these dynamics through a case study of the lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) movement from 1985 to 2008. The study involves three phases of original empirical research, each of which investigates a potential mechanism that may privilege litigation over other tactics in its ability to set the LGBT movement's primary substantive agenda. First, I use a content analysis of newspaper coverage of LGBT politics to determine which movement tactics have received the most media visibility. Second, I perform a statistical analysis of LGBT organizations to determine which movement tactics have been most associated with organizational survival and stability. Third, I perform a qualitative analysis of a subset of those LGBT organizations to examine variation in the strategy-formation processes used by primarily litigation-, lobbying-, or protest-based movement groups. The media content analysis revealed that litigation received more news coverage than any other LGBT movement tactic, suggesting that litigation had greater visibility than other tactics. In addition, the statistical analysis revealed that the movement organizations that used litigation had greater survival rates than other types of LGBT movement organizations, suggesting that litigation has been a particularly stable feature of LGBT politics. The qualitative analysis of LGBT organizations revealed further insights into how litigation may influence the agendas of non-legal movement actors. Whereas litigating LGBT movement groups proactively pursued preplanned organizational priorities, protest groups formed their agendas reactively, focusing on the issues covered by the mainstream media. This phenomenon appears to have diverted protest groups away from their original priorities and toward the issues that the media found newsworthy. Given my findings that litigation coverage dominated news headlines, the processes identified here may enable litigation to dominate protest activism as well. Taken together, these findings suggest that the media visibility and stability of social movement litigation may contribute to the prominence of litigation and cause legal goals to dominate the movement's overall substantive agenda. I describe this process as the "legalization" of a social movement's agenda. This dissertation makes a novel contribution to existing scholarship by exposing systemic processes that may privilege movement litigation relative to protest, elevating the issues being litigated to top <b>movement</b> <b>priorities.</b> Significant implications follow for theories of law and social change. Focusing on litigation narrows a movement's agenda because courts offer a forum for only those grievances that can be translated into legal claims. This may be particularly problematic for movements that base their legal claims in antidiscrimination law, which has become settled around quite limited understandings of equality as formal access to equal opportunity and discrimination as an intentional, individual harm. This interpretation not only denies remedies for the structural factors most responsible for perpetuating inequality, it also places the focus on preventing individual wrongdoing rather than producing substantive outcomes. Thus, when antidiscrimination litigation comes to define an equality <b>movement's</b> <b>priorities,</b> the <b>movement</b> may find itself privileging issues with little hope of creating substantive social transformation...|$|R

Al-Omari and Benekohal [6] framed a methodology to estimate delays at under-saturated two-way stop-controlled intersections. Empirical models were developed to determine service delay {{as a function of}} conflicting traffic volume. Troutbeck [7] developed relationships to estimate the capacity and delay for minor street vehicles by using the concept of limited priority at situations where minor stream vehicles forced their entry into a major stream. Bonneson and Fitts [8] described a methodology to predict delay to major street through vehicles due to left turning activity at TWSC intersections. This delay occurred when the demand of major street left turn exceeds the available storage area and blocks the adjacent through lane. Chandra et al. [9] developed a service delay model based on microscopic analysis of delay data in mixed traffic conditions. The mathematical relations were developed for service delays to vehicles based on types and <b>priority</b> <b>movements</b> at uncontrolled intersections. The presence of heavy vehicles in the conflicting traffic was found to have higher impact on the service delay.

40|$|A {{fundamentally}} {{important decision}} for all animals {{is whether to}} utilize a particular resource or to disperse elsewhere in search of potentially superior resources. Within this dissertation, I present results from laboratory experiments carried out using the experimental genetic workhorse, Drosophila melanogaster, to identify and quantify various causal factors contributing to an animal's decision to disperse from food. With the set of experiments described within the second chapter, I studied the influence of mating experience on the <b>movement</b> <b>priorities</b> of Drosophila. From these experiments, I suggest that prior mating experience is a significant and likely an important factor modulating the dispersal of Drosophila, and that the change in dispersal results from {{a change in the}} fly's priorities rather than simply a change in the general levels of activity. In chapter three, using methods similar to those used to assess the modulatory effects of mating, I explored how the amount and accessibility of food affects the dispersal of hungry Drosophila. From these experiments, I suggest that the hunger state of flies can override the visual and olfactory cues from food, and I hypothesize that the observed increase in dispersal resulting from hunger is due to a qualitative change in locomotor behavior related to food search. With a new machine-vision tracking strategy discussed within the fourth chapter, I studied the exploratory behaviors of individual flies within the environmental chambers discussed in Chapters 2 and 3. I introduced single flies that had recently consumed food into chambers and tracked their walking and monitored their flying movements as they became hungry. In collaboration, I have attempted to use learning algorithms based on the statistics of each fly's behavior during short windows of time to predict the fly's behavior during the rest of their experimental trial. I conclude with chapter five by describing a new experimental chamber that I have developed to complement machine-vision methods for tracking individuals within large groups. The motivation behind developing the chamber was to study the changes of social interaction, e. g., courtship and aggressive posturing, of flies near food. </p...|$|R

50|$|For several decades, the Polish {{national}} <b>movement</b> gave <b>priority</b> to {{the immediate}} restoration of independence, a drive that found expression {{in a series of}} armed rebellions. The insurgencies arose mainly in the Russian zone of partition to the east, about three-quarters of which was formerly Polish territory. After the Congress of Vienna, Russia had organized its Polish lands as the Congress Poland of Poland, granting it a quite liberal constitution, its own army, and limited autonomy within the tsarist empire. In the 1820s, however, Russian rule grew more arbitrary, and secret societies were formed by intellectuals in several cities to plot an insurrection. In November 1830, Polish troops in Warsaw rose in revolt. When the government of Congress Poland proclaimed solidarity with the rebel forces shortly thereafter, a new Polish-Russian war began. The rebels' requests for aid from France were ignored, and their reluctance to abolish serfdom cost them the support of the peasantry. By September 1831, the Russians had subdued Polish resistance and forced 6,000 resistance fighters into exile in France, beginning a time of harsh repression of intellectual and religious activity throughout Poland. At the same time, Congress Poland lost its constitution and its army.|$|R

Union democracy is likely an essential precondition for the broader strategic and organizational changes unions must undertake {{in order to}} recruit new union members — the labor <b>movement’s</b> cardinal <b>priority.</b> Yet according to widely accepted wisdom, the weakness of democracy within labor unions is the unavoidable outcome of an “iron law of oligarchy” that operates in all such membership-based organizations.

The main message is that labor law will directly or indirectly undermine what I call “workplace association,” a decisive strategic component in the florescence of union democracy, when, as in the US, it (1) provides for exclusive representation, (2) establishes institutions and procedures for collective bargaining, and (3) inhibits the use of economic “self help” as alternatives to such procedures. To reach this conclusion, the Article develops a game-theoretic model of union democratization, formalized in the Appendix, that highlights the role of union bureaucracy and workplace association in {{the success or failure of}} union democracy.
