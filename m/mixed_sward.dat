40|$|The {{effects of}} sward, breed type and sex on lamb growth and carcass {{composition}} were measured at two degrees of maturity in live weight. The three breed types were Scottish Blackface (no. = 60), Suffolk (no. = 59) and their reciprocal crosses (no. = 60). The lambs grazed swards of either ryegrass, clover or a <b>mixed</b> <b>sward</b> intended to contain both. The {{proportion of the}} <b>mixed</b> <b>sward</b> as clover was only 0 · 014. Each lamb was scanned using X-ray computed tomography to measure the weights offat, lean and bone in the carcass at two proportions of mature body weight (0 · 30 and 0 · 45). Live weights were recorded weekly. Average daily gains (ADG) in live weight and carcass tissues were calculated for each lamb between the 0 · 30 and 0 · 45 stages of maturity. At the 0 · 30 stage of maturity, breed type differences in carcass composition were small; the Scottish Blackface had 0 · 942 as much bone as the Suffolk lambs (P 3 ̆c 0 · 001), with the cross lambs intermediate. At the 0 · 45 stage of maturity, Scottish Blackface lambs had less fat (0 · 749 times as much; P 3 ̆c 0 · 001), more lean (1 · 065 times as much; P 3 ̆c 0 · 001) and more bone (1 · 055 times as much; P 3 ̆c 0 · 001) than did Suffolk lambs. The values for crossbred lambs were intermediate but closer {{to those of the}} Suffolk. Neither sward nor its interaction with breed type had any significant effect on carcass composition at either the 0 · 30 or 0 · 45 stage of maturity. The effect of sex on carcass composition was significant at the 0 · 45 stage of maturity when castrated male lambs had less fat (P 3 ̆c 0 · 001) and more lean (P 3 ̆c 0 · 001) than female lambs. There were breed type by sward interactions for ADG in live weight (P 3 ̆c 0 · 05), in carcass weight (P 3 ̆c 0 · 001), and in fat (P 3 ̆c 0 · 001) and bone weights (P 3 ̆c 0 · 05).

However, {{little is known}} about the agronomic properties of this Herb and Legume Mix. The objectives of this research were to examine key factors likely to affect the success of the Herb and Legume Mix as a perennial <b>sward</b> <b>mix.</b> This thesis included a series of glasshouse experiments, a grazing experiment (examining plant parameters and animal grazing preference) and a mowing experiment. The glasshouse experiments indicated that chicory and plantain have different strategies for coping with moisture stress. The results suggest plantain may be more productive under moderate drought due to its greater shoot mass fraction, whereas chicory may be more productive and persistent under severe drought due to its greater root mass and taproot diameter. The Herb and Legume Mix accumulated greater annual dry matter when removed under Hard grazing (post-grazing residual of 4 cm) compared to Lax grazing (post-grazing residual of 8 cm). Hard grazing favoured plantain growth and persistence, while Lax grazing favoured red clover growth and resulted in chicory with a larger taproot diameter. It was concluded that grazing management decisions should be determined by ensuring optimal management of chicory. Ewe lambs displayed grazing preference for species within the Herb and Legume Mix; however this varied between seasons and was affected by the species availability, vertical access and palatability. The Herb and Legume Mix had a greater herbage nutritive value than the ryegrass and white clover sward and had a more stable composition over time than pure swards of chicory and plantain under a wide range of defoliation regimes. The results suggest the Herb and Legume Mix might be a more flexible perennial forage option than pure swards of chicory and plantain. Overall the results of this thesis indicated that the Herb and Legume Mix can be successfully utilised in most New Zealand grazing systems as a perennial forage sward...|$|R

We have here investigated grass species abundance and different foliar nitrogen pools in 4 -year-old intensively managed grassland. Apoplastic pH and NH 4 + concentrations of the 8 most abundant species were used to calculate stomatal NH 3 compensation points. Apoplastic NH 4 + concentrations differed considerably among the species, ranging from 13 to 117 ?M, with highest values in Festuca pratensis. Also apoplastic pH values varied, from pH 6. 0 in Phleum pratense to 6. 9 in Dactylis glomerata. The observed differences in apoplastic NH 4 + and pH resulted in a large span of predicted values for the stomatal NH 3 compensation point which ranged from 0. 20 to 6. 57 nmol mol ? 1.

40|$|Grassland for {{livestock}} production {{is a major}} form of land use throughout Europe and its intensive management threatens biodiversity and ecosystem functioning in agricultural landscapes. Modest increases to conventional grassland biodiversity could have considerable positive impacts on the provision of ecosystem services, such as pollination, to surrounding habitats. Using a field-scale experiment in which grassland seed <b>mixes</b> and <b>sward</b> management were manipulated, complemented by surveys on working farms and phytometer experiments, the impact of conventional grassland diversity and management on the functional diversity and ecosystem service provision of pollinator communities were investigated. Increasing plant richness, {{by the addition of}} both legumes and forbs, was associated with significant enhancements in the functional diversity of grassland pollinator communities. This was associated with increased temporal stability of flower–visitor interactions at the community level. Visitation networks revealed pasture species Taraxacum sp. (Wigg.) (dandelion) and Cirsium arvense (Scop.) (creeping thistle) to have the highest pollinator visitation frequency and richness. Cichorium intybus (L.) (chichory) was highlighted as an important species having both high pollinator visitation and desirable agronomic properties. Increased sward richness was associated with an increase in the pollination of two phytometer species; Fragaria × ananassa (strawberry) and Silene dioica (red campion), but not Vicia faba (broad bean). Enhanced functional diversity, richness and abundance of the pollinator communities associated with more diverse neighbouring pastures were found to be potential mechanisms for improved pollination. Synthesis and applications. A modest increase in conventional grassland plant diversity with legumes and forbs, achievable with the expertise and resources available to most grassland farmers, could enhance pollinator functional diversity, richness and abundance.

40|$|An {{experiment}} {{was carried out}} {{to determine the effects}} of parasitic status and level of feeding motivation on the diet selected by sheep grazing perennial ryegrass/white clover swards. Twenty-four female Scottish Blackface weaned lambs were divided into four treatment groups each of six animals. Pre-grazing treatments were imposed to create two levels of feeding motivation, low (fed ad libitum) and high (0. 60 of an libitum diet) and two parasitic states, parasitized (daily dose of 2500 L(3) Ostertagia circumcincta) and non-parasitized. Each treatment group was placed in one of four 0. 35 ha field plots and allowed to graze a <b>mixed</b> grass/clover <b>sward.</b> Mean clover height was manipulated pre-grazing by cutting so that it was less than the mean grass height. This maximized the probability that clover in the diet of sheep was due to selection. No fertilizer was added to the sward in order to ensure that the nitrogen content of the clover was higher than that of the grass. Each treatment group was rotated around the four plots on a daily basis for 2 weeks. Sheep with a high feeding motivation strongly and significantly selected clover and had a higher proportion of clover in their diet compared with sheep with low feeding motivation. Parasitic status had no significant effect on the diet selection of sheep; but the level of parasitic burden within parasitized sheep was positively correlated with the proportion of clover in the diet. Parasitized sheep spent less time grazing each day and had lower daily herbage intakes compared with non-parasitized sheep. This was a result of a reduction in the duration of feeding bouts and not a reduced number of bouts per day. Sheep with the higher feeding motivation had a greater number of feeding bouts per day and this resulted in those animals having a greater daily herbage intake. Level of feeding motivation had greater effects on the diet selection of sheep than parasitic status. Sheep with a high feeding motivation are able to select strongly for clover in their diet when there is low overall clover availability and are capable of dramatically affecting the species composition of a sward. This has implications to the maintenance of a desired grass/clover ratio in grazed swards...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} {{examined}} the effect of management systems, particularly closing date and paraquat application, on the vegetative and reproductive morphology of 'Grasslands Huia' white clover (Trifolium repens L.) over two successive years in a field mixed (grass and clover) sward situation. More detailed studies involving two different genotypes of 'Grasslands Huia' white clover grown in monoculture were also carried out {{to examine the effects}} of cutting and paraquat application. The <b>mixed</b> <b>sward</b> studies clearly showed that November closing dates resulted in highest seed yields. In grass/clover swards the closing of crops in November accompanied by paraquat spraying to remove grass competition either in mid October or at closing, enhanced seed yield. Later grazing and spraying was deleterious to seed yield unless climatic conditions allowed continued vegetative growth into December. In this latter case spraying in November and closing in December gave high seed yields. Treatments involving closing in September and October and spraying 30 days before, at closing or 30 days after closing, always gave less seed yield than November treatments sprayed 30 days before or at closing time. Closing time and spraying time had a marked effect on seed yield components. The most consistent and major effect of closing and spraying treatments in the two <b>mixed</b> <b>sward</b> experiments was on inflorescence numbers. Other components such as seed set, seed weight, and floret numbers were not consistently influenced by management but did vary according to environmental conditions. Studies on the effects of cuttings and paraquat application on plant structure and on seeding potential and yield of 'Grasslands Huia' white clover clearly showed that there is a partitioning between vegetative growth and reproductive development. The vegetative process was characterised by a high percentage of the nodes on main stolons forming lateral stolons in the winter and early spring. Reproductive development in late spring and summer showed that approximately 80 % of inflorescences were formed on main stolons. Highest inflorescence numbers were produced from nodes formed in October and November, although floral initiation started during late winter (August). The two genotypes used in this study showed considerable variation in relation to reproductive development. Differences of 47 % in inflorescence numbers, 25 % in seeds per floret and 13 % in seed weight were observed between genotypes. The effects of defoliation by cutting involved a reduction in stolon elongation and a general increase in lateral stolon production, particularly when terminal buds were also removed. Both light and heavy cutting treatments resulted in seed yields which were 70 to 90 kg/ha less than the 657 kg/ha produced by uncut plants. The effect of paraquat application was also detrimental to seed yield, mainly through a direct effect on white clover morphology. Although paraquat reduced the amount of lateral branching on the main stolon the destruction of stolon tissue by the herbicide reduced plant recovery and resulted in a seed yield of only 392 kg/ha compared with 657 kg/ha from unsprayed plants. This effect was most pronounced in pure swards of white clover and was less obvious when the grass component of a <b>mixed</b> <b>sward</b> provided some protection for the white clover by reducing the extent of direct contact with the herbicide.

Pasture swards were placed in fanned (2 m s- 1 wind speed) and unfanned conditions {{for a period of}} 20 days and sampled at intervals. Depuration was carried out after a short (4 days) and a long (14 days) exposure period. Prior to contamination, a <b>mixed</b> pasture <b>sward</b> at a semi-rural location contained PCN concentrations 15 - 20 % of the PCB concentration. Uptake of both PCBs and PCNs was broadly linear in fanned and unfanned conditions over the 20 -day period, i. e., the pasture did not reach equilibrium with the air. Uptake rates (fluxes) were greater under the fanned conditions. The difference in uptake rates between fanned and unfanned conditions increased with degree of chlorination for both PCBs and PCNs, ranging between a factor of 2 for tri-chlorinated PCBs and PCNs and a factor 5 for octa-chlorinated PCBs. Depuration results over the first hours were very scattered, showing an initial period of loss, followed by an increase in concentrations, possibly as a result of re-volatilization of PCBs from the soil in the trays, with consequent recapture by the overlying sward. Rapid clearance was observed over the following days, but depuration of PCBs and PCNs was still incomplete after 14 days, with 20 % of the initial concentration of the PCBs and 10 % of the PCNs retained by the sward. There was no difference in the proportion of POPs retained in the sward between the 4 - and 14 -day contamination treatments. POP-specific differences in the amount of compound "trapped" in leaves after contamination were observed. The results show that, although changes in the rate of air movement around a pasture {{have an effect on the}} uptake rate of POPs into the vegetation, plant-side resistance controls both the air-to-pasture and pasture-to-air exchange of gas-phase PCBs and PCNs; i. e., differences between plant species in cuticle composition and/or structure affecting the permeability of the cuticle are of greater importance than differences in leaf morphology affecting aerodynamic roughness...|$|R

Sponsorship: Ministry of Agriculture Fisheries and Food and the Scottish Executive Environment and Rural Affairs Department. An experiment was conducted {{to examine the effects}} of mixed grazing of sheep plus cattle under continuous stocking of permanent pasture at different sward heights. The experiment had a 2 ? 3 factorial design, with two sward surface heights (4 ? 5 and 8 ? 10 cm) and three combinations of animal species viz., sheep only, cattle only and sheep plus cattle. There were two replicate plots of each treatment combination and the experiment was conducted over 2 years consecutively. The sheep were Beulah Speckled Face ewes and their single Suffolk-cross lambs while the cattle were yearling Charolais-cross steers. Six ?core? steers and six ?core? ewes and their lambs grazed plots, as appropriately, while additional, non-experimental steers and ewes and their lambs were used to maintain sward heights. Each year the steers and the ewes grazed the pastures from May to October, while lambs were weaned and removed each year from the experiment in July. There was no significant effect of mixed grazing on live-weight gain of steers, but ewes had significantly higher live-weight gains on the sheep plus cattle treatment than on the sheep-only treatment (82 ?v. 61 g/day; P 0 ? 05).

Earlier research showed that a <b>sward</b> <b>mix</b> of plantain (Plantago lanceolata), chicory (Cichorium intybus L.), white- and red-clover (Trifolium pratense) resulted in greater lamb live weight gains {{in the late summer}} early autumn period. However, this has not been tested across all the seasons in New Zealand. Therefore, research was undertaken for two consecutive years (2011 / 2012 and 2012 / 2013) on three <b>sward</b> mixes; Pasture <b>mix,</b> Plantain mix and Chicory mix in early spring, late spring and early summer (late spring), summer and autumn. The Pasture mix consisted of perennial ryegrass and white clover. The Plantain mix consisted of plantain, white- and red-clover. The Chicory mix consisted of plantain, chicory, white- and red-clover. It was hypothesised that lamb performance (live weight, live weight gain (LWG) and carcass weight) and apparent carcass weight production per ha would be greatest in the Plantain and Chicory mixes in all four periods. Secondly it was hypothesised that Plantain and Chicory mixes would have lower feed conversion ratios (FCR) with higher herbage utilization efficiencies (EHU%) than the Pasture mix. In each period weaned lambs were reared in the three herbage treatments for a maximum of two months. Lambs were weighed fortnightly and they were slaughtered within 12 hours of being off the pasture {{at the end of the}} experiment. Carcass weights were obtained from the abattoir. The Plantain and Chicory mixes had a higher feeding value than the Pasture mix during early spring to autumn. Both Plantain and Chicory mixes produced heavier (P< 0. 05) lambs, higher (P< 0. 05) live weight gains (LWG) and carcass weights compared to the Pasture mix in all periods. Total apparent carcass weight production per ha were 407, 748 and 709 kg/ha in year one and 474, 607 and 642 kg/ha in year two in the Pasture mix, Plantain mix and Chicory mix, respectively. Both Plantain and Chicory mixes had lower (P< 0. 05) feed conversion ratios (FCR) and higher (P< 0. 05) herbage utilization efficiencies (EHU%) compared to the Pasture mix.

The proportions of both white clover and creeping bentgrass content increased on all paddocks during the same period. For white clover, the size of the increase was negatively related to paddock size, whereas a positive relationship was found between the paddock size and the magnitude of the increase in creeping bentgrass.

The {{objective of this}} work {{was to assess the}} grazing intensity effects on the finishing of yearling bulls, in winter pastures in succession to soybean crop. Sward pre-grazing different heights of mixed pasture between ryegrass and oat were evaluated: 10, 20, 30 and 40 cm. A randomized complete block design was utilized with three replicates. Ten-month-old beef crossbred bulls were used, with initial live weight of 192 ± 12 kg. The following variables were evaluated: forage mass and allowance, sward height, forage daily accumulation rate and forage total accumulation, average daily weight gain (ADG), stocking rate and weight gain per unit area (GA), as well as the qualitative characteristics of the carcasses. The yearling bulls were slaughtered at 14 months of age. ADG fitted a quadratic model, with maximum performance between 20 and 25 -cm sward height, while GA fitted a negative linear model. Yearling bulls showed a satisfactory carcass quality when pastures were managed with pre-grazing heights higher than 10 cm. It is possible to finish yearling bulls in the pasture phase of integrated production systems, during winter, in succession to soybean crop.

40|$|The {{financial}} implications of manipulating nitrogen (N) inputs and management strategies for beef production systems were assessed. One-hectare grassland farmlets were grazed to a target sward height by beef steers; herbage surplus to grazing requirements was cut for silage. Three systems were compared: ‘CN’, conventional mineral N application to a grass monoculture and broadcast slurry; ‘TN’, tactical mineral N application at fortnightly intervals to a grass monoculture with slurry injection {{and the early}} housing of cattle; ‘GC’, a <b>mixed</b> grass/white clover <b>sward</b> with no mineral N addition and slurry injection. Comparisons were made on two contrasting soil types: a freely-draining sandy loam (site 1) and a poorly drained clay (site 2). Financial budgets for 1999 - 2000 show that estimated gross profit margins (gross outputs minus variable costs), after deducting contractor’s charges for sward preparation and fertiliser spreading, were highest for treatment CN at both sites Î(€ 1552, € 1356 and € 1461 ha- 1 for site 1 and € 1562, € 1281 and € 1287 ha- 1 for site 2, for treatments CN, TN and GC, respectively). Treatment TN was penalised by increased costs associated with an extended housed period {{and the need to}} purchase additional silage for winter feeding which cost € 242 ha- 1 at site 1 and € 250 ha- 1 at site 2. Savings in N fertiliser for TN in comparison with CN (€ 44 ha- 1 at site 1 and € 39 ha- 1 at site 2) were more than offset by the increased costs of fortnightly fertiliser applications (€ 54 ha- 1 at site 1 and € 46 ha- 1 at site 2). Treatment GC benefited from zero costs for the purchase and spreading of mineral N fertiliser but was penalised by increased variation in forage DM production which resulted in a shortfall in winter fodder requirements with a replacement cost of € 250 at site 1 and € 435 at site 2. The best overall economic performance after the allocation of all possible relevant costs (variable, fixed and capital) in terms of the relative net profit margin, was for GC at site 1 and for CN at site 2 (-€ 1358, -€ 2399 and -€ 1304 ha- 1 at site 1 and -€ 1122, -€ 2810 and - € 1380 ha- 1 at site 2, for CN, TN and GC, respectively). The opportunity costs of reducing N surpluses at the gross profit margin level (after contractor’s charges) for treatments TN and GC over treatment CN were calculated at € 2. 29 kg- 1 N surplus for TN and € 0. 67 kg- 1 N surplus for GC at site 1, with corresponding values of € 4. 91 and € 1. 57 at site 2.

40|$|The {{persistency}} of {{red clover}} (Trifolium pratense L.) can be poor when grazed in mixed and pure stands, {{but it is}} still regarded as a valuable source of high quality summer feed in some farming systems. Vegetatively reproductive red clover selections offer promise to solve this persistency problem. The objectives of this research were to study the growth, perennation, reproductive ability and productivity of vegetatively reproductive red clover selections. A series of nine spaced plant and <b>mixed</b> and pure <b>sward</b> experiments were conducted at Hastings, Dannevirke, AgResearch Grasslands and Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand (latitude 40 ° 23 'S) from 1995 to 1998. The vegetatively reproductive red clovers evaluated were cv. Astred, F 2419 and cv. Gualdo with Grasslands Pawera and Turoa used as controls. Preliminary investigations into the incidence of rooted plantlet production by prostrate red clover selections under grazing found 37, 16 and 5 rooted plantlets per parent plant for Astred, F 2419 and Turoa, respectively. Astred produced larger rooted plantlets which survived better than F 2419 and Turoa. Astred produced 57 % of its plantlets on primary stems, or branches off these stems, that grew from the parent plant crown in September, whereas F 2419 plantlets developed on a wider spread of stem ages. The majority of plantlets formed on quaternary branches at a range of distances (4 cm - 55 cm) from the parent plant crown. Astred produced less rooted plantlets per parent plant, had longer, wider leaves, thicker stems and was taller at 10 months of age than Gualdo. More rooted plantlets were established per Astred parent plant under wet surface soil conditions than dry conditions (22. 2 % and 3. 7 % gravimetric soil surface water content, respectively), but when the dry soil surface was watered, there was a compensatory {{increase in the number of}} rooted plantlets. Removal or retention of flowers did not affect rooted plantlet formation. There was no difference in the total herbage accumulated between Astred and Pawera in the first growing season, under 4, 6 and 8 week grazing frequencies, and lax and hard grazing intensities, but Astred produced more (P< 0. 001) herbage at the first spring grazing. Astred swards had significantly higher percentages of parent plants than Pawera in all treatments after two seasons grazing. Grazing intensity and frequency affected the number of rooted plantlets produced which ranged from 29 to 66 per m 2. The recommended grazing management for pure swards of Astred red clover is to graze every 4 to 6 weeks, or when pre grazing height reaches 30 cm, whichever is later, with a minimum post grazing residual of 10 cm over the whole grazing season for effective plantlet production. Pawera and Astred had contrasting total percentages of leaf and stem from 20 / 9 / 96 to 6 / 1 / 97 (P< 0. 001) with Pawera having thicker stems compared with Astred in all corresponding grazing treatments (P< 0. 001). The total percentage of regrowth for Astred or Pawera was not significantly different. The persistence of tagged parent plants of Astred and Pawera in the 6 weeks hard grazed treatment was similar until after 2. 5 years of age when (P< 0. 001) more Astred parent plants survived. Grazing intensity and frequency affected the number of all plantlets (plantlets with no roots, aerially rooted or rooted) produced, which ranged from 0 to 11 per m 2 for rooted plantlets after each grazing. In mixed swards on three farm trials at Hastings, Dannevirke and Palmerston North, Astred parent plant persistence decreased with increasing grazing pressure, but significantly more parent plants survived than for Pawera. The vegetatively reproductive red clover selections performed at productive levels that could make a significant contribution to New Zealand agriculture as truly perennial, taprooted forage legumes capable of increasing or maintaining their parent plant population over time under grazing...|$|R
40|$|White clover (Trifolium repens) is an {{important}} pasture legume but {{is often difficult to}} sustain in a <b>mixed</b> <b>sward</b> because, among other things, of the damage to roots caused by the soil-dwelling larval stages of S. lepidus. Locating the root nodules on the white clover roots is crucial for the survival of the newly hatched larvae. This paper presents a numerical model to simulate the movement of newly hatched S. lepidus larvae towards the root nodules, guided by a chemical signal released by the nodules. The model is based on the diffusion-chemotaxis equation. Experimental observations showed that the average speed of the larvae remained approximately constant, so the diffusion-chernotaxis model was modified so that the larvae respond only to the gradient direction of the chemical signal but not its magnitude. An individual-based lattice Boltzmann method was used to simulate the movement of individual larvae, and the parameters required for the model were estimated from the measurement of larval movement towards nodules in soil scanned using X-ray microtomography. The model was used to investigate the effects of nodule density, the rate of release of chemical signal, the sensitivity of the larvae to the signal, and the random foraging of the larvae on the movement and subsequent survival of the larvae. The simulations showed that the most significant factors for larval survival were nodule density and the sensitivity of the larvae to the signal. The dependence of larval survival rate on nodule density was well fitted by the Michealis-Menten kinetics. (c) 2005 Elsevier B. V All rights reserved...|$|E

This study {{compared}} the relative tolerances of subterranean clover (Trifolium subterraneumL.), balansa clover (T. michelianum Savi.), and gland clover (T. glanduliferum Boiss.) to acid soil conditions.

Due to drier than average seasonal conditions, none of the perennial species persisted beyond the first summer. Lime increased the herbage production of annual legumes by 18 – 22 % and total pasture production by 14 % in both 2002 and 2003. Subterranean cloverwas themost tolerant of the annual legumes to acid soil conditions, showingnovisible toxicity symptoms and no response to lime in terms of seed yield. In contrast, both balansa and gland clovers exhibited visual symptoms of manganese toxicity {{in the absence of}} lime, withMn concentrations in the shoots of 817 mg/kg and 626 mg/kg, respectively. Both species responded positively to lime with seed yields increasing by 45 % and 124 %, respectively.

Soil factors such as water potential (WP), soil pH, nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) levels are highly variable across mountainous grasslands. A greenhouse study was conducted to study the effects of WP, soil pH, N, and P levels on the herbage production and nutrient concentration of Kentucky bluegrass (Poa pratensis L.) and white clover (Trifolium repens L.) <b>mixed</b> <b>sward.</b> Central composite rotatable design was used to conduct this pot study. The effects of two levels of WP and five levels each of pH, N, and P fertilizers were evaluated. WP, pH, N and P levels as their interactions WP x pH, WP x N, pH x N, and N x P explained a significant part of sward accumulation in our trial. The importance of the different factors in explaining herbage accumulation variations was, in decreasing order, WP > pH > WP x pH > WP x N > P > N > N x P > pH x N. Optimum conditions for the production of bluegrass and white clover crop system were predicted, from this pot experiment, as follows WP of - 422 to - 171 kPa, 5. 5 to 6. 1 soil pH, 50 to 68 N mg·kg- 1, and 38 to 40 P mg·kg- 1. Concentration (%) of nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), potassium (K), calcium (Ca), and magnesium (Mg) were determined in shoot tissue to understand the impact of the different factors on nutrient content of forage. WP and soil pH had shown significant influence on concentration of all elements. Effects of soil pH and N level had significant effect on N concentration in plant tissue. Plant P concentration was significantly influenced by interaction of P level with WP and soil pH. Yield response function of Kentucky bluegrass and white clover mixture from this case study should be evaluated in field trials to obtain practical significance. Effect of WP, soil pH, and N and P levels on herbage accumulation of grasslands and nutritive value should be understood to harmonize productivity across this undulating landscape...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{consists}} of two parts. Part I describes field investigations carried out to examine {{the characteristics of the}} major species present in the herb layer in a range of perennial communities established at various sites in the Sheffield region. At each site quantitative measurements of seasonal changes in shoot biomass were conducted in association with analyses of soil mineral nutrient status and bioassays designed to allow seasonal release of phytotoxins to be detected. From the results of these studies it would appear that dominance in relatively productive and undisturbed vegetation is strongly associated with the capacity to develop a large summer peak in shoot biomass. This pattern is evident in the widely successful grass, Holaus lanatus, although in this species the size of the summer peak was found to vary considerably from year to year. From soil analyses it was apparent that mineral nutrient status plays an important part in determining the types of phenology represented in the vegetation. The results of bioassays conducted on various soils suggested the release of toxins from certain plants. At two sites toxicity appeared {{to be related to the}} rapid efflux of organic solutes from deciduous tree litter. Toxic effects were also detected in an area of derelict grassland colonized by Holcaus Lanatus. Evidence of autotoxicity in H. lanatus was obtained from the field and in a garden experiment. The experimental studies in Part II involved attempts to measure the effects of toxin production and competition by H. lanatus upon the growth of species with which H. lanatus is frequently associated in the field. In an attempt to manipulate the vigour and competitive ability of H. lanatus, studies were conducted to measure the influence of temperature and mineral nutrient supply upon a <b>mixed</b> <b>sward.</b> The results revealed a strong capacity in H. lanatus to suppress the vigour of H. lanatus and this ability was only marginally affected by variation in temperature and clipping regime. The results of the laboratory experiments supported the field evidence of toxic effects originating from H. lanatus.

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{defoliation}} on Amarillo (Arachis pintoi cv. Amarillo) was studied in a glasshouse and in mixed swards with 2 tropical grasses. In the glasshouse, Amarillo plants grown in pots {{were subjected to}} a 30 / 20 °C or 25 / 15 °C temperature regime and to defoliation at 10 -, 20 - or 30 -day intervals for 60 days. Two fi eld plot studies were conducted on Amarillo with either irrigated kikuyu (Pennisetum clandestinum) in autumn and spring or dryland Pioneer rhodes grass (Chloris gayana) over summer and autumn. Treatments imposed were 3 defoliation intervals (7, 14 and 28 days) and 2 residual heights (5 and 10 cm for kikuyu; 3 and 10 cm for rhodes grass) with extra treatments (56 days to 3 cm for both grasses and 21 days to 5 cm for kikuyu). Defoliation interval had no significant effect on accumulated Amarillo leaf dry matter (DM) at either temperature regime. At the higher temperature, frequent defoliation reduced root dry weight (DW) and increased crude protein (CP) but {{had no effect on}} stolon DW or in vitro organic matter digestibility (OMD). On the other hand, at the lower temperature, frequent defoliation reduced stolon DW and increased OMD but had no effect on root DW or CP. Irrespective of temperature and defoliation, water-soluble carbohydrate levels were higher in stolons than in roots (4. 70 vs 3. 65 %), whereas for starch the reverse occurred (5. 37 vs 9. 44 %). Defoliating the Amarillo- ikuyu sward once at 56 days to 3 cm produced the highest DM yield in autumn and spring (5832 and 7121 kg/ha DM, respectively), although the Amarillo component and OMD were substantially reduced. Highest DM yields (1726 kg/ha) were also achieved in the Amarillo-rhodes grass sward when defoliated every 56 days to 3 cm, although the Amarillo component was unaffected. In a <b>mixed</b> <b>sward</b> with either kikuyu or rhodes grass, the Amarillo component in the sward was maintained up to a 28 -day defoliation interval and was higher when more severely defoliated.

40|$|The water {{status and}} {{productivity}} of perennial pastures were monitored during irrigation cycles. Measurements of leaf water potential reflected the water {{status of the}} pastures and when this deteriorated with the developing shortage of water after irrigation, various responses of the pastures were recorded. These included the rate of leaf elongation, canopy conductance, and the rates of net photosynthesis and evapotranspiration. The Parameters of gas-exchange were Measured using open-system, field chambers. The studies were designed to characterise and Compare the responses of these Pastures as water deficit developed, and to quantify their,effects on productivity. Experimental plots included swards of white clover (Trifolium repens), perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne) and paspalum (Paspalum dilatatum) both as monocultures and as mixtures of the three species. These swards were growing on two soil profiles, {{both of which were}} Lemnos loam. The first profile was in its normal state and had been under pasture for fifteen years. The second had been structurally and chemically modified in 1979 to minimise the limitations to plant growth. It had been re [...] sown to pastures in 1980. The productivity of monocultures and mixed swards of each species on each profile was investigated as water shortage developed. In all species the responses to water shortage were the same, involving a reduction in the rate of development of leaf area,, followed by a reduction in photosynthesis per unit leaf area as the lack of water became more severe. The sensitivity of each species was distinct, with white clover being the most sensitive, ryegrass intermediate and paspalum the least. On modified soil, all species were less affected than on the normal profile but the order of sensitivity was the same. Overall, these experiments showed that after a typical irrigation cycle, which is about 8 days, water shortage reduces the productivity of white clover by 50 %, ryegrass by 20 % and paspalum by 5 - 10 %. These limitations to productivity were overcome to some extent by modifying the profile, so that after an equivalent period the productivity of white clover was only reduced by about 208 and paspalum was not affected at all. The ability of paspalum to maintain high levels of productivity during an irrigation cycle had the effect of promoting this species in a <b>mixed</b> <b>sward,</b> its dominance becoming greater as the shortage of water became more severe. In order to achieve balanced pastures of maximum productivity, farmers in the Goulburn Valley need to reduce the limits to growth imposed by the physical and hydraulic characteristics of the soils.

40|$|An {{eighteen}} month {{field trial}} {{was conducted to}} determine the effect of soil loosening on plant nutrition and pasture production. The field trial was conducted on an established (8 year old) <b>mixed</b> <b>sward</b> pasture. The soil type was a Templeton silt loam (yellow-grey earth) of low to medium fertility. Two layers were identified as likely to be restrictive to root growth (22 - 27 cm and 40 - 60 cm). The statistical design was a randomised block consisting of thirty-six plots (8 m x 8 m) in four replicates. The three cultivation treatments of nil cultivation, aeration (to 27 cm) and subsoiling (to 47 cm) were carried out on the 10 -Nov- 90 and 10 - 0 ct- 90 respectively. On 22 -Dec- 90 three fertiliser treatments were applied: nil fertiliser, phosphate only (30 kg P ha⁻¹) and phosphate (as above) plus sulphate fertiliser (30 kg S ha⁻¹). The pasture was harvested when plant height reached approximately 8 - 10 cm. Pasture production and macro nutrient concentration were determined for each pasture harvest. From 1 -Aug- 91 root length measurements were made at monthly intervals. Soil water content was measured at weekly intervals at six depths (20, 30, 35, 40, 50 and 70 cm) using Time-Domain-Reflectrometry. Soil bulk density and hydraulic conductivity were measured at two dates during the period of the trial. Although root pruning by the loosening implements was suspected to have slightly reduced pasture production from 7 -Nov- 90 to 22 -Apr- 91, soil loosening led to a significant (P< 0. 10) increase in pasture production of approximately 1, 300 kg DM ha⁻¹ over the second season (1991 / 1992) of the trial. Loosening by cultivation of the compacted soil layers significantly (P< 0. 10) reduced bulk density (11 % reduction) and significantly (p< 0. 10) increased porosity. Through the creation of soil physical conditions which were more favourable for root growth, soil loosening allowed the earlier onset of spring root growth, and root growth rates were 0. 06 mm cm⁻² d⁻¹ higher than in the nil cultivation treatment. Subsoil loosening created a more extensive pasture root system compared to the nil cultivation treatment. By 18 -Jan- 92 the subsoil loosened treatment had a significantly (P< 0. 10) larger root length (44 % higher) at the 30 - 60 cm depth than the nil cultivation treatment. The subsoiled treatment had a significantly (P< 0. 10) drier soil profile (0 - 70 cm) over the 1991 / 1992 season. This was considered to be due to higher soil drainage rates in late winter/early spring and a small increase in water use by the pasture. Soil loosening was found to result in a significant (P< 0. 10) increase (5 kg S ha⁻¹) in sulphur uptake by the pasture plants. The Templeton silt loam of the trial site was found to be deficient in sulphur, with particularly low concentrations (< 3 µg SO₄ ²⁻ g⁻¹) occurring in the top soil. The sulphate concentration was higher (10 µg SO₄ ²⁻ g⁻¹) in the lower soil depths (30 - 50 cm). The more extensive pasture root system at this depth in the loosened treatments therefore had greater access to this sulphur, and resulted in increased pasture uptake of sulphur and increased pasture production on the loosened treatments. Pasture grown on the loosened treatments tended to have higher concentrations of several macronutrients (S, Ca, Mg and Na) particularly during spring and mid-summer. The concentration of these four macronutrients in this Templeton silt loam were also found to increase below a depth of approximately 30 cm. The greater root lengths below 30 cm in the loosened treatments allowed the pasture roots greater access and consequently higher uptakes of these nutrients. In August 1991 a microplot trial was established in an attempt to establish accurately the nutrient uptake potential of roots present in the trial plots. Radioactive tracers (³²p and ³⁵S) were injected to three depths (25, 40, and 55 cm) in the soil profile. The 80 cm diameter microplots were harvested when pasture height reached approximately 8 cm. The pasture samples were then dissected, dried, ground and the tracer activity determined. The subsoiled treatment was found to have a higher cumulative ³⁵S percent recovery from the 55 cm injection depth, confirming the results of the main trial...|$|E
