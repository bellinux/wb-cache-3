50|$|A gas <b>meter</b> <b>prover</b> is {{a device}} which verifies the {{accuracy}} of a gas meter. Provers are typically used in gas meter repair facilities, municipal gas meter shops, and public works shops. Provers work by passing a known volume of air through a meter while monitoring the gas meters register, index, or internal displacement. The prover then displays a proof, a value expressed as a percent which compares the volume of air passed with the volume of air measured to determine the meters accuracy.|$|E
40|$|The paper {{talks about}} the {{principles}} and applications of current and emerging crude and hydrocarbon flow measurement technologies. It highlights the applications of flow metering technologies, {{in the world and}} in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Emphasis is put on better precision and higher accuracy in volumetric and mass custody and royalty transfer through put measurement, of crude and hydrocarbon fluids. Through finer precision and higher accuracy, when applied to exports and domestic consumption, proper accountability can be achieved and tremendous cost savings realized. “ We cannot be held accountable for what we can not measure ”. Topics of presentation consist of the science of measurement, application of current and emerging technologies in the world of hydrocarbon measurements and the proactive role Saudi Aramco is playing in this research and application. The technologies that will be briefly discussed are, the use of the master meter in certifying crude and product meter provers as an applied technology and its comparison in accuracy to conventional methods of <b>meter</b> <b>prover</b> certification. Other devices consist of the principles and sciences of gas flow measurement, the various water- in- crude detection instruments, currently under research in Saudi Aramco and the application and viability to custody measurement, where accuracy is far more stringent than that of process condition, of the new mass and hellicoidal flow meters. A brief outline of the presentation is as follows...|$|E
50|$|A typical liquid custody {{transfer}} skid includes multiple flowmeters and <b>meter</b> <b>provers.</b> Provers {{are used to}} calibrate meters in-situ and are performed frequently; typically before, during, and after a batch transfer for metering assurance. A {{good example of this}} is a Lease Automatic Custody Transfer(LACT) unit in a crude oil production facility.|$|R
40|$|Field <b>meter</b> <b>provers</b> are flow <b>meters</b> used {{to verify}} in-situ the {{performance}} of flow meters at field meter stations. The objective of this work was to review the state-of-the art of field meter proving technology to identify any recent developments that may allow for in-situ proving of natural gas flow meters on a broader scale. Particular {{emphasis was placed on}} identifying technologies that have emerged since December 1995, when a topical report entitled ""Metering Research Facility Program: Review of Field Meter Provers"" (GRI- 95 / 0209) was published. There have been significant improvements in the measurement performance of ultrasonic gas flow meters. The performance of multipath ultrasonic gas flow meters has improved {{to the point that they}} now approach the measurement performance level of other proving technologies, such as sonic nozzles and turbine flow meters. A new rotary piston meter design (that uses multiple rotors to reduce pulsations) and new dual-rotor turbine meter designs have entered the marketplace. Many of the gas <b>meter</b> field <b>provers</b> that were in existence in the early 1990 s are no longer in service. It is speculated that these provers were not capable of providing cost-effective field meter proofs, and thus, their use has been discontinued. "...|$|R
50|$|Flow {{computers}} are available as completely programmable devices {{using a variety}} of software tools or as configurable devices using manufacturer's specific configuration software packages to set up interfaces to gas chromatographs, gas ultrasonic <b>meters,</b> liquid <b>provers,</b> flow control valves, PLC, DCS, SCADA and industry-recognized HMI supervisory systems. Modbus/TCP is a standard offering via Ethernet interfaces from some flow computers, although other communications protocols, such as OLE are supported by some flow computers. Security issues are very significant in SCADA system development using flow computers.|$|R
