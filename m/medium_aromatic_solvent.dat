40|$|A {{validated}} ion chromatographic {{method was}} developed and applied for {{the determination of the}} maximum solubility of pyridinium ionic liquids in several <b>aromatic</b> <b>solvents.</b> Elution was performed on a Metrosep C 3 – 150 prototype column at 408 C with acetonitrile–water at a flow rate of 1. 0 mL min 21. Mixtures of pyridinium ionic liquids and <b>aromatic</b> <b>solvents</b> were diluted with acetonitrile and acetone on a 1 : 1 : 2 weight base before the analysis. The chromatographic time only took 20 min. The standard curves for both pyridinium ionic liquids ([4 -mebupy]BF 4 and [3 -mebupy]N(CN) 2) were linear (r 2 5 0. 9980 – 0. 9998) in all <b>aromatic</b> <b>solvents</b> (toluene, benzene, ethylben-zene and o-xylene) in the concentration range of 5. 37 – 241 mg kg 21. The intraday relative standard deviations (n 5 3) for peak areas were 0. 60 – 2. 9 %. Accuracy in the measurement of samples ranged from 98. 5 to 105 %. The limit of detection for both pyridinium ionic liquids in all solvents varied between 0. 73 and 2. 6 mg kg 21. This assay has been successfully applied in the determination of the maximum solu-bilities of both pyridinium ionic liquids in several <b>aromatic</b> <b>solvents.</b> This method demonstrated that with increasing aromatic character and/or temperature the solubilities of both investigated pyridinium ILs in the <b>aromatic</b> <b>solvents</b> increase.

40|$|Problem statement: The {{variations}} of formyl proton Chemical Shifts (CS) of p-substituted benzaldehydes in <b>aromatic</b> <b>solvents</b> were investigated. The validity of several physical solvent and empirical solvent scales was examined. Also, to predict dipolarity-polarizability (&# 960; *) solvent scale for some <b>aromatic</b> <b>solvents.</b> Model designing was also achieved to rationalize the <b>aromatic</b> <b>solvent</b> {{effect on the}} formyl proton CS. Approach: The previously recorded formyl proton CS for p-X- benzaldehydes, with X were NMe 2, OMe, OC 3 H 7, H, Br, CHO and NO 2 in benzene, toluene, p-xylene, m-xylene and mesitylene were subjected to Factor Analysis (FA). Target Factor Testing technique (TFT) was performed for several solvent scales namely: Unity, the intrinsic <b>aromatic</b> <b>solvent</b> induced shift of TMS (IASISTMS), f(n), f(d), (n 2 - 1) /(n 2 + 2), (d- 1) /(d+ 2), E T (30) and &# 960; *. Iterative TFT was applied to predict unmeasured (&# 960; *) solvent scale for ethyl benzene, n-butyl benzene, sec-butyl benzene, tert-butyl benzene and isopropyl benzene. Results: It {{has been found that}} two factors were responsible for the variation in the formyl proton CS. The unity, f(n), (n 2 - 1) /(n 2 + 2), IASISTMS, E T (30) and &# 960; * were real factors. Model designing of the formyl proton CS in benzene, toluene, p-xylene, m-xylene and mesitylene were achieved. The models with lowest root mean square error (RMSE) have shown that Unity is a consistent term. The other term was either IASISTMS or &# 960; *. Iterative TFT predicted new &# 960; * values for ethylbenzene, n-butylbenzene, sec-butylbenzene, tert-butylbenzene and isopropylbenzene respectively. Conclusion: FA has revealed that two real factors are responsible for the variation of formyl CS in benzene, toluene, p-xylene, m-xylene and mesitylene solvents. TFT has shown to be a powerful technique in predicting new values of the &# 960; * solvent scale. Model designing for the formyl proton CS have revealed that the IASISTMS, &# 960; * and Unity are the best empirical solvent scales and were better than any physical solvent scales in reproducing the formyl CS. The IASISTMS reflects the dipolarity-polarizabilty of the <b>aromatic</b> <b>solvent.</b> The cofactor of the solvent scale was found to correlate with the &# 963; p + substituent parameter...|$|R

Steady state fluorescence emission and lifetime measurements show that both C 60 and C 70 form excited state complexes (exciplexes) with the amines in non-aromatic solvents such as methylcyclohexane, but not in benzene.

40|$|Using {{the power}} of present-day {{supercomputers}} {{makes it possible to}} solve Newton’s equations of motion numerically, even for large systems. Molecular Dynamics provides a powerful simulation method to get insight in the behaviour of molecules under many conditions when considering atoms as charged solid spheres and hiding the quantum mechanics in effective potentials. We use this method to characterise the physical properties of different systems, e. g. polymers, water, organic and inorganic molecules. As an example of our work, we present a model of the pi-pi stacking dynamics of a perylene bisimide molecule when solvated in <b>aromatic</b> <b>solvents.</b> Our calculations show that the transition from the open (unstacked) to the stacked configuration is hindered by a small free energy barrier of approx. 1 kBT in the <b>aromatic</b> <b>solvent</b> toluene. The origin of this barrier is traced back to pi-pi interactions between perylene and the <b>aromatic</b> <b>solvent</b> which are very similar in nature to those between two PBI monomers. The stacking process proceeds in three phases via two well-defined transition states: (i) in the first phase, the two PBI molecules share part of their respective solvation shells forming the first transition state. Further approach needs to squeeze out the shared solvent layer thus creating the energy barrier. (ii) After removal of the separating solvent the two PBIs form a second transition state with one monomer located at a random position in the other’s solvation shell.
