40|$|Tritium is a {{by-product}} of civil nuclear reactors, military nuclear applications, fusion programmes and radiopharmaceutical production. It commonly occurs, though not exclusively, as tritiated water (HTO) or organically-bound tritium (OBT) in the environment but may exist as other forms in nuclear-related construction and fabrication materials. During the lifetime of nuclear sites (especially those involving heavy water) tritium becomes variably incorporated {{into the fabric of}} the buildings. When nuclear decommissioning works and environmental assessments are undertaken it is necessary to accurately evaluate tritium activities {{in a wide range of}} materials prior to any waste sentencing. Of the various materials comprising UK radioactive wastes, concrete and <b>metal</b> <b>account</b> for approximately 20 % of the total weight of low level waste (LLW) and 12 % and 35 % of the total weight of intermediate level waste (ILW). Proper sampling and storage of samples are significant factors in achieving accurate tritium activities. The degree of loss of 3 H and cross-contamination can be significantly reduced by storing samples in an air/water tight container in a freezer (- 18 °C). The potential for tritium contamination is dependent on the 3 H form. Most 3 H loss originates from tritiated water which is easily exchanged with atmospheric hydrogen in the form of water vapour at room temperature. However, the loss of more strongly bound 3 H, produced in-situ in materials by neutron activation, is not significant even at room temperature. Such tritium is tightly retained in materials and does not readily exchange with water or diffuse. In nuclear reactor environments tritium may be produced via several neutron-induced reactions, 2 H(n,g) 3 H, 6 Li(n,a) 3 H, 10 B(n, 2 a) 3 H and ternary fission (fission yield 850 °C to achieve quantitative recovery. This more strongly retained tritium originates from neutron capture of trace lithium (6 Li and potentially 10 B) distributed throughout minerals in the concrete. The highest proportion of strongly bound 3 H was observed in the core sections closest to the core. Weakly bound tritium is associated with water loss from hydrated mineral components. Tritium is retained in metals by absorption by free water, hydrated surface oxidation layer, H ingress into bulk metal and also as lattice-bound tritium produced via in-situ neutron activation. Away from the possible influence of neutrons, the main 3 H contamination to metals arises from absorption and diffusion via atmospheric exposure to the HTO. Here contamination is mainly confined to the metal surface layer. The tritium penetration rate into metal surfaces is controlled by the metal type and its surface condition. Where metals are exposed to a significant neutron flux and contain 6 Li, 7 Li and 10 B then in situ 3 H production will occur which may propagate beyond the surface layer. In such cases tritium may exist in two forms namely a weakly bound HTO form and a non-HTO strongly bound form. The HTO form is readily lost at moderate temperatures (~ 120 °C) whereas the non-HTO requires up to 850 °C for complete extraction...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} {{development}} of a heuristic based methodology for designing measurement networks with application to the precise <b>accounting</b> of <b>metal</b> flows in mineral beneficiation operations. The term 'measurement network' is used to refer to the 'system of sampling and weight measurement equipment' from which process measurements are routinely collected. <b>Metal</b> <b>accounting</b> is defined as the estimation of saleable metal in the mine and subsequent process streams over a defined time period. One of the greatest challenges facing <b>metal</b> <b>accounting</b> is 'uncertainty' that is caused by random errors, and sometimes gross errors, that obtain in process measurements. While gross errors can be eliminated through correct measurement practices, random errors are an inherent property of measured data and they can only be minimised. Two types of rules for designing measurement networks were considered. The first type of rules referred to as 'expert heuristics' consists of (i) Code of Practice Guidelines from the AMIRA P 754 Code, and (ii) prevailing accounting practices from the mineral and metallurgical processing industry which were obtained through a questionnaire survey campaign. It was hypothesised that experts in the industry design measurement networks using rules or guidelines that ensure requisite quality in <b>metal</b> <b>accounting.</b> The second set of rules was derived from the symbolic manipulation of the general steady-state linear data reconciliation solution as well as from an intensive numerical study on the variance reduction response of measurements after data reconciliation conducted in this study. These were referred to as 'mathematical heuristics' and are based on the general principle of variance reduction through data reconciliation. It was hypothesised that data reconciliation can be used to target variance reduction for selected measurements by exploiting characteristics of entire measurement networks as well as individual measurement characteristics...|$|R

The absence of calcium oxide in the slag, and the deliberate use of wood with high phosphorus content during the smelting, induces a higher phosphorus content (less than 0.1%, average 0.25%) than in modern iron.

In addition, two methods for assessing metal bioavailability (normalizing metal concentrations on organic carbon and on the smallest sediment fraction) were compared. Factor analyses showed that normalizing trace metals resulted in an improved separation of trace metals from ecological factors (depth, organic carbon, granulometry, and chloride). The variation in the macroinvertebrate data was partitioned into four sources using partial canonical correspondence analysis, with the partitions being purely ecological factors, purely trace metals, mutual ecological factors and trace metals, and unexplained. Partial canonical correspondence analysis applied to total and normalized trace metal concentrations gave similar results in terms of unexplained variances.

40|$|Abstract The violent {{event of}} a {{short-circuit}} leads to short-term exposure of circuit breaker components to extremely high current, causing thermal degradation, vaporization and deformation of some components and the deposition of surface contaminants. After short-circuit, the leakage current carried by the breaker, when voltage is applied, increases dramatically but must remain below a certain threshold to meet acceptance criteria. The goal {{of this study is}} to identify the primary leakage current pathways through the breaker following short-circuit and to elucidate the role of a protective coating, loaded with naturally-occurring clay nanoparticles, on improving the electrical performance of the breaker. A Megger insulation tester was used to test both virgin and short-circuited polycarbonate (PC) samples taken from the base of the circuit breaker. Further, direct-current and alternating-current conductivity were measured on PC samples by using a Keithley high-resistance meter and broadband dielectric spectroscopy, respectively. These tests established that the leakage current pathway is primarily through the surface contaminants deposited on the PC during the short-circuit event. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) were employed to identify the composition and distribution of the surface contaminants. These were found to contain significant amounts of <b>metal,</b> <b>accounting</b> for the observed increase in leakage current through the breaker following short-circuit.
