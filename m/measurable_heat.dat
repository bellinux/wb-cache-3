These heat signatures provide valuable information {{to understand the}} behavior of electron clouds under certain circumstances. The heat loads from the Inner Triplets and the Stand Alone Magnets (SAMs) are used for this investigation. The data of the inner triplets confirmed with previous studies {{about the fact that}} two 50 ns beams are required for a significant electron cloud. The data has also revealed that the difference between the heat load of the inner triplets decreases with time. Also, the heat load increase at injection divides itself from heat load of the two beams. Furthermore, the heat/proton ratio does not seem to change in 2011 and 2012 (they are equivalent under similar beam conditions), suggesting that the SEY value may not have changed.

Life is limited within a range of temperature at the limits of which survival depends upon certain physiological adaptations in poikilothermic animals, such as selection of preferred temperature, variation in water distribution, regulation of water loss, and other metabolic reactions including suspension of active life processes at unfavourable temperatures (Prosser, 1952).

40|$|Heat {{and mass}} {{transfers}} are coupled processes, also in nucleation. In principle, a nucleating cluster {{would have a}} different temperature compared to the surrounding supersaturated old phase because of the heat release involved with attaching molecules to the cluster. In turn a difference in temperature across the cluster surface is a driving force for the mass transfer {{to and from the}} cluster. This coupling of forces in nonisothermal nucleation is described using mesoscopic nonequilibrium thermodynamics, emphasizing <b>measurable</b> <b>heat</b> effects. An expression was obtained for the nonisothermal nucleation rate in a one-component system, in the case where a temperature difference exists between a cluster distribution and the condensed phase. The temperature is chosen {{as a function of the}} cluster size only, while the temperature of the condensed phase is held constant by a bath. The generally accepted expression for isothermal stationary nucleation is contained as a limiting case of the nonisothermal stationary nucleation rate. The equations for heat and mass transport were solved for stationary nucleation with the given cluster distribution and with the temperature controlled at the boundaries. A factor was defined for these conditions, determined by the heat conductivity of the surrounding phase and the phase transition enthalpy, to predict the deviation between isothermal and nonisothermal nucleation. For the stationary state described, the factor appears to give small deviations, even for primary nucleation of droplets in vapor, making the nonisothermal rate smaller than the isothermal one. The set of equations may lead to larger and different thermal effects under different boundary conditions, however. Process and EnergyMechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineerin...|$|E

Information such as Debye temperature, heat capacity, superconductivity properties, physical and chemical characteristics, commercial availability, and recipes for synthesis was accumulated and evaluated to develop a list of neutron-sensitive materials likely to perform properly in the spectrometer. The best candidate borides appear to be MgB{sub 2 } (a superconductor with T{sub c} = 39 K), B{sub 6 }Si, B{sub 4 }C, and elemental boron; all are commercially available. Among the lithium compounds are LiH, LiAl, Li{sub 12 }Si{sub 7 }, and Li{sub 7 }Sn{sub 2 }. These materials have or {{are expected to have}} high Debye temperatures and sufficiently low heat capacities at 100 mK to produce a useful signal. The responses of {sup 10 }B and {sup 6 }Li to a fission neutron spectrum were also estimated.

A {{description of the}} surface was given using non-equilibrium thermodynamics, and transport coefficients were determined. Three independent coefficients were found for the whole surface: the resistance to heat transfer, the coupling coefficient and the resistance to mass transfer. These coefficients were defined in stationary state. All resistances are significant, and show that the surface acts {{as a barrier to}} transport. A new scheme was devised to find the enthalpy of adsorption, from two particular coupling coefficients, namely the <b>measurable</b> <b>heats</b> of transfer. The method yields the enthalpy of adsorption {{as a function of the}} excess surface concentration and surface temperature, but in this case it is nearly constant, 55 kJ/ mol. An expression of the surface permeability is given and our results are in agreement with experimental observations. A further inspection of the surface regarded as a series of two resistances, showed that the gas side of the surface dominates completely the resistance to heat transfer, while the silicalite side determines the resistance to mass transfer and the value of the coupling coefficient. The coefficients were not sensitive to the surface structure, whether it was flat, or zig-zag textured. Interestingly, the surface excess concentration was negative for low pressures, underlining the importance of the surface as a barrier to transport. The findings may help reduce adsorption data from experiments on zeolites and other porous materials...|$|R

Precise recording of human eye movements. Vision Res 1975; 15 (3) : 447 - 50], which suffer from the instability of pupil size, blinking behavior and lower temporal resolution. However, no conventional {{functional magnetic resonance imaging}} (fMRI) -compatible search-coil eye tracker exists. The main problems for such a technique are the interaction between the transmitter coils and the magnetic gradients used for imaging as well as the limited amount of space in a scanner. Here we present an approach to overcome these problems and we demonstrate a method to record EMs in an MRI scanner using a search coil. The system described has a spatial resolution of 0. 07 ° (visual angle) and a high temporal resolution (22 kHz). The transmitter coils are integrated into the visual presentation system and the control/analysis unit is portable, which enables us to integrate the eye tracker with an MRI scanner. Our tests demonstrate low noise in the recorded eye traces and scanning with minimal artifact. Furthermore, the induced current in the search coil caused by the RF pulses does not lead to <b>measurable</b> <b>heating.</b> Altogether, this MR-compatible search-coil eye tracker can be used to precisely monitor EMs with high spatial and temporal resolution during fMRI.

40|$|In recent years, {{applications}} of distributed temperature sensing (DTS) {{have increased in}} number and diversity. Because fiber-optic cables used for DTS are typically sheathed in dark UV-resistant materials, the question arises as to how shortwave solar radiation penetrating a water column influences the accuracy of absolute DTS-derived temperatures in aquatic applications. To quantify these effects, we completed a modeling effort that accounts {{for the effects of}} radiation and convection on a submersed cable to predict when solar heating may be important. Results indicate that for cables installed at shallow depths in clear, low-velocity water bodies, <b>measurable</b> <b>heating</b> of the cable is likely during peak solar radiation. However, at higher velocities, increased turbidity and/or greater depths, the effects of solar heating are immeasurable. A field study illustrated the effects of solar radiation by installing two types of fiber-optic cable at multiple water depths (from 0. 05 to 0. 8 m) in the center and along the sidewall of a trapezoidal canal. Thermistors were installed at similar depths and shielded from solar radiation to record absolute water temperatures. During peak radiation, thermistor data showed small temperature differences (∼ 0. 003 °C– 0. 04 °C) between depths suggesting minor thermal stratification in the canal center. DTS data from cables at these same depths show differences of 0. 01 °C– 0. 17 °C. The DTS differences cannot be explained by stratification alone and are likely evidence of additional heating from solar radiation. Sidewall thermistor strings also recorded stratification. However, corresponding DTS data suggested that bed conduction overwhelmed the effects of solar radiation...|$|R

Understanding the different phenomena and variations in temperature,heat and other quantities is critical. Non-equilibrium thermodynamics is usedto establish a 1 -dimensional model for transport processes in a Nafion membranesystem consisting of heat and mass transport, and for a PEM fuel cell with heat andtransport of mass and charge. The Nafion membrane in part 2 is coated with a Sigracet layer of either GDL 10 AAwithout Teflon or with GDL 10 BA with 5 % Teflon. Outside of these layers is liquidwater. The absorption enthalpy between liquid water and the Sigracet layer hasbeen found by combining experimental data with the established simulation model. For GDL 10 AA without Teflon this absorption enthalpy ranges from - 460 J/mol to- 3380 J/mol for mean temperatures of 30 oC and 75 oC respectively. For GDL 10 BAwith Teflon this absorption enthalpy ranges from 1150 J/mol to 7850 J/mol for meantemperatures of 30 oC and 75 oC respectively. The heat capacity value of water for Sigracet GDL 10 AA and GDL 10 BA was found to be 10 J/K mol and 223 J/Kmol respectively. The effect on the absorption enthalpy and the sign and value ofthe water flux by changing the temperature and material properties is studied. Thisstudy has found that the heat conductivities play a minor role when it comes totransport of water compared to the diffusion constant of the Nafion membrane andthe Sigracet layers. A simulation model is established for the PEM Fuel Cell in part 3. Only variationsin quantities along one dimension is considered. Non-equilibrium thermodynamics isused to properly describe heat and transport of mass and charge. The system has aNafion membrane coated with a Sigracet layer of GDL 10 AA without Teflon at bothends.

40|$|In {{this thesis}} we used non-equilibrium {{molecular}} dynamics (NEMD) to study non-equilibrium behaviors of two irreversible systems, both exposed to large temperature gradients. As modeling systems, {{we have chosen}} a simple chemical reaction, 2 F↔F 2, and a liquid-vapor interface of a Lenard-Jones spline fluid. The primary goal of this thesis is to investigate the nature of coupled transfer of heat and mass, and to obtain insight into the underlying molecular mechanisms, dynamic structure and properties of the non-equilibrium systems. Heat and mass transports are central in mechanical {{as well as in}} chemical engineering. In order to predict transport properties of such systems, we need to confirm that there is a sound basis for the relevant transport equations. For the purpose, NEMD simulations have been used to study both equilibrium and dynamical behavior of the systems. To model the chemical reaction, Stillinger and Weber’s two- and three-body potentials were used. In addition to the two-body potential, the three-body potential is needed in order to sufficiently represent the main features of the reaction. Suitable NEMD techniques with the efficient reaction model were developed to study the fluorine reaction, in both stationary equilibrium and non-equilibrium states. Large temperature gradients were imposed through the boundaries in the NEMD box. With the NEMD simulations, the usefulness and validity of the theory of non-equilibrium thermodynamics (NET) have been investigated. The validity of the assumption of ’local equilibrium’ was tested for the chemical reaction in various temperature gradients. Furthermore, the quantitative definitions for the local ’chemical’ equilibrium were presented using the results from NEMD. The dynamic properties of the system are governed by the system’s entropy production. We gave the expression for the entropy production from NET to define the fluxes and forces in the system. Proper transport equations were presented for determination of the transport coefficients of the reacting system. Origins of transport properties, i. e. thermal diffusion coefficients (or Soret coefficient), heats of transfer, and Onsager coefficients, were discussed in a microscopic level. A dissipative or dynamic structure of the chemical reaction was displayed. In addition we studied a phase transition, i. e. coupled heat and mass transfer across a liquid-vapor interface of a one-component system. The NEMD simulations with a Lenard-Johns spline potential were performed in different thermodynamic environments, e. g. with temperature gradients or/and concentration gradients. In the first place of this work, we proofed the validity of the assumption of local equilibrium at the surface where heat and mass transfer simultaneously. We then developed new algorithms to independently determine all four interfacial transfer coefficients for the surface. In the framework of NET, two sets of force- flux equations were defined by using the <b>measurable</b> <b>heat</b> flux on the vapor side {{as well as on the}} liquid side. The aim of this work is to find the interfacial coupling (Onsager) coefficients along the liquid-vapor coexistence curve and to add a proof of the Onsager’s reciprocal relations (ORR).

40|$|Developing and {{improving}} online monitoring techniques for processes {{is always a}} matter of interest for industrial and research applications. Independent of kind {{and complexity of the}} reaction, measuring the heat generation (calorimetry) is a universal tool for process monitoring. Therefore, two new calorimetric measurement techniques (chip calorimeter and reactor calorimeter) for process monitoring in stirred tank reactors were developed, validated and applied to several biological systems. The validation was done by exhaust gas analysis and the application of the oxycaloric equivalent. By assuming the rule of Thornton, the enthalpy of combustion of organic compounds is linearly correlated to the relative degree of reduction (Thornton's rule: - 115 kJ per mole accepted electrons). Since four moles of electrons are absorbed by one mole oxygen, a constant value for the oxygen related enthalpy of about - 460 kJ mol- 1 results. This is denoted as the oxycaloric equivalent. Consequently, if the enthalpy of the anabolic processes is neglected, the metabolic heat generation can be calculated based on the oxygen transfer rate. As a model organism for validating the calorimetric measurements, the genetic modified Escherichia coli strain VH 33 was chosen. The genetic sequence of the phosphotransferase system (PTS) in the bacterial chromosome of this strain was deleted. The galactose permease (GalP), as an alternative uptake mechanism, was amplified on a genetic level to allow the passage of glucose across the plasma membrane. Therefore, this strain had a strictly reduced overflow metabolism and was the optimal organism for validating the calorimetric measurements of fermentations by exhaust gas analysis and the oxycaloric equivalent. One possibility for calorimetric monitoring of fermentations in stirred tank reactors is the chip calorimeter, developed by the TU Bergakademie Freiberg, which can be connected to every reactor system as long as a septum is available. The measurements of the device were validated by exhaust gas analysis (oxycaloric equivalent) of E. coli VH 33 cultures. The measured results of the chip calorimeter were very precise (0. 001 W L- 1). However, the upper limit of the device was a heat generation of 1 W L- 1 due to oxygen depletions in the measurement chamber at higher biomass concentrations. Therefore, the chip calorimeter was enhanced by an automatic sample dilution system, which mixed the sample with oxygen containing NaCl solution before measuring in the chamber. With this modification, the upper limit of the <b>measurable</b> <b>heat</b> generation was increased up to 4 W L- 1. An alternative for measuring the heat generation of fermentations is to modify or design a whole stirred tank reactor as a calorimeter – the so called reactor calorimeter. This measurement principle based on the thermodynamic balancing of the cooling / heating water cycle of the reactor system. Consequently, all heat sources and sinks of the system should be known. In general, there are two ways for designing reactor calorimeters: 1) measuring the mass flow of the cooling liquid and the temperature difference between cooling cycle inlet and outlet; 2) determination of the heat transfer coefficient and the temperature difference between reactor inside and cooling cycle. Both methods were realized by modifying a 50 L stirred tank reactor and were validated and compared with each other by cultivating E. coli VH 33. Ultimately, it could be shown that the second way, based on the determination of the heat transfer coefficient has a higher signal quality and should be chosen for all following applications. Finally, the modified reactor was used to investigate the potential of the calorimetric signal for online detection of product formation during fermentations. It could be demonstrated by determining the ratio between heat generation and oxygen consumption, that lysine formation of Corynebacterium glutamicum DM 1730 and itaconic acid formation of Ustilago maydis can be online detected during fermentations in stirred tank reactors...|$|E

40|$|One-quarter of the {{worldwide}} greenhouse gas emissions is emitted by fossil fuel based power plants. In order to limit future climate changes caused by these emissions, several types of CO 2 -capturing power plants are currently being developed. An integrated gasification combined cycle (IGCC) {{is one of the}} most promising alternatives. It is the mission of a European collaboration project called DECARBit to enable the commercial use of this type of power plant. One of themain process units of an IGCC is the air separation unit (ASU). It provides both oxygen and nitrogen to the gasifier, and nitrogen to the gas turbine. The main objective of this thesis is to improve the Second law efficiency of a cryogenic ASU, with a focus on the use of novel distillation concepts. Improving the Second law efficiency of a process is equivalent to improving its exergy efficiency. In this thesis, the exergy efficiency is defined as the desired change in exergy contents of the ASU products divided by the net amount of added work. Using exergy analysis, it is shown that the exergy efficiency of a state-of-the-art two-column ASU with a pumped liquid cycle is approximately 35 %. Most of the exergy destruction is located in the compressor after-coolers, the distillation section, and the main heat exchanger. The irreversibilities in the compressor after-coolers are caused by the use of cooling water. They can almost completely be eliminated by transferring the heat of compression to the ASU products instead of to the cooling water. The achieved reduction in exergy destruction corresponds to almost 1 % of the net electric efficiency of the IGCC and it increases the exergy efficiency of the ASU to approximately 70 %. Two alternatives are presented that can improve the distillation section efficiency. The first one is the addition of a third distillation column; it can reduce the exergy destruction in the distillation section by approximately 30 %. The second option is to improve the heat integration of the two distillation columns, by using heat-integrated distillation stages (HI stages). These HI stages are the basis of a relatively novel distillation column configuration called a heat-integrated distillation column (HIDiC). In an ASU, the use of HI stages enables a lower operating pressure in the high-pressure column, which reduces the required work input to ASU. Depending on the amount of heat-transfer capacity per HI stage, the exergy destruction in the distillation section can be reduced by 20 to 30 % due to the use of HI stages. HI stages and HIDiCs are not yet in industrial use. So far, only two complete HIDiCs have been built, both using concentrically-integrated columns equipped with structured packing. They have proven the feasibility of the HIDiC concept, but detailed knowledge on the performance of the columns is still very scarce. As a result, simulations of packed concentric HIDiCs still involve several uncertainties. They are related to the achievable overall heat-transfer coefficient, to the performance of a ring-shaped distillation column, and to the effects that a radial heat flux has on the column performance. In order to obtain more insight into these phenomena, two research directions have been pursued: a theoretical one and an experimental one. The theoretical work concerns the further development of a model for the simultaneous transfer of mass and thermal energy, based on the theory of irreversible thermodynamics. The model describes the vapour–liquid interface region of a mixture as a series of connected control volumes that together represent a vapour film, the interface, and a liquid film. This interface region is located in between the bulk vapour and bulk liquid phases; the conditions at its boundaries are equal to the adjacent bulk phase conditions. A routine has been developed that calculates the thermal and molar fluxes through the interface region, based on input values for the boundary conditions, or driving forces. The film thicknesses ratio is found by requiring consistency between the entropy productions calculated using the entropy balance and using the product-sum of conjugate fluxes and driving forces. By applying this model to a nitrogen–oxygen mixture, it has been shown that the direct coupling between heat and diffusion fluxes has a considerable influence on the calculated values of the fluxes. The <b>measurable</b> <b>heat</b> flux is most sensitive to the coupling effect, which makes a correct description of the effect especially important when simulating a HIDiC. Another important model parameter is the number of control volumes that is used to represent the films. The effect of the interface resistances on the calculation results was relatively small. The experimental work concerns the development of a new experimental HIDiC. The designed set-up consists of a cylindrical inner column with a diameter of 14 cm that is surrounded by a ring-shaped outer column with a diameter of 22 cm. A difference in operating pressures causes thermal energy to be transferred from the high-pressure inner column to the low-pressure outer column. Both columns will be equipped with 1. 6 m of structured packing and will operate at total reflux conditions. The set-up is designed to operate at cryogenic temperatures, elevated pressures, and high oxygen concentrations. At the top of the set-up, two copper-brazed plate heat exchangers will be used as condensers, using evaporating nitrogen as coolant. Electrical heaters with a maximum duty of 25 kW will be used as reboilers. Radial and angular temperature and composition gradients inside the columns will be measured directly at several height levels, in both the vapour and liquid phases. These measurements can also be used to determine the separation efficiency of the columns. The total amount of thermal energy transfer will be obtained based on two independent measurements of the condenser and reboiler duties of both columns. The set-up can also be used to assess the coupling between thermal and molar fluxes. PhD i kjemiPhD in Chemistr...|$|E

The number of adsorbed CTAB molecules at saturation corresponds approximately to the number of negative elementary charges bound at the surface of the latices. The mixing enthalpy is the sum of demicellization and sorption enthalpies. At 25 degreesC for CTAB the demicellization enthalpy amounts to 10 kJ/mol, whereas the adsorption enthalpy varies from - 7 kJ/mol (surface charge density of the latices sigma=- 0. 37 C/m(2)) to + 3 kJ/mol (sigma=- 0. 085 C/m(2)).

40|$|A {{detailed}} {{study has been}} performed for mixtures of octyloxycyanobiphenyl (8 OCB) and nonyloxycyanobiphenyl (9 OCB) liquid crystals and nine of their mixtures by means of high-resolution adiabatic scanning calorimetry. The isotropic to nematic transitions are weakly first order with latent heat values in the range usually encountered for this transition in other liquid crystals. With the exception of pure 8 OCB, for which only an upper limit of 1. 8 J kg(- 1) for the latent heat could be established, finite latent heats have been obtained for the nematic to smectic-A transition of all the mixtures and of pure 9 OCB. The concentration dependence of their latent heats could be well fitted with a crossover function consistent with a mean-field free-energy expression that has a nonzero cubic term induced by the Halperin-Lubensky-Ma (HLM) coupling between the smectic-A order parameter and the orientational director fluctuations. Clearly first-order transitions with <b>measurable</b> latent <b>heats</b> are found for mole fractions of 9 OCB in the mixtures where the effective critical exponent for the specific-heat capacity has substantially lower values than the tricritical one (0. 5). This is qualitatively different from what has been observed so far in other liquid-crystal systems and yields strong experimental evidence from a calorimetric experiment for the HLM coupling between the smectic-A order parameter and the director orientation fluctuations. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|We {{examined}} {{the possibility that}} whole cell currents are involved and possibly trigger the response of mammalian cells to heat shock. Heat-sensitive cells from a radiation-induced fibrosarcoma (RIF- 1) and heat-resistant variants (TR- 4, TR- 5) were heated at 45 degrees C for 3 - 30 min. We observed induction of voltage-dependent currents after heating in the heat-resistant cells. These currents decayed to nonmeasurable levels {{over a period of}} 6 h. In RIF- 1 cells, however, voltage-dependent currents were detectable during heating only; these currents then decayed rapidly. Tetraethylammonium (TEA) cations blocked the currents; changing the concentration of extracellular K+ modified the current-voltage (I-V) relationship. These currents, therefore, resulted from the activation of voltage-dependent K+ channels. Addition of TEA during heating sensitized TR- 4 cells to heat but had no effect on the heat response of the RIF- 1 cells. Continuous exposure of the RIF- 1 cells to 2 % (vol/vol) dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) for 7 days induced the expression of additional functional, voltage-dependent K+ channels; these gave rise to currents that were <b>measurable</b> after <b>heating.</b> In parallel, these cells became heat resistant. Addition of TEA to DMSO-treated cells blocked channels and returned the heat response almost to the pre-DMSO levels. Our data show a correlation between heat resistance and expression of K+ channels. Because resistance to heat very likely relates to the heat shock response, our data suggest that activation of channels may be a very early event in initiation of the heat shock response...|$|R

40|$|A {{comprehensive}} 2 -year dataset collected {{with the}} Poker Flat Incoherent Scatter Radar (PFISR) located near Fairbanks, Alaska (MLAT = 65. 4 ° N) is employed {{to identify and}} analyse 22 events of anomalous electron heating (AEH) in the auroral E region. The overall AEH occurrence probability is conservatively estimated to be 0. 3 % from nearly-continuous observations of the E region by PFISR, although it increases to 0. 7 – 0. 9 % in the dawn and dusk sectors where all AEH events were observed. The AEH occurrence variation with MLT is broadly {{consistent with those of}} events with high convection velocity (> 1000 m s − 1) or electron temperature (> 800 K), except for much smaller AEH probability and absence of AEH events near magnetic midnight. This suggests that high convection electric field by itself is necessary but not sufficient for <b>measurable</b> electron <b>heating</b> by two-stream plasma waves. The multi-point observations are utilised to investigate the fundamental dependence of the electron temperature on the convection electric field, focusing on the previously-proposed saturation effects at extreme electric fields. The AEH dataset was found to exhibit considerable scatter and, on average, similar rate of the electron temperature increase with the electric field up to 100 mV m − 1 as compared with previous studies. At higher (highest) electric fields, the electron temperatures are below the linear trend on average (within uncertainty). By employing a simple fluid model of AEH, it is demonstrated that some of this deviation from the linear trend may be due to a stronger vibrational cooling at very large temperatures and electric fields...|$|R
40|$|An {{investigation}} into the smectic-A to chiral nematic (N(') A) transition in liquid crystals is presented by using adiabatic scanning calorimetry (ASC). It is predicted theoretically that chirality drives this transition to first order. This transition is studied in mixtures of the nonchiral liquid crystal octyloxycyanobiphenyl (8 OCB) and the chiral 4 -(2 -methylbutyl) - 4 '-cyanobiphenyl (CB 15), a system with a large (chiral) nematic region that widens upon increasing the chiral (CB 15) fraction. An ASC measurement on pure 8 OCB showed no evidence for a latent heat, in agreement with previous ac calorimetric studies, with an upper boundary for the latent heat (if any) of 1. 8 J/kg. Since pure 8 OCB has no <b>measurable</b> latent <b>heat,</b> and {{taking into account the}} widening of the chiral nematic region, the possibility of a continuous to first-order crossover due to the coupling of the nematic and the smectic order parameters, as occurring in several cases of smectic-A to nematic (NA) transitions, can be excluded. However, for all examined mixtures a latent heat could be determined at the smectic-A to chiral nematic transition. This confirms theoretical predictions of the first order character of this transition. Quantitatively, theoretical predictions of the evolution of the entropy discontinuities and latent heats of this transition were not consistent with the experimental results. It was further observed that the transition temperature decreases linearly in agreement with theoretical predictions and a previous ac calorimetric study. Finally, it was observed that the pretransitional specific heat capacity shows an interesting evolution upon increasing chiral fraction, and it may be concluded that any theoretical model based on Landau theory is not sufficient to describe this transition. status: publishe...|$|R

We present an experimental evaluation of a commercially available RF shield in the MRI environment. All tests were performed on 1. 5 T and 3. 0 T clinical MRI scanners. The tests were repeated with and without the RF shield present in the bore, for comparison. Effects of the shield, placed within the scanner bore, on the RF fields generated by the scanner were measured directly using tuned pick-up coils. Attenuation, by as much as 35 dB, of RF field power was found inside the RF shield. These results were supported by temperature measurements of metallic leads placed inside the shield, in which no <b>measurable</b> RF <b>heating</b> was found. In addition, there was a small, simultaneous detectable increase (~ 1 dB) of RF power just outside the edges of the shield. For these particular scanners, the autocalibrated RF power levels were reduced for scan locations prescribed just outside the edges of the shield, which corresponded with estimations based on the pick-up coil measurements. Additionally, no significant heating during MRI scanning was observed on the shield surface. The impact of the RF shield on the RF fields inside the magnet bore is likely to be dependent on the particular model of the RF shield or the MRI scanner. These results suggest that the RF shield could be a valuable tool for clinical MRI practices. Keywords: radiofrequency shield, magnetic resonance imaging, radiofrequency attenuatio...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Fire {{behavior}} characteristics (such as temperature, radiant {{and total}} heat flux, 2 - and 3 -dimensional velocities, and air flow) are {{extremely difficult to}} measure insitu. Although insitu sensor packages are capable of such measurements in realtime, it is also essential to acquire video documentation {{as a means of}} better understanding the fire behavior data recorded by individual fire behavior sensor packages. Therefore, coupling each sensor pack with a digital video recorder for simultaneous recording of video and insitu measurements allows viewing of the fire behavior as flames approach, envelope, and disperse past individual sensor packs. The limiting factor in this process is the amount of recordable digital video tape, typically 60 to 90 minutes of record time. This raises both tactical and safety-related concerns, requiring researchers to remain in proximity to the advancing fire in order to activate the fire behavior sensor and video packages. A new remote trigger that eliminates the need for human interaction in order to activate data collection hardware and video equipment has been designed and tested. This trigger system allows the fire behavior and video packages to stay in “sleep ” mode until a <b>measurable</b> rise in <b>heat</b> flux is detected. The detection activate...|$|R

40|$|The work {{deals with}} an {{analysis}} of recently developed high strength austenitic stainless Cr-Mn-steel which uses (C+N) alloy concept. The Fe- 18 Cr- 19 -Mn-C-N steel powder was produced as a steel powder by the gas atomization technique. The advantages of an austenitic matrix are the very good persistence against erosive corrosion, good toughness, cold work hardening, high temperature and creep strength. However improved strength of the stainless austenitic steel is often compromised by worsening of its corrosion resistance. One way to increase the strength is by solid solution hardening with interstitial elements like carbon and/or nitrogen. The development of stainless steels has concentrated on nitrogen as alloying element as many positive effects have been observed. Nitrogen stabilizes the austenite, forms less precipitation and increases the persistence against corrosion. In the field of high strength stainless steels with high interstitial elements content it {{is the state of}} the art to combine carbon and nitrogen as alloying elements, which is called (C+N) alloying concept. Attempts to produce Fe- 18 Cr- 19 Mn-C-N steel parts out of the powder steel did not succeed until now. The high affinity of chromium and manganese to oxygen causes a layer of oxides on the powder surface that builds a diffusion barrier which slows down sintering. After sintering surface oxides remain in the product which also extremely decrease the performance of the steel. The aim of this work was to define the process that takes place during vacuum sintering of such materials. During the first step the powder in as received state was examined by surface sensitive analysis techniques. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and high resolution electron microscopy combined with EDX analysis were applied to characterize the composition of the powder surface and the morphology, distribution and composition of the contaminants. The results show an intense enrichment in manganese and oxygen on the as received surface indicating high surface coverage by manganese oxide. Thorough powder observation by high resolution SEM reveals a high surface coverage by fine particulate oxides with a size of about 50 nm that often form agglomerates with a size up to hundreds of nanometers. The next step was to trace changes in the powder surface composition by in situ heat treatment in a high vacuum furnace attached to XPS analysis chamber at temperatures between 500 °C and 1000 °C. Under the applied conditions iron reduction was already <b>measurable</b> after <b>heat</b> treatment at 500 °C, chromium reduction at around 600 °C and manganese reduction at around 700 °C.

40|$|The Global {{exposures}} to emerging wireless technologies from applications including mobile phones, cordless phones, DECT phones, WI-FI, WLAN, Wi MAX, wireless internet, baby monitors, and others may present serious public health consequences. Evidence supporting {{a public health}} risk is documented in the BioInitiative Report. New, biologically based public exposure standards for chronic exposure to low-intensity exposures are warranted. Existing safety standards are obsolete because they are based solely on thermal effects from acute exposures. The rapidly expanding development of new wireless technologies and the long latency {{for the development of}} such serious diseases as brain cancers means that failure to take immediate action to reduce risks may result in an epidemic of potentially fatal diseases in the future (Sage and David, 2009 a). There is widespread public concern about the potential adverse health effects of mobile phones, and especially their associated base-stations. Alongside this there are hundreds of, apparently conflicting, reports in the media about the health effects of mobile phones & base-stations. The scientific literature is large and confusing, also apparently showing very inconsistent effects across studies (Elaine, 2009). The advent of cellular telephones and other wireless technologies and their wide spread and ever increasing use (see table 1 growth of mobile phones in Sudan) has led to increasing public, governmental, and scientific attention to the {{issue of whether or not}} adverse effects result from exposure to radiofrequency electromagnetic fields. While there are many natural and man- made sources of radiofrequency fields (RFs) in the environment [Stuchly, 1977; Meltz, 1991], established scientific evidence in support of an adverse human health effect due to RF exposure is largely nonexistent. However, the very fact that there are opportunities for so many human exposures is reason enough to give the matter attention, both in the short term and to at least some extent, into the future. In addition, concern about possible adverse effects due to long duration, low level exposures continues unabated (Martin, 2003). The most serious health endpoints that have been reported to be associated with extremely low frequency (ELF) and/or RF include childhood and adult leukemia, childhood and adult brain tumors, and increased risk of the neurodegenerative diseases, Alzheimer and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis 3 (ALS). In addition, there are reports of increased risk of breast cancer in both men and women, genotoxic effects (DNA damage and micronucleation), pathological leakage of the blood–brain barrier, altered immune function including increased allergic and inflammatory responses, miscarriage and some cardiovascular effects. Insomnia (sleep disruption) is reported in studies of people living in very low-intensity RF environments with WI-FI and cell tower-level exposures (Sage and David, 2009 a). The type of EMF emitted by base stations is reported to affect regional cerebral blood flow [Huber et al., 2005], cognitive function [Eliyahu et al., 2006; Hutter et al., 2006], and the autonomic nervous system. In addition, some researchers have speculated about causal connections between EMF from base stations and cancer or neuropsychiatric problems [Moulder et al., 2005;Wilen et al., 2006; Abdel-Rassoul et al., 2007], while others have found no definite evidence of such connections [Regel et al., 2006; Furubayashi, et al., 2009). Exposure to high-frequency non-ionizing radiation can lead to significant absorption of energy and temperature increases, depending on the radiation intensity. There is increasing evidence that weak high frequency EMF, at intensities well below those necessary to cause any significant heating, can also induce biological effects (Mann and Roschke, 2004). In many countries, over half the population already uses mobile phones and the market is still growing rapidly. The industry predicts that there will be as many as 1. 6 billion mobile phone subscribers worldwide in the year 2005. Because of this, increasing numbers of mobile base stations have had to be installed. Base stations are low-powered radio antennae that communicate with users' handsets(WHO, 2009). Both ELF and RF radiation induce reactive oxygen species, free radicals that react with cellular molecules including DNA. Free-radical production and/or the failure to repair DNA damage created by such exposures can lead to mutations. Exposures have also been linked to decreased melatonin production, which is a plausible biological mechanism for decreased cancer surveillance in the body, and increased cancer risk. An increased risk of cancers and a decrease in survival has been reported in numerous studies of ELF and RF (Sage and David, 2009 a). Existing standard-setting bodies that regulate wireless technologies, assume that there are no bioeffects of concern at exposure levels that do not cause <b>measurable</b> <b>heating.</b> However, it has been established beyond any reasonable 4 doubt that bioeffects and some adverse health effects occur at far lower levels of RF and ELF exposure where no heating (or induced current) occurs; some effects are shown to occur a thousand times or more below the existing public safety limits. New, biologically based public exposure limits are urgently needed. New wireless technologies for cell and cordless phones, other wireless communication and data transmission systems affect living organisms in new ways that our antiquated safety limits have not foreseen, nor protected against (Sage and David, 2009 a). Base stations are radio transmitters and receivers that form an essential link in mobile phone communications,they have antennas mounted either on free standing masts or on existing structures and buildings. The area covered by a base station is called a "cell". Cells usually have a radius of several kilometres and overlap at the edges. More base stations are needed where mobile phone use is high(Breckl and Council, 2009). Base stations are continuously transmitting signals, whereas handset transmits RF energy only while a call is being made. Base stations transmit power levels from a few watts to 100 watts or more, depending on the size of the region or "cell" that they are designed to service. Base station antennae are typically about 20 - 30 cm in width and a meter in length, mounted on buildings or towers at a height of from 15 to 50 metres above ground. These antennae emit RF beams that are typically very narrow in the vertical direction but quite broad in the horizontal direction. Because of the narrow vertical spread of the beam, the RF field intensity at the ground directly below the antenna is low. The RF field intensity increases slightly as one moves away from the base station and then decreases at greater distances from the antenna. Typically within 2 - 5 metres of some antennae mounted on rooftops, fences keep people away from places where the RF fields exceed exposure limits. Since antennae direct their power outward, and do not radiate significant amounts of energy from their back surfaces or towards the top or bottom of the antenna, the levels of RF energy inside or to the sides of the building are normally very low (WHO, 2009). Most of the research carried out suggests that exposure to radio waves below levels set out in the guidelines does not cause health problems. however Some evidence does however suggest that changes in brain activity can occur below these levels. As a result, the Independent Expert Group on Mobile Phones 5 (Stewart Group) has recommended a "precautionary approach" be adopted until further research is completed (Breckl and Council, 2009) ...|$|R
