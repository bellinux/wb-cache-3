40|$|Introduction: Working in a noisy {{environment}} {{is a risk}} for employee hearing health. Standard threshold shift (STS) {{can be used as}} a screening method to detect early indications of hearing deterioration. Objective: To investigate health effects related to STS in <b>motor</b> <b>compressor</b> workers. Methods: A cross sectional study of 464 <b>motor</b> <b>compressor</b> workers was conducted including hearing health examination by audiometer, and noise level in the workplace was monitored. Workers who reported having hobbies relating to noise, e. g. gun shooting, or a personal history of disease relating to the ear were excluded. The relationship between health effects and workers with STS was studied. Results: There were more men 81. 90 % (aged range 31 - 40 years old) than women working for the company. The average continuous noise level in the workplace was 84. 14 ± 5. 21 dB(A). The study showed that working at the factory for more than 14 years (OR= 3. 84, 95 %CI 1. 54 - 9. 56) and being exposed to noise at least 8 hours a day (OR = 2. 12, 95 %CI = 1. 02 - 4. 40) effected to STS. Workers with STS showed significant communication difficulties (OR = 1. 89, 95 %CI = 1. 03 - 3. 49) and stress/nausea more than workers without STS (OR = 1. 54, 95 %CI = 0. 90 - 2. 65) although not statistically significant. Conclusions: Workers exposed to continuous noise in the <b>motor</b> <b>compressor</b> industry are at risk of STS. Duration of exposure to noise is a key factor in respect of harm to hearing health. STS could be used as a tool to screen workers who have hearing health problems. </p...|$|E

Hermetic <b>compressor</b> <b>motor</b> design also face the same challenge. However, reducing motor size for same compressor capacity will increase the motor power density, with the same motor cooling design as before, motor running temperature will be increased and this affect both motor life and reliability as well as passing UL certification requirement for compressors using OLP (internal overload protector). Hermetic motor cooling improvement using thermal modelling has been investigated before by using thermal network method, with limited accuracy since this do not taken all thermal correlation between <b>motor</b> and <b>compressors.</b> (refer to Purdue paper: thermal modelling ro the motor in semi-hermetic screw refrigeration compressor under part load conditions) However, the real situation in terms of thermal and fluid distribution which affect motor cooling inside the compressor in much more complicated than a pure thermal lumped circuit can represent.

40|$|Lecturepg. 27 - 40 The {{integrated}} electric motocompressor is {{a recently}} available technology {{that has the}} advantage of drastically simplifying the machine configuration. The use of a high speed electrical motor in the process gas combined with active magnetic bearings eliminates the dry gas seals and replaces the traditional oil bearings and lube oil circuit. In addition, main auxiliaries can be avoided since the motor cooling system uses the compressor process gas as the cooling medium,making the overall package very simple. As this specific arrangement of the machine cannot be tested and validated as a conventional compressor, a validation test must take care of both the compressor and the motor. On the mechanical standpoint, the use of active magnetic bearings (AMBs) has to be considered. It is well known that AMB characteristics differ from oil bearings in terms of damping and stiffness. This paper addresses specific limitation relative to AMBs and mainly nonlinear phenomena like magnetic material or power electronics saturation.

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to present a {{feasibility}} study on the use of low pressure in vehicle’s small applications. Hydro-pneumatic driveline is one of the hybrid sub-systems for hydraulic hybrid vehicle. Usually, the energy supplied by hydro-pneumatic accumulator/storage operates through maximum energy level to a minimum. This often reaches to the point where the limit of minimal operations is higher than the pre-charge limit. The remaining power is claimed as not effective to move a vehicle, but the pressure still contains energy. Therefore, it is a waste of energy. The pressure energy can be used to power vehicle’s small applications such as fan, starting <b>motor,</b> <b>compressor,</b> hybrid electric battery charger, and others. Hence, a laboratory-scale experiment was extended away to see the hydro-pneumatic drive system behavior to operate at low-pressure level. Through the experiment, it was found that the system can work at low-pressure level. However, the power generated was 740 watt, 16. 2 Nm theoretical torque and operated at 52 % efficiency at a pressure of 50 bar. This value is too small if compared to the force needed to move the vehicle. Still, it was dependable enough to power the small application in the vehicle sub-system. Through this research, it is hoped that the ineffective pressure of the hydraulic hybrid vehicle can be utilized so it can contribute to the increase of efficiency...|$|E
