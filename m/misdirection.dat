5|$|The {{complaint}} to Turkey had a desired effect locally, with an apology from the country's {{government and a}} commitment to breaking diplomatic ties to Germany if required. However, it failed to elicit a response from Germany. The Allies' request to the Spanish government was relayed to the Germans, but identified almost immediately as deception and <b>misdirection.</b>|$|E
5|$|Unlike card tricks done on {{the streets}} or on stage and card cheating, cardistry is solely about impressing without illusions, deceit, <b>misdirection</b> and other {{elements}} commonly used in card tricks and card cheating. Cardistry, or card flourishes, are always intended to be visually impressive and appear extremely difficult to perform. Card flourishing {{is often associated with}} card tricks, but many sleight of hand artists perform flourishing without considering themselves magicians or having any real interest in card tricks.|$|E
5|$|Although being mostly {{used for}} {{entertainment}} and comedy purposes, {{sleight of hand}} is also notoriously used to cheat at casinos and gambling facilities throughout the world. Common ways to professionally cheat at card games using sleight of hand include palming, switching, ditching, and stealing cards from the table. Such techniques involve extreme <b>misdirection</b> and years of practice. For these reasons, the term sleight of hand frequently carries negative associations of dishonesty and deceit at many gambling halls, and many magicians known {{around the world are}} publicly banned from casinos, such as British mentalist and close-up magician Derren Brown, who is banned from every casino in Britain.|$|E

5|$|Eventually, as the circumstantial coincidences build up, Knight becomes {{convinced}} that Gorman's story is true. The lack of tangible evidence, he claims, {{is due to}} a government cover-up and deliberate <b>misdirection</b> of the police investigation. To back up the claims of a masonic conspiracy, he notes supposed similarities between the Jack the Ripper killings and alleged masonic ritual murders, and accuses Sir Charles Warren, Commissioner of Police, of destroying evidence to protect his freemason cronies. Knight points out that Stowell, who was apparently the first person to suggest Albert Victor's and Gull's involvement in the murders, was a freemason.|$|E
5|$|Lactantius' De Mortibus Persecutorum, a {{political}} Christian pamphlet on the reigns of Diocletian and the Tetrarchy, provides valuable but tendentious detail on Constantine's predecessors and early life. The ecclesiastical histories of Socrates, Sozomen, and Theodoret describe the ecclesiastic disputes of Constantine's later reign. Written {{during the reign}} of Theodosius II (408–50AD), a century after Constantine's reign, these ecclesiastic historians obscure the events and theologies of the Constantinian period through <b>misdirection,</b> misrepresentation and deliberate obscurity. The contemporary writings of the orthodox Christian Athanasius and the ecclesiastical history of the Arian Philostorgius also survive, though their biases are no less firm.|$|E
5|$|Bioluminescence {{has several}} {{functions}} in different taxa. Haddock et al. (2010) list as {{more or less}} definite functions in marine organisms the following: defensive functions of startle, counterillumination (camouflage), <b>misdirection</b> (smoke screen), distractive body parts, burglar alarm (making predators easier for higher predators to see), and warning to deter settlers; offensive functions of lure, stun or confuse prey, illuminate prey, and mate attraction/recognition. It is much easier for researchers to detect that a species is able to produce light than to analyse the chemical mechanisms or to prove what function the light serves. In some cases the function is unknown, as with species in three families of earthworm (Oligochaeta), such as Diplocardia longa where the coelomic fluid produces light when the animal moves. The following functions are reasonably well established in the named organisms.|$|E

5|$|John Constantine, {{the main}} {{character}} of Hellblazer, was portrayed {{as a kind of}} confidence man and occult detective who did morally questionable things, arguably for the greater good. He usually triumphed through guile, deceit, and <b>misdirection,</b> but often made more enemies in the process than he defeated. Indeed, it was a common theme in the book that Constantine was unable to effect any lasting change or enjoy unequivocal victories. While sometimes striving for the good of mankind, Constantine was often manipulative and a dangerous person to have as a friend, as the lives and souls of those around him became perilously involved in his misadventures. He took pains to protect himself from direct attacks, but his friends and relatives were often endangered in order to strike at him. The spirits of deceased friends haunted him, individually or as an entourage of ghosts.|$|E
5|$|The columns {{that crossed}} the Andes {{began to take}} {{military}} actions. The column in the north led by Cabot defeated the royalists in Salala, seized Coquimbo and then Copiapó. In the south, Freire captured Talca. Las Heras routed royalist outposts in Juncalito and Potrerillos. Bernardo O'Higgins, who came from Los Patos pass, defeated the royalists at Las Coimas. This allowed the main columns to gather at Aconcagua valley, meeting at the slopes of Chacabuco. Royalist commander Rafael Maroto converged his armies on that location as well. Maroto had 2,450 men and 5 pieces of artillery, San Martín had 3,600 men and 9 pieces of artillery. The <b>misdirection</b> that concealed {{the path of the}} bulk of the Army allowed San Martín this advantage, as other royalist forces were scattered in other regions of Chile.|$|E
5|$|Florida State {{began the}} fourth quarter in {{possession}} of the ball and facing a third down, needing three yards for a first down. Weinke completed a pass for {{just short of the}} needed three yards. Instead of punting the ball away, Florida State head coach Bobby Bowden ordered the team to attempt to convert the first down. He brought backup quarterback Marcus Outzen into the game as a <b>misdirection</b> move, and instead of running a quarterback sneak as anticipated, Outzen tossed the ball to Minor, who ran for 16yards and a first down. During the play, Virginia Tech committed a 15-yard personal foul penalty that advanced the ball further and gave Florida State a first down at the Virginia Tech 23-yard line. Weinke returned to the game and threw a 10-yard pass to Chaney for another first down. Weinke threw an incomplete pass, then Tech stopped a rush up the middle for no gain. On third down, Weinke connected on a touchdown pass to Dugans, returning the lead to Florida State. The Seminoles, as had Virginia Tech before them, elected to attempt a two-point conversion. Unlike Virginia Tech's failed two-point conversions, the Seminoles successfully earned two points with a pass to Warrick, and the scores gave Florida State a 3629 lead with 12:59 remaining.|$|E

50|$|The {{court held}} that the court a quo had failed to apply the {{principle}} of election and the primary right to specific performance. It also had not appreciated the import of the remark in Brisley in favour of upholding contracts as opposed to striking them down.

5|$|Operation Royal Flush formed part of Operation Bodyguard, a broad {{strategic}} military deception {{intended to}} confuse the Axis high command as to Allied intentions during the lead-up to the Normandy landings. Royal Flush developed a series of political <b>misdirections</b> in mid-1944 to support other deceptions between June and July. It evolved from Operation Graffham, a political deception aimed at Sweden between February and March 1944.|$|R
5|$|As the game's {{emphasis}} is on stealth, players are encouraged to focus on concealment, evasion, distraction, <b>misdirection,</b> and subtle takedowns, rather than on outright confrontation; the player's character can engage in sword-based combat when the need arises, and can perform three different attacks as well as parrying, but has limited proficiency and damage resistance in such circumstances. To do so, players must remain aware of their surroundings. To assist them in remaining hidden, a special meter on the heads-up display (HUD), {{in the form of}} a gem, helps to indicates the player's visibility to NPCs; the brighter it is, the more easier they can be visually detected, thus sticking to dark, shady spots where the gem dims, ensures the player is hidden, though NPCs can still find them if they get to close in front of them. To remain quiet, players must be careful of how much noise they produce, as well as what surfaces they are moving over; walking on soft surfaces like carpets and grass, is preferable as footsteps remain quiet, compared to walking over metal floors and ceramic tiles, which produce a lot of noise. NPCs also produce noise, either from whistling, or walking about for example, which can help player's determine where how far away they are to their own position. Noise can be used by the player to mislead/distract NPCs, such as throwing an object to lure them elsewhere.|$|E

50|$|For the {{duration}} of season one, Hoffman defended Neil Avedon (Jason Gedrick), a young Hollywood star accused {{of the murder of}} fifteen-year-old Jessica Costello. During {{the first part of the}} season, Hoffman's associates also handled smaller cases which were usually wrapped up within one episode. While there were many plot twists and <b>misdirections,</b> fundamentally the entire season consisted of one defense case for Hoffman & Associates.|$|R

50|$|The Scarab Murder Case (1929) is {{a classic}} whodunit written by S. S. Van Dine. In this book, detective Philo Vance's murder {{investigation}} {{takes place in a}} private home that doubles as a museum of Egyptology, and the solution depends in part on Vance's extensive knowledge of Egyptian history and customs, which enable him to sort through suggestions of godly vengeance and reveal the <b>misdirections</b> perpetrated by the real murderer.|$|R

50|$|MahaQuizzer was envisaged as a quiz {{that would}} test the contestant's {{ability to make}} {{informed}} guesses rather than his/her memory. It typically features 150 text-questions, which must be answered in 90 minutes.The questions normally run into several sentences and may contain clues as well as <b>misdirections.</b> Participants fill in their answers, and no negative marking is applied. The quiz is normally set {{by a team of}} four senior quiz-masters.|$|R
25|$|Early voting {{seemed to}} favour Cardinals Pier Donato Cesi and Guglielmo Sirleto, {{but by the}} next morning they had been abandoned. Wanting to avoid the {{potential}} influence of cardinals who had not yet arrived, Medici then proposed two names to D' Este: those of Cardinals Albani and Montalto, and invited him to choose. D' Este imposed conditions, however, and the projected deal, when news got out, caused much indignation. Through a series of <b>misdirections</b> and strategems, Medici convinced the cardinals that Montalto was not his candidate.|$|R
50|$|In the Tempest Fugit storyline of The Incredible Hulk it is {{revealed}} that Nightmare has been plaguing the Hulk {{for years with}} hallucinations, <b>misdirections,</b> and manipulations of reality, by empowering himself {{from the effects of}} the 9/11 terrorist attacks. His second, more benevolent, daughter Daydream is also introduced in this storyarc. Nightmare here claimed that this daughter was conceived by forcibly entering the mind of the Hulk's late wife, Betty Ross Banner, raping her in her sleep, and is temporarily killed by the Hulk in retaliation.|$|R
25|$|At {{the end of}} {{the novel}} it is {{revealed}} that Osborne has been the brains behind the Pale Horse organisation; the black magic element was entirely a piece of <b>misdirection</b> on his part, while the murders were really committed by replacing products the victims had named in the CRC survey with poisoned ones. Osborne's clumsy attempt to implicate Venables was his final mistake. After Osborne's arrest, Mark and Ginger, who is recovering, become engaged.|$|E
25|$|Each episode also {{amounts to}} a {{confidence}} game played upon the viewers {{through the use of}} <b>misdirection</b> and hidden plot details that are revealed {{at the end of the}} story. Not all cons depicted are successful, and some episodes focus on the characters dealing with the consequences of their actions. However, even if a con does fail, main characters usually come out on top in some way or other...or, at times, nothing is gained but nothing lost, either.|$|E
25|$|I {{think there}} is a growing distaste for the family duties among women … that should be condemned. The efforts of women to equal man in studies, work, etc., while still {{claiming}} their sex privileges, with the dissolution of club and society life, are leading to a 'race suicide.' This ought not to be. Woman is anatomically, physiologically, and emotionally evolved for one sole and single purpose, any departure therefrom being done at the violation of her best ideals and a <b>misdirection</b> of energy.|$|E
50|$|When the {{appellant}} appealed {{against the}} sentence, {{arguing that it}} was startlingly inappropriate, the High Court held that the magistrate seemed not to have appreciated {{the difference between the}} offences of which the appellant had been convicted, and the offences of murder and attempted murder. These amounted to <b>misdirections,</b> and entitled the court to interfere with the sentence. The appeal was thus upheld, the sentence of fifteen years’ imprisonment set aside and a sentence of seven years’ and four years’ imprisonment, running concurrently, imposed.|$|R
