40|$|Morphology {{became the}} {{important}} study in Linguistics {{in case of}} word formation. Derivation and inflection affixes as field of Morphology {{became one of the}} vital ways in forming word. Recently, many previous researchers focused on derivation affixes, while the inflection affixes do not get much attention. Therefore, the researcher combined those two points in this present study. Yule (2006) ’s theory of derivation and inflection affixes are applied in this research. This theory is used to analyze the process and the function of derivation and inflection affixes in Snow novel. Qualitative content analysis is used in this study to investigate derivation and inflection affixes. The research instrument is only the researcher himself. The researcher reads and selects the word which contain derivation and inflection affixes in Snow novel. Then, the researcher analyzes the data by classifying and explaining derivation and inflection data. Derivation affixes consist of 1 adverb maker (ly), 14 noun makers (ion, ment, ness, ity, ty, cy, ure, ce, ance, ence, er, or, ist, ant), 11 adjective makers (less, ous, al, ical, ive, ible, able, ish, y, ry), 5 verb makers (prefix-en, suffixes- en, fy, ize, ate). Meanwhile, there are only eight inflection affixes which are found in Snow novel. They consist of 1 past tense maker (ed), 1 past participle maker (en), 1 present participle maker (ing), 1 third person singular <b>maker</b> (<b>S),</b> 1 possessive <b>maker</b> (<b>S),</b> 1 plural <b>maker</b> (<b>S),</b> 1 comparative <b>maker</b> (er) and 1 superlative maker (est). Derivational suffix ly to form adverb is the most frequently present in Snow novel, it is 33, 90 %. It is equal with 121 words which contain affix adverb. Meanwhile, inflectional suffix ed as past tense maker became the biggest amount in Snow novel, it is 33, 58 %. It is equal with 134 words which contain suffix to form past tense...|$|R
