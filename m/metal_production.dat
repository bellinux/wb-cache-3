5|$|Hydraulic mining, which Pliny {{referred}} to as ruina montium ("ruin of the mountains"), allowed base and precious metals to be extracted on a proto-industrial scale. The total annual iron output is estimated at 82,500tonnes. Copper was produced {{at an annual rate}} of 15,000t, and lead at 80,000t, both production levels unmatched until the Industrial Revolution; Hispania alone had a 40% share in world lead production. The high lead output was a by-product of extensive silver mining which reached 200t per annum. At its peak around the mid-2nd century AD, the Roman silver stock is estimated at 10,000t, five to ten times larger than the combined silver mass of medieval Europe and the Caliphate around 800AD. As an indication of the scale of Roman <b>metal</b> <b>production,</b> lead pollution in the Greenland ice sheet quadrupled over its prehistoric levels during the Imperial era, and dropped again thereafter.|$|E

40|$|If global {{photovoltaics}} (PV) deployment grows rapidly, {{the required}} input materials {{need to be}} supplied at an increasing rate. In this paper, we quantify the effect of PV deployment levels {{on the scale of}} <b>metals</b> <b>production.</b> For example, we find that if cadmium telluride {copper indium gallium diselenide} PV accounts for more than 3 % { 10 %} of electricity generation by 2030, the required growth rates for the production of indium and tellurium would exceed historically-observed production growth rates for a large set of metals. In contrast, even if crystalline silicon PV supplies all electricity in 2030, the required silicon production growth rate would fall within the historical range. More generally, this paper highlights possible constraints to the rate of scaling up <b>metals</b> <b>production</b> for some PV technologies, and outlines an approach to assessing projected metals growth requirements against an ensemble of past growth rates from across the <b>metals</b> <b>production</b> sector. The framework developed in this paper may be useful for evaluating the scalability {{of a wide range of}} materials and devices, to inform technology development in the laboratory, as well as public and private research investment...|$|R
500|$|Economic {{indicators}} {{have improved}} after {{the financial crisis}} of 2007–2008. After several consecutive years of high growth, GDP contracted 5.5 per cent in 2009 and unemployment remained above 12 per cent. Industrial output declined 10 per cent, mining by 31 per cent, and ferrous and <b>metal</b> <b>production</b> marked a 60 per cent drop. Positive growth was restored in 2010, although investments and consumption continue to decline steadily due to rising unemployment. The same year, intercompany debt exceeded €51 billion, meaning that 60 per cent of all Bulgarian companies were mutually indebted. By 2012, it had increased to €83 billion, or 227 per cent of GDP. The government implemented strict austerity measures with IMF and EU encouragement to some positive fiscal results, but the social consequences of these measures have been [...] "catastrophic" [...] according to the International Trade Union Confederation. Corruption remains another obstacle to economic growth. Bulgaria {{is one of the}} most corrupt European Union members and ranks 75th in the Corruption Perceptions Index. Weak law enforcement and overall low capacity of civil service remain as challenges in curbing corruption. However, fighting against corruption has become the focus of the government because of the EU accession, and several anti-corruption programs have been undertaken by different government agencies.|$|E

40|$|Oxide to metal {{conversion}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} energy-intensive steps in the value chain for <b>metals</b> <b>production.</b> Solid oxide membrane (SOM) electrolysis process provides a general route for directly reducing various metal oxides to their respective metals, alloys, or intermetallics.

In this paper, a careful study of the SOM electrolysis process using equivalent DC circuit modeling is performed and correlated to the experimental results. A discussion on relative importance of each resistive element in the circuit and on possible ways of lowering the rate-limiting resistive elements provides a generic guideline for designing optimum SOM electrolysis cells...|$|R
