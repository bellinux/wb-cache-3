2500|$|Unlike the {{preceding}} Electricity Feed-in Act, feed-in tariffs were now specified {{in absolute terms}} and no longer tied to the prevailing electricity price. [...] The tariffs also differentiated between scale (larger plants received less) and electricity yield (wind turbines in low-wind areas received more). [...] The new tariffs were based on cost-recovery plus profit and increased substantially. [...] For instance, photovoltaic remuneration rose from 8.5¢/kWh {{to a maximum of}} 51¢/kWh. [...] Offshore wind, geothermal energy, and <b>mine</b> <b>gas</b> were included for the first time. [...] The concept of an annual reduction or 'degression' was introduced, with annual degression rates varying between 1% for biomass and 5% for photovoltaics. [...] Photovoltaics installations were capped at 350MWp to control costs (later raised to 1000MWp in 2002 and removed in 2004).|$|E

50|$|On 1 August 2014, {{a revised}} Renewable Energy Sources Act entered into force. Specific {{deployment}} corridors now stipulate {{the extent to}} which renewable energy is to be expanded in the future and the funding rates (feed-in tariffs) gradually will no longer be fixed by the government, but will be determined by auction. Wind and solar power are to be targeted over hydro, gas (landfill gas, sewage gas, and <b>mine</b> <b>gas),</b> geothermal, and biomass. In late-2015, this new scheme is being tested, as a pilot project, for ground-mounted PV installations. With the Renewable Energy Sources Act (2017), auctions will become commonplace for new installations also for most other types of renewables.|$|E
