40|$|Purpose: With {{the rapid}} {{development}} in the internet technologies, the applications of big data in construction have seen considerable attention. Currently, there are many input/output modes of capturing construction knowledge related to all construction stages. On the other hand, BIM systems {{have been developed to}} help in storing various structured data of buildings. However, these systems cannot fully capture the knowledge and unstructured data utilised in the operation of building systems in a usable format that utilises the intelligent capabilities of BIM systems. Therefore, this research aims to adopt the concept of Big Data and develop a Spoken Dialogue BIM system to capture buildings operation knowledge; particularly for building maintenance and refurbishment. Design/methodology/approach: The proposed system integrates cloud-based spoken dialogue system and case-based reasoning BIM system. Findings: The system acts as an interactive expert agent that seeks answers from the user for questions specific to building maintenance problems and help searching for solutions from previously stored knowledge cases. The practices of monitoring and maintaining buildings performance can be more efficient by the retrieval of relevant solutions from the captured knowledge to new problems when maintaining buildings components. The developed system enables easier capture and search for solutions to new problems with a more comprehensive retrieval of information. Originality/value: Capturing <b>multi-modes</b> <b>data</b> into BIM systems using the cloud-based spoken dialogue systems will help construction teams utilise the high volume of data generated over building lifecycle and search for the most suitable solutions for maintenance problems.

40|$|Climate and environments of the mid-Pliocene warm period (3. 264 to 3. 025 Ma) {{have been}} {{extensively}} studied. Whilst numerical models have {{shed light on}} the nature of climate at the time, uncertainties in their predictions have not been systematically examined. The Pliocene Model Intercomparison Project quantifies uncertainties in model outputs through a coordinated multi-model and <b>multi-mode</b> <b>data</b> intercomparison. Whilst commonalities in model outputs for the Pliocene are clearly evident, we show substantial variation in the sensitivity of models to the implementation of Pliocene boundary conditions. Models appear able to reproduce many regional changes in temperature reconstructed from geological proxies. However, data model comparison highlights that models potentially underestimate polar amplification. To assert this conclusion with greater confidence, limitations in the time-averaged proxy data currently available must be addressed. Furthermore, sensitivity tests exploring the known unknowns in modelling Pliocene climate specifically relevant to the high latitudes are essential (e. g. palaeogeography, gateways, orbital forcing and trace gasses). Estimates of longer-term sensitivity to CO 2 (also known as Earth System Sensitivity; ESS), support previous work suggesting that ESS is greater than Climate Sensitivity (CS), and suggest that the ratio of ESS to CS is between 1 and 2, with a "best" estimate of 1. 5...|$|E
40|$|Aspects of wave {{propagation}} and scattering {{with an emphasis}} on specific applications in engineering and physics are examined. Frequency-domain methods prevail. Both forward and inverse problems are considered. Typical applications of the method of moments to rough surface three-dimensional (3 -D) electromagnetic scattering require a truncation of the surface considered and call for a tapered incident wave. It is shown how such wave can be constructed as a superposition of plane waves, avoiding problems near both normal and grazing incidence and providing clean footprints and clear polarization at all angles of incidence. The proposed special choice of polarization vectors removes an irregularity at the origin of the wavenumber space and leads to a wave that is optimal in a least squared error sense. Issues in the application to 3 -D scattering from an object over a rough surface are discussed. Approximate 3 -D scalar and vector tapered waves are derived which can be evaluated without resorting to any numerical integrations. Important limitations to the accuracy and applicability of these approximations are pointed out. An analytical solution is presented for the electromagnetic induction problem of magnetic diffusion into and scattering from a permeable, highly but not perfectly conducting prolate spheroid under axial excitation, expressed in terms of an infinite matrix equation. The spheroid is assumed to be embedded in a homogeneous non-conducting medium as appropriate for low-frequency, high-contrast scattering governed by magnetoquasistatics. The solution is based on separation of variables and matching boundary conditions where the prolate spheroidal wavefunctions with complex wavenumber parameter are expanded in terms of spherical harmonics. For small skin depths, an approximate solution is constructed, which avoids any reference to the spheroidal wavefunctions. The problem of long spheroids and long circular cylinders is solved by using an infinite cylinder approximation. In some cases, our ability to evaluate the spheroidal wavefunctions breaks down at intermediate frequencies. To deal with this, a general broadband rational function approximation technique is developed and demonstrated. We treat special cases and provide numerical reference data for the induced magnetic dipole moment or, equivalently, the magnetic polarizability factor. The magnetoquasistatic response of a distribution of an arbitrary number of interacting small conducting and permeable objects is also investigated. Useful formulations are provided for expressing the magnetic dipole moment of conducting and permeable objects of general shape. An alternative to Tikhonov regularization for deblurring and inverse diffraction, based on a local extrapolation scheme, is described, analyzed, and illustrated numerically for the cases of continuation of fields obeying Laplace and Helmholtz equations. At the outset of the development, a special deconvolution problem, where a parameter describes the degree of additive blurring, is considered. No a priori knowledge on the unblurred data is assumed. A standard solution based on an output least squares formulation includes a regularization parameter into a linear, shift-invariant filter. The proposed alternative approach takes advantage of the analyticity of the smoothing process with respect to the blurring parameter. Here a simple local extrapolation scheme is employed. The problem is encountered in applications involving potential theories dealing with magnetostatics, electrostatics, and gravity data. As a generalization to the dynamic case, inverse diffraction of scalar waves is considered. Examples are presented and the two methods compared numerically. The problem of inferring unknown geometry and material parameters of a waveguide model from noisy samples of the associated modal dispersion curves is considered. In a significant reduction of the complexity of a common inversion methodology, the inner of two nested iterations is eliminated: The approach described does not employ explicit fitting of the data to computed dispersion curves. Instead, the unknown parameters are adjusted to minimize a cost function derived directly from the determinant of the boundary condition system matrix. This results in a very efficient inversion scheme that, in the case of noise-free data, yields exact results. <b>Multi-mode</b> <b>data</b> can be simultaneously processed without extra complications. Furthermore, the inversion scheme can accommodate an arbitrary number of unknown parameters, provided that the data have sufficient sensitivity to these parameters. As an important application, the sonic guidance condition for a fluid-filled borehole in an elastic, homogeneous, and isotropic rock formation is considered for numerical forward and inverse dispersion analysis. The parametric inversion with uncertain model parameters and the influence of bandwidth and noise are investigated numerically. The cases of multi-frequency and <b>multi-mode</b> <b>data</b> are examined. Finally, the borehole leaky-wave modes are classified according to the location of the roots of the characteristic equation on a multi-sheeted Riemann surface. A comprehensive set of dipole leaky-wave modal dispersions is computed. In an independent numerical experiment the excitation of some of these modes is demonstrated. The utilization of leaky-wave dispersion data for inversion is discussed. by Henning Braunisch. Thesis (Ph. D.)

At the user-level, a number of novel features are introduced, beyond those frequently observed in propriety software.

40|$|The {{proliferation}} of sensing devices and cost- and energy-efficient embedded processors {{has contributed to}} an increasing interest in adaptive stream mining (ASM) systems. In this class of signal processing systems, knowledge is extracted from data streams in real-time as the data arrives, {{rather than in a}} store-now, process later fashion. The evolution of machine learning methods in many application areas has contributed to demands for efficient and accurate information extraction from streams of data arriving at distributed, mobile, and heterogeneous processing nodes. To enhance accuracy, and meet the stringent constraints in which they must be deployed, it is important for ASM systems to be effective in adapting knowledge extraction approaches and processing configurations based on data characteristics and operational conditions. In this thesis, we address these challenges in design and implementation of ASM systems. We develop systematic methods and supporting design tools for ASM systems that integrate (1) foundations of dataflow modeling for high level signal processing system design, and (2) the paradigm on Dynamic Data-Driven Application Systems (DDDAS). More specifically, the contributions of this thesis can be broadly categorized in to three major directions: 1. We develop a new design framework that systematically applies dataflow methodologies for high level signal processing system design, and adaptive stream mining based on dynamic topologies of classifiers. In particular, we introduce a new design environment, called the lightweight dataflow for dynamic data driven application systems environment (LiD 4 E). LiD 4 E provides formal semantics, rooted in dataflow principles, for design and implementation of a broad class of stream mining topologies. Using this novel application of dataflow methods, LiD 4 E facilitates the efficient and reliable mapping and adaptation of classifier topologies into implementations on embedded platforms. 2. We introduce new design methods for data-driven digital signal processing (DSP) systems that are targeted to resource- and energy-constrained embedded environments, such as unmanned areal vehicles (UAVs), mobile communication platforms, and wireless sensor networks. We develop a design and implementation framework for <b>multi-mode,</b> <b>data</b> driven embedded signal processing systems, where application modes with complementary trade-offs are selected, configured, executed, and switched dynamically, in a data-driven manner. We demonstrate the utility of our proposed new design methods on an energy-constrained, multi-mode face detection application. 3. We introduce new methods for multiobjective, system-level optimization that have been incorporated into the LiD 4 E design tool described previously. More specifically, we develop new methods for integrated modeling and optimization of real-time stream mining constraints, multidimensional stream mining performance (e. g., precision and recall), and energy efficiency. Using a design methodology centered on data-driven control of and coordination between alternative dataflow subsystems for stream mining (classification modes), we develop systematic methods for exploring complex, multidimensional design spaces associated with dynamic stream mining systems, and deriving sets of Pareto-optimal system configurations that can be switched among based on data characteristics and operating constraints...|$|E
40|$|The {{launch of}} the 5 th version of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM- 5) has sparked a debate about the current {{approach}} to psychiatric classification. The most basic and enduring problem of the DSM is that its classifications are heterogeneous clinical descriptions rather than valid diagnoses, which hampers scientific progress. Therefore, more homogeneous evidence-based diagnostic entities should be developed. To this end, data-driven techniques, such as latent class- and factor analyses, have already been widely applied. However, these techniques are insufficient to account for all relevant levels of heterogeneity, among real-life individuals. There is heterogeneity across persons (p:for example, subgroups), across symptoms (s:for example, symptom dimensions) and over time (t:for example, course-trajectories) and these cannot be regarded separately.

40|$|The use {{of digital}} {{information}} in geological fields is becoming very important. Thus, informatization in geological surveys should not stagnate {{as a result}} of the level of data accumulation. The integration and sharing of distributed, multi-source, heterogeneous geological information is an open problem in geological domains. Applications and services use geological spatial data with many features, including being cross-region and cross-domain and requiring real-time updating. As a result of these features, desktop and web-based geographic information systems (GISs) experience difficulties in meeting the demand for geological spatial information. To facilitate the real-time sharing of data and services in distributed environments, a GIS platform that is open, integrative, reconfigurable, reusable and elastic would represent an indispensable tool. The purpose of this paper is to develop a geological cloud-computing platform for integrating and sharing geological information based on a cloud architecture.

40|$|This study {{focuses on}} advancements in three broad aspects of active surface wave methods: modeling, testing, and inversion. Transfer matrix, global matrix, and {{stiffness}} matrix methods {{were employed to}} comprehensively model layered structures with half-space boundary conditions for soil structures with increasing/anomalous stiffness profiles, or pavement structures with decreasing stiffness profiles and leaky waves. All three methods were programmed in MATLAB as forward algorithms. The finite element method was adopted to simulate surface wave testing for various half-space site structures with absorbing layers using increasing damping technique. An improved experimental dispersion analysis scheme was developed by scanning phase-velocity and intercept-time followed by a power-spectrum analysis to minimize side lobes and increase sharpness of dispersion images. The multichannel simulation with one receiver (MSOR) method was applied to capture the dispersion characteristics of soil sites. The reciprocity principle for surface Rayleigh waves was verified by comparing dispersion images from MSOR and multichannel analysis of surface waves (MASW) testing at the same site with the same testing system. A multichannel surface wave acquisition system was developed to improve the accuracy of measuring high-frequency and high-velocity dispersion data on pavement sites. A minimally-invasive multimodal surface wave (MMSW) method was proposed to measure <b>multi-mode</b> dispersion <b>data</b> of Rayleigh waves by using either embedded receivers at various depths to record surface wave motions generated from moving impacts on the ground surface or using a multichannel seismograph {{with an array of}} geophones on the soil surface for measuring surface wave motions caused by Standard Penetration Test hammer blows at various depths in a borehole. Stiffness matrix and finite element simulations of the MMSW method were employed to identify the critical geophone depths for optimum measurement of higher-mode motions. A hybrid genetic-simulated-annealing (GSA) algorithm was applied to solve multiple minimization and non-linear optimization problems to match the theoretical dispersion curves against their experimental counterparts. Results from simulation and real-world studies demonstrate that the advancements made in the three aspects of surface wave methods can improve the accuracy of surface wave testing results with higher resolution of experimental dispersion data, more complete multi-modal dispersion data, and higher certainty of inversion...|$|R
40|$|Synthetic Aperture Radar {{turned out}} to be a {{suitable}} tool for diverse monitoring purposes because images can be acquired independently of weather or illumination. Mainly in higher latitudes, this is the only reliable data source available throughout the year. Regarding the increasing number of SAR satellite sensors – each sensor with its own characteristic advantages – it is reasonable to integrate all available image acquisitions in one uniform image processing and evaluation environment. Such a mathematical framework was developed recently for the integration of <b>multi-mode</b> SAR <b>data,</b> i. e. multi-frequency (and therewith multi-sensor), multi-temporal, multi-polarized, and multi-scale. This technique bases on the description of SAR image data by the help of the Kennaugh elements. These layers are orthorectified, further calibrated, and finally normalized in order to restrict all measured variables to the uniform number range regardless of the data source. Thus, images of all current SAR sensors – be it TerraSAR-X, RADARSAT- 2, or ALOS-PALSAR – are processed and evaluated together in the same geometric and radiometric frame. Multi-frequency data consequently can be used to fill temporal gaps in-between the acquisitions of one special sensor on the one hand, but it can also be used to increase the information content by contributing multi-spectral layers on the other hand. The SAR image pre-processing approach additionally includes a sophisticated automated image enhancement step: the multi-scale and multi-directional multi-looking. Instead of applying a uniform look number to the whole image, the look number and therewith the degree of smoothing is adapted locally to the image content both in scale and direction. This primarily results in a smooth, but detail-preserved intensity image. Furthermore, it provides a very valuable texture information layer indicating the appropriate shape, scale, and orientation of a set of pre-defined filter masks, known as “Schmittlets”. This even allows the evaluation of local image patterns. The final step of the processing chain is a very simple, but extremely effective classification technique based on the correlation of local histograms with sample histograms of predefined classes. Thanks to the closed and uniform number range of the normalized Kennaugh elements, the histograms can easily be compared. The occurrences of the single Schmittlets are aggregated to sets of relative angles (e. g. parallel, diagonal, rectangular) in order to describe local patterns regardless of their absolute orientation in the image. Hence, radiometric information (via the Kennaugh elements) and geometric information (via the Schmittlet indices) is utilized in conjunction. In summary, this contribution presents an up-to-date approach to the automated monitoring of land cover and land cover changes on a regional scale (at least) applied on TerraSAR-X and RADARSAT- 2 acquisitions of wetlands in the Peace River – Athabasca Lake – Delta in Alberta, Canada...|$|R

Our instrument was intensively pre-tested to 50 women before finalizing survey content. This instrument was designed in calendar format to assess the number of hours worked in various household (farming and non-farming) activities in the past 24 hours and the number of days worked in each activity in the past month. The first wave of the survey was administered to 2, 421 women in August 2015. Data collection for the first wave is complete with a response rate of 98. 5 %. These data are part of the Labour Outmigration, Agricultural Productivity and Food Security project data collection, which also includes the Household Agriculture and Migration Survey data and the Agriculture and Remittance Calendar data(see Related Resources).

This study focuses on one specific, but crucial consequence - the impact of labour outmigration on agricultural productivity in migrant-sending areas. As the agriculture productivity in poor subsistence economies is closely connected with one of the world's epidemic problems: food security. FAO estimated about 870 million people were undernourished in the period 2010 - 12. The vast majority of these - 852 million live in developing countries. Thus, increased agricultural productivity in poor countries is a key tool for alleviating this problem. This proposed project aims to better understand the relationship between labour outmigration and agriculture, providing crucial information for scientific and policy development of food security concerns. Understanding the link between outmigration and agriculture is {{complicated by the fact that}} migration does not happen randomly. Additionally, changes in agricultural practices and migration are likely to influence each other. Thus, the empirical demands for adjudicating potential reciprocal relationships are high, limiting the ability of previous research to speak to these questions. To address this complication, we will leverage the Chitwan Valley Family Study (CVFS), a case control comparison design at the community level with a 15 -year panel study of a stratified systematic sample of communities, households, and individuals in Nepal. This unusual panel study enables us to address the non-random selection of individuals into migration. Furthermore, the case control design is particularly powerful for controlling macro-level effects (e. g. climate, prices, and policies) to detect the effect of change and variation in the phenomena of interest: farm labour loss, remittances, farm technology use, agricultural productivity, and women's participation in farming.

Despite the wealth of panel data, answering our specific questions requires a modest level of new data collection. Our proposed panel measurement will involve <b>multi-mode</b> mixed methods <b>data</b> collection with appropriate temporal order and timing precision necessary to assess the relationships 31. This study will generate high quality scientific outcomes that will be widely disseminated around the world. These outcomes are (i) comprehensive panel data with potential to address perplexing methodological problems; and (ii) empirical evidence of the consequences of labour outmigration, agricultural productivity, and its interplay with gender. First, the data will be made available through ICPSR and UK Data Service and publications through websites will be provided to broader audiences. Second, the findings will be disseminated among the scientific communities through presentations at national and international conferences and publication of scientific articles, research briefs, and policy briefs. Finally, our capacity building training will also enhance scientific and analytical capacity of faculty and scientists of host country institutions (AFU, NARC and others) ...|$|R
