2500|$|The [...] "Muscat family" [...] {{is highly}} populous, {{with more than}} 200 {{distinct}} members. However, among these many different grapes only a handful <b>of</b> <b>Muscat</b> varieties are widely used in wine production.

50|$|On the Greek island <b>of</b> <b>Cephallonia,</b> General Antonio Gandin, {{commander}} of the 12,000-strong Italian Acqui Division, decided to resist the German attempt to forcibly disarm his force.

25|$|While the grape's name harkens to {{the city}} of Alexandria and suggest an ancient Egyptian origin, DNA {{analysis}} has shown that <b>Muscat</b> <b>of</b> Alexandria {{is the result of a}} natural crossing between Muscat blanc à Petits Grains and the Greek wine grape Axina de Tres Bias. Though as Axina de Tres Bias has also been historically grown in Sardinia and Malta, the precise location and origins <b>of</b> <b>Muscat</b> <b>of</b> Alexandria cannot be determined. Compared to Muscat blanc à Petits Grains, <b>Muscat</b> <b>of</b> Alexandria tends to produce large, moderately loose clusters of large oval-shaped berries that are distinctive from the much smaller, round berries <b>of</b> <b>Muscat</b> blanc à Petits Grains.|$|R

2500|$|Muscat blanc à Petits Grains and <b>Muscat</b> <b>of</b> Alexandria, themselves, {{have crossed}} and have {{produced}} at least 14 different grape varieties, 5 {{of which are}} mostly cultivated in South America and 9 still found in Italy though none are of major use in wine production. More notable and widely planted offspring have come from Muscat blanc à Petits Grains and <b>Muscat</b> <b>of</b> Alexandria crossing with other grape varieties, such as the Argentine wine grapes of Cereza, Torrontés Riojano and Torrontés Sanjuanino, stemming from a cross <b>of</b> <b>Muscat</b> <b>of</b> Alexandria with [...] "Listán negro" [...] (also known as the [...] "Mission grape") ...|$|R
50|$|Recent {{research}} using DNA profiling {{has shown that}} the different Torrontés are genetically closely related but distinct grape varieties, and that Torrontés Riojano, Torrontés Sanjuanino, and Torontel (also known as Moscatel Amarillo) are all separate crossings of Mission (originally reported as Criolla Chica) and <b>Muscat</b> <b>of</b> Alexandria. Torrontés Mendocino was found to probably be a crossing <b>of</b> <b>Muscat</b> <b>of</b> Alexandria and another, so far unidentified grape variety. While the Muscat-like qualities of the Torrontés varieties meant that a relationship to <b>Muscat</b> <b>of</b> Alexandria had been expected, the presence of Mission or Criolla Chica in the pedigree was unexpected to the researchers.|$|R

2500|$|Even {{though the}} vast {{majority}} of the members <b>of</b> the <b>Muscat</b> family are dark skinned grapes, most of the major varieties used in wine production are white or [...] "pale skinned", with the one significant exception <b>of</b> <b>Muscat</b> <b>of</b> Hamburg, which is also known as Black Muscat. This dark-skinned grape is believed to have originated in the Victorian greenhouses of England, where it was first described in 1858 as being propagated by Seward Snow, gardener to the Earl de Grey. Snow described the grape as a seedling that he created from crossing the Black Hamburg grape (an old synonym of Schiava Grossa) with the White <b>Muscat</b> <b>of</b> Alexandria. In 2003, DNA analysis confirmed that <b>Muscat</b> <b>of</b> Hamburg was, indeed, a crossing <b>of</b> <b>Muscat</b> <b>of</b> Alexandria and Schiava Grossa, which makes the grape a full sibling to the central Italian grape Malvasia del Lazio which has the same parentage.|$|R
2500|$|In South Africa, <b>Muscat</b> <b>of</b> Alexandria {{is known}} as [...] "Hanepoot" [...] and was the fourth-most widely planted white wine grape variety in the country until the early 2000s. While some of the plantings were used for wine production, {{particularly}} for fortified wine, many plantings {{were used for the}} production of grape concentrate and raisins. In California, there is still more plantings <b>of</b> <b>Muscat</b> <b>of</b> Alexandria than any other Muscat variety, with most of these grapes going into anonymous jug wines from the Central Valley. As in many other places in the world, the grape had a long history of use in the United States as a raisin variety, though in the 1920s, plantings <b>of</b> <b>Muscat</b> <b>of</b> Alexandria began to decline as producers turned to more popular seedless grape varieties.|$|R
50|$|The {{story begins}} with Dr. Iannis, an {{experienced}} and multilingual doctor {{who has a}} well-established practice on the Greek island <b>of</b> <b>Cephallonia.</b> Iannis lives with his daughter Pelagia; Pelagia's mother died of tuberculosis when Pelagia was still a girl. Pelagia, now a young woman, is headstrong and intelligent, and has learned about medicine by observing her father. Some of the subsequent chapters, however, are told {{from the perspective of}} Carlo Guercio, a homosexual Italian man who has decided to join the Italian army which has been raised under the rule of Benito Mussolini during World War II.|$|R
25|$|Nearly all {{the most}} notable sweet <b>Muscats</b> <b>of</b> Greece, {{particularly}} those from the island of Samos {{and the city of}} Patras on the Peloponnese are made from Muscat blanc à Petits Grains. In the history of South African wine, the famous dessert wine of Constantia was made from this variety <b>of</b> <b>Muscat</b> and while today <b>Muscat</b> <b>of</b> Alexandria is more widely planted in South Africa, producers around Constantia are trying to reclaim some of the region's viticultural acclaim by replanting more Muscat blanc à Petits Grains and making wines {{in the style of the}} original Constantia.|$|R
2500|$|<b>Muscat</b> <b>of</b> Alexandria {{has also}} been crossed with the German / Italian wine grape Trollinger (also known as [...] "Schiava Grossa") to produce <b>Muscat</b> <b>of</b> Hamburg and Malvasia del Lazio, and with the Italian wine grapes Catarratto bianco and Bombino bianco to produce the Marsala wine grape Grillo and Moscatello Selvatico, respectively. Muscat Ottonel {{is the result of}} a {{crossing}} between one Muscat variety, [...] "Muscat d'Eisenstadt" [...] (also known as [...] "Muscat de Saumur"), with the Swiss wine grape Chasselas ...|$|R
2500|$|While <b>Muscat</b> <b>of</b> Hamburg is used {{mostly as}} a table grape {{throughout}} the world, {{there are two}} notable exceptions. The first is in California, where {{nearly all of the}} [...] <b>of</b> Black <b>Muscat</b> in cultivation in 2009 were destined for wine production, primarily to produce dessert wines. The other exception is in China, where <b>Muscat</b> <b>of</b> Hamburg is often crossed with Vitis amurensis species that are native to the region to produce wine grapes that are better adapted to the climate of various Chinese wine regions.|$|R
2500|$|Of {{the more}} than 200 grape {{varieties}} sharing [...] "Muscat" [...] (or one of its synonyms) in their name, the majority are not closely related to each other. The exception are the members <b>of</b> the <b>Muscat</b> blanc à Petits Grains and <b>Muscat</b> <b>of</b> Alexandria families. In the early 21st century, DNA analysis showed that <b>Muscat</b> <b>of</b> Alexandria was, itself, a natural crossing <b>of</b> <b>Muscat</b> blanc à Petits Grains and a black-skinned table grape variety from the Greek islands known as Axina de Tres Bias. Rarely seen outside of Greece, Axina de Tres Bias (also known as [...] "Heftakilo") is also grown in Malta and Sardinia.|$|R

25|$|While {{varieties}} such as <b>Muscat</b> <b>of</b> Alexandria tend {{to thrive}} in very warm Mediterranean climates, <b>Muscat</b> <b>of</b> Ottonel has shown an affinity for ripening in cooler continental climates, and has found a home in many Central European nations, such as Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Romania and many former republic of the Soviet Union, such as Russia, Kazakhstan, Moldova, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Ukraine.

2500|$|Like most <b>Muscat</b> varieties, <b>Muscat</b> <b>of</b> Alexandria {{is notable}} {{for being a}} {{desirable}} raisin and table grape. This {{is due in part}} to the grape's high tolerance of heat and drought conditions. While it is used in wine production (most notably on the island of Pantelleria between Sicily and Tunisia, where it makes a passito style dessert wine under the name of [...] "Zibibbo"), the grape lags far behind the reputation <b>of</b> <b>Muscat</b> blanc à Petits Grains. This is partly because <b>Muscat</b> <b>of</b> Alexandria is very vigorous and prone to produce high yields that can be easily overcropped as well as a more assertive aroma profile due to a higher concentration of the monoterpene geraniol, which produces a geranium scent, and lower concentration of nerol which a more fresh, sweet rose aroma.|$|R
5000|$|Another {{theme of}} the novel is the study of history. Dr Iannis spends much of his spare time {{attempting}} to write a history <b>of</b> <b>Cephallonia,</b> but he often finds his personal feelings and biasses running through whatever he writes. There is also a strong feeling against 'professional' history, which is suggested by Carlo Guercio's statement that [...] "I know that if we Axis win then there will be stories about mass graves in London and vice versa". This is reinforced by a quotation from Bernières which says that: [...] "history ought to be made up of the stories of ordinary people only." [...] From this viewpoint, {{it can be seen that}} Bernières is very much a revisionist historian, considering social history superior to political history.|$|R
50|$|Two other notable acts of {{brutality}} were the massacres of Italian troops at the islands <b>of</b> <b>Cephallonia</b> and Kos in September 1943, during the German {{takeover of the}} Italian occupation areas. In Cephallonia, the 12,000-strong Italian Acqui Division was attacked on September 13 by elements of 1. Gebirgs-Division with support from Stukas, and forced to surrender on 21 September after suffering some 1,300 casualties. The next day, the Germans began executing their prisoners and did not stop until more than 4,500 Italians had been shot. The 4,000 or so survivors were put aboard ships for the mainland, {{but some of them}} sank after hitting mines in the Ionian Sea, where another 3,000 were lost. The Cephallonia massacre serves as the background for the novel Captain Corelli's Mandolin.|$|R
50|$|This grape {{is often}} {{confused}} with the distinct and separate grape varieties <b>Muscat</b> <b>of</b> Alexandria (aka Zibibbo in Sicily; aka Hanepoot in South Africa) and Muscat Ottonel, most common in Austria and Alsace but originally bred in Loire Valley in 1852.|$|R
