40|$|This thesis {{contributes}} {{to our understanding}} of the development and diffusion <b>of</b> <b>vehicle</b> services, and to how information technology interacts with forms of organization and business models to undermine or support the development <b>of</b> <b>vehicle</b> services. The overall research question asked in the thesis is: what are the technical, business and organizational prerequisites for the development and diffusion of a rich variety <b>of</b> <b>vehicle</b> services? The development and diffusion <b>of</b> <b>vehicle</b> services have been empirically investigated by ethnographic field studies, prototype software development and case studies as part of a collaborative practice research approach involving the Volvo Group. Based on ethnographic field studies <b>of</b> current <b>vehicle</b> repair service work, analytical patterns were identified to better understand the core foundation <b>of</b> <b>vehicle</b> services. In the prototype development, a platform was developed, which allowed exploring the technical prerequisites for the development <b>of</b> <b>vehicle</b> services. Two case studies examined, first, the development of IT support for vehicle services and, secondly, the organization <b>of</b> <b>vehicle</b> service development. The results from all these collaborative practice research activities suggest that the vehicle industry needs to revise its conception <b>of</b> <b>vehicle</b> services as services extending product features in favor <b>of</b> <b>vehicle</b> services enriching the use <b>of</b> the <b>vehicle.</b> Thus, the thesis argues that the lack <b>of</b> <b>vehicle</b> services, rather than being just a question of technical nature, can only be remedied by a change of perspective from products to services, which in turn influences the choice of technology, forms of organization and underlying business models. Vehicle services are here conceptualized as services interacting across the ecosystem <b>of</b> <b>vehicle</b> stakeholders to enrich the customer’s use <b>of</b> the <b>vehicle.</b> Hence, to be really useful, vehicle services must roam organizational and technical boundaries and cannot be treated as properties <b>of</b> the <b>vehicle.</b> This requires vehicle manufacturers to adopt appropriate forms of technology and organization. The concept of information infrastructure is shown to be appropriate since it allows separating services from shared infrastructural resources. Such a separation also allows opening up the development <b>of</b> <b>vehicle</b> services to other service providers. Open innovation is described as a suitable form of opening up the innovation and development <b>of</b> <b>vehicle</b> services to a larger group of service providers. The thesis argues that these three prerequisites – business model, technology and organization – have to closely interact to facilitate the development and diffusion of a rich variety <b>of</b> <b>vehicle</b> services. The general contribution of the thesis is to show how product oriented industries have to revise their proprietary mindset in favor of an open attitude to successfully engage in the development of services...|$|R
