50|$|The LAIR (Living Amphibians, Invertebrates, and Reptiles), {{which opened}} in 2012, is a $14 million indoor-outdoor exhibit complex that focuses on herps and {{terrestrial}} arthropods. Guests first pass through the Oak Woodland Pond, where local species can move in and live among native plants. The next feature is the 6000 sq ft main building where the Damp Forest houses poison dart frogs, Chinese giant salamanders, and a recreation of a Daintree Rainforest river with archerfish, Australian lungfish, and Fly River turtles. The Mangshan pitviper, west African green mamba, South American bushmaster and other snakes live in the next segment of the building, Betty's Bite and Squeeze Room, named after GLAZA co-chair Betty White. Guests can see keepers care for animals behind the scenes in the Behind the Glass room. The Care and Conservation Room showcases Gray's monitor and other endangered reptiles. After the main building is Arroyo Lagarto, a set of outdoor exhibits for Madagascar radiated tortoise, <b>Madagascar</b> <b>spider</b> <b>tortoise,</b> desert lizards, and California desert tortoise. A 2000 sq ft secondary building, the Desert LAIR, houses the Gila monster, Sonoran toad, Arizona Desert hairy scorpion, California kingsnake, and other species from Mexico, Arizona, and Southern California. The LAIR ends with Crocodile Swamp, an outdoor exhibit home to false gharials.|$|E
40|$|C. Supporting {{statement}} The <b>Madagascar</b> <b>spider</b> <b>tortoise</b> (Pyxis arachnoides) is {{endemic to}} south-western Madagascar. Its populations {{have recently been}} heavily damaged from excessive harvesting. As a result, a workshop on the Conservation Assessment Management Plan (CAMP) organized by IUCN in May 2001 recommended including the spider tortoise in CITES Appendix I and changing the listing of the species from Endangered to Critically Endangered (IUCN/CBSG, 2002).

40|$|The IUCN Red List for Threaten Species {{is widely}} {{regarded}} as the authority for assessing a particular species conservation risk. However, this process has come under some criticism for designating species as high conservation risk on a precautionary principle, using limited data, grey literature or anecdotal information. The <b>Madagascar</b> <b>spider</b> <b>tortoise</b> (Pyxis arachnoides) is one such species, up-listed from Vulnerable to Critically Endangered status, based on data of limited spatial resolution and anecdotal information, suggesting risk from poaching and habitat loss, resulting in significant reduction in population size, thus allowing the criteria of Critically Endangered to be met (A 4 cd; E). This study assesses these risks to the species at a range wide level, using presence/absence surveying and incorporating data into a geographical information system to describe distribution contraction within differing areas of land use. This was coupled with a line transect distance sampling procedure to assess real time population size within the current area of occupancy. A Mark-Capture-Recapture, Cormack-Jolly-Seber model and a stage class, projection matrix was developed to model mean annual survival, finite growth rate and population survival. Finally, remotely sensed habitat loss was monitored within the core of the species range. These data suggest that the species has suffered a reduction of 70. 8 % from suspected historical extent of occurrence to the current area of occupancy, now inhabiting a total area of 2, 463. 8 km', with 73. 5 % of the current distribution occurring within existing or proposed protected areas. Range wide population density equals 226. 9 (95 % Cl 168. 1 - 306. 3) tortoises km", with a total global population estimate of 664, 980 (95 % Cl. 492, 680 - 897, 550). Adult mean annual survival is 0. 82 (SEÂ± 0. 15), however juvenile survival cannot be modelled due to low recapture. There is an actual mean population decline of 1 0. 8 %, coupled with mean forest loss of 1. 2 % yr" (2003 - 2011), within the core of the range. The projection matrix model reveals finite population growth to be A=O. 983, indicative of a c. 1. 4 % decline annually, with adult survival the most sensitive parmeter to population survival. 'Projection modelling suggests the species will probably become ecologically non-viable in approximately 170 years. Results confirm the species IUCN Critically Endangered status. Development programs 'and tighter protected area management are required to address the poverty induced drivers threatening this species. This assessment provides an ideal model for similar dry forest tortoise species suffering status data deficiency. The author proposes a temporary five year condition to be placed on the designation of species considered to be of high conservation concern, similar to this species, up-listed on the Red List using anecdotal information or grey literature, whilst funds are secured and empirical peer reviewed data is obtained to confirm the status in the wild.

50|$|The flat-backed <b>spider</b> <b>tortoise</b> is {{confined}} to lowland fragments of dry, deciduous forest, found only {{on the west coast}} of Madagascar. It is concentrated between the Monrondava and Tsirbihina rivers. The forests inhabited by the flat-backed <b>spider</b> <b>tortoise</b> grow on loose sandy soils and the tortoises take shelter amongst the leaf litter of the forest floor during their inactive seasons. The flat-backed <b>spider</b> <b>tortoise</b> is active only during the warm/raining season (December-March), with most activity concentrated during and after rain. During the cooler dry season the flat-backed <b>spider</b> <b>tortoise</b> enters a stage similar to hibernation known as aestivation, the species buries itself and lies dormant.|$|R

50|$|The flat-backed <b>spider</b> <b>tortoise</b> {{receives}} {{its name}} from its distinctive physical appearance. Its upper-shell (carapace) and tail are outstandingly flatter than the common tortoise. Its carapace is patterned, with each scute ranging in color from light brown to yellow center and a dark brown to black outline. In older tortoise, an additional yellow border {{can be seen that}} surrounds the dark outline. Yellow rays extend outwards from the center of each scute. Scutes along the borders of the shell (marginal) are usually dark in color, surrounded by a yellow band. The lower shell (plastron) usually appears to be yellow in color, with scattered dark spots or rays. The limbs are covered with scales that range from yellow to brown in color. The head, on the other hand, is usually darker in color (ranges from dark brown to black, with some yellow markings).|$|R

40|$|Pyxis arachnoides inhabits the dry, coastal {{forests of}} {{southwest}} Madagascar; a biologically unique ecoregion severely threatened by unsustainable small scale agricultural practices. Using remotely sensed data we established vegetation loss remains unabated within our study area at 1. 2 % year- 1; consistent with ecoregion wide vegetation loss between 1990 and 2000. We monitored tortoise population density on four occasions over 8 years {{and developed a}} stage class projection matrix to model the finite growth rate, matrix sensitivities and elasticities of the population. Monitoring revealed an actual mean population decline of 10. 8 % between 2003 and 2011. Our projection matrix model suggested the finite rate of growth to be Ê = 0. 986, indicative of 1. 4 % year- 1 decline {{for the duration of}} the existence of the population, with adult survival as the most sensitive parameter to overall survival of the population. Projection modeling suggests that the population would possibly become functionally non viable in approximately 170 years. As our study was heavily reliant on the use of surrogate data, more information is needed on pre-adult survival and wild reproductive rates. Our study site currently represents a population of exceptional density, therefore, other less dense populations, subjected to the further stresses of poaching will likely become functionally non viable much sooner. This study highlights the utility of population projection matrices in determining the vulnerability of chelonians; a globally threatened taxon. In the case of the <b>spider</b> <b>tortoise,</b> well coordinated development programs and tighter protected area management are required to address the poverty induced drivers forcing this species closer to extinction...|$|R
50|$|The wall crab spiders {{are members}} of the family Selenopidae. The Selenopidae are one of several {{families}} variously called crab spiders because of their laterigrade (sideways-moving) legs. This family consists of about 175 species in four genera, of which Selenops is the best known. The family is primarily tropical with the genus Anyphops confined to Sub-Saharan Africa and the genus Hovops confined to <b>Madagascar.</b> The <b>spiders</b> are very flat and are commonly found on walls or under rocks. They are quite agile, making them difficult to capture. In addition, their coloring makes them often quite difficult to see. Like almost all Entelegynae, they have eight eyes. At least one (possibly extinct) species of Garcorops, G. jadis, is known only from subfossil copal.|$|R
