5000|$|Wine {{regions with}} <b>maritime</b> <b>climates</b> are characterised by their close {{proximity}} to large bodies of water (such as oceans, estuaries and inland seas) that moderate their temperatures. <b>Maritime</b> <b>climates</b> share many characteristics with both Mediterranean and continental climates and are often described as a [...] "middle ground" [...] between the two extremes. Like Mediterranean <b>climates,</b> <b>maritime</b> <b>climates</b> have a long growing season, with water currents moderating the region's temperatures. However, while Mediterranean climates are usually very dry during the growing season, <b>maritime</b> <b>climates</b> are often subject to the viticultural hazards of excessive rain and humidity which may promote various grape diseases, such as mold and mildew. Like continental <b>climates,</b> <b>maritime</b> <b>climates</b> will have distinct seasonal changes, but they are usually not as drastic, with warm, rather than hot, summers and cool, rather than cold, winters. <b>Maritime</b> <b>climates</b> also exist in some wine-growing areas of highlands of subtropical and tropical latitudes, including the southern Appalachian Mountains in the USA, eastern Australian highlands, and central highlands of Mexico.|$|R
50|$|Solar food drying is {{effective}} and practical {{in most of}} the populated places of the world. A general rule is that, if you can grow a successful vegetable garden, then there is enough solar energy to dry the food you produce (some overcast, northern <b>maritime</b> <b>climates</b> are the exception).|$|R

5|$|Like {{much of the}} British Isles, Coatbridge {{experiences}} a temperate <b>maritime</b> <b>climate</b> with relatively cool summers and mild winters. The prevailing wind is from the west. Regular but generally light precipitation occurs throughout the year.|$|E
5|$|Washington {{is in the}} {{northern}} part of the humid subtropical climate zone (Köppen: Cfa) However, under the Trewartha climate classification, the city has a temperate <b>maritime</b> <b>climate</b> (Do). Winters are usually chilly with light snow, and summers are hot and humid. The District is in plant hardiness zone 8a near downtown, and zone 7b elsewhere in the city, indicating a humid subtropical climate.|$|E
5|$|Wales {{lies within}} the north {{temperate}} zone. It has a changeable, <b>maritime</b> <b>climate</b> {{and is one}} of the wettest countries in Europe. Welsh weather is often cloudy, wet and windy, with warm summers and mild winters. The long summer days and short winter days result from Wales' northerly latitudes (between 53° 43′ N and 51° 38′ N). Aberystwyth, at the midpoint of the country's west coast, has nearly 17hours of daylight at the summer solstice. Daylight at midwinter there falls to just over sevenandahalf hours.|$|E
50|$|Megasporaceae are {{a family}} of fungi {{belonging}} to the Ascomycota. Taxa are lichenized with green algae, and grow on rocks, often in <b>maritime</b> <b>climates</b> close to fresh water. Phylogenetic analysis has shown that this family {{is related to the}} Pertusariaceae, another family of lichens. The genus Aspicilia was moved here from the Hymeneliaceae.|$|R
50|$|Climate is {{influenced}} by the temperatures of the surface waters and water currents as well as winds. Because of the ocean's great capacity to store and release heat, <b>maritime</b> <b>climates</b> are more moderate and have less extreme seasonal variations than inland climates. Precipitation can be approximated from coastal weather data and air temperature from water temperatures.|$|R
5|$|It is also {{grown as}} an {{ornamental}} tree in Northern Hemisphere countries with mild <b>maritime</b> <b>climates,</b> including {{parts of the}} upper West Coast of the United States and the warmer parts of the British Isles, where its common names include Torbay palm and Torquay palm. It does not do well in hot tropical climates like Queensland, Southeast Asia and Florida.|$|R
5|$|An oceanic (or <b>maritime)</b> <b>climate</b> is {{typically}} found {{along the west}} coasts at the middle latitudes of all the world's continents, bordering cool oceans, as well as southeastern Australia, and is accompanied by plentiful precipitation year-round. The Mediterranean climate regime resembles the climate of the lands in the Mediterranean Basin, parts of western North America, parts of Western and South Australia, in southwestern South Africa and in parts of central Chile. The climate is characterized by hot, dry summers and cool, wet winters. A steppe is a dry grassland. Subarctic climates are cold with continuous permafrost and little precipitation.|$|E
5|$|Malvern {{lies in the}} Lower Severn/Avon plain affording it {{a degree}} of shelter caused {{by virtue of its}} {{nestling}} in between the Cotswold hills to the east, the Welsh Hills and Mountains to the west, and Birmingham plateau to the north. Although as with all the British Isles it has a <b>maritime</b> <b>climate,</b> the local topography means summer warmth can become emphasised by a slight foehn effect off the surrounding hills. The record maximum stands at 35.8c(96.4f) set in August 1990. Typically 17.3 days of the year will reach 25.1c(77.2f) or higher and the annual warmest day should reach 29.8c(85.6f) according to the 1971–00 observing period.|$|E
5|$|Wales has a <b>maritime</b> <b>climate,</b> the {{predominant}} winds being southwesterlies and westerlies blowing {{in from the}} Atlantic Ocean. This means that the weather in Wales is in general mild, cloudy, wet and windy. The country's wide geographic variations cause localised differences in amounts of sunshine, rainfall and temperature. Rainfall in Wales varies widely, with the highest average annual totals in Snowdonia and the Brecon Beacons, and the lowest near the coast and in the east, close to the English border. Throughout Wales, the winter months are significantly wetter than the summer ones. Snow is comparatively rare near sea level in Wales, but much more frequent over the hills, and the uplands experience harsher conditions in winter than the more low-lying parts.|$|E
5000|$|Vilsandi {{has one of}} {{the most}} <b>maritime</b> <b>climates</b> in Estonia and thus it {{experiences}} generally cooler summers and milder winters than other parts of Estonia with smaller annual temperature range. Vilsandi is as well is usually the part of Estonia which receives the most hours of sunlight during a year with its weather station statistically the location with the most sunshine in Estonia.|$|R
40|$|Direct cooling of {{buildings}} by water evaporation {{has traditionally been}} seen as appropriate, only, in dry and arid climates, which experience high levels of wet bulb temperature depression. The technique has generally not been applied in <b>maritime</b> <b>climates</b> where low levels of wet bulb temperature depression are frequently found. However, recent developments in enhancing heat and mass transfer in cooling towers, together {{with the success of}} high temperature sensible cooling systems, such as chilled ceiling panels and beams, have prompted a review of the evaporative cooling technique as an effective and low energy means of cooling modern deep plan buildings, in <b>maritime</b> <b>climates.</b> At present, however, there is little in depth research and analysis of the performance, energy efficiency, and availability of this form of cooling in maritime conditions. To address these issues an experimental research programme has been established with a view to demonstrating the potential and optimising the design of this form of cooling under low approach conditions. This paper presents the results of recent experimental research into the electrical consumption of a prototype inverter controlled cooling tower when generating cooling water at the chilled water temperatures required for chilled ceiling panels and beams, under varying load and wet bulb temperature approach conditions. Energy consumption efficiencies are presented for a range of specific conditions and typical annual efficiencies are computed. Results are compared with typical energy consumption efficiencies of conventional, vapour compression based, cooling systems. A considerable potential for the reduction of cooling electrical energy consumption, in <b>maritime</b> <b>climates,</b> is shown...|$|R

5|$|According to the Köppen classification, the British Isles {{experience}} a <b>maritime</b> <b>climate</b> characterised by relatively cool summers and mild winters. Lincolnshire's {{position on the}} east of the Isles allows for a sunnier and warmer climate relative to the national average, and {{it is one of the}} driest counties in the United Kingdom. Although it may vary depending on altitude and proximity to the coast, the mean average temperature for the East of England is approximately 9°C to 10.5°C; the highest temperature recorded in the region was 37.3°C at Cavendish on 10 August 2003. On average, the region experiences 30 days of rainfall in winter and 25 in summer, with 15 days of thunder and 6–8 days of hail per year; on 25 August 2001, hail the size of golf balls were reported in Sleaford and other parts of central Lincolnshire. Wind tends to affect the north and west of the country more than the East, and Lincolnshire tends to receive no more than 2 days of gale per year (where gale is a gust of wind at >34knots, sustained for at least 10 minutes). Despite this, tornadoes form more often in the East of England than elsewhere in the country; Sleaford experienced tornadoes in 2006 and 2012, both of which caused damage to property.|$|E
5|$|DNA {{evidence}} has shown Cabernet Sauvignon {{is the result}} of the crossing of two other Bordeaux grape varieties— Cabernet franc and Sauvignon blanc— which has led grapevine historians, or ampelographers, to believe that the grape originated in Bordeaux. Early records indicate that the grape was a popular planting in the Médoc region during the 18th century. The loose berry clusters and thick skins of the grape provided a good resistance to rot in the sometimes wet <b>maritime</b> <b>climate</b> of Bordeaux. The grape continued to grow in popularity until the Powdery mildew epidemic of 1852 exposed Cabernet Sauvignon's sensitivity to that grape disease. With vineyards severely ravaged or lost, many Bordeaux wine growers turned to Merlot, increasing its plantings to where it soon became the most widely planted grape in Bordeaux. As the region's winemakers started to better understand the area's terroir and how the different grape varieties performed in different region, Cabernet Sauvignon increased in plantings all along the Left Bank region of the Gironde river in the Médoc as well as Graves region, where it became the dominant variety in the wine blends. In the Right bank regions of Saint-Émilion and Pomerol, Cabernet is a distant third in plantings behind Merlot & Cabernet franc.|$|E
5|$|In France, Sauvignon blanc {{is grown}} in the <b>maritime</b> <b>climate</b> of Bordeaux (especially in Entre-Deux-Mers, Graves and Pessac-Léognan as a dry wine, and in Sauternes as a sweet wine) {{as well as the}} {{continental}} climate of the Loire Valley (as Pouilly Fumé, Sancerre, and Sauvignon de Touraine). The climates of these areas are particularly favorable in slowing the ripening on the vine, allowing the grape more time to develop a balance between its acidity and sugar levels. This balance is important {{in the development of the}} intensity of the wine's aromas. Winemakers in France pay careful attention to the terroir characteristics of the soil and the different elements that it can impart to the wine. The chalk and Kimmeridgean marl of Sancerre and Pouilly produces wines of richness and complexity while areas with more compact chalk soils produces wines with more finesse and perfume. The gravel soil found near the Loire River and its tributaries impart spicy, floral and mineral flavors while in Bordeaux, the wines have a fruitier personality. Vines planted in flint tend to produce the most vigorous and longest lasting wines.|$|E

25|$|The wine {{regions of}} the Left bank of the Gironde estuary are bordered by large {{coniferous}} forest land that have a tempering effect on the <b>maritime</b> <b>climate</b> of the area.|$|E
50|$|In addition, {{numerous}} {{species such}} as mammoths on Wrangel Island and St. Paul Island survived in human-free refugia despite changes in climate. This would not be expected if climate change were responsible (unless their <b>maritime</b> <b>climates</b> offered some protection against climate change not afforded to coastal populations on the mainland). Under normal ecological assumptions island populations should be more vulnerable to extinction due to climate change because of small populations and an inability to migrate to more favorable climes.|$|R
