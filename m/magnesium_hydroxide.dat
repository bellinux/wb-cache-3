5|$|During the Second World War {{the running}} of Gibb and Partners fell largely to Paton and James Guthrie Brown. Gibb and Partners gained {{a large number of}} {{government}} contracts and within a few weeks of {{the start of the war}} in September 1939 the workforce increased by 2000. Paton designed and sited several Royal Ordnance Factories; and in March 1940 travelled to Turkey to construct an iron and steel works there. Whilst in Turkey he was contracted to build emplacements to contain guns from mothballed battleships in the Dardanelles. The construction of the emplacements was completed but the guns would later be prevented from reaching the site by the Axis occupation of Greece. Paton made his way back to Britain via Greece, Italy and France and arrived home two days prior to the Italian declaration of war against the Allies on 10 June 1940. He also constructed a plant at Barry in South Wales for the extraction of <b>Magnesium</b> <b>Hydroxide</b> from the sea, a turbine factory for British Thomson-Houston Company and a £7 million underground aircraft engine factory. From 1943-44 Paton supervised the construction, in London Docks, of the precast concrete caissons required for the construction of Mulberry Harbours following the Normandy Landings. From 1944-45 he was in charge of the rebuilding of houses damaged by V-2 rockets in the London districts of Wanstead and Woodford.|$|E
5|$|Western Australia's Deputy Mineralogist gave {{evidence}} that he had identified <b>magnesium</b> <b>hydroxide,</b> a corrosion product, in fuel passages in one of Amana's engines. Counsel for the Department of Civil Aviation explained that evidence gathered during investigation of the crash indicated water {{in some of the}} fuel on board Amana was responsible for the corrosion products found in engines numbers 1 and 4; for the rough running of an engine heard by a number of witnesses; and for the intermittent failure of all engines, leading to the aircraft descending to ground level. The Inquiry heard evidence from the Department of Civil Aviation's Acting Chief Inspector of Air Accidents, C.A.J. Lum, a former RAAF Douglas Dakota pilot, who described his personal experience of a flight in 1946 in which all fuel tanks were checked for the presence of water prior to take-off and the flight proceeded normally for 20 minutes until both engines began running roughly. Lum returned to the aerodrome and checked again for water in the tanks, this time finding a significant amount of water. Counsel for the Vacuum Oil Co. explained that it was almost impossible for water to be introduced to an aircraft during refuelling, and vigorously rejected the theory that water in the fuel contributed to the crash.|$|E
5|$|Engine number 4 {{suffered}} only minor, external damage. It was dismantled by {{the investigation}} team {{in an attempt}} to determine why it might have been shut down by the crew. A substantial amount of corrosion product was found in the passages of the fuel flow meter on engine number 4. Western Australia's Deputy Mineralogist identified the corrosion product as <b>magnesium</b> <b>hydroxide.</b> This is a corrosion product formed by reaction of magnesium and water, suggesting the fuel passages had been filled with water in the months between the crash and the detailed examination of the engine. Charles Gibbs, an engine specialist employed by the Department of Civil Aviation, estimated at least 45 cubic centimetres of water must have been involved. Rain falling on the crash site before engine number 4 was removed could not account for this much water in the fuel passages. Gibbs first examined the fuel system of engine number 4 and discovered the corrosion about two months after the accident. He conducted a test on an identical flow meter and found that after he left water in the fuel flow passages for approximately 8 weeks a similar amount of corrosion product developed. This suggested the rough running heard by witnesses on the ground may have been caused by water in the fuel reaching engine number 4. The steel rotor in the fuel pump of engine number 1 was slightly corroded but the fuel systems of engines 2 and 3 showed no evidence of corrosion. Investigators formed the opinion that the rough running heard by witnesses on the ground, and the crew's decision to shut down engine number 4 and feather its propeller, may have been related to water in the fuel reaching that engine. Similarly, the intermittent loss of power on all engines in the final minutes of the flight may indicate that all engines were receiving fuel contaminated with water.|$|E

50|$|In {{swimming}} pools, {{hard water}} is manifested by a turbid, or cloudy (milky), appearance to the water. Calcium and <b>magnesium</b> <b>hydroxides</b> are both soluble in water.

Aqueous solutions of these metal hydroxides absorb carbon dioxide from the air, forming the insoluble carbonates, giving rise to the turbidity. This often results from the pH being excessively high (pH > 7.6).

In order to obtain calcium carbonate in different sorts as final products from the mentioned waste, studies regarding the elimination of impurities were realised. For this purpose, the hydrodynamics classification in centrifugal field by passing the slurries through batteries of hydrocyclones, was taking into consideration as separation method. Rubber hydrocyclones of different diameters were fed through aqueous slurries of calcium and <b>magnesium</b> <b>hydroxides,</b> and through slime of calcium carbonate respectively.

30|$|All {{chemicals}} {{used for the}} synthesis of <b>magnesium</b> borate <b>hydroxide</b> nanostructures were analytical grade (Fisher Scientific) and used without further purification. In a typical synthesis, 3.846 g of magnesium nitrate hexahydrate (MgNO 3 · 6 H 2 O) and 0.568 g of sodium borohydrate (NaBH 4) were separately mixed in 10 mL distilled water. Then the two solutions were put together and placed in ultrasonicator (Branson, Model 2510, 40 kHz) for about 30 min to get homogeneous and clear solution. The solution was put into a Teflon liner (30 mL capacity) up to 80 % of the total volume. The Teflon lined autoclave was sealed {{and placed in a}} furnace and maintained at 200 °C for 24 h (in air). After the completion of the hydrothermal reaction, the autoclave was cooled down to room temperature naturally. The precipitate was filtered and washed repeatedly with distilled water and ethanol (100 % Reagent alcohol, Fisher Scientific) and was later dried at 100 °C for 4 h. The procured powders were used further for various characterizations. The above synthesis procedure was repeated for 1.5 M MgNO 3 · 6 H 2 O and 1.5 M NaBH 4 with the addition of 0.184 g (0.1 M) Cetyl trimethylammonium bromide (CTAB), 0.144 g (0.1 M) sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) and 2 mL Triton X- 100, respectively, at 200 °C for 24 h. The surfactants CTAB, SDS and Triton are cationic, anionic and non-ionic, respectively. The <b>magnesium</b> borate <b>hydroxide</b> nanowhiskers synthesized with and without surfactant were annealed at 500 °C for 4 h in air.

The <b>magnesium</b> borate <b>hydroxide</b> nanowhiskers fabricated without surfactant and with CTAB, SDS and Triton are termed as MBH-NON, MBH-CTAB, MBH-SDS and MBH-Triton, respectively.

40|$|HyperSpectral Imaging (HSI) is a {{powerful}} technique suitable to develop analytical protocols for materials identification difficult to handle and investigate through classical chemical based analytical approaches. Asbestos fibers can be considered one of these products. Asbestos, largely utilized {{in the past for}} its characteristics (i. e.

Selected samples of cement-asbestos fibers, of different nature, were collected and analyzed by HSI in the short wave infrared (SWIR: 1000 - 2500 nm).

This C 8 monomer readily dehydrated to form selectively α,β-unsaturated ketone (4 -(2 -furyl) - 3 -buten- 2 -one), which in turn, reacted with furfural forming a C 13 dimer (1, 4 -pentadien- 3 -one, 1, 5 -di- 2 -furanyl). Compared with conventional sodium hydroxide catalyst, activated dolomite was less selective towards lumped C 8 monomers and C 13 dimers owing to carbon losses and deactivation, particularly at high temperatures. Activated dolomite was more selective to C 13 dimer owing to higher adsorption enthalpy of C 8 monomer compared with acetone competitor. Activated dolomite is therefore a promising catalyst to produce C 13 dimers which can be transformed upon hydrogenation and deep hydrodeoxygenation in high-quality diesel fuels. The first-order kinetic model with respect to furfural and acetone fitted well with actual experimental results with an average normalised standard deviation of 6. 2 %...|$|R
