25|$|General {{relativity}} {{predicts that}} pressure {{acts as a}} gravitational source with exactly the same strength as mass-energy density. The inclusion of pressure {{as a source of}} gravity leads to dramatic differences between the predictions of general relativity versus those of Newtonian gravitation. For example, the pressure term sets a <b>maximum</b> <b>limit</b> to the mass of a neutron star. The more massive a neutron star, the more pressure is required to support its weight against gravity. The increased pressure, however, adds to the gravity acting on the star's mass. Above a certain mass determined by the Tolman–Oppenheimer–Volkoff limit, the process becomes runaway and the neutron star collapses to a black hole.|$|E

25|$|Gower {{made his}} debut for Leicestershire on 30 July 1975, during that season's County Championship, against Lancashire at Stanley Park, Blackpool. Winning the toss, Lancashire chose to bat first and amassed 259 {{thanks largely to}} a century by David Lloyd, who would later become Gower's co-commentator. Gower, batting at number seven, scored 32 before he was {{dismissed}} by Ken Shuttleworth, Leicestershire making 321 and taking a first-innings lead. Lloyd made 90 in the second innings as Lancashire declared on 305, with Gower taking one catch to dismiss Jack Simmons for 17. The match, lasting only three days with 100 overs as a <b>maximum</b> <b>limit</b> imposed on both teams for each innings, ended in a draw, with Leicestershire reaching 90 without Gower getting to bat again. Gower continued to make little impression {{during the rest of}} the 1975 season, playing in only two more matches and ending the season with 65 runs at 13.00. He enjoyed greater success in his debut List A season, playing in eight matches, scoring 175 runs at 25.00 with two fifties.|$|E

[...] In specialised applications tolerances as low as ±5µm on both diameters and linear features are achieved in mass production. Surface finishes of 0.0500 to 0.1000µm or better can be obtained.
