The defuzzifier is a method used to <b>map</b> <b>the</b> <b>output</b> fuzzy sets to a crisp output values.

In this paper, {{we propose}} a single SVM-based {{algorithm}} to classify moving objects inside videos and hence extract semantics features for further multimedia processing and content analysis. While standard SVM is a binary classifier and complicated procedures are often required {{to turn it}} into a multi-classifier, we introduce a new technique to <b>map</b> <b>the</b> <b>output</b> of a standard SVM directly into posterior probabilities of the moving objects via Sigmoid function. We further add a post-filtering framework to improve its performances of moving object classification by using a weighted mean filter to smooth the classification results.

40|$|Array {{processing}} is {{an important}} topic in the signal processing field. Many important signal processing techniques such as Spatial Smoothing, Forward Backward Averaging and Root-MUSIC, rely on antenna arrays with specific and precise structures. Arrays with such ideal structures, such as a centro-hermitian structure, are often hard to build in practice. Array interpolation is used to enable the usage of these techniques with imperfect (not having a centro-hermitian structure) arrays. Most interpolation methods rely on methods based on least squares (LS) to <b>map</b> <b>the</b> <b>output</b> of a perfect virtual array based on the real array. In this work, the usage of Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS) is proposed instead of the traditional LS to interpolate arrays with responses largely different from the ideal using non-linear mapping functions...|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{we provide}} a {{straightforward}} proof of an important, but nevertheless little known, result obtained by Lindley {{in the framework}} of subjective probability theory. This result, once interpreted in the machine learning/pattern recognition context, puts new light on the probabilistic interpretation of <b>the</b> <b>output</b> of a trained classifier. A learning machine, or more generally a model, is usually trained by minimizing a criterion [...] -the expectation of the cost function [...] -measuring the discrepancy between <b>the</b> model <b>output</b> and <b>the</b> desired <b>output.</b> In this letter, we first show that, for the binary classification case, training the model with any "reasonable cost function" can lead to Bayesian a posteriori probability estimation. Indeed, after having trained the model by minimizing the criterion, there always exists a computable transformation that <b>maps</b> <b>the</b> <b>output</b> of <b>the</b> model to the Bayesian a posteriori probability of the class membership given the input.

40|$|The {{combination}} of rate k/(k+t) trellis codes with digital modulations described by an asymmetric 2 sup k+ 1 -point signal constellation has been recently shown to yield performance {{improvement over the}} traditional symmetric constellation combined with the same trellis code. The approach taken is to specify an underlying trellis code and then <b>map</b> <b>the</b> <b>output</b> code symbols into the fixed signal constellation based on a rule called mapping by set partitioning. The latter process is tantamount to assigning signals from the constellation to the trellis code transitions so as to maximize the free Euclidean distance of the code. Recently, a new description of trellis codes has been given that combines the above two steps into one. The ideas introduced are further explored, placing particular emphasis on the optimization of the signal constellation asymmetry.

40|$|This letter adopts long {{short-term}} memory(LSTM) {{to predict}} sea surface temperature(SST), {{which is the}} first attempt, to our knowledge, to use recurrent neural network {{to solve the problem of}} SST prediction, and to make one week and one month daily prediction. We formulate the SST prediction problem as a time series regression problem. LSTM is a special kind of recurrent neural network, which introduces gate mechanism into vanilla RNN to prevent the vanished or exploding gradient problem. It has strong ability to model the temporal relationship of time series data and can handle the long-term dependency problem well. The proposed network architecture is composed of two kinds of layers: LSTM layer and full-connected dense layer. LSTM layer is utilized to model the time series relationship. Full-connected layer is utilized to <b>map</b> <b>the</b> <b>output</b> of LSTM layer to a final prediction. We explore the optimal setting of this architecture by experiments and report the accuracy of coastal seas of China to confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method.

40|$|We {{introduce}} a generative probabilistic model for segmentation of brain lesions in multi-dimensional images that generalizes the EM segmenter, a common approach for modelling brain images using Gaussian mixtures and a probabilistic tissue atlas that employs expectation-maximization (EM) {{to estimate the}} label map for a new image. Our model augments the probabilistic atlas of the healthy tissues with a latent atlas of the lesion. We derive an estimation algorithm with closed-form EM update equations. The method extracts a latent atlas prior distribution and the lesion posterior distributions jointly from the image data. It delineates lesion areas individually in each channel, allowing for differences in lesion appearance across modalities, an important feature of many brain tumor imaging sequences. We also propose discriminative model extensions to <b>map</b> <b>the</b> <b>output</b> of the generative model to arbitrary labels with semantic and biological meaning, such as "tumor core" or "fluid-filled structure", but without a one-to-one correspondence to the hypoor hyper-intense lesion areas identified by the generative model.

40|$|Background: Monitoring {{of insect}} vector populations {{with respect to}} their {{susceptibility}} to one or more insecticides is a crucial element of the strategies used for the control of arthropod-borne diseases. This management task can nowadays be achieved more efficiently when assisted by IT (Information Technology) tools, ranging from modern integrated databases to GIS (Geographic Information System). Here we describe an application ontology that we developed de novo, and a specially designed database that, based on this ontology, can be used for the purpose of controlling mosquitoes and, thus, the diseases that they transmit. Methodology/Principal Findings: The ontology, named MIRO for Mosquito Insecticide Resistance Ontology, developed using the OBO-Edit software, describes all pertinent aspects of insecticide resistance, including specific methodology and mode of action. MIRO, then, forms the basis for the design and development of a dedicated database, IRbase, constructed using open source software, which can be used to retrieve data on mosquito populations in a temporally and spatially separate way, as well as to <b>map</b> <b>the</b> <b>output</b> using a Google Earth interface.
