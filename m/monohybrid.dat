5000|$|A <b>monohybrid</b> {{cross is}} a mating between two {{individuals}} with different alleles at one genetic locus of interest. [...] The character(s) being studied in a <b>monohybrid</b> cross {{are governed by}} two or multiple alleles for a single locus.A cross between 2 parents possessing a pair of contrasting characters is known as <b>monohybrid</b> cross.To carry out such a cross, each parent is chosen to be homozygous or true breeding for a given trait (locus). When a cross satisfies the conditions for a <b>monohybrid</b> cross, it is usually detected by a characteristic distribution of second-generation (F2) offspring that is sometimes called the <b>monohybrid</b> ratio.|$|E
50|$|If multifactorial {{inheritance}} {{is indeed}} the case, then the chance of the patient contracting the disease is reduced only if cousins and more distant relatives have the disease. It must be stated that while multifactorially-inherited diseases tend to run in families, inheritance will not follow the same pattern as a simple <b>monohybrid</b> or dihybrid cross.|$|E
50|$|All {{the peas}} of this F1 {{generation}} have an Rr genotype. All the haploid sperm and eggs produced by meiosis received one chromosome 7. All the zygotes received one R allele (from the round seed parent) and one r allele (from the wrinkled seed parent). Because the R allele is dominant to the r allele, the phenotype {{of all the}} seeds was round. The phenotypic ratio in this case of <b>Monohybrid</b> cross is 1:1:1:1.|$|E
50|$|The Law of Independent Assortment {{states that}} alleles for {{separate}} traits are passed independently {{of one another}} from parents to offspring. That is, the biological selection of an allele for one trait {{has nothing to do with}} the selection of an allele for any other trait. Mendel found support for this law in his dihybrid cross experiments (Fig. 1). In his <b>monohybrid</b> crosses, an idealized 3:1 ratio between dominant and recessive phenotypes resulted. In dihybrid crosses, however, he found a 9:3:3:1 ratios (Fig. 2). This shows that each of the two alleles is inherited independently from the other, with a 3:1 phenotypic ratio for each.|$|E
50|$|The forked-line method (also {{known as}} the tree method and the {{branching}} system) can also solve dihybrid and multihybrid crosses. A problem is converted {{to a series of}} <b>monohybrid</b> crosses, and the results are combined in a tree. However, a tree produces the same result as a Punnett square in less time and with more clarity. The example below assesses another double-heterozygote cross using RrYy x RrYy. As stated above, the phenotypic ratio is expected to be 9:3:3:1 if crossing unlinked genes from two double-heterozygotes. The genotypic ratio was obtained in the diagram below, this diagram will have more branches than if only analyzing for phenotypic ratio.|$|E
50|$|Generally, the <b>monohybrid</b> {{cross is}} used to {{determine}} the dominance relationship between two alleles. The cross begins with the parental (P) generation. One parent is homozygous for one allele, and the other parent is homozygous for the other allele. The offspring make up the first filial (F1) generation. Every member of the F1 generation is heterozygous and the phenotype of the F1 generation expresses the dominant trait. Crossing two members of the F1 generation produces the second filial (F2) generation. Probability theory predicts that three quarters of the F2 generation will have the dominant allele's phenotype. And the remaining quarter of the F2s will have the recessive allele's phenotype. This predicted 3:1 phenotypic ratio assumes Mendelian inheritance.|$|E
50|$|Thus, due to {{the nature}} of {{polygenic}} traits, inheritance will not follow the same pattern as a simple <b>monohybrid</b> or dihybrid cross. Polygenic inheritance can be explained as Mendelian inheritance at many loci, resulting in a trait which is normally-distributed. If n is the number of involved loci, then the coefficients of the binomial expansion of (a + b)2n will give the frequency of distribution of all n allele combinations. For a sufficiently high values of n, this binomial distribution will begin to resemble a normal distribution. From this viewpoint, a disease state will become apparent at one of the tails of the distribution, past some threshold value. Disease states of increasing severity will be expected the further one goes past the threshold and away from the mean.|$|E
5000|$|... "Mono" [...] means [...] "one"; this cross {{indicates}} {{that we are}} examining a single trait being crossed. This could mean (for example) that {{we are looking at}} eye color. Each genetic locus is always represented by two letters. So in the case of eye color, say [...] "B = Brown eyes" [...] and [...] "b = green eyes". In this example, both parents have the genotype Bb. For the example of eye color we stated above, this would mean they both have brown eyes. They can produce gametes that contain either the B or the b allele. (It is conventional in genetics to use capital letters to indicate dominant alleles and lower-case letters to indicate recessive alleles.) The probability of an individual offspring's having the genotype BB is 25%, Bb is 50%, and bb is 25%. The ratio of the phenotypes is 3:1, typical for a <b>monohybrid</b> cross.

In this investigation, five nuclearly inherited variegated mutant stocks of Brassica campestris were studied for eight generations to determine their pattern of inheritance and degree of expressivity. The initial F 2 generations and testcrosses gave irregular ratios, but these ratios became more regular and <b>monohybrid</b> for each of the mutant lines when selections were made for more vigorous plants, early seedling emergence, and plump seed.

40|$|VARIATIONS in {{the color}} of corn kernels (Zeamays L.) have {{attracted}} geneticists since theearly 1900 s when studies on the inheritance patterns of kernel color helped validate classical genetics. Even now, research scientists investigate the molecular genetics of these characteristics, and students in introductory biology and genetics courses learn more about <b>monohybrid</b> and dihybrid crosses by studying the inheritance of kernel colors. The reasons for introducing corn genetics in the classroom are obvious—a single ear holds {{a large number of}} progeny and a variety of ears are available that represent basic inheritance patterns, such as the <b>monohybrid</b> cross (3 : 1), the dihybrid cross (9 : 3 : 3 : 1), and more complex genetic patterns illustrating gene interactions (12 : 3 : 1; 9 : 3 : 4, 13 : 3; 9 : 7, etc.). In addition, these ears are obtained readily from several biological supply houses and are relatively inexpensive, espe-cially since students can use them for several years. Students usually confirm different phenotypic ratios of the F 2 generation by first counting kernels, then performing chi-square analyses to test their data. However, their experience can be enriched by introducing explanations about the nature of each gene and its mutations, the related metabolic path-ways, and their locations within the kernel. I have included information in this review that would be appropriate at different levels—from high school biol-ogy to introductory genetics at the college level. The purpose is the same. By exploring these areas, stu-dents more fully understand how these simple pheno-typic ratios and variations are derived. Four Kernel Colors, Four Genes Three of the four kernel colors—yellow, red and purple—are produced by pigments synthesized from one of two metabolic pathways, the carotenoid (yel-low pigments) or the anthocyanin (red and purple pigments) pathway.

Seven biparental cross combinations involving three highly resistant (It- 96, No. 267 and JI 2302) and two highly susceptible (Climax and PF- 400) pea genotypes were evaluated for their response to powdery mildew disease. The quantitative microscopic scale of disease assessment coupled with detached leaf assay was employed for the evaluation of disease response of the crosses and their generations (F 1, F 2, BCs, and BCr) against two highly virulent conidial isolates of Erysiphe pisi. The disease response of 677 F 2 plants has revealed a typical <b>monohybrid</b> Mendelian 3 (susceptible) : 1 (resistant) segregation, moreover, the evaluation of 254 BCr plants gave a perfect 1 (susceptible) : 1 (resistant) segregation.

Winter wheat crosses were investigated {{to determine whether they}} possess genes for resistance that may be useful in a breeding program, as shown by their reactions to those currently important races. Segregations of resistant x susceptible crosses and between resistant varieties were analyzed against expected ratios of genetic hypotheses by the chi-square goodness-of-fit test. Greece 78310 -a- 3 was found to carry one single gene for leaf rust (race 2) resistance. Inoculations with race 15 B- 2 of stem rust indicated that the resistance is also conditioned by one gene, which is at the same locus in NB 66490 and NB 66403 (probably Sr 6). <b>Monohybrid</b> inheritance of reaction to race 32 B of stem rust occurred in the crosses involving Greece 78310 -a- 3.

Direct collaborations between scientists and science teachers bring together complementing knowledge and experience, providing an effective and efficient way to adapt and simplify techniques and procedures to accommodate time and money constraints.

40|$|The {{relative}} {{contributions of}} invertase and sucrose synthase to initial cleavage of phloem-imported sucrose {{was calculated for}} sink leaves of soybean (Glycine max L. Merr cv Wye) and sugar beet (Beta vulgaris L. <b>monohybrid).</b> Invertase from yeast hydrolyzed sucrose 4200 times faster than 1 ′-deoxy- 1 ′-fluorosucrose (FS) while sucrose cleavage by sucrose synthase from developing soybean leaves proceeded only 3. 6 times faster than cleavage of FS. [14 C]Sucrose and [14 C]FS, used as tracers of sucrose, were transported at identical rates to developing leaves through the phloem. The rate of label incorporation into insoluble products varied with leaf age from 3. 4 to 8. 0 times faster when [14 C]sucrose was supplied than when [14 C]FS was supplied. The discrimination in metabolism was related to enzymatic discriminations against FS to calculate the relative contributions of invertase and sucrose synthase to sucrose cleavage. In the youngest soybean leaves measured, 4 % of final laminar length (FLL), all cleavage was by sucrose synthase. Invertase contribution to sucrose metabolism was 47 % by 7. 6 % FLL, increased to 54 % by 11 % FLL, then declined to 42 % {{for the remainder of}} the import phase.

Crown gall tumours induced on tobacco by an Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain carrying a particular mutant Ti plasmid (pGV 2100) were found to give rise to shoots. These shoots were grown in vitro {{and one of them}} (rGV- 1) was found to contain the T-DNA specific enzyme lysopine dehydrogenase (LpDH) and to form roots. After transfer to soil, rGV- 1 developed into a morphologically and functionally normal tobacco plant.

Plantlets obtained from haploid anther cultures were tested for LpDH activity Forty-one percent of these plantlets were LpDH positive. Moreover, both self-pollination of rGV- 1 and crosses between rGV- 1 and normal tobacco plants showed that the LpDH character was transmitted both through the pollen and through the eggs of rGV- 1 as a single dominant factor with Mendelian segregation ratios typical for <b>monohybrid</b> crosses.

40|$|The stable {{inheritance}} of the 2 μm plasmid {{in a growing}} population of Saccharomyces cerevisiae is dependent on two plasmid-encoded proteins (Rep 1 p and Rep 2 p), together with the cis-acting locus REP 3 (STB). In this study we demonstrate that short carboxy-terminal deletions of Rep 1 p and Rep 2 p severely diminish their normal capacity to localize to the yeast nucleus. The nuclear targeting, {{as well as their}} functional role in plasmid partitioning, can be restored by the addition of a nuclear localization sequence to the amino or the carboxy terminus of the shortened Rep proteins. Analyses of deletion derivatives of the Rep proteins by using the in vivo dihybrid genetic test in yeast, as well as by glutathione S-transferase fusion trapping assays in vitro demonstrate that the amino-terminal portion of Rep 1 p (ca. 150 amino acids long) is responsible for its interactions with Rep 2 p. In a <b>monohybrid</b> in vivo assay, we have identified Rep 1 p, Rep 2 p, and a host-encoded protein, Shf 1 p, as being capable of interacting with the STB locus. The Shf 1 protein expressed in Escherichia coli can bind with high specificity to the STB sequence in vitro.

40|$|Expression of the Pseudomonas aeruginosa type III {{secretion}} system (T 3 SS) is {{induced by}} calcium depletion and is positively {{regulated by the}} ExsA transcriptional activator and negatively regulated by the ExsD antiactivator. Under conditions permissive for expression of the T 3 SS, the negative regulatory activity of ExsD is antagonized by a direct binding interaction with ExsC. In the present study, the ExsC-ExsD binding interaction was characterized. Individually, both ExsC and ExsD form self-associated complexes, as judged by bacterial <b>monohybrid</b> and gel filtration experiments. A mixture of purified ExsC and ExsD readily formed a complex that elutes from gel filtration medium as a single included peak. The calculated molecular weight of the ExsC-ExsD complex {{is consistent with a}} complex containing multiple copies of ExsC and ExsD. Isothermic titration calorimetry experiments found formation of the ExsC-ExsD complex to be thermodynamically favorable, with a Kd of ∼ 18 nM and a likely binding ratio of 1 : 1. To identify amino acid residues important for the regulatory activities of ExsC and ExsD, self-association, and complex formation, charged-cluster mutagenesis was performed. Two of the resulting ExsD charged-cluster mutants (DM 2 and DM 3) demonstrated a hyperrepressive phenotype for expression of the T 3 SS. By two-hybrid and copurification assays, the DM 3 mutant was found to be impaired in its interaction with ExsC. This finding demonstrates that the binding of ExsC to ExsD is required for transcriptional induction of the T 3 SS under calcium-limiting growth conditions...|$|E
40|$|READING disabilities, unless {{associated}} with obvious and gross cerebral damage, {{have come to}} be regarded as psychological or pedagogical problems apparently unrelated to the functions of the central nervous system. Most writers on the subject have concluded that there is no evi-dence of organic neurological dysfunction in cases of reading disability. However, since 1905 (Fisher, Thomas) many case reports in the literature have suggested a genetic factor in some forms of dyslexia. Hallgren (1950), on the basis of an analysis of 116 cases of dyslexia, was able to conclude that: "The genetic statistical analysis shows that specific dyslexia {{with a high degree of}} probability, follows a <b>monohybrid</b> autosomal dominant mode of inheritance. " Thus a single gene is involved in a dominant non-sexlinked form of inheritance. Hallgren's work (1950) is the most complete study yet avail-able and tends to confirm the conclusion of earlier workers who made less complete investigations but who for the most part suspected a dominant genetic tendency. If dyslexia is inherited as a dominant trait then either there is a "pure word-letter-blindness " due to failure of formation or maturation of a "reading centre"; or "pure word-letter-blindness " does not exist, and in inherited dyslexia other associated neurological abnormalities can be expected if properly searched for and assessed. The first alternative re-quires a return to the now generally outmoded concept of discrete cerebral localization of function. On the other hand, if associated neurological abnormalities are detected in genetically determined dyslexias, it is necessary to attempt to postulate a unitary defect of cerebral function, which is capable of dominant genetic transmission. Any such formulation must be able to incorporate the many apparently diverse observations int...|$|E
40|$|Observed {{segregation}} for {{reaction to}} stem rust in several oat crosses {{was on a}} <b>monohybrid</b> basis except in the cross Sac x Hajira-Joanette where segregation was observed {{to be on a}} three-factor basis. A mesothetic type of reaction to the composite of races 2 and 8 was observed in seedling plants classified as susceptible in two crosses, Mindo x Tama and Sac x Hajira-Joanette. Since no segregation was observed for reaction to race 2 in either of the two crosses, one factor pair for resistance to race 8 must be allelic to the one governing resistance to race 2 possessed by Tama and Hajira x Joanette. Segregation for reaction to races 1 and 45 of crown rust was on a monogenic, digenic or trigenic basis in different crosses investigated. Five different factors for resistance to crown rust were identified in this study: A and B, complementary dominant factors which give the Bond type (type 0) of resistance of race 1; L, a simple dominant which gives the Landhafer type of resistance (type 0 - 1) to races 1 and 45; S, a simple dominant from Santa Fe which governs resistance (type 0) to races 1 and 45; and V, a simple dominant of the hypersensitive type (type 2) from Victoria which also governs resistance to races 1 and 45. The factor from Santa Fe (S) appears to be of great promise as a source of resistance to the relatively prevalent race 45. Many desirable agronomic progenies possessing resistance to races 1 and 45 from the cross of Santa Fe x Clinton have been selected for further testing. Very few selections have been made from Mindo x Landhafer for testing in F 4.

An occurrence of this sort has recently been noted in one of my maize cultures and the F 2 numbers are explained here as a trihybrid or tetrahybrid ratio. The crosses in question were made primarily for a study of size inheritance and fairly large numbers have been grown. The varieties concerned are two dwarfs of distinctly different types, Tom Thumb pop and California Rice pop, and a tall type Missouri dent. The facts with reference to aleurone color are these: Tom Thumb pop, a 2 ̆ 2 white 2 ̆ 2 corn (i. e., having non-colored aleurone), was crossed with Missouri dent, also a white corn. Three generations of hybrid plants four generations for aleurone and other endosperm characters- have been grown without the appearance of any but white grains.

Genetic analysis has shown {{that this is a}} <b>monohybrid</b> cross and the formulae assigned have been: ordinary goldfish TT, the transparent shubunkin T'T', and the calico fish TT'. The original purpose of the ultraviolet treatment was to destroy certain parts of the color pattern in the calico fish and to study its regeneration. It was, however, soon discovered that lighter treatment than that needed to destroy the chromatophores apparently induced the formation of new pigmented areas. Consequently a more careful program of experimentation was outlined to verify these preliminary findings.

The quartz tube is 16 mm. in diameter, has a length of arc of 50 mm., and operates on 110 -volt circuit. For purposes of destruction of melano phores, treatments frequently of 30 minutes or more were administered, but for stimulation of pigment formation most treatments were of 10 minutes duration at distances varying from 2 cm. to 6 cm. from the lamp. Only a small area was irradiated on each fish. Other parts of the body within the zone of illumination were protected. The areas treated varied from about 0. 2 to 0. 9 sq. cm. in size.

40|$|This {{paper is}} based on 45 cases in 27 families, {{all of which have}} been studied in Children Hospitals. In Switzerland almost all cases of {{infantile}} amaurotic idiocy (Tay-Sachs) have probably been collected, so that the stated 13 primary and 14 secondary cases may allow an estimation of the frequency of this character, which seems to oscillate temporarily. In the last 10 years no new cases have been observed. All 24 autochthonus Swiss cases are from non-Jewish, mostly rural origin, in which Eastern Jews are not to be supposed as ascendants. Our in all 27 families with TS make Slome's statistic of Jewish and non-Jewish cases in literature much more significant; the incidence of parental consanguinity is, as a matter of fact, nearly twice as high in families with non-Jewish origin. There is no evidence of a milder and longer course of TS in non-Jewish families. The mode of inheritance is, according to Slome, <b>monohybrid</b> autosomal recessive, though in remarkably many sibships there is an accumulation of cases. The reduction method, however, gives a percentage of 28, 3 ± 6, 2, coming quite near to the expectation of the Mendelian quarter. The penetrance of the character is total, the expressivity generally very equal, with only a few deviations from the well—known clinical picture of TS. The interfamiliar and intrafamiliar variability therefore is small. In not even one of the families studied have there been found other forms of lipoidosis, principally no cases of splenohepatomegalia Niemann-Pick. All available respective cases in Switzerland have been collected by the present author and will soon be published in these Acta. In none of these families with M. Niemann-Pick have cases of M. Tay-Sachs been seen. This fact is liable to prove that these clinically and anatomically very similar conditions derive from independent i. e. different mutations. Modifying genes may account for the incidence of sibships in which all or almost all children died from M. TS. Environmental influences do not seem to favour its manifestations. If in the newer literature from the U. S. A. the Jewish cases of M.

40|$|Research Doctorate - Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) This thesis {{grew out}} of a {{personal}} interest in genetics and an admiration for the ground breaking research by Gregor Mendel in establishing the foundations of the Science of Genetics. As a high school science teacher I have been interested in how to best support adolescent students’ to learn the experimental methodologies and the hypothesis of <b>monohybrid</b> genetics, and how to improve their acquisition of the concepts and skills required for an understanding of fundamental Mendelian inheritance. Thirty years ago I collected a number of mouse mutants from pet shops and research institutions and set about ensuring that they were pure breeding for particular traits that students find appealing. Since this time I have used live mice in the teaching of high school genetics and have recorded students’ questions, answers and reflections. I have come to understand that for many students the study of high school genetics is not intuitive but conceptually and linguistically difficult. However, I have found that providing an experience of genetics using real mouse crosses to be an effective way to proceed in teaching this problematic science topic. This approach to teaching genetics has its constraints and for my thesis I used Microsoft PowerPoint to create a technology-based multimedia learning environment called “MouseGen”, which simulates cross breeding experiments with live mice. MouseGen contains video clips, photographs, animations, audio and annotated photographic diagrams (Multiple External Representations) and allows numerous students to access a learning experience that had previously been only provided for a single class at a time. I created coloured half disks (MER’s) to represent the different alleles of a gene to assist students learn the abstract concepts of genetics. I have taken seven years to develop and trial this multimedia program and have sought feedback from students and teachers throughout the process. The underlying pedagogical philosophy that I adopted when designing the MouseGen program was a constructivist framework of learning and multimedia development that places the learner at the centre of the process. I selected a pedagogical form of constructivism that encourages students to be set tasks that are appropriate to their cognitive and linguistic capacities, that requires them to be active participants in their own learning, to work together, and to reflect upon and talk about their learning (Morris & Adamson, 2010). The overarching research question for this thesis was whether a Microsoft PowerPoint resource, utilizing multiple external representations to product limits and designed according to constructivist principles, will significantly improve student conceptual development within an area of science that has been historically challenging for them. I developed a number of test instruments to assess students’ acquisition of genetic concepts and skills and to determine their perceptions of the usefulness of MouseGen in learning fundamental genetics. This research adopted a mixed methods approach with both qualitative and quantitative data collection. I am pleased to note that these assessments show that participants rated the MouseGen software very highly and their performance in the post test was significantly improved from the pre-test...|$|E
