A spacecraft ground simulator testbed for Hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) attitude estimation and control with VSCMG is also described. The sensor breakouts with independent <b>micro-controller</b> <b>units</b> {{are used in the}} conventional ADCS units, which are replaced by a single integrated off-the-shelf smartphone. On-board sensing, data acquisition, data uplink/downlink, state estimation and real-time feedback control objectives can be performed using this novel spacecraft ADCS. The attitude control and attitude determination (estimation) schemes have appeared in prior publications, but are presented in brief here. Experimental results from running the attitude estimation (filtering) scheme with the "onboard" sensors of the smartphone in the HIL simulator are given.

40|$|Abstract—ZigBee is the {{emerging}} industrial standard for ad hoc networks based on IEEE 802. 15. 4. Due to {{characteristics such as}} low data rate, low price, and low power consumption, ZigBee {{is expected to be}} used in wireless sensor networks for remote monitoring, home control, and industrial automation. Since {{one of the most important}} goals is to reduce the installation and running cost, ZigBee stack is embedded in small and cheap <b>micro-controller</b> <b>units.</b> Since tree routing does not require any routing tables to send the packet to the destination, it can be used in ZigBee end devices that have limited resources. However, tree routing has the problem that the packets follow the tree topology to the destination even if the destination is located nearby. We propose the shortcut tree routing protocol to reduce the routing cost of ZigBee tree routing by using the neighbor table that is originally defined in the ZigBee standard. While following the ZigBee tree routing algorithm, we suggest forwarding the packet to the neighbor node if it can reduce the routing cost to the destination. Simulation results show that the shortcut tree routing algorithm saves more than 30 percent of the hop count compared with ZigBee tree routing.

Nodes are assumed to be tetherless and battery-powered, and consequently, the overall constraint for each node is energy and data transmission bandwidth. The PIR sensors are responsible for collecting the time-varying HME of each sub-region, and the MCU converts the analogy signal of each PIR sensor into digital signal. If the amplitude of the PIR signal exceed the pre-defined threshold, the radio unit on the node will send the data to the sink.|$|E
40|$|In this paper, we {{consider}} a new methodology {{to obtain a}} PulseWidth Modulated (PWM) signal encoding an oversampled sinusoidal waveform for single-phase inverter drives. More specifically, the obtained switching pattern is optimum {{in the sense that}} it minimizes the spurious harmonic power within a certain band when subject to two constraints: a finite timeresolution and a maximum switching frequency. The first constraint is necessary when the inverter drive control is implemented by a digital system (i. e. a <b>micro-controller</b> <b>unit),</b> while the second one assures a minimum duration of each phase of the driving signal. Due to these constraints, traditional analysis tools for PWM control technique cannot be applied.

40|$|The idea of {{this paper}} targets {{severely}} injured patients who have to be operated upon immediately. In critical cases, the patient is advised not to be moved frequently; but moving him from the stretcher to the operation theatre table is inevitable. Hence wheels have been attached to the table itself for easy movement. The wheels can be locked when surgery is being performed, so that the table is steady. The need not be moved or turned {{on the table to}} operate on the affected parts; this is accomplished by giving rotation to the table to the required angle. The model of this work has four degrees of freedom. It has one linear motion and three rotational motions. The bed is divided into three parts. Two <b>micro-controller</b> <b>units</b> are used along with an IR-TSOP 1738 transmitter and IR-TSAL 7300 receiver in a remote control system. Using this, the parts can be individually turned or titled to the required angle. The other merits of using this bed include; the patient need not be shifted to another bed after surgery, as the model serves the purpose of operation theatre table and a bed, the patient himself can adjust the bed to his comfort, regular monitoring of the patient is done by incorporating temperature sensors. The main objective of the paper is to develop a wireless remote to operate the multi axis operation theatre table...|$|R
40|$|Remote {{attestation}} is {{the process}} of securely veri-fying internal state of a remote hardware platform. It can be achieved either statically (at boot time) or dy-namically, at run-time in order to establish a dynamic root of trust. The latter allows full isolation of a code region from preexisting software (including the oper-ating system) and guarantees untampered execution of this code. Despite the untrusted state of the overall platform, a dynamic root of trust facilitates execution of critical code. Prior software-based techniques lack concrete security guarantees, while hardware-based approaches involve security co-processors that are too costly for low-end embedded devices. In this paper, we develop a new primitive (called SMART) based on hardware-software co-design. SMART is a simple, efficient and secure approach for establishing a dynamic root of trust in a re-mote embedded device. We focus on low-end <b>micro-controller</b> <b>units</b> (MCU) that lack specialized memory management or protection features. SMART requires minimal changes to existing MCUs (while providing concrete security guarantees) and assumes few restric-tions on adversarial capabilities. We demonstrate both practicality and feasibility of SMART by implementing it – via hardware modifications – on two common MCU platforms: AVR and MSP 430. Results show that SMART implementations require only a few changes to memory bus access logic. We also synthesize both implementations to an 180 nm ASIC process to confirm its small impact on MCU size and overall cost. 1...|$|R

Tyre sensors certainly offer an interesting option to evaluate the operating state of an individual tyre. On the other hand, tyre behaviour in some driving conditions is not completely understood and tyre sensor measurements can contribute to the fundamentals of tyre research as well. This thesis discusses a method to measure the carcass deflection of a rolling tyre. Tyre force estimation algorithms are proposed and tested in real time with a low-cost <b>micro-controller</b> <b>unit.</b> The tyre force information is then exploited to estimate the lateral state of a car. In addition, the tyre sensor signals in aquaplaning are carefully studied and the hydrodynamic and viscous aquaplaning zones were separated from the data in post-processing. Another method was developed to estimate partial and full aquaplaning in real time. The results obtained support the development of more production-friendly tyre sensor concepts. The relations between carcass deflections and tyre forces that were obtained can be useful for completely different types of sensors. In addition, tyre behaviour in complex conditions can be measured and the results can validate tyre models...|$|E

The {{main purpose of}} this research is to develop an efficient telemetry system for measuring water pressure and temperature signals. The system reads data from two types of sensors, resistive and capacitive. Anderson circuit configuration has been used for the resistive sensor, since it offers linear like behavior. The capacitive interface is based on capacitance-frequency-voltage conversion that uses phase lock loop (PLL) to convert the frequency to voltage. A developed pressure sensors based on polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) was used to evaluate the performance of the capacitive interface. Two mechanisms have been adopted to reduce the overall power consumption. These are power scheduling and wakeup circuit for the capacitive interface.

We use Synchronous Data Flow (SDF) and Cyclo-Static Data Flow (CSDF) graphs to model channel decoding functions. We want to tackle the problem of scheduling a dynamic mix of multiple radios with throughput constraints on a multi-standard multi-channel channel decoder. The decoder consists of a <b>Micro-Controller</b> <b>Unit</b> (MCU) and several weakly programmable Hardware Units (HU) with internal states and very limited buffer sizes. Each HU has a Round Robin (RR) scheduler hosted on the MCU. To reduce scheduling overhead, RR schedules applications at coarse granularity. Due to limited buffer sizes, some tasks of an application are tightly coupled. We propose a so-called coupled scheduling policy, which is a relaxation of strict gang scheduling, to concurrently schedule these tasks. We propose a technique to model coupled scheduling in (C) SDF graphs. Under our scheduling policies, we also design an admission controller to guarantee the throughput requirements of running applications.

Walking through minefields, deactivating unexploded bombs or clearing out hostile buildings, for example, {{are some of the most}} dangerous tasks a person is asked to perform in the line of duty. What if we could send robots to do these jobs instead of humans? Then, if something went wrong, we'd only lose the money it cost to build the robot instead of losing a human life. And we could always build more robots. Today's modern military forces are using different kinds of robots for different applications ranging from mine detection, surveillance, logistics and rescue operations. In the future they will be used for reconnaissance and surveillance, logistics and support, communications infrastructure, forward-deployed offensive operations, and as tactical decoys to conceal maneuver by manned assets.

Suitable calibration procedures will be also defined for the microphone used in the portable device {{in order to ensure}} the traceability of the obtained measurements. The collected data will be used to identify voice disorders, to prevent an improper use of the voice, and to evaluate the vocal effort induced by noisy and/or reverberant environments. The vocal analyzer is based on a contact-microphone worn by the person under monitoring and a portable micro-controller based unit that hosts conditioning circuitry, analog-to-digital converter and storing memory. Two alternative sensors are investigated as contact-microphones: an accelerometer and an Electret Condenser Microphone. The former is expected to exhibit a negligible sensitivity to air-borne effects, the latter would provide a larger bandwidth, thus allowing parameters related to the vowel quality to be estimated.

40|$|The {{transformer}} is {{a static}} device, which converts power from one level to another level. The {{aim of the}} project {{is to protect the}} transformer under overload condition by load sharing. Due to overload on transformer, the efficiency drops and windings get overheated and may get burnt. Thus by sharing load on transformer, the transformer is protected. This will be done by connecting another transformer in parallel through a micro-controller. The micro controller compares the load on the first transformer with a reference value. When the load exceeds the reference value, the second transformer will share the extra load. Therefore, the two transformer work efficiently and damage is prevented. In this project three modules are used to control the load currents. The first module is a sensing unit, which is used to sense the current of the load and the second module is a control unit. The last module is <b>micro-controller</b> <b>unit</b> and it will read the analogue signal and perform some calculation and finally gives control signal to a relay. A GSM modem is also used to inform the control station about switching. The advantages of the project are transformer protection, uninterrupted power supply, and short circuit protection. When designing low-voltage power system to the supply large load currents, paralleled lower-current modules are often preferred over a single, large power converter for several reasons. These include the efficiency of designing and manufacturing standard modular converters which can be combined in any number necessary to meet a given load requirement and the enhanced reliability gained through redundancy...|$|E

This growing technology allows the transformation of the outdated electric distribution network within buildings to a smart and intelligent system. A major challenge in the development of such infrastructure is the need for low cost, integrated, self-contained, and non-invasive wireless sensor nodes. While an electric meter provides the utility company with information regarding the total energy consumption, no information is provided to the consumers regarding the energy consumed by individual appliances. Such visibility can provide consumers with the ability to better control and manage their energy usage leading to a reduced overall energy consumption. This work explores the design and development of a self-contained and non-invasive integrated system intended for real-time electricity monitoring within residential and commercial buildings.

"Thesis supervisor: Dr. Harry Tyrer. Falls {{have been}} a major cause of {{injuries}} likes fractures, head trauma in elder people. In many cases, these injuries have been fatal. This being a major concern of the Alzheimer's Association, a 'Smart Carpet' to detect a person's fall and accordingly generate an alarm was important. We developed faux floors and an actual floor for testing and demonstration to detect motion. We used a novel technique of signal scavenging to detect presence of the person. Aluminum foils were used as sensors as they were conducive to the applied pressure on them. Rigorous tests and experiments were performed on the faux floor sized 1 m x 1 m (3 feet x 3 feet) and 2. 1 m x 1 m (7 feet x 3 feet) using these aluminum sensors. The noisy output pattern of the aluminum sensor was signal conditioned and converted into digital format using Op-Amps. The digital signal was later interfaced with a <b>micro-controller</b> <b>unit</b> and displayed onto a PC. Graphical analysis with ROC space and personal experience with utilization of the faux floor system gave us confidence to develop a real floor of the size 3. 6 m x 3. 6 m (12 feet x 12 feet). The results obtained on the full floor were beyond the expectations. Previously observed problems like cross-talk, noise interference and abrupt output behavior of the sensor system were avoided with careful manufacturing of carpet and earthing.

40|$|Momentum, gravity, {{and other}} {{ambulation}} forces tend to displace lower limb prosthesis on residual limb. Thus, suspension systems have considerable {{effects on the}} amputee’s mobility, comfort, and satisfaction with prosthesis. Negative effects of poor suspension on rehabilitation, {{as well as the}} comfort and activity level of lower limb amputees, were previously stated. This research aimed to develop a prosthetic suspension system and to explore the biomechanics of prosthesis that incorporates the new system for transtibial amputees. A prosthetic suspension system was designed and fabricated based on magnetic field. Factors that were influenced by the prosthetic suspension were derived through an extensive literature review, and an experimental protocol was subsequently developed. The mechanical properties of the designed suspension system were tested using the universal testing machine. The magnetic suspension system (MPSS) could withstand 350. 9 N of tensile loading before the coupling failed. The system was equipped with an acoustic alarm system as an added safety feature: the safety alarm system would buzz a <b>micro-controller</b> <b>unit</b> if the suspension is going to fail. For validation, the MPSS was compared with two other common suspension systems, i. e. the pin/lock and the Seal-In suspension for validation. The MPSS and pin/lock caused comparable amounts of pistoning, whereas the least pistoning resulted from the Seal-In system. Interface pressure was evaluated by the Tekscan F-Socket transducers during level walking, as well as stair and ramp negotiation. The findings indicate that the mean peak pressure (in kilopascal) was lower with the MPSS than with the pin/lock over the anterior and posterior aspects during one gait cycle (P < 0. 05). Overall, the average peak pressure values were higher with the Seal-In system than the MPSS and the pin/lock system. Particularly important was that the MPSS may reduce the pain and discomfort at the distal residual limb by decreasing iv the pressure within the prosthetic socket in comparison to the pin/lock system during gait. The MPSS caused significantly different peak pressures at the anterior proximal region compared with the pin/lock (P = 0. 022) and Seal-In (P = 0. 001) during the stair ascent and descent, and ramp negotiation. Motion analysis showed that several kinetic and kinematic variables were affected by the suspension type. The ground reaction force data revealed that lower load was applied to the joints with the MPSS compared with the pin/lock suspension. The resulting gait deviation index was considerably different from the normal with all the systems, although the index did not significantly differ among the systems. Main significant effects of the suspension type were evident in the vertical and fore-aft ground reaction forces, knee, and ankle angles. The MPSS showed comparable effects in the remaining kinetic and kinematic gait parameters. Finally, the results of the questionnaire survey revealed significantly high satisfaction rates with the MPSS, especially for donning and doffing, walking, uneven walking, and stair negotiation (P < 0. 05). The MPSS may be used as an alternative suspension system for lower limb amputees because the biomechanical findings fell within the ranges found in the literature and were comparable to two other common suspension systems...|$|E
