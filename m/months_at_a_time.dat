5|$|Pinnipeds spend many <b>months</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> at sea, so {{they must}} sleep in the water. Scientists have {{recorded}} them sleeping for {{minutes at a time}} while slowly drifting downward in a belly-up orientation. Like other marine mammals, seals sleep in water with half of their brain awake so that they can detect and escape from predators. When they are asleep on land, both sides of their brain go into sleep mode.|$|E
5|$|Working from Winthrop Jordan's Black on White (1968), Brodie {{also used}} Dumas Malone's {{documentation}} of Jefferson's activities to correlate his stays at Monticello with the conception period {{of each of}} Sally Hemings' children, whose births he recorded in the Farm Book. She discovered that Hemings never conceived when Jefferson was not at Monticello, during years when he was often away for <b>months</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>time.</b>|$|E
5|$|Closely related matrilines form loose aggregations called pods, usually {{consisting}} {{of one to}} four matrilines. Unlike matrilines, pods may separate for weeks or <b>months</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>time.</b> DNA testing indicates resident males nearly always mate with females from other pods. Clans, {{the next level of}} resident social structure, are composed of pods with similar dialects, and common but older maternal heritage. Clan ranges overlap, mingling pods from different clans. The final association layer, perhaps more arbitrarily defined than the familial groupings, is called the community, and is defined as a set of clans that regularly commingle. Clans within a community do not share vocal patterns.|$|E

5|$|Following their wedding, {{the couple}} leased Windlesham Moor, near Windsor Castle, until July 1949, {{when they took}} up {{residence}} at Clarence House in London. At various times between 1949 and 1951, the Duke of Edinburgh was stationed in the British Crown Colony of Malta as a serving Royal Navy officer. He and Elizabeth lived intermittently in Malta for several <b>months</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> in the hamlet of Gwardamanġa, at Villa Guardamangia, the rented home of Philip's uncle, Lord Mountbatten.

5|$|Under Eyles's command Temeraire {{finally put}} to sea {{at the end}} of July, flying the flag of Rear Admiral Sir John Borlase Warren, and joined the Channel Fleet under the overall command of Admiral Lord Bridport. The Channel Fleet was at that time principally engaged in the {{blockade}} of the French port of Brest, and Temeraire spent several long cruises of two or three <b>months</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> patrolling the area. Eyles was superseded during this period by Temeraires former commander, Captain Puget, who resumed command on 14 October 1799, and the following month Temeraire became the flagship of Rear Admiral James Whitshed.|$|E
5|$|Although sawgrass and sloughs are the {{enduring}} geographical icons of the Everglades, other ecosystems {{are just as}} vital, and the borders marking them are subtle or nonexistent. Pinelands and tropical hardwood hammocks are located throughout the sloughs; the trees, rooted in soil inches above the peat, marl, or water, support a variety of wildlife. The oldest and tallest trees are cypresses, whose roots are specially adapted to grow underwater for <b>months</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>time.</b> The Big Cypress Swamp {{is well known for}} its 500-year-old cypresses, though cypress domes can appear throughout the Everglades. As the fresh water from Lake Okeechobee makes its way to Florida Bay, it meets salt water from the Gulf of Mexico; mangrove forests grow in this transitional zone, providing nursery and nesting conditions for many species of birds, fish, and invertebrates. The marine environment of Florida Bay is also considered part of the Everglades because its sea grasses and aquatic life are attracted to the constant discharge of fresh water.|$|E

5|$|Because {{the orbit}} of Mars is eccentric, its {{apparent}} magnitude at opposition from the Sun can range from −3.0 to −1.4. The minimum brightness is magnitude +1.6 when the planet is {{in conjunction with the}} Sun. Mars usually appears distinctly yellow, orange, or red; the actual color of Mars is closer to butterscotch, and the redness seen is just dust in the planet's atmosphere. NASA's Spirit rover has taken pictures of a greenish-brown, mud-colored landscape with blue-grey rocks and patches of light red sand. When farthest away from Earth, it is more than seven times farther away than when it is closest. When least favorably positioned, it can be lost in the Sun's glare for <b>months</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>time.</b> At its most favorable times—at 15- or 17-year intervals, and always between late July and late September—a lot of surface detail can be seen with a telescope. Especially noticeable, even at low magnification, are the polar ice caps.|$|E
5|$|Conn Smythe {{was born}} on February 1, 1895, in Toronto to Albert Smythe, an Irish Protestant from County Antrim who immigrated to Canada in 1889, and Mary Adelaide Constantine, an English woman. Mary and Albert were married in the 1880s while immigrating to Canada. Albert and Mary had a rocky {{marriage}} and did not live together {{for more than a}} few <b>months</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>time.</b> Mary, who was known as Polly, was remembered by Conn as pretty, a drinker and troublemaker, while Albert was quiet, a vegetarian and a devoted member of Madame Blavatsky's Theosophical movement. Albert Smythe was a charter member of the Theosophical Society of Canada in 1891, and edited its newsletter until the final years of his life.|$|E
5|$|Although {{some species}} of sea anemone burrow in soft sediment, the {{majority}} are mainly sessile, attaching to a hard surface with their pedal disc, and tend {{to stay in the}} same spot for weeks or <b>months</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>time.</b> They can move however, being able to creep around on their bases; this gliding can be seen with time-lapse photography but the motion is so slow as to be almost imperceptible to the naked eye. The process resembles the locomotion of a gastropod mollusc, a wave of contraction moving from the functionally posterior portion of the foot towards the front edge, which detaches and moves forwards. Sea anemones can also cast themselves loose from the substrate and drift to a new location. Gonactinia prolifera is unusual in that it can both walk and swim; walking is by making a series of short, looping steps, rather like a caterpillar, attaching its tentacles to the substrate and drawing its base closer; swimming is done by rapid movements of the tentacles beating synchronously like oar strokes. Stomphia coccinea can swim by flexing its column, and the sea onion anemone inflates and casts itself loose, adopting a spherical shape and allowing itself to be rolled about by the waves and currents. There are no truly pelagic sea anemones, but some stages in the life cycle post-metamorphosis are able, in response to certain environmental factors, to cast themselves off and have a free-living stage that aids in their dispersal.|$|E

5|$|Some of the driest {{land in the}} Everglades is pineland (also called pine rockland) ecosystem, {{located in}} the highest part of the Everglades with little to no hydroperiod. Some floors, however, may have flooded {{solution}} holes or puddles for a few <b>months</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>time.</b> The most significant feature of the pineland is the single species of South Florida slash pine (Pinus elliottii). Pineland communities require fire to maintain them, and the trees have several adaptations that simultaneously promote and resist fire. The sandy floor of the pine forest is covered with dry pine needles that are highly flammable. South Florida slash pines are insulated by their bark {{to protect them from}} heat. Fire eliminates competing vegetation on the forest floor, and opens pine cones to germinate seeds. A period without significant fire can turn pineland into a hardwood hammock as larger trees overtake the slash pines. The understory shrubs in pine rocklands are the fire-resistant saw palmetto (Serenoa repens), cabbage palm (Sabal palmetto), and West Indian lilac (Tetrazygia bicolor). The most diverse group of plants in the pine community are the herbs, of which there are two dozen species. These plants contain tubers and other mechanisms that allow them to sprout quickly after being charred.|$|E
25|$|A severe {{drought in}} the United Kingdom {{needs to have}} the high {{pressure}} {{in charge of the}} weather for an extended period, commonly for weeks or even <b>months</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>time.</b> Most often sea surface temperature anomalies in the Atlantic and intensification of the mid latitude westerlies in the Pacific can bring a stable anticyclone, meaning that the pressure can remain above average for weeks, or even <b>months</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>time,</b> allowing the heat to build and dry weather to continue during the anticyclonic system.|$|E
