5|$|Gargi was the {{daughter}} of sage Vachaknu in the lineage of sage Garga (c. 800-500 BCE) and hence named after her father as Gargi Vachaknavi. Right from a young age, Vachaknavi was very intellectual. She acquired knowledge of the Vedas and scriptures and became renowned for her proficiency in these fields of philosophy; she even surpassed <b>men</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> knowledge.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the years}} she entered some failed {{business}} ventures, including in 1988 a perfume named Woman (after the 1980 John Lennon song) and, in April 1989, a restaurant named Lennon's—at 13/14 Upper St. Martin's Lane, Covent Garden—which had menu items such as Rubber Sole (a play on the already-punning 1965 Beatles album), as well as Sgt. Pepper's Steak and Penny Lane Pâté. It had a short life as a business venture, as it {{was considered to be}} far too expensive. She would later blame some of these efforts on the <b>men</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> life encouraging her.|$|E
5|$|Owing to the Allied withdrawal, {{the vast}} {{majority}} of their dead had to be left on the battlefield. Here they were buried in simple field graves (some little more than their own slit trenches) or in small mass graves dug by the Germans. Kate Ter Horst, whose house was used as a first aid post during the battle, found the graves of 57 <b>men</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> garden when she returned after the war. After Arnhem was liberated in April 1945, Grave Registration Units of the British 2nd Army moved into the area and began to locate the Allied dead. A small field north of Oosterbeek was offered on perpetual loan by the Netherlands government to the Imperial War Graves Commission (now Commonwealth War Graves Commission) in June 1945 and the dead were reburied there. Many of those killed during Arnhem's liberation were also buried at the same site. The cemetery was completed in February 1946, originally with the graves marked by metal crosses, although these were replaced by headstones in 1952. Most of the German dead were buried in the SS Heroes Cemetery near Arnhem after the battle, but reburied in Ysselsteyn German war cemetery after the war.|$|E

Václav Klaus, one of his greatest political adversaries, was elected his successor as President on 28 February 2003. Margaret Thatcher wrote of the two <b>men</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> foreign policy treatise Statecraft, reserving the greater respect for Havel. Havel's dedication to democracy and his steadfast opposition to the Communist ideology earned him admiration.|$|E
25|$|In August 1806 Commander George Morris took command, {{replacing}} Smith, who {{had taken}} command of Penguin in May or June. On 1 October Elk destroyed the five-gun privateer Alliance. Elephant had sent Elk to investigate a schooner. After chasing his quarry for nine hours, Morris eventually caught up with her. Elks masts had received damage in the chase and fearing that he might lose the prize if the winds changed, Morris rammed her. Her commander was M. Alexander St. Helme and she was armed with one long 12-pounder gun, two sixes and two 12-pounder carronades, and carried a crew of 75 <b>men.</b> <b>In</b> <b>her</b> five days out of Guadeloupe, she had taken three prizes, two American schooners and the British brig Neptune, which {{had been on a}} voyage from Jamaica to Exuma. In capturing Alliance, Elk had so damaged her that she sank shortly after Morris took her crew aboard Elk.|$|E
25|$|A true professional, {{she would}} spend months {{preparing}} the new character types {{she wanted to}} represent on stage. These roles had a slightly mocking edge, furthering her popularity among the working class <b>men</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> audience. She was wildly popular among women as well, who viewed her {{as a symbol of}} independence. Newspaper reports of her performances emphasised how popular she was throughout the country, drawing capacity crowds in England, Scotland, Ireland, the Isle of Man and Wales. Often, people were turned away from the theatre as all space, including standing room, had been allocated. In some cases, theatre proprietors were able to ('obliged to' in their parlance) raise ticket prices for her week-run in their theatre. As at the time ticket prices were set regardless of the performers arriving that week, Tilley's ability to sell out even when prices were raised indicates her immense popularity.|$|E

25|$|Then on 16 January 1798 Babets boats {{captured}} the French schooner Désirée. The schooner was sailing towards Babet as Babet was sailing between Martinique and Dominique. As {{soon as the}} schooner realized that Babet was a British warship she attempted to escape. The wind failed and the schooner then took to her sweeps. Lieutenant Pym of Babet took 24 <b>men</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> pinnace and launch and went after the schooner. After rowing several leagues the boats closed to within range of their cannon, which they then commenced to fire. The British closed on their quarry despite a strong counter-fire. The British then boarded Désirée and took her. She was armed with six guns and had a crew of 46 men. The British lost one man killed and five wounded; the French had three men killed and 15 wounded. Désirée was six days out of Guadeloupe and had taken one American brig that had been sailing from St. Vincent to Boston.|$|E
25|$|The {{fleet of}} one brig, two sloops and eight heavily armed junks then {{continued}} south for Chooshan, there on October 16 {{they found the}} town burned and many dead Chinese. Upon investigation the expedition learnt that the pirates had left five days before on October 11 and had killed many men and taken several women. From there they headed for Hoonong and on October 18 they encountered a lookout vessel of Shap Ng-tsai's fleet. Phlegethon chased her down and <b>men</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> boats destroyed the craft. On October 19, the expedition arrived at Hoonong and discovered that the pirates were at anchor twelve miles further near Chokeum in the Gulf of Tonkin. Arriving in the area on October 20, Hay decided first to complete a reconnaissance with the Phlegethon and a few boats, during which they sighted thirty-seven junks in group sailing southwest in Junk Passage for {{the mouth of the}} Tonkin river. Hay regrouped with his ships while the pirate junks searched from 7:00 am to 4:00 pm for the river's opening. When they found it, the Chinese entered, so Hay made plans for passing the bar.|$|E

Shepherd, Bailey and Yang treat a patient admitted in the neurosugical service, who has a tumor pressing against his frontal lobe. His condition forces him to verbally express each thought passing his mind, without being able to control it in any way. Realizing her inability to choose between the two <b>men</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> romantic background, Grey decides on dating both, therefore attempting to compare their dedication towards her.
