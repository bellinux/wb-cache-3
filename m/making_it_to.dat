In 2005, he was named the International Ball Hockey Player of the Year. He has also been inducted into the Canadian and International Ball Hockey Hall of Fame.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} the 2015–16 season, 27 goaltenders and 315 skaters (forwards and defensemen) have {{appeared}} in at least one regular-season game with the Panthers. In 1996, the Panthers had their most successful season, <b>making</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> the Stanley Finals, before losing to the Colorado Avalanche. However, since then the Panthers have made the NHL playoffs only four times, and as a result just six goaltenders and 79 skaters {{have appeared}} in playoff games for Florida.|$|E

If the player enters a vehicle it will automatically throttle, <b>making</b> <b>it</b> difficult <b>to</b> steer. <b>It</b> also damages the vehicle, <b>making</b> <b>it</b> vulnerable <b>to</b> collisions and bullets. An update to the game prevented unauthorised copies from accessing the in-game Internet browser, <b>making</b> <b>it</b> impossible <b>to</b> finish the game as some missions involve browsing the web for objectives.|$|R
5|$|Dortmund {{started off}} their {{campaign}} in the third qualifying of the Champions League round defeating Shakhtar Donetsk 5–1 over two legs. Borussia needed to win their last group game against Liverpool to have any chance of <b>making</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> the second group stage, but they lost 2–0 and were eliminated from Group B on goal difference, after finishing on the same points as Boavista.|$|E
5|$|Due to his size, McGrattan {{believed}} his {{best chance of}} <b>making</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> the NHL was as an enforcer. Dennis Bonvie, the all-time penalty leader in professional hockey, taught {{him to be a}} better fighter while the two were teammates in Binghamton. After posting 173 PIM in 2002–03, McGrattan finished second in the AHL with 327 in 2003–04. He then set an AHL single-season record for penalties with 551 in 2004–05.|$|E

Multiple series called Naruto's fight against Gaara {{the high point}} of the entire series due to their similarities and Gaara's role in the aftermath as he attempts to redeem himself. Among the Naruto reader base, Gaara has been popular, placing high in several popularity polls and always <b>making</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> the top ten characters. Numerous pieces of merchandise have been released in Gaara's likeness, including plush dolls, key chains, and action figures.|$|E
5|$|Pursuing {{the goal}} of {{becoming}} a professional wrestler, Mizanin joined Ultimate Pro Wrestling (UPW), where he trained in the Ultimate University. He made his in-ring debut in 2003 as The Miz. During his time with UPW, The Miz competed in UPW's Mat War's tournament, <b>making</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> the finals before losing to Tony Stradlin.|$|E
5|$|Alan regains {{consciousness}} a week later, apparently having driven his car off the road, {{but with}} no memory of how he got there. He starts to head back towards town, but his progress is hampered by shadowy figures that try to kill him. He observes a strange figure in a diving suit who reminds him of his earlier dream and how to fight the shadows with light. Alan fights through the shadows while finding pages of a manuscript titled Departure with {{his name on the}} by-line, a work he had not written. Eventually <b>making</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> town, Alan tries to alert Sheriff Sarah Breaker of his wife's disappearance, but Sarah states that there has been no island or cabin in Cauldron lake for years after it sunk following a volcanic eruption years prior. Sarah contacts the FBI to investigate Alice's disappearance, while Alan arranges for Barry to come and help.|$|E

5|$|By September, Brooks {{was back}} at a work camp, this time in Svitavy in the Sudetenland. He escaped that month with five other men, this time <b>making</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> Lüneburg inside a coal train prior to his recapture. Sent to a {{prisoner}} of war camp near Wiener Neustadt, he once more tried to escape but failed, suffered a severe beating {{at the hands of the}} Germans, and was again sent back to Stalag VIII-B for two weeks of solitary confinement. Working as a truck helper from a saw mill in Toszek, he slowly acquired maps of Europe and the surrounding region as well as contact information for the Polish Underground State. Having escaped twice already, he risked transfer to a special punishment camp if caught again but, nevertheless, he fled his detention once more, this time with a Scottish soldier by the name of John Duncan, in May 1943.|$|E
5|$|Joe Dante was {{the next}} choice, {{increasing}} the budget for his idea of Daniel Day-Lewis as a brooding Mummy. This version (a draft was written by Alan Ormsby, but it was later re-written by John Sayles) was set in contemporary times and focused on reincarnation with elements of a love story. It came close to being made with some elements, like the flesh-eating scarabs, <b>making</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> the final product. However, at that point, the studio wanted a film with a budget of $15million and rejected Dante's version.|$|E
5|$|On August28, 1869, {{three men}} deserted the expedition, {{convinced}} {{that they could not}} possibly survive the trip through the Grand Canyon. They were killed by Native Americans after <b>making</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> the rim of the canyon; two days later, the expedition ran the last of the Grand Canyon rapids and reached St. Thomas. Powell led a second expedition in 1871, this time with financial backing from the U.S. government. The explorers named many features along the Colorado and Green rivers, including Glen Canyon, the Dirty Devil River, Flaming Gorge, and the Gates of Lodore. In what is perhaps a twist of irony, modern-day Lake Powell, which floods Glen Canyon, is also named for their leader.|$|E

5|$|Placed {{in a tough}} {{group for}} {{qualification}} to the 1970 FIFA World Cup, Scotland failed to qualify after finishing in second place. Bremner captained his country throughout the process, having first taken up the armband in a friendly defeat by Denmark in Copenhagen. He scored his first international goal in a 2–1 qualifying victory over Austria at Hampden Park, his first game as captain. This game was followed by two victories over Cyprus and a 1–1 draw with West Germany, however a 3–2 defeat by West Germany in Hamburg ended their hopes of <b>making</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> the World Cup. Bremner's second international goal came in a 3–2 win over Wales in a British Home Championship game at the Racecourse Ground.|$|E
5|$|The 1989 Draft {{has been}} noted as having been {{exceptionally}} successful for Detroit. While team executive Jim Devellano stated the team would be satisfied with two players from that draft <b>making</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> the NHL, seven of them did so. Those seven players (Mike Sillinger, Bob Boughner, Lidstrom, Fedorov, Shawn McCosh, Dallas Drake and Vladimir Konstantinov) amassed 5,995 games played, 1,227 goals, 2,367 assists, 3,594 points and 5,108 penalties in minutes. That draft has also been marked as signalling a paradigm shift for Detroit as prior to that the club was very reluctant to draft players from outside North America. Since then the club has drafted {{a large number of}} European as well as other non-North American players. In 2000, for example, they drafted four Swedes, three Russians, two Canadians, one Slovak and one American.|$|E
5|$|The Italians {{captured}} {{most of the}} KJRM in port, including Ljubljana, {{which had}} spent {{the duration of the}} invasion in dry-dock. However, Zagreb was blown up and scuttled at the Bay of Kotor by two junior officers, Sergej Mašera and Milan Spasić, to prevent her capture. The submarine Nebojša and two Orjen-class MTBs escaped to Alexandria to join the Allied cause. A fourth destroyer, Split, was captured while under construction in the Kotor shipyard, but the Italians were not able to complete her before they sued for peace in September 1943. She was completed by the Yugoslav Navy after the war. Ten Maritime Air Force aircraft escaped to Greece, with nine eventually <b>making</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> Egypt, where they formed a squadron under Royal Air Force command.|$|E

According to the 2016 CMCI, Manila was the second most competitive city in the Philippines. Manila placed third in the Highly Urbanized City (HUC) category. Manila held the title country's most competitive city in 2015, and since then has been <b>making</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> the top 3, assuring {{that the city is}} consistently one of the best place to live in and do business. Lars Wittig, the country manager of Regus Philippines, hailed Manila as the third best city in the country to launch a start-up business.|$|E
5|$|The {{club has}} seen its share of struggles, {{both on and off}} the ice. The team has had two changes of ownership, from Firestone to Rod Bryden in 1993 due to the arena {{development}} process and its financing, and subsequently to Eugene Melnyk after the team filed for bankruptcy in 2003. On the ice, the club finished last in the League in its first four seasons. Changes in hockey management have led to steady improvement of the team's play, resulting in the team qualifying for the Stanley Cup playoffs in 11 of the last 12 seasons, winning the Presidents' Trophy in 2002–03 and <b>making</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> the Stanley Cup Finals in 2007.|$|E
5|$|Braham and Walsh {{scrambled}} {{free of the}} Mosquito and {{hid behind}} a sand dune. As they did so the aircraft's fuel tanks exploded. The Fw 190 pilot flew over at 20 feet {{and for a moment}} they believed he was going to fire upon them. To their relief he waved and flew by. They contemplated escape but instantly German soldiers were running towards them. They had crash-landed near to a radar station and the enemy soldiers were at the crash site very quickly. The Germans fired a few shots in their direction but none hit them. They were captured and searched. The Germans found a Mauser pistol which Braham had taken from a crashed German bomber. It was not well received by his captors. Braham believed they might attack him and he had thought about grabbing the gun, fighting it out with the German guards, finding a friendly Dane and <b>making</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> Sweden somehow. The tension eased when he was taken to a barracks and offered some synthetic German coffee. Soon a pair of Luftwaffe officers arrived and escorted him to a cell on an airfield near Esjberg.|$|E
