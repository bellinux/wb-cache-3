5|$|As the {{hydrogen}} shell burning produces more helium, the core increases in mass and temperature. In a red giant {{of up to}} 2.25 , {{the mass of the}} helium core becomes degenerate prior to helium fusion. Finally, when the temperature increases sufficiently, helium fusion begins explosively in what is called a helium flash, and the star rapidly shrinks in radius, increases its surface temperature, and <b>moves</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> horizontal branch of the HR diagram. For more massive stars, helium core fusion starts before the core becomes degenerate, and the star spends some time in the red clump, slowly burning helium, before the outer convective envelope collapses and the star then <b>moves</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> horizontal branch.|$|E
