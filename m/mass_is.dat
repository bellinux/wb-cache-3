5|$|A white dwarf, {{also called}} a {{degenerate}} dwarf, is a stellar core remnant composed mostly of electron-degenerate matter. A white dwarf is very dense: its <b>mass</b> <b>is</b> {{comparable to that}} of the Sun, while its volume is {{comparable to that of}} Earth. A white dwarf's faint luminosity comes from the emission of stored thermal energy; no fusion takes place in a white dwarf wherein <b>mass</b> <b>is</b> converted to energy. The nearest known white dwarf is Sirius B, at 8.6 light years, the smaller component of the Sirius binary star. There are currently thought to be eight white dwarfs among the hundred star systems nearest the Sun. The unusual faintness of white dwarfs was first recognized in 1910. The name white dwarf was coined by Willem Luyten in 1922.|$|E

30|$|In this Letter, the {{frequency}} shift and sensitivity of carbon-nanotube-based sensor with an attached <b>mass</b> <b>was</b> studied using nonlocal elasticity theory. The relationship equation between {{the frequency}} {{shift of the}} sensor and the attached <b>mass</b> <b>was</b> derived analytically. When the nonlocal effect was not taken into account, the result was compared with the previous study, which adopted a simplified method and obtained an approximate result. According to this study, {{the result showed that}} increasing the nonlocal parameter obviously decreased the frequency shift of the sensor when the attached <b>mass</b> <b>was</b> small compared with that of the sensor. The value of frequency shift was larger when the location of the attached <b>mass</b> <b>was</b> closer to the free end. In addition, a high sensitivity of the sensor was revealed when the attached <b>mass</b> <b>was</b> small. However, the sensitivity quickly dropped as the location of the attached <b>mass</b> <b>was</b> closed to the fixed end.|$|R
50|$|Einstein’s {{equivalence}} principle postulates that inertial mass must equal passive gravitational mass. The law of conservation of momentum requires that active and passive gravitational <b>mass</b> <b>be</b> identical. All experimental evidence {{to date has}} found these are, indeed, always the same. In considering negative <b>mass,</b> it <b>is</b> important to consider which of these concepts of <b>mass</b> <b>are</b> negative. In most analyses of negative <b>mass,</b> it <b>is</b> assumed that the {{equivalence principle}} and conservation of momentum continue to apply, and therefore all three forms of <b>mass</b> <b>are</b> still the same.|$|R
5|$|Gravity {{tends to}} {{contract}} celestial bodies into a perfect sphere, the shape {{where all the}} <b>mass</b> <b>is</b> {{as close to the}} center of gravity as possible. But a rotating star is not spherical in shape, it has an equatorial bulge.|$|E
5|$|On June 7, 2010, {{long after}} the microlensing event had subsided, the science teams {{studying}} the star used the NACO adaptive optics facility at the Very Large Telescope in Chile to determine the actual apparent magnitude of the star that microlensed its background star, hoping {{to compare it to}} the magnitude of the star measured during the microlensing event. A discrepancy was found, a discrepancy that may have been a result of either error or of a planetary body. Interpretation of follow-up observations led to the planet's confirmation. The ratio between the planet's mass and its host star's <b>mass</b> <b>is</b> well-constrained, but a large interval of uncertainty exists because the host star's <b>mass</b> <b>is</b> known within a large confidence interval that spans the mass of all red dwarf stars.|$|E

5|$|A {{study of}} 27 Milky Way neighbors {{found that in}} all dwarf galaxies, the central <b>mass</b> <b>is</b> {{approximately}} 10 million solar masses, {{regardless of whether the}} galaxy has thousands or millions of stars.

5|$|A {{variety of}} nuclear fusion {{reactions}} {{take place in}} the cores of stars, that depend upon their mass and composition. When nuclei fuse, the mass of the fused product is less than the mass of the original parts.

5|$|Although thin, these {{outer layers}} {{determine}} the thermal {{evolution of the}} white dwarf. The degenerate electrons in the bulk of a white dwarf conduct heat well. Most of a white dwarf's <b>mass</b> <b>is</b> therefore at almost the same temperature (isothermal), {{and it is also}} hot: a white dwarf with surface temperature between 8,000K and 16,000K will have a core temperature between approximately 5,000,000K and 20,000,000K. The white dwarf is kept from cooling very quickly only by its outer layers' opacity to radiation.|$|E
5|$|Because at {{any given}} point on Earth {{the weight of a}}n object is {{proportional}} to its mass, the mass of an object in kilograms is usually measured by comparing its weight to the weight of a standard mass, whose <b>mass</b> <b>is</b> known in kilograms, using a device called a weighing scale. The ratio of the force of gravity on the two objects, measured by the scale, is equal to the ratio of their masses.|$|E

[...] Superior air <b>masses</b> <b>are</b> dry, and rarely reach the ground.

Continental Polar air <b>masses</b> (cP) <b>are</b> air <b>masses</b> that <b>are</b> cold and dry due to their continental source region. Continental polar air masses that affect North America form over interior Canada. Continental Tropical air <b>masses</b> (cT) <b>are</b> a type of tropical air produced by the subtropical ridge over large areas of land and typically originate from low-latitude deserts such as the Sahara Desert in northern Africa, which is the major source of these air masses.

Plutonium in solution is more likely to form a critical mass than the solid form due to moderation by the hydrogen in water.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{consisting}} {{mostly of}} hydrogen and helium, most of Saturn's <b>mass</b> <b>is</b> {{not in the}} gas phase, because hydrogen becomes a non-ideal liquid when the density is above 0.01g/cm3, which is reached at a radius containing 99.9% of Saturn's mass. The temperature, pressure, and density inside Saturn all rise steadily toward the core, which causes hydrogen to be a metal in the deeper layers.|$|E

5|$|Ferugliotherium {{was much}} smaller than the sudamericids Gondwanatherium and Sudamerica, and its body <b>mass</b> <b>is</b> {{estimated}} to have been about 70g (2.5oz). Unlike the hypsodont (high-crowned) sudamericids, Ferugliotherium has brachydont (low-crowned) molariform teeth that are supported by at least two roots, not a single massive root. The direction of wear on the teeth indicates that Ferugliotherium, Gondwanatherium, and Sudamerica all had palinal jaw movement (i.e., the lower jaw moved backwards during the power stroke of chewing)—a feature otherwise only seen in multituberculates among mammals.|$|E
