5|$|A {{month after}} Letcher signed the treaty, Clayton was {{replaced}} as Secretary of State by Daniel Webster. In response to concerns raised {{by one of}} the Americans hoping to construct the line of transit, Webster asked that Letcher attempt to obtain certain <b>modifications</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> treaty. Letcher brought these <b>modifications</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Mexican diplomats, but they steadfastly refused to accept them. Letcher, speaking with the blessing of the administration, intimated that the United States would take the region by force if the requested concessions were not made. The Mexican government conceded {{that they would not be}} able to resist such action, but still refused to accept the <b>modifications</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> treaty.|$|E

5|$|Ecosystems are {{composed}} {{of a variety of}} abiotic and biotic components that function in an interrelated way. The structure and composition is determined by various environmental factors that are interrelated. Variations of these factors will initiate dynamic <b>modifications</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ecosystem. Some of the more important components are: soil, atmosphere, radiation from the sun, water, and living organisms.|$|E

5|$|Night diving {{can allow}} the diver to {{experience}} a different underwater environment, because many marine animals are nocturnal.

5|$|This {{does not}} appear to be the entire story. Four <b>modifications</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{cytosine}} residues in human DNA have been reported.

5|$|A {{small number}} of pillboxes had been {{constructed}} in the First World War and where possible these were integrated into the defence plans. Some pillboxes may pre-date {{the publication of the}} FW3 designs, but in any case some local commanders introduced <b>modifications</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> standard FW3 designs or introduced designs of their own. These non-standard design pillboxes may be produced in some numbers or completely ad hoc designs suited to local conditions. Other designs were produced as commercial ventures.|$|E
5|$|Almost every fighter {{project in}} the postwar era {{immediately}} applied the concept, which started appearing on production fighters in the late 1940s. Avro engineers explored swept-wing and tail <b>modifications</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> CF-100 known as the CF-103, which had proceeded to wooden mock-up stage. The CF-103 offered improved transonic performance with supersonic abilities in a dive. However, the basic CF-100 continued to improve through this period, and the advantages were continually eroded. When a CF-100 broke the sound barrier on 18 December 1952, interest in the CF-103 waned.|$|E
5|$|Aware of the {{problems}} revealed in flight tests, McDonnell reviewed the program and proposed a new development based on a more conventional design promising a Mach 0.9 capability, using alternatively a 35° swept wing and delta wing. McDonnell also considered adding a telescoping extension to the docking trapeze that would extend the device below the turbulent air under the mother ship. Before any further work on the trapeze, other <b>modifications</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> XF-85, or continued design studies on its follow-up could be carried out, the USAF canceled the XF-85 program on 24 October 1949.|$|E

5|$|Beginning in {{the late}} 1950s, Dasho Shingkhar Lam, former Secretary to Jigme Dorji Wangchuck and Sixth Speaker of the National Assembly (1971–74), was {{requested}} by the king to make several <b>modifications</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> flag; {{he is responsible for}} its current design, which has remained unchanged since 1969. The king was reportedly dissatisfied that the early square Bhutanese flags did not flutter like the rectangular Indian flag displayed on the visit of an Indian official to the country. The standard measurements of the flag of Bhutan were thereafter altered to resemble the flag of India, which was 9 feet by 6 feet.|$|E
5|$|Deliveries {{commenced}} in 1982 to Strawberry Hill. On 16 November 1982, 455805 {{was unveiled}} {{to the press}} at Waterloo station. The first entered service on 28 March 1983. All were initially allocated to Wimbledon depot working services on the Central and South Western divisions. The Central Division 455/8s were transferred to Selhurst in 1986 after <b>modifications</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> depot were completed. All were delivered in British Rail blue and white livery, before being repainted in Network SouthEast white, blue and red livery from 1986. In May 1991, 455743 was renumbered 455750 and renamed Wimbledon Traincare depot {{in recognition of the}} depot obtaining BS5750 quality services accreditation.|$|E
5|$|Discussions on {{improving}} the UN's effectiveness and responsiveness to international security threats often include {{reform of the}} UNSC veto. Proposals include: limiting {{the use of the}} veto to vital national security issues; requiring agreement from multiple states before exercising the veto; abolishing the veto entirely; and embarking on the transition stipulated in Article 106 of the Charter, which requires the consensus principle to stay in place. Any reform of the veto will be very difficult. Articles 108 and 109 of the United Nations Charter grant the P5 veto over any amendments to the Charter, requiring them to approve of any <b>modifications</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> UNSC veto power that they themselves hold.|$|E
