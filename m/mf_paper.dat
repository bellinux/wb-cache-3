40|$|Three {{different}} polyols (soluble starch, sucrose, and glycerol) {{were tested}} for their {{potential in the}} chemical modification of melamine formaldehyde (<b>MF)</b> resins for <b>paper</b> impregnation. <b>MF</b> impregnated <b>papers</b> are widely used as finishing materials for engineered wood. These polyols were selected because the presence of multiple hydroxy groups in the molecules was suspected to facilitate cocondensation with the main MF framework. This should lead to good resin performance. Moreover, they are readily produced from natural feedstock. They are available in large quantities and may serve as economically feasible, environmentally harmless alternative co-monomers suitable to substitute a portion of fossil-based starting material. In the presented work, a number of model resins were synthesized and tested for covalent incorporation of the natural polyol into the MF Framework. Spectroscopic evidence of chemical incorporation of glycerol was found by applying by 1 H, 13 C, 1 H/ 13 C HSQC, 1 H/ 13 C HMBC, and 1 H DOSY methods. It was furthermore found that covalent incorporation of glycerol in the network took place when glycerol was added at different stages during synthesis. Further, all resins were used to prepare decorative laminates {{and the performance of}} the novel resins as surface finishing was evaluated using standard technological tests. The technological performance of the various modified thermosetting resins was assessed by determining flow viscosity, molar mass distribution, the storage stability, and in a second step laminating impregnated paper to particle boards and testing the resulting surfaces according to standardized quality tests. In most cases, the average board surface properties were of acceptable quality.

With the {{increase}} {{of the number of}} mobile services, for service recommendation and selection, the nonfunctional properties (also known as quality of service, QoS) become increasingly important. However, in many cases, the number of mobile services invoked by a user is quite limited, which leads to the large number of missing QoS values. In recent years, many prediction algorithms, such as algorithms extended from collaborative filtering (CF), are proposed to predict QoS values. However, the ideas of most existing algorithms are borrowed from the recommender system community, not specific for mobile service.

This technique is highly desirable for effective problem solving in many application domains. Over the past two decades, compositional modeling (CM) has established itself as a leading approach in automated modeling.

This paper introduces the Monotonic Feature (MF) abstraction—where the probability of class membership increases monotonically with the <b>MF’s</b> value. The <b>paper</b> proves that when an MF is given, PAC learning is possible with no hand-labeled data under certain assumptions. We argue that MFs arise naturally in a broad range of textual classification applications. On the classic “ 20 Newsgroups ” data set, a learner given an MF and unlabeled data achieves classification accuracy equal to that of a state-of-the-art semi-supervised learner relying on 160 hand-labeled examples. Even when MFs are not given as input, their presence or absence can be determined from a small amount of hand-labeled data, which yields a new semi-supervised learning method that reduces error by 15 % on the 20 Newsgroups data. ...|$|R

An ultrasonic time-domain reflectometry (UTDR) technique has been applied to the non-invasive, in situ, continuous visualisation of fouling and defouling in flat-sheet crossflow microfiltration (<b>MF)</b> membranes. <b>Paper</b> mill effluent from a wastewater treatment plant was used as the feed solution. Fouling experiments were carried out at axial velocities of 1. 0 and 42 mm/s, so that two modes of fouling-layer growth were observed. Changes in the amplitude of the acoustic signal response corresponded well with flux-decline behavior. The UTDR technique was able to distinguish between the two modes of growth. The ultrasonic technique could effectively detect fouling-layer initiation, its growth on and removal from the membrane in real-time. Data also showed the formation of a second echo in the time domain at lower operating pressure (100 kPa). Therefore, the UTDR technique was used to quantify the thickness of a fouling layer on the membrane surface. Moreover, the UTDR technique was also employed for monitoring membrane cleaning and evaluating the cleaning effectiveness of various cleaning methods. Results of cleaning experiments show that ultrasound associated with flushing is the most effective cleaning method. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) pictures were taken of the fouling and defouling layers. The UTDR is a more powerful non-invasive technique for the in situ visualisation of fouling and defouling in crossflow MF membranes. Conference Pape...|$|R

40|$|Although the {{principal}} mechanisms of crossflow microfiltration (MF) are well-known, the practical {{applicability of the}} resulting microfiltration models is still limited. This can be largely attributed {{to the lack of}} understanding of effects of polydispersity in the particulate suspensions, as relevant to concentration polarisation in <b>MF.</b> This <b>paper</b> describes an investigation of concentration polarisation behaviour of bidisperse suspensions, in the regime where shear-induced diffusion is the dominant back-transport mechanism. In the transient flux regime, the particle deposition onto the membrane was monitored by means of confocal scanning laser microscopy. As in accordance with the linear dependence of the shear-induced diffusivity on a 2, only the small particles in the bidisperse suspensions were found to deposit onto the membrane. The back-transport flux that was calculated from the deposition rate and the actual permeate flux, was found to be independent of the composition of the suspension, whereas it was equal to the back-transport flux of a monodisperse suspension of the small particles only, with a similar total particle fraction. These results can be explained with the occurrence of particle size segregation in the feed flow, which leads to an enrichment with small particles of the suspension near the membrane. The findings are also shown to be relevant to particle fractionation processes by MF. In such fractionation processes, particle size segregation is found to have a strong effect on the separation characteristics such as particle size and fat content of the permeate. A polydisperse suspension could be fractionated using a membrane having a pore size larger than the largest particles present. The fractionation thus results not from size exclusion in the membrane, but from segregation effects in the feed channel...|$|R

Given current legislation and public opinion on GM plants, in particular in the EU, the containment production in greenhouses and its stable production conditions are seen as an opportunity for <b>MF.</b> This <b>paper</b> focuses on Arabidopsis thaliana as seed-specific production platform. To evaluate the factors which may be crucial for possible conversion of greenhouse companies and the possible impact of conversion at firm level, simulations are carried out based on individual data from greenhouse companies belonging to the Flemish Farm Accountancy Data Network (FADN). Estimations of protein yields are based on experiments with Arabidopsis thaliana. Conversion simulations are carried out for different types of greenhouse companies (ornamental plants, vegetables) and for different yield levels of proteins. The results show that the impact of conversion to MF in greenhouse horticulture is highly firm specific. For each greenhouse company in the sample, on the basis of an opportunity cost perspective, a threshold price for conversion is calculated, allowing to construct supply curves for both ornamental plant and vegetable growers. These findings reveal feasibility for certain greenhouse growers to produce high-value recombinant proteins in limited amounts, such as medication for rare diseases and clinical trials. Sensitivity analyses show that threshold prices are influenced by productivity fluctuations, indicating that greenhouse MF has potential to improve competitiveness through technological progress.

To this extent, we then propose an opportunistic secure transmission protocol to minimise the SOP of the CWNs. In particular, an optimisation problem is developed in which secrecy rate thresholds (SRTs) are determined to find an optimal scheme among various DT and RT schemes for achieving the lowest SOP. Furthermore, the conditions for the existence of SRTs are derived with respect to various channel conditions to determine if the relay could be relied on in practice...|$|R

An appropriate mix of the contextual information such as learning sequence similarity, technology and project context, identified by our approach, improve the recommendation performance for enterprise learning. Manouselis et al. [10] observes that the top-down, closed-corpus-based formal learning and intra-enterprise informal learning are different as the user tasks and goals are different. They summarize the usefulness of recommendation techniques such as collaborative filtering (CF) and data mining techniques such as k-nearest neighbour (kNN) or vector-based models such as singular value decomposition (SVD) or matrix factorization (<b>MF).</b> In this <b>paper,</b> we have used many of these techniques as baselines and observe that these techniques do not consider the sequentiality of trainings and relations such as prerequisites among trainings, which reduces their effectiveness in enterprise learning scenario.

In [12], the authors suggest an upper confidence bound-based multi-armed bandit learning algorithm for recommending an item-set in online setting where items are correlated, specifically to the first item. The employed rewarding scheme for the multi-arm bandit provides an increased reward for the first bandit so that it recommends the right first item followed by a set of items which have inter-dependence.

More attention is now being paid to the high number of disease-causing germs in the sewage treatment plant effluent. Micro and ultra filtration, combined with the activated sludge process, has turned out in recent years to be a suitable method for minimising the effluent load. Tightening discharge standards for sewage treatment effluents can thus be met, without the need for the conventional aeration and secondary clarification tanks or filtration and disinfection plants. Membrane bioreactor technology provides a good alternative to the conventional treatment of municipal wastewater (Huber Technology, 2004). - Most of the current regulatory requirements will be met by the membrane separation step. - Membrane bioreactor technology is a space saving technique. Its modulebased design allows the capacity to be easily increased when needed. - Membranes will continue to decrease in price in the coming years. - With improved effluent quality, re-use of the formerly wasted effluent is possible, which makes it a sustainable technology. - It combines the biological treatment with a membrane separation step. Because of this combination it has several advantages over conventional treatment by activated sludge followed by a settling tank. - The settling tank is unnecessary because of the membrane separation; submerged membrane bioreactors can be up to 5 times smaller than a conventional activated sludge plant. - Membrane bioreactors can be operated at mixed liquor suspended solids of up to 20, 000 mg/L. - Biomass concentration can be greater than in conventional systems, which reduces reactor volume. - The membrane can retain soluble material with a high molecular weight, improving its biodegradation in the bioreactor. - Good effluent quality. - Good disinfection capability, with significant bacterial and viral reductions achievable using UF and <b>MF</b> membranes.
